Chapter 1
Quality office management
Learning outcomes
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
 
define the concepts quality management and total quality management;
 
discuss how the administrative manager will provide a stable administrative 
environment for effective decision making and good administrative practice;
 
explain the role of administrative systems and processes in quality administrative 
management; and
 
discuss systems and process thinking as an approach to quality administrative 
management.
1.1 Introduction
This chapter should help you develop an understanding of quality management 
and total quality management in the context of the administrative practice.
Being an administrative manager means being the leader of administrative 
activities in your organisation. Effective leadership in administration requires 
that the administrative manager provides direction in terms of developments in 
administrative management and creates a stable administrative environment. This 
means the administrative manager should manage the quality of the administrative 
function.  This is achieved by managing the administrative policies, procedures, 
systems and processes as part of the total quality management system of the 
organisation. The backbone of sound administration is well-designed policies 
and procedures that provide a framework for administrative decisions to be made 
and executed in terms of the systems and processes involved in the execution of 
the procedures. The levels of conflict between work and family will be impacted 
or moderated by the level of support employees receive, the personal attributes 
they bring to the job, the industry norms and the way all these components are 
managed in the workplace. The management of all the components leads us to the 
topic of total quality management which is key to our discussions in this chapter. 
Within this framework, we look at the management of administrative policies and 
procedures, the role of administrative systems and processes in quality management, 
the relation between service delivery and administrative management and systems 
and lastly, process thinking as an approach to quality administrative management.

Quality in the Office
In this chapter, we look at the nature of management, total quality management, 
administrative policies and procedures management, systems and processes in 
quality administrative management, management systems and process thinking 
as an approach to quality administrative management and lastly, business process 
engineering and quality administrative management.
1.2 The nature of management
1.2.1 Quality management
Quality management (QM) in its simplest form refers to the management of quality 
in an organisation. The management of quality has gained momentum over recent 
years and as an organisational function essentially involves determining standards 
so that managers and employees can measure performance against predetermined 
criteria. One of the essential features of quality management is the standardisation 
of policies, procedures, systems and processes. These standards and criteria can 
be used by organisations as a quality management tool by measuring existing 
systems and practices against them. Dr Joseph Juran, born in Romania in 1904, 
is considered the architect of quality management and helped to invent quality 
management systems long before they became standard practice in organisations 
(Bisgaard, 2008). He is acknowledged as the person ‘who added the managerial 
dimension to quality’. In 1979, at the age of 75, Dr Juran founded the Juran 
Institute, Inc. (JII) (Blackiston,1996). This institute ‘initially focused on providing 
training and techniques to improve organisation quality [and] it grew over the 
years to provide clients and society with a full complement of tools and techniques 
to improve business results’. This reference to business results is important because 
quality management in business concerns itself with the continuous improvement 
of each and every process. Its aim is to achieve higher levels of efficiency, to 
ensure the highest possible profit margins and lowest costs, to avoid unnecessary 
expenditure, eliminate wastage and optimise human resources, and so forth. 
Continuous improvement is also a strong feature of business process engineering. 
We look at this topic later in this chapter, in section 1.6.
Recent trends in quality management include a shift in emphasis. Initially the 
mere compliance with or conformance to standards, often referred to as ‘meeting 
minimum requirements’, was the focus of quality efforts. This has changed to the 
realisation that opportunities for the enhancement of quality levels and raising 
the levels of excellence, be it in products and services or systems and procedures, 
should be created. This has recently become known as quality promotion. As a 
result, many organisations are moving towards the adoption and implementation 
of quality management models. In South Africa, the South African Excellence 
Foundation (SAEF) is responsible for the evaluation of organisations who have 
implemented this model. The aim of the model is to help organisations separate the

various business processes to address the management of quality throughout the 
organisation. This is mostly referred to as total quality management. We look at the 
SAEF model later in this chapter (see Table 1.1).
1.2.2 Total quality management (TQM)
A number of different definitions, descriptions and perceptions of TQM are used 
in organisations today. As a result there is widespread ambiguity in terms of the 
concept ‘quality’. Rouse (2005) describes TQM as a comprehensive and structured 
approach to organisational management that seeks to improve the quality of 
products and services through ongoing refinements in response to continuous 
feedback. Oschman, Ströh and Auriacombe (2006) accepted the following definition 
of quality for a study they conducted: quality is the degree of added value to 
products and/or service delivery, as perceived by all the stakeholders, through 
conformance to specifications, and the degree of added excellence to products 
and/or service delivery through a motivated workforce in the organisation’s aim to 
ensure customer satisfaction.
You will note a number of key elements in this definition:
 
The first element is that of the value that a product or service can add to a 
certain aspect if the quality of a product or service is continuously addressed and 
improved – the higher the quality, the higher the added value.
 
The second element is that of conformance to standards. This refers to the 
process of managing the quality in such a way that the customers are aware of 
the fact that the organisation sets and maintains certain standards. Normally 
organisations also use the fact that they take pride in the setting and maintaining 
of standards as a marketing tool to differentiate between the quality of their 
product and someone else’s.
 
The third important point is that of excellence. There are a number of approaches 
to the management of quality, but many organisations make the fact that they 
strive for excellence part of their mission statements as a strategy to set them 
apart from providers of similar services in the market.
 
The fourth point to be highlighted from the definition mentioned above is that 
quality cannot be achieved without a motivated workforce. We often hear quality 
costs money and that is certainly true. Your organisation needs suitably qualified 
human resources to be able to produce products of the required standards and to 
deliver high-quality services. 
Service delivery is therefore an important aspect of the management of quality. In 
South Africa, the Batho Pele initiative was developed to draw employees’ attention 
to the importance of enhancing the quality and accessibility of government services 
by improving efficiency and accountability.

4
Quality in the Office
Batho Pele’s service delivery principles include:
 
regular consultation with customers;
 
setting service standards;
 
increasing access to services;
 
ensuring higher levels of courtesy;
 
providing more and better information about services;
 
increasing openness and transparency about services;
 
remedying failures and mistakes; and
 
giving the best possible value for money (Thompson, 2005).
To address service delivery, an organisation has to invest continuously in staff 
development initiatives, as well as look after the welfare of the human resources to 
ensure that staff buy into the vision and mission of the organisation. Not only that, 
the organisation needs the right people to establish and maintain a quality culture.
The last point from the definition is that of customer satisfaction which refers to 
a certain dimension of quality, namely that a quality product or service is one that 
satisfies the customer. This means you have to get your products and services to the 
level where you succeed in keeping the sales figures up. The management of quality 
is therefore never a process on its own or that takes place in isolation – all aspects 
of the organisation must be managed in such a way that standards are achieved 
and exceeded, hence the concept of TQM.
We referred to a quality culture earlier on. The definition of TQM adopted by 
Steenkamp (2001) strongly refers to this aspect of quality management. Steenkamp 
sees TQM as a way of life, a passion, something that everybody should do – a 
culture which should be lived by everybody in an institution – and as something 
that should be modelled by those in positions of leadership. However, he points out 
that the responsibility for quality should eventually become a matter of personal 
leadership and be practised by all members in the institution. This view of TQM 
demonstrates some of the philosophical aspects of quality management. Oakland 
(2000) adds to this by describing TQM as a philosophy – a way of thinking and 
working that is concerned with meeting the needs and expectations of customers. 
According to Pycraft, Singh and Phihlela (2000), TQM as a philosophy applies to 
all parts, departments and sections of the institution and is the responsibility of 
all people in an organisation. You will once again note the reference to customer 
satisfaction, the sum of the parts and the fact that quality management can only 
be successful if everybody in the organisation adopts quality in whatever they do, 
no matter how small or indirect their contribution to the business results may be.
In addition, Dale (2003) refers to the development of quality and its management, 
which he says has moved through three phases. In phase one the emphasis was very 
much on the quality of the product, mostly managed by inspection. In phase two 
the emphasis was on the quality of the institution, managed by quality control 
and quality assurance. In phase three the emphasis shifted to quality of life, 
Quality in the Office for IT Professionals

5
Quality office management
encompassing a wide scope of elements, hence the reference to TQM. You will 
remember that we referred to quality of life in the introduction to this chapter. The 
most important issue to note from this model is the changing paradigm of quality 
and with it the way in which it is measured, implemented or observed and finally 
adopted as an approach to the organisation in its totality. The shift is also away 
from inspection (which is almost reminiscent of policing) to quality control and 
quality assurance.
In contrast to inspection, in which an external person or body measures 
performance against standards, the object of quality assurance is to identify areas 
of improvement which organisations are able to assess themselves and where 
they can continually recommend improvements of their own accord. In other 
words, organisations do not improve quality because they have to be ready for 
an inspection. They improve quality because they believe it is important to have 
quality products and services.Dean and Bowen (1994) discuss TQM as one of the 
management processes. They say that it is the emphasis on continuous improvement 
that differentiates TQM as a management process from the other management 
processes. Continuous improvement refers to the continuous improvement of 
individuals, groups and institutions. To improve performance, people need to know 
what to do and how to do it, have the right tools to do it, be able to measure 
performance and to receive feedback on current levels of achievement.
This refers strongly to the involvement of human resources in TQM, effectively 
saying that you can only improve performance if you equip your staff. Staff must 
not be uncertain of what is expected of them, they must be equipped in terms 
of tools, they must be involved in the measurement of performance and you 
have to give them feedback on their performance. If an organisation wants to 
encourage performance and excellence, both of which are components of TQM, 
the management can literally not afford to keep their human resources uninformed 
and uninvolved in any of the stages of product development, and improvement of 
service levels.
Oschman, Ströh and Auriacombe (2006) explain that quality management 
evolved from quality control and mention that quality assurance (QA) widened the 
responsibility for quality to include functions other than direct operations of an 
institution. We referred to this earlier. The authors mention a number of principles 
of TQM that almost form a ‘package deal’, meaning that all the principles should 
continuously be applied for TQM to be an effective management tool.
Wilkinson and Witcher (1993) and Nwabueze (2001) add to this point by 
summarising TQM as adhering to three major requirements, namely:
 
Total: participation of everyone, meaning it is an institution-wide process;
 
Quality: meeting customer requirements exactly; and
 
Management: enabling conditions for total quality.

6
Quality in the Office
A number of countries have developed TQM models that include certain principles 
according to which quality is managed. In South Africa the SAEF developed a 
model which has been adopted by a number of organisations. The SAEF model 
for the management of quality of the entire organisation is illustrated in Table 1.1 
and consists of the criteria being either enablers or results. Certain criteria are 
considered as the factors that will create an enabling environment for certain 
business results emanating from the application of the enablers.

Quality office management
1.3 Administrative policies and procedures management
So far we have referred extensively to the importance of involving all the aspects 
of the organisation in the management of quality. Every functional area of the 
organisation has to take responsibility for high levels of quality and this also 
applies to administrative policies and procedures. In fact, it is only by having well-
designed administrative policies and procedures in place that the administrative 
manager will be able to create a stable administrative environment and exercise 
the kind of leadership we spoke about earlier. The management of policies and 
procedures refers to the functions concerning the making, implementation 
and evaluation of executive decisions (Kroukamp, 2007). In other words, the 
management of administrative policies and procedures refers to the decisions to be 
made, implemented and evaluated in terms of the policies and procedures governing 
sound administration.Examples of administrative policies in the organisation are 
the policies on the use of the telephone for external calls, photocopying equipment, 
the use of the Internet and email or the format and layout of documentation to 
maintain a standardised corporate appearance. Some examples of administrative 
procedures are those procedures we normally find in the procedures manual of an 
organisation on how to access information, sign out files from the central filing 
management division or deal with incoming and outgoing mail and telephone calls.
For everybody to adopt a uniform approach and standardised norms and 
establish a quality culture, it is important that every person in the organisation 
adheres to the administrative policies and procedures. Standardised and accepted 
group norms are a crucial element of TQM. If you refer back to the SAEF model, 
you will see that the manner in which an organisation manages its information 
is one of the criteria for assessment when evaluators determine how well your 
organisation is doing in terms of TQM. The most important fact to acknowledge 
here is that the administrative manager will not be able to manage administrative 
quality without the necessary policies and procedures. In other words, decisions 
that the administrative manager will have to make in terms of staff who abuse the 
privilege of having access to a telephone of the organisation, will be guided by the 
administrative policy.
Performance of staff in terms of this area can and should only be measured 
against policy and it is important that policy issues are communicated clearly to 
staff. The reason for this is that staff cannot be expected to conform if they are 
not clear on what is expected of them or, alternatively, what they are and are not 
allowed to do.
A good example of administrative policy is the presence of at least one staff 
member in a shared office during lunch time. If a high service level is of importance 
to the organisation, which it should be if the organisation subscribes to the TQM 
philosophy, staff should rotate to make sure there is always a member of the 
administration department available to field calls and enquiries. It is important 

8
Quality in the Office
that staff understand the contribution of this aspect to the management of the 
quality of the entire organisation. Another good example of administrative policy 
is the manner in which petty cash is dealt with. Many organisations keep access 
to a petty cash box at a certain point and the policy and procedures to deal with 
the petty cash box should be clearly outlined. Violation of policy can only be 
determined if the policy is well defined and documented.
Many organisations make use of a quality management system (QMS) to ensure 
that all aspects of managing the quality in the organisation are covered. The QMS 
consists of the entire set of organisational policies and procedures and indicates the 
documentation and instruments to use to implement the policies and procedures. In 
spite of the presence of such a document, we still find gaps in many administrative 
areas and this makes it necessary for the administrative manager to become what is 
referred to as a ‘systems thinker’. It is vital that the administrative manager applies 
the systems and process approach to the management of administrative procedures 
and processes in order to identify gaps in policy and procedures. The administrative 
manager must develop the ability to see the parts of the total process as well 
as the sum total of the combined processes. If this ability can be developed, the 
administrative manager will achieve synergy between the administrative processes 
and the other organisational processes and will also be able to isolate processes 
from each other, focus on and improve individual processes and ‘put them back’ 
into the bigger system.
1.4 Systems and processes in quality administrative management
The establishment of effective administrative systems and processes is almost as 
important as the management of administrative policies and procedures – you 
cannot separate the two. Policies provide a decision-making frame of reference, 
and procedures are the steps to be followed to ensure correct implementation of 
policies. Systems and processes are the mechanisms that are in place to ensure that 
procedures are executed in such a way that every organisational function adheres 
to the policy in totality, which is the embodiment of the vision and mission of the 
organisation. Examples of administrative systems are, for instance, the financial 
management system, the system according to which the human resource records 
are maintained, the administrative system for the marketing function and, of 
course, the information management and database systems as well as the records 
and document management systems.
The policy will determine for how long certain records need to be kept. Procedures 
will describe how staff should manage the records to ensure the integrity of the 
records and effective systems must be in place. In each of these systems there are 
certain processes in place to ensure procedures are followed, which in turn feeds 
into policy and eventually into the vision and mission. The size and nature of the 
activities of the organisation will determine whether the administrative systems, 
Quality in the Office for IT Professionals

9
Quality office management
for example the marketing function or the human resources management function, 
are centralised or decentralised. If these systems are centralised, the administrative 
manager will be responsible for the management of the quality of these systems and 
processes. If the systems are decentralised, it means that each functional manager 
has to manage the quality of these systems. It does not matter in which way the 
organisation operates: the philosophy of TQM requires that no matter where the 
systems and processes are located, the quality must be managed. That means the 
systems and processes must continuously be assessed for effectiveness, fitness 
for purpose, cost-effectiveness, and the contribution of the system and processes 
toward the achievement of goals so that areas for improvement can be determined 
and addressed.
Peter Senge became known for his work on the ‘Fifth Discipline’. He outlines 
eleven laws of what he calls the Fifth Discipline and says that ‘Sometimes, the 
knottiest dilemmas, when seen from the systems point of view, aren’t dilemmas 
at all. They are artefacts of “snapshot” rather than “process” thinking’ (Senge, 
2006:65). What Senge is saying here is that we sometimes perceive something as 
a problem because we see processes in isolation, rather than in relation to each 
other or as parts of the whole system. This statement of Senge, when applied to 
administrative management, can help the administrative manager to identify, for 
example, an ineffective process in his/her records or forms management system. 
Instead of focusing on the particular process itself, the entire records management 
or forms management system should be investigated. Senge (2006) continues by 
pointing out that it is important to understand how basic improvements in work 
processes can eliminate reworking, eliminate quality inspectors, reduce customer 
complaints, lower warranty costs and increase customer loyalty. This means that 
problems arising in the administrative systems and processes should always be 
addressed in relation to each other because each system and process has an impact 
upon each other. It is therefore important for quality management in administration 
that the administrative manager adopts a systems and proc ess thinking approach 
to administrative management to assure that quality is maintained.
1.5 Systems and process thinking as an approach to quality administrative     
      management
We have now studied quality management and TQM. We have seen how the 
administrative manager will manage administrative policies and procedures to enable 
TQM and we also looked at the management of systems and processes as enablers 
of quality administrative management. We saw the value of applying the principles 
of business process engineering and Batho Pele in administrative management to 
achieve TQM. Systems thinking is a strategy implemented in a number of fields 
to study processes and the improvement thereof. Systems thinking is applied 
particularly successfully in information science, which is primarily concerned with 

10
Quality in the Office
the collection, classification, manipulation, storage, retrieval and dissemination of 
information. Information science also studies the application and use of knowledge 
in organisations and the interaction between people, organisations and information 
systems. Rouse (2005) adds that systems thinking is a holistic approach to analysis, 
focusing on how a system’s contingent parts interrelate as well as how systems 
work. The significance of this statement for this chapter is the reference to the role 
that systems thinking plays in information science since information science and 
information management form such an important part of effective administrative 
management. Rouse mentions further that systems thinking originated in 1956 
when Professor Jay Forrester founded the Systems Dynamic Group at the United 
States of America Massachusetts School of Management (MIT). The general systems 
theory (GST), however, is the brainchild of Karl Ludwig von Bertalanffy, who was 
born in Vienna, Austria in 1901 and died in New York in 1972. 
1.5.1 The administrative manager as a systems thinker
Throughout our discussion, the important role that systems play in TQM was noted 
and we therefore now continue our discussion by focusing on the importance of 
the ability of the administrative manager to be a systems thinker. We referred to the 
work done by Peter Senge, which is probably most noteworthy when it comes to a 
discussion of systems thinking. Systems thinking is the conceptual cornerstone – 
also called the fifth discipline – of Peter Senge’s approach.
Systems thinking as a fifth discipline
Systems thinking is the discipline that integrates the other four disciplines, namely 
personal mastery, mental models, building a shared vision and team learning, 
into a coherent body of theory and practice (Senge, 2006). These five disciplines, 
according to Senge, are the requirements for an organisation to become a learning 
organisation. A discipline is viewed by Peter Senge as a series of principles and 
practices that we study, master and integrate into our lives.
His five disciplines can be approached at one of three levels (Senge, 2006):
1. Practices – what you do;
2. Principles – the ideas and insights that guide you; and
3. Essences – the state of having high levels of mastery in the discipline.
Systems theory has the ability to comprehend and address the whole, and 
to examine the interrelationship between the parts. It is therefore vital for the 
administrative manager to be a systems thinker so that he/she is able to understand 
the organisation as a whole and thereby understand how administrative policies, 
procedures, systems and processes relate to the other parts of the organisation.
Another definition of systems thinking is that it is a mindset for understanding 
Quality in the Office for IT Professionals

11
Quality office management
how things work. It is a perspective for going beyond events, to looking for 
patterns of behaviour, to seeking underlying systemic interrelationships which 
are responsible for the patterns of behaviour and the events. Systems thinking 
embodies a world-view that implies that the foundation for understanding lies in 
interpreting interrelationships within systems which are responsible for the manner 
in which systems operate.
If a system is an entity that maintains its existence through the mutual interaction 
of its parts, it is perfectly understandable that the organisation as a system functions 
through the mutual interaction of the policies, procedures, systems and processes 
of the various divisions sustained by the approach of TQM adopted in each of 
its divisions. It is systems thinking that makes it possible for the administrative 
manager to view the role of quality administrative policies, procedures, systems 
and processes in the maintenance of quality of the whole organisation. Thompson 
(2005) quite rightfully says, ‘managers “work on” the systems while people “work in” 
the systems. The way to improve the systems is for those working on the systems to 
listen to feedback from those working in the systems’. He continues by attributing 
the success of quality management systems to effective leadership. ‘Leaders are 
responsible for creating a culture for quality. Aside from visible actions, they are 
responsible for making sure that employees’ work is interesting. The organisation’s 
quality of work-life is an important responsibility of managerial and administrative 
leaders.’ (Thompson, 2005:170)
1.6 Business process engineering and quality administrative management
Looking at the discussion so far, one can understand why it is said that quality 
management relates strongly to what is known as business process engineering 
(BPE) or business process re-engineering (BPR), which is a management approach 
to improving processes by making them more efficient and effective. According 
to Johansson et al (1993), BPR is a ‘relative’ of other process-oriented views such 
as TQM. The aim, however, of BPR is radical change rather than mere continuous 
improvement. The motivation behind this is to escalate the efforts of TQM to 
make the orientation to processes a strategic tool and a core competence of the 
organisation. In other words, BPR takes TQM a step further and highlights that 
the success of the organisation will depend on its focus on processes as a core 
competency for strategic purposes. This means that the organisation will focus on 
its processes to improve its competitive advantage and this takes us back to what 
we have mentioned in terms of the aim of TQM being the improvement of business 
results.
Cooper (1995) discusses the field of BPR at length and says that re-engineering 
is the fundamental rethinking and radical redesign of business processes to achieve 
dramatic improvements in critical, contemporary measures of performance, such 
as cost, quality, service and speed. Note the reference to the performance issues, 

12
Quality in the Office
namely cost, quality and service, which we have raised a number of times in this 
chapter. Other views are that BPR is about changing anything which obstructs 
improving business performance. It is therefore worthwhile to investigate to what 
extent the functions of BPR can be applied to increase the quality of administrative 
management practices.
The reason for this is that the relationship between BPR and TQM strongly 
relates to administrative management practices, since the essential nature of 
administrative management is the effective management of processes to ensure the 
smooth running of the administrative function. Earlier we referred to the role of 
the administrative function in the organisation in terms of reporting in its widest 
sense, with a focus on the management information system and its coverage of the 
entire network of records of the organisation, providing information for general 
management purposes. Due to the importance of this, we addressed the whole issue 
of information systems that have the theory of systems at their core. If you study 
the field of BPR, you will see a close resemblance between the aim of these tools 
and the aims of applying BPR to organisational processes. From these discussions 
we see that the systemic nature of administrative management positions it well 
for the application of BPR to enhance the quality of administrative management 
practices.
We return to Cooper (1995), who refers to McKinsey’s seven Ss model, which 
can be used as a framework to assess the impact of BPR on the organisation. The 
seven Ss refer to the following six elements of the organisation: strategy, structure, 
systems, staff, style and skills, all in relation to the central element, shared values 
or culture. We have discussed all of these elements so far, so this model is simply 
another illustration of the importance of addressing factors in their totality when 
wanting to manage organisational quality and implement continuous improvement.
Systems can be defined as the processes, methods, procedures, rules, techniques, 
technology, manuals, etc, that ensure that work is undertaken efficiently and 
accurately. These are the instructions that guide staff and management in their 
daily tasks. Note again the applicability of these BPR concepts to the practices of 
the administrative manager.
1.7 Summary
In this chapter, we focused on the quality management aspect of administrative 
management. A number of issues are key to the discussion, such as the importance 
of managing the quality of the entire organisation by addressing the quality of 
each of the various entities. For the purpose of this text, the most important entity 
is the quality of administrative management. Quality administrative management 
strongly leans on good management practices by means of administrative policies, 
procedures, systems and processes – hence the discussion of TQM.

13
Quality office management
Flowing from this discussion we noted the importance of the systems and process 
approach of the administrative manager to the management of the administrative 
function. We looked at the role that a quality model and a quality management 
system can play in the overall management of quality in the entire organisation, 
but, more specifically, in administrative management. We looked at the service 
delivery character of quality administrative management and the importance of 
establishing a quality culture in the organisation, especially in the administrative 
function. Finally, we focused on business process engineering that could very 
effectively be applied to the management of quality in administrative management.

The role of information systems
Learning outcomes
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to: 
 
identify and describe the components of the information systems triangle;
 
briefly explain the ‘islands’ problem and its implication for administrative 
professionals when fulfilling their duties in the office;
 
discuss the ways in which the security of information systems can be compromised 
in the office; and
 
describe how electronic commerce and electronic business are changing the way the 
traditional office operates.
2.1 Introduction
This chapter should help you to demonstrate the ability to identify the components 
of the information systems triangle and the problems that may arise in the office, 
and to evaluate an information system by identifying the ways in which security 
can be compromised in the office.
The chapter seeks to explain how administrative professionals can play an 
integral part in the interaction and management of the information systems within 
their immediate department or office, and ultimately the organisation as a whole. 
The role that administrative professionals might play in any given department, or 
the organisation, is largely dependent on the organisational structures currently 
in place. The administrative professional can thus be recognised as an individual 
who might find him/herself in any number of roles, which might include the role 
of manager, middle manager, project leader, planner or administrative officer. It is 
therefore not surprising that administrative professionals need to possess a variety 
of skills such as: communication skills (be able to present themselves well on 
paper and in person), computer literacy skills, information literacy skills (have an 
understanding of how to find, interpret and use information for maximum benefit), 
problem-solving skills and project management skills. These skills combined are 
necessary because the foremost tasks of administrative professionals might be their 
involvement in the analysis, selection, acquisition and installation of information 
systems within and between departments. Technology use in the workplace is 
changing as we find new ways to use technology in order to work smarter. This 
means that those fulfilling administrative functions, whether in the private or 

16
Quality in the Office
public sector, need to be conscious of the benefits that technology can offer. To 
explain the various information systems concepts better, this chapter will examine 
them in the context of the banking sector.
In this chapter, we look at the information systems triangle, information systems 
security and information systems and the Internet.
2.2 The information systems triangle
The South African banking industry has developed in leaps and bounds since the 
early 1990s, in large part due to its adoption of increasingly sophisticated levels 
of technology. The commercialisation of the Internet in 1995 eventually led to the 
creation of opportunities to offer additional services to banking customers. The 
recent penetration of mobile devices (such as smartphones and tablets) has seen 
many new ways for bank customers to interact with each other and their respective 
banks through a variety of applications (apps). The penetration of emerging 
technologies in the banking sector means that many tasks that were once manual 
and time-consuming can now be automated. In some cases, tasks that were already 
automated have been made more efficient and effective. Additionally, banks are 
able to offer other services, as they have realised new opportunities by automating 
certain processes.
The banking industry traditionally employs a vast number of administrative 
personnel who on a day-to-day basis need to ensure that the operations of the bank 
and related activities are done efficiently to deliver good customer service. However, 
administrative personnel are not only to be found in the banking industry, but in 
many different private and public settings worldwide. No matter what the setting, 
the administrative function is concerned with providing the necessary information 
and services to ensure the effective management of any given department or 
organisation. This is achieved by working hand in hand with others (individuals/
departments) to collect, analyse, present and manage the information on which 
informed business decisions need to be made. Subsequently, it can be said that one 
of the goals of the administrative function involves leading and directing people 
to attain the objectives of the organisation through the effective and efficient use 
of information systems.
Rainer and Watson (2012) describe the goal of an information system as 
collecting, processing, storing, analysing and disseminating information for a 
specific purpose. They go on to say that ‘a computer-based information system 
(CBIS) is an information system that uses computer technology to perform 
some or all of the intended tasks’ (Rainer & Watson, 2012:14). However, Shelly, 
Cashman and Rosenblatt (2008) state that when considering information systems, 
we cannot isolate computer technology, since there are a number of components, 
namely hardware, software, data, processes and people, all of which need to work 
together to accomplish the goal of the CBIS. O’Brien and Marakas (2008) suggest 
Quality in the Office for IT Professionals

17
The role of information systems
that when considering CBIS, we must not forget to include another component, 
namely communication channels or networks. Laudon and Laudon (2006) 
previously simplified these six components by grouping them into organisation, 
people and technology. The subsequent sections will deal more closely with the 
different components of the information systems triangle within the context of 
the department or office, by discussing the interrelatedness of organisations, 
technology and people. Thereafter, this chapter briefly considers issues surrounding 
information security and electronic commerce as they apply to information 
systems. Information systems have become increasingly important due to an 
increasing drive to convert them from manual to automated. This involves working 
towards moving away from paper-based record-keeping to finding innovative 
ways to record information electronically. Examples where this move will have 
great benefits are in the area of patient and citizen records. Automating these two 
areas will allow access to electronic patient records anywhere and anytime, and the 
easy identification and management of the details of citizens. Some hospitals are 
already using electronic medical records. The Department of Home Affairs recently 
announced that the South African green identity book will be replaced with a smart 
card. Another important change in the way that organisations manage and share 
information has been due to the impact of the Internet as a source of connectivity 
and commerce.
Prior to 1995, the Internet was for the most part the domain of universities, 
research centres and the United States military. Organisations were at that time 
communicating via private networks such as value-added networks (VANs) 
and electronic data interchange (EDI), but these systems were, and in some 
cases still are, very difficult to maintain and operate. The Internet simplified 
communication between business partners, but its impact was far greater. The real 
value of the Internet to many organisations was the realisation that they could 
create their own version of the Internet within their own companies, and thus 
the intranet was born. An intranet is simply the connection of large volumes of 
data stored across various media throughout an organisation, so that authorised 
employees, customers and suppliers can easily access it. However, the simplicity 
of information access and retrieval is often compromised by problems that may 
arise. One common problem that an information specialist could encounter in an 
organisation is called the ‘islands’ problem. It occurs when there are difficulties in 
making information available to users in a timely manner (ie the right information 
at the right time), so that they can make an informed decision. There are two 
types of ‘islands’ problems, namely the ‘islands of information’ and ‘islands of 
automation’ problem.
The ‘islands of information’ problem arises due to the departmentalisation 
of organisations. These ‘islands of information’ occur when two or more 
departments may have similar information stored, and duplication occurs, 

18
Quality in the Office
which makes updating all the records with the same changes difficult. This often 
leads to the ‘yours’ and ‘ours’ mentality, which encourages some administrative 
personnel in a given department to withhold information that may be crucial for 
the operation of another department. Identifying and integrating these isolated 
pockets of information into the business processes of the organisation is often a 
difficult task, and the unwillingness to accept change can be a strong motivator 
to withhold information. Ironically, the goal of the information system should 
be to make the business processes flow more smoothly, so that the organisation 
operates more efficiently.
The ‘islands of automation’ problem arises from a lack of integration of 
information systems between various hardware platforms, which impedes the 
sharing of information. This occurs when one department’s information systems do 
not, or cannot, communicate with another’s due to the lack of similar technologies. 
It may also occur where a user brings a device such as a tablet or smartphone to 
the office to connect to the information system, and there are compatibility issues 
between the devices.
Organisations need to put strong policies and procedures in place to govern 
users in departments in order to ensure that ‘islands’ do not occur, or if they 
do, that there are still ways to ensure the effective and efficient integration of 
information systems for shared information usage in the future. These policies and 
procedures can also assist in managing potential security problems in future. It is 
with effective and efficient information usage in mind that organisations attempt 
to manage their information systems in such a way that they strike a balance 
between the organisational, the technological and the human needs associated with 
the information requirements of various business processes. How these needs are 
realised will greatly impact on the manner in which administrative professionals 
execute their duties within a given process.
The main components of the information systems triangle – organisations, 
technology and people – will now be covered in more detail.

2.2.1 Organisations
By their very nature, organisations are quite diverse, even within a given industry. 
For example, although there are a number of banks in South Africa, they offer 
different experiences to the customer interacting with them. It is true that there will 
be some functions that are the same, but the way in which business processes occur 
and data are managed may be very different.
Business processes
A business process can be defined as the predefined activities and operations that 
an organisation carries out to complete a specific task. For example, the depositing 
of cash by a customer at a bank would probably be termed the deposit process. 
However, the interaction of the customer with the bank is not only limited to the 
deposit process, but could include the home loan process, the student loan process, 
and the new account process, to name but a few. Each one of these processes 
involves organising, analysing and manipulating data. Improving a business process

involves examining where problems could occur and finding ways to prevent and 
eliminate such problems. Haag, Baltzan and Phillips (2008) state that business 
processes are not department specific, but cut across a number of departments. It is 
here that our ‘islands of information’ become a potential problem again, and it is 
best to consider the role of data within the organisation.
Data
A simple definition of data is that it is a collection of raw facts in isolation. Coronel, 
Morris, Rob and Crockett (2013) state the following key points relevant to data:
 
data constitute the building blocks of information;
 
information is produced by processing data;
 
information is used to reveal the meaning of data;
 
accurate, relevant and timely information is the key to good decision-making; and
 
good decision-making is the key to organisational survival in the global 
environment.
The average owner of an information system is not interested in raw facts, but 
rather in the ‘things’ that data describe, and the information that arises from these 
descriptions. These ‘things’ are called business resources or entities. When dealing 
with the owner of the information system, those changing the information system 
to improve business processes will try to identify the business resources that are 
important to the information system. The typical user of the system, on the other 
hand, views data in more detailed terms. The level of detail that a user associates 
with given data is dependent on the context to which it relates. Remember for data 
to have value, it should be viewed in context. For example, providing a list of the 
deposit and withdrawal amounts of bank customers without telling the reader what 
they are reading will merely appear to be a random list of figures with little value 
or meaning.
The standard depiction of how data are changed into information can be viewed 
in a sequential flow of input, processing and output. The input relates to the data 
which enter the information system via some means, and is normally captured 
from some form of document referred to as a source document; for example, 
an application form to open a bank account. The input can be either manual 
(entered by a user) or automated (entered by another information system). The 
data from a source document, such as an application form, are processed by the 
information system once it has been captured into the system. During processing, 
the data are organised, analysed and manipulated. It is this action that converts 
the data into some form of output and, ultimately, information. The output from 
the system can be represented in a number of ways, for example a document,  
spreadsheet, graphs or output to a web page. It is important to note that due to 
the advance in technology, the input and output may not be printed material, but 
Quality in the Office for IT Professionals

21
The role of information systems
rather electronic in nature. The output from one system can then become the input 
to another system.
Administrative professionals will see the same trend – input, process and 
output – in all the systems with which they interact within the organisation. 
The goal is then for administrative professionals to see their data requirements 
in terms of entities (things), relationships (interactions), attributes (characteristics) 
and rules (procedures). They need to understand how their function fits into the 
organisational ‘puzzle’, and to do this they need to understand the processes or 
activities at play. Organisational and information system activities put the data 
to use, capturing and transforming data into useful information. The view that 
administrative professionals take of these activities will depend on their role in the 
organisation, which is either as the owners or end users of the information system.
The owners of information systems view activities in terms of high-level 
functions provided to the business. Examples include transaction processing, 
management reporting, decision support, simulation of expertise, generation of 
executive information and office automation. Owners view these functions in 
general terms of how well they fulfil business goals and objectives. For example, 
a bank manager may want to know if deposits over the counter are increasing 
or decreasing (using management reporting), and use this information to make 
decisions on the way the bank will operate in future (decision support).The end 
users, on the other hand, view activities in terms of distinct processes with specific 
inputs, outputs, data files, business policies and procedures that must be executed. 
For example, the bank administrator at the personal loan desk of a bank would 
only be concerned with data required for processing the customer’s personal loan 
application. However, it is important to note that the view of data is differentiated 
in terms of computer files and/or databases.
Files and databases
The information processing diagram includes storage (for example, database 
servers), which is an important aspect of any information system. Storage in 
automated systems plays a vital role, as it allows information to be accessed 
quickly when it is needed. If the information or data on which a decision is to be 
based cannot be found, it may negatively impact on the effective and efficient 
running of the organisation. Ironically, it is not uncommon for data to be stored 
on the local area network (LAN) of an organisation, and then effectively lost. How? 
The owners or users of the data forget where it is located. Knowledge management 
attempts to address this problem and to provide a means of effectively managing 
how knowledge is organised and stored in the organisation, so that retrieval  
is easier.
Traditionally, data were stored in files, but there has been a significant migration 
by organisations towards database storage to try to manage data better. Files are 

22
Quality in the Office
collections of similar records. For example, manual files might include information 
about customers, orders and products. The problems associated with either paper or 
electronic files are directly linked to the ‘islands’ issue mentioned earlier, because 
it is difficult for departments within an organisation to share data when utilising a 
file-orientated system.
The typical problems arising from file-orientated systems are associated with 
data redundancy, data integrity and the rigidity of data structure. Shelly, Cashman 
and Rosenblatt (2008) describe these as follows:
 
Data redundancy refers to data that are common to two or more information 
systems and stored in several places, which results in expenses associated with 
increased storage space and maintenance.
 
Data integrity refers to the problems that occur if updates are not applied to all 
files, because this will mean that the same data will be represented differently 
in files. For example, if an employee of a hotel gets married and changes her 
surname, then her surname may be changed in the payroll file, but not in the 
housekeeping file, so that the records are no longer the same.
 
Rigid data structure refers to the difficulty associated with retrieving information 
for business decision making because of the slow and inefficient access to 
information in a file-orientated system.
Databases attempt to counteract the potential problems of a file-orientated system 
because they are collections of interrelated files. For example, a customer database 
at a bank might contain transaction records that are ‘linked’ to their associated 
customer and account records. A DBMS (database management system, for example 
Microsoft Access or Microsoft SQL Server) is a software application that is used to 
create, maintain and provide controlled access to the organisational data stored 
in the database. Table 2.1 provides a list of the advantages and disadvantages of 
using a DBMS.

Disadvantages
It reduces the occurrence of redundant or 
duplicated data
There may be size considerations associated 
with the space needed to install the DBMS

23
The role of information systems
Standards can be enforced that prescribe 
how data will be captured and stored
There is a higher impact of failure, because 
data are located in one place                    
Security can be applied to ensure that the 
data is not compromised
There may be performance problems 
experienced by end users in accessing the 
same data
It is easier for non-programmers to produce 
databases with limited functionality
Backup, recovery and maintenance are more 
critical in a DBMS environment
Whether an organisation opts for a file-orientated or a database management system, 
it needs to pay greater attention to its vast stores of data. The successful management 
of data has the potential to provide a competitive advantage in business. A data 
warehouse offers an opportunity to store data that can be used for information 
generation in order to make decisions that are either tactical or strategic.
Coronel et al (2013) state that the data warehouse is a useful means of ensuring 
that data are:
 
integrated from a variety of sources (for example, databases) in the organisation;
 
subject-oriented, which means that some form of categorisation is associated 
with the data and that the data become easier to find answers to questions;
 
time-variant, which means that data are associated with a specific point in time; 
the data warehouse is a good way of representing the flow of data over time; and
 
non-volatile, because data should never be deleted from a warehouse but continue 
to grow as more data enter the organisation.
The accumulation and management of data in a data warehouse thus assists in 
providing a holistic view of the data in the organisation, which in turn assists 
in minimising ‘islands of information’. However, to be helpful the data in the 
organisation must have the necessary supporting technology. Technology was 
identified earlier in this chapter as one of the components of the information 
systems triangle, and we will discuss the elements of hardware, software and 
telecommunications with respect to technology.
2.2.2 Technology
The computer and its peripherals continue to evolve at an alarming rate. 
Organisations are often unable to afford new technology and attempt to prop up 
their legacy (old) systems in the hope that they will be able to maintain some level 
of competitiveness. However, not being aware of or not adopting new technology 
can be the death knell for an organisation. Administrative professionals need to 
have a basic understanding of the technological elements of hardware, software and 
telecommunications so that they can ensure that technology is utilised in the most 

24
Quality in the Office
productive manner in the organisation. Manufacturers are increasingly finding 
ways to make hardware and software more user-friendly, with the underlying 
technology hidden from the novice user.
Hardware
The hardware element of technology refers to the physical equipment used for 
the input, processing, output and storage work of the information system. The 
physical equipment in an information system must make use of some form of 
communication language to facilitate interaction. The basic communication 
language that computer devices use is machine language, which takes the form 
of binary code, that is, a collection of 0s and 1s. For example, the letter ‘A’ can be 
represented as: 01000001. Therefore, the letter ‘A’ gets translated into a language 
that the computer can understand as soon as the user presses that letter on the 
keyboard. All of computation happens in under a second, so as a user, we do not 
see a delay between typing a letter on a keyboard and it appearing on a monitor.
An information system has an input, which will be processed into some form of 
output. Storage also plays a role during the processing stage, as it is where the data 
are located. According to O’Brien and Marakas (2008), hardware can be explained 
by relating it to the parts of the information processing diagram as follows:
 
Input: This can include computer keyboards, touch screens, barcode scanners, the 
electronic mouse and a microphone for voice recognition.
 
Processing: The central processing unit (CPU) is the main processing component 
of a computer system. The circuitry of the CPU can be divided into the arithmetic 
logic unit (ALU) and the control unit. The control unit controls the flow of 
information, and the ALU performs the arithmetic calculations on the machine 
language (1s and 0s). The CPU is the control component of the computer system. 
Its circuits interpret software instructions and transmit directions to the other 
components of the computer system.
 
Output: This can include monitors, printers and speakers.
 
Storage: The storage function of a computer system takes place in the storage 
circuits of the computer’s primary storage unit, or memory, supported by 
secondary storage devices such as magnetic disk and optical disk drives. These 
types of devices store data and software instructions needed for processing.
The hardware elements explained above could not logically function on their 
own, because they are an integral part of the information processing system. The 
sophistication of the computer hardware required by an organisation is largely 
determined by the amount of processing power that the organisation needs. Ideally, 
the organisation needs to ensure that it sets up some form of acquisition policy 
to ensure that there is standardisation, and that all hardware meets the needs of 
the user and existing business practices. An organisation with a range of different 
Quality in the Office for IT Professionals

25
The role of information systems
hardware devices would merely perpetuate the ‘islands of automation’ problem, 
because there would be issues associated with the compatibility, expandability and 
reliability of the hardware.
This overview of hardware is intended to give administrative professionals an 
idea of the contribution that hardware makes to the processing of information 
within the organisation. However, another very important element of technology 
that needs to be discussed is software.
Software
Software can simply be defined as those computer programs that control the 
computer’s operations. There is an abundance of different software packages on 
the market, covering a wide range of uses. However, software can be categorised as 
either application software (which allows for specific tasks to be completed by end 
users) or system software (which manages and supports basic computer operations 
of standalone machines and networks).
Commercial (off-the-shelf) and open-source examples are, respectively:
 
General-purpose application programs – Microsoft Office Suite or Open Office;
 
Application-specific programs – Pastel Accounting or TurboCash;
 
System management programs – Microsoft Windows and Novel, or Linux and 
Android; and
 
System development programs – Microsoft Visual Studio or Sun Java.
Computer vendors offer organisations an assortment of hardware and software 
that can be mixed and matched to assist in the management of data. This helps to 
restrict the information that is made available to users, so that it only relates to 
their specific function at work. Some organisations have made use of products such 
as portals or switchboards, which provide users with a single interface through 
which they can complete all their daily tasks. Thus, information specific to the 
user’s task is provided to them, so that they can be more productive in their daily 
work. For example, the clerk at the foreign exchange desk at the bank might be 
able to access live currency rates and country specific information for customers 
wanting to buy foreign exchange for their travels outside South Africa. A given 
portal or switchboard can include the functionality of a variety of information 
systems, although the merging of all data elements can be made complex if the 
‘islands’ problem exists.
We learnt about the various types of organisational information systems 
categories that are in common use today, and that in some instances provide 
the ability to make informed decisions. Their limitation is that they are seldom 
representative of the organisation’s entire computer system, and often do not 
receive the much needed support from the system owners and the end users who 
make use of them. Administrative professionals are increasingly going to encounter 

26
Quality in the Office
complex organisational computer systems in the future, and they will either be 
used as they were intended, or not. The complexity of linking various hardware 
and software should not be taken lightly, but it is made easier by making use 
of different network topologies. The various telecommunications components will 
now be briefly discussed within the context of the ‘islands of automation’ problem, 
in the next section.
Telecommunications
Communication can simply be defined as the transmission of a signal by means of a 
communication channel from a sender to a receiver. The signal contains a message 
consisting of data and information. Telecommunication, on the other hand, refers 
to the electronic transfer of signals to accomplish some form of communication, 
including via telephone, radio and television. Data communication is a subset 
of telecommunications that includes the electronic collection, processing and 
distribution of data – typically between computer hardware devices, with the aid 
of software.
The telecommunications channel or medium refers to anything that carries an 
electronic signal and interfaces between a sending device and a receiving device.
The data in telecommunications can flow in three ways:
1. Simplex: Data can flow in only one direction, for example, radio and television;
2. Half-duplex: Data can flow in both directions, but only in one direction at a 
time, for example, a walkie-talkie; and
3. Full-duplex: Data can flow in both directions at the same time, for example, a 
mobile phone.
The telecommunications medium can be characterised as either physical or wireless 
transmission media. Physical transmission media refer to those telecommunications 
devices that are physically connected to one another with some type of cable. There 
are three common types of physical transmission media found in offices today: 
twisted-pair cables, coaxial cables and fibre-optic cables. Wireless transmission 
media, on the other hand, are those telecommunications devices that transmit the 
signal through the air, from one point to another. They are utilised when it is 
impractical or impossible to install any cabling. Examples include microwaves, 
satellites, radios, cellular, infrared and Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and WiMAX transmissions. 
The adoption of wireless is increasing exponentially with most computers nowadays 
having wireless connectivity as a standard feature. We can now find wireless in 
many public areas such as restaurants, fast-food outlets and airports, and also in 
some CBDs. However, most of these devices are secure and require a subscription 
or pass code to allow access to the given wireless device.
Administrative professionals who are involved in the telecommunications arena 
of the organisation will need to ensure that data flow smoothly across the different 
Quality in the Office for IT Professionals

27
The role of information systems
hardware and software platforms. The communication of data across different 
platforms is made possible by means of networks. A network is a collection of 
computers and devices connected via communication channels that allow users to 
share data, information, software and hardware with others. Networks are thus a 
strong facilitator of communication within an organisation. A local area network 
(LAN) is one type of computer network; a wide area network (WAN) is another. 
The LAN is limited to a small geographical area and consists of a communication 
channel, networked computers and devices, a network interface card (NIC) and 
a network operating system (NOS). A WAN, on the other hand, covers a large 
geographical area by making use of a collection of LANs to create a larger 
network. The Internet is the largest WAN. However, no matter the size, the network 
architecture or topology plays an important role.
We learnt that network topology refers to the configuration of communication 
devices in a network. These are commonly a bus network, a star network and 
a ring network. There are also a number of hybrid network varieties, which 
incorporate different types of networks into larger networks. Most organisations 
these days create intranets out of their hybrid networks. The intranet draws on 
Internet and web technology to function. It is a convenient medium, because any 
relevant information can potentially be accessed via a web browser. Some intranets 
extend beyond the boundaries of the organisation to make information available 
to customers and business partners via some form of secure connection – these are 
then called extranets.
The intranet, if properly used, can result in enhanced efficiency: cost savings, time 
savings and user productivity savings. It may also lead to enhanced effectiveness, 
which encourages the exchange of information across traditional departmental 
boundaries, increased collaboration and flattening of the traditional hierarchical 
structure by creating an interactive organisational structure. Some of the benefits 
listed directly address the ‘islands of information’ problem mentioned earlier, and it 
is proposed that the intranet may be the ‘bridge’ required between information and 
users, which can possibly lessen the ‘islands of automation’ problem. Users in the 
organisation play an important role, especially in the case of the intranet, because 
its success is essentially dependent on users. The intranet will reflect the needs and 
desires of the users. If the users harness and utilise the potential of the intranet, 
it will require increased functionality. However, as mentioned earlier, resistance 
to change will ultimately lead to poor use of the technology and a reduction in 
the capacity for information sharing. Therefore, the people using the intranet will 
choose its structure, the level of internal and external communications, the barriers 
to access and the resources that are required.
Technology, and how data are managed in organisational information systems, 
greatly impacts on the work of people interacting with the organisation. The people 

28
Quality in the Office
element is the final component of the information systems triangle that needs to be 
considered and will be dealt with in the next section.
2.2.3 People
Just as the information systems within an organisation vary, so too do the people 
who make use of such technologies. People can be simply categorised into: 
operational employees, supervisors, team leaders, middle management, knowledge 
workers and top management (Shelly, Cashman & Rosenblatt, 2008:15). Each of 
these different types of people place internal demands on the information systems. 
However, external factors (those originating from outside the organisation) also 
impact on organisational information systems.
Internal factors
The administrative professional of the past was confronted with a rigid hierarchical 
business structure, where the chain of command determined the level of access to 
information, but increasingly the accessibility of information is changing due to the 
uptake of network technology. Thus, end users are empowered and make decisions 
based on attainable and relevant information. This is accomplished for the most 
part through the use of the information systems in an organisation.The success 
of the information systems in an organisation depends largely on the amount of 
support received from middle and top management. If the management of the 
organisation is willing to support projects for the enhancement of the existing 
information systems, these systems will thrive. However, often the power to make 
changes to the existing information systems does not lie with a given departmental 
manager, but with the information technology (IT) department.
In many organisations, the IT department is seen as the gatekeeper of technology, 
and it is important to be aware of the impact this has on the effective and efficient 
operation of the people within the organisation if the information systems either do 
not change as required, or change without prior notification. For example, the user 
may walk into the office one day and find that the settings on their workstation 
have been changed by the IT Department using a remote update. This raises the 
issue of suitable training, which needs to be provided to all users prior to the 
introduction of or at the same time as the change, so that they know how to use 
the new or revised system. The importance of user involvement when changing 
information systems cannot be stressed enough, because this increases the rate of 
successful adoption.
External factors
New technology is being created as you read this chapter and will continue to 
be created long after you have put this book down. This explosion of technology 
Quality in the Office for IT Professionals

29
The role of information systems
places great demands on the organisation as it needs to ensure that it keeps up 
to date with technological changes. At the same time, though, organisations 
must be careful not to change technology so drastically that it affects business 
processes negatively and encourages the ‘islands of automation’ problem. As new 
technologies emerge, internal users place ever greater pressure on the organisation 
to adopt the new technologies. However, it is the suppliers, business partners and 
customers who ultimately make the greatest demands, because they demand better 
service and the monitoring of the flow of products.
Organisations are finding that they increasingly need to compete with 
competitors to keep their existing customers. A good customer relationship 
management (CRM) system can assist them. CRM has become more automated 
as technology has evolved. This has resulted in a growing need to automate the 
entire customer experience with the organisation, so that it is possible for all data 
regarding the interaction between the two to be recorded. However, as we noted 
earlier, the ‘islands’ problem may be a hindrance to an integrated information 
system, if changes are not done in a logical and systematic manner.
Governmental rules and regulations with respect to good governance 
requirements for organisations will also impact on how people perform their jobs, 
as these requirements will need to be integrated into existing or future information 
systems. It is not uncommon for large multinationals to have information systems 
that differ from one geographical region to the next in order to accommodate 
local cultures and regulations. The effective integration of all the components of 
the information systems triangle is vital for organisational success. It is therefore 
necessary for organisations to determine regularly what problems may arise with 
respect to their information systems, and to act on them accordingly. Administrative 
professionals in the organisation need to be in a position to provide input when 
resolving a problem, as a good requirement elicitation process is critical in the 
development of information systems solutions.
In the chapter thus far we have attempted to identify how the different elements 
of the information systems triangle relate to the ‘islands of information’ and ‘islands 
of automation’ problems. Solving the ‘islands’ problem is not easy. There are 
many factors that may have a bearing on the way organisations, technology and 
people are viewed. The security of information systems is an important functional 
constraint that cannot be overlooked, and therefore we will consider the issues of 
security and its impact on the information systems within the office.
2.3 Information systems security
Computers are used productively on a daily basis to gain access to valuable 
information within the organisation, and yet at the same time can be used to 
steal vast amounts of money (Stair & Reynolds, 2012). Many organisations are 
not willing to report computer crimes because of the threat of losing potential 

30
Quality in the Office
customers, suppliers or business partners who will think that their data may not be 
secure. For example, a bank that reports the loss of huge sums of money resulting 
from illegal access to its information system is likely to see a number of clients 
move to other financial institutions because they will consider that bank’s ability 
to keep their money safe unsatisfactory.
The Internet adds another level of complexity, because it means that computer 
crime is no longer limited to the users entering the office and physically using the 
organisation’s information system to commit a crime, but that information systems 
can now be potentially accessed from anywhere in the world. This raises concerns 
for those organisations wishing to take their business online, because they need to 
ensure that their internal operations cannot be compromised.
According to Stair and Reynolds (2012), the computer can be the tool that 
is used to commit the crime or the object of the crime itself. Administrative 
professionals and other individuals in the organisation need to guard against the 
computer becoming the object of crime. Stair and Reynolds (2012) have identified 
the following instances:
 
Illegal access and use: people such as criminal hackers or crackers gain access to 
computers, which they use to commit a crime or for some other purpose.
 
Data alteration and deletion: malicious computer programs, such as viruses and 
worms, target information systems and may cause the loss of data or critical 
systems.
 
Spyware: involves loading software on a computer that will allow the criminal 
to intercept and/or take control of the computer without the user knowing that 
it is happening.
 
Information and equipment theft: an individual illegally accesses an information 
system with the intention of stealing data and information; equipment theft is 
made easier by the portability of computer devices, especially laptops.
 
Safe disposal of personal computers: old computers that a company wants to 
donate or throw away should be wiped clean of any software or information that 
may give a criminal access to a company’s network.
 
Patent and copyright violations: the illegal duplication of software either for 
personal use or distribution for profit is commonly referred to as software piracy 
− the illegal use of the Internet to download software that someone else has paid 
for is also a serious violation.
 
Computer-related scams: the numerous get-rich-quick scams sent via email in 
which you are asked for your banking details in order to receive a deposit of 
money − you need to ask yourself one simple question: ‘If it is so easy to make 
money, then why is everyone not rich?’
 
International computer crime: the stealing of large volumes of hardware by crime 
syndicates and using computers to commit cyber-terrorism using computers to 
disrupt electricity, water and air traffic control.
Quality in the Office for IT Professionals

31
The role of information systems
Many organisations develop procedures to maintain tight security and to protect 
the privacy of their users’ data, and that of the organisation as a whole. However, 
the ‘islands’ problem does not make this task any easier, because organisations need 
to be aware of all the possible points of entry into their systems and where data 
are stored. Each point of entry is a potential breach point. One technique to use 
in securing organisational data is to use encryption. The word ‘encryption’ comes 
from a Greek word meaning ‘to hide’. Encryption is accomplished by converting 
the data into unreadable data unless you have the code or ‘key’ needed to unlock 
the data so that it makes sense again. It is similar to creating a password to secure 
your workstation in the office and only being able to access that workstation if 
you remember the password. Forgetting a password or losing a ‘key’ could prove to 
be a disaster, because it may not be possible to recover the data initially protected.
Another very common method is to make use of a firewall to protect the 
‘islands of automation’ within the organisation. A firewall is a general term for 
both hardware and software that is used to restrict access to data and information 
in a network. The firewall acts as a protective shield between the outside world and 
the organisation’s network. The purpose of a firewall, and other security methods, 
is to deny access to outsiders and restrict access to employees who use the system. 
The latter action means, theoretically, that if the system is breached, only data 
that the user has access to will be compromised, although once hackers are in the 
system, they can generally go anywhere. The security aspect is of vital concern to 
organisations, given the fact that computers are becoming an integral part of our 
daily lives. The Internet has had a dramatic impact and the commercialisation of 
the Internet in 1995 was a major turning point. The next section will consider the 
relationship between the systems within an organisation and the Internet.
2.4 Information systems and the Internet
Consumers are putting increased pressure on many organisations to take their 
businesses online. Already banks and many other service industries offer the ability 
to do transactions over the Internet. Effectively, when you make use of the Internet 
for transactions, you are accessing the information system of an organisation. 
For example, a bank customer no longer needs to go to a physical bank, as he/
she can access most of the services via the Internet or a mobile device. The bank’s 
customer is effectively connecting to the bank’s information system in order to do 
the transaction. The various security measures put in place, such as login details 
and one-time-pins (OTPs), provide a way to help protect customer transactions.
The definitions of electronic commerce (also referred to as e-commerce, or 
eCommerce) and electronic business (also referred to as e-business, or eBusiness) are 
often considered to be the same. However, it is possible to identify the uniqueness 
of each. Although, e-commerce is often considered as falling under e-business, 

32
Quality in the Office
which is evident from the definitions that follow. A definition of mobile commerce 
(m-commerce) is also provided, as the use of mobile devices is on the increase.
 
Electronic commerce ‘describes the process of buying, selling, transferring or 
exchanging products, services, or information via computer networks, including 
the Internet’ (Rainer & Watson, 2012:316).
 
Electronic business is ‘a broader definition of e-commerce that involves not just 
buying and selling, but also servicing customers, collaborating with business 
partners, and conducting electronic transactions within an organisation’ (Rainer 
& Watson, 2012:316).
 
Mobile commerce ‘is the use of mobile, wireless devices to place orders and 
conduct business’ (Stair & Reynolds, 2012:17).
Administrative professionals will increasingly find that their duties include dealing 
with elements that are part of e-business. These activities are not commerce 
activities but business activities, because no monetary value is typically exchanged. 
Maintaining the organisational customer base in a globalised world necessitates 
having information stored in the organisational information systems available 
for consumers and business partners as and when it is required. Increasing the 
accessibility to information systems by establishing some form of electronic link 
between business partners is not a new phenomenon. For many years, organisations 
have been making use of electronic data interchange (EDI) to achieve this goal. 
EDI is the utilisation of network systems to allow the output from one system 
to be processed directly, without human intervention, as input to other systems 
along agreed standards and procedures between the business partners. The major 
drawback with EDI is that it is costly and time-consuming to implement. These 
problems tend to ‘bind’ the business partners to the relationship.
The Internet offers additional capabilities for EDI-based systems through the 
use of Internet portals where buyers and sellers can interact. One of the greatest 
advantages is that suppliers can compete in an open platform for the buyers’ 
business. Naturally, the benefit to both parties is that once an agreement is struck, 
the basic infrastructure (the Internet) is already in place. The parties concerned 
therefore already have a network that they can use to link the individual information 
systems to each other.
E-business is more than just the technology, because it is a specific way of 
doing business. Many of the dot-com crashes of 2000 were caused by businesses 
that thought that merely adopting Internet technology would make their business 
successful. The truth of the matter is that implementing full-scale, innovative 
applications of e-commerce requires management teams to view the marketplace 
beyond the typical physical boundaries. They need to ‘think outside the box’. 
Those businesses that place e-commerce in the correct context and align it to the 
business’s overall strategy will see the e-commerce application succeed. Therefore, 
Quality in the Office for IT Professionals

33
The role of information systems
organisational information systems and e-commerce initiatives cannot be divorced 
from each other, but must be married for success. The centre of this ‘marriage’ is the 
customer, because e-commerce is fundamentally customer-centred.
2.5 Summary
Administrative professionals will increasingly find their role in the information 
systems environment challenging. Most information systems are dynamic and, as 
such, the level of interaction with respect to organisations, technology and people 
will always have a potential for problems. The ‘islands of information’ and the 
‘islands of automation’ problems will greatly add to the complexity of working 
in an environment where advances in technology influence the way in which 
administrative professionals carry out their duties on a daily basis. There is no hard 
and fast rule of how to solve the ‘islands’ problem, because no two organisations 
or the people that work in them are the same. However, being aware that problems 
can occur, and being accepting of change, will reduce some of the negativity.
The importance of securing information systems against potential threats 
means that administrative professionals will have to be vigilant in carrying out 
their duties to ensure that potential abuse of information systems does not occur, 
or if it does, that it is quickly identified and resolved. Finally, electronic commerce 
and electronic business are making use of recent advances in technology, which 
means that administrative professionals need to have a basic understanding of how 
these technologies work, and be open to learning new technologies associated with 
information systems.

3.1 Introduction
We live in an era where the use of computers and technology are unavoidable. 
Children from as young as four years of age are capable of playing basic games 
on cell phones and tablets; they can operate handheld consoles to play interactive 
games and know where to switch laptops and desktop computers on and off. 
Computers form an integral part of our work environments, schools and homes. 
Different types and sizes of computers are used for a variety of reasons and in a 
range of places.
While some computers sit on top of a desk (desktops) or on the floor, mobile 
computers and mobile devices are small enough to carry. Mobile devices such 
as many cell phones often are classified as computers. Billions of people around 
the globe use computers as a primary means of local and global communication 
allowing users instant access to information. As technology continues to advance, 
computers and technology become a part of everyday life and many people are of 
the opinion that computer literacy plays a vital role in achieving success in today’s 
world. This chapter will not discuss the different components of computers, but will 
introduce you to different tools that are available in the digital world as well as the 
implication thereof to the business as well as the employee.
This chapter presents the importance of information and communications 
technology (ICT) in the work environment. You will be introduced to the relevance 
and importance of technology and how you can apply that to your advantage 
in the environment in which you work. The use of the Internet will be explained 
and how the Internet can form part of your work environment to benefit both the 
organisation and you as an employee.
Businesses rely on research regardless of whether it is conducted formally or 
informally: the manager might have to prepare for a presentation where research

is necessary to gather data and information to verify facts; the company that you 
work for might see the need to improve its services and that also requires thorough 
research to determine if a similar study has been conducted in the past. The outcome 
and findings can be of value to your organisation. The different ways to conduct 
a research project will be introduced as well as methods that can be followed to 
ensure that the project is valid and will contribute to the success of the business.
Social media form an integral part of the modern era. The role of social media 
in the office environment as well as in the research process will be outlined.
3.2 The role of information and communications technology
3.2.1 Definition
ICT (information and communications technology – or technologies) is an umbrella 
term that includes any communication device or application, including radio, 
television, cellular phones, computer and network hardware and software, satellite 
systems and so on, as well as the various services and applications associated 
with them, such as videoconferencing and distance learning. ICTs are often spoken 
of in a particular context, such as ICTs in education, health care, the business 
environment or libraries.
3.2.2 Historical background of technology
The computer is one of the most brilliant gifts of science and this device was 
originally developed by Charles Babbage. Most countries have developed fast due to 
the inclusion of computerisation. Computers operate on programs that are written 
specifically for them to function optimally. Characteristics of good computers 
include aspects such as speed, accuracy, reliability and integrity.
What is a computer in layman’s terms? It is an electronic device for storing 
and analysing information fed into it, for calculating or for controlling machinery 
automatically. Charles Babbage developed this device first in 1812, followed by 
George Boole in 1854, Howard and Aitten in 1937, Dr John Nouchly and J.P. Eckert 
in 1946. These computers were named first generation equipment. Today, we are 
using fifth generation computers with ‘artificial intelligence’ technology. Each new 
generation of computers has been smaller, lighter, speedier and more powerful 
than the earlier versions. Now note-book sized computers such as laptops are fairly 
common and owned by the majority of first world inhabitants. Computers have 
been dominating technology since the early 1970s and have now entered almost 
all walks of life (Unisankar, 2012).
As mentioned earlier, it is essential for computers to run on programs specifically 
written for each individual purpose. This task is performed by a software engineer, 
more commonly known as a programmer. A computer program can be defined 
as a complete list of instructions which the computer accepts in order to solve a 
Quality in the Office for IT Professionals

problem. There are many different languages that can be used in programming 
such as BASIC, COBOL, FOR TRAN, C, C++, JAVA and Visual Basic.
We will now learn how information and communications technology influences 
us on various levels of our lives.
3.2.3 Importance of ICT in the office environment
The importance of ICT does not only lie in technology itself, but in its ability to 
create greater access to information and communication in underserved populations. 
Many countries around the world have established organisations for the promotion 
of ICTs, because it is feared that unless less technologically advanced areas have a 
chance to catch up, the increasing technological advances in developed nations will 
only serve to exacerbate the already existing economic gap between technological 
‘have’ and ‘have not’ areas (Rouse, 2005).
Due to the diverse challenges in today’s world there are high expectations on 
ICT to deliver business and social transformation to secure our future.
3.2.4 Intelligent use of information
The rapid development of ICT has an enormous impact on how people live their 
lives and run their businesses. Today, the entire world is interconnected through 
networks generating massive amounts of data that accumulate on a daily basis. 
With the rapid increase of smart devices, people are now able to access information 
anywhere, any time. Furthermore, linked by networks, people are beginning to 
create new knowledge.
These developments have been supported by incredible technological advances 
in computing power and network speeds. Information is the key to bringing about 
this transformation. We are able to exploit information as never before, managing a 
large amount and variety of information in real time through networks. Individuals 
and businesses have unique abilities to collect, process and organise all this 
information at their fingertips.
People’s lives, business and society can be transformed by the intelligent use 
of information (Fujitsu, 2014). The following three spheres are included in the 
transformation process:
1.  People’s lives: It is possible to comprehend a person’s situation (location 
and scene) in real time and optimally deliver various services, bringing new 
experiences and insights.
2.  Business: Management is able to, for example, monitor sales trends and related 
information from around the world in real time and adjust production schedules 
for respective product lines.
3.  Society: City energy supply and demand, traffic conditions or disaster status can 
be visualised in real time, enabling people to make better decisions.

3.2.5 The expanding role of ICT
The contemporary world will struggle without technology and its different 
applications. It has become such a crucial part of our daily lives that it is almost 
impossible to imagine how we would function without the use of computers.
The explosion in electronic commerce is just one example of the many ways 
information technology is influencing how people do business and how they 
account for financial and economic events. The blending of Internet technologies 
and traditional business concerns impacts all industries and is really the latest 
phase in the ongoing evolution of business infrastructure, and it enhances the rate 
of response to customer needs.
The role of the accountant and objectives of the accounting systems, which are to 
process financial and economic data into information for decision making, are still 
the same. Also, the audit objective, which is to render an opinion on the ‘true and 
fair view’ of a client’s financial status, still holds. However, the technical expertise 
that the auditor must possess to evaluate computer-based accounting systems 
has undergone considerable change and that change will continue to be more 
and more radical and rapid. ICT is seen as a way to promote educational change, 
improve the skills of administrators and prepare them for the global economy and 
information society. ICT is used to improve delivery of and access to effective and 
efficient management of the office and the organisation as a whole. With a focus 
on administrators, ICT tends to improve the understanding of the administrative 
practice and functions, increase the quality of administrators’ work attitude and 
thereby increase the impact of the administrative function on the management of 
the office. While ICT-based innovations can occur in administrative and office-
related functions, their linkage to office management is essential to achieve the 
intended outcomes of an organisation (Buseni, 2013).
Many of the routine activities today – at home and in business – are performed 
by computerised technology. The computer has proved a friend and servant of 
science, technology and industry. Most offices, shops, factories and industries 
use computers to execute their daily tasks in various levels of their functioning. 
Computers have made the world a global village. Just think how easy it is to order 
books and DVDs from abroad, for example from Amazon.com, to order clothes 
online from online shopping hosts such as Spree and Zando and to trade on 
OLX. The Internet is a storehouse of information and is used by billions of people 
globally on a daily basis. The use of computers is a win–win situation for all its 
users. Telecommunication and satellite images are also computer-based.
We used only calculators in the past, while currently the most complex 
calculation can be performed with the aid of a computer. Data and instructions 
are entered into the memory of a computer in the form of text, numbers, images, 
audio and video, often referred to as input, and once processed, provide output 
results accordingly. Calculators provide the answer to the immediate input only; 
Quality in the Office for IT Professionals

39
Advanced technological tools in the office
computers are programmed with a set of instructions and execute results with 
incredible speed. Complex mathematical problems, for example, are solved within 
a fraction of a second. Computers play a pivotal and crucial role in sectors such as 
transportation, banking, business, travel, security, education, tourism, government 
activities, the defence force, aviation, health and emergency services.
Computers also play an essential role in an era where e-shopping (shopping via 
the Internet) is common practice. Super computers are mainly used for banking 
transactions, railway operations, aircraft control and managing telecommunication 
systems in an effective, accurate and convenient manner. Computer technology 
plays a role in complex surgery, such as the use of laser technology.
Young people too enjoy computers as entertainment by playing games using 
play stations and other video games. We find computers in every walk of life and 
our lives would come to a standstill without computers and technology. Can you 
relate to the frustration of being busy with important tasks at work and suddenly 
your technology cannot function due to a power failure? Imagine the following 
scenario: you have a smart phone that you use on a daily basis. Your smartphone 
is stolen. How do you imagine you will function without your phone while you 
wait for a replacement?
The world is now a global village due to telecommunication systems worldwide. 
What was only a dream in the past is now possible, such as researching and 
discovering outer space that was once unexplored. Travelling in space has provided 
new information about planets and the universe. The ‘sky is the limit’ saying 
becomes a reality for the future generation (PRLog, 2011).
3.3 Technology driven office
It is difficult to imagine the office environment and life in general without desktop 
computers, photocopiers and sophisticated telephone systems. However, these 
technologies originated in the very recent past, with innovations and improvements 
that have occurred into the twenty-first century. Especially during the second 
half of the twentieth century, technological advances have greatly enhanced the 
business world. A technology driven office consists of the physical technological 
equipment and its users, globally known as the end users. People should possess a 
set of skills to ensure optimal utilisation of technology that forms part of the digital 
world.
Buseni (2013) stressed that technology is the systematic application of scientific 
knowledge in order to achieve practical results. It entails a combination of different 
approaches to solve a problem, which implies that technology is all about methods 
and the way people apply them in order to get results. We live in a competitive 
environment where things are changing fast and for the better technologically 
and, due to the growing complexity of modern day management, the office is also 
changing. Administrative functions such as typing and mailing a letter that could 

40
Quality in the Office
take minutes or hours to do, can now be carried out in seconds with speed and 
accuracy. The advent of ICT has revolutionised administrative functions and the 
office. The administrator has to be well equipped to meet the present challenges 
and the challenges of the future in a contemporary office. Information and 
communications technology has revolutionised the work of the office, changing 
work patterns and attitudes of employees and thus people are now working towards 
an acceptance of change (Buseni, 2013).
The next two sections will take a close look at the benefits (positive) and 
consequences (negative) of technology in the office environment.
3.3.1 Benefits of technology in the office environment
Businesses that incorporate the use of technology can enjoy the following:
Increased efficiency and speed
Electronic information, financial records and computerised processes such as 
document production and statistical calculations make offices more efficient 
without compromising excellence. Tedious tasks that used to take time to perform 
can now be completed within minutes. Technology-enhanced measurements and 
calculations improve accuracy and uniformity.
Reduced labour costs
Technology allows businesses to automate functions that historically required 
the need to hire an employee. Bookkeeping functions are handled by software 
applications such as Pastel and Quickbooks and sales can be automated through 
contact management sites such as SalesForce. Managers have the opportunity to 
focus on strategy and to cut down on labour expenses.
Improved sharing of information
Virtual assistants and telecommuters can be located across town or across the 
globe, thanks to the wonders of modern telephone systems and electronic 
communications. Web conferencing and virtual-world webinars make it possible 
for colleagues within one organisation or from different organisations to interact 
with one another. On a more individual level, electronic document production and 
calculations make it possible to implement small or even major changes, as well as 
make corrections quickly and seamlessly (Blank, 2014).
Easier storage
Filing documents in the past required employees to save a minimum of two copies 
of each document for future purposes. Technology eliminates the need for double 
or triple entry systems and reduces the need to file large amounts of paperwork. 
Quality in the Office for IT Professionals

41
Advanced technological tools in the office
Important documents such as customer information and contracts can be stored 
in virtual data warehouses and accessed in minutes, which eliminates the need 
to purchase or rent storage space. The possibility of losing documents through 
disasters such as water and fire damage is eliminated.
3.3.2 Negative impact of technology on the office environment
Organisations can suffer any of the following as a result of technology:
Business relationships
Technology enables businesses to hold meetings remotely without all the 
participants physically present in the same location. One of the drawbacks is that 
meeting with somebody over the Internet is less personal than face-to-face contact. 
Business people do not meet in physical places to brainstorm ideas or have other 
communications or meetings that require a level of personal interaction.
Dependency
Technology has changed business to the point where the technological tools are 
more than just mechanisms for doing work. People have grown addicted to their 
technology and when things break or ‘go down’, they literally do not know how to 
be productive without the technology that they rely on.
Implementation and maintenance costs
The initial implementation of technology related items can be a major expense, 
depending on the size of the business. The costs do not stop once technology 
orientated equipment is procured. With the ever expanding digital world we need 
to constantly upgrade to meet the demands of industry: new software is developed 
and computers become smaller and more complex. Outdated technology affects 
production and output.
Loss of data
While a computer crash is the most common way to lose data and information 
there are many other risks. Data can be lost as a result of viruses, natural disasters, 
theft, accidental deletion or corruption. Although data recovery services exist, they 
are expensive and sometimes it is impossible to recover lost data.

on the office environment.

3.3.3 Competencies needed for effective technology use
Computer literacy is vital to business success in today’s world. The requirements 
that determine computer literacy change as technology changes, so staff have to 
keep up with these changes to remain computer literate. Personal computers and 
software application packages proliferate in all organisations. End users are now 
a large group in organisations worldwide, and they are assuming more and more 
of the responsibilities that were previously reserved for data-processing experts 
(Van Antwerpen, 2013). A functionally computer-literate person must have enough 
general knowledge about computer systems to solve problems and to adapt to 
new systems and packages without much retraining. Without the necessary skills, 
technology cannot be utilised to its full potential.
The following skills are required to be fully computer literate:
 
Information technology literacy skills: a basic knowledge of how to use 
computers.
 
Information-searching skills: knowledge of how to use search databases and the 
Internet efficiently and effectively.
 
Evaluative and critical skills: the ability to make effective use of the information 
obtained.
 
Information-handling skills: the ability to cope with the vast amount of 
information available, and with rapid changes in sources and services.
An employee who has a good understanding of computers (ie someone who is 
computer literate) should be able to use digital systems in a sophisticated or 
effective manner or use them for multitasking to improve productivity. Users have 
to understand the use and functioning of their technology otherwise expensive 
technology may be severely underutilised and an enormous amount of energy and 
time may be wasted in trying to make it produce the desired result. In addition, 
extensive computer knowledge may well enhance an individual’s or a work group’s 
power in sectors that are dependent on computer technology.
Quality in the Office for IT Professionals

43
Advanced technological tools in the office
3.4 The role of research in the business environment
Businesses succeed or fail based on the decisions taken by people in the organisation. 
Managers need access to facts and figures about the organisation’s performance, 
markets, financial aspects to enhance the business and the quality of their products.
Research is vital for continuous upgrading of skills and knowledge of your 
employees to ensure that quality services are delivered. Conducting research within 
organisations is necessary in areas of professional and self-development of the 
employees through training and mentoring. Organisational research and analysis 
is needed to assess performance management and the well-being of employees.
People are involved directly as they initiate all processes. Research assists to 
develop meaningful and relevant policies and procedures to bring positive change 
within an organisation. Ultimately, it is research that helps sustain a company. 
It enables the management in decision making through careful analysis of the 
research output for the benefit of the organisation. Many organisations have been 
unable to sustain themselves and have fallen purely because of neglecting research 
and not keeping abreast of market trends and innovations. Research is important 
for the success and survival of businesses (Murali, 2012).
Research done in a company can be seen as twofold:
 
Formal research conducted on the organisation itself to reflect the financial 
position of the company; to determine how the organisation is viewed by clients; 
to establish what the future possibly might look like.
 
Informal research done by the office manager to provide the manager with 
information that he/she requires (such as travel bookings, purchasing of tickets to 
watch a soccer game, ordering of flowers, catering, etc).
3.4.1 The importance of business research methods
Research on aspects related to the business environment, such as your target 
customer, marketplace trends, production processes and financial practices, can assist 
the administrative manager to predict trends, project sales, spot opportunities and 
avoid potential problems. Understanding the nature of different types of business 
research will help you use data to maximise all sales and profits, which is only 
one aspect of research used in the global office environment. Office administrators 
use research on a daily basis – this can include tasks such as purchasing concert 
tickets for your manager, booking travel arrangements for the manager who has 
to attend a workshop or conference locally or abroad and assisting the manager to 
compile a presentation to promote your company to external clients.
Business research can help you determine what potential customers want, which 
can guide you toward the development of better products and services. It can keep 
you abreast of what your competition is doing and help you spot marketplace 
and industry trends. Research allows you to analyse how your departments are 

44
Quality in the Office
performing, and then compare their performance against projections to determine 
if you need to make adjustments.
3.4.2 Types of business research
Experiment with a variety of business research types to maximise the benefit that 
data can provide to your company. Conduct frequent customer surveys and focus 
groups of potential customers. Join your industry’s trade association to access its 
research studies. Perform budget variance analyses every quarter to determine if 
your revenue and expense projections were correct or if you need to adjust your 
budget. Keep tabs on the competition to determine if they have changed their 
products, where they advertise, the price of their products and services and where 
they are selling. Check your website traffic data to determine exactly who visits 
your site, the pages that they are accessing and which keywords bring people to 
your site (Ashe-Edmunds, 2014).
3.4.3 Steps in the research process
Although the purpose of this section is to introduce you to how to conduct a 
research project in a non-academic way, it is important that you understand the 
various steps that should be followed to conduct a survey or to determine the 
outcome of a problem that your business faces. When you conduct a research 
project for scientific purposes, consult books and literature that are specifically 
written to guide you on how to tackle a full-scale study. We will only touch on 
how you will practically implement the steps in your work environment to conduct 
formal or informal research for your organisation. The next section will assist you 
on how to approach the research process.
Step 1: Identify a particular problem
Problems are sometimes so simple that they do not require elaborate research 
and past experience may also offer the solution on how to approach and handle 
a specific problem. However, there are often times that resources are needed to 
do good research that is of value to the organisation. There might be a lack of 
knowledge and other factors that prompt an organisation to do thorough research 
to assist managers, for example during future planning and decision making to 
ensure the success of the organisation. A number of ventures fail due to a lack of 
sufficient information and research before implementing a project.
A problem is defined as ‘a matter or situation regarded as unwelcome or harmful 
and needing to be dealt with and overcome’ (Oxford, 2014). BusinessDictionary 
(2014) defines a problem as ‘a perceived gap between the existing state and a 
desired state, or a deviation from a norm, standard, or status quo’. Although 
numerous problems turn out to have several solutions (the means to close the gap 
Quality in the Office for IT Professionals

45
Advanced technological tools in the office
or correct the deviation), difficulties arise where such means are either not obvious 
or instantly available. How do we identify a problem? How do we know that what 
we have identified is indeed a problem? A problem, no matter how simple it may 
seem, comes with a long list of assumptions that may be inaccurate and could 
influence or misguide you during a potential problem identification. Each problem 
forms part of a greater problem.
Possible problems that you as an office manager might come across in your work 
environment may include:
 
lack of employee commitment;
 
the need for technology that will improve productivity;
 
effect of the physical office environment on morale;
 
the need for skills improvement courses to increase productivity; and
 
implementation of different social activities to help reduce absenteeism.
Your problem will now become the topic of your research project.
Step 2: List keywords
Once the topic or problem has been identified, the next step will be to define its 
scope. This is where the listing of keywords is helpful. Your list of keywords will 
assist you when you look up relevant information about this particular problem. The 
list provides you with a framework within which you can operate and ultimately 
ensures that you stay within your parameters.
Step 3: Do a literature search
Through a literature search you will find published and unpublished work from 
previous research conducted in the areas of interest of your topic. This includes 
newspaper articles, books, journals, magazines, conference proceedings, doctoral 
and master’s projects, government publications and financial and marketing 
reports. You will have to read extensively to ensure that your particular problem 
has not been researched in the past and recommendations made that will assist 
you to solve your problem without the need for a full-scale research endeavour. 
Your organisation does not have time and money to ‘reinvent the wheel’ by trying 
to rediscover things that are already known. You will also get ideas for questions 
that you can include in your research instrument, which will be discussed in step 
5 below.
During the literature search it is advisable to limit your search to the latest 
documentation that you can find. It is sometimes necessary to use original work 
especially existing theories that might initially have been published years ago, 
but they are still valid and relevant. Use parameters during your search to prevent 
useless information being included in your search. Time will be saved if you do not 
have to deal with irrelevant literature.

46
Quality in the Office
In the ICT driven world, the process of a literature search is relatively simple. 
You can get books and periodicals from a library, but the majority of the work 
is available online. Books can be downloaded, articles are sometimes free or can 
be purchased for a nominal fee from academic journals and reports from other 
organisations are available online. Online searches provide a number of advantages: 
they save time, are comprehensive in their listing and review of references and you 
can focus only on the material most central to your research effort (Sekaran, 2003; 
Repko, 2012). Getting access to these materials is relatively inexpensive. Useful 
database platforms include Google Scholar, Emerald, Science Direct, Elsevier and 
SAGE and depending on your subscription provide abstracts and full text articles.
When you conduct a literature search, you will use the direct searching method 
that includes subject and keyword searches. You can search library catalogues 
online by using subject searches that require the user to master the correct 
terminology in order to search under subject headings and disciplines. Keyword 
searching allows the user to find relevant literature within a particular discipline 
(eg human resources, business management and administrative management). 
Search engines such as Google (the world’s most popular web search engine), Bing, 
AllTheWeb, Email-Search.org, Yahoo and AltaVista allow search options across an 
array of electronic sources.
It is advisable that you save data electronically in a folder that you have created 
for this purpose, on external devices such as hard drives and memory sticks, and 
to email the documents for backup purposes. Saving important documents in the 
cloud will enable easy access when you work remotely. Dropbox and Syncplicity 
offers cloud storage basically free of charge for predetermined space allocation. 
To store something in the cloud means that you can store or save digital data in 
logical pools where multiple servers are involved. Information can be accessed from 
various remote locations, with the facility typically owned and managed by hosting 
companies. These hosting companies very often allow you to have a limited storage 
space free of charge, but when you require more storage space, it comes at a cost.
Step 4: Define the problem (problem statement)
You have identified a possible problem with keywords and conducted a literature 
search. It is now time to give structure to your problem and to define issues of 
concern that will be investigated. Solutions cannot be found if the critical issue 
or problem that needs to be studied is not clearly outlined. A problem definition 
or problem statement should be clear, precise and a concise statement of the issue 
that is to be investigated with the final objective to find an answer or a solution 
(Sekaran, 2003; Repko, 2012).
Quality in the Office for IT Professionals

47
Advanced technological tools in the office
Problem definitions could relate to:
 
existing problems in your business where management is looking for a solution;
 
situations that may not cause problems currently but management feels there is 
scope for improvement;
 
areas where conceptual clarity is required for better theory building; or
 
research needed to find answers to a particular problem because of interest in the 
topic.
The research problem and the purpose statement assist the researcher to identify the 
participants that will form part of the study; they are referred to as the population.
Step 5: Choose your approach
Two approaches exist and include either deduction (theory-testing), which involves 
the formulation of hypotheses (statements which the theory suggests are true), and 
induction (theory-building), which involves observation and investigation into the 
relationship between actions and meanings of humans. Once you have determined 
the approach that will be suitable to answer the problem, it will be necessary 
to collect data in a systematic way to allow you to ultimately draw meaningful 
conclusions from the findings.
Step 6: Select the measurement tool
How are you going to conduct this project? The most suitable way for you to find 
solutions to the identified research problem will now be determined. A number of 
tools exist, but your task will be to identify the measuring tool that will guarantee 
a successful end result. Remember that you need answers to your problem and 
ultimately solutions that will enable you to improve the services of the business.
Data are classified as qualitative (data based on meanings expressed through 
words and language) and quantitative (data that can be quantified). Qualitative 
data can be collected through interviews, observation, focus groups and scenario 
setting. Quantitative data require statistical analysis and can be gathered through 
surveys and laboratory experiments. If you are not an expert in the design of 
measuring tools, consider the option of outsourcing which is explained later in this 
chapter (see section 3.4.6).
Depending on your organisational budget, you can conduct research in a 
variety of ways. Online surveys can provide you with quick, easy-to-understand 
data. Websites such as SurveyMonkey® and LimeSurvey® allow you to administer 
short surveys for free for the basic entry package and charge a fee for more 
expansive surveys. Telephone surveys of current customers allow you to spend 
more time and solicit open-ended questions. A focus group allows you to get 
a small group of potential or current customers together to discuss their ideas, 
suggestions and thoughts in ways that produce information you might not have 

48
Quality in the Office
considered. Mail surveys cost more, but allow you to reach a large number of 
highly targeted recipients, depending on what mailing list you use. Analysing your 
sales by distribution channel, territory, sales rep, price point, margin and volume 
helps you determine where you should focus your marketing efforts. The methods 
discussed above are all examples of research methods used to conduct formal 
research projects in the office environment.
The World Wide Web is a powerful information resource that can assist the 
office manager to do research on various levels. A primary reason why people use 
the Web is to search for specific information, including text, pictures, music and 
video.
Step 7: Identify the population
Who will form part of this project? When you identify the participants/population 
in step 7, it is important to include only those individuals that form part and have 
knowledge of the problem area, otherwise their contribution will be irrelevant and 
a waste of time and energy. Finally, by defining the population, the researcher 
identifies the group that the results will apply to at the conclusion of the study. 
Examples of possible population groups can include employees of the business 
(peers and management), clientele, suppliers and employees from other branches 
of the business.
Step 8: Decide on the type of questions
By now you have decided on the best method to gather the data. Structure is of the 
essence when conducting interviews, focus groups, achievement tests and surveys. 
In order to determine trends and draw conclusions from the data collected one must 
have a structured plan in the form of pre-formulated questions. Questions can be 
asked in the form of closed questions that provide possible answers that participants 
have to choose from, or open-ended questions that state a question and participants 
have no boundaries with regard to their response. Opinions are gathered through 
open-ended questions. Only questions that test variables (anything that can take on 
differing or varying values depending on different objects or individuals) relevant 
to the study may be included in the measuring tool. Test the measuring tool to 
determine its validity to ensure that it measures exactly what it should measure and 
performs as it is designed to perform. A pilot test (pre-testing) is one of the accepted 
ways to assess the validity of quantitative instruments. The tool should be tested to 
be valid externally, which means that the results of your study can be generalised 
(applied) beyond the sample – the findings of your study can be applied to other 
people in other settings. The content of the measuring tool should measure what 
you want to establish accurately and is generally referred to as content validity.
Quality in the Office for IT Professionals

49
Advanced technological tools in the office
A test or measuring tool that is valid should also be reliable. Reliability refers 
to the degree to which the measuring or assessment tool produces stable and 
consistent results.
Consider the following principles when questions are developed:
 
Language and wording: Participants must be able to understand the questions 
and chosen words must meet their (assumed) minimum frame of reference.
 
Type and form of questions: Questions can be open-ended or closed, depending 
on what is to be measured.
 
Content and purpose: The essence of the questions should be clear and direct to 
minimise confusion and a false outcome.
 
Positive and negative wording: Use a balance between questions that are 
phrased positively and negatively to minimise the possibility of responses being 
mechanically selected.
 
Ambiguous questions: Questions can be misleading and influence the true 
outcome of the tool.
 
Leading questions: Avoid phrasing questions in such a way that they lead 
respondents to provide predictable responses.
 
Loaded questions: Questions must not be phrased in an emotionally charged 
manner.
 
Double-barrelled questions: These type of questions lends themselves to different 
possible responses and should rather be asked in separate questions.
 
Length of questions: Respondents lose concentration when questions are too 
lengthy and have the tendency to select the first option that they see just to 
continue to the next question.
 
Sequence of questions: Respondents should be led from questions that range from  
general aspects to more specific and relatively easy-to-answer to progressively 
more challenging questions.
 
Personal questions: Include questions that reflect the respondent’s personal and 
demographic information only if absolutely necessary and if you are convinced 
that it will contribute to the essence of your project. Anonymous participation is 
advisable.
South Africa recognises eleven official languages. Although English is the language 
used in the business and operational environment you should always consider the 
reality that the majority of people speak English as their second or third language. 
It is therefore important that you compile the measuring instrument in such a way 
that it does not discriminate against any participant.

50
Quality in the Office
Step 9: Determine how data will be collected
The measuring instrument has been designed and tested for its validity and has 
passed the reliability test. It must now be distributed to those participants that 
you have identified. Again you can choose who you want to use to distribute 
the measuring instrument or, if you have interviews or focus groups, who will be 
conducting it. Remember that if you appoint someone to conduct the interviews 
or focus groups, make sure you select a competent person and that you provide 
the necessary training to guarantee the success and consistent execution of your 
project.
Data can also be collected through organisations that specialise in data collection. 
This tedious task can easily be outsourced. When you use software programs that 
are designed to create measuring tools online, a link to access the measuring tool 
is provided once the design process is completed and the tool can be distributed 
digitally to participants.
Feedback is received in the form of raw data. Results from online surveys 
for example are automatically captured in the incumbent’s database and can be 
presented in various ways, depending on how you request the program to display 
the results. If you use printed surveys presented as hard copies, remember that the 
raw data have to be captured in spread sheet applications such as MS Excel. To save 
time you can use organisations that offer data capturing services to external clients. 
Their services are quick and reliable. Practical factors that will assist a researcher 
to decide on one data collection technique or multiple data collection techniques 
include: estimated costs; expected quality of the collected data; predicted non-
response rates; and length allocated to the data collection period.
Qualitative data that are presented in the form of words have to be populated 
and if the feedback from respondents who participated in an interviewing process 
is recorded, the services of a skilled transcriber could be helpful.
Step 10: Analyse the feedback
If you used a measuring instrument that reflects the results in numbers such as a 
survey, you should consider consulting a statistician to analyse the data. Results 
must be displayed in a manner that is understandable. Not everyone is skilled and 
trained to analyse the feedback from your measuring instrument. Each question with 
its variables must be analysed and conclusions drawn from the results. Software 
packages designed for various unique purposes are available and assist users to 
analyse raw data. Packages currently on the market include SPSS (Statistical 
Package for Social Sciences), Stata from Stata Corporation and Statistica. Basic 
online services are available free of charge to assist you in your work environment 
with the analysis of less complex data.
Quality in the Office for IT Professionals

51
Advanced technological tools in the office
Step 11: Write a report
A report communicates the findings (obtained after data analysis) and conclusions 
to a specific audience. You should include the topic of the research project and 
the purpose statement which outlines the necessity of the study. Reports should 
convey information that is accurate, objective and complete. Ensure that the report 
is well-written, clearly structured and expressed in a way that captures the reader’s 
attention and meets their expectations. The nature of the report will be determined 
by the content and purpose of the study. The purpose of the project will ultimately 
guide you when a report is compiled on the findings that include a summary of the 
content, introduction or background, methods used, results, discussion, conclusion 
and possible recommendations. It can be academically inspired, which allows you 
to publish in subject journals or less formal where the results are published in 
business reports and other media used to communicate with clients.
The steps outlined above will guide you as office manager in conducting successful 
research projects for your business.
3.4.4 The importance of ethics in business research
When most people think of ethics (or morals), they think of rules for distinguishing 
between right and wrong. This is the most common way of defining ethics: norms 
for conduct that distinguish between acceptable and unacceptable behaviour 
(Resnik, 2011:1).
Most people learn ethical norms at home, at school, in church or in other social 
settings. Although most people acquire their sense of right and wrong during 
childhood, moral development occurs throughout life and human beings pass 
through different stages of growth as they mature. Ethical norms are so universal 
that one might be tempted to regard them as simple common sense.
Reasons why it is important to adhere to ethical norms in research:
 
Norms promote the aims of research, such as knowledge, truth and avoidance of 
error.
 
Since research often involves a great deal of co-operation and co-ordination 
among many different people in different disciplines and institutions, ethical 
standards promote the values that are essential for collaborative work, such as 
trust, accountability, mutual respect and fairness.
 
Many of the ethical norms help ensure that researchers can be held accountable 
to the public.
 
Ethical norms in research help to build public support for research. People are 
more eager to provide funding for research projects once they are convinced that 
they can trust the quality and integrity of the research project (Resnik, 2011). 

52
Quality in the Office
One of the most important aspects of research involves showing respect and 
consideration to the people participating in the study or project. These include our 
colleagues and subjects. Research ethics, also referred to as the responsible conduct 
of research, covers a broad area.
Research that involves people depends on voluntary participation. The areas of 
concern where the rights and dignity of the participant must be preserved include 
consent, harm, privacy and dishonesty. We will now outline methodology that you 
can use to guide you during the ethical decision-making process.
Consent
Participants have the option to decide whether they wish to form part of a 
particular research study or not. The following elements - capacity, information 
and voluntariness - should be present for consent to be given.
 
Capacity can be defined as the ability to acquire or recollect knowledge, 
authority or legal qualification to perform an act. The following questions should 
be answered: Is the person (subject) involved able to decide if he/she wants to 
participate? Do children or mentally impaired people have the capacity to make 
decisions?
 
Information involves ensuring that participants are properly informed and fully 
understand the purpose of the study and their individual roles.
 
Voluntariness means that the person participating in the study has the opportunity 
to choose to be part of the study without any force being exerted and can withdraw 
at any given point. Elements of force, deceit, fraud, pressure and concealed forms 
of constraint or possible intimidation to get people to participate in the study may 
not be used. To offer remuneration to participants is usually acceptable practice 
but offering convicts parole to partake in a study is not acceptable (Anon, 2014).
Harm
It is crucial in research ethics that participants may not be harmed in any way by 
your study. It is fairly simple to avoid any possible physical harm, but other areas 
that should be avoided include psychological stress, personal embarrassment and 
humiliation. The dignity of all the participants should always be a researcher’s 
priority. All research has the potential to cause harm or distress.
Privacy
Participants have the right to hide the fact that he/she formed part of the study 
and that any information given may not be linked directly to them. Research is 
often based on information or feedback gained from the participants and will be 
used in the study and perhaps also published and therefore the research should be 
Quality in the Office for IT Professionals

53
Advanced technological tools in the office
conducted in such a way that protects the individual’s anonymity and identity. 
Violating this promise of privacy can result in possible harm to the participant.
Dishonesty
Dishonesty in the research environment is misrepresentation of the truth regarding 
the purpose, nature or consequences of a particular research project (Anon, 2014). 
Omitting any fact or truth is the same as misrepresentation. Participants need 
to be fully informed to be able to give consent and if any part of the study is 
misrepresented or if participants have not fully consented, the researcher is ethically 
in the wrong.
3.4.5 Ethical decision making
Assume that you want to participate in some of your organisation’s activities but 
there seem to be ethical or moral issues involved that could interfere with your 
plans. Analyse the issue at hand in order to determine whether you should engage 
in that particular activity or not. You should ensure that your solutions are a true 
reflection of the facts and not just justifications.
Ethical decision making consists of four steps:
1. Define the ethical matter that you have to deal with.
2. Brainstorm all possible answers to the issue (How do I resolve the issue without 
affecting my activities?).
3. Rate the concepts that you have in mind for solutions by using the following 
guidelines:
a. It neutralises the issue.
b. It decreases the consequence of the issue but does not offer a complete 
solution.
c. It does not provide a solution to the issue at all.
4. Then, consider the following:
 
If one of your solutions is rated (a), it can be implemented and you can 
continue with your activities.
 
If not, continue to examine the answers rated as (b). You might need to break 
the issue down into smaller specific issues to enable you to develop solutions.
 
If all your ideas fall in the (c) category, you should redefine the issue at hand 
and brainstorm possible meaningful solutions.
 
Finally, if the issue cannot be resolved, do not continue. (Anon, 2014)
3.4.6 Outsourcing
If you are not an expert at conducting research or do not have the staff to perform 
this type of work, consider hiring a research firm or company to assist you with 
this task. They can provide you with a list of options, allowing you to increase your 

54
Quality in the Office
research effort as your budget allows. Research firms have access to tools such as 
databases, phone banks and email programs that you might not be able to afford, 
helping you to gather data you otherwise couldn’t. Time is of the essence in today’s 
business world and your staff can utilise their time better if they do not have to 
spend hours and days gathering data from participants to enhance your services.
Mol (2007) indicated that a variety of definitions that are in use in the industry 
are subsidiary to one of the following three descriptions of outsourcing and refers to:
1. any particular activity that is undertaken by an outside supplier;
2. the transfer of activities and possibly assets from an organisation to an outside 
supplier; and
3. those activities that are undertaken by outside suppliers but could also be 
undertaken by the firm.
Whatever your motivation to hire the services of a company that provides 
specialised research services, it will most probably include one or more of the 
motivations listed above.
Benefits of outsourcing
The schematic illustration below explains the benefits to an organisation of 
outsourcing research to experienced organisations or freelance individuals:
Figure 3.1 Benefits of outsourcing research
Levels of satisfaction experienced by organisations that utilise the outsourcing of 
research projects include the following:
 
Specialisation benefits: access to better or more specialised technology, 
concentration on core research project, access to skilled and experienced services.
Specialisation benefits 
Flexibility benefits 
Satisfaction of outsourcing research to 
organisations 
Market-discipline benefits 
Financial benefits 
Quality in the Office for IT Professionals

55
Advanced technological tools in the office
 
Flexibility benefits: improved flexibility for the organisation to utilise staff on 
their payroll to focus on the tasks they are employed for; outcome of the research 
project cannot be manipulated.
 
Market-discipline benefits: obtain better service by experts in the field of 
research.
 
Financial benefits: improved profits, internal resources are not used, tax 
deduction.
You are now aware of the benefits as explained above, but you should also be 
aware of areas that can be of concern to organisations.
Drawbacks of outsourcing
There are possible areas for concern when contracting organisations that specialise 
in research. As a client, you may experience one or more of the following (Lacity 
& Willcocks, 2009):
 
excess fees charged for services that are beyond the contract (poor contracts or 
poor management of uncertainty);
 
hidden costs not stipulated (poor contracts);
 
fixed prices that exceed market prices if the project runs for a longer period than 
anticipated or catered for (no mechanisms for change in the contract);
 
inability to adapt the contract to minor unforeseen changes in the business or 
technology without triggering additional costs (poor contracts);
 
lack of innovation from the research company (poor vendor selection or improper 
contractual motivation); and
 
supplier does not respect intellectual property rights (poor contracts).
3.5 Social media in the work environment
There’s no doubt that social media in all its facets control our world. Ask people 
around you who is not on a social networking site. You will be surprised. The use 
of social media in the workplace is a reality. We use social media for a variety of 
reasons that will be explained later in this chapter. It is a given that in order to be part 
of modern society and its functions, one has to be able to understand the purpose 
and value of social media, and be aware of its advantages and disadvantages. 
Social media are used for relaxation, research, social networking and advertising. 
Organisations have policies to manage the use of social media and are keen on 
striking a balance of acceptable use in the work environment.
When discussing the benefits of social media with your friends and family you 
will probably hear conflicting opinions. On one side the views of addicted social 
media users and on the other those of people that do not have anything positive to 
say. Love it or hate it, social media is here to stay and is evolving at a rapid pace. 

56
Quality in the Office
We have media that are instruments of communication such as newspapers and 
radio and social media are social instruments of communication such as Facebook. 
If we break down the concept of social media, we need to distinguish between 
social media and social networking. 
3.5.1 Definition of social media
Investopedia (2014a) defines social media as ‘Internet-based software and interfaces 
that allow individuals to interact with one another, exchanging details about their 
lives such as biographical data, professional information, personal photos and up-
to-the-minute thoughts’. Social media originated as strictly a personal tool that 
was used to interact with friends and family but were later adopted by businesses 
wanting to take advantage of this popular new communication method to reach 
their customers, for example informing them of sales and offering them special 
discount coupons.
Examples of social media networks:
 
Facebook: General networking, photo sharing, links, apps (eg games, birthday 
reminders, etc), blogs and videos;
 
Twitter: General communication, micro-blogging, RSS (Rich Site Summary, a 
format that delivers regularly changing web content) and updates;
 
Tumblr: Microblogging and social networking;
 
YouTube: Sharing of videos and photos;
 
Instagram: Photo and video sharing site;
 
Pinterest: Online pinboard to organise and share things and subjects that you 
love;
 
LinkedIn: Business and professional networking;
 
Flickr: Photo sharing, commenting, photography-related networking;
 
MySpace: General networking; and
 
Google+: General networking.
3.5.2 Definition of social networking
Social networking can be defined as: ‘The use of Internet-based social media 
programs to make connections with friends, family, classmates, customers and 
clients. Social networking can be done for social purposes, business purposes or 
both. The programs show the associations between individuals and facilitate the 
acquisition of new contacts’ (Investopedia, 2014b).
3.5.3 Role of social media in business
Social media networks have an online option designed for marketing and 
promotional purposes. Brand awareness of businesses and organisations can be 
initiated through social media sites for their potential customers and existing 
Quality in the Office for IT Professionals

57
Advanced technological tools in the office
members of the sites to see what is on offer through visual media such as videos; 
customers will be able to see exactly what your particular brand offers. Social 
media can supplement the more traditional client support such as email, telephone 
calls and on-site visits.
Organisations can establish best practices in terms of how to develop a 
framework for product and service improvements. Your company can have its own 
unique Facebook wall to give customers the platform to voice their concerns and 
complaints, give feedback, raise questions, conduct surveys and the like. Twitter 
tweets, Tumblr dashboard and YouTube comment sections provide the same 
features.
Once the media have been up for a significant length of time, the success of 
a campaign can be monitored, for example, YouTube shows the number of total 
views, Likes or Dislikes and also allows comments directly underneath the video. 
Facebook offers the user or follower the opportunity to comment on the success 
or failure of products, services or brands. This information can be valuable for 
research purposes.
Customer service levels can also dramatically improve since the relationship 
between customer and company will become more intimate. Real-time is the key 
word to describe this specific relationship.
The use of social media can enhance the level of leadership through generating 
new ideas and thought processes.
3.5.4 How to use social media in business
You are now familiar with the importance of social media in the business 
environment. The following steps can be taken to enjoy all the benefits that social 
media offer:
Step 1
Select the social networking site that will be most beneficial for your company. 
Look at what each networking site offers and what it is designed for. Look at the list 
of networks that is provided in section 3.5.1 to guide you in the decision-making 
process.
Step 2
An account is created through a registration process which is relatively easy for all 
the sites mentioned in the list. It can be challenging to develop your unique page 
or profile and make it tempting enough for your customers and clients. Consult 
with the creative experts in your company who are familiar with the different 
applications of each site (referred to generally as apps) before you continue with 
the process internally. You may also use external organisations specialising in 

58
Quality in the Office
creating profiles and doing account management for companies that have social 
media sites.
Step 3
When creating your brand page or profile, it is important to remember that social 
media service providers also support companies when it comes to getting ‘Likes’, 
fans, followers and subscribers. Although some experts question the legality of 
those services, these can no doubt provide the initial following your brand might 
need to at least have a decent start. You just have to choose which company to hire 
for the specific services that you require.
Step 4
You have by now established your presence on the web and what remains includes 
the challenge of maintaining your brand page and updating your profile frequently. 
It is important to make sure that visitors to your social media outlet return, once 
having had a pleasant experience. Update your page with relevant and interesting 
information related to your business or brand and make sure to involve viewers 
and readers by thanking them, commenting and replying to messages as often as 
possible.
3.5.5 Benefits of social media for the work environment
Now that you understand the influence of social media on your business, let us 
discover the possible benefits as identified by Angelova (2013):
Showcase your brand
It is important to maintain a strong social media presence to portray your company’s 
image and to showcase your business. The importance of branding and advertising 
is mentioned earlier in this chapter.
Develop a community of prospective loyal clientele
People enjoy the feeling of belonging to a business that is proactively building an 
active community. Studies have revealed that customers would rather purchase 
goods from a business with an active or interactive and up-to-date Facebook fan 
page than one with a passive fan page. The benefit of an emotional connection 
with your clients is loyalty and a good business reputation. With social media, the 
presence of an active community is a very influential branding force and provides a 
practically unlimited relationship-building platform. From a marketing viewpoint, 
it delivers the best opportunity for brands to create an enormous community of 
active, happy and loyal customers.
Quality in the Office for IT Professionals

59
Advanced technological tools in the office
Increase digital coverage
In order to be recognised among the large number of active sites on the web, you 
should aim to improve your social presence. Social media have a global reach with 
lots of web traffic in the form of daily visitors to sites. Information is delivered 
instantly in the digital marketplace that provides organisations with the chance to 
advertise and showcase their products by going beyond distance. Statistics indicate 
that social media interaction as often as two to three times weekly considerably 
increases your online presence in the digital market environment and new 
relationships are built outside the physical office environment.
Enhance company trustworthiness
Your company’s trustworthiness can successfully increase through the proactive 
tools of social media channels. Thorough communication with your clients on any 
social media platform can assist you to become a reliable source of information 
and enhance the credibility of your brand. Social media can be utilised to improve 
customer service and to transform negative customer experiences into positive 
outcomes. Remember that customer satisfaction is the key to customer retention.
Boost sales
Instant access to your consumers’ feedback/orders is unquestionably going to boost 
your sales figures. Website visitors should be seen as potential customers so it 
is advisable to respond to their queries or requirements punctually. Social media 
assist you to determine and meet your customers’ needs and also to research your 
competitors and their product offerings.
Increase digital traffic as well as search engine status
Social media channels constantly bring high volumes of traffic to web pages. The 
integration of social media with your organisation’s website is a wonderful way to 
convert leads into prospects. Website creators normally offer you the option to link 
your webpage with social media sites and share any business updates with a single 
click. The more channels you partake in, the higher the volume of traffic to be 
reached. Google allows live tweets from Twitter to appear in search results linked 
to personal profiles and business pages on Facebook. Businesses can easily use this 
privilege by optimising keywords in the title and description of their products and 
services in such a manner that reflects the search queries.
Cut marketing costs
Branding your business through social media marketing is affordable and replaces 
traditional marketing in print (hard copies, handouts and flyers) and advertising. 
Promoting products and services on social media platforms will lead to increased 

60
Quality in the Office
return on investment (ROI). The use of social media increases advertising opportunities 
and energises public relations efforts without huge financial implications and time 
commitment.
Social media have become a vital marketing tool. Although the importance of social 
media in today’s business environment is unquestionable, businesses still do not 
fully exploit the benefits. It requires creativity, passion and consistency to keep your 
social media campaign successful and active. Regardless of any competition, there 
is always an untapped market to be reached.
3.5.6 Negative effects of social media and networking in the work  
        environment
Social media platforms increase steadily and although the list of benefits is extensive, 
there are negative implications to the business environment. The growth in the use 
of social networking has repercussions in the workplace that can affect both the 
business and its employees. Employees with access to computers may use part of 
their working day to participate in social networking with measurable negative 
consequences for their employer. Examples of damage caused to employers include:
 
reducing productivity levels of employees as they habitually tend to check the 
sites because they are afraid of losing out on information posted;
 
damaging the reputation of employers through misinformation or comments 
posted on these websites;
 
threatening the business’s network security;
 
loss of information through fraud or disclosure of confidential or commercially 
sensitive information; and
 
liability for acts of the employee made in the course of their employment (Brooks, 
2013).
Social media can present a real legal threat to employers, which can be prevented 
by dedicated and well-communicated social media policies that govern the use of 
such technology in the workplace. Employers have the right to exercise control 
over the use of social media during official working hours.
3.5.7 Practical guidelines for administrative employees on social networking 
         in the work environment
Any social media page (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Pinterest, etc) should be done 
as a business page and linked to your business’s website. It is an easy way for 
customers to ‘follow’ you and keep up with the latest happenings of your business 
and events, etc, that your business may be sponsoring.
Quality in the Office for IT Professionals

61
Advanced technological tools in the office
Personal use of social media at work should be disallowed. Create a policy that 
prohibits the use of business equipment (computers, phones, etc) for personal use, 
including personal surfing of the net and social media sites.
If you have ‘friends’ on your social media pages who are also co-workers, create 
a list of them, and when you post, decide if it is something co-workers should see 
or not. Most social media allow posts to be blocked from people on your lists. Learn 
how to use this function; it is not complicated.
Utilise social media to promote events and business-related information only 
during business hours. It is a good idea to create a separate Facebook page solely 
to be utilised for professional use.
Be careful when you post information. Employers can go back into your history 
and find negative comments that you have made about fellow colleagues or about 
your employer.
Do you consider applying for vacancies online? If yes, the following guidelines 
could assist you during the application process:
 
Open a free LinkedIn profile and add a photo to enable potential employers to 
have easy access to personal and professional details.
 
Create a personal and a professional page on Facebook and link them to your CV, 
portfolio, blog or any other relevant information that might be of use to potential 
employers.
 
If you are invited to an interview, post or tweet how excited you are about the 
interview.
 
Ensure that your Facebook profile is clean and without any offensive posts 
(posted by you or friends) or photographs.
 
Use Pinterest to display your CV.
 
Conduct a Google search about yourself just to see what potential employers 
might find about you.
3.5.8 Cloud tools to boost productivity
Technology in conjunction with the economy has turned modern offices into an 
environment of demands. Professionals that function and operate in these offices 
are expected to juggle a wide range of tasks for co-workers, clients, managers, 
executives and sometimes contractors. Fortunately, the very technology that 
increases this stress can also bring some order. Weikal (2012) showcases five cloud 
tools for note taking, list making, collaboration building and organising. All of 
the apps listed are very useful and come highly rated by the technical fundis who 
focus on these things. They are either free of charge or very inexpensive, though 
premium services are offered at a predetermined price, usually mentioned on their 
sites:
 
Remember the Milk was started in 2004 by a group of software engineers and is 
one of the first examples of cloud computing, but this task app is still rated among 

62
Quality in the Office
the best in the world by users. This interface might feel a bit old-fashioned, but it 
is very flexible as well as intuitive. The list-making tool is one of the most useful 
features and allows you to categorise your lists in a variety of handy ways. Add-
ons have been developed for iPhone, Android, Windows, Google and Twitter.

WorkFlowy is based on the principle that everything can be boiled down to a list. 
This app makes lists of everything and, finally, lists within lists. Lists can include 
your favourite recipes, projects, meetings, to-do tasks … everything that you have 
to do can easily be compiled and tackled working with WorkFlowy.
 
Wunderlist is also about lists, similar to WorkFlowy. Wunderlist’s interface is 
more graphic and makes it very simple to move individual tasks or entire lists 
around and into other lists. Remote collaboration is simple and includes the 
sharing or printing of lists as well as note taking. More importantly, it assists 
you when you have to prioritise your tasks. The developers created an app that 
functions well on multiple platforms.
 
Objectiveli takes a different approach to task and organisational management by 
focusing on the endpoint. You start by setting your goals, then work backwards 
by creating objectives to meet those marks. The objectives are in turn broken 
down into smaller, manageable and measurable sections and you can track your 
progress with updates. Objectiveli is a wonderful choice if you’re a big-picture 
person.

Murally is a creative app that gives the user the opportunity to easily import and 
manipulate graphics and text into one digital canvass. It is flexible and admits 
a remarkable selection of formats. You can collaborate on projects and share the 
results by creating quick video presentations with the interface that enables you 
to zoom to enlarge certain aspects of the video (Weikal, 2012).
3.6 Summary
Computers are a primary means of local and global communication for billions 
of people. Two of the foundation skills required in business environments are the 
ability to communicate effectively and to analyse and solve problems. Problems 
can be solved through the successful implementation of advanced technology 
tools to assist during the research process to gain information about a specific 
problem or issue. Whether your research project is of a formal or informal nature, 
you can use the steps outlined in the research process to assist you to conduct  
a proper research project. The role and use of social media and networking  
were discussed with practical guidelines on how to use them to the advantage of 
your business.

Chapter 4
The global business environment
Learning outcomes
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
 
describe the concept of globalisation;
 
outline the dimensions of global business;
 
list factors to consider before a company enters the global arena;
 
identify possible benefits and shortcomings of global business; and
 
evaluate the role of administrative employees in the global business environment.
4.1 Introduction
Organisations, whether in the private or public sector, operate in an increasingly 
complex domestic and international (global) world. This chapter will guide you 
through the major themes and issues in the business environment at regional, 
national and international levels by setting them in the context of globalisation 
and the global economy.
The economic landscape is not the same as 20 years ago, nor is the pace of global 
economic change expected to slow down in the next 20 years. On the contrary, 
change is likely to accelerate with managers and support staff that understand 
what globalisation is, what drives it and what the implications are for them. What 
this means in practical terms is that you might be working as an administrative 
manager for a large international company with offices across the globe. You will 
have to communicate with employees worldwide, manage your manager’s tasks and 
business and also travel on his/her behalf to conduct business in other countries. It 
is therefore necessary for you to understand how global businesses operate as well 
as the task of administrators in the successful functioning of their organisations. 
For administrative areas, organisations seek colleagues who have broad-based, up-
to-date technical and methodical knowledge and for whom service is the priority. 
Employers expect a high degree of communication skills, the necessary flexibility 
in approaching changing tasks, a distinct orientation toward recognising and 
solving problems and a marked degree of team orientation. Due to international 
alignment, willingness to travel and corresponding foreign language skills are 
required. This is an example of what employers need from assistants who deal with 
the international and global arena.

This chapter will introduce you to the concept of global business, the key 
dimensions that represent important components of the business environment and 
how the administrative employee should function within those spheres.
4.2 The concept of globalisation
At a worldwide level, globalisation refers to the growing economic interdependence 
among different countries as reflected in increasing cross-border flows of goods, 
services, capital and skills. At the level of a specific country, globalisation refers to 
the extent of the inter-linkages between a country’s economy and the rest of the 
world. Despite an increasingly global world, not all countries are equally integrated 
into the global economy. At the level of a specific industry, globalisation refers 
to the degree to which a company’s competitive position within that particular 
industry in one country is interdependent with that in another country. The more 
globally an industry functions, the greater the advantage the company can derive 
from leveraging technology, manufacturing expertise, brand names and/or capital 
across countries. Examples of the globalisation of organisations are the well-known 
sports fashion and clothing companies of Adidas, Nike and Reebok that tend to 
dominate in every market.
4.2.1 Definition
Globalisation refers to the process by which organisations start operating on 
an international scale. It can refer to a number of overlapping trends, such as 
the worldwide communication revolution, the knowledge economy and changes 
affecting the business environment in general (Guy, 2009).
4.2.2 What drives globalisation?
Drivers of globalisation are specific managers of organisations who make decisions 
that result in increased cross-border flows of capital, goods and/or specialised 
skills. Managers are making such decisions more frequently because globalisation 
is becoming both more feasible and more desirable.
Four trends lie at the core of these developments:
1. An increasing number of countries are embracing the free-market ideology: 
The shift from a planning to a market mentality by economic policy makers in 
industrialised and industrialising nations.
2. The economic centre of gravity is shifting from developed to developing 
countries: Economic liberation promotes competition, efficiency, innovation, 
new capital investment and faster economic growth.
3. Technological advances constantly improve communications: Costs of 
telecommunications and ICT became more affordable to the general public

as technology advanced. Furthermore, such advancement allows people to 
communicate with others in different locations with the click of a button.
4. Opening of trade borders, investment and technology transfers: Opportunities for 
organisations to trade with competitors from abroad that enter their home markets.
4.2.3 Globalisation as a process
Globalisation is a process and not a completed state, implying that the world is 
constantly globalising and is not fully globalised yet. Reference to the global village 
may portray the image of an already completed process. It is widely accepted that 
globalisation involves the removal of barriers between countries to create a barrier-
free economy. The idea of a borderless world can include the breaking down of 
political, social and cultural borders by allowing international movement of people, 
policies, ideas, customs and beliefs and organisations to function interdependently 
in a political and economic sense (Harrison, 2010).
4.3 Dimensions of global business
It is necessary that you understand the functioning of your company with regard 
to its international prospects and position within the global business environment. 
Newlands and Hooper (2009) have identified dimensions of global business, the 
importance and relevance of which will be discussed briefly in this chapter.
4.3.1 International perspectives
International trends provide evidence that the international economy has rapidly 
become more integrated. Trade in goods and services, cross-border investment and 
the organisation of production networks across borders are blooming. A nation’s 
economic success depends largely on the capacity of its trading organisations to 
develop business relationships, trade and do business in the international arena 
(Newlands & Hooper, 2009). International business mainly includes business 
conducted between different organisations in different countries, as well as business 
conducted between different elements of the same company in different countries.
Information is one of the most common internationally traded items and ranges 
from everyday events mentioned in the news to confidential trading reports on 
market conditions in foreign countries. International business includes services such 
as consulting on foreign aid projects and capital for foreign investment projects. 
The employment of personnel from foreign sources is important as organisations 
seek skilled professionals to perform in the international arena. The ownership 
rights to goods, land, resources, information and businesses may be traded without 
transporting goods on container ships or trains. Technology is a much traded object 
of global business as organisations worldwide strive to compete with each other on 
the basis of quality or low cost.

68
Quality in the Office
Organisations that are involved in global business range from small enterprises 
that produce goods through to very large multinational corporations that are 
household names, such as Apple, Sony and the like. When trading internationally, 
your company should consider the following factors between the country from 
where you are trading (parent or home country) and the host country where 
subsidiary operations are conducted. The nature of international business can be 
classified in five subsections and includes cultural differences, the politico-legal 
environment, commercial environments, financial issues and business ethics.
Cultural differences
Harrison (2010) describes culture as an all-encompassing term that describes the 
complex set of values, beliefs, ideas and social interactions which distinguish 
one society or group of people from another. In this sense, culture relates to an 
identifiable group of people rather than an individual, something that people have 
in common, though the behaviour of any individual is shaped by his/her own 
genetic make-up and personality as well as by culture.
An identifiable cultural group may be synonymous with a specific nation, but 
it may also exist at local, regional or even transnational level. Classifications of 
culture often focus on the nation state as the main cultural entity, for example it 
is common to speak of British, Japanese, Australian or French culture. However, 
national culture is a convenient generalisation of the more common cultural 
characteristics of all the cultural groups in a particular country and does not 
necessarily reflect the individual subcultures that form part of a country. Cultural 
groups may also transcend national boundaries, for example Jews, Muslims or 
Asians, though the last term is rather vague as a designation of culture.
When you deal between different countries there are cultural differences to 
be considered, with language the most obvious. Management should consider 
other people’s social customs, such as the way people greet one another, concepts 
of hierarchy, personal space, work ethic, customer service, being an insider, co-
operation and individualism versus collectivism. Some social cultural aspects 
would never be acceptable in private, yet are the accepted way for business and 
management practices. In more practical terms, culture has also been described as 
a ‘set of values as well as a set of practices: the food we prefer to eat, clothes we 
want to wear, kind of leisure we pursue, rituals we abide by, traditions we embrace 
or invent and the ideas we follow’ (Harrison, 2010).
Examples of how we can get lost in translation are explained in an article 
by Denise Hummel (2013) entitled ‘Understanding the importance of culture in 
global business’. She mentions that an understanding of the subtle challenges in 
the use of English among non-native speakers, as well as the nuances of non-
verbal communication, is critical to achieve business objectives when operating 
across different cultures. In East Asian cultures, communication is very subtle and 
Quality in the Office for IT Professionals

69
The global business environment
indirect and the direct style of Western communication can easily cause serious 
offence, despite the best of intentions. The term ‘no’, for example, is rarely used in 
deference to more indirect methods of communicating and you may hear only the 
Chinese cue for the word ‘no’ – the phrases ‘maybe,’ ‘we shall see’ and ‘we shall 
study it’ are phrases that are the Chinese equivalent of ‘no.’ Failure to understand 
these signs wastes time and money, and is the basis of communication failure that 
can jeopardise the business objective. Failure to understand simple but subtle issues 
in communication may also cause both you and your counterpart to lose face. 
Causing loss of face (humiliation or embarrassment) for your Chinese counterpart 
is devastating to the business relationship and often irrecoverable – leading once 
again to loss of opportunity.
Perceptions and attitudes differ between cultural groups. In certain Western 
cultures there is a perception that when business people meet they are there simply 
to do business. However, in other cultures (such as Asian, Middle Eastern or Latin 
American) people take the time to establish relationships in which they will feel 
comfortable doing business. It is essential that you study the cultures of countries 
in which your company does business in order to avoid unexpected consequences 
that may lead to loss of business.
Culture can be seen in various aspects of the business functioning and especially 
participation in global business. Although the core elements of culture are deep-
rooted, they are not set in stone. Many cultural elements evolved over a period 
of time and became less formal during the last quarter of the twentieth century. 
Culture is adaptive in response to changes in our society with specific reference 
to changes in technology. Technology enables people to communicate more easily 
and over longer distances and has brought along a stream of new production 
processes and products that have changed our work and home environment. 
Think how technological innovations have changed our lives; innovations such as 
television, DVDs, mobile phones, smartphones and iPods that increase our exposure 
to information, ideas, images, music and lifestyles.
  Five elements of culture
Harrison (2010) identifies five main elements of culture:
1. Language: Communication between members of a group contributes to cultural 
coherence. Culture involves social interaction and shared sets of experiences 
with a common language that help to facilitate the socialisation process. It 
is normal for different cultural groups to be recognised by language, usually 
associated with nation states. It is interesting to note that Europe represents a 
relatively low number of languages in comparison to Africa where approximately 
2 100 languages are spoken. Building intercultural understanding within global 
business is essential for businesses to succeed internationally. Organisational 
leaders should be able to direct their organisations by understanding the 

70
Quality in the Office
behaviour of both their own employees and others outside the organisation to 
ensure the effectiveness of interaction and ultimately the business.
 
 
Intercultural communication involves the management and transmission of 
messages for creating meaning across cultures. Intercultural communication 
is the reason for many problems in a global business context. The areas of 
cultural variability, related to intercultural communication, include non-verbal 
communication (gestures, posture and facial expression), tone and volume, 
social distance (how far the speaker and receiver are apart from each other), 
time orientation, uncertainty-avoidance, locus of control, conflict orientation 
and worldview. The use of Skype can display the various aspects and nuances 
of non-verbal cues between communicators that are geographically distanced.
 
 
Your role as administrator is to ensure that the stakeholders of your company 
including your peers and superiors have a general knowledge of cultures and 
communication and the language spoken. This can be obtained by:
  developing an understanding of the basis of cultural differences;
  understanding the influences that culture has on communication and 
associated behaviours; and
  acquiring a level of intellectual curiosity, openness, tolerance and empathy 
towards foreign cultures and their inhabitants (Wibbeke, 2009).
2. Religion: Although a decline in religious activity is observed in the Western 
world, it is still the foundation of many cultures at various levels (sub-national, 
national and transnational levels). Religious beliefs and precepts predominantly 
stem from core values and beliefs. Christianity is still the dominant influence in 
North and South America as well as in Europe, as is Islam in North Africa, the 
Middle East and large parts of Asia. Religion may have an influence on dress 
code and other customs as well as fundamental beliefs and is very often one 
of the main building blocks of a country’s legal system. Religious beliefs can 
influence trading behaviour in two ways. Firstly, sharing the same religious 
belief often implies the sharing of similar values. A common religion may 
therefore enhance trust between trading partners or organisations and might 
lead to reduced transaction costs. As a consequence, the trade volume between 
traders that share the same religion should be higher than trade between 
different religions. Secondly, each religion has its own ethical standpoint 
towards the purpose of business and its core functions. Some religions perceive 
trade as a necessity whilst others see it as a value-creating activity.
3. Social structure and attitudes: The concept of social structure describes 
the manner in which a given society is organised and includes the power 
relationships between those in authority and those under authority; the 
composition of family groups; the relative importance of individuals and social 
groups; the degree of equality in society between different genders or between 
Quality in the Office for IT Professionals

71
The global business environment
different social groups. People’s attitudes towards any of these issues reflect 
the characteristics of social structure; attitudes such as those towards equality, 
work, leisure, conduct of business, material possessions or time and the future.
4. Education: Education can be seen informally as a lifelong experience where 
what you learn in your early years is the most influential. Cultural mental 
programming happens throughout this process and provides the channel 
through which culture is passed on from one generation to another. This 
includes language, religious beliefs, social structures and attitudes which 
are passed on, including an understanding of the world we live in. Formal 
education can successfully promote national identity and values and may in 
certain instances contain an element of censorship or propaganda. Even an 
apparently harmless reflection on the history of a country may contain an 
element of national interpretation or manipulation.
5. Inspiration and creativity: Culture is the source of inspiration and creativity in 
the production and design of goods as well as in the arts. This includes cooking, 
fashion, the automotive industry, architecture, literature and music, to list only 
a few that can be inspired by culture. Designs are inspired by influences from 
the home and creativity is not restricted to the more enduring kind of artefacts 
or products. It may reflect changing trends in fashion, architecture or music at 
a particular stage in a society’s cultural development.
To summarise, there are clearly important implications and aspects of culture that 
should be considered when business is conducted in different parts of the world. 
Culture affects the behaviour of consumers, the operation of labour markets, the 
relationships between firms, the nature of corporate governance and, through its 
influence on institutions, the entire functioning of an economy. With political and 
economic barriers between countries gradually being taken down, the process of 
globalisation allows culture to flow across borders.
Politico-legal environment
Each country has its own political and legal systems, while these may be classified 
under major categories, they are nevertheless quite different. Other aspects that 
need to be considered are issues such as employment regulations, contracts and 
dispute resolution.
Although the preferred political climate for a global firm is one that is stable and 
friendly, organisations may still profit and succeed in traditionally unfavourable 
conditions. The most important criteria is that the government is stable and that 
the set of rules or codes of behaviour governing business are predictable and 
adaptable. If the potential for profit exists and is permitted by government policies, 
a global company can still function. Political causes for instability include extreme 

72
Quality in the Office
nationalism, trade disputes and changes in ruling political parties. Political risks that 
global organisations may face when doing business are economic risks associated 
with the political environment, sanctions, violence, terrorism and war.
To understand how the political environment impacts your business, you must 
analyse how politically vulnerable your company is. Unfortunately, there are no 
universal guidelines to do so, but understanding how much your business is affected 
by the political environment can identify threats to your company.
Commercial environment
Commercial environments are also different from one country to another. There 
are different levels of development, ranging from highly industrialised countries 
through to emerging economies. Economies may be at different levels in countries 
that are growing rapidly and others that are in decline. Resource availability differs 
from country to country as does the infrastructure and support necessary for 
conducting business. Emerging economies may be able to adopt modern solutions 
which can be effected at a lower cost because no time and energy are wasted 
getting rid of historic legacy infrastructure, conditions and inefficient practices.
Financial issues
Countries that trade with one another may have unique currencies at variable 
exchange rates that need to be taken into account. Parties that form part of 
transaction processes must use different currencies that might be volatile as they 
fluctuate and business decisions to invest in a specific country can either mean 
success or failure.
The international marketer should make a careful analysis of the financial 
environment, since this area poses several risks. These include political risks 
and  many other commercial risks, foreign exchange risks, inflation and so forth. 
In international business, the two major concerns for the manager are how to 
get paid and how to avoid the above-mentioned risks. As money should flow 
between countries, credible financial infrastructures like facilitating agencies, 
commercial banks and research companies are necessary. In some parts of the 
world, the international company may have to be an integral partner in developing 
infrastructure before it can operate, whereas in others such a company may greatly 
benefit from a high level of sophistication in the foreign country.
Business ethics
The concept of ethics has two definitions. One definition of ethics is that it 
includes the moral principles that guide and influence an individual’s behaviour 
and decisions. The second definition of ethics is the branch of knowledge concerned 
with moral principles. Ethics and morals as concepts are not interchangeable. 
Quality in the Office for IT Professionals
The concept of ethics has two definitions. One definition of ethics is that it

73
The global business environment
Wibbeke (2009) describes it as follows: ethics as a set of moral principles is a noun. 
The word moral is an adjective that is used to describe the set of principles that is 
used to judge right and wrong behaviour, good versus bad human character, or just 
and unjust behaviour.
In Western cultures we distinguish between three traditions of ethics:
1. Ethics of purpose: Involves the ‘end’ or purpose of the person who decides what 
‘should be done’ and this end state is the ‘good’ for which he/she strives. Those 
who support the ‘good’ are judged right and those hindering the ‘good’ are judged 
wrong. There is a two-step approach in the ethics of purpose. Firstly to decide 
what should be done, and secondly to find the appropriate means to achieve that 
end.
2. Ethics of principle: All actions must be judged by the premise used to decide 
the action. If the premise used is judged universally acceptable, the action will 
necessarily be judged ethically ‘right’. The principle is based on the viewpoint that 
all persons have dignity.
3. Ethics of consequence: The focus is on the positive and negative effects of 
decisions or actions on affected people. Judging an action or decision, one needs 
to be aware of the ‘probable consequences’ and what those mean for the affected 
people. We need to know how the positive and negative consequences compare 
with each other. With this information we can choose the right action which does 
the most good for the most people and does the least harm.
Supporting all ethical traditions (Islamic, Hindu, African, Confucian, Western, 
Taoist, etc) is a system of morality comprising the principles we use to judge between 
right and wrong, just and unjust behaviour and good versus bad human character. 
It is our moral principles that guide our behaviour and with which we form our 
independent opinions about our behaviour and that of others. No matter what 
culture you are representing, you possess a set of morals. You will be confronted 
with situations in your work environment when you will have to rely on your 
moral values to act ethically and appropriately.
Your behaviour as an employee of a large company that is engaged in global 
business can be guided by these simple but important values:
 
be honest with yourself and others;
 
attack the problem and not the person;
 
think beyond boundaries;
 
take personal responsibility and be accountable;
 
keep your commitments and make it happen;
 
face the facts;
 
protect the intellectual property of the business;
 
be truthful;
 
be prepared for meetings and other business-related activities;
 
do not waste others’ time;

74
Quality in the Office
 
listen actively;
 
create value for your customers;
 
promise what you can deliver and ensure that you do what you promise; and
 
build quality in and improve continuously.
An organisation should develop and maintain its ethical culture using an integrity 
system. This is valuable when establishments work together in different countries 
and regions. It should consist of various procedures and include both internal and 
external perspectives.
Internal systems relating to the development within organisations include:
 
codes of conduct;
 
clear structures and systems which encourage ethical behaviours;
 
ethics training and development for both managers and executives;
 
ethics monitoring and reporting; and
 
‘whistle-blower’ protection.
External systems within countries relate to:
 
effective legal systems;
 
appropriate public service agencies that encourage integrity through their public 
policies; and
 
well-developed oversight agencies that protect the rights of the public in both the 
public and private sectors (Newlands & Hooper, 2009).
Whatever ethical position is taken with regard to the responsibilities of a business 
organisation, each individual member has a personal responsibility to act ethically 
within his or her individual sphere of the organisational activities. Individuals 
should not hide behind the organisation even where legal responsibility lies with 
the organisation itself. Ethical principles should apply to employees as well as the 
employer. In an ethical context, autonomy requires individuals to take responsibility 
for their own actions without the influence of external pressures. Such autonomy 
can be achieved by taking part in decision making through worker co-operatives 
and other forms of social participation rather than relying on others to make 
decisions on their behalf.
4.3.2 Relationship management
The importance of establishing relationships across borders has also been recognised 
in the emphasis marketers now place on relationship marketing, the building of 
long-term relationships that allow information and other benefits to flow between 
buyer and seller, helping to achieve loyalty from the buyer and commitment from 
the seller (Harrison, 2010). This dimension is concerned with key issues such as 
conflict management, negotiations, networking and contact building, hiring of 
employees and motivation, each of which will be briefly discussed.

The global business environment
Conflict management
In order to manage conflict in a global business environment one has to understand 
what conflict is. The Merriam-Webster dictionary (2014) defines conflict as a sharp 
disagreement or opposition of interests or ideas. Anytime people work together, 
conflict is a part of ‘doing business’. Conflict is a normal and natural part of any 
workplace. When it occurs, there is a tendency for morale to be lowered, an increase 
in absenteeism and decreased levels of productivity. It has been estimated that 
managers spend at least 25 per cent of their time resolving workplace conflicts – 
causing lowered office performance.
Handling and resolving conflicts that arise in the workplace is one of the biggest 
challenges managers and employees face. There are two responses to conflict:  
1) run away (avoidance) or 2) ‘battle it out’. We often feel uncomfortable or 
dissatisfied with the results because no resolution has been achieved. By learning 
to resolve conflict constructively, we can turn a potentially destructive situation 
into an opportunity for creativity and enhanced performance.
There are many causes or reasons for conflict in any work setting. Some of the 
primary causes are:
 
Poor 
communication: 
Different 
communication 
styles 
can 
lead 
to 
misunderstandings between employees or between employee and manager. Lack 
of communication drives conflict ‘underground’ and this is especially the case 
when trading across borders.
 
Different values: Any workplace is made up of individuals who see the world 
differently. Conflict occurs when there is a lack of acceptance and understanding 
of these differences.
 
Differing interests: Conflict occurs when individual workers ‘fight’ for their 
personal goals, ignoring organisational goals and organisational well-being.
 
Scarce resources: Very often employees feel they have to compete for available 
resources in order to do their jobs. In a resource-scarce environment, this causes 
conflicts – despite awareness of how scarce resources may be.
 
Personality clashes: All work environments are made up of differing personalities. 
Unless colleagues understand and accept each other’s approach to work and 
problem solving, conflict will occur.
 
Poor performance: When one or more individuals within a work unit are not 
performing – not working to potential – and this is not addressed, conflict is 
inevitable.
Negotiations
Individuals are negotiating all the time, and very often they are unaware of their 
active or passive role in a negotiation process. Organisations negotiate contracts to 
buy and sell products and services. Governments negotiate agreements on free trade, 

76
Quality in the Office
environmental performance and transfer of technology, and entice organisations to 
set up facilities within their borders. Because people are constantly negotiating, it is 
important for business and personal success to understand the fundamental process 
of negotiation, particularly within an international context.
We will briefly look at principles that can be adapted to meet the demands of 
national or cultural environments.
Step 1: Recognise negotiation opportunities
The first step in preparing to recognise situations that require negotiation is to 
identify the opportunity.
Step 2: Assess interests of both parties
The second step in effective negotiation preparation is to carefully assess one’s 
own interests and priorities as well as those of the other party involved. Interests 
include needs, desires and fears that drive the negotiation process. Positions are 
the assertions, demands or offers that parties make during negotiation. To be 
successful in a negotiation, it is not enough to argue for a position; the negotiated 
outcome should satisfy the interests of both parties. Practical examples include the 
introduction of a new product into a foreign country, prospects for mines to be 
developed or plants to be erected.
Step 3: Determine the best alternative to the negotiated agreement
Not every negotiation concludes with an agreement, nor should it. Occasionally, a 
party can do no better than to abandon the process when the costs of the proposed 
agreement exceed its benefits or because another party is in a position to offer a 
better deal. Alternatives are one of the greatest sources of power or leverage that 
a negotiator can develop and this can be done after the market has been studied 
extensively.
Step 4: Choose an appropriate negotiation strategy
The fourth step in effective negotiating is to strategically assess the best approach to 
resolve identified issues. One of the most popular approaches used to determine the 
best negotiation strategy is referred to as the dual concerns model that asserts that 
parties in conflict have two types of independent concerns: 1) a level of concern 
for their own outcomes and 2) a level of concern for the other party’s outcomes.
Five strategies that can assist during conflict management (but should not be 
confused with personal negotiating styles) are identified:
1. Integrating (also referred to as collaborating or problem solving): The negotiator 
is both assertive and co-operative. During collaboration an individual attempts to 
work with the other person to find a solution that fully satisfies the concerns of 
both parties.
Quality in the Office for IT Professionals

77
The global business environment
2. Accommodating (also referred to as yielding or obliging): An individual 
neglects his or her own concerns to satisfy those of the other person by relying 
on a profound level of self-sacrifice.
3. Avoidance (also referred to as yielding or inaction): This strategy is unassertive 
and uncooperative. When avoiding, a person does not immediately pursue his 
or her own concerns or those of the other party, and thus does not address the 
conflict issue. Avoiding might take the form of diplomatically side-stepping an 
issue, postponing it until an appropriate time, or simply withdrawing from a 
threatening situation.
4. Distributive (also referred to as competing or contending): This strategy is 
assertive and uncooperative and a power-oriented mode. During negotiation, an 
individual pursues his or her own concerns at the other person’s expense using 
whatever power seems appropriate to ensure his/her position, such as the ability 
to pull rank, use economic sanctions and the like.
5. Compromise: When compromising, the objective is to find an expedient, 
mutually acceptable solution that partially satisfies both parties involved. This 
falls on middle ground between competing and accommodating (Newlands & 
Hooper, 2009).
Each conflict management strategy reflected above has its advantages and 
disadvantages. Each one can be deemed appropriate given the type of conflict and 
situation in which the dispute occurs.
When negotiators have to work across borders, they are likely to encounter different 
cultures. As discussed earlier, culture is the unique character of a social group, 
which consists of psychological elements (values and norms shared by members of a 
group) as well as social structural elements (economic, social, political and religious 
institutions) that are the context for social interaction. Cultural values point to 
what issues are more or less important and influence a negotiator’s interests and 
priorities. Cultural norms define what behaviours are appropriate and inappropriate 
in negotiation and influence the strategies used by the negotiator. Cultural values 
may reveal the interests underlying the negotiator’s requests. Negotiators who 
value tradition over change may be less enthusiastic about economic development 
that threatens valued ways of life than those from cultures that value change and 
development.
Networking and contact building
Businesses should network internally and externally using a four-step process: 
1) identify your customers, 2) differentiate your customers, 3) interact with your 
customers and 4) customise your business to your customers. We refer to these 
four steps as customer relationship management (CRM). It creates an interactive 
feedback process involving stakeholders from customers to organisations, making 

78
Quality in the Office
it possible to forecast more accurately and consistently, and manage and meet 
customer specific expectations. CRM also highlights opportunities to take advantage 
of possible internal and external linkages. This is where customer surveys can come 
in handy to determine how your customers feel about the products, costs and 
services that they receive.
Networking is also about making connections and building enduring, mutually 
beneficial relationships that are necessary to ensure that you meet the ‘right’ people 
to include in your network and expand your sphere of influence. Ultimately, it is 
not about whom you know ... but who knows you! An overwhelming majority of 
successful people will confirm that networking is the key to success, be that in the 
political, community or business arena.
We are constantly bombarded with advertisements, emails, status updates, 
special offers and sales pitches creating a cluttered message. Personal relationships 
enable you and your organisation to stand out, rise above the noise and remain 
top-of-mind. Relationships are the catalyst for success; people do business with 
those they like and trust. Networking provides the most productive, most proficient 
and most enduring tactic to build relationships.
To succeed, you must continually connect with new people, cultivate emerging 
relationships and leverage your network. This is where technology can assist 
administrative employees who form part of organisations that trade globally. 
Networking can be done successfully through traditional fixed-line and mobile 
telephones and devices, and online communication channels that include Skype, 
an Internet communication product that enables voice- over-Internet protocol 
(VoIP) calls between Skype users.
One networking company, Kaleio (used by Apple and Google), is aiming to 
help businesses expand operations effectively and efficiently. In establishing a 
connection to what Kaleio calls the ‘Global Workforce Community’, the platform 
could provide a single business with resources needed to expand (George, 2013). 
Kaleio aims to offer a more diverse and expansive method to relate, connect, 
network, communicate, learn and grow in just about any field, trade or industry 
you can think of. The company offers multiple tools to expedite the networking 
process. These tools allow a user to conduct private or public discussions with your 
connection, find industry events that could be helpful networking opportunities, 
discover products, services, career opportunities, and collaborate on business 
solutions.
LinkedIn is a social networking site designed specifically for the business 
community. The goal of the site is to allow registered members to establish and 
document networks of people they know and trust professionally. The LinkedIn 
network is unlike Twitter and Facebook. Twitter, for instance, lacks profile depth 
and Facebook features many demographics of users and offers limited search 
functions. With LinkedIn, you create an in-depth professional profile, and user

79
The global business environment
information is standardised by education, profile headlines, profile experience and 
your company. LinkedIn is branded as ‘the place to find and be found’.
Networking has always been a critical part of the business world. Now that 
technology can connect everyone and everything, it has become the driver behind 
business connectivity. Maintaining your contacts provides useful methods for job 
search, discovering new hires or improving basic business tactics.
Recruiting employees abroad
When a business grows internationally, employing foreign workers who know the 
culture and language can help improve operations and create stronger bonds with 
customers. But before businesses can reap these benefits, they should plan for the 
logistics and legalities of having employees abroad. Nair (2014) identifies four key 
considerations when a company plans to hire foreign employees.
  Understand international compensation norms
Different countries often have different norms related to compensation packages. 
Make sure you have a good idea of the going rates of remuneration in the country 
where you are doing business. When making international payments to workers 
in a foreign country, business owners can use a free online currency converter to 
understand international exchange rates. To save money, they can also sign up 
for email market-rate alerts through a trusted online foreign exchange service to 
capture their preferred exchange rates.
  Understand the legal implications
When a small firm hires employees who will be working overseas, there can be 
legal considerations that vary from country to country. Countries such as Canada 
and the United Kingdom (UK) tend to have more strict employment laws than the 
United States of America (USA). Nair (2014) says that USA employers are free to 
fire staff with no notice or severance remuneration – if the dismissal is not for a 
discriminatory or retaliatory reason. In the UK and Canada, on the other hand, even 
in the absence of any discrimination, employers have to pay damages or notice pay 
for an unfair dismissal and employers are required to provide paid vacations and 
state holidays.
  Plan for the logistics of different time zones
Employers should be prepared to negotiate the time zone divide with their employees 
or contractors and set realistic expectations. You need to be clear on when people 
are expected to work or how they are supposed to communicate when they are 
actually working.

80
Quality in the Office
  Recruiting a contractor
Another crucial decision for the employer is whether to engage an independent 
contractor or a payroll employee. Many organisations looking to hire their first 
official international employee often think engaging a contractor is easier than 
hiring a full-time employee. But that is not always the case. Making team members 
contractors requires them to have their own business, set their own hours and use 
their own equipment, for example.
By thinking through everything from logistics to legal requirements, business owners 
can prepare themselves for the added responsibility of managing foreign workers. 
When your global business considers employing people remember that there are 
workplace standards around the world. Many organisations understand that a 
consistent set of values plays an important role in their success. Recruit employees 
who take pride in being part of a company that is progressive and successful. 
Follow an approach with integrity and maintain high workplace standards. As 
multinational businesses expand internationally, they should be aware that actions 
today may influence their entry to new markets in the future. Doing only what is 
required in each host country can result in international inconsistency that results 
in fragmentation and difficulty in establishing effective control. Many global 
businesses prefer a single predetermined set of workplace standards to enable them 
to benchmark performance, transfer expertise between countries and manage their 
worldwide operations effectively.
Motivation
Whenever a concern or difficulty arises it requires one or more of the following 
resources to accomplish the goals: physical, financial and human. Human resources 
can be utilised to full advantage through motivation, thereby building willingness 
to perform. A motivated workforce assists the enterprise to secure the best possible 
utilisation of resources both locally and globally. As mentioned earlier, managers 
will have to deal with employees from various cultural backgrounds – in terms 
of motivation, what works for one cultural group might not necessarily work for 
another group.
The position or rank of a subordinate or an employee does not only depend 
upon his/her qualifications and abilities. To get the most out of employees and 
their work performance, the gap between ability and willingness has to be filled by 
motivation which will lead to improved performance. This will result in:
 
increased productivity;
 
reduced operational costs operations; and
 
improved overall efficiency.
Quality in the Office for IT Professionals

81
The global business environment
The goals of a global business can be achieved once the following factors are in 
place:
 
there is best possible use of resources available;
 
there is a supportive work environment;
 
the employees are goal-directed and they perform their duties in a purposeful manner; 
and
 
operational goals can be achieved if co-ordination and co-operation take place 
simultaneously and can be effectively facilitated through motivation.
Motivation is an important factor that ensures employee satisfaction at various 
levels. Employees will be loyal to their employer when they feel part of the 
management function. Skilled and efficient employees will be a benefit to fellow 
employees as well as their employers. This will ultimately lead to a good public 
image in the market which will again attract competent and qualified employees. 
Motivation is an internal feeling (a reason for action) which can best be understood 
by managers since they work closely with employees. Needs, wants and desires are 
interrelated drivers to performance. These needs can be understood by the manager 
and he/she can determine the most appropriate motivation plans.
Finally, motivation is important to businesses that operate in the global 
environment because:
 
motivated employees lead to an empowered team;
 
teamwork and individual employee contributions result in a profitable and 
successful business;
 
adaptability and creativity will increase during periods of adjustment; and
 
motivation will result in optimistic and challenging attitudes in the workplace.
Motivation is therefore a continuous process, since this process is based on 
needs which are unlimited. The process should be in place throughout the global 
organisation to ensure business success.
4.3.3 Markets, competition and regulation
The majority of the world’s economies are classified as market economies with the 
main focus on accumulating capital in the form of financial or physical assets. The 
market economy describes the process as: resources are allocated and goods and 
services are exchanged between producers and consumers. Harrison (2010) describes 
markets as mechanisms for allocating resources in an economy involving the forces 
of supply and demand. It is important to understand what a market is and how it 
differs from an industry. A market involves the exchange of goods and services 
between producers and consumers and it includes goods and services which are 
considered to be competition, goods which have similar uses from the consumer’s 
perspective. An industry, on the other hand, can be defined in terms of goods or 
services that have similar production processes from the producer’s perspective; 

82
Quality in the Office
for example, the motor manufacturing industry that produces automotive products 
including cars, buses and caravans using similar types of plant and machinery and 
similar skills but where products are sold in a variety of different markets.
4.3.4 Cost management
Policies, procedures and approaches to engaging in the global environment impact 
on the long-term success of a business. Organisations strive to reduce operational 
costs and to strengthen their competitive position globally. However, rapid advances 
in information technology, improvements in manufacturing processes, an increased 
emphasis on both financial and non-financial measures of performance and the 
rise of global competition have made it possible and necessary for organisations to 
strategically manage their costs. Cost management methods and practices should 
be in place to help organisations reach their ultimate goals and objectives in the 
global environment.
In all competitive business environments, organisations should make 
fundamental decisions with respect to how they position their products or services 
in the marketplace to ensure their long-term survival and growth (Newlands & 
Hooper, 2009). In essence, the focus of global enterprises is on competition and 
competitive advantage. Consider national differences that include labour prices, 
availability and proximity to raw materials, trained workers and the overall business 
climate in particular countries, including the availability of tax and other financial 
incentives that allow organisations to operate successfully.
Cross-border financial activities are inevitable for the functioning of organisations 
that trade in the global market. How do you perform financial transactions such as 
the payment of products and services with the use of technology? Organisations 
such as eBay and OLX, for example, provide online marketplaces for the sale of 
goods and services, online payment services and online communication channels 
to a diverse community of individuals and business internationally. They operate 
in two segments, namely marketplaces and payments. Marketplaces provide the 
infrastructure to enable online commerce on various platforms, including the 
traditional eBay.com and the familiar Gumtree.com platforms. These platforms 
include traditional auction and fixed-price facilities as well as stores that provide 
various tools for sellers to build, manage, promote and track their business. 
Services comprise trust and safety programs, feedback forums, verify-rights owner 
programs, PowerSeller programs, customer support and tools and services. A 
payment segment offers PayPal, a payments platform that enables individuals or 
businesses with an email address to send and receive payments online. Its services 
include joining the network, verification of PayPal account holders, withdrawing 
funds and trust and safety programs (Wibbeke, 2009). Trade beyond borders is 
fairly safe and easy with technology-related innovations.

83
The global business environment
4.3.5 Innovation and quality
Technology and innovation are the prime drivers of the globalising economy. 
Innovation processes enable the organisation to renew and maintain its core 
competence, even if that shifts over the organisation’s lifespan. It is not enough for 
an organisation to be aware of various kinds of changes; it has to find new and 
innovative ways of dealing with them. It is not enough to perceive opportunities 
and envision brilliant ideas; the organisation must continually recreate itself from 
concept to manifest form. Adjustments must be made, of course, based on local and 
international customs as people’s future orientation can affect how they go about 
innovative thinking.
It is necessary to distinguish between the concepts of invention and innovation. 
Invention is the discovery and unique one-off design that is not sold commercially. 
It is the integration of existing elements to create a device that serves a purpose 
and that is original. Innovation is not a discovery of an invention. The successful 
development and launch of new products and features is regarded as innovation 
and includes the processes of taking an invention, discovery or new technology 
and converting it into a viable commercial product that can be released for sale. 
Innovations can be seen in how products are assembled and how work is done. 
Think about KFC … their initial innovation was to deliver roasted chicken fast and 
effectively to satisfy the demand for chicken without having to prepare it yourself. 
We can include McDonalds and Burger King in the list and when travelling across 
the globe you are likely to find those franchises.
4.4 Factors to consider before going global
In your administrative capacity, you may be working for a company that decides to 
expand its borders. Delaney (2004) outlines twenty critical factors for consideration 
to improve your chances of global success.
Factor 1: Obtain company-wide commitment
Employees involved should be participating members of the international team, 
from the executives to customer service and staff working in the engineering, 
purchasing, production and dispatching departments.
Factor 2: Define the business plan to access global markets
An international business plan is crucial in order to define a company’s present 
status, internal goals as well as commitment. It is furthermore necessary if one 
plans to measure output and results.

84
Quality in the Office
Factor 3: Determine your investment limits
How much can be afforded when investing in any international expansion efforts? 
Pre-determine your limits to ensure that you stay within a realistic budget.
Factor 4: Allow ample time for world market penetration
Time and patience are necessary to build a successful and durable global enterprise. 
Be patient and plan carefully for the future.
Factor 5: Design a website and implement international plans wisely
A number of organisations offer affordable packages to design websites, but 
remember to decide in which language you will be communicating. English is the 
most commonly used language in the world, but only a small percentage of the 
European population can communicate in English and in most of Africa, South 
America and Asia the figures are even lower. It is advisable to approach the global 
arena without too high expectations, and build a website that is user friendly and 
that allows everyone to be able to understand the message that you would like to 
convey.
Factor 6: Select a service or product to be exposed abroad
It is important that your service or product is unique and satisfies the market that 
you have decided on. It is difficult to satisfy everybody. Be the expert in what you 
deliver.
Factor 7: Conduct market research to identify target markets
Determine where in the world your product will be in demand. Market research is a 
powerful tool to explore and identify the fastest-growing and most suitable market 
for your service or product.
Factor 8: Gather enough data and information
Collect all the necessary information that you might need to predict how your 
product will sell in the specific country that you have in mind. Do research that will 
enable you to establish how much you will be able to sell over a pre-determined 
period of time.
Factor 9: Prepare the product to be exported
Expect to adapt your product or service to meet the global demand. How products 
are packaged plays an important role in enabling international networks. Your 
packaging should be unique to help ensure success in different global markets.
Quality in the Office for IT Professionals

85
The global business environment
Factor 10: Identify potential cross-border customers
Identify your customers first otherwise you will not be able to do any business 
overseas. They will, after all, determine your success.
Factor 11: Determine whether a direct or indirect method of export will be 
                the best
Your export strategy should include the level of control you would like to have 
over your ventures. See an opportunity and adapt your strategy to the different 
scenarios that might present themselves.
Factor 12: Hire experts in your field
Request the services of a good lawyer, banker, a knowledgeable accountant and a 
transport specialist in international trade. Although you might not be able to afford 
them initially, you cannot function successfully on the global playing field without 
them. 
Factor 13: Establish pricing and landed costs
Test the price of your goods and services on your potential customers. Look at the 
reaction you get and then negotiate everything from that particular point onwards.
Factor 14: Terms, conditions and financing options should be identified
Point out the terms of payment in advance and avoid the temptation to sell anything 
on open account to a new customer.
Factor 15: Documentation and export licensing procedures must be in place
Be clued up with regard to every country that you do business with. Know their 
licensing procedures when it comes to exporting. Hire an expert that can assist you 
to avoid any future problems. 
Factor 16: Implement a good after-sales service plan
The relationship between the company and the customer abroad should not end 
once sales are made. It should be the start of a long relationship. If you treat 
customers with the necessary respect and your product delivers, it will ensure that 
they make use of your business again. Facebook and Twitter are handy tools when 
it comes to relationship building.

86
Quality in the Office
Factor 17: Make personal contact
Make personal contact with your new targets, armed with culture-specific 
information and courtesies, professionalism and consistency. Your goal should be 
to enter a different culture, adapt to it and make it your own.
Factor 18: Investigate international business travel tips
The practical aspects of international business can make or break the success 
of your trip. In preparing to go boldly where you have never gone before plan 
accordingly and do your research.
Factor 19: Explore cross-border alliances and partnerships
In charting your global strategy, consider joining forces with another company of 
similar size and market presence that is located in a foreign country where you are 
already doing business, or would like to do business.
Factor 20: Enjoy your endeavour
You are the most important and valuable business asset to your business and 
remember that the human touch is even more valuable in our technology-driven 
era. Look after yourself, your employees, your suppliers and your customers and a 
bright and prosperous future lies ahead.
4.5 Potential benefits and shortcomings of global business
Economic growth is increased through globalisation and produces a wider range of 
products and services. The rise of globalisation has created interdependent markets 
that focus on the benefits and shortcomings of leveraging foreign exchange. 
Supporters of global business argue that mutual benefits originate from the 
specialisation of products and services. The general attitude is that the benefits 
of globalisation overshadow possible economic and social costs by achieving 
higher efficiency as well as boosting gross domestic product (GDP) growth in 
underdeveloped regions (Boundless.com, 2014). We have to consider the benefits of 
global business to the economy as well as the drawbacks it might have on society.
4.5.1 Benefits
Potential benefits of globalisation to national and international business 
environments are outlined below.
Increased wealth
Globalisation has an impact on how developing countries become wealthier. During 
the 1960s, non-globalised economies grew at an annual rate of 1.4 per cent while 
Quality in the Office for IT Professionals

87
The global business environment
globalised economies grew at a significantly higher rate of 4.7 per cent. Another 
link between globalisation and GDP was seen in the 1990s when developing 
countries had 5.0 per cent annual growth compared to only 2.2 per cent annual 
growth in economies that had been globalised for longer. This relationship between 
globalisation and annual growth demonstrates possible benefits of international 
trade, economic development and general standards of living.
Globalisation allows worldwide access to different sources of relatively 
inexpensive raw materials, and allows businesses to be cost competitive in their 
own specialised markets as well as in markets abroad. This process is referred 
to as global sourcing and as a result of cost reductions and increased revenue, 
globalisation can generate increased profits for shareholders involved (Economics 
online, 2014).
Rise of political philosophies
Globalisation has given rise to a number of political philosophies that are based 
on the assumption that free markets follow a natural route towards democratic 
and capitalist philosophies. Firstly, these political perspectives signify an overall 
improvement in standards of living and secondly, the correlation between 
globalisation and these principles is noteworthy and can be measured. Through 
increased global trade, political stability and job opportunities, technological 
progress and equality increase.
Improved quality of life
Globalisation allows countries the benefit of the extensive availability of global 
goods, services and ideas that positively impact the lifestyles of nations. Areas 
where globalisation benefits nations include:
 
access to external financing such as car and home loans;
 
opportunities to international travel and tourism;
 
opportunities for work overseas due to liberal immigrant laws and foreign worker 
programmes;
 
a greater influx of world entertainment including music, sports, trends and pop 
culture; and
 
the rapid spread of consumer products (such as food and clothing brands) to other 
countries.
The development of a global telecommunications infrastructure and better 
trans-border flow of data through the use of technologies such as the Internet, 
communication satellites and wireless telephones are also among the lifestyle 
benefits due to globalisation (Boundless.com, 2014).

88
Quality in the Office
Availability of foreign goods
Globalisation leads to the increased availability of diverse products, services 
and technology. Through pooling knowledge and exchanging more goods and 
services, domestic economies expand and benefit from technological and medical 
developments. This increase in variety, even in basic goods, allows someone in 
South Africa to drink French or Australian wine and eat Dutch cheese while typing 
on a Japanese keyboard. Global exchange can allow the best of all worlds through 
specialisation and maximising various comparative advantages that involve quality 
or efficiency.
Globalisation theorises that a wider selection of products, services, technologies, 
medicines and knowledge become available and that these developments have the 
potential to reach significantly larger customer bases. This means larger volumes 
of sales and exchange, larger growth rates in GDP and more empowerment of 
individuals and political systems through acquiring additional resources and 
capital.
4.5.2 Shortcomings
This section outlines identified potential shortcomings of globalisation:
 
Over-standardisation of products through global branding. For example, the 
majority of the world’s computers use Windows operating systems developed 
by Microsoft. The process of standardisation of computer operating systems 
and platforms results in significant benefits but also results in a lack of product 
diversity and presents barriers to small and local producers to enter the market.
 
Large multinational businesses may also suffer from diseconomies of scale, 
such as problems associated with the process of co-ordinating the activities of 
companies located in several countries.
 
Increased influence and power of international businesses. For example, large 
multinational organisations can shift their investments between different 
locations searching for the most favourable regulatory regimes. Multinational 
businesses can dominate local labour and enforce remuneration that is lower 
than the free market equilibrium.
 
Potential loss of jobs in domestic markets as a result of increased and unfair free 
trade.
 
Increased levels of deindustrialisation that contribute to the slow erosion of an 
economy’s industrial base.
 
Careers may be lost as a result of the structural changes that arise from 
globalisation; this may lead to unemployment and may also widen the gap 
between the wealthy and poor within a particular country.
Quality in the Office for IT Professionals

89
The global business environment
 
Increased risk related to the interdependence of economies. Countries may be 
more and more dependent on each other; a negative economic shock can have a 
negative influence on other countries involved.
 
Over-specialisation is another risk related to globalisation. A sudden downturn 
in world demand for a specific product can plunge an economy into a recession. 
A number of developing countries suffer as a result of over-specialising within a 
limited range of products, for example agriculture and tourism.
 
Winners and losers are identified and inequality might increase with wealthier 
countries that benefit more than poorer countries.
 
Increased trade leads to increased pollution that contributes to CO2 emissions as 
well as global warming. Trade growth has also accelerated the exhaustion of non-

4.6 Arranging for executives to travel internationally
Between germ-laden aircraft, dining out, jetlag, countless handshakes and long 
hours, the chances of your executive catching a bug while travelling are pretty 
high. Flu, a nasty cold or a serious illness could put a serious damper on your 
executive’s travel plans and his/her productivity. There is no way to guarantee your 
executive won’t run into a health hiccup while he or she is away from the office. 
However, there are several things you and the executive can do before, during and 
after the trip to stay healthy. Perrine (2013) outlines a few key factors that you 
should keep in mind when planning a trip for your manager or executive abroad:
4.6.1 Learn about the destination
Find out what diseases are common in the country or area where your executive 
will be staying. It is also a good idea to check whether the area is prone to natural 
disasters or experiencing any safety or security warnings. Some countries have 
different cultural or local laws, so make sure to investigate those as well.
4.6.2 Visit the doctor
For international travel, your executive should visit a doctor who specialises in travel 
health four to eight weeks before his/her departure. A specialist can administer any 
vaccinations for the trip as well as prescribe the medications your executive needs 
while travelling. Remind him or her to bring his/her current vaccination record, list 
of medications, and travel itinerary to the appointment. Also, if your executive is 
travelling internationally, make sure his or her health insurance provides coverage 
for overseas incidents.

4.6.3 Pack wisely
Create a packing list that includes everything your executive will need during the 
trip. The list should include all necessary travel documents, such as a passport, 
visas, travel itinerary and contact information for the local embassy or consulate. It 
should also include a travel health kit with prescriptions, travel-related medications 
and over-the-counter medicine for intestinal issues, pain relief, motion sickness, 
allergies and colds/flu.
4.6.4 Avoid common health issues
If your executive is flying, especially for more than eight hours, encourage him or 
her to walk around every couple of hours to aid circulation and avoid blood clots. 
To prevent stomach issues, only eat food that is piping hot and do not consume 
raw food. International travellers should only drink bottled water and avoid ice in 
drinks.
4.6.5 Pay attention after the trip
If your executive is not feeling well after a trip, he or she should see their doctor 
and inform him or her of their recent travels. People visiting areas prone to malaria 
should continue taking their anti-malaria medication upon their return to prevent 
infection. Malaria symptoms can take up to a year to appear, so tell your executive 
to seek medical attention if he or she feels ill.
Between the exposure to germs, close contact with people and changes in sleep 
and eating schedules, travelling can significantly increase your executive’s chances 
of getting sick. Arm him or her with these travel tips – and maybe some Vitamin C – 
and help keep him or her healthy while away from home.
4.7 Summary
This chapter outlined the important trend facing many companies with specific 
reference to the global marketplace. Driven by competitive pressures, lowered trade 
barriers and advances in information technologies, the number of organisations 
offering products and services in multiple countries is increasing rapidly. Managing 
worldwide operations is challenging. Management must choose appropriate 
strategic orientations for operating across cultures and geographical locations, and 
consider diverse governmental and environmental requirements. Corporate policies 
and procedures should be adapted to cover a range of local conditions. Tasks that 
involve the controlling and co-ordination of operations in different countries 
place heavy demands on information and control systems. The possible benefits 
and shortcomings of globalisation were discussed. The tasks of the administrative 
employee are embedded in all theory that was discussed.
