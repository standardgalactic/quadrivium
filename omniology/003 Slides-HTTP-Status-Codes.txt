HTTP Status codes
●
All HTTP response status codes are separated into five classes (or categories) 
●
The first digit of the status code defines the class of response
There are five values for the first digit:
●
1xx (Informational): The request was received, continuing process 
●
2xx (Successful): The request was successfully received, understood, and accepted 
●
3xx (Redirection): Further action needs to be taken in order to complete the request 
●
4xx (Client Error): The request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled 
●
5xx (Server Error): The server failed to fulfill an apparently valid request
