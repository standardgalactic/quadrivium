●
Some rational numbers can not be represented using a ﬁnite number of digits (e.g. 1/3)
●
Numbers in a computer are represented using bits, not decimal digits, so instead of 
powers of 10 it uses powers of 2
●
Some decimal numbers have a ﬁnite binary representation and that means an exact ﬂoat 
representation (e.g 0.125 or ⅛) , and other an inﬁnite binary representation and that 
means an approximate ﬂoat representation (e.g. 0.1 ora 1/10)
●
We can’t use the == operator to check the equality of ﬂoats. We must use the isclose( ) 
function of the math module or the decimal module
>>> a  = 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1
>>> b = 0.3
>>> a == b
False
>>> from  math import isclose
>>> isclose(a, b)
True
