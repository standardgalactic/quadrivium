Show that the only eigenvalue for K is 0.
Find an orthonormal basis for ker(K).

1. Hilbert-Smith operators
Example 1.5 Let K denote the Hilbert-Schmidt operator with continuous kernel k on L2(I), where
I is a closed and bounded interval. Show that all the iterated kernels Kn are continuous on I2 and
show that
∥kn∥2 ≤∥k∥n
2.
Show that if |λ| ∥k∥2 < 1, then the series
∞

n=1
λn kn
is convergent in L2(I).
Write I = [a, b]. It is well-known that
kn(x, t) =
 b
a
f(x, s) kn−1(s, t) ds.
The ﬁrst claim is proved by induction. Assume that both k(x, s) and kn−1(s, t) are continuous. By
subtracting something and then adding it again we get
kn(x, t) −kn(x0, t0)
=
 b
a
{k(x, s)kn−1(s, t) −k(x0, s)kn−1(s, t)} ds
+
 b
a
{k(x0, s)kn−1(s, t) −k(x0, s)kn−1(s, t0)} ds

+
 b
a
k(x0, s) · {kn−1(s, t) −kn−1(s, t0)} ds.
To every ε > 0 there is a δ > 0, such that
|k(x, s) −k(x0, s)| < ε
for |x −x0| < δ and all s ∈[a, b],
and
|kn−1(s, t) −kn−1(s, t0)| < ε
for |t −t0| < δ and all s ∈[a, b].
If therefore |x −x0| < δ and |t −t0| < δ, then we get the following estimate,
|kn(x, t) −kn(x0, t0)|
≤
 b
a
ε · ∥kn−1∥∞dx +
 b
a
∥k∥∞· ε ds
=
(b −a) {∥k∥∞+ ∥kn−1∥∞} ε,
and we conclude that kn(x, t) is continuous, and the claim follows by induction.

Example 1.6 Let K and L denote the Hilbert-Schmidt operators with continuous kernels k and ℓon
L2(I), where I is a closed and bounded interval. We deﬁne the trace of K, tr(K) by
tr(K) =

and similarly for K.
Show that

Moreover, if (Kn), (Ln) denote sequences of Hilbert-Schmidt operators like above, where
∥Kn −K∥HS →0
and
∥Ln −L∥HS →0,
then
tr (KnLn) →tr(KL).
Remark 1.1 We ﬁrst show that the claim is not true, if we replace the Hilbert-Schmidt norm ∥·∥HS
by the operator norm.
Let
k(x, t) = ℓ(x, t) = x + t
be the kernel of self adjoint Hilbert-Schmidt operators K and L on L2([0, 1]). It follows from Exam-

Recall for n = 1 that

Choosing k(x, x) = 1 and k(x, t) continuous, such that ∥k∥2 < ε, we get
tr(K) = b −a

∥K∥2

which shows that the formula is not true for n = 1.

{k(x, x) + λ ℓ(x, x)} dx = tr(K) + λ tr(L),
proving that the trace is linear on the vector space of all Hilbert-Schmidt operators. Then we get

=
tr (K (L −Ln)) + tr ((K −Kn) Ln)

then the operator K is described by

however, not waste our time on that, because the result will look extremely nasty.

1. Hilbert-Smith operators
It follows from k(t, x) = k(x, t) that K is self adjoint, so the null-space is simply the orthogonal
complement of the subspace mentioned above. Thus we conclude that ker(K) is spanned by
sin x, sin 2x, cos 3x, sin 3x, cos 4x, sin 4x, . . . ,
i.e. of the usual trigonometric basis with the exception of 1, cos x and cos 2x.
Example 1.10 Let K denote a self adjoint Hilbert-Schmidt operator on L2(I) with kernel k.
Show that ∥K∥= ∥k∥2 if and only if the spectrum for K consists of at most two points.
It follows from K being self adjoint that k(t, x) = k(x, t) and there exist an ortonormal sequence (ϕn)
in L2(I) and a sequence (λn) of real numbers with |λ1| ≥|λ2| ≥· · · , where either λn = 0 eventually,
or λn →0, such that
(6) Ku =
+∞

n=1
λn (u, ϕn) ϕn
for u ∈L2(I),
where every ϕn is an eigenfunction of the corresponding λn ∈σp(K), and where 0 is either an
eigenvalue or belongs to the continuous spectrum σc(K), and where
σ(K) = {0} ∪σp(K).
We shall prove that ∥K∥= ∥k∥2, if and only if σ(K) contains at most two points.
1) If σ(K) only consists of one point, then σ(K) = {0}, and Ku ≡0, thus k(x, t) = 0 almost
everywhere, and it follows trivially that ∥K∥= ∥k∥1 = 0.
2) If σ(K) contains two points, then it follows from the introducing argument that we necessarily
must have
σ(M) = {0, λ},
so the operator is described by
Ku = (u, ϕ) ϕ = λ
 b
a
ϕ(x) ϕ(t) u(t) dt,
from which we derive that
k(x, t) = λ ϕ(t)ϕ(x).
Clearly, ∥K∥= λ. Because ∥ϕ∥2 = 1, we get
∥k∥2

Hence ∥k∥2 = |λ| = ∥K∥in this case.
3) If σ(K) contains more than two points, then
∥K∥= max |λn| = |λ1| .

1. Hilbert-Smith operators
Example 1.11 Let {e1, e2, . . . , ep} denote a ﬁnite orthonormal set in L2(I), and let the Hilbert-
Schmidt operator K be given by the kernel
k(x, y) =


i=1


j=1
kij ei(x) ej(t).
Find the trace tr(K).
We say that the operator K has a canonical kernel of ﬁnite rank.
This example is trivial,

Note that this corresponds to the trace of matrix (kij).
Example 1.12 Denote by K a self adjoint Hilbert-Schmidt operator on L2(I) of kernel k.
Prove that K is a general Hilbert-Schmidt operator (cf. the deﬁnition in Example 1.1), and ﬁnd the
Hilbert-Schmidt norm ∥K∥HS.
Put
Ku =


n=1
λn (u, ϕn) ϕn.
It follows from Ventus, Hilbert spaces etc., Example 2.7 that
tjk = (Kϕj, ϕk) =
 +∞

n=1
λn (ϕj, ϕn) ϕn, ϕk
!
= (λj ϕj, ϕk) = λj δjk,
thus tjj = λj and tjk = 0 for j ̸= 0.
Then by Example 1.1, K is a general Hilbert-Schmidt operator, if
+∞

j=1


k=1
|tjk|2 < +∞,
because it was proved that this number is independent of the choice of orthonormal basis. Furthermore,

Example 1.13 Let

be the kernel for a Hilbert-Schmidt operator K on the complex Hilbert space L2([−π, π]).
Show that K is self adjoint and express the range K

Solve the equation Ku = π u −5π

1) Clearly, k(x, t) ∈L2([−π, π] × [−π, π]), and
k(t, x) = (sin t + sin x)2 −1
8 = k(x, t),
thus k(x, t) is Hermitian, and K is a self adjoint Hilbert-Schmidt-operator. It follows from

and we conclude that the range K

is spanned by 1, sin x and cos 2x.
(Choose e.g. suitable linear combinations of these three functions in order to conclude that the
dimension is 3).
2) An eigenfunction f corresponding to an eigenvalue λ ̸= 0 must necessarily lie in the range, thus it
is of the form
f(x) = a · cos 2x + b · sin x + c,
a, b, c ∈C.

We have for comparison,
λ f(x) = λ a · cos 2x + λ b · sin x + λ c · 1.
The coeﬃcient b occurs only in connection with sin x, hence we conclude that sin x is an eigen-
function corresponding to the eigenvalue λ = 2π.
Assume that b = 0. If a · cos 2x + c is an eigenfunction, then the vectors

ϕ2(x) = cos 2x −2,
λ3 = −π

ϕ3(x) = cos 2x + 1

Notice that λ1 = λ2,and that the eigenfunctions are not normed.

Method 1a. A variant of the First method is to guess a solution of the form

thus a = 1 and c = −1, and the unique solution is given by

Second method. It is also possible to apply the standard method. A straightforward computa-
tion where we explicitly use the previously found eigenfunctions (these should then be normed),
would demand a lot of energy, although one at diﬀerent stages could apply one of the two vari-
ants above.
We shall show below how this might be carried out. First put

ϕ2(x) = cos 2x −2,

Show that K is self adjoint and determine the range K(H).
Find all non-zero eigenvalues and corresponding eigenfunctions for K, and determine σ(K) as well

It is obvious that f given in this way is continuous, when g ∈C1. The proof will be concluded, if
we can prove that the additional condition g(0) = g(2π) combined with (9) implies (8). The trick

Alternatively one may compute explicitly,
Kf(x) = −i K(g′)(x) −1

and then convince oneself by some partial integration that the result is g(x). ♦

Consider the operator
Af(x) =

f(t)
√x −t dt,
x ∈[0, 1],
whenever this expression gives sense.
1) Show that Af ∈L∞([0, 1]) if f ∈Lp([0, 1]), p > 2.
2) Find the operator B = A2, that is ﬁnd the kernel k(x, t) such that
Bf(x) = A2f(x) =
 x
0
k(x, t) f(t) dt
for f ∈Lp([0, 1]), p > 2.
3) Show that B : Lp([0, 1]) →L∞([0, 1]), 1 ≤p ≤∞is bounded.
4) Solve the equation
(I −A)f(x) = 1
formally by a Neumann series, and express f as
f(x) = g(x) + Ah(x),
where g and h are known functions. (Here it is not possible to express Ah(x) as a known function.)
Insert and show that this formal solution is a solution.
Remark 2.1 First note that the kernel does not belong to L2([0, 1]2). In fact, it follows from
k(x, t) =

2) Assume again that f ∈Lp([0, 1]), where p > 2. Then Af ∈L∞([0, 1]) according to (1). From
p1 = ∞> 2 follows by another application of (1) that A2f ∈L∞([0, 1]).

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

2. Other types of integral operators
Alternatively (and more elegantly),
(I −A)(I + A) = (I + A)(I −A) = I −A2 = I −B.
Since B is a Volterra operator, we have that (I −B)−1 = ,+∞
n=0 Bn is bounded. Clearly, A and
B = A2 commutes, so
(I −A)

(I + A)(I −B)−1
=

(I + A)(I −B)−1
(I −A) = I,
proving that
(I −A)−1 = (I + A)(I −B)−1.
Hence the equation (I −A)f = 1 is equivalent to
f(x) = (I −A)−1A(x) = (I + A)

Bn1(x) = (I + A)ex = ex + Aex,
where we have applied the computation above.
Example 2.3 Let H = L2([0, 1]) and consider the integral operator
Bf(x) =
 x
0
f(t) dt,
for f ∈H.
1) Show that
k(x, t) = min{x, t},
0 ≤x, t ≤1,
is the kernel for the self adjoint Hilbert-Schmidt operator K = BB⋆.
2) Let ϕ be an eigenfunction for K associated with a non-zero eigenvalue λ. Justify that ϕ can be
taken as a C∞-function.
Next, show that ϕ must satisfy the equation
λ ϕ′′(x) = −ϕ(x),
and use this to ﬁnd all non-zero eigenvalues for K and all the associated eigenfunctions.
3) Assuming the ∥BB⋆∥= ∥B⋆|2, show that ∥K∥= ∥B∥2, and ﬁnd both ∥K∥and ∥B∥.
1) The operator B has the kernel
b(x, t) =
 1
for 0 ≤t ≤x ≤1,
0
otherwise,
so
b⋆(x, t) = b(t, x) = b(t, x) =

for 0 ≤x ≤t ≤1,
0
otherwise.
Then the kernel k(x, t) for K = BB⋆is given by

2) Since k(x, t) is continuous, we can choose the eigenfunctions continuous.
Hence, if ϕ(x) is an
eigenfunction corresponding to an eigenvalue λ ̸= 0, then
(10) λλ ϕ(x) =
 1
0
k(x, t) ϕ(t) dt =
 x
0
t ϕ(t) dt + x

ϕ(t) dt.
If ϕ is continuous, then the right hand side of (10) is diﬀerentiable. If ϕ is of class C n, then the
right hand side of (10) is of class Cn+1, hence ϕ is also of class Cn+1. Then the claim follows by
induction, hence ϕ ∈C∞.
When we diﬀerentiate (10), we get
λ ϕ′(x) = x ϕ(x) +
 1
x
ϕ(t) dt −x ϕ(x) =
 1
x
ϕ(t) dt,
hence by another diﬀerentiation,
(11) λ ϕ′′(x) = −ϕ(x),
and the claim is proved.
3) Let α ∈C \ {0} satisfy the condition α2 = 1
λ. Then the equation (11) has the complete solution
(12) ϕ(x) = C1eiαx + C2e−iαx.
When (12) is put into (10), and we apply that 1
α2 = λ, then

This equation holds for every x, and λ ̸= 0 and α ̸= 0, so we conclude that
C1 + C2 = 0

C1eiα −C2e−iα = 0,
hence C2 = −C1, and C1

1) If f ∈C([0, 1]), then we get immediately that Kf is of class C1([0, 1]) and
(Kf)′(x) =

f(t) dt + x f(x) −x f(x) =

f(t) dt.
This shows that we even have (Kf)′ ∈C1([0, 1]), hence Kf ∈C2([0, 1]), and
(13) (Kf)′′(x) = f(x).
Furthermore,
(Kf)′(0) =

2) Now, K is linear, hence K is injective, If Kf(x) ≡0 implies that f = 0. This follows from (13) in
(1), because
f(x) = (Kf)′′(x) = 0.
Assume that u ∈C2([0, 1]) satisﬁes u′(0) = 0 and u(1) = u′(1). We shall prove that there is an
f ∈C([0, 1]), for which u = Kf. According to (13) the only possibility is f = u′′, which we now
check. Using that u′′ ∈C([0, 1]), we get

x = u′(1) −u(1) + u(x) = u(x),
and the claim is proved.
3) We get from the expression for Kf that
Kf(x) =

k(x, t) f(t) dt =
 x
0
f(t) dt +
 1

max{x, t} f(t) dt,
thus
k(x, t) = max{x, t}
for x, t ∈[0, 1],
and k(x, t) is clearly continuous in [0, 1]2, hence of class L2 
[0, 1]2
.
We note that k(x, t) = k(t, x), hence the kernel is Hermitian and K is a self adjoint Hilbert-Schmidt
operator.
4) This is trivial. We know that K is injective, so 0 /∈σp(K), and if λ ∈σp(K), λ ̸= 0, and Kϕ = λ ϕ,
it follows by an application of K−1 that
ϕ = λ K−1ϕ,
i.e.
K−1ϕ = 1

5) Assume that ϕ and ψ are eigenvectors for K with the same eigenvalue λ. Then
f(x) = ψ(0) ϕ(x) −ϕ(0) ψ(x)
is also an eigenfunction corresponding to λ, hence f is according to (4) an eigenvector corresponding
to the operator K−1 = d2
dx2 with the eigenvalue 1
λ, so
f ′′(x) = 1
λ f(x).
Now, (Kϕ)′(0) = 0 = λϕ′(0), and analogously for ψ, so we conclude from (1) that
f(0) = ψ(0) ϕ(0) −ϕ(0) ψ(0) = 0
and
f ′(0) = ψ(0) ϕ −(0) −ϕ(0) ψ′(0) = 0.
It follows from the existence and uniqueness theorem for linear second order diﬀerential equations
that
(14) d2f
dx2 −1
λ f(x) = 0,
f(0) = 0,
f ′(0) = 0,
does only have the solution f(x) ≡0, hence
(15) ψ(0) ϕ(x) = ϕ(0) ψ(x).
Then assume that ϕ(0) = 0 for every eigenfunction.
Then also ϕ′(0) = 0, cf. the above, so
ϕ is a solution of (14), and ϕ ≡0. This means that ϕ is not an eigenfunction, contradicting
the assumption. Therefore, we conclude that ϕ(0) ̸= 0 for every eigenfunction. Then it follows
from (15) that all eigenfunctions of the same eigenvalue are mutually proportional, hence every
eigenspace for K has dimension 1.
6) When we use that K is self adjoint and of Hilbert-Schmidt type, cf. (3), we get that all eigenvalues
are real, and

We shall ﬁnd the values of C1, C2 and μ, for which ϕ ∈D

. We compute
ϕ′(x) = μ

C1eμx −C2e−μx
,
and get the conditions (because μ > 0)
ϕ′(0) = μ {C1 −C2} = 0,
i.e. C1 = C2 = C,
and
ϕ(1) = C

eμ + e−μ

eμ −e−μ
= ϕ′(1),
so μ is a solution of the equation
cosh μ = μ sinh μ,
which we write as
coth μ = μ.
Considering the graphs we see that this equation has only one solution μ > 0.
Remark 2.3 Using the iteration

we get on a pocket calculator that
μ ≈1.199 678 640.

Now, let f denote an eigenfunction for K associated with the eigenvalue λ. Calculate

justify that it belongs to H and show that f is a solution to the equation
λ2f ′′ + f = 0.
5) Find all eigenvalues and associated eigenfunctions for K.
6) Determine ∥K∥.
1) Apply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality in L2([1 −x, 1]) for f ∈H. This gives

f(t) dt =

that
k(x, t) = 1[1−x,1](t) =

x ∈[0, 1],

otherwise.
Hence, k(x, t) = 1, if and only if x + t ≥1, x, t ∈[0, 1], and 0 otherwise, i.e. if and only if
(x, t) ∈B = {(x, t) ∈[0, 1]2 | x + t ≥1},
so we get (cf. the ﬁgure)
k(x, t) = 1B(x, t) = 1B(t, x) = k(t, x),

This provides us with the bounds
1 −x ≤s ≤1
and
1 −t ≤s ≤1,
hence s ≤1 and
s ≥max{1 −x, 1 −t} = 1 −min{x, t}.

4) If Kf = λ f, then of course
K2f = λ Kf = λ2f,
so if f is an eigenfunction for K corresponding to the eigenvalue λ, then f is an eigenfunction for
K2 corresponding to the eigenvalue λ2.
We get, the kernel for K2 being k2,
K2f(x) =

2. Other types of integral operators
If f is an eigenvalue for K corresponding to the eigenvalue λ, i.e. Kf = λ f, then it follows from
the above that

K2f

(x) = λ2f(x)
and f is diﬀerentiable. It follows by induction that f is inﬁnitely often diﬀerentiable, so we get
from the above that
λ2 f ′′(x) =

K2f
′′ (x) = −f(x),
hence by a rearrangement,
(16) λ2f ′′(x) + f(x) = 0.
Therefore, if f is an eigenfunction for K with eigenvalue λ, then f must also fulﬁl (16).
In
particular, λ ̸= 0, if f is an eigenfunction. It is well-known that the solutions of (16) are
f(x) = c1 exp
 i
λ x

+ c2 exp

−i


.
From K2f(0) = 0 = λ2f(0) follows that f(0) = 0, so we conclude that c1 + c2 = 0. Putting
c1 = c
2i, we get c2 = −c
2i, and the only possibility of an eigenfunction is

5) It remains to ﬁnd the possible eigenvalues λ.
Put c = 1 and α = 1
λ. It follows from Kf(x) = λ f(x) that
f(x) = sin
$x
λ

= sin(α x) = 1
λ Kf(x) = α · K sin(α·)(x),
hence by insertion into the deﬁnition of K,
sin(α x)
=

1−x
sin(α t) dt = [−cos(αt)]1
1−x = cos(α(1 −x)) −cos α
=
cos α · cos αx + sin α · sin αx −cos α,
so
(1 −sin α) sin αx = cos α · (cos αx −1).
This equation is fulﬁlled for all x, if either α = 0, which is not possible because α = 1
λ, or if
cos α = 0 and sin α = 1, hence
