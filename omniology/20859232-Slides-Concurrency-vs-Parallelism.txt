Concurrency IS NOT Parallelism 
●
Concurrency means loading more goroutines at a time. If one goroutine blocks, another 
one is picked up and started. On single core CPU you can run ONLY concurrent 
applications but they are not run in parallel. 
●
Parallelism means multiple goroutines executed at the same time. It requires multiple 
CPUs.
●
Concurrency means independently executing processes or dealing with multiple things at 
once, while parallelism is the simultaneous execution of processes and require multiple 
core CPUs.
