Introduction
S
peaking more than one language is like living more
than one life, one of the ancient philosophers said.
And it’s true — traveling in a foreign country such as
Russia suddenly becomes a lot more exciting when
you can engage in elegant small talk with a hotel
receptionist, compliment your tour guide’s dress, or
actually read the menu and order the food that you
really want. Being able to ask for things instead of
pointing at them, and being able to get directions
from the locals instead of staring at a map, are some
of the little things that make you feel at home.
You don’t even need to cross the ocean to immerse
yourself in Russian culture; you can find little Russian
neighborhoods (or even pretty big ones!) in many
American cities. Whether your colleagues, your neigh-
bors, or your friends speak Russian, the best way to
win their hearts is to speak their language to them.
Now, Russian Phrases For Dummies won’t make you a
fluent reader of Dostoevsky in the original (most
Russians themselves need somewhat of a preparation
for that). It will, however, equip you with phrases nec-
essary to function in many real-life situations, from
shopping to visiting the theater. So, buckle up, and
good luck on your journey! Or, as the Russians like to
say, Zhelayem vam udachi! (zhih-lah-eem vahm oo-
dah-chee; We wish you good luck!)
About This Book
The best thing about Russian Phrases For Dummies is
that you don’t have to read all the way through it to
get the information you need. You can open the table
of contents, find the section that interests you at the

Russian Phrases For Dummies 
2
moment, and start talking! You don’t have to read the
previous chapters to understand any of the sections
of this book.
Another thing you don’t need to do is memorize long
vocabulary lists or grammar rules. We give you ready-
made phrases; you just need to read them and start
using them right away to impress your Russian friends!
Conventions Used in This Book
Here are some conventions that allow you to navigate
through this book with maximum ease:
 We present Russian phrases in transliteration
(Russian sounds represented with English char-
acters). You can see the Cyrillic alphabet in
Chapter 1. Russian terms are easily found in the
text because they’re set in boldface.
 Each Russian word is followed by its pronuncia-
tion and English translation in parentheses. In
each pronunciation, the stressed syllable is in
italics.
A little example to give you an idea of what we mean:
The phrase for “I love you” in Russian is Ya tebya
lyublyu. (ya tee-b’ah l’oo-bl’oo; I love you).
Foolish Assumptions
When we started writing this book, we tried to imag-
ine what our future reader was going to be like. In the
end, we came up with a list of foolish assumptions
about who we think wants to read this book. Do you
recognize yourself in these descriptions?
 You know no Russian — or if you took Russian
in high school or college, you don’t remember a
word of it.

Introduction

 You’re not looking for a book that will make you
fluent in Russian; you just want to know some
words, phrases, and sentence constructions so
that you can communicate basic information in
Russian.
 You don’t want to have to memorize long lists of
vocabulary words or a bunch of boring gram-
mar rules.
 You want to have fun and learn a little bit of
Russian at the same time.
Icons Used in This Book
For your convenience, we marked some information
in this book with special icons. Check out this guide
to the icons, and the next time you see one of them,
you’ll know what to expect!
From famous Russian writers to a polite way
to decline an invitation, this icon marks a
wide variety of curious and useful facts
about Russian culture.
If you’re curious about how the Russian lan-
guage works, and if you want to expand your
command of Russian to the extent of making
up your own phrases, these bits of grammati-
cal information may be of interest to you.
This icon points out some important 
information about Russian that’s worth
remembering.
This icon signals a useful bit of information
that can make life easier for you, whether it’s
a handy way to remember a useful word or
an insider’s advice on how to better handle a
certain situation.
This icon draws your attention to something
you need to know to avoid a common mistake.

Where to Go from Here
Go ahead and start anywhere. You don’t have to read
in a specific order. Just choose a topic that seems
appealing, find the corresponding chapter in the table
of contents, and start speaking Russian!
If you’ve never taken Russian before, you may want
to read Chapters 1 and 2 before tackling the later
chapters. They give you some basics, such as how to
pronounce the sounds.

elcome to Russian! Whether you want to read
a Russian menu, enjoy Russian music, or just
chat it up with your Russian friends, this is the begin-
ning of your journey. In this chapter, you get all the
letters of the Russian alphabet, discover the basic
rules of Russian pronunciation, and say some popular
Russian expressions and idioms.
Looking at the Russian Alphabet
If you’re like most English speakers, you probably think
that the Russian alphabet is the most challenging
aspect of picking up the language. But not to worry.
The Russian alphabet isn’t as hard as you think.
From A to Ya: Making sense of Cyrillic
The Russian alphabet is based on the Cyrillic alpha-
bet, which was named after the ninth-century
Byzantine monk, Cyril. But throughout this book, we
convert all the letters into familiar Latin symbols,
which are the same symbols we use in the English

Russian Phrases For Dummies 
6
alphabet. This process of converting from Cyrillic to
Latin letters is known as transliteration. We list the
Cyrillic alphabet here in case you’re adventurous and
brave enough to prefer reading real Russian instead of
being fed with the ready-to-digest Latin version of it.
And even if you don’t want to read the real Russian,
check out Table 1-1 to find out what the whole fuss is
about regarding the notorious “Russian alphabet.”
Notice that, in most cases, a transliterated
letter corresponds to the way it’s actually
pronounced. As a rule, you may assume that
the transliteration fairly well represents the
actual pronunciation. The biggest exceptions
to this are the letter Jj, which is transcribed
as j but pronounced like an English y, and the
soft sign :;, which is transcribed as ‘ but
only softens the preceding consonant.
Scholars do not agree on the letter j. Some
believe that it’s a consonant; others think
that it’s a vowel. We don’t want to take sides
in this matter and are listing it both as a con-
sonant and a vowel.
Consonants are pronounced softly if they a
re followed by ye, yo, ya, or yu (e, \, q, [).
These letters (ye, yo, ya, and yu) preserve
the y sound if they are at the beginning of 
the word (as in yes, your, yard, and youth).

I know you! Familiar-looking, 
same-sounding letters
You may notice that some of the Russian letters in the
previous section look a lot like English letters. The let-
ters that look like English and are pronounced like
English letters are
 Aa
 Kk
 Mm
 Oo
 Tt
Whenever you read Russian text, you should be able
to recognize and pronounce these letters right away.
Playing tricks: Familiar-looking, 
different-sounding letters
Some Russian letters look like English letters
but are pronounced differently. You want to
watch out for these:
 Vv: It looks like English Bb, at least the capital
letter does, but it’s pronounced like the sound v
as in victor or vase.
 Ee: This one’s a constant annoyance for English
speakers, who want to pronounce it like ee,
as in the English word geese. In Russian, it’s 
pronounced that way only if it appears in an
unstressed syllable. Otherwise, if it appears 
in a stressed syllable, it is pronounced like ye
as in yes.
 |\: Don’t confuse this with the letter Ee. When
two dots appear over the Ee, it’s considered a
different letter, and it’s pronounced like yo as
in your.
 Nn: It’s not the English Hh — it just looks like it.
Actually, it’s pronounced like n as in nick.

Chapter 1: Say It How? Speaking Russian
11
 Rr: In Russian it’s pronounced like a trilled r and
not like the English letter p as in pick.
 Ss: This letter is always pronounced like s as in
sun and never like k as in victor.
 Uu: This letter is pronounced like oo as in shoot
and never like y as in yes.
 Xx: Never pronounce this letter like z or ks as in
the word Xerox. In Russian, the sound it repre-
sents is a coarse-sounding, guttural kh, similar to
the German ch. (See “Surveying sticky sounds,”
later in this chapter, for info on pronouncing
this sound.)
How bizarre: Weird-looking letters
As you’ve probably noticed, quite a few Russian let-
ters don’t look like English letters at all:
 Bb
 Gg
 Dd
 ÚÚ
 Zz
 Ii
 Jj
 Ll
 Pp
 Ff
 Cc
 Hh
 Ww
 }]
 =
 Yy
 ;
 ?/
 {[
 Qq
Don’t panic over these letters. Just because
they look weird doesn’t mean they’re any
harder to say than the others. It’s just a
matter of memorizing their proper pronunci-
ations. (Refer to Table 1-1 for details on how
to say each letter.)
You may recognize several of these weird letters,
such as F, G, ?, L, P, from learning the Greek 
alphabet during your fraternity or sorority days.

Sounding Like a Real Russian
with Proper Pronunciation
Compared to English pronunciation, which often has
more exceptions than rules, Russian rules of pronun-
ciation are fairly clear and consistent.
Understanding the one-letter/
one-sound principle
Russian is a phonetic language, which means
that for the most part one Russian letter cor-
responds to one sound. For example, the
letter K is always pronounced like k, and
the letter M is always pronounced like m.
Giving voice to vowels
Vowels are the musical building blocks of every Russian
word. If you flub a consonant or two, you’ll probably
still be understood. But if you don’t pronounce your
vowels correctly, there’s a good chance you won’t be
understood at all. So it’s a good idea to get down the
basic principles of saying Russian vowels.
That’s stretching it: Lengthening out vowels
If you want to sound more Russian, don’t
shorten your vowels like English speakers
often do. When you say a, o, open your mouth
wider and purposefully stretch out the sounds
to make them a little bit longer. Imagine, for
example, that you’re in your room on the
second floor, and your mom is downstairs in
the kitchen. You call her by saying “Mo-o-o-m!”
That’s the way Russians say their vowels
(except for the shouting part!).

Chapter 1: Say It How? Speaking Russian
13
Some stress is good: Accenting the right vowels
Stress is an important concept in Russian.
Putting a stress in the wrong place isn’t just a
formal mistake. It can hinder communication,
because the meaning of a word can change
based on where the stress is. For example,
the word zamok (zah-muhk) means “castle.”
However, if you shift the stress from the first
syllable to the last, the word zamok (zuh-
mohk) now means “lock.”
Unfortunately, no hard-and-fast rules about
stress exist. Before learning a new Russian
word, find out which vowel to stress. Look in
any Russian-English dictionary, which usu-
ally marks stress by putting the sign ´ over
the stressed syllable. In a dictionary, zamok
(zah-muhk; castle) is written za’mok, and
zamok (zuh-mohk; lock) is written zamo’k.
Vowels misbehavin’: Reduction
Some Russian letters change their behavior
depending on whether they’re in a stressed
or an unstressed syllable. The vowels a, o,
ye, and ya do this a lot. When stressed, they
behave normally and are pronounced in the
usual way, but when they’re in an unstressed
position, they go through a process called
reduction. This deviation in the vowels’ behav-
ior is a very important linguistic phenome-
non that deserves your special attention:
 O, which is normally pronounced like oh,
sounds like ah (like the letter a in the word
father) if it occurs exactly one syllable before
the stressed syllable, and like a neutral uh (like
the letter a in the word about) if it appears in
any other unstressed syllable.
 A, which is pronounced like ah when it’s
stressed, is pronounced like a neutral uh (like
the letter a in the word about) if it appears in
any unstressed syllable.

Russian Phrases For Dummies 
14
The honest-to-goodness truth is that when the
letter a appears in the syllable preceding the
stressed syllable, its pronunciation is some-
where between uh and ah. We don’t, however,
want to burden you with excessive linguistic
information, so we indicate the letter a as uh in
all unstressed positions. Moreover, in conversa-
tional speech, catching the distinction is nearly
impossible. If you say an unstressed a as uh,
people will fully understand you.
 Ye, which is pronounced like ye (as in yet) in a
stressed syllable, sounds like ee (as in seek) in
any unstressed syllable.
When it appears at the end of a word, as in 
viditye (vee-dee-tee; [you] see [plural and
formal singular]), or after another vowel, as in
chayepitiye (chee-ee-pee-tee-eh; tea drinking),
unstressed ye sounds like eh after another
vowel at the end of the word.
 An unstressed ya sounds either like ee (as in
peek) if it’s unstressed (but not in the word’s
final syllable) or like yuh if it’s unstressed in the
final syllable of the word and also preceded by
another vowel or ;; if it is preceded by a conso-
nant, it is pronounced as uh and the preceding
consonant is pronounced softly.
Here are some examples of how vowel reduction
affects word pronunciation:
 You write Kolorado (Colorado) but say kuh-lah-
rah-duh. Notice how the first o is reduced to a
neutral uh and the next o is reduced to an ah
sound (because it’s exactly one syllable before
the stressed syllable), and it’s reduced again to a
neutral uh sound in the final unstressed syllable.
 You write khorosho (good, well) but say khuh-
rah-shoh. Notice how the first o is reduced to a
neutral uh, the next o is reduced to ah (it pre-
cedes the stressed syllable), and o in the last
syllable is pronounced as oh because it’s
stressed.

Chapter 1: Say It How? Speaking Russian
15
 You write napravo (to the right) but say nuh-
prah-vuh. Notice that the first a is reduced to a
neutral uh (because it’s not in the stressed sylla-
ble), the second a is pronounced normally (like
ah) and the final o is pronounced like a neutral
uh, because it follows the stressed syllable.
 You write Pyetyerburg (Petersburg) but say
pee-teer-boork. Notice how ye is reduced to the
sound ee in each case, because it’s not stressed.
 You write Yaponiya (Japan) but say yee-poh-
nee-uh. Notice how the unstressed letter ya
sounds like yee at the beginning of the word
and like ye at the end of the word (because it’s
unstressed and in the final syllable).
Saying sibilants with vowels
The letters zh, ts, ch, sh, and sh’ are called sibilants,
because they emit a hissing sound. When certain
vowels appear after these letters, those vowels are
pronounced slightly differently than normal. After a
sibilant, ye is pronounced like eh (as in end) and yo is
pronounced like oh (as in talk). Examples are the
words tsyentr (tsehntr; center) and shyol (shohl;
went by foot [masculine]). The sound ee always
becomes ih after one of these sibilants, regardless of
whether the ee sound comes from the letter i or from
an unstressed ye before the stressed syllable. Take,
for example, the words mashina (muh-shih-nuh; car)
and shyestoy (shih-stohy; the sixth).
Enunciating consonants correctly
Like Russian vowels, Russian consonants follow cer-
tain patterns and rules of pronunciation. If you want
to sound like a real Russian, you need to keep the
basics in the following sections in mind.
Say it, don’t spray it! Relaxing with consonants
When pronouncing the letters p, t, or k, English
speakers are used to straining their tongue and lips.
This strain results in what linguists call aspiration — a
burst of air that comes out of your mouth as you say

Russian Phrases For Dummies 
16
these sounds. To see what we’re talking about, put
your hand in front of your mouth and say the word
top. You should feel air against your hand as you pro-
nounce the word.
In Russian, however, aspiration shouldn’t
happen because consonants are pronounced
without aspiration. In fact, you should totally
relax your tongue and lips before saying
Russian p, t, or k. To practice saying conso-
nants without unnecessary aspiration, again
put your hand in front of your mouth and say
Russian cognates park (pahrk), lampa (lahm-
puh), and tank (tahnk). Practice until you
don’t produce a puff of air with these words!
Cat got your tongue? Consonants losing their voice
Some consonants (b, v, g, d, zh, and z) are called
voiced consonants because they’re pronounced with
the voice. But when voiced consonants appear at the
end of a word, they actually lose their voice. This
process is called devoicing. They’re still spelled the
same, but in their pronunciation, they transform into
their devoiced counterparts:
 B is pronounced like p.
 V is pronounced like f.
 G is pronounced like k.
 D is pronounced like t.
 Zh is pronounced like sh.
 Z is pronounced like s.
Here are some examples:
 You write Smirnov but pronounce it as smeer-
nohf because v at the end of the word is 
pronounced like f.
 You write garazh (garage) but say guh-rahsh,
because at the end of the word, zh loses its
voice and is pronounced like sh.

Chapter 1: Say It How? Speaking Russian

Nutty clusters: Pronouncing consonant combinations
Russian speech often sounds like an endless flow of
consonant clusters. Combinations of two, three, and
even four consonants are quite common. Take, for
example, the common word for hello in Russian —
zdravstvujtye (zdrah-stvooy-teh), which has two 
difficult consonant combinations (zdr and stv).
Or take the word for opinion in Russian — vzglyad
(vzglyat). The word contains four consonants follow-
ing one another: vzgl.
How in the world do Russians say these
words without choking? They practice, and
so should you. Here are some words that
contain consonant clusters you may want to
repeat at leisure:
 obstoyatyel’stvo (uhp-stah-ya-tehl’-stvuh; 
circumstance)
 pozdravlyat’ (puh-zdruhv-lyat’; to congratulate)
 prestuplyeniye (pree-stoo-plyen-ee-ye; crime)
 Rozhdyestvo (ruzh-deest-voh; Christmas)
 vzdor (vzdohr; nonsense)
 vzglyanut’ (vzglee-noot’; to look/glance)
Surveying sticky sounds
Some Russian letters and sounds are hard for speak-
ers of English. Take a look at some of them and find
out how to pronounce them.
The bug sound zh
This sound corresponds to the letter ÚÚ. It looks
kind of like a bug, doesn’t it? It sounds like a bug, too!
In pronouncing it, try to imitate the noise produced by
a bug flying over your ear — zh-zh-zh . . . The sound is
similar to the sound in the words pleasure or measure.

Russian Phrases For Dummies 
18
The very short i sound
This sound corresponds to the letter Jj. This letter’s
name is i kratkoye, which literally means “a very short
i,” but it actually sounds like the very short English y.
This sound is what you hear when you say the word
boy. You should notice your tongue touching the roof
of your mouth when you say this sound.
The rolled sound r
This sound corresponds to the letter Rr in the Russian
alphabet. To say it correctly, begin by saying an English
r and notice that your tongue is rolled back. Now begin
moving your tongue back, closer to your upper teeth
and try to say this sound with your tongue in this new
position. You’ll hear how the quality of the sound
changes. This is the way the Russians say it.
The guttural sound kh
The corresponding Russian letter is Xx. To say it,
imagine that you’re eating and a piece of food just got
stuck in your throat. What’s the first reflex your body
responds with? Correct! You will try to cough it up.
Remember the sound your throat produces? This is
the Russian sound kh. It’s similar to the German ch.
The revolting sound y
To say this sound correctly, imagine that you’re
watching something really revolting, like an episode
or Survivor, where the participants are gorging on a
plate of swarming bugs. Now recall the sound you
make in response to this. This sound is pronounced
something like ih, and that’s how you pronounce the
Russian y (the transliteration is y). Because this letter
appears in some of the most commonly used words,
including ty (tih; you [informal]), vy (vih; you [formal
singular and plural]), and my (mih; we), it’s important
to say it as best you can.
The hard sign
This is the letter +. Although the soft sign makes the
preceding sound soft (see the next section), the hard

Chapter 1: Say It How? Speaking Russian
19
sign makes it — yes, you guessed it — hard. The good
news is that this letter (which transliterates to ”) is
rarely ever used in contemporary Russian. And even
when it is, it doesn’t change the pronunciation of the
word. So, why does Russian have this sign? For two
purposes:
 To harden the previous consonant
 To retain the hardness of the consonant before
the vowels ye, yo, yu, and ya, which must be
pronounced like at the beginning of the word.
Without the hard sign, these consonants would nor-
mally palatalize (soften). When a hard sign = separates
a consonant and one of these vowels, the consonant
is pronounced without palatalization, as in the word
pod”yezd (pahd-yezd; porch), for example. However,
don’t worry too much about this one if your native
language is English. Native speakers of English rarely
tend to palatalize their Russian consonants the way
Russians do it. In other words, if you’re a native
English speaker and you come across the situation
described here, you probably make your consonant
hard and, therefore, pronounce it correctly by default!
The soft sign
This is the letter ; (transliterated to ’), and it doesn’t
have a sound. Its only mission in life is to make the
preceding consonant soft. This sound is very impor-
tant in Russian because it can change the meaning of
a word. For example, without the soft sign, the word
mat’ (maht’; mother) becomes mat, which means
“obscene language.” And when you add a soft sign
at the end of the word von (vohn; over there), it
becomes von’ (vohn’) and means “stench.” See how
important the soft sign is?
It is also used retain the softness of the consonant
before the vowels ye, yo, yu, and ya, which must be
pronounced as at the beginning of the word — for
example, v’yuga (v’yoo-guh; blizzard). Another very
important function of ; is that it shows the grammati-
cal gender (feminine) if it follows a sibilant at the end

Russian Phrases For Dummies 
20
of the word; in this case, ; does not affect pronuncia-
tion. Compare myech (mehch; sword [masculine])
and noch’ (nohch; night [feminine]).
So, here’s how you can make consonants soft:
1.
Say the consonant — for example, l, t, or d.
Note where your tongue is. What you should feel
is that the tip of your tongue is touching the
ridge of your upper teeth and the rest of the
tongue is hanging in the mouth like a hammock
in the garden on a nice summer day.
2.
While you’re still pronouncing the consonant,
raise the body of your tongue and press it
against the hard palate.
Can you hear how the quality of the consonant
has changed? It sounds much softer now, doesn’t
it? That’s how you make your consonants soft.

ne of the biggest differences between English
and Russian is that English tends to have a
fixed order of words, whereas Russian enjoys a free
order of words.
In English, word order can often determine the mean-
ing of a sentence. For example, in English you say,
“The doctor operated on the patient,” but you never
say, “The patient operated on the doctor.” It just 
doesn’t make sense.
In Russian, you can freely shift around the order of
words in a sentence, because the Russian case system
tells you exactly what role each word plays in the 
sentence. What’s a case? Read on.

Russian Phrases For Dummies 
22
Making the Russian Cases
In a Russian sentence, every noun, pronoun,
and adjective takes a different ending
depending on the case it’s in. Cases are sets
of endings that words take to indicate their
function and relationship to other words in
the sentence. Russian has 6 cases, which
isn’t that bad compared to Finnish, which
has 15.
Nominative case
A noun (or a pronoun or an adjective) always appears
in the nominative case in an English-Russian dictio-
nary. Its main function is to indicate the subject of the
sentence. For example, in the sentence Bryenda
izuchayet russkij yazyk (brehn-duh ee-zoo-chah-eht
roos-keey yee-zihk; Brenda studies Russian), the word
Bryenda, is the subject of the sentence and conse-
quently is used in the nominative case.
Genitive case
Use the genitive case to indicate possession. It answers
the question “Whose?” In the phrase kniga Anny
(knee-guh ah-nih; Anna’s book), Anna is in the geni-
tive case (Anny) because she’s the book’s owner.
Accusative case
The accusative case mainly indicates a direct object,
which is the object of the action of the verb in a sen-
tence. For example, in the sentence Ya lyublyu
russkij yazyk (yah l’oou-bl’oo roo-skeey yee-zihk;
I love Russian), the phrase russkij yazyk is in the
accusative case because it’s the direct object.

Chapter 2: Grammar on a Diet: Just the Basics
23
Dative case
Use the dative case to indicate an indirect object,
which is the person or thing toward whom the action
in a sentence is directed. For example, in the sentence
Ya dal uchityelyu sochinyeniye (yah dahl oo-chee-
tee-lyu suh-chee-n’eh-nee-eh; I gave the teacher my
essay), uchityelyu (oo-chee-tee-lyu; teacher) is in the
dative case because it’s the indirect object.
Use the dative case after certain prepositions such as
k (k; toward) and po (poh; along).
Instrumental case
As the name suggests, the instrumental case is often
used to indicate the instrument that assists in the car-
rying out of an action. So, when you say that you’re
writing a letter with a ruchka (rooch-kuh; pen), you
have to put ruchka into the instrumental case, which
is ruchkoj (rooch-kuhy).
Use the instrumental case after certain prepositions
such as s (s; with), myezhdu (m’ehzh-doo; between),
nad (naht; over), pod (poht; below), and pyeryed
(p’eh-reet; in front of).
Prepositional case
Only used after certain prepositions. Older Russian
textbooks often refer to it as the locative case, because
it often indicates the location where the action takes
place. It’s used with the prepositions v (v; in), na
(nah; on), o (oh; about), and ob (ohb; about).
By the way, you may wonder why the English
preposition “about” is translated by two dif-
ferent Russian equivalents: o and ob. For
your information, o is used if the following
word begins with a consonant. Use ob if the
following word begins with a vowel.

Building Your Grammar Base
with Nouns and Pronouns
Nouns and pronouns are the building blocks of any
sentence. In the following sections, you find out
about genders, cases, and plurals of nouns.
Getting the lowdown on 
the gender of nouns
Unlike English nouns, every Russian noun has what’s
called a grammatical gender: masculine, feminine, or
neuter. Knowing a noun’s gender is important because
it determines how the noun changes for each of the
six cases.
The ending of a noun in its dictionary form (the nomi-
native case) indicates the noun’s gender in most cases.
Nouns ending in a consonant and j (an unusual letter)
are masculine. Nouns ending in a or ya are feminine.
If nouns end in o, ye, or yo, they are neuter. Nouns
can be either feminine or masculine if they end in the
soft sign (’).
Grammatical gender for words denoting living beings,
in the majority of cases, coincides with biological
gender. The word mal’chik (mahl’-cheek; boy) is a
masculine noun and the word dyevushka (d’eh-voosh-
kuh; girl) is a feminine noun, just as you’d expect.
Checking out cases for nouns
Noun declension is when you change the case end-
ings for nouns. Table 2-1 shows you the declension for
masculine, feminine, and neuter singular nouns for all
the cases.

Russian nouns in the nominative case (singu-
lar) never end in the letters i, u, y, e, or yu.
A small number of nouns end in yo, but
they’re special cases and we deal with them
as they come up.
This table may look kind of scary at first, but it’s actu-
ally easy to use. Say you want to say “I bought my
friend a car.” The first part of the sentence is ya kupil
(ya koo-peel; I bought). But what should you do with
the nouns car and friend? In this sentence, mashina
(muh-shih-nuh; car) is a direct object of the action
expressed by the verb kupil (koo-peel; bought).
That means you have to put mashina into the
accusative case.
The next step is to find the appropriate ending in
Table 2-1. You find this ending in the second row,
third column. The table says to replace a with u.
Now what about drug (drook; friend)? Because
friend is the indirect object of the sentence (the
person to whom or for whom the action of the verb
is directed), it takes the dative case in Russian.
Table 2-1 indicates that if a noun ends in a consonant
(as does drug), you form the dative case by adding
the letter u to the final consonant. The correct form
for drug in this sentence is drugu (droog-oo). So here’s
your complete sentence: Ya kupil drugu mashinu
(yah koo-peel droog-oo muh-shih-noo; I bought my
friend a car).
Putting plurals into their cases
As you probably guessed, Russian plural nouns take
different endings depending on the case they’re in.
Table 2-2 shows you the rules for plural formation in
the nominative case.

The rules in Table 2-2 have a few important

sh’, g, k, and kh, are very touchy. They just
don’t tolerate the letter y after them and
prefer an i instead. The plural of kniga (knee-
guh; book) is knigi (knee-gee; books).
Changing plurals into the genitive case
Forming the plurals of nouns in the genitive case is a
little trickier than in the other cases, so we deal with
it first in Table 2-3.

Drop the final a. If the resulting

sosyedok (sah-s’eh-duhk;

iye or iya
Replace iye or iya with ij:

Replace the final j with yov if
the ending is stressed, or with
yev if the ending is not stressed:

parrot) becomes popugayev
(puh-poo-gah-ehf; parrots).

Now, try to apply Table 2-3 to a real-life situation.
Imagine that your friend asks you U tyebya yest’
karandash? (oo tee-b’ah yest’ kuh-ruhn-dahsh?; Do
you have a pencil?). You say that you have a lot of
pencils, but the word mnogo (mnoh-guh; many/a lot
of) requires that the noun used with it take the geni-
tive plural form. In your sentence, the word karan-
dashi (kuh-ruhn-dah-shih; pencils) should take the
form of genitive plural. What does Table 2-3 say about
the ending sh? That’s right; you need to add the
ending yej. You say U myenya mnogo karandashyej
(oo mee-n’ah mnoh-guh kuh-ruhn-duh-shehy; I have
many pencils).

Picking out pronouns
Pronouns are words like he, she, and it. They’re used
in place of nouns to refer to someone or something
that’s already been mentioned.
Major Russian pronouns include the following:
 ya (ya; I)
 ty (tih; you [informal singular])
 on (ohn; he)
 ona (ah-nah; she)
 my (mih; we)
 vy (vih; you [formal singular and plural])
So what about it? In English, inanimate
objects are usually referred to with the 
pronoun it, but in Russian, an inanimate
object is always referred to with the pronoun
corresponding to its grammatical gender.
You translate the English pronoun into
Russian with one of these pronouns:
 on (ohn), if the noun it refers to is masculine
 ona (ah-nah), if the noun it refers to is feminine
 ono (ah-noh), if the noun it refers to is neuter
 oni (ah-nee), if the noun it refers to is plural
For example, in the sentences Eto moya mashina.
Ona staraya (eh-tuh mah-ya muh-shih-nuh ah-nah
stah-ruh-yuh; That’s my car. It’s old), the pronoun it is
translated as ona, because it refers to the Russian
feminine noun mashina.
Placing basic pronouns into cases
Like nouns, Russian pronouns have different forms
for all the cases. Table 2-5 shows the declension for
pronouns.

Possessive pronouns indicate ownership or posses-

case with the noun they’re referring to. Table 2-6

Russian Phrases For Dummies

Say you’re getting ready to go out on the town and
you notice you lost your favorite shirt. You want to
say, “Where’s my shirt?” Because rubashka (roo-
bahsh-kuh; shirt) ends in a, it’s a feminine noun.
Because my modifies the feminine noun rubashka, it’s
written moya (mah-ya; my), according to Table 2-6.
The phrase you want is Gdye moya rubashka?
(gdye mah-ya roo-bahsh-kuh?; Where’s my shirt?)
Investigating interrogative pronouns
Interrogative pronouns are question words like who,
whose, and which. Who in Russian is kto (ktoh), and
you’re likely to hear or use this word in phrases like
 Kto eto? (ktoh eh-tuh?; Who is that?)
 Kto on? (ktoh ohn?; Who is he?)
 Kto vy? (ktoh vih?; Who are you?)
Kto changes its form depending on the case
it’s in. It becomes kogo (kah-voh; whom) in
the genitive case, kogo (kah-voh; whom) in
the accusative case, komu (koh-moo; whom)
in the dative case, kyem (kyem; whom) in
the instrumental case, and kom (kohm;
whom) in the prepositional case. But you
hear and use the basic nominative-case form
kto in most situations. And just as in English,
you use kto no matter what the gender of the
noun is.
Whose in Russian is chyej (chehy), and which is kakoj
(kuh-kohy). Chyej and kakoj change their endings
depending on the gender, number, and case of the
noun they modify. For now, you just need to know the
nominative case endings in Table 2-7.

The question words kogda (kahg-dah; when),

are also sometimes used as interrogative
pronouns. The good news is that kogda and
gdye never change their form. Chto changes
its form for all cases.
Decorating Your Speech 
with Adjectives
Adjectives spice up your speech. An adjective is a
word that describes, or modifies, a noun or a pro-
noun, like good, nice, difficult, or hard.
Always consenting: Adjective-noun
agreement
A Russian adjective always agrees with the noun or
pronoun it modifies in gender, number, and case.
Table 2-8 shows how to change adjective endings in
the nominative case, which is the case you’re likely to
see and use the most.

A lot in common: Putting adjectives

Table 2-9 shows how to change adjective endings
for all the cases other than nominative. (Work with
Table 2-8 to figure out which particular ending to use
in each case.) Notice how masculine and neuter
nouns take the same endings in the genitive, dative,
instrumental, and prepositional cases. The feminine
endings are the same for all cases except accusative.
And the plural genitive and plural prepositional end-
ings are the same.

Nowhere to be found: The lack 
of articles in Russian
The English words the, a, and an are called
articles. You use articles all the time in
English, but these words don’t exist in
Russian, so you don’t need to worry about
how to say them. When you want to say the, a,
or an, all you have to do is say the noun you
mean. “The store” and “a store” in Russian
are simply magazin (muh-guh-zeen; literally:
store). “The girl” and “a girl” are simply dye-
vushka (dyeh-voosh-kuh; literally: girl).
Adding Action with Verbs
A Russian verb carries loads of important
information. It can reveal whether an action
was completed or resulted in something and
whether the action occurs on a regular basis
or is a one-time event. Russian verbs also
reveal the number (and, in the past tense,
the gender) of the person or thing perform-
ing the action.
Spotting infinitives
Spotting Russian infinitives is easy, because they usu-
ally end in a t’ as in chitat’ (chee-taht’; to read), gov-
orit’ (guh-vah-reet’; to speak), and vidyet’ (veed-yet’;
to see).
Some Russian verbs (which are usually irregular) take
the infinitive endings ti as in idti (ee-tee; to walk) and
ch’ as in moch’ (mohch’; to be able to).
Living in the present tense
Russian verbs have only one present tense. Like English
verbs, Russian verbs conjugate (change their form) so
that they always agree in person and number with the
subject of the sentence. To conjugate most Russian

Russian Phrases For Dummies

verbs in the present tense, you drop the infinitive

to do is drop the infinitive ending t’ and replace it
with one of four endings in Table 2-11.

Past again: Perfective or imperfective?
English expresses past events either through the past-
simple tense (I ate yesterday), which simply states a
fact, or the present-perfect tense (I have eaten
already), which emphasizes the result of the action.
Russian verbs do something similar by using what’s
called verbal aspect: perfective and imperfective.
Up to this point, we’ve been withholding some very
essential information from you: Every English verb is
represented by two Russian verbs: its imperfective
equivalent and a perfective counterpart. Usually, the
imperfective is listed first, as in this example:
To read — chitat’ (chee-taht’)/prochitat’
(pruh-chee-taht’)
Chitat’ is the imperfective infinitive, and prochitat’ is
the perfective infinitive. You form the perfective
aspect by adding the prefix pro to the imperfective
infinitive. However, sometimes the perfective aspect
of a verb looks quite different from the imperfective
aspect, so always check the dictionary.

Russian Phrases For Dummies 
46
The imperfective aspect form of the verb
emphasizes the fact of an action in the past
or to express habitual or repeated action in
the past. The perfective aspect emphasizes
the result or completion of the action. You
also use the perfective aspect of a verb if you
want to emphasize a single, momentary
event that took place in the past, such as
breaking a plate.
If you tell someone Ya pisal ryezyumye tsyelyj dyen’
(ya pee-sahl ree-z’oo-meh tseh -lihy d’ehn’; I was writing
my résumé all day), you use the past tense imperfec-
tive form of the verb pisat’, because your emphasis is
on the fact of writing, not on the completion of the
task. If you finished writing your résumé, you use the
past tense perfective form of the verb, because your
emphasis is on the completion of the action: Ya
napisal ryesyumye (ya nuh-pee-sahl ree-z’oo-meh;
I have written my résumé).
Planning for the future tense
To describe an action that will take place in the
future, Russian uses the future tense. Although
English has many different ways to talk about the
future, Russian has only two: the future imperfective
and the future perfective.
You use the future imperfective when you
want to emphasize the fact that something
will happen or be happening in the future,
but you don’t necessarily want to emphasize
the result or completion of an action. You
use the future perfective to emphasize result
or completion of an action.
To form the future imperfective, you use the
future tense form of the verb byt’ (biht’;
to be) plus the imperfective infinitive. This
combination translates into “will/will be.”
Table 2-12 shows the conjugation of the verb
byt’ in the future tense.

budyem (boo-d’ehm)
vy (you [formal singular 
budyetye (boo-d’eh-t’eh)
and plural])
oni (they)
budut (boo-doot)
If you want to say “I will read (but not necessarily
finish reading) the article,” you use the ya (I) form of
the verb byt’ plus the imperfective infinitive chitat’
(chee-taht’; to read): Ya budu chitat’ stat’yu (ya boo-
doo chee-taht’ staht’-yu).
To form the future perfective, you simply
conjugate the perfective form of the verb, as
in Ya prochitayu stat’yu syegodnya (ya
pruh-chee-tah-yu staht’-yu see-vohd-n’uh;
I’ll read/finish reading the article today). In
other words, you use the ending yu for ya (I)
as you do in the present tense. See the previ-
ous section for more about perfective verbs.
Using the unusual verb byt’ (to be)
Russian has no present tense of the verb to
be. To say “I’m happy,” you just say Ya
schastliv (ya sh’ahs-leef; literally: I happy).
To say “That’s John,” you just say Eto Dzhon
(eh-tuh dzhohn; literally: That John). The
being verbs am, are, and is are implicitly
understood in the present tense.

Russian Phrases For Dummies 
48
To express the verb to be in the past tense, you need
to use the proper past-tense form of the verb byt’:
 byl (bihl; was), if the subject is a masculine sin-
gular noun
 byla (bih-lah; was), if the subject is a feminine
singular noun
 bylo (bih-luh; was), if the subject is a neuter sin-
gular noun
 byli (bih-lee; was), if the subject is a plural noun
or if the subject is vy (vih; you [formal singular])
To express the verb to be in the future tense, you
have to use the correct form of the verb byt’ in the
future tense. (For conjugation, refer to Table 2-12.) To
say “I will be happy,” you say Ya budu schastliv
(ya boo-doo sh’ahs-leef), and for “I will be there,” you
say Ya budu tam (ya boo-doo tahm).

 odin (ah-deen; one)
 dva (dvah; two)
 tri (tree; three)
 chyetyrye (chee-tih-r’eh; four)
 pyat’ (p’aht’; five)
 shyest’ (shehst’; six)
 syem’ (s’ehm’; seven)
 vosyem’ (voh-s’ehm’; eight)
 dyevyat’ (d’eh-v’uht’; nine)
But wait! You have to use a few rules when you use
these numbers:
 The number one followed by a noun: For mas-
culine nouns, you say odin followed by the noun
as in odin chyelovyek (ah-deen chee-lah-v’ehk;
one man). If the noun is feminine you say odna
as in odna dyevushka (ahd-nah d’eh-voosh-kuh;
one girl). And if the noun is neuter you say odno
as in odno okno (ahd-noh ahk-noh; one window).
 The number two followed by a noun: For mas-
culine or neuter nouns, you say dva, and if the
noun is feminine, dva becomes dvye. After the
numeral two, you have to put the noun into the
genitive case singular as in dva chyelovyeka
(dvah chee-lah-v’eh-kuh; two men), dva okna
(dvah ahk-nah; two windows), and dvye dye-
vushki (dv’eh d’eh-voosh-kee; two girls).
 The numbers three and four followed by a
noun: Like the numeral dva (dvah; two), tri
(tree; three) and chyetyrye (chee-tih-r’eh; four)
also require the noun used after them to be put
into the genitive singular. Unlike odin and dva,
these numbers don’t change their form depend-
ing on the gender of the noun they refer to.

Chapter 3: Counting of All Kinds
51
 The numbers five through nine followed by a
noun: When you use any noun after the numer-
als five through nine, you must put the noun
into the genitive plural case, as in the phrase
pyat’ dyevushyek (p’aht’ d’eh-voo-shehk; five
girls) and syem’ mal’chikov (s’ehm’ mahl-chee-
kuhf; seven boys). Unlike odin and dva, these
numbers don’t change their form depending on
the gender of the noun they’re used with.
Numbers 10 through 19
The following are the numbers 10 through 19:
 dyesyat’ (d’eh-s’uht’; 10)
 odinnadtsat’ (ah-dee-nuht-tsuht’; 11)
 dvyenadtsat’ (dvee-naht-tsuht’; 12)
 trinadtsat’ (tree-naht-tsuht’; 13)
 chyetyrnadtsat’ (chee-tihr-nuht-tsuht’; 14)
 pyatnadtsat’ (peet-naht-tsuht’; 15)
 shyestnadtsat’ (shees-naht-tsuht’; 16)
 syemnadtsat’ (seem-naht-tsuht’; 17)
 vosyemnadtsyat’ (vuh-seem-naht-tsuht’; 18)
 dyevyatnadtsat’ (dee-veet-naht-tsuht’; 19)
Nouns following all these numerals take the
genitive plural.

The Clock’s Ticking: Telling Time
When you go out and have fun, vryemya (vr’eh-m’uh;
time) is crucial. In the following sections, we help you
state and ask for time and specify times of the day
and days of the week.
Counting the hours
Just like in Europe, Russia uses the 24-hour
system for each day. Instead of 3 p.m., you
may hear the phrase pyatnadtsdat’ chasov
(peet-naht-tsuht’ chuh-sohf; 15 o’clock 
[literally: 15 hours]). Russians use this
form of time-telling for all kinds of official
messages: schedules, radio and TV
announcements, working hours, and so on.

Chapter 3: Counting of All Kinds
53
In everyday situations, however, most people
use the first 12 numerals to indicate both
a.m. and p.m. hours.
If you want to indicate “a.m.” when using the 12-hour
system, you say utra (oot-rah; literally: in the morning)
after the time; you say dnya (dn’ah; literally: in the
day) after the time to indicate “p.m.” So 5 a.m. would
be pyat’ chasov utra (p’aht’ chuh-sohf oot-rah), and
5 p.m. would be pyat’ chasov dnya (p’aht’ chuh-sohf
dn’ah). When you’re using the 24-hour system, you
don’t have to add the words utra or dnya.
Saying “o’clock” in Russian is kind of tricky.
These simple rules, however, should help
you translate this word into Russian:
 If the time is one o’clock, you just use the word
chas, as in Syejchas chas (see-chahs chahs; It’s
one o’clock). You don’t even have to say odin
(ah-deen; one) before the word chas.
 After the numeral dvadtsat’ odin (dvaht-tsuht’
ah-deen; 21), use the word chas (chahs; o’clock),
as in Syejchas dvadtsat’ odin chas (see-chahs
dvaht-tsuht’ ah-deen chahs; It’s 21 o’clock), or in
other words, 9 p.m.
 After the numbers dva (dvah; 2), tri (tree; 3),
chyetyrye (chee-tih-ree; 4), dvadtsat’ dva
(dvaht-tsuht’ dvah; 22), dvadtsat’ tri (dvaht-tsuht’
tree; 23), and dvadtsat’ chyetyrye (dvaht-tsuht’
chee-tih-ree; 24), use the word chasa (chuh-sah;
o’clock), as in Syejchas tri chasa (see-chahs tree
chuh-sah; It’s 3 o’clock).
 With all other numerals indicating time, use the
word chasov (chuh-sohf; o’clock), as in Syejchas
pyat chasov (see-chahs p’aht’ chuh-sohf; It’s five
o’clock).
One final tip: To say “noon” in Russian, you just say
poldyen’ (pohl-d’ehn’; literally: half-day). When you
want to say “midnight,” you say polnoch’ (pohl-nuhch;
literally: half night).

Marking the minutes
In the following sections, we show you different ways
to keep time by expressing minuta (mee-noo-tuh;
minute) time increments in Russian.
On the half-hour
The easiest way to state the time by the half-hour in
Russian is just to add the words tridtsat’ minut (treet-
tsuht’ mee-noot; 30 minutes) to the hour: Syejchas
dva chasa tridtsat’ minut (see-chahs dvah chuh-sah
treet-tsuht’ mee-noot; It’s 2:30). In more conversational
speech, it’s common to drop the words chasa and
minut and just say Syejchas dva tridtsat’ (see-chahs
dvah treet-tsuht’; It’s 2:30).
However, you may hear other ways of talking about
half-hour increments, such as Syejchas polovina
vtorogo (see-chahs puh-lah-vee-nuh ftah-roh-vuh;
It’s half past one [literally: It’s half of two]).
The word polovina literally means “half of,”
not “half past.” What you’re really saying
is “half of” whatever the next hour is.
Therefore, 1:30 in Russian is literally “half of
two,” or polovina vtorogo, and 2:30 is liter-
ally “half of three,” or polovina tryet’yego.
In a phrase like Syejchas polovina vtorogo,
the Russian word used to indicate the hour
(vtorogo) is the genitive form of the ordinal
number vtoroj (ftah-rohy; second).
On the quarter hour
To indicate a quarter after an hour, Russian typically
uses the phrase pyatnadtsat’ minut (peet-naht-tsuht’
mee-noot; 15 minutes). To say it’s 5:15, you just say:
Syejchas pyat’ chasov pyatnadtsat’ minut (see-
chahs p’aht’ chuh-sohf peet-naht-tsuht’ mee-noot;
literally: It’s 5 hours 15 minutes)
To be more conversational, you can drop chasov and
minut and say Syejchas pyat’ pyatnadtsat’ (see-chahs
p’aht’ peet-naht-tsuht’; It’s 5:15).

Chapter 3: Counting of All Kinds
55
To indicate a quarter to an hour, use the word byez
(b’ehs; without) with pyatnadtsati and the hour, as in:
Syejchas byez pyatnadtsati pyat’ (see-chahs
bees peet-naht-tsuh-tee p’aht’; It’s 4:45 [literally:
It’s 5 without 15 minutes])
Other times before or after the hour
To state times that aren’t on the half- or quarter-hour,
you can simply use the construction Syejchas . . . chasa
(or chasov) + . . . minut, as in Syejchas chyetyrye
chasa dyesyat’ minut (see-chahs chee-tih-ree chuh-sah
d’eh-seet’ mee-noot; It’s 4:10). For more conversational
speech, you can also drop the words chasa (or chasov)
and minut and just say Syejchas chyetyrye dyesyat’
(see-chahs chee-tih-r’eh d’eh-s’uht’).
To express times right before the hour, you use the
construction Syejchas byez plus the numbers indicat-
ing the minutes and the next hour. “It’s ten to five” is
Syejchas byez dyesyati pyat (see-chahs bees dee-see-
tee p’aht’; literally: It’s five minus ten minutes). In this
construction, it’s common to drop the words minut
(minutes) and chasov (hours) after the numerals indi-
cating the time.
When using this expression, you must always
remember to put the numeral after the word
byez into the genitive case. Here are the 
genitive-case forms of the numerals you
most often use with this expression:
 odnoj (ahd-nohy; 1)
 dvukh (dvookh; 2)
 tryokh (tryokh; 3)
 chyetyryokh (chee-tih-r’ohkh; 4)
 pyati (pee-tee; 5)
 dyesyati (dee-see-tee; 10)
 pyat’nadtsati (peet-naht-tsuh-tee; 15)
 dvadtsati (dvaht-tsuh-tee; 20)
 dvadtsati pyati (dvuht-tsuh-tee pee-tee; 25)

Asking for the time
To ask what time it is, you say Skol’ko sye-
jchas vryemyeni? (skohl’-kuh see-chahs
vr’eh-m’eh-nee?; What time is it?) If you ask a
passerby in public, you may want to begin
this question with the polite phrase Izvinitye
pozhalujsta . . . (eez-vee-nee-t’eh pah-zhah-luh-
stuh . . . ; Excuse me, please . . .) or Skazhitye
pozhalujsta . . . (skuh-zhih-t’eh pah-zhah-luh-
stuh . . . ; Could you please tell me . . .).
To ask at what time something will happen or has
happened, use the phrases Kogda (kahg-dah; when)
or V kakoye vryemya . . . (f kuh-koh-ee vr’eh-m’uh . . . ;
At what time . . .).
Knowing the times of the day
People all over the world seem to agree on
three main time periods: utro (oo-truh; morn-
ing), dyen’ (d’ehn’; afternoon), and vyechyer
(v’eh-chehr; evening). Noch’ (nohch; night) is
the time when most people sleep. To state
that something happens within these time
periods, use these phrases:
 utrom (oo-truhm; in the morning)
 dnyom (dn’ohm; in the afternoon)
 vyechyerom (v’eh-cheh-ruhm; in the evening)
 noch’yu (nohch-yu; late at night or early in the
morning)
Although English uses the prepositional
phrase “in + time of the day” to indicate times
of the day, in Russian you put the words utro,
dyen’, vyechyer, and noch’ in instrumental
case. Also note that the word dyen’ drops
the letter ye in the process and becomes
dnyom rather than denyom. Nouns some-
times have this habit of “losing” letters in the
process of declining for cases in Russian.

Monday, Tuesday: Weekdays
To indicate days of the week, use these
Russian words:
 ponyedyel’nik (puh-nee-d’ehl’-neek; Monday)
 vtornik (ftohr-neek; Tuesday)
 sryeda (sree-dah; Wednesday)
 chyetvyerg (cheet-v’ehrk; Thursday)
 pyatnitsa (p’aht-nee-tsuh; Friday)
 subbota (soo-boh-tuh; Saturday)
 voskryesyen’ye (vuhs-kree-s’ehn’-ye; Sunday)
If somebody asks you what day of the week it is, he
says: Kakoj syegodnya dyen’? (kuh-kohy see-vohd-
n’uh d’ehn’?; What day is it today?) To answer this
question, you say Syegodnya plus the day of the
week. For example: Syegodnya ponyedyel’nik (see-
vohd-n’uh puh-nee-d’ehl’-neek; It’s Monday today).
It’s that simple!
To say that something happens, happened, or will
happen on a certain day, you need to add the preposi-
tion v, and you put the word denoting the day of the
week into the accusative case. (For more on cases,
see Chapter 2.)
 v ponyedyel’nik (f puh-nee-d’ehl’-neek; on
Monday)
 vo vtornik (vah ftohr-neek; on Tuesday)
 v sryedu (f sr’eh-doo; on Wednesday)
 v chyetvyerg (f cheet-v’ehrk; on Thursday)
 v pyatnitsu (f p’aht-nee-tsuh; on Friday)
 v subbotu (f soo-boh-too; on Saturday)
 v voskryesyen’ye (v vuhs-kree-s’ehn’-ee; on
Sunday)

Russian Phrases For Dummies 
58
You may wonder why some of the days
change in the accusative case, while others
don’t. The explanation is simple: Masculine
nouns denoting inanimate objects don’t
change their form in accusative case and
retain their nominative (dictionary) form.
Other phrases related to the days of the week include
 dyen’ (d’ehn’; day)
 syegodnya (see-vohd-n’uh; today)
 syegodnya utrom (see-vohd-n’uh oo-truhm; this
morning)
 syegodnya vyechyerom (see-vohd-n’uh 
v’eh-ch’eh-ruhm; this evening)
 nyedyelya (nee-d’eh-l’uh; week)
Talking about time relative 
to the present
Just as in English, Russian has lots of phrases to talk
about a certain time in the past or future that relates
to the present moment. Some time-related words that
you may hear or say often in Russian are
 syejchas (see-chahs; now)
 skoro (skoh-ruh; soon)
 pozdno (pohz-nuh; late)
 pozzhye (poh-zheh; later)
 rano (rah-nuh; early)
 ran’shye (rahn’-sheh; earlier)
 vchyera (fchee-rah; yesterday)
 pozavchyera (puh-zuhf-ch’eh-rah; the day
before yesterday)
 zavtra (zahf-truh; tomorrow)
 poslyezavtra (poh-sl’eh-zahf-truh; the day after
tomorrow)

Chapter 3: Counting of All Kinds
59
If you want to express that something will happen 
in a week, a month, or a year, you use chyeryez plus
the accusative form of either nyedyelya (nee-d’eh-
l’uh; week), myesyats (m’eh-seets; month), or god
(goht; year):
 chyeryez nyedyelyu (cheh-r’ehz nee-d’eh-l’oo;
in a week)
 chyeryez myesyats (cheh-reez m’eh-s’uhts; in a
month)
 chyeryez god (cheh-r’ehz goht; in a year)
To say that something happened last week, month, or
year, you say
 na proshloj nyedyele (nuh prohsh-luhy nee-
d’eh-l’eh; last week)
 v proshlom myesyatsye (v prohsh-luhm m’eh-
see-tseh; last month)
 v proshlom godu (v prohsh-luhm gah-doo;
last year)
Checking Your Calendar
September, April, June, and November may all have
30 days, but here’s some more important things to
know about your calendar.
Recognizing the names of the months
Here’s a list of the myesyatsy (m’eh-see-tsih; months):
 yanvar’(yeen-vahr’; January)
 fyevral’ (feev-rahl’; February)
 mart (mahrt; March)
 apryel’(uhp-r’ehl’; April)
 maj (mahy; May)
 iyun’(ee-yun’; June)

Russian Phrases For Dummies 
60
 iyul’ (ee-yul’; July)
 avgust (ahv-goost; August)
 syentyabr’ (seen-t’ahbr’; September)
 oktyabr’ (ahk-t’ahbr’; October)
 noyabr’ (nah-yahbr’; November)
 dyekabr’ (dee-kahbr’; December)
When you want to say a chislo (chees-loh;
date) in Russian, you need to put the ordinal
number indicating the day in the form of
neuter gender and the name of the month in
the genitive case, as in:
 Syegodnya pyatoye oktyabrya (see-vohd-n’uh
p’ah-tuh-eh uhk-teeb-r’ah; Today is October 5).
 Zavtra dyesyatoye iyulya (zahf-truh dee-s’ah-
tuh-eh ee-yu-l’uh; Tomorrow is June 10).
 Poslyezavtra dvadtstat’ chyetvyortoye marta
(pohs-lee-zahf-truh dvaht-tsuht’ cheet-v’ohr-
tuh-eh mahr-tuh; The day after tomorrow is
March 24).
Saying the year
To indicate a year, you begin with the century,
as in tysyacha dyevyatsot (tih-see-chuh dee-
veet-soht; 19 [literally: 1,900]) for the 20th
century or dvye tysyachi (dv’eh tih-see-chee;
2,000) for the 21st century. Then, to state the
number indicating the year, use the corre-
sponding ordinal number, as in:
 tysyacha dyevyatsot pyat’dyesyat’ vos’moj god
(tih-see-chuh dee-veet-soht pee-dee-s’aht vahs’-
mohy goht; 1958 [literally: 1,958th year])
 dvye tysyachi syed’moj god (dv’eh tih-see-chee
seed’-mohy goht; 2007 [literally: 2,007th year])

Chapter 3: Counting of All Kinds
61
Note that in indicating a year, Russian, unlike
English, actually uses the word god (goht;
year). The word god has two plural forms:
the regular gody (goh-dih; years) and the
irregular goda (gah-dah; years). A very subtle
stylistic difference exists between the two,
so don’t hesitate to use both or the one you
like better.
To indicate when a certain event took, takes, or will
take place, use preposition v + the year in the preposi-
tional case + godu (gah-doo; year), as in:
v tysyacha dyevyatsot pyat’dyesyat vos’mom
godu (v tih-see-chuh dee-veet-soht pee-dee-s’aht
vahs’-mohm gah-doo; in 1958 [literally: in the
1,958th year])
To indicate the year in which an event takes
place, you only have to put the last ordinal
numeral describing the year into the preposi-
tional case.
Surveying the seasons
Russia has some beautiful vryemyena goda
(vree-mee-nah goh-duh; seasons [literally:
times of the year]). Here they are:
 zima (zee-mah; winter)
 vyesna (vees-nah; spring)
 lyeto (l’eh-tuh; summer)
 osyen’ (oh-s’ehn’; fall)
A popular Russian song says V prirodye
plokhoj pogody nye byvayet (v pree-roh-
d’eh plah-khohy pah-goh-dih nee bih-vah-eht;
Nature doesn’t have bad weather). This line
is another way of saying that every vryemya
goda (vr’eh-m’uh goh-duh; season [literally:
time of the year]) has its own beauty.

Money, Money, Money
The official Russian currency is the rubl’ (roobl’;
ruble). Much like a dollar equals 100 cents, one rubl’
equals 100 kopyejki (kah-p’ehy-kee; kopecks).
To talk about different numbers of rubles, you need to
use different cases, such as dva rublya (dvah roob-
l’ah; 2 rubles) in the genitive singular, pyat’ rublyej
(p’aht’ roob-l’ehy; 5 rubles) in the genitive plural, and
dvadtsat’ odin rubl’ (dvaht-tsuht’ ah-deen roobl’; 21
rubles) in the nominative singular.
Changing money
Big Russian cities are saturated with punkty obmyena
(poonk-tih ahb-m’eh-nuh; currency-exchange offices),
which can also be called obmyen valyuty (ahb-m’ehn
vuh-lyu-tih). You can usually find a punkt obmyena in
any hotel. The best kurs obmyena valyuty (koors
ahb-m’eh-nuh vuh-l’oo-tih; exchange rate), however, is
offered by banki (bahn-kee; banks).
Some handy phrases to use when you exchange cur-
rency include
 Ya khochu obmyenyat’ dyen’gi. (ya khah-choo
uhb-mee-n’aht’ d’ehn’-gee; I want to exchange
money.)
 Ya khochu obmyenyat’ dollary na rubli. (ya
khah-choo uhb-mee-n’aht’ doh-luh-rih nuh roob-
lee; I want to exchange dollars for rubles.)
 Kakoj kurs obmyena? (kuh-kohy koors ahb-
m’eh-nuh?; What is the exchange rate?)
 Nado platit’ komissiyu? (nah-duh pluh-teet’ kah-
mee-see-yu?; Do I have to pay a fee?)
Heading to the ATM
The fastest way to access your account is the banko-
mat (buhn-kah-maht; ATM). Bankomaty (buhn-kah-
mah-tih; ATMs) are less ubiquitous in small cities;
they’re usually found in banks.

Here’s your guide to the phrases you see on
the bankomat screen:
 vstav’tye kartu (fstahf’-t’eh kahr-too; insert

 vvyeditye PIN-kod (vee-dee-t’eh peen-koht;
enter your PIN)
 vvyeditye summu (vvee-dee-t’eh soo-moo; enter

 snyat’ nalichnyye (sn’aht’ nuh-leech-nih-yeh;

 kvitantsiya (kvee-tahn-tsih-yuh; receipt)
 zabyeritye kartu (zuh-bee-ree-tee kahr-too;

Spending money
Before you run out and spend your money, you may

Paying with credit cards
Although kryeditnyye kartochki (kree-deet-
nih-eh kahr-tuhch-kee; credit cards) and
bankovskiye kartochki (bahn-kuhf-skee-eh
kahr-tuhch-kee; debit cards) have long been
established in cities like Moscow and St.
Petersburg, in other cities your attempts to
pay with a credit card may not be as wel-
come. When making plans to pay with a
credit card, it’s worth asking
 U vas mozhno zaplatit’ kryeditnoj kartochkoj?
(oo vahs mohzh-nuh zuh-pluh-teet’ kree-deet-

reetings and introductions in Russian are a bit
more formal than in English. If you greet some-
body correctly in Russian, that person is impressed
and probably wants to get to know you better. If, how-
ever, you botch your greeting, you may get a funny
look or even offend the person you’re addressing.
In this chapter, we give you details on how to make
your best first impression and then make small talk
with your new friends.
To Whom Am I Speaking? 
Being Informal or Formal
When you want to say “hello” in Russian, it’s
important to know who you’re talking to
first. Unlike in English (but similar to French,
German, or Spanish, for example), Russian
uses two different words for the word you —
informal ty (tih) and formal vy (vih).

Russian Phrases For Dummies 
66
Here’s how to know when to use which form of you:
 In Russian, you’re allowed to use the informal ty
only when you’re speaking to your parents,
grandparents, siblings, children, and close
friends.
 The formal vy is used in more formal situations
when you talk to your boss, acquaintances,
older people, or people you don’t know very
well, and any time you’re speaking to more than
one person.
As you get to know somebody better, you
may switch to the informal ty. You even have
a way of asking a person whether he or she
is ready to switch to ty: Mozhno na ty?
(Mozh-nuh nah tih?; May I call you informal
you?) If the answer is da! (dah; yes), then
you’re free to start calling the person ty.
If, however, the answer is nyet! (n’eht; no),
you’d better wait until the person feels more
comfortable with you!
Comings and Goings: Saying
Hello and Goodbye
Greetings and goodbyes are essential Russian phrases
to know — because they’re the start and finish of
every conversation.
Saying hello to different people
To greet one person with whom you’re on informal ty
(tih) terms, use the word zdravstvuj (zdrah-stvooy;
hello). To greet a person with whom you’re on formal
vy (vih) terms or to address more than one person,
use the longer word, zdravstvujtye (zdrah-stvooy-t’eh;
hello). Note that the first letter v in zdravstvujtye is
silent. Otherwise, it would be hard even for Russians
to pronounce!

Chapter 4: Enjoying Small Talk
67
The informal way of saying “hello” in Russian
is privyet! (pree-v’eht). It’s similar to the
English hi, and you should be on pretty famil-
iar terms with a person before you use this
greeting.
Here are some other ways to greet people, depending
on what time of day it is:
 Dobroye utro! (dohb-ruh-eh oo-truh!;Good
morning!): This is the greeting you use in the
morning — until noon.
 Dobryj dyen’! (dohb-rihy d’ehn’!; Good after-
noon!): This is the greeting you can use most of
the day, except for early in the morning or late
at night.
 Dobryj vyechyer! (dohb–rihy v’eh-ch’ehr! Good
evening!): This is the greeting you would most
likely use in the evening.
Handling “How are you?”
Here are the easiest and most popular ways to ask
“How are you?”:
 Kak dyela? (kahk dee-lah?): You use this phrase
in rather informal settings.
 Kak vy pozhivayetye? (kahk vih puh-zhih-vah-
eh-t’eh?): You use this phrase when speaking
with your boss or somebody you’ve just met.
Here are some way to reply to Kak dyela?:
 Khorosho (khuh-rah-shoh; good)
 Normal’no (nahr-mahl’-nuh; normal or okay)
 Nichyego (nee-chee-voh; so-so [literally: nothing])
 Nyeplokho (nee-ploh-khuh; not bad)
 Pryekrasno! (pree-krahs-nuh!; wonderful)
 Vyelikolyepno! (vee-lee-kah-l’ehp-nuh!; terrific)

Russian Phrases For Dummies 
68
Although optimistic Americans don’t hesi-
tate to say “terrific” or “wonderful,” Russians
are usually more reserved. To be on the safe
side, just say either Nichyego or Nyeplokho.
But don’t stop there! Be sure to ask the person how
she’s doing. You simply say A u vas? (ah oo vahs?;
And you? [formal]) If you want to be less formal, you
say A u tyebya? (ah oo tee-b’ah?; And you?)
Taking your leave
The usual way to say “goodbye” in almost any situa-
tion is Do svidaniya! (duh svee-dah-nee-uh!), which
literally means “’Til (the next) meeting.” If you’re on
informal terms with somebody, you may also say
Poka (pah-kah; bye or see you later).
The phrase you use while leave-taking in the evening
or just before bed is Spokojnoj nochi (spah-kohy-nuhy
noh-chee; Good night). The phrase works both for
formal and informal situations.
Break the Ice: Making
Introductions
Making a good first impression is important for the
beginning of any relationship. This section shows you
phrases to use when getting acquainted with some-
one, how to ask for somebody’s name, and the best
way to introduce your friends to new people.
Getting acquainted
In English, introducing yourself is the best
way to start a conversation with somebody
you don’t know. Not so in Russian. Russians
like to begin with first suggesting to get
acquainted. They have two ways to say this:

Chapter 4: Enjoying Small Talk
69
 Davajtye poznakomimsya! (duh-vahy-t’eh puhz-
nuh- koh-meem-suh!; Let’s get acquainted!),
when addressing a person formally or two or
more people
 Davaj poznakomimsya! (duh-vahy puhz-nuh
koh-meem-suh!; Let’s get acquainted!), when
addressing a person informally
If somebody says one of these phrases to you, you
should politely accept the suggestion by saying:
 Davajtye! (duh-vahy-t’eh!; Okay! [literally: Let’s!]),
when addressing a person formally or two or
more people
 Davaj! (duh-vahy!; Okay! [literally: Let’s!]), when
addressing a person informally
Asking for people’s names 
and introducing yourself
The formal version of “What is your name?” is Kak
vas zovut? (kahk vahz zah-voot?; literally: What do
they call you?). The informal version of “What is your
name?” is Kak tyebya zovut? (kahk tee-b’ah zah-voot?;
literally: What do they call you?). To introduce your-
self in Russian, just say Myenya zovut (Mee-n’ah zah-
voot) + your name.
After you’re introduced to someone, you may want to
say, “Nice to meet you.” In Russian you say ochyen’
priyatno (oh-cheen’ pree-yat-nuh; literally: very pleas-
ant). The person you’ve been introduced to may then
reply mnye tozhye (mnye toh-zheh; same here). You
use the phrases ochyen’ priyatno and mnye tozhye
in both formal and informal situations.
Saying names in Russian is a bit more com-
plicated than in English because Russians
use the patronymic (father’s name) right after
the first name. The patronymic usually has
the ending –vich (veech), meaning “son of,”

Russian Phrases For Dummies 
70
or –ovna (ohv-nuh), meaning “daughter of.”
For example, a man named Boris, whose
father’s name is Ivan, would be known as
Boris Ivanovich (Ivanovich is the patronymic).
A woman named Anna whose father’s name
is Ivan would be known as Anna Ivanovna
(Ivanovna is the patronymic). A Russian
almost never formally addresses a person
named Mikhail as just “Mikhail” but rather as
“Mikhail” plus his patronymic with the suffix
–vich (for instance, “Mikhail Nikolayevich” or
“Mikhail Borisovich”).
Men’s last names and women’s last names have 
different endings. That’s because Russian last
names have genders. Although most Russian
male last names have the ending –ov (of), female
names take the ending –ova (ohv-nuh). Imagine
that your new acquaintance, Anna Ivanova, is 
a married woman. Her husband’s last name 
isn’t Ivanova (ee-vuh-noh-vuh), but Ivanov
(ee-vuh-nof).
Introducing your friends and family
Everyday, common introductions are easy in Russian.
When you want to introduce your friends, all you need
to say is Eto . . . (eh-tuh . . . ; This is . . .). Then you
simply add the name of the person.
To indicate that the person is an acquaintance or a
colleague, you say one of two things:
 If the person is a man, you say Eto moj
znakomyj (eh-tuh mohy znuh-koh-mihy; 
This is my acquaintance).
 If the person is a woman, you say Eto moya
znakomaya (eh-tuh mah-ya znuh-koh-muh-yuh;
This is my acquaintance).

Let Me Tell You Something:
Talking about Yourself
What do people talk about when they first meet? The
topics are highly predictable: You usually talk about
yourself.
Stating where you’re from
To start the conversation, you can say Otkuda vy?
(aht-koo-duh vih?; Where are you from?). To answer,
you can say:
 Ya iz Amyeriki (ya eez uh-mye-ree-kee; I am
from America)
 Ya zhivu v Amyerikye (ya zhih-voo v uh-meh-
ree-k’eh; I live in America)
After a Russian finds out your country of origin, he
may ask you where in the country you’re from (such
as a city or a state). You may hear questions like
 V kakom shtatye vy zhivyote? (f kuh-kohm shtah-
t’eh vih zhih-vyo-t’eh?; What state do you live in?)
 Vy iz kakogo goroda? (vih eez kuh-koh-vuh 
goh-ruh-duh?; What city are you from?)
You can answer:
 Ya zhivu v Siyetlye (ya zhih-voo f see-yet-l’eh; I
live in Seattle)
 Ya iz Siyetla (ya ees see-yet-luh; I am from Seattle)
Notice that when the preposition v is fol-
lowed by a noun beginning with an unvoiced
consonant, it’s pronounced like f, not v, and
when the preposition iz is followed by a
noun beginning with an unvoiced consonant,
it’s pronounced ees, not eez.

Russian Phrases For Dummies 
72
When you say Ya zhivu v . . . (ya zhih-voo 
v . . . ; I live in . . .), use the word describing
the place where you live in the prepositional
case, because the preposition v (in) takes
that case. When saying Ya iz . . . (ya eez . . . ;
I am from . . .), use the next word in the 
genitive case because the preposition iz
(eez; from) requires genitive.
Telling your age
To inquire about someone’s vozrast (vohz-
ruhst; age) in Russian, you ask one of two
questions:
 Skol’ko tyebye lyet? (skohl’-kuh tee-b’eh l’eht?;
How old are you? [informal])
 Skol’ko vam lyet? (skohl’-kuh vahm l’eht; How
old are you? [formal])
Answering isn’t as simple as you may think.
First of all, in Russia, age is seen as some-
thing that happens to you, something you
can’t control (and this is, after all, very true).
That’s why, instead of using the subject in
the nominative case, Russian uses the dative
form of the person whose age is being
described. In Russian you say literally
“To me is 23 years old.”
The second tricky part of talking about your age is
that the translation of the word year(s) depends on
how old you are. This is how it works:
 If you’re 1, 21, or 31 years old (in other words, if
the numeral indicating your age is 1 or ends in 1),
use the word god (goht; year), as in Mnye
dvadtsat’ odin god (mnye dvaht-tsuht’ ah-deen
goht; I am twenty-one years old).
 If the numeral denoting your age ends in a 2, 3,
or 4, use the word goda (goh-duh; years), as in
Mnye dvadsat’ dva goda (mnye dvaht-tsuht’
dvah goh-duh; I am twenty-two years old).

Chapter 4: Enjoying Small Talk
73
 If the numeral denoting your age ends in 5, use
the word lyet, as in Mnye dvadsat’ pyat’ lyet
(mn’eh dvaht-tsuht’ p’aht’ l’eht; I am twenty-five
years old).
 If the numeral denoting your age ends in a 6, 7,
8, or 9, or if your age is 10 through 20, use the
word lyet, as in Mnye dvadsat’ syem’ lyet
(mn’eh dvaht-tsuht’ s’ehm’ l’eht; I am twenty-
seven years old).
Talking about Family
Family is a big part of Russian culture, so your
Russian acquaintances will certainly be curious
about yours.
Beginning with basic terms 
for family members
Your best bet is just to talk about the mem-
bers of your family with your new Russian
friend, using the following words:
 mat’ (maht’; mother)
 otyets (ah-t’ehts; father)
 rodityeli (rah-dee-t’eh-lee; parents)
 syn (sihn; son)
 synovya (sih-nah-v’ya; sons)
 doch’ (dohch’; daughter)
 dochri (doh-chee-ree; daughters)
 zhyena (zhih-nah; wife)
 muzh (moosh; husband)
 brat (braht; brother)
 brat’ya (brah-t’yuh; brothers)
 syestra (sees-trah; sister)
 syostry (syos-trih; sisters)

Russian Phrases For Dummies 
74
 ryebyonok (ree-byo-nuhk; child)
 dyeti (d’eh-tee; children)
 babushka (bah-boosh-kuh; grandmother)
 dyedushka (d’eh-doosh-kuh; grandfather)
 babushka i dyedushka (bah-boosh-kuh ee d’eh-
doosh-kuh; grandparents [literally: grandmother
and grandfather])
 vnuk (vnook; grandson)
 vnuki (vnoo-kee; grandsons)
 vnuchka (vnooch-kuh; granddaughter)
 vnuchki (vnooch-kee; granddaughters)
 vnuki (vnoo-kee; grandchildren)
 dyadya (dya-d’uh; uncle)
 tyotya (tyo-t’uh; aunt)
 kuzyen (koo-zehn; male cousin)
 kuzina (koo-zee-nuh; female cousin)
 plyemyannik (plee-m’ah-neek; nephew)
 plyemyannitsa (plee-m’ah-nee-tsuh; niece)
 syem’ya (seem’-ya; family)
Talking about family members 
with the verb “to have”
When talking about your family, use phrases like “I have
a brother” and “I have a big family” and “I don’t have
any brothers or sisters.” To say these phrases, you
need to know how to use the verb yest’ (yest’; to have).
Use the construction U myenya yest’ . . . (oo mee-nya
yest’ . . . ; I have . . .) when talking about your own
family:
 U myenya yest’ brat (oo mee-n’ah yest’ braht;
I have a brother)
 U myenya yest’ syestra (oo mee-n’ah yest’ sees-
trah; I have a sister)

Chapter 4: Enjoying Small Talk
75
If you want to say that you don’t have a brother, a
sister, a nephew, and so on, you use the construction
U myenya nyet (oo mee-n’ah n’eht) plus a noun in the
genitive case:
 U myenya nyet brata (oo mee-n’ah n’eht braht-
uh; I don’t have a brother)
 U myenya nyet syestry (oo mee-n’ah n’eht sees-
trih; I don’t have a sister)
The genitive plural forms of some family
members are irregular, and you need to
memorize them:
 brat’yev (braht’-yehf; brothers)
 syestyor (sees-tyor; sisters)
 synovyej (sih-nah-v’ehy; sons)
 dochyeryej (duh-chee-r’ehy; daughters)
 dyetyej (dee-t’ehy; children)
Where Do You Work?
Because what you do for living is crucial for
a Russian’s understanding of who you are, be
prepared to answer the question Kto vy po
profyessii? (ktoh vih puh-prah-f’eh-see-ee?;
What do you do for living? [literally: What’s
your job?])
To answer the question about your profession, you just
need the phrase Ya + your profession, as in Ya yurist
(ya yoo-reest; I am a lawyer) or Ya pryepodavatyel’
(ya pree-puh-duh-vah-t’ehl’; I am a professor). Here’s a
list of the most common professions:
 agyent po nyedvizhimosti (uh-g’ehnt puh need-
vee-zhih-muhs-tee; real-estate agent)
 aktrisa (ahk-tree-suh; actress)
 aktyor (ahk-tyor; male actor)
 archityektor (uhr-khee-t’ehk-tuhr; architect)

Russian Phrases For Dummies 
76
 bibliotyekar’ (beeb-lee-ah-t’eh-kuhr’; librarian)
 biznyesmyen (beez-nehs-m’ehn; businessman)
 bukhgaltyer (bookh-gahl-t’ehr; accountant)
 domokhozyajka (duh-muh-khah-zyahy-kuh;
homemaker)
 inzhyenyer (een-zhee-n’ehr; engineer)
 khudozhnik (khoo-dohzh-neek; artist, painter)
 muzykant (moo-zih-kahnt; musician)
 myedbrat (meed-braht; male nurse)
 myedsyestra (meed-sees-trah; female nurse)
 myenyedzhyer (meh-nehd-zhehr; manager)
 pisatyel’ (pee-sah-t’ehl’; author, writer)
 predprinimatyel (preht-pree-nee-mah-t’ehl; a
businessman or a businesswoman)
 programmist (pruh-gruh-meest; programmer)
 pryepodavatyel’ (pree-puh-duh-vah-t’ehl’; pro-
fessor at the university)
 studyent (stoo-d’ehnt; male student)
 studyentka (stoo-d’ehnt-kuh; female student)
 uchityel’(oo-chee-t’ehl’; male teacher)
 uchityel’nitsa (oo-chee-t’ehl’-nee-tsuh; female
teacher)
 vospitatyel’ (vuhs-pee-tah-t’ehl’; preschool
teacher)
 vrach (vrahch; physician)
 yurist (yu-reest; attorney, lawyer)
 zhurnalist (zhoor-nuh-leest; journalist)
 zunbnoj vrach (zoob-noy vrahch; dentist)
You can also specify where you work. Russian doesn’t
have an equivalent for the English “I work for United”
or “He works for FedEx.” Instead of for, Russian uses

Chapter 4: Enjoying Small Talk
77
its equivalent of at — prepositions v or na. Instead of
saying, “I work for United,” a Russian says, “I work at
United.”
The Russian prepositions v and na (at)
require that the noun denoting a place
should take the prepositional case. Here
are some of the most common places
people work. Say Ya rabotayu . . . (ya rah-
boh-tuh-yu . . . ; I work . . .) plus one of these
phrases:
 doma (doh-muh; from home)
 na fabrikye (nuh fah-bree-k’eh; at a light-industry
factory)
 na zavodye (nuh zah-voh-d’eh; at a heavy-
industry plant)
 v bankye (v bahn-k’eh; at a bank)
 v bibliotyekye (v beeb-lee-ah-t’eh-k’eh; in a
library)
 v bol’nitsye (v bahl’-nee-tseh; at a hospital)
 v byuro nyedvizhimosti (v b’u-roh need-vee-
zhih-muhs-tee; at a real-estate agency)
 v kommyerchyeskoj firmye (f kah-m’ehr-
chees-kuhy feer-m’eh; at a business firm, 
company)
 v laboratorii (v luh-buh-ruh-toh-ree-ee; in a

 v magazinye (v muh-guh-zee-n’eh; at a store)
 v shkolye (f shkoh-l’eh; at a school)
 v uchryezhdyenii (v ooch-reezh-d’eh-nee-ee; at

 v univyersityetye (v oo-nee-veer-see-t’eh-t’eh; at

Let’s Get Together: Giving and
Receiving Contact Information
Just before you’re about to take your leave
from a new Russian acquaintance, you proba-
bly want to exchange contact information.
The easiest way to do this is just hand over
your business card and say Eto moya vizit-
naya kartochka (eh-tuh mah-yah vee-zeet-
nah-yuh kahr-tuhch-kuh; This is my card
[literally: this is my visiting card]). In case
you don’t have a business card, you need to
know these phrases:
 Moj adryes . . . (mohy ah-dr’ehs . . . ; My address
is . . .)
 Moya ulitsa . . . (mah-ya oo-lee-tsuh . . . ; My
street is . . .)
 Moj nomyer doma . . . (mohy noh-m’ehr doh-
muh . . . ; My house number is . . .)
 Moj indyeks . . . (mohy een-dehks . . . ; My zip
code is . . .)
 Moj nomyer tyelyefona (moy noh-mer tee-lee-
foh-nuh . . . ; My telephone number is . . .)
After you give your contact info, be sure to get your
new friend’s address, phone number, and e-mail
address. You can use these phrases:
 Kakoj u vas nomyer tyelyefona? (kuh-kohy oo
vahs noh-meer tee-lee-foh-nuh?; What’s your
phone number?)
 Kakoj u vas adryes? (kuh-kohy oo vahs ahd-
r’ehs?; What’s your address?)
 Kakoj u vas adryes elektronnoj pochty? (kuh-
kohy oo vahs ahd-r’ehs eh-l’ehk-troh-nuhy pohch-
tih?; What’s your e-mail address?)

I’m Sorry! I Don’t Understand
When you first start conversing in Russian,
there will probably be a lot you don’t 
understand. You can signal that you don’t
understand something in several ways.
Choose the phrase you like best, or use
them all to really get the message across:
 Izvinitye, ya nye ponyal. (eez-vee-nee-t’eh ya
nee pohh-n’uhl; Sorry, I didn’t understand. 
[masculine])
 Izvinitye, ya nye ponyala. (eez-vee-nee-t’eh ya
nee puh-nee-lah; Sorry, I didn’t understand.
[feminine])
 Izvinitye, ya plokho ponimayu po-russki. 
(eez-vee-nee-t’eh ya ploh-khuh puh-nee-mah-yu
pah-roos-kee; Sorry, I don’t understand Russian
very well.)
 Govoritye, pozhalujsta, myedlyennyeye! (guh-
vah-ree-t’eh pah-zhahl-stuh m’ehd-lee-nee-eh!;
Speak more slowly, please!)
 Kak vy skazali? (kahk vih skuh-zah-lee?; What
did you say?)
 Povtoritye, pozhalujsta. (puhf-tah-ree-t’eh pah-

 Vy govoritye po-anglijski? (vih guh-vah-ree-t’eh

Whether you like homemade food or prefer to go

food is helpful.
Focusing on Food Basics
Russian has a rich variety of words and expressions
related to eating and drinking. In this section, we
tell you how to say you’re thirsty and hungry in
Russian, tell you how to talk about the different eating
utensils, and give you an overview of basic Russian
table etiquette.
Eating up
When Russians are hungry they don’t say
“I’m hungry.” Instead they say Ya khochu
yest’ (ya khah-choo yest’; I’m hungry

Russian Phrases For Dummies 
82
[literally: I want to eat). If you want to ask
somebody if he or she is hungry, you say:
 Ty khochyesh’ yest’? (tih khoh-chehsh’ yest’?;
Are you hungry? [literally: Do you want to eat?],
informal)
 Vy khotitye yest’? (vih khah-tee-t’eh yest’?; Are
you hungry? [literally: Do you want to eat?],
formal and plural)
In addition to these expressions, you may also hear
one of the following phrases:
 Vy golodnyj? (vih gah-lohd-nihy?; Are you
hungry?), when speaking to a male
 Vy golodnaya? (vih gah-lohd-nuh-yuh?; Are you
hungry?), when speaking to a female
 Vy golodnyye? (vih gah-lohd-nih-eh; Are you
hungry?), when speaking to multiple people
To answer these questions, you say:
 Ya golodnyj (ya gah-lohd-nihy; I’m hungry),
if you’re male
 Ya golodnaya (ya gah-lohd-nuh-’uh; I’m hungry),
if you’re female
Note that these phrases, however, have a
particular flavor. In Russia golod (goh-luht;
hunger) is a word that carries tragic histori-
cal connotations. So although it’s perfectly
acceptable to use the preceding expressions,
you should know that they also carry this
darker, secondary meaning.
Table 5-1 shows you how to conjugate the Russian
verb yest’ (yest’; to eat) for all the different
pronouns. It’s an irregular verb, so you just have to
memorize it.

whether he or she is thirsty, you say Ty
khochyesh’ pit’? (tih khoh-chehsh’ peet’?;
Are you thirsty? [literally: Do you want to
drink?], informal) or Vy khotitye pit’?
(vih khah-tee-t’eh peet’?; Are you thirsty? 
[literally: Do you want to drink?], formal).
The drinking verb pit’ (peet’; to drink) has an unruly
conjugation, as shown in Table 5-2.

Just as in English, the Russian statement
On/ona p’yot (ohn/ah-nah p’yot; He/she
drinks) in certain contexts can signify that the
person is an alcoholic. If that’s not your inten-
tion, you may want to add a direct object to
the sentence to clarify your meaning.
Some common napitki (nuh-peet-kee; beverages) you
may use as the direct objects are
 sok (sohk; juice)
 chaj (chahy; tea)
 kofye (koh-f’eh; coffee)
 vodka (voht-kuh; vodka)
 pivo (pee-vuh; beer)
 vino (vee-noh; wine)
 kvas (kvahs; a nonalcoholic beverage made of
bread)
To say “I drink coffee” in Russian, you say Ya p’yu
kofye (yah p’yu koh-f’eh). “I’m drinking vodka” is Ya
p’yu vodku (yah p’yu voht’-koo). Notice that, in this
sentence, vodka become vodku, the accusative-case
form of the noun, because it’s the direct object of the
sentence.

Using utensils and tableware
Here’s a list of the most common eating uten-
sils and tableware:
 blyudyechko (bl’u-deech-kuh; tea plate)
 chashka (chahsh-kuh; cup)
 chaynaya lozhka or lozhyechka (chahy-nuh-’uh
lohsh-kuh or loh-zhihch-kuh; teaspoon)
 glubokaya taryelka (gloo-boh-kuh-’uh tuh-r’ehl-
kuh; soup bowl)
 kruzhka (kroosh-kuh; mug)
 lozhka (lohsh-kuh; spoon)
 nozh (nohsh; knife)
 salfyetka (sahl-f’eht-kuh; napkin)
 stakan (stuh-kahn; glass)
 taryelka (tah-r’ehl-kuh; plate)
 vilka (veel-kuh; fork)
If you need to borrow a spoon from someone, you
may ask that person by saying Mozhno lozhku?
(mohzh-nuh lohsh-koo; Can I have a spoon?).
Making room for the 
Russian tea tradition
The famous Russian tradition called chayepitiye(chee-pee-tee-
eh) is derived of two words — chaj (chahy; tea) and the noun
pitiye(pee-tee-eh; drinking). Russians love tea almost as much
as Brits do and drink it in huge quantities, usually in big glasses.
In the old days, they used a samovar (suh-mah-vahr) — a spe-
cial, huge tea-kettle, placed in the middle of the table. Russians
usually drink tea with sakhar (sah-khuhr; sugar) and home-
made berry preserves called varayen’ye (vah-r’ehn-ye).

Russian Phrases For Dummies 
86
The construction Mozhno . . . (mohzh-nuh;
Can/May I have . . .) + a noun is quite
common in Russian. The noun takes the
accusative case.
Enjoying Different Meals
Russians eat three meals a day: zavtrak (zahf-truhk;
breakfast), obyed (ah-b’eht; dinner), and uzhin (oo-
zhihn; supper). But Russian meals have quite a few
peculiarities, which we tell you about in the following
sections.
Russian for “to cook” is gotovit’ (gah-toh-veet’). So, if
cooking is one of your hobbies, you can now proudly
say Ya lyublyu gotovit’ (ya lyub-lyu gah-toh-veet’; I
like/love to cook) when asked Vy lyubitye gotovit’?
(vih lyu-bee-t’eh gah-toh-veet’; Do you like to cook?)
What’s for breakfast? 
Almost anything!
The Russian breakfast is called zavtrak (zahf-
truhk). What can you eat for zavtrak? The
real question is what can’t you eat! In con-
trast to American cereal, fruit, or bagels, or
the British porridge, or the French croissant
and jam, the Russian zavtrak is very flexible.
Some Russian breakfast favorites include
 butyerbrod s kolbasoj (boo-tehr-broht s kuhl-
buh-sohy; sausage sandwich)
 butyerbrod s syrom (boo-tehr-broht s sih-ruhm;
cheese sandwich)
 kasha (kah-shuh; cooked grain served hot with
milk, sugar, and butter)
 kofye s molokom (koh-f’eh s muh-lah-kohm;
coffee with milk)

Chapter 5: Enjoying a Drink and a Snack
87
 kolbasa (kuhl-buh-sah; sausage)
 kyefir (kee-feer; kefir)
 syelyodka s kartoshkoj (see-lyot-kuh s kahr-
tohsh-kuhy; herring with potatoes)
 varyen’ye (vuh-r’ehn’-yeh; jam)
 yaichnitsa (ee-eesh-nee-tsuh; fried or scrambled
eggs)
If you’re not quite ready for syelyodka s kartoshkoj
in the morning, use the following words to order
Western-style breakfast foods:
 behkon (bee-kohn; bacon)
 bliny (blee-nih; pancakes)
 kasha (kah-shuh; cereal)
 kukuruznyye khlop’ya (koo-koo-rooz-nih-eh
khlohp’yuh; corn flakes)
 moloko (muh-lah-koh; milk)
 ovsyanka (ahf-s’ahn-kuh; oatmeal)
 sok (sohk; juice)
 tost (tohst; toast)
 yajtsa (yay-tsuh; boiled eggs)
 yaichnitsa (ee-eesh-nee-tsuh; fried/scrambled
eggs)
Let’s do dinner (not lunch)
Obyed (ah-b’eht; dinner) is the main meal of the day
and it’s usually eaten as a midday meal between 1
p.m. and 3 p.m. For their midday meal, Russians
enjoy a four-course meal consisting of zakuski
(zuh-koos-kee; appetizers), sup (soop; soup), vtoroye
(ftah-roh-yeh; the second or main course), and 
dyesyert (dee-s’ehrt; dessert), also called tryet’ye
(tr’eh-t’ye; third course).

Russian Phrases For Dummies 
88
The most popular Russian zakuski are
 baklazhannaya ikra (buh-klah-zhah-nuh-yuh
eek-rah; eggplant caviar)
 kapustnyj salat (kah-poost-nihy suh-laht; cab-
bage salad)
 salat iz ogurtsov i pomidorov (suh-laht iz ah-
goor-tsohf ee puh-mee-doh-ruhf; salad made of
tomatoes and cucumbers)
 salat olivye (suh-laht uh-lee-v’ye; meat salad)
 studyen’ (stoo-deen’; beef in aspic)
 syelyodka (see-lyot-kuh; herring)
 vinyegryet (vee-nee-gr’eht; mixed vegetable
salad made with beets, carrots, and pickle)
 vyetchina s goroshkom (veet-chee-nah s gah-
rohsh-kuhm; ham with peas)
After zakuski comes the sup. You have many different
kinds to choose from:
 borsh’ (bohrsh’; beet root soup)
 bul’yon (bool’-yon; broth)
 kurinyj sup (koo-ree-nihy soop; chicken soup)
 molochnyj sup (mah-lohch-nihy soop; milk soup)
 sh’i (sh’ee; cabbage soup)
 ukha (oo-khah; fish soup)
After the sup comes the main course, usually called
vtoroye (ftah-roh-eh; literally: second course). Here
are some typical Russian favorites:
 bifshtyeks (beef-shtehks; beefsteak)
 bifstroganov (behf-stroh-guh-nuhf; beef
stroganoff)
 gamburgyer (gahm-boor-geer; hamburger)
(Russians are still getting used to this one, but

Chapter 5: Enjoying a Drink and a Snack
89
they do prefer kotlyety to gamburgyery; old
habits die hard.)
 golubtsy (guh-loop-tsih; stuffed cabbage rolls)
 griby (gree-bih; mushrooms)
 kotlyety (kaht-l’eh-tih; ground meat patties)
 kotlyety s kartoshkoj (kaht-l’eh-tih s kuhr-tohsh-
kuhy; meat patty with potatoes)
 kuritsa (koo-ree-tsuh; chicken)
 makarony (muh-kuh-roh-nih; pasta)
 pitsa (pee-tsuh; pizza) (This one is a relative
novelty in Russian cuisine.)
 pyechyen’ (p’eh-cheen’; liver)
 ryba (rih-buh; fish)
 schnitzyel’ (shnee-tsehl’; schnitzel)
 sosiski (sah-sees-kee; frankfurters)
 zharkoye (zhuhr-koh-ee; any meat cooked in
an oven)
The main course is usually served with kartoshka
(kuhr-tohsh-kuh; potatoes), makarony (muh-kuh-roh-
nih; pasta), and ris (rees; rice), and it’s always served
with khlyeb (khlep; bread).
After the main course comes dyesyert (dee-s’ehrt;
dessert), or tryet’ye (tr’eh-t’ye; third course).
This course usually consists of some kind of
 kompot (kahm-poht; compote)
 kisyel’ (kee-s’ehl’; drink made of fruit and starch)
 morozhenoye (mah-roh-zhih-nuh-eh; ice cream)
 pyechyen’ye (pee-chehn’-eh; cookies)
 pirog (pee-rohk; pie)
 tort (tohrt; cake)

Russian Phrases For Dummies 
90
Some typical beverages that Russians drink in the
middle of the day are sok (sohk; juice), chaj (chahy;
tea), kofye (koh-f’eh; coffee), and voda (vah-dah;
water), although the latter doesn’t enjoy as much pop-
ularity as it does in the United States, for example.
A simple supper
The last meal of the day is called uzhin (oo-
zhihn; supper), and it’s usually eaten with
the family around the kitchen or dining room
table. Just as with obyed (dinner), soup and
a main course are often served for uzhin.
Butyerbrody (boo-tehr-broh-dih; open-sided
sandwiches) may also be served, and several
cups of chaj (chahy; tea) often conclude the
evening meal. Some other Russian supper
favorites include
 blinchiki (bleen-chee-kee; crepes)
 pyel’myeni (peel’-m’eh-nee; Russian ravioli)
 syrniki (sihr-nee-kee; patties made of cottage
cheese)
 tvorog so smyetanoj (tvoh-ruhk suh smee-tah-
nuhy; cottage cheese with sour cream)
Going Out for Groceries
If you want to make a quick trip to the produktovyyj
magazin (pruh-dook-toh-vihy muh-guh-zeen; grocery
store) or spend a leisurely day at the Russian rynok
(rih-nuhk; market), you have to know how to buy food
products in Russian.
Picking out produce
Buying produce at a farmers’ market is very
common. Russians are convinced that pro-
duce is much fresher there than in regular

Eating Out with Ease
Eating out at Russian restaurants and cafes can be a lot
of fun, especially if you know Russian. In the following
sections, we go over the different kinds of restaurants
you can go to, how to reserve your table, the right
way to order a meal, and how to pay your bill.

Russian Phrases For Dummies 
94
Deciding on a place to eat
You can find lots of different places to eat out, Russian-
style, depending on your mood and budget. If you’re
in the mood for a night of culinary delights, with a full
eight-course meal, lots of drinks, and live music,
check out a fancy Russian ryestoran (ree-stah-rahn;
restaurant).
A more affordable everyday option is a kafye
(kuh-feh; cafe), which can serve anything
from coffee and ice cream, to pancakes, to
pies. Cafes are usually privately owned and
have such interesting names (often unrelated
to food) that if you pass one of them on the
street, you may not even recognize it as a
place to eat! But if you follow that delicious
smell under your nose, you may wind up at
one of these delightful little places:
 blinnaya (blee-nuh-yuh; cafe that serves 
pancakes)
 chyeburyechnya (chee-boo-r’ehch-nuh-yuh; cafe
that serves meat pies)
 kafye-morozhenoye (kuh-feh mah-roh-zhih-nuh-
eh; ice-cream parlor)
 pirozhkovya (pee-rahsh-koh-vuh-yuh; cafe that
serves small pies)
 pyel’myennya (peel’-m’ehn-nuh-yuh; place that
serves Russian ravioli)
 pyshyechnaya (pih-shihch-nuh-yuh; donut
shop)
 stolovaya (stah-loh-vuh-yuh; dining room)
 zakusochnaya (zuh-koo-suhch-nuh-yuh;
snack bar)
After you decide which restaurant to go to,
pick up the phone and make a reservation:

Chapter 5: Enjoying a Drink and a Snack
95
 If you’re a man, say, Ya khotyel by zakazat’
stolik na syegodnya (ya khah-t’ehl bih zuh-kuh-
zaht’ stoh-leek nuh see-vohd-n’uh; I’d like to
reserve a table for tonight).
 If you’re a woman, say, Ya khotyela by zakazat’
stolik na syegodnya (ya khah-tye-luh bih zuh-
kuh-zaht’ stoh-leek nuh see-vohd-n’uh; I’d like to
reserve a table for tonight).
The art of ordering a meal
After you arrive at the restaurant and are seated by the
myetrdotyel’ (mehtr-dah-tehl; maitre d’), the ofitsiant
(uh-fee-tsih-ahnt; waiter) or ofitsiantka (uh-fee-tsih-
ahnt-kuh; waitress) will bring you a myenyu (mee-n’u;
menu). In a nice restaurant, all the dishes in the menu
are usually listed in English as well as Russian.
When you open the menu, you’ll notice it’s
divided into several subsections, which is
how items are usually eaten and ordered in a
Russian restaurant:
 zakuski (zuh-koos-kee; appetizers)
 supy (soo-pih; soups)
 goryachiye blyuda (gah-rya-chee-eh bly’u-duh;
main dishes)
 sladkiye blyuda (slaht-kee-eh bl’u-duh; dessert)
 alkogol’nye napitki (ahl-kah-gohl’-nih-eh nuh-
peet-kee; alcoholic drinks)
 bezalkogol’niye napitki (beez-uhl-kah-gohl’-nih-
eh nuh-peet-kee; nonalcoholic beverages)
When the waiter asks you Chto vy budyetye zakazy-
vat’? (shtoh vih boo-d’eh-t’eh zuh-kah-zih-vuht’?;
What would you like to order?), just say Ya budu +
the name of the item you’re ordering in the accusative
case. (For more on forming the accusative, see

Russian Phrases For Dummies 
96
Chapter 2.) For example, you may say something like:
Ya budu kotlyetu s kartofyelyem i salat iz pomi-
dorov (ya boo-doo kaht-l’eh-tih s kahr-toh-fee-l’ehm ee
suh-laht ees puh-mee-doh-ruhf; I’ll have meat patty
with potatoes and tomato salad).
The waiter may also ask you specifically Chto vy
budyetye pit’? (shtoh vih boo-dee-t’eh peet’?; What
would you like to drink?). To answer, you simply say
Ya budu (ya boo-doo; I will have) + the name of the
drink you want in the accusative case.
When you say Ya budu + the food or drink
item, what you’re really saying is Ya budu
yest’ . . . (ya boo-doo yest’ . . . ; I will eat . . .)
or Ya budu pit’ . . . (ya boo-doo peet’ . . . ; I will
drink . . .). The verbs yest’ (yest’; to eat) and
pit’ (peet’; to drink) force the noun coming
after them into the accusative case because
it’s a direct object. When you order, you skip
the verbs yest’ and pit’, but they’re implied.
Receiving and paying the bill
When it comes time to ask for the bill, don’t
expect the waiter to bring it automatically.
When the waiter is in the vicinity, try to attract
his attention by either waving or smiling to
him or just saying (loudly, if necessary —
Russians are very direct!) Rasschitajtye nas
pozhalujsta! (ruh-shee-tahy-t’eh nahs pah-
zhahl-stuh!; Check please!)
If the waiter returns before you ask him for the bill, he
may tell you how much you owe by saying S vas . . .
(s vahs; you owe [literally: from you is due . . .]).
If your meal costs 200 rubles 41 kopecks, the waiter
will say S vas dvyesti rublyej sorok odna kopyejka 
(s vahs dv’ehs-tee-roob-l’ehy soh-ruhk ahd-nah kah-
p’ehy-kuh; You owe two hundred rubles and forty-one
kopeks).

Where and How to Buy Things
the Russian Way
You can buy anything (other than food) in either a
univyermagi (oo-nee-veer-mah-gee; department
stores) or magaziny (muh-guh-zee-nih; stores). If
you’re looking for something specific, you’ll want to
check out some of the following stores:
 antikvarnyj magazin (uhn-tee-kvahr-nihy muh-
guh-zeen; antique store)
 aptyeka (uhp-tye-kuh; pharmacy)
 byel’yo (beel’-yo; intimate apparel)

 komissionnyj magazin (kuh-mee-see-ohn-nihy
muh-guh-zeen; secondhand store)
 kosmyetika (kahs-m’eh-tee-kuh; makeup)
 muzhskaya odyezhda (moosh-skah-yuh ah-

zeen; jewelry store)
 zhyenskaya odyezhda (zhehn-skuh-yuh ah-
d’ehzh-duh; women’s apparel)
The easiest way to find out whether a Russian store is
open is to go there and look for a sign hanging in the

Chapter 6: Shop ’Til You Drop!
99
door or window with one of these two words on it:
Otkryto (aht-krih-tuh; Open) or Zakryto (zuh-krit-tuh;
Closed). The next best way is just to call. Here are
some ways to ask about store hours:
 Do kotorogo chasa otkryt magazin? (duh kuh-
toh-ruh-vuh chah-suh aht-kriht muh-guh-zeen;
’Til what time is the store open?)
 V voskryesyen’ye magazin otrkryt? (v vuhs-
kree-s’ehn’-yeh muh-guh-zeen aht-kriht; Is the
store open on Sunday?)
 Kogda magazin zakryvayetsya? (kahg-dah muh-
guh-zeen zuh-krih-vah-eht-s’uh; When does the
store close?)
 Kogda zavtra otkryvayetsya magazin?
(kahg-dah zahf-truh uht-krih-vah-eht-s’uh 
muh-guh-zeen; When does the store open
tomorrow?)
You Wear It Well: Shopping 
for Clothes
Russian folk wisdom has it that people’s first
impression of you is based on the way you’re
dressed. That’s why you’re likely to see
Russians well-dressed in public, even in
informal situations. To keep up, you’ll want
the phrases in the following sections.
Seeking specific items of clothing
If you’re looking for outerwear, you want to go to the
store or department called vyerkhnyaya odyezhda
(v’ehrkh-n’eh-yuh ah-d’ehzh-duh; outerwear). There
you’ll find things like a
 kurtka (koort-kuh; short coat or warmer jacket)
 pal’to (puhl’-toh; coat)
 plash’ (plahsh’; raincoat or trench coat)

Russian Phrases For Dummies 
100
If you need a new pair of shoes, drop in to the store or

sandals)
 botinki (bah-teen-kee; laced shoes)
 krossovki (krah-sohf-kee; sneakers)
 sandalii (suhn-dah-lee-ee; sandals)

dashery) you can buy all kinds of little things, both

Describing items in color
What’s your favorite color? When picking out clothes,
you may want to tell the salesperson Ya lyublyu kras-
nyj tsvyet (ya l’oob-l’oo krahs-nihy tsveht; I like red 
[literally: I like the color red]) or Ya lyublyu zyelyonyj
tsvyet (ya lyub-lyu zee-lyo-nihy tsveht; I like green [liter-
ally: I like the color green]). Some common colors are
 byelyj (b’eh-lihy; white)
 chyornyj (chyor-nihy; black)
 goluboj (guh-loo-bohy; light blue)
 korichnyevyj (kah-reech-nee-vihy; brown)
 krasnyj (krahs-nihy; red)
 oranzhyevyj (ah-rahn-zhih-vihy; orange)
 purpurnyj (poor-poor-nihy; purple)
 rozovyj (roh-zuh-vihy; pink)
 siniy (see-neey; blue)
 syeryj (s’eh-rihy; gray)
 zhyoltyj (zhohl-tihy; yellow)
 zyelyonyj (zee-lyo-nihy; green)
The names for colors in Russian are consid-
ered adjectives. So when you’re describing
the color of an item you want, make sure the
color agrees in case, number, and gender
with the noun it modifies. (For more on
adjective-noun agreement, see Chapter 2.)
For example, a black hat in the nominative
case is chyornaya shlyapa (chohr-nuh-yuh
shl’ah-puh), a black dress is chyornoye
plat’ye (chohr-nuh-eh plaht’-yeh), and black
shoes are chyornyye botinki (chohr-nih-eh
bah-tehn-keh).

Chapter 6: Shop ’Til You Drop! 103
If you want to ask for a different shade of a color, use
the phrase A potyemnyeye/posvyetlyye yest’? (uh
puh-teem-n’eh-eh/puhs-veet-l’eh-eh yest’?; Do you
have it in a darker/lighter shade?). Other words that
may come in handy are odnotsvyetnyj (uhd-nah-tsveht-
nihy; solid), and raznotsvyetnyj (ruhz-nah-tsveht-nihy;
patterned).
Finding the right size
Here are some of the words and phrases you may
hear or say while searching for your right size:
 Razmehr (ruhz-m’ehr; size)
 Ya noshu razmyer . . . (ya nah-shoo ruhz-m’ehr; I
wear size . . .)
 Eto moj razmyer. (eh-tuh mohy ruhz-m’ehr;
This is my size.)
 Kakoj vash/u vas razmyer? (kuh-kohy vahsh/oo
vahs ruhz-m’ehr?; What’s your size?)
Trying on clothing
Before you decide you want to nosit’ (nah-seet; wear)
something, you probably want to try it on first. To ask
to try something on, you say Mozhno pomyerit’?
(mohzh-nuh pah-m’eh-reet’?; May I try this on?). You’ll
most likely hear Da, pozhalujsta (dah, pah-zhah-luh-
stuh; Yes, please).
When you try something on, and it fits you well, you
say Eto khorosho sidit (eh-tuh khuh-rah-shoh see-
deet; It fits). If it doesn’t fit, you say Eto plohkho sidit
(eh-tuh ploh-khuh see-deet; It doesn’t fit). Here are
some other adjectives you may use to describe the
clothes you’re considering buying:
 khoroshyj (khah-roh-shihy; good)
 plokhoj (plah-khohy; bad)
 bol’shoj (bahl’-shohy; big)

Russian Phrases For Dummies 
104
 malyenkij (mah-leen’-keey; small)
 dlinnyj (dlee-nihy; long)
 korotkij (kah-roht-keey; short)
Don’t forget when using these adjectives to
add the correct ending, which depends on
the case, number, and gender of the noun the
adjective refers to. (For more on adjective-
noun agreement, see Chapter 2.)
The item you’ve just tried on may turn out to be too
big or too small. To say something is too big, use this
construction: The name of the item + mnye (mn’eh; to
me) followed by
 vyelik (vee-leek; too big) for masculine nouns
 vyelika (vee-lee-kah; too big) for feminine nouns
 vyeliko (vee-lee-koh; too big) for neuter nouns
 vyeliki (vee-lee-kee; too big) for plural nouns
If the raincoat you just tried on is too big, for 
example, you say Etot plash’ mnye vyelik (eh-
tuht plahsh’ mn’eh vee-leek; This raincoat is too 
big for me).
If, on the other hand, something is too small, you say
the name of the item + mnye + one of the following:
 mal (mahl; too small) for masculine nouns
 mala (muh-lah; too small) for feminine nouns
 malo (muh-loh; too small) for neuter nouns
 maly (muh-lih; too small) for plural nouns

Chapter 6: Shop ’Til You Drop! 105
Expressing likes and dislikes
When people go shopping, they often base their final
decisions on one simple thing: You either like some-
thing or you don’t! To express that you like something
in Russian, you say Mnye (mn’eh; literally: to me) + a
form of the verb nravitsya (nrah-veet-s’eh; to like) +
the thing(s) you like. The verb must agree in number
(and gender, for past tense) with the thing(s) you like.
It’s a peculiar construction: What you’re saying liter-
ally is “To me, something is liked.” If you like a partic-
ular coat, for example, you say Mnye nravitsya eta
kurtka (mn’eh nrah-veet-s’uh eh-tuh koort-kuh; I like
this coat).
Table 6-1 has some other forms of the verb nravitsya
you may need to use, depending on the thing(s)
you’re talking about and the tense you’re using.

nravilos’ (neuter)
naravilis’ (plural)
Future
budyet nravit’sya (singular)
budut nravit’sya (plural)
If you want to express that you don’t like something,
you simply add nye (nee; not) before nravitsya, as in
Mnye nye nravitsya eta kurtka (mnye nee nrah-veet-
sye eh-tuh koort-kuh; I don’t like this coat).

Russian Phrases For Dummies

Comparing two items
To compare things, Russian uses comparative adjec-
tives like bol’shye (bohl’-sheh; bigger), myen’shye
(m’ehn’-sheh; smaller), luchshye (looch-sheh; better),
and khuzhye (khoo-zheh; worse). Just as in English,
you say the name of the item + the comparative adjec-
tives (for instance, bigger or smaller) + the word
chyem (chyem; than) + the other item. And here’s
some good news: Comparative adjectives do not need
to agree in case, number, and gender with the nouns
they refer to. They use the same form for every noun.
Say you’re trying on two pairs of shoes. You like the
second pair better: It’s more comfortable, lighter, and
cheaper, too. This is what you may be thinking to
yourself: Eti tufli udobnyeye, lyegchye, i dyeshyev-
lye chyem tye (eh-tee toof-lee oo-dohb-n’eh-eh l’ehkh-
cheh ee dee-shehv-l’eh chyem tye; These shoes are
more comfortable, lighter, and cheaper than those).
In addition to the words we use here, here are some
other commonly used comparative adjectives in
Russian:
 dlinnyeye (dl’eh-nye-eh; longer)
 dorozhye (dah-roh-zheh; more expensive)
 dyeshyevlye (dee-shehv-l’eh; cheaper)
 intyeryesnyeye (een-tee-r’ehs-n’eh-eh; more
interesting)
 kholodnyeye (khuh-lahd-n’eh-eh; colder)
 korochye (kah-rohch-cheh; shorter)
 krasivyeye (kruh-seh-v’eh-eh; more beautiful)
 tolsh’ye (tohl-sh’e; thicker)
 ton’shye (tohn’-sheh; thinner)
 tyazhyelyeye (tee-zhih-l’eh-eh; heavier)
 tyeplyeye (teep-l’eh-eh; warmer)

Chapter 6: Shop ’Til You Drop! 107
Talking about what you 
like most (or least)
When you look at several items (or people or things),
you may like one of them most of all. To communicate
this preference, you need to use the superlative form
of the adjective. Just like in English, Russian simply
adds the word samyj (sah-mihy; the most) before the
adjective and noun you’re talking about.
To express the superlative form of the adjec-
tive, put samyj before the neutral adjective
form, not the comparative adjective form, as
given in the previous section. For a list of
superlative adjective forms, see Table 6-2.
Samyj is an adjective and must agree in case,
number, and gender with the nouns and
other adjectives it modifies. (For details on
adjective-noun agreement, see Chapter 2.)
Table 6-2 has the forms of samyj you need
to use.

If one coat is the lightest of all the coats you tried on,
you may want to say Eta kurtka samaya lyogkaya
(eh-tuh koort-kuh sah-muh-ye lyohk-kuh-ye; This coat
is the lightest). If you’re particularly fond of one pair
of earrings, you can say Eti syer’gi samyye krasivyye
(eh-tee syer’-gee sah-mih-eh krah-see-vih-eh; These
earrings are the most beautiful ones).

Russian Phrases For Dummies 
108
To communicate that something is the worst in its
category, Russians today use the word samyj plokhoj
(sah-mihy plah-khohy; worst [literally: most bad]) for
masculine nouns, samaya plokhaya (sah-muh-yuh
plah-khah-yuh) for feminine nouns, samoye plokhoye
(sah-muh-eh plah-khoh-eh) for neuter nouns, and
samyye plokhiye (sah-mih-eh plah-khee-eh) for plural
nouns.
So if you particularly dislike one dress, you say Eto
plat’ye samoye plokhoye (eh-tuh plah-t’yeh sah-muh-
eh plah-khoh-eh; That dress is the worst [literally:
That dress is the most bad]).
You Gotta Pay to Play
To inquire about the price of any item, ask Skol’ko
stoit . . . ? (skohl’-kuh stoh-eet . . . ?; How much 
does . . . cost?). After you hear the price, you may
want to specify your question to avoid the confusion:
 Za kilogram? (zuh kee-lahg-rahm; Per kilo?)
 Za shtuku? (zuh shtoo-koo; Per item?)
 Za yash’ik? (zuh ya-sh’eek; Per box?)
When you’re buying several items or paying
for your meal at a restaurant, a good phrase
to use is Skol’ko s myenya? (skohl’-kuh s
mee-n’ah; How much do I owe?) Here are
some other good phrases:
 Eto ochyen’ dorogo. (eh-tuh oh-cheen’ doh-ruh-
guh; It’s very expensive.)
 Eto dyoshyevo! (eh-tuh dyo-shih-vuh; It’s cheap!)
 Ya voz’mu eto. (ya vahz’-moo eh-tuh; I’ll take it.)
 Ya eto kuplyu. (ya eh-tuh koo-pl’oo; I’ll buy it.)

Russian Phrases For Dummies

Here are common phrases people use to
invite you to do things with them:
 Pojdyom v . . . (pahy-dyom v . . . ; Let’s go to
the . . . [informal])
 Pojdyomtye v . . . (pahy-dyom-tye v . . . ; Let’s go
to the . . . [formal or plural])
 Davaj pojdyom v . . . (duh-vahy pahy-dyom v . . . ;
Let’s go to the . . . [informal])
 Davajtye pojdyom v . . . (duh-vahy-tye pahy-
dyom v . . . ; Let’s go to the . . . [formal or plural])
 Ty khochyesh’ pojti v . . . (tih khoh-chehsh’
pahy-tee v . . . ; Do you want to go to the . . .
[informal])
 Vy khotitye pojti v . . . (vih khah-tee-tye pahy-
tee v . . . ; Do you want to go to the . . . [formal
or plural])
To let everybody around know that you want to go
somewhere tonight, you may say Ya khochu pojti v . . .
syegodnya vyechyerom (ya khah-choo pahy-tee f . . .
see-vohd-nye vye-cheh-ruhm; I want to go to . . .
tonight).
After you ask someone to make plans with you (or
after someone asks you), the big question is whether
to decline or accept.
Russians don’t easily take nyet for an answer!
So if you need to decline an invitation, we
recommend softening your response with
one of the following:
 K sozhalyeniyu, ya nye mogu. (k suh-zhuh-lye-
nee-yu ya nee mah-goo; Unfortunately, I can’t.)
 Ochyen’ zhal’, no ya v etot dyen’ zanyat. (oh-
chyen’ zhahl’ noh ya v eh-tuht dyen’ zah-neet;
I am very sorry, but I am busy that day.)
 Mozhyet byt’, v drugoj dyen’? (moh-zhiht biht’
v droo-gohy dyen’?; Maybe on a different day?)

Chapter 7: Making Leisure a Top Priority 111
 Mozhyet, luchshye pojdyom v kafye? (moh-
zhiht looch-shih pahy-dyohm f kah-feh?; Maybe
we could go to a coffee shop instead?)
Here are some ways to spice up your da:
 Spasibo, s udovol’stviyem! (spah-see-buh s oo-
dah-vohl’-stvee-eem!; Thank you, I would be
happy to!)
 Bol’shoye spasibo, ya obyazatyel’no pridu.
(bahl’-shoh-eh spuh-see-buh, ya ah-bee-zah-teel’-
nuh pree-doo; Thank you very much, I’ll come
by all means.)
 Spasibo, a kogda? Vo skol’ko? (spah-see-buh
ah kahg-dah? vah skohl’-kuh?; Thank you, and
when? What time?)
Going Out on the Town
Whether going out with friends or family, you have
lots of options for your weekend entertainment.
On the big screen: Going to the movies
Feel like seeing a fil’m (feel’m; movie) this weekend?
Whereas English just uses the word theater for a movie
theater, Russian is more exact in expressing the differ-
ence between a movie theater and a play, opera, or
ballet theater. The word kino (kee-noh) or the more
formal kinotyeatr (kee-nuh-tee-ahtr) are the only
words you can use to denote movie theater in Russian.
Check out the following list for the names of different
film genres in Russian:
 dyetyektiv (deh-tehk-teef; detective film)
 ekranizatsiya khudozhyestvyennoj lityeratury
(eh-kruh-nee-zah-tsih-ye khoo-doh-zhihs-tvee-
nuhy lee-tee-ruh-too-rih; screen version of a book)
 fil’m uzhasov (feel’m oo-zhuh-suhf; horror film)

 komyediya (kah-mye-dee-ye; comedy)
 mul’tfil’m (mool’t-feel’m; cartoon)
 myuzikl (m’yu-zeekl; musical)
 nauhcnaya fantastika (nuh-ooch-nuh-ye fuhn-
tahs-tee-kuh; science fiction)
 priklyuchyenchyeskij fil’m (pree-klyu-chyen-
chees-keey feel’m; adventure film)
 trillyer (tree-lyer; thriller)
 vyestyern (vehs-tehrn; western)
If you decide to go to the movies, you need a bilyet
(bee-lyet; ticket). To ask for a ticket, customers often
use a kind of a stenographic language. Kassiry
(kuh-see-rih; cashiers) are generally impatient people,
and you may have a line behind you. So try to make
your request for a ticket as brief as you can. If you
want to go to the 2:30 p.m. show, you say one of these
phrases:
 Odin na chyetyrnadtsat’ tridtsat’. (ah-deen nah
chee-tihr-nuh-tsuht’ treet-tsuht’; One for 2:30.)
 Dva na chyetyrnadtsat’ tridtsat’. (dvah nah
chee-tihr-nuh-tsuht’ treet-tsuht’; Two for 2:30.)
It’s classic: Taking in the Russian
ballet and theater
If a Russian ballet company happens to be in
your area, don’t miss it! And if you’re in
Russia, don’t even think of leaving without
seeing at least one performance either in
Moscow’s Bol’shoy Theater or St. Petersburg’s
Mariinski Theater. No ballet in the world can
compare with the Russian balyet (buh-lyet;
ballet) in its grand, powerful style; lavish
décor; impeccable technique; and proud
preservation of the classical tradition.

Chapter 7: Making Leisure a Top Priority 113
The Russian teatr (tee-ahtr; theater) is just as famous
and impressive as the ballet, but most theater perfor-
mances are in Russian, so you may not understand a
lot until you work on your Russian for a while. Still, if
you want to see great acting and test your Russian
knowledge, by all means check out the theater, too!
When you buy tickets, you may hear Gdye vy khoti-
tye sidyet’? (gdye vih khah-tee-tee see-dyet’?; Where
do you want to sit?) or Kakoj ryad? (kah-kohy ryat?;
Which row?). If you prefer a centrally located seat,
you say V partyerye (f puhr-teh-ree; In the orchestra
seats). Here are some other seating options you may
want to consider, depending on your budget and
taste:
 lozha (loh-zhuh; box seat)
 byenuar (bee-noo-ahr; lower boxes)
 byel’etazh (behl’-eh-tahsh; tier above byenuar)
 yarus (ya-roos; tier above bel’ehtazh)
 galyeryeya (guh-lee-rye-ye; the last balcony)
 balkon (buhl-kohn; balcony)
During the antrakt (uhn-trahkt; intermission), take a
walk around the koridor (kuh-ree-dohr; hall) and
look at the pictures of the past and current aktyory
(uhk-tyo-rih; actors), aktrisy (uhk-tree-sih; actresses),
balyeriny (buh-lee-ree-nih; ballerinas), and rezhissy-
ory (ree-zhih-syo-rih; theater directors) that are usu-
ally displayed. Another thing you may want to do is
grab a bite to eat at the bufyet (boo-fyet; buffet),
which is designed to make you feel that coming to the
theater is a very special occasion. Typical buffet deli-
cacies are: butyerbrod s ikroj (boo-tehr-broht s eek-
rohy; a caviar sandwich), butyerbrod s kopchyonoj
ryboj (boo-tehr-broht s kuhp-chyo-nuhy rih-buhy; a
smoked fish sandwich), pirozhnyye (pee-rohzh-nih-ee;
pastries), shokolad (shuh-kah-laht; chocolate), and
shampanskoye (shuhm-pahn-skuh-ye; champagne).

Culture club: Visiting a museum
Russians are a nation of museum-goers. Visiting a
muzyej (moo-zyey; museum) is seen as a “culture”
trip. In almost every city, you’re likely to find the fol-
lowing museums to satisfy your hunger for culture:
 Etnografichyeskij muzyej (eht-nuh-gruh-fee-
chees-keey moo-zyey; ethnographic museum)
 Istorichyeskij muzyej (ee-stah-ree-chees-keey
moo-zyey; historical museum)
 Kartinnaya galyeryeya (kuhr-tee-nuh-ya guh-
lee-rye-ya; art gallery)
 Muzyej istorii goroda (moo-zyey ees-toh-ree-ee
goh-ruh-duh; museum of the town history)
 Muzyej istorii kraya (moo-zyey ees-toh-ree-ee
krah-ya; regional history museum)
Also, you may want to visit any of the large number of
Russian museums dedicated to famous and not-so-
famous Russian pisatyeli (pee-sah-tye-lee; writers),
poety (pah-eh-tih; poets), aktyory (uhk-tyo-rih; actors)
and aktrisy (uhk-tree-sih; actresses), khudozhniki
(khoo-dohzh-nee-kee; artists), uchyonyye (oo-choh-
nih-ye; scientists), and politiki (pah-lee-tee-kee; 
politicians). For example, in St. Petersburg alone, you
find the A. S. Pushkin museum, the F. M. Dostoyevsky
museum, A. A. Akhmatova museum, and many, many
more — almost enough for every weekend of the year!
Some other words and expressions you may need in a
museum are
 ekskursant (ehks-koor-sahnt; member of a tour
group)
 ekskursiya (ihks-koor-see-ya; tour)
 ekskursovod (ihks-koor-sah-voht; guide)
 eksponat (ihks-pah-naht; exhibit)
 ekspozitsiya (ihks-pah-zee-tsih-ye; display)
 iskusstvo (ees-koos-tvuh; arts)
 kartina (kuhr-tee-nuh; painting)

 putyevodityel’ (poo-tee-vah-dee-teel’; guidebook)
 skul’ptura (skool’-ptoo-ruh; sculpture or piece of
sculpture)
 vystavka (vihs-tuhf-kuh; exhibition)
 zal (zahl; exhibition hall)
 Muzyyej otkryvayetsya v . . . (moo-zyey uht-krih-

 Skol’ko stoyat vkhodnyye bilyety? (skohl’-kuh
stoh-eet fkhahd-nih-ee bee-lye-tih?; How much do
admission tickets cost?)
Shootin’ the Breeze 
about Hobbies
Before getting to the nitty-gritty of your khobbi (khoh-
bee; hobby or hobbies — the word is used for both
singular and plural forms), you probably want to test
the water so that you don’t exhaust your vocabulary
of Russian exclamations discussing Tchaikovsky with
someone who prefers boxing. To discover someone’s
likes or dislikes, you can ask one of the following:
 Chyem ty lyubish’ zanimat’sya? (chyem tih 
lyu-beesh’ zuh-nee-maht-suh?; What do you like
to do? [informal singular])
 Chyem vy lyubitye zanimat’sya? (chyem vih
lyu-bee-tee zuh-nee-maht-suh?; What do you like
to do? [formal singular; plural])
 Ty lyubish’ . . . ? (tih lyu-beesh’ . . . ?; Do you
like . . . ? [informal singular]) + the imperfective
infinitive of a verb or a noun in the accusative
case (see Chapter 2)
 Vy lyubitye . . . ? (vih lyu-bee-tee . . . ?; Do you
like . . . ? [formal singular; plural]) + the imper-
fective infinitive of a verb or a noun in the
accusative case (see Chapter 2)

Russian Phrases For Dummies

You use the verb lyubit’ (lyu-beet’; to love or
to like) to describe your feelings toward
almost anything, from borsh’ (borsh’; bor-
shcht) to your significant other. Saying Ya
lyublyu gruppu U2 (ya lyu-blyu groo-poo yu-
too; I like the band U2) isn’t too strong, and
this word is just right to express your feel-
ings for your family members, too: Ya lyublyu
moyu malyen’kuyu syestru (ya lyu-blyu mah-
yu mah-leen’-koo-yu sees-troo; I love my little
sister).
Table 7-1 shows you how to conjugate the verb lyubit’

Reading All About It
An American who has traveled in Russia observed
that, on the Moscow metro, half the people are read-
ing books and the other half are holding beer bottles.
But we don’t agree with such a sharp division. Some
Russians can be holding a book in one hand and a
beer bottle in the other! But, all joking aside, Russians
are still reported to read more than any other nation

Chapter 7: Making Leisure a Top Priority 117
in the world. So, get prepared to discuss your reading
habits.
Have you read it?
When you talk about reading, a handy verb to know
is chitat’ (chee-taht’; to read). This verb is a regular
verb. Here are some essential phrases you need in a
conversation about reading:
 Ya chitayu . . . (ya chee-tah-yu . . . ; I read/am
reading . . .) + a noun in the accusative case
 Chto ty chitayesh’? (shtoh tih chee-tah-yesh’?;
What are you reading? [informal singular])
 Chto vy chitayetye? (shtoh vih chee-tah-ee-tye?;
What are you reading? [formal singular; plural])
 Ty chital . . . ? (tih chee-tahl . . . ?; Have you

accusative case when speaking to a male

What do you like to read?
So you’re ready to talk about your favorite kniga

erature, some of which may sound very familiar:

 romany (rah-mah-nih; novels)
 stikhi (stee-khee; poems)
The conversation probably doesn’t end with your
saying Ya lyublyu chitat’ romany (ya lyu-blyu chee-
taht’ rah-mah-nih; I like to read novels). Somebody will
ask you: A kakiye romany vy lyubitye? (ah kuh-kee-
ee rah-mah-nih vih lyu-bee-tee?; And what kind of
novels do you like?). To answer this question, you can
simply say Ya lyublyu . . . (ya lyu-blyu; I like . . .) + one

 boyeviki (buh-ee-vee-kee; action novels)

 trillyery (tree-lee-rih; thrillers)
 vyestyerny (vehs-tehr-nih; Westerns)
Now you’re well-prepared to talk about literature, but
what about the news, political commentary, and
celebrity gossip? These phrases can help:
 gazyeta (guh-zye-tuh; newspaper)
 komiksy (koh-meek-sih; comic books)
 novosti (noh-vuhs-tee; the news)

Rejoicing in the Lap of Nature
Russians love nature. Every city in Russia has big
parks where numerous urban dwellers take walks,
enjoy picnics, and swim in suspiciously smelling
ponds. Even more so, Russians like to get out of town
and enjoy the nature in the wild. Luckily, the country’s
diverse geography offers a wide variety of opportuni-
ties to do so. In the following sections, you discover
how to make the most out of enjoying nature in
Russian.
Enjoying the country house
The easiest route to nature is through the dacha (dah-
chuh), which is a little country house not far from the
city that most Russians have. Poyekhat’ na dachu
(pah-ye-khuht’ nuh dah-choo; to go to the dacha) usu-
ally implies an overnight visit that includes barbecu-
ing, dining in the fresh air, and, if you’re lucky, banya
(bah-nye) — the Russian-style sauna. Some phrases
to use during your dacha experience include the 
following:
 natopit’ banyu (nuh-tah-peet’ bah-nyu; to pre-
pare the sauna)
 ogorod (uh-gah-roht; vegetable garden)
 rabotat’ v sadu (ruh-boh-tuht’ f suh-doo; to
garden)
 razvodit’ kostyor (ruhz-vah-deet’ kahs-tyor; to
make a campfire)
 sad (saht; orchard or garden)
 sobirat’ ovosh’i (suh-bee-raht’ oh-vuh-sh’ee; to
pick vegetables)
 zharit’ shashlyk (zhah-reet’ shuh-shlihk; to 
barbecue)

Skiing in the Caucasus
The Caucasus, a picturesque mountainous
region in the South of Russia, is easily acces-
sible by train or by a flight into the city of
Minvody. The best places to ski in the
Caucasus (called Kavkaz in Russian) include
Dombaj (dahm-bahy) and Priyel’brus’ye
(pree-ehl’-broo-s’ee). The word Priel’brus’ye
actually means “next to El’brus,” with El’brus
(ehl’-broos) being the highest mountain peak
in Europe (according to those who consider
the Caucasus a part of Europe).
Here are some phrases to help you organize your
skiing adventure:
 gora (gah-rah; mountain)
 gory (goh-rih; mountains)
 kanatka (kuh-naht-kuh; informal for cable cars)
 kanatnaya doroga (kuh-naht-nuh-ye dah-roh-
guh; cable cars)
 katat’sya na lyzhakh (kuh-taht’-suh nuh lih-
zhuhkh; to ski)
 kryem ot zagara (krehm uht zuh-gah-ruh; 
sunblock)

kahl; Lake Baikal) is an unforgettable vacation spot.

experience more enjoyable:

Doing Things with Your Hands
Exploring natural wonders and architectural gems is
fun, but so is discovering your internal treasures. In
the following sections, you find out how to talk about
nifty things you can do with your hands. Don’t be
shy — your talant (tuh-lahnt; talent) deserves to be
talked about!
Being crafty
If you’re one of those lucky people who can create
things with your hands, use the following words to
describe your craft:
 dyelat’ loskutnyye odyeyala (dye-luht’ luhs-
koot-nih-ee uh-dee-ya-luh; to quilt)
 lyepit’ (lee-peet’; to sculpt)
 lyepit’ iz gliny (lee-peet’ eez glee-nih; to make
pottery)

Russian Phrases For Dummies 
122
 pisat’ maslom (pee-saht’ mahs-luhm; to paint)
 risovat’ (ree-sah-vaht’; to draw)
 shit’ (shiht’; to sew)
 vyazat’ (veeh-zaht’; to knit)
To ask someone whether he or she can do one of these
crafts, use the verb umyet’ (oo-myet’; can) plus the
infinitive:
 Ty umyeyesh pisat’ maslom? (tih oo-mye-yesh’
pee-saht’ mahs-luhm?; Can you paint? [informal
singular])
 Vy umyeyetye vyazat’? (vih oo-mye-ye-tye vee-
zaht’?; Can you knit? [formal singular, plural])
To answer these kinds of questions, you can say:
 Da, ya umyeyu. (dah ya oo-mye-yu; Yes, I can.)
 Nyet, ya nye umyeyu. (nyet ya nee oo-mye-yu;
No, I can’t.)
Playing music
Do you like muzyka (moo-zih-kuh; music)? To talk
about playing a muzykal’nyj instrumyent (moo-zih-
kahl’-nihy een-stroo-myent; musical instrument), use
the verb igrat’ (eeg-raht’; to play) + the preposition na
(nah) and the name of the instrument in the preposi-
tional case.
You can ask the following questions:
 Ty umyeyesh’ igrat’ na . . . ? (tih oo-mye-yesh’
eeg-raht’ nah . . . ?; Can you play . . . ? [informal
singular]) + the name of the instrument in the
prepositional case
 Vy umyeyetye igrat’ na . . . ? (vih oo-mye-ee-tee
eeg-raht’ nah . . .?; Can you play . . . ? [formal sin-
gular; plural]) + the name of the instrument in
the prepositional case

Chapter 7: Making Leisure a Top Priority 123
Some musical instruments you may want to mention
include the following:
 baraban (buh-ruh-bahn; drum)
 flyejta (flyey-tuh; flute)
 gitara (gee-tah-ruh; guitar)
 klarnyet (kluhr-nyet; clarinet)
 pianino (pee-uh-nee-nuh; piano)
 saksofon (suhk-suh-fohn; saxophone)
 skripka (skreep-kuh; violin)
 trombon (trahm-bohn; trombone)
 truba (troo-bah; tuba)
Scoring with Sports
To talk about playing sports, use the verb zanimat’sya
(zuh-nee-maht’-suh; to engage in or to play a sport).
The name of the sport after this verb should be in
the instrumental case. The word for sports is sport
(spohrt); it’s always singular.
Zanimat’sya is a reflexive verb. That means
that at the end of it, you have a little –sya
particle that remains there no matter how
you conjugate the verb. This –sya particle is
what remained of syebya (see-bya; oneself).
The use of this particle directs the action
onto the speaker. Thus, zanimat’sya means
“to engage oneself.” The same verb without
the –sya particle, zanimat’, means “to engage
somebody else.” Reflexive verbs aren’t very
numerous in Russian — we warn you when-
ever we come across them.
You can ask somebody Ty zanimayesh’sya sportom?
(tih zuh-nee-mah-yesh-suh spohr-tuhm?; Do you play
sports? [literally: Do you engage in sports?]) You can
answer this question by saying one of two phrases:

Russian Phrases For Dummies 
124
 Da, ya zanimayus’ . . . (dah ya zuh-nee-mah-
yus’ . . . ; Yes, I play . . .) + the name of the sport
in the instrumental case
 Nyet, ya ne zanimayus’ sportom. (nyet ya nee
zuh-nee-mah-yus’ spohr-tuhm; No, I don’t play
sports.)
If you’re talking about a team sport that can also be
called an igra (eeg-rah; game), you can use the
expression igrat’ v (eeg-raht’ v; to play) + the name of
the sport in the accusative case. For instance: Ty
igrayesh’ v futbol? (tih eeg-rah-yesh’ f foot-bohl?;
Do you play soccer?)
Here’s a list of sports you may want to talk about:
 baskyetbol (buhs-keet-bohl; basketball)
 byejsbol (beeys-bohl; baseball)
 futbol (foot-bohl; soccer)
 gol’f (gohl’f; golf)
 tyennis (teh-nees; tennis)
 vollyejbol (vuh-leey-bohl; volleyball)
To talk about watching a game, you can use the verb
smotryet (smaht-ryet’; to watch).

Searching for a Job
A great Russian proverb summarizes Russians’ 
attitude to work: Rabota — nye volk, v lyes nye
ubyezhit. (ruh-boh-tuh — nee vohlk, v lyes nee oo-
bee-zhiht; Work isn’t a wolf, it won’t run away from
you into the forest.) In the following sections, you dis-
cover all you need to know about finding a job in
Russia.
Discovering where to look
Looking for a job in Russia isn’t much different
from job-searching elsewhere in the world. Your
options are

Russian Phrases For Dummies 
126
 Going to a kadrovoye agyentstvo (kahd-ruh-
vuh-eh uh-gyens-tvuh; recruiting agency)
 Posting your ryezyumye (ree-zyu-meh; résumé)
on a sajt po poisku raboty (sahjt pah poh-ees-
koo ruh-boh-tih; job finder Web site)
 Looking for an ob’yavlyeniye (uhb-yeev-lye-
nee-eh; announcement/ad) in a newspaper or a
magazine
 Harassing your friends
If you decide to go with option two, there are
three main online job sites: www.job.ru,
www.rabota.ru, and www.headhunter.ru.
The most popular newspapers that offer
employment information are Rabota dlya
vas (ruh-boh-tuh dlya vahs; Jobs for You),
Rabota i zarplata (ruh-boh-tuh ee zuhr-plah-
tuh; Jobs and Wages), and Elitnyj pyersonal
(eh-leet-nihy peer-sah-nahl; Elite Personnel).
Some phrases to look for when you’re scanning the ads:
 opyt raboty (oh-piht ruh-boh-tih; experience in
the field)
 otpusk (oht-poosk; vacation time)
 ryekommyendatsii (ree-kuh-meen-dah-tsih-ee;
recommendations)
 strakhovka (struh-khohf-kuh; insurance)
 vakansiya (vuh-kahn-see-ye; vacancy)
 zarplata (zuhr-plah-tuh; wage)
Contacting employers
When you identify a rabotodatyel’ (ruh-boh-tuh-dah-
teel’; employer) that you’re interested in, you want
poslat’ ryezyumye (pahs-laht’ ree-zyu-meh; to send a
résumé). You have several ways to do it; to find out

Chapter 8: When You Gotta Work 127
which way is preferred by the employer, you can ask
Mnye prislat’ ryezyumye . . . (mnye prees-laht’ ree-
zyu-meh; Should I send my résumé . . .) + one of the
following:
 po faksu? (puh fahksoo?; by fax)
 po elektronnoj pochtye? (puh ee-leek-troh-nuhy
pohch-tee?; by e-mail)
 po pochtye? (puh pohch-tee?; by mail)
A Russian résumé, unlike an American one,
includes your gender, birth date, and syemye-
jnoye polozhyeniye (see-myey-nuh-ee puh-lah-
zheh-nee-eh; marital status). Some employers
may even ask you to include your picture!
The next step is an intyerv’yu (een-tehr-v’yu; inter-
view). If you want to bring some supporting documents
to the interview, but you aren’t sure which ones to
bring, you may want to ask Kakiye dokumyenty
mnye prinyesti na intyerv’yu? (kuh-kee-eh duh-koo-
myen-tih mnye pree-nees-tee nuh een-tehr-v’yu?;
Which documents should I bring to the interview?)
The answers can include
 diplom (deep-lohm; diploma)
 razryeshyeniye na rabotu (ruhz-ree-sheh-nee-
eh nuh ruh-boh-too; work authorization)
 ryekommyendatsiya (ree-kuh-meen-dah-tsih-ye;
reference)
Clarifying job responsibilities
To find out about your obyazannosti (ah-bya-zuh-nuhs-
tee; job responsibilities), you need to ask questions.
A good place to start is with the following question:
Chto vkhodit v moi obyazannosti? (shtoh f khoh-deet
v mah-ee ah-bya-zuh-nuhs-tee?; What do my job
responsibilities include?)

The variety of professional skills is endless, but these
words are likely to be useful:
 pyechatat’ (pee-chah-tuht’; to type)

 rabotat’ s komp’yutyerom (ruh-boh-tuht’ s
kahm-p’yoo-teh-ruhm; to work with a computer)
Communicating in the
Workplace
The thing about the workplace is that you’re never
alone. You often need to talk to a kollyega (kah-lye-
guh; coworker), your nachal’nik (nuh-chahl’-neek;
boss), or a kliyent (klee-yent; client). In the following
sections, find out what to say in the workplace and
how to say it in Russian.
Making an appointment
Here are the standard phrases used to naznachit’
vstryechu (nuh-znah-cheet’ fstrye-choo; make an
appointment):
 Davajtye vstryetimsya v dyevyat’ chasov utra.
(duh-vahy-tee fstrye-teem-sye v dye-veet’ chuh-
sohf oo-trah; Let’s meet at 9 a.m.)
 Ya budu vas zhdat’ v tri chasa dnya. (ya boo-
doo vahs zhdaht’ f tree chuh-sah dnya; I’ll be
waiting for you at 3 p.m.)
If you’re arranging for a phone call, you can say:
 Ya budu zhdat’ vashyego zvonka v dyesyat’
chasov utra. (ya boo-doo zhdaht’ vah-shih-vuh
zvahn-kah v dye-seet’ chuh-sohf oo-trah; I’ll be
waiting for your phone call at 10 a.m.)
 Ya vam pozvonyu v dva chasa dnya. (ya vahm
puh-zvah-nyu v dvah chuh-sah dnya; I’ll call you
at 2 p.m.)

Chapter 8: When You Gotta Work 129
Sticking to workplace etiquette
Russian business etiquette is not as strict as that of
some other cultures. Just garnish your speech gener-
ously with pozhalujsta (pah-zhah-luh-stuh; please)
and spasibo (spuh-see-buh; thank you), and you’ll
already sound more formal than an average Russian
in the workplace.
The main thing you notice about Russian
dyelovoj etikyet (dee-lah-vohy eh-tee-kyet;
workplace etiquette) is that it’s less formal
than what you may be used to. Engaging in
humorous exchanges that fall far from politi-
cal correctness is considered normal, and
your coworkers are likely to throw plenty of
improvised parties at the office. Bosses and
clients, however, are excluded from these
friendly interactions, unless they decide to
set the playful tone themselves.
Always use the formal vy (vih; you [formal
singular and plural]) whenever you commu-
nicate with anyone in the workplace. If your
coworkers and, especially, your boss, want
to switch to less-formal terms, they’ll tell you
so. Wait for the initiative to come from them.
To avoid uncomfortable situations, always use
the first name + patronymic form to address
your colleagues. If they want you to switch to
the Western first-name manner, they’ll tell
you: Myenya mozhno zvat’ prosto Sasha.
(mee-nya mohzh-nuh zvaht’ proh-stuh sah-
shuh; You can call me simply Sasha.) For more
information on Russian names, see Chapter 3.
Here are some general polite phrases to use in the
workplace:
 Ya mogu vam chyem-nibud’ pomoch’? (ya mah-
goo vahm chehm-nee-boot’ pah-mohch?; Can I
help you with anything?)

Russian Phrases For Dummies 
130
 Bol’shoye spasibo, vy mnye ochyen’ pomogli.
(bahl’-shoh-eh spuh-see-buh, vih mnye oh-cheen’
puh-mahg-lee; Thank you very much, you
helped me a lot.)
Ringing Up Telephone Basics
Before you find out how to make a call, knowing a
little bit about the phone itself is helpful. In the fol-
lowing sections, we give you some basic vocabulary
related to phones and describe the different types of
phones and phone calls.
Brushing up on phone vocabulary
When somebody wants to talk to you, he may want
zvonit’ (zvah-neet’; to call) you. The caller needs
nabirat’ (nuh-bee-raht’; to dial) your nomyer 
tyelyefona (noh-meer tee-lee-foh-nuh; telephone
number), and when the call goes through, you hear
a zvonok (zvah-nohk; ring). Here are some other
important words related to the tyelyefon:
 byesprovodnoj tyelyefon (bees-pruh-vahd-nohy
tee-lee-fohn; cordless phone)
 diskovyj tyelyefon (dees-kuh-vihy tee-lee-fohn;
rotary phone)
 dolgij gudok (dohl-geey goo-dohk; dial tone 
[literally: long tone])
 gudok (goo-dohk; beep or tone)
 knopka (knohp-kuh; button)
 knopochnyj tyelyefon (knoh-puhch-nihy tee-lee-
fohn; touch-tone phone)
 kod goroda (kohd goh-ruh-duh; area code)
 korotkiye gudki (kah-roht-kee-ee goot-kee; busy
signal [literally: short tones])

Chapter 8: When You Gotta Work 131
 mobil’nyj tyelyefon (mah-beel’-nihy tee-lee-fohn;
mobile phone)
 myestnyj zvonok (myest-nihy zvah-nohk;
local call)
 myezdugorodnyj zvonok (myezh-doo-gah-rohd-
nihy zvah-nohk; long-distance call [literally:
intercity])
 myezhdunarodnyj zvonok (myezh-doo-nuh-
rohd-nihy zvah-nohk; international call)
 sotovyj tyelyefon (soh-tuh-vihy tee-lee-fohn;
cell phone)
 tyelyefonnaya budka (tee-lee-fohn-nuh-ye boot-
kuh; telephone booth)
 tyelyefonnaya kniga (tee-lee-fohn-nuh-ye knee-
guh; telephone book)
Russian makes a grammatical distinction
between calling a person, calling an institu-
tion, and calling a different city or a country.
The following rules apply. (See Chapter 2 for
more details about cases.)
 If you’re calling a person, use the dative case, as
in Ya khochu pozvonit’ Natashye. (ya khah-
choo puh-zvah-neet’ nuh-tah-shih; I want to call
Natasha.)
 If you’re calling an institution, after the verb, use
the preposition v or na + the accusative case to
indicate the institution you’re calling, as in
zvonit’ na rabotu (zvah-neet’ nuh ruh-boh-too;
to call work) or zvonit’ v magazin (zvah-neet’ v
muh-guh-zeen; to call a store).
 If you’re calling a foreign country or another
city, after the verb, use v + the accusative form
of the city or country you’re calling, as in zvonit’
v Amyeriku (zvah-neet’ v uh-mye-ree-koo; to call
the United States).

Basic telephone etiquette
Every culture has its own telephone etiquette, and
Russia is no exception.
When you make a phone call in Russia, the
person who answers may say:
 Alyo! (uh-lyo!; Hello!)
 Da. (dah; Yes.)
 Slushayu. (sloo-shuh-yu; I’m listening.)
In English, you often say something like
“Is John there?” Not so in Russian. In fact, a
Russian may not even understand what you
mean by that question. Instead, get to
your request right away, using the phrase
Mozhno . . . (mohzh-nuh . . . ; May I speak 
to . . .) + the name of the person you want
to talk to. If you want to talk to a woman
named Natalya Ivanovna, you say Mozhno
Natalyu Ivanovnu? (mohzh-nuh nuh-tahl’-yu
ee-vah-nuhv-noo?; May I speak to Natalya
Ivanovna?)
Note that you have to use the name of the
person you want to talk to in the accusative
case. That’s because what you’re saying is an
abbreviated Mozhno pozvat’ k tyelyefonu
Natalyu Ivanovnu? (mohzh-nuh pahz-vaht’ k
tee-lee-foh-noo nuh-tahl’-yu ee-vah-nuhv-noo?;
Can you call to the phone Natalya Ivanovna?),
and the verb pozvat’ (pahz-vaht’; to call)
requires that the noun after it is used in the
accusative case. (For more on the accusative
case, see Chapter 2.) You can make this
phrase more polite by adding the phrase
bud’tye dobry (bood’-tee dahb-rih; will you
be so kind) at the beginning.

Chapter 8: When You Gotta Work 133
Anticipating different responses
Here are some of the more common things
you may hear in response after you ask for
the person you want to speak to:
 If you call somebody at home and he or she is
not at home, you most likely hear Yego/yeyo
nyet doma. (ee-voh/ee-yo nyet doh-muh; He/she
is not at home.)
 If the person you call is at home but he or she is
not the one who answered the phone, you hear
Syejchas (see-chahs; Hold on) or Syejchas
pozovu (see-chahs puh-zah-voo; Hold on, I’ll get
him/her).
 When the person you want finally answers the
phone (or if he or she actually picked up the
phone when you called), he or she will say Alyo
(uh-lyo; Hello) or Slushayu (sloo-shuh-yu;
Speaking) or simply Da (dah; Yes).
 You probably have the wrong number if you
hear Kogo? (kah-voh; Whom?) If the person
knows you called the wrong number, you
most likely will hear Vy nye tuda popali.
(vih nee too-dah pah-pah-lee; You dialed the
wrong number.)
You can also check to make sure you dialed the
right number by saying something like Eto 
pyat’sot dyevyanosto vosyem’ sorok pyat’
dvadtsat odin? (eh-tuh peet-soht dee-vee-nohs-
tuh voh-seem’ soh-ruhk pyat’ dvaht-tsuht’ ah-
deen?; Is this five nine eight four five two one?
[literally: Is this five hundred ninety-eight forty-
five twenty-one?]) If you dialed another number,
you may hear Nyet, vy nyepravil’no nabirayete.
(nyet vih nee-prah-veel’-nuh nuh-bee-rah-ee-tee;
No, you’ve dialed the wrong number.)

Leaving a message with a person
If you call somebody and the person isn’t
available, you’ll probably hear one of these
phrases:
 A kto yego/yeyo sprashivayet? (uh ktoh yee-
voh/yee-yo sprah-shih-vuh-eet?; And who is
asking for him/her?)
 A chto yemu pyeryedat’? (uh shtoh yee-moo
pee-ree-daht’?; Can I take a message? [if the
person you’re leaving a message for is a man].)
 A chto yej pyeryedat’? (uh shtoh yey pee-ree-
daht’?; Can I take a message? [if the person
you’re leaving a message for is a woman].)
When you’re asked who is calling, say: Eto (eh-tuh;
This is . . . calling) + your name. Then you may simply
want to give your phone number and say Spasibo
(spuh-see-buh; thank you).
To ask to leave a message, begin your request with
A vy nye mozhyetye yemu/yey pyeryedat’? (uh vih
nee-moh-zhih-tee yee-moo/yey pee-ree-daht’?; Can I
leave a message for him/her? [literally: please, tell
him/her].)
No matter what your message is, it should
begin with the phrase Pyeryedajte 
pozhalujsta . . . (pee-ree-dahy-tee 
pah-zhah-luh-stuh; Please tell him/her . . .)
Most likely, you want to say
 Pyeryedajte pozhalujsta chto zvonil (pee-ree-
dahy-tee pah-zhah-luh-stuh shtoh zvah-neel;
Please tell him/her that . . . called) + your name
(if you are a man).
 Pyeryedajte pozhalujsta chto zvonila (pee-ree-
dahy-tee pah-zhah-luh-stuh shtoh zvah-nee-luh;
Please tell him/her that . . . called) + your name
(if you are a woman).

Talking to an answering machine
If you get an avtootvyetchik (uhf-tuh-aht-vyet-chee-keek;

pohs-lee seeg-nah-luh; The person you are calling is

When leaving a message, you can say some-
thing along these lines: Zdravstvujtye. Eto +
your name. Pozvonitye mnye pozhalujsta.
Moj nomyer tyelyefona + your phone number
(zdrah-stvooy-tee. eh-tuh . . . puhz-vah-nee-

Sending a Letter, a Fax, 
or an E-Mail
Strange as it may seem today in the age of e-mail and
cell phones, people still sometimes write and send
pis’ma (pees’-muh; letters).
The imperfective verb posylat’ (puh-sih-laht’;
to send) and its perfective counterpart
poslat’ (pahs-laht’) have different patterns
of conjugation. Although posylat’ is a nice
regular verb and poslat’ has nothing special
about it in the past tense, it has a peculiar
pattern of conjugation in the future tense,
shown in Table 8-1. (Check out Chapter 2
for more about verbs in general, including
imperfective and perfective verbs.)

Just as in English, when sending written correspon-
dence in Russian, it’s customary to address the
person you’re writing to with the word dear:
 uvazhajemyj (oo-vah-zhah-yee-mihy; dear 
[masculine]) + the person’s name
 uvazhajemaja (oo-vah-zhah-yee-muh-yuh; dear
[feminine]) + the person’s name
 uvazhajemyje (oo-vah-zhah-ye-mih-ye; dear
[plural]) + the people’s names
In more-formal situations, you should also include the
date in the upper left-hand corner.
The close of your letter may include the stan-
dard vash (vahsh; yours [formal]) or tvoj
(tvohy; yours [informal]) plus your name.
Or you use one of the following phrases,
depending on your intention and your rela-
tionship to the recipient:
 s uvazheniyem (s oo-vuh-zheh-nee-eem;
respectfully)
 s lyubov’yu (s lyu-bohv’-yoo; with love)
 tseluyu (tsih-loo-yoo; love [literally: I kiss you])
When you talk about imyeil (ee-meh-eel; e-mail) and
faks (fahks; fax), use the same verb pair of posylat’
and poslat’ (to send) as you do when you talk about
letters. For example, suppose you want to promise a
client that you’ll send him an e-mail; you simply say

Russian Phrases For Dummies 
138
Ya poshlyu tyebye imejl. (ya pahsh-lyoo tee-bye ee-
meh-eel; I’ll e-mail you.) If you promise to send him a
fax, you say Ya poshlyu tyebye faks. (ya pahsh-lyoo
tee-bye fahks; I’ll send you a fax.) You also use the
same verb pair when you attach documents to your
e-mail. Vlozhyennyj fajl/document (vloh-zhyeh-nihy
fahyl/duh-koo-myent; literally: an enclosed file/
document) or prikryeplyonnij fajl/document (pree-
krye-plyo-nihy fahyl/duh-koo-myent; an attached
file/document) are the two terms used most com-
monly to refer to an e-mail attachment.
If you want to ask somebody what his or her e-mail
address is, just say Kakoj u vas imyeil? (kuh-kohy
oo vahs ee-meh-eel?; What is your e-mail address? 
[literally: What is your e-mail?]) But before you ask
this question, you may want to make sure that this
person has an e-mail account by asking U vas yest’
imyeil? (oo vas yest’ ee-meh-eel?; Do you have e-mail?)
Other words and expressions associated with corre-
spondence include
 nomyer faksa (noh-meer fahk-suh; fax number)
 pis’mo (pees’-moh; letter)
 pochta (pohch-tuh; post office)
 pochtovyj yash’ik (pahch-toh-vihy ya-sh’eek;
mailbox)
 proverit’ pochtu (prah-vyeh-reet’ pohch-too; to

s the Russian proverb has it, Yazyk do Kiyeva
dovyedyot (ee-zihk dah kee-ee-vuh duh-vee-
dyot), which translates as “Your tongue will lead you
to Kiev,” and basically means, “Ask questions, and
you’ll get anywhere.” This chapter gives you all the
phrases you need to navigate your way through the
transportation maze.
Understanding Verbs of Motion
Every language has a lot of words for things the
speakers of that language know well. That’s why the
Eskimos have 12 different words for snow. Russians
have a lot of space to move around — maybe that’s
why they have so many different verbs of motion.
Your choice of verb depends on many different fac-
tors and your intended message. To mention just a
few factors, the choice depends on

Russian Phrases For Dummies 
140
 Whether the motion is performed with a vehicle
or without it
 Whether the motion indicates a regular, habitual
motion
 Whether the motion takes place at the moment
of speaking
Going by foot or vehicle habitually
To indicate regular habitual motion in the present
tense, you use the multidirectional verbs khodit’
(khah-deet’; to go on foot) and yezdit’ (yez-deet’; to go
by vehicle). Think of places that you go to once a
week, every day, two times a month, once a year, or
every weekend. Most folks, for example, have to go to
work every day. In Russian you say:
 Ya khozhu na rabotu kazhdyj dyen’ (ya khah-
zhoo nuh ruh-boh-too kahzh-dihy dyen’; I go to
work every day) if you go by foot. (The verb
khodit’ is conjugated in Table 9-1.)
 Ya yezzhu na rabotu kazhdyj dyen’ (ya yez-
zhoo nuh ruh-boh–too kahzh-dihy dyen’; I go to
work every day) if you go by vehicle. (The verb
yezdit’ is conjugated in Table 9-2.)
When you talk about walking, you also can
use the expression khodit’ pyeshkom (khah-
deet’ peesh-kohm; to go by foot, to walk).
This expression sounds redundant, but that’s
the way it’s used in Russian.

see; to go by bus)
 yezdit’ na marshrutkye (yez-deet’ nah muhr-

 yezdit’ na mashinye (yiez-deet’ nah muh-shih-

to go by train)
 yezdit’ na taksi (yez-deet’ nah tuhk-see; to go
by taxi)
Going by foot or vehicle 
at the present time
You use different verbs (called unidirectional verbs) to
specify that you’re moving in a specific direction or to
a specific place. You also use these verbs to indicate
motion performed at the present moment.
For walking, use the verb idti (ee-tee; to go in one
direction by foot), such as in the phrase Ya idu na
rabotu (ya ee-doo nuh ruh-boh-too; I am walking to
work). The verb idti is conjugated in Table 9-3.

cle). The verb yekhat’ is conjugated in Table 9-4.

Explaining where you’re going
To tell where you’re going specifically, use the prepo-
sitions v (v; to) or na (nah; to) + the accusative case
of the place you’re going:
 Ya idu v tyeatr. (ya ee-doo f tee-ahtr; I am going
to the theater.)
 Ona idyot na kontsyert. (ah-nah ee-dyot nuh
kahn-tsehrt; She is going to the concert.)
For walking or driving around a place, use the prepo-
sition po (pah; around) + the dative case. (For more
information on cases, see Chapter 2.)
 Ona khodit po Moskvye. (ah-nah khoh-deet puh
mahsk-vye; She walks around Moscow.)
 My yezdim po tsyentru goroda. (mih yez-deem
pah tsehnt-roo goh-ruh-duh; We drive around
downtown.)
Remember to use yezdit’ or yekhat’ (to go
by vehicle) when you talk about going to
other cities! Otherwise, if you say ya idu v
Moskvu (ya ee-doo v mahsk-voo), you make

it sound as though you’re embarking on an
enduring walking pilgrimage to Moscow,
which is probably not your intention.
Navigating the Airport
The vocabulary in this section helps you plan and
enjoy your trip by samolyot (suh-mah-lyot; plane).
You use a special verb of motion when you talk about
flying: lyetyet’ (lee-tyet’; to fly). You can’t use the verb
yekhat’ when you talk about traveling by plane,
unless the plane is wheeling around the airport with-
out actually leaving the ground. If the plane actually
takes off, you have to use the verb lyetyet’.
Checking in and boarding your flight
When you arrive at the aeroport (ah-eh-rah-pohrt; air-
port), the following words will help you navigate:
 bilyet (bee-lyet; ticket)
 informatsionnoye tablo (een-fuhr-muh-tsih-oh-
nuh-ye tahb-loh; departures and arrivals display)
 myesto u okna (myes-tuh oo ahk-nah;
window seat)
 myesto u prokhoda (myes-tuh oo prah-khoh-
duh; aisle seat)
 myetalloiskatyel’ (mee-tah-luh-ees-kah-teel’;
metal detector)
 nomyer ryejsa (noh-meer ryey-suh; flight
number)
 otpravlyeniye (uht-pruhv-lye-nee-eh; departures)
 pasport (pahs-puhrt; passport)
 posadochnyj talon (pah-sah-duhch-nihy tuh-
lohn; boarding pass)
 pribytiye (pree-bih-tee-eh; arrivals)

Chapter 9: I Get Around: Transportation 145
 ruchnoj bagazh (rooch-nohy buh-gahsh; carryon)
 ryegistratsiya (ree-geest-rah-tsih-ye; check-in)
 sluzhba byezopasnosti (sloozh-buh bee-zah-
pahs-nuhs-tee; security service)
Here are some questions you may hear or ask as you
check in:
 Vy budyetye sdavat’ bagazh? (vih boo-dee-tee
zdah-vaht’ buh-gahsh?; Are you checking any
luggage?)
 Vy ostavlyali vash bagazh byez prismotra? (vih

 Kakoj u myenya nomyer vykhoda? (kuh-kohy
oo mee-nya noh-meer vih-khuh-duh?; What’s my
gate number?)
 Eto ryejs v . . . ? (eh-tuh ryeys v . . . ?; Is this the
flight to . . . ?)
Handling passport control and Customs
After leaving the plane and walking through a corridor
maze, you see a crowded hall with pasportnyj kontrol’
(pahs-puhrt-nihy kahnt-rohl’; passport control).
Make sure you get into the right line: One line is for
grazhdanye Rossii (grahzh-duh-nee rah-see-ee; Russian
citizens), and one is for inostranniye grazhdanye
(ee-nahs-trah-nih-ee grahzh-duh-nee; foreign citizens).
At passport control, you show your pasport
(pahs-puhrt; passport) and viza (vee-zah; visa). A
pogranichnik (puhg-ruh-neech-neek; border official)
asks you Tsyel’ priyezda? (tsehl’ pree-yez-duh; The
purpose of your visit?) You may answer:
 chastnyj vizit (chahs-nihy vee-zeet; private visit)
 rabota (ruh-boh-tuh; work)
 turizm (too-reezm; tourism)
 uchyoba (oo-choh-buh; studies)

Russian Phrases For Dummies 
146
After you pick up your bagazh, the next step is going
through tamozhyennyj dosmotr (tuh-moh-zhih-nihy
dahs-mohtr; Customs). The best way to go is zyelyonyj
koridor (zee-lyo-nihy kuh-ree-dohr; nothing to declare
passage way [literally: green corridor]). Otherwise,
you have to deal with tamozhyenniki (tuh-moh-zhih-
nee-kee; Customs officers) and answer the question
Chto dyeklariruyete? (shtoh deek-luh-ree-roo-ee-tee;
What would you like to declare?)
To answer, say Ya dyeklariruyu . . . (ya deek-luh-ree-
roo-yu; I’m declaring . . .) + the word for what you are
declaring in the accusative case. The following items
usually need to be declared:
 alkogol’ (uhl-kah-gohl’; alcohol)
 dragotsyennosti (druh-gah-tseh-nuhs-tee; jewelry)
 proizvyedyeniya iskusstva (pruh-eez-vee-dye-
nee-ye ees-koost-vuh; works of art)
Conquering Public
Transportation
Russians hop around their humongous cities with but-
terfly ease, changing two to three means of public
transportation during a one-way trip to work. And so
can you. You just need to know where to look for the
information and how to ask the right questions, which
you discover in the following sections.
Taking a taxi
When you call the sluzhba taksi (sloozh-buh
tuhk-see; cab service), they ask:
 vash adryes (vahsh ahd-rees; your address)
 Kuda yedyetye? (koo-dah ye-dee-tee; Where are
you going?)

Chapter 9: I Get Around: Transportation 147
You use kuda (koo-dah; where to) rather than
gdye (gdye; where) when you’re asking about
movement toward a destination. You can think
of kuda as meaning “Where to?” and gdye as
simply “Where?” Likewise, you use tuda (too-
dah; to there) instead of tam (tahm; there)
when you want to emphasize movement
toward a destination. Simply stated: With
verbs of motion, you usually use kuda rather
than gdye, and tuda rather than tam.
You can ask for your fare while you’re ordering your
cab: Skol’ko eto budyet stoit’? (skohl’-kuh eh-tuh boo-
deet stoh-eet’?; How much would that be?) This fare is
usually nonnegotiable. If you hail a cab in the street,
however, you have plenty of room for negotiating.
You don’t need davat’ chayevye (duh-vaht’
chee-ee-vih-ee; to give a tip) to cab drivers in
Russia.
Using minivans
The transport of choice in today’s Russia is
the marshrutka (muhr-shroot-kuh), a minivan
with a set route. Marshrutki (muhr-shroot-
kee; minivans) are usually fast and often go
to any destination. They stop only where
passengers need to get off, so make sure you
tell the driver something like Ostanovitye,
pozhalujsta, u vokzala? (uh-stuh-nah-vee-tee
pah-zhah-luh-stuh oo vahk-zah-luh?; Would
you please stop at the railway station?)
Marshrutki have different routes, marked by num-
bers. You can recognize a marshrutka by a piece of
paper with its number in the front window. To board a
marshrutka, you need to go to a place where it stops.
These places aren’t usually marked, so you need to
ask a local Gdye ostanavlivayutsya marshrutki?
(gdye uhs-tuh-nahv-lee-vuh-yut-sye muhr-shroot-kee?;
Where do the minivans stop?)

Russian Phrases For Dummies

Catching buses, trolley 
buses, and trams
The first difficulty with all this variety of Russian
public transportation is that, in English, all these
things are called “buses.” Here’s a short comprehen-
sive guide on how to tell one item from another:
 avtobus (uhf-toh-boos): A bus as you know it
 trollyejbus (trah-lyey-boos): A bus connected to
electric wires above
 tramvaj (truhm-vahy): A bus connected to elec-
tric wires and running on rails
Unless you’re into orienteering, the best way to find
your route is to ask the locals. Just ask these questions:
 Kak mnye doyekhat’ do Krasnoj Plosh’adi?
(kahk mnye dah-ye-khuht’ dah krahs-nuhy ploh-
sh’ee-dee?; How can I get to the Red Square?)
 Etot avtobus idyot do Ermitazha? (eh-tuht 
uhf-toh-boos ee-dyot duh ehr-mee-tah-zhuh?;
Will this bus take me to the Hermitage?)
 Gdye mozhno kupit’ bilyety? (gdye mohzh-nuh
koo-peet’ bee-lye-tih?; Where can I buy tickets?)
Ways to pay for a bus ride vary. In some cities,
you need to buy bilyety (bee-lye-tih; tickets)
ahead of time in kioski (kee-ohs-kee; ticket
kiosks). In others, you pay directly to the
vodityel’ (vah-dee-teel’; driver) or konduktor
(kahn-dook-tuhr; bus conductor) when you
board the bus.
Hopping onto the subway
The Russian myetro (mee-troh; subway) is beautiful,
clean, user-friendly, and cheap. It connects the most
distant parts of such humongous cities as Moscow,
and it’s impenetrable to traffic complications. During
the day, trains come every two to three minutes.
Unfortunately, it’s usually closed between 1:30 a.m.

Chapter 9: I Get Around: Transportation 149
and 4:30 a.m. Around 4:30 a.m., you can easily locate a
stantsiya myetro (stahn-tsee-ye meet-roh; subway sta-
tion) on a Moscow street by a crowd of young people
in clubbing clothes waiting for the myetro to open so
they can go home.
To take the myetro, you need to buy a kartochka
(kahr-tuhch-kuh; fare card) for any number of trips or
a proyezdnoj (pruh-eez-nohy; pass). Both are available
in the vyestibyul’ myetro (vees-tee-byul meet-roh;
metro foyer).
Hopping on a train
Trains are a great way to travel. The types of trains, in
the order of increasing price and quality, are
 elyektrichka (eh-leek-treech-kuh; a suburban
train)
 skorostnoj poyezd (skuh-rahs-nohy poh-ehst; a
low-speed train)
 skoryj poyezd (skoh-rihy poh-ehst; a faster and
more expensive train)
 firmyennyj poyezd (feer-mee-nihy poh-eehst; a
premium train [literally: company train])
You can kupit’ bilyety (koo-peet’ bee-lye-tih; buy tick-
ets) directly at the railway station, at a travel agency,
or in a zhyelyeznodorozhnyye kassy (zhih-lyez-nuh-
dah-rohzh-nih-ee kah-sih; railway ticket office).
You can start your dialogue with Mnye nuzhyen
bilyet v (mnye noo-zheen bee-lyet v; I need a ticket to)
+ the name of the city you’re heading for, in the
accusative case (see Chapter 2 for more on cases).
The ticket salesperson will probably ask you the fol-
lowing questions:
 Na kakoye chislo? (nuh kuh-koh-eh chees-loh?;
For what date?)
 Vam kupye ili platskart? (vahm koo-peh ee-lee
pluhts-kahrt?; Would you like a compartment car
or a reserved berth?)

Russian Phrases For Dummies 
150
 V odnu storonu ili tuda i obratno? (v ahd-noo
stoh-ruh-noo ee-lee too-dah ee ah-braht-nuh?;
One way or round trip?)
You can also tell the ticket salesperson what kind of
seat you prefer: vyerkhnyaya polka (vyerkh-nee-ye
pohl-kuh; top fold-down bed) or nizhnyaya polka
(neezh-nye-ye pohl-kuh; bottom fold-down bed).
On elyektrichki (eh-leek-treech-kee; suburban trains),
which don’t have fold-down beds, seats aren’t assigned.
Asking “Where” and 
“How” Questions
When in doubt, just ask! In the following sections you
discover how to ask for directions with two simple
words: where and how.
Where is it?
Russian uses two words to translate the
English where — gdye (gdye; where) or kuda
(koo-dah; where). But you can’t use the two
words interchangeably. The following is what
you need to know about these words:
 If “where” indicates location rather than direction
of movement and you aren’t using the so-called
verbs of motion (to go, to walk, to drive, and so
on), use the word gdye (where).
 If “where” indicates direction of movement rather
than location, or in other words is used in a sen-
tence with verbs of motion (to go, to walk, to
drive, and so on), use the word kuda (where).
So if you’re inquiring about location or destination
you can ask:

Chapter 9: I Get Around: Transportation 151
Gdye blizhayshaya ostanovka avtobusa? (gdye
blee-zhahy-shuh-ye uhs-tuh-nohf-kuh uhf-toh-
boo-suh?; Where is the nearest bus stop?)
Gdye bibliotyeka? (gdye beeb-lee-ah-tye-kuh?;
Where is the library?)
But if you’re asking about direction, you ask:
Kuda idyot etot avtobus? (koo-dah ee-dyot eh-
tuht uhf-toh-boos?; Where is this bus going?)
How do I get there?
To ask how to get somewhere — say, the
muzyyej (moo-zyey; museum) — you need
the verb popast’ (pah-pahst’; to get to).
This verb, too, belongs to the category of
verbs of motion.
Kak ya otsyuda mogu popast’ v muzyej? (kahk
ya aht-syu-duh mah-goo pah-pahst’ v moo-zyey?;
How do I get to the museum from here?)
Or you may want to make your question more 
impersonal by saying Kak otsyuda mozhno popast’ v
(How does one get to . . . ?):
Kak otsyuda mozhno popast’ v muzyej? (kaht
aht-syu-duh mohzh-nuh pah-pahst’ v moo-zyey?;
How does one get to the museum from here?)
Understanding Specific Directions
When you’re done asking for directions, you need to
understand what you’re being told. In the following
sections, you find out about prepositions and other
words people use when talking about directions in
Russian.

Russian Phrases For Dummies 
152
Recognizing prepositions
Russian uses the same prepositions, v/na, to express
both “to (a place)” and “in/at (a place).” When you
use v/na to indicate movement, the noun indicating
the place of destination takes the accusative case.
If v/na is used to denote location, the noun denoting
location is used in prepositional case. Compare these
two sentences:
 Ya idu v bibliotyeku. (ya ee-doo v beeb-lee-ah-
tye-koo; I am going to the library.)
 Ya v bibliotyekye. (ya v beeb-lee-ah-tye-kee; I
am at the library.)
So when do you use na and when do you
use v? The choice of the preposition depends
on the noun it’s used with. With most nouns,
Russian speakers use v. But a number of
nouns, such as those in the following list,
require na (you just need to remember them).
 na lyektsiyu/na lyektsii (nuh lyek-tsih-yu/nuh
lyek-tsih-ee; to a lecture/at a lecture)
 na stantsiyu/na stantsii (nuh stahn-tsih-yu/nuh
stahn-tsih-ee; to a station/at a station)
 na urok/na urokye (nuh oo-rohk/nuh oo-roh-
kee; to a class/at a class)
 na vokzal/na vokzalye (nuh vahk-zahl/nuh
vahk-zah-lee; to a railway station/at a railway
station)
Some other prepositions that are helpful in
directions are:
 okolo (oh-kuh-luh; near) + a noun in the
genitive case
 ryadom s (rya-duhm s; next to) + a noun in the
instrumental case

Chapter 9: I Get Around: Transportation 153
 naprotiv (nuh-proh-teef; opposite, across from)
+ a noun in the genitive case
 za (zah; behind, beyond) + a noun in the instru-
mental case
 pozadi (puh-zuh-dee; behind) + a noun in the
genitive case
 pyered (pye-reet; in front of) + a noun in the
instrumental case
 myezhdu (myezh-doo; between) + a noun in the
instrumental case
 vnutri (vnoo-tree; inside) + a noun in the geni-
tive case
 snaruzhi (snuh-roo-zhih; outside) + a noun in
the genitive case
 nad (naht; above) + a noun in the instrumen-
tal case
 pod (poht; below) + a noun in the instrumen-
tal case
Keeping “right” and “left” straight
When people give you directions, they also often use
these words:
 sprava ot (sprah-vuh uht; to the right of) + a
noun in the genitive case
 napravo (nuh-prah-vuh; to the right)
 slyeva ot (slye-vuh uht; to the left of) + a noun in
the genitive case
 nalyevo (nuh-lye-vuh; to the left)
 na lyevoj storonye (nuh lye-vuhy stuh-rah-nye;
on the left side)
 na pravoj storonye (nuh prah-vahy stuh-rah-
nye; on the right side)

Russian Phrases For Dummies 
154
Here’s a short exchange that may take place between
you and a friendly-looking Russian woman:
You: Izvinitye, gdye magazin? (eez-vee-nee-tee
gdye muh-guh-zeen?; Excuse me, where is the
store?)
The woman: Magazin sprava ot aptyeki. (muh-
guh-zeen sprah-vuh uht uhp-tye-kee; The store is
to the right of the pharmacy.)
Making sense of commands
Here are some useful phrases in the imperative mood
you may hear or want to use when giving directions:
 Iditye praymo. (ee-dee-tee prya-muh; Go
straight.)
 Iditye nazad. (ee-dee-tee nuh-zaht; Go back.)
 Iditye pryamo do . . . (ee-dee-tee prya-muh duh;
Go as far as . . .) + the noun in the genitive case
 Podojditye k . . . (puh-duhy-dee-tee k; Go up 
to . . .) + the noun in the dative case
 Iditye po . . . (ee-dee-tee puh; Go down along . . .)
+ the noun in the dative case
 Iditye mimo . . . (ee-dee-tee mee-muh; Pass 
by . . .) + the noun in the genitive case
 Povyernitye nalyevo! (puh-veer-nee-tee nuh-
lye-vuh; Turn left or take a left turn.)
 Povyernitye napravo! (puh-veer-nee-tee nuh-
prah-vuh; Turn right or take a right turn.)
 Zavyernitye za ugol! (zuh-veer-nee-tee zah-oo-
guhl; Turn around the corner.)
 Pyeryejditye ulitsu! (pee-reey-dee-tee oo-leet-
soo; Cross the street.)
 Pyeryejditye plosh’ad’! (pee-reey-dee-tee ploh-
sh’uht’; Cross the square.)
 Pyeryejditye chyerez dorogu! (pee-reey-dee-tee
cheh-reez dah-roh-goo; Cross the street/road.)

Chapter 9: I Get Around: Transportation 155
To form the imperative when you’re talking
to somebody with whom you’re on vy (vih;
you [formal singular; plural]) terms, such as
strangers, add –tye as we did in the previous
list. When you’re speaking to somebody
with whom you’re on ty (tih; you [informal
singular]) terms, you can remove the –tye.
For example, to say “Turn left” to a friend,
you say Povyerni nalyevo. (puh-veer-nee
nuh-lye-vuh; Turn left.)
Curiously enough, Russians don’t like to 
indicate directions with the words vostok
(vahs-tohk; east), zapad (zah-puht; west),
syever (sye-veer; north), and yug (yuk; south).
They seem to avoid them when explaining
how you can reach your place of destination.
Phrases like Go south, Turn west, and Drive
south are very rare in direction-giving.

Describing Distances
Sometimes you don’t want detailed information about
directions. You just want to know whether someplace
is near or far and how long it takes to get there. Here
are some helpful phrases:
 Eto dalyeko? (eh-tuh duh-lee-koh?; Is it far
away?)
 Eto dovol’no dalyeko. Dvye ostanovki na 
tramvaye/avtobusye/trolyejbusye/myetro.
(eh-tuh dah-vohl’-nuh duh-lee-koh. dvye 
uhs-tuh-nohf-kee nuh truhm-vahy-ee/uhf-
toh-boo-see/trah-lyey-boo-see/meet-roh;
That’s quite far away. Two stops by the
tram/bus/trolleybus/metro.)
 Eto nedalyeko. Minut pyatnadtsat’ pyeshkom.
(eh-tuh nee-duh-lee-koh. mee-noot peet-naht-suht
peesh-kohm; It’s not far away. About fifteen min-
utes’ walk.)
You may notice that in both the previous
responses, the word minut (minutes) is
placed before the numeral pyatnadtsat’
(fifteen), and you may be wondering
whether it’s an error. Nope, that’s not an
error! Russian has a very special way of 
indicating approximate time, weight, 
distance, or even prices. Where English uses
the word about, Russian may simply use the
method of reversing the order of words, as in
Minut pyatnadtsat’ pyeshkom (mee-noot
peet-naht-suht’ peesh-kohm; About fifteen
minutes’ walk). To be more exact, a Russian
would say Pyatnadtsat’ minut pyeshkom
(peet-naht-suht’ mee-noot peesh-kohm;
Exactly fifteen minutes’ walk).

Hunting for an Apartment 
or a House
Finding an apartment or a house is stressful enough
in English. Are you looking for a good view or a cen-
tral location? What’s more important: a big kitchen or
hardwood floors? And how squeaky are those hard-
wood floors? Equip yourself with phrases introduced
in the following sections, and good luck in your hunt
for a home!

Russian Phrases For Dummies 
158
Talking about an apartment 
or a house
A Russian kvartira (kvuhr-tee-ruh; apartment) is 
generally small. For example, odnokomnatnaya
(uhd-nah-kohm-nuht-nuh-yuh) kvartira literally
means one-room apartment. It has, literally, one room
and a kitchen (which is usually used as a dining room,
no matter how tiny it is). So, a more accurate equiva-
lent for a Russian odnokomnatnaya kvartira is “a
studio apartment.”
If you like to live large, you may want to look
at a dvukhkomnatnaya kvartira (dvookh-
kohm-nuht-nuh-yuh kvuhr-tee-ruh; two-room
apartment) or even a tryokhkomnatnaya
kvartira (tryokh-kohm-nuht-nuh-yuh kvuhr-
tee-ruh; three-room apartment).
Here are some other phrases you use and hear when
talking about an apartment:
 kvartira na pyervom etazhye (kvuhr-tee-
ruh nuh pyer-vuhm eh-tuh-zheh; a first-floor
apartment)
 kvartira na vtorom etazhye (kvuhr-tee-ruh nuh
ftah-rohm eh-tuh-zheh; a second-floor apartment)
 kvartira s myebyel’yu (kvuhr-tee-ruh s m’eh-
bee-l’yu; furnished apartment)
 sdat’ kvartiru (zdaht’ kvuhr-tee-roo; to rent out
an apartment)
 snyat’ kvartiru (sn’aht’ kvuhr-tee-roo; to rent an
apartment)
Although Russians do use the word ryenta
(r’ehn-tuh; rent), it isn’t usually used to talk
about private apartments. To inquire about
the price of an apartment, ask about plata za
kvartiru (plah-tuh zuh kvuhr-tee-roo; pay-
ment for the apartment) or stoimost’
prozhivaniya v myesyats (stoh-ee-muhst’

Chapter 10: Laying Down Your Weary Head 159
pruh-zhih-vah-nee-uh v mye-seets; cost of
living per month). When you make your pay-
ments, use the expression platit’ za kvartiru
(pluh-teet’ zuh kvuhr-tee-roo; pay for the
apartment).
If you’re looking in the newspaper for apartments, look
for the Ob’yavleniya (ahb’-yeev-l’eh-nee-uh; classi-
fieds) section. You have several ways to say “apart-
ments for rent” in Russian. Any of the following is
likely to pop up in the newspaper you’re looking at:
 aryenda kvartir (uh-r’ehn-duh kvuhr-teer; rent
of apartments)
 kvartiry v nayom (kvuhr-tee-rih v nuh-yom;
apartments to rent)
 sdayu (sduh-yoo; I am renting out)
 snyat’ zhil’yo (sn’aht’ zhihl’-yo; to rent a place)
The ads you find are probably saturated with
abbreviations such as kmn for komnata
(kohm-nuh-tuh; room) and m. for metro or
stantsiya myetro (stahn-tsih-yuh meet-roh;
subway station). Because the metro is such a
prominent means of getting around, Russians
use names of metro stations to describe loca-
tion. Thus, if the ad says m. Tverskaya, the
apartment is located next to metro station
Tverskaya — in downtown Moscow!
Your ad may also say nye agenstvo (nee uh-g’ehn-
stvuh; not an agency). What this means is that the ad
was posted by the landlord himself, which allows him
to cut the cost of a rental-agency fee.
The rules for finding a dom (dohm; house) are pretty
much the same as those for finding an apartment.
You can check out newspaper ads about selling 
nyedvizhimost’ (need-vee-zhih-muhst’; real estate)
or talk to an agyent po prodazhye nyedvizhimosti
(uh-g’ehnt puh prah-dah-zhih need-vee-zhih-muhs-tee;
real estate agent).

160
Asking the right questions
Some questions you definitely want to ask
your agyent po s’yomu zhil’ya (uh-g’ehnt
pah s’yo-moo zhih-l’ya; real estate agent) or
khozyain/khozyajka (khah-z’ah-een/khah-
z’ah-koo; landlord/landlady):
 Mnye nuzhno platit’ dyeposit? (mn’eh noozh-
nuh plah-teet’ dee-pah-zeet?; Do I need to pay
the deposit?)
 Kto platit za uslugi — elyektrichyestvo, gaz,
vodu? (ktoh plah-teet zuh oos-loo-gee — 
eh-leek-tree-chees-tvuh, gahs, voh-doo?; Who
pays for utilities — electricity, gas, water?)
 Kakaya oplata v myesyats? (kuh-kah-yuh ahp-
lah-tuh v m’eh-seets?; What are the monthly 
payments?)
 Vy khotitye, chtoby ya platil rublyami ili 
dollarami? (vih khah-tee-tee shtoh-bih ya pluh-
teel roob-l’ah-mee ee-lee doh-luh-ruh-mee?;
Do you want me to pay in rubles or in dollars?)
 Eto spokojnyj rayon? (eh-tuh spah-kohy-nihy
ruh-yon?; Is it a safe neighborhood?)
 Kto zanimayetsya pochinkoj nyeispravnostyej?
(ktoh zuh-nee-mah-ee-tsuh pah-cheen-kuhy 
nee-ees-prahv-nuhs-t’ehy?; Who performs the
maintenance? [literally: Who performs the
repairs of things that are out of order?])
The main things to find out about a house
are the following:
 Eto dom v gorodye ili v prigorodye? (eh-tuh
dohm v goh-ruh-d’eh ee-lee f pree-guh-ruh-d’eh?;
Is the house in the city or in the suburbs?)
 Kakoj vid transporta tuda khodit? (kuh-kohy
veet trahn-spuhr-tuh too-dah khoh-deet?;
Which public transportation runs there?)

Chapter 10: Laying Down Your Weary Head 161
 Skol’ko v domye etazhyej? (skohl’-kuh v doh-

heated?)
 V domye yest’ garazh? (v doh-m’eh yest’ guh-
rahsh?; Is there a garage in the house?)
Sealing the deal
When you find a place to rent that strikes your fancy,
you’re ready to podpisat’ kontrakt (puhd-pee-saht’
kahn-trahkt; sign the lease). In your kontrakt na
aryendu zhil’ya (kahn-trahkt nuh uh-r’ehn-doo zhihl’-
ya; lease), look for the following key points:
 oplata/plata (ah-plah-tuh/plah-tuh; rent)
 podpis’ (poht-pees’; signature)
 srok (srohk; duration of the lease)
Settling Into Your New Digs
Congratulations on moving into your new home! In
the following sections, you discover how to talk about
your home and the things you have there.
Knowing the names of different rooms
Russians don’t usually have as many rooms as
Americans do. And the rooms they have are often
reversible: a divan-krovat’ (dee-vahn krah-vaht’; sofa
bed) can turn a cozy gostinnaya (gahs-tee-nuh-yuh;
living room) into a spal’nya (spahl’-n’uh; bedroom).
In the morning, the same room can magically turn
into a stolovaya (stah-loh-vuh-yuh; dining room)
when the hosts bring in their skladnoj stol (skluhd-
nohy stohl; folding table)!

Russian Phrases For Dummies 
162
Here are some names for rooms to navigate you
through a Russian apartment:
 dyetskaya (d’eht-skuh-yuh; children’s room)
 kabinyet (kuh-bee-n’eht; study)
 koridor (kuh-ree-dohr; corridor)
 kukhnya (kookh-n’uh; kitchen)
 prikhozhaya (pree-khoh-zhuh-yuh; hall)
The English word bathroom corresponds to two differ-
ent notions in Russian: vannaya (vahn-nuh-yuh) and
tualyet (too-uh-l’eht). Vannaya is the place where the
vanna (vahn-nuh; bathtub), dush (doosh; shower),
and rakovina (rah-kuh-vee-nuh; sink) are. The tualyet
is usually a separate room next to the vannaya.
One of the more important phrases in any
language is this one: Gdye tualyet? (gd’eh
too-uh-l’eht?; Where is the bathroom?)
Most Russian room names, such as gostin-
naya and stolovaya, don’t decline like nouns.
Instead, they decline like feminine adjectives.
The explanation to this mystery is easy:
Stolovaya is what remained in modern
Russian of stolovaya komnata (dining room),
where the word stolovaya was, in fact, an
adjective, describing the feminine noun 
komnata (room). (For more info on adjective
declension, see Chapter 2.)
Buying furniture
The easiest place to find myebyel’ (m’eh-beel’; 
furniture) is a myebyel’nij magazin (m’eh-beel’-nihy
muh-guh-zeen; furniture store). Here are some
Russian words for various pieces of furniture:
 divan (dee-vahn; sofa)
 dukhovka (doo-khohf-kuh; oven)
 kholodil’nik (khuh-lah-deel’-neek; refrigerator)

Chapter 10: Laying Down Your Weary Head 163
 knizhnaya polka (kneezh-nuh-yuh pohl-kuh;
bookshelf)
 kovyor (kah-vyor; carpet/rug)
 krovat’ (krah-vaht’; bed)
 kryeslo (kr’ehs-luh; armchair)
 kukhonnyj stol (koo-khuh-nihy stohl; kitchen
table)
 lampa (lahm-puh; lamp)
 magnitofon (muhg-nee-tah-fohn; stereo)
 mikrovolnovka (meek-ruh-vahl-nohf-kuh;
microwave)
 pis’myennyj stol (pees’-mee-nihy stohl;
desk/writing table)
 plita (plee-tah; stove)
 posudomoyechnaya mashina (pah-soo-dah-
moh-eech-nuh-yuh muh-shih-nuh; dishwasher)
 shkaf (shkahf; cupboard/closet/wardrobe)
 stiral’naya mashina (stee-rahl’-nuh-yuh muh-
shih-nuh; washing machine)
 stol (stohl; table)
 stul (stool; chair)
 sushilka (soo-shihl-kuh; dryer)
 zhurnal’nyj stolik (zhoor-nahl’-nihy stoh-leek;
coffee table)
 zyerkalo (z’ehr-kuh-luh; mirror)
Booking the Hotel That’s 
Right for You
Russian today has two words for the English hotel:
 gostinitsa (gahs-tee-nee-tsuh; hotel [literally:
a place for the guests])
 otel’ (ah-tehl’; hotel)

Russian Phrases For Dummies 
164
Although from a linguistic point of view both words
are interchangeable, they’re charged with slightly dif-
ferent meanings. Nobody in Russia uses the word
otel’ (hotel) in reference to a little old shabby hotel.
In this situation, the word gostinitsa (hotel) is more
appropriate. On the other hand, when speaking about
luxurious four- or five-star hotels, Russians use both
words interchangeably.
Making a reservation
To make a reservation, you want to say:
Ya khotyel/khotyela by zabronirovat’ nomyer
(ya khah-t’ehl/khah-t’eh-luh bih zuh-brah-nee-
ruh-vuht’ noh-meer; I would like to make a reser-
vation for a room).
Use khotyel if you’re a man and khotyela if you’re a
woman.
When they talk about hotel rooms, Russians
use the word nomyer, which also means
“number.” In a way it makes sense because
each hotel room has a number!
After you state that you want to make a reservation,
the person you’re talking to will probably ask Na
kakoye chislo? (nuh kuh-koh-ee chees-loh?; For what
date?)
To answer, use this formula: Na (nah; for) +
the ordinal numeral indicating date in
neuter + the name of the month in genitive
case. For example, if you’re planning
to arrive on September 15, you say: 
Na pyatnadtsatoye syentyabrya (nuh 
peet-naht-tsuh-tuh-eh seen-teeb-r’ah;
For September 15).
You may also be asked from what date to what date
you want to stay in the hotel: S kakogo po kakoye

Chapter 10: Laying Down Your Weary Head 165
chislo? (s kuh-koh-vuh puh kuh-koh-eh chees-loh?;
From what date to what date?)
To answer this question, use s (s; from) + the
genitive case of the ordinal number indicating
the date + the genitive case of the word indi-
cating the month + po (poh; until) + the ordi-
nal numeral indicating the date in neuter
gender (and nominative case) + name of the
month in the genitive case. If, for example,
you’re planning to stay in the hotel from June
21 to June 25, you say S dvadtsat’ pyervogo
iyunya po dvadtsat’ pyatoye iyunya (s
dvaht-tsuht’ p’ehr-vuh-vuh ee-yoo-n’uh p’ah
dvaht-tsuht’ p’ah-tuh-eh ee-yoo-n’uh; from
June 21 to June 25).
You also can simply state how many nights you’re
going to stay in the hotel. If you’re checking in on
June 21 at 3 p.m. and leaving on June 25 at 11 a.m.,
you’ll be staying in the hotel chyetyrye nochi
(chee-tih-r’eh noh-chee; four nights).
Here are some other important phrases you may need
to understand:
 Vy khotitye odnomyestnyj nomyer ili
dvukhmyestnyj nomyer? (vih khah-tee-tee 
uhd-nah-m’ehst-nihy ee-lee dvookh-m’ehst-nihy
noh-meer?; Do you want a single or double
accommodation?)
 V nomyere yest’ vannaya, dush, i tualyet? 
(v noh-mee-r’eh yest’ vah-nuh-yuh, doosh, ee
too-uh-lyet?; Is there a bathtub, shower, and
toilet in the room?)
 Skol’ko stoit nomyer? (skohl’-kuh stoh-eet noh-
m’ehr?; How much is the room?)
 Skol’ko stoyat nomyera? (skohl’-kuh stoh-yuht
nuh-mee-rah?; How much are the rooms?)
 Eto vklyuchayet zavtrak? (eh-tuh fklyoo-chah-
eht zahf-truhk?; Does it include breakfast?)

Checking In and Out
Congratulations! You made it to your hotel. To make
your check-in process as smooth as possible, in the
following sections, we tell you what to say when
checking in, how to find your room and what to
expect when you get there, and how to find what
you’re looking for in the hotel. And then we tell you
how to check out.
Enduring the registration process
Look for a sign with the word ryegistratsiya
(ree-gee-strah-tsih-ye; check-in). That’s where
you report your arrival. Simply say U
myenya zabronirovan nomyer (oo mee-nya
zuh-brah-nee-ruh-vuhn noh-meer; I have a
room reserved).
Expect to be asked Kak vasha familiya? (kahk vah-
shuh fuh-mee-lee-ye?; What is your last name?) Keep
your passport ready — you need it for registration.
To ask for your passport, the dezhurnij administrator
(dee-zhoor-nihy ahd-mee-neest-rah-tuhr; receptionist)
says: Vash pasport (vahsh pahs-puhrt; Your passport).
The next step in registration is filling out the 
ryegistratsionnaya kartochka (ree-gee-struh-tsih-
oh-nuh-ye kahr-tuhch-kuh; registration form). You
hear Zapolnitye, pozhalujsta, ryegistratsionnuyu
kartochku. (zuh-pohl-nee-tee, pah-zhahl-stuh, ree-
gee-struh-tsih-ohn-noo-yu kahr-tuhch-koo; Fill out the
registration form, please.) In most cases, this form
requires you to provide the following information:
 Imya (ee-m’uh; first name)
 Familiya (fuh-mee-lee-yuh; last name)
 Adryes (ahd-rees; address)

Chapter 10: Laying Down Your Weary Head 167
 Domashnij/rabochij tyelefon (dah-mahsh-neey/
ruh-boh-cheey tee-lee-fohn; home/work phone
number)
 Srok pryebyvanya v gostinitsye s . . . po . . .
(srohk pree-bih-vah-nee-yuh v gahs-tee-nee-tseh 
s . . . pah . . . ; period of stay in the hotel from . . .
to . . .)
 Nomyer pasporta (noh-meer pahs-puhr-tuh;
passport number)
After you fill out all the forms and give the reception-
ist your passport, you receive the all-important
klyuch ot komnaty (klyuch aht kohm-nuh-tih; key to
your room) and your kartochka gostya (kahr-tuhch-
kuh gohs-t’uh; hotel guest card) or visitka (vee-zeet-
kuh; hotel guest card).
Don’t assume that your room number is
related to the floor number. For example, if the
nomyer komnaty (noh-meer kohm-nuh-tih;
room number) is 235, it doesn’t mean that
the room is on the second floor; it can actu-
ally be on any floor of the hotel. Before you
leave risepshn (ree-sehp-shn; check-in), ask:
Na kakom etazhye moy nomyer? (nuh kuh-
kohm eh-tuh-zheh mohy noh-meer; On what
floor is my room?)
Never leave the hotel without your kartochka
gostya or visitka if you want to be let into
the hotel. In most cases, you need to present
the visitka to the security officer that most
Russian hotels are staffed with today.
Taking a tour of your room
What can you expect to find in your hotel room?
Most likely, you will see the following:
 budil’nik (boo-deel’-neek; alarm clock)
 dvukhspal’naya krovat’ (dvookh-spahl’-nuh-yuh
krah-vaht’; double bed)

Russian Phrases For Dummies 
168
 odnospal’nya krovat’(uhd-nah-spahl’-nuh-yuh
krah-vaht’; twin bed)
 pis’myennyj stol i stul (pees’-mee-nihy stohl ee
stool; desk and a chair)
 shkaf (shkahf; wardrobe)
 torshyer (tahr-shehr; standing lamp)
 tumbochki (toom-buhch-kee; nightstands)
 tyelyefon (tee-lee-fohn; telephone)
 tyelyefonnyj spravochnik (tee-lee-foh-nihy
sprah-vuhch-neek; phone book containing
hotel numbers)
 tyelyevizor (tee-lee-vee-zuhr; TV set)
 vyeshalki (v’eh-shuhl-kee; hangers)
If you have a bathroom in your room, you may find
the following necessities:
 dush (doosh; shower)
 lichnoye polotyentsye (leech-nuh-eh puh-lah-
tyen-tseh; towel)
 unitaz (oo-nee-tahs; toilet)
 vannaya (vah-nuh-yuh; bathtub)
 vannoye polotyentsye (vah-nuh-eh puh-lah-
t’ehn-tseh; bath towel)
Familiarizing yourself with the facilities
To idle away time in the hotel, you may want to
explore. Here’s what you may find:
 bahr (bahr; bar)
 byuro obsluzhivaniya (byu-roh ahp-sloo-zhih-
vuh-nee-yuh; customer service)
 gardyerob (guhr-dee-rohp; cloak room)

Chapter 10: Laying Down Your Weary Head 169
 kamyera khranyeniya (kah-mee-ruh khruh-nye-
nee-yuh; storeroom)
 pochta (pohch-tuh; post office)
 ryestoran (rees-tah-rahn; restaurant)
 suvyenirnyj kiosk (soo-vee-neer-nihy kee-ohsk;
souvenir kiosk)
To inquire where a certain service is, go to the byuro
obsluzhivaniya and say Skazhitye, pozhalujsta, gdye
kamyera khranyeniya/pochta? (skuh-zhih-tee pah-
zhah-luh-stuh gdye kah-mee-ruh khruh-nye-nee-ee/
pohch-tuh?; Could you tell me where the storeroom/
post office is?)
Meeting the staff
People who work in the earlier-mentioned facilities
and other hotel services you want to know include
the following:
 administrator (uhd-mee-nee-strah-tuhr; manager,
person working at the front desk, or concierge)
 gardyerobsh’ik/gardyerobsh’tsa (guhr-dee-
rohp-sh’eek/guhr-dee-rohp-sh’ee-tsuh; a
man/woman working in the cloak room)
 gornichnaya (gohr-neech-nuh-yuh; maid)
 nosil’sh’ik (nah-seel’-sh’eek; porter)
 shvyejtsar (shvehy-tsahr; doorman)
Reporting a broken item
A very common problem is when something in your
room isn’t working. The key refuses to open the door,
the phone is silent when you pick it up, or the shower
pours only cold water on you. You need to speak to a
rabotnik (ruh-boht-neek; employee) in byuro
obsluzhivaniya (byu-roh ahp-sloo-zhih-vuh-nee-ye;
customer service) to get help for these problems.

Russian Phrases For Dummies 
170
To report the problem, use the phrase U
myenya v komnatye nye rabotayet . . . (oo
mee-n’ah f kohm-nuh-tee nee ruh-boh-tuh-eet;
The . . . in my room is not working) + the item
that’s not working. If your telephone is broken,
for instance, you say U myenya v komnatye
nye rabotayet tyelyefon (oo mee-n’ah f
kohm-nuh-t’eh nee ruh-boh-tuh-eet tee-lee-
fohn; The telephone in my room is not work-
ing). You put the word for the broken item
into the nominative case. (For more informa-
tion on cases, see Chapter 2.)
Requesting missing items
The formula you need to know to report that
something is missing is: U myenya v nomyere
nyet (oo-mee-n’ah v noh-mee-r’eh nyet; In my
room I don’t have a) + the word denoting a
missing thing, in the genitive case. (For more
information on forming the genitive case, see
Chapter 2.)
Imagine that you’ve just taken a shower and are now
reaching for the vannoye polotyentsye (vah-nuh-ee
puh-lah-tyen-tseh; bath towel) only to discover you
don’t have one! Shivering from cold and dripping
water from your freshly showered body, you rush to
the phone to call customer service. You say: U myenya
v nomyerye nyet vannogo polotyentsa (oo mee-nya v
noh-mee-ree nyet vah-nuh-vuh puh-lah-tyen-tsuh; I don’t
have a bath towel in my room). Other things that you
may request include
 odyeyalo (ah-dee-ya-luh; blanket)
 podushka (pah-doosh-kuh; pillow)
 tualyetnaya bumaga (too-uh-lyet-nuh-ye boo-
mah-guh; toilet paper)
 vyeshalka (v’eh-shuhl-kuh; hanger)

Chapter 10: Laying Down Your Weary Head 171
Asking to change rooms
To be honest, changing rooms isn’t the easi-
est thing to do in a Russian hotel, but as they
say in Russian: Popytka nye pytka! (pah-
piht-kuh nee piht-kuh; It doesn’t hurt to try!
[literally: An attempt is not a torture!])
You should call customer service and say Ya
khotyel/khotyela by pomyenyat’ nomyer
(ya khah-tyel/khah-tye-luh bih puh-mee-nyat’
noh-meer; I would like to change my room).
You say khotyel if you’re a man and khotyela
if you’re a woman. And you need to give
some convincing reasons for wanting to do
so, such as:
 V komnatye ochyen’ shumno (f kohm-nuh-t’eh
oh-cheen’ shoom-nuh; It is very noisy in my
room).
 V komnatye ochyen’ kholodno/zharko (f kohm-
nuh-tee oh-cheen’ khoh-luhd-nuh/zhahr-kuh; It is
very cold/hot in my room).
 V komnatye nyet svyeta (f kohm-nuh-t’eh n’eht
sv’eh-tuh; There is no light in my room).
Checking out and paying your bill
Your stay has come to an end, and now you have to
pay. Or as Russians like to say: Nastupil chas rasplaty
(nuh-stoo-peel chahs ruhs-plah-tih; It’s time to pay 
[literally: The hour of reckoning has arrived]).
Here are some phrases you’ll need:
 Ya khochu zaplatit’. (ya khah-choo zuh-pluh-
teet’; I want to pay for my stay.)
 Ya vypisyvayus’. (ya vih-pee-sih-vuh-yoos’; I am
checking out.)
 Vy prinimayetye kryeditnyye kartochki?
(vih pree-nee-mah-ee-t’eh kree-deet-nih-ee kahr-
tuhch-kee; Do you accept credit cards?)

Russian Phrases For Dummies 
172
 Kakiye kryeditnyye kartochnki vy prini-
mayetye? (kuh-kee-ee kree-deet-nih-eh kahr-
tuhch-kee vih pree-nee-mah-ee-tee; What credit
cards do you take?)
As in most hotels throughout the world, the
rasschyotnyj chas (ruhs-chyot-nihy chahs;
check-out time) is poldyen’ (pohl-deen’;
noon) or dvyenadtsat’ chasov dnya (dvee-
naht-tsuht’ chuh-sohf dn’ah; 12 p.m.). So
where do you put your luggage if your plane
doesn’t leave until midnight? Most hotels
have a kamyera khranyeniya (kah-mee-ruh
khruh-nye-nee-yuh; storeroom).

Dealing with
Emergencies
In This Chapter
 Knowing how to ask for help
 Getting medical attention
 Dealing with the police
A
n emergency would be called something else
if being fully prepared for it were possible.
However, you can avoid some panic if you know
how to explain yourself in various unpleasant 
situations.
Finding Help in Case 
of Accidents
Dealing with accidents and emergencies in your
native language is enough of a headache; problems
seem twice as bad when you have to speak a
foreign language to resolve them. But if you know
how to ask for help, chances are, you’ll find some-
body who makes resolving your problems much
easier.

Russian Phrases For Dummies 
174
Asking for help
The first thing you need to know is how to ask
for help.
 Izvinitye, mnye nuzhna pomosh’! (eez-vee-nee-
teh mnye noozh-nah poh-muhsh’; Excuse me, I
need help!)
 Pomogitye mn’e, pozhalujsta? (puh-mah-gee-
teh mnye pah-zhah-luh-stuh; Will you please
help me?)
Use one of the following phrases to explain what’s
wrong:
 Ya syebya plokho chuvstvuyu. (ya see-bya ploh-
khuh choos-tvoo-yu; I am not feeling well. [Use if
you have a headache or other mild symptoms.])
 Mnye plokho. (mnye ploh-khuh; I am not feeling
well. [Use if you are very, very sick — for exam-
ple, you have intense pain or nausea, or you feel
as though you may faint.])
 Pozvonitye v skoruyu pomosh’! (puhz-vah-
nee-teh v skoh-roo-yu poh-muhsh’; Call an 
ambulance!)
 Pomogitye! (puh-mah-gee-tee; Help!)
 Pozovitye na pomosh’! (puh-zah-vee-teh nuh
poh-muhsh’; Call for help!)
 Pozvonitye v militsiyu! (puhz-vah-nee-teh v
mee-lee-tsih-yu; Call the police!)
 Dyerzhitye vora! (deer-zhih-teh voh-ruh; Stop
the thief!)
 Pozhar! (pah-zhahr; Fire!)
To get help, you can also say Ya nye mogu . . .
(ya nee mah-goo; I can’t . . .) + the infinitive
of the verb describing what it is you can’t do.
For instance, try the verb najti (nuhy-tee; to
find) or otkryt’ (aht-kriht’; to open), and then
follow with the item you can’t find or open.

Chapter 11: Dealing with Emergencies 175
Calling the right number
In the United States, calling 911 is the answer to
almost any emergency question, but it’s not this way
in Russia. There, you have three different numbers to
call in cases of pozhar (pah-zhahr; fire), crime, or
health problems. The numbers are easy, and any
Russian knows them by heart:
 01 — pozharnaya sluzhba (pah-zhahr-nuh-yuh
sloozh-buh; fire brigade)
 02 — militsiya (mee-lee-tsih-yuh; police)
 03 — skoraya pomosh’ (skoh-ruh-yuh poh-
muhsh’; ambulance [literally: urgent help])
Two other easy numbers to remember:
 04 — avarijnaja gazovaja sluzhba (ah-vah-reey-
nah-yuh gah-zuh-vuh-yuh sloozh-buh; the place
where you call if you suspect gas leakage [liter-
ally: emergency gas service])
 09 — spravochnaya (sprah-vuhch-nuh-yuh;
directory assistance)
Reporting a problem
When reporting an accident or an emergency, a good
verb to use is proiskhodit’ (pruh-ees-khah-deet’; to
happen). To talk about something that is happening or
has happened, you need only the third-person-singular
form in the present tense — proiskhodit (pruh-ees-
khoh-deet; is happening) — and the past-tense forms:
 proizoshyol (pruh-ee-zah-shohl; has happened
[masculine singular])
 proizoshla (pruh-ee-zah-shlah; has happened
[feminine singular])
 proizoshlo (pruh-ee-zah-shloh; has happened
[neuter singular])
 proizoshli (pruh-ee-zah-shlee; has happened
[plural])

Russian Phrases For Dummies 
176
A common question you may be asked if you’ve wit-
nessed an accident is Chto proizoshlo? (shtoh pruh-
ee-zah-shloh; What happened?) You may also hear
Chto sluchilos’? (shtoh sloo-chee-luhs’; What hap-
pened?) The two phrases are interchangeable.
Problems that you may have to report include
 avariya (uh-vah-ree-yuh; car accident)
 infarkt (een-fahrkt; heart attack)
 nyeschastnyj sluchaj (nee-shahs-nihy sloo-
chuhy; accident)
 ograblyeniye (uhg-ruhb-lye-nee-eh; robbery)
 otravlyeniye (uht-ruhv-lye-nee-eh; poisoning)
 pozhar (pah-zhahr; fire)
 ranyeniye (ruh-nye-nee-eh; injury)
Requesting English-speaking help
In case you don’t feel like practicing your Russian in
the midst of an emergency, you may want to ask for
English-speaking help:
 Zdyes’ yest’ kto-nibud’, kto govorit po-anglijski?
(zdyes’ yest’ ktoh- nee-boot’, ktoh guh-vah-reet
puh uhng-leey-skee?; Is there anybody here who
speaks English?)
 Mnye nuzhyen kto-nibud’, kto govorit po-
anglijski! (mnye noo-zhihn ktoh-nee-boot’, 
ktoh guh-vah-reet puh uhng-leey-skee!; I need
somebody who speaks English!)
Receiving Medical Care
To make an appointment with a specific doctor at a
big poliklinika (puh-lee-klee-nee-kuh; clinic), you
need to go to the ryegistratura (ree-gees-truh-too-ruh;
check-in desk) and say Mnye nado zapisat’sya na
priyom k . . . (mnye nah-duh zuh-pee-saht’-suh

Chapter 11: Dealing with Emergencies 177
nuh pree-yom k . . . ; I need to make an appointment
with . . .) + the type of doctor you want to see (in the
dative case). (For more information on case endings,
see Chapter 2.)
Knowing your own anatomy
When you go to a doctor, you want to know how to
talk about your tyelo (tye-luh; body). The following
list starts with the visible parts, going from the
top down:
 golova (guh-lah-vah; head)
 gorlo (gohr-luh; throat)
 grud’ (groot’; chest/breast)
 kolyeno (kah-l’eh-nuh; knee)
 kozha (koh-zhuh; skin)
 lodyzhka (lah-dihsh-kuh; ankle)
 lokot’ (loh-kuht’; elbow)
 noga (nah-gah; leg/foot)
 nogti (nohk-tee; nails)
 palyets (pah-leets; finger)
 plyecho (plee-choh; shoulder)
 polovyye organy (puh-lah-vih-eh ohr-guh-nih;
genitals)
 ruka (roo-kah; arm/hand)
 shyeya (sheh-yuh; neck)
 spina (spee-nah; back)
 zapyast’ye (zuh-pyast’-yeh; wrist)
 zhivot (zhih-voht; stomach)
Russians do not emphasize the distinction
between the arm and the hand; for both
body parts, it is common to use the word
ruka. Similarly, for both leg and foot, you
use the word noga. However, if you want to

Russian Phrases For Dummies 
178
specify the exact part of your ruka or noga,
you can use the word kist’ (keest’; hand),
ladon’ (lah-dohn’; palm), and stupn’a
(stoop-n’ah; foot).
Parts of your head that you may seek treatment for
include the following:
 glaz (glahs; eye)
 litso (lee-tsoh; face)
 nos (nohs; nose)
 podborodok (puhd-bah-roh-duhk; chin)
 rot (roht; mouth)
 ukho (oo-khuh; ear)
 yazyk (yee-zihk; tongue)
 zub (zoop; tooth)
The internal organs you may need to talk about
include these body parts:
 kost’ (kohst’; bone)
 lyogkiye (lyokh-kee-eh; lungs)
 mozg (mohsk; brain)
 muskuly (moos-koo-lih; muscles)
 nyervy (n’er-vih; nerves)
 pochka (pohch-kuh; kidney)
 pyechyen’ (pye-chihn’; liver)
 syerdtsye (syer-tseh; heart)
 zhyeludok (zhih-loo-duhk; stomach)
Describing your symptoms 
to a doctor
The first question you hear from a doctor is usually
Chto u vas bolit? (shtoh u vahs bah-leet?; What is
hurting you?) or Chto vas byespokoit? (shtoh vahs

Chapter 11: Dealing with Emergencies 179
bees-pah-koh-eet?; What brought you here? [literally:
What is bothering you?])
The best way to start describing your symptoms
if you’re in pain is with the verb bolyet (bah-l’eht’;
to hurt):
U myenya bolit . . . (oo mee-nya bah-leet . . . ; . . .
is hurting) + the name of the organ that hurts
(in the nominative case).
You can also point to the place where it hurts and say
U myenya bolit zdyes’ (oo mee-n’ah bah-leet
zdyes’; It hurts me here).
You may want to specify whether it hurts vnutri
(vnoo-tree; inside) or snaruzhi (snah-roo-zhih; on
the outside).
To describe specific, less-painful symptoms, you say
U myenya . . . (oo mee-nya; I have . . .) + one of the
phrases from the following list:
 bol’ (bohl’; pain)
 bolit golova (bah-leet guh-lah-vah; headache)
 bolit gorlo (bah-leet gohr-luh; sore throat)
 bolit ukho (bah-leet oo-khuh; earache)
 bolit zhivot (bah-leet zhih-voht; stomach ache)
 kashyel’ (kah-shihl’; cough)
 nasmork (nahs-muhrk; runny nose)
 ozhog (ah-zhohk; burn)
 ponos (pah-nohs; diarrhea)
 syp’ (sihp’; rash)
 toshnota (tuhsh-nah-tah; nausea)
 tyempyeratura (teem-pee-ruh-too-ruh; fever)
 zapor (zuh-pohr; constipation)

Russian Phrases For Dummies 
180
In Russia, temperature is measured in
Celsius. Normal body temperature is 36.6°C.
Anything above is a vysokaya tyempyer-
atura (vih-soh-kuh-ye teem-pee-ruh-too-ruh;
high fever).
Announcing allergies or 
special conditions
To tell your doctor about any allergies, you can say U
myenya allyergiya na . . . (oo mee-nya uh-leer-gee-ye
nuh . . . ; I am allergic to . . .) + the word naming the
cause of the allergy (in the accusative case). Common
causes of allergies include
 koshki (kohsh-kee; cats)

 ukus pchyely (oo-koos pchee-lih; bee stings)
 yajtsa (yahy-tsuh; eggs)
If you’re on some kind of medication, tell your
doctor Ya prinimayu . . . (ya pree-nee-mah-
yoo . . . ; I am on . . . [literally: I take . . .]) + the
name of the medication. Some other special
conditions that you may need to announce to
the doctor include

Chapter 11: Dealing with Emergencies 181
 U myenya astma. (oo mee-n’ah ahst-muh; I have
asthma.)
 Ya yepilyeptik. (ya ee-pee-l’ehp-teek; I have
epilepsy.)
 Ya diabyetik. (ya dee-uh-beh-teek; I have 
diabetes.)
 Ya byeryemyenna. (ya bee-r’eh-mee-nuh; I am
pregnant.)
Undergoing an examination 
and getting a diagnosis
During a medical exam, you may hear the following
phrases:
 Razdyen’tyes’ do poyasa. (ruhz-dyen’-tees’ duh
poh-ee-suh; Undress from your waist up.)

ahg-rah-muh; electrocardiogram)

Russian Phrases For Dummies

After all the turmoil of going through the osmotr (ahs-
mohtr; medical examination), you’re ready to hear your
diagnoz (dee-ahg-nuhs; diagnosis). The doctor will
probably phrase it this way: U vas . . . (oo vahs . . . ;
you have . . .) + the diagnosis itself. For instance, you
may hear that you have one of the following:
 angina (uhn-gee-nuh; sore throat)
 bronkhit (brahn-kheet; bronchitis)
 gripp (greep; flu)
 infyektsiya (een-fyek-tsih-yuh; infection)
 migryen’ (mee-gr’ehn’; migraine)
 pnyevmoniya (pneev-mah-nee-yuh; pneumonia)
 prostuda (prahs-too-duh; cold)
 rastyazhyeniye svyazok (ruhs-tee-zheh-nee-eh
sv’ah-zuhk; sprain)
 syennaya likhoradka (see-nuh-yuh lee-khah-
raht-kuh; hay fever)
Visiting a pharmacy
In most cases, a doctor will propisat’ lyekarstvo
(pruh-pee-saht’ lee-kahrst-vuh; prescribe a medicine)
for you. The Russian word for prescription is ryet-
syept (ree-tsehpt).
The Russian word ryetsyept is an inter-
preter’s false friend. To an English speaker, it
sounds a lot like receipt. Watch out, though!
The Russian for receipt is chyek (chehk).
Ryetsyept, on the other hand, means 
“prescription” or “recipe.”
To get your lyekarstvo, you need to go to the aptyeka
(uhp-tye-kuh; pharmacy). To get your lyekarstvo, you
hand your ryetsyept to the aptyekar’ (uhp-tye-kuhr’;
pharmacist). Alternately, you can say
 Mnye nuzhyen . . . (mn’eh noo-zhihn . . . ; 
I need . . .) + the masculine name of the 
medicine

Chapter 11: Dealing with Emergencies 183
 Mnye nuzhna . . . (mn’eh noozh-nah . . . ; 
I need . . .) + the feminine name of the medicine
 Mnye nuzhno . . . (mn’eh noozh-nuh . . . ; 
I need . . .) + the neuter name of the medicine
 Mnye nuzhny . . . (mn’eh noozh-nih; I need . . .)
+ the plural name of the medicines
Some common medicines include
 aspirin (uhs-pee-reen; aspirin)
 bolyeutolyayush’yeye (boh-lee-oo-tuh-l’ah-yu-
sh’ee-eh; pain reliever)
 kapli ot kashlya (kahp-lee uht kahsh-l’eh; cough
drops)
 nyejtralizuyush’yeye kislotu sryedstvo (neey-
truh-lee-zoo-yoo-sh’ih-yeh kees-lah-too sryets-
tvuh; antacid)
 sirop ot kashlya (see-rohp uht kahsh-lyuh;
cough syrup)
 sryedstvo dlya snizhyeniya tyempyeratury
(sryets-tvuh dlya snee-zheh-nee-uh teem-pee-
ruh-too-rih; fever reducer)
 sryedstvo ot izzhyogi (sryets-tvuh uht eez-zhoh-
gee; heartburn reliever)
Calling the Police When You’re
the Victim of a Crime
If you’re the victim of crime, you need to know where
to turn to for help and what to say to the people help-
ing you.
To find the nearest police station, you can ask a
passerby Gdye blizhajshyeye otdyelyeniye militsii?
(gdye blee-zhahy-shih-ee uht-dee-lye-nee-ye mee-lee-
tsih-ee?; Where is the nearest police station?)

Russian Phrases For Dummies 
184
Here are some useful phrases you can use
to describe different types of crime to the
police:
 Myenya ograbili. (mee-n’ah ah-grah-bee-lee; 
I was robbed.)
 Myenya obokrali. (mee-n’ah uh-bah-krah-lee; I
became a victim of a theft.)
 Na myenya bylo sovyershyeno napadyeniye.
(nuh mee-n’ah bih-luh suh-veer-shih-noh nuh-
puh-d’eh-nee-eh; I was attacked.)
 Moyu kvartiru obvorovali. (mah-yoo kvahr-tee-
roo uhb-vuh-rah-vah-lee; My apartment was
broken into.)
 Ya stal zhyertvoj moshyennichyestva. (ya stahl
zhehr-tvohy muh-sheh-nee-cheest-vuh; I became
a victim of a fraud [masculine].)
 Ya stala zhyertvoj moschyennichyestva. (ya
stah-lah zhehr-tvuhy muh-sheh-nee-chihst-vuh;
I became a victim of a fraud [feminine].)
 Moyu mashinu obokrali. (mah-yu muh-shih-
noo uh-bahk-rah-lee; My car was broken into.
[literally: My car was robbed.])

Ten Favorite Russian
Expressions
E
very culture has a way of taking familiar words
and turning them into something else.
Recognizing these expressions in speech and using
them with ease can make you sound really Russian!
Oj!
To express surprise, dismay, admiration, gratitude,
or even pain — pretty much any strong feeling —
Russians say Oj! (ohy). Use oj when in English you
would say “oops,” “ouch,” or “wow,” or make a facial
expression. You can confidently use oj in any of the
following sentences:
 Oj, kak krasivo! (ohy kahk kruh-see-vuh;
Wow, how beautiful!)
 Oj, spasibo! (ohy spuh-see-buh; Thank you
so much!)
 Oj, kto eto? (ohy ktoh eh-tuh; Who in the world
is this?)
Davaj
If you look up davaj (duh-vahy) in the dictionary, it
means “give.” Russians, however, use the word in all
kinds of situations. It’s a popular way to suggest doing
something, as in Davaj pojdyom v kino (duh-vahy

Russian Phrases For Dummies 
186
pahy-d’ohm v kee-noh; Let’s go to the movies), and
to answer “Sure, let’s do it!” (Davaj!) Used by itself,
davaj means “Bye, take care.”
Pryedstav’tye Syebye
Although the verb pryedstav’tye can mean “imagine,”
“picture,” or even “introduce,” pryedstav’tye syebye
(preed-stahf’-te’h see-b’eh) means “Can you believe
it?” or “Imagine that!” It’s a good way to begin telling a
story, or to open a conversation on a subject you feel
strongly about.
Poslushajtye!
The literal translation of Poslushajtye! (pahs-loo-
shuhy-te’h) is “Listen!” Although this sounds pushy
and aggressive in English, in Russian, poslushajtye is
a nice way to attract attention to your arguments.
Here are some examples:
 Poslushajtye, davajtye pojdyom na progulku!
(pahs-loo-shuhy-t’eh, duh-vahy-t’eh pahy-d’ohm
nuh prah-gool-koo; You know what? Let’s go for
a walk! [literally: Listen, let’s go for a walk!])
 Poslushajtye, no eto zhe pryekrasnyj fil’m!
(pahs-loo-shuhy-t’eh, noh eh-tuh zheh preek-
rahs-nihy feel’m; But it’s a wonderful movie! 
[literally: Listen, but it’s a wonderful movie!])
A less formal variant of the same expression
is Poslushaj! (pahs-loo-shuhy). You can use it
with someone you’re on familiar terms with.
Pir Goroj
You may be at a loss to describe the grand abundance
of Russian dinner parties and holiday tables. This
expression, then, is useful: pir goroj (peer gah-rohy;
literally: feast with food piled up like a mountain).

Chapter 12: Ten Favorite Russian Expressions 187
Ya Tryebuyu Prodolzhyeniya
Bankyeta
This phrase is a quote from one of the Russians’ most
beloved comedies, Ivan Vasil’yevich myenyayet 
profyessiyu (ee-vahn vah-seel’-ye-veech mee-n’ah-
eht prah-f’eh-see-yoo; Ivan Vasil’yevich Changes His
Occupation), and is sure to make any Russian smile.
Say Ya tryebuyu prodolzhyeniya bankyeta! (ya tr’eh-
boo-yu pruh-dahl-zheh-nee-uh buhn-k’eh-tuh; literally:
I insist on the continuation of the banquet!) when a
party or a trip is going well, when somebody is inviting
you to come over again, or when you’re suggesting to
do some fun activity yet another time.
Slovo — Syeryebro, A
Molchaniye — Zoloto
Russians love proverbs and use them a lot. Slovo —
syeryebro, a molchaniye — zoloto (sloh-vuh see-
reeb-roh uh mahl-chah-nee-eh zoh-luh-tuh; A word is
silver, but silence is gold) can be loosely translated as
“Speaking is nice, but silence is supreme.” This phrase
is nice to say after you make a mistake speaking
Russian or when you, or somebody else, says 
something that would be better off left unsaid.
Odna Golova Khorosho, 
A Dvye — Luchshye
Odna golova khorosho, a dvye — luchshye (ahd-nah
guh-lah-vah khuh-rah-shoh ah dv’eh looch-sheh; One
head is good, but two heads are better) doesn’t refer
to science-fiction mutants. Rather, it’s a manifestation
of the international belief that two heads are better
than one. You can say this phrase when you invite
somebody to do something together or when you ask
for, or offer, help or advice.

Russian Phrases For Dummies 
188
Drug Poznayotsya V Byedye
Drug poznayotsya v byedye (drook puhz-nuh-yot-suh
v bee-d’eh; A friend is tested by hardship) is the
Russian equivalent of the saying, “A friend in need 
is a friend indeed.”
Russians take friendship seriously. Their def-
inition of a friend is not just a person you
know (as in, “This is my new friend . . .
what’s your name again?”). Such a person
would be called a znakomyj (znuh-koh-mihy;
acquaintance). A drug (drook; friend), on the
other hand, is someone who cares for you.
Staryj Drug Luchshye 
Novykh Dvukh
Staryj drug luchshye novykh dvukh (stah-rihy drook
looch-sheh noh-vihkh dvookh; An old friend is better
than two new ones) is another speculation on the
theme of friendship. An old friend (and they aren’t
referring to age) is better because he or she has
already been tested, possibly by hardships mentioned
in the previous phrase. New friends, on the other
hand, are dark horses; when a bad moment strikes,
they may turn out to be just acquaintances.

Chapter 13
Ten Phrases That Make
You Sound Russian
S
ome phrases aren’t really important in a conver-
sation, but they make you sound Russian.
Tol’ko Poslye Vas!
Oh, dear Old World! Russians still believe in opening
doors for each other and letting others go first. If you
want to be especially polite, absolutely refuse to go
through a door if somebody else is aiming for it. Instead
of just walking through and getting it over with, stand
by the door for 15 minutes repeating Tol’ko poslye
vas! (tohl’-kuh pohs-lee vahs; Only after you!) while
your counterpart stands by the other side of the door
repeating the same phrase. It may be time consuming,
but you’ll be recognized as a well-bred individual.
Vy Syegodnya Pryekrasno
Vyglyaditye!
Speaking of being old-fashioned: Russians, for some
reason, don’t believe that giving compliments is con-
sidered sexual harassment. So, if you start a conver-
sation with a Russian woman by saying Vy syegodnya
pryekrasno vyglyaditye! (vih see-vohd-n’uh pree-
krahs-nuh vihg-lee-dee-t’eh; You look great today!),
she may actually treat you nicer instead of reporting
you to the authorities.

Russian Phrases For Dummies 
190
If someone says Vy syegodnya pryekrasno vyglyadi-
tye! to you, remember that the appropriate response
isn’t spasibo (spuh-see-buh; thank you); you should
say Nu, chto vy! (noo shtoh vih; Ah, what are you
talking about!) You have to show your modesty and
disagree.
Zakhoditye Na Chaj!
Making a Russian friend is very easy. When you meet
someone (and if you like this person enough to want
to be his or her friend), don’t think too hard about
finding a way to create a social connection. Just say
Zakhoditye na chaj! (zuh-khah-dee-t’eh nuh chahy;
Stop by for some tea!) The person won’t think you’re
a freak or a serial killer; he or she will most likely take
your offer at face value. Keep in mind, though, that
unlike “Let’s do lunch,” Russians take Zakhoditye na
chaj seriously and usually accept your offer. That
being said, you should actually have some tea and
cookies at home, because Zakhoditye na chaj!
implies drinking tea and conversing, unlike the
American version: “Would you like to stop by my
place for a drink?”
Ugosh’ajtyes’!
When you invite a new friend over for tea and whip
out your strategically prepared box of cookies, a nice
thing to say is Ugosh’ajtyes! (oo-gah-sh’ahy-t’ehs’;
Help yourself! [literally: Treat yourself!]) Besides
being friendly and polite, this word is just long
enough to scare off foreigners. Which is, of course,
a good enough reason to learn it and stand out in
the crowd.

Chapter 13: Phrases That Make You Sound Russian 191
Priyatnogo Appetita!
Unless you want to strike people as a gloomy, misan-
thropic sociopath, don’t start eating without wishing
others Priyatnogo appetita! (pree-yat-nuh-vuh uh-
pee-tee-tuh; Bon appétit!) Don’t hesitate to say this
phrase to people you don’t know and are seeing for
the first time in your life after your waiter sits them
down at your table in an over-crowded restaurant.
Syadyem Na Dorozhku!
Before departing on a trip, surprise everybody by
looking around thoughtfully and saying Syadyem na
dorozhku! (sya-deem nuh dah-rohsh-koo; Let’s sit
down before hitting the road!) Essentially a supersti-
tion, this tradition is actually useful; sitting down and
staying silent for a minute before you head out the
door gives you an opportunity to remember what’s
important. Maybe your packed lunch is still in the
fridge, and your plane tickets with a sticker saying
“Don’t forget!” are still on your bedside table!
Sadis’, V Nogakh Pravdy Nyet
Sitting down is a big deal for Russians. Which is, of
course, understandable: With those vast lands, they
must have had to walk a lot (especially before the
invention of trains). That’s why when you’re sitting
with somebody standing before you, or when some-
body stops by and hangs out in the doorway, claiming
to be leaving in a minute, you can say Sadis’, v nogakh
pravdy nyet (sah-dees’, v nah-gahkh prahv-dih n’eht;
take the weight off your feet/it is as cheap sitting as
standing).

Russian Phrases For Dummies 
192
Ni Pukha, Ni Pyera!
Although English has its own cute little “Break a leg”
phrase, nobody really uses it anymore. Russians, on
the other hand, never let anyone depart on a mission —
whether a lady leaves to interview for a job or guy
goes to ask a girl out — without saying Ni pukha, ni
pyera! (nee poo-khuh nee pee-rah; Good luck! [literally:
Have neither fluff nor plume!])
The appropriate response isn’t spasibo (spuh-see-buh;
thank you); you should say K chyortu! (k chohr-too;
To the devil!)
Tseluyu
Russians sign their letters, e-mails, and cell phone
text messages with Tseluyu (tsih-loo-yu; kisses [liter-
ally: (I am) kissing (you)]). You can also say Tseluyu
at the end of a phone conversation. We don’t recom-
mend saying it in person, though: If you’re face to face
with someone, you may as well kiss the person
instead of talking about it!
S Lyogkim Parom!
Here’s a weird one: When Russians see someone who
just came out of a shower, a sauna, or any place
where you can, supposedly, clean yourself, they say 
S lyogkim parom! (s lyokh-keem pah-ruhm; literally:
Congratulations on a light steam!)
You can use S lyogkim parom! humorously: Say it to
someone who got caught in the rain or someone who
spilled a drink. Yes, it sounds mean, but Russians
have a dark sense of humor.
