ETHICAL IMPLICATIONS AND
RESPONSIBLE AI USAGE IN HACKING
Hacking serves both legitimate and malicious
purposes. Understanding this duality is essential
in the cybersecurity landscape.
Ethical considerations, such as data privacy,
transparency, and accountability, should guide
all actions and decisions in cybersecurity.
AI should complement human judgment, not
replace it. Human oversight is necessary to
prevent errors, false positives, and unintended
consequences when applying AI in ethical
hacking.
