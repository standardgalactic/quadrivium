Excel 2007 For Dummies Quick Reference

Getting to Know
Excel 2007
With Microsoft’s popular Excel 2007 spreadsheet program, you can enter, manip-
ulate, and analyze data in ways that would be impossible, cumbersome, or error
prone for you to do manually. This part gives you the basics you need to get up
and running quickly in Excel.
In this part . . .

Part 1

Excel Basics
Excel documents are known as workbooks. A single workbook can store as many
sheets as will fit into memory, and these sheets are stacked like the pages in a
notebook. Sheets can be either worksheets (a normal spreadsheet-type sheet with
rows and columns) or chart sheets (a special sheet that holds a single chart).
Most of the time, you perform tasks in worksheets. In older versions of Excel
(well, except for really old versions), each worksheet used a grid with 65,536
rows and 256 columns. Excel numbers rows starting with 1 and assigns letters to
columns starting with A. After Excel exhausts the letters of the alphabet, column
lettering continues with AA, AB, and so on. So column 1 is A, column 26 is Z,
column 27 is AA, column 52 is AZ, column 53 is BA, and so on. Prior to Excel
2007, row numbers ranged from 1 to 65,536 and column labels ranged from A
(column 1) to IV (column 256).
Excel 2007 increases the number of rows and columns in a single worksheet sig-
nificantly. A worksheet now has 1,048,576 rows (no, that’s not a typo) and 16,384
columns (no, that’s not a typo either). Rows are numbered from 1 to 1048576
and columns are labeled from A to XFD.
The intersection of a row and a column is called a cell. A quick calculation using
Excel tells me that this works out to 17,179,869,184 cells — more than enough
for just about any use. Cells have addresses, which are based on their row and
column. The upper-left cell in a worksheet is called A1, and the cell down at
the bottom right is called XFD1048576. Cell K9 (also known as the dog cell) is the
intersection of the eleventh column and the ninth row.
You might be wondering about the amount of system memory (known as random
access memory, or RAM) you need to accommodate all those rows and columns.
The actual memory you need depends on the amount of data you store in the
workbook and the number of open workbooks. The good news is that Excel 2007
allows you to work with more memory than previous versions. Excel 2003, for
example, will utilize up to only 1 GB (gigabyte) of memory, even if your system has
more memory available. In Excel 2007, the memory available is limited by the max-
imum amount of memory that your version of Windows (XP or Vista) can use.
Formulas
A cell in Excel can hold a number, some text, a formula, or nothing at all. You
already know what numbers and text are, but you may be a bit fuzzy on the con-
cept of a formula. A formula tells Excel to perform a calculation using informa-
tion stored in other cells. For example, you can insert a formula that tells Excel
to add the values in the first 10 cells in column A and to display the result in the
cell that contains the formula.
2
Part 1: Getting to Know Excel 2007

Formulas can use normal arithmetic operators such as + (plus), — (minus),
* (multiply), and / (divide). They can also use special built-in functions that
let you do powerful things without much effort on your part. For example,
Excel has functions that add a range of values, calculate square roots, compute
loan payments, and even tell you the time of day. Part 5 covers how to use the
various functions in Excel.
Active cell and ranges
In Excel, one of the cells in a worksheet is always the active cell. The active cell
is the one that’s selected, and it’s displayed with a thicker border than the
others. Its contents appear in the formula bar. You can select a group, or range,
of cells by clicking and dragging the mouse pointer over them. You can then
issue a command that does something to the active cell or to the range.
The selected range is usually a group of contiguous cells, but it doesn’t have to
be. To select a noncontiguous group of cells, select the first cell or group of
cells, hold down the Ctrl key while you drag the mouse, and select the next cell
or group of cells.
Familiarizing Yourself with the Excel 2007 Window
Figure 1-1 shows a typical Excel 2007 window, with the important parts labeled.
This terminology rears its ugly head throughout the book, so look at the figure
carefully.
Moving, resizing, and closing windows
When Excel and workbook windows are in a restored state (between a maximized
and minimized state, that is) you can use the resize handles to adjust the window
size to your liking. Move the mouse pointer to the area of the resize handle until
the pointer changes to a double-headed arrow, and then drag with the mouse.
You can move the window around the screen by dragging the title bars. See also
“Using the Mouse and Keyboard,” later in this part.
When the active workbook window is maximized, it shares a single Close button
with the Excel window. After you click the shared Close button, Excel closes the
active workbook.
Exiting Excel
Use any one of the following methods to close the Excel application:
 Click the Close button on the Excel title bar if one or no workbook is open.
 Click the Office button and then click the Exit Excel button.

Navigating with the Mouse and Keyboard
The mouse is the primary tool that you use in Excel for executing commands,
making selections, and navigating in the worksheet. Following are the mouse
conventions that we use in this book:
 Click: Click the left mouse button once.
 Double-click: Click the left mouse button twice in quick succession. It may
take you some time to get the hang of this action.
 Right-click: Click the right mouse button once.
 Drag: Hold down the left mouse button and move the mouse. Release the
mouse button to complete the drag operation.
 Hover: Place the mouse pointer over an element without clicking a mouse
button.
 Select: Place the mouse pointer over an element and click the left mouse
button.
Mousing around
Every mouse action is associated with some element in the Excel window. An
element can be a slider, button, cell, chart object, and so on. You select or hover
over the element using the mouse pointer.
Navigating through a worksheet with a mouse works just as you’d expect. Just
click a cell, and it becomes the active cell. If the cell that you want to activate
isn’t visible in the workbook window, you can use the scroll bars to scroll the
window in any direction, as follows:
 To scroll one cell, click one of the arrows on the scroll bar.
 To scroll by a complete screen, click either side of the scroll bar’s slider
button (the large center button).
 To scroll faster, drag the slider.
 To scroll a long distance vertically, press and hold the Shift key while drag-
ging the slider button.
Note that only the active workbook window displays scroll bars. If you activate a
different window, its scroll bars appear.
After you right-click a cell, a range of cells, or another object in the worksheet
area, Excel displays a contextual menu, so-called because the menu includes
commands specific to working with the cell, range, or object.
Familiarizing Yourself with the Excel 2007 Window — Navigating with the Mouse and Keyboard 5

For your convenience, Excel 2007 adds a mini-toolbar above the contextual
menu with useful commands drawn from the Ribbon, as shown in Figure 1-2. See
also “Introducing the Ribbon,” later in this part.
Using the keyboard
Most users will be comfortable using the mouse to do all their work in Excel. For
users who prefer to use the keyboard exclusively when working in Windows
applications or for users who prefer to split the use of the mouse and keyboard
among various tasks, Excel provides the following solutions.
 Keyboard shortcuts
 Keyboard navigation
 KeyTips
The first two functions are described next. For more on the last function,
KeyTips, see “Tipping off your keyboard,” later in this part.
You can access commands in Excel using keyboard shortcuts, which are individ-
ual keystrokes or a combination of keys pressed simultaneously. To access the
Print command using a shortcut, for example, you press and hold down the Ctrl
key and press the P key, represented in this book as Ctrl+P. The following table
lists some common keyboard shortcuts in Excel.

Introducing the Ribbon
Excel 2007 comes with a new user interface that replaces the standard menus
and toolbars found at the top of the window in previous versions of Excel. The
new interface is called the Ribbon and consists of a series of tabs, each contain-
ing a variety of commands grouped according to function (see Figure 1-3).
Virtually all the features in Excel 2007 are available through the commands in
the Ribbon tabs. This arrangement allows you to discover features in the pro-
gram far more easily than if you had to drill down several layers into menus.
Dissecting the parts of the Ribbon
The commands in the Ribbon are accessed through a variety of controls. Here’s a
list of the various types of controls and other parts that make up the Ribbon:
 Button: This is the most common type of control. Most buttons in the
Ribbon (except the formatting ones) have descriptive text associated with
them, so you don’t need to be a Mensa expert to figure out what a button
represents. The most frequently used commands in each Ribbon tab have
larger buttons.
Contextual tab header
Home tab
Split button
Dialog launcher
Contextual tabs
Figure 1-3
8
Part 1: Getting to Know Excel 2007

Most buttons execute commands directly when you click them. However,
some buttons have a built-in downward-pointing arrow, and others have an
attached downward-pointing arrow. Clicking a button with a built-in arrow
displays a menu or gallery. For a button with an attached arrow (known as
a split button), the icon part of the button represents the most common
command for the button. Clicking the arrow part displays a menu with
additional command choices. The two types of buttons with arrows look
similar but if you hover the mouse pointer over a button with an attached
arrow, you see a clear delineation between the icon (command) part and
the arrow (menu) part (see Figure 1-3).
 Check box: A square box that you click to turn an option on or off.
 Command group: Each Ribbon tab contains groups of related commands.
For example, you find commands related to text fonts in the Fonts group of
the Home tab.
 Dialog launcher: A command that launches a dialog box (a pop-up window)
from within a command group, menu, or gallery. The dialog launcher in a
command group is a little button in the bottom right of the group. In addi-
tion, some menus and galleries contain options that launch dialog boxes.
After you click a dialog launcher, a dialog box appears that presents addi-
tional choices. (However, the Ribbon displays the commands you are likely
to use frequently, thus minimizing the need to launch dialog boxes.)
 Drop-down list: A list of things you can choose from. Click the control’s
downward-pointing arrow to display the list.
 Gallery: A gallery is a new control in Excel 2007 that presents you with a
set of graphic choices, such as a particular formatting style (patterns,
colors, and effects) or a predefined layout. An example of a predefined
layout is a chart choice with specific elements preselected for inclusion in
the chart. Galleries enable Excel to be more results oriented; that is, they
present the likely result you are looking for first and then expose advanced
choices through a dialog box or Ribbon command.
Three types of galleries are available:
• Drop-down gallery: This is displayed after you click a button with a
downward-pointing arrow. This type of gallery presents a single
column of choices and includes both graphic and text elements.
• Drop-down grid: This is displayed after you click a button with a
downward-pointing arrow. This type of gallery presents a two-
dimensional grid of choices and does not include text.
• In-Ribbon gallery: Like the drop-down grid, but this gallery exposes
a single row of choices directly within a Ribbon control group. You
can click up and down scroll arrows to reveal additional rows, or
you can click a drop-down arrow to display the full set of choices in
a two-dimensional grid.
Navigating with the Mouse and Keyboard — Introducing the Ribbon 9

 Help button: On the far right of the Ribbon is the help button (the question
mark). Click this button for general Excel help.
 Menu, rich: Rich menus are new in Excel 2007. Each menu choice has an
illustrative graphic, the command name, and in some cases a short
description of what the command does.
Don’t confuse rich menus with drop-down galleries, although they look
similar. Menus contain related commands. Galleries allow you to choose
from among a set of formats or layouts.
 Menu, standard: Most users are already familiar with this form of menu —
a drop-down list of choices with command names (such as Paste or Insert
Cells). Some command names have small associated icons. If you click a
command name that ends with an ellipsis (...), Excel displays a dialog box
that presents further choices.
 Spinner: A control with two arrows (one pointing up, the other pointing
down) used with an input box to specify a number (height or width, for
example.) Clicking an arrow increases or decreases the number in the
input box. You can also enter a number in the box directly. The spinner
control allows you to use only valid numbers.
 Tab, contextual: Contextual tabs give the Ribbon the power to expose all
features in Excel. One or more contextual tabs appear after you insert or
select an object, such as a chart, shape, table, or picture. For example,
after you insert a chart, three contextual tabs related to chart functionality
appear on the Ribbon and a header labeled Chart Tools appears on the
Excel title bar above the contextual tabs. Contextual tabs contain all the
commands you need for working with the particular object. After you 
deselect an object, the contextual tabs (and the header) disappear.
The general rules that govern the display of contextual tabs follow:
• After you select an object (such as a chart, shape, or table), one or
more contextual tabs for the object appear on the Ribbon. You must
select a tab to display the associated commands.
• After you insert an object, Excel displays the commands for the first
tab of the contextual tab set for that object.
• After you double-click an object, Excel displays the commands for the
first tab of the contextual tab set for that object. Note that not all
objects have this double-click capability.
• After you select, deselect, and then reselect the object without using
any other commands in-between, Excel displays the commands for the
first tab of the contextual tab set for that object.
10
Part 1: Getting to Know Excel 2007

 Tab, standard: The Ribbon comes with a set of standard tabs, each
organized according to the functions of the commands that it contains.
For example, the Insert tab contains command groups to insert shapes,
charts, tables, pictures, and so on. An exception is the Home tab, which
is so-named because this is where you do most of your work in Excel.
If your mouse has a scroll wheel, you can navigate quickly among the
Ribbon tabs by hovering the mouse pointer over the Ribbon area and
scrolling the wheel back and forth.
 Text box: A box in which you enter a number or text. In general, the Ribbon
associates a text box with another control, such as a spinner or a drop-
down box.
Sizing up the Ribbon
The layout of the Ribbon controls is not static. Depending on your screen resolu-
tion, or the Excel window size, or both, the Ribbon provides one of four layout
options for command groups. If sufficient space is available, the Ribbon presents
a layout that labels commands, displays more commands individually, and elimi-
nates extra clicks. As you resize the Ribbon downwards (by reducing the screen
resolution or shrinking the size of the Excel window), the Ribbon rearranges the
layout of some of the command groups by first resizing command buttons (larger
buttons become smaller), then removing labels from commands, and finally reduc-
ing the groups to single large buttons (see Figure 1-4). To access the commands in
a command group that the Ribbon resizes to a single button, you must first click
the button to display a flyout menu and then select the command.
It is important to note that at each stage of downward resizing, no command
groups or commands disappear entirely from the Ribbon. The multiple layout
options for the command groups ensure that nothing is lost as space becomes
more limited. If you reduce the size of the Excel window sufficiently, however,
the Ribbon disappears altogether.
Figure 1-4
Introducing the Ribbon
11

Tipping off your keyboard
Excel provides a feature called KeyTips that allow you to access every command
on the Ribbon using the keyboard, without having to memorize keystroke com-
binations! So, what are KeyTips? KeyTips are little alphanumerical indicators
containing a single letter, a combination of two letters, or a number, indicating
what to type to activate the command under them, as shown in Figure 1-5.
Follow these steps to access a command in a Ribbon tab using a KeyTip:
1. Press the Alt key. The KeyTips appear over the Ribbon tabs (Ignore the
KeyTips that appear in the other areas of the interface for this exercise.)
2. Press the key that represents the KeyTip for the Ribbon tab you want to
access. For example, press N to select the Insert tab. Note that you do not
have to hold down the Alt key. If you need to select a different tab after
you select the KeyTip for a tab, press the Esc key.
3. Press the key or key combination that represents the KeyTip for the com-
mand you want to use.
If the command you select is a drop-down gallery or drop-down grid, you can
use an arrow key or the Tab key to highlight your choice and then press the
Enter key to select your choice.
Remember: KeyTips are associated with in-Ribbon galleries, so you have to press
the key that represents the KeyTip for the gallery before you can choose an
option in the gallery.
Remember: If the command you want to use requires a number key, you must use
the number keys on the main keyboard. The KeyTip feature does not work with
the numeric keypad.
Hiding the Ribbon commands
If you find that the Ribbon commands take up too much of your screen area, you
can hide them using any of the following methods:
 Press Ctrl+F1
 Double-click any Ribbon tab
Figure 1-5
12
Part 1: Getting to Know Excel 2007

 Right-click in the Ribbon area and choose Minimize the Ribbon from the
contextual menu
 Click the arrow to the right of the Quick Access toolbar and choose
Minimize the Ribbon from the menu
If you click a tab after you hide the Ribbon commands, Excel displays the tab
commands temporarily. The command display is hidden again after you select a
command in the tab or click away from the Ribbon area. Similarly, you can use
KeyTips to select a command when the command display is hidden.
To redisplay the commands permanently after you hide them, use the same
methods described for hiding the commands.
Remember: Excel maintains the hidden condition of the Ribbon commands if you
exit and subsequently re-launch Excel.
Introducing the Quick Access Toolbar
The Quick Access toolbar is an area of the new user interface that provides
quick access to commands. The toolbar is designed to reduce the amount of
navigation you have to do in the Ribbon to access the features that you use fre-
quently. The Quick Access toolbar is on the left side of the screen, above the
Ribbon and to the right of the Office button (see Figure 1-6).
The Quick Access toolbar is the only area of the new user interface that you can
customize by adding commands to the three default commands (Save, Undo,
and Redo).
Follow these steps to add a command to the toolbar:
1. Select the Ribbon tab that houses the command you want to add.
2. Right-click the command and choose Add to Quick Access Toolbar in the
menu that appears.
To quickly add some common commands to the Quick Access toolbar,
click the arrow to the right of the toolbar and choose a command from
the menu.
You can add an entire command group to the Quick Access toolbar. Just right-
click an area in the command group name (for example, Font) and choose Add
to Quick Access Toolbar.
Figure 1-6
Introducing the Ribbon — Introducing the Quick Access Toolbar 13

Follow these steps to remove a command (including the default commands)
from the toolbar:
1. Right-click the command you want to remove from the toolbar.
2. Choose Remove from Quick Access Toolbar in the menu that appears.
If you think you’ll be adding a lot of commands to the Quick Access toolbar, it’s a
good idea to move the toolbar from the title bar to a separate location below the
Ribbon. Right-click anywhere on the toolbar and choose Place Quick Access
Toolbar below the Ribbon in the menu that appears. You can regain screen area
for working in the worksheet by double-clicking a Ribbon tab (or pressing
Ctrl+F1) to hide the Ribbon controls temporarily.
You can access commands on the Quick Access toolbar using the keyboard. Press
the Alt key and then a number key that represents the KeyTip for the command
you want to access. See also “Tipping off your keyboard,” earlier in this part.
Introducing the Office Menu
Excel 2007 introduces a new menu for working with documents and accessing
special Excel options. The menu is accessed by clicking the Office button (the
large round button with the Office logo), located at the top-left corner of the
Excel screen. See Figure 1-7.
Figure 1-7
14
Part 1: Getting to Know Excel 2007

The menu is divided into two sections. The left section contains a list of document-
related commands. By default, the right section displays a list of recently used
documents. Click a document name in the list to open the file. Click a pushpin
to the right of a document name to keep the document on the list permanently.
By default, Excel lists 17 documents, which get overridden with new documents
unless you use the pushpin control. Some file commands on the left section
include a built-in or attached arrow. If you hover the mouse pointer over a com-
mand with an attached arrow, you will see a clear demarcation between the
button and the arrow. Clicking a button with a built-in arrow or the arrow por-
tion of a button with an attached arrow displays additional choices in the right
section of the menu.
The Office menu also includes a button to access various Excel options and a
button to exit Excel. We encourage you to visit the options from time to time,
because you may find useful application, workbook, or worksheet options that
you want to turn on or off. An option in the Advanced section of the Excel
Options dialog box, for example, allows you to increase the number of docu-
ments displayed in the Recent Documents list to a maximum of 50.
Previewing Your Formatting Live
New in Excel 2007 is a Live Preview feature. When you hover over a formatting
option with the mouse pointer, Excel lets you see the effect that the formatting
option will have on your selection before you commit to applying the option.
Your selection might be a cell, range of cells, chart, table, shape, and more.
Suppose that you want to change the font of some text in a cell. In the Ribbon, a
drop-down box called the font picker presents a list of available fonts. As you
hover over each choice in the font picker, your cell updates to show you what
the text would look like if you chose that font. Live Preview avoids the normal
tedium of committing to an option, then undoing the option because the result
is not what you wanted, and then committing to another option, only to realize
that you don’t like the new result either, and so on.
You will find Live Preview options throughout Excel in places where formatting
alternatives are available — most notably in galleries.
Formatting with Themes
In Excel 2007, you can now use a formatting concept known as a theme. A theme
consists of a combination of fonts, colors, and effects that provide a consistent
look among your workbook’s elements, including cells, charts, tables, and
PivotTables. You apply the theme’s fonts, colors, and effects through individual
options or the style galleries of the various elements.
Introducing the Quick Access Toolbar — Formatting with Themes 15

Excel applies a default theme to all new workbooks along with a theme gallery
so that you can change the default theme. After you select a new theme, all gal-
leries and all the elements in your workbook formatted with theme styles
change to match the new theme.
Following is a description of the three parts of a theme:
 Theme font: A theme uses two complementary fonts — a header font and a
body font. All elements using themed styles thus use the same font or
fonts. Click the arrow on the drop-down box (called the font picker) in the
Ribbon’s Home tab to see the fonts used in the theme currently applied to
the workbook.
 Theme color: A theme uses a matched set of twelve colors. Click the arrow
on the Fill Color or Font Color tool in the Font group of the Home tab to see
ten of the colors used in the theme currently applied to the workbook (see
Figure 1-8).
The following are characteristics of theme colors:
• The top row in a color picker displays the base theme colors, and the
next five rows display various tints and shades of the base colors.
Below the theme colors are standard colors that do not change if the
theme is changed. If you want to apply specific formatting that doesn’t
change after you change the theme, use a standard color.
• The first four colors on the picker (from the left), are intended for text
and background use. These colors are designed so that light text
always shows well on a dark background, and vice versa.
• The next six colors are used for accents. Most of the theme-style gal-
leries in Excel make extensive use of accent colors.
The two colors that are not exposed on the color pickers are used for
hyperlinks (not discussed in this book).
 Theme effect: Theme effects apply to graphic elements such as charts and
shapes and include three levels of styles for outlines, fills, and special
effects. Special effects include shadow, glow, bevel, and reflection.
Figure 1-8
16
Part 1: Getting to Know Excel 2007

You can change the theme in a workbook by clicking the Themes button in the
Ribbon’s Page Layout tab and selecting a new theme from the gallery that appears.
Remember: The three Microsoft Office applications — Excel 2007, Word 2007, and
PowerPoint 2007 — share the same themes. If you create reports that combine
elements from each application, your reports will have a consistent look if you
use a common theme.
Soliciting Help
With so many features and options available in Excel, it isn’t unusual to get
stuck once in a while. Fortunately, Excel provides the following methods for get-
ting help easily:

Enhanced ScreenTips: Standard ScreenTips (also called ToolTips) have
been available in Excel for some time and provide textual context to
commands. After you hover your mouse pointer over a command in earlier
versions of Excel, Excel displays the action of the command using either a
single word (such as Paste) or a brief phrase (such as Increase Font Size).
A standard ScreenTip helps to decipher the meaning of a command button,
for example, when the button has no associated text and the command
meaning is unclear from the button icon.
Enhanced ScreenTips take the concept a step further by adding a short
description explaining the purpose of the command (hence the prefix
Enhanced). Some Enhanced ScreenTips include an explanatory graphic
when a text description is insufficient to explain the meaning of the com-
mand. Enhanced ScreenTips are available for all commands on the Ribbon.
In many cases, the ScreenTip explanation provides enough information, so
you don’t have to seek additional help. By default, Excel 2007 uses
Enhanced ScreenTips for all commands.
 Contextual help: If the Enhanced ScreenTip doesn’t offer enough for you
to understand the use of a specific command, you can get more detailed
help. After you hover the mouse pointer over the command, the Enhanced
ScreenTip that pops up lets you know whether additional help for the com-
mand is available by indicating that you can press F1 for more help.
If you are in a dialog box and need help for the dialog box options, press
the help button (the question mark) to get contextual help.
 General help: Click the help button (the question mark) on the right side
of the Ribbon or press F1 when you are not in a specific context (for exam-
ple, the mouse pointer is not hovering over a command in the Ribbon) to
display a list of general help topics.
Formatting with Themes — Soliciting Help
17

When you use contextual help or general help, Excel displays the help viewer,
shown in Figure 1-9. The viewer sports Internet browser-style controls. In fact, it
was built using the same technology that Microsoft uses in its Internet Explorer
browser application. Of course, the viewer is not a full-fledged browser because
you can view only Excel help content.

The major features of the help viewer follow:
 Search box: You can enter specific search text in this box. The viewer
stores a list of your text searches for the current help session. Click the
drop-down arrow on the side of the box to view and select an item from the
list if you want to review a previous search result.
 Search button: Click the Search button (or press Enter) to initiate a search
after you enter the search text in the search box. Click the arrow next to
the search button to define the search scope. By default, if your computer
is connected to the Internet, Excel will display help content from an online
source. If possible, you should use this source as your first choice because
Microsoft updates the contents of online help regularly.
If you are offline when you initiate a search, Excel uses help content inter-
nal to your system. You can force Excel to use internal help content always
by clicking the arrow next to the Search button and choosing Offline Excel
Help from the menu.
Whether online or offline, you can narrow you search scope further by
selecting an appropriate option from the Search button menu.
 Search result window: This window displays the results of your search
request. If you use contextual help or enter text in the search box, the
window displays help information specific to the context of the search. If
you use general help, the window displays a list of general help topics in
the form of titled links. Clicking a link displays a new set of links with more
specific titles. Click the specific link title that best matches your search cri-
terion to display detailed information on the topic.
 Status bar: The left side of the status bar (located at the bottom of the help
viewer) displays the current search scope. The right side of the status bar
displays the connection status. You can click in the connection status area
to switch quickly between viewing online and offline help content.
 Maximize/Restore button: Click this button for a full-screen view of the
help window. Click again to restore the window to its previous size.
 Minimize button: Click this button to hide the help viewer window. Click
the Help button on the Windows taskbar (normally located below the Excel
window) to redisplay the viewer.
 Close button: Click this button to close the help viewer.
 Pin button: By default, Excel keeps the help viewer window on top when
you are working in the application. Use the Pin button to control this
behavior. If you “unpin” the viewer, Excel hides the window automatically if
you click anywhere inside the Excel window.

Contents pane on the left side of the help viewer. The pane displays the
same list of topics that the main windows displays after you select general
help or click the Home button. Clicking a main topic in the pane displays a
list of subtopics, similar to the subtopics that the main windows displays
after you click a general help topic link. The Table of Contents pane is con-
venient if you want to view the details of multiple subtopics in succession.
 Text size button: Click this button to select a size for the text in the search
result window.
 Print button: Click this button to print the help topic that the search result
window displays.
 Home button: After browsing multiple helps topics in the search result
window, you might want to return to the list of main help topics to choose
another general topic link. Click the Home button to return to the list of
main help topics.
 Refresh button: Click this button to refresh the help topic list after you
connect or disconnect from the Internet while the help viewer is open.
 Stop button: Click this button to cancel a search request if the help viewer
is experiencing difficulties connecting to the online help source.
 Back and Forward buttons: After browsing multiple helps topics in the
search result window, you might want to navigate among results and various
levels of detail. Click the Back or Forward button to perform your navigation.
If you want to resize the help viewer window, move the mouse pointer to any
edge of the window until the pointer changes to a double-headed arrow, and
then drag the mouse.

Activating a Workbook
A workbook is active when its window is maximized in the Excel window or after
you select any part of the workbook when its window is not maximized. See also
“Familiarizing Yourself with the Excel 2007 Window,” in Part 1 and “Switching
among Open Workbooks,” later in this part.
Arranging Windows Automatically
If you want all your open workbook windows visible on-screen, you can move
and resize them manually — or you can have Excel do it automatically. Follow
these steps to make all open workbooks visible on the Excel screen:
1. Click the View tab in the Ribbon.
2. Click the Arrange All button. Excel displays the Arrange Windows dialog
box.
3. Choose from the Tiled, Horizontal, Vertical, or Cascade options.
4. Click OK.
You can save the layout of your open workbooks for future use. See “Using a
Workspace File,” later in this part.
See also “Comparing Two Workbooks Side by Side,” later in this part.
Changing the Default File Location
When you’re opening a document in Excel, by default the Open dialog box
points to the My Documents folder (Windows XP) or the Documents folder
(Windows Vista) as the starting location to open documents. If you keep fre-
quently used documents in a different folder, you may want the Open dialog box
to point to this different folder to save some navigation steps. To change the
default folder, follow these steps:
1. Click the Office button, and then click the Excel Options button. The Excel
Options dialog box appears. The options are divided into sections, which
appear in a list on the left side of the dialog box.
2. Click the Save section.
22
Part 2: Managing Workbooks

3. In the Default File Location text box, enter the path of the new default
starting location to open documents. For example, if your new default
document location is in a subfolder named Excel, which itself is in the My
Documents or Documents folder, add \Excel to the default path. The new
location in the text box should read C:\Users\Username\Documents\
Excel, where Username is the actual name of the user indicated in the 
text box.
4. Click OK.
Closing a Workbook
If you’re no longer working with a workbook , you may want to close the work-
book so that you can work on other documents without distraction. Closing
unneeded workbooks also frees memory and minimizes potential screen clutter.
To close the unneeded workbook or workbooks, follow these steps:
1. If multiple workbooks are open, ensure that the workbook you want to
close is active as follows: Click the View tab on the Ribbon, click the
Switch Windows button, and select the workbook from the list of names in
the menu.
2. Use any of the following methods to close the workbook:
• Click the Office button and then choose Close.
• Click the Close button on the far right of the Ribbon tab area (or on
the workbook’s title bar if the workbook is not maximized).
• Double-click the Control button on the far left of the workbook’s title
bar if the workbook is not maximized.
• Press Ctrl+F4.
• Press Ctrl+W.
If you’ve made any changes to your workbook since the last time you saved it,
Excel asks whether you want to save the changes before closing the workbook.
Activating a Workbook — Closing a Workbook 23

Comparing Two Workbooks Side by Side
Sometimes you have two versions of a workbook, and you want to compare the dif-
ferences in the data visually. Excel provides a convenient feature that allows you to
compare two documents side by side. To use this feature, follow these steps:
1. Open the workbooks you want to compare.
2. Click the View tab on the Ribbon and then click the View Side by Side
button. Excel arranges the windows of the two workbooks horizontally. If
you have more than two workbooks open, Excel displays a dialog box
from which you select the name of the workbook you want to compare
with the active workbook.
3. Click a worksheet tab in each workbook to display the worksheet data you
want to compare.
4. In the View tab, click the Synchronous Scrolling button to toggle synchro-
nized scrolling on and off. After you enable synchronized scrolling, 
the rows and columns in the two worksheets being compared scroll 
simultaneously.
5. You can click the Reset Window Position button in the View tab to ensure
that the two workbook windows are sized equally and aligned horizon-
tally. You need to use the button only if you adjust either or both window
sizes during the current session.
You can save the layout of the open workbooks you’re comparing for future use.
See “Using a Workspace File,” later in this part.
Creating an Empty Workbook
After you start Excel, it automatically creates a new (empty) workbook that it
calls Book1. If you’re starting a new project from scratch, you can use this blank
workbook.
You can create another blank workbook in the following ways:
 Press Ctrl+N.
 Click the Office button, choose New, select Blank Workbook, and click
Create.
You can add a button to the Quick Access toolbar that allows you to create a
blank workbook with a single mouse click. Click the arrow to the right of the
Quick Access toolbar and choose New from the menu. Excel adds the New button
to the toolbar. See also “Working with the Quick Access Toolbar,” in Part 1.
24
Part 2: Managing Workbooks

Creating Multiple Windows (Views) for a Workbook
Sometimes, you want to view two parts of a worksheet at once. Or you want to
see more than one sheet in the same workbook at the same time. You can
accomplish either of these actions by displaying your workbook in one or more
additional windows.
To create a new view of the active workbook, click the View tab on the Ribbon
and then click the New Window button. Excel displays a new window for the
active workbook. To help you keep track of the windows, Excel appends a colon
and a number to the workbook name in each window, as shown in Figure 2-1.
See also “Arranging Windows Automatically,” earlier in this part, and “Comparing
Two Workbooks Side by Side,” earlier in this part.
Remember: A single workbook can have as many views (that is, separate win-
dows) as you want.
Displaying multiple windows for a workbook also makes copying information
from one worksheet to another easier. You can use Excel’s drag-and-drop proce-
dures to copy a cell, a range, or a chart. See also “Copying Cells and Ranges,” in
Part 4, and “Resizing, Moving, Copying, and Deleting an Embedded Chart,” in
Part 10.
Opening Nonstandard Files
In addition to files in its native format, Excel 2007 can open files in non-Excel
2007 formats, including older Excel and text files. Excel 2007 can open files that
weren’t saved in its native format by using filters to open the foreign file as a
workbook document.
Figure 2-1
Comparing Two Workbooks Side by Side — Opening Nonstandard Files 25

To open a file in a non-Excel 2007 format, follow these steps:
1. Click the Office button and then choose Open. Excel displays the Open
dialog box.
2. Windows XP: In the Files of Type drop-down list, select the file type.
Windows Vista: Click the button located above the Open and Close button
and choose a file type from the menu. By default, the button text reads All
Excel Files (*.xl*;*.xlsx;*.xlsm) but the text changes if you select a differ-
ent file type.
3. Windows XP: In the Look In drop-down list, navigate to the folder that con-
tains the file.
Windows Vista: In the Folders window on the left side of the dialog box,
navigate to the folder that contains the document. If the Folders window
isn’t displayed, click Folders.
4. Select the file and click Open, or double-click the filename.
See also “Opening a Workbook,” immediately following this section.
Opening a Workbook
If you open a workbook in Excel, the entire document loads into memory, and
any changes that you make occur only in the copy that’s in memory.
To open an existing workbook , follow these steps:
1. Click the Office button and then choose Open to display the Open 
dialog box. Alternatively, press Ctrl+O or Ctrl+F12 to display the Open
dialog box.
2. Windows XP: In the Look In drop-down list, navigate to the folder that con-
tains the document.
Windows Vista: In the Folders window on the left side of the dialog box,
navigate to the folder that contains the document. If the Folders window
isn’t displayed, click Folder (see Figure 2-2).
3. Select the workbook in the selected folder and click Open, or double-click
the filename.
You can select more than one document in the Open dialog box. The trick is to
press and hold Ctrl while you click each document. After you select all the docu-
ments you want, click Open.
26
Part 2: Managing Workbooks

Remember: You can open a workbook you have worked with recently without
navigating through the Open dialog box. On the right side of the Office menu,
Excel provides a Recent Documents list. If the document that you want to open
appears in this list, you can choose it directly from the menu.
Protecting and Unprotecting a Workbook
Excel provides several levels of protection for your sensitive work. Here are
some ways you can protect your workbooks. You can protect
 A workbook from being opened by unauthorized personnel
 A workbook from being saved with the same filename
 A workbook’s structure (control the manipulation of worksheets in a 
workbook)
 A workbook’s windows (control the sizing and positioning of a workbook’s
windows and any workbook views you create)
You should write down any passwords you use and store them in a safe location.
If you forget or lose your passwords, you won’t be able to undo the areas you
protected by any normal means.
Safeguarding your workbook from unauthorized users
Follow these steps to restrict unauthorized personnel from opening or modify-
ing a workbook:
1. Open a workbook or select an already opened workbook you want to 
protect.
Figure 2-2
Opening a Workbook — Protecting and Unprotecting a Workbook 27

2. Click the Office button and choose Save As. Excel displays the Save As
dialog box.
3. Click Tools and choose General Options from the menu. Excel displays the
General Options dialog box.
4. In the Password to Open text box, enter a password that must be used
before a user can open the workbook.
5. In the Password to Modify text box, enter a password that must be used
before a user can save the workbook under the same filename. Passwords
can be up to 15 characters and are case sensitive.
6. Click OK. Excel asks you to reenter the passwords for confirmation.
7. Reenter the passwords.
8. Windows XP: In the Save In drop-down, select the folder in which to save
the workbook and then click Save.
Windows Vista: If the Folders window isn’t displayed, click Browse
Folders, click Folders to display the Folders window, and then select the
folder in which to save the document. Then click Save.
9. If you’re saving the workbook with the same name, respond when Excel
displays a message asking you to confirm overwriting the file.
To remove passwords from the workbook, follow the previous steps, except
delete the passwords in Step 4, Step 5, or both.
See also “Saving Files,” later in this part.
If you are using a workbook saved in an earlier version of Excel, Excel 2007 displays
a message offering to convert the workbook to the Office XML file format (the
default file format) before you save the workbook with passwords. You should
choose to accept the suggestion only if you will not be sharing the workbook with
users who have earlier versions of Excel. See also “Saving Files,” later in this part.
The General Options dialog box offers other safeguarding options. Select the
Always Create a Backup check box if you want Excel to always save a backup
copy of the existing workbook before you save the workbook. If you select the
Read Only Recommended check box, when the workbook is opened, Excel dis-
plays a message suggesting that the workbook be opened as read only. The user,
however, can choose to ignore the suggestion.
Protecting and unprotecting a workbook structure or window
To protect a workbook structure or window properties from accidental or inten-
tional alteration, follow these steps:
28
Part 2: Managing Workbooks

1. Click the Review tab on the Ribbon and then click the Protect Workbook
button. Excel displays the Protect Workbook dialog box.
2. Select the appropriate check box(es), as follows:
• Structure prevents any of the following changes to a workbook sheet:
adding, deleting, moving, renaming, hiding, or unhiding.
• Windows protects the workbook window from being moved or resized.
3. If you feel that you need a high level of protection, supply a password
in the Password text box, and click OK. When Excel requests that you
reenter the password for confirmation, do so.
4. Click OK.
To unprotect a workbook structure or window, click the Review tab on the
Ribbon and then click the Unprotect Workbook button. If you did not supply a
password when the workbook was protected, Excel unprotects the workbook
automatically. Otherwise, Excel prompts you to enter a password.
Saving Files
When you save a workbook, Excel saves the copy in memory to your drive —
overwriting the previous copy of the workbook. When you save a workbook for
the first time, Excel displays its Save As dialog box.
Excel 2007 uses a new default format for saving workbook documents. This new
format is based on the Extensible Markup Language (XML). Office 2007 applica-
tions use an extension to XML called Office Open XML. Workbooks saved in
Office Open XML maintain full fidelity with everything in your document, includ-
ing (in the case of Excel) formulas, formatting, charts, tables, and macros. XML
and Office Open XML are text-based formats (versus the binary formats found in
earlier versions of Office applications).
You don’t need to have a complete (or even partial) knowledge of XML or Office
XML to work in Excel 2007. However, it is useful to know that Excel 2007, like ear-
lier versions, saves files with a different file extension depending on the type of
file you are saving. A list of the standard file types and the extension names they
use are given in the following table. We also include the corresponding file exten-
sions used in earlier versions of Excel.

* In Excel 2007, you can customize the Quick Access toolbar as we discuss in Part 1. In earlier versions of Excel, you can customize an existing
menu or toolbar or create a menu or toolbar. Excel saves these customizations automatically in an .xlb file, whose location depends on the
operating system you’re using (Windows XP or Windows Vista).
Remember: Unlike earlier versions of Excel, the table indicates that Excel 2007
workbooks or templates containing macros (scripts written to enhance Excel in
some manner) are stored in files that differ from files without macros. If you
attempt to save a macro-based workbook or template in a format that doesn’t
support macros (.xlsx or .xltx), Excel gives you the option to save the file with-
out macros or to select a format that supports macros (.xlsm or .xltm).
Saving a workbook
Use any of the following methods to save the active workbook:
 Click the Office button and then choose Save.
 Click the Save button on the Quick Access toolbar.
 Press Ctrl+S.
 Press Shift+F12.
If the document you’re saving does not yet have a name, Excel prompts you for a
name by opening its Save As dialog box. You can give the document a name and
navigate to the folder where you want to store the file. See also “Saving a work-
book under a different name,” in the next section.
Saving a workbook under a different name
Sometimes you may want to keep multiple versions of your work by saving each
successive version under a different name.
To save a workbook with a different name, follow these steps:
30
Part 2: Managing Workbooks

1. Click the Office button and then choose Save As. Excel displays the Save
As dialog box.
2. Windows XP: In the Save In drop-down list, select the folder in which to
save the workbook.
Windows Vista: If the Folders window isn’t displayed, click Browse
Folders, click Folders to display the Folders window, and then select the
folder in which to save the workbook (see FIgure 2-3).
3. In the File Name text box, enter a new filename. (You don’t need to include
a file extension.)
4. Click Save.
Excel creates a new copy of the workbook with a different name, but the original
version of the workbook remains intact. (Note that the original workbook is no
longer open.)
Saving a workbook in a different or earlier file format
To share a workbook with someone who uses an application that opens files in a
format other than Excel 2007, be sure to save the workbook in a file format that
the other application can read.
Excel can save workbook contents in many non-Excel file formats, such as, tab-
or comma-delimited text, html, and standard xml.
To save a workbook in a different file format, follow these steps:
Figure 2-3
Saving Files
31

1. Click the Office button and then choose Save As.
2. In the Save As Type drop-down list, select the format in which you want to
save the file. For example, to save in an earlier Excel file format, select
Excel 97-2003 Workbook.
3. Click Save.
Excel separates a list of some Excel file formats from the complete list of file
types to save you time in navigating the Save As dialog box. Click the arrow at
the end of the Save As option in the Office menu to display the list of some
common Excel file formats.
Remember: If you attempt to save a workbook with features not supported in the
file format you’re saving to, Excel displays a warning message. If the format
you’re saving to is an earlier version of Excel, Excel displays the Compatibility
Checker dialog box, which shows you a list of features that will be lost.
Switching among Open Workbooks
If you have multiple workbooks open, the workbooks usually appear maximized
on-screen so that you can view only one workbook at a time.
To switch the active display among workbooks, use one of the following 
methods:
 Click the View tab on the Ribbon, click the Switch Windows button, and
then select one of the workbook names in the menu that appears.
 Press Ctrl+F6 or Ctrl+Tab to cycle the active display among the open 
workbooks.
Using a Workspace File
The term workspace refers to the layout of all the open workbooks — their
screen positions and window sizes.
You may have a project that uses two or more workbooks, and you may like to
arrange the windows in a certain way to make them easy to access at a later
time. Fortunately, Excel enables you to save your entire workspace to a file.
After you open the workspace file, Excel sets up the workbooks exactly as they
were when you saved your workspace.
32
Part 2: Managing Workbooks

Opening a workspace file
To open a workspace file, follow the steps outlined for “Opening Nonstandard
Files,” earlier in this part, except in Step 2, select Workspaces (*.xlw) from the
drop-down list (Windows XP) or menu (Windows Vista). Excel opens all the
workbooks that you originally saved in the workspace.
See also “Saving a workspace file,” the next section.
Saving a workspace file
To save your workspace, follow these steps:
1. Click the View tab on the Ribbon and then click the Save Workspace
button. Excel displays the Save Workspace dialog box.
2. Use the filename that Excel proposes (for example, resume.xlw or
resume), or enter a different name in the File Name text box.
3. Windows XP: In the Save In drop-down box, navigate to where you want to
save the workspace.
Windows Vista: If the Folders window isn’t displayed, click Browse
Folders, click Folders to display the Folders window, and then select the
folder in which to save the workspace.
4. Click Save.
A workspace file contains not the workbooks themselves but only the informa-
tion that Excel needs to recreate the workspace. Excel saves the workbooks in
standard workbook files. If you distribute a workspace file to a coworker, there-
fore, make sure that you also include the workbook files that the workspace file
refers to.
Working with Workbook Templates
A workbook template is basically a workbook that contains one or more work-
sheets set up with formatting and formulas and ready for you to enter data and
get immediate results. A workbook template can use any of Excel’s features,
such as charts, formulas, and macros. Excel includes templates that automate
the common tasks of filling in invoices, expense statements, and purchase
orders. You can also download several more templates from the Internet. You
can also create your own templates from scratch or from an existing workbook.
Creating a workbook template
To save a workbook as a template, follow these steps:
Switching among Open Workbooks — Working with Workbook Templates
33

1. Click the Office button and then choose Save As.
2. In the Save As Type drop-down list, select Excel Template.
3. If you want to save the template in a subfolder of the Templates folder in
Windows XP: Excel displays the Templates folder in the Save In drop-down
list. Select the subfolder in the Save In drop-down list.
If you want to save the template in a subfolder of the Templates folder in
Windows Vista: Click Browse Folders (if the Folders window isn’t dis-
played) and click Folders to display the Folders window if necessary (the
Templates folder is automatically selected after Step 2), and then select a
subfolder.
To create a new folder in the Templates folder in which you can save the
template, click the Create New Folder button in the Save As dialog box
and give the new folder a name.
4. In the File Name box, enter a name for the template, and then click Save.
Excel saves templates with an .xltx file extension. If your template con-
tains macros, Excel gives you the option to save the template without
macros or to save in a format that supports macros (.xltm). See also
“Saving Files,” earlier in this part.
You can also save a template in an earlier file format. In Step 2, select Excel
97-2003 Template from the Save As Type drop-down list box.
To prevent overwriting the template file when you create a new workbook from
a template, always save your templates in the Templates folder or a subfolder
within the Templates folder.
Creating a workbook from a template
If you create a new workbook that you based on a template, Excel creates a copy
of the template in memory so that the original template, on disk, remains intact.
The default workbook name is the template name with a number appended to it.
For example, if you create a new workbook based on a template by the name of
Report.xltx, the workbook default name is Report1.xlsx. The first time that you
save a workbook that you create from a template, Excel displays the Save As
dialog box so that you can give the file a new name.
To create a workbook from a template, follow these steps:
1. Click the Office button and then choose New. Excel displays the 
New Workbook dialog box, as shown in Figure 2-4.
2. Select a template category from the list on the left side of the dialog box.
The choices are as follows:
34
Part 2: Managing Workbooks

• Blank and Recent: This is the default category. From here you can
select Recently Used Templates. Select a template and click Create to
open a copy of the template file.
• Installed Templates: This category displays a gallery of templates
installed in your system. Select a template and click Create to open a
copy of the selected template.
• My Templates: This category contains templates you previously saved
in the Templates folder or in a subfolder in the Templates folder. Click
My Templates to display the New dialog box. Templates you create in
the Templates folder appear in the My Templates tab. If you saved
Templates in one or more subfolders in the Templates folder, the
folder names appear as tabs in the New dialog box. Select a template
from a tab and click OK. Excel opens a copy of the template.
• New from Existing: This category allows you to use any workbook as
a template or to use a template file that’s not in the Templates folder.
Click New from Existing to display the New from Existing Workbook
dialog box. Navigate to the folder containing the file you want to use as
a template, select the file in the folder, and click Create New. Excel
opens a copy of the file.
• Microsoft Office Online: If you are connected to the Internet, you can
select from one of the online categories and Excel will display a list of
available templates in the selected category. Choose a template, click
Download, and Excel opens a copy of the template.
3. Save the workbook after you enter the appropriate data in the template
copy. See also “Saving Workbooks” and “Creating a workbook template,”
earlier in this part.
Figure 2-4
Working with Workbook Templates
35

Creating a default workbook template
You can create a default workbook template that defines the formatting or con-
tent of the new (blank) workbooks that open after you start Excel. Excel bases
every new (blank) workbook that you open on the default workbook template.
The default workbook template that you create replaces Excel’s built-in default
workbook template.
Follow these steps to create a default workbook template:
1. Create a new workbook. See “Creating an Empty Workbook,” earlier in this
part.
2. Add or delete as many worksheets as you want to appear in the new work-
book. See “Adding a New Worksheet” and “Deleting a Worksheet,” both in
Part 3.
3. If you want, turn off the display of gridlines. See “Turning off Gridlines,” in
Part 3.
4. Apply the desired formatting, sheet names, text, styles, and so on. 
See Part 8 if you need help applying different formatting options.
5. Select a new theme for the template if you don’t like Excel’s default
choice. See “Formatting with Themes,” in Part 1.
6. Click the Office button, choose Save As, and select Excel Template from
the Save As Type drop-down list.
7. Windows XP: In the Save In drop-down list, locate an xlstart folder. Excel
can use more than one xlstart folder and will open all files located in these
folders on startup. The xlstart folders normally reside in the following
locations: C:\Documents and Settings\Username\Application Data\
Microsoft\Excel (where Username is your login username) and C:\
Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office 12 folders, respectively.
Windows Vista: If the Folders window isn’t displayed, click Browse
Folders, click Folders to display the Folders window, and then locate the
xlstart folder. Excel can use more than one xlstart folder and will open all
files located in these folders on startup. The xlstart folders normally
reside in: C:\Users\Username\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Excel 
(where Username is your login name) and C:\Program Files\Microsoft
Office\Office 12 folders, respectively.
8. In the File Name text box, type book.xlt.
9. Click Save.
All new (blank) workbooks that you create are now replicas of the book.xlt work-
book that you saved in Step 9.
You can always edit the book.xlt file or delete it if you no longer want to use it.
36
Part 2: Managing Workbooks

Working with
Worksheets
A workbook can consist of any number of worksheets. Each sheet has a tab that
appears at the bottom of the workbook window. In this part, we discuss several
useful things that you can do with worksheets.

Part 3

Activating a Worksheet
Before you can do any work in a worksheet, you must first activate it. To acti-
vate a worksheet, just click its tab. If the tab for the sheet that you want to acti-
vate isn’t visible, use the tab scrolling buttons to scroll the sheet tabs. Figure 3-1
shows how Excel highlights the active sheet. You also can use the following
shortcut keys to activate a different sheet:
 Ctrl+PgUp: Activates the previous sheet, if you have one.
 Ctrl+PgDn: Activates the next sheet, if you have one.
Adding a New Worksheet
You can add a new worksheet to a workbook in the following ways:
 Click the Insert Worksheet tab button, which is located after the last
worksheet tab in the workbook.
 Press Shift+F11.
In either case, Excel inserts a new worksheet and it becomes the active work-
sheet. The default name that Excel gives to the worksheet is the word Sheet,
followed by a number.
Changing a Worksheet’s Name
By default, Excel names its worksheets Sheet1, Sheet2, and so on. Providing
more meaningful names helps you identify a particular sheet. To change a
sheet’s name:
1. Double-click the sheet tab, or right-click the sheet tab and choose Rename
from the menu that appears. Either method selects the text in the tab.
2. Type the new sheet name directly on the tab.
Active worksheet highlighted
Figure 3-1
38
Part 3: Working with Worksheets

Remember: Sheet names can be up to 31 characters long. Names can include
spaces but not the following characters: [ ] (brackets); : (colon); / (slash); 
\ (backslash); ? (question mark); and * (asterisk).
Coloring a Worksheet Tab
Excel enables you to add color to a worksheet tab. You can use this feature, for
example, to quickly identify a specific worksheet by its color. To color a work-
sheet tab, follow these steps:
1. Select the worksheet tab that you want to color.
2. Right-click the sheet tab, and choose Tab Color from the menu that
appears.
3. Select a color for the tab from the color picker that appears.
To undo the tab color, follow the same procedure, but click the No Color option
in the color picker.
Remember: If you select a tab that you have color-coded, the tab color appears
below the sheet name. If a tab is fully colored, it’s not currently selected.
Copying a Worksheet
You can copy a worksheet — and put the copy either in the original workbook
or in a different workbook — in either of the following ways:
 Right-click the worksheet tab and choose Move or Copy from the menu
that appears. Excel opens the Move or Copy dialog box, as shown in
Figure 3-2. Select the location for the copy in the To Book drop-down list
(to copy the sheet to a new or other open workbook) or the Before Sheet
list box, or both. Make sure that the Create a Copy check box is selected.
Click OK to make the copy.
 Click the worksheet tab, press Ctrl, and drag the sheet to the desired loca-
tion in the workbook. As you drag, the mouse pointer changes to a small
sheet with a plus sign on it, and a small arrow guides you. To use this
method to copy a worksheet to another open workbook, you must first
arrange the workbooks. See “Arranging Windows Automatically,” in Part 2.
Remember: To copy a worksheet to a different workbook, both workbooks must
be open.
Activating a Worksheet — Copying a Worksheet
39

If necessary, Excel changes the name of the copied sheet to make it unique
within the workbook. If you copy a sheet by the name of Sheet1 to a workbook
that already contains a Sheet1, for example, Excel changes the name of the
copied sheet to Sheet1 (2). To change the name of a sheet, see “Changing a
Worksheet’s Name,” earlier in this part.
Deleting a Worksheet
To delete a worksheet, right-click the sheet tab and choose Delete from the
menu that appears. If the sheet you want to delete contains data (or if you
delete all the data on a sheet in the current session), Excel asks you to confirm
the fact that you want to delete the sheet. Every workbook must contain at least
one sheet, so if you try to delete the only sheet, Excel complains.
To select multiple sheets to delete, press Ctrl while clicking the sheet tabs that
you want to delete. To select a group of contiguous sheets, click the first sheet
tab, press Shift, and then click the last sheet tab.
After you delete a worksheet, it’s gone for good. This operation is one of the few
in Excel that you can’t undo. Therefore, you may want to save a workbook
before deleting worksheets. Then, if you inadvertently delete a worksheet, you
can revert to the saved version.
Freezing Row or Column Titles
Many worksheets are set up with row and column headings. As you scroll
through such worksheets, you can easily get lost after the row and column head-
ings scroll out of view. Excel provides a handy solution to alleviate this problem:
freezing rows and columns.
Figure 3-2
40
Part 3: Working with Worksheets

To freeze entire rows or columns, follow these steps:
1. Move the cell pointer to the cell below the row that you want to freeze
and to the right of the column that you want to freeze. Use the following
steps to freeze various portions of the worksheet:
• To freeze row 1 and column A, for example, move the cell pointer to
cell B2.
• To freeze rows only, move the cell pointer below the rows that you
want to freeze in column A.
• To freeze columns only, move the cell pointer to the right of the
columns that you want to freeze in row 1.
2. Click the View tab on the Ribbon.
3. Click the Freeze Panes button and choose Freeze Panes from the menu.
Excel inserts dark lines to indicate the frozen rows and columns. These
frozen rows and columns remain visible as you scroll throughout the
worksheet.
To unfreeze the frozen rows or columns, repeat Steps 2 and 3 but in Step 3,
choose Unfreeze Panes from the menu. See also “Splitting Panes,” later in this
part.
You can quickly freeze the top row or left column by clicking the View tab on the
Ribbon, clicking the Freeze Panes button, and choosing either Freeze Top Row
or Freeze First Column from the menu. These options are useful because data is
often stored in worksheets with labels in the top row, first column, or both. Note
that the cell pointer can be in any location when you select either of these
options.
An alternative to freezing row titles is to convert the range to a table. When
table headers scroll off the sheet, Excel displays the header titles in the column
header. See Part 11, “Working with Tables.”
Grouping and Ungrouping Worksheets
Excel allows you to group multiple worksheets so that you can perform tasks on
all the sheets in the group simultaneously. For example, you can group sheets to
print, you can apply formatting to a given range in all the sheets in a group, or
you can enter data into the same cell or range in all the sheets in the group. Any
modifications you make to one sheet in the group are applied to the other
sheets in the group.
Deleting a Worksheet — Grouping and Ungrouping Worksheets
41

Grouping worksheets
If the sheets you want to group are contiguous, follow these steps:
1. Select the tab of the first sheet by clicking it.
2. Press and hold down the Shift key and select the tab of the last sheet.
Excel selects all the sheets between the first and last, inclusive.
If the sheets you want to group are not contiguous, follow these steps:
1. Select the tab of the first sheet by clicking it.
2. Press and hold down the Ctrl key and click the tabs of the other sheets in
turn.
Remember: You can’t switch among sheets in a group if all the sheets in the work-
book are grouped. In this case, clicking any inactive sheet tab (any sheet tab
with the name not highlighted) ungroups all the worksheets.
If you need to group and switch among all your existing worksheets in the work-
book, add a new (blank) worksheet first. See also “Adding a New Worksheet,”
earlier in this part.
Ungrouping worksheets
You can use any of the following methods to ungroup worksheets. The first three
methods ungroup all worksheets; the last ungroups only an inactive sheet.
 Click any unselected sheet tab to ungroup all worksheets.
 Press and hold down the Shift key and click the active sheet tab (the sheet
tab with the highlighted name) to ungroup all worksheets.
 If all the sheets in the workbook are grouped, click any inactive sheet tab to
ungroup all worksheets.
 Press and hold down the Ctrl key and click an inactive sheet tab in the
group to ungroup only that worksheet.
Hiding and Unhiding a Worksheet
Hiding a worksheet is useful if you don’t want others to see it or if you just want
to get it out of the way. If a sheet is hidden, its sheet tab is also hidden.
To hide a worksheet, right-click the worksheet tab and choose Hide from the
contextual menu or click the View tab on the Ribbon and then click the Hide
button. The selected worksheet is hidden from view.
42
Part 3: Working with Worksheets

You can select multiple sheets to hide at once. If the sheets you want to hide are
contiguous, click the first sheet, press and hold down Shift, and click the last
sheet. If the sheets are noncontiguous, click the first sheet, press and hold down
Ctrl, and click the other sheets in succession.
Remember: Every workbook must have at least one visible sheet, so Excel 
doesn’t allow you to hide all sheets in a workbook.
To unhide a hidden worksheet, follow these steps:
1. Right-click any visible sheet tab and click Unhide from the contextual
menu, or click the View tab on the Ribbon and click the Unhide button.
Excel displays the Unhide dialog box.
2. Select the sheet that you want to unhide, and click OK. You can unhide
only one sheet at a time.
Moving a Worksheet
Sometimes, you may want to rearrange the order of worksheets in a workbook —
or move a sheet to a different workbook.
First, select the sheet that you want to move by clicking the sheet tab. You can
also move multiple sheets at once by pressing Ctrl while you click the sheet tabs
that you want to move.
You can move a selected worksheet(s) in the following ways:
 Right-click the worksheet tab and choose Move or Copy from the contex-
tual menu that appears. Excel opens the Move or Copy dialog box. Select
the location for the move in the To Book drop-down list (to move the sheet
to a new or other open workbook) or in the Before Sheet list box, or in
both. Make sure that the Create a Copy check box is unchecked. Click OK
to move the sheet.
 Click the sheet tab, and drag the sheet to its desired location in the work-
book. As you drag, the mouse pointer changes to a small sheet, and a small
arrow guides you. To use this method to move a worksheet to another
open workbook, you must first arrange the workbooks. See “Copying a
Worksheet,” earlier in this part.
Remember: If you move a worksheet to a workbook that already contains a sheet
by the same name, Excel changes the name to make it unique. For example, If
you move Sheet1 to a workbook that already has a Sheet1, Excel changes the
name of the sheet you are moving to Sheet1 (2). To change the name of a sheet,
see “Changing a Worksheet’s Name,” earlier in this part.
Hiding and Unhiding a Worksheet — Moving a Worksheet
43

Protecting a Worksheet
Deleting a single formula in a worksheet often creates a ripple effect, causing
other formulas to produce an error value or, even worse, incorrect results. You
can circumvent such problems by locking the cells that you don’t want to be
modified and then protecting your worksheets from modification by following
these steps:
1. Right-click the tab of the worksheet you want to protect and choose
Protect Sheet from the contextual menu, or click the Review tab on the
Ribbon and click the Protect Sheet button. The Protect Sheet dialog box
appears, as shown in Figure 3-3.
2. Provide a password in the Protect Sheet dialog box, if you want.
• If you enter a password, you must reenter the password before the
sheet can be unprotected.
• If you don’t supply a password, anyone can unprotect the sheet.
3. In the Allow All Users of This Worksheet To list box, click the appropriate
check boxes to select the elements that users can change after the sheet
is protected.
4. Click OK. If you entered a password in Step 2, Excel displays a dialog box
for you to confirm the password.
Remember: By default, all cells or objects have their locked property turned on,
which means that the cells or objects are locked when you protect the work-
sheet. Before protecting a worksheet, you normally want to unlock the input
cells (the cells in which you enter data). To lock or unlock cells, first select
them, and then right-click and choose Format Cells from the contextual menu;
then check or uncheck the Lock check box on the Protection tab. See also
“Selecting Cells and Ranges,” in Part 4.
Figure 3-3
44
Part 3: Working with Worksheets

To remove protection from a protected sheet, right-click the worksheet you
want to unprotect and choose Unprotect Sheet from the contextual menu, or
click the Review tab on the Ribbon and click the Unprotect Sheet button. If the
sheet was protected with a password, you have to enter the password before
you can unprotect the sheet.
Publishing Your Worksheet Data to the Web
Web publishing is the process of placing your Excel data on a Web or intranet
server as a Web page. In this process, you save your Excel data in HTML format
so that users can view your data using an Internet browser. Excel provides sev-
eral features designed to make the publishing process relatively painless.
To publish worksheet data to a Web page, follow these steps:
1. Select the worksheet containing the data you want to put on a Web page.
2. Click the Office button and then choose Save As. Excel displays the Save
As dialog box.
3. In the Save As Type drop-down list, Select Web Page. Some new controls
pertinent to Web publishing appear in the Save As dialog box, including
the Publish button.
4. Click the Publish button.
5. In the Publish as Web Page dialog box that appears, make a selection from
the Choose drop-down list. This list provides the following three main
selections:
• Previously published items: Use this option to republish data you’ve
previously published.
• Range of cells: Use this option to publish a range of cells in your work-
sheet. This option is automatically selected if you select the range
prior to Step 2 of this procedure.
• Items on <Sheetname>: Use this option to publish items in
<Sheetname>, where <Sheetname> is the name of the worksheet in
which you want to publish the items. This option is automatically
selected if you don’t select a specific item on <Sheetname> prior to
Step 2 of this procedure.
• Entire Workbook: Use this option to publish the entire workbook to a
Web page.
6. In the list box below the Choose drop-down list, select the range or work-
sheet item that you want to publish.
Protecting a Worksheet — Publishing Your Worksheet Data to the Web
45

If you select Items on <Sheetname> in Step 5, the selection box may dis-
play up to five items, depending on the objects in your worksheet. These
items are Sheet (for example, all data), Chart, PivotTable, AutoFilter, and
Print Area.
7. In the File Name text box, type the pathname and filename where you
want to save your worksheet or worksheet items. Click the Browse button
to help you locate the appropriate directory, folder, intranet, or Internet
location.
You may also check any or all of the following options:
• Change: Click this button to add a title for the Web page.
• File Name: Enter a name and location for your Web page if they are dif-
ferent from the name and location of your workbook file or use the
Browse button to navigate to the file location.
• Open Published Web Page in Browser: Select this check box to view
the Web page in your browser after you save or publish it.
• AutoRepublish Every Time This Workbook Is Saved: Select this check
box if you want Excel to republish your workbook every time the work-
book is saved. Using this option ensures that the data in your pub-
lished location is always up to date.
8. Click the Publish button.
If you select the sheet, range, chart, PivotTable, AutoFilter, or print area prior 
to Step 2, you can skip the Publish as Web Page dialog box by clicking the
Selection: <Item> radio button in the Save As dialog box. <Item> may be Sheet,
Chart, PivotTable, AutoFilter, Print Area, or a range of cells. Most of the options
in the Publish as Web Page dialog box are available, except Open Published Web
Page in a Browser and AutoRepublish Every Time This Workbook Is Saved.
Remember: Excel embeds additional information that describes complex format-
ting options to the HTML file. Sometimes you can’t view all the formatting
options applied to your document if the file is open in a Web browser because
many browsers can’t interpret this additional information.
Splitting Panes
Splitting an Excel window into two or four panes enables you to view multiple
parts of the same worksheet. Some of the key features of splitting panes are as
follows:
46
Part 3: Working with Worksheets

 Clicking the View tab on the Ribbon and then clicking the Split button
splits the active worksheet into two or four separate panes.
 The split occurs at the location of the cell pointer.
 You can use the mouse to drag and resize the pane.
 To remove the split panes, click the View tab on the Ribbon and then click
the Split button.
A faster way to split and unsplit panes is to drag either the vertical or horizontal
split bar, as shown in Figure 3-4. These split bars are standard elements of the
Excel window and are located above and to the right of the vertical and horizon-
tal scroll bars, respectively. To remove split panes by using the mouse, drag the
pane separator all the way to the edge of the window or just double-click it.
See also “Freezing Row or Column Titles,” earlier in this part.
Turning Off Gridlines
Sometimes you’re working with data to which you’ve applied a number of for-
matting options, but you find the worksheet gridlines distracting. In Excel 2007,
turning the gridline display on and off is easy. Just click the View tab on the
Ribbon and then click to clear the Gridlines check box.
Remember: Whether or not you have the gridline display turned on, gridlines
aren’t printed unless you select that option in the Sheet Options group of the
Ribbon’s Page Layout tab. See also “Printing gridlines or row and column head-
ings,” in Part 9.
Figure 3-4
Splitting Panes — Turning Off Gridlines
47

Using Full-Screen View
If you want to see as much information as possible in a worksheet, Excel offers
two options; you can hide the Ribbon controls or choose a full-screen view:
 See “Hiding the Ribbon commands from view,” in Part 1.
 Click the View tab on the Ribbon and then click the Full Screen button. The
Ribbon and its tabs, the Office button, the Quick Access toolbar, the for-
mula bar, and the status bar all disappear. Press Esc to restore the hidden
elements.
Zooming a Worksheet
Excel enables you to scale the size of your worksheets from 10 percent to 400
percent. Using a low zoom percentage can help you get a bird’s-eye view of your
worksheet to see its layout. A high zoom percentage can help you decipher very
small text.
The easiest way to change the zoom factor of the active worksheet is to use the
zoom control at the bottom right of the status bar (see Figure 3-5). You can drag
the slider to zoom in and out or you can click the Zoom in (+) or Zoom out (–)
buttons to change the view by 10 percent (per each click). The button on the
immediate left of the Zoom out button displays the current zoom percentage.
Clicking this button displays the Zoom dialog box. (You can open the Zoom
dialog box also by clicking the View tab on the Ribbon and then clicking the
Zoom button.)
The Zoom dialog box is useful if you want to use a precise zoom level (by enter-
ing a value in the custom box) or zoom a selection — for example a range of
cells or chart, to fit the worksheet window (by selecting the Fit Selection
option).
If you have a Microsoft IntelliMouse or equivalent device, you can zoom in or
out in a worksheet by pressing Ctrl while you roll the mouse wheel.

Part 3: Working with Worksheets

Entering and Editing
Worksheet Data
This part deals with two of the most common tasks you’re likely to perform on a
daily basis in Excel: entering data into worksheet cells and editing (or changing)
the data after you enter it. Excel provides many handy tools to make these tasks
painless and efficient.

Part 4

Copying Cells and Ranges
Copying cells is a common spreadsheet operation, and several types of copying
are possible. You can do any of the following:
 Copy one cell to another cell.
 Copy a cell to a range of cells. Excel copies the source cell to every cell in
the destination range.
 Copy a range to another range.
 Copy multiple cells or ranges to another range.
Remember: Copying a cell normally copies the cell contents, its cell comment 
(if any), and the formatting that was applied to the original cell. If you copy a
cell that contains a formula, the cell references in the copied formulas change
automatically to relate to their new location.
Copying a cell to another cell or a range
To copy the contents of one cell to a range of cells, follow these steps:
1. Move the cell pointer to the cell that you want to copy (the source cell).
2. Click the Copy button in the Ribbon’s Home tab. (You can also press
Ctrl+C or right-click the cell and choose Copy from the contextual menu.)
3. Select the cell or range that you want to hold the copy (the destination
cell or range).
4. Click the top part of the Paste split button in the Ribbon’s Home tab.
(You can also press Ctrl+V or right-click the destination cell or range
and choose Paste from the contextual menu.)
Excel displays the Paste Options Smart Tag next to the copied range.
Clicking the Smart Tag provides a list of alternative paste options, as
shown in Figure 4-1. For example, you can decide to match the destination
formatting (otherwise, Excel copies the source data formatting by default)
or copy formatting only (but not the data).
If you don’t need to use any of the options in the Paste Options Smart Tag,
you can press Enter instead of clicking the Paste button.
5. Press Esc to complete the copy operation and remove the Paste Options
Smart Tag. Note: This step isn’t necessary if you press Enter in Step 4.
If the range you’re copying to is adjacent to the cell you’re copying from, 
you can drag the cell’s AutoFill handle to copy the cell to the adjacent range. 
See “Filling a Series,” later in this part.
50
Part 4: Entering and Editing Worksheet Data

Copying a range to another range
To copy the contents of one range to another range of the same size, follow
these steps:
1. Select the range that you want to copy.
2. Click the Copy button in the Ribbon’s Home tab. (You can also press
Ctrl+C or right-click the range and choose Copy from the contextual
menu.)
3. Select the upper-left cell of the range that you want to use to hold the
copy.
4. Click the top part of the Paste split button in the Ribbon’s Home tab. (You
can also press Ctrl+V or right-click the upper-left cell and choose Paste
from the contextual menu.) If you don’t need to use any of the options in
the Paste Options Smart Tag, you can press Enter instead of using the
Paste button.
5. Press Esc to clear the copy operation and remove the Paste Options
Smart Tag. Note: This step isn’t necessary if you press Enter in Step 4.
See also “Copying a cell to another cell or a range,” earlier in this part.
If the location that you’re copying to isn’t too far away, you can follow these
steps:
1. Select the cell or range to copy.
2. Press and hold Ctrl.
Figure 4-1
Copying Cells and Ranges
51

3. Move the mouse pointer to any of the selection’s borders. The mouse
pointer changes to an arrow with a small plus sign.
4. Drag the mouse to the location where you want to copy the cell or range.
Excel displays an outline of the range as you drag with the mouse to help
you see where you’re going to paste the range.
5. Release the mouse button. Excel copies the cell or range to the new location.
Remember: If the mouse pointer doesn’t change to an arrow in Step 3, your drag-
and-drop feature is off. To turn on the drag-and-drop feature, follow these steps:
1. Click the Office button, and then click the Excel Options button. The Excel
Options dialog box appears with a list of option sections in the left pane.
2. Click the Advanced section.
3. Select the Enable Fill Handle and Cell Drag-and-Drop check box.
4. To prevent accidental overwriting of data in the destination range, select
the Alert before Overwriting Cells check box.
5. Click OK.
Copying data to another worksheet or workbook
To copy the contents of a cell or range to another worksheet or workbook,
follow these steps:
1. Select the cell or range that you want to copy.
2. Click the Copy button in the Ribbon’s Home tab. (You can also press
Ctrl+C or right-click the cell or range and choose Copy from the contex-
tual menu.)
3. Click the tab of the worksheet that you’re copying to. If the worksheet is
in a different workbook, activate that workbook (by clicking the View tab
on the Ribbon, clicking the Switch Windows button, and selecting the
workbook name from the menu) and then click the tab of the worksheet
that will hold the copied data.
4. Select the upper-left cell of the range that will hold the copy.
5. Click the top part of the Paste split button in the Ribbon’s Home tab. (You
can also press Ctrl+V or right-click the destination cell or range and
choose Paste from the contextual menu.)
6. Press Esc to complete the copy operation and remove the Paste Options
Smart Tag.
See also “Copying a cell to another cell or a range” and “Copying a range to
another range,” both earlier in this part.
52
Part 4: Entering and Editing Worksheet Data

Copying multiple cells or ranges to another range
To copy noncontiguous cells or ranges to a single range elsewhere in the work-
sheet, to a different worksheet in the same workbook, or to a range in a different
workbook, you can copy and paste each cell or range in turn to the new range.
However, Excel provides a simpler and less tedious method to perform this 
multiple-copy task. This method uses the Office Clipboard to copy multiple
data items before pasting the items. The Office Clipboard differs from the
Windows Clipboard in that the Windows Clipboard (which you use for copy-and-
paste operations in most Windows applications) can store only one data item at
a time.
The Office Clipboard can store 24 copied items. All Office applications share the
Office Clipboard (and the 24-item limit), enabling you to cut and paste multiple
items between Excel and other Office applications, such as Word and
PowerPoint.
To copy multiple cells or ranges to another range, follow these steps:
1. Select the Home tab on the Ribbon if it isn’t already selected and click the
Clipboard group dialog launcher button, on the right of the group con-
tainer. Excel displays the Clipboard task pane, as shown in Figure 4-2.
2. Select the first cell or range that you want to copy. (See “Selecting Cells
and Ranges,” later in this part.)
3. Click the Copy button in the Ribbon’s Home tab. (You can also press
Ctrl+C or right-click the cell or range and choose Copy from the contex-
tual menu.) Excel copies the data to the Office Clipboard. The Clipboard
task pane displays a portion of or all the copied data.
Figure 4-2
Copying Cells and Ranges
53

4. Select the next cell or range that you want to copy. (The cell or range can
be from the same worksheet, another worksheet in the same workbook, or
a worksheet in another open workbook.)
5. Repeat Steps 3 and 4 for all the remaining data that you want to copy.
6. Select the upper-left cell of the range that will hold the copied items.
7. Click the Paste All button in the Clipboard task pane. You can also click
individual items in the Clipboard task pane to paste a single item at a
time.
You can enable the Office Clipboard by setting the Clipboard task pane to
appear automatically after the second use of the Copy command. This option, if
set, eliminates Steps 1 and 2. To turn on this option, click the Options button at
the bottom of the Clipboard task pane and select the Show Office Clipboard
Automatically option.
Normally, you need to display the Clipboard task pane to enable the Office
Clipboard. If you prefer to use the Office Clipboard without displaying the
Clipboard task pane, click the Options button at the bottom of the Clipboard
task pane and select the Collect Without Showing Office Clipboard option.
Remember: You can use the Office Clipboard for multiple cut operations in addi-
tion to the multiple copy operations that we discuss in this section.
Deleting Entire Rows and Columns
In certain circumstances, you may want to delete entire rows or columns from
your worksheet. If you delete a row(s), the rows below the deleted row(s) shift
upward to fill the gap. If you delete a column(s), the columns to the right of the
deleted column(s) shift to the left to fill the gap.
To delete entire rows or columns, follow these steps:
1. Select the row header or column header of the row or column you want to
delete. See “Selecting entire rows and columns,” later in this part. Excel
selects the entire row or column.
2. Use any of the following methods to delete the row or column:
• Right-click the selected row or column and choose Delete from the
contextual menu.
• Press Ctrl+– (the minus sign).
• Click the upper portion of the Delete button in the Ribbon’s Home tab
(the portion above the button’s name).
54
Part 4: Entering and Editing Worksheet Data

Make sure that any cells that you want to keep aren’t in the rows or columns you
delete. You can zoom out in your worksheet to check for any cells that aren’t
normally visible on-screen. See also “Zooming a Worksheet,” in Part 3.
Editing the Contents of a Cell
After you enter information into a cell, you can edit it. To edit the contents of a
cell, use one of the following ways to get into cell-edit mode:
 Double-click the cell to edit the cell contents directly in the cell.
 Click the cell and press F2 to edit the cell contents directly in the cell.
 Click the cell that you want to edit; then click the formula bar to edit the
cell contents in the formula bar.
All these methods cause the formula bar to display two new mouse icons. The
following table describes these icons and what they do.
Icon
What It Does
Cancels editing, and the cell’s contents don’t change. (Pressing Esc has the same
effect.)
Confirms the editing and enters the modified contents into the cell. (Pressing Enter has
the same effect.)
Remember: If nothing happens after you double-click a cell, or if pressing F2 puts
the cursor in the formula bar instead of directly in the cell, the in-cell editing fea-
ture is turned off. To turn on in-cell editing, follow these steps:
1. Click the Office button, and then click the Excel Options button. The Excel
Options dialog box appears with a list of option sections in the left pane.
2. Click the Advanced section.
3. Select the Allow Editing Directly in the Cells check box.
4. Click OK.
If you’re editing a cell that contains a formula, the name box (at the extreme
left in the formula bar) displays a list of worksheet functions if you click the
downward-pointing arrow next to the box. You can select a function from the
list, and Excel provides assistance entering the arguments. The example in
Figure 4-3 shows the contents of cell A1 after you double-click the cell for 
editing.
Copying Cells and Ranges — Editing the Contents of a Cell
55

If you’re editing the contents of a cell (either directly in the cell or in the formula
bar), the cursor changes to a vertical bar; you can move the vertical bar by
using the direction keys. You can add new characters at the cursor’s location.
After you’re in edit mode, you can use any of the following keys or key combina-
tions to perform your edits:
 Left arrow/right arrow: Moves the cursor left or right one character,
respectively, without deleting any characters.
 Ctrl+left arrow/Ctrl+right arrow: Moves the cursor one group of charac-
ters to the left or right, respectively.
 Shift+left arrow/ Shift+right arrow: Selects characters to the left or right
of the cursor, respectively.
 Shift+Home: Selects from the cursor to the first character in the cell.
 Shift+End: Selects from the cursor to the last character in the cell.
 Backspace: Erases the character to the immediate left of the cursor.
 Delete: Erases the character to the right of the cursor or erases all selected
characters.
 Insert: Places Excel in OVR (overtype) mode. Rather than adding charac-
ters to the cell, you overtype, or replace, existing characters with new ones,
depending on the position of the cursor.
 Home: Moves the cursor to the beginning of the cell entry.
 End: Moves the cursor to the end of the cell entry.
 Enter: Accepts the edited data.
Remember: If you change your mind after editing a cell, you can click the Undo
button on the Quick Access toolbar (or press Ctrl+Z) to restore the cell’s pre-
vious contents.
You also can use the mouse to select characters while you’re editing a cell. Just
click and drag the mouse pointer over the characters that you want to select.
Remember: If the cell is locked and the worksheet is protected, you can’t make
any changes to the cell unless you unprotect the worksheet. See “Protecting a
Worksheet,” in Part 3.
Figure 4-3
56
Part 4: Entering and Editing Worksheet Data

Entering Data into a Range
Excel provides timesaving methods for you to enter data quickly in a range of
cells. These methods are particularly helpful if you need to enter a lot of data
manually.
Entering data into a specific range
If you’re entering data into a range of cells, you may want to select the entire
range of cells before you start entering data. This action causes Excel to move
the cell pointer to the next cell in the selection after you press Enter.
The procedure works as follows:
 If the selection consists of multiple rows, Excel moves down the column; after
it reaches the end of the column, it moves to the top of the next column.
 To skip a cell, press Enter without entering anything.
 To back up a row, press Shift+Enter. If you prefer to enter the data by rows
rather than by columns, press Tab. To back up a column, press Shift+Tab.
Entering the same data into a range of cells
If you need to enter the same data (value, text, or formula) into multiple cells,
your first inclination may be to enter it once and then copy it to the remaining
cells. The following steps show you a better way:
1. Select all the cells that you want to contain the data. (See “Selecting a
range,” later in this part.)
2. Enter the value, text, or formula into the active cell in the range. This cell
is already selected when you highlight the range.
3. Press Ctrl+Enter. Excel inserts the single entry into each cell in the 
selection.
Entering Dates and Times
Excel treats a date or a time as a value, but you format it to appear as a date or a
time. If you work with dates and times, you need to understand Excel’s date and
time system.
Excel’s system for working with dates uses a serial number system. The earliest
date that Excel understands is January 1, 1900 (which has a serial number of 1).
All other dates are counted from January 1, 1900. January 2, 1900 has a serial
Editing the Contents of a Cell — Entering Dates and Times
57

number of 2, January 1, 2007 has a serial number of 39083, and so on. Time is
represented as a fraction of a day. For example, January 1, 2007 at 12:00:00 pm
has a serial number of 39083.50. This system makes it easy to deal with dates
and times in formulas.
Entering specific dates and times
Normally, you don’t need to concern yourself with the Excel serial-number date
system. You can simply enter a date in a familiar format, and Excel takes care of
the details.
If you plan to use dates in formulas, make sure that the date you enter is one
that Excel recognizes as a date (that is, a value); otherwise, your formula pro-
duces incorrect results. Excel is quite smart in recognizing dates that you enter
into a cell, and it recognizes most common date formats. But it’s not perfect.
Excel interprets the following entries, for example, as text and not dates:
 June 1 2007
 Jun-1 2007
 Jun-1/2007
Remember: Excel uses a windowing approach for interpreting two-digit year
entries. That is, within a 100-year window, Excel interprets 1/1/29 as January 1,
2029. If you enter 1/1/30, Excel interprets it as January 1, 1930. To be safe, enter
the year as a four-digit value and then format it as you want.
The best way to deal with times is to enter the time into a cell in a recognized
format. The following table lists some examples of time formats that Excel 
recognizes.

Part 4: Entering and Editing Worksheet Data

Entering the current date or time
If you need to date-stamp or time-stamp a cell in your worksheet, Excel provides
the following two shortcut keys that perform this task for you:
 Current date: Press Ctrl+; (semicolon)
 Current time: Press Ctrl+Shift+; (semicolon)
Entering Formulas
A formula is a special type of cell entry that returns a result: After you enter a
formula into a cell, the cell displays the result of the formula. The formula itself
appears in the formula bar (which is just below the Ribbon) after you activate
the cell.
A formula begins with an equal sign (=) and can consist of any of the following
elements:
 Operators, such as + (for addition) and * (for multiplication)
 Cell references, including addresses such as B4 or C12, as well as named
cells and ranges
 Values and text
 Worksheet functions (such as SUM)
You can enter a formula into a cell in one of two ways: manually (by typing it in)
or by pointing to cell references. See also “Basic Formula Essentials,” in Part 5,
for more information on operators and operator precedence.
Entering formulas manually
To enter a formula manually, follow these steps:
1. Move the cell pointer (by clicking the cell with the mouse pointer or navi-
gating with the arrow keys) to the cell that you want to hold the formula.
2. Type an equal sign (=) to signal the fact that the cell contains a formula.
3. Type the formula and press Enter.
As you type, a drop-down list appears below the cell. This is Excel’s new
Formula AutoComplete feature. The feature tries to anticipate what you’re
typing and presents a list of matched items, as shown in Figure 4-4.
Entering Dates and Times — Entering Formulas
59

To select an item from the list, simply double-click the item or press the Tab key
and Excel inserts the item in the formula.
Here are some of the types of items that appear in the Formula AutoComplete
drop-down list:
 Excel built-in functions: All functions in the Excel library. See also “Entering
functions manually,” in Part 5.
 User-defined functions: Custom functions that supplement Excel’s built-in
functions through add-ins or through functions defined in the workbook
(using Excel’s macro language.) See also “Using Add-In Functions,” in Part 5.
 Defined names: All names you define in the workbook. See also Part 6,
“Creating and Using Names.”
You will notice that the characters you type appear in the cell as well as in the
formula bar. When entering a formula, you can use all the normal editing keys
(Delete, Backspace, direction keys, and so on).
As you enter a formula, Excel shows each cell reference in the formula in a dif-
ferent color. If the reference cells are visible on the worksheet, you see a border
around each cell in the same color as the cell reference in the formula. This fea-
ture makes it easier to identify the references of the cells you’re typing in your
formulas.
See also “Entering formulas by pointing,” immediately following in this section.
If you find the Formula AutoComplete feature distracting, or you simply want to
disable it temporarily, follow these steps to turn off the feature:
1. Click the Office button, and then click the Excel Options button. Excel 
displays the Excel Options dialog box with a list of option sections in the
left pane.
2. Click the Formulas section.
3. Click to clear the Formula AutoComplete check box.
4. Click OK.
Figure 4-4
60
Part 4: Entering and Editing Worksheet Data

Entering formulas by pointing
The pointing method of entering a formula still involves some manual typing.
The advantage is that you don’t need to type the cell or range references.
Instead, you point to them in the worksheet, which is usually more accurate and
less tedious.
The best way to explain this procedure is with an example. Follow these steps to
enter the formula =A1/A2 into cell A3 by using the pointing method:
1. In cell A1, type 12000 and press Enter.
2. Move the cell pointer to cell A3 (by clicking the cell or navigating with the
arrow keys). This cell is where you want the formula (and the result) to go.
3. Type an equal sign (=) to begin the formula.
4. Press the up-arrow key twice. As you press this key, notice that Excel 
displays a moving border around the reference cell (A1) and the cell 
reference appears in cell A3 and in the formula bar (see Figure 4-5).
Excel colors the cell reference in the formula and the moving border
around the reference cell (A1) with the same color.
5. Type a division sign (/). Excel now displays a solid-colored border around
the A1 cell reference.
6. Press the up-arrow key once. Excel adds A2 to the formula. Excel now dis-
plays a different color for the new cell reference in the formula and the
same color for the border of the new reference cell.
7. Press Enter to end the formula entry.
See also “Entering formulas manually,” earlier in this part.
Entering Text
You can use text in worksheets to serve as labels for values and headings for
columns, or to provide instructions about the worksheet. An entry of mixed 
text and numbers is still considered text. A cell can hold as many as 32,767 
characters.
Figure 4-5
Entering Formulas — Entering Text
61

Entering text into cells
To enter text (rather than a value or a formula) into a cell, follow these steps:
1. Move the cell pointer to the appropriate cell (by clicking the cell with the
mouse pointer or by navigating with the arrow keys).
2. Type the text.
3. Press Enter or any of the direction keys.
If you enter text that’s longer than the column’s current width, one of the follow-
ing happens:
 If the cells to the immediate right are blank, Excel displays the text in its
entirety, spilling the entry into adjacent cells.
 If an adjacent cell isn’t blank, Excel displays as much of the text as possi-
ble. (The cell contains the full text; it just doesn’t display all of it.)
In either case, you can always see the text (as you type it and after you type it)
because it appears in the formula bar as well as in the cell. In previous versions
of Excel, if you had text or a formula in a cell that exceeded the character width
of the formula bar, the formula bar would spill into the sheet to display the con-
tents of the cell, often obscuring column headers and sheet content.
In Excel 2007, the formula bar has its own space that never overlaps with the
worksheet grid. By default, the formula bar displays a cell’s contents on one line.
If the length of the cell contents exceeds the display capacity of a single line on
the formula bar, Excel adds scroll arrows on the formula bar, as shown in Figure
4-6. You can view multiple lines of a cell’s content on the formula bar (one line at
a time) by clicking the up or down scroll arrows. If you want to keep multiple
lines of a cell’s content in view on the formula bar, you can adjust the height of
the formula bar by dragging the resize bar at the bottom of the formula bar. As
you drag the resize bar downwards, the worksheet grid is pushed down to
accommodate the expanded formula bar. Clicking the Auto expand/collapse
button at the far right of the formula bar (or pressing Ctrl+Shift+U) toggles
between a single-line display and an expanded-line display (based on the last
drag setting.)
Figure 4-6
62
Part 4: Entering and Editing Worksheet Data

Remember: To display a long text entry that’s adjacent to a cell that contains an
entry, you can edit your text to make it shorter, increase the width of the
column, or wrap the text within the cell so that it occupies more than one line.
See also “Modifying Cell Size,” in Part 8.
Completing text entries by using AutoComplete
If you’re entering a lot of repeated text entries into a column, AutoComplete can
help you speed up the process. AutoComplete enables you to type the first few
letters of a text entry into a cell, and Excel automatically completes the entry
based on other entries you’ve already made in the column. Your column entries
must be contiguous (that is, have no blank cells between entries). AutoComplete
doesn’t work with entries in a row.
AutoComplete works with no effort on your part; just follow these steps:
1. Begin entering text or a value. If Excel recognizes your entry, it automati-
cally completes it.
2. If Excel guesses correctly, press Enter to accept it. To enter something
else instead, just continue typing and ignore Excel’s guess.
You can access this feature also by right-clicking the cell and choosing Pick from
Drop-down List. If you use this method, Excel displays a list of all the entries in the
current column. Just click the one you want, and Excel enters it automatically.
Remember: AutoComplete works only with pure text or mixed text (text and
values); it doesn’t work with pure values.
Entering Values
Values, also known as numbers, represent a quantity of some type: revenue,
number of units, test scores, and so on. Values can stand on their own, or you
can use the values you enter into cells as part of a formula or in creating a chart.
Excel’s numbers are precise up to 15 significant digits. If you enter a larger
number, Excel stores it with only 15 digits of precision.
Entering values into cells
To enter a numeric value into a cell, follow these steps:
1. Move the cell pointer to the appropriate cell (by clicking the mouse
pointer in the cell or by navigating with the arrow keys).
2. Enter the value.
3. Press Enter, Tab, or any of the direction keys. The value is displayed in the
cell and also appears in the formula bar.
Entering Text — Entering Values
63

You can also include a decimal point, dollar sign, plus sign, minus sign, and
comma. If you precede a value with a minus sign or enclose it in parentheses,
Excel considers the value a negative number.
Remember: Sometimes the value doesn’t appear exactly as you enter it. Excel
may convert very large numbers to scientific notation. The formula bar, how-
ever, always displays the value that you originally entered.
Entering fractions
To enter a fraction into a cell, leave a space between the whole number part and
the fractional part. To enter the decimal equivalent of 67⁄8, for example, follow
these steps:
1. Type 6.
2. Type a space.
3. Type 7/8.
4. Press Enter. Excel enters 6.875 into the cell and automatically formats the
cell as a fraction. See also “Formatting a Number,” in Part 8.
If the value has no whole number part (for example, 1⁄8), you must enter a zero
and a space first, as follows: 0 1/8 — otherwise, Excel interprets the entry as
January 8 of the current year.
Erasing Data in Cells and Ranges
To erase the contents of a cell but leave the cell’s formatting and cell comments
intact, perform the following two steps:
1. Select the cell or range that you want to erase. (See “Selecting Cells and
Ranges,” later in this part, for details.)
2. Press Delete.
For more control over what you delete, click the Clear button in the Ribbon’s
Home tab and select an option from the menu. The menu contains the follow-
ing four choices:
 All: Clears everything from the cell.
 Formats: Clears only the formatting and leaves the value, text, or formula.
 Contents: Clears only the cell’s contents and leaves the formatting.
 Comments: Clears the comment attached to the cell (if a comment exists).
64
Part 4: Entering and Editing Worksheet Data

Filling a Series
Excel provides an AutoFill feature, which enables you to fill in several types of
data series in a row or column. AutoFill uses the fill handle — the small square
that appears at the bottom-right corner of the selected cell or range.
Excel provides an AutoFill Options Smart Tag next to the fill handle after you
drag the fill handle to a new location. Click the AutoFill Options Smart Tag to 
display a list of commonly used fill options, such as Copy Cells, Fill Series, Fill
Formatting Only, and Fill Without Formatting (see Figure 4-7).
Remember: If the selected cell or range doesn’t have a fill handle, it means the
AutoFill feature is turned off. To turn on the feature, follow these steps:
1. Click the Office button, and then click the Excel Options button. Excel dis-
plays the Excel Options dialog box with a list of option sections in the left
pane.
2. Click the Advanced section.
3. Select the Enable Fill Handle and Cell Drag-and-Drop check box.
4. Click OK.
Remember: You can’t use AutoFill if you make a multiple selection.
Entering a series of incremental values or dates
To use AutoFill to enter a series of incremental values, follow these steps:
1. Enter at least two values or dates in the series into adjacent cells. These
values need not be consecutive.
2. Select the cells that you used in Step 1. (See “Selecting a range,” later in
this part, for details.)
Figure 4-7
Entering Values — Filling a Series
65

3. Click and drag the fill handle to complete the series in the cells that you
select. As you drag the fill handle, Excel displays a small box that tells you
what it’s planning to enter into each cell.
Remember: After you complete the drag operation, Excel displays the Auto Fill
Options Smart Tag. You can click the Smart Tag to select a different fill option.
For even more control, drag the fill handle while pressing the right mouse
button. After you release the button, you see a list of options.
AutoFill also works in the negative direction. If you use AutoFill by starting with
two cells that contain –20 and –19, for example, Excel fills in –18, –17, and so on.
If the values in the cells that you enter don’t have equal increments, Excel com-
pletes the series by calculating a simple linear regression. This feature is handy
for performing simple forecasts. Note: Excel calculates a simple linear regression
or progression, depending on the direction (negative or positive) of the series.
Entering a series of text
Excel is familiar with some text series (days of the week, months of the year),
and it can complete these series for you automatically.
Follow these steps to use AutoFill to complete a known series of text:
1. Enter any of the series into a cell (for example, Monday or February).
2. Click and drag the fill handle to complete the series in the cells that you
select.
You can also teach Excel to recognize custom series that work with AutoFill. 
See “Sorting based on a custom sort order,” in Part 11.
Inserting Entire Rows and Columns
If you insert new rows or columns in Excel, the program places blank rows or
columns in the worksheet, and surrounding rows or columns move out to
accommodate the new rows or columns.
To insert new rows or columns in your worksheet, follow these steps:
In certain circumstances, you may want to delete entire rows or columns from
your worksheet. If you delete a row(s), the rows below the deleted row(s) shift
upward to fill the gap. If you delete a column(s), the columns to the right of the
deleted column(s) shift to the left to fill the gap.
To delete entire rows or columns, follow these steps:
66
Part 4: Entering and Editing Worksheet Data

1. Select the row header or column header of the row or column you want to
delete. See also “Selecting entire rows and columns,” later in this part.
Excel selects the entire row or column.
2. Use any of the following methods to insert the row or column:
• Right-click the selected row or column and choose Insert from the con-
textual menu.
• Press Ctrl+Shift++ (the plus sign on the top row of keys) or Ctrl++ 
(the plus sign on the numeric keypad).
• Click the upper or left portion of the Insert split button in the Ribbon’s
Home tab (at lower screen resolutions, the button is smaller and you
click the left side).
Moving Cells and Ranges
Moving the data in a cell or a range is common. You may, for example, need to
relocate a range of data to make room for something else.
Moving data to a new location in the same worksheet
Follow these steps to move a cell or range:
1. Select the cell or range to move. (See “Selecting Cells and Ranges,” later in
this part, for details.)
2. Click the Cut button in the Ribbon’s Home tab. (You can also press Ctrl+X
or right-click the cell or range and choose Cut from the contextual menu.)
3. Move the cell pointer to the range that will hold the copy (by clicking the
cell or by navigating with the arrow keys). You need to select only the
upper-left cell in the range.
4. Press Enter.
If the range that you’re moving contains formulas that refer to other cells, the
references continue to refer to the original cells. You almost always want refer-
ences to continue to refer to the original cells.
If the location that you’re moving to isn’t too far away, you can follow these steps:
1. Select the cell or range to move. (See “Selecting Cells and Ranges,” later in
this part.)
2. Move the mouse pointer to any of the selection’s borders. The mouse
pointer changes to an arrow with a small directional cross at its tip.
3. Drag the mouse to the location where you want to move the cell or range.
Filling a Series — Moving Cells and Ranges
67

4. Release the mouse button. Excel moves the cell or range to the new location.
If you press and hold Shift while dragging, Excel performs a move and an insert
paste in a single operation, without use of the Insert dialog box. The Insert paste
operation allows you to insert the cell or range inside another range.
Remember: If you change your mind after Step 2, press Esc to cancel the oper-
ation. If you change your mind after you move the data, you can click the
Undo button on the Quick Access Toolbar or press Ctrl+Z.
Remember: If the mouse pointer doesn’t change to an arrow in Step 2, your drag-
and-drop feature is off. To turn on the drag-and-drop feature, follow these steps:
1. Click the Office button, and then click the Excel Options button. The Excel
Options dialog box appears with a list of option sections in the left pane.
2. Click the Advanced section.
3. Select the Enable Fill Handle and Cell Drag-and-Drop check box.
4. To prevent accidental overwriting of data in destination range, select the
Alert before Overwriting Cells check box.
5. Click OK.
If you move data, make sure that you have enough blank cells to hold it. Excel
overwrites existing data without warning.
Moving data to a different worksheet or workbook
If you want to move the contents of a cell or range to a different worksheet or to
a different workbook, follow these steps:
1. Select the cell or range to move. (See “Selecting Cells and Ranges,” later in
this part, for details.)
2. Click the Cut button in the Ribbon’s Home tab. (You can also press Ctrl+X
or right-click the cell or range and choose Cut from the contextual menu.)
3. Activate the worksheet you’re moving to by clicking the sheet tab. If
you’re moving the selection to a sheet on a different workbook, activate
that workbook first by clicking the Switch Windows button on the
Ribbon’s View tab and selecting the workbook from the menu. (You can
select a different workbook also by selecting the workbook name on the
Windows taskbar below the Excel window.) After you activate the work-
book, select the destination worksheet for the data.
4. Move the cell pointer to the range that will hold the copy (by clicking the
cell or by navigating with the arrow keys). You only need to select the
upper-left cell in the range.
5. Press Enter.
68
Part 4: Entering and Editing Worksheet Data

After you move data, make sure that you have enough blank cells to hold it.
Excel overwrites existing data without warning.
Remember: If you change your mind after Step 2, press Esc to cancel the oper-
ation. If you change your mind after you move the data, you can click the
Undo button on the Quick Access Toolbar or press Ctrl+Z.
Replacing the Contents of a Cell
To replace the contents of a cell with something else, follow these steps:
1. Select the cell. (See “Selecting a cell,” later in this part, for details.)
2. Type your new entry. (It replaces the previous contents.)
Remember: Any formatting that you applied to the cell remains.
Searching for Data to Replace
Sometimes you may need to replace all occurrences of a value or text with
something else. If your worksheet contains lots of data, you may find locating a
particular piece of information difficult. A quick way to find something is to have
Excel do it for you.
To replace all occurrences of a value or text with something else:
1. Click the Find & Select button in the Ribbon’s Home tab and choose
Replace from the menu. (Alternatively, press Ctrl+H.) Excel displays its
Find and Replace dialog box with the Replace tab selected, as shown in
Figure 4-8.
2. In the Find What drop-down list, enter the text or value to search for.
3. If you want to search for data with specific formatting:
a. Click the Format button to the right of the Find What drop-down list. If
the Format button isn’t visible, click the Options button. Excel dis-
plays the Find Format dialog box.
b. Select the appropriate tabs, and in each tab, specify the formatting
that you’re looking for.
c. After you complete your selections, click OK to exit the Find Format
dialog box.
Moving Cells and Ranges — Searching for Data to Replace
69

If a cell in your worksheet already contains all the formatting you want to
use in your search, click the arrow on the Format button to the right of
the Find What drop-down list and select Choose Format From Cell. Excel
adds an eyedropper icon to the cursor. Click the cell that has the format-
ting you require.
4. In the Replace With drop-down list, enter the text or value that should
replace the text or value from Step 2.
5. If you want to specify new formatting for the replaced characters, click
the Format button to the right of the Replace With drop-down list box and
follow the procedure outlined in Step 3.
6. In the Within drop-down list box, select whether you want to look in the
active sheet or the entire workbook for the information that you typed in
Step 2. If the Within drop-down box isn’t visible, click the Options button.
7. To have Excel search and replace all occurrences automatically, click the
Replace All button. To verify each replacement instead, click the Find Next
button. Excel pauses after it finds a match. To replace the found text, click
Replace. To skip it and find the next match, click the Find Next button
again. Click the Find All button to select a match from the drop-down
window.
8. Click the Close button after you finish finding and replacing the text.
See also “Finding Specific Data,” in Part 7.
Selecting Cells and Ranges
In Excel, you normally select a cell or range before performing an operation that
works with the cell or range. Topics in this section describe how to make vari-
ous types of cell and range selections.
Figure 4-8
70
Part 4: Entering and Editing Worksheet Data

Selecting a cell
To select a cell (and make it the active cell), use any of the following techniques:
 Use the arrow keys to move the cell pointer to the cell.
 Click the cell with the mouse pointer.
 Click the Find & Select button in the Ribbon’s Home tab and choose Go To
from the menu (or press F5 or Ctrl+G), enter the cell address in the
Reference text box of the Go To dialog box that appears, and click OK.
The selected cell now has a dark border around it, and its address appears in
the name box.
Selecting a range
You can select a range in any of the following ways:
 Click the mouse in a cell and drag to highlight the range. If you drag past
the end of the screen, the worksheet scrolls.
 Move to the first cell of the range. Press F8, and then move the cell pointer
with the direction keys to highlight the range. Press F8 again to return the
arrow keys to normal movement.
 Press Shift as you use the arrow keys to select a range.
 Click the Find & Select button in the Ribbon’s Home tab and choose Go To
from the menu (or press F5 or Ctrl+G), enter a range’s address in the
Reference text box of the Go To dialog box that appears, and click OK.
Selecting noncontiguous ranges
Most of the time, the ranges that you select are contiguous — they are a single
rectangle of cells. Excel also enables you to work with noncontiguous ranges,
which consist of two or more ranges (or single cells) that aren’t necessarily next
to each other (also known as a multiple selection).
To apply the same formatting to cells in different areas of your worksheet, for
example, one approach is to make a multiple selection. After you select the
appropriate cells or ranges, Excel applies the formatting that you choose to all
the selected cells. Figure 4-9 shows two noncontiguous ranges (B2:F2 and B6:F6)
that have been selected.
You can select a noncontiguous range in any of the following ways:
 Drag the mouse to select the first range, then press and hold Ctrl as you
drag the mouse to select the other ranges.
Searching for Data to Replace — Selecting Cells and Ranges 71

 From the keyboard, select the first range by pressing F8 and then using the
arrow keys. After selecting the first range, press Shift+F8, move the cell
pointer using the arrow keys, and press F8 to start selecting another range.
 Click the Find & Select button in the Ribbon’s Home tab, choose Go To
from the menu (or press F5 or Ctrl+G), and enter a range’s address in the
Reference text box of the Go To dialog box that appears. Separate the dif-
ferent ranges with a comma. Click OK, and Excel selects the cells in the
ranges that you specify.
Selecting entire rows and columns
You can select entire rows or columns in any of the following ways:
 Click the row or column heading to select a single row or column.
 To select multiple adjacent rows or columns, click a row or column head-
ing and drag to highlight additional rows or columns.
 To select multiple (nonadjacent) rows or columns, press Ctrl as you click
the row or column headings that you want.
 Press Ctrl+spacebar to select the column of the active cell or the columns
of the selected range.
 Press Shift+spacebar to select the row of the active cell or the rows of the
selected cells.
 Either click the Select All button at the intersection of the row and column
headers or press Ctrl+A or press Ctrl+Shift+spacebar to select all rows.
Selecting all rows is the same as selecting all columns, which is the same as
selecting all cells.
Selecting a multisheet (3-D) range
An Excel workbook can contain more than one worksheet, and a range can
extend across multiple worksheets. You can think of these as three-dimensional
ranges.
Figure 4-9
72
Part 4: Entering and Editing Worksheet Data

To select a multisheet range, follow these steps:
1. Select a cell or range on the active sheet. See “Selecting a range,” earlier in
this part.
2. Group the sheets that will be in the range. See “Grouping and Ungrouping
Worksheets,” in Part 3.
After you select a multisheet range, you can perform the same operations that
you can perform on a single sheet range. Any changes you make to one sheet
(formatting, entering or editing data, and so on) are reflected in the other sheets.
Transposing a Range
If you need to change the orientation of a range, Excel can do it for you in a
snap. If you transpose a range, rows become columns and columns become
rows. Figure 4-10 shows an example of a horizontal range that we transposed to
a vertical range.
To transpose a range, follow these steps:
1. Select the range to transpose. (See “Selecting a range,” earlier in this part,
for details.)
2. Click the Copy button in the Ribbon’s Home tab. (You can also press Ctrl+C
or right-click the cell or range and choose Copy from the contextual menu.)
3. Click the upper-left cell where you want the transposed range to go. The
transposed range can’t overlap the original range.
4. Click the bottom half of the Paste split button (the part with the downward
arrow) in the Ribbon’s Home tab and choose Transpose from the menu.
5. Delete the original range, if necessary.
Figure 4-10
Selecting Cells and Ranges — Transposing a Range
73

Remember: Excel adjusts any formulas in the original range so that they work
correctly after you transpose them.
Undoing Changes and Mistakes
One very useful feature in Excel is its multilevel Undo feature. This feature
means that you can reverse your recent actions, one step at a time. If you dis-
cover that you accidentally deleted a range of data several minutes ago, for
example, you can use the Undo feature to backtrack through your actions until
the deleted range reappears.
To undo an operation, use any of the following techniques:
 Click the Undo button on the Quick Access toolbar until you arrive at
the action that you want to undo.
 Press Ctrl+Z until you arrive at the action that you want to undo.
 Click the arrow on the Undo button on the Quick Access toolbar. This
action displays a description of your recent actions. Select the actions that
you want to undo.
In Excel 2007 you can undo a maximum of 100 operations. In earlier versions of
Excel, you can undo a maximum of 16 operations.
Validating Data Entry
You can specify the type of data that a cell can accept. If you develop a spread-
sheet that others use, for example, you can limit the range of values that a user
may enter into input cells. Excel then validates the input to ensure that the
values the user enters fall within the range you specified. Excel displays an error
message if a user enters an invalid value.
To specify data-entry validation criteria, follow these steps:
1. Select the cell or range that you want to validate. (See “Selecting Cells and
Ranges,” earlier in this part, for details.)
2. Click the Data tab on the Ribbon and click the upper portion of Data
Validation split button (the portion above the button label) or click the
lower portion of the button and choose Data Validation from the menu.
Excel displays the Data Validation dialog box.
3. Click the Settings tab, and specify the type of data that the cell should
have by selecting an entry from the Allow drop-down list box and the Data
drop-down list box, if applicable.
74
Part 4: Entering and Editing Worksheet Data

To limit the entry in a cell to whole numbers between 100 and 200, for
example, select Whole Number in the Allow drop-down list box, select
Between in the Data drop-down box, enter 100 in the Minimum text box,
and enter 200 in the Maximum text box.
4. To specify a message to appear after a user clicks an input cell, click the
Input Message tab and type a message in the Input Message text box. If
you want a title to appear at the top of the message, enter a title in the
Title text box.
Following the example that we gave in Step 3, you might type the message
Enter a value between 100 and 200, which appears after the user clicks
the cell.
5. To specify a custom error message to appear in a dialog box if someone
enters invalid data, click the Error Alert tab and type a message in the
Error Message text box. If you want a title to appear at the top of the mes-
sage, enter a title in the Title text box.
Following the example that we gave in Step 3, you might type the message
Please enter a value between 100 and 200, which appears in a dialog box
if the user enters invalid data in a cell.
Choose a style for the error message from the Style drop-down list box
(Stop, Warning, or Information). Each style that you select displays an
error icon and various buttons on the error dialog box as follows:
• Stop: Displays Retry and Cancel buttons.
• Warning: Displays Yes, No, and Cancel buttons. (Clicking Yes enters the
invalid data.)
• Information: Displays OK and Cancel buttons. (Clicking OK enters the
invalid data.)
6. Click OK.
If you subsequently want to remove the validation criteria from a cell or range,
select the cell or range, click the upper portion of the Data Validation split
button in the Ribbon’s Data tab, and click the Clear All button in the Data
Validation dialog box that appears.
Remember: If you don’t specify a message in Step 5, Excel uses a default message
if a data-entry error occurs.
You can combine data validation with worksheet protection to permit only vali-
dated input cells to be altered. See “Protecting a Worksheet,” in Part 3.

Part 4: Entering and Editing Worksheet Data

Using Formulas and
Functions
This part deals with topics related to formulas and functions. Formulas make
using spreadsheets valuable by allowing you to calculate results from data stored
in the worksheet. Functions are built-in or custom tools used in formulas. They
can make your formulas perform powerful feats and save you a great deal of time.

Part 5

Absolute, Relative, and Mixed References
If you copy a formula containing an absolute reference, Excel doesn’t adjust the
reference in the copied cell. (An absolute reference uses two dollar signs in its
address, one for the column part and one for the row part.) On the other hand,
Excel adjusts relative references as you copy the formula.
Excel also enables you to use mixed references, in which only one of the
address’s parts is absolute. The following table summarizes all the possible
types of cell references.
Type
Example
Relative reference
A1
Absolute reference
$A$1
Mixed reference (column part is absolute)
$A1
Mixed reference (row part is absolute)
A$1
To change the type of cell reference in a formula, follow these steps:
1. Double-click the cell containing the formula (or press F2) to get into Edit
mode.
2. In the cell or formula bar, click the mouse pointer on the cell reference.
3. Press F4 repeatedly to cycle through all possible cell reference types. Stop
after the cell reference displays the correct type.
4. Press Enter to complete the operation.
Basic Formula Essentials
In Excel 2007, a formula can consist of up to 8,192 characters (up from 1,024
characters in earlier versions) and any of the following elements:
 Operators such as + (for addition) and * (for multiplication)
 Cell references (including named cells and ranges)
 Values, text, or logical values
 Worksheet functions (such as SUM or AVERAGE)
After you enter a formula into a cell, the cell displays the result of the formula.
You see the formula itself in the formula bar as the cell activates. (The formula
bar lies below the Ribbon.)
78
Part 5: Using Formulas and Functions

Operator precedence is the set of rules that Excel uses to perform its calculations
in a formula.
The following table provides the list of operators that you can use in formulas
and indicates each operator’s precedence.
Operator
Name
Precedence
^
Exponentiation (raised to a power)
1
*
Multiplication
2
/
Division

3
–
Subtraction
3
&
Concatenation (joins text)
4
=
Equal to
5
>
Greater than
5
<
Less than
5
The table shows that exponentiation has the highest precedence (that is, Excel
performs it first), and logical comparisons have the lowest precedence. If two
operators have the same precedence, Excel performs the calculations from left
to right.
Remember: You can override operator precedence by using parentheses in your
formulas. In the formula =(Income–Expenses)*TaxRate, for example, Expenses
are subtracted from Income, and the result is multiplied by TaxRate.
Changing When Formulas Are Calculated
If the Excel calculation mode is set to automatic (the default), changing cells that
you use in a formula causes the formula to display a new result automatically.
To set the Excel calculation mode to manual, click the Formulas tab on the
Ribbon, click the Options button in the Calculation group, and choose Manual
from the menu.
Remember: If you’re working in manual calculation mode, Excel displays
Calculate in the status bar if you have any uncalculated formulas. Do the fol-
lowing to recalculate the formulas:
 Click the Formulas tab on the Ribbon and click the Calculate Now button
in the Calculation group or press F9. The formulas in all open workbooks
are immediately calculated.
Absolute, Relative, and Mixed References — Changing When Formulas Are Calculated 79

 Click the Formulas tab on the Ribbon and click the Calculate Sheet button in
the Calculation group or press Shift+F9. The formulas in the active worksheet
only are immediately calculated. Other worksheets in the same workbook
aren’t calculated.
Remember: The Excel calculation mode isn’t specific to a particular worksheet. If
you change the calculation mode, that change affects all open workbooks and
not just the active workbook.
To return to automatic calculation mode, click the Formulas tab on the Ribbon,
click the Options button in the Calculation group, and choose Automatic from
the menu.
Converting Formulas to Values
Sometimes, you may want to convert a formula to its current value (remove the
formula and leave only its result). For example, want may want to prevent future
changes to the value of a cell if other cells that the formula references change.
To convert a formula to its current value, follow these steps:
1. Select the cell that contains the formula. To convert several formulas, you
can select a range.
2. Click the Copy button on the Ribbon’s Home tab. (You can also press
Ctrl+C or right-click the cell and choose Copy from the contextual menu.)
3. Click the bottom part of the Paste button on the Ribbon’s Home tab (the
part with the downward pointing arrow) and choose Paste Values from
the menu.
4. Press Enter or Esc to cancel Copy mode.
Remember: The preceding procedure overwrites the formulas. To put the current
values of the formulas in a different (empty) area of the worksheet, select a dif-
ferent cell or range before Step 3.
Editing Functions in Formulas
After you create a formula with one or more functions, you may want to modify
the arguments in one of the functions later. Excel provides several ways for you
to modify a function. The method you choose depends on personal choice and
the complexity of the function.
80
Part 5: Using Formulas and Functions

Use any of the following techniques to modify a function:
 If your formula contains only one function or if the function you want
to modify is the last one in the formula, click the Insert Function button
on the formula bar (or in the Formulas tab of the Ribbon), or press
Shift+F3 to display the Insert Function dialog box for the function.
 If your formula contains more than one function, press F2 or double-click
the formula cell. Position the cursor within the function that you want to
modify and click the Insert Function button, or press Shift+F3.
 The most efficient way to modify simple functions (that is, those with few
arguments) is to do so manually. Excel provides a ScreenTip (floating text)
for the function to help you identify the names and order of the function’s
arguments.
See also “Entering Functions in Formulas,” immediately following this section.
Entering Functions in Formulas
Excel provides more than 300 built-in functions that can make your formulas
perform powerful feats and save you a great deal of time. Functions perform the
following tasks:
 Simplify your formulas
 Enable formulas to perform calculations that are otherwise impossible
 Enable conditional execution of formulas — giving them some rudimentary
decision-making capability
Most worksheet functions use one or more arguments, enclosed in parentheses.
Think of an argument as a piece of information that clarifies what you want the
function to do. For example, the following function (which rounds the number in
cell A1 to two decimal places) uses two arguments:
=ROUND(A1,2)
Remember: You can nest a function within another function. The formula
=SUM(MAX(B1:B6),ROUND(A1,2)), for example, nests the MAX and ROUND func-
tions in the SUM function.
See also “Editing Functions in Formulas,” immediately preceding this section.
Changing When Formulas Are Calculated — Entering Functions in Formulas
81

Entering functions manually
Even if you’re not familiar with the function that you want to use, you can begin
typing the function name and Excel’s Formula AutoComplete feature will drop-
down a list of possible matches, as shown in Figure 5-1.
If you continue typing without selecting a name from the list, Excel narrows the
available choices. If you want to select a function name from the list, you can
either double-click with the mouse or highlight the name (using the mouse or
arrow keys) and press the Tab key. Excel inserts the function in the formula and
includes an opening parenthesis.
Excel provides assistance for the functions in the drop-down list in the form of
ScreenTips (see Figure 5-1.) Each ScreenTip provides a brief description of the
function’s use.
Excel provides you with further assistance after you type the entire function
name manually (including the opening parenthesis) or you select the function
from the drop-down list. This assistance enables you to determine the number
and order of arguments in the function. Excel displays a ScreenTip below the
function you’re typing. The ScreenTip includes the name of the function you
typed followed by the names of all the function’s mandatory and optional argu-
ments in parentheses. To display a Help window for the function, click the func-
tion name in the ScreenTip.
See also “Entering formulas manually,” in Part 4.
Using the AutoSum tool
The AutoSum tool provides a quick method for you to enter some functions that
you commonly use.
To use the AutoSum tool, follow these steps:
1. Click a cell below or to the right of a range of numbers.
Figure 5-1
82
Part 5: Using Formulas and Functions

2. Perform one of the following actions:
• To sum the range, click the AutoSum button in the Ribbon’s Home tab or
Formulas tab. Excel places a marquee around cells that it thinks you want
to sum. If the range of cells that the marquee surrounds isn’t the range
that you want to sum, use the mouse to highlight a new range. Click the
AutoSum button again or press Enter to complete the operation.
• To find the average, count, minimum, or maximum of the range, click
the arrow on the AutoSum button to display a menu for selecting these
operations. Click the operation that you want to perform from the
menu, and follow the procedure that we describe for summing the
range after Excel places the marquee around the cells.
Excel automatically places a marquee around the first region that it encounters
above or to the left of the formula cell. A region is a range that contains non-
blank cells. To select multiple regions as you use the AutoSum tool in Step 2,
press and hold Ctrl while dragging the mouse over each region. See also
“Selecting Cells and Ranges,” in Part 4.
Using the Function Library
The Function Library enables you to easily enter a function and its arguments.
The Function Library is particularly useful if you’re not sure of the function
you’re looking for and want to browse through the available choices. To make it
easier to find what you’re looking for, Excel groups the available functions into
well-known categories, such as financial and text.
To enter a function by using the Function Library, follow these steps:
1. Activate the cell that will contain the function. If you’re inserting the func-
tion into an existing formula, click the formula at the position where you
want to insert the function.
2. If you’re inserting a new function adjacent to another function in a for-
mula, you must add an operator (for example, +, –, or *) at this point to
delimit the two functions.
3. Click the Formulas tab on the Ribbon and click a function category in the
Function Library group. You can click the More Functions button if the
category you want is not shown in the Functions Library group.
4. Choose a function that you want from the menu. Excel displays the
Function Arguments dialog box, as shown in Figure 5-2. The Function
Arguments dialog box prompts you for each argument of the function that
you select. You can enter the arguments manually, or you can point to
them in the worksheet if they’re cell references. The Function Arguments
dialog box displays the result.
Entering Functions in Formulas
83

To get help with the function, click Help on This Function in the Function
Arguments dialog box. Excel displays the Help window for the function.
5. After you specify all the required arguments, click OK.
Modifying a Range Reference Used in a Function
If you edit a cell that contains a formula, Excel color-codes the references in the
formula and places an outline around each cell or range that the formula refer-
ences. The color of the outline corresponds to the color that appears in the for-
mula. Each outlined cell or range also contains fill handles (a small square in
each corner of the outlined cell or range). See Figure 5-3.
Fill handles
Outline in color
Figure 5-3
Figure 5-2
84
Part 5: Using Formulas and Functions

If your formula contains a function that uses a range argument, you can easily
modify the range reference by following these steps:
1. To begin editing the formula, press F2 or double-click the cell. See also
“Editing the Contents of a Cell,” in Part 4.
2. Locate the range that the function uses. (The range appears with an 
outline.)
3. Drag a fill handle to extend or contract the range. You can also click a
border of the outlined range and move the outline to a new range. In
either case, Excel changes the range reference in the formula.
4. Press Enter.
Remember: Formulas that contain name references place a colored outline
around the named cell or range. The outline doesn’t provide fill handles, how-
ever, or enable you to move this type of reference by clicking a border of the
outline.
Referencing Cells or Ranges in Other Worksheets
If your formula needs to refer to a cell in a different worksheet in the same work-
book, use the following format for your formula:
SheetName!CellAddress
Remember: If the worksheet name in the reference includes one or more spaces,
you must enclose it in single quotation marks. The following is a formula that
refers to a cell on a sheet by the name of All Depts:
=A1*’All Depts’!A1
An easy way to enter a range reference on another worksheet is by pointing with
the mouse. See “Entering formulas by pointing,” in Part 4.
If you need to reference a 3-D range in a function, enter the range in the follow-
ing format:
=FunctionName(FirstSheet:LastSheet!RangeReference)
For example:
=SUM(Sheet2:Sheet4!$A$1:$A$10)
Entering Functions in Formulas — Referencing Cells or Ranges in Other Worksheets 85

The following rules apply to 3-D range references:
 The range includes all sheets between the first and last sheet names in the
reference, inclusive.
 If you insert another sheet between the first and last sheets, it will be
included in the reference automatically.
 You can use absolute or relative references in the range reference.
 You can use any valid names for the sheets, but if any name has a space,
you must use single quotes to enclose the names in the reference. For
example:
=SUM(‘Dept Engineering:Dept HR’!$A$1:$A$10)
Remember: Less than 10 percent of Excel’s functions support 3-D range refer-
ences and those that do fall mostly in the statistical category.
You can point with the mouse to create a 3-D reference. First position the mouse
in the function where the reference will be placed. Then select the cell or range
in the first worksheet that will be included in the reference. Next, press and hold
Shift and click the sheet tab of the last sheet in the reference. Press Enter to
complete the procedure.
86
Part 5: Using Formulas and Functions

Creating and Using
Names
Dealing with cryptic cell and range addresses can be confusing. Fortunately,
Excel enables you to assign descriptive names to cells and ranges. For example,
you can name a cell InterestRate or name a range JulySales.

Part 6

Advantages to Naming Cells and Ranges
Using names for cells and ranges offers the following advantages:
 A meaningful range name (such as Income) is much easier to remember
than a range address (such as A1:A21).
 After you select a named cell or range, its name appears in the name box.
 You can quickly move to a named area of your worksheet by choosing a
name in the name box.
 Creating formulas is easier, because you can paste a cell or range name
into a formula.
 Names make your formulas more understandable and easier to use. For
example, =Income–Taxes is more intuitive than =D20–D40.
Although Excel is flexible about the names that you can define, it does have the
following rules:
 Names must begin with a letter or the underscore character (_).
 Names can’t contain any spaces. You may want to use an underscore or a
period character to simulate a space (such as Annual_Total or
Annual.Total).
 You can use any combination of letters and numbers, but the name must
not begin with a number (such as 3rdQuarter) or look like a cell reference
(such as Q3).
 You can’t use most symbols. You can, however, use the underscore (_),
period (.), backslash (\), and question mark (?).
 Names can be no more than 255 characters long.
Excel also reserves a few names internally for its own use. Avoid using the fol-
lowing for names: Print_Area, Print_Titles, Consolidate_Area, and
Sheet_Title.
Applying Names to Existing Cell References
If you create a new name for a cell or a range, Excel doesn’t automatically use
the name in place of existing references in your formulas. For example, if you
have a formula such as =A1*20 and then give a name to cell A1, the formula con-
tinues to display A1 (not the new name). Replacing cell or range references with
their corresponding names, however, is fairly easy.
88
Part 6: Creating and Using Names

To apply names to cell references in existing formulas, follow these steps:
1. Select the range with the formulas that you want to modify.
2. Click the Formulas tab on the Ribbon, click the arrow on the Define Name
button, and choose Apply Names from the menu. Excel displays the Apply
Names dialog box, as shown in Figure 6-1.
3. Select the names that you want to apply by clicking them in turn.
4. Click OK. Excel replaces the range references with the names in the
selected cells.
If you select a nonformula cell in Step 1, Excel applies the names to all applica-
ble formulas in the worksheet.
Creating Names
Excel provides several useful methods for creating names. The method you
choose depends on personal preference and techniques that may allow you to
save time.
Creating a name using the New Name dialog box
To create a range name using the New Name dialog box, follow these steps:
1. Select the cell or range that you want to name.
2. Click the Formulas tab on the Ribbon and then click the Define Name
button (or right-click the range and choose Name a Range from the con-
textual menu). Excel displays the New Name dialog box, as shown in
Figure 6-2. 
Figure 6-1
Advantages to Naming Cells and Ranges — Creating Names 89

3. In the Name text box, type a name (or use the name that Excel proposes,
if any).
4. If needed, enter a comment in the Comment box. You can enter a com-
ment, for example, to provide a description and other details of the name
for future worksheet auditing purposes.
5. Verify that the address Excel displays in the Refers To text box is correct.
To refer to a different address, delete the address and then either type the
new cell or range address (with a leading equal sign) or use the mouse
pointer to select the cell or range on the worksheet.
6. Click OK.
If you want to create several names in one go, use the Name Manager instead of
the Define Name method. Click the Name Manager button in the Formulas tab. In
the Name Manager dialog box, click New to add a name. After you finish adding
a name, you’re returned to the Name Manager dialog box, where you can repeat
the process to create additional names.
Creating a name using the name box
The name box is on the left side of the formula bar, as shown in Figure 6-3.
Name box divider

Figure 6-3
Figure 6-2

Part 6: Creating and Using Names

To create a name by using the name box, follow these steps:
1. Select the cell or range to name.
2. Click the name box, and enter the name.
3. Press Enter to create the name.
Remember: If a name already exists, you can’t use the name box to change the
reference for the name. Attempting to do so simply displays the already existing
name.
Excel 2007 allows you to increase the width of the name box, so that you can see
more of longer names. Drag the name box divider (the area around the dimple in
Figure 6-3) to the left or right.
Creating names from row and column labels
Your worksheet may contain column or row labels that you want to use for
naming adjacent cells or ranges. Figure 6-4 shows a range of data with month
labels in the left column and regions on the top row. You can create a name for
each row in the range using the labels in the left column or create a name for each
column in the range using the labels in the top row. You can also use both top row
and left column to name simultaneously each row and each column in the range.
To create names by using adjacent row or column labels, follow these steps:
1. Select the name labels and the cells that you want to name. (These can be
individual cells or ranges of cells.) The labels must be adjacent to the cells
that you’re naming. A multiple selection isn’t possible here.
2. Click the Formulas tab on the Ribbon and then click the Create from
Selection button. The Create Names from Selection dialog box appears.
Excel guesses how to create the names by checking the appropriate Create
Names From Values In The check boxes. If the labels are on the left of the
cells that you want to name, for example, Excel selects the Left Column
option.
Figure 6-4
Creating Names
91

3. If Excel’s selection isn’t what you want, clear the selection and select the
correct Create Names From Values In The check boxes as necessary.
4. Click OK to create the names.
If you create names from both row and column labels, you can refer to an entry
in your table by the intersection of the row and column labels. In Figure 6-4, for
example, I created names from the top row and left column labels in the range.
You can create a formula like this: =A1*Mar North, where Mar North = 9456.
Remember: If the label that a cell contains results in an invalid name, Excel modi-
fies the name to make it valid. If Excel encounters a value or a formula where a
text label should be, however, it doesn’t convert it to a valid name. It simply
doesn’t create a name.
Remember: The names that you create do not include the cells with the labels.
Creating sheet-level names
Normally, you can use a name that you create anywhere within the workbook.
Names, by default, are book-level rather than sheet-level in scope. But what if
you have several worksheets in a workbook and you want to use the same name
(such as Dept_Total) in each sheet to signify different values? You need to
create sheet-level names.
To define a sheet-level name, follow these steps:
1. Complete Steps 1–5 in the procedure for “Creating a name using the New
Name dialog box,” earlier in this part.
2. Click the Scope drop-down list and select the sheet name to which the
name you’re defining will belong. Although you can select any sheet name
from the list, you’ll normally want to choose the sheet with your selected
cell or range.
3. Click OK.
You also can create a sheet-level name by using the name box. Select the cell or
range, click the name box, and enter the name, preceding it with the sheet’s name
(surrounded with single quotes if the name contains spaces) and an exclamation
point. For example, if you want to create a sheet-level name of Dept_Total in a
sheet named Human Resources, enter ‘Human Resources’!Dept_Total in the
name box.
Remember: If you write a formula that uses a sheet-level name on the sheet
where you define it, you don’t need to include the worksheet name in the range
name. (The name box doesn’t display the worksheet name either.) If you use
the name in a formula on a different worksheet, however, you must use the
entire name (sheet name, exclamation point, and name).
92
Part 6: Creating and Using Names

Creating multisheet names
Names can extend into the third dimension — across multiple worksheets in a
workbook. Multisheet names must include contiguous worksheets and must
refer to the same cell or range reference in each worksheet. To create a multi-
sheet name, follow these steps:
1. Click the Formulas tab on the Ribbon and then click the Define Name
button. Excel displays the New Name dialog box.
2. In the Name text box, type a name (or use the name that Excel proposes,
if any).
3. In the Refers To text box, enter the reference (and remember to begin it
with an equal sign). The format for a multisheet reference is
FirstSheet:LastSheet!RangeReference
4. Click OK.
An easier way to enter the reference in Step 3 is by pointing. Follow these steps
after Step 2 (of the preceding list) to create a multisheet reference by pointing:
1. Click the tab of the first worksheet in the range, if it isn’t already selected.
2. Click the Refers To text box, and delete the suggested reference (which
usually isn’t the one you want).
3. Press and hold Shift, and click the tab of the last worksheet that you want
to include in the reference.
4. Select the cell or range in the first worksheet that you want to include in
the name reference. The Refers To text box displays the multisheet range.
5. Click OK.
Deleting Names
If you no longer need a defined name, you can delete it by following these steps:
1. Click the Formulas tab on the Ribbon and then click the Name Manager
button. Excel displays the Name Manager dialog box.
2. In the list, select the name that you want to delete and then click the
Delete button. Excel asks you to confirm the deletion.
3. Click OK to delete.
Creating Names — Deleting Names
93

If you change your mind after deleting the name, Excel 2007 allows you to
undo the deletion. Click the Undo button on the Quick Access toolbar or
press Ctrl+Z. Earlier versions of Excel don’t allow you to undo a name
deletion.
4. Select another name to delete or click Close the exit the Name Manager
dialog box.
Be careful when deleting names. If you use the name in a formula, deleting the
name causes the formula to become invalid. (Excel displays #NAME?.)
If you delete the rows or columns that contain named cells or ranges, the names
contain an invalid reference. For example, if cell A1 on Sheet1 is named
Interest and you delete row 1 or column A, Interest then refers to
=Sheet1!#REF! (that is, an erroneous reference). If you use the name Interest
in a formula, the formula displays #REF.
Editing Names
Editing names in Excel 2007 is simple with the new Name Manager. You can
modify the name, scope, comment, or reference. Follow these steps to edit a
name in the workbook:
1. Click the Formulas tab on the Ribbon and then click the Name Manager
button. Excel displays the Name Manager dialog box.
2. In the list, select the name you want to change and then click the Edit
button. Excel displays the Edit Name dialog box.
3. Enter a new name, comment, reference, or scope for the name and then
click OK.
4. Select another name to edit or click Close to exit the dialog box.
Managing Names
It’s not unusual for a workbook to contain several dozen, hundreds, or even
thousands of defined names. This situation makes tasks such as deleting multi-
ple names, renaming names, and finding broken names challenging. Excel 2007
provides a Name Manager dialog box that you can use to view and manage the
defined names in a workbook, as shown in Figure 6-5. To display the Name
Manager dialog box, click the Formulas tab on the Ribbon and then click the
Name Manager button.
94
Part 6: Creating and Using Names

Using the Name Manager dialog, you can
 View information for existing defined names, such as name, value, scope,
reference, and comment. See also “Creating sheet-level names,” earlier in
this part, for a discussion of a name’s scope.
 Create new names by clicking the New button to display the New Name
dialog box.
 Edit existing names by selecting the name and clicking the Edit button to
display the Edit Name dialog box.
 Delete multiple names at once by selecting the names (hold down Shift or
Ctrl to select the names) and clicking the Delete button.
 Sort any column by clicking on the column header.
 Resize the dialog box (by dragging any edge of the dialog box) so that you
can see more names and longer references in the Refers To box.
 Filter the list of names based on common criteria by clicking the Filter
button and selecting an option from the menu. The menu is separated into
three filter categories and you can select (through successive mouse
clicks) an option in each category.
Naming Constants and Formulas
Names that you use in Excel don’t need to refer to a cell or a range. You can give
a name to a constant or even to a formula. If formulas in your worksheet refer to
an interest rate (such as .085, or 8.5 percent), for example, you can define a
name for this particular constant and then use it in your formulas. Alternatively,
you can create a name that refers to a formula such as =SUM($A$1:$A$10) and
use the name in your worksheet formulas.
Figure 6-5
Deleting Names — Naming Constants and Formulas
95

To define a name for a constant or formula, follow these steps:
1. Click the Formulas tab on the Ribbon and then click the Define Name
button. Excel displays the New Name dialog box.
2. In the Name text box, type a name for the constant or formula.
3. If needed, enter a comment in the Comment box. You can enter a com-
ment, for example, to provide a description of the name for future work-
sheet auditing purposes.
4. In the Refers To text box, enter the value for the constant or the expres-
sion for the formula. Normally, this field holds a cell or range reference,
but you can also enter a value or formula.
5. Click OK.
After performing these steps, you can use the name in your formulas.
Pasting Names into a Formula
If your formula uses named cells or ranges, you can type the name in place of
the address. Another approach is to select the name from a list and have Excel
insert the name for you automatically at your cursor location in the formula. You
can do so in two ways:
 Click the Formulas tab on the Ribbon, click the Use in Formula button, and
then select a name from the list.
 Press F3 to display the Paste Name dialog box, select a name from the list,
and click OK.

Part 6: Creating and Using Names

Auditing Your Work
When your worksheets begin to get larger and more complex, ensuring accuracy
becomes more difficult. That’s why, for all but the most basic spreadsheets,
auditing is an important task. Auditing refers to the process of tracking down
and identifying errors in your worksheet. Excel provides a set of interactive
auditing tools and other tools that are useful in the auditing process, although
they are not dedicated to this purpose.

Checking for Specific Worksheet Errors
Excel can alert you regarding specific types of errors or potential errors in your
worksheet. Excel can flag the following types of errors:
 Formulas that evaluate to error values (for example, #DIV/0!, #VALUE!,
or #N/A)
 Text dates (that is, dates you format as text or precede with an apostro-
phe) that you enter with two-digit years
 Numbers that you store as text (that is, numbers that you format as text or
precede with an apostrophe)
 Inconsistent formulas in a region (that is, different from formulas in sur-
rounding cells)
 Formulas that omit cells in a region (for example, a formula that sums a
range but omits the last cell or cells in the range)
 Unlocked cells that contain formulas if the worksheet is protected
 Formulas that contain references to empty cells
Remember: Use Excel’s suggestions to serve as a guide to potential errors in your
worksheet. Excel may flag as errors data that you enter intentionally.
Excel’s error-alert feature isn’t foolproof. You should use it with other tech-
niques that we discuss in this part.
Checking for errors in the background
By default, Excel checks for worksheet errors in the background. If it identifies
an error or a potential error, Excel displays an indicator in the upper-left corner
of the offending cell. After you click the cell, Excel displays the Error Warning
Smart Tag on the left side of the offending cell. If you hover the mouse pointer
over the Error Warning Smart Tag, Excel displays a message that indicates the
nature of the error, as shown in Figure 7-1.
Figure 7-1
98
Part 7: Auditing Your Work

To correct the error or to tell Excel to ignore it, click the Error Warning Smart
Tag and select an option from the drop-down list that appears.
See also “Checking for errors manually,” immediately following this section.
Checking for errors manually
You may want to avoid the distraction of Excel’s automatic worksheet error
checking and perform the error-checking task manually after you complete work
on your spreadsheet model.
To turn off background error checking, follow these steps:
1. Click the Office button and then click the Excel Options button. Excel
displays the Excel Options dialog box with a list of option sections in the
left pane.
2. Click the Formulas section.
3. Clear the Enable Background Error Checking check box.
4. Click OK.
To check for worksheet errors manually, follow these steps:
1. Select the worksheet that you want to check for errors.
2. Click the Formulas tab on the Ribbon and then click the Error Checking
button in the Formula Auditing group. Excel displays the Error Checking
dialog box and places the cell pointer in the first cell that it encounters
containing an error or potential error. The dialog box indicates the nature
of the error that you encounter in the cell, as shown in Figure 7-2.
3. Click one of the four option buttons on the right side of the dialog box.
4. Click Next to move to the next cell that contains an error or a potential
error.
Figure 7-2
Checking for Specific Worksheet Errors 99

An alternative to this procedure is to turn on background error checking after
your spreadsheet model is complete and use the procedure in “Checking for
errors in the background,” immediately preceding this section, for each cell that
Excel flags with an error.
You can control the types of errors that you want Excel to consider (automati-
cally or through the manual procedure). Click the Office button and then click
the Excel Options button. Click the Formulas section on the left pane of the
dialog box, and select or clear the options in the Error Checking Rules area.
Checking Your Spelling
Excel uses a spell checker that works just like the feature you find in word-
processing programs. You can access the spell checker by using either of the 
following methods:
 Click the Review tab on the Ribbon and then click the Spelling button
 Press F7
The extent of the spell checking depends on what you select before you access
the dialog box.
What You Select
What Excel Checks
A single cell
The entire worksheet, including cell contents, notes, text in
graphic objects and charts, and page headers and footers
A range of cells
Only that range
A group of characters 
Only the characters in the formula bar
If Excel encounters a word that isn’t in the current dictionary or is misspelled, it
offers a list of suggestions that you can click to respond to.
Creating a Table of Names
You can create a list of all the names and associated name references in the
workbook. This procedure may be useful for tracking down errors or as a way to
document your work.
100
Part 7: Auditing Your Work

To create a table of names, follow these steps:
1. Move the cell pointer to an empty area of your worksheet or add a new
worksheet. (Excel creates the table at the active cell position.)
2. Click the Formulas tab on the Ribbon, click the arrow on the Use in
Formula button, and then select the Paste option at the bottom of the list.
(Or simply press F3.) Excel displays the Paste Name dialog box.
3. Click the Paste List button and Excel creates your table of names.
The list that Excel pastes overwrites any cells that get in the way, so make sure
the active cell is in an empty portion of the worksheet.
Displaying Formulas in a Worksheet
One way to audit your workbook is to display the formulas rather than the
results of the formulas. Then you can examine the formulas without needing to
select cells individually.
To display formulas instead of formula results, click the Formulas tab on the
Ribbon and then click the Show Formulas button in the Formula Auditing
group. (You can also press Ctrl+~.)
You may want to create a new window for the workbook before issuing this com-
mand. That way, you can see the formulas in one window and the results in the
other. See also “Creating Multiple Windows (Views) for a Workbook,” in Part 2.
Evaluating Parts of a Formula
Excel provides a tool that helps you evaluate (that is, calculate) parts of a for-
mula and trace the precedents of parts of a formula. (Precedents are cells that
are referenced in the formula part you’re evaluating.) The capability to evaluate
parts of a formula can prove useful if you’re tracking down errors in formulas.
To evaluate parts of a formula, follow these steps:
1. Click the cell that contains the formula.
2. Click the Formulas tab on the Ribbon and then click the Evaluate Formula
button in the Formula Auditing group. Excel displays the Evaluate Formula
dialog box. In the Reference area, the cell reference appears. The
Evaluation preview box displays the formula with the first expression or
cell reference underlined.
Checking for Specific Worksheet Errors — Evaluating Parts of a Formula
101

3. To show the value of the underlined expression, click Evaluate. Excel itali-
cizes the result of the expression.
4. Repeat Step 3 as many times as necessary to evaluate all expressions in
the formula.
5. Use the Step In button to examine the formula that the underlined cell ref-
erence in the expression represents. Use the Step Out button to evaluate
the current reference and return to the previous reference (see Figure 7-3).
6. Click Close after you finish evaluating the formula.
Remember: The Step In button is not available if a cell reference lies in a different
workbook.
The Evaluate Formula feature is an excellent tool to use when your formula
returns an error value because you can examine and correct the part of the for-
mula that is generating the error.
A quick way to evaluate parts of a formula is to go into edit mode (by double-
clicking the cell or pressing F2), highlight the part of the formula that you want
to evaluate, and press F9. Excel displays the result of the formula part. Press Esc
to cancel. Do not press Enter; otherwise, Excel permanently replaces the part of
the formula with the resulting value.
Finding Specific Data
If your worksheets contain lots of data, you may find locating a particular piece
of information difficult. Excel can find the data for you.
Figure 7-3
102
Part 7: Auditing Your Work

To locate a particular value or sequence of text, follow these steps:
1. Click the Find & Select button in the Ribbon’s Home tab and choose Find
from the menu. (Or simply press Ctrl+F.) Excel displays its Find and
Replace dialog box with the Find tab selected, as shown in Figure 7-4.
2. In the Find What drop-down list box, enter the characters to search
for You can also use the list also to select items that you previously
searched for.
3. If you want to make your search case-sensitive, select the Match Case
check box. If the Match Case check box isn’t visible, click the Options
button.
4. To search for data with specific formatting:
a. Click the Format button. (If the Format button isn’t visible, click the
Options button.) Excel displays the Find Format dialog box.
b. Click the appropriate tabs, and in each tab, specify the formatting that
you’re looking for.
c. After you complete your selections, click OK.
If a cell in your worksheet already contains all the formatting you want to
use in your search, click the arrow on the Format button and select
Choose Format From Cell. Excel adds an eyedropper icon to the cursor.
Click the cell with the required formatting.
5. In the Within drop-down list box, select whether you want to look in the
active sheet or the entire workbook. (If the Within drop-down box isn’t
visible, click the Options button.)
Figure 7-4
Evaluating Parts of a Formula — Finding Specific Data
103

6. In the Search drop-down box, select the direction that you want to search,
as follows:
• Select By Rows to search across rows.
• Select By Columns to search down columns.
In most cases, your search goes faster if you select By Columns.
7. In the Look In drop-down list box, specify what to look in: Formulas,
Values, or Comments.
8. Click the Find Next button. Excel selects the cell that contains what you’re
looking for.
If you click the Find All button, Excel displays a drop-down window that
shows all references to the found data, either in the active worksheet or
across the entire workbook, depending on your selection in Step 5. Click a
reference in the window to go directly to that cell.
9. Click the Close button to end your search.
For approximate searches, use wildcard characters. An asterisk represents any
group of characters in the specified position, and a question mark represents
any single character in the specified position. If you type w*h, for example,
those letters represent all text that begins with w and ends with h. Similarly, b?n
matches three-letter words such as bin, bun, and ban.
Remember: To find a cell or cells with specific formatting but containing no spe-
cific data, you can skip Step 2.
See also “Searching for Data to Replace,” in Part 4.
Handling Circular References
As you enter formulas, you may occasionally see a message from Excel that is
similar to the one shown in Figure 7-5. This message indicates that the formula
you just entered will result in a circular reference. A circular reference occurs if a
formula refers to its own value (either directly or indirectly).
Figure 7-5
104
Part 7: Auditing Your Work

If Excel encounters a circular reference after you enter a formula, a message is
displayed that enables you to correct the formula or to enter the formula as is. If
you enter a formula with a circular reference, Excel displays a message in the
status bar to remind you that a circular reference exists. Most of the time, a cir-
cular reference indicates an error that you must correct. In this case, you should
click OK after Excel displays the message.
After you click OK in response to the circular reference message, Excel displays
direct and indirect precedent arrows on the worksheet that loop back to the cell
with the circular reference. These arrows help you trace the path of the circular
reference. Excel also displays a help window, which provides further assistance
for locating circular reference problems. Excel also displays the Help Viewer
window, which displays help topics specific to working with circular references.
If you receive a workbook containing circular references, Excel displays a mes-
sage on the status bar, as mentioned. To correct the problem, follow these steps:
1. Click the Formulas tab on the Ribbon.
2. In the Formula Auditing group, click the arrow on the Error Checking
button, and then choose Circular References from the menu. Excel dis-
plays a list that includes the cell reference of the cell with the circular ref-
erence and the references of any other cells involved in the circular
reference (see Figure 7-6).
3. Click a cell reference in the list. Excel positions the active cell pointer in
the cell.
4. To trace the path of the circular reference, click the Trace Precedents
button in the Formulas tab of the Ribbon. Excel displays an arrow on the
worksheet that points from the direct precedent of the cell.
5. Click the Trace Precedents button again to add the first indirect precedent
of the cell, and so on. Eventually, the precedent arrows loop back to the
cell with the circular reference.
The trace precedents technique can be helpful in resolving many circular refer-
ence problems.
See also “Tracing Cell Relationships,” later in this part.
Figure 7-6
Finding Specific Data — Handling Circular References 105

After you resolve the circular reference problem for a cell, if additional cells
have circular reference problems, Excel continues to display the circular refer-
ence message on the status bar.
Excel doesn’t tell you about a circular reference if the Iteration setting is on. You
can check this setting by clicking the Office button, clicking the Excel Options
button, and then clicking the Formulas option section in the left pane. The Enable
Iterative Calculation option is in the Calculation Options area on the right side of
the dialog box. If iteration is on (that is, the Enable Iterative Calculation option is
selected), Excel performs the circular calculation the number of times specified in
the Maximum Iterations text box (or until the value changes by less than 0.001 —
or whatever value is in the Maximum Change text box).
Remember: In a few situations (known by advanced users), a circular reference is
intentional. In these cases, the iteration setting must be on. However, it’s best to
keep the iteration setting off so that Excel warns you of circular references.
Locating Errors by Selecting Special Cells
Excel’s ability to select specific types of cells can prove useful in your auditing
work. For example, you can select all the cells in the worksheet that contain for-
mulas. (Excel highlights all such cells.) If Excel doesn’t select a cell in a region
where it highlights other cells (for example, a formula row or column), that situ-
ation may indicate that you (or someone else) inadvertently overwrote the cell
with a static value.
Follow these steps to select cells that meet your criterion:
1. Click the Find & Select button on the Ribbon’s Home tab and then choose
an option in the middle part of the menu. The choices are Formulas,
Comments, Conditional Formatting, Constants, and Data Validation. Excel
highlights all the cells matching the criterion you choose.
2. For additional criteria choices:
a. Choose Go To Special on the Find & Select button menu. Excel displays
the Go To Special dialog box.
b. Select an option in the Go To Special dialog box.
c. To get help on the options in the dialog box, click the Help button (the
question mark icon) in the dialog box title bar. Excel displays a help
window. Click OK to close the window.
3. Click OK. Excel selects all cells that match your selected criteria.
106
Part 7: Auditing Your Work

To get an overall view of the worksheet structure if you’re selecting special cells
and to aid in tracking down potential errors, zoom out the worksheet to a small
size. See “Zooming a Worksheet,” in Part 3.
Excel has some shortcut keys that you can use to select precedent and depend-
ent cells without needing to use the Go To Special dialog box.
Key Combination
What It Selects
Ctrl+[
Direct precedents
Ctrl+Shift+[
All precedents
Ctrl+]
Direct dependents
Ctrl+Shift+]
All dependents
See also “Tracing Cell Relationships,” next.
Tracing Cell Relationships
Excel’s auditing tools can help you track down errors in your worksheet by
drawing arrows (known as cell tracers) to precedent and dependent cells. A cell’s
direct precedents are cells that are referenced in the cell’s formula. An indirect
precedent is a cell that isn’t used directly in the formula but is used by a cell that
you refer to in the formula. A cell’s dependents are formulas that reference the
particular cell, either directly or indirectly.
Tracing precedents and dependents
To trace the precedents or dependents of a cell, follow these steps:
1. Click the cell that you want to trace.
2. Click the Formulas tab on the Ribbon and do one of the following:
• Click the Trace Precedents button in the Formula Auditing group.
Excel draws arrows from all direct precedent cells.
• Click the Trace Dependents button in the Formula Auditing group.
Excel draws arrows to all direct dependent cells. See an example in
Figure 7-7.
3. Repeat Step 2 (click the Trace Precedent or Trace Dependent button) as
often as necessary to draw arrows to indirect precedent or indirect
dependent cells.
Handling Circular References — Tracing Cell Relationships
107

4. Double-click an arrow to move the cell pointer to a precedent cell or a
dependent cell. If Excel displays a dashed line pointing to a miniature sheet
icon, the precedent cells are on a different worksheet. Double-clicking the
dashed line displays the Go To dialog box. Click a cell reference in the
Go To dialog box, and click OK.
5. Click the Formulas tab on the Ribbon (if necessary) and then click the
Remove Arrows button in the Formula Auditing group after you finish
tracing the source of your error.
If you are developing a large worksheet, this type of interactive tracing is often
more revealing if you zoom out of the worksheet to display a larger area. See
“Zooming a Worksheet,” in Part 3.
See also “Tracing formula error values,” immediately following this section.
Tracing formula error values
Often, an error in one cell (for example, #DIV/0!, #VALUE!, or #NA) is the result
of an error in a precedent cell. Excel helps you to identify the cell or cells that
are causing the error value to appear.
To trace the source of the error value, follow these steps:
1. Click the cell that contains the error.
2. Click the Formulas tab on the Ribbon, click the arrow on the Error
Checking button in the Formula Auditing group, and choose Trace Error
from the menu. Excel draws arrows to all direct precedent cells.
3. Repeat Step 2 as often as necessary to draw arrows to indirect precedent
cells.
Figure 7-7
108
Part 7: Auditing Your Work

4. Double-click an arrow to move the cell pointer to a precedent cell.
5. Click the Formulas tab on the Ribbon (if necessary) and click the Remove
Arrows button in the Formula Auditing group after you finish tracing the
source of your error.
See also “Understanding Formula Error Values,” which appears next, and
“Tracing precedents and dependents,” earlier in this section.
Understanding Formula Error Values
Excel flags errors in formulas with a message that begins with a pound sign (#).
This flag signals that the formula is returning an error value. You must correct
the formula (or correct a cell that the formula references) to get rid of the error
display.
Remember: If the entire cell is full of pound signs, the column isn’t wide enough
to display the value (whether or not the value is an error).
The following table lists the types of error values that may appear in a cell that
contains a formula.
Error Value
Explanation
#DIV/0!
The formula is trying to divide by zero (an operation that’s not allowed on
this planet). This error also occurs if the formula attempts to divide by an
empty cell.
#NAME?
The formula uses a name that Excel doesn’t recognize. This error can
happen if you delete a name that the formula uses or if you have
unmatched quotes when using text.
#N/A
The error will occur, for example, if the formula refers (directly or indi-
rectly) to a cell that uses #N/A or the NA() function to signal that data is
not available. The error might also appear if a required argument is omitted
from a worksheet function. A complete discussion of all the possible
causes of this error is beyond the scope of this book.
#NULL!
The formula uses an intersection of two ranges that don’t intersect.
#NUM!
You have a problem with a value; for example, you’re specifying a negative
number where Excel expects a positive number.
#REF!
The formula refers to a cell that isn’t valid. This error can happen if you’ve
deleted the cell from the worksheet.
#VALUE!
The formula contains a function with an invalid argument, or the formula
uses an operand of the wrong type (such as text where Excel expects a
value).
Tracing Cell Relationships — Understanding Formula Error Values 109

Remember: A single error value can make its way to lots of other cells that con-
tain formulas that depend on the cell.
See also “Tracing formula error values,” earlier in this part.
Using Cell Comments
The Excel Cell Comment feature enables you to attach a comment to a cell.
Comments are useful for documenting a particular value, providing input
instructions for users, or helping you remember what a formula does. After you
move the mouse pointer over a cell that has a comment, the comment appears
in a small box (see Figure 7-8).
Adding a cell comment
To add a comment to a cell, follow these steps:
1. Select the cell.
2. Click the Review tab on the Ribbon and then click the New Comment
button. (You can also right-click the cell and choose New Comment from
the contextual menu, or press Shift+F2.)
3. In the text box, enter the text for the comment.
4. After you finish, click any cell.
The cell displays a small red triangle to indicate that it contains a comment.
Figure 7-8
110
Part 7: Auditing Your Work

Editing a cell comment
To edit a comment, follow these steps:
1. Select the cell containing the comment.
2. Click the Review tab on the Ribbon and then click the Edit Comment
button. (You can also right-click the cell and choose Edit Comment from
the contextual menu, or press Shift+F2.)
3. Edit your comment in the text box displayed.
4. After you finish, click any cell.
Viewing cell comments
Cells to which you attach a comment display a small red triangle in the upper-
right corner. After you move the mouse pointer over a cell that contains a com-
ment, Excel displays the comment.
To view the all the comments in the worksheet, click the Review tab on the
Ribbon and then click the Show All Comments button. Click Show All Comments
again to remove the comment display.
Zoom out of your worksheet to view more comments. See “Zooming a
Worksheet,” in Part 3.
Using the Watch Window
If you’re attempting to track down certain problems with large spreadsheet
models, the capability to display a window that shows the value of the formula
cells if their associated precedents are in different parts of a worksheet, in differ-
ent worksheets, or even in different open workbooks comes in handy. For exam-
ple, this ability can be useful if you’re unsure of the results that Excel is generating
in certain formula cells after you change the values in precedent cells (that is, the
cells that the formula references either directly or indirectly). This way, if you
make changes to precedent cells, you can see the result of formulas immediately
in the window. Excel provides a Watch window to handle these situations.
Displaying and adding cells to the Watch window
To display and add cells to the Watch window, follow these steps:
1. Select the cells that you want to watch.
2. Click the Formulas tab on the Ribbon and then click the Watch Window
button in the Formula Auditing group. Excel displays the Watch window.
Understanding Formula Error Values — Using the Watch Window
111

3. Click Add Watch. Excel displays the Add Watch dialog box, with the cell
references that you selected in Step 1 already filled in.
4. Click the Add button. Excel adds the cell references to the Watch window,
as shown in Figure 7-9.
5. To move the active cell pointer to the cell that an entry in the Watch
window refers to, double-click the entry in the window.
6. To add cells from other worksheets or open workbooks, switch to the
other worksheet or workbook and repeat Steps 1–4.
7. To close or hide the Watch window, click the Close button or click the
Watch Window button in the Ribbon’s Formula tab.
Instead of closing the Watch window, you can choose to dock it to one side of
the screen. Click the title bar of the Watch window and then drag the window to
any side of the screen.
To change the width of a column in the Watch window, drag the boundary on the
right side of the column heading (the mouse pointer changes to a cross with a
double-sided arrow). To resize the Watch window, drag any side of the window
(the mouse pointer turns into a double-sided arrow.)
Remember: Cells that contain links to other workbooks appear in the Watch
window only if the other workbooks are open.
To select all the cells in a worksheet that contain formulas, do the following: In
Step 1 click the Find & Select button on the Ribbon’s Home tab, choose Go To
Special from the menu, select Formulas in the Go To Special dialog box that
appears, and click OK.
Removing cells from the Watch window
To remove cells from the Watch window, follow these steps:
1. Select the cell references in the Watch window that you want to remove.
To select contiguous cell references, click the first reference, press and
hold Shift, and click the last reference. To select noncontiguous refer-
ences, press Ctrl and then click the cells.
2. Click Delete Watch.

Formatting Your Data
You have a lot of control over the appearance of information that you enter into
a cell. Changing the appearance of a cell’s content is known as formatting.
Formatting data in a range can make your worksheet more readable and present-
able. In this part, you discover how to apply Excel’s many formatting options.

Adding Borders to a Cell or a Range
People often use borders to group a range of similar cells or simply as a way to
delineate rows or columns for aesthetic purposes.
To add borders around a cell or range, follow these steps:
1. Select the cell or range.
2. Click the arrow on the Borders button in the Ribbon’s Home tab. Excel dis-
plays the Borders menu.
3. Choose a border style from the menu. Excel applies the border to your
selection. In addition, the Borders button icon changes to reflect your
border selection.
If the available styles on the menu aren’t what you want, follow these steps to
select further options:
1. At the bottom of the Borders menu, choose More Borders. Excel displays
the Format Cells dialog box with the Borders tab selected.
2. If you want to change the default color, choose a color for the border from
the Color drop-down palette.
3. In the Style area of the dialog box, select a line style.
4. Select the border position(s) for the line style by clicking in the Text
window or by clicking one or more buttons surrounding the Text window.
To deselect a line in Text window, click the line. Note that you can apply
diagonal borders that extend through cells and ranges. Diagonal borders
give the effect of the cells being “crossed out.”
5. Click OK to apply the border(s) to your selection.
If you use border formatting in your worksheet, you may want to turn off the
grid display to make the borders more pronounced. Click the View tab on the
Ribbon and then click the Gridlines option to remove its check mark.
Aligning Cell Contents
Excel’s default alignments are such that cell contents appear at the bottom,
numbers are right-aligned, text is left-aligned, and logical values (True or False)
are centered in cells. You can use Excel’s alignment tools to change the default
alignments that Excel applies to cell contents. Figure 8-1 shows several align-
ment options discussed in this section.
114
Part 8: Formatting Your Data

To apply a standard alignment option, select the cell or range that you want to
align and then select one of the following options from the Alignment group on
the Ribbon’s Home tab. (Hover the mouse pointer over an alignment option to
display an Extended ScreenTip for the option.)
 Vertical alignment: The options are Top, Center, and Bottom. See cells
A1:A3 in Figure 8-1.
 Horizontal alignment: The options are Left, Center, and Right. See cells
A5:A7 in Figure 8-1.
 Indent: The options are Increase Indent and Decrease Indent. Multiple
clicks on the Increase Indent or Decrease Indent buttons increases or
decreases the indent further. See cells A10:A17 in Figure 8-1.
 Orientation: Click the Orientation button to display a menu of predefined
orientations. Excel adjusts the row height to display the text. If you don’t
want this adjustment, you can use the Merge feature first (described
shortly) to avoid a larger row height across the worksheet. See cells H3:K3
in Figure 8-1.
 Wrap Text: Select this option when you want a long text entry to take up
less horizontal area on the worksheet. See cells D3:F3 in Figure 8-1.
 Merge and Center: You can merge multiple cells into a single, larger cell.
This feature enables you to have cells of unequal sizes. If you have a table
that spans six columns, for example, you can merge six cells at the top to
form a single larger cell for the table’s title. In Figure 8-1, cells E10:G10 are
Figure 8-1
Adding Borders to a Cell or a Range — Aligning Cell Contents 115

merged horizontally, and cells C12:C15 are merged vertically. Note the fol-
lowing rules when merging cells:
• You can merge cells horizontally or vertically.
• If a selection contains more than one nonempty cell, the merged cells
contain the contents and formatting of the upper-left cell of the
merged range.
• Understanding that cells are merged — not the contents of cells — is
important. Whenever you merge cells, you receive a warning if the
selected range contains more than one nonempty cell.
If you do not want to center your data when you merge cells, or if you want
to unmerge cells, click the arrow on the Merge and Center button and then
choose the appropriate option on the menu.
Changing the Appearance of Cell Contents
By default, Excel formats the information you enter into a worksheet by using
the 11-point Calibri font. However, if you want to emphasize various parts of
your worksheet, such as the headers in a list, you can apply a different font
style, size, color, background, or attribute to the header cells.
To apply a standard formatting option, select the cell or range that you want to
format and then select one of the following options from the Format group on
the Ribbon’s Home tab:
 Font Face: Select a font face from the font picker drop-down list. To pre-
view the change in the selected cell or range before you commit to the
change, hover the mouse pointer over a font face in the list.
 Font Size: Select a font size from the font picker drop-down list. To pre-
view the change in the selected cell or range before you commit to the
change, hover the mouse pointer over a font size in the list.
 Increase/Decrease Font Size: These buttons increase or decrease the
font in the selected cell or range by 2 points.
 Font Style: The options are Bold, Italic and Underline. Click the arrow on
the Underline button if you want to apply a double-underline to the con-
tents of your selected cell or range.
You can also use the following shortcut keys to apply a standard font style
to your selection: Ctrl+B for bold, Ctrl+I for italic, and Ctrl+U for underline.
Remember: The Ribbon buttons and shortcut keys act as toggles. You can
turn bold on and off, for example, by repeatedly pressing Ctrl+B (or click-
ing the Bold button).
116
Part 8: Formatting Your Data

 Font Color: Click the Font Color button to apply the color that the
button displays to the font in your selected cell or range. Click the
arrow on the button to choose a color from the color palette.
 Background Color: Click the Background Color button to apply the cell
background color that the button displays. Click the arrow on the button to
select a color from the color palette.
Remember: If you choose non-theme fonts or colors, the fonts or colors don’t
change if you change the workbook theme. See also “Formatting with Themes,”
in Part 1 and “Using Cell Styles,” later in this part.
Copying Formats
The quickest way to copy the formats from one cell to another cell or range is to
use the Format Painter button in the Ribbon’s Home tab. Follow these steps:
1. Select the cell or range with the formatting attributes that you want to
copy.
2. Click the Format Painter button. Notice that the mouse pointer appears as
a miniature paintbrush.
3. Select (paint) the cells to which you want to apply the formats.
4. Release the mouse button, and Excel copies the formats.
Double-clicking the Format Painter button causes the mouse pointer to remain a
paintbrush after you release the mouse button. This paintbrush enables you to
paint other areas of the worksheet with the same formats. To exit paint mode,
click the Format Painter button again (or press Esc).
Formatting Based on the Contents of a Cell or Range
In addition to applying static formatting to your worksheet cells and ranges, you
can format a cell or range based on the contents of the cell or range. Using Excel
conditional formatting feature, you can format one or more cells based on the
values in the cells, or you can format a range based on the relative values of the
cells in the range. You may, for example, want to visually identify all cells in a
range that exceed a certain value or you may want to highlight cells in a range
having duplicate values.
You can apply any combination of the following standard formatting options
when the criteria for formatting the cell are met: Number, Font, Border, and Fill.
See also “Changing the Appearance of Cell Contents,” earlier in this part.
Aligning Cell Contents — Formatting Based on the Contents of a Cell or Range 117

Formatting based on individual cell values
Excel provides several criteria that you can use to format individual cells.
Earlier versions of Excel allowed you to format cells based on
 The value in the cell.
 A formula. The formula must return a value of True or False for the condi-
tion to be applied. For example, to apply a format to cell C3 if the sum of
the values in cells A1 to A10 is greater than 2500, you will enter the follow-
ing conditional formula for cell C3:
=SUM($A$1:$A$10)>2500
The formula returns True if the sum of cells A1 to A10 is greater than 2500
and False otherwise.
In Excel 2007, you can also format cells based on
 The cells containing, not containing, beginning with, or ending with spe-
cific text. In a list of parts, for example, you can highlight part numbers
that contain certain characters.
 The cells containing dates that match dynamic conditions such as yester-
day, today, tomorrow, in the last 7 days, last week, this week, next week,
last month, this month, or next month. Excel calculates the date based on
your PC’s internal real-time clock, so you do not have to update the condi-
tion manually.
 The cells being blank or not blank.
 The cells having or not having errors.
Follow these steps to conditionally format individual cells or a range of cells:
1. Select the cell or range that you want to format conditionally.
2. Click the Conditional Formatting button on the Ribbon’s Home tab. Excel
displays a menu of conditional formatting options.
3. Choose Highlight Cells Rules and then choose any option except Duplicate
Values from the flyout menu. For example, to format a cell or range of cells
if the values in the cells exceed a certain value, choose Greater Than from
the flyout menu.
4. In the dialog box that appears (see Figure 8-2), enter a value (or values in
the case of Between) in the box on the left. (The label for this box changes
depending on what you chose in Step 3.) Instead of entering a value in the
Format Cells That Are box, you can click the mouse pointer in the box and
point to a cell on the worksheet.
118
Part 8: Formatting Your Data

5. If you see a formatting option you like in the drop-down list on the right of
the box in which you entered a value, select the option and then click OK
to apply the conditional format.
6. If you don’t like any of the available formatting options:
a. Select Custom Format at the bottom of the drop-down list. Excel dis-
plays the Format Cells dialog box.
b. Select your formatting options on the Number, Font, Border, and Fill
tabs as appropriate.
c. Click OK to close the Format Cells dialog box, and then click OK again
to apply the conditional format.
Remember: If the cell doesn’t meet the condition that you specify, it takes on the
standard formatting for the cell.
If you copy a cell containing conditional formatting, the conditional formatting
applies to all copies.
Formatting based on values in a range
Excel 2007 provides several criteria that you can use to format cells based on a
comparison of the cell values in a range. You can format cells in a range based on
 Duplicate or unique values
 Top N items (values), where N is a number you specify
 Top N% rank, where N is a number you specify
 Bottom N items (values), where N is a number you specify
 Bottom N% rank, where N is a number you specify
 Above average values
 Below average values
 Average or above average values
 Average or below average values
Figure 8-2
Formatting Based on the Contents of a Cell or Range
119

 One to three standard deviations above average values
 One to three standard deviations below average values
Follow these steps to conditionally format a range of cells based on a compari-
son of the cells in the range:
1. Select the range that you want to format conditionally.
2. Click the Conditional Formatting button on the Ribbon’s Home tab. Excel
displays a menu of conditional formatting options.
3. Choose one of the following options:
• To highlight duplicate or unique values in the range, choose Highlight
Cells Rules and then choose Duplicate Values from the flyout menu.
• To highlight the top N value cells, top N% rank cells, and so on, choose
Top/Bottom Rules and then choose an option in the flyout menu.
4. In the dialog box that appears (see Figure 8-3 for an example), select the
value option on the left side and a formatting option on the right side
drop-down list.
5. If you see a formatting option you like in the drop-down list, select the
option and click OK to apply the conditional format.
6. If you don’t like any of the available formatting options:
a. Select Custom Format at the bottom of the list. Excel displays the
Format Cells dialog box.
b. Choose your formatting options on the Number, Font, Border, and Fill
tabs as appropriate.
c. Click OK to close the Format Cells dialog box, and then click OK again
to apply the conditional format.
Figure 8-3

Part 8: Formatting Your Data

Applying multiple conditional formats to a cell or range
Excel allows you to specify more than one conditional format for a cell. For
example, you can have different formatting for a cell based on the value in
the cell.
In earlier versions of Excel, you were limited to a maximum of three conditional
formats per cell. In Excel 2007, the number of conditional formats per cell is lim-
ited only by your PC’s memory. Also, Excel 2007 allows you to apply multiple
conditional formats to a cell if more than one condition is True. For example, if
one conditional format applies a bold font when a formatting condition is True,
and another makes the cell background color red when a second formatting con-
dition is True, Excel applies both formats to the cell if the two conditions evalu-
ate to True. If the formatting conflicts (for example a red font and a green font),
Excel applies only the first rule that meets the condition.
Follow these steps to add an additional conditional format for a cell or range:
1. Select the cell or range that already contains one conditional format.
2. Click the Conditional Formatting button on the Ribbon’s Home tab and
choose Manage Rules (at the bottom of the menu). Excel displays the
Conditional Formatting Rules Manager dialog box, as shown in Figure 8-4.
The Conditional Formatting Rules Manager dialog box is new in Excel
2007. By default, the window displays the conditional formatting rule(s)
applied to the current selection. If you weren’t sure of the range in Step 1,
you can click the Show Formatting Rules For drop-down list and select
This Worksheet (or other worksheets in the workbook). The rules window
then displays all the conditional formatting rules and the ranges to which
the rule(s) apply. Make note of the range to which you want to add a new
rule, exit the dialog box, and begin again at Step 1.
Figure 8-4
Formatting Based on the Contents of a Cell or Range
121

3. In the dialog box, click the New rule button. Excel displays the New
Formatting Rule dialog box.
4. In the Select a Rule Type list, choose a rule type. To apply standard condi-
tional formatting options (number, font, border or patterns), do not select
the first option in the window (Format All Cells Based on Their Values).
The controls that appear initially in the Edit the Rules Description section
depend on the rule type you chose.
5. In the leftmost drop-down list in the Edit the Rules Description section,
choose an option (for all choices in Step 4 except Use a Formula to
Determine Which Cells to Format). New controls appear to the right of
this drop-down list depending on your choice. Complete the requirements
for the controls (for example, enter a value, enter a cell reference, or
choose from a list).
6. Click Format to display the Format Cells dialog box and select your for-
matting options from among the available tabs.
7. Click OK to exit the dialog box, and click OK again to exit the New
Formatting Rule dialog box. Excel returns you to the Conditional
Formatting Rules Manager dialog box.
8. Excel evaluates conditional formatting rules in the order listed in the
Conditional Formatting Rules Manager dialog box. To change the evalua-
tion order of a rule, select the rule and click the up or down arrow to the
right of the Delete rule button.
9. Click OK.
Editing or deleting a conditional format
Follow these steps if you want to edit a condition for a cell or range or delete a
condition for a cell or range with multiple conditions:
1. Select the cell or range that contains the conditional format you want to
edit or delete.
2. Click the Conditional Formatting button on the Ribbon’s Home tab, and
then choose Manage Rules (at the bottom of the menu). Excel displays the
Conditional Formatting Rules Manager dialog box.
3. In the Conditional Formatting Rules Manager dialog box, select the condi-
tion you want to edit or delete.
122
Part 8: Formatting Your Data

4. Do one of the following:
• To delete the condition, click Delete.
• To edit the condition, click Edit. Make your changes in the Edit
Formatting Rule dialog box that appears and then click OK.
5. Click OK.
To quickly delete (clear) all conditional formatting rules for a cell or range,
select the cell or range, click the Conditional Formatting button on the Ribbon’s
home tab, choose Clear Rules from the menu, and then choose Selected Cells
from the flyout menu. To quickly delete (clear) all conditional formatting rules
for the active worksheet, choose Entire Sheet from the Clear Rules flyout menu.
Formatting Numbers
Excel internally stores all numbers and dates that you enter in your worksheet
as plain, unformatted numbers. You can use Excel’s built-in numeric and
date/time formats to make your data more readable and understandable. In
addition, if you can’t find a suitable built-in format to fit your needs, you can
create a custom number format.
Using Excel’s built-in number formats
Excel is smart enough to perform some number formatting for you automati-
cally. If you enter 9.6% into a cell, for example, Excel knows that you want to use
a percentage format and applies it for you automatically. Similarly, if you use
commas to separate thousands (such as 123,456) or a dollar sign to indicate
currency (such as $123.45), Excel applies the appropriate formatting for you.
Use the buttons in the Number group of the Ribbon’s Home tab to quickly apply
common number formats. After you click one of these buttons, the active cell
takes on the specified number format.
You can select among several currency symbols by clicking the arrow on the
Accounting Number Format button in the Number group of the Ribbon’s
Home tab and choosing a symbol from the menu.
To access additional number formats, click the arrow on the Number Format
drop-down list above the number format buttons and select an option from the
list.
Formatting Based on the Contents of a Cell or Range — Formatting Numbers 123

If none of the predefined number format buttons or Number Format list options
fit the bill, you need to use the Format Cells dialog box. Follow these steps to
select an option from the Format Cells dialog box:
1. Select a cell or range of cells you want to format.
2. Click the arrow on the Number Format drop-down list and select More
Number Formats at the bottom of the list; or click the Number dialog
launcher button at the bottom right of the Number group container. Excel
displays the Format Cells dialog box with the Number tab selected.
3. In the Category list box, select one of the categories. After you choose a
category, the right side of the dialog box changes to display the appropri-
ate options.
4. Choose an option from the right side of the dialog box. The top of the
dialog box displays a sample of how the active cell appears with the
number format you chose.
5. Click OK to apply the number format to all the selected cells.
Remember: If the cell displays a series of pound signs (such as ####), it means
the column isn’t wide enough to display the value using the number format you
chose. The solution is to make the column wider or to change the number
format. See “Changing column width,” later in this part.
Creating custom number formats
Excel provides many predefined number formats, but if none of these formats are
satisfactory, you need to create a custom number format. Just follow these steps:
1. Complete Steps 1 to 3 for accessing the Format Cells dialog box as
detailed in the preceding section, but in Step 3, select Custom in the
Category list box.
2. Construct a number format by selecting an option from the right list box
or by specifying a series of codes in the Type text box (located above the
list box). In the Type text box, you can also modify a code you select from
the list box. The Sample area shows how an entry in the active cell will be
displayed with the code specified in the Type text box. 
3. Click OK to store the custom number format and apply it to the selected
cells. The custom number format is now available for you to use with
other cells in the workbook.
To find out more about the meaning of custom formatting codes, check out this
online resource:
http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/assistance/HP051986791033.aspx
124
Part 8: Formatting Your Data

After reviewing the online information, it will become clearer how Excel con-
structs its built-in number formats. Click a cell with a built-in format, and then
display the Format Cells dialog box as already described and select the custom
option in the Category list box. The text box on the right of the dialog box dis-
plays the formatting code for the built-in format. If you want, you can create a
custom format by modifying a built-in format.
Remember: Excel stores custom number formats with the workbook. To make the
custom format available in a different workbook, you must copy a cell that uses
the custom format to the other workbook.
Formatting Ranges Using Visualizations
Visualizations allow you to compare the relative values in a range visually. Excel
2007 uses special conditional formatting within the cells to make this relative
comparison. Visual comparisons are particularly useful if you have a lot of data
to analyze, because you can quickly detect trends, spot outliers (a value far from
most others in a data set), compare performance (good, bad, or neutral) and so
on. Excel 2007 provides the following three special conditional formatting tools
for comparing the relative values in a range:
 Data bar: Uses horizontal bars to compare the relative sizes of values in
the range.
 Color scale: Uses color gradients (such as various shades of red, amber,
and green) to compare the variation of values in the range.
 Icon set: Uses a set of icons (for example up, down, and horizontal arrows)
to compare values in the range.
Figure 8-5 shows examples of each visualization type.
Figure 8-5
Formatting Numbers — Formatting Ranges Using Visualizations 125

Using a visualization to compare values in a range
To use a visualization to compare relative values in a range, follow these steps:
1. Select the range.
2. Click the Conditional Formatting button on the Ribbon’s Home tab. Excel
displays a menu of conditional formatting options.
3. Choose one of the following options from the menu:
• Data Bars. Choose a bar color from the flyout menu. By default, Excel
uses the highest and lowest values in the range to draw the longest and
shortest bar, respectively. To allow the shortest bar to show in a cell
when there is a wide variation between the smallest and largest value in
the range, Excel sets the shortest bar to ten percent of the cell width.
• Color Scales. Choose a color scale from the flyout menu. By default,
Excel uses the lowest, highest, and midpoint values in the range to
determine the color gradients.
• Icon Sets. Choose an icon set from the flyout menu. You can choose
icon sets having three, four, or five icons. By default, Excel uses per-
centages to determine the break between icons. In the case of a three-
icon set, for example, Excel sets 33% and 67% as the break between the
three icons.
If you hover the mouse pointer over an option in any flyout menu, Excel
shows a preview of the visualization that will be applied to the range.
Modifying the visualization for a range
After you create a visualization for a range, you can modify the visualization in
several ways. You can use a different visualization, change the type of comparison
among the values in the range, or display the visualization without the cell values.
Follow these steps to modify the visualization for a range:
1. Select the range that contains the visualization you want to edit.
2. Click the Conditional Formatting button on the Ribbon’s Home tab and
then choose Manage Rules (at the bottom of the menu). Excel displays the
Conditional Formatting Rules Manager dialog box.
3. In the Conditional Formatting Rules Manager dialog box, click the Edit rule
button. If you have more than one conditional formatting rule applied to a
range, select the rule you want to modify in the window before clicking
the Edit rule button. Excel displays the Edit Formatting Rule dialog box.
See Figure 8-6.
4. In the Select a Rule Type list, ensure that Format All Cells Based on Their
Values is selected.
126
Part 8: Formatting Your Data

5. In the Edit the Rule Description section, select your options:
• If you want to change the visualization in the selected range, select a
new option in the Format Style drop-down list.
• If you want a different comparison for the relative values in the range,
first make a selection from the Type drop-down list. The options are
Lowest or Highest value (applicable to data bars and color scales),
Number, Percent, Percentile, and Formula.
Next, enter values for the type of comparison you chose. The Value
option is not available if you choose Lowest Value or Highest Value for
the comparison type. The values you enter have different meaning for
the visualization you choose: For data bars, the values and compari-
son type combine to determine the bar size for each value in the
selected range. For color scales, the values and comparison type com-
bine to determine the color assigned to each value in the selected
range. for icon sets, the values and comparison type combine to deter-
mine the icon assigned to each value in the selected range.
• To choose a different bar color for a data bar, different colors for the
lowest, highest, and midpoint (if applicable) values for a color scale,
or a different icon set style for a displayed icon set, make a selection in
the Bar Color or Icon Style drop-down list.
• If you want to display data bars or icons in the selected range without
the associated values, select the Show Bar or Icon Only check box
(available after you choose a data bar or icon set format style,
respectively).
6. Click Preview to preview the changes in the selected range and then click
OK to apply the changes.
Figure 8-6
Formatting Ranges Using Visualizations
127

Hiding Cell Contents
You can hide the contents of a cell by using either of the following formatting
options:
 Apply a custom number format consisting of three semicolons (;;;). 
See “Creating custom number formats,” earlier in this part.
 Make the text color the same as the background color. See “Changing the
Appearance of Cell Contents,” earlier in this part.
Both formatting techniques have the same flaw: If the active cell pointer is on the
cell, its contents are visible in the formula bar. To avoid this flaw and make the
cell contents truly invisible, you should protect the worksheet after you choose
one of the preceding options. See also “Protecting a Worksheet,” in Part 3.
Hiding and Unhiding Columns and Rows
Hiding columns and rows is useful if you don’t want users to see particular infor-
mation or if you don’t want some information to print. Alternatively, you can
unhide rows or columns to reveal information.
Hiding columns and rows
To hide a column(s) or row(s), choose one of the following options:
 Select any cell(s) on the worksheet in the column(s) or row(s) that you
want to hide. In the Ribbon’s Home tab, choose Format➪Hide &
Unhide➪Hide Columns; or Format➪Hide & Unhide➪Hide Rows.
 Select the column or row header(s) you want to hide. See “Selecting entire
rows and columns,” in Part 4. In the Ribbon’s Home tab, choose Format➪
Hide & Unhide➪Hide Columns; or Format➪Hide & Unhide➪Hide Rows; or
right-click the selected row or column header(s) and choose Hide from the
contextual menu.
 Drag a column header’s right border all the way to the left or a row
header’s bottom border all the way upward.
Remember: A hidden column or row has a width or height of 0. If you use the
arrow keys to move the active cell pointer, you skip cells in hidden columns or
rows. In other words, you can’t use the arrow keys to move to a cell in a hidden
row or column.
See also the next section, “Unhiding columns and rows.”
128
Part 8: Formatting Your Data

Unhiding columns and rows
Unhiding a hidden row or column can prove a bit tricky because you can’t
directly select a row or column that’s hidden.
To unhide a column(s) or row(s), choose one of the following options:
 Select any cells on the worksheets on either side of the column(s) or
row(s) that you want to unhide. In Figure 8-7, for example, if you want to
unhide columns E and F, select any row on the worksheet and select cells
in columns D and G. In the Ribbon’s Home tab, choose Format➪Hide &
Unhide➪Unhide Columns; or Format➪Hide & Unhide➪Unhide Rows.
 Select the column or row header(s) on either side of the row(s) or
column(s) you want to unhide. See “Selecting entire rows and columns,” 
in Part 4. In the Ribbon’s Home tab, choose Format➪Hide & Unhide➪
Unhide Columns; or Format➪Hide & Unhide➪Unhide Rows; or right-click
the selected row or column header(s) and choose Unhide from the con-
textual menu.
To unhide all hidden columns or rows, select the entire worksheet (by pressing
Ctrl+A or clicking the blank box that intersects the row and column headings)
and then choose Format➪Hide & Unhide➪Unhide Columns; or Format➪Hide &
Unhide➪Unhide Rows
Modifying Cell Size
You may want to change the width of a column if it’s not wide enough to display
values (indicated when the column displays a series of pound signs — #######)
or to simply space out the cells horizontally. Changing the row height is useful
for spacing out rows and is sometimes better than inserting empty rows
between rows of data.
Figure 8-7
Hiding Cell Contents — Modifying Cell Size 129

Changing column width
To change the width of a column(s), choose one of the following options:
 Select any cell(s) on the worksheets in the column(s) that you want to
adjust. On the Ribbon’s Home tab, click the Format button, choose Width
from the menu, and enter a value in the Column Width dialog box that
appears. Alternatively, choose AutoFit Selection from the menu. This com-
mand adjusts the width of the selected column(s) so that the widest entry
in the column fits.
 Drag the right border of the column heading with the mouse until the
column is the width that you want. As you drag, Excel displays a ScreenTip
that shows the current column width (see Figure 8-8). If you select multiple
column headers and drag the right border of any one of the column head-
ers, all columns adjust accordingly.
 Double-click the right border of a column heading to automatically set the
column width to the widest entry in the column. If you select multiple
column headers and double-click the right border of any one of the column
headers, each column width is set automatically to the widest entry in the
column.
 Select the column heading(s) of the column(s) you want to adjust. Right-
click the column header(s), choose Column Width from the contextual
menu, and enter a value in the Column Width dialog box that appears.
To change the default width of all columns, click the Format button and choose
Standard Width from the menu. This command opens the Standard Width dialog
box, in which you enter the new default column width. All columns that weren’t
previously adjusted take on the new column width.
Changing row height
You measure row height in points (a standard unit of measurement in the print-
ing trade; 72 points equal 1 inch). To change the height of a row(s), choose one
of the following options:
 Select any cell(s) on the worksheets in the row(s) that you want to adjust.
On the Ribbon’s Home tab, click the Format button, choose Height from
the menu, and enter a value in the Row Height dialog box that appears.
Figure 8-8
130
Part 8: Formatting Your Data

 Drag the bottom border of the row heading with the mouse until the row
is the height that you want. As you drag, Excel displays a ScreenTip that
shows the current row height. If you select multiple row headers and
drag the bottom border of any one of the row headers, all rows adjust
accordingly.
 Select the row heading(s) of the row(s) you want to adjust. Right-click the
row header(s), choose Row Height from the contextual menu, and enter a
value in the Row Height dialog box that appears.
Remember: Excel adjusts the row height automatically to accommodate the
tallest entry in the row.
Using Cell Styles
If you find yourself continuously applying the same combination of fonts, lines,
shading, number format, and so on to cells or ranges in your worksheet, using
cell styles instead will save you time.
Excel 2007 provides a Cell Styles gallery with several predefined styles (see
Figure 8-9.) You can modify a predefined style or create a new style from scratch.
The Cell Styles gallery includes Titles and Heading styles and Themed Cell styles
categories that change if you change the workbook theme. The default font used
for styles in the other predefined categories in the gallery matches the body font
of the selected theme and therefore changes as the theme changes. See also
“Formatting with Themes,” in Part 1.
Figure 8-9
Modifying Cell Size — Using Cell Styles
131

A cell style can include any combination of the following formatting elements:
 Number format
 Font (type, size, and color)
 Alignment (vertical and horizontal)
 Border
 Pattern
 Protection (locked and hidden)
Applying a predefined cell style
Follow these steps to apply a predefined style:
1. Select the cell or range to which you want to apply the style. You can
select a contiguous or noncontiguous range. See also “Selecting Cells and
Ranges,” in Part 4.
2. Click the Cell Styles button on the Ribbon’s Home tab. Excel displays a
gallery of predefined styles.
3. Choose a style from the gallery to immediately apply the style. If you
hover the mouse pointer over a style, Excel provides a preview of the
style in your selected cell or range. The style is not applied until you actu-
ally select (click) it.
The Cells Styles gallery includes a few categories with styles that you can use
as a guide for representing certain types of data. For example, you can use the
Good, Bad, and Neutral styles to highlight data in your worksheet that’s consid-
ered good, bad, or neutral. You can use the Data and Model styles to represent
input cells, cells that involve calculations (formulas), and so on. These two style
categories use a theme font and non-theme colors. If you select a new theme for
the workbook, the font changes to match the new theme but the colors remain
unchanged.
Select a style from the Themed Cell style category if you want to format a range
to match other elements on the worksheet that use theme styles (a chart, for
example). If you change the theme applied to the workbook, the formatting of
the range changes to match the new theme.
See also “Formatting with Themes,” in Part 1.

Part 8: Formatting Your Data

Modifying an existing style
The Cell Styles gallery is an example of the Ribbon’s results-oriented approach.
The Cell Styles gallery provides predefined layouts that you’re likely to be satis-
fied with. However, if none of the available styles are exactly what you want but
are close, you can simply modify an existing style rather than create a new style
from scratch. For example, you might be happy with a certain style’s font and
background color but not the number format, or you might like the number
format and font but not the background color.
Follow these steps to modify an existing style:
1. Click the Cell Styles button on the Ribbon’s Home tab, right-click a style,
and choose Modify from the menu that appears. Excel displays the Style
dialog box.
2. If you want, type a new name for the style in the Style Name box.
3. In the Style Includes section, click to add or clear a check mark next to the
formatting elements you want to include or not include in the modified
style.
4. Click the Format button. Excel displays the Format Cells dialog box.
5. Select the appropriate tabs and formatting options you want.
6. Click OK to exit the Format Cells dialog box and click OK again to close
the Style dialog box. Excel updates the style in the gallery with the
changes you made.
Creating a custom cell style
If none of the styles available in the Cell Styles gallery meet your needs either
directly or by modifying a style, you can create a style from scratch. Follow
these steps to create a custom cell style:
1. Click the Cell Styles button on the Ribbon’s Home tab, and then choose
New Cell Style (at the bottom of the gallery). Excel displays the Style
dialog box.
2. In the Style Name box, type a name for the style.
3. Complete Steps 3 to 6 in the section “Modifying an existing style,” immedi-
ately preceding this section. Excel adds the style to a new Custom cate-
gory section it creates in the Cell Styles gallery.
Using Cell Styles
133

Copying (merging) cell styles from another workbook
If you modify existing styles or create several custom styles in a workbook, you
may want these styles to appear in other workbooks. Merging styles from
another workbook can save a lot of time because you don’t have to recreate the
styles manually in every new workbook in which you want to use the styles.
Follow these steps to merge a style from another workbook:
1. Ensure that the workbook from which you want to merge the styles is open.
2. Activate the workbook you want to merge the styles to.
3. Click the Cell Styles button on the Ribbon’s Home tab, and then choose
Merge Styles (at the bottom of the gallery). Excel displays the Merge
Styles dialog box.
4. In the Merge Styles From list box, select the workbook from which you will
be merging the styles and click OK.
5. Excel asks you to confirm whether you want to merge styles with the same
names as styles in the workbook that you’re merging to. In most cases, you
want to click No. Excel merges the styles into the active workbook.
6. To view the merged styles, click the Cell Styles button.

Printing Your Work
Many worksheets that you develop with Excel are designed to serve as printed
reports. Printing from Excel is easy, and you can generate attractive reports
with minimal effort. Excel offers numerous printing options, which we explain
in this part.

Adjusting Margins and Centering Printed Output
Margins are the blank spaces that border a printed page (top, bottom, left, and
right). The wider the margins, the less space that is available for printing. You
can control all four page margins from Excel.
To adjust the margins, follow these steps:
1. Click the Page Layout View button on the status bar or in the Ribbon’s
View tab. Although you can set margins in normal display mode, you will
see exactly how the margin settings will affect your printout in page
layout view.
2. Select the Page Layout tab on the Ribbon.
3. Click the Margins button, and choose an option from the gallery. Excel
applies the new margin settings to your worksheet.
4. If you need finer control over the margin settings, or if you want to center
your printed output
a. Choose Custom Margins from the gallery. Excel displays the Page
Setup dialog box with the Margins tab selected.
b. Click the appropriate spinner to change the margin value (or enter a
value directly in one of the boxes).
c. If you need to center your printed output, select one or both of the
check boxes (Vertical and Horizontal) in the Center on Page section of
the dialog box.
d. Click OK to close the Page Setup dialog box.
Another way to adjust the margins in page layout view is through the rulers. The
rulers appear at the top and the left of the page containing the active cell
pointer. The document print area is within the white portion of the rulers. The
margins are represented by the dark areas on the rulers (which border the print
area). To adjust the margins, drag the boundary between the print and margin
areas (left, right, top, and bottom). After you place the mouse pointer on a
margin boundary, the pointer changes to a horizontal double-headed arrow and
Excel display a ScreenTip indicating the margin name (Left, Right, Top, or
Bottom) and the margin size.
Remember: You can turn the rulers on or off by selecting the Ruler option on the
Ribbon’s View tab.
136
Part 9: Printing Your Work

Changing Default Print Settings Using a Template
If you find that you’re never satisfied with the Excel default print settings, you
may want to create a template with the print settings you use most often. To
create such a template, follow these steps:
1. Start with an empty workbook. See “Creating an Empty Workbook File,” in
Part 2.
2. Adjust the print settings to your liking. Use the appropriate section in this
part if you need assistance with a particular setting.
3. Save the workbook as a template in your xlstart folder, using the name
Book.xlt. See “Creating a default workbook template,” in Part 2.
Excel uses this template as the basis for all new workbooks, and your custom
print settings become the default settings.
Changing the Worksheet Display Mode
Excel provides the following two special display modes that you can work in
with documents you intend to print:
 Page break preview: This display mode shows a birds-eye view of your
worksheet with lines indicating the location of page breaks and page
number watermarks identifying the pages. This display mode is useful for
setting or adjusting page breaks.
 Page layout view: The new page layout view shows your work in the
context of the printed page (see Figure 9-1). This display mode has the
following characteristics:
• Shows individual pages with headers and footers, margins, page orien-
tation, and common worksheet print settings (such as row and column
headers or row and column data labels if selected.)
• The view is fully editable, so that you can use this mode in lieu of the
normal display mode for any document you intend to print. Note, how-
ever, that you will see less data on-screen than in Normal display mode.
• The pages that will not print are shaded and contain the phrase Click
to add data watermark.
Adjusting Margins and Centering Printed Output — Changing the Worksheet Display Mode 137

You can switch between display modes easily by clicking a display mode button
on the right side of the status bar (see Figure 9-1) or by clicking a mode button
in the Ribbon’s View tab.
Controlling Page Settings
You can control how a page prints using several options, including orientation,
paper size, and scaling. This section describes how to use the more common
page options.

Part 9: Printing Your Work

Changing page orientation
To change the page orientation (to landscape or portrait) of your printed
output, click the Page Layout tab on the Ribbon, click the Orientation button,
and choose either the Portrait or Landscape option from the menu.
Selecting paper size
To change the paper size of the printed output, click the Page Layout tab on the
Ribbon, click the Size button, and choose a size from the menu.
Scaling your printed output
The data in a worksheet can span across several columns and down several
rows. Sometimes, you may want to set the number of pages that your data spans
across and down so that you can view more or less data on the printed page.
Alternatively, you may want to scale the printed output to a higher or lower per-
centage of the actual size. To scale your printed output, follow these steps:
1. Click the Page Layout tab on the Ribbon.
2. Do one (or more) of the following:
• To scale the width of the printout to fit within a set number of pages,
choose the number of pages from the Width drop-down list.
• To scale the height of the printout to fit within a set number of pages,
choose the number of pages from the Height drop-down list.
• To scale the printed output to a higher or lower percentage of actual
size, use the Scale spinner arrows to set the percentage or enter a per-
centage value in the spinner box. For this feature to work, you must set
the Width and Height options to automatic.
Specifying the beginning page number
If you intend to insert your printed output into another report, you may want to
specify a beginning page number so that the pages collate correctly as you
insert them into the report. To do so, follow these steps:
1. Select the Page Layout tab on the Ribbon and click the dialog launcher
button at the bottom right of the Page Setup group container. Excel dis-
plays the Page dialog box with the Page tab selected.
2. Specify a page number for the first page in the First Page Number text box.
The default option is set to Auto, which starts numbering at page 1.
3. Click OK to close the Page Setup dialog box.
Changing the Worksheet Display Mode — Controlling Page Settings
139

Handling Page Breaks
If you print multiple-page reports, you know that controlling page breaks is often
important. You normally don’t want a row to print on a page by itself, for exam-
ple. Excel handles page breaks automatically. After you print or preview your
worksheet, Excel displays dashed lines on the worksheet in normal display
mode to indicate where page breaks occur. Sometimes, you want to force a
page break — either a vertical or a horizontal one. If your worksheet consists
of several distinct areas, for example, you may want to print each area on a
separate sheet of paper.
Inserting manual page breaks
To override Excel’s automatic handling of page breaks, you must manually insert
one or more page breaks. To insert a horizontal page break, follow these steps:
1. Move the cell pointer to the row where you want to begin the new page,
but make sure that the cell pointer is in column A. (Otherwise, you insert
a vertical page break and a horizontal page break.)
2. Click the Page Layout tab on the Ribbon, click the Page Break button, and
choose Insert Page Break from the menu. Excel inserts the page break in
the row that is above the cell pointer.
To insert a vertical page break, follow these steps:
1. Move the cell pointer to the column that you want to begin the new page,
but make sure that the cell pointer is in row 1. (Otherwise, you insert a
horizontal page break and a vertical page break).
2. Click the Page Layout tab on the Ribbon, click the Breaks button, and
choose Insert Page Break from the menu. Excel inserts the page break
in the column to the left of the cell pointer.
You can often get a better perspective of where to insert breaks in your work-
sheet by creating your page breaks in the page break preview display mode.
See “Previewing and adjusting page breaks,” later in this section.
Removing manual page breaks
To remove a manual page break, follow these steps:
1. Move the cell pointer anywhere in the first row below a horizontal page
break or in the first column to the right of a vertical page break.
2. Click the Page Layout tab on the Ribbon, click the Breaks button, and
choose Remove Page Break from the menu.
140
Part 9: Printing Your Work

To remove all manual page breaks in the worksheet, click the Page Layout tab on
the Ribbon, click the Breaks button, and choose Reset All Page Breaks from the
menu.
Previewing and adjusting page breaks
Click the Page Break Preview button on the right side of the status bar or click
the Page Break Preview button on the Ribbon’s View tab to enter the page break
preview mode. This mode displays your worksheet in a way that enables you to
move the page breaks by dragging them with your mouse (see Figure 9-2). This
view doesn’t show a true page preview. (For example, it doesn’t show headers
and footers.) But it’s an easy way to make sure that the pages break at desired
locations.
Remember the following points as you use the page break preview mode:
 Excel automatically zooms out so that you can see more on-screen. You
can set the zoom factor to any value that you want by using the zoom con-
trols on the status bar.
 If you specify a print area (rather than the entire worksheet), the print area
appears in white and all the other cells appear in a darker color.
 You can adjust a page break by dragging the line that identifies a break
location.
 In this display mode, Excel shows manual page breaks as solid lines and
automatic breaks as dashed lines.
 While you’re previewing the page breaks, you have full access to all Excel
commands.
Figure 9-2
Handling Page Breaks
141

Remember: If you increase the amount of information to be printed on a page
having a manual break, Excel automatically scales the output to fit the page.
Inserting a Header or Footer
A header is information that appears at the top of each printed page. A footer is
information that appears at the bottom of each printed page.
Headers and footers each have three sections: left, center, and right. You can, for
example, specify a header that consists of your name left-justified, the work-
sheet name centered, and the page number right-justified.
The easiest way to include a header or footer in your printouts is to add the
header or footer in the header and footer regions of the page layout view mode
(see Figure 9-3). Either click the Page Layout View button, on the right side of
the status bar, or click the Page Layout View button on the Ribbon’s View tab to
enter the page layout view mode.
The header and footer regions in the page layout view have the following
characteristics:
 The regions appear immediately above and below the worksheet data area.
 If the header or footer regions are empty, the center section of each region
includes a watermark. The header watermark is labeled Click to add header
and the footer watermark is labeled Click to add footer.
Figure 9-3
142
Part 9: Printing Your Work

 If you hover the mouse pointer over a header or footer section, Excel
shades the section to indicate the area that the section covers. Simply click
in a section to add information.
 By default, the same header and footer appears on each page.
 Excel displays the information in the header or footer area as it would
appear on the printed page.
Remember: By default, Excel doesn’t automatically include a header or footer in
your printouts if you don’t specify any information to include in the header or
footer.
Selecting a predefined header or footer
To select a predefined header or footer, follow these steps:
1. Select the Page Layout View by clicking the Page Layout View button on
the status bar or in the Ribbon’s View tab.
2. Click in a section of the header or footer region. The Ribbon displays the
Header & Footer Tools contextual tab header on Excel’s title bar and
the Design tab below the header.
3. If necessary, click the Design tab to display the header/footer tools on the
Ribbon.
4. Click the Header or Footer button and choose an option from the menu.
5. Click anywhere on the worksheet to remove the display of the
header/footer tools on the Ribbon. Excel inserts the selected header or
footer on the page.
Remember: You can insert the header/footer information on any page of your docu-
ment and Excel will automatically apply the header/footer to all other pages. See
also “Using multiple headers and footers in your reports,” later in this section.
Creating a custom header or footer
To define a custom header or footer, follow these steps:
1. Complete Steps 1 to 3 in “Selecting a predefined header or footer,” imme-
diately preceding in this section.
2. Enter the desired information in any of or all the three sections of the
header or footer; or click any of the eight buttons in the Header and Footer
Elements group (described in the following table) to enter a special code.
Handling Page Breaks — Inserting a Header or Footer 143

After you click away from the section in which you added a code, Excel
converts the code to the actual information that will appear on the
printed page.
3. If you need to format the header or footer text, click the Ribbon’s Home
tab and select from the available tools in the Font group.
4. Click anywhere on the worksheet to remove the display of the
header/footer tools on the Ribbon.
The Format Picture button in the Header and Footer Elements group is available
only if you insert a picture in the header or footer. Clicking this button displays
the Format Picture dialog box, in which you can select options to size, rotate,
scale, crop, and adjust the picture.
You can combine text and codes and insert as many codes as you want into
each section. If the text that you enter uses an ampersand (&), you must enter it
twice (because Excel uses an ampersand to signal a code). For example, to enter
the text Research & Development into a header or footer, type Research &&
Development.
You can use as many lines as you want in your header or footer section. You
may have to adjust the top or bottom margin, however, to prevent the header or
footer from spilling into the worksheet area. Position the mouse pointer where
to want to add another line or wrap an existing line, and press Enter.
Remember: You insert the header/footer information on any page of your docu-
ment and Excel automatically applies the header/footer to all other pages. See
also “Using multiple headers and footers in your reports,” immediately following
this section.
144
Part 9: Printing Your Work

Using multiple headers and footers in your reports
Excel 2007 provides the following options when specifying headers and footers
for different pages in your reports:
 You can specify a different header/footer for the first page. This option is
useful, for example, for reports that require a different header or footer for
a title or table of contents page.
 You can specify a different header/footer for odd and even pages. This
option is useful, for example, if you create book-style reports. If, in addi-
tion, you specify a first page header or footer, Excel will apply the odd page
header or footer starting from the second page of your report.
Follow these steps to add a separate header/footer to the first page or to add
separate headers/footers to odd and even pages of your report:
1. Complete Steps 1 to 3 in “Selecting a predefined header or footer,” earlier
in this section.
2. Do one or both of the following:
• To specify a first page header/footer, select the Different First Page
check box in the Options group of the Header and Footer Design tab.
• To specify odd and even page headers/footers, select the Different
Odd & Even Pages check box in the Options group of the Header and
Footer Design tab.
3. Enter the header or footer information for each page as follows:
• If you specified a separate first page header/footer only, enter the first
page header/footer information in the first page of your document and
enter the header/footer information for all subsequent pages in the
second page of your document.
• If you specified odd and even headers/footers only, enter the
header/footer information for all odd pages in the first page of your
document and enter the header/footer information for all even pages
in the second page of your document.
• If you specified both first page header/footer and odd and even page
headers/footers, enter the first page header/footer information in the
first page of your document, enter the header/footer information for
all odd pages in the second page of your document, and enter the
header/footer information for all even pages in the third page of your
document.
Inserting a Header or Footer
145

Remember: When you click the mouse pointer within a header or footer region,
Excel indicates the type of header/footer you’re working with (normal, first
page, odd page, or even page) above the header or below the footer area.
Previewing Your Work
The Excel print preview feature shows an image of the printed output on your
screen — a handy feature that saves time and paper.
To access the print preview feature, click the Office button, then click the arrow
on the Print option in the menu and choose Print Preview from the right side of
the menu.
Remember: If you work in the page layout view, you will see some but not all
print options — for example, you won’t see the print gridlines, print draft qual-
ity, print black and white, and print error display options. You must use the print
preview feature to preview all your selected print options.
Remember: Unlike the other display modes discussed in this part, you can’t work
in print preview. You can’t enter or edit data, format your data, adjust page
breaks, create charts and so on.
Printing with Quick Print
Quick Print allows you to print the current worksheet using the default print set-
tings. If you changed any of the default print settings, Excel uses the settings
that you entered; otherwise, it uses the following default settings:
 Prints the active worksheet (or all selected worksheets), including any
embedded charts or drawing objects
 Prints one copy
 Prints in portrait mode
 Does not scale the printed output
 Uses 0.75-inch top and bottom margins and 0.7-inch left and right margins
 Does not print a header or footer
 For wide worksheets that span multiple pages, prints down and then over
 Prints to the default printer
146
Part 9: Printing Your Work

To print without changing default settings, click the Office button, click the arrow
at the end of the Print option, and choose Quick Print from the flyout menu.
You can add a button to the Quick Access toolbar that allows you to print with a
single mouse click. Simply click the arrow to the right of the Quick Access tool-
bar and choose Quick Print from the menu. See also “Working with the Quick
Access Toolbar,” in Part 1.
Selecting a Printer
If you have access to more than one printer, you may need to select the correct
printer before printing. To do so, follow these steps:
1. Click the Office button and then click the left portion of the Print option
(the portion with the title). Excel displays the Print dialog box.
2. In the Name drop-down list box, select the printer.
3. Click OK to close the dialog box.
The Print dialog box also lists information about the selected printer, such as its
status and where it is connected.
Setting Sheet Printing Options
In most cases, you want to print the worksheet as displayed on-screen.
Sometimes, however, you may want to control how or what elements get
printed. Excel provides several options that allow you to control the appearance
of your worksheet printouts.
Printing gridlines or row and column headings
Follow these steps to control the printing of gridlines or row and column
headings:
1. Click the Page Layout tab on the Ribbon.
2. Do one or both of the following:
• To print or suppress printing of gridlines, select or deselect the Print
check box under the Gridlines heading in the Sheet Options group.
• To print or suppress printing of row and column headings, select or
deselect the Print check box under the Headings heading in the Sheet
Options group.
Inserting a Header or Footer — Setting Sheet Printing Options 147

Printing row or column data labels on each page
Worksheet data is often set up with labels (titles) in the first row and sometimes
descriptive names in the first column. If such a worksheet requires more than
one page to print, you may find reading subsequent pages difficult because the
text in the first row or first column or both doesn’t print on subsequent pages.
Excel offers an option that allows you to print row and column labels (titles) on
every page.
Follow these steps to select the row or column labels that will appear on each
page:
1. Click the Page Layout tab on the Ribbon and then click the Print Titles
button. Excel displays the Page Setup dialog box with the Sheet tab
selected.
2. Click inside the appropriate box in the Print Titles area, and point to the
row(s) or column(s) in the worksheet that you want to repeat on each
page. You can also enter these references manually. For example, to spec-
ify rows 1 and 2 as repeating rows, enter 1:2.
3. Click OK to close the Page Setup dialog box.
Remember: Don’t confuse print titles with headers; these are two different con-
cepts. Headers appear at the top of each page and contain information such as
the worksheet name, date, or page number. Print titles describe the data that
you’re printing, such as field names in a table.
You can specify different print titles for each worksheet in the workbook. Excel
remembers print titles by creating sheet-level names (Print_Titles).
Selecting miscellaneous sheet printing options
Excel provides some worksheet print options that you might use occasionally.
Follow these steps to access these options:
1. Click the Page Layout tab on the Ribbon and click the dialog launcher
button on the bottom right of the Sheet Options group container. Excel
displays the Page Setup dialog box with the Sheet tab selected.
2. Select among these options:
• Black and White: If you have a colorful worksheet but your printer is
stuck in a monochrome world, you may discover that the worksheet
colors don’t translate well to black and white. In this case, you can use
this option to instruct Excel to ignore the colors while printing.
• Draft Quality: Printing in Draft mode doesn’t print embedded charts
or drawing objects, cell gridlines, or borders. This mode usually
reduces the printing time and is handy for getting a quick printout.
148
Part 9: Printing Your Work

• Comments: If one or more cells in your worksheet have a cell com-
ment, you can print these comments along with the worksheet by
choosing an option from the Comments drop-down list. By default,
comments are not printed.
• Errors: Excel gives you the option to print error values as they appear
on your worksheet or to replace each of the error values with a pre-
defined character in the printed output. Error values include #NUM!,
#DIV/0!, #REF!, #N/A, #VALUE!, #NAME?, and #NULL!. Choose an option
from the Cell Errors As drop-down list. By default, errors are printed
as displayed.
• Page Order: If you have a worksheet that spans across several
columns and down several rows, your worksheet is likely to end up
with multiple vertical page breaks, horizontal page breaks, or both. In
this case, you have the choice of printing your worksheet pages from
left to right or from top to bottom. In the Page Order area, click the
Down, Then Over radio button or the Over, Then Down radio button.
By default, Excel prints down, then over.
3. Click OK to close the Page Setup dialog box.
Setting the Print Area
If you choose to print the active worksheet or multiple sheets, Excel prints the
entire sheet or sheets — or just the range named Print_Area. Each worksheet
can have a range named Print_Area. After you set the print area, Excel automati-
cally creates the Print_Area name. Print_Area is a standard named range, so you
can edit the range’s reference manually if you like.
See also “Editing Names,” in Part 6.
To set the print area, follow these steps:
1. Select the range that you want to print. Press and hold Ctrl to select non-
adjacent ranges.
2. Click the Page Layout tab on the Ribbon, click the Print Area button, and
choose Set Print Area from the menu.
Remember: After you specify a print area, by default Excel uses that print area in
all subsequent printouts. If you want to clear the print area (so that Excel auto-
matically prints the entire worksheet,) click the Print Area button and choose
Clear Print Area from the menu.
Setting Sheet Printing Options — Setting the Print Area 149

If you don’t want to clear the normal print areas you create but occasionally
want to ignore the print areas (to print the entire worksheet) select the Ignore
Print Areas check box in the Print dialog box. To display the Print dialog box,
click the Office button and then click the left portion of the Print option.
Specifying What You Want to Print
Excel gives you several options to determine the range of data in your worksheet
or workbook that is printed. To tell Excel what data to print, follow these steps:
1. Click the Office button and select the left portion of the Print option (the
portion with the title) from the menu. Excel displays the Print dialog box.
2. In the Print What area of the Print dialog box, specify what you want to
print by selecting a radio button. You have the following four options:
• Selection: Prints only the range that you select on the worksheet prior
to displaying the Print dialog box in Step 1. Note that if you select non-
contiguous ranges to print, Excel prints each range on a new sheet
of paper.
• Active Sheet(s): Prints the active sheet or all sheets that you select.
You can select multiple sheets by pressing and holding Ctrl and click-
ing the sheet tabs. If you select multiple sheets, each sheet begins
printing on a new page. This option is Excel’s default print mode.
• Entire Workbook: Prints the entire workbook, including worksheets
and chart sheets.
• Table: This option is available only if you have tables in your
Worksheet. See also Part 11, “Working with Tables.”
3. If you want to print only selected pages of your choice in Step 2, click the
Page(s) option in the Print Range section of the dialog box, and specify
the number of the first and last pages to print. You can use the spinner
controls, or you can type the page numbers in the boxes. Note that you
can select only a contiguous range of pages.
4. Click OK to start printing.

Charting Your Data
A chart (also known as a graph outside Excel circles) is a way to present a table
of numbers visually. The visual display allows you, for example, to quickly exam-
ine trends or compare the relative contributions of various items. Excel provides
you with the tools to create a variety of charts.

you can include in the chart. Figure 10-1 illustrates the most common elements
that a chart can contain. When you create a chart, include only the elements you
need to clearly portray your data. Too much information will make the chart
hard to read and reduce its usefulness.
The following is a description of the elements shown in Figure 10-1:
 Horizontal axis: For most charts, this axis displays category labels. A cate-
gory is any item without numerical significance. Month, Quarter, and
Product are examples of categories. For a Month category, the labels might
be Jan, Feb, Mar, and so on. The chart displays the labels at equally spaced
intervals on the axis. For the bar, X Y scatter, and bubble chart types, the
horizontal axis displays a value scale. A chart can have a primary horizon-
tal axis and a secondary horizontal axis.

Part 10: Charting Your Data

 Horizontal axis title: Displays a name for the category plotted.
 Vertical axis: For most charts, this axis displays a value scale for the data
series plotted. For the bar chart type, the vertical axis displays category
labels. A chart can have a primary vertical axis and a secondary vertical
axis.
 Vertical axis title: Displays a name for the value scale against which the
series is plotted.
 Data series: A group of values associated with a category. For example,
projected sales and actual sales might be two series associated with a
Month category.
 Data point: A value associated with a category label. For example, pro-
jected and actual sales figures plotted for January represent data points.
 Data labels: Labels associated with the data points on the chart. For exam-
ple the labels can be the values of data points.
 Data table: The data series represented in tabular form and placed directly
below the horizontal axis.
 Chart title: A title that you provide for the chart.
 Legend: A group of keys and text identifying each data series in the chart.
 Gridlines: Lines placed on the chart to assist in reading the value of data
points or to segregate category labels. Gridlines can be distracting and
therefore should be used sparingly. If you must use gridlines, we suggest
that you choose a pale and unobtrusive color for the line.
 Tick marks: These mark off intervals on an axis.
 Plot area: The area of the chart, defined by the axes boundaries, where the
data series is plotted.
 Chart area: The entire area that includes all elements within the chart.
Activating a Chart
Before you can do anything with a chart, you must activate it, as follows:
 To activate a chart on a chart sheet, click the chart sheet’s tab.
 To activate a chart that you embed in a worksheet, click the chart border
area.
Anatomy of a Chart — Activating a Chart
153

After you activate an embedded chart or a chart on a chart sheet, Excel displays
the Chart Tools contextual tabs on the Ribbon. Double-clicking the chart auto-
matically displays the Design tab tools on the Ribbon.
Adding a New Data Series to a Chart
Follow these steps to add a new data series to a chart:
1. Activate the chart, click the Design contextual tab and then click the
Select Data button. Excel displays the Select Data Source dialog box 
(see Figure 10-2).
2. Click the Add button. Excel displays the Edit Series dialog box.
3. If the reference in the Series Name box is incorrect, clear the default entry
and either type a name for the series or click the cell on the worksheet
containing the series name. You can also leave the box blank.
4. If the reference in the Series Values box is incorrect, clear the default
entry and select the series data range on the worksheet.
5. Click OK to return to the Select Data Source dialog box. The new series
name (or a generic title if you didn’t include a name in Step 3) appears in
the legend entries window. In the window on the right side of the dialog
box, Excel displays numbered category labels for the series. You can
ignore these labels — Excel simply adds the new series to the chart using
the existing category labels.
6. Click OK.
Figure 10-2
154
Part 10: Charting Your Data

Another way to add a new data series to a chart is to select the range that you
want to add (including any label for the series name), and click the Copy button
on the Ribbon’s Home tab. Then activate the chart, click the arrow on the Paste
button, and choose Paste Special from the menu. Excel responds by opening the
Paste Special dialog box. Complete the information in this dialog box to corre-
spond to the data you selected.
Adding a Title to a Chart
The chart title normally appears at the top of the chart. When you create a
chart, you can select a layout that includes a chart title box. To add a title to an
existing chart, follow these steps:
1. Activate the chart and click the Layout tab to display the chart layout
tools on the Ribbon.
2. Click the Chart Title button, and then choose an option from the menu.
Excel adds a chart title box to the chart.
3. Click in the title box and type a title for the chart.
4. If you want to format the chart title, you can use the standard formatting
options in the Font Group of the Ribbon’s Home tab or you can use special
WordArt and other formatting options in the Format tab.
Changing the Axes for a Data Series
Sometimes, you may want to plot two or more series that vary considerably in
scale, such as Revenue and Profit. If you plot both series using the same axis,
the profit figures will not appear clearly on the chart. In such cases, you can plot
the revenue figures on the primary vertical axis (the default) and the profit fig-
ures on the secondary vertical axis (see Figure 10-1.)
Follow these steps to plot a data series on the secondary axis:
1. Select the series on the chart that will be plotted on the secondary axis.
See “Selecting a Chart Element.” later in this part.
2. Access the Format dialog box for the data series. See “Formatting a Chart
Element,” later in this part.
3. In the Plot Series On area of the Format Data Series dialog box, select the
Secondary Axis option and then click Close. The secondary value axis
appears on the chart. By default, Excel does not display the secondary
category axis.
Activating a Chart — Changing the Axes for a Data Series 155

4. If you need to make adjustments to the primary or secondary axis, click
the Layout tab, click the Axes button, click the axis you want to adjust,
and choose an axis option from the flyout menu. See also “Modifying a
Chart Axis,” later in this part.
Remember: When you plot a series on the secondary axes, the series appears
over the series plotted on the primary axes. Depending on the chart type you
select, the series plotted on the secondary axis can obscure part or all of the
series plotted on the primary axis if you are not careful.
Changing the Chart Type for an 
Existing Chart or Data Series
Excel supports a wide variety of chart types (line charts, column charts, and so
on). After you create a chart, you might decide that a different chart type would
better portray the data. You can even create a combination chart by selecting a
different chart type for a data series. You can, for example, create a chart with
one data series plotted as a line chart type and another data series plotted as a
column chart type (see Figure 10-1).
To change the chart type for an existing chart or to change the chart type for a
data series on a chart, follow these steps:
1. Activate the chart and click the Design tab to display the chart design
tools on the Ribbon.
2. To change the chart type for the chart (this is, for all data series in the
chart), click the Change Chart Type button. To change the chart type for a
single data series, select the data series before clicking the Change Chart
Type button. Excel displays the Change Chart Type dialog box.
3. In the list on the left, choose a chart type. Then in the gallery on the right,
choose a chart subtype.
4. Click OK.
Creating a Chart
Creating professional looking charts is easier to do in Excel 2007 than in earlier
versions. Excel 2007 provides several professionally designed layout and format-
ting gallery options that you can apply without having to start from scratch.
Follow these steps to chart your data:
156
Part 10: Charting Your Data

1. Select the data you want to chart, including any row and column labels
(for category and series name identification).
2. Click the Insert tab on the Ribbon and then click a Chart Type button in
the Charts group. Excel displays a chart subtype gallery.
3. Choose a subtype from the gallery. If you hover the mouse pointer over a
chart type button or chart subtype gallery option, Excel displays a
ScreenTip that provides assistance on how you can use the particular
chart type or subtype.
After you choose a subtype, Excel creates a chart and displays the chart
tools contextual tabs on the Ribbon and a header on the Excel title bar
above the tabs. Excel automatically displays the tools for the Design tab
on the ribbon (see Figure 10-3).
4. If the layout of elements on the chart that Excel creates isn’t what you
want, choose a new layout from the Chart Layouts gallery. Use the upper
arrows on the right side of the gallery to scroll the gallery display or the
bottom arrow to display the entire gallery. Each layout includes a combi-
nation of elements for the chart. If you choose a layout that includes a
chart title, click in the title box and type a title for the chart.
5. If required, select a new style for the chart from the Chart Styles gallery.
Use the upper arrows on the right side of the gallery to scroll the gallery
display or the bottom arrow to display the entire gallery. The styles in the
gallery are based on the theme currently applied in the workbook, so if
you change the theme, the styles change to match the new theme. See
also “Formatting with Themes,” in Part 1.
Figure 10-4 illustrates some important rules that Excel applies when creating a
chart:
 If the data you’re charting contains more rows than columns, Excel uses the
row data to create the category axis. The row labels are used for category
labels and the column labels are used for series names (in Figure 10-4, see
the data range A1:D13 and the resultant chart on the right of the range.)
Figure 10-3
Changing the Axes for a Data Series — Creating a Chart
157

If the row labels are missing or not included in the range, Excel labels the
category axis with numbers. If, in addition, the column labels are missing
or not included in the range, Excel names the series as Series 1, Series 2,
and so on. (In Figure 10-4, see the data range A15:C26 and the resultant
chart on the right of the range.)
 If the data you’re charting contains more columns than rows, or an equal
number of columns and rows, Excel uses the column data to create the cat-
egory axis. The column labels are used for category labels and the row
labels are used for series names (in Figure 10-4, see the data range N1:Q3
and the resultant chart at the bottom of the range).
 If the data you’re charting contains only one series, Excel includes a chart
title with the same name as the series name, assuming that a row or
column label is available for the series name (as per the first rule).
Remember: You can reverse Excel’s category and series name choices after the
chart is created by activating the chart and clicking the Switch Row/Column
button on the Design tab.
Creating and Using a Chart Template
A chart template is a standard chart (or combination chart) customized in a spe-
cific manner. You can subsequently use the template to create new charts. To
customize a chart that you can save as a template, following these steps:
Figure 10-4
158
Part 10: Charting Your Data

1. Create a chart that’s customized the way you want. For example, you can
set colors or line styles, modify fonts and type sizes, add 3-D and shadow
effects, and add a title.
2. Activate the chart and click the Design tab to display the chart design
tools on the Ribbon.
3. Click the Save as Template button. Excel displays the Save Chart Template
dialog box.
4. In the File Name box, enter a filename.
5. Click Save.
The template appears in the Templates category of the Change Chart Type dialog
box (accessed by clicking the Change Chart Type button in the Design tab). After
you select the Templates category, the new chart appears in the My Templates
gallery on the right side of the dialog box. If you hover the mouse pointer over
the chart, a ScreenTip displays the chart name you supplied in Step 4.
To use a template, see “Creating a Chart,” earlier in this part, and choose the
template from the Templates category.
Displaying a Data Table in a Chart
In Excel, you can display a table of the data that you use in the chart. The data
table appears below the chart (see Figure 10-1). When you create a chart, you
can select a layout that includes a data table.
To add a data table to an existing chart, follow these steps:
1. Activate the chart and click the Layout tab to display the chart layout
tools on the Ribbon.
2. Click the Data Table button and choose an option from the menu. The
data table appears below the chart.
3. To explore additional formatting options for the data table, choose More
Data Table Options from the menu. Excel displays the Format Data Table
dialog box.
4. Make your selections from the various formatting options and click OK.
Creating a Chart — Displaying a Data Table in a Chart 159

Displaying Data Labels in a Chart
Sometimes you want your chart to display the data value for each point on the
chart (see Figure 10-1). Or you want to display the category label for each data
point. When you create a chart, you can select a layout that includes data labels.
To add data labels to a chart series, follow these steps:
1. Activate the chart and click the Layout tab to display the chart layout
tools on the Ribbon.
2. Click one of the data points in the series. This action selects the entire
data series.
After you select the entire series, be careful not to click a data point
because this action selects only a single data point. If you do accidentally
select a single data point, click anywhere outside the data series and
repeat this step.
3. Click the Data Labels button and choose an option from the menu. The
data labels appear on the chart.
4. To explore additional formatting options for the data labels:
a. Choose More Data Label Options from the menu. Excel displays the
Format Data Labels dialog box.
b. Make your selections from the various formatting options.
c. Click OK.
Remember: The data labels are linked to the worksheet, so if your data changes,
the labels change too. To override the data label with some other text, select the
label and enter the new text (or even a cell reference) in the formula bar.
If Excel doesn’t position the data labels correctly, you can select an individual
label and drag it to a better location. To select an individual label, click the label
twice.
Formatting a Chart Element
You can modify the elements in a chart in several ways. For example, you can
change colors, line widths, and fonts. You make modifications in the Format
dialog box, which varies for each type of chart element.
160
Part 10: Charting Your Data

To modify an element in a chart, follow these steps:
1. Select the chart element. See “Selecting a Chart Element,” later in this
part.
2. Access the Format dialog box for the chart element that you selected by
using any of the following techniques:
• Click the Format tab on the Ribbon and select a chart element from
the Chart Elements drop-down list in the Current Selection group.
Then click the Format Selection button below the Chart Elements list.
• Right-click the element, and choose Format Item Name from the con-
textual menu that appears, where Item Name is the name of the chart
element you select, such as Data Series, Gridlines, or Axis.
• Press Ctrl+1 (that is, Ctrl and the number 1).
3. Choose the option on the left side of the dialog box that corresponds to
what you want to do.
4. Make the changes by selecting the appropriate options on the right side of
the dialog box. For help on an option, click the Help button (the question
mark) in the dialog box.
5. Click OK.
Remember: You can change the color of some element parts — for example, the
fill color or line color. You can select a theme color or a non-theme color. If you
choose a theme color, the color changes if you change the workbook theme. If
you choose a non-theme color, the color does not change if you change the
workbook theme. See also “Formatting with Themes,” in Part 1.
Handling Missing Data or Charting Hidden Data
Sometimes, data that you’re charting may be missing one or more data points.
Also, by default, Excel does not include data in hidden rows and columns within
the data range you’re charting. Excel offers several options for handling the
missing data and allows you to chart hidden data in a range. Just follow these
steps:
1. Activate the chart and click the Design tab to display the chart design
tools on the Ribbon.
2. Click the Select Data button. Excel displays the Select Data Source
dialog box.
Displaying Data Labels in a Chart — Handling Missing Data or Charting Hidden Data 161

3. Click the Hidden and Empty Cells button. Excel displays the Hidden and
Empty Cell Settings dialog box.
4. Select the option that corresponds to how you want to handle the missing
data:
• Gaps: Excel ignores missing data, and the data series leaves a gap for
each missing data point. This is the default setting.
• Zero: Excel treats missing data as zero.
• Connect Data Points with Line: Excel calculates missing data by using
data on either side of the missing point(s). This option is available
only for line charts and some X Y scatter chart subtypes.
5. If you want to chart hidden data within the chart’s source data range,
select the Show Data in Hidden Rows and Columns check box.
6. Click OK to exit the Hidden and Empty Cell Settings dialog box, and click
OK again to exit the Select Data Source dialog box.
Remember: The options that you set apply to the entire active chart; you can’t
set a different option for different series in the same chart.
Inserting and Modifying Chart Legends
A legend explains the data series in a chart. A legend consists of text and keys. 
A key is a small graphic that corresponds to the chart’s series.
Adding a legend to a chart
When you create a chart, you can select a layout that includes a legend (see
Figure 10-1). If you don’t include a legend as you create the chart, you can add
one later. To add a legend to an existing chart, follow these steps:
1. Activate the chart and click the Layout tab to display the chart layout
tools on the Ribbon.
2. Click the Legend button and choose an option from the menu. Excel dis-
plays the legend on the chart.
Changing the names (titles) on a chart legend
If you don’t include row or column titles with the source data when you create a
chart, Excel displays the default names (titles) Series 1, Series 2, and so on in the
legend. To change the default names, follow these steps:
162
Part 10: Charting Your Data

1. Activate the chart and click the Design tab to display the chart design
tools on the Ribbon.
2. Click the Select Data button. You can also right-click the border area of the
chart and choose Select Data from the contextual menu. Excel displays
the Select Data Source dialog box.
3. Choose one of the Series 1, Series 2 and so on names in the Legend Entries
(Series) window, and then click the Edit button above the series name.
Excel displays the Edit Series dialog box.
4. Clear the entry in the Series Name box and either type a new name or
point to a worksheet cell containing the name you want to use. Click OK to
add the name and return to the Select Data Source dialog box.
5. Repeat Step 4 for each series that you want to rename.
6. Click OK to exit the Select Data Source dialog box.
Modifying a Chart Axis
After you create a chart, you may want the modify the value axis to change the
scale, add an axis title, modify the tick mark display, add display units, and so
on. Or you may want to modify the category axis to, for example, add a title,
modify the tick marks, or change where the axis crosses the value axis.
Follow these steps to modify a chart axis:
1. Activate the chart and click the Layout tab to display the chart layout
tools on the Ribbon.
2. Click the Axes button and choose a Horizontal Axis or Vertical Axis
option, depending on which axis you want to modify. After you chose an
axis option, a flyout menu appears.
3. If one of the standard options on the flyout menu is what you want,
choose the option, and you’ve finished the procedure. Otherwise, con-
tinue at Step 4.
4. If none of the standard flyout menu options are what you want, choose
More <Axis> Options at the bottom of the flyout menu, where <Axis> is the
horizontal or vertical axis. Excel displays the Format Axis dialog box.
5. On the right side of the dialog box, select the axis options you want to
change. For help, click the help button (the question mark at the top-right
of the dialog box).
Handling Missing Data or Charting Hidden Data — Modifying a Chart Axis
163

You may have to experiment with the options to get what you want. You
can always undo your selections (by clicking the undo button on the
Quick Access toolbar) and start over if your chart doesn’t show the
expected results.
6. If you want to modify the axis formatting (number, fill, line, and so on),
select one or more of the options in the list on the left side of the dialog
box and select the appropriate options on the right.
7. Click OK when you are finished making your selections.
To add a title to an axis, activate the chart, select the Layout tab and click the
Axis titles button. Choose an axis from the menu and choose a title option from
the flyout menu. After Excel displays the axis title box on the chart, click in the
box and enter a title.
Resizing, Moving, Copying, and 
Deleting an Embedded Chart
To resize an embedded chart, follow these steps:
1. Activate the chart.
2. Drag one of the eight resize handles (a series of dots) on the chart border
to change the size of the element. When you hover the mouse pointer
over a resize handle or when you drag the resize handle, the pointer
changes into a black line with arrows on both ends.
You can move the embedded chart to a different location on the worksheet or
you can make a copy of the chart on the worksheet:
 To move a chart, first activate it. Then click the border of the chart
between the resize handles, and drag the chart to the desired location in
the worksheet. When you hover the mouse pointer over a border or when
you drag the border, the pointer changes into a white arrow with a black
cross on the arrow’s tip.
 To copy a chart, activate it. Then press and hold down the Ctrl key while
dragging the chart. You can also use the Copy and Paste buttons on the
Ribbon’s Home tab or press Ctrl+C to copy and Ctrl+V to paste.
 To move the embedded chart to a separate chart sheet, select the chart,
click the Design tab, and then click the Move Chart button. Specify the new
location in the Move Chart dialog box, and click OK. A chart sheet typically
contains a single chart that is linked to the data in the worksheet.
To delete a chart, activate the chart and press the Delete key.
164
Part 10: Charting Your Data

Resizing, Moving, and Deleting a Chart Element
You can resize the following chart elements: any of the titles, the data labels, the
legend, and the plot area. To resize a chart element, follow these steps:
1. Select the chart element that you want to resize.
2. Drag a resize handle (a square box or a circle) on the element border to
change the size of the element. When you hover the mouse pointer over a
resize handle, the pointer changes to a double-headed arrow. Clicking the
mouse to drag the handle changes the pointer to a cross.
You can move the titles, the data labels, and the legend within the chart area. To
move a chart element, follow these steps:
1. Select the chart element that you want to move.
2. Click the border of the element between the resize handles, and drag the
element to the desired location in the chart. When you hover the mouse
pointer over a border or when you drag the border, the pointer changes to
a cross with an arrow on each end.
You can delete any element in a chart, including a data series. To delete a chart
element, follow these steps:
1. Select the element that you want to delete.
2. Press the Delete key.
See also “Selecting a Chart Element,” immediately following this section.
Selecting a Chart Element
Modifying an element in a chart is similar to everything else that you do in
Excel: First you make a selection — in this case, select a chart element — and
then you issue a command to do something with the selection.
You can select a chart element in any of the following three ways:
 Click the chart element. If the element is a series, clicking the series once
selects all the points in the series. Clicking the series twice selects individ-
ual points in the series.
 Press the up-arrow or down-arrow key to cycle through all the elements in
the chart. If a data series is selected, you can press the right-arrow or left-
arrow key to select individual points in the series.
Modifying a Chart Axis — Selecting a Chart Element
165

 Click the Format tab on the Ribbon and select a chart element from the
Chart Elements drop-down list (located above the Format Selection
button) in the Current Selection group.
If you move the mouse pointer over a chart element, a ScreenTip displays the
name of the element. If the element is a data point, the ScreenTip displays the
value. The ScreenTip is useful in ensuring that you’re selecting the intended 
element.
Updating the Source Data Range 
for a Chart or a Data Series
Often, you create a chart that uses a particular range of data, and then you
extend the data range by adding new data in the worksheet. If you add new data
to a range, the data series in the chart doesn’t update to include the new data.
Or you may delete some of the data in a range that you used to create the chart.
If you delete data from a range, by default the chart displays the deleted data as
zero values.
To update the entire chart to reflect the new data range, follow these steps:
1. Activate the chart, and then click the Design tab to display the chart
design tools on the Ribbon.
2. Click the Select Data button. Excel displays the Select Data Source dialog
box.
3. In the Chart Data Range box, manually edit the source data reference or
clear the box and use the mouse pointer to select the new range on the
worksheet.
4. Click OK, and Excel updates the chart with the new data range.
If you need to update the range for a single data series on the chart, follow these
steps:
1. Activate the chart, and then click the Design tab to display the chart
design tools on the Ribbon.
2. Click the Select Data button. Excel displays the Select Data Source
dialog box.
166
Part 10: Charting Your Data

3. Select the series name of the series you want to modify in the Legend
Entries (Series) window, and click the Edit button above the window.
Excel displays the Edit Series dialog box.
4. In the Series Values box, manually edit the source data reference, or clear
the box and use the mouse pointer to select the new range on the work-
sheet. Click OK to return to the Select Data Source dialog box.
5. If necessary, modify the range for category labels. Click the Edit button
under Horizontal (Categories) Axis Labels to display the Axis Labels
dialog box. In the Axis Label Range box, manually edit the category labels
reference, or clear the box and select the new range on the worksheet.
6. Click OK, and Excel updates the chart with the new data range.
After you activate a chart, Excel outlines in the worksheet the ranges that the
chart uses. To extend or reduce the range of the entire chart, simply drag an
outline handle (a small square box on the corner of the outline). To extend or
reduce the range of a data series, select the data series in the chart and drag an
outline handle.
A better way to handle data ranges that change is to convert the range to a
table. After you add or remove data from a table, the chart created from the
range (either before or after you convert the range to a table) updates automati-
cally. See also Part 11, “Working with Tables.”
Using and Changing the Default Chart Type
The default chart is the type that Excel creates if you don’t specify the type.
Excel’s default chart type is a 2-D clustered column chart that uses Layout 11
from the Chart Layouts gallery and Style 13 from the Chart Styles gallery. To use
the default chart type after selecting your source data, do one of the following:
 To create the default chart on the worksheet (an embedded chart),
press Alt+F1.
 To create the default chart on a chart sheet, press F11.
If you often use a different type of chart, you may want to change the default
type as follows:
1. Activate the chart and click the Design tab to display the chart design
tools on the Ribbon.
Selecting a Chart Element — Using and Changing the Default 167

2. Click the Change Chart Type button. Excel displays the Change Chart
Type dialog box.
3. Choose a chart type in the list on the left and choose a chart subtype in
the gallery on the right.
4. Click the Set as Default Chart button and then click OK. The new default
chart will be used for all default charts in all workbooks.
You can also use a chart template as a default chart type. See “Creating and
Using a Chart Template,” earlier in this part.

Part 10: Charting Your Data

Working with Tables
A table is structure that allows you to conveniently analyze data and generate
professional looking reports. Data for the table can be entered manually, copied
from another worksheet (in the same or different workbook in which you create
the table), or imported from external sources such as a text file, the Web, an
XML file, or a database file.

Part 11

Anatomy of a Table
The table feature included in Excel 2007 (see Figure 11-1) is an extension of the
list feature found in earlier versions of Excel. Excel 2007 provides many conven-
ient tools that allow you to analyze data in a table and generate professional
looking reports. For example, you can easily sort and filter data, format the table
using a gallery of styles, add rows, add a totals row, add formula columns, and
create charts and PivotTables that automatically update after rows are added or
removed. You create the data for the table manually, copy the data from a work-
sheet, link the data from a worksheet or a different workbook, or import the data
from an external source. If the data in your worksheet is arranged like that
shown in Figure 11-1 — that is, a list of information — consider converting the
list to a table to take advantage of a table’s many convenient features. See also
“Creating a Table,” later in this part.

 Table area: The header row, data rows, and optional totals row.
 Header row: Names shared by all data rows — for example, Customer
Name, Order ID, and Unit Price.
 Data row: Specific information derived from the columns in the header
row, such as transaction information (for example, details of sales), cus-
tomer data, or product data.
 Totals row: Allows you to perform a calculation (such as Sum, Average, or
Count) on any column of data.
Tables often contain more rows that can be displayed simultaneously on the
screen. If the cell pointer is within the table and you scroll the worksheet so that
the header row is no longer displayed in the worksheet window, the header
titles appear in the column header area (see Figure 11-1). See also “Familiarizing
Yourself with the Excel 2007 Window,” in Part 1.
Converting a Table to a Range
If you no longer need to work with a table, you can convert the table to a normal
range. Right-click in the table and choose Table➪Convert to Range from the con-
textual menu or click anywhere in the table and then click Convert to Range in
the Table Tools Design tab.
Creating a Table
You can create a table from a data range that is set up with a header row. If your
range does not include a header row, you should add one. See also Part 4,
“Entering and Editing Worksheet Data.” Follow these steps to create a table from
a range:
1. Select any cell in the range.
2. Click the Insert tab on the Ribbon and then click the Table button (or
press Ctrl+L). Excel displays the Create Table dialog box and selects the
entire contiguous range that includes the active cell pointer.
3. Click OK. Excel creates the table, applies a default style, and adds a sort
and filter arrow to the cells in the header row. Excel also displays the
Table Tools Design tab on the Ribbon.
Anatomy of a Table — Creating a Table
171

Filtering Data in a Table
Filtering data is one of the most common activities performed with a table.
Often, you want to view or analyze a subset of the data in a large dataset. When
Excel creates a table, it includes a sort and filter drop-down arrow to the right of
each column header. After you filter your table, the status bar displays the
number of rows visible.
Remember: You can use Excel’s filtering features in a standard (non-table) range.
Select the range, click the Sort & Filter button on the Ribbon’s home tab, and
choose Filter from the menu to add the sort and filter drop-down arrows to the
header row. A worksheet can have only one sort and filter range but can have
many tables, each with its own sort and filter settings.
Remember: If your table data was imported from an external range, your table fil-
ters and sort orders are normally reapplied after you refresh the range (import
the latest data). If you add data rows manually, however, you must click the Sort
& Filter button in the Ribbon’s Home tab and then choose Reapply from the
menu before Excel will update the table.
Filtering based on individual column entries
Follow these steps to filter your table data based on the individual entries in a
column:
1. Click the arrow on the header of the column you want to filter. Excel dis-
plays the Sort and Filter menu (see Figure 11-2).
2. The lower portion of the menu displays the unique column entries in a
window. By default, Excel selects all entries. If you want to display rows
Figure 11-2
172
Part 11: Working with Tables

for one or only a few entries, clear the Select All check box and individu-
ally select the items you want displayed. Alternatively, if you want to hide
rows for only a few entries, clear the check boxes next to these entries but
do not clear the Select All check box.
The ability to select multiple column entries is new in Excel 2007. Also,
the list can display up to 10,000 unique entries (compared with 1000
entries in earlier versions of Excel).
3. Click OK. In the table, Excel displays rows for all the entries you selected
in Step 2 and hides all rows for the cleared entries. If your table uses an
alternative row-banding style, the banding is preserved after you filter
table rows. Excel also adds a filter icon (a small funnel) on the column
drop-down to indicate that a filter is applied to the column.
4. To filter additional columns, repeat Steps 2 and 3.
If your column has a series of date entries (month, day, year), Excel allows you
to filter at the year, month, or day levels. In the column items list window, only
the year level is listed initially. If you click the plus sign (+) next to a year, the
months for that year are listed. Clicking the plus sign next to the month displays
individual day entries for that month.
Filtering based on column data type
Suppose you have a table column that contain dates. But instead of filtering the
column based on individual dates, you want to display dates for the current
month, last month, last quarter, or year to date. Or suppose you have a numeric
column and want to display records exceeding a certain value or lying between
two values. Or perhaps you have a text column and you want to display records
that begin with certain text or contain certain text. Excel 2007 provides many fil-
tering options that you can apply based on the type of data you have in a
column.
To filter a table data based on date, number, or text criteria, follow these steps:
1. Click the arrow on the header of the column you want to filter. Excel dis-
plays the filter and sort menu.
2. Immediately above the window that displays individual column entries,
choose the datatype Filters option (where datatype is Text, Number, or
Date, depending on the data type of the column you’re filtering).
3. Choose a specific filter option from the flyout menu or choose Custom
Filter at the bottom of the menu to display a dialog box that offers addi-
tional options.
4. If your choice in Step 3 displays a dialog box, complete the dialog box
options and click OK.
Filtering Data in a Table
173

Filtering based on cell color
Excel 2007 allows you to filter by cell color. Colors are cell background or font
colors applied manually or by conditional formatting. Colors can also include
color scales and icon sets. See also “Formatting based on cell or column con-
tent,” later in this part.
Remember: You can filter by only one color at a time.
To filter your table data based on color formatting, follow these steps:
1. Click the arrow on the header of the column with the color formatting you
want to filter. Excel displays the Sort and Filter menu.
2. Choose Filter by Color, and then choose a color option from the flyout
menu. You can also choose the No Fill option to filter out all cells with font
or background formatting.
Remember: Colors for filtering do not include colors defined in the table style, so
your table formatting is preserved after color filtering.
Formatting a Table
When you create a table, Excel applies a default style to the table. However, you
can apply a different predefined style to the table or create a style from scratch.
You can also apply formatting based on the contents or a cell or table column.
Applying a new style to a table
Excel identifies the following specific areas in a table that you can format auto-
matically and independently: the header row, data rows, totals row, first column,
and last column. Follow these steps to apply a new style to a table:
1. Click any cell in the table and then click the Design tab.
2. Select a new style from the Table Styles gallery. You can scroll the gallery
options by clicking the upper (scroll) arrows on the right side of the
gallery, or you can display a drop-down grid by clicking the arrow below
the scroll arrows. You can preview a style by hovering the mouse pointer
over a style. Click a style option to apply a style.
3. In addition, or as an alternative, to Step 2, you can select style and display
options from the Table Style Options group. Click to select or deselect the
appropriate check boxes.
174
Part 11: Working with Tables

Remember: The styles you apply from the Table Styles gallery are based on the
theme applied to the workbook. Therefore, if you change the workbook theme,
both the table style and gallery styles change to match the new theme. See also
“Formatting with Themes,” in Part 1.
Formatting based on cell or column content
Formatting a table based on the contents of a cell or column contents (condi-
tional formatting) is similar to formatting a non-table cell or range based on the
contents of the cell or range. See “Formatting Based on the Contents of a Cell or
Range,” and “Formatting a Range Using Visualizations,” both in Part 8. However,
note the following when you apply conditional formatting to a table:
 For all formatting options except those involving visualizations, there is an
option to format the corresponding table row when the format condition(s)
in a cell(s) is true.
 If you apply conditional formatting to an entire column, the formatting for
the column is automatically extended if you add new rows to the table.
 Formatting is applied to a table in the following order: direct formatting
(for example, formatting you apply from the Font group in the Ribbon’s
Home tab) appears over table style formatting and conditional formatting
appears over direct formatting.
Inserting a Totals Row in a Table
When you create a table, by default Excel does not include the totals row.
However, if you need to total data in your table columns, you can add a totals
row easily. Make sure that the cell pointer is in the table range, click the Design
tab, and select the Totals Row check box in the Table Style Options group.
After you click the mouse pointer in a cell of the totals row, Excel adds a drop-
down arrow to the cell. Clicking the arrow displays a convenient list of common
functions you can apply (Sum, Average, Count, Standard Deviation, and so on).
You can also enter any formula you want.
Inserting and Deleting Table Rows and Columns
You may need to insert new rows into a table to add data. Also, you may want to
add a column to perform a calculation based on other columns in the table.
Excel provides convenient methods for inserting rows and columns. You can
also delete table rows and columns you no longer need.
Filtering Data in a Table — Inserting and Deleting Table Rows and Columns
175

Adding and deleting table rows
Choose one of the following methods to rows to a table:
 To add a row above an existing table row (including the totals row), right-
click a cell in the existing table row and choose Insert➪Table Rows Above.
If you right-click a cell in the last data row, you can add a row above or
below the last row.
 If you use the Tab key to move to the next column when entering data in a
row, Excel adds a new row automatically after you press the Tab key in the
rightmost column of the last data row.
 If a blank row is immediately below the last data row, you can enter data in
any cell in the blank row and Excel will add the row to the table. Table for-
matting (normal and conditional) and any column formulas are extended
to include the new row.
To delete a table row, right-click any cell in the row and choose Delete➪Table
Rows from the contextual menu. To delete multiple rows, select the rows, right-
click within the selection and choose Delete➪Table Rows.
Adding and deleting table columns
Choose one of the following methods to add columns to a table:
 To add a column to the left of an existing table column, right-click a cell in
the existing table column, and then choose Insert➪Table Columns to the
Left from the contextual menu. If you right-click a cell in the rightmost
table column, you can add a column to the left or right of the rightmost
column. Excel provides a generic title for the column header that you can
change to a more meaningful name.
 If a blank column is immediately to the right of the rightmost column, you
can enter data in any cell in the blank column and Excel will add the
column to the table. The table formatting is extended to the new column.
To delete a table column, right-click any cell in the column and choose Delete➪
Table Columns from the contextual menu. To delete multiple columns, select the
columns, right-click within the selection, and choose Delete➪Table Columns.
Remember: You cannot add individual cells to or remove individual cells from a
table. You can add or remove only entire rows or entire columns.
176
Part 11: Working with Tables

Referencing Table Data in a Formula
When you create a table, Excel provides a generic name for the table (Table1,
Table2 and so on). If you intend to reference table data in a formula, you should
change the name to something more descriptive, such as SalesData. To change
Excel’s default table name, select any cell within the table, click the Design tab
on the Ribbon, and enter a new name in the Table Name text box. Excel also
allows you to use column name references in formulas. The following rules
apply to table and column names:
 The table name must be different from any other names you create in the
workbook and must follow Excel’s name creation rules. See also Part 6,
“Creating and Using Names.”
 Column names must be unique within the table, although different tables
can have the same column names.
 If a table name or column name changes, formulas that reference the name
automatically update to include the new name.
 Excel updates table and column name references automatically as rows
and columns are added or removed from the table.
Remember: You can save time entering table name references in a formula by
using the Formula AutoComplete feature, which lists the names. See also
“Entering formulas manually,” in Part 4.
Referencing table data outside the table
When you reference table data in a formula that’s outside the table range, the
reference must include the table name. Use the following methods to reference
table data in a formula:
 To reference all the data in the table, use the table name. If you want to
sum all the data in a table named SalesData, for example, enter
=SUM(SalesData)
 To reference the data in a table column, use the table name and a column
qualifier in the form TableName[ColumnName]. For example, if you want to
sum a column named Quarter1 in a table named SalesData, enter
=SUM(SalesData[Quarter1])
Inserting and Deleting Table Rows and Columns — Referencing Table Data in a Formula
177

 Other table references are useful for some types of lookup formulas. To ref-
erence an entire table, use the form TableName[#All]. To reference table
headers only, use the form TableName[#Headers]. To reference an entire
column (header and data) use the form TableName[[#All], [ColumnName].
To reference just the header text of a column, use TableName [[#Headers],
[ColumnName]].
Referencing table data using a calculated column
A calculated column (sometimes called a calculated field), is simply a column you
add to the table that references table data in a formula. The formula references
are similar to those described in “Referencing table data outside the table,”
except that the table name is not required because the calculated column is part
of the table. Follow these steps to add a calculated column and add a formula:
1. Add a new column to the table. See “Inserting and Deleting Table Rows
and Columns,” earlier in this part.
2. Enter a formula that references the table in any cell of the new column.
You can enter the formula manually or by pointing with the mouse. For
example, if you have a table named SalesData and you want to calculate
the difference between the sales figures in columns named Quarter1 and
Quarter2, enter
=[Quarter1]-[Quarter2]
See Figure 11-3. You can use the Formula AutoComplete drop-down list to
help speed up your entry. To enter the formula by pointing with the
mouse, type the equal sign (=), point to the Quarter1 column in the same
row as the formula you’re entering, type the minus sign (–) and point to
the Quarter2 column. As you type and point with the mouse, Excel com-
pletes the formula.
3. After you complete the formula, press Enter. Excel fills the entire column
with the formula.
Figure 11-3
178
Part 11: Working with Tables

Remember: If you change the formula in any cell of a calculated column, Excel
updates the formulas in all other cells in the column automatically. If you do not
want Excel to update all other cells in the column, click the Smart Tag (the light-
ning bolt icon with the drop-down arrow) that appears next to the column after
you update the formula and choose Undo Calculated Column from the menu.
Removing Duplicate Values from a Table
If you have a table with duplicated information, you might want to remove the
rows containing the duplicates before analyzing the data. Excel provides many
convenient options for removing duplicated data. For example, you can choose
to remove duplicates if the entire row is duplicated (the default option) or you
can choose to remove rows if the data in one or more columns is duplicated.
Follow these steps to remove duplicated data from your table:
1. Click any cell in the table, and then click the Design tab on the Ribbon.
2. Click the Remove Duplicates button. Excel selects the entire data area of
the table and displays the Remove Duplicates dialog box (see Figure 11-4).
3. If you want to remove rows in which all column data is duplicated, click OK.
If you want to remove rows in which only data in one or more columns is
duplicated (for example, a last name), select the column or columns and
click OK.
The duplicated data is removed from the table permanently. If the result of the
removal operation is not what you want, you can undo the operation (click the
undo button on the Quick Access toolbar or press Ctrl+Z) and start over.
Figure 11-4
Referencing Table Data in a Formula — Removing Duplictate Values from a Table
179

If you want to retain your original data, you can select and copy the table to
another worksheet. If you have a particularly large data range, make a copy of
the worksheet.
Remember: You can remove duplicates in an ordinary (non-table) range. Select
the range and click the Remove Duplicates button in the Ribbon’s Data tab.
Selecting Table Areas
Excel 2007 provides convenient methods for you to select table rows, table
columns, or the entire table. These methods are particularly useful if, for exam-
ple, you want to copy table data or move the table to another location or format
entire columns conditionally:
 To select a table row, move the mouse pointer to the leftmost column in
the row until the pointer changes into a right-pointing arrow. Then click the
mouse to select the row. You can select a table row also by selecting any
cell in the row and pressing Shift+spacebar.
 To select the data cells in a table column, move the mouse pointer to the
header row until the pointer changes into a down-pointing arrow. Then
click the mouse to select the data cells. If you want to select the entire
table column, including the header and totals cells, click the mouse again.
You can select the data cells of a table column also by selecting any cell in
the column and pressing Ctrl+spacebar. Pressing Ctrl+spacebar again
selects the entire table column.
 To select all data rows in a table, move the mouse pointer to the upper-left
cell in the header row until the mouse changes into a diagonal arrow,
and then click to select the data rows. Click the mouse again to select
the entire table. You can select all data rows in the table also by pressing
Ctrl+Shift+spacebar. Press Ctrl+Shift+spacebar again to select the entire
table. Another way to select the entire table is to select any cell in the table
and move the mouse pointer to any edge of the table until the pointer
changes to an arrow with a cross at the tip. Then click to select the table.
Sorting Data in a Table
Sorting a table involves rearranging the rows so they’re in ascending or
descending order, based on the values in one or more columns. You may, for
example, want to sort a table of salespeople alphabetically by last name or by
sales region. You can sort numerically, alphabetically, or by date, depending on
the data.
180
Part 11: Working with Tables

If you sort a filtered table, Excel sorts only the visible rows. After you remove
the filtering from the table, the table is no longer sorted. Therefore, you should
remove any column filters before sorting the table.
Remember: You need to re-sort your table after adding (and perhaps editing)
table rows. To re-sort the table, click any cell in the table, click the Sort & Filter
button in the Design tab and choose Reapply from the menu. See also “Filtering
Data in a Table,” earlier in this part.
Sorting a single column based on column values
Follow these steps to sort a single column in your table based on the data in the
table:
1. Click the arrow on the header of the column you want to sort. Excel dis-
plays the filter and sort menu.
2. Choose one of the sort direction options at the top of the menu. The
options depend on the data type in the column you’re sorting (numeric,
text, or date). After you choose an option, Excel rearranges the rows in
the table.
After you apply a sort to a column, Excel adds a small arrow to the column
header arrow, indicating the direction of the sort. The arrow also serves as a
reminder that you’ve applied a sort to the column.
The ability to sort by date order (that is, oldest to newest or newest to oldest) is
new in Excel 2007.
Sorting multiple columns based on column values
Follow these steps to sort multiple columns in your table based on the data in
the table:
1. Click the arrow on the header of any column in the table. Excel displays
the filter and sort menu.
2. Choose Sort by Color and then choose Custom Sort from the flyout menu.
Excel displays the Sort dialog box.
3. From the following drop-down lists, choose the options for the first
column you want to sort:
• Sort by: Choose the first column you want to sort by.
• Sort on: Choose Values.
• Order: Choose a sort order.
Removing Duplicate Values from a Table — Sorting Data in a Table
181

4. For each additional column you want to sort, click the Add Level button.
Each time you do so, new drop-down lists appear. Repeat Step 3 for each
sort level you add (see Figure 11-5).
5. If you want your sorts to be case sensitive (applicable to text columns
only), click the Options button and select the Case Sensitive check box.
When you make your sorts case sensitive, uppercase letters appear
before lowercase letters in an ascending sort. Normally, sorting ignores
the case of letters.
6. If you want to change the sort order of a column after you add several
sort levels, click the left side of the sort level and click the up or down
arrow button. If you want to delete a sort level, click the left side of the
sort level and click the Delete Level button. After you click a sort level,
Excel highlights the level so you know which level you’re deleting or
reordering.
7. Click OK, and Excel rearranges the table’s rows.
In Excel 2007, you can sort on up to 64 columns (up from 3 columns in earlier
versions).
Sorting based on a custom sort order
In some cases, you may want to sort a text column in an order other than alpha-
betical ascending or descending. If your data consists of month names, for
example, you probably want them to appear in month order rather than alpha-
betically. Excel has four custom lists, and you can also define your own. To sort
one or more columns by a custom list, follow these steps:
1. Complete Steps 1–3 in “Sorting multiple columns based on column
values,” except in Step 3, choose Custom List from the Order drop-down
list. Excel displays the Custom Lists dialog box.
Figure 11-5
182
Part 11: Working with Tables

2. In the Custom Lists box, choose a sort order list.
3. Click OK to add the custom list to the Order drop-down in the Sort dialog
box.
4. Click OK. Excel rearranges the table’s rows based on the custom order.
You can also create a custom list in the Custom Lists dialog box. To create a
custom list, follow these steps:
1. In the Custom Lists box, select the New List entry.
2. In the List Entries text box, type your entries in the order you want your
list sorted. Press Enter after you type each entry of the list, or separate
each entry with a comma.
3. Click Add to include your new list in the Custom Lists box.
4. Click your new list and then click OK to add your list to the Order drop-
down list in the Sort dialog box.
5. Click OK. Excel rearranges the table’s rows based on your custom order.
Sorting based on color or conditional formatting icons
In Excel 2007, you can sort by background or font colors applied to cells manu-
ally or by conditional formatting. You can also sort by conditional formatting
icon sets or color scales. Sorting by color is useful if you want to group data that
meets a conditional formatting criterion.
Follow these steps to sort columns based on color (or icon):
1. Click the arrow on the header of the column that you want to sort by
color (or icon). Excel displays the filter and sort menu.
2. If you want to sort by a single color, choose Sort by Color and choose a
color (or icon, if applicable) from the flyout menu. After you choose a
color option, Excel moves the rows with that color to the top of the table.
A quick way to sort by a single color is to right-click a cell in the column with
the color, choose Sort from the contextual menu, and then choose an appropri-
ate color sort option (cell color, cell font, or cell icon).
You can sort by more than one color if, for example, you have multiple colors in
a column based on conditional formatting conditions or you want to arrange
color scale colors or icon set icons in a particular order in a column. See also
“Formatting a Range Using Visualizations,” in Part 8, for a discussion of color
scales and icon sets. Follow these steps to sort by more than one color in a
column:
Sorting Data in a Table
183

1. Complete the preceding steps to sort by the first color.
2. Click the arrow on the column header, choose Sort by Color and choose
Custom Sort from the flyout menu. Excel displays the Sort dialog box with
the first sort level listed (refer to Figure 11-5).
3. Click the left side of the existing sort level and click the Copy Level
button. Excel adds a new sort level with identical sort conditions.
4. Click the Order drop-down list and choose a color (or icon if applicable)
for the new sort level.
5. Repeat Steps 3 and 4 to add additional sort levels, except in step 3, click
the left side of the last sort level added before clicking Copy Level.
6. Click OK. Excel rearranges the table’s rows in the color order you 
specified.

Part 11: Working with Tables

Goal Seeking and
What-If Analysis
What-if analysis refers to the process of changing one or more input cells and
observing the effects on formulas. An input cell is a cell that a formula uses. If a
formula calculates a monthly payment amount for a loan, for example, the formula
refers to an input cell that contains the loan amount. Goal seeking is the reverse
process of what-if analysis. Goal seeking determines the value that an input cell
requires to produce a result that you want in a dependent (formula) cell.

Creating Data Input Tables
Using data tables is an excellent way to perform what-if analyses. Excel’s Data
Table feature enables you to set up a table to analyze data in the following ways:
 Calculate the results of one or more formulas for multiple values of a single
input
 Calculate the results of a single formula for multiple values of two inputs
Creating a one-input table
A one-input data table displays the results of one or more result formulas for mul-
tiple values of a single input cell. For example, if you have formulas that calculate
monthly loan payments, total loan payments, and total loan interest, you can
create a data table that shows the results of these formulas for different interest
rates. In this case, the interest rate cell is the input cell.
The following table describes how to set up a one-input data table.
Table Area
Description
Left column
Values for the single input cell
Top row
Formulas or references to result formulas elsewhere in the worksheet
Upper-left cell
Not used
Remaining cells
Results that Excel calculates
You can interchange the use of the left column and top row — that is, you can
enter the values for the single input cell in the top row and enter the formulas or
references in the left column.
The simplest way to explain how to set up a one-input data table is by using an
example. Figure 12-1 shows is a table we set up using data from a loan-calculator
model.
Figure 12-1
186
Part 12: Goal Seeking and What-If Analysis

To create the table shown in Figure 12-1, follow these steps:
1. In an empty area of your worksheet (or on a separate sheet), enter the
values that you want to use for the input cell. In Figure 12-1, we entered
input values in cells D4 through D12.
2. Enter formulas or references to the formulas that you want Excel to 
calculate for the different input values. In Figure 12-1, we used formula 
references. Cell E3 contains the formula =B10, cell F3 contains the 
formula =B13, and so on.
3. Select the table range, including the input values in the left column and
the formulas in the top row.
4. Click the Data tab on the Ribbon, click the What-If Analysis button, and
choose Data Table from the menu. Excel displays the Data Table dialog box.
5. Specify the worksheet cell that you’re using as the input value. In our
example, cell B3 (Interest Rate) is the input cell. Because the values for
the input cell are in a column (column D in this case), we used =B3 in the
Column input cell field. We left the Row input cell field blank.
If the input cell values were in the top row (with the formulas in the left
column), you would use the Row input cell field and leave the Column
input cell field blank.
6. Click OK. Excel performs the calculations and fills in the table.
Remember: Excel uses an array formula that uses the TABLE function. Excel
updates the table, therefore, if you change the cell references in the top row or
plug in different values in the left column.
See also “Creating a two-input table,” immediately following this section.
Creating a two-input table
A two-input data table displays the results of a single formula for various values
of two-input cells. If you have a formula that calculates a monthly loan payment,
for example, you can create a data table that shows the payment amount for var-
ious interest rates and loan amounts. The interest rate cell and the loan amount
cell are the input cells.
The following table describes how to set up the two-input data table.

The simplest way to explain how to set up a two-input data table is by using an
example. Figure 12-2 shows how we set up a table by using data from a loan-
calculator model.
To create the table shown in Figure 12-2, follow these steps:
1. In an empty area of your worksheet (or on a separate sheet), enter the
values that you want to use for the first input cell. In Figure 12-2, we
entered the first input cell values in cells D4 through D12.
2. Enter the values that you want to use for the second input cell. In Figure
12-2, we entered the second input cell values in cells E3 through H3.
3. In the cell immediately above and to the left of the two input cells (upper-
left cell), enter a formula or a reference to the formula that you want Excel
to calculate for combinations of the two input values. In the figure, we
used a formula reference. Cell D3 contains the formula =B10.
4. Select the table range, including the input values in the left column and
the input values in the top row.
5. Click the Data tab on the Ribbon, click the What-If Analysis button, and
choose Data Table from the menu. Excel displays the Data Table dialog
box.
6. Specify the cell for the Row input cell. In the figure, the value in the Row
input cell is =B8.
7. Specify the cell for the Column input cell. In the figure, the value in the
Column input cell is =B3.
8. Click OK. Excel performs the calculations and fills in the table.

Part 12: Goal Seeking and What-If Analysis

Finding Input Values that Produce the Desired Output
Excel’s Goal Seek feature enables you to determine the value that a single input
cell requires to produce a result that you want in a dependent (formula) cell. If
you use the PMT function to calculate the monthly payment of a loan, for exam-
ple, you may want to determine the loan amount for a specific monthly payment
(given a fixed interest rate and payment term). You can adjust the cell that con-
tains the loan amount manually until the formula that contains the PMT function
provides the result you want, but using the Goal Seek feature is much faster:
1. Activate the worksheet that contains your formula.
2. Click the Data tab on the Ribbon, click the What-If Analysis button, and
choose Goal Seek from the menu. Excel displays the Goal Seek dialog box.
3. Specify the formula cell to change (in the Set Cell text box), the value to
change it to (in the To Value text box), and the input cell to change (in the
By Changing Cell text box). The input cell must be referenced in your for-
mula. See an example in Figure 12-3.
4. Click OK. Excel displays the solution in the worksheet and in the Goal
Seek dialog box.
5. To restore your worksheet to the form that it was in before you initiated
the Goal Seek command, click Cancel. Or to replace the original value with
the found value, click OK.
Remember: Excel can’t always find a value that produces the result that you’re
looking for. (Sometimes a solution doesn’t exist.) In such a case, the Goal Seek
status box informs you of that fact. If Excel reports that it can’t find a solution,
but you’re pretty sure that one exists, try the following options:
 Change the current value of the changing cell to a value that is closer to
the solution, and then reissue the command.
Figure 12-3
Creating Data Input Tables — Finding Input Values that Produce the Desired Output
189

 Turn on Iterative Calculation and adjust the Maximum Iterations setting in
the Formulas tab of the Excel Options dialog box (by clicking the Office
button and clicking then Excel Options). Increasing the number of itera-
tions makes Excel try other possible solutions. See also “Handling Circular
References,” in Part 7.
See also “Creating Data Input Tables,” earlier in this part.
Using Scenario Manager
Excel’s Scenario Manager feature makes it easy to automate your what-if models.
You can store different sets of input values (known as changing cells) for any
number of variables and give a name to each set. You can then select a set of
values by name, and Excel displays the worksheet using those values. You can
generate a summary report (in outline or PivotTable form) that shows the effect
of various combinations of values on any number of result cells.
Creating a named scenario
To define a scenario, follow these steps:
1. Create your worksheet as usual, using input cells that determine the
result of one or more formulas.
2. Click the Data tab on the Ribbon, click the What-If Analysis button, and
choose Scenario Manager from the menu. Excel displays the Scenario
Manager dialog box.
3. Click the Add button to add a scenario in the Add Scenario dialog box, as
shown in Figure 12-4.
Figure 12-4
190
Part 12: Goal Seeking and What-If Analysis

4. Complete the Add Scenario dialog box. The following list describes the
settings in this dialog box:
• Scenario Name: The name for the scenario. You can give it any name
you want.
• Changing Cells: The input cells for the scenario. You can enter the cell
addresses directly or point to them. Multiple selections are possible,
so the input cells don’t need to be adjacent. Each named scenario can
use the same set of changing cells or different changing cells.
• Comment: By default, Excel displays who created the scenario and the
date that person created it. You can change this text, add new text to
it, or delete it.
• Protection: The two Protection options (Prevent Changes and Hide)
are in effect only if the worksheet is protected and the Edit Scenarios
check box is deselected in the Protect Sheet dialog box. Prevent
Changes protects a scenario from modification; Hide prevents the sce-
nario from appearing in the Scenario Manager dialog box. See also
“Protecting a Worksheet,” in Part 3.
5. Click OK to display the Scenario Values dialog box.
6. Enter values for the changing cells in the appropriate text boxes.
7. Click the Add button to add the scenario.
8. Repeat Steps 4–7 for each additional scenario.
9. Click Close to close the Scenario Manager dialog box.
An excellent practice is to create names for changing cells to make the cells
easier to identify in the Scenario Values dialog box. Names also help make sce-
nario reports more readable. See also Part 6, “Creating and Using Names.”
Remember: A scenario can have no more than 32 changing cells.
See also “Creating a scenario summary report,” immediately following.
Creating a scenario summary report
After you define at least two scenarios, you can generate reports that summa-
rize the scenarios by following these steps:
1. Click the Data tab on the Ribbon, click the What-If Analysis button, and
choose Scenario Manager from the menu. Excel displays the Scenario
Manager dialog box.
2. Click the Summary button.
Finding Input Values that Produce the Desired Output — Using Scenario Manager
191

3. Select the type of report, as follows:
• Scenario summary: The summary report is in the form of an outline.
• Scenario PivotTable: The summary report is in the form of a
PivotTable. This option gives you more flexibility if you define many
scenarios with multiple result cells.
4. In the Result Cells text box, specify the summary cells to include in the
report.
5. Click OK. Excel creates a new worksheet to store the summary table.
An excellent practice is to create names for the result cells, because Excel uses
these names in the scenario summary reports that you create. The names help
make your reports more readable. See also Part 6, “Creating and Using Names.”
Remember: Result cells must be in the same worksheet as the changing cells.
See also “Creating a named scenario,” earlier in this part, and “Creating a
PivotTable Report,” in Part 13.
Displaying a named scenario
As you view a scenario, Excel inserts the scenario’s values into the changing
cells in the worksheet. Formulas that depend on these cells are updated. To
view a named scenario, follow these steps:
1. Click the Data tab on the Ribbon, click the What-If Analysis button, and
choose Scenario Manager from the menu. Excel displays the Scenario
Manager dialog box.
2. In the Scenarios list box, select the scenario.
3. Click Show. Excel updates the changing cells in the worksheet by using
the scenario’s values.
You can view as many scenarios as you want while the Scenario Manager dialog
box is open. After you finish, click Close. Values for the last scenario viewed
remain in the worksheet.

Analyzing Data 
with PivotTables
A PivotTable report (or simply a PivotTable) is a dynamic table that organizes
and summarizes data that exists in a tabular form. This manipulation enables
you to view relationships, make comparisons, detect patterns and analyze
trends among some of or all fields in your raw data.

Anatomy of a PivotTable
In contrast to a table, in which you present and analyze the details of your data,
a PivotTable enables you to present and analyze your data in a summarized
form. Moreover, a PivotTable (see Figure 13-1) enables you to view different
dimensions of your summarized data in hierarchical levels of detail.
The following is a description of the elements in a PivotTable:
 PivotTable Field List task pane: Displayed after you indicate that you want
to create a PivotTable from the source data. The task pane includes the
field labels (column titles) from the source data and boxes that correspond
to areas on the PivotTable.
Row labels
Report filter
Column label
Row grand totals
PivotTable Tools tab header
PivotTable Field List task pane
PivotTable field list
Field items
Values area
PivotTable label boxes
Figure 13-1
194
Part 13: Analyzing Data with PivotTables

 Row labels: Fields that you want to summarize in rows.
 Field Item: An individual item in the row or column areas of the PivotTable.
 Column labels: Fields that you want to summarize in columns.
 Values: The data being summarized (for example, Sum of TotalPrice).
 Report filter: One or more of the fields in the Field List task pane used to
filter the PivotTable report.
Remember: To construct a PivotTable report, at a minimum you need to choose a
field to summarize in the data area and one field for either the row or column
area. Your choices depend on how you want to view your data.
Remember: The source data that feeds the PivotTable is held in an area of system
memory known as a PivotCache. If you have sufficient memory and the source
data comes from an external data source, you may able to create a PivotTable
from source data that has more rows or columns than Excel supports. This is pos-
sible if after summarization, the data fits within Excel’s row and column limits.
Changing the Summarization of a Value Field
When you add a numeric field to the Values area of a PivotTable, Excel uses the
Sum function to summarize the data. If you add a text field to the Values area,
Excel uses the Count function to summarize the text data. The Count function is
the only way to summarize text data, but Excel provides several alternative
options for summarizing numeric data. To select a different summarization func-
tion other than Excel’s default, right-click within a numeric field in the values
area of the PivotTable, choose Summarize Data By from the contextual menu,
and then choose an option from the flyout menu. Excel displays the new sum-
mary for the selected field.
You can display different summarizations for the same numeric field in the
PivotTable. For each new summarization, simply drag the field label from the
field list in the task pane to the Values box (the Values box can have the same
field multiple times). Each time you drag the field to the Values box, Excel adds
the field to the values area of the PivotTable using the default summarization. To
change the default, use the procedure outlined for changing the summarization.
Creating a PivotTable Report
The data for your PivotTable can come from an external data source (such as a
database) or an Excel range or table. See also Part 11, “Working with Tables.”
Although you can create a PivotTable from an ordinary (non-table) worksheet
Anatomy of a PivotTable — Creating a PivotTable Report
195

range, using a table is preferable — if the table expands or shrinks, after you
refresh the PivotTable the data for it is based on the new table range.
To create a PivotTable report from a table, follow these steps:
1. Move the cell pointer to any cell in the table.
2. Click the Insert tab on the Ribbon and then click the top part of the
PivotTable button. Excel displays the Create Pivot Table dialog box and
outlines the table’s data area. Excel inserts the table name in the Table/
Range box.
3. In the lower half of the dialog box, specify where you want to locate the
PivotTable and then click OK. If you select the Existing Worksheet option,
click the Location box and then click the cell in the worksheet that will be
the upper-left corner of the PivotTable. Excel displays the PivotTable Field
List task pane and the area on the worksheet that will hold the PivotTable.
In addition, Excel displays PivotTable tools contextual tabs on the Ribbon.
4. In the Field List task pane, select the check boxes next to the field labels
of the fields you want to include or drag the field labels to the boxes in the
lower portion of the task pane. These boxes correspond to the label areas
in the PivotTable where your selected fields will appear (see Figure 13-2).
If you select check boxes, Excel chooses the boxes in the lower portion of
the task pane to place the field labels based on the following assumptions:
• Field labels for numeric fields (such as TotalPrice) are placed in the
Values box.
• Field labels for non-numeric fields are placed in the Row Labels box.
To override Excel’s default behavior, drag the field labels from the list in the
top window to the appropriate boxes in the lower portion of the task pane.
After Excel places field labels in the boxes (or you drag the labels to the
boxes manually), the field data appears in the appropriate PivotTable
label areas on the worksheet. By default, field labels in the Values box sum
the corresponding data that appears in the values area of the PivotTable.
Figures 13-1 and 13-2 demonstrate the hierarchical nature of summarizing data
in a PivotTable and the relationship between the arrangement of the fields in the
task pane and the worksheet display.
The ability to drag field labels within the task pane is new. Excel 2007 also pro-
vides +/- indicators next to each level header on the worksheet, allowing you to
quickly expand or collapse a level of detail in the PivotTable summary.
Furthermore, when you create a PivotTable in Excel 2007, Excel displays the
PivotTable in the new Compact layout shown in Figure 13-2 by default. In the
Compact Layout, the actual row and column labels (see Figure 13-1) are not dis-
played, so you can view more of a wide PivotTable in the workbook window.
196
Part 13: Analyzing Data with PivotTables

Filtering a PivotTable Report
In most ways, filtering a PivotTable is similar to filtering a table (see “Filtering
Data in a Table,” in Part 11). In the case of PivotTables however, you’re filtering
summarized data as opposed to a detailed dataset.
Filtering a PivotTable based on individual field items
Follow these steps to filter fields in your PivotTable based on individual field
items:
1. Click the arrow on the header of the row or column field you want to filter.
If you’re using the Compact report layout, the individual field headings
aren’t shown but are represented by a Row Labels header (in the row
area) and a Column Labels header (in the column area). Click the arrow
on the Row Labels or Column Labels header. Excel displays the Sort and
Filter menu. Figure 13-3 shows the Sort and Filter menu in the Compact
Report Layout.
2. If you’re using the Compact report layout, you must first choose the field
you want to filter from the Select Field drop-down list in the Row Labels or
Column Labels Sort and Filter menu. The lower portion of the menu dis-
plays the field items in a window. By default, Excel selects all items. If you
want to display one or only a few entries, you can clear the Select All
check box and select individually the items you want displayed.
Alternatively, if you want to hide only a few items, clear the check boxes
next to these items but do not clear the Select all check box.
Figure 13-2
Creating a PivotTable Report — Filtering a PivotTable Report
197

3. Click OK. In the PivotTable, Excel displays the items you selected in Step 2
and hides all cleared items. Excel also adds a filter icon (a small funnel) on
the field drop-down arrow and on the right of the field label in the task
pane to indicate that a filter is applied to the field.
4. To filter additional fields, repeat Steps 2 and 3.
If your PivotTable includes a report filter, you can select multiple items to dis-
play or filter by clicking the report filter drop-down arrow and selecting or clear-
ing items from the menu. In the menu, make sure that the Select Multiple Items
check box is selected.
Filtering a PivotTable based on field data type
Similar to tables, a field can be filtered by data type (that is value, label or date).
To filter a PivotTable field based on date, number, or label criteria, follow these
steps:
1. Click the arrow on the field header of the field you want to filter. If you’re
using the Compact report layout, individual field headings aren’t shown.
In this case, click the arrow on Row Labels or Column Labels. Excel dis-
plays the Sort and Filter menu.
2. If you’re using the Compact report layout, you must first choose the field
you want to filter from the Select Field drop-down list in the Row Labels or
Column Labels Sort and Filter menu. Above the field items window,
choose the datatype Filters option (where datatype is Label, Number or
Date, depending on the data type of the field you’re filtering). Each row or
column field in a PivotTable has a Value filter and either a Label or Date
filter.
Figure 13-3
198
Part 13: Analyzing Data with PivotTables

3. Choose a filter option from the flyout menu.
4. Complete the dialog box for the filter option and then click OK.
Pre-filtering a PivotTable
Excel 2007 allows you to filter fields from the source data before adding the
fields to the PivotTable. This feature can be useful if you need to analyze a
subset of the data in a large dataset (located in an external database, for 
example).
To filter a field before adding the field to the PivotTable, click the field label in
the task pane’s field list and follow the steps for “Filtering a PivotTable based on
individual field items” or “Filtering a PivotTable based on field data type,” previ-
ously in this section, depending on the type of filter you want to apply.
Clearing PivotTable filters
During your analysis of the data in a PivotTable, you may have applied multiple
filters to one or more fields. You can manually remove the filters one by one, but
Excel provides a quicker way to remove filters from your PivotTable:
 To clear filters from a single field, click the arrow on the field header of
the field from which you want to remove filters (either on the PivotTable
or the task pane field list). If you’re using the Compact report layout, click
the arrow on Row Labels or Column Labels. Then, from the Sort and Filter
menu, choose Clear Filter From fieldname, where fieldname is the name of
field whose filters you’re clearing (for example, ProductName). If you’re
using the Compact report layout, you must first choose the field from
which you want to remove the filters from the Select Field drop-down list
in the Sort and Filter menu.
 To clear all filters in the PivotTable, click anywhere in the PivotTable, click
the Sort & Filter button in the Ribbon’s Home tab, and choose Clear from
the menu.
Formatting a PivotTable Report
When you create a PivotTable, Excel applies a default style to the PivotTable.
However, you can apply a different predefined style to the PivotTable or create a
new style. You can also apply formatting based on the contents or a cell or a
PivotTable field.
Applying a new style to a PivotTable
Follow these steps to apply a new predefined style to a PivotTable:
Filtering a PivotTable Report — Formatting a PivotTable Report
199

1. Click any cell in the PivotTable and then click the Design tab.
2. Select a new style from the PivotTable Styles gallery.
You can scroll the gallery options by clicking the upper (scroll) arrows on
the right side of the gallery, or you can display a drop-down grid by click-
ing the arrow below the scroll arrows. Preview a style by hovering the
mouse pointer over the style.
3. In addition, or as an alternative, to Step 2, you can select style and display
options from the PivotTable Style Options group. Check or clear the
appropriate check boxes.
Remember: The styles you apply from the PivotTable Styles gallery are based on
the theme applied to the workbook. Therefore, if you change the workbook
theme, the applied PivotTable style and the gallery styles change to match the
new theme. See also “Formatting with Themes,” in Part 1.
Formatting based on data values
Formatting a PivotTable based on data values (conditional formatting) is similar
to formatting a non-PivotTable cell or range based on the contents of the cell or
range. See: “Formatting Based on the Contents of a Cell or Range,” and
“Formatting a Range using Visualizations,” both in Part 8.
In earlier versions of Excel, you could apply conditional formatting to some or
all cells in the values area of the PivotTable. However, the formatting was not
applied at the field level, so if the PivotTable source data was updated with new
information, Excel did not extend the conditional formatting to include the new
data. In Excel 2007, after you select a cell or range of cells in the values area and
apply a conditional formatting rule, a Formatting Options SmartTag (a small icon
on the right of the selection) appears (see Figure 13-4).
Clicking the SmartTag provides the following options:
 Selected cells: This is the default option. Excel applies the conditional for-
matting to the selected cells only.
Figure 13-4
200
Part 13: Analyzing Data with PivotTables

 All cells showing “Sum of fieldname” values, where fieldname is the name of
a values field (for example, TotalPrice): Excel applies the conditional for-
matting to all cells showing Sum of fieldname values in the PivotTable,
regardless of the field’s hierarchical level, and includes subtotals and grand
totals. If the subtotals or grand totals displays are turned on, this option is
useful for summarizations that aren’t sums (otherwise the subtotals and
grand totals will skew any conditional formatting based on the range of
values in the field). An example of a useful summarization for this option is
“Average of fieldname.”
 All cells showing “Sum of fieldname” values for RowField and ColumnField,
where fieldname is the name of a values field (for example, TotalPrice),
RowField is the name of a row field, and ColumnField is the name of a
column field. Excel applies the conditional formatting to all cells showing
Sum of fieldname values in the PivotTable for the row and column fields
that correspond to the cells you selected for conditional formatting, and
excludes subtotals. ColumnField is excluded from the option if the
PivotTable doesn’t include any column fields.
In the preceding list, we assume that the values field is summarized using the
Sum function (Excel’s default). The actual name on the option depends on the
summarization function applied to the field. If the values are averaged, for exam-
ple, the name will be “All cells showing “Average of fieldname” values.
Remember: If you select either of the last two options in the preceding list, after
the PivotTable is refreshed, Excel extends the conditional formatting to include
the new data.
Remember: Formatting is applied to a PivotTable in the following order: direct
formatting (for example, formatting that you apply from the Font group in the
Ribbon’s Home tab) appears over PivotTable style formatting and conditional
formatting appears over direct formatting.
Changing the number format of a PivotTable field
In creating a PivotTable report, Excel doesn’t retain any special number format-
ting that you may have applied to your original data. If you apply a currency
format to your source data, for example, and then use that data in the PivotTable,
Excel doesn’t retain the currency formatting in the PivotTable report.
To change the number format for a field in the PivotTable report, follow these
steps:
1. Select any cell in the field in which you want to change the number
format. Most often, you will use this option to change the number format
in the values area of the PivotTable, but you can change the number for-
mats of numeric or date fields in the row or column areas.
Formatting a PivotTable Report
201

2. Right-click and choose Field Settings or Value Field Settings from the con-
textual menu (the name on the contextual menu depends on whether
you’re changing the number format of a row/column field or a values
field). Excel displays the Field Settings or Value Field Settings dialog box.
3. Click the Number Format button. Excel displays the Format Cells dialog
box.
4. In the Category list box, select a number format category and then select
a format on the right side of the Format Cells dialog box.
5. Click OK to exit the Format Cells dialog box, and click OK again to exit the
Field Settings or Value Field Settings dialog box.
A quick way to change the number format of cells in a values field is to right-
click a cell in the field and choose Number Format to display the Format Cells
dialog box.
Remember: After you apply a number format option using Field Settings, Value
Field Settings, or Number Format options in the contextual menu, the formatting
is applied to any new data that appears after you refresh the PivotTable. If you
want to apply formatting (number, font, background, and so on) to only a cell or
a group of cells, select the cell or range, right-click in the selection, choose
Format Cells from the contextual menu, and make your selections in the Format
Cells dialog box that appears.
Grouping PivotTable Items
A handy feature enables you to group specific items in a single field of a
PivotTable report. If one of the fields in your source data consists of dates, for
example, the PivotTable displays a separate row or column for every date. You
may find that grouping the dates into months, quarters, or years is a more useful
way to create a PivotTable report with a date field.
Remember: If you’re grouping by date or number, the field you select for grouping
can’t have any blank items. Also, if you’re grouping by date, all cells in the
source data date field must carry one of Excel’s recognized date or time formats.
Creating a date group
To create a date group PivotTable, follow these steps:
1. Right-click a cell in the date field that you want to group and choose
Group from the contextual menu. Excel displays the Grouping dialog box
(see Figure 13-5).
202
Part 13: Analyzing Data with PivotTables

2. Select the grouping(s) you want. Note the following when selecting your
grouping(s):
• To select more than one grouping, click each grouping option in turn.
Click a grouping option a second time to deselect it.
• To group weekly or biweekly, select the Days option and specify 7 or
14, respectively, in the Number of Days box.
• If you select a multiple days grouping and then select another group-
ing (for example, months, quarter, or years), Excel ignores the multiple
days group because it’s not possible to group across grouping bound-
aries. For example, if you attempt to group by week and by month, the
weekdays can span across two months, so it’s impossible to accommo-
date both groupings simultaneously.
3. In the dialog box, Excel automatically chooses the starting and ending
dates for the group based on the range of dates in the PivotTable. To man-
ually specify the starting date or ending date or both, clear the check box
next to Starting At or Ending At and enter a new date in the text box. For
example, if you’re grouping by week and want to ensure that the week is
grouped from Sunday to Saturday, in the Starting At text box, enter the
Sunday date prior to Excel’s selected starting date (unless Excel’s starting
date is Sunday).
4. Click OK. Excel creates the grouping(s).
If your date field covers multiple years and you elect to group by month or quar-
ter or both, you should also include the Years grouping. If you don’t include the
Years grouping, each month or quarter will be summarized for all years, not for
each year.
Creating a number group
If you create a PivotTable report and include a numeric field (or a text field that
looks like a number) in the row or column areas of the PivotTable, you can
Figure 13-5
Formatting a PivotTable Report — Grouping PivotTable Items
203

create a number group. If, for example, you have a row field with a large number
of order or invoice numbers, you might want to create a more Compact report.
To create a number group, follow these steps:
1. Right-click a cell in the field in which you want to create a number group
and choose Group from the contextual menu. Excel displays the Grouping
dialog box.
2. In the dialog box, Excel automatically chooses the starting and ending
numbers for the group. To manually specify the starting number or ending
number or both, clear the check box next to Starting At or Ending At and
enter a new number in the text box.
3. In the By text box, specify the number you want to group by.
4. Click OK. Excel creates the grouping.
Creating a text group
Excel allows you to create text groups. A text group might be useful, for exam-
ple, if you want to group multiple states into sales territories. Follow these steps
to create a text group:
1. Select the cells in the field that you want to group. If the items that you
want to group aren’t next to each other, you can make a multiple selection
by pressing and holding Ctrl and then selecting the items that will make
up the group.
2. Right-click any cell in the selection and choose Group from the contextual
menu. Excel automatically creates the group with a generic title, such as
Group1, Group2 and so on.
3. To change the name of the group to something more meaningful, click the
cell with the new group name a type a new name in the formula bar.
Modifying a PivotTable Report
A PivotTable is a special type of range, and (except for formatting) you can’t
manipulate it like a normal range. For example you can’t insert or delete rows,
edit results, or move cells. If you attempt to do so, Excel displays an error mes-
sage. However, you can make certain modifications to the layout or structure of
your PivotTable, some of which are described in this section.
Modifying a report layout
When you create a PivotTable, by default Excel uses the new Compact layout
(see Figure 13-2) in which the actual row and column labels are hidden. This
layout is useful if you have many fields in your report, because it minimizes 
204
Part 13: Analyzing Data with PivotTables

horizontal space on the worksheet and can make reading the report easier. You
can, however, use one of the following alternative layouts:
 Outline: This layout is similar to the Compact layout, except it displays the
individual row and column headings (see Figure 13-1).
 Tabular: In this layout, the first item in a sublevel field appears not on a
separate row (refer to Figure 13-1) but on the same row as its upper level
(parent) field item.
To change the report layout, click anywhere in the PivotTable, click the Report
Layout button in the Design tab, and choose a layout option from the menu.
Modifying a report structure
The power behind a PivotTable lies in its ability to display your summarized
data in many dimensions by simply rearranging fields in the row, column, and
values areas of the report and adding one or more report filters in the report
filter area. Use any of the following techniques to rearrange the report structure
to display your data differently:
 To add fields to the report, drag the field labels from the field list in the
task pane to the appropriate label boxes below the field list. To remove a
field from the report, either drag the field label off the appropriate label
box or clear the check box next to the field name in the field list.
 To move fields between the row, column, and report filter areas of the
report, drag the field labels between label boxes in the task pane.
 To rearrange levels in the row or column areas of the report, click and drag
a field label in the row or column label box above or below the appropriate
field labels in the same label box.
You can move fields also by clicking the field labels in the task pane label boxes
and selecting a move option from the menu.
Displaying and hiding subtotals and grand totals
Sometimes, you may want to view your report with subtotals above or below a
group or you may want to hide the subtotals display. Also, you may want to dis-
play grand totals in rows or columns only, or not at all. To change the display
option for subtotals, click anywhere in the PivotTable, click the Subtotals button
in the Design tab, and choose an option from the menu. To change the display
option for grand totals, click anywhere in the PivotTable, click the Grand Totals
button in the Design tab, and choose an option from the menu.
To turn off subtotals for only a single field, make sure that subtotals are turned
on for the entire report, right-click an item in the field, and choose Subtotal field-
name from the contextual menu, where fieldname is the name of field whose
subtotal you’re turning off (for example, ProductName). To display subtotals for

only one field, make sure that subtotals are turned off for the entire report, right-
click an item in the field, and choose Subtotal fieldname from the contextual
menu.
Expanding and collapsing field item levels
Expanding field item levels in your PivotTable report allows you to see sublevel
item details in your report summary, and collapsing item levels allows you to
hide sublevel details in your report summary.
Excel 2007 makes it easier for you to expand and collapse report levels than in
earlier versions. Each higher-level field item has a +/- indicator button . Simply
click the button to expand or collapse all sublevels below the field item. You can
also expand or collapse to other levels of details as follows:
 To expand all sublevel items in a field, right-click an item in the field,
choose Expand/Collapse from the contextual menu, and choose Expand
Entire Field from the flyout menu. To collapse all sublevel items in a field,
repeat the preceding but choose Collapse Entire Field from the flyout menu
(see Figure 13-6).
 To expand a field item down to a specific sublevel, right-click an item in the
field, choose Expand/Collapse from the contextual menu, and choose the
field name from the bottom portion of the flyout menu.
Refreshing a PivotTable Report
If the source data that a PivotTable report uses changes, the PivotTable doesn’t
update automatically. You must refresh it manually. To refresh a PivotTable, click
a cell in the PivotTable and then click Refresh on the Design tab or right-click
anywhere in the PivotTable and choose Refresh from the contextual menu.
