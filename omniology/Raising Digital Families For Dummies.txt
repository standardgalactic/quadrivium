About the Author
Named one of the most powerful women in social media by Working Mother 
magazine, Amy Lupold Bair is the owner of Resourceful Mommy Media, 
LLC (www.resourcefulmommymedia.com), a social media marketing com­
pany that includes the blogger network Global Influence as well as her own 
site, Resourceful Mommy (www.resourcefulmommy.com). She’s loved the 
Internet since she first heard the whir whir click of a dial-up modem. Her first 
home online was a Geocities community, and she still maintains a Prodigy 
e-mail account for sentimental reasons. Amy’s primary digital addiction is 
Twitter where she is always available as @ResourcefulMom.
Prior to her career as a social media consultant, writer, and speaker, Amy 
taught middle school English and drama. She and her social media–averse 
husband live in the Washington, D.C. suburbs where they are raising their 
own digital family.


Dedication
This book is dedicated to my husband, Jason, and our two amazing, tech-
savvy kids. All three believe whole-heartedly that I can accomplish anything 
and support me without question as I pull them along on this crazy journey 
that is my life.
Author’s Acknowledgments
Thank you first and foremost to John Wiley & Sons, Inc. for giving me this 
opportunity and welcoming me to the For Dummies family. 
Special thanks to Ellen Gerstein who changed my life with the best Twitter 
direct message ever as well as Amy Fandrei who took a chance on this very 
grateful blogger. Your support and encouragement through this process has 
been incredible.
Brian Walls, my project editor, thank you for having patience, a sense of 
humor, and the courage to edit a blogger’s writing. Thanks to the rest of the 
editing team who took the ideas on the page and turned them into something 
For Dummies worthy. Jennifer, Chantal, and the rest of the marketing team, 
thank you for your part in bringing this book to its readers.
I am grateful for the support and love of my family who gave up weekends 
and helped out in countless ways, all in the pursuit of deadlines. 
Thank you to the blogging community for your friendship, encouragement, 
inspiration, and trailblazing. Shannan, there would be no me without you, and 
I am eternally grateful. Kelby, Melanie, Andrea and the rest of the KA room, 
thank you for your expertise and camaraderie. The Safe House Blobbers, I 
could not get through my days without you.
I would be remiss if I did not thank Mr. Herb who never allowed me to be sat­
isfied with “good enough” writing, Mrs. Readinger who made writing fun, and 
Mrs. Bolich who insisted that I learn one new word a week. I still love ennui 
and undulate because of you.
Finally, I want to acknowledge Samantha Hall, the nom de plume I created as 
an eight year old girl, certain that Amy Lupold could never write for a living. I 
think, somehow, we’ve done this together.

Introduction
A

s the mom of two elementary school-age kids, I understand that 
parenting “digital natives” — that is, children born into this digital age 
in which we live — can be overwhelming at times. The technology that your 
children and their friends use daily may be unfamiliar to you. Even if you dive 
right into technology as quickly as your children do, you may not be aware of 
how your children experience the same platforms and devices. You also 
may not be familiar with the challenges and dangers associated with these 
technologies — dangers that are often unique to them.
Still, understanding current technology — from mobile apps to tablets — is 
about far more than safety. Raising a digital family also means monitoring 
access to seemingly unlimited resources online. Educational websites guide 
children in learning and practicing necessary skills, while family resource 
sites allow family members to stay connected. Apps help parents remember 
everything from when to buy milk to directions to play dates. If embraced 
and understood and monitored, today’s technology offers fabulous tools to 
help you raise your digital family.
This book will equip you — as a digital parent — to become the head of your 
digital family, protecting your loved ones from online pitfalls and guiding 
them to make the most of this amazing and ever-growing world of technology.
Here are some of the things you can do with this book:
	
✓	Change browser settings to protect your family’s privacy.
	
✓	Identify hidden online advertising aimed at your children.
	
✓	Manage Facebook privacy settings.
	
✓	Plan meals with the help of online tools.
	
✓	Help kids find fun yet safe entertainment sites online.

Raising Digital Families For Dummies 
Foolish Assumptions
In writing this book, I assume that you have a home computer, at least one 
member of your family has a smartphone, and you know the basics of using 
today’s technology devices (such as web browsers and Wi-Fi). I assume that 
you’re interested in creating rules and guidelines for your family’s use of 
digital devices, but you may not know where to start. I also assume that you 
have an e-mail address and are familiar with social media, even if you don’t 
have a Facebook or Twitter account.
Conventions Used in This Book
When you see a term italicized, look for its definition in the context of raising 
a digital family. I sometimes give step-by-step instructions that direct you 
to enter specific text onscreen, and that text appears in bold. Website 
addresses (URLs) and e-mail addresses are in monofont. I sometimes refer 
to your children as “digital natives” because they’ve been born into a world 
of mobile devices, touchscreens, and Wi-Fi, while we as parents were born 
before the invention of many of the technologies we use today. I also refer 
often to the “digital family,” which is composed of the members of your 
nuclear family.
How This Book Is Organized
Raising Digital Families For Dummies has six parts. You don’t have to read 
the book sequentially, and you don’t even have to read all the sections in any 
particular chapter. You can use the Table of Contents and the index to find 
the information you need and quickly get your answer. Here is what you’ll 
find in each part.
Part I: Living in the Digital Age
Part I introduces you to today’s digital family, exploring some of the pros and 
cons of raising children in today’s digital age. This part guides you through 
creating a Digital Family Policy, which is a tool to create and manage the 
digital rules for your family. For example, how much screen time are your 
kids allowed on a weekday? Are they allowed to have a Facebook account? 
It also dives into the safety concerns that many parents face, such as online 
predators and cyberbullying. This section also lays some ground rules for 
basic online etiquette, empowering you with the tools you need to talk to 
your children about what’s appropriate online.

3
 Introduction
Part II: Navigating the Digital 
World Kids Live In
In this section, I introduce some of the digital gadgets that kids use daily, 
such as game consoles and social media games. This part tackles the issue 
of cyberbullying as well as online chat platforms and privacy settings. Not 
only does this part of the book guide you to change search engine filters to 
protect your family, but it also helps you identify online advertising targeting 
your children.
Part III: Grasping Social Media’s 
Effect on Your Family
Part III dives head-first into social media, exploring not only the most popular 
social media platforms for teens and adults, but also taking a close look at 
social networking sites created specifically for children. This section also 
walks you through creating a YouTube account, giving you access to both 
privacy settings and filters. Finally, Part III delves into the world of online 
entrepreneurship as it relates to kids, including kids who blog.
Part IV: Left to Their Own Devices
This section focuses on handheld devices, such as video game systems and 
tablets. Part IV introduces tablets created with kids in mind while also taking 
a look at how your tablet can easily become the family tablet. Considering a 
mobile phone for your child? See how to decide whether the time is right — 
as well as how to keep your child safe.
Part V: Utilizing Online Family Resources
Navigating the world of digital parenting is not only about understanding 
terms of service and privacy settings. There are also amazing resources 
available online. Many cool apps are available to help parents balance family 
budgets, create weekly meal plans, and more. Part V looks at the educational 
resources available online for kids as well as the parenting tools available on 
the Internet for parents.

Raising Digital Families For Dummies 
Part VI: The Part of Tens
Familiar to For Dummies readers, these Parts of Tens chapters include basic 
tips for digital parents, a closer look at online locations your teenagers may 
frequent, and also some of the most popular websites for kids.
Icons Used in This Book
As a guide, look for those little pictures in margins that point you in the 
direction of useful information, things to remember, or warnings to heed.
	
The Tip icon points out helpful information that may make something easier 
or point out something you may find useful.
	
This icon notes a piece of information that you may want to use later.
	
The Warning icon highlights lurking danger. When you see this icon, pay 
attention and proceed with caution.
	
When you see this icon, you know that there’s techie material nearby. If you’re 
not feeling very techie, you can skip this info.
Where to Go from Here
You don’t have to read this book sequentially, and you don’t even have to 
read all the sections in any particular chapter. You can skip over sidebars 
and just read the material that helps you complete the task at hand. Your 
first stop might be to read the Table of Contents and find the sections of this 
book that you need.
You may want to read just the chapters that apply to you now, or jump 
right into the Part of Tens for some quick tips. Chapters can be read in any 
order you choose. When you’re ready to create your Digital Family Policy, 
see Chapter 2 — the policy, however, doesn’t have to be completed before 
you read Chapter 3. I do recommend reading the chapters that apply to your 
family before finalizing your family’s digital guidelines, though.

5
 Introduction
Each chapter stands on its own and can help you tackle specific tasks. For 
example, if your child has asked for his first mobile phone, you probably 
want to head to Chapter 17. If your child recently opened a Facebook account 
and you’re concerned about privacy settings, check out Chapter 12.
This book is accompanied by a companion website that includes a Digital 
Family Policy template as well as other material to help you raise your digital 
family safely and smartly. To access this additional content, point your web

Chapter 1
Meeting the Digital Family
In This Chapter
▶	Understanding “digital natives”
▶	Exploring areas that concern parents
A

ccording to the U.S. Census, the average American family has 2.6 chil­
dren, 3 televisions, and at least 1 home computer. Most kids receive 
their first mobile phone by middle school, and with nearly one-quarter of 
American adults owning a tablet device according to Pew Research Center, 
many children are growing up with access to digital applications nearly from 
birth. We cannot deny that we live in a digital age with everything from our 
phones to our kitchen appliances connected to the Internet. Many parents 
have begun to feel like it’s impossible to keep up with the ever-changing digi­
tal landscape and that their plugged in children speak a different language. 
There are also vast possibilities for learning, growth, and entertainment that 
we did not experience in our own childhoods.
As parents, even if we don’t understand every nuance of the digital world 
that our children (and we) live in, it’s important to set rules and parameters 
to help our kids navigate this brave new world. This book is chock-full of 
nuggets to help you become the digital parent you want to be for your digi­
tal native children, creating what I refer to as the “digital family.” This book 
covers the places where kids of various ages spend the most time online or 
otherwise enjoy technology as well as the basics of the most commonly used 
devices. All throughout this book, I show you how to use online resources for 
education, entertainment, and even family management.
Whatever concerns you had before picking up this book worry you most, 
being the parent of a digital native can be overwhelming. The technology that 
your children are growing up with may be unfamiliar to you. Even if you dive 
right into technology as quickly as your children, you may not be aware of 
how your children are experiencing the same platforms and devices and the 
challenges and dangers that are unique to them.

10
Part I: Living in the Digital Age 
This book will equip you, though, as a digital parent, to become the head 
of your digital family, protecting them the best you can from online pitfalls 
to guide them to make the most of this amazing and ever-growing world of 
technology. Feel empowered! This is a brave, new world you are living in, and 
there is so much that it has to offer today’s parents and children.
Guiding Your Digital Natives
Children today are “digital natives,” born into the world of smartphones, 
touchscreens, and connectivity like never before in history. You, the parent, 
must learn about this technology and the risks and rewards it holds for your 
children to help them maximize its benefits as well as mitigate its dangers.
In Chapter 2, I walk you through creating a Digital Family Policy, which is 
a comprehensive document covering everything from online requests for 
credit card information to where your family stores devices while charging. 
Chapter 19 provides you with even more tools as you visit platforms and 
apps created specifically to help today’s busy digital family manage their con­
stantly changing needs.
Of course, different ages of children shape your choices and rules. 
Throughout the book, I discuss devices, apps, and family rules by age group 
whenever possible.
Birth to preschool
Children from birth to preschool age typically experience technology in the 
arms of their parents through applications on tablets or smartphones or 
time spent viewing television programming selected by their parents. At this 
stage, parents have far less to worry about in terms of outside influences 
through technology or difficulties limiting access and screen time. Some par­
ents may opt out of this early exposure entirely, but the popularity of apps 
and products aimed at the age 3 and younger set suggests that most have not. 
For those parents looking to regain control of their tablets, see Chapter 16 for 
my discussion of tablets created specifically for children, some with a sug­
gested starting age of birth.

11
 Chapter 1: Meeting the Digital Family
Elementary
After children reach the preschool to young elementary age group, the vari­
ety of products available geared specifically toward them expands signifi­
cantly. Many of the handheld gaming devices that I cover in Chapter 15 are 
created with this age group in mind, and many kids in this age group also 
enjoy the game consoles described in Chapter 6. This is the age when hidden 
screen and Internet time begins to become a concern for many parents as 
kids begin to take part in play dates in friends’ homes and are given a bit 
more freedom to choose their own activities within the home. In Chapter 5, I 
deal with parents’ struggle to fully understand where kids are plugging in to 
help you locate that often overlooked digital time. This is also the age group 
when you will need to begin discussion about online etiquette (Chapter 4), 
exposure to advertising (Chapter 9), and participation in social media cre­
ated just for this age group (Chapter 11). There are also a vast number of 
educational websites perfect for this period of childhood, and Chapter 18 
will help you make the best of those.
Tweens
Children who have reached the tween years will begin to enjoy a digital 
freedom for which their younger siblings are not quite ready. This means 
access to more websites, tools, and devices — potentially, including their 
first smartphone! It also means more interaction online with strangers and 
the danger that comes with that. In Chapter 3, I walk you through some of 
these dangers, including online predators and other potential consequences 
of oversharing from this age group. Likely to be interacting online with peers 
they know — and perhaps some they don’t — tweens will need guidance 
regarding online chats (covered in Chapter 7), as well as the issue of cyber­
bullying (discussed in depth in Chapter 10). Should you decide that your 
tween is, in fact, ready for a smartphone, be sure to read Chapter 17.
Teens
After your child is age 13, the Internet becomes his oyster with online plat­
form restrictions lifted on access to everything from Facebook to blogging 
platforms. Part III walks you through your child’s entrance into the world of 
adult social media platforms as well as blogging and other opportunities to 
catch the entrepreneurial bug. Before cutting your kids loose on Google or 
Bing, searching for information they need, check out Chapter 8, helping you 
help them navigate search engines. And with access to smartphones now 
essentially a must-do, stop by that smartphone chapter again to find tips for 
talking to your teens about both texting and driving and the topic of sexting.

12
Part I: Living in the Digital Age 
Fighting Foes You Know — 
And Those You Don’t
Every parent worries about their children’s well-being, and the constant con­
nectedness of the digital age provides many more opportunities for parents 
to be concerned. Most parents agree that such issues as offensive material, 
digital overload, and the costs to keep a family digitally plugged in are concern­
ing, but parents should consider other issues — some highly dangerous — 
when creating their Digital Family Policy. Throughout the book, I cover the 
following concerns that all parents should have.
Inappropriate content
Graphic images, inappropriate language, and adult content are only a click 
away, and most kids with unsupervised online access have stumbled upon this 
inappropriate content at least once in their online experiences. Children are 
naturally curious and can easily locate inappropriate content while searching 
for something else for a school project or to answer a question. Links to inap­
propriate content appear in confusing spam e-mails, and sometimes friends 
will text or message unsuitable material without parents knowing.
In Chapter 8 (on navigating search engines), I walk you through some ways to 
prevent this type of accidental access to inappropriate material. Using soft­
ware and parental controls on home computers and other Internet-enabled 
devices can also help to protect your children from accidentally viewing 
inappropriate content. Some options for these types of controls are dis­
cussed in Chapter 3 as well as Chapter 17, which covers mobile device moni­
tors specifically. Remember to discuss content guidelines when creating your 
Digital Family Policy, which I cover in depth in Chapter 2.
Screen time overload
Many families set guidelines for the amount of screen time their children can 
consume during the day. Even so, the typical teen and tween consume more 
than seven hours a day of entertainment media, from devices with screens 
from television viewing to smartphone texting to internet browsing on the 
home computer.
And although monitoring screen time in your own home is fairly easy, chil­
dren also receive quite a bit of additional screen time at school, in friends’ 

13
 Chapter 1: Meeting the Digital Family
homes, and in less-obvious places, such as doctor’s waiting rooms. In 
Chapter 5, you can read about some of the locations where kids may be 
plugged in without you realizing it, as well as strategies to limit this addi­
tional screen time. With so many opportunities for kids to stare at a screen, 
it’s easy to see why screen time overload is a common concern for parents. 
Screen time rules are a critical piece of the Digital Family Policy, which I 
show you how to create in the next chapter.
Cost to stay connected
According to an iYogi survey, the average American family now spends 
more on monthly technology bills than on monthly utilities. Don’t forget to 
include such topics as device replacement and updating of equipment into 
your Digital Family Policy to deal with requests for the “latest and greatest” 
before they occur. Explaining the family policy for replacing broken devices 
may also encourage the members of your family to be more careful with their 
gadgets. Chapter 2 covers planning where you would like your family to stay 
connected — in your home, that is — including appropriate placement of the 
home computer and an approved charging location for devices.
Online child predators
Many parents believe that their children are interacting only within their 
safe circle of friends when online, but the startling fact is that according 
to the Crimes Against Children Research Center at the University of New 
Hampshire, one in five U.S. teenagers who use the Internet has reported 
receiving an unwanted sexual solicitation while online. Even more frighten­
ing, many children don’t understand the importance of not sharing their per­
sonal information online.
Online predators go where the children are online. For example, they may 
visit the same celebrity pages on Facebook or fan forums that are popular 
with young teens. They often pretend to be teens themselves and find ways 
to gain the trust of children online, messaging them privately and Friending 
them on social media platforms. Some experts have found that predators use 
social gaming, which I cover in Chapter 6, as a way to connect with potential 
victims through video and chat.
Despite the prevalence of online child predators, many parents aren’t 
aware of the threat because only about 25 percent of children who have 
been approached by an online predator reported this encounter to an adult 
according to the Crimes Against Children Research Center. In Chapter 3, I 

14
Part I: Living in the Digital Age 
cover the topic of online predators at length, providing you with tips on how 
your children can avoid them and also providing you with options for moni­
toring and protecting your children on your home computer. Your Digital 
Family Policy should include a section with procedures for reporting these 
encounters to adults — and if necessary, the appropriate authorities.
Cyberbullying
Cyberbullying occurs when one child targets another child using interac­
tive technologies, such as texting, e-mailing, messaging, or social media 
platforms. The cyberbully may use hateful language or even post threats 
or warnings. At times, cyberbullies befriend the victim to gain personal or 
embarrassing information or photos, which they then share publicly as a 
way to harass or shame the bullying victim. Cyberbullying in extreme cases 
involves the creation of hate sites or even the hacking of victim e-mail or 
social media accounts.
As of this writing, 49 U.S. states have laws about bullying, and many states 
have updated these laws to include cyberbullying. Forty-five states have spe­
cific laws regarding electronic harassment making cyberbullying not just a 
family issue, but a criminal issue.
When creating your Digital Family Policy, set aside time to discuss cyberbul­
lying with your children, including rules for reporting cases of being bullied 
as well as consequences should your child participate in online harassment. 
Be sure to read Chapter 10 during the creation of your Digital Family Policy 
because that chapter covers the topic of cyberbullying at length, including 
tips on how to speak to your kids about the topic.
Your children’s digital footprint
A digital footprint is essentially a digital trail left every time you appear online, 
interact online, search online, and more. It may include tracking of your 
home computer’s IP (Internet Protocol) address or your Internet browser’s 
search history. It also includes saved chat message, e-mails, and shared digi­
tal images of you or your children. Most people understand that Facebook 
profiles and blog posts are part of their digital footprint, but they might not 
realize that comments on blogs, product reviews on retailer sites, and photo­
graphs in which they are tagged also leave a digital footprint.
Most children will have a digital footprint attached to their name before they 
really understand the implications of this digital footprint. Future employers 
and even colleges may search for the digital footprint of a candidate before 
making a decision about hiring them or accepting them into their school.

15
 Chapter 1: Meeting the Digital Family
When discussing online etiquette and rules as part of the creation of your 
family’s Digital Family Policy, also take time to discuss not only the facets of 
a digital footprint, but also the future repercussions. I discuss your child’s 
digital footprint in more detail in Chapters 3 and 4.
Identity theft
Most every adult has heard of identity theft, but very few parents realize 
that their children can also be the victims of identity theft. Children’s Social 
Security numbers and other personal information are very enticing to iden­
tity thieves because kids have a financial clean slate. Predators then use this 
information to do everything from opening credit cards to purchasing homes.
Kits, software, and protection plans are available to help protect your fam­
ily’s identities online. And you can take steps to make your family less at risk 
for identity theft. Chapter 3 helps you understand child identity theft and 
how to prevent it from happening in your family. Including these steps in the 
rules section of your Digital Family Policy will help protect all members of 
your family from the danger of identity theft.
The ’Net’s no invisibility cloak: IP addresses
Many people erroneously believe the Internet 
offers them a level of anonymity. After all, how 
can anyone see your true identity? However, 
just by connecting to the Internet, you share 
information about your computer, your geo­
graphical location, and the websites you visit 
because of your IP address.
An IP address  is a string of numbers unique to your 
computer that identifies your computer on the 
Internet. Websites can tell when your computer 
visits that site based on this unique identifier. 
So don’t be lulled into thinking you or your chil­
dren are invisible while surfing the Internet. 
Technologies exist that can track your online 
activity and potentially expose your personal 
information to others.
If you’re curious to see your computer’s public 
IP address, simply type What is my IP address 
into the search field at Google. Your comput­
er’s IP address will display above the search 
results!

16
Part I: Living in the Digital Age 
Advertising to your children
While parents typically approve the media their children consume, they 
may not realize that seemingly innocent educational websites and children’s 
social media platforms often include a large amount of advertising aimed at 
children. Most parents are aware of ads that appear in sidebars and at the 
top of the page on websites, but advertisers trying to reach children also 
often mask these advertisements as special gaming opportunities or unex­
pected links within existing games and content.
For parents who wish to limit their children’s exposure to consumer advertis­
ing, these somewhat deceptive advertising practices may come as a surprise. 
In Chapter 9, I discuss how to identify these less obvious forms of advertis­
ing as well as how to set rules for children regarding interacting with these 
advertisements and the dangers of doing so.

eeping up to date on ever-changing technology can be a daunting task 
for parents who are navigating a digital world daily as well. However, 
the benefits of today’s online tools and useful gadgets greatly outweigh the 
safety concerns associated with their use. The keys to safely exploring the 
modern digital landscape with your family are understanding the world in 
which our digital native children are being raised and setting appropriate 
guidelines that work for your family. Just as you would create a family plan 
for fire safety, a list of numbers to call in case of emergency, or a calendar 
of weekly activities, a Digital Family Policy should become ingrained in the 
fabric of your family — a living document that changes with innovation as 
well as the growth and maturation of your children.
As you read other chapters throughout this book, keep this chapter in mind. 
Here, I outline the key areas of focus for your family’s Digital Family Policy, 
but other chapters cover many areas of the policy in much greater detail. 
Keeping your family’s Digital Family Policy in mind as you read this book will 
help you begin to make decisions about your own policy creation.

18
Part I: Living in the Digital Age 
Creating Guidelines by Age Category
One word that every parent hears far more than they’d like is the word “fair.” 
Kids for generations have complained that their parents’ rules are not fair 
and that one sibling is getting a better deal than the other. However, when it 
comes to technology, fair and appropriate may not be related. It makes the 
most sense for you to create different device rules according to age category 
rather than create one rule that applies to your entire family. Consider using 
the following age categories, which I outline in Chapter 1.
	
✓	Birth to preschool: This youngest age group is not at all immune to the 
digital world. Some children can operate a touchscreen device before 
they can even walk. With apps and devices created specifically for this 
demographic, you need to set specific guidelines for your little ones, 
paying close attention to screen time limits and appropriateness of 
content.
	
✓	Young elementary: Children in this demographic are often able to oper­
ate technology without parent supervision but still require this supervi­
sion to guide them to proper and safe use.
	
✓	Tweens: In many ways, tweens may appear to rule the digital world. This 
age group is catered to by tech companies with products created spe­
cifically for them and online worlds inhabited primarily by other tweens 
like them. This is also the age when most children receive their first 
mobile phone, opening up a whole new world of technology and connec­
tivity. Your rules for tweens may require fewer restrictions but are likely 
to cover more devices.
	
✓	Teenagers: Teenagers want their freedom. They also want their technol­
ogy. This is the age when kids are beginning to lay down their digital 
footprint and make online decisions that may affect their entire lives. 
Although most teenagers will be given many freedoms, they may also 
need much guidance.
Setting Screen Time Guidelines 
for Home and Away
The most basic place for your family to start when creating your Digital 
Family Policy is setting screen time limits. Be sure to include time spent 
watching television and movies and playing video games away from home, 
such as at friends’ homes. To read more about the variety of places where 
kids are plugging in, see Chapter 5. Consider adding the following specifics to 
this section of your policy:

19
 Chapter 2: Creating a Digital Family Policy
	
✓	Total amount of screen time allowed during the week and the weekend
	
✓	Type of screen time allowed during the week and the weekend (such as 
television during the week, but game consoles only on the weekend)
	
✓	Types of devices that may be used in friends’ homes, including going 
online and game devices
	
✓	Changes in screen time and type allowed during special times, such as 
spring break
Establishing Mobile Phone Usage Rules
In Chapter 17, I cover mobile phones — smartphones and feature phones — 
in depth, including presenting a variety of options for limiting your children’s 
phone capabilities. The average family’s Digital Family Policy will include 
mobile phone usage rules after their children reach the tween age category, 
usually around the end of elementary school or the beginning of middle 
school. However, each plan is individual, and you may wish to keep mobile 
phones on the banned device list until your child is a bit older.
Although your family will likely set different mobile phone–related policies 
based on the age of your children, all these topics are worth discussing with 
each child in your home who does or ever will use a mobile phone. This is a 
good opportunity to remind your children that privileges and responsibilities 
related to phone use will change as they mature.
Emergency-only versus social use
When creating the mobile phone section of your Digital Family Policy, include 
specific rules about when and why your child’s mobile device should be 
used. Be sure your policy answers the following questions:
	
✓	When can the phone be used?
	
	For example, is the phone for weekend use only or perhaps just after 
school? Can the phone be used at home or just when your child is not 
with you?
	
✓	What are appropriate reasons for phone use?
	
	Is the purpose of the phone simply to call home in the event of an emer­
gency or change in schedule, or can the phone be used socially to chat 
with friends?

20
Part I: Living in the Digital Age 
	
✓	What constitutes an emergency?
	
	For example, is it appropriate use for your child to call to request that a 
forgotten homework assignment be dropped off at school, or is that an 
abuse of phone privileges?
Use of applications
If your child has a smartphone with access to downloadable apps, you need 
to include guidelines for app purchases and downloads in your Digital Family 
Policy. You may want to consider from the following options:
	
✓	No apps are allowed on the phone.
	
✓	Apps must be downloaded by a parent.
	
✓	Apps must be approved by a parent.
	
✓	App permissions must be approved by a parent before the app may be 
downloaded.
	
✓	Apps can be downloaded by the child but removed if they do not meet 
parental approval.
	
Be sure to also discuss who will pay for the apps on your child’s phone.
Limiting when and how much to text
Text messaging has become a way of life for teens and some tweens, with 
some kids texting several thousand times per month. To keep texting from 
taking over your child’s life — and your budget — consider including the fol­
lowing rules in your Digital Family Policy:
	
✓	Where your child may text
	
	Consider setting boundaries, such as no phones at the dinner table.
	
✓	What times of day your child may text
	
	You may want to restrict texting to only before or after school or per­
haps just on weekends.
	
✓	How many texts can be sent and received
	
	Some text plans allow you to restrict the number of texts and will block 
text functioning after that limit is reached.
	
✓	Who will pay for texts
	
	Don’t forget about overage charges.

21
 Chapter 2: Creating a Digital Family Policy
	
Text charges can add up very quickly if you don’t have a package with unlim­
ited texting. If your teen texts often, consider upgrading your package or 
installing an app to block text functions.
	
Don’t forget to include a conversation about texting and driving with all 
your children! For more information on how to have this conversation, visit 
Chapter 17.
Data content guidelines
Very few phone plans include unlimited data use, and overage charges can be 
very expensive. Monitor your child’s data use by visiting your mobile service 
provider’s website and setting up an online account.
As I discuss in Chapter 17, smartphones that include data plans are now far 
more common than call and text-only feature phones. This makes it very 
likely that your child’s first mobile device will include data capabilities. When 
you write the phone section of your Digital Family Plan, be sure to set guide­
lines regarding both data content and data use.
Your data usage guidelines may include the following:
	
✓	No Internet browsing
	
✓	No Internet browsing without parental permission of specific content
	
✓	Use of public Wi-Fi only in pre-approved locations
	
✓	Restricting data functions to certain days or times of day
	
In Chapter 17, I also talk about parental controls and tools that you can use to 
limit your child’s access to the data capabilities on their smartphone.
Appropriate use of camera functions
Any parent who has had a child snap a photo of them before they’ve had 
their morning cup of coffee knows that camera phones can be a cause for 
concern in the hands of children. Our phones tend to go with us everywhere, 
including locations where you would not otherwise take a camera, such as 
bedrooms and bathrooms. If your child’s phone includes camera and video 
camera functions, include the following topics when discussing your Digital 
Family Policy:

22
Part I: Living in the Digital Age 
	
✓	Remind your children to ask permission before taking photos and videos 
of people.
	
✓	Review locations where photography and videography are not appropri­
ate, such as in classrooms, changing rooms at the mall, and bathrooms.
	
✓	Ask your child to not record conversations without people’s knowledge 
and consent.
	
✓	Remind your children that even if a friend has approved having a pho­
tograph or video of them taken, that may not mean that they approve of 
that content being shared. Ask permission before sharing!
	
✓	Remind your children that a camera phone should never be used to 
bully or hurt other people.
	
Tell your children that after they share an image, they can never take it back. 
Think carefully before deciding what to put out into the world.
For more information on how to talk to your kids about cyberbullying, visit 
Chapter 10.
	
Some mobile device parental control software allows you to disable the 
camera function on your child’s phone.
Contact list restrictions
When creating the mobile phone section of your Digital Family Policy, include 
a section specifically addressing your child’s contact list. Address the follow­
ing issues:
	
✓	Is your child allowed to add friends to contacts, or is the phone for 
family only?
	
✓	Does your child need to get parental permission before adding someone 
to their contact list?
	
✓	Does your child need to allow parental access to the phone’s contact list 
at all times?
Guidelines for GPS and location services
Most mobile phones come equipped with GPS or location-determining capa­
bilities. Many apps, including most social networking platforms, will request 
that your child provide location determining access. Create guidelines for 
each age group of your family regarding the use of these functions. Many 
safety experts agree that it is highly dangerous for children and teens to pub­
licly disclose their location through their mobile phones. To read more about 
this concern, visit Chapter 3.

23
 Chapter 2: Creating a Digital Family Policy
	
Even if you disable GPS functionality on a mobile device, rest assured that 
most emergency services are still able to determine your child’s location 
through a working mobile phone.
Creating Rules for Internet Usage
With most families owning a personal computer and more than three-quarters 
of teenagers owning a smartphone (according to U.S. Census data), the vast 
majority of kids and teens have access to the Internet — and many of them 
unsupervised during this access. It is critical to set clear usage guidelines for 
Internet usage to protect both your kids and you.
Determine rules for sharing e-mail 
addresses and information
Children are faced with requests for e-mail addresses and contact informa­
tion from the very first moment they attempt to create an account on a 
favorite website. Children younger than age 13 are asked to share parent 
e-mail addresses, while teens are able to use their own information to create 
accounts everywhere from educational sites to social media.
	
See Chapter 11 for information about the Children’s Online Privacy Protection 
Act (COPPA).
As soon as your children are old enough to use the Internet without constant 
parental guidance — or they’re old enough to have their own e-mail address — 
you should discuss your family’s rules for sharing e-mail addresses and other 
identifying information. Most sites that require account creation to use the 
site also require the disclosure of an e-mail address. Consider discussing the 
following guidelines in your family’s Digital Family Policy:
	
✓	Ask your elementary and tween children to receive parental permission 
before sharing an e-mail address with anyone requesting such informa­
tion, including offline requests in locations such as activity and school 
forms.
	
✓	Set specific guidelines regarding when it’s okay for your teens to share 
e-mail addresses, including the sharing of parent e-mail addresses. For 
example, is it always okay when filling out paperwork for after-school 
activities and sports, but requires parental permission in online contact 
forms?
	
✓	Consider creating a shared family e-mail account with a password con­
trolled by parents. Use this e-mail address for online account creation 
on websites for kids.

24
Part I: Living in the Digital Age 
When discussing this section of your Digital Family Policy, speak to your kids 
about the importance of protecting personal and identifying information, 
such as full name, birthdate, and address. Remind them to never share their 
Social Security number with anyone and to tell you should a website request 
that information. Chapter 3 covers the dangers of sharing information in 
much more depth.
	
Information shared online can never be taken back!
Set policies for credit card requests
Children and teens are faced with credit card requests for everything from 
app downloads to premium account creations to online purchases. Many 
teens are armed with a family credit card or know where to access your 
credit card information. You may even have saved your credit card location 
on common shopping sites, such as Amazon.com. Include a section in your 
Digital Family Policy with rules on the appropriate response should a site or 
mobile app request access to credit card information. Some guidelines may 
include
	
✓	Never allow your child to input credit card information. Require that 
parents are asked to decide on the account creation and be the ones to 
submit the information.
	
✓	Allow using credit cards online and on mobile devices only with prior 
parental permission.
	
✓	Allow the use of credit cards online only on approved sites.
	
✓	Allow using credit cards online only if the teen owns and pays for the 
credit card.
Create guidelines for search engine use
Search engines are a gateway to nearly endless information and entertain­
ment, but they also connect your children to an often unfiltered world. Before 
allowing your kids to use search engines, set specific guidelines within your 
Digital Family Policy. Guidelines may include the following:
	
✓	No using search engines for kids below a certain age group
	
✓	Supervised use of search engines only
	
✓	No image searches
	
✓	Using search engines with parental controls only
	
✓	Using search engines for educational purposes only

25
 Chapter 2: Creating a Digital Family Policy
	
Visit Chapter 8 to read more about setting filters on popular search engines 
and sites, such as YouTube.
Establish a list of approved 
and banned sites
If your children are spending time on the Internet without direct adult super­
vision, consider creating two website lists and storing them within your 
Digital Family Policy:
	
✓	Approved websites: If you would like to greatly restrict your children’s 
Internet access, consider creating a list that contains the only sites your 
children are permitted to access. Bookmark these websites on your 
computer’s browser or table to make access to these sites easy and 
direct. Allow your child to update the list as they get older and learn 
about new and appropriate sites.
	
✓	Banned sites: If you allow your children to explore the Internet with a 
bit of freedom but you prefer that they don’t visit specific popular yet 
inappropriate sites, consider creating a banned site list within your 
Digital Family Policy. This list can be revisited both to remove and add 
sites as you and your family see fit. In Chapter 3, I talk about ways to 
block specific sites on your home computer.
	
Popular social media sites (such as Facebook) contain age restrictions within 
their terms of service. Use site age guidelines to help you create approved/
banned website lists and to help you explain these rules to your children.
Rules for social media and chat capabilities
When creating rules for Internet usage, set specific rules about the use of 
social media and chat capabilities. Many sites, from online worlds to chil­
dren’s social media, provide kids with the ability to chat with strangers 
online. When creating the social media and chat section of your Digital Family 
Policy, include the following areas:
	
✓	Which social media and online world sites your children are allowed to 
participate in, by age group
	
✓	Restrictions and guidelines for the use of each of these sites, which typi­
cally contain various levels of capabilities and functions
	
✓	Guidelines for privacy settings on social media and other online 
accounts
	
✓	Rules regarding parent access to each child-owned account

26
Part I: Living in the Digital Age 
	
✓	Guidelines for creation of friend and buddy lists, including whether 
parental approval is required before adding someone to a list
	
✓	Guidelines regarding chat functions on all platforms with this capability, 
including what level of chat, if any, is allowed
For more information about online chat functions, see Chapter 7. Part III 
introduces you to the world of social media, including platforms created spe­
cifically for children and tweens.
	
Not ready to allow your kids to create their own social media profiles? 
Consider a shared account, such as a family Facebook page, that you can all 
build and update together.
Deciding the Best Location 
for Your Family Computer
I think the many apps and programs available for parents to monitor their 
children’s online activity are important, but nothing is quite as effective as 
actually spending time with your children while they are online. Not only 
does this give you a chance to demonstrate good online behavior as an exam­
ple, but it also provides you with an opportunity to observe your children’s 
online behaviors.
The conversation regarding the location of your family computer may be 
between you and your partner rather than you and your children. However, 
the guidelines for computer location should still be included in your Digital 
Family Policy. Many families still have a desktop computer that stays in one 
location all the time. With the rise of laptops and tablets, however, your fam­
ily’s computer might be a device that can be transported around your home 
and even outside your home. Consider the following rules for your family’s 
computer to protect the safety of your children at all ages:
	
✓	Place the family’s desktop computer in a highly trafficked area, such as 
the kitchen, family room, or homework area of the house.
	
✓	Require kids in certain age groups —preschoolers, elementary, and 
tweens — to only use computers and tablets with parental supervision.
	
✓	Do not allow Internet-connected computers and devices in children’s 
bedrooms.

27
 Chapter 2: Creating a Digital Family Policy
Setting Rules for Device Storage, 
Recharging, and Replacement
Much like deciding where to place the family’s computer, setting the loca­
tion of device storage and recharging stations should be made with safety in 
mind. Consider choosing a central location where all your family’s devices 
can be stored and charged when not in use. You can easily find products that 
can charge multiple devices at one time, cutting down on cord clutter and 
outlet overload. Also consider a policy against storing and charging mobile 
devices in bedrooms, especially kids’ rooms.
Even with specific rules about device storage, there is still a chance that a 
family member will lose or break a device. Before allowing your children to 
use a family device or receive a device of their own (such as a mobile phone), 
set guidelines within your Digital Family Policy for device replacement. 
Consider the following questions:
	
✓	If your child breaks or loses a device, will she be required to pay for it?
	
✓	If your child breaks or loses a device, will she be given a replacement?
	
✓	If your child breaks or loses a device, will she lose other digital 
privileges?
Even the most responsible kids make mistakes, and there are very few among 
us who have not misplaced something important. Be sure to set these rules 
prior to an incident occurring, when emotions may be running high.
Following Rules for Password Creation, 
Storage, and Sharing
Your digital family likely has passwords and pins for a variety of purposes, 
including the following:
	
✓	PIN passwords for phones
	
✓	Passwords to unlock tablets and computers
	
✓	App store PINs or passwords
	
✓	Passwords for website accounts
	
✓	E-mail passwords
To maintain these passwords, you may want to create rules about password 
creation and storage and include these rules in your Digital Family Policy.

28
Part I: Living in the Digital Age 
Create safe passwords
A password may not seem like an important topic to kids, but passwords are 
the gateway to access personal information and should thus be taken very 
seriously. Discuss with your kids the following tips to create safe passwords:
	
✓	Include uppercase and lowercase letters.
	
✓	Include numbers as well as letters.
	
✓	Include other characters and symbols besides numbers and letters.
	
✓	Do not include a complete word.
	
✓	Do not include the child’s name.
	
✓	Do not include other identifying information, such as a birthdate, an 
address, or a pet’s name
Establish a password storage location
To manage a large number of passwords across family members and 
accounts, create a rule for safe password storage. Consider the following 
options:
	
✓	Choose a safe location where you can keep all passwords written down.
	
	This may not be a safe strategy in a public place such as an office, but 
you should be okay in your own home. Consider choosing a secure loca­
tion, such as a filing cabinet drawer that can be locked.
	
✓	Purchase software or an application that remembers your passwords, 
including different passwords across devices and platforms.
	
During the passwords discussion in the creation of your Digital Family Policy, 
discuss family policies regarding which passwords you will require your 
children to share with you and which accounts, if any, they can maintain on 
their own.
Teach children the importance 
of password protection
After teaching your children tricks and tips for safe password creation and 
discussing rules for sharing passwords with you, also discuss the importance 
of protecting passwords from others. Children are often unable to compre­
hend that the friends they have today may not be their friends tomorrow. 

29
 Chapter 2: Creating a Digital Family Policy
Kids are likely to share personal information, including device and account 
passwords. See Chapter 3 for more on online safety and Chapter 4 for more 
on appropriate behavior online. When discussing passwords with your 
family, urge them to keep others from seeing their passwords and require 
them to never share their password with others, even their closest friends.
Setting Gaming Rules
Children as young as preschool age enjoy game console games, and handheld 
gaming devices are available for kids 18 months to 18 years. While you may 
want to include gaming in screen time limits and rules for appropriate activi­
ties when visiting friends’ homes, there are two main areas regarding gaming 
that should be considered priorities when creating your Digital Family Policy: 
game ratings and multiplayer games online.
Game rating guidelines
In Chapter 6, I introduce you to the Entertainment Software Rating Board 
(ESRB) ratings. This ratings system allows you to read the age recommenda­
tions for all games available for game consoles and many games available 
for handheld gaming devices. These ratings also provide you with additional 
feedback focusing on specific areas of content, such as violence and sexual 
content.
Include specific game ratings guidelines for each member of your family, 
which can be applied across all devices. You may wish to include ratings 
exceptions on a game by game basis after previewing content or reading an 
in-depth game summary and ratings summary.
To enforce these game restrictions, consider setting the parental controls 
on each of your children’s devices. To read more about how to implement 
parental controls, see Chapter 6.
Co-play and social gaming guidelines
Many game consoles, including handheld gaming devices, come equipped 
with the ability to co-play with one or even multiple players via a Wi-Fi con­
nection. Be sure to set specific rules about these capabilities, including 
whether your children are allowed to play multiple player games with chil­
dren online. Chapter 6 guides you to change settings that allow this type of 
interaction via game consoles.

Part I: Living in the Digital Age 
Reporting Incidents to Parents
One theme that I repeat throughout this book is the idea that open commu­
nication within the digital family is the best tool for keeping the family safe 
online and making the most of this amazing digital world we live in. Rules 
such as device usage guidelines and content restrictions may seem like the 
most important piece of the Digital Family Policy, but the discussion that you 
have with your family regarding reporting of concerning or upsetting inter­
actions may be the most important step in the creation of this document. 
Naturally, kids want to hide potentially upsetting or embarrassing informa­
tion, but as the head of a digital family, you can ensure that your kids feel 
safe and comfortable talking to you about their concerns.
Whether someone says something off-color to your child in a chat room or 
your child accidentally clicks an inappropriate link, chances are that your 
child will be exposed to unwelcome content at some point. Establish family 
guidelines for what steps to take when this happens before allowing your 
children to use the Internet without direct adult supervision. Consider asking 
your child to take the following steps:
	
1.	 Do not click any links that appear questionable or inappropriate.
	
2.	 Immediately stop responding to the person who has said or done some­
thing inappropriate or questionable.
	
3.	 Do not close the screen or delete the content prior to showing an adult.
	
4.	 Get a parent or adult immediately, tell them what happened, and if pos­
sible, show them the content.
In Chapter 3, I talk about online predators at length, including information 
about how you may report this type of behavior. This chapter also intro­
duces options for monitoring and prevention tools, which you may want to 
install on devices to help prevent access to inappropriate information.
Establishing Consequences
No family policy is easy to enforce without consequences that accompany 
each guideline and rule. As a family, decide what consequences are most 
appropriate for each section of your policy. Then, as the head of your digital 
family, be prepared to enforce these consequences. This may mean time 
away from devices, cutting back on allowances until broken devices are 

31
 Chapter 2: Creating a Digital Family Policy
replaced, or taking a step back on the level of privileges. Whatever conse­
quences you choose, be sure to communicate them at the same time that 
the policy is created to make them clear to all the members of your family. I 
strongly recommend creating a no-tolerance policy on dangerous behaviors, 
such as cyberbullying, sexting, and texting while driving.
	
Ask your children to sign your Digital Family Policy or create device-specific 
contracts, such as a contract for mobile phone use.

Putting Safety First
In This Chapter
▶	Setting digital device privacy settings
▶	Using available monitoring and protective products
▶	Being aware of digital footprints
▶	Helping children understand the dangers of oversharing
▶	Teaching kids about the risk of online predators
▶	Understanding the danger of identity theft
O

f the many concerns for parents raising kids in this digital age, safety 
concerns certainly top the list. You just can’t directly supervise chil­
dren all their digital time, but many tools are available to help keep children 
safe. With the right preparation, you can create a safe environment in which 
kids can enjoy and explore this digital frontier.
Most devices from mobile phones to game consoles as well as social media 
platforms like Facebook offer a range of privacy settings to protect users. 
Understanding and using such settings allows you to protect your children 
even when you’re not with them.
Providing your children with guidance about what to share online and what 
not to share also guards them from oversharing, potentially putting them­
selves in harm’s way. Sharing guidelines and discussing potential scenarios 
before allowing your children digital freedom may be all it takes to protect 
them from exposing themselves unwittingly to harm.
Later in this chapter, I discuss your child’s digital footprint. Although you 
want to make sure your child knows how to not leave a negative digital foot­
print, you should also discuss creating a positive digital footprint. You want 
to be forward-thinking: What will potential future employers or educational 
institutions find when they conduct an Internet search of your child’s name? 
Help your child understand how avoiding oversharing and including positive 
and appropriate content leaves a positive impression.

34
Part I: Living in the Digital Age 
Also with an eye to the future, you need to recognize the very real danger of 
identity theft. The information your children share online can not only affect 
them, but also the entire family. With proper understanding of appropriate 
online behavior and possible use of monitoring services, you can guide your 
digital family safely away from identity thieves.
Using Device Privacy Settings
Just as families often create parameters for device usage based on such fac­
tors as time limits and appropriate age ranges, remember to discuss privacy 
settings when creating your Digital Family Policy (see Chapter 2). Your family 
may opt to create stricter guidelines around certain devices — say, your 
teen’s phone that holds personal information — than perhaps home game 
consoles that don’t disclose personal information. Likewise, you may set dif­
ferent privacy guidelines for your tween than you do for your teen who may 
be using his smartphone for more than just communication with family.
In general, look for privacy settings that affect the following things:
	
✓	Whether companies have access to your information, such as through 
third-party applications, and what they can do with that information
	
✓	Who can find you through the device or platform
	
✓	How people can contact you
Most digital devices — smartphones and tablets, for example — come 
equipped with a variety of settings to help families protect their privacy as 
well as the privacy of their children. Providing your tweens and teens with a 
smartphone is a great way to stay connected while allowing them freedom. 
And using smartphone privacy settings is a quick and simple way to gain 
additional peace of mind.
The trick to using these tools is finding and understanding them on each 
device. For example, the settings on your child’s smartphone can help pass­
word-protect text messages and allow apps to locate the phone via GPS. After 
you decide on the safest settings for your family, be sure to include a device-
by-device set of guidelines within your Digital Family Policy.
Like smartphones, tablets also provide some basic privacy settings to keep 
the information contained within the tablet private. Also like smartphones, 
tablet settings differ according to the operating system (OS) of each tablet.

35
 Chapter 3: Putting Safety First
Screen locks
Screen locks require anyone attempting to gain access to a phone or tablet 
to input a predetermined set of information. Setting a screen lock not only 
prevents those without the password from using your teen’s phone but also 
from reading your teen’s personal texts and e-mails.
	
Each OS provides users with a version of a screen-locking option, and each 
one is slightly different.
Android
To implement a screen lock on an Android OS device, take the following 
steps:
	
1.	Tap Settings from the main menu.
	
2.	Tap Location & Security.
	
3.	Under Security, tap Set Up Screen Lock.
Android OS devices allow users to lock their screens using a variety of set­
tings options, as shown in Figure 3-1.

Windows
Windows phones allow anyone to use the Speech function to make a phone 
call without first unlocking the phone. However, the screen lock function 
does prevent unauthorized users from accessing private information, such as 
your child’s e-mails or contact list.
To set a screen lock on a Windows Phone 7, take the following steps:
	
1.	Navigate to the Settings icon and tap Lock+Wallpaper.
	
2.	Choose to turn on Password and enter a password in the New pass­
word text box.
	
3.	Reenter the password in the Confirm password text box.
	
4.	Select Done to save your settings.
To unlock your Windows Phone 7, flick your start screen upward to reveal a 
keypad where you can enter your password.
iOS
Apple products — the iPhone, iPad, and iPad mini — operate on the iOS 
platform.
iPhone
You can set a simple screen-lock password on iPhones. Take the following 
steps to create a passcode on an iPhone:
	
1.	Select Settings and tap General.
	
2.	On the General screen, select Passcode Lock.
	
	The Passcode Lock screen appears.
	
3.	Slide the Simple Passcode setting to On and then tap Turn Passcode 
On. (See Figure 3-2.)
	
4.	On the Set Passcode screen that appears, enter a four-digit numeric 
code and then re-enter it to confirm.
	
5.	Press the Home button to return to your Home screen.

iPad
Passcode Lock settings on iPads are very similar to the iPhone settings 
that I describe earlier. After you locate the Passcode Lock screen under the 
General settings, simply select Turn Passcode On to change the passcode set­
tings on your iPad.
GPS settings
GPS capability is another setting to consider when setting up your teen’s 
smartphone. GPS allows your teen’s smartphone location — and, therefore, 
your child’s location — to be tracked by everything from emergency services 
(such as the police) to the applications downloaded to your teen’s gadget. 
Some parents take comfort in knowing their teen’s location may be tracked 
through their phone in the event of an emergency, but other parents prefer 
that GPS be disabled to help protect against online predators. Find more 
on GPS and your child’s safety in Chapter 17 and later in this chapter in the 
“Avoiding Online Predators” section.
Android
To edit the GPS settings on an Android phone, follow these steps:
	
1.	Tap Settings from the main menu.
	
2.	Tap Location & Security.
	
3.	Determine your preferred settings from the choices that appear on 
your phone, as shown in Figure 3-3.
	
	 You can choose from a standalone GPS service, or one offered by your 
carrier or Google.
	
Even if you choose to turn off your other location settings, the location of your 
Android phone can still be determined by emergency 911 services if the phone 
is turned on.
Windows
The Windows Phone also allows you to set your own preferences for location 
services.
	
1.	Navigate to the Settings icon and tap Location.
	
2.	Select to turn off or turn on Location services.

Chapter 17 addresses more smartphone considerations, including setting 
smartphone use guidelines by age and using monitors available from your 
service provider. For example, many service providers offer the option to 
track everything from data usage and number of texts sent. They also typi­
cally allow account holders to block specific functions on your children’s 
phones.

Privacy in other online venues
I discuss privacy settings for gaming consoles in depth in Chapter 6. 
Understanding privacy options during online chats is covered in Chapter 7, 
and privacy settings on social media sites are covered in Part III. Keep in 
mind that social media platforms frequently change their privacy policies 
and default settings. Be sure to monitor the programs and platforms used by 
your family for updates that may affect your preferred settings.
Chapter 2 covers the creation of your Digital Family Policy in depth, and 
guides you through creating privacy setting guidelines.
Monitoring and Protecting: 
Tools for Parents
For many families, a Digital Family Policy is just the first step in providing 
children with a safe online experience. Some parents monitor activity and 
install protective software on devices.
When deciding whether monitoring tools and protective software are right 
for you and your family, keep in mind the ways to help your children stay 
safe online without taking this next step:
	
✓	Are you able to check the web browser history on your home’s comput­
ers, as described earlier in this chapter?
	
✓	Have you Friended your children on social media sites, as referenced in 
Part III?
	
✓	Have your children provided you with the passwords to their accounts, 
as I discuss in Chapter 2?

47
 Chapter 3: Putting Safety First
	
✓	Have you installed basic antivirus and anti-malware software on your 
devices to protect your family from dangerous sites, links, and pop-ups, 
as described later in this chapter?
	
✓	Have you activated privacy settings on the browsers, devices, and 
social media used by your children and teens, as described earlier in 
this chapter?
	
✓	Have you created a Digital Family Policy and gone over that policy with 
your children, as covered in Chapter 2?
If you’ve taken these steps and would still like to implement additional safety 
measures, it’s time to monitor your child’s activity and deploy protective 
software to block and restrict use on your family’s devices.
Monitoring tools can help you watch social media activity and provide you 
information regarding what your child is doing publicly. Other tools, how­
ever, can be installed on devices to provide parents with reports about what 
they are doing privately in chat locations and e-mails.
Protective software can block or filter keywords and site names to prevent 
access to certain websites and content. Programs offer different levels of 
coverage. Some simply block content the program considers inappropriate; 
others let you customize filtering and include time limits for computer use.
	
If your children use multiple devices in your home to access the Internet, you 
can block inappropriate sites on all devices connected to the same Internet 
router, including PCs and game consoles. These hardware-based solutions can 
apply Internet content filtering and Internet time scheduling to every Internet-
connected device in your home. These types of solutions are more difficult to 
customize than software and subscription-based filtering tools, though.
And you can install parental controls on smartphones. See Chapter 17.
The following are some of the most popular monitoring tools and protective 
software:
	
✓	Bsecure Online, Bsecure Family Safety (www.bsecure.com) features 
social media protection, online media filtering, parental alerts for 
web and social media networks, text and e-mail alerts, whole home–
filtering options, and integrated mobile filtering apps for Android and 
iOS devices.
	
✓	ChildWebGuardian (www.childwebguardian.com) screens page 
content for keywords and phrases, blocks blacklisted sites, allows for 
Internet use restrictions according to days and times, stores URLs of vis­
ited pages, sends reports via e-mail, restricts access to approved sites 
only, and allows gaming restrictions by day and time.

 Chapter 3: Putting Safety First
Leaving a Minimal Digital Footprint
A person’s digital footprint is essentially a digital first impression. As I men­
tion in Chapter 1, a child’s digital footprint includes all information related to 
that child posted online. For example, Google indexes everything from tweets 
on Twitter to comments on Facebook. Not only do many employers use 
Internet searches to research potential employees, but many colleges and 
universities have begun to tap into online profiles when making decisions 
about applicants.
Many tweens and teens aren’t aware that their actions online are tracked, 
recorded, and publicly available. Even those who have a vague awareness of 
their digital footprint probably don’t remember what personal information 
they’ve shared online, especially if they’re oversharing. Help your children to 
understand their digital footprint by searching online with them to find what 
information online is connected to their names and publicly available. If your 
children are just beginning to connect online, perhaps use your own digital 
footprint to show the importance of sharing only certain information.
	
Your kids may be leaving a breadcrumb trail, such as giving away personal ID 
information, without even knowing it or the potential negative consequences, 
including becoming a cyberbullying target, facing legal ramifications, losing a 
job, and more.
Identifying information
Although sharing embarrassing information or images online can be upset­
ting, a child publicly sharing too much identifying information is downright 
dangerous. Discourage your kids from sharing the following information 
publicly:
	
✓	Full birthday
	
✓	Phone number
	
✓	School name
	
✓	Names of immediate family members
	
✓	Address
	
✓	Current location
	
✓	Future location

50
Part I: Living in the Digital Age 
Strangers can use this information to target children and pretend to know 
them using other information shared online, such as names of Friends and 
lists of favorites. Remind your children someone who “knows” information 
about them may still be a stranger.
And sharing location information can also make it easier for stalkers and 
predators to locate children and teens. I discuss online predators in more 
depth later in this chapter.
Finally, as I cover later in this chapter, sharing personal data also makes it 
easier for identity thieves to use your child’s information.
Cyberbullying
Many tweens and teens feel comfortable sharing personal information from 
passwords to photographs with friends because they trust that they will 
never use that information to do anything hurtful. However, the shocking 
number of cyberbullying incidents has shown us that that is not always the 
case. Friends aren’t always “friends.”
Discuss with your children how they will feel if they share something deeply 
personal with a friend in writing via e-mail, text, or messaging, but someday 
down the road that person is no longer their “friend.” Could that information 
be shared with others or used to harass them — or your family? I discuss 
cyberbullying in more detail in Chapter 10, including signs that your children 
are being cyberbullied and also how to report it.
Sexting and legal risks
Sexting — sending sexually explicit messages and/or photos from one mobile 
phone to another — is not only oversharing, but may also put your tween 
or teen at legal risk. Under both federal and state laws, creating, possessing, 
or distributing explicit images of a minor is illegal. A minor who takes and 
shares explicit images of themselves may be prosecuted under these laws 
and may even be required to register as a sex offender! I discuss sexting fur­
ther in Chapter 17.
A precedent has been set in U.S. courts for attorneys to be able to use infor­
mation posted online for everything from an alibi to proof of culpability. 
Teens should be aware of potential legal ramifications of publicly posting 
their location, images, and information about their actions.

51
 Chapter 3: Putting Safety First
Loss of employment or educational 
opportunities
Teens might understand that sharing may affect their potential employ­
ment, but they may not realize that their part-time or summer employer may 
have policies regarding social media that affect them in the here and now. 
Employees have been fired because of social media postings on Facebook 
and Twitter related to their job. Ask your employed teen whether his 
employer has a social media policy — and if so, what restrictions it includes. 
Some employers go so far as to require employees to turn over personal 
social media account names and passwords to those accounts.
Some colleges and universities also have policies related to social media use, 
dismissing students who have behaved inappropriately or in a threatening 
way online.
Stolen images
Images shared online are indexed by search engines just as text posted 
online is indexed. Despite safety precautions (such as image watermarks), 
many photographs posted publicly on personal social media sites or blogs 
are stolen. These images may then appear anywhere from other online sites 
to print ads halfway around the world without the permission of the photo­
graph owner or those who appear in the photograph. Teens and tweens shar­
ing images publicly need to be aware that after images are posted, there is 
the potential for them to be used without permission.
Risk of burglary
Sharing information about upcoming vacations or new home purchases can 
be fun, but discourage your children from sharing this information publicly 
via social media. Sharing such information — say, when your home will be 
empty for a week while you’re basking in the tropics over the holidays — 
makes your home more susceptible to burglary. So does bragging online 
about new, large purchases. Children may unwittingly post other identifying 
information, such as your home address and phone number, making it easy 
(or at least, easier) for potential thieves to find your empty home or your 
new car in the driveway.

52
Part I: Living in the Digital Age 
When discussing social media parameters as part the creation of your Digital 
Family Policy, be sure to include strict guidelines about the types of informa­
tion your children should share publicly in relationship to your family and 
your home.
False sense of familiarity
Sharing large amounts of very personal information online as well as the 
common details of day-to-day life may make teens feel as if they really know 
their online Friends. Likewise, other people online may use this information 
to convince teens and tweens that their friendship is deep and real. The sad 
truth, though, is that there is no way to know whether the information being 
shared online is true and shared with honorable intent. And this false sense 
of familiarity may lead your teen to want to then meet online Friends in 
real life.
Help your children distinguish between online and real life friends when 
selecting both privacy settings and what to share online. Just as you would 
ask to approve what friends come into your home, ask for more informa­
tion about the Friends your teen or tween has connected with online. For 
sites where your teen is more likely to share very personal and identifying 
information and images, such as Facebook, consider requiring that your teen 
Friend real life friends only. More information about the dangers of a false 
sense of familiarity are covered later in this chapter in a discussion about 
online predators.
Avoiding Oversharing
In a hyperconnected world, it takes just moments to share anything online: 
from what you had for lunch to your current location. Today’s kids are 
growing up in a world where the private seems to be public, and people are 
plugged in around the clock, checking in online and updating social media 
statuses. This constant connectedness creates a vibrant sense of community 
and places unlimited resources at our children’s fingertips, but oversharing 
personal information also presents potential dangers. With “safety first” in 
mind, remember to include a frank discussion about oversharing as part of 
your family’s creation of a Digital Family Policy.
Although it’s certainly important to show restraint to keep from alienating 
friends and upsetting Grandma, there are very real safety concerns related 
to oversharing. In 2010, Consumer Reports (www.consumerreports.org) 
conducted a survey that found that more than one-half of social media users 
post risky information online. Teens are far less likely than adults to believe 
that the amount of information they’re sharing may be crossing a line.

53
 Chapter 3: Putting Safety First
Be sure to take the time to discuss motivation for sharing with your chil­
dren. For example, are they likely to tweet pictures of the food they’re eating 
because of an interest in cooking and recipe sharing? Do they share personal 
stories on their blog because they enjoy online journaling? Or has overshar­
ing just become a bad habit? Such a discussion may prove enlightening for 
both you as the parent and for your children.
Also ask your children to consider the audience when sharing digitally. For 
example, does your teen use just one Facebook account to connect with 
both friends and family, or does she have a personal account to interact with 
peers and a family account to keep up to date on family happenings? Tweens 
and teens should consider that although their friends may enjoy seeing 
pictures of last Friday night’s party, Grandma may be less interested in that 
photo album.
Teaching children the importance 
of restraint
To put it simply, just because you (or anyone, for that matter) can share 
every moment with the world, that doesn’t mean you should. Just as you ask 
your children to follow an acceptable code of conduct offline, take time to 
discuss a code of conduct for online behavior. Begin a discussion with your 
family by first talking about the ways in which we share “whatever” with 
the world.
Here’s a way to start the conversation ball rolling. If your teen has been digi­
tally connected through a variety of platforms for some time, consider going 
through past posts and updates with your kids to discuss appropriateness 
and even remove some past information. Also, ask your children to have a 
discussion with their friends regarding how they feel about sharing personal 
information online. Your kids may be less likely to send an embarrassing 
photo, for example, to a friend who has no qualms about then sharing that 
photo via Facebook or Twitter.
Social networking sites
Start with the main venues, including
	
✓	Twitter
	
✓	Facebook
	
✓	Instagram
	
✓	Foursquare

54
Part I: Living in the Digital Age 
Each of these social media platforms allows users to briefly and instanta­
neously share what is occurring in the user’s life (“Awesome grilled cheese 
sandwich - #lunch!”), and each platform also allows uploading an associated 
image. Due to the instantaneous nature of these services partnered with the 
fact that they are all available on smartphones, users can quite easily share 
personal information quickly and across many settings. Kids may be sharing 
information reactively rather than thoughtfully.
If your teen’s Foursquare, Twitter, and Instagram accounts (see Chapter 22 
for more information) are linked to their Facebook account, for example, 
they may find that their Facebook page has become a play-by-play account of 
their day rather than a place to occasionally update a status, share photos, 
and participate in groups. For teens who are connected across multiple plat­
forms, updates may be multiplied exponentially and become overwhelming 
to the audience.
Blogs
Many tweens and teens are also connected with the world through platforms 
(such as blogs and Tumblr, discussed in Chapters 14 and 22) that give kids a 
false sense of anonymity. Some kids, while hiding behind the assumed ano­
nymity of the website profile, are likely to share private and personal infor­
mation with far less restraint.
E-mail and texting
Also discuss one-to-one communication tools, such as text and e-mail, when 
discussing showing restraint with your kids. These platforms might seem pri­
vate and protected, but there is no way to ensure that the communications 
won’t be seen by anyone other than the intended recipient.
	
All in all, get your kids onboard, thinking hard about the connectivity between 
digital accounts when discussing the importance of showing restraint when it 
comes to sharing.
As a general rule, ask your children to consider the following before sharing 
information digitally:
	
✓	Is it potentially risky to share this information? If the answer is yes, you 
should not share it.
	
✓	Is there anyone who I would like to not be able to see this, such as my 
parents? If the answer is yes, consider not sharing it with anyone. After 
you share something digitally, there is no telling where it will go next.
	
✓	Will sharing this information hurt anyone? If the answer is yes, stop 
immediately.

55
 Chapter 3: Putting Safety First
	
✓	Is this something that my friends/family really want to know or see? 
If the answer is no, consider why you are sharing it. It may not be 
necessary.
	
✓	An hour from now, will I still be okay with this information being shared? 
If the answer is no, don’t share it now. Even if you delete the informa­
tion, it will still appear a variety of places including in e-mail updates 
and Google searches.
	
✓	Am I in an emotional state that may cause me to overshare and regret it 
later? If the answer is yes, wait and reconsider your post later.
Avoiding Online Predators
Online tools, such as social media networks and educational websites, can 
be a great resource for children and teens, but using them can put kids in the 
paths of online predators. In fact, according to the Crimes against Children 
Research Center (www.unh.edu/ccrc), one in five U.S. teenagers reports 
having received an unwanted sexual solicitation while online. Sites with chat 
rooms, instant messaging tools, and profiles posting contact information 
make it easy for kids to encounter strangers looking to take advantage of the 
anonymity of the internet to take advantage of young people. To protect your 
children from online predators, you need to first understand the risks.
Online predators locate children through a variety of online platforms includ­
ing blogs, discussion boards, social networks, and chat rooms. They then 
use the communication tools on these sites along with texting and e-mail 
to contact these targets. Typically, online predators will draw in children 
through time and attention. They will claim interest in the same hobbies, 
music, shows, and movies as the children they are targeting, and appear 
sympathetic to the children’s problems and concerns. They may even try to 
lure their targets through gifts. Eventually, they will begin to introduce inap­
propriate subjects and even content to the conversations, easing a child’s 
inhibitions.
Talking to teens about predators
Most children will never encounter an online predator, but the risk is still 
very real. Teach your children that online predators exist and how to protect 
themselves. Here are some discussion points for talking to your children 
about online predators.

56
Part I: Living in the Digital Age 
Anonymity
Children need to understand that people online can pretend to be anything 
and anybody. The children and teens they encounter on favorite social media 
and gaming platforms may be adults posing as young people. Because there 
is no way to really know who a person is that you have met online, set guide­
lines within your Digital Family Policy regarding Friend requests, chat plat­
forms, and the sharing of personal information.
Oversharing
Include online predators in your discussions about what information is 
public and what information is private. Many children and teens feel comfort­
able sharing very personal information with strangers online because they 
are able to hide behind online profiles and personas. Children should under­
stand that nothing online is ever really private, and they should use caution 
when sharing this information with strangers as it may be used against them 
in the future. This is another opportunity to reinforce that kids should never 
reveal personal and identifying information about themselves or their family 
publicly online, such as birthdate, phone number, and home address.
Private and offline communication requests
Prepare your children for potential requests from people they have met 
online to chat in private online rooms or even offline via text or phone. Set 
strict guidelines regarding these requests and encourage your children to 
come to you if someone online makes such a request.
E-mails and downloads
The Crimes against Children Research Center reports that one-quarter of 
children have been exposed to unwanted pornographic material online. Ask 
your children to never open e-mails or accept images or other documents to 
download from people they do not know in real life. Create a rule within your 
Digital Family Policy requiring children to notify you if they receive e-mails or 
images from strangers.
Secret keeping
Let your children know that a request from online Friends to keep a secret 
from parents or other adults is a red flag. Ask them to come to you if anyone 
online makes these types of requests.
Online persona
Discuss your child’s online persona with them. The profile name and profile 
image they select for use online may catch the attention of online predators. 
Encourage them to use gender-neutral screen names that do not contain 
sexually suggestive words. I cover this topic in depth in Chapter 4.

57
 Chapter 3: Putting Safety First
Meeting in real life
Your Digital Family Policy should include a rule that your children should 
never agree to meet a person in real life whom they have gotten to know 
online. According to an ABC News report (http://abcnews.go.com), 100 
percent of teens who became victims of sexual predators met the predator 
willingly.
Staying in the loop
As a parent, you also play a very important role in helping to protect your 
children. Even after you talk to your kids about online predators and set 
guidelines, here are steps you can take to ensure that your children are safe 
from online predators.
	
✓	Monitor online conversations and e-mail accounts. During the cre­
ation of your Digital Family Policy, prepare your children for the fact 
that accounts will be monitored for their safety. Maintain the ability to 
access your children’s social media and e-mail accounts, and monitor 
periodically for communication from strangers and inappropriate con­
tent from previously trusted contacts.
	
✓	Check online profiles. From time to time, check to see what information 
your children have made available both to the public via their online 
profiles as well as to Friends. Ask them to remove private and identify­
ing information, such as full birthdate and phone number.
	
✓	Follow social media age guidelines. Most social networking sites 
require that children be at least 13 years old to have an account. For 
your children’s safety, do not let them use sites for which they are not 
the correct age. I discuss social media platforms more in Part III.
	
✓	Restrict chat room use. Young children should not be allowed to visit 
chat rooms and use chat functions on websites. As your children get 
older, you will need to create age specific chat guidelines within your 
Digital Family Policy to address different chat settings. Chapter 7 pro­
vides more information regarding chat platforms and children.
	
✓	Keep your home computer in a public location. In Chapter 2, I discuss 
home computer location and phone docking stations as part of the 
creation of the Digital Family Policy. Keeping your home computer in a 
highly trafficked area of your home — a family room or kitchen — rather 
than in a child’s bedroom makes it less likely that they will engage in 
inappropriate conversations online or visit potentially dangerous web­
sites and chat rooms.

58
Part I: Living in the Digital Age 
	
✓	Install and use parental controls software and monitoring tools. A 
variety of tools are available to both monitor the use of your home’s 
personal computer as well as protect your children through the use 
of parental control settings. I discuss these tools in depth later in this 
chapter.
	
✓	Get hip to cyberslang. Kids have their own crypto-shorthand. Know 
how to recognize these code words at a glance to help protect your

✓	Keep communicating. According to the Pennsylvania Attorney General’s 
office (www.attorneygeneral.gov), only one-fourth of children 
nationally who say they received a sexual solicitation online also say 
that they told a parent about this unwanted communication. Keep lines 
of communication open and remind your children frequently that they 
can and should come to you with any concerns about online activity.
	
✓	Watch for warning signs. Here are some warning signs that may 
indicate that your child is communicating with an online predator. 
Your child
 
• Is withdrawn from the family
 
• Is receiving phone calls from an adult you don’t know
 
• Has child pornography on his computer
 
• Receives mail or packages from someone you don’t know
 
• Turns off the monitor quickly or changes screens/tabs when you 
walk into the room
 
• Spends large amounts of time online at night
If your child is the target of an online predator and receives sexually explicit 
photos or communications, contact your local police. Be sure to document 
any communication and save files and e-mails to turn over to the police. 
You can also report possible illegal online activity related to child pornog­
raphy, predation, or other child sexual exploitation to the National Center 
for Missing and Exploited Children’s CyberTipline at 1-800-843-5678 or www.
missingkids.com.
Avoiding Identity Theft
Another potential safety risk online is identity theft. Everyday actions from 
using a mobile phone or laptop to visiting the pediatrician may put both 
your child and your family at risk for identity theft. In fact, according to the 
Federal Trade Commission (FTC; www.ftc.gov), 9 million Americans have 
their identity stolen every year, and an increasing number of these victims 
were children younger than 18.

60
Part I: Living in the Digital Age 
Defining identity theft
Identity theft includes someone using another person’s identifying information — 
including name, credit card number, and Social Security number — without 
permission. Identity thieves use this information to commit a variety of fraud 
and theft crimes: for example, establishing accounts and obtaining credit 
cards in the victim’s name.
	
Here are some ways — some incredibly easy ways — how identity thieves 
locate and steal this identifying information:
	
✓	Going through discarded documents in trash, such as bills, credit card 
statements, and bank statements.
	
	And “the trash” doesn’t have to be what you take to the curb weekly. An 
Indianapolis TV investigative reporter helped bring national attention to 
pharmacies leaving lots of customers’ personal info in their dumpsters 
instead of destroying it as they should have.
	
✓	Sending phishing e-mails pretending to be banks or other institutions 
(including AOL and PayPal) requesting that the recipient click through 
and provide information.
	
✓	Changing the victim’s address so that billing and bank statements come 
to the identity thief.
	
✓	Skimming credit card information by using a special device in places 
where you scan or slide your card.
	
✓	Stealing your papers or wallet from your mailbox, car, briefcase/purse at 
work or other location.
	
✓	Lying to financial institutions and service providers to have them pro­
vide the thieves with your identifying information.
The cost of identity theft
According to the FTC (www.ftc.gov), in 2011 alone, identity theft cost 
Americans $1.52 billion and financial losses are just one aspect of the cost of 
identity theft. Victims also spend countless hours trying to recover losses, 
repair credit, and regain trust. This same FTC report indicates that identity 
theft victims spend up to 600 hours trying to restore their name and credit. 
Most victims don’t discover the identity theft until it has been occurring for 
months, allowing thieves time to do extensive damage.

61
 Chapter 3: Putting Safety First
According to the identity-monitoring service Identity Guard (www.identity
guard.com), the average debt incurred by a child identity theft victim 
is nearly $13,000, but the consequences of child identity theft extend far 
beyond initial monetary losses. Because many children don’t discover that 
their identity has been stolen until they try to apply for college financial aid 
or open their first credit card account, their entire lives may be delayed while 
they deal with the aftermath of restoring their identity and credit. In fact, 
Identity Guard reports that one child identity theft victim reported having to 
take an entire year off of college because of identity theft.
Recognizing the risk of child identity theft
Most adults probably don’t realize that children can also be victims of iden­
tity theft. According to Bloomberg Businessweek (www.businessweek.com), 
child identity theft has become the fastest growing type of identity theft. The 
FTC (www.ftc.gov) reports more than 50,000 known cases of child identity 
theft from 2010 to 2012. One study from AllClear ID (www.allclearid.com) 
estimates that as many as one in ten children in the United States are victims 
of identity theft.
Child identity theft often goes unnoticed because thieves use a child’s Social 
Security number to open bank accounts and purchase homes. Adult identity 
theft victims might discover damage to their credit score while applying for 
a home loan or opening a credit card, but children may not find out about a 
stolen identity until they are an adult and applying for a college loan or rent­
ing their first apartment. At that point, their information may have been used 
for years without their knowledge.
Identity thieves targeting children can get identifying information from hospi­
tal birth records, schools, and even doctor offices. Add to that children who 
are active online may also be putting themselves at risk. The following tips 
can help decrease the risk of your child’s identity being stolen from online 
activity:
	
✓	Remind your children to never share identifying information, such as 
their full birth date, online.
	
✓	Teach children to never share their Social Security number online.
	
✓	Teach your children to identify phishing e-mails and to not respond to 
or click through their links.

62
Part I: Living in the Digital Age 
	
✓	Teach your teens to look for https in URLs at sites when shopping 
online to ensure that they’re providing credit card information through 
a secure site.
	
✓	Ask your teens not to do any online banking or shopping on public com­
puters, via their phones, or when using a shared Wi-Fi connection.
	
✓	Consider subscribing to both computer and identity monitoring services.
	
✓	Install antivirus software on your computer, tablets, and smartphones.
	
✓	Remind your children to protect laptops and phones against theft or 
loss, especially when transporting such devices in a backpack or school 
tote. A laptop with private account information goes missing about 
every 50 seconds.
	
✓	Ask your children to use password protection on all devices and remind 
them to log out of sites and devices.
	
✓	Teach your children to not click sidebar and pop-up ads when they 
are online.
	
✓	Ask children to not create e-mails and profile names that include identi­
fying information such as birthdates, addresses, or Social Security 
numbers.
	
✓	Teach kids to come to you immediately if a site asks them to provide 
personal information.
	
✓	Remind children to never share passwords or store them in an easy-to-
find location.
	
✓	Teach children how to create strong passwords and avoid reusing pass­
words for multiple accounts.
	
✓	Ask teens to not store sensitive information on laptops or phones.
	
✓	Ask your children to not accept Friend requests from people they don’t 
know. Identity thieves use access to social media accounts to get pass­
word-protection answers, such as the victim’s mom’s maiden name or 
the victim’s pet’s name.
	
✓	Talk to your children about identity theft just like you talk to them about 
other risks.
	
Remind your children to never share your identifying information, either!
If any of the following events occur, consider checking to ensure that your 
child’s identity has not been stolen by identity thieves:
	
✓	Your child receives unsolicited credit card applications.
	
✓	Your child receives unsolicited loyalty reward program applications.

63
 Chapter 3: Putting Safety First
	
✓	Your child’s bank statements or credit card statements stop arriving.
	
✓	Your child applies for his first credit card and is turned down.
	
✓	Your child receives a credit card statement for an account that is 
not hers.
	
✓	Your child receives calls from a collection service.
	
✓	The IRS notifies you that a child you have listed as a dependent also 
appears on another tax return.
	
✓	Your child receives an IRS notification of overdue taxes, and your child 
has never had a job.

Displaying Online Etiquette
In This Chapter
▶	Understanding the importance of context
▶	Showing digital modesty
▶	Creating an appropriate profile
J

ust as adults follow different sets of etiquette guidelines at work and 
home, children speak differently with friends than with teachers. 
Similarly, online, appropriate tone and behavior varies from setting to set­
ting. It’s difficult enough for adults to navigate the tricky nuances of online 
etiquette, yet parents are responsible for helping their children do just that 
in a variety of online environments. By explaining the importance of context 
and tone to kids and setting some basic guidelines for online behavior, par­
ents can help children feel comfortable and empowered across a variety of 
online settings.
Proper online etiquette begins with creating appropriate online accounts. 
Once again, as the head of your digital family, your guidance is essential as 
you steer your children toward judiciously creating their online profiles.
Using Context to Define Tone
The key to understanding what tone should be used in online communica­
tion is first understanding the context of that situation. Twitter? E-mail? 
Facebook? Texting? Different platforms and situations require different 
styles of interaction. Just as in offline life, different people also expect differ­
ent styles of communication. These nuances may be difficult for tweens and 
teens to grasp, especially considering the rapid-fire digital communication to 
which they have become accustomed.
	
Google and some other free e-mail service providers require users to be at 
least 13 years of age to have an account.

66
Part I: Living in the Digital Age 
Understanding the (often informal) 
social media atmosphere
Social media platforms invite informal communication, often with message 
length limits and casual terminology, such as “Friending” and “following.” 
Read more about these and other aspects of social media in Part III. However, 
not all social media communication are equally relaxed. Certain social media 
sites invite more easygoing updates than others; the reason for site use will 
influence the tone and formality of communication.
Twitter
Twitter (see Chapter 12) is an informal platform that allows using only 140 
characters per message. This restriction encourages users to share often-
brusque snippets of information. (See Figure 4-1.) However, teens who tweet 
need to be reminded to keep their audience in mind when creating their 
Twitter status updates. Ask your tweeting teen to consider the following:
	
✓	Have you created a public account, which can be read by anyone? 
Chapter 12 guides you through selecting Twitter settings, including cre­
ating a private account.
	
✓	Are you followed by family members or just friends?
	
✓	Are you representing yourself only, or tweeting on behalf of others: say, 
a school club or an extracurricular group?
	
✓	Are you tweeting with companies or brands with customer service ques­
tions and feedback?
	
Twitter accounts that aren’t protected can be seen by anyone. Remind your 
teen of this before they use this very public platform.
	
Figure 4-1: 
Many 
tweets use 
a very 
informal 
style.
	

67
 Chapter 4: Displaying Online Etiquette
Facebook
Like Twitter, Facebook (see Chapter 12) also often follows a “stream of con­
sciousness” format with users posting status updates on a whim. To deter­
mine the right tone to use on their Facebook page, have your teens think 
about these questions:
	
✓	Are you friends with just peers or also family, coaches, and teachers?
	
✓	Do you have your own account, or are you posting to the family 
account?
	
✓	Do your privacy settings allow anyone to see your status updates, or are 
they hidden from anyone who is not your friend?
Despite the generally informal nature of social media, here are some general 
guidelines to ask your child to consider and that you may wish to discuss as 
part of your Digital Family Policy (see Chapter 2). Your teen may choose to 
ignore formal language constructs (such as spelling and punctuation), but 
they should avoid postings on all social media that contain
	
✓	Vulgarity
	
✓	Violence
	
✓	Sexual references
	
✓	Illegal activity
Your discussion with your teen about the difference between informal and 
inappropriate is the perfect time to remind him to assume that anything 
posted online is available to be seen by the public, including friends’ par­
ents, school staff, future employers, colleges, and law enforcement. Stress 
to them that it’s safer to skip a questionable photo on Instagram or post on 
Foursquare than regret it later.
This is also a good time to remind your teen that in certain online locations, 
informal social media tone should be replaced by a more respectful and 
formal manner. Such settings include
	
✓	Online study groups
	
✓	Class blog or social media page
	
✓	Family Facebook page
	
✓	Extracurricular activity group or page

Part I: Living in the Digital Age 
Demonstrating proper e-mail manners 
according to situation
It is perfectly acceptable for your teens to e-mail their friends using slang 
words and “text speak,” but that kind of informality is clearly not appropriate 
in e-mails to teachers, coaches, and prospective employers. The best way to 
teach your kids proper e-mail etiquette is to demonstrate it for them. Be sure 
to include your children’s e-mail address when appropriate when you com­
municate with coaches, tutors, and other adults in their lives. When you help 
your child get his first e-mail address, ask him to consider what might be dif­
ferent about his communications when e-mailing the following people:
	
✓	Friends
	
✓	Family
	
✓	Work
	
✓	After-school clubs
	
✓	Coaches
	
E-mail is just like sending a card or letter through the mail. Remind your 
children that they would write differently in a thank-you note to their grand­
mother than they would in a note passed to a friend in school. These same dif­
ferences apply to e-mail composition.
Different e-mail manners make sense according to situation, but here are 
some guidelines that apply, especially for the first e-mail your child writes 
to a new contact. Remind them that just as they would when writing a non-
electronic message, they should follow these guidelines:
	
✓	Include a subject line.
	
✓	Open with a greeting.
	
✓	Use standard spelling, capitalization, and punctuation.
	
✓	Write short paragraphs that are clear and to the point.
	
✓	End with a brief and appropriate closing.
	
✓	Be cordial but not joking.
	
✓	Use spellcheck before sending your e-mail.

Subject: Babysitting Opportunity
Mrs. Brown,
I am writing about your request for a neighborhood babysitter. I am in 
the 10th grade at the local high school and have been babysitting for two 
years. I am certified in child and infant CPR and can share references if 
you would like. You can contact me at 555-3131 or this e-mail address.
Thank you,
Jill
After a person responds to your child’s e-mail, continuing communication 
will likely be in shorter snippets with far less formality, but remind your kids 
that use of proper spelling, capitalization, and punctuation should continue.
	
This is a great time to remind kids that even though they are sending an e-mail 
to just one person, there is always a chance that the e-mail will not remain pri­
vate. Here’s a mantra you can share with them: If you don’t want it shared, don’t 
type it!
E-mail communication between friends will certainly be less formal in format 
and tone, but remind your kids that treating others appropriately applies 
across all situations, even e-mails. You may want to remind your kids that 
inappropriate e-mails, such as those used to cyberbully or send inappropri­
ate pictures, will not be tolerated. Include consequences for inappropriate 
e-mailing behavior in your Digital Family Policy.
Teaching the Golden Rule 
in a Digital World
Every child learns the Golden Rule: Treat others the way you would like to 
be treated. However, in a digital world, children (and adults, for that matter) 
often feel as though they can hide behind online anonymity. With online 
behavior affecting everything from friendships to future employment, it’s 
important to talk to your children about remembering their manners — 
especially online.

70
Part I: Living in the Digital Age 
	
Stress to your children to never say something to someone online they 
wouldn’t say to that person’s face.
Bragging versus sharing: teaching 
kids digital modesty
Modesty is one area frequently of concern in the digital world where every 
detail of our lives can be shared instantly. Kids naturally want to share their 
happiness and success with friends and family, and there is no reason why 
they shouldn’t. For example, kids may be quick to share a great report card, 
new job, or recent purchase. However, just as you would ask your child to 
share good news in person with modesty and not with the intent to brag, so 
should they share information online.
Ask your kids to consider the following in determining sharing versus 
bragging:
	
✓	How frequently are they updating their social media statuses?
	
✓	How often are they using social media status updates to share 
successes?
	
✓	What tone are they taking when sharing?
	
✓	How would they feel if their Friends’ accounts were updated as 
frequently and in the same way as theirs?
Show your teens the following examples of Facebook status updates and ask 
them to decide which status they would rather see from their Friends as well 
as their own account. (See Figure 4-2.)

 Chapter 4: Displaying Online Etiquette
Keeping friends’ secrets
Living in a digital world not only allows our kids to share their own informa­
tion and thoughts instantly and with many people, but it also makes it easy 
to quickly share whatever has been sent to them. Texts and e-mails can be 
forwarded, private chats cut and pasted, and screenshots saved and shared 
with anyone. While reminding kids to share cautiously because anything 
they share in writing through technology could be made public, also stress the 
importance of keeping friends’ secrets.
Keeping kindness in mind
Just as the ability to hide behind a screen causes many kids and teens to 
overshare, an online “cloak” can also make kids feel more comfortable 
saying mean or hurtful things to and about other people. The digital world 
has allowed playground gossip and bus ride bullying to move online and 
be shared instantly with an entire school rather than the handful of people 
within earshot. Remind kids that kindness counts online, and they should 
keep the following in mind:
	
✓	Stop and think before you type something mean and press Send.
	
✓	Don’t forward mean e-mails, texts, or messages that you’ve received.
	
✓	Consider how you would feel if someone said something mean about 
you and shared it online.
	
✓	Sometimes mean behavior online can be considered cyberbullying, and 
that can have very serious consequences. Chapter 10 covers cyberbully­
ing in depth.
Of course, your children will likely encounter kids and adults who don’t exer­
cise good online etiquette. In these moments, sure, it’s tough for kids to keep 
their cool and not respond in kind with meanness. Remind your kids, though, 
to stay calm and just “walk away” if possible to avoid engaging in inappropri­
ate behavior. At all times, kids should remember to report any behavior or 
interactions that might be dangerous or considered cyberbullying.
	
When your teen feels an interaction getting out of control, encourage them to 
take the conversation offline.

72
Part I: Living in the Digital Age 
Creating an Appropriate Online Persona
With a child’s digital footprint following teens as they seek jobs and entrance 
into college, they must think carefully about the online persona that they’re 
creating. Posting appropriate profile pictures and wholesome activities, while 
using nonsuggestive online names, will help create and maintain a positive 
digital persona for your child.
Choosing suitable profile pictures
Teens often upload a profile picture quickly and with little thought, snapping 
a quick photo with a webcam or a phone’s camera. A quick image search 
makes it clear, however, that the image your child chooses to associate 
online with their name can stick with them as part of their digital footprint.
	
While profile pictures are the most important because they are public, ask 
your teens to also think carefully before sharing any photos. Inappropriate 
pictures associated with their digital footprint may come back to haunt them!
Here are some important reasons why your kids select a suitable profile pic­
ture as they begin to explore all that the digital world has to offer:
	
✓	Digital footprint: As I mention throughout this book, the actions your 
child takes online — everything from product reviews on e-commerce 
sites to posts on Friends’ social media pages — follow them into their 
future, creating a legacy that can be searched by future employers and 
educational institutions. Ask your kids to consider who might find their 
profile image in a quick search — and if they feel comfortable about the 
image they’ve selected to share with the world.
	
✓	Safety: Just as the information shared by your child in chat rooms (as 
discussed in Chapter 7) and on social media sites can be used by online 
predators to gain the trust of your child, profile pictures may also catch 
the attention of online predators. Ask that your kids do not use images 
that contain the following:
 
• Sexually provocative images
 
• Identifying information, such as full name, address, or birthdate
 
• Illegal behavior

73
 Chapter 4: Displaying Online Etiquette
Selecting appropriate online handles
If your child is creating an account on a chat platform or online world that is 
frequented only by other friends their age, they may want to come up with 
a silly yet safe online name: a “handle.” However, remind them that when 
creating more public and widely used names — including e-mail addresses — 
that they should choose a name they feel comfortable sharing. As I discuss 
in Chapter 3, kids should carefully select their online names for many safety 
reasons. Beyond safety reasons, however, they should keep in mind that this 
screen name may follow them for years and across platforms. They should 
carefully select a name that is
	
✓	Easy to remember
	
✓	Free of identifying or private information (such as birth year or 
first name)
	
✓	Does not include their gender
	
✓	Safe to share with both friends and family
	
✓	Different from their e-mail address
	
✓	Free of vulgar or inappropriate words
	
A handle is likely to be used for a long period of time, across many platforms, 
and using a random group of letters and numbers is unwieldy.
Remind your kids that not only is their screen name likely the first piece of 
information that others will see about them, but it also acts as a protective 
layer between the public and your child’s private information. While it may 
make sense for your child to include their favorite activity or hobby as part 
of their screen name, this also provides strangers with personal information. 
The safest bet is to select a completely random screen name.
	
Ask your children to always use a screen name that’s different from their real 
name — as well as different from their passwords.
Keeping positive
Your children can use their online persona to create a positive digital foot­
print. Ask your teen to consider including the following information in their 
online biographies (see Figure 4-3) and profile information to give a positive 
first impression:

74
Part I: Living in the Digital Age 
	
✓	Favorite after-school activities and hobbies
	
✓	Notable accomplishments, academic and extra-curricular
	
✓	Volunteer interests

impression!

In This Chapter

D

uring the creation of your Digital Family Policy (see Chapter 2), you 
will likely set guidelines for how many screen hours each child in 
your family is allowed to have per day or week. The American Academy 
of Pediatrics (www.aap.org) recommends limiting the amount of hours 
because of several potential negative effects of too much screen time:
	
✓	Behavioral problems: Exposure to screen time more than 2 hours 
per day may cause children to experience attention and behavioral 
problems.
	
✓	Obesity: Children who experience more than 2 hours of screen time per 
day are at higher risk for developing obesity.
	
✓	Impaired academic performance: Excessive screen time, especially in 
children’s bedrooms or locations where they complete homework, may 
lead to impaired academic performance.
	
✓	Lack of play time: The more time children spend in front of a screen, 
the less time they have for other play, including physical activities.
To implement rules regarding screen time limits, you need a complete under­
standing of all the places where digitally connected kids are turning on and 
tuning in. Long gone are the days of screen time being confined to the family 
room television and the home computer. Now some kids are connected 
around the clock with smartphones, tablets, handheld gaming devices, and 
more. With the help of friends’ parents and the school community, you can 
gain a more complete understanding of your kids’ digital lives.

76
Part I: Living in the Digital Age 
Creating Rules for Usage 
in Friends’ Homes
All kids know which friend’s home is “the place to go” for everything from 
the snack food they aren’t allowed to eat at home to the movies they aren’t 
supposed to watch. In this digital age, that may often mean access to more 
screen time, different gaming devices, and other digital goodies that might be 
off-limits in their own homes. Communication is the key to finding out what 
your kids are consuming digitally when spending time in friends’ homes.
Collaborating with friends’ parents
Parents hosting children in their homes for play dates and after-school get-
togethers typically find out from the guest’s parents any specific likes or 
dislikes regarding food and activities as well as allergies or other rules to be 
aware of. Although you (understandably) can’t enforce your own standards 
inside someone else’s home, communicate with the other parents about what 
the children will be doing while together as well as about your family’s rules 
for your children’s screen time.
You may want to let your children’s friends’ parents know the following 
information:
	
✓	How much screen time you allow in one sitting
	
✓	What television, movie, and game ratings your children are permitted to 
watch or play
	
✓	What websites your children are allowed to visit
	
✓	Any devices that your children are not permitted to use
Likewise, be sure to find out from your children’s friends’ parents about any 
specific rules that they follow in their homes that you would like to respect 
when they are visiting.
	
Talk about your Digital Family Policy’s rules (see Chapter 2) when first chat­
ting with the parents of your children’s friends, just as you would discuss 
allergies and other family rules.

77
 Chapter 5: Knowing Where Kids Are Turning On and Tuning In
Asking the right questions
Although you will likely include a conversation about digital time in friends’ 
homes during the creation of your Digital Family Policy, the key to enforcing 
these guidelines is asking your kids the right questions. After your children 
are elementary school age, you will very rarely accompany them during time 
with friends, so having conversations with your children is the best way to 
determine how their time with friends is spent. Here are some questions to 
ask to conclude how much digital time your children spend with friends:
	
✓	What do you do when you go to “Johnny’s” house?
	
✓	Do you ever watch television there?
	
✓	What are your friend’s favorite shows?
	
✓	What video and computer games does your friend like to play?
	
✓	Do you ever play those games with him when you are there?
	
✓	Where is the computer in your friend’s home?
	
✓	Where are your friend’s parents when you are at his house?
When creating your Digital Family Policy, consider creating consequences for 
breaking digital policy rules when in someone else’s home.
Being Aware of Extensive 
In-School Usage
Most teachers include time in a computer lab in their weekly lesson plans, 
but what you may not realize is that many classrooms today also have com­
puters in the classroom and include computer time as part of daily lesson 
plans. A child who is allowed only 60 minutes of screen time per day may 
come home from school having already logged in 20 minutes of computer 
time. As parents, you may not even realize that one-third of your child’s 
screen time has already been accounted for prior to their usage at home.

Part I: Living in the Digital Age 
Talking to teachers about 
screen and Internet time
Any parent who has ever asked a child what they learned in school that day 
knows that sometimes it’s tough to get a straight answer from kids about 
what happens during their school day. To get a complete picture of how 
much screen time your child is accumulating during the course of the school 
day, you may need to enlist the help of your children’s teachers.
	
✓	Request a daily schedule. Most elementary school teachers have a 
standard plan that they follow each day, which may include classwork 
at dedicated learning stations. Many classrooms contain at least one stu­
dent computer used during station rotations for activities, such as math 
drills and reading lessons.
	
✓	Ask about computer lab time. Your child’s schedule of classes may also 
include time in a computer lab.
	
✓	Inquire about free time activities. As children complete their work or 
other activities, they are often permitted time to move around the room, 
locate a book to read, or begin a new activity. Some classrooms allow 
activities on the computer during this student free time as well as at the 
start and end of the day.
	
✓	Ask about television viewing time. You may not expect your child to 
watch television as part of their school day, but some teachers allow 
students to watch children’s television programming during extended 
down time, such as the dismissal process or study halls.
	
✓	Find out about device use throughout the school day. Each school has 
its own unique device usage policy (discussed later in this chapter), 
which may allow students to use devices (such as smartphones) during 
certain times, such as study halls and lunch. Schools may also use tech­
nology throughout the school day as part of instruction. See the follow­
ing section.
	
✓	Share your family rules with teachers. Acknowledging that classroom 
instruction practices and rules won’t likely alter because of your family 
digital usage policies, you can still share with your child’s teachers your 
family’s rules regarding device use and screen time. Your child’s teach­
ers may be able to guide your children to activities other than computer 
use during free time, for example, if they are aware of your family’s con­
cerns and guidelines.

79
 Chapter 5: Knowing Where Kids Are Turning On and Tuning In
Understanding school technology 
use policies
Younger children may have very little control over their exposure to screen 
time, but older students may be allowed to bring a variety of electronic 
devices to school with them. The amount of access that kids have to these 
devices throughout the day will vary by school. Request a copy of your 
school’s code of conduct, which should include the school’s technology use 
policies, and be sure to find answers to the following questions:
	
✓	What devices are students allowed to bring to school?
	
✓	Are students allowed to keep the devices with them during class time?
	
✓	Are students allowed to use the devices during class time?
	
✓	Are students allowed to use devices during nonclass time, such as in the 
hallways before and after school, during lunch, and during study halls?
	
✓	What are the consequences for device use during restricted times?
	
✓	If a restricted device has been confiscated from a student, how and 
when can the parents get the device back?
	
✓	What devices are typically used in education throughout the school day?
	
✓	How has the school restricted access to certain websites?
	
✓	What are the consequences for school-owned devices that are used for 
restricted behaviors?
	
✓	What is the school policy should a school-owned device be broken while 
in the care of a student?
I cover using technology in education in more depth in Chapter 18.
	
School technology policies often apply to the entire school district and are 
typically posted on your district’s website.
Finding and Tracking 
Hidden Digital Time
To accurately assess the amount of screen time your child is experiencing, 
you need to first find and then track hidden or unexpected screen time in 
your child’s day. In a variety of locations, children may experience unex­
pected screen time. The following are just a few of the locations where kids 
may be turning on and tuning in:

80
Part I: Living in the Digital Age 
	
✓	Health professionals’ offices: Not only do dentist office waiting rooms 
often have a television with movies or even video game consoles, but 
dentists often also show movies to kids during teeth cleanings and even 
exams. And children’s doctor’s offices often use television and movie 
time to keep both the waiting children and their parents occupied while 
they wait to be seen.
	
✓	Restaurants: Many restaurants display sporting events or news channels 
in waiting areas or over bars, which may be seen from other areas of the 
restaurant.
	
✓	Before or after care: Children who attend before care or after care as 
part of their school day may be shown movies or television as part of 
the regularly scheduled activities of that child care facility.
	
✓	Religious institutions: Use of digital media in curriculum extends 
beyond the daily school curriculum and into many religious institutions 
that may show videos as part of their weekly lessons.
	
✓	Airports and train stations: Much like doctor’s offices, airports and 
train stations often have televisions in their waiting areas.
	
✓	Cars: Many vehicles now come equipped with or offer screens that 
either drop down from the vehicle’s ceiling or are installed in the back of 
headrests.
	
✓	Hair salons: Like pediatric dentist offices using television time to calm 
nervous children, hair salons created for young clientele often put televi­
sions in their waiting rooms as well as at the cutting stations.
Most locations that provide children with access to computers or television 
do so in an attempt to make the children feel at ease during what otherwise 
could be an uncomfortable situation. With that said, if you are a parent who 
would like to limit your child’s screen time, you may not wish for them to 
take advantage of these opportunities. Before going somewhere such as the 
dentist or a restaurant where your child may be given the chance to watch a 
movie or show, or play a computer, decide the following:
	
✓	Will you allow your child to watch the provided digital entertainment?
	
✓	Will this digital time count toward your child’s screen time totals for the 
day or week?

81
 Chapter 5: Knowing Where Kids Are Turning On and Tuning In
If you decide to count this screen time toward the totals allowed in your 
Digital Family Policy, you may wish to offer your child the option to not par­
take of the television or movie viewing. In this case, provide the following:
	
✓	Other options for your child to pass the time such as reading a book, 
completing a puzzle workbook, or working on the evening’s homework 
assignment
	
✓	Alternative locations to sit such as away from televisions in a restaurant or 
in a section of a waiting room that does not have a clear view of monitors
	
✓	Music to listen to in order to distract from the screens around the room

F

rom game consoles to computer games to online game playing, most 
parents will encounter the world of gaming at some point in their chil­
dren’s lives. A 2011 study from NPD Group (www.npd.com) found that 91 
percent of kids between the ages of 2 and 17 play video games, up 13 percent 
from a 2009 report by the same firm. Even if you consider yourself a gamer, 
you need to understand the game platforms on which your child may be 
playing at home or at friends’ houses as well as new features you may not be 
familiar with, such as consoles you don’t have in your own home or recent 
downloaded updates.
In this chapter, I show you gaming system basics including the top game con­
soles: PlayStation, Xbox, and Wii. I also walk you through the world of social 
gaming, including Wi-Fi–enabled gaming, Facebook games, and PC gaming. 
Finally, with safety in mind, I cover game ratings and how to use these ratings 
to create the gaming section of your Digital Family Policy (as discussed in 
Chapter 2).
Understanding Gaming System Basics
Video game consoles require a television or other monitor for display rather 
than being standalone, like a handheld device (think Nintendo DSi). First 
developed in the early 1970s, game consoles have become a standard fixture 
in most digital families. Each console type uses (typically proprietary) game 
cartridges or discs and may have a variety of interactive features, such as 
Wi-Fi capability or the ability to detect motion with a sensor connected to the 
console.

86
Part II: Navigating the Digital World Kids Live In 
The primary game consoles on the market now are
	
✓	PlayStation: Sony (http://us.playstation.com)
	
✓	Xbox: Microsoft (www.xbox.com)
	
✓	Wii: Nintendo (www.nintendo.com/wii)
All three game systems allow users to engage in activities beyond playing 
game cartridges and discs. All three game systems have similar features, but 
each also has a variety of characteristics that makes it distinct. So, you need 
to understand the capabilities of each game system in your home so that you 
can adequately address each system function in your Digital Family Policy. 
For example, will your children be allowed to connect the game console to 
your home’s Wi-Fi? Will they be allowed to download additional game compo­
nents or play only game discs that you’ve purchased (or borrowed 
or rented)?
PlayStation
PlayStation 3 (PS3) is the latest version of Sony’s PlayStation game system. 
Like most game consoles, PS3 capabilities extend beyond game disc play. 
However, the PS3 is the only game console with a built-in Blu-ray player. 
PS3 also gives families the capability to play many of the gaming industry’s 
top games.
PS3 capabilities beyond game disc play include
	
✓	Blu-ray disc viewing
	
✓	Access to game add-ons via the Wi-Fi–enabled PlayStation Store
	
✓	Capability to stream 3-D and HD movies and shows through such ser­
vices as Netflix, Hulu Plus, CinemaNow, and VUDU
	
✓	Capacity to watch sports through optional services, such as NHL 
GameCenter Live, NFL Sunday Ticket, and MLB.TV
	
✓	Access to Music Unlimited (a music-streaming service)
	
✓	DVD viewing
	
✓	Digital photo viewing and storage
	
✓	Internet access
	
✓	Digital music listening and storage
	
✓	Audio CD playback

87
 Chapter 6: Decoding Gaming
	
Some PS3 features require a subscription or membership at an additional cost.

questions, visit http://playstation.custhelp.com.
Xbox 360
Xbox 360 is the most recent video game console from Xbox creator 
Microsoft. Through the built-in Wi-Fi, Xbox 360 owners may also use their 
console to do the following:
	
✓	View HD movies and stream television through such services as Amazon 
Instant Video, Crackle, EPIX, ESPN, GameSpot TV, Hulu Plus, Netflix, 
Syfy, TMZ, Verizon FiOS, and Zune Video.
	
✓	Listen to music via iHeartRadio, Last.fm, YouTube, and Zune Music Pass.
	
✓	Browse the Internet through Internet Explorer.
	
✓	Download additional games and game features.
Xbox 360 consoles also allow you to
	
✓	Listen to audio CDs.
	
✓	Store and listen to digital music.
	
✓	View DVDs.
	
✓	View and store digital photos.
For an additional cost, Xbox 360 owners may purchase the Kinect — a 
motion-sensing input device — which operates without controllers and 
instead uses a sensor to recognize your movements. Through the Kinect 
sensor, users can play game discs created for use with the Kinect and enjoy 
voice-controlled entertainment.
Xbox users may connect with game console support at http://support.
xbox.com.
Wii
Like the Xbox Kinect, the Wii game console from Nintendo is motion-
controlled, but unlike the Kinect, the Wii sensor requires Wii remotes. As one 
of the top game consoles, Wii offers some of the most popular games available.

88
Part II: Navigating the Digital World Kids Live In 
Beyond game play, the Wii provides owners with the ability to
	
✓	View movies and television through such services as Netflix and 
Hulu Plus.
	
✓	Listen to audio CDs.
	
✓	View and store digital photos.
	
✓	View DVDs.
	
✓	Download classic Nintendo games and game add-ons.
	
✓	Access weather reports through the Forecast Channel.
	
✓	Browse the Internet through the Internet Channel.
	
✓	Read the latest news via the News Channel.
Wii owners may find answers to technical support questions at www.

Wii U
The latest version of the Wii game system, Wii U (released in late 2012; see 
Figure 6-1) incorporates a Wii U GamePad controller that includes a front-
facing camera, microphone, stereo speakers, motion control, a second video 
screen, and more. A GamePad allows players to view their gaming experience 
from multiple viewpoints simultaneously: one perspective appearing on the 
GamePad and the other appearing on the television screen.
Wii U also features Nintendo TVii, with which users can find, watch, and 
engage with TV shows, movies, and sports programming. You can use the 
GamePad to connect to other services, such as cable and satellite or video 
on-demand subscriptions.
Most games created for the Wii game console also work on Wii U.
PC gaming
Just like video game consoles, many video games are available for personal 
computers. In fact, many of the most popular game console games are also 
available for your home computer. Some games, such as massively multi­
player online games (MMOGs), are more often available for PCs than for 
video game consoles.

Most games are playable on your PC without requiring additional add-on pur­
chases, such as special keyboards, steering wheels, and joysticks. What you 
should check before purchasing a PC game, however, is that your PC meets 
the system requirements, especially memory requirements.
PC games can come on discs, much like the games you purchase for your 
video game console, or are downloadable via the Internet.
Introducing Social Gaming
With Wi-Fi–enabled game consoles, game applications available through 
social media platforms, and games available for play directly from your 
Internet browser, “social gaming” no longer refers to two friends playing a 
video game together in your family room. Instead, your kids now play with 
other kids or adults around the world, raising a variety of safety and privacy 
questions. When creating the gaming section of your family’s Digital Family 
Policy, include specific questions relating to the social gaming opportunities 
that follow.
Wi-Fi–enabled PC and console gaming
PS3, Xbox 360, and Wii all allow players to interact virtually with other con­
sole owners around the world through your home’s Wi-Fi connection.

90
Part II: Navigating the Digital World Kids Live In 
The PlayStation Network allows users to play online, multiplayer games free. 
This network includes PlayStation Home, a social game platform that con­
nects you to millions of other users through hundreds of games. Important to 
note, this service includes the ability to participate in both voice and video 
chat with other PlayStation Home account holders. Much like a standard 
social media platform, you can build a Friend list and send messages via your 
PS3 game console.
Similar to the PlayStation Network, Xbox 360 also allows users to play with 
other console owners through the Microsoft Wi-Fi–enabled social gaming 
platform, Xbox LIVE. Users can use their Xbox LIVE account to post to their 
Facebook account, including alerting Facebook Friends that they would like 
to play a multiplayer Xbox 360 game with them. You can also update your 
Facebook and Twitter statuses through Xbox LIVE and participate in video 
chats using Kinect.
Some Wii games can be played online with multiple people through the Wii’s 
online features. These Wi-Fi Connection games are designed to allow the user 
to play with anyone around the world. And you can use a special Friend Code 
(a type of parental control) to allow only people you know to participate in 
the online game play.
Wii U features an online gaming community — Miiverse — through which 
users may interact with other Wii U users: playing games, chatting, and post­
ing messages. You can also use Wii U’s GamePad controller to video chat in 
real time with other Wii U users.
PC gaming allows for many online gaming opportunities both via pur­
chased games and free, online-only games. Multiplayer games, MMOGs, 
and MMORPGs (Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games) are very 
popular in the PC game realm, allowing players to interact with other players 
around the world. Many games allow players to use webcams, microphones, 
and headsets to interact vocally and visually with other players.
Because their capabilities vary from platform to platform, set rules accord­
ing to each game console when discussing Wi-Fi–enabled gaming during the 
creation of your Digital Family Policy. Be specific about features that may 
include a variety of levels of use, such as chat with or without video, or 
online play with anyone or just friends. Also include specific rules regarding 
pay-to-play options your child will encounter during Wi-Fi–enabled console 
gaming, such as the ability to download online-only games or console game 
add-ons.
Many families allow their children computer time for homework and other 
school-related tasks, so set clear rules in your Digital Family Policy regard­
ing accepted uses of the computer at specific times. For example, are your 

91
 Chapter 6: Decoding Gaming
children allowed to play PC games after completing their homework? Are 
PC games allowed only on the weekend? Also note whether children have 
permission to purchase and download PC games online as part of their PC 
gaming time.
Facebook games
More than one-half of Facebook’s one billion account holders report playing 
Facebook games. As I discuss in Chapter 12, these game applications require 
access to your Facebook account — and thus might be a privacy concern. 
Include an area in your Digital Family Policy to address Facebook games; 
specifically, rules about participating in games, gaming with other Facebook 
users, and paying for in-game features that require a fee for access.
Types of Facebook games
The enormous variety of Facebook games and game types can make creating 
specific Facebook gaming rules very difficult for parents. Some of the most 
popular categories of Facebook games are
	
✓	Board games: Think checkers, chess, and Mahjong.
	
✓	Sports games: From fishing to baseball and football, sports games can 
be played solo or with a Facebook Friend.
	
✓	Arcade-style games: Arcade-style games are reminiscent of shooting 
games and original arcade video games.
	
✓	Puzzle games: Games focusing on strategy, logic, and quick reflexes fall 
into this category.
	
✓	Role-playing games: Role-playing games (RPGs) allow the player to take 
on the role of a character to complete tasks and journeys during the 
course of the game.
	
✓	Betting games: These games allow users to “bet” on games, such as 
bingo, poker, slots, and sports.
Paying to play Facebook games
Playing games on Facebook is free. However, some Facebook games have 
within-game options that require payment for access. For example, many 
games — including some role-playing games and betting games — allow 
users to pay money for the chance to win virtual rewards. Some games also 
require a fee to add features or tools to your game experience. For example, 
in the popular Facebook game Farmville, you can purchase items (such as 
virtual tractors) that help in game play. Be sure that your Digital Family 
Policy includes specific rules regarding paying for these game features.

92
Part II: Navigating the Digital World Kids Live In 
In the United States, you can’t currently bet with and win actual money on 
Facebook. However, Facebook users in the UK can gamble through adults-
only, highly regulated betting game apps.
Protecting your account’s privacy
Participating in Facebook game play requires allowing game applications to 
access information in your Facebook profile. You might also have to set a list 
of permissions for that game application, such as posting in your Friends’ 
News Feeds on your behalf. For many parents, this is a privacy concern. You 
can, however, restrict the permissions you grant a Facebook game applica­
tion while still being able to play that game.
When you choose to play a game, a permissions screen appears (see 
Figure 6-2), telling you the various permissions that particular game is 
requesting: for example, your e-mail address or your location. 
	
Figure 6-2:

You may edit specific game permissions after the game has been installed. To 
do this, follow these steps:
	
1.	Go to www.facebook.com and sign in to your account.
	
2.	From the drop-down menu in the upper-right corner, choose Privacy 
Settings.
	
3.	Click the Edit Settings link to the right of the Ads, Apps and Websites 
section. (See Figure 6-3.)
	
4.	Click the Edit Settings button to the right of the Apps You Use section 
(see Figure 6-4).
	
5.	Click Edit next to each game application to change what that game 
application may do through your account.

Even if you choose to not allow your children to participate in Facebook 
gaming, their accounts might still be accessed by Facebook game applications 
due to their Friends’ activity.

94
Part II: Navigating the Digital World Kids Live In 
To control which applications may access your account through your 
Friends, follow Steps 1–3 of the preceding list, click the Edit Settings button 
for the How People Bring Your Info to Apps They Use section (refer to 
Figure 6-4), and select what information you choose to share with apps 
being used by your Facebook Friends. (See Figure 6-5.)
	
Figure 6-5: 
Edit how

Even though changing these settings will control what information from 
your accounts can be provided to game applications used by your teen’s 
Friends, she may still receive Facebook game invitations from her Friends on 
Facebook. Your teen can block all game invitations from Friends, though.
The first option is to block game application invites from specific Friends by 
doing the following from the Privacy Settings menu (see the preceding steps):
	
1.	Click the Manage Blocking link next to the Blocked People and Apps 
section (refer to Figure 6-3).
	
2.	In the Block Invites From field, type the name of the Friend whose 
invitations you would like to block (see Figure 6-6).
The second option is to block specific game applications from contacting 
you or receiving nonpublic information about you from Facebook. From the 
Blocked People and Apps section (see the preceding steps), find the Block 
Apps field, and type the name of the application whose contact and access to 
your nonpublic information you would like to block (refer to Figure 6-6).
If you would like to allow your children or family to have a Facebook account, 
but you don’t want that account to have access to Facebook games and 
applications, you may choose to permanently opt-out of the Facebook apps 
platform. Disabling Facebook game applications makes that Facebook profile 
completely inaccessible to all apps, including games.

Figure 6-3).
	
2.	In the Apps You Use field, click the Turn Off link next to the red X 
(refer to Figure 6-4).
	
3.	In the Turn Off Apps, Plugins and Websites pop-up that appears, 
shown in Figure 6-7, click the Turn Off Platform button.
	
Figure 6-7:

After you turn this platform off on any account (you or your child), you won’t 
be able to use the Facebook integrations on third-party apps or websites. 
And, the following will also occur:

96
Part II: Navigating the Digital World Kids Live In 
	
✓	You won’t be able to log into websites or applications via Facebook.
	
✓	Your Facebook Friends can no longer interact and share with you using 
apps and other websites.
	
✓	Instant personalization is turned off for your account.
Protecting the privacy of your Friends
Protection is a two-way street. After you add a game application to your 
Facebook page, it may be able to access the public information of your 
Facebook Friends. To edit the application’s access to your Friends’ informa­
tion, take the following steps:
	
1.	Click the Edit Settings button of the Ads, Apps and Websites section 
(refer to Figure 6-3).
	
2.	Click the Edit Settings button next to the Apps You Use section (refer 
to Figure 6-4).
	
3.	Click Edit next to the name of the game application you’d like to edit.
	
4.	Click the X to the right of Access Your Friends’ Contact Information 
(see Figure 6-8).
Following these steps for each game application with access to your account 
will restrict that game application’s access to your Friends’ Facebook 
accounts.

Understanding Game Ratings
The primary game rating system in the United States and Canada is the 
Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB), which is a nonprofit, self-reg­
ulatory body that assigns content ratings for video games and mobile apps 
based on age and content ratings. Founded in 1994 by the Entertainment 
Software Association, the ESRB (www.esrb.org; shown in Figure 6-9) works 
to empower parents to make informed decisions about the video games they 
purchase for their children and allow to be played in their homes. The ESRB 
doesn’t aim to prohibit certain games from being purchased and played, but 
rather hopes to provide concise and impartial information to parents and 
other consumers.
The three-part ESRB rating system includes
	
✓	ESRB rating: An assigned rating category that suggests the age-appropri­
ateness of that particular game
	
✓	Content descriptors: Inform parents why the rating category was 
selected for that particular game
	
	These descriptors also inform the consumer what content included in 
the game may be of interest or of concern.
	
✓	Interactive elements: Cover interactive features of the game, including 
capabilities, such as location sharing 
	
Figure 6-9: 
ESRB home 
page.
	

98
Part II: Navigating the Digital World Kids Live In 
	
Content descriptors do not list every type of content found in the video game. 
The absence of a content descriptor does not guarantee the absence of that 
content within the game.
	
Games are not required to have an ESRB rating, but many stores that sell video 
games will sell only those games that do contain an ESRB rating. Game console 
manufacturers also require games for their systems to include an ESRB rating.
	
The ESRB rating symbols rate only the content created by the game publisher — 
not online interactions or content created by individuals.
When assigning a rating, ESRB raters look at any content that reflects both 
the most extreme content in the video game and the overall frequency of this 
extreme content. Raters also consider factors such as the degree of player 
control and any other unique elements to the games, which are inherently 
interactive.
Seven ESRB rating symbols suggest the age appropriateness of video games. 
The categories are
	
	
✓	Early childhood (EC): Video games receiving this rating are suggested 
to be suitable for children ages three and older. This rating indicates 
that the game does not contain material that parents find inappropriate 
for children.
	
	
✓	Everyone (E): Games content may be suitable for everyone ages 6 and 
older. The games may contain minimal cartoon, fantasy, or mild vio­
lence, and/or infrequent use of mild language.
	
	
✓	Everyone 10+ (E10+): These games have more cartoon, fantasy, or mild 
violence, mild language, and/or minimal suggestive themes than those 
with an E rating. Games in this category are recommended to be suitable 
for ages 10 and older.
	
	
✓	Teen (T): These games have content that may be suitable for ages 13 
years and older. They may contain violence, suggestive themes, crude 
humor, minimal blood, simulated gambling, and/or infrequent use of 
strong language.
	
	
✓	Mature (M): The game may contain intense violence, blood and gore, 
sexual content, and/or strong language. These games may be suitable 
for those age 17 years or older.
	
	
✓	Adults Only (AO): The game has content suitable only for those age 18 
years or older. Games receiving this rating may include prolonged 	
	
scenes of intense violence and/or graphic sexual content and nudity.

99
 Chapter 6: Decoding Gaming
Each ESRB rating symbol is easily recognizable. Locate ESRB ratings by look­
ing on either the front or the back of nearly any video game. Be sure to show 
your children which symbol corresponds with each rating.
	
	 Video game manufacturers may use a Rating Pending (RP) symbol to adver­
tise a game prior to receiving an ESRB rating for that game. Games shown 
(in an ad or online video) with the RP symbol may not yet appear for sale 
in stores.
Searching for game ratings
For information on a rated game, you can search ESRB rating summaries for 
nearly all video games rated by the ESRB since July 1, 2008. This supplemen­
tary information provides a content description highlighting the types of 
content characteristics that parents look for when selecting or approving a 
video game for their children. To locate these ESRB rating summaries, simply 
search by video game title on the homepage at www.esrb.org (refer to 
Figure 6-9).
When searching for a game title, you can search by game platform, too, 
because some games are available for multiple devices. The game platform 
choices available are
	
✓	All Platforms
	
✓	Mobile App/Tablet
	
✓	Nintendo DS/DSi/3DS
	
✓	PlayStation 3
	
✓	PlayStation Vita/PSP
	
✓	Wii/Wii U
	
✓	Windows/Mac
	
✓	Xbox 360
	
✓	Other
When searching for a game rating, use the advanced search option to filter 
your search by rating category and by content. Filtering content choices 
allows you to include or exclude the following content types:

✓	Violence
	
✓	Blood/gore
	
✓	Sexuality
	
✓	Nudity
	
✓	Language
	
✓	Substances
	
✓	Gambling
	
✓	Humor
After you search for a specific game, you see a rating chart (see Figure 6-10) 
that includes the following information:
	
✓	Title
	
✓	Platforms
	
✓	Rating
	
✓	Content descriptors

Discussing the ESRB in your 
Digital Family Policy
Nearly every game available for purchase at major retailers in the United 
States and Canada will include an ESRB rating. For parents, this is an invalu­
able tool to not only inform their decisions about the games played in their 
homes, but also to include in the Digital Family Policy. When creating the 
video game section of your Digital Family Policy, establish which game rat­
ings are allowed for each member of the family or age range. Just as you 
may not allow your elementary school child to watch every PG movie that is 
released but rather make decisions on a case by case basis, you may want to 
include the option of evaluating games based on content descriptions if they 
fall within a certain rating category.
When creating your Digital Family Policy, go over each game rating (http://
www.esrb.org/ratings) with your family so that all family members 
understand the symbols used to rate video games. These ratings are easily 
found on games, and children will be accustomed to seeing them. Discussing 
the full description of each game rating will help your children understand 
the details of each rating category. Visit the ESRB Family Discussion Guide 
for tips on how to chat with your family about game ratings:
www.esrb.org/about/familyguide.jsp

102
Part II: Navigating the Digital World Kids Live In 
You may also wish to discuss with your children how the ESRB assigns each 
game a rating. Explaining to your kids that the ratings are the result of a care­
ful process and are assigned by experts may make it easier for them to trust 
the ratings and follow the ratings rules in your Digital Family Policy. In fact, 
each ESRB rating is the result of the work and recommendations of at least 
three specially trained experts who come together to agree on the rating for 
the game. Rating video games is their full-time job, and to avoid outside influ­
ence, they don’t have ties to the video game industry.
Placing the ESRB at your fingertips
ESRB rating summaries are available through mobile devices for parents 
interested in learning more information about a game’s rating while visiting a 
video game retailer. To access the ESRB rating summaries, download the free 
ESRB Rating Search App for iPhone, Android, and Windows Phone. This app 
is available by searching ESRB in your phone’s app store or marketplace. Use 
the ESRB Rating Search App to search by game title by saying the game title, 
taking a photo of the game box, or entering the game title into the search 
field (see Figure 6-12).
	
Figure 6-12: 
The ESRB 
Rating 
Search 
application.
	
You can also access the rating summaries on your mobile device through the 
mobile website at www.m.esrb.org. The ESRB mobile site allows you to
	
✓	Search games by title.
	
✓	Search games by platform.
	
✓	Access the ratings guide.

103
 Chapter 6: Decoding Gaming
	
✓	Read the FAQ.
	
✓	Contact the ESRB.
	
The ESRB can’t enforce its ratings nor require age identification at the time 
of purchase, but many retailers have store policies that require age verifica­
tion for purchase of sale or rental of games rated M (Mature) and AO (Adults 
Only). You may wish to include rules about game acquisition within your 
Digital Family Policy to safeguard against the purchase or rental of games with 
ratings that you deem inappropriate for your family.
Understanding Parental Controls
All major game consoles come with parental controls, accessed via pass­
word, to manage everything from online purchases through Wi-Fi to the 
game ratings that may be played on that console. Each console allows you 
to create general parental controls for the entire family as well as individual 
accounts per child with different settings.
Wii
Using your Wii Remote and the A button selector, do the following:
	
1.	Turn on the console and go to the Wii Menu.
	
2.	Select Wii Options and then Wii Settings.
	
3.	Click the blue arrow to the right to gain access to the Wii System 
Settings 2 menu choices.
	
4.	Select Parental Controls and then choose Yes (see Figure 6-13).

W

ith social media infiltrating nearly every aspect of the Internet, many 
online places our children visit — everything from finding informa­
tion to playing age-appropriate games — also contain the option to interact 
with other users. While many of us parents got caught up with our friends 
after school by talking on the phone, today’s digital kids are just as likely 
to meet up in a chat room to discuss the events of the day. Your job is to 
empower children to make wise decisions about social interaction through 
chat functions, including rules about online interaction in your Digital Family 
Policy, which I show you how to create in Chapter 2.
For the purposes of this book, I will primarily cover IM and chat rooms, but I 
will also touch on safety guidelines and Digital Family Policy rules that apply 
to message boards and forums as well.
Anticipating Chat Requests
Internet users can have conversations with other site members in a variety 
of ways:
	
✓	Message boards and forums: Unlike chat rooms and instant messaging 
(IM), message boards and forums (see Figure 7-1) are ongoing, but not 
live, conversations around a specific topic or question. Users may post 
a question or comment and not receive a response for hours, days, or 

108
Part II: Navigating the Digital World Kids Live In 
even weeks. Typically, message boards are moderated, and posts to 
the board may be placed in moderation before appearing as part of the 
ongoing conversation. Messages that are inappropriate are typically 
removed quickly or simply not approved for posting.
	
✓	Chat rooms: Some chat rooms, especially those that are available during 
only certain hours of the day (rather than around the clock) are also 
monitored like most message boards. Unlike message boards, though, 
chat room posts appear in real time, and conversations occur live. Chat 
rooms created specifically for teens and children by trusted sites and 
brands are more likely to be moderated and monitored than member-
created rooms or those open to all ages.
	
	There is no way to verify that the people using chat rooms specifically 
for kids are actually children.
	
	An example of a teen chat room is shown in Figure 7-2.
	
✓	IM and private chat: IM and private chat between one user and another 
are live conversations that occur privately between two or more people. 
Many sites and platforms, such as those listed here, have a chat or IM 
function.
 
• Online games
 
• Virtual worlds
 
• Children’s social media sites, such as those covered in Chapters 11 
and 21
 
• Facebook
 
• Gmail
 
• Wi-Fi–enabled game consoles

Part II: Navigating the Digital World Kids Live In 
	
Not all chat rooms for kids are moderated, so be sure to approve a chat room 
before your children use it.
	
Even if your child is not initiating chats, you should prepare kids to anticipate 
chat requests if they are going to sites that contain an interactive function. 
Not all sites contain chat functions that work in the same way, and chat 
requests may be coming from a variety of sources.
Chat requests from other users
One type of chat request is from other users on the same site. These chat 
requests are often unsolicited and may be unexpected. Typically, the other 
users will need to request permission to interact with your child by asking 
to be added to a buddy or Friend list. Prepare your children to expect these 
types of requests and include answers to the following questions in your 
Digital Family Policy:
	
✓	What should your child do if he receives a Friend or buddy request from 
someone he doesn’t know?
	
✓	Does your child need to receive parental approval before adding some­
one to a friend or buddy list?
	
✓	Does your child need to give parents access to the list of people with 
whom they chat?
	
Not everyone online is who they say they are! Remind your children that they 
may receive chat requests from adults pretending to be children.
Chat requests from site administrators
A second kind of chat request is from site administrators or group modera­
tors. Some children’s sites use characters within the online world to com­
municate with the children using that site. The purpose may be to guide new 
users through the site, suggest an activity to an inactive user, or introduce 
new site functionality. Figure 7-4 shows an example of a Bearville.com admin­
istrator engaging a child user as she enters the online world to begin playing.
Site administrators may also initiate a chat as a customer service function to 
see whether the user has any questions or needs help using the site. Prepare 
your children to receive these sorts of messages, and be sure to discuss how 
you would like your child to respond to such chat requests.

istrator to

Understanding Chat Options
After you make your child aware of potential requests to participate in chat­
ting and IM, discuss with her the various options for how to respond to such 
chat requests. Most chat rooms and IM services are completely unsuper­
vised, so empower your children with the tools they need to stay safe while 
enjoying all that technology has to offer.
Declining chat requests
If your child is using a site with chat functionality, he will likely receive chat 
requests from other users. Remind your children that they have the right to 
decline a chat request without needing to respond to the person making the 
request. Ask your children to come to you if they receive a request to chat 
and aren’t sure how to decline a request on that particular platform. Most 
platforms allow users to simply click an X to hide the message, or click the 
Decline button to keep one user from contacting another. (See Figure 7-5.)

Part II: Navigating the Digital World Kids Live In 
Using prepopulated responses
Some popular social media and online world sites for children allow users 
to use pre-approved phrases to communicate with other users rather than 
allowing children to type anything they like in chat rooms. These prepopu­
lated chat functions prohibit children from saying inappropriate things to 
one another, including sharing private information that may put them at risk. 
Some online worlds and children’s social media platforms allow only this 
type of chatting, and others offer it as a setting to parents who are setting up 
their children’s accounts.
If your children would like to visit a site that allows users to chat with one 
another with pre-populated or limited chat, consider the following:
	
✓	Create a parent account. Many sites for children allow parents to make 
a parent account, which typically has access to the child’s account. This 
allows parents to modify settings in the child’s account, track the child’s 
behavior on the site, and even limit playing time. See Figure 7-6 for an 
example. In Chapter 21, I talk about parent accounts on specific social 
media sites for children.
	
Figure 7-6:

a parent 
account on 
the popular 
children’s 
site, Club 
Penguin.
	

113
 Chapter 7: Preparing Kids for Online Chats
	
✓	Select the chat settings of your child’s account. Most children’s social 
media sites that allow children to chat with other users also allow 
parents to select the chat settings. Club Penguin, for example, allows 
the options of Standard Safe Chat (filtering the child’s messages) and 
Ultimate Safe Chat (only allowing users to select from a pre-determined 
set of messages and responses). See Figure 7-7.
	
✓	Create chat rules. If you decide to allow your children to use pre­
populated chat options on the websites they use, include rules in your 
Digital Family Policy about online chats. Include rules about whom your 
child may chat with while online and what to do when unwanted chat 
requests appear from another user.
	
Prepopulated chat programs are a great way to introduce your tweens to the 
world of chatting online while still controlling the content that they’re sharing.
Creating a chat platform profile
As I discuss in Chapter 4, make sure that your children and teens create 
online profiles that don’t put them in harm’s way. When your children select 
a user name and create a user profile for a chat platform profile, insist that 
they consider the following:
	
Figure 7-7: 
Pre- 
populated 
message 
options 
on Club 
Penguin.
	

114
Part II: Navigating the Digital World Kids Live In 
	
✓	Do not create a user name that’s sexual or suggestive in any way.
	
✓	Do not include information in the user name that identifies who you are 
offline, such as your real name.
	
✓	Do not include personal information in the user name, such as e-mail 
address, birth year, or Social Security number.
	
✓	Do not upload a profile photo that’s sexual or suggestive in any way.
	
✓	Do not upload a profile photo that includes identifying information, such 
as a name on a jersey, your school name, or a house number or street 
name in the background.
Selecting privacy settings
Many sites and programs that include a chat function also provide users 
and parents with the ability to select from a variety of privacy settings. For 
example, PS3 owners may use the PlayStation Network to restrict chat usage 
on all sub-accounts via a parent or guardian master account. Another popu­
lar online communication service, Skype, allows users to control who can 
contact them, including who is able to do the following:
	
✓	Send an IM
	
✓	Call a user
	
✓	Send a video
	
✓	See a user’s online status
	
If you don’t want your child to be contacted by unauthorized users, but you 
can’t disable chat function entirely — or don’t wish to — search the privacy 
settings of the platform for options to simply hide your child’s account from 
users who are not Friends or approved contacts.
Blocking chat functionality
Some platforms allow users to turn the chat or IM feature off completely. 
This prevents other users from contacting your child to request a friendship 
or begin a chat. Of course, this also prevents your child from initiating chats 
with other users. If you would like your child to use websites with chat func­
tions but not receive chat requests, look for settings regarding these features 
when creating the account, such as the settings on Build-A-Bear’s Bearville 
shown in Figure 7-8.

115
 Chapter 7: Preparing Kids for Online Chats
	
Figure 7-8:

chat func-
tions at 
Bearville.
com.
	
	
Sometimes changing settings on a child’s account must be approved first by 
a parent, including any attempts to change the settings back to their original 
status.
Participating in open chat
Another option for kids using platforms that include chat and IM functions is 
to engage in open chats with no restriction. This is the type of online chatting 
that you are likely most familiar with: the format for sites aimed at adults.
	
These chats are typically not moderated and likely contain no filters for lan­
guage and appropriateness. Depending on the age of your children, you may 
include rules about open chatting in your Digital Family Policy.
Making chat requests
During the discussion of your family’s rules regarding IM and chat, cover 
what your family’s expectations are regarding chat requests. Many kids use 
IM and chat platforms to communicate with their friends, but be sure to have 
specific rules about initiating conversations with people your children do not 
know in real life. Remind them that even if their friends chat with this person 
as well, a stranger is still a stranger. You may wish to cover this topic during 
the discussion of Friend and buddy list rules in the creation of your Digital 
Family Policy.

116
Part II: Navigating the Digital World Kids Live In 
Comprehending Potential 
Chat Room Dangers
I discuss safety concerns in depth in Chapter 3, but pay close attention to 
the risks specifically associated with participating in chat rooms, message 
boards, and private chats. Consider the following, and discuss these poten­
tial issues with your kids:
	
✓	Sharing information: Even after you talk with your children at length 
regarding the sharing of personal information online, conversations in 
chat rooms can quickly become familiar, and kids may be tempted to 
share personal information with online “friends.”
	
✓	Others sharing your information: As I mention in Chapter 3, kids may 
share information, believing it is just being seen by one person, but 
then have that information shared with others or even posted publicly. 
Remind your kids that anything they type via chat may be shared.
	
✓	Cyberbullying: The assumed anonymity of Internet users often gives 
people an excuse and a venue to say things that they would not say oth­
erwise, including hurtful and mean statements. Kids can be bullied by 
people they know and also strangers, who can use information shared in 
chat rooms to bully kids. For more on cyberbullying, read Chapter 10.
	
✓	Online predators: Chat rooms and message boards are one of the top 
places where online predators seek child victims. They use the per­
sonal information provided by kids and watch their online discussions 
in order to introduce conversation and engage with them, playing the 
role of a sympathetic listener or pretending to relate to kids. Read more 
about online predators in Chapter 3.
	
✓	In-person meetings: Online Friends commonly discuss meeting in 
person. Kids need to be reminded that they don’t really know the 
people they are talking to online — and should never agree to meet 
them in person.
Establishing Rules for Chat and IM
If your family decides that your children may participate in online chats and 
IM, set guidelines for the use of these platforms and include these guidelines 
in your Digital Family Policy. Here are some thoughts to guide the creation of 
chat rules:

117
 Chapter 7: Preparing Kids for Online Chats
	
✓	Strangers are strangers. Remind your children that people in chat 
rooms are always strangers, even if they have chatted with that person 
for a long time. There is no way for your children to know whether 
the person they are talking to is who they say they are. Your children 
should always consider them strangers and apply the rules they would 
normally follow for interaction with people they don’t know.
	
✓	Don’t share personal information. Require that your children never 
share personal or identifying information in public chats or with people 
they only know online including name, address, name of school, phone 
number, and location.
	
✓	Never meet an online acquaintance. Tell your children that it’s never 
okay to meet someone in person with whom they chat online.
	
✓	Practice good online manners. Ask that your children follow the same 
rules for interaction that they follow with people in person including 
manners and courteous behavior. For more about online etiquette, visit 
Chapter 4.
	
✓	Use the same manners everywhere. Remind your children that they 
need to follow the same home chat and IM rules regardless of whether 
they are at a friend’s house or public location, such as school or a 
library computer. Chapter 5 discusses screen time at friends’ homes in 
more depth.
	
✓	Speak up. Require your children to report any suspicious or bullying 
behavior to you immediately and ask that they save the body of the 
chat in case you need to report it to a chat room administrator or other 
authority. Chapter 10 covers this topic in more detail, and Chapter 3 
deals with online predators, including how to report suspicious behavior.
	
✓	Follow platform-specific rules. Decide upon rules specific to the various 
types of chats, including video chat, text, and voice. For example, you 
may create different rules for a kids’ only online world with monitored 
text chat than you would for a video chat platform, such as FaceTime.
	
✓	Keep it public. Ask that your children never accept a request to enter 
a private chat room with someone they only know online. They should 
report to you if someone has asked them to do this. They should 
also avoid member-created chat rooms, which are less likely to be 
moderated.
	
✓	Choose your chat room carefully. Encourage your children to pay atten­
tion to chat room names when they are joining a conversation because 
the name of the room may indicate the tone of the chat taking place.
	
✓	Do not click links or downloads. Remind them to not click any links or 
downloads shared with them in chat rooms and messaging platforms.
	
✓	Keep the folks informed. Ask your children to let you know if they have 
begun to chat with someone on a regular basis and form a relationship 
with someone that they only know online.

118
Part II: Navigating the Digital World Kids Live In 
	
✓	Set the rules. Establish rules about what to do if a user continues to 
request chats after being denied or if a user says something inappropri­
ate: for example, using the block or ignore features in the messaging 
program.
You will likely need to create different rules for different age groups of chil­
dren in your family. Most young children who are old enough to read can 
safely enjoy restricted chat with pre-populated greetings and responses, 
while children a bit older may be able to safely enjoy open chats on safe, 
child-only platforms while using appropriate chat profiles with appropriate 
privacy settings
	
Just because a chat room says it is for kids, there may still be adults chatting, 
and the content may not be appropriate.
Before allowing your children to participate in any chat platform, be sure that 
they know how to do the following:
	
✓	Keep a history. Change the chat settings so that chat history is saved. 
This may be needed in the future should you need to report a chat 
or user.
	
✓	Report a suspicious chat. All chat platforms have steps that users can 
take to report suspicious activity. If your child is old enough, he may 
be able to report suspicious or inappropriate behavior without your 
help. Younger children may need you to help them decide whether con­
tent should be reported and locate how to do this. Figure 7-9 shows an 
example from Bearville.com of how to report a user for inappropriate 
behavior.
	
Figure 7-9:

suspicious 
activity on

com.
	

119
 Chapter 7: Preparing Kids for Online Chats
	
✓	Block a user. Chat platforms allow users to block specific users, keep­
ing them from reaching out again to your child’s account. Each platform 
does this a bit differently, so be sure to help your child find the steps 
they will take to block a user in the event that they need to do so. 
Figure 7-10 is an example of how to block a user on the Skype online call­
ing, video messaging, and text IM program.

Even after discussing the safety concerns of online conversation and your 
family’s rules as laid out in your Digital Family Policy, you might still be con­
cerned about your children and online chatting. Consider installing monitor­
ing software on your family’s computer that can help you capture all chat and 
IM activity. You can even have activity logs and Friend/buddy lists e-mailed 
to you. Some monitoring software includes chats on gaming and social media 
platforms as well as voice, video, and text chatting. For more information 
about available monitoring software, read Chapter 3.

C

hildren are naturally curious, and in this digital world, that means turn­
ing to the Internet for answers to their questions. Gone are the days of 
paging through dusty old books to write reports. Kids use search engines to 
not only satiate their own curiosity but also to create school reports, write 
papers, and craft science projects. With Internet search engines an integral 
part of most families’ daily lives, you need to understand how these tools 
select the information they provide. Let this chapter be your guide as you 
look at ways to protect your children from links that could be dangerous to 
computers and other devices, and protect your children also from inappro­
priate material.
Selecting a Search Engine
The key to understanding which search engine is right for your family’s use is 
to first understand how each of the most popular search engines works.

122
Part II: Navigating the Digital World Kids Live In 
Google (www.google.com) and Bing (www.bing.com) are the two top 
search engines. Each tool uses proprietary software that “crawls” the 
Internet looking for new pages and information to collect and add to platform 
indices. The information in these indices is then organized according to a 
unique algorithm that decides what each page is about. When you, the user, 
enter a query in the search box on a search engine page, the tool’s software 
tries to find the most relevant pages that are indexed.
	
Search engines do not, in fact, search the web — they search the pages that 
have already been filed into the search indices of each tool.
Both of the top two search engines locate answers to your search requests in 
essentially the same way.
Google
Google uses a patented and trademarked system — PageRank — to deter­
mine which results are most relevant to the search query. PageRank assigns 
a numerical weight to each website, which then influences how close to the 
top of the list that site appears in search results.
Google also allows users to filter search results based on specific criteria. 
(See Figure 8-1.)

To see all your search filter options, select More from the menu shown in 
Figure 8-1.
Bing
Bing uses its “best match system,” which sorts search results according to 
what Bing believes is most relevant to the search term used. Like Google, 
Bing allows users to filter search results according to a variety of filters, as 
shown in Figure 8-2.

To see all your search filter options, select More from the menu shown in 
Figure 8-2.
Bing also provides the following search features:
	
✓	Deep Link: Users can preview a website without having to click the link 
in the search result.
	
✓	Explore Pane: Users can search the search results.
	
✓	Instant Answers: Using this feature provides users with quick, most rel­
evant answers to a search query.
When discussing search engines during the creation of your Digital Family 
Policy, discuss not only the specific search engines, but also the types of 
search features that your family feels are appropriate for each member of 
your family. I discuss image searches in particular later in this chapter and 
provide special areas of concern for some parents.
Understanding how search 
results differ by user
Both Google and Bing retain information on your browser regarding past 
searches and use this information to influence future search results. Both 
search engines can integrate social media into their search results, allow­
ing information from Friends to shape the results provided in response to a 
search query. Google not only uses past searches to influence future results, 
but also takes into account which search results you’ve followed (clicked) in 
the past.

125
 Chapter 8: Search Engines, Image Search Results, and Sponsored Links
Some parents prefer that search engine results not include personalization, 
such as the influence of social media and past search activity. Perhaps mul­
tiple users within your family are using the same Google account, or you’re 
concerned that past search results preferences will manipulate the current 
results of a search for a school report.
As a preventive, you can sign in to your Google account and disable personal­
ization within the search engine to keep personalized results from appearing 
in future searches.
	
1.	Click the gear symbol in the upper right of the Google search results 
page.
	
2.	Choose Search Settings from the drop-down menu. (See Figure 8-3.)
	
3.	Under Personal Results, select the Do Not Use Personal Results radio 
button. (See Figure 8-4.)

You can also choose to turn off your Google Web History to disable history-
based search customizations while signed in to your Google account.
	
1.	Click the gear symbol in the upper right of the search results page, 
but this time, choose Web History from the drop-down menu (refer to 
Figure 8-3).
	
	 The Web History page appears.
	
2.	Select the gear symbol again and click Settings. (See Figure 8-5).

Even if you’re not signed in to a Google account, your search results on 
Google will still be personalized based on past search information, thanks to 
a cookie on your computer’s web browser. To disable this personalization, 
take the following steps:

From this page, you can also view and clear all Bing search history.
Because many families share digital devices — and, therefore, search 
history — discuss the option of disabling search history on these shared 
devices and accounts to keep the actions of one family member from affect­
ing the search results of fellow family members. You may also want to create 
separate browser accounts for each family member, or perhaps for parents 
and children.
	
If you disable search history on a particular browser or platform, though, you 
won’t be able to view your child’s search history.
Distinguishing Sponsored 
Results from Unsponsored
Even with personalized search results disabled and such tools as PageRank 
and the Bing Best Match system in place, children may not realize that some 
of the results in response to their search queries actually appear because the 
site owners have paid an advertising fee, not because they’re the most rel­
evant results for that search.
Just like it’s smart to help kids identify advertising content on websites they 
visit (see Chapter 9 for more information about advertising to kids), helping 
your children see the difference between paid and unpaid search results can 
help them determine the most useful information for their projects, papers, 
and other search purposes. 
Recognizing sponsored search results
On Google search results pages, topically related paid links appear on the 
right side of the search results page but also at the top of the list of search 
results.
Depending on the search query, shopping results may also appear within the 
search results or sidebar without the user first selecting the shopping search 
filter. (See Figure 8-10.) These shopping results sometimes appear because of 
sponsored content.

130
Part II: Navigating the Digital World Kids Live In 
	
Figure 8-10: 
Shopping 
links in 
Google 
search 
results.
	
All paid search results on Google are clearly labeled as either sponsored or 
as an ad, as shown in Figure 8-10, making it much easier for parents to help 
kids distinguish between organic search results and results that appear as a 
paid advertisement.
Organic search results are those that appear because of the Google PageRank 
and Bing Best Match systems that were explained earlier in the chapter. 
These organic searches provide the user with the most relevant links in 
response to the user search. Paid and sponsored results appear only because 
an advertising fee was paid to the search engine. These results may not be 
relevant, and they exist with the purpose of self-promotion, so they may 
not be as useful as the organic searches and may also take you to offers and 
solicitations rather than information.
During the creation of your Digital Family Policy (see Chapter 2), you may 
wish to discuss rules for clicking these paid search results.
Similarly, when searching Bing, paid search results also appear above and 
to the right of organic search results. (See Figure 8-11.) As you can see in 
Figure 8-11, all paid links on Bing are clearly marked with the word Ads.

Changing sponsored link settings
Google allows users to change advertising personalization settings. If you’re 
signed in to your Google account when searching the web through Google, 
you will be provided with ads based on your account history. Even if you 
sign out of your Google account before searching, you will be shown ads that 
Google believes are relevant to you based on page content or search terms. 
To opt out of personalized ads, take the following steps:
	
1.	Go to www.google.com/ads/preferences.
	
2.	Click the Ads on Search link from the left sidebar. (See Figure 8-12.)

Using Kid-Safe Search Filters
Not only do major Internet search tools offer filters and settings to protect 
your family, but a variety of supplementary tools are available that you can 
use to monitor and screen the search results that appear to your children. 
Additionally, search engines have been created with kids in mind to pro­
vide them with a safe way to search for the information they need and the 
answers to the questions they have.
Google SafeSearch
SafeSearch by Google screens sites and removes certain sites from search 
results based on preferences and settings. Parents can use SafeSearch to pre­
vent adult content from appearing in search results. To use the SafeSearch 
filter on your family’s computer, take the following steps:
	
1.	Go to www.google.com/preferences.
	
2.	On the Search Settings page (as shown in Figure 8-14), select the Filter 
Explicit Results check box.
	
Figure 8-14: 
Enable 
SafeSearch 
on Google.
	

134
Part II: Navigating the Digital World Kids Live In 
	
3.	To lock the SafeSearch setting, click the Lock SafeSearch link to the 
right of the SafeSearch Filters check box. (See Figure 8-15.)
	
	 You might be asked to sign in to your Google account to complete these 
steps.
	
Figure 8-15: 
Lock 
SafeSearch 
settings on 
Google.
	
	
4.	On the SafeSearch Filtering page that appears, confirm by clicking the 
Lock SafeSearch button.
	
	 You will receive a confirmation page, and Google will appear differ­
ently on your computer, making it possible to tell from across the room 
whether your children are searching the web via a SafeSearch-enabled 
Google page.
To verify that your child is using SafeSearch, look for the colorful spheres in 
the top-right corner of all search pages, as shown in Figure 8-16.

Bing filters
Bing also allows users to change search preferences to filter by content. To 
change the search settings on Bing, take the following steps:
	
1.	Click the gear symbol in the upper right at www.bing.com. (Refer to 
Figure 8-8.)
	
2.	Select your SafeSearch settings from the following radio buttons, as 
shown in Figure 8-17:
 
• Strict: This selection filters out adult text, images, and videos from 
the search results page.
 
• Moderate: This selection filters out adult images and videos but not 
text from your search results page.
 
• Off: This setting completely turns off filters from search.
	
3.	Click the Save button in the lower-right corner of this screen to save 
your settings.

Additional Kid-Friendly Search Options
A variety of platforms, tools, and applications have been created with the 
express purpose of allowing kids to safely search the Internet. The follow­
ing are some of the options for parents who would like to allow children to 
browse the internet without close supervision, but still feel confident that 
their children are not being exposed to inappropriate content:
	
✓	Ranger Browser, a free application available for both Android and iOS, 
replaces the standard web browser on the tablet or phone, and provides 
the following safety features:
 
• Provides five levels of filtering
 
• Gives parents the option of setting use time limits
 
• Records all visited websites for parents to view
 
• Allows parents to both allow and block specific websites
	
✓	KIDO’Z (www.kidoz.net), a tool available for phones (both Android 
and iOS), tablets, and computers, provides a free trial, but to fully access 
the tools, parents must purchase a license of use. A KIDO’Z subscription 
includes access to the KIDO’Z Browser, prepopulated with thousands of 
kid-friendly content from sites that were created for kids.
	
✓	Ask Kids (www.askkids.com) is the child-friendly version of Ask.com, a 
free search engine designed specifically for children ages 6–12. Ask Kids 
uses a proprietary search engine to filter content around a variety of 
core educational topics. This safe browser is intended to be a resource 
for kids needing to search the Internet for educational purposes.
	
✓	KidsClick! (www.kidsclick.org), a search engine created by librarians 
hoping to catalog sites and age-appropriate information for kids, allows 
children to browse by topic or use a search engine. The search results 
include not only a description, but also the suggested reading level.
	
✓	Awesome Library (www.awesomelibrary.org), a web-based search 
engine designed to provide kids with a safe place to find educational 
resources, provides kids with only carefully reviewed search results.
	
✓	Dib Dab Doo and Dilly Too (www.dibdabdoo.com) provides kids with 
a Google-based search engine that contains safety filters. This site also 
provides a catalog of pre-screened links on topics ranging from news to 
nature.

137
 Chapter 8: Search Engines, Image Search Results, and Sponsored Links
	
✓	CantUFind.com (www.cantufind.com) uses a prescreened directory of 
resources to allow children to search the Internet or browse a directory 
according to categories.
	
✓	Sweet Search (www.sweetsearch.com) designed for use by students, 
provides search results that have been evaluated by experts before 
appearing on the site.
	
✓	Quintura Kids (www.quinturakids.com), a children’s search engine, 
handpicks the sites that appear in search results and rechecks sites 
from time to time for safety. Search results appear not only in a tradi­
tional list format, but also in a tag cloud of suggested terms to help kids 
refine their search and find more relevant information.
	
✓	KidRex (www.kidrex.org), a free browser-based search engine pow­
ered by Google Custom Search, uses Google SafeSearch to provide 
results that focus on kid-related web pages. KidRex also maintains its 
own database of inappropriate keywords and websites to help filter and 
provide safer search results for kids.
Allowing Image Search Results
Image searches can be some of the most concerning for parents because 
rather than a site title and link, kids are immediately exposed to the images 
that appear within the search results. Image searches, however, can be very 
useful to kids for everything from a science project to how to complete a 
level on a favorite video game. When creating your Digital Family Policy, be 
sure to include specific guidelines for using image searches, including which 
search tools may be utilized and if kids are permitted to use image searches 
without adult supervision.
Previewing image search results
Even with safety filters in place, inappropriate content can indeed slip 
through and appear in your child’s search results. For this reason, consider 
previewing image search results either on behalf of your child or with your 
child before allowing them to click through the image to the site itself. When 
searching for images on both Google and Bing, users are provided with 
thumbnails of the images, as shown in Figure 8-18. This affords parents the 
opportunity to screen results.

 Chapter 8: Search Engines, Image Search Results, and Sponsored Links
Employing alternative image search tools
Just as there are alternative text search engines for kids, some sites allow 
kids to search for images in a safe environment. The following are three 
options:
	
✓	Pics4Learning.com (www.pics4learning.com) provides a safe (and 
free) image library that gives kids access to copyright-friendly photos 
they can use for school projects.
	
✓	Picsearch (www.picsearch.com) uses family-friendly filters to remove 
all offensive material from image search results.
	
✓	KidsClick! (http://kidsclick.org) not only provides kids with text 
search results but also provides an image search. The results have been 
carefully filtered to be safe for children.

Becoming Aware of Online 
Advertising
In This Chapter
▶	Navigating sidebar advertising
▶	Identifying unexpected pop-up ads
▶	Teaching kids to avoid clicking text link ads
▶	Locating hidden ads in special content
T

he digital world is an amazing place for today’s children, offering 
nearly unlimited educational resources, opportunities to connect with 
enhanced content, and endless entertainment. Most parents would say that 
their kids are even better at navigating the online world than they are, but 
what both kids and parents may not realize is how advertisers have cre­
atively found ways to expose even the youngest consumers to marketing 
messages while they enjoy online content. For parents looking to limit their 
children’s exposure to advertising, make identifying hidden marketing a pri­
ority as well as educating your kids about the potential dangers of clicking 
ads marketed to then.
Screening for Sidebar Advertising
As of this writing, federal legislation requires that websites aimed at children 
must obtain parental consent before gathering identifying information (such 
as name and e-mail address) from any user younger than age 13. I cover 
this legislation — the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA; 
www.coppa.org) — in further detail in Chapter 11. Despite this legislation, 
though, websites have been able to find loopholes allowing them to gather 
information about your children’s online habits to be used for marketing pur­
poses. For more information about how to protect your children’s privacy via 
web browser settings and privacy software, visit Chapter 3.

142
Part II: Navigating the Digital World Kids Live In 
Even with the existence of COPPA, children are still subjected to a variety 
of advertising while visiting some of the most popular children’s pages on 
the web. Just as you would watch a new television show for the first time 
with your children or ask friends’ parents about a popular movie in theaters 
before allowing your kids to go see it, you should stop by the websites that 
your children frequent to screen for potential advertising aimed at your kids. 
One of the most obvious locations where websites sell advertising space is in 
the right sidebar of the page, as shown in Figure 9-1.
To know what types of advertisements to display for your children, most 
sites install tracking programs — “cookies” or “beacons” — on your home 
computer. The information collected about your children’s online behaviors 
helps marketers know which advertisements to show your children while 
they are online. Some studies have shown that more tracking devices are 
placed on home computers as a result of visits to websites for kids and teens 
than as a result of web browsing by adults. These tracking devices are also 
used to create a profile of your child, which is then sold to advertisers. The 
types of information collected about your children include
	
✓	Age
	
✓	Preferences based on web browsing
	
✓	Hobbies
	
✓	Shopping habits
	
✓	Race
	
✓	Location
	
Figure 9-1:

advertising.
	

143
 Chapter 9: Becoming Aware of Online Advertising
	
Sites are not allowed to sell data sharing your child’s name and e-mail address.
When visiting the sites that your child frequents to monitor sidebar adver­
tising, note whether the site displays consistent ads sold to one advertiser 
or whether the sidebar location has been sold to an ad network that serves 
advertisements to the site based on cookies placed in your web browser. 
Ads that are the result of an ad network — rather than a static ad from one 
sponsor — typically include text in a corner of the advertisement related to 
the network. Many ad networks rely on tracking devices to choose which ads 
to display, so sites displaying this type of sidebar ad are potentially more 
likely to place beacons and cookies on your computer or web browser.
	
You can block cookies via your web browser to prevent sites from tracking 
your child’s online activity.
Unexpected Pop-up Ads
Even if you prescreen websites for advertising content prior to allowing your 
children to visit those sites, they may still experience unexpected pop-up 
advertising. You can take steps, though, to avoid exposing your kids to unan­
ticipated advertising.
Defining pop-up ads and how they work
Pop-up ads are a form of Internet advertising specifically designed to catch 
the website user’s attention, distracting them from whatever else they’re 
doing. (See Figure 9-2.) They may appear when your child clicks from one 
page to another or search for a particular term, or they may even appear as 
a special game or feature of the website your child is visiting. That action, 
which may even just be logging on to the site, triggers the pop-up ad to 
appear onscreen. Pop-up ads are used by many advertisers because they are 
more likely to both catch the user’s attention and to get them to click the 
advertisement.
Unlike ads that appear in the margins around the page’s content, pop-up ads 
appear in a new browser window that floats over the page being viewed. The 
advertising windows can appear in a variety of sizes, but they typically are 
smaller than the browser window. Pop-up ads obscure the website the user is 
trying to view, forcing them to engage with the pop-up window to either close 
it or move it out of the way. At times, the advertisement may contain graph­
ics that appear to guide the user to close the window, when it actually tricks 
the user into clicking through the ad to another site. These types of pop-up 
ad tricks make it more likely that kids will click through without realizing the 
potential dangers.

144
Part II: Navigating the Digital World Kids Live In 
	
Figure 9-2: 
Children’s 
sites have 
annoying 
pop-up ads.
	
Pop-up advertisements also sometimes appear behind the active window. 
These ads are referred to as “pop-under ads” and are not noticeable until you 
close the browser window you are using, making it very difficult to tell which 
site caused the pop-under ad to appear.
	
Pop-up advertisements may be from legitimate companies, but they may 
also be phishing scams hoping to collect information from unsuspecting web 
users. These scams may ask kids to share protected information, such as their 
names, ages, and e-mail addresses. Because some websites use pop-up brows­
ers legitimately to request approval or confirmation to begin a requested task, 
some children may not be able to determine whether the request is coming 
from the website they are using or from a site hoping to scam them into shar­
ing their information.
	
Although some websites cause pop-up windows to appear when visited or 
when users take certain actions, sometimes pop-ups appear because of a virus 
or cookie on your computer. To read more about how to disable cookies and 
change your browser settings, read Chapter 3.
Changing settings to avoid pop-ups
You may know from experience that certain sites your children go to cause 
pop-up ads to appear. If that’s the case, ask your kids to avoid those sites to 
protect your computer and private information. Better yet, disable pop-up 
ads from appearing on your computer, regardless of what site your kids go to.

Along with using your web browser preferences to prevent pop-up ads from 
appearing during Internet use, you can also purchase security programs to 
block pop-up ads from appearing on your computer. These programs are 
often included within other protective software such as those that I discuss 
in Chapter 3. Typically, such software not only blocks pop-up ads, but also 
erases spyware or adware that has been installed on your computer without 
your knowledge.
Even if you elect to block pop-up ads on your home computer, still take some 
time to discuss pop-up ads with children of all ages. Remind them that click­
ing these ads may harm the computer and that pop-up ads should be closed 
immediately. If they’re unsure how to close a pop-up ad safely, have them 
come to you for help before proceeding.
	
Include rules regarding pop-up ads in your Digital Family Policy (see 
Chapter 2) even if you disable pop-up ads on your web browser.

 Chapter 9: Becoming Aware of Online Advertising
Teaching Kids about Text Link Ads
It’s fairly easy to show kids where to find most of the advertising content on 
sites targeted to children. However, some sites also use text link ads to earn 
money on their site, and kids may click these links without realizing that 
they’re actually clicking on advertising.
Identifying text link ads
Advertisers pay web page owners to link back to their own sites via keywords. 
For example, a site selling bicycles for kids may pay a site to link the words 
“best kids’ bikes” to their site. The goal of the text link ad is not necessarily for 
your children to click that link. Instead, those purchasing the concealed adver­
tisement are hoping to capitalize on the popularity of the site containing the 
text link ad to increase their own site’s rankings in search engines.
Many sites require you (or your kids) to click links to access all aspects of 
the site, such as moving from one page to another or beginning a new game. 
Because digital natives are so used to recognizing and clicking text with 
hyperlinks, it may be difficult for them to distinguish between links that 
transport them to additional site content and those that take them away from 
the site they are on to a new site. Although most advertising on websites 
is clearly labeled — Sponsored Content or Advertisement — text link ads are 
almost never labeled, making identifying them even more confusing.
Help your children recognize the difference between a hyperlink that leads 
them to additional site content and a text link ad by looking at how sites 
typically lead kids from one site feature to another. Sites typically draw the 
user to more content through the use of graphics or buttons, such as the 
featured games shown in Figure 9-8. When simple text is used, this text tends 
to appear in list or bullet form rather than being found within additional text 
that’s not identified as additional site content. (See Figure 9-9.)

additional 
site content.

Figure 9-9: 
List of links 
to additional 
site content.
	
Some children’s websites display a pop-up warning (see Figure 9-10) notify­
ing the user that they have clicked a link that will take them to a new site and 
asking them to verify that they meant to do this. Prior to allowing your kids 
to visit a site, discuss your family’s policy regarding what to do if they see 
one of these pop-up warnings. Unless your child has previously clicked a link 
taking them to this site and knows that it is safe, it may be best for them to 
opt to stay on their current site and ask you before clicking through again. 
This pop-up warning may be an indication that they unknowingly clicked a 
text link advertisement.

151
 Chapter 9: Becoming Aware of Online Advertising
Finally, point out text link ads to your kids to help them understand that 
some hyperlinked text on a website is there for the benefit of an advertiser — 
not because it adds in any way to the user’s experience. Images such as the 
one shown in Figure 9-11 (see the links at the bottom) are a great way to 
show kids how text link ads appear on many sites.
	
Figure 9-11: 
An example 
of a text link

ment within

Seeing the dangers of clicking links
Certainly many text ad links that appear on sites aimed at kids are harmless, 
but potential dangers are associated with kids clicking links. One possibility 
is that the link is actually part of a phishing scam.
Phishing scams are designed to trick the victim into providing identifying 
information that can then be used to steal money, steal the user’s identity, or 
target them for similar fraudulent crimes. These types of links may take you 
to a page offering a special download or opportunity that will then lead you 
to turn over your information under false pretenses. The pages and down­
loads often claim to be helpful and may target your children by claiming to 
offer special opportunities or features, when they are really simply trying 
to steal from you. Phishing links may even take your children to sites that 
appear to be legitimate favorites but are really copycat sites. See Chapter 3 to 
read more about identity theft and ways to protect your family.
Another potential danger comes in the form of malware. Malware — mali­
cious software — infects your computer to steal information stored on the 
computer or disrupt the functioning of your computer. Some text link ads 
cause malware to infect your computer when someone clicks them. Antivirus 
and antimalware software can help to protect your computer from these dan­
gerous computer viruses.

A third potential danger that results from clicking text link ads is viewing 
inappropriate content. Sites containing adult content sometimes attempt to 
trick teen users into visiting their site by purchasing text link ads on sites 
targeted toward teens and disguising the link to inappropriate content within 
unrelated keywords. Popular brand names for kids — things like My Little 
Pony and Pokemon — are used in the titles of adult content sites as well as 
in text link ads to trick kids into clicking on these links. Include rules within 
your Digital Family Policy regarding what to do should your children acci­
dentally navigate to a site with inappropriate content, including rules about 
future visits to the site containing the inappropriate link.
During the creation of your Digital Family Policy, discuss phishing scams and 
malware in relationship to links within website content. Consider including 
a rule in your Digital Family Policy that asks your kids to come to you if they 
clicked potentially dangerous or damaging links or have approved a poten­
tially dangerous download. You may need to scan your computer to check 
for potential damage and make repairs.
Preventing phishing and malware
As I mention in Chapter 3, most web browsers offer protection from both 
phishing scams and sites containing malware. Phishing typically surfaces as 
unsolicited e-mail pretending to be from banks or other institutions (includ­
ing AOL and PayPal) requesting that the recipient click through and provide 
information.
Internet Explorer provides users with protection against phishing and mal­
ware as part of their default settings. Within the Internet Options Security 
menu, users can verify that they will be prompted before downloading poten­
tially unsafe content. Discuss with your children that they may see this type 
of prompt, as shown in Figure 9-12, and that they should not proceed with 
the download.

Recognizing Advertising Disguised 
as Special Features
One of the amazing aspects of living in this digital age is the access our chil­
dren have to vibrant interactive content. Favorite characters and stories now 
come alive onscreen through interactive games and video content. These 
enriched content features are a wonderful resource, but they are also some­
times the source of disguised advertising and marketing content.
Unlike text link advertisements, special feature advertising is less dangerous 
in terms of potential phishing scams, downloads containing malware, and 
inappropriate content. However, for parents looking to limit their children’s 
exposure to advertising, this type of marketing may be of concern because of 
both its prevalence and popularity with kids.

156
Part II: Navigating the Digital World Kids Live In 
One type of marketing hidden with special content is an “advergame.” (See 
Figure 9-15.) Trusted and popular websites hoping to promote a new feature 
or product create these new online games with the purpose of introducing 
this product to their users.
	
Figure 9-15: 
An adver-
game on 
a popular 
children’s 
website 
can hide 
marketing.
	
Unlike a traditional advertisement, advergames provide the site user with a 
gaming experience rather than asking them to passively view an ad. Users 
connect with the characters within the game, which then begin to appear in 
DVDs for sale or products for purchase. Although some advergames simply 
introduce users to a new character that will be available for purchase, others 
very directly feature a known product, such as a favorite cereal brand or an 
action hero. Still others hide the marketing messaging or product images 
within the game rather than introduce them directly.
If your children are playing on branded websites (such as those owned by 
popular children’s networks Nickelodeon and Disney), they are already 
playing games created with the intent of furthering a connection to favorite 
characters and their related products. However, you may want to include a 
discussion during the creation of your Digital Family Policy regarding what 
to do if newly featured advergames request that users provide information 
(such as your child’s e-mail address) before continuing with game play.
Another hidden form of advertising is the video ad, as shown in Figure 9-16. 
Some video ads are promoted within existing web content as a special feature 
and ask users to click to view the video. Although the video appears to be a 
special new feature, video ads are intended to promote a product or service 
to the site user. Other types of video ads appear prior to allowing access to a 
website’s regular content. Show your children that these video ads can typi­
cally be closed after a certain period of time (so that you continue directly 
to the website) by clicking the video screen. If you are concerned about your 
children’s exposure to advertising, you may wish to include a rule in your 
Digital Family Policy that prohibits your kids from visiting websites requiring 
them to watch video advertising prior to gaining access to the website.

157
 Chapter 9: Becoming Aware of Online Advertising
	
Figure 9-16: 
Video ads 
allow users 
to close 
the screen

Along with video ads and advergames, many sites aimed at children and 
teens hide advertising within interactive content, such as surveys and quiz­
zes, that can be forwarded — and that often capture protected information, 
such as your teen’s e-mail address. Other times, advertising may appear as 
special offers, such as ringtone downloads, that pop up on sites frequented 
by children and teens. See Figure 9-17 for an example.
	
Figure 9-17: 
Advertising

To protect your children — as well as your computer — ask that they never 
click this additional content without your permission and that they never fill 
out any associated forms without your permission. Explain to them that this 
“free” content is actually sponsored by advertisers looking to gain access to 
your children and their information. Consider adding this rule to your Digital 
Family Policy.

158
Part II: Navigating the Digital World Kids Live In 
And at the end of the day . . .
Be sure to discuss each advertising type cov­
ered in this chapter with your children, and 
show them the examples I have here through­
out the chapter. Remind them that although 
some ads include the word “advertising” or 
“sponsored ad” in small print, not every ad is 
labeled this clearly. Kids need to understand 
that not all content on a website is related to 
that site or is safe to click. When creating your 
Digital Family Policy, don’t forget to create spe­
cific rules regarding clicking advertising con­
tent, even on trusted websites. In particular, 
be sure to warn your children about ads that 
ask them to download a file or provide informa­
tion, such as an e-mail address or a credit card 
number.
To help your kids understand advertising aimed 
at them, check out Admongo, a site created by 
the Federal Trade Commission to teach chil­
dren about advertising. This site is located at 
www.admongo.gov. This site is targeted to kids 
ages 8–12 and includes helpful information for 
parents, too.

Talking to Your Kids about 
Cyberbullying
In This Chapter
▶	Defining cyberbullying
▶	Noticing the signs of cyberbullying
▶	Protecting your child from becoming a cyberbully victim
▶	Preventing your child from cyberbullying others
▶	Having age-appropriate discussions about cyberbullying
A

ccording to the Cyberbullying Research Center (www.cyber
bullying.us), nearly 20 percent of students in the United States 
between age 11 and 18 have been cyberbullied. Girls are more likely to be 
cyberbullying victims than are boys, and social media users are more at 
risk than nonusers. Although being a victim of cyberbullying can be a pass­
ing unpleasant experience for some teens, some young people have been 
pushed to the point of taking their own lives because of the overwhelming 
victimization they faced at the hands of cyberbullies. With nearly all children 
and teens spending time online, include a conversation about cyberbullying 
not only during the creation of your Digital Family Policy (see Chapter 2), 
but also as a regular part of talking to your children about online safety and 
appropriate behavior.
Defining Cyberbullying
Cyberbullying comprises any digital communication, typically from one minor 
to another minor, with the purpose of frightening, threatening, embarrass­
ing, or harassing a person. The most common form of cyberbullying is shar­
ing a private text message, e-mail, or instant message (IM) with someone 
else or through a public posting. Cyberbullies’ tools are computers and 
smartphones, and they plague victims via text, e-mail, IM, chat rooms, social 
media, and blogs. Examples of cyberbullying behaviors include

160
Part II: Navigating the Digital World Kids Live In 
	
✓	Using websites to rank or rate peers according to things such as looks 
and popularity
	
✓	Publicly blocking someone’s participation in an online group
	
✓	Tricking someone into sharing embarrassing information with the pur­
pose of sharing it digitally with others
	
✓	Creating a website with the purpose of harassing someone
	
✓	Creating a fake social media account to pose as another person and post 
untrue things about that person
	
✓	Sending threatening or mean e-mails, text messages, and IMs in chat 
rooms
	
✓	Posting embarrassing pictures of someone on a social media website
The effects of cyberbullying can be far more devastating for victims than tra­
ditional bullying:
	
✓	Cyberbullies often remain anonymous, making victims unsure of how to 
protect themselves and whom to trust.
	
✓	Victims often receive bullying messages via their home computer, taking 
away their feeling of safety within their own home.
	
✓	Victims may be affected both at school and online, taking away two pri­
mary locations where teens socialize and interact.
	
✓	Cyberbullies can reach a large number of people easily and instantly, 
making it possible for the entire world to see the behaviors and shared 
information about the victim.
	
✓	Because cyberbullies don’t face their victims, the bullying behaviors are 
often more extreme than traditional bullying.
	
✓	Cyberbullies can attack their victims frequently on multiple technology 
platforms simultaneously.
Many states have laws regarding cyberbullying, but current laws vary by 
state. To see where your state stands regarding cyberbullying legislation, 
visit www.cyberbullying.us/Bullying_and_Cyberbullying_Laws.pdf. 
Cyberharassment
Cyberharassment is beyond typical cyberbullying. The person harassing 
the victim digitally may be doing so with a specific goal, such as getting 
the victim to do or admit to something. The methods are often the same as 
cyberbullying in general and include sending harassing or threatening digital 
communications.

161
 Chapter 10: Talking to Your Kids about Cyberbullying
Some U.S. states consider cyberharassment to be an incident of cyberbul­
lying that includes at least one adult. Although most cases of cyberbullying 
happen between two minors, there are known cases of adults harassing a 
minor online. Your kids should understand that any occurrence of these 
types of behaviors should be reported to you immediately. Some states 
include cyberharassment under existing harassment laws.
	
Be sure to discuss cyberharassment with your teens when discussing cyber­
bullying and your family’s consequences for such behavior. Include these con­
sequences in your Digital Family Policy and enforce a zero-tolerance policy.
Both the definition of cyberharassment and any laws regarding cyberharass­
ment differ by state.
Cyberstalking
Some behaviors considered as cyberbullying may fall under the category 
of cyberstalking — when someone uses the Internet, e-mail, or other digital 
forms of communication or devices to stalk another person. This may include 
some of the same harassing and threatening behaviors as cyberbullying in 
general, but typically resembles offline stalking (such as constantly watching 
the victim or repeatedly trying to contact the victim). Cyberstalking often 
begins when a teen tries to end either an online or offline relationship. The 
cyberstalker may react to this attempted severing of communication by send­
ing repeated, sometimes threatening, messages via text, e-mail, and social 
media. Some cyberstalkers even enlist friends in harassing the victim digitally.
Cyberstalking is a very serious and often dangerous situation, and teens 
should report potential cyberstalking immediately. Like offline stalking, 
online stalking often moves from online threats to actual physical acts of vio­
lence. Some cyberstalking is at the hands of online predators who your teen 
may not know in real life. See Chapter 3 for more information about online 
predators and how to report contact from a potential online predator.
	
Cyberstalking often stems from an offline relationship that has ended badly.
Teens who are the victims of cyberstalking should take the following steps:
	
✓	Make it clear in writing to the stalker that you do not want to receive 
contact from the person.
	
✓	Keep an unedited record of all communication from the potential 
cyberstalker.

162
Part II: Navigating the Digital World Kids Live In 
	
✓	Keep a record of any contact with your Internet service or phone service 
provider regarding the issue.
	
✓	Change privacy settings to block contact from this person. See Chapter 
12 for more information about Facebook settings, and Chapter 3 for 
information about additional privacy measures. I discuss blocking later 
in this chapter.
	
✓	Contact local law enforcement.
Recognizing the Signs of Cyberbullying
Even with the creation of a Digital Family Policy, parental supervision, and 
safety settings in place, your children may still be the victims of cyberbul­
lying. Keep a keen eye for signs that your children may be falling victim to a 
cyberbully.
Technology use decrease or increase
Suddenly withdrawing from technology is one of the first indicators that your 
child may be uncomfortable with a situation online. If your previously tech-
connected teen has suddenly stopped using his computer or phone, talk with 
him about this sudden change in behavior. On the other hand, if your child is 
suddenly spending much more time online, that may also indicate he is the 
subject of online bullying.
Emotional distress
Some victims of cyberbullying show signs of emotional distress without any 
apparent cause. Your child may suddenly become sullen, edgy, or quick to 
cry. She may seem anxious and unhappy for no reason. For some cyberbully 
victims, these behaviors may increase right after they use a computer or 
smartphone. If your child appears to be emotionally distressed, talk to her 
immediately and help her communicate clearly what she is experiencing so 
that she can get help.
Change in behavior or mood
Tween and teen years are an emotionally challenging time, but sudden and 
noticeable changes in behavior or mood are a red flag that your child may be 
facing something more than standard teenage angst. Watch for moodiness, 
agitation, or sudden shyness. Changes in behavior may include no longer 

163
 Chapter 10: Talking to Your Kids about Cyberbullying
participating in favorite activities or finding other friends. A previously well-
behaved child may start acting out or get in trouble at school. Your child 
may alter sleeping or eating habits or show signs of depression. Some victims 
of cyberbullying may even fear leaving the house.
Drop in grades/performance
Victims of cyberbullying often avoid attending school and may begin cutting 
classes, exhibit behavior problems in school, or ask to stay home because of 
illness. Trips to the school nurse may increase, and their grades may drop as 
they fall behind in schoolwork. If you notice any of these behaviors, discuss 
them with your children’s teachers, coaches, and school administrators; they 
may also have noticed the same change in behavior.
Secretive or withdrawn behavior
Children who are being subjected to cyberbullying may suddenly become 
socially withdrawn. A child who typically likes to spend time with friends 
may appear to be pushing all friends away. Victims of cyberbullying may also 
act secretive when they receive a text message or spend time online. Watch 
for examples that they are trying to hide information, such as leaving the 
room when a text message is sent to their phone or clicking a different tab on 
the computer when you enter the room.
Protecting Children from Cyberbullying
Discussions about cyberbullying should happen in all homes, hopefully 
before an incident of cyberbullying makes the discussion necessary. 
However, for many tweens and teens, cyberbullying is an uncomfortable 
topic. For kids who have already been victims of attacks online, discussing 
cyberbullying can be even more anxiety producing.
The key is to make it clear to your children that you are available to talk and 
willing to take their concerns seriously. Be sure to include your teen in decid­
ing how best to handle any potential cases of cyberbullying and assure him 
that you are working toward the same goal. Also include information in your 
Digital Family Policy regarding what steps the family can take should a child 
become the victim of cyberbullying, including limiting social media activity, 
changing social media accounts, or parents monitoring technology use.
You can also read the other chapters in this book to become more familiar 
with the types of technology that cyberbullies use to reach their victims, 
such as chat rooms and social media.

164
Part II: Navigating the Digital World Kids Live In 
Report cyberbullying
Although not all schools have policies regarding students and cyberbullying, 
contact your child’s teachers and school administrators if you believe that 
your child is being cyberbullied. Many schools offer resources to help par­
ents navigate this unfamiliar territory and may even assist parents in contact­
ing local police if the bullying behaviors reach a criminal level.
	
Contact the police immediately if your child receives a physical threat or oth­
erwise threatening communications.
For more information about which states currently have laws to prosecute 
cyberbullies, see
www.cyberbullying.us/Bullying_and_Cyberbullying_Laws.pdf
Be sure to save all communications that you believe are evidence of cyber­
bullying. You may also want to capture screen images of online cyberbullying 
on blogs and social media, because the cyberbully may remove or change 
those pages before the police can see them.
	
Many states have legislation against cyberbullying. Know your state’s laws 
regarding cyberbullying, including state-by-state guidelines for reporting.
Use blocking features
Many incidents of cyberbullying occur via social media, where blocking 
features can help teens avoid contact from the people who are doing the bul­
lying. Facebook allows users to choose who can see their information, includ­
ing status updates, Wall posts from Friends, and photos. Your teen can make 
nearly all her information visible to Friends only and can even block certain 
users by their account name or e-mail address. Twitter also allows users to 
protect their status updates and individually approve who can see those 
status posts. Additionally, Twitter allows users to block other users, prohibit­
ing them from sending messages via Twitter to the blocking user, as shown in 
Figure 10-1. To learn more about privacy and blocking features on Facebook, 
see Chapter 12.
Parents may also work with their phone service providers to block contact 
from specific phone numbers, both via text and voice. For more information 
about partnering with your phone service provider to create a safer environ­
ment for your children, see Chapter 17.

Preventing Your Child from Cyberbullying
Your children becoming the victim of a cyberbully is bad enough, but imag­
ine how hard it would be to consider that your child may be the perpetrator. 
To help prevent your child from being a cyberbully, know the signs that she 
may be engaging in this activity online, as well as what to do if she is.
Signs that your child may be a cyberbully
Teens who are taking part in online bullying activities may also show changes 
in behavior, just as victims do. Watch for the following changes in behavior:
	
✓	Your child may stop using the computer when you come into the room 
or quickly change screens or tabs.
	
✓	A child may sharply increase time spent on the computer or on a 
smartphone.
	
✓	Your child may appear anxious or secretive when using these devices, 
and may become anxious, upset, or excessively angry when you take 
away access.
	
✓	Your child may be spending more time with a new group of friends or 
perhaps no longer interact publicly with a long-time friend.

166
Part II: Navigating the Digital World Kids Live In 
	
Anxiety or secretive behavior around technology may also indicate that your 
child is being cyberbullied. See the earlier section, “Recognizing the Signs of 
Cyberbullying.”
Ongoing dialog
Unlike most parents, digital natives do not know a world free of social media 
and smartphones, and they may not understand why parents find some 
online behaviors confusing and disconcerting. Cyberbullying is often a group 
occurrence with more than one child playing a role and different participants 
contributing varying levels of bullying behaviors. By keeping an ongoing 
dialog with your children, you not only gain insight into this online world 
in which your kids live, but you may also discover warning signs that your 
child’s online group is participating in these types of activities. Use these 
conversations as a chance to discuss the following topics:
	
✓	Help your kids understand the difference between harmless joking and 
mean, harassing behaviors that others find hurtful.
	
✓	Continue to talk to your kids at every age about what is appropriate to 
share online, and what is not — including friends’ secrets and personal 
communications. See Chapter 4 for more about how to be a good friend 
online.
	
✓	Teach your children how to stand up to their friends to discourage bul­
lying behaviors online. Help them understand the importance of not 
standing by while others are being bullied.
	
✓	Help your kids find the words to tell their friends that they refuse to par­
ticipate in these bullying actions.
	
✓	Encourage your kids to talk to teachers, coaches, and friends’ parents 
if they don’t feel comfortable coming to you with concerns about their 
own online behavior, which may have potentially crossed the line into 
cyberbullying.
Consultations with teachers, 
coaches, and others
Most children spend less time each day with their parents than they do with 
their teachers, coaches, and school administrators. To get a clearer picture 
of your children’s daily lives at school, stay in touch with the adults in their 
lives for input if you believe that you’re seeing signs of cyberbullying in your 
child’s life, either from the role of the victim or the bully.

167
 Chapter 10: Talking to Your Kids about Cyberbullying
Although you may not see some of the signs that your child is interacting 
inappropriately through digital communication, your children’s teachers may 
be seeing these behaviors. For example, your teen may be caught texting 
in class, spending more time in the computer lab, or arguing with a former 
friend during school hours or sports practices.
Find out through your children’s teachers, administrators, or guidance coun­
selors whether your children’s school has a cyberbullying policy or speaks to 
students about cyberbullying.
	
Ask your child’s school what its policy is regarding cyberbullying.
Having Age-Appropriate Discussions 
about Cyberbullying
Just as your Digital Family Policy includes different rules for children of dif­
ferent ages, your family discussions about cyberbullying will change based 
on the ages of your children.
Elementary school children
Instead of focusing on specific aspects of technology that may not yet be 
part of your child’s life, discuss appropriate interactions in general and apply 
them to socializing online. The following topics can help you prepare your 
elementary-age children to not only avoid becoming cyberbullies themselves, 
but to also be aware when cyberbullying is occurring around them:
	
✓	As I discuss in Chapter 4, show your children that the same character­
istics that make a good friend offline also make a good friend online. 
A great place to start is with the Golden Rule: “Do unto others as you 
would have them do unto you.”
	
✓	Talk with your kids about how feelings can be hurt when people share 
secrets or tease one another. Most elementary-age children have 
learned about offline bullying, so ask your children to apply that same 
awareness to online behavior.
	
✓	This is also the perfect age to talk to your children about being a good 
digital citizen, including reporting (to parents, teachers, trusted adults) 
when they believe their friends may be in danger rather than staying 
silent when bullying occurs.
	
✓	Be sure to point out to your children that your family has included con­
sequences for cyberbullying in your Digital Family Policy.

168
Part II: Navigating the Digital World Kids Live In 
To help protect your elementary-age children, keep online socializing to a 
minimum and primarily on sites created specifically for children their age. See 
Chapter 21 for examples of age-appropriate social media sites for children.
Middle school children
Middle school children are far more likely than elementary school children to 
have either been victims of cyberbullying or to have participated in cyberbul­
lying themselves. Middle schoolers are beginning to use digital communica­
tion tools more often as well as participate in social media. To help protect 
your middle schoolers, take the following steps:
	
✓	Monitor their early social media use to help teach them about appropri­
ate and inappropriate behavior.
	
✓	Give your kids clear guidelines about what to do if they see behavior 
online that they believe is bullying.
	
✓	Reinforce the basic rules of good online behavior from Chapter 4 and 
the Digital Family Policy from Chapter 2, and talk about specific guide­
lines per device.
	
✓	Middle school children likely know someone who has used their smart­
phone or online accounts to do or say hurtful things, so discuss the 
ramifications of these actions and how the victim may feel after such an 
attack.
	
✓	Explain to your kids what cyberbullying involves and that it is serious 
enough to sometimes involve the police.
	
✓	Brainstorm examples of behaviors that may be included in cyberbully­
ing, and discuss what makes those behaviors cyberbullying.
	
✓	Establish and share clear codes of conduct for using each digital device, 
and be sure to remind kids of the consequences of breaking the code of 
conduct as laid out in your Digital Family Policy.
This is another opportunity to remind your children of the dangers of over-
sharing and the importance of not sharing passwords, even with friends they 
trust now, as I discuss in Chapter 3.
High school children
By the time your teens reach high school, they likely have an active, inde­
pendent online life that involves frequent use of texting, e-mail, and social 
media. For teens, a smartphone can be their main connection to their friends. 
Discussions with teens regarding cyberbullying may include the following 
points:

169
 Chapter 10: Talking to Your Kids about Cyberbullying
	
✓	In discussing the ramifications of cyberbullying as related to your Digital 
Family Policy, remind your kids of the consequences, which may include 
losing access to these devices.
	
✓	Remind your teens of the differences between offline bullying and cyber­
bullying and the often severe effects of cyberbullying on the victims.
	
✓	Help your teens understand the potential long-term effects of participat­
ing in cyberbullying, including possible legal ramifications (possibly 
expulsion or being arrested).
	
✓	Use current news stories about cyberbullying to encourage discussion 
about the seriousness of cyberbullying and how frequently it occurs.
	
✓	Ask your teens to include you in their social media Friend list so that 
you have access to what others are posting on their public pages.
	
✓	Discuss the differences between cyberbullying, cyberstalking, and cyber­
harassment, and set clear guidelines for how your teens should respond 
if they feel they have experienced any of these types of behaviors.
	
✓	Encourage your high school–age kids to take any threats or threatening 
language made online just as seriously as if they received the threats 
face to face.
	
✓	Ask your teens to ask any questions they have about cyberbullying 
and help guide both your discussions and your decisions about related 
family rules.
	
✓	Assure your teens they can always come to you if they feel they have 
been bullied or believe they may have crossed a line with their own 
online behavior.
	
Use your Digital Family Policy to help enforce rules across age groups in your 
home against cyberbullying.

M

any kids are anxious to join the world of social media, which they may 
see their parents or even older siblings enjoying. However, with most 
sites requiring users to be at least 13 years old to have an account, kids can’t 
join popular social media sites, such as Facebook and Twitter. Just because 
your kids aren’t old enough for top social media sites doesn’t mean that 
they’re left out in the social media cold, though. Sites created specifically for 
teens and even children younger than 13 allow your kids to dip their toes in 
social media waters, preparing them for future online interactions while pro­
viding entertainment.
	
Many social media sites — including Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram — 
require users to be at least 13 years old. Even though the terms of service 
require users to be at least 13 years old, many Facebook users are much 
younger. Ask your kids to make sure they have not set up an unauthorized 
account.

174
Part III: Grasping Social Media’s Effect on Your Family 
Understanding How Social Platforms for 
Children Differ from Adult Networks
There are many positive reasons for kids younger than 13 to engage in social 
media platforms created specifically for their age group. Not only do these 
platforms act as social media training wheels for kids who are growing up in 
a digital world, but they may also foster the following:
	
✓	Development of personal interests and identity
	
✓	Practicing social skills
	
✓	Sharing personal achievements
	
✓	Supporting friends’ achievements
	
✓	Collaboration on projects and group goals
	
✓	Interaction with teams and clubs
	
✓	Awareness of social good and causes
	
✓	Increased technical literacy
	
✓	Interest in community service and giving back
With potential benefits of allowing kids to engage in age-appropriate social 
media in mind, think about how social media platforms for kids differ from 
those created for teens and adults. Due to the U.S. FTC’s Children’s Online 
Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), which I cover in more detail later in this chap­
ter, sites that are aimed at children younger than 13 must follow strict guide­
lines. These platforms typically include the following unique characteristics:
	
✓	Parental approval for the child’s account creation
	
✓	Moderated interactions between users, including deleting banned words 
and cyberbullying
	
✓	Parental notifications of child account activity
When you think of social media use, you likely imagine platforms such as 
Facebook, where social interaction and sharing is the primary purpose. 
However, kids younger than 13 may be socializing online on platforms that 
you typically would not associate with social media.
	
The following platforms often also have online chatting capabilities (see 
Figure 11-1), Friend lists, and even ways to share files and images:

✓	Game consoles
	
✓	Classroom project sites
	
✓	Online virtual worlds
Researching and Monitoring 
Platform Safety
Even though social media sites created specifically for children typically 
follow rules in place to protect children, you should research each platform 
before allowing your children to create an account. You should also use the 
parental monitors created by each site to keep an eye on your children’s 
activity and select appropriate account settings.

176
Part III: Grasping Social Media’s Effect on Your Family 
Online ratings systems and reviews
Unlike the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB), which I cover in 
Chapter 6, there is no official ratings system for social media, including social 
media for kids. The best source of ratings and reviews for these platforms 
is Common Sense Media at www.commonsensemedia.org. Common Sense 
Media is a not-for-profit organization that rates and reviews movies, TV 
shows, songs, books, video games, apps, and websites. All site reviewers 
are trained to adhere to child development guidelines when writing their 
evaluations.
Common Sense Media’s reviews (see Figure 11-2), including those of social 
media for children, contain the following main ratings guidelines:
	
✓	Age: Ranging from ages 2 to 17, this category also includes color coding 
to help guide parents.
	
✓	Quality: This rating lets parents know whether the quality of the content 
is worthwhile.
	
Figure 11-2: 
Common 
Sense 
Media pro-
vides myriad 
data in their

177
 Chapter 11: Introducing Social Networking for Children
Common Sense Media also provides a rating in each of the following addi­
tional categories:
	
✓	Positive messages
	
✓	Violence
	
✓	Sex
	
✓	Language
	
✓	Consumerism
	
✓	Drinking, drugs, and smoking
	
✓	Privacy and safety
Additionally, many technology blogs review new sites when they are released, 
providing information about the quality, usability, and safety of the platform. In 
the quickly changing social media landscape, sites change often. Read updated 
reviews of your children’s favorite sites from time to time to stay up to date on 
changes and how they affect your child’s experience online.
Examining privacy policies
Every social media site for children contains a page with the site’s privacy 
policy. Before you help your child create an account, locate the privacy 
policy link (usually at the bottom of the web page) or the privacy conditions 
within the site’s terms of service.
Read the entire privacy policy carefully, looking specifically for information 
about the following:
	
✓	Compliance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)
	
✓	Details about age guidelines for users
	
✓	A list of what information the site will collect about your child
	
✓	Specifics regarding how the site will use that information, including 
whether they will share any of it with advertisers
	
✓	A description of how the site is moderated and by whom
	
✓	Site rules regarding parent accounts and ways that parents may monitor 
and/or restrict their children’s site usage
	
✓	Advertising policies, especially any use of third-party cookies, that will 
be placed on your computer’s web browser

178
Part III: Grasping Social Media’s Effect on Your Family 
	
✓	Rules about closing an account, including whether you can remove your 
child’s information from the site after an account has been created
	
✓	Particulars about account holder’s ability to change privacy settings
	
Even with privacy settings in place, anything your children post online could 
end up being seen and shared. If they don’t want something to get out, they 
should not post it anywhere on the Internet.
Sometimes social media account holders who have been added to Friend or 
buddy lists by your child may share your child’s posts and information with 
their own lists.
Accessing Your Children’s 
Profile Information
There is certainly no way to completely guarantee your child’s safety, even 
on the most carefully reviewed websites with stellar privacy policies. Having 
said that, no parent wants to monitor their child’s every action online, and 
that type of supervision misses the point of allowing our children to grow 
and learn using the amazing technology at their fingertips. However, I recom­
mend maintaining access to your children’s profile information not only to 
protect them from sharing too much or inappropriate information, but also 
to guide them as they craft their early digital presence.
As I mention earlier in this chapter, sites created for children younger than 
age 13 require parent permission before the child user may create a new 
account. Many sites also allow parents to create a parent account, though, 
which acts as a master account for all child accounts within that family, 
allowing parents to change settings, monitor usage, change profile informa­
tion, and more.
To access great safety tips, authenticate your child’s account, or create a 
master account, locate the Parents section of the social network platform. 
Figure 11-3 shows the Parents link on the popular site Everloop.

cally have a

Understanding COPPA
The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, most often referred to as 
COPPA, is a law passed in 1998 that allows parents to control what personal 
information companies can collect about children younger than age 13. 
COPPA also regulates the following:
	
✓	What must be included in a site’s privacy policy
	
✓	Rules for seeking verifiable consent from a parent or guardian before 
allowing a child younger than 13 to use a site
	
✓	Responsibilities of website owners to protect children’s privacy and 
safety online
In December of 2012, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) updated COPPA 
regulations to remain up to date with changes in technology. Changes include 
the following:
	
✓	Requiring sites to get parental permission before collecting a child’s 
photographs, videos, and location information (all popular components 
of social media)

180
Part III: Grasping Social Media’s Effect on Your Family 
	
✓	Requiring advertising providers (such as Google Ads) to obtain paren­
tal permission before tracking a child’s online activity in order to tailor 
advertising to that child’s online behavior
	
✓	No longer allowing apps for kids to permit third parties to collect per­
sonal information from the children without parental consent
	
✓	Extend COPPA regulations to cover IP addresses and mobile device 
identifiers
	
The changes do not, however, make app stores liable for the apps that they 
sell to children, which likely collect information about the children who use 
those apps.
Establishing family rules regarding 
parent access to accounts
Although many sites for children include the option for parents to create a 
master account to monitor child accounts, not every account has this fea­
ture. Also, if your child has his own e-mail address, he may be able to circum­
vent the rules in place regarding parent verification of accounts.
Prior to allowing your children to enjoy social media sites created for them, 
set rules for your family specifically regarding parent access to your chil­
dren’s online accounts. Include a section in your Digital Family Policy regard­
ing what your children are expected to share with you. Consider keeping a 
list of the following:
	
✓	Account names by site and child
	
✓	Account passwords by site and child
	
✓	Approved settings by site and child
	
Consider creating your own user account on sites that your children frequent 
so you have a better understanding of what they are experiencing online.
Creating Social Networking Rules
Because social media for children expands beyond simply social media web­
sites to include interactive functions on platforms such as gaming consoles, 
online worlds, and handheld games, it is important to create very specific 
rules regarding social networking in your Digital Family Policy. For each indi­
vidual platform, create rules about the following areas:

181
 Chapter 11: Introducing Social Networking for Children
	
✓	Parent access to accounts
	
✓	Sharing accounts among your children
	
✓	Days and times when kids are allowed to use social media
	
✓	Requirements regarding requesting permission before making changes 
to account settings
	
✓	Multiplayer game setting guidelines
	
✓	Instructions for when parents need to be notified of unwanted or inap­
propriate online contact
	
✓	Specific chat setting rules
	
Make these platform-by-platform and age group-by-age group guidelines clear 
to your children. Equally important, include associated consequences with 
each rule.

ocial networking — people interacting on digital platforms — has 
become the way lots of folks, from your child’s best friend to the Pope, 
interact in the twenty-first century. Facebook and Twitter are the two most 
popular social media sites.
Even though the vast majority of Facebook users are older than 25 and the 
average age of Twitter account holders is 37, many children and young adults 
view these platforms as their own — an appropriate place to interact with 
their friends as well as the brands and celebrities they love. Because neither 
site actively enforces a specific age restriction (more on that in a bit), the 
choice for when (or if) your children use either platform is in your hands.
This chapter provides you with a basic understanding of the two most widely 
used social media platforms to help shape your family’s social media policy. 
It is important for your kids to understand social media and potentially even 
participate as social media use becomes more commonplace within schools, 
activities, and even workplaces. Many teens also simply want social media 
accounts as a way to interact online with friends as well as the brands and 
celebrities they love. However, social media can also become highly addictive 
and a place for kids to encounter digital dangers, such as online predators. Set 
very clear guidelines within your Digital Family Policy (see Chapter 2) regard­
ing social media use.

184
Part III: Grasping Social Media’s Effect on Your Family 
Understanding Facebook
Facebook is a social networking platform on which users can connect with 
friends and family online to share everything from what they’re doing in 
that moment to photo albums from a recent family vacation. Users not only 
use Facebook to connect with friends and family, but they also interact with 
favorite brands, celebrities, and other users with similar interests.
Even though Facebook is a social network used by one-half of the U.S. popula­
tion (according to Facebook itself), you might want to implement a variety of 
privacy settings for your child’s account that aren’t necessarily as important 
for your personal page. Likewise, some general settings and guidelines might 
be helpful when discussing your family’s Facebook policies.
At times, it may seem as though Facebook has its own language. Some basic 
terms to understand include
	
✓	News Feed: The list of updates posted by members of your Friends list 
or brand pages you have chosen to “Like.”
	
✓	Like: How you indicate that you have enjoyed a status update from a 
Friend and also the way you connect with brand and celebrity pages.
	
✓	Pages: Accounts held by brands, companies, and celebrities rather than 
individual users.
	
✓	Profile pages: Accounts held by individual users.
	
✓	Timeline: The collection of all the information you have shared on your 
Facebook profile, including status updates and images.
	
✓	Status updates: Information posted by individual account holders. 
These status updates appear in the News Feeds of Friends.
	
✓	Wall: The main page of the account holder’s profile or page. Friends can 
post to each other’s Walls.
	
✓	Group: How Facebook users with similar interests can interact in a vir­
tual room with the ability to share information, documents, and pictures 
visible only to other group members.
	
✓	Messages: How Facebook users interact privately. When both users are 
online at the same time, the messages platform may appear as an instant 
message format. When a user is not available, the message platform 
appears more like e-mail.
Knowing the recommended user age
The Facebook Terms of Service (TOS) lay out a variety of rules and regu­
lations for the site covering everything from appropriate uses for status 

185
 Chapter 12: Helping Kids Use Adult Social Networks
updates to rules for cover photos. One regulation is the recommended user 
age. Any new user creating an account has to declare being age 13 or older. 
Some parents allow their children to create a personal account before age 
13, but if you do, you’re breaking the Facebook user agreement, which may 
result in that page and its content being removed from Facebook.
	
To view the complete Facebook TOS, visit www.facebook.com/legal/terms.
Providing Profile information
Although you (or your child) can edit personal information on a Facebook 
account at any time, most information is collected while you’re creating the 
account. After a Facebook account has been created, this information becomes 
that user’s “Profile.” Discuss with your children which personal information 
should and should not be shared via a Facebook Profile prior to creating their 
accounts.
You must have an e-mail address in order to create a Facebook account. 
Here’s how to create a Profile on Facebook:
	
1.	Visit www.facebook.com, provide the following basic information 
(which can be hidden from public view later), and select a password 
(see Figure 12-1):
 
• First name
 
• Last name
 
• E-mail address
 
• Gender
 
• Birthday
	
2.	 (Optional) Allow Facebook to access the account holder’s e-mail 
accounts to find friends who are already on Facebook.
	
	 You don’t have to allow Facebook access to e-mail address books. 
Allowing access can help you start locating other Friends on Facebook, 
but there are other ways to find people you know if you’d prefer to 
skip this step.
	
3.	 (Optional) Provide the following optional information to connect with 
past/current classmates and co-workers:
 
• High School
 
• College/University
 
• Employer
	
4.	Upload a profile picture, which I discuss in Chapter 4.

After you complete these steps (see Figure 12-2), you will be prompted to edit 
the general account settings: username, e-mail address, password, school 
or work networks, and language settings. You can also set security settings, 
choose how to receive notifications for each Facebook feature, and decide 
whether to allow subscribers to your page.
	
Figure 12-2:

187
 Chapter 12: Helping Kids Use Adult Social Networks
	
Allowing subscribers permits non-Friends to receive your child’s public posts 
in their News Feed without adding your child as a Friend. For safety’s sake, I 
would strongly recommend that your child’s account not allow subscribers.
On the About page of your account, you also have the option to add a contact 
phone number under the Contact Information heading. This isn’t required, 
though, and not all users opt to provide this. I recommend not including a 
phone number in the contact information of a teen’s account.
Sharing personal information
To select the information to share on a Facebook Profile, you edit the About 
page by clicking the About heading on your Profile page (see Figure 12-3). 
On this page, you can add your education, work history, hometown, current 
town, relationship status, and a paragraph telling other users a bit about you.
To select other personal information to display on your Profile, click the 
Basic Info section’s Edit button (refer to Figure 12-3). Here, you can choose 
whether your gender and birthday are shown on the Profile. You can also 
indicate such preferences as religion and political affiliations.
From the About page’s Contact Info section, you can edit your contact infor­
mation, including your phone number, address, and instant messaging (IM) 
screen names.

Part III: Grasping Social Media’s Effect on Your Family 
Selecting your audience
The fastest and easiest way to control what users see of you in their News 
Feed is the Audience Selector button (shown in Figure 12-4). Using this 
button lets you choose who can see each one of your actions, such as a 
status update or the posting of a photo, while you’re performing the action.
For example, your children can choose who can view a particular photo 
album. They might also choose to allow content on their Timeline to be seen 
only by specifically created Groups (think distribution lists), such as close 
friends or family members. I discuss Groups in the upcoming “Participating in 
Facebook Groups” section.
	
Encourage your children to use the audience selector for each of their 
Facebook actions to ensure increased privacy for some photos and updates 
while still allowing less private options for basic updates.
If your children change the audience for an individual action, they may need 
to use the audience selector in their next update to restore settings to what 
was initially selected.

Customizing privacy settings
Facebook privacy settings provide a way to manage what information you 
share via your Facebook account. You use the Privacy Settings page to select 
preferences for your entire account. Simply click the Edit Account drop-down 
arrow in the upper-right corner of any Facebook page and choose Privacy 
Settings, as shown in Figure 12-5.
The Privacy Settings and Tools page shows all the general privacy settings 
for your Facebook account. Your Profile’s default privacy setting applies to 
status updates and photos posted to your Timeline. 
You have five options for your account’s general privacy setting (affecting all 
future posts), as shown in Figure 12-6:
	
✓	Public
	
✓	Friends
	
✓	Friends except Acquaintances
	
✓	Only Me
	
✓	Custom
	
	Use this setting to create a customized list, excluding specific friends.
You can also choose to only share future posts with lists you have created, 
such as Close Friends and Family.

past posts, click the Limit Past Posts link next to Limit the Audience for Posts 
You’ve Shared with Friends of Friends or Public? on your Privacy Settings

that appears (see Figure 12-8), your past content on your Timeline that is 
available to Friends of Friends, public, or a specific set of restricted Friends 
changes to Friends only.

The default setting for who can look you up using the e-mail address or 
phone number you provided is Everyone. Click Edit to choose from the two 
additional options (as shown in Figure 12-9):
	
✓	Only Friends of Friends
	
✓	Only Friends

You may also edit whether search engines can link to your Timeline. Keeping 
this feature on allows people to search for your Facebook profile via non-
Facebook search engines (such as Bing and Google). The version of your 
Facebook Timeline that will appear in search results includes only the parts 
of your Profile that you have made public. Some people prefer to keep this 
setting on so that it is easier for friends to locate their Facebook profiles.

Selecting Timeline and tagging settings
To select what happens when Friends tag you or your content, or post on 
your Timeline, you click Timeline and Tagging on the left sidebar of your 
Privacy Settings page. The Timeline and Tagging page (see Figure 12-10) 
appears, and you can customize the following settings:
	
✓	Who can post on your Timeline
	
✓	Whether you require the ability to review posts from Friends that tag 
you before they can appear on your Timeline
	
✓	Who can see what others post on your Timeline
	
✓	Who can see posts you’ve been tagged in on your Timeline
	
✓	Whether to review tags Friends add to your own posts on Facebook
	
✓	Who is added to the audience of posts you’ve been tagged in (such as 
your Friends if they are not already part of that post’s audience)
	
✓	Who sees tag suggestions when photos that look like you are uploaded
You can also use this page to preview what your Timeline looks like to people 
who are not your Friends.
	
Even if your children do not choose to review photo tags on photos in which 
they appear, they may still choose to remove tags from those photos after 
they have been tagged.
The name, profile picture, gender, networks, username and user ID of all 
Facebook account holders are always publicly available. This also means that 
this information is available to applications; therefore, any information you 
have chosen to make public is available to apps.

 Chapter 12: Helping Kids Use Adult Social Networks
Considering creating a family page
A great option for families interested in using the social networking platform 
that Facebook offers is creating a family page. Many users creatively use the 
name fields on the account sign-up page to indicate that this account rep­
resents every member of the family. For example, were I to create a family 
page, I might insert “TheBair” as the first name and “Family” as the last name 
for the account.
There are a variety of things to consider should you choose to take this route 
when engaging as a family on Facebook. Your family will need to create rules 
regarding the following:
	
✓	Who is allowed to post mobile photos and when
	
✓	Who is able to create photo albums
	
✓	Privacy settings
	
✓	Selection of Friends
	
	Will you allow friends of each parent, friends of each child, or just 
people that the entire family knows?
	
✓	Participation in groups
	
✓	Apps and games
	
✓	Who can update the account status
	
✓	What can be posted on the Wall and by whom
All these rules and decisions should be discussed prior to the creation of the 
account and presented in the Digital Family Policy.
	
Use the permalink displayed at the bottom of Facebook photo albums to share 
your family photo albums with non-Facebook users and Facebook account 
holders who are not Friends with your account.
Engaging with companies and brands
Many brands and companies use Facebook to connect with their online 
consumer audience. This includes many of the brands and companies your 
children recognize and enjoy. One way that Facebook account holders 
show appreciation for a favorite brand is by clicking the Like button on that 
brand’s page (see Figure 12-13).

196
Part III: Grasping Social Media’s Effect on Your Family 
	
Figure 12-13: 
Facebook 
brand page 
Like button.
	
After a Facebook user clicks the Like button on a page, the following happens:
	
✓	A story about your Like will appear in your Timeline and may, therefore, 
also appear in your News Feed.
	
✓	Your name and profile photo may be displayed on that page.
	
✓	Your name and profile photo may appear in advertisements about that 
page.
	
✓	You have granted permission for that page’s updates to appear in your 
News Feed and for that page to send you messages.
While clicking Like on a Friend’s content simply shows others your approval or 
enjoyment of that content, clicking Like on a brand page creates a connection 
between your account and that page. However, “liking” a page does not provide 
that page with access to your Timeline, only your profile picture and name.
Although you can view Facebook brand pages without first liking the page, 
many brands use the Like button as a gateway to participate in contests, 
receive special offers, and learn about company announcements before that 
information is made available to the general public.
It is natural for kids to want to connect with their favorite brands and celebri­
ties through their Facebook accounts, but at the same time, it’s important for 
them to understand how clicking the Like button affects their account. Discuss 
with your children the ramifications of choosing to Like a brand or celebrity on 
Facebook, including any concerns regarding privacy. Be sure to include rules 
regarding the Liking of brand pages when creating your Digital Family Policy.

197
 Chapter 12: Helping Kids Use Adult Social Networks
Participating in Facebook Groups
The Groups feature on Facebook allows users to create a private space in 
which members can share updates, images, documents, and more. After a 
user has created a Group, they may add Friends to that Group without their 
permission or request. Many organizations, clubs, sports teams, families, and 
professional organizations use Facebook Groups as a way to stay connected 
and share information related to the Group.
Facebook Groups can be a wonderful place for you and your family to inter­
act with local groups, clubs, and even class groups. They can be a way for 
fellow students to share class information and for sports teams to share 
practice schedules, but they can also make your child’s account more public 
than you initially chose when creating the account.
Groups provide your child with a platform to interact on Facebook with non-
Friends. However, non-Friends who are in the same group as your children 
can’t see information on your child’s Timeline that her privacy settings pro­
hibits from being seen by non-Friends. Also, blocked members who are in the 
same Group as your children will not be seen in the Group member’s list, nor 
will the content generated by that person be seen.
	
Creating a Facebook Group? Consider reaching out to potential members to ask 
their permission before adding them to your Group. It’s a great way to start your 
Group off on a respectful foot.
Group creators select one of the following privacy settings:
	
✓	Secret: Facebook Groups categorized as secret are visible only to 
members of the Group. Other users may not see the Group name, the 
Group members, or the Group content. This type of Group protects the 
privacy of Group members the most. If your teens are part of Secret 
Facebook Groups associated with teams and after-school activities, 
ask to be added as a Group member as well in order to see the Group’s 
activity.
	
✓	Closed: Closed Facebook Groups are visible to the public as is the list of 
Group members. Group content, however, is only viewable by the mem­
bers of the Group.
	
✓	Open: These Groups are visible by anyone. This means that the Group, 
the member list, and the content posted within the Group is all visible to 
nonmembers as well as members.
Facebook Group administrators who are Friends with you on Facebook may 
add you to a Group without first requesting your permission or approval. If a 
Friend adds you to a Facebook Group, you will receive a notification. This will 
also cause stories from the group to appear in your news feed.

198
Part III: Grasping Social Media’s Effect on Your Family 
Consider including a rule in your Digital Family Policy regarding participation 
in Groups. Facebook Groups connect users with a range of people beyond 
their Facebook “Friends,” which may concern some parents. If your teens 
want to join Groups for clubs or other activities, joining the Group from your 
own account as well allows you to monitor the activity within that Group.
Because users may add Friends to a Facebook Group without their permission, 
your teens may find the need to remove themselves from Groups in which they 
do not wish to belong. To leave a Facebook Group, go to the Group page and 
click Leave Group in the upper-right corner. (See Figure 12-14.) If you choose to 
leave a Group, no one within that Group can re-add you unless you request to 
be re-added.
	
Figure 12-14: 
How to 
leave a 
Facebook 
Group.
	
	
You can’t prevent your children’s friends from adding your child to a Facebook 
Group, but they cannot re-add your children without their request after your 
child has left the Group.
Allowing applications to 
access your information
When creating the Facebook portion of your Digital Family Policy, consider 
the effect that the use of Facebook applications will have on the privacy of 
your account information. Apps include popular games (such as FarmVille) 
as well as popular quiz-taking and cause-sharing apps, for example. The use 
of applications is a favorite feature of many Facebook users, including teens, 
but will affect who has access to the information on your child’s Facebook 
account. Also stipulate in your family’s policy whether children need to 
request parental permission for each individual app before granting that 
application access to the account.
Applications are used by Facebook account holders for anything from gaming to 
reading the news via your Profile page. When you install an app, you’re granting 
it permission to access your public information. Earlier in this chapter, I walk 
you through selecting what information to make public and keep private. This 
request for information is shown in Figure 12-15 and may include such informa­
tion as your name, profile picture, e-mail address, and birthday.

199
 Chapter 12: Helping Kids Use Adult Social Networks
	
Figure 12-15: 
Application

You may also be allowing the application access to additional information 
so that it may post updates on your behalf and allow other users of the app 
to see your notifications. The additional information requested generally 
appears during the application’s install. (See Figure 12-16.)

Account holders may choose to remove permission for an application to 
access their account information even after they have granted the app permis­
sion. If you’re helping your teen update their account settings to create a more 
private account, you may want to encourage them to change these permission 
settings. To restrict an application from accessing your information after you 
chose to allow access, click the Edit Account drop-down arrow in the upper-
right corner of any Facebook page and choose Account Settings. Then click 
Apps in the left sidebar to visit the App Settings page (shown in Figure 12-17), 
where you can edit an application’s settings or delete an application.

By clicking Edit next to an application on the App Settings page, you discover 
the following:
	
✓	Last date logged in to the app
	
✓	Information the app needs to access
	
✓	Last data accessed
	
✓	Who can see posts the app makes on your Facebook Timeline
	
✓	When the app is permitted to send you a notification
You may wish to change some permission settings as a matter of conve­
nience. Many Facebook users simply don’t want to receive frequent notifica­
tions from the apps that they use. Other permission settings are a matter of 
privacy, such as having access to your e-mail address and Friends list.
When covering Facebook rules in your Digital Family Policy, include whether 
you will have access to your children’s Facebook accounts. At the very least, 
I strongly suggest that you require your teens to “Friend” your Facebook 
account. You may also require your children to provide you with their 
Facebook username and password in order to monitor their activity and 
protect their safety. The actions that teens take on Facebook today will affect 
them for years into the future (including college admission and employment) 
because of their digital footprints (as discussed in Chapter 3).

201
 Chapter 12: Helping Kids Use Adult Social Networks
If you or your teen are experiencing abusive behavior on Facebook — such as 
hateful or slanderous speech — you can report this behavior:
	
1.	Click the gear menu next to the item you wish to report to Facebook.

Understanding Twitter
With more than 100 million active accounts, Twitter is the second largest 
social media platform today. Considered a micro-blogging platform, Twitter 
users post updates limited to only 140 characters. These updates can include 
links, photographs, and even video. Used by businesses to connect with con­
sumers, celebrities to chat with their fans, and the average American to share 
everything from what they’re eating for lunch to their most personal hopes 
and dreams, Twitter is a social media powerhouse with nothing but growth 
on the horizon.
Although Twitter doesn’t currently require users to meet an age restriction, 
the platform isn’t appropriate for children. Many teens, however, use the 
account daily, and for parents with social media–savvy teens, Twitter can 
also feel like a strange new world where users speak in hashtags and snippets 
of thought only 140 characters long. Many teens use Twitter to share any­
thing from how they feel about the football game they’re watching to what 
they’re eating for lunch. For some users, Twitter can be terribly addicting, 
and for many teens, Twitter offers the potential for oversharing. This section 
will walk you through the Twitter basics for when your teen begins to tweet 
or when you decide to join Twitter yourself.

202
Part III: Grasping Social Media’s Effect on Your Family 
Selecting a protected or a public account
All you need to create a Twitter account is an e-mail address and an account 
name not currently in use. To create a new account, simply visit https://
twitter.com and follow these steps:
	
1.	Provide your e-mail address and preferred username.
	
2.	Agree to the Terms of Service (TOS).
	
3.	Read through a brief Twitter tutorial covering the basics of creating 
Twitter status updates — “tweeting.”
	
4.	(Optional) Select accounts to “follow.”
	
	 Following an account on Twitter means that the updates generated by 
those accounts will appear in your Twitter timeline. (See Figure 12-18.)
	
5.	Select a profile image and account description. 
You can now tweet from your account although you can choose additional 
settings. One option is Tweet Privacy, and this selection allows you to pro­
tect your tweets. (See Figure 12-19.)
	
If you change a Twitter account from public to protected, all tweets sent prior 
to the change will still be public and searchable.

Choosing to protect your account’s tweets also affects your account in the 
following ways:
	
✓	Other account holders won’t be able to resend your tweets through 
their account via a tool called a “retweet.”
	
✓	Permanent links to your tweets will be viewable only to account holders 
who you have approved to follow your tweets.
	
✓	Your tweets won’t appear in either a Google search or a Twitter search.
	
✓	You won’t be able to tweet to people who haven’t chosen to follow you 
because your tweets aren’t visible to them.
The option to create a Twitter account with protected tweets is useful for 
families who want to allow family members to tweet with a selected group of 
friends or family without those tweets being viewed by the public. Be sure 
to consider this option when referencing the use of Twitter in your Digital 
Family Policy. Also discuss the selection of accounts to follow because the 
content tweeted by some accounts may not be suitable for all ages.
Public tweets versus private direct messages
When you send an update — a tweet — from an unprotected account, that mes­
sage is visible to anyone who chooses to see it. There is a way, however, for 
public accounts to send messages on Twitter that are visible to only one other 

204
Part III: Grasping Social Media’s Effect on Your Family 
person. (See Figure 12-20.) These private messages between two individuals are 
direct messages. Like public tweets, direct messages are limited to 140 charac­
ters per message. To send a direct message to a user, that user must be follow­
ing your account. Likewise, to receive a direct message from another user, you 
must be following that user’s account. Twitter users may opt for direct message 
notifications to be sent to them via e-mail or have direct messages delivered to 
your mobile phone via text. Keep in mind that text message rates will apply!
On the plus side, direct messages allow your teen to communicate with 
friends via Twitter without sharing information publicly. During the creation 
of your Digital Family Policy, discuss what types of information might be 
better suited for a direct message than a public tweet.
Follow these steps to send a direct message to another user:
	
1.	Click the person icon on the Twitter.com navigation bar.
	
2.	Select Direct Messages.
	
3.	Click New Message.
	
4.	Next to the egg image, type the name of the account you would like to 
message.
	
5.	Type your message of 140 characters or less into the message field.
	
6.	Choose Send Message.
	
Figure 12-20:

a direct 
message.
	

205
 Chapter 12: Helping Kids Use Adult Social Networks
	
To “follow” another Twitter account, go to that account profile and click the 
Follow button.
Navigating hashtagged conversations
Twitter began as a micro-blogging platform where users answered the question, 
“What are you doing?” but quickly developed into a social media site where 
users hold conversations. One way that these conversations are organized is 
with a hashtag.
By tweeting with the same hashtag — a # sign followed by a keyword — all 
tweets following the same topic are searchable (as shown in Figure 12-21). 
For example, a user might tweet, I can’t believe that call from 
the officials! #SuperBowl for their tweet to appear in searches of the 
#SuperBowl hashtag during the big game.
These tweets can then be located via hashtag conversation tools and other third-
party applications. Typically, these platforms format all tweets that contain the 
same hashtag in a scrolling conversation very much like an IM or chat room tool.
To participate in hashtagged conversations, simply add this tag to each of 
your tweets. You may wish to use a party platform, such as Tweetchat.com 
or Tweetgrid.com, to view all the other tweets associated with the chat. 
These events usually are facilitated by a host who may be asking conversa­
tional questions to drive the chat. Often, other participants will retweet the 
questions after the host has posted them.
	
Figure 12-21: 
One 
example 
of search-
ing Twitter 
using a 
hashtag.
	

206
Part III: Grasping Social Media’s Effect on Your Family 
	
A retweet is the reposting of someone else’s tweet so that it appears on your 
Twitter timeline.
During these topical conversations, participants are sometimes asked 
to answer trivia or view additional content on other platforms. Many 
hashtagged conversations are sponsored by a brand or company hoping to 
gain exposure for a new product or service. These chats also often include 
prize giveaways facilitated by the event host.
Although many events include an RSVP page on a blog or event landing page, 
they are typically open to anyone wishing to participate, and an advance 
RSVP is rarely required.
Participating in hashtagged conversations allows your teen to engage in con­
versations with account holders who do not follow that account and whose 
account your teen does not follow. Because of the effect that hashtagged con­
versations may have on your teen’s privacy, be sure to discuss your family’s 
policy regarding participation in these events.
Allowing access to third-party applications
Using Twitter.com is the main way to tweet, send direct messages, and 
search Twitter content, but many Twitter users choose instead to use Twitter 
via a variety of third-party applications, created and run by developers not 
associated with Twitter.com. These applications allow Twitter account hold­
ers to perform a variety of tasks not available on Twitter.com, such as sched­
uling tweets to be shared at a future date and time. They also allow users to 
organize how they receive tweets from the accounts they follow according to 
criteria not available on the actual Twitter platform.
	
Such third-party applications have been developed apart from Twitter.com 
and are not official Twitter.com apps. You must contact that app directly with 
any questions or concerns.
To use these third-party applications, you will grant each application per­
mission to access your Twitter account. Typically, you allow the application 
to access your account by clicking a button asking to connect to Twitter, 
and then you’re redirected to a Twitter website asking you to log in to your 
account and approve the application. Just like the Facebook applications that 
I discuss earlier, this permission screen asks the exact permissions you’re 
granting to this application. (See Figure 12-22.) The items listed in green are 
the permissions you are allowing. Items listed in red are the permissions you 
are not allowing. To connect to the app, click Authorize App.

207

To review the applications that you connected to your Twitter account, visit 
the Apps tab of your account settings. (See Figure 12-23.) You may remove 
permissions granted to an application at any time by clicking the Revoke 
Access button next to the application.
Using third-party applications to access Twitter is very common. Discuss as a 
family what it means to allow a third-party application access to your Twitter 
account, and consider creating a list of most trusted third-party apps to keep 
in your Digital Family Policy’s social media section.

Part III: Grasping Social Media’s Effect on Your Family 
Discussing giveaways and contests
Many brands, bloggers, and other organizations use the Twitter platform as a 
place to hold giveaways and contests. There is currently no minimum age for 
Twitter account holders, but that does not mean that every giveaway hosted 
on Twitter is open to all ages or even residents of every state or country. To 
avoid wasted time, disappointment, and even legal hassles, parents of teens 
who tweet may wish to set ground rules for participation in sweepstakes on 
Twitter.
The majority of the contests held on Twitter have no actual affiliation 
to Twitter.com. Although the Facebook platform is highly regulated by 
Facebook with very strict guidelines for sweepstakes, Twitter has taken a 
much more laissez-faire approach to this issue. Contests on Twitter are regu­
lated at the discretion and the supervision of the giveaway sponsor only.
To determine the rules of the sweepstakes, visit the Twitter account being 
used to implement the giveaway. Look for links to contest rules or posts 
advertising the contest to determine the following:
	
✓	Giveaway sponsor
	
✓	Complete list and value of prizes
	
✓	Age requirements
	
✓	Residency requirements
	
✓	Steps required to enter to win
	
✓	Any costs associated with receiving the prize
Most giveaways are available to users who are 18 years of age or older, and 
many are open to U.S. residents only. Beware of contests that require you to 
provide personal information prior to winning or that ask you to pay sales 
tax and shipping on the prizes.

A

ccording to YouTube, an hour of video is uploaded to YouTube each 
second of the day, and more than 800 million unique users visit YouTube 
monthly. Additionally, more than 21 million teens are on YouTube. Users at 
this video-sharing website can find everything from their favorite song to 
how-to videos. With the ability to share and view YouTube videos via Facebook 
and Twitter, many families also use YouTube to share memorable moments 
with friends and family.
Subsequently, YouTube posts millions of videos with content that may be 
enjoyable to children, from videos of favorite theme park rides to kid-friendly 
events to class science projects. Just as children turn to search engines to 
find information, many also turn to YouTube to learn about a topic or to 
check out the latest viral videos.
Additionally, anyone with a YouTube account in good standing can upload 
video content to their account. Therefore, YouTube can be a fantastic 
creative outlet for budding filmmakers, musicians, and video bloggers.
Taking the time to understand the benefits and potential pitfalls of 
YouTube will help you guide your children as viewers and content creators. 
Understanding YouTube’s filters and privacy settings can help you minimize 

210
Part III: Grasping Social Media’s Effect on Your Family 
encountering content that, by many parents’ standards, isn’t very suitable 
for children. For example, videos with violent content and inappropriate lan­
guage are common. Despite YouTube regulations, videos with highly sexual 
content are also commonplace and can be difficult to avoid.
Starting with a Google Account
You don’t need a YouTube account to search and view videos. But, because 
YouTube is owned by Google, you need a (free) Google account before you 
can create a YouTube account. Benefits of creating a YouTube account 
include being able to create a personalized channel guide as well as being 
able to upload video content and access search filters.
If you already have a Google account, simply go to www.youtube.com to 
sign in and begin customizing your experience.
	
According to Google Terms of Service, account holders in the United States 
must be at least 13 years old.
To grab a Google account
	
1.	Go to https://accounts.google.com/SignUp (see Figure 13-1).
	
2.	Provide Google with the following information:
 
• First and last name
 
• Selected username
 
• Created password
 
• Birthday
 
• Gender
 
• Current e-mail address
 
• Country location
	
3.	Complete a verification password.
	
4.	Agree to the Google Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.
	
Google will ask you for a mobile phone number, but feel free to skip this field. 
You do need an e-mail account, though.

You can also personalize your public profile with a profile photo.
Signing In to YouTube
After creating your Google account, access YouTube by selecting YouTube 
from the Google navigation bar at the top of your screen. (See Figure 13-2.)
Click the upper-right Sign-In button (see Figure 13-3), provide your Google 
e-mail address and password on the page that appears, and click Sign In.
After you sign in to your YouTube account, you can subscribe to favorite 
channels, personalize your search settings, and upload content. A YouTube 
channel is simply a page containing all the videos uploaded by one YouTube 
account holder. YouTube will also suggest content based on past searches 
as well as the channels to which you subscribe. You can also opt to connect 
other social accounts to your YouTube account. Connecting social media 
accounts (such as Facebook) allows you to share your YouTube activity with 
Friends and followers.

Now is also a good time to sit down with your teens and read the YouTube 
Community Guidelines found at
www.youtube.com/t/community_guidelines
Your teens have to agree to follow these content guidelines to upload content 
to YouTube. Copyright violations are prohibited on YouTube, so be sure to 
explain copyright basics.
	
YouTube users are not allowed to upload content that they have not created 
or been given express permission to upload. This also means that teens may 
not use music in their videos that they did not create themselves or pay for 
permission to use. More information on YouTube copyright rules can be 
found at
www.youtube.com/t/howto_copyright
Customizing Your YouTube 
Settings for Safety
One of the main reasons to create a YouTube channel is to gain access to 
customized settings, which determine the privacy level of your profile infor­
mation and your YouTube channel’s content. These settings not only affect 
any videos uploaded by you or your teen to the account, but also affect 
the video searches conducted via that account. This provides you with the 
opportunity to filter what your children see when watching content 
on YouTube.
	
YouTube settings should be a critical piece of your Digital Family Policy 
regarding video sharing.
Editing your profile
You can change your YouTube channel settings to edit what personal informa­
tion about the channel’s content provider appears to the public when videos 
uploaded by that account are viewed. You can use this setting to keep the 

214
Part III: Grasping Social Media’s Effect on Your Family 
public from knowing that a channel is owned by a teenager, for example. 
By default, the age of the account holder appears on the channel while video 
posted on that channel is viewed. In fact, other YouTube users can see the 
age of an account holder even before that account holder has uploaded 
content.
To edit these settings
	
1.	Click the down arrow next to your account name (upper right) and 
then click the My Channel link below the YouTube heading. (See 
Figure 13-4.)
	
2.	On the profile page that appears, click the Edit button to the right of 
your username. (See Figure 13-5.)
	
3.	Under the Created By section, you can hide specific account holder 
information by clicking the Hide link next to that information (see 
Figure 13-6).
	
4.	After you update your channel’s profile information, click Apply to 
accept the changes (or click Cancel if you change your mind).

Selecting what actions to share
YouTube account holders can connect their YouTube account to their Orkut, 
Facebook, and Twitter social media accounts. If you choose to connect your 
YouTube account to a social media site, updates regarding your YouTube 
activity are sent automatically to the social network. You will likely want to 

216
Part III: Grasping Social Media’s Effect on Your Family 
customize these settings to maintain privacy. If, on the other hand, you want 
to share your YouTube activity with social media contacts, these settings 
may provide useful to you.
To connect your YouTube account and select the Sharing settings
	
1.	Click the down arrow next to your account name (upper right) and 
then click the YouTube Settings link below the YouTube heading. 
(Refer to Figure 13-4.)
	
2.	On the Account Settings page that appears, select Sharing in the left 
sidebar, as shown in Figure 13-7.
	
3.	Click the Connect button next to the social media account you want 
linked to your YouTube account.
	
4.	In the Share Your Activity section, select how YouTube shares your 
YouTube actions on YouTube and your connected accounts (such as 
Orkut, Twitter, and Facebook).
	
	 Select the check boxes for the actions you want to share. Such actions 
include uploading a video, adding a video to a playlist, marking a video 
as a favorite, liking a video, commenting on a video, and subscribing to a 
channel.
	
Figure 13-7:

actions.
	

217
 Chapter 13: Searching and Sharing Safely on YouTube
	
	 Some actions are selected by default already; deselect those actions 
that you don’t want to share via YouTube or a connected social media 
site.
	
5.	After you finish your selections, click Save.
When helping your teens select these settings, discuss factors such as how 
frequently they take each action on their YouTube account and how they 
use the other social media platforms. Will they be sharing YouTube actions 
with an audience of friends and family who may feel inundated by frequent 
updates? Is the YouTube account your child’s account, but the Facebook 
account is for the entire family? Answering these questions might help you 
form your Digital Family Policy.
Protecting yourself with 
privacy settings
Like other social networking sites, YouTube allows users to connect to 
other users through features such as comments and private messages. 
You may wish to create a YouTube account for your family or children 
to access personalization settings. You may not, however, wish to be con­
tacted by the public through your YouTube account. YouTube privacy 
settings allow you to decide not only how the public interacts with your 
account, but also how YouTube itself accesses and shares your account 
information.
Here’s how to change the privacy settings on your YouTube account:
	
1.	Click the down arrow next to your account name (upper right) and 
then click the YouTube Settings link below the YouTube heading. 
(Refer to Figure 13-4.)
	
2.	On the Account Settings page that appears, select Privacy in the left 
sidebar, as shown in Figure 13-8.
	
	 Here you can set the following privacy settings for your account:
 
• Search and Contacts: Set whether contacts can send you messages 
and share videos and whether people can find your channel if they 
have your e-mail address.
 
• Ads Based on My Interest: Elect whether YouTube can use your 
information to send you ads that Google believes relevant to 
your interests.

218
Part III: Grasping Social Media’s Effect on Your Family 
 
• Statistics and Data: Decide whether YouTube can share statistics 
and data about your videos publicly. For example, do you want 
the public to be able to see how many people have viewed 
your videos? Do you want the public to see the comments 
on your videos?
	
3.	After you finish your selections, click Save.
	
Figure 13-8:

Using Content Filters
Because YouTube hosts a seemingly unlimited variety of video content, 
take advantage of the parental control option, which sports multiple 
features parents can use to protect their children from inappropriate 
content.
	
After a video is viewed on YouTube, a screen appears with recommended 
and related content that YouTube suggests you may want to view next. 
Parents should discuss with their kids that these images will appear without 
prompting.
The YouTube Safety Mode provides the following features:
	
✓	Hides videos with potentially objectionable material
	
✓	Hides comments on videos unless you elect to show comments
	
✓	Replaces most inappropriate language in comments with stars

219
 Chapter 13: Searching and Sharing Safely on YouTube
To implement Safety Mode, take the following steps:
	
1.	Go to www.youtube.com, scroll to the bottom of the page, and click 
the Safety drop-down arrow (see Figure 13-9).
	
Figure 13-9: 
The Safety 
Mode option

2.	In the Choose Your Safety Mode drop-down window that appears, 
select the On radio button.
	
	 The Safety Mode Lock check box appears.
	
3.	Select the Lock Safety Mode on This Browser check box (see 
Figure 13-10).
	
	 With Safety Mode enabled, you can also lock Safety Mode for the 
browser you’re currently in. Locking Safety Mode on a browser means 
that even if you sign out of your Google account, YouTube will remain in 
Safety Mode when accessed through that browser.
	
Figure 13-10:

4.	Click the Save button.
	
	 If your family uses multiple web browsers, be sure to repeat the locking 
process on each one.

220
Part III: Grasping Social Media’s Effect on Your Family 
If you’ve set YouTube content filters but still don’t feel comfortable allow­
ing your children and teens to search for YouTube content without parental 
supervision, consider screening content prior to showing it to your children. 
After you deem the content appropriate, allow your children to view the 
video with supervision. Be prepared that at the end of the video, though, 
suggested content thumbnails will appear.
	
If your children are permitted to view only prescreened YouTube content, 
with adult supervision, be sure to include this stipulation in your Digital 
Family Policy.
Public versus Private Videos 
on YouTube
When you upload a video to YouTube, you have the option to make the video 
private or public. Public videos can be viewed by anyone searching for content 
on YouTube. Electing to make a video private does not mean that the video 
cannot be shared, though. When a video is private, it
	
✓	Does not appear on your YouTube channel
	
✓	Is not listed in search results
	
✓	Can be shared with up to 50 invited viewers
	
✓	Does not appear in playlists
	
YouTube users may share private videos only with other YouTube account 
holders.
To share a private video, take the following steps:
	
1.	Sign in to your YouTube account (www.youtube.com).
	
2.	Click the down arrow next to your account name (upper right).
	
3.	Click the Video Manager link (refer to Figure 13-4).
	
4.	Select Uploads in the left sidebar.
	
5.	Choose the video you want to share and then click the Edit button 
(see Figure 13-11).

221

Another privacy option for YouTube content is the Unlisted setting. Unlisted 
is different from Private in the following ways:
	
✓	Users don’t need a YouTube account to watch the video.
	
✓	You can share the video with more than 50 people.
To change the privacy setting of your YouTube video to Unlisted, follow 
the preceding steps — but, on the Basic Info tab for your video, select the 
Unlisted privacy setting. (See Figure 13-13.)
	
Figure 13-13:

In addition to selecting privacy settings for individual videos, you can also 
change your YouTube account’s default privacy setting for uploaded videos.
	
1.	Go to www.youtube.com and sign in to your account.
	
2.	Click the down arrow next to your account name (upper right) and

Blogging, Creating, and Conducting 
Business Online for Kids
In This Chapter
▶	Choosing whether your kids should blog
▶	Facilitating your child’s blog
▶	Discussing potential safety issues
▶	Participating in blogging communities
▶	Exploring kids’ entrepreneurship online opportunities
T

hanks to technology, one of the most amazing aspects of raising children 
in this digital age is the vast number of opportunities for kids. Kids looking 
for a creative outlet online may develop an interest in blogging, which could 
open doors for them to become web publishers, creating original content and 
sharing it with the world. If you decide this path could be a positive and fruitful 
outlet for your child, take care to protect their safety while they venture into 
the world of online publishing. This chapter shows you how to manage both.
Helping Your Kids Decide 
Whether to Blog
Before your child decides whether to launch a blog, consider the following:
Pros
 
• Blogging can be fun.
 
• Blogging provides a creative outlet.
 
• Blogs can be created for little to no cost.
 
• Blogging can help your child create a positive digital footprint.

226
Part III: Grasping Social Media’s Effect on Your Family 
Cons
 
• Blogging can become incredibly time-consuming.
 
• Blogging places your child in the public eye.
 
• Blogs can become very expensive.
Help guide your children through this decision process so that should they 
decide to blog, that decision will have been thoughtfully made.
Talking about their motivation
Understanding your child’s motivation for launching a blog may help you 
decide whether to encourage their blogging. Regardless of what their motiva­
tion reason(s), help them clarify why they believe they should blog.
Here are some of the main reasons why kids elect to launch a blog:
	
✓	Extension of their online profiles: Most teenagers and many younger 
children have online profiles through some social media venue. Kids 
age 13 and older may participate in popular social media platforms 
(Facebook and Twitter), and many children also hold accounts on vari­
ous social media sites created for children, such as those I discuss in 
Chapters 11 and 21. For these digitally savvy kids, a blog may feel like 
the natural next step in developing the online profile that they share 
with friends and followers.
	
✓	Writing portfolio: For the child who enjoys writing, a blog is a way to 
create an online writing portfolio, which they can share with anyone 
with just a click of the mouse.
	
✓	Creative outlet: Children typically enjoy creating and telling original 
stories, and many kids also enjoy journaling in a diary. Blogging allows 
the digitally connected child to create these stories and journal entries 
online in posts rather than simply in a notebook at home.
	
	As I discuss in Chapter 3, kids need to be aware of the potential dangers 
of oversharing online.
	
✓	Class assignment: Today’s students in a digitally connected education 
system often receive blog post–creation assignments in addition to stan­
dard writing assignments. These projects often involve contributing to 
a classroom blog (not creating individual blogs) although some schools 
teach, facilitate, and monitor the creation of individual student blogs. In 
Chapter 18, I talk about digitally connected schools in more depth.
	
✓	Group blogging: Just as adult bloggers now often write as part of a 
larger collective site — a multi-author blog (MAB) — group blogs with 
teen authors are appearing. Read more about blogging communities 
later in this chapter.

227
 Chapter 14: Blogging, Creating, and Conducting Business Online for Kids
	
✓	Creating of a fan site: For some kids, blogs are an outlet to show their 
support of a particular sports star or celebrity. Acting like virtual walls 
covered in celebrity posters, fan blogs often include updates from 
concerts, snippets of news taken from celebrity gossip magazines, and 
images from around the web.
	
✓	Creating a positive digital footprint: As I discuss in Chapter 3, many 
colleges and employers now include a search of a teen’s digital foot­
print in the decision-making process before offering a job or admission. 
Creating a blog with a place to show not only writing skills but also work 
and volunteer experience is one way kids can take control of their digital 
footprint and showcase positive aspects of their lives.
Looking at time commitments
A blog can require fairly little time beyond the initial creation period, but 
blogs can also become incredibly time consuming with options for custom­
ization, frequent posting, and community participation. When helping your 
child determine whether to blog, consider the following basic aspects of blog­
ging and how they affect the time commitment required of bloggers.
Blog creation
Blog creation can be as simple as selecting a name and opening a free blog 
account by using a standard, provided blog template.
However, if your teen child wants to own her own URL (Uniform Resource 
Locator), or website address, rather than simply having a blog on a free 
platform, that means more time to purchase that URL, subscribe to a web-
hosting service, and then create their blog. The first route can easily be done 
in a weekend, but going for a URL can take weeks, depending on the skill and 
knowledge level of the child.
Blog customization
Simple templates can make blogging an activity that requires little time. If your 
child begins to customize both the look and functionality of his blog, though, 
that time commitment may increase dramatically. Show your child the visual 
differences between a blog with little to no customization (see Figure 14-1) and 
one that has been personalized (see Figure 14-2). Your child might not want to 
really invest in time commitment and cost for the customized version.
Post creation
Some bloggers take hours to create a single post. Others write and publish 
posts in 20 minutes or less. Ask your child to think critically about the types 
of posts she would like to publish and how long it typically takes her to write 
those types of pieces. Then have your child consider how often she would like 
to post. Some bloggers post daily; others publish content only periodically.

ization might

customized

Post promotion
Although not a required component of blogging, post promotion is the best 
way to get readers to visit a blog and view the content. This may include 
sharing the link on social media (as shown in Figure 14-3), commenting and 
linking on other blogs, and sharing the post link within blog communities. 
Young authors looking to build their audience will want to include some time 
for post promotion.

Responding to comments
One of the most fulfilling aspects of publishing your writing online is receiving 
a response from your readers. Teen publishers who have engaged an audience 
and allowed this audience to comment on their writing will want to set aside 
some time periodically to respond to those comments, as shown in Figure 14-4.

Determining costs
Blogging — like most hobbies — can be expensive to begin and maintain. 
However, digitally savvy kids can enjoy online creativity entirely for free. To 
help determine (or avoid) blogging costs before supporting your budding digital 
author, look at some blogging basics: everything from creating a blog name to 
customizing your blog platform. When discussing your child’s motivation to 
begin blogging, also be sure to understand their expectations in order to help 
determine the costs associated with their blog:
	
✓	Subscribing to a hosting service: If your child chooses to blog on a free 
platform, the need to pay for a hosting service is eliminated. Some free 
platforms are Blogger and WordPress, which you can read about later in 
the section, “Understanding basics: From publishing to plug-ins.”
	
	For those blogging on their own platform with a unique domain name, a 
website hosting service is required. Hosting services are a recurring fee 
and typically cost between $3 and $5 per month. Read more about such 
services in the upcoming section, “Selecting a platform.”
	
✓	Purchasing a domain name: As I mention earlier in this chapter, if your 
child wants to obtain and own a unique website address, or URL (mine, 
for example, is www.resourcefulmommy.com), she needs to buy and reg­
ister that domain name through a service. Domain names are a recurring 
cost; they need to be renewed periodically. Read more about domain 
names in “Understanding basics: From publishing to plug-ins.”
	
✓	Procuring a site theme: After choosing a web host and optionally securing 
a domain name, your child needs to download a template, or theme, on 
which to create their blog. Thousands of free themes are available online, 
but paid themes typically range from $30 to $100. This is generally a 
one-time cost, though.
	
✓	Paying for images/graphics: Many bloggers use their own images 
(uploading photos they’ve taken) for their blog posts. You can purchase 
stock photography for a blog, though, and those photos range from a 
few dollars to several hundred dollars per image. You can even go as 
far as hiring a graphic artist to create an original blog logo or image, as 
shown in Figure 14-5.
	
Figure 14-5:

artist.
	

231
 Chapter 14: Blogging, Creating, and Conducting Business Online for Kids
	
✓	Hiring a site designer: A creative teen — who even isn’t particularly 
technically savvy — can create a basic blog. For a more complicated, 
self-hosted blog, you probably need the help of a site designer. The one-
time cost for the creation of a website can cost anywhere from a few 
hundred to a few thousand dollars, depending on the requirements and 
characteristics of the site.
	
✓	Purchasing additional blogging tools: As I discuss later in this chapter, 
blogs may contain an endless list of features, from virtual bookshelves to 
e-commerce store fronts. A young blogger who has made the decision 
to devote a great deal of time and effort to the craft may eventually 
wish to purchase additional tools for their site.
Facilitating Your Kids’ Blogging
Parents supporting their kids’ blogging goals should gain a basic understand­
ing of blogging to both guide their budding authors and also help protect 
their safety online. The following fundamentals provide everything you need 
to know to help your child get started in the blogging world.
Understanding basics: From 
publishing to plug-ins
The first step in creating a blog is choosing a blogging platform. You can 
find more detailed information about selecting a blogging platform later in 
this chapter. All free blog platform sites require users to be at least 13 years 
of age. These standards are in place partly for the safety of your children; 
like age restrictions on social media sites, you should not ignore the age 
requirements. You can also choose to pay for a self-hosted site by purchas­
ing a domain name and registering with a hosting service. These options are 
explored further in the upcoming section “Selecting a platform.”
Here are some main players for free blogging platforms:
	
✓	WordPress.com: http://wordpress.com
	
✓	Blogger (owned by Google): www.blogger.com
	
✓	Tumblr: https://www.tumblr.com
	
If your child would like to blog but is younger than age 13, consider creating a 
family blog together.

232
Part III: Grasping Social Media’s Effect on Your Family 
After your teen selects a blogging platform (with your guidance), it’s time to 
choose a site name. At this point, you should consider purchasing the related 
domain name or URL to not only protect your teen’s site name from being 
taken by someone else but also make sure that the name isn’t already in use.
A variety of services allow you to register a domain name:
	
✓	GoDaddy: www.godaddy.com
	
✓	NameCheap: www.namecheap.com
	
✓	1&1: www.1and1.com
	
✓	Network Solutions: www.networksolutions.com
	
✓	eNom: www.enom.com
If you choose to self-host your teen’s website, you likely will also be able to 
register the site domain through your hosting service.
Ask your teen to consider the following when selecting a domain name.
	
✓	What will be the focus of the blog?
	
✓	Will the site name make it easy for readers to find?
	
✓	Does the name allow the blog to grow and change with your teen?
	
✓	Is the name appropriate for a site owned by a teen?
	
✓	Would they be okay with future employers and universities locating this 
site?
	
✓	Is the name unique and not too similar to existing blogs?
If your child will be blogging on a self-hosted server (rather than a free blog 
platform), you will likely need to install WordPress, which is a free blogging 
tool and is the most popular blogging system (http://wordpress.org). 
(See Figure 14-6.)
The next step in creating a blog is to select a blog theme, which is a template 
that determines the appearance of the blog as well as some blog features. All 
blogging platforms provide users with a selection of free themes from which 
to choose. Users may also elect to upload and use additional blog themes, 
some of which are free, and some are for purchase.
Every blog theme requires users to select certain settings, including options 
such as allowing comments from readers. WordPress themes also allow for 
the installation of plug-ins, which are software that allows the site to perform 
specific abilities (such as automatically sharing new posts on Facebook and 
allowing readers to pin post images on Pinterest). Later in this chapter, I talk 
more about blog customization with themes and plug-ins.

233
 Chapter 14: Blogging, Creating, and Conducting Business Online for Kids
	
Figure 14-6:

If your teen is blogging using WordPress software, consider asking your teen to 
create a user account for you, complete with username and login. This will allow 
you to help with technical issues as well as monitor comments and content.
After your teen sets up a basic blogging platform with a name and a theme, it’s 
time to create both pages and posts. A blog page is just a static location that 
typically contains information such as author biography, site purpose, and 
contact information. A blog post is a singular blog entry, much like a daily diary 
entry. Most blogs display blog posts chronologically, with most recent on top.
Selecting a platform
As I mention earlier, a variety of free blogging platforms are available. Three of 
the most popular are WordPress.com, Blogger, and Tumblr (see Chapter 22). If 
you and your teen opt for one of these free hosting services, your teen will not 
technically own the blog nor the content they have written.
	
Your teen can, however, start blogging on a free platform and then migrate 
that content to a self-hosted website should your teen choose to invest more 
time and money into blogging.
Another option is to select a fee-based platform that’s not self-hosted. 
The most popular blog platform of this kind is Typepad (www.typepad.
com), where you can select a plan ranging from about $9 to $30 per month. 
Typepad is very user friendly and provides a simple solution for bloggers just 
getting started who want to own their own content. However, more develop­
ers are creating tools for use with WordPress blogs than Typepad, making 
Typepad a somewhat more limited tool.

234
Part III: Grasping Social Media’s Effect on Your Family 
The third option is to purchase a URL and a hosting plan from a third party, 
which you pay to host your site.
Consider the following when selecting a blogging platform:
	
✓	Cost: Costs can range from completely free blogging platforms to com­
pletely self-hosted sites that require the purchase of everything from the 
URL to the hosting server.
	
✓	Features: Self-hosted sites provide the flexibility for users to install a full 
range of features through plug-ins and widgets. Widgets allow bloggers 
to add images and features to their sites without requiring an in-depth 
knowledge of blog code. Free blogging platforms provide fewer features 
to add. Read more about plug-ins in the upcoming section, “Considering 
customization.”
	
✓	Customization options: Although you can modify the design of a blog 
hosted on any platform, it is much more difficult to do so on a site such 
as Blogger, which offers limited flexibility and requires the user to either 
have knowledge of coding — or hiring someone who does.
	
✓	Ease of use: Some bloggers prefer to have the option to highly custom­
ize their site, but with additional options comes additional complexity of 
use. Teens looking for most simple ease of use should consider a ready-
made, free blogging platform with a limited selection of options.
	
Know your child’s level of technical ability before selecting a blogging platform.
If your teen chooses to self-host their blog, there are many website hosts from 
which to choose. Some of the most popular with bloggers include the follow­
ing. Note: Pricing changes rapidly; these prices are current as of this writing.
	
✓	HostGator: HostGator web-hosting plans begin at $3.96 per month and 
can be purchased at www.hostgator.com.
	
✓	DreamHost: DreamHost offers monthly plans beginning at $8.95. Visit 
http://dreamhost.com for more information.
	
✓	Bluehost: Bluehost plans begin at $3.95 per month and can be found at 
www.bluehost.com.
	
✓	GoDaddy: GoDaddy web-hosting pricing starts at $1 per month and is 
located at www.godaddy.com.
	
✓	1&1: 1&1 web-hosting plans begin at $0.99 per month for the first 12 
months. This service can be found at www.1and1.com.
Considering customization
For many bloggers, one of the most enjoyable aspects of blogging is person­
alizing and customizing your blog. Sure, you can host and even customize a 

235
 Chapter 14: Blogging, Creating, and Conducting Business Online for Kids
free blog, but there are many more options for customization on self-hosted 
blogs:
	
✓	Theme: A blog’s theme acts as the template for a blog, setting visual 
aspects, such as number of columns, font style and size, and color 
schemes. With thousands of blog themes available, downloading and 
installing a theme is a fairly easy way to customize a blog.
	
✓	Graphics: All blog themes allow users to install graphics in such loca­
tions as the blog headers, as shown in Figure 14-7, as well as the blog 
background. Bloggers may upload photographs or other graphics 
through the image widgets in their blog theme to help give their site 
a customized look.
	
✓	Plug-ins and widgets: Plug-ins and widgets allow bloggers to add a 
variety of customized features to their sites including elements, such 
as search engine optimization, contact forms, spam filter, social media 
sharing icons, comment forms, and more. Figure 14-8 shows an example 
of social media sharing icons installed on a blog via a WordPress plug-in.
	
✓	Coding: Coding in the form of HTML (as shown in Figure 14-9) or a 
theme stylesheet is the language that determines the look and features 
of a blog. Many bloggers enjoy learning about how coding works and 
customizing their blogs by manipulating their blogs’ coding. This can 
be complicated and time-consuming but is often a self-taught skill. 
Some bloggers hire others to customize their sites through changes 
to their blogs’ coding.

Discussing Safety Concerns
As I discuss at length in Chapter 3, the life of a digitally connected child 
can be both incredibly rewarding but also risky due to the safety issues 
that stem from a child creating a public profile and interacting via that 
profile with strangers. Like social media accounts, blogging may place 
your child in the public eye and may allow people that your child doesn’t 
know to both learn personal information about them as well as contact 
them.
Public versus private blogging
Even if your child wants to create a blog and you’re okay with that, this 
doesn’t mean that the blog needs to be available for anyone to see and read. 
If you’re not okay with “going all public,” you can indeed create a blog visible 
only to the author or only through invitation and approval.

237
 Chapter 14: Blogging, Creating, and Conducting Business Online for Kids
Your child’s motivation for blogging may help you decide whether the blog 
should be public or private. For example, if your child wants to blog as a way 
to maintain an online journal, it may make more sense for her to keep this 
blog private just like a child would protect entries in a diary. This still allows 
the child to make use of technology in her journal keeping without the dan­
gers associated with oversharing (as outlined in Chapter 3). Your child may 
also consider creating a daily journal blog visible only to family members or 
even close friends.
For bloggers writing on the free Blogger platform, here’s how to make their 
blog private:
	
1.	Sign in to your Blogger account and click the Dashboard.
	
2.	Select the Settings link on the left sidebar. (See Figure 14-10.)
	
3.	Click the Permissions heading and then click Edit in the Blog Readers 
section. (See Figure 14-11.)
	
4.	Change the default Blog Readers setting (it’s a radio button) from 
Anybody to Only These Readers. (See Figure 14-12.)
	
5.	Click Save Changes.

After you set your Blogger site as private, you can then share the blog with 
friends and family by adding their e-mail addresses to the Invite field just 
below the Only These Readers selection. You can also choose to keep a 
Blogger blog completely private. At the time of this writing, you can’t share 
only individual posts via Blogger.

239
 Chapter 14: Blogging, Creating, and Conducting Business Online for Kids
For bloggers posting using WordPress, either at WordPress.org or on a web 
host using a unique domain name, you can make an individual blog post 
public or private. For example, WordPress users can opt to do the following, 
as shown in Figure 14-13:
	
✓	Make a blog post public.
	
✓	Protect a blog post with a password.
	
✓	Make a blog post completely private.
Bloggers writing on WordPress can also install plug-ins that allow them to do 
the following:
	
✓	Make your blog completely private and visible only through a password.
	
✓	Keep people from accessing your blog through an RSS (really simple 
syndication) feed.
	
✓	Block search engines from indexing your blog. Allowing search engines 
to index your blog makes it easier for readers to find your site.
Although most blogs are public by default and provide options for users to 
make either a post or the blog itself private, some platforms are private by 
default and provide authors with the option to share individual online journal 
entries. One platform to create a completely private online journal is Penzu 
(www.penzu.com). Each individual Penzu post may be shared via e-mail or by 
providing a friend or family member with a unique sharing link for that post.

Part III: Grasping Social Media’s Effect on Your Family 
	
Remind your kids that anything they share online can be seen and reshared by 
anyone. There is no taking it back!
Creating a safe blogging profile
Bloggers typically include information about themselves somewhere on their 
blogs on either an About page (see Figure 14-14) or in the blog sidebar or 
bottom (see Figure 14-15). As I discuss in Chapter 3, help guide your kids to 
carefully select both the amount and type of information they share about 
themselves online. Kids creating a public blogger profile should avoid shar­
ing any of the following information on their profile page:
	
✓	Full name
	
✓	Birthdate
	
✓	Home address
	
✓	School name and address
	
✓	E-mail address
	
✓	Cellphone number
Many blogger profile pages include a photograph of the blogger. Discuss with 
your kids what image of themselves they are promoting with the selection 
of their profile image. Young bloggers should avoid using profile images that 
make them look older or are sexual in any way. They should also be aware of 
any identifying information appearing in the background such as street signs 
or house numbers. Your kids may wish to use a photograph that does not 
show their face clearly or even include an image of them at all. For example, 
they may want to use a photo of a favorite vacation location or family pet. For 
more information about creating an appropriate online profile, see Chapter 4.
	
There is no way to keep your profile picture from being downloaded and used 
by anyone who can view it.
Using contact forms
Bloggers who share their writing publicly may have readers who wish to con­
tact them outside of blog comments. They may even hear from companies 
hoping to purchase advertising space on the website. However, I do not advise 
that young bloggers share their contact information publicly on their sites.
As a workaround, choose from a variety of free tools that can be used to 
create a contact form on a website. A contact form, as shown in Figure 14-16, 
allows a blogger to receive correspondence from anyone using their site 
without sharing any of their personal contact information. The form collects 

241
 Chapter 14: Blogging, Creating, and Conducting Business Online for Kids
the data from the correspondent and then e-mails it to the blogger. Most con­
tact forms also include filters to keep spam messages from being sent to the 
blogger. Parents wishing to monitor any correspondence to their child can 
opt to have the contact form message copied to their email address or even 
sent only to the parent e-mail address.

Joining Blogging Communities
At first glance, it may seem that blogging is a very isolating hobby, with teens 
spending hours blogging alone at their computer. However, many bloggers 
enjoy joining online communities where they can connect with other online 
authors. Not all that many active, well-maintained online communities exist 
specifically for teen bloggers, but here are some reasons why teens may 
choose to join existing blog communities:
	
✓	Connecting with other affinity groups: Many bloggers write about a 
specific topic, such as sports, photography, pets, or music. Blogging 
communities are a great way to connect with like-minded online writers 
who also cover similar topics.
	
✓	Participating in class blogs: Many teachers have created websites for 
use by their students, some including student blogs. Participation in 
these student blogging projects is often optional, but teens may find 
these classroom communities to be a safe place to practice writing skills 
and learn more about blogging in general.
	
✓	Asking blogging questions: For most bloggers, creating and maintaining 
a blog is a self-taught skill. Participation in blogging communities pro­
vides teens with a place to ask questions and find information on every­
thing from the best plug-ins to install to how to change a site’s coding.
	
✓	Promoting their blog: A common activity in most blogging communities 
is promotion of blog posts. Members often support one another by visit­
ing, commenting on, and sharing blog posts of fellow members.

243
 Chapter 14: Blogging, Creating, and Conducting Business Online for Kids
	
Blogging communities are not necessarily kid-friendly, and your teen’s partici­
pation in such online communities should be monitored.
Kids as Online Entrepreneurs
Just as blogging allows kids to be self-published authors online, living in a 
digital world also allows kids unlimited possibilities in terms of entrepreneur­
ship. This digital age provides kids with a unique skill set with the opportu­
nity to share that skill with others, adding “online business owner” to the list 
of possible after-school and summer jobs available to kids today.
Game creation
One area where digitally savvy teens with an entrepreneurial spirit excel is in 
video game creation. There are a variety of online and offline courses for teens 
looking to learn about game creation, programming, and game development as 
well as summer camps for those looking for a concentrated curriculum to learn 
the skills needed to create video games. These camps and courses allow teens 
to interact with professionals in the field and develop skills that can immedi­
ately be put to use in game creation. Examples of such camps include
	
✓	Video Game Design Camp at Michigan State University
www.spartanyouth.msu.edu
	
✓	New York Film Academy Game Design Camp
www.nyfa.edu
	
✓	iD Gaming Academy
www.internaldrive.com/idga
	
✓	Emagination Game Design Camp
www.computercamps.com/video/game/design_for_teens.html
	
✓	Digital Media Academy
www.digitalmediaacademy.org
If you would like to support your child or teen in exploring video game cre­
ation, you may want to download or purchase video game creation software. 
The following free tools are available for those interested in learning more 
about game development:
	
✓	Game Maker 8: This free development software allows users to create 
games with the help of tutorials and a drag-and-drop interface. Users 
with more experience and understanding of programming language are 

244
Part III: Grasping Social Media’s Effect on Your Family 
able to create more customization within their games. Learn more at 
www.yoyogames.com/gamemaker.
	
✓	Phrogram: Phrogram is free development software best suited for 
folks with some computer programming experience who like to turn 
those skills into game development knowledge. Phrogram also intro­
duces computer programming newbies to the world of game creation. 
Phrogram isn’t entirely free but does offer a 30-day free trial option. 
Learn more at www.phrogram.com.
	
✓	Sploder: www.sploder.com is a website allowing game creation begin­
ners to make their own game for free. This service allows users to save 
games and share them with other users on Sploder. Users can also 
share the games they’ve created on their own website so that anyone 
can play the games.
	
✓	RPG Maker XP: This software focuses on role-playing games (RPGs). 
After a user has created a game with RPG Maker XP, he can share that 
game with any Windows PC user. Members of a highly active user com­
munity share fan sites they have created along with game creation tuto­
rials. RPG Maker XP can be found at www.rpgmakerweb.com.
	
✓	Pygame: This free online tool uses a specific game creation language — 
Python — which is one of the easier computer programming languages 
to learn. To learn more, visit www.pygame.org.
Computer animation and graphic design
Like video game creation, the fields of computer animation and graphic design 
are areas where technologically savvy teens can explore career options from 
the comfort of their home computer. In fact, according to Fast Company (www.
fastcompany.com), one teenage girl became a young millionaire after creating 
a MySpace customization service and launching her business online.
Like game creation, many programs and camps exist to support kids inter­
ested in learning more about computer animation and graphic design. Here 
are just a few resources available:

Business owners
Just as kids can create their own blogs with just a little help from a parent, 
they can also create easy-to-navigate websites to showcase their skills and 
run an online business. A variety of sites exist for teens hoping to sell a 
product or service online who do want to create their own website:
Bizinate
Bizinate (formerly, Kidworth) helps young entrepreneurs start their own busi­
nesses, guiding them through everything from the financial aspects of owning a 
business to the logistics of setting up an online storefront. The site claims that 
through their site, an ambitious teen can launch a business in three minutes 
with no knowledge of coding, need to own a credit card, or filing of legal paper­
work. With tens of thousands of users already, the Bizinate goal is to empower 
a new generation of entrepreneurs, starting with digitally savvy teens.
Parents of Bizinate users can create a master account for their kids, which 
they can run on their own, delegating aspects of the business to their child. 
Teens can create and manage their accounts on Bizinate. For more informa­
tion, visit www.bizinate.com.
Etsy
Etsy is an online marketplace where users can create virtual storefronts in 
order to sell the crafts and items they have created. Etsy account holders 
must be at least 18 years of age. However, Etsy is a great way for parents to 
facilitate their child’s budding business skills and creativity by working with 
them to create a family online store. Learn more at www.etsy.com.
eBay
Like Etsy, eBay also requires sellers to be at least 18 years old. However, this 
online auction site allows families to support children in selling gently used items 
in what amounts to a digital yard sale, giving kids the opportunity to use technol­
ogy to earn money and gain basic marketing skills. Start at www.ebay.com.

Handheld Gaming
In This Chapter
▶	Screening handheld game console content
▶	Finding great educational handheld games
▶	Comparing handheld game devices
T

he digital world has come a long way since Game Boys and listening to 
cassettes on a Walkman. There are now a variety of handheld gaming 
consoles for children as young as four years old. Like most technology, not 
all handheld gaming systems are the same, each with unique features and 
a varied assortment of game cartridges and applications. This chapter will 
guide you through what you need to know when purchasing a handheld game 
device for your kids as well as introduce you to some of the top handheld 
game consoles available.
Previewing Games for Content
Regardless of the brand of any handheld game device, preview each game 
for content. All current devices come with a suggested age range, but that 
doesn’t mean that every game available for the platform is also suitable for 
the youngest kids within that age group.
Some systems, such as the LeapFrog LeapsterGS (see Figure 15-1), come with 
preloaded games. Before turning the device over to your little one, though, 
take some time to go through each game on the device to ensure that you feel 
comfortable with the graphics and the language used throughout the game. 
Some games with age-appropriate educational points, graphics, and activities 
may have dialog that you don’t deem appropriate for your child.

device with 
preloaded 
games for 
children.
	
When purchasing additional games for the handheld devices in your home, 
look at the front of the packaging (or a product website) to determine the 
recommended age for that game. Games for VTech, LeapFrog, and Fisher-
Price devices don’t contain Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) rat­
ings. However, they do display the age range and learning goals for which the 
game was created, as shown in Figure 15-2. Consider previewing the content 
before sharing it with your child, just as for preloaded games.
	
Figure 15-2:

age ranges 
and learning

packages.
	
Games created for Nintendo handheld gaming devices and Sony handheld 
game consoles are rated by the ESRB. Look on the front of the game packag­
ing to locate the ESRB rating for those games.

251
 Chapter 15: Handheld Gaming
	
For more information on ESRB ratings, see Chapter 6. These ratings not only 
tell you the suggested age group for the game, but also give you specific infor­
mation about content, such as violence and sexual material.
Comparing Educational and 
Entertainment Games
Many handheld gaming devices are popular with children and parents 
because of their educational content. However, not all content created for 
educational handheld devices is equally instructive. Likewise, you can find 
educational games for entertainment-based handheld devices. The following 
products are included in the learning system category of handheld devices:
	
✓	VTech MobiGo and MobiGo 2
	
✓	LeapFrog LeapsterGS
	
✓	LeapFrog Leapster Explorer
Even after selecting a specific game console as a learning device category, 
you still may wish to look closely at the game description to preview the 
content for appropriateness. Some manufacturers of learning devices offer a 
“just for fun” category to identify clearly games and apps not meant to pro­
vide educational benefits, but rather simply to entertain. See Figure 15-3 for 
an example of this category of products for the LeapFrog Leapster Explorer.
	
Figure 15-3:

Fun titles

devices.
	

252
Part IV: Left to Their Own Devices 
Most learning device game cartridge packages are clearly labeled with the 
educational content and goals of that app (refer to Figure 15-2). Look for 
keywords like these:
	
✓	Rhyming, letters
	
✓	Shapes, colors
	
✓	Matching, patterns
	
✓	Counting, numbers
	
✓	Vocabulary, foreign language
The best way to locate educational games for handheld game consoles not 
in the learning device category is to look at both the ESRB rating as well as 
the game title and description. Learning games are most likely to be rated E 
(Everyone) by the ESRB. They will also likely include the learning objectives 
directly in the title — for example, Kids Learn Music, for Nintendo DS — and 
game packaging typically doesn’t list learning objectives the same way as 
games created specifically for learning devices.
Comparing Handheld Gaming Devices
Here is an overview of current handheld game devices, including price point 
and recommended age range for each device.
Nintendo 3DS and 3DS XL
The Nintendo 3DS and 3DS XL (the larger screen version) both come with a 
3-D screen that allows users to view 3-D features without using 3-D glasses. 
(See Figure 15-4.) The 3-D capability can be turned off or adjusted via its 3D 
Depth Slider. Each device also features a Circle Pad, motion sensor, and gyro 
sensor as part of the gaming interface.
Nintendo 3DS devices come equipped with the SpotPass feature, which 
allows for wireless Internet access, as well as StreetPass, which allows your 
child’s 3DS device to exchange data with other 3DS systems. You can turn 
off both features if you don’t want your child’s device to connect to Wi-Fi 
or other devices. Each 3DS also includes a Nintendo 3DS Camera as well as 
access to Internet browsing.
Parental controls can be enabled on the 3DS to restrict game use by rating or 
Wi-Fi, 3D, and StreetPass. Prices for the 3DS and 3DS XL range from approxi­
mately $170 (US) to $200. Nintendo 3DS is recommended for kids age 6 and 
older.

Nintendo DS and Nintendo DS XL
Like the Nintendo 3DS, Nintendo DS handheld game consoles include a 
camera and Wi-Fi connectivity for Internet browsing. The Nintendo DS also 
allows for online and multiplayer games, which can be disabled via paren­
tal controls. The Nintendo DS is slightly smaller than the Nintendo 3DS and 
retails for about $100. The XL model has a bigger screen. Games for the 
Nintendo DS begin at a suggested age range of 4 years of age and older.
Online support for all Nintendo handheld gaming devices can be found at 
www.nintendo.com/consumer/index.jsp.
Sony PSPgo and PSP-3000
The Sony PSP handheld gaming devices all include built-in Wi-Fi that allows 
users to connect with their PS3 gaming console, read RSS feeds, browse the 
Internet, and make calls on the Skype platform. You can also listen to music 
and watch movies and television shows via the PSP game consoles. Each PSP 
device allows parents to set the following via parental controls:
	
✓	Game restriction according to ESRB rating
	
✓	Internet browser restrictions
	
✓	Video and TV show restrictions by rating
The PSPgo retails for about $200, and the PSP-3000 retails for about $130. 
Both are shown in Figure 15-5. Games for the PSPgo and PSP-3000 begin at a 
suggested age range of 7 years of age and older.

Sony PS Vita
The Sony PS Vita is a handheld gaming system that comes in a Wi-Fi only 
option as well as a Wi-Fi plus 3G-connectivity option. Each handheld gaming 
console features a touch screen, motion sensor, cameras, GPS, and the ability 
to connect with the PS3 game console. The 3G connectivity unit is powered 
by the AT&T mobile broadband network. The PS Vita is sold at a suggested 
retail price of $250. Games for the PS Vita begin at a suggested age range of 
8 years of age and older.
LeapFrog Leapster Explorer
The Leapster Explorer is recommended for ages 4 to 9 years and is touted to 
be a learning game system although it does include just-for-fun games. This 
device comes with preset games and videos, but also plays downloaded and 
cartridge-based games, videos, and e-books. The main goal of the Leapster 
Explorer is to provide kids with games that help them practice learning skills, 
such as reading, writing, math, and science.
Because the Leapster Explorer is a learning device, it includes access to 
an online application that allows parents to track their children’s learning 
progress through the use of the games. Kids can also participate in a related 
online world, LeapWorld.
The Leapster Explorer, shown in Figure 15-6, retails for around $50.

LeapFrog LeapsterGS Explorer
The LeapsterGS Explorer (refer to Figure 15-1) includes a camera that 
takes pictures and videos as well as a touch screen and a motion sensor. 
Recommended for ages 4 to 9 years, this device comes with preloaded 
games and also plays downloaded and cartridge-based games and videos. 
Like the Leapster Explorer, the LeapsterGS focuses on learning skills, such 
as math, reading, and writing, and children’s progress can be tracked 
online through the LeapFrog Learning Path.
The LeapsterGS Explorer retails for much less than its suggested price of $70.
VTech MobiGo
The VTech MobiGo handheld learning device, shown in Figure 15-7, is recom­
mended for ages 3 to 8 years and retails for about $60. Each device comes 
with preloaded games and also uses downloaded and cartridge-based 
e-books, coloring books, an art studio, a photo album, games, and videos. 
The MobiGo also includes a slide-out keyboard as well as a microphone, 
touchscreen, and camera. Games focus on learning skills, such as math, 
vocabulary, spelling, reading, logic, and drawing.

iPod touch
The iPod touch from Apple began primarily as a way to store and listen to 
music, but has evolved to include Wi-Fi capability, Internet browsing, camera 
and video capabilities, and a game center where users can download single 
and multi-player game apps from the App Store. There are parental restric­
tions available for the iPod touch that allow you to limit the types of apps 
and games your child may access. You can also use the parental controls to 
change settings, such as the ability to play multiplayer games and the use of 
location services. The iPod touch retails for a suggested starting price 
of $300.

home, your kids want to check it out. (Hurray for Gorilla Glass!) Chances 
are that your kids are even savvier than you with everything from your smart 
phone to the family’s home computer. Still, if you’re not ready to turn your 
tablet over to your toddler, there are a few options for providing kids with 
their very own tablet device. And, there are some great applications and 
tablet features created primarily for adults that may keep your kids off your 
apps, even if they’ve got their hands on your tablet.
Knowing the Tablet Types
Here are four basic kinds of tablets to choose from when selecting a tablet for 
your children or entire family:
	
✓	An Apple iPad: The Apple iPad and iPad mini run on Apple’s operating 
system (iOS) and feature games and applications downloaded from the 
Apple iTunes Store.
	
✓	An Android tablet: Barnes & Noble’s NOOK and Amazon’s Kindle Fire are 
examples of Android tablets. These tablets offer access to child-friendly 
e-books and downloads, but they’re not created specifically for kids.
	
✓	Android tablets for kids: Some tablets created for children — such as 
the Nabi — run on an Android platform and use Android OS–based apps 
much like the NOOK and Kindle Fire.
	
✓	Learning device tablets: These tablets are created specifically for kids 
and use only the apps and cartridges developed specifically for them by 
the tablet’s parent company.
The following are examples of Android tablets for kids or learning device tab­
lets created specifically for children.

Chapter 17
Being Smart with Mobile Phones
In This Chapter
▶	Deciding when to get your children a mobile phone
▶	Understanding service plan limit options
▶	Analyzing mobile phone safety concerns
K

ids as young as elementary school age carry mobile phones and use 
technology ranging from texting to online chats. Providing your child 
with a mobile phone — whether a smartphone with advanced computing 
capability and connectivity or a feature phone with little more than voice 
call and text messaging functionality — may be a great way for your family 
to stay connected and stay safe when out with friends, at work, or attending 
after-school activities. The key to making mobile phones work for your family 
is to set clear guidelines by age group and location, focusing on each of the 
phone’s capabilities when creating your Digital Family Policy (see Chapter 2). 
The following sections will help you create these guidelines, consider safety 
concerns, and monitor your family’s mobile phones.
Determining the Right Age 
to Get a Phone
A study published by AT&T (www.att.com/familysafety) includes the 
following statistics about kids and phones:
	
✓	The average age for a child to receive their first mobile phone is 12.1 
years.
	
✓	Nearly all (90 percent) of kids surveyed believe that it’s okay for parents 
to set rules about phone usage.
	
✓	Nearly 40 percent of kids surveyed said that their parents have not dis­
cussed mobile phone safety with them.

268
Part IV: Left to Their Own Devices 
And a 2012 Nielsen report claims that 58 percent of kids ages 13 to 17 years 
have their own smartphone.
www.blog.nielsen.com/online_mobile/young-adults-and-
teens-lead-growth-among-smartphone-owners/
However, adding a data plan to your child’s mobile phone requires an addi­
tional level of maturity beyond just call and text. Deciding on the right age 
to get your child their first phone will differ from child to child and family 
to family. You may choose to create rules based on specific situations and 
needs within your family rather than setting a family-wide rule by age.
To determine the right time to purchase your child’s first mobile phone, con­
sider the following questions:
	
✓	Need to communicate: Does your family’s schedule require you to be in 
touch with your children regarding schedule changes such as activity 
pick up time and location or after school plans? Providing a child with a 
mobile phone allows convenient communication for busy families.
	
✓	Safety concerns: Do you feel like your children should have a mobile 
phone for safety reasons? Do they walk home from school or an activity 
alone? Is their bus stop out of view of your home?
	
✓	Responsibility: Is your child responsible enough to own a potentially 
expensive device, such as a smartphone? Will he lose it? Is he likely to 
break the phone and need it to be replaced often? Does he have a good 
track record of caring for other expensive devices such as handheld 
games or game consoles? Has he shown responsibility in other areas, 
such as caring for a family pet?
	
✓	Tech-savvy: Do you feel comfortable with your child having access to 
the technology that is included in a mobile phone’s capabilities?
	
✓	Rules: Will your child follow the rules for phone use set in your Digital 
Family Policy (see Chapter 2)? Do you feel comfortable enforcing these 
rules, even if that means taking the phone away for a period of time?
	
✓	True need: Will your child actually use the phone? Do her friends also 
own phones (providing her with someone to text), or will a call-only plan 
suffice? Will there actually be times when your child is without adult 
supervision and need to contact you or be contacted by you directly?
	
✓	Location-appropriate behavior: Does your child understand that dif­
ferent settings require different behaviors and that mobile phone usage 
rules may differ throughout the day? For example, will your child follow 
a no-texting-in-school policy?
	
✓	Alternatives: Could your child borrow a parent’s or sibling’s phone 
during the rare occasion that he needs to have a phone?
	
✓	Cost: Will the family budget allow for the additional monthly cost?

269
 Chapter 17: Being Smart with Mobile Phones
	
During the creation of your Digital Family Policy, include a conversation about 
the potential need for a mobile phone.
When your child asks for his first mobile phone, find out more information 
about why he wants one to help you determine whether the time is right. 
Ask him to provide you with specifics including answers to the following 
questions:
	
✓	Are you willing to sign a mobile phone use contract? Be sure to 
include guidelines for phone use including time/text limits and phone 
etiquette in your family’s contract.
	
✓	Why do you need/want a phone? Can your child justify asking for a 
mobile phone? Does she want one because her friends have them?
	
✓	When would you like to be able to use your phone? If your child wants 
a mobile phone for during the school day but your child’s school has 
a policy that phones must be kept in lockers, perhaps there’s not a 
justifiable reason to purchase a phone. If, however, he is asking because 
he would feel safer having a phone for after sporting events or after-
school activities, you may want to consider honoring his request for 
a phone.
	
✓	Do you want a smartphone or a feature phone? If your child claims 
to only want a phone for the purpose of calling home while out with 
friends but then requests a smartphone, you may need to ask more 
questions about the intended use of the phone before making a 
decision.
	
Research the mobile phone policy at your child’s school prior to making a 
family decision about when your child should have a mobile phone.
Choosing from call-only, kid-friendly, 
and prepaid phone options
If you decide that your child should have a mobile phone but he doesn’t need 
smartphone functionality, you may want to purchase a feature phone with 
limited functions. Don’t get “sold” that the only phones available are smart­
phones (like miniature, handheld computers). There are many options for 
parents wanting to provide their children with a bare-bones mobile phone 
without additional capabilities.
	
Many phone types are available as well as types of plans.

270
Part IV: Left to Their Own Devices 
When selecting a phone with limited capabilities for your child, first deter­
mine whether you would like to purchase a standard phone contract or a 
prepaid phone plan, such as a phone with limited monthly minutes or one for 
which you can add minutes at a set rate per minute. Consider the following 
when making this decision:
	
✓	Will you save money with a prepaid plan over a contract based on the 
number of minutes your child will use the phone to make and receive 
calls?
	
✓	Will you be able to add additional features (such as text) without changing 
plans?
	
✓	Does your wireless provider allow you to add a child’s phone for a minimal 
cost?
	
✓	Is it important to you to not be locked into a multiple year contract for 
your child’s phone?
Your wireless phone service provider offers devices that don’t include the 
data plans that come standard with a smartphone. While these phones typi­
cally include additional features (cameras and texting capability), you can 
indeed purchase a phone without being saddled with a texting or data plan.
	
Most major wireless service providers offer kid-friendly plans and parental 
controls.
You can also find phones and phone service plans created specifically with 
young children and tweens in mind. The following are examples of mobile 
phones and phone service plans available at the time of publishing:
	
✓	Kajeet (www.kajeet.com) is a pay-as-you-go mobile phone service cre­
ated specifically for children. (See Figure 17-1.) You have the freedom to 
select a feature phone or a smartphone for your child and then link that 
phone to the Kajeet no-contract service. Kajeet’s plan comes automatically 
linked to parental controls that allow you to limit the use of that phone to 
specific incoming calls, specific outgoing calls, and other limited function­
ality such as times of use. Kajeet phones also come with a GPS phone loca­
tor to help parents locate their child via their Kajeet phone. It costs as little 
as $4.99 per month for a child to use the Kajeet phone service.
	
✓	Firefly (www.fireflymobile.com), shown in Figure 17-2, sells mobile 
phones created specifically for children and tweens. Their phones allow 
kids to contact only pre-approved phone numbers and emergency num­
bers. Parents control what games and features their children have access 
to via a PIN-protected parental control. Like Kajeet, Firefly also provides 

271
 Chapter 17: Being Smart with Mobile Phones
mobile phone service that does not require an extended contract. At the 
time of this writing, Firefly provides the option to purchase either the 
Firefly glowPhone or the Nokia 100 for use with Firefly Mobile service.

✓	Jitterbug (www.greatcall.com), shown in Figure 17-3, is a call-only 
phone from Samsung designed for users who may require a simple 
user experience with easy-to-understand functionality and large, easy-
to-see, easy-to-press buttons. The Jitterbug service plan is provided 
by GreatCall, which does not require a long-term service plan. The 
GreatCall pay-as-you-go plan includes optional features, such as a per­
sonal calendar. This phone and plan were created with the elderly in 
mind, but may work well for parents who want to equip their children 
with a call-only, easy-to-use phone. Plans are $14.99 per month.

Deciding when to allow text, 
data, and applications
If you choose to purchase a phone for your child with texting and data capa­
bilities, you need to decide the right time to allow access to these additional 
features. First, consider the additional cost of adding these features:
	
✓	Will you pay for the additional capabilities, or will your child be 
expected to pitch in to the cost?
	
✓	Will you need to pay for unlimited data? Overage charges on data plans 
can add up very quickly.
	
✓	Will your child text often enough to require an unlimited texting plan? 
Costs per text on most plans can also add up very quickly.

273
 Chapter 17: Being Smart with Mobile Phones
Beyond added expense, expanding the capabilities of your child’s phone also 
brings with it added responsibility. For many tweens and teens, texting is their 
top form of communication, taking up a chunk of their day and requiring them to 
make mature decisions not only about proper use of the platform but also about 
boundaries. Texting can be a wonderful tool for friends and family to stay con­
nected. It can also, however, become invasive and addictive for children who feel 
they must respond to friends’ texts constantly, day and night. When evaluating 
whether your child is ready for texting, consider the following:
	
✓	Does your child need access to text messages or just want it?
	
✓	Will your child follow your family’s guidelines regarding number of texts 
allowed and time periods when texting is permitted?
	
✓	Is your child mature enough to understand appropriate use of texting, such 
as what information is appropriate to share and what constitutes bullying?
	
Kids learn from watching their parents’ behavior. Model the texting boundar­
ies that you want your children to follow.
Remind your kids that the rules for appropriate mobile phone use extend 
beyond your family to include school and after school jobs and activities.
Unlike feature phones, it’s difficult to make a case that a child requires a 
smartphone with a data plan. However, there is no denying the convenience 
of a smartphone with a data plan as well as the entertainment value of a smart­
phone with access to an endless assortment of games and applications. Many 
parents provide their children with access to apps through their own phones, 
but allowing your children to own their own smartphone is an additional level 
of access to the Internet and all that it has to offer, both good and bad.
Before deciding to add a data plan to your child’s smartphone, consider the 
following questions:
	
✓	Will your child understand and follow limits for potentially expensive 
data usage?
	
✓	Will your child feel comfortable coming to you if she is accidentally 
exposed to inappropriate content or receives inappropriate contact?
	
✓	Is your child mature enough to understand how to use a smartphone 
safely?
	
✓	Are you ready for the added responsibility of monitoring your child’s 
increased access to the Internet?
	
✓	Do you feel comfortable using parental controls to help protect your 
child from inappropriate content or overuse?
	
✓	Do the positives (such as a chance to learn responsibility and increased 
connectivity) outweigh the potential negatives (such as added cost and 
additional screen time)?

274
Part IV: Left to Their Own Devices 
	
The average age when a child receives their first mobile phone is around the 
beginning of middle school.
Preparing your child for safe phone use
After (if) you determine that your child is old enough to have a mobile device 
of their own, here are some steps that you can take to help ensure safe use of 
the device:
	
✓	Include the device in your Digital Family Policy, discussed in Chapter 2. 
Each device’s usage should be defined, such as appropriate usage, guide­
lines for when to share concerns with parents, and appropriate docking 
and charging locations.
	
✓	Set up parental controls prior to turning the device over to your children.
	
✓	Help your child select and set up a password for the device to protect 
your child’s privacy as well as sensitive information. In Chapter 3, I talk 
about password protection in more depth.
	
✓	Add parents, other relatives, and emergency numbers to the device’s 
contact list.
	
✓	Consider additional security and monitoring software, which I discuss in 
more detail later in this chapter.
	
✓	Create a mobile phone use contract with your children and include it 
in your Digital Family Policy. Consider including the following in your 
child’s mobile phone contract:
 
• A phone curfew limiting the hours during which the phone can be 
used
 
• Guidelines concerning how phone time affects family screen time 
allowances
 
• Standards for texting etiquette, including strict guidelines regard­
ing bullying or otherwise disrespectful or unkind behavior via the 
phone
 
• Specifics regarding answering calls from numbers your child 
doesn’t recognize or placing calls to numbers not on an approved 
list of contacts
 
• Rules regarding downloading apps with parent permission only
 
• A strict “no texting while driving” and no-sexting policy (if age 
appropriate)
 
• Consequences for breaking any rule within the mobile phone 
contract

None of the software that I mention here replaces having honest and frequent 
discussions with your kids about responsible and safe phone use. If used, 
these tools should be partnered with open communication with your children 
rather than replacing conversation. The best way to know what your kids are 
doing on their mobile devices is to talk with them.
These software tools can help you track or limit mobile phone use:
	
✓	PhoneSheriff allows parents to block functions according to time of day, 
track the mobile device via GPS, block communication with certain num­
bers, and record all text messages and phone calls. Learn more about

Mobile Phone Safety Concerns
Many parents think about mobile phones and safety together because 
chances are that they purchased a mobile phone for their children for safety 
reasons. Although having the ability to call emergency services and stay in 
touch with parents while out with friends are some of the positives of mobile 
phone ownership, several safety concerns arise with mobile phone use.

281
 Chapter 17: Being Smart with Mobile Phones
GPS and your children’s privacy
I cover the potential dangers of GPS in Chapter 3. Enabling GPS on your 
child’s phone allows you to locate your child via their mobile phone, but it 
also allows applications, services, and potential predators to locate them.
If you and your child choose to keep the GPS function activated on mobile 
phone, consider asking your teen to opt out of allowing applications — such 
as Facebook and Twitter — to access this function. Applications that allow 
your teen to check in at specific locations publicly alert strangers to your 
child’s current location. Some programs even allow friends to post your 
child’s location without your child’s permission.
Consider the following:
	
✓	Talk to your children often about privacy settings on their phones.
	
✓	Create specific rules about location services on apps that allow strang­
ers to find them.
	
✓	Ask your children not to download applications that provide location 
access to Friend lists.
	
✓	Ask your children to remove location from online social media posts, 
such as those on Facebook and Twitter.
Texting and driving
A 2012 study by the University of Michigan found that more than 25 percent 
of teens admitted to reading or sending a text message while behind the 
wheel, making them far more likely to be in an accident.
www.ns.umich.edu/new/releases/21000-driver-distraction-
do-as-i-say-not-as-i-do-or-what-you-think-i-do
You can place apps on your child’s phone to help prevent them from texting 
and driving, but be sure to talk to your children about the danger of texting 
and driving. Be sure to include rules about texting and driving within your 
Digital Family Policy, such as the following:
	
✓	Ask your teens to sign a pledge to never text while at the wheel.
	
✓	Ask your kids to ask their friends not to text while driving while they are 
in the car.
	
✓	Create and enforce consequences for texting while driving.

282
Part IV: Left to Their Own Devices 
	
Kids watch you to know what behavior is appropriate. If you don’t want 
your kids to text and drive, make sure that you aren’t texting while driving, 
either!
Talk about texting and driving with your children as soon as they receive 
their first mobile device rather than waiting until they are also old enough to 
drive. Consider the following talking points when having this discussion:
	
✓	Be clear with them about the potential consequences of texting behind 
the wheel including serious and possibly deadly accidents.
	
✓	Point out that texting while driving is illegal in many states.
	
✓	Include consequences for texting and driving in your child’s mobile 
phone contract.
	
✓	Ask your kids to take a pledge to never text and drive, such as the It Can 
Wait pledge found at http://itcanwait.com. (See Figure 17-7.)
	
✓	Discuss ways to avoid texting and driving, such as the use of apps and 
choosing an out-of-reach phone storage location in the car.

283
 Chapter 17: Being Smart with Mobile Phones
The AT&T DriveMode, T-Mobile DriveSmart, and Sprint Drive First applica­
tions that I mention earlier in this chapter will help your teens stick to their 
pledges to never text and drive. Here are some other ways to use technology 
to protect your children from some of the dangers technology brings:
	
✓	DriveOFF: This Android app (found at Google Play) from Esure can 
detect when the mobile device has reached a speed of more than 10 
mph and will disable any potentially distracting apps as well as incom­
ing texts and calls.
	
✓	TextBuster (www.textbuster.com): This system requires parents to 
install a device on their teen’s car and an app on their teen’s phone. 
Text messaging, e-mail, and Internet access then become disabled when 
the car is moving. Phone calls, however, can still be received, and GPS 
applications will still work.
	
✓	DriveScribe (http://drivescribe.com): This free app blocks text 
messages and incoming calls when the owner’s car is in motion. It also 
tells drivers to slow down if they are going too fast, and creates a report 
for parents to show if the teen exceeded the speed limit while driving.
	
✓	Canary (http://thecanaryproject.com): This free application 
allows parents to see whether their children used their phone while 
driving more than 12 mph. This app also sends parents an alert if it has 
been disabled by the teen.
	
✓	DriveSafe.ly (www.drivesafe.ly): This application reads text mes­
sages and e-mails aloud and responds without the need for drivers to 
touch their mobile phones.
Talking to your children about sexting
According to the Pew Research Center (see link below) sexting — sending a 
sexual text message with or without a photograph — affects at least 15 per­
cent of teens; that is, they’ve received this type of message via their mobile 
phone.
www.pewinternet.org/Reports/2009/Teens-and-Sexting/
Overview.aspx

284
Part IV: Left to Their Own Devices 
In Chapter 3, I talk about the dangers of participating in sexting, including 
possible legal consequences. Parents need to talk frankly with their children 
about sexting before providing them with access to a phone that supports 
text. When talking with your children about sexting, consider covering the 
following:
	
✓	Discuss the rules regarding sexting in either your Digital Family Policy 
or mobile phone contract including consequences if your teen sends an 
inappropriate text or picture.
	
✓	Create a plan for what your child should do if he receives a sexting 
message from someone.
	
✓	Remind your children not to delete messages sent to them that may be 
inappropriate, especially those from people they do not know. These 
messages may be needed should you need to report inappropriate or 
potentially dangerous behavior.
	
✓	Discuss the consequences of sexting ranging from hurting another 
person emotionally to breaking sexting or even child pornography laws.
	
✓	Remind your kids that after they send an image, they have no control 
over who sees or shares that image.
	
✓	Encourage your children to feel comfortable coming to you if they feel 
pressure to participate in this type of behavior.
Snapchat and sexting
One of the key messages throughout this book 
is that parents need to explain to their children 
that after you share an image digitally, you can 
never take it back. The application Snapchat 
has changed that, and unfortunately, some 
teens are taking advantage of the app to send 
inappropriate pictures to people in their con­
tact list. Snapchat is a photo-sharing app that 
allows the user to take a photo and share it 
with friends. What makes this app unique is that 
moments after the picture is shared, it disap­
pears completely. However, some users have 
found ways to save the photos sent to them 
through a screenshot and similar methods. The 
message for kids? Even with Snapchat, assume 
that anything you send digitally may be cap­
tured and shared with others.

R

aising digital natives means raising kids who have unprecedented 
access to online resources for everything from education to entertain­
ment. One of the challenges of raising a digital family is evaluating the con­
stantly changing online world for both safety and appropriateness — which, 
when it comes to online education, can be especially challenging. Sites may 
claim to provide educational content to your children when really their 
purpose is to simply entertain or even advertise to your children. This 
chapter takes a look at ways to valuate online content for educational value 
as well as understanding the role that the digital world plays in your child’s 
school life.
Determining the Educational Value 
of Learning Websites
There are scores of educational websites with great content and fun tools for 
kids. Here are just a few that your children may enjoy:
	
✓	Starfall (www.starfall.com): The focus of this site for children pre­
school age and older is to learn to read. The site is free of advertising 
and provides material appropriate for various learning stages.

288
Part V: Utilizing Online Family Resources 
	
✓	GridClub (www.gridclub.com): Aimed at elementary school age kids 
and older, this fee-based site covers a variety of curriculum areas includ­
ing math, reading, and science.
	
✓	Sesame Street (www.sesamestreet.org): This site is great for toddlers 
and preschoolers learning basics, such as numbers, shapes, colors, and 
letters.
	
✓	BrainPOP Jr. (www.brainpopjr.com): BrainPOP requires a subscrip­
tion for kids to use it. The main target of this website is children in lower 
elementary school.
	
✓	Funbrain (www.funbrain.com): This educational site is a sister site to 
the popular online world, Poptropica. Unlike Poptropica, Funbrain pro­
vides educational games that build on the skills your child is learning in 
elementary school.
	
✓	ZiggityZoom (www.ziggityzoom.com): ZiggityZoom was created for 
kids preschool age and older and focuses on reading, coloring, drawing, 
and other printables and crafts.
	
✓	PBS Kids Play! (www.pbskidsplay.org): This site for preschool 
kids and older is advertisement-free and covers topics from shapes 
and colors to reading and math for older children. There is a $9.95 per 
month subscription fee for the use of this site.
	
✓	Ready to Learn Reading (www.pbskids.org/read): The goal of this 
site, which is funded by the U.S. Department of Education, is to help 
kids develop core reading skills and reading readiness.
	
✓	ABCya (www.abcya.com): Kids hoping to find practice for math 
and reading skills they are learning in school will enjoy ABCya.com. 
The content is organized by grade level making it easy for kids and 
parents to know that they are spending time in the right area of the 
site.
	
✓	National Geographic Kids (www.kids.nationalgeographic.com): 
This site provides kids with fun factoids and interesting articles about 
topics ranging from geography to science. There are also games, puz­
zles, and quizzes for elementary school–age kids.
However, unlike the preceding sites, anyone can create a website with a 
clever, educational-sounding name and claim to provide a resource to stu­
dents. So how do you know which websites are both safe for your kids and 
worthwhile?

289
 Chapter 18: Reading, ’Riting, ’Rithmetic — Online?
Monitoring for difficulty level and content
One of the best places to begin when evaluating the educational websites 
your children would like to use is to take a close look at the difficulty level 
and content. Take a look at the sites that your child frequents and ask the 
following questions:
	
✓	Who is the educational authority behind the site? Many online learn­
ing and educational game sites claim to provide worksheets and games 
by grade or ability level. However, who is determining the level of the 
content posted? Look for websites from trusted educational authorities, 
such as state teaching associations, departments of education, and well-
known child development experts (such as PBS).
	
✓	Is the site monitored and updated? Avoid sites with outdated content. If 
the site contains a current topics or news section and none of the items 
are current, this is a good hint that perhaps the site’s content is not up 
to par.
	
✓	Is there a variety of content, or will your children quickly reach the site’s 
maximum potential? Some sites contain two or three fun games or applica­
tions but no other additional content with increasing difficulty level.
	
✓	Is the site accurate and well written? Read through some of the content 
and check for accuracy. If you find discrepancies in anything from spell­
ing to math problem answers, you know that the educational value of 
the site is low.
	
✓	Is the site’s appearance professional and is navigation easy? Although 
many educational sites may not appear as “clean,” uncluttered, and profes­
sional as websites aimed at an adult audience, it is still important that they 
appear clean and easy to use for your children to get the most out of them.
	
Ask your child’s teacher for a list of recommended websites. Your teacher will 
know your child’s ability level better than anyone and can likely recommend 
age- and ability-appropriate sites.
Many websites aimed at children contain a section specifically designed for 
parents. The best sites will use these sections to explain the sources of their 
online content as well as their credentials. For example, Figure 18-1 shows a 
popular children’s reading site, www.starfall.com. This page of the site 
explains to parents that the site’s research-based methods are modeled after 
the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.

Watching for advertising
Advertisers know that online education sites are a great way to access chil­
dren. When evaluating which websites are appropriate for your children, 
look at a variety of pages of content to watch for advertising aimed at your 
children. Ask the following questions:
	
✓	Does the site include pop-up ads?
	
✓	Does the site include advertorial (an advertisement in the form of an edi­
torial) and sponsored content within the educational content?
	
✓	Does the site contain advertisements that are not in line with the target 
age of the content?
Ideally, you want to find sites with as little advertising as possible with clear 
delineation between educational and advertising content.
	
One way to avoid advertisements aimed at your children while they are learn­
ing online is to select sites with a subscription fee — fees, not ads, cover site 
expenses.

291
 Chapter 18: Reading, ’Riting, ’Rithmetic — Online?
	
In Chapter 9, I cover online advertising to children, including how to spot 
advertisements hidden in special content.
Observing the graphics and sounds
The first aspects of a site that you will notice are the graphics and sounds. 
Many educational sites and games use animation and other graphics to 
engage your children in learning. Likewise, sites often use music and other 
sounds as part of their learning tools. However, the best educational sites 
will find an appropriate balance between engagement and distraction. Spend 
some time at the site that your child wants to use to see whether the graph­
ics and sounds used are appropriate or likely to simply overwhelm your 
young student.
Researching listed source information
As I mention earlier, many quality educational sites for children include lists 
of sources, regulating bodies and organizations with which they are associ­
ated, and information about author credentials. Some sites, such as National 
Geographic Kids, enjoy a brand recognition that immediately lets parents 
know the site is associated with a respected educational authority that pro­
vides educational and interesting content.
Most sites for kids, however, aren’t associated with an educational authority. 
To help determine whether a site your child enjoys is educationally sound, 
look for an About page or similar link to content sources and site ownership. 
Because this content exists for the comfort of parents (rather than the enjoy­
ment of kids), links to resources, sources, and site ownership are often found 
at the bottom of the site’s main page.
Then, you can try to research the organization to find out whether it is a 
trusted authority. Wonderopolis, for example, shares on its About page that 
the site is funded by philanthropic partners and created by the National 
Center for Family Literacy (NCFL; www.famlit.org). At the NCFL website, 
you can see that NCFL is a well-established literacy authority that uses volun­
teer hours of certified teachers.
If you can’t locate information about educational and research sources — or 
even site ownership or sponsorship on a site that your children would like 
to visit — you may want to suggest that your children visit a different site 
instead.

292
Part V: Utilizing Online Family Resources 
	
Parent information on children’s websites may seem hidden because the site’s 
audience is the child, not the adult. You may need to scroll to the bottom of 
the page and click various links before finding parent resources and privacy 
policies.
Educational Resources: Talking to Kids 
about Credible and Crediting
Kids as young as preschool age can benefit from visiting learning websites 
and downloading apps for entertainment and, through drills and games, gain 
educational substance and skills (such as identifying colors). Although you 
may think of educational sites and skill-building apps first when you consider 
the “Internet and learning,” many elementary and high school students rely 
on the Internet as a resource tool, turning to search engines for help when 
writing papers and creating presentations.
Helping children differentiate 
between resource sites
The Internet is an amazing resource for students, providing access to infor­
mation that previously could be found only during a visit to a library, if that. 
Of course, because there are just as many inaccurate sources available online 
as accurate, helping your kids locate the most reliable sources and distin­
guish between useful and untrustworthy sites is important.
Ask your children to answer the following questions when searching for infor­
mation online:
	
✓	Does the site contain user-generated content? Sites such as Wikipedia 
are populated with content created and submitted by users, who are (in 
many cases) not authorities on the topic.
	
✓	Does the site reference primary sources? Even websites that contain 
opinion pieces or secondary sources should reference and share pri­
mary sources that act as the basis for the other information on the site.
	
✓	Is the site up to date and current? Check whether the site includes 
dates for when the content was created as well as revision dates. If it’s 
difficult to decipher whether the information is updated or outdated, it’s 
time to walk away.

293
 Chapter 18: Reading, ’Riting, ’Rithmetic — Online?
	
✓	Is the site professional in its presentation? Show your kids how to rec­
ognize and avoid sites containing glaring spelling and grammar errors, 
links that don’t work, clutter, and lack of organization.
	
✓	What is the purpose of the site, and who funds or created the site? 
See whether its purpose is to provide information or to persuade. Sites 
meant to change opinions will likely present only one side of a story, 
and sometimes separating fact from opinion may be difficult.
	
✓	Who are the site authors? Just as you should check for credentials 
and affiliations when evaluating an educational website, always 
check author credentials and affiliated groups when evaluating online 
sources.
	
✓	What is the URL? Look for online addresses ending in .edu (affiliated 
with educational institutes) and .org (typically affiliated with organiza­
tions) and .gov (the government). Online businesses typically use 
.com and .net. Be sure to research the organization associated with 
the site.
Teaching kids proper crediting 
of online sources
A survey from Education Week (www.edweek.org) found that more than 
one-half of high school students surveyed admitted to copying and pasting 
directly from the Internet when completing assignments. Surely the Internet 
is a fantastic resource for students, but kids need to know how to cite all 
sources correctly, including Internet sources. Your kids will hopefully learn 
these guidelines in school, but take the time to reinforce these rules when 
helping your kids with their homework.
	
Some resource sites — such as World Book (www.worldbook.com) — pro­
vide students with a proper citation for their web page that can be copied and 
pasted into a student bibliography.
Your child might be asked to format references according to MLA (Modern 
Language Association) style (www.mla.org) or even possibly APA (the 
American Psychological Association; www.apastyle.org).
	
Remind your kids that they need to cite online sources, and properly.

294

Discovering Online Learning
Just as the world of education has merged with the online world in the form 
of educational websites for kids and online sources for students, the Internet 
has also entered the classroom. Traditional schools have integrated tech­
nology into their classrooms, and some institutions have even taken their 
courses online.
Evaluating online courses
The increase in availability of online courses makes it possible for teens to 
gain high school and college credit from home, often replacing basic require­
ments, such as summer school and general education classes. The problem 
for the digital family, however, is determining which courses are the most 
appropriate in a sea of options.
The best place to begin in selecting an online course is your child’s school. 
Most guidance departments and college advisors can point you in the right 
direction in the selection of the online educational institution as well as the 
selection of the most appropriate course.

295
 Chapter 18: Reading, ’Riting, ’Rithmetic — Online?
Also consider the following when choosing online coursework:
	
✓	What company or educational institution is offering the course? Many 
accredited colleges and universities also offer fully accredited online 
coursework. Selecting classes from respected and recognizable educa­
tional institutes provides you the assurance that the online course is 
legitimate. Likewise, many online universities have established them­
selves over time as respected and accredited sources for online course­
work. Be sure to research how long the organization has existed, what 
affiliations they can boast, and what accreditations they hold.
	
✓	Will the course fulfill a class requirement? Many students take online 
courses to fulfill a requirement necessary for graduation or to achieve 
a degree. Be certain to confirm with your child’s school that the chosen 
online course actually fulfills that requirement before registering and 
paying for the course.
	
✓	Does the institution hold a regional or a national accreditation? 
Accreditation simply means that the school has been evaluated by 
regulating bodies and education authorities stating that the school is 
offering quality coursework. Some schools choose to seek accredita­
tion from one of six regional accreditation agencies, all of which are 
recognized by the U.S. Department of Education as well as the Council 
for Higher Education Accreditation. National accreditation is generally 
based on the type of school (such as distance or technology learning) 
rather than on the geographical location of the school. Some programs 
also seek specialized accreditation, such as medical and law programs. 
Accreditation may be a concern if your child wishes to transfer credits 
in the future or apply online coursework to a degree program.
	
✓	Will your child have access to a teacher or professor? Some students 
thrive when given the opportunity to complete coursework online, but 
many students need the supervision and structure of a traditional class­
room setting. Before enrolling your child in an online course, find out 
what access your child will have to their teacher including how your 
child’s questions will be answered and what progress checks are stan­
dard during the course of the classwork.
	
Check with your child’s school before selecting an online course. Ensure that 
the course will count toward a diploma or degree.
Recognizing the digital role 
of your traditional school
Many schools have integrated technology and the Internet into their daily 
routines. Elementary teachers often use educational websites to provide 

296
Part V: Utilizing Online Family Resources 
extra practice of skills they’re teaching in class and sometimes even require 
use of these sites as part of homework assignments. Many classrooms 
are also now equipped with SMART Boards (http://smarttech.com/
smartboard), which are interactive white boards that help teachers create 
dynamic lessons that integrate technology.
Chances are that your child’s school may expect a certain level of techno­
logical understanding from you as the parent of one of their students. Some 
examples of this may include
	
✓	Communication with teachers via e-mail
	
✓	Placement of the class syllabus online
	
✓	Announcement of school-wide messages on a listserve, website, or 
password-protected school forum
	
✓	Communication in the case of emergencies via text or online message
	
✓	Access to class-wide projects online
	
✓	Use of the Internet for homework assignments
	
✓	Reading of parent newsletters online or in PDF rather than paper
	
✓	Use of school-provided devices
Device usage in schools
In Chapter 5, I talk about school technology use policies, encouraging you to 
locate the policy for your child’s school. Similarly, in Chapter 17, I discuss 
finding out whether your child’s school allows mobile devices on property 
before sending your child to school with a cellphone. Some schools are 
now implementing a BYOD (bring your own device) policy because as 
they implement technology in daily instruction more and more, school 
are often also facing budget concerns. So, some schools now ask kids 
to bring their Internet-enabled devices (from smartphones to laptops) to 
school with them.
If your child’s school has implemented a BYOD or similar program, be sure 
to find out what the school’s policy is regarding the device throughout the 
day. Is your child allowed to keep that device with them all day or only in cer­
tain classrooms? Is your child allowed to use that device all the time or only 
during certain lessons?

297
 Chapter 18: Reading, ’Riting, ’Rithmetic — Online?
Some schools do have the budget to provide students with tablets and lap­
tops to use in class or to check out from the school library or computer lab. 
If your child’s school allows students to borrow devices, find out answers to 
the following questions:
	
✓	How long is your child allowed to borrow that device?
	
✓	What is the charge for returning the device late?
	
✓	Who is responsible for the replacement of the device if something 
happens to it on school property?
	
✓	Who is responsible for the replacement of the device if something 
happens to it while the child is using the device at home?
Connecting with your child’s 
classroom online
Many teachers use technology not only in lesson planning but also when 
giving those lessons as well as communicating with parents and students 
outside the classroom. Just as parents are expected to keep track of school 
calendars and school requirements for everything from paperwork to immu­
nizations, many schools now expect parents to facilitate their child’s access 
to online materials and information.
	
Most school systems now allow parents to check their children’s grades 
online. Be sure to inquire with your child’s school.
And school websites are one common place where traditional schools have 
moved into the digital age. Many schools now use a website to communicate 
with the parent community, including posting policy changes and school 
calendars (see Figure 18-2), and many teachers also maintain websites for 
the following:
	
✓	Posting curriculum or the class syllabus
	
✓	Maintaining a classroom calendar with assignment deadlines
	
✓	Taking and responding to student questions
	
✓	Hosting interactive class-wide projects
	
✓	Posting password-protected access to grades and progress reports
	
✓	Highlighting student work
	
✓	Sharing supplementary content or extra credit activities

Another online location where teachers can connect with students and 
parents is Edmodo (www.edmodo.com). This platform allows teachers to 
manage their classroom online — everything from assignments to grades — 
via a password-protected website. And students can interact with their class­
mates and their teacher within their teacher’s Edmodo community.
	
Your traditional school may be more tech-savvy than you realize! Connect 
with your children’s teachers to find out how they are using technology to 
teach the “digital natives” in their classrooms.

aising a family in the digital age brings with it challenges that are con­
stantly changing, forcing parents to stay up to date with the current 
technology and potential dangers. However, as a parent or caregiver, you can 
find an amazing wealth of resources to not only help you raise your children 
but also manage nearly every aspect of your daily life.
Orchestrating Life
Online tools and downloadable apps are available for everything from potty 
training to chore chart creation. Some resources specialize in one particular 
area of family management, and many others help with a variety of needs 
within one site or application.
The following are a snapshot of the types of online tools available for parents, 
highlighting some of the ways how this digital age has made parenting easier 
than ever:
	
✓	Springpad (www.springpad.com) enables families to create online note­
books where they can collect everything from favorite recipes to family 
photos. Rather than simply collect your information, this digital tool’s 
enhanced capabilities include other features, such as a map to a favorite 
restaurant or show times for a movie the family wants to see. What makes 
Springpad and similar services great for families is your ability to share 
your notebooks with friends and family. Parents can collaborate on family 
vacations or projects and access them anywhere via the Internet.

300
Part V: Utilizing Online Family Resources 
	
✓	Remember the Milk (www.rememberthemilk.com) helps the digital 
family organize lists and projects, which enables families to create and 
organize tasks. You can use this app to create task lists from bill paying 
to child pick-up as well as add tools you need to make those tasks easier 
(such as maps to task locations). You can share the task with other 
family members and share duties as well as prioritize jobs and add tasks 
to shared family calendars.
	
✓	Intuition, Mom’s Assistant bills itself as a “personal assistant for moms,” 
helping moms to organize everything from to-do lists to wish lists. This 
family management app doesn’t focus on simply one area (say, grocery 
lists or tasks) but allows you to integrate as many aspects of your life as 
you choose by offering an Everything Else category. Users can sync with 
existing iCal or Google calendars. You can read more about this app at 
www.iconapps.com.
	
✓	Cozi (www.cozi.com) is another app that chooses to tackle every 
aspect of family management rather than focusing on simply one area. 
With the Cozi app, you can manage your family’s calendar, which your 
entire family can access, sending appointment reminders and even get­
ting week long agendas delivered to family inboxes. Cozi also allows 
you to sync your Cozi calendar to other calendars, such as Microsoft 
Outlook or Google Calendars. This online organizer offers
 
• Family calendar
 
• Shopping lists
 
• To-do lists
 
• Family journal
 
• Meal planner
	
✓	AboutOne is a family management system that not only helps you orga­
nize your online task lists and calendars, but also provides you with 
a way to organize offline information, such as pet records, receipts, 
and car maintenance. Unlike some other family management products, 
AboutOne uniquely focuses on its incredibly high level of security assur­
ance, helping digital families reduce paper clutter by storing paperwork 
and receipts in a safe and secure online location. AboutOne offers a 
complete system for families looking to move beyond a shared family 
calendar and task lists to actually digitize every aspect of their lives. 
You can find more about AboutOne at www.aboutone.com.
	
✓	Famundo (www.famundo.com) is a free service to help simplify family 
schedules. This online calendar service provides a social network of 
sorts for families, allowing you to send messages to family, friends, and 
anyone connected to your family hub. You can use Famundo to upload 
and share photos, lists, and blogs with family and friends while also 
creating and sharing a schedule. Famundo also offers services to orga­
nizations (such as schools and churches), but the tools included in the 
service are very useful to busy families trying to stay connected online.

301
 Chapter 19: Managing Your Family with Digital Resources
	
✓	Famjama is very similar to other online family management tools that 
enable you to create and share shopping lists, schedules, and to-do lists. 
Famjama, found at www.famjama.com, enables you to connect existing 
online calendars as well as e-mail accounts, making it easy to share calen­
dar events and message your entire family via the service. A unique fea­
ture of Famjama is its connection to a coupon service, allowing you to add 
items to your shopping list and locate related coupons all from one app.
	
✓	Google Calendars (www.google.com/calendar) is a free service with 
which you can create calendars linked to your Google account. You can 
share individual calendars with family members as well as receive cal­
endar notifications on your mobile device. You can also provide editing 
access to calendars, allowing multiple members of the family to edit the 
same family calendar.
Here are some tools that help you manage a specific aspect of family life:
	
✓	Babysitters: Care.com (www.care.com) and Sittercity (www.
sittercity.com)
	
✓	Family party planning and invitations: Evite (http://new.evite.
com) and Paperless Post (www.paperlesspost.com)
	
✓	Playdates: RedRover (www.redroverapp.com)
	
✓	Family packing tool: Baby Pack & Go (www.babypackandgo.com)
Planning Family Meals
One popular area where many parents have turned to their computers for 
help is planning family meals. The following services are some popular sites 
for families hoping to save time and money while finding inspiration for their 
meal planning:
	
✓	Plan to Eat (www.plantoeat.com) enables users to collect favorite reci­
pes in one location, organize and share the recipes, and even download 
and print them. After you load and organize recipes on your account, just 
drag and drop them into a weekly meal planner. Then, you can create a 
shopping list based on the recipes in your weekly meal plan. Just open your 
shopping list via your mobile phone to follow while at the grocery store.
	
✓	ZipList (www.ziplist.com) is a tool for digital families to create shop­
ping lists, collect recipes, and locate grocery savings. Families can use 
ZipList to save favorite shopping lists, such as those created for a spe­
cial meal or holiday gathering. The free mobile app that accompanies 
ZipList allows users to access their recipe box and shopping lists while 
in the store. Like Plan to Eat, ZipList also allows users to create meal 
plans that use your saved recipes and grocery lists. And similar to the 

302
Part V: Utilizing Online Family Resources 
family management tool Famjama (earlier in this chapter), ZipList also 
provides access to sales on grocery items, acting as a shopping circular, 
integrated into your family’s meal planning.
	
✓	Allrecipes.com users can create a recipe box containing their favorite 
recipes from around the site, create a menu planner, or use existing site-
created plans, and create shopping lists based on saved recipes. One fun 
aspect of this site is the feedback on uploaded recipes. Users try recipes 
and then return to provide a rating as well as suggestions to make the 
recipe better. The site also allows families to change serving sizes — 
automatically adjusting the recipe to accommodate the change — which 
is great for large families with more mouths to feed as well as families on 
their way to an empty nest looking to have fewer leftovers after meals. 
You can learn more about this free service at www.allrecipes.com.
	
✓	KeepRecipes (www.keeprecipes.com) combines some of the recipe 
collection capabilities of the other tools I mention here with the feel of 
a social network. Users can locate recipes and collect them in an online 
cookbook, but they can also take photos of their completed meals and 
share them with friends. KeepRecipes calls this function their Social 
Recipe Box. KeepRecipes users may also choose to follow other users 
according to their interest or because of another social media connection.
	
✓	Epicurious is far more than a meal planning site for families, with arti­
cles, online communities, and even a shopping function. It also includes 
a recipe box where users can create a profile and collect favorite reci­
pes. Like many other recipe and meal planning sites, Epicurious users 
can download their recipe box and create shopping lists based on favor­
ite recipes. Learn more at www.epicurious.com.
Purchasing Essentials
So, you used online family management tools to organize your family’s cal­
endar for the week and visited your favorite meal planning site to create the 
week’s meal plan. You clipped your coupons, and your grocery list is ready 
to go on your mobile device. Grab the keys and. . . . Wait a moment. Do you 
really even need to leave your home to stock your pantry?
The emergence of online grocery and home essentials shopping services 
is another wonderful benefit of raising a digital family. Check out these ser­
vices, which allow you to purchase groceries and other necessities from 
home, some even delivering them to your door for a small fee.
	
✓	Alice (www.alice.com) vows to keep your busy digital family from ever 
running out of essentials. Users can create a shopping list of everyday 
items and indicate how often they would like these items replaced. Items 

303
 Chapter 19: Managing Your Family with Digital Resources
are then automatically ordered in the allotted time interval and 
delivered to your home. Other helpful features include the ability to 
search by deals, browse green and organic products, and even shop 
by room.
	
✓	Peapod is an online grocery delivery service although it’s available 
only in specific service areas. This service allows users to create and 
save shopping lists and have their groceries delivered to their homes. 
Users can even order their groceries from their mobile device (yup, 
there’s an app for that) and have them delivered. Learn more at www.
peapod.com.
	
✓	Amazon Grocer (www.amazongrocer.com) provides online shoppers

• Snacks, cookies, and candy
 
• Household supplies
	
✓	NetGrocer (www.netgrocer.com) delivers groceries nationwide via 
FedEx. Users can create and save shopping lists as well as recurring 
orders. Like the other online grocery sites, NetGrocer also provides 
users easy access to weekly specials via their site as well as specific 
shopping categories, such as health and beauty and organic.
Budgeting Online
Some families may find that the most useful aspect of living in a world with 
nearly endless online tools means being able to budget for the family with 
these tools. The following three online services offer families a way to 
organize family expenses online, sharing access to secure accounts and 
eliminating some of the paper clutter that overwhelms many families:
	
✓	Mint (www.mint.com) is a service that lets you organize all your 
financial accounts in one location, create a budget, and track goals. 
The free mobile app connected to Mint.com allows account holders 
to access their financial information in one place via their mobile 
devices. Families can use Mint.com to set family goals, such as 
vacations or purchases for the home, and then track the progress 
toward this goal.

304
Part V: Utilizing Online Family Resources 
	
✓	Manilla allows families to securely upload all financial information in 
one location for free. From your home computer or mobile device, you 
can use Manilla (www.manilla.com) to create bill pay reminders, 
manage online accounts, and organize paperless statements.
	
✓	PearBudget focuses on budget creation and after a 30-day free trial is

Before entering any sensitive financial information, verify that the site is 
secure by looking for an https URL, a lock icon in the URL or lower-right 
hand corner of your browser, or by checking the properties of the site to 
verify encryption.

Chapter 20
Ten Quick Tips for Parents
A

fter you create your Digital Family Policy (see Chapter 2) and set clear 
rules for every aspect of your family’s fast-paced, plugged-in life, it’s 
time to take a step back and look at how to continue to promote digital safety 
within your family without having to revisit each step of your family’s in-depth 
policy. In this over-connected world, you want to find ways to enjoy the com­
pany of your loved ones without power cords, screens, and Wi-Fi.
These ten tips are designed to be used independently of the other tips through­
out this book as well as independently of each other. Some are helpful reminders 
for parents, while others are action items to keep your digital family on track.
Always Pay Attention
Being aware of the dangers of the digital life and creating a Digital Family 
Policy are just the first steps. Paying close attention to when and where your 
kids are plugged in, what they’re doing online, and what media they are being 
exposed to is critical not only to enforce your policies, but also to be aware 
of changes. Continue to pay attention to changes in the technology used in 
your home, such as updates to privacy policies and automatic download 
updates to gaming systems.
Also, watch for cues from your children that might indicate areas of concern 
such as potential exposure to an online predator or harassment from a cyber­
bully. By being aware of changes in your child’s behavior and digital habits, 
you may realize that an issue needs to be discussed.
Be a Good Digital Role Model
The reason why this book refers to digital families — and not just digital 
children — is adults also live in this incredibly plugged-in world. Kids are 
keen observers of the world around them and are often the first to notice 
when parents appear to be connected to a smartphone, tablet, or laptop. 

308
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Kids who are Friends with their parents on Facebook also have the opportu­
nity to observe how their parents interact with friends, share information, 
and discuss personal topics.
Set a good example for your children by being a good digital role model your­
self. Would you like to clean up your social media language? Are you trying to 
cut down on complaining about work in status updates? You may even want 
to include notes in your Digital Family Policy addressing digital best prac­
tices that you will also aim to follow!
Focus on Safety
Although many digital etiquette issues concern parents, safety concerns 
certainly take precedent over such issues as gaming time, posting silly pic­
tures on social media, or purchasing a download without permission. When 
creating guidelines for your digital family, including crafting or revising your 
Digital Family Policy, always keep safety at the forefront of your decision 
making. Some examples include sharing of identifying information or agree­
ing to meet an online friend in real life. Allowing safety concerns to inform 
all decisions will help you set guidelines that protect your children in many 
other areas. Check out Chapter 3 for extensive coverage of safety concerns in 
the digital world.
Spotlight Public versus Private
Focus on public versus private when discussing best practices to guide 
your children when sharing info (and anything else) online. Children should 
constantly consider what’s appropriate to share publicly when using social 
media (including YouTube), playing online games, interacting with requests 
for information, and even chatting with friends. Remind your children — 
often — what information is okay to share publicly and what to always keep 
private (such as a Social Security number).
Take the Time to Establish Limits
Yes, creating a detailed Digital Family Policy is a time-consuming task. Setting 
vague guidelines for your children about how much screen time is too much 
or what information is too personal to share publicly is taking the easy road. 
Without clear limits, children have no way to know when a (digital) behavior is 

309
 Chapter 20: Ten Quick Tips for Parents
crossing a line. And you can’t enforce consequences without clear guidelines. 
Rather than writing a nonspecific policy that says “Don’t watch too much tele­
vision,” for example, specify exactly how many hours of television viewing can 
occur in a week. When time is up, time is up — without question — making 
enforcement much easier for parents.
Enforce Accountability
When clear limits are established, parents can ask children to hold them­
selves accountable. For example, creating a rule that game consoles can be 
used only on the weekends is easy to remember, simple to follow, and easy 
to enforce. Sure, you can use programs to monitor device use and change 
Parental Controls and settings, but let your children know that they’re in 
charge of monitoring their behavior as well. This teaches your children 
responsibility, shows that you trust them to follow the guidelines set for 
your family, and makes any necessary punishment a consequence of their 
own actions.
	
Be consistent about enforcing consequences if rules are broken so your kids 
understand that the Digital Family Policy is meant to be followed.
Use Available Resources
Don’t feel like you have to navigate the digital world alone! A huge variety of 
products and resources are available to help you create your Digital Family 
Policy and establish safe boundaries for your kids on the devices and appli­
cations they use. Each day, new resources appear online and in stores. Be 
sure to check often for new monitoring and protection tools and plans as well 
as informational resources to guide you through emerging technology and 
changes to devices your kids already use.
Communicate with Your Kids Offline
Many parents use texting, instant messaging, and even social media plat­
forms (such as Twitter and Facebook) to communicate with their children. 
Make sure to also set aside time to communicate often with your children 
offline. Certain aspects of communication — facial expressions and body 
language — don’t exist or translate well in digital communication. To more 
easily protect your children online, be sure to spend time communicating 
with them offline — nothing beats face-time.

310
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Encourage “Unplugged” Time
Setting limits for screen time is a great start, but don’t forget to encourage 
unplugged time as well. Encourage your children to go on a family outing 
without a smartphone, MP3 player, or tablet for in the car. Try a TV-free day 
or even take an entire weekend to unplug and just enjoy the nondigital life. 
Make this unplugged time a special treat rather than a punishment to be 
endured. Be sure to follow your own advice and unplug as well. Point out to 
your children that it’s okay to experience life without documenting every 
second of it online.
Join Them!
If you can’t beat ’em, join ’em! One way to understand the digital world in 
which your children live is to join them there. Make time to learn to play 
their favorite video games, Friend them on Facebook, and visit their favorite 
social gaming platforms. Not only will this give you time together as a family, 
but you’ll be better able to understand both the pitfalls and the highlights of 
each aspect of their digital lives.

Chapter 21
Ten Social Networks for Kids
W

ith social media infiltrating nearly every aspect of the Internet (and 
our daily lives), it’s no surprise that you can easily find social net­
works created specifically for children. These sites typically mimic adult plat­
forms (with account profiles, gaming options, and even chat functions), but 
they do tend to offer more privacy options and kid-friendly themes.
	
Even though the platforms I mention in this chapter are designed for children, 
you should still visit each site and get to know its features before allowing 
your children to play on their own. Also pay close attention to how each site 
protects privacy before you allow your child to create an account. Look for 
sites that adhere to the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA; 
www.coppa.org/comply.htm), which regulates the types of information 
online sites can collect from children. Finally, find out how other users may 
interact with your child before allowing them to have unsupervised time on 
these networks.
Club Penguin
www.clubpenguin.com
Perhaps the most well-known of the social networks for kids, Disney’s Club 
Penguin is a massively multiplayer online game (MMOG) site for children. 
The game play is moderated at all times, and parental consent is required 
before children can join the site. Children may play at Club Penguin for free 
or upgrade to (and pay for) membership, which begins at $5 per month and 
offers a few more features:
	
✓	Unlimited access to member-only areas
	
✓	Exclusive gifts at special events
	
✓	Style your penguin character with new outfits
	
✓	Upgrade and decorate your igloo, your home on Club Penguin
	
✓	Adopt up to 20 puffles (Club Penguin pets) in any color
Children need their parents’ e-mail address to create an account at Club Penguin.

312
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
To activate a new account, parents click an activation code that arrives by 
e-mail. Clicking the link takes you to the site, where you can set a chat option 
for your child:
	
✓	Standard Safe Chat: Players type their own messages. The Club Penguin 
word filter and moderators stop the use of inappropriate language and 
personal information sharing.
	
✓	Ultimate Safe Chat: Players can choose only from a set menu of phrases 
and see other Ultimate Safe Chat messages.
In the Parents section of Club Penguin, parents can create their own password-
protected access to their child’s Club Penguin account. There, you can see 
your child’s account activity, edit chat settings, and set a play timer.
ScuttlePad
www.scuttlepad.com
ScuttlePad is a free social networking site designed for kids ages 6 to 11. 
Much like Facebook, users can upload photos and update their status, but 
status updates and comments can include words only from an approved 
list. Images uploaded are all manually reviewed before they may appear on 
the user’s account. There is currently no advertising on this site. ScuttlePad 
teaches kids the basics of social networking but doesn’t have any extra 
games, activities, or applications like many adult social networking sites.
ScuttlePad provides kids with the chance to learn the basics of social media, 
but it doesn’t contain much else to entertain kids or hold their attention. Still, 
it’s a great resource for parents looking to teach their children about social 
media without exposing them to too much content or allowing them unsuper­
vised interaction.
Webkinz
www.webkinz.com
Webkinz is one of the first online worlds created primarily for children. The 
site connects the offline and online worlds by providing an online code with 
every stuffed animal that Webkinz has sold. Kids can type these codes into 
the online site to play with the virtual version of their stuffed animal.
This site includes a Parents Area where parents can manage their children’s 
use of chat, limit time spent on the site, and even turn off third-party adver­
tisements. In addition to the many games and activities available for free on 

313
 Chapter 21: Ten Social Networks for Kids
Webkinz.com, there are also opportunities to purchase virtual goods — so 
you may want to include a rule in your Digital Family Policy about whether 
your child is permitted to spend real money on virtual products. Note: This 
incredibly popular site is used by adults as well as children.
YourCause
www.yourcause.com
This platform is more than just a social networking tool for teens. YourCause 
allows kids to raise money for a favorite charity while Friending other 
account holders, sending e-mail, and posting testimonials. This site is free 
for a basic account. Account holders must be 13 years or older to create an 
account and may choose from a list of pre-approved nonprofits. The user 
then creates a page and asks people to visit and make charitable donations. 
Account holders can choose from more than 1.5 million available charities.
Sweety High
www.sweetyhigh.com
Sweety High is a social network for girls age 10 and older. All members younger 
than 13 must have parent-verified accounts, though, and parents of those users 
are given parent access to those accounts. This site is carefully moderated 
with strong privacy settings. Member profiles are visible to member friends 
only. User-generated content is moderated, as are comments from other 
“Sweeties.” The themes of this site rely heavily on style, fashion, and celebrity.
Parent tools on Sweety High encourage parents to help their daughters 
become “Savvy Sweeties.” This includes talking to your daughter about such 
issues as keeping private information private and bullying. Because Sweety 
High is a closed community, nonmembers cannot access or view profiles, 
photos, or user-generated content.
Yoursphere
https://yoursphere.com
This social networking site (for children age 17 and younger) includes a virtual 
world where kids can play games, participate in shared interest “spheres,” 
write their own blog, and earn credits for positive interactions. Yoursphere

Part VI: The Part of Tens 
members that positively contribute to the community can redeem the credits 
in the Gift Gallery for music, electronics, magazines, and more. Users can also 
play hundreds of games and interact within a virtual world.
Yoursphere strictly adheres to its membership rules and even compares 
account requests against a database of registered sex offenders. The staff 
at Yoursphere has teens who help ensure that the content is relevant to its 
teen users, but also includes a Law Enforcement Task Force to advise the 
site on how to best protect its users.
Additionally, Yoursphere includes a resource site for parents at www.
internet-safety.yoursphere.com. This site includes information 
about topics (such as cyberbullying), offers tutorials, and recommends 
products. Content is updated regularly and walks parents through a variety 
of technology related parenting concerns.
Both parents and kids can create an account on Yoursphere. That way, 
parents can monitor what their child is doing.
Fanlala
http://www.fanlala.com
Formerly called Imbee, Fanlala is a social media platform for kids ages 8 to 14 
with a focus on entertainment and popular culture. Content and activities are 
geared toward tweens, though. Fanlala creates its own web-based shows and 
specials, but account holders may also upload their own photos and videos, 
chat with other account-holding friends, and join groups.
Only parents can create a Fanlala account for a child. You also are in charge 
of the security settings, so be sure to set age-appropriate parameters. Fanlala 
provides a base account for free but requires a $1 parental credit card 
verification.
Fanlala also includes a chat feature allowing Fanlala users to chat with other 
users in real time. To chat with an account holder, you must be “Friends” 
with that account holder. These chats are not moderated, and users can 
create their own content during these interactions.
Unlike some children’s social media platforms that focus on learning the 
ins and outs of social networking, Fanlala is very content driven and does 
include quite a bit of advertising with a heavy focus on celebrities and pop 
culture. Parents may want to supervise their children to be sure that the con­
tent they are viewing is appropriate.

 Chapter 21: Ten Social Networks for Kids
giantHello
www.gianthello.com
giantHello (formerly, FaceChipz) is a social network for tweens and teens 
(ages 7 to 17) patterned off Facebook with a heavy focus on gaming. Friending 
another member allows account holders to send private messages to that 
user and see the content that they’ve created, including comments on other 
accounts, group activity, status updates, and uploaded photos.
To “Friend” another account holder on giantHello, users must e-mail their 
friends or print an invitation code to give them in real life. Accounts must 
be verified by parents via a small credit card charge or by providing the last 
four digits of their Social Security number.
The games section of the site is available to the public without a required 
registration. This section of the site includes advertisements but also question­
able content, such as games with violent and sexual themes. Even though this 
platform is open to the public, registered tween users cannot be contacted by 
strangers, nor can they contact strangers through their account.
When creating the social networking section of your Digital Family Policy, 
be sure to discuss the varying functions of giantHello and set specific rules 
regarding which features may be accessed.
Everloop
www.everloop.com
Everloop was designed specifically for kids ages 8 to 13 although kids 
younger than 8 and as old as 15 may join. Account holders can create a 
custom profile, including changeable background images, color schemes, and 
stickers. In the Everloop chat function, users can interact in real time through 
instant messaging and chats within their approved loops. The site also con­
tains the Everloop Arcade that contains more than 1,500 games. Account 
holders can also earn credits that allow them to purchase virtual items, such 
as premium stickers for their profile page.
Everloop is different than other social networking sites in that it contains 
“looping” technology, which allows kids to locate what interests them, such 
as sports or fan groups, and then share those interests by joining loops. 
Within loops, they can share photos and information. Before kids are allowed 
to participate in loops, parents must give their approval. Everloop contains 

316
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
user-created loops but also partners with a variety of educational and enter­
tainment partners to create branded loops: National Geographic, Mattel, and 
Monster High are some partners.
Other features can be accessed only after parents have approved the account. 
For parents concerned with bullying and bad language, Everloop promises to 
filter both chats and posts as well as screen uploaded videos and photos. Not 
only does the Everloop staff monitor these messages, but kids can flag upsetting 
or bothersome site content.
For even greater monitoring, parents can create their own account and 
receive notifications about their children’s actions on the site. Parents can 
also control the permission settings for their children’s account including 
whether or not their children may participate in chats and whether their 
children can send messages through Everloop to their friends.
Jabbersmack
www.jabbersmack.com
Jabbersmack (formerly Kidsocial), calls itself a “social entertainment network” 
and provides branded content and entertainment pages as well as access to 
streaming content. The site also allows kids to interact with friends and play 
social games. This site is open to kids of all ages, but kids younger than 13 must 
have parent approval to have an account. Parents may also monitor their child’s 
account via a parent account.
Many of the branded pages on Jabbersmack will be familiar to parents. Content 
from Grooveshark, Zynga, YouTube, Playmobil, and more is presented through 
Jabbersmack after being filtered for inappropriate content.
Jabbersmack allows kids under 13 to connect with real-world friends only 
through friendship codes. When children are invited to connect, parents 
are notified. Pages created by account holders under 13 are never visible to 
strangers. Users over 13 can join and connect with new Friends, much like 
Facebook users.
Unlike some social networking sites for kids, Jabbersmack doesn’t have a 
maximum age requirement and adults can create accounts and interact with 
teens. You may want to discuss this public interaction with your children 
before allowing them to create an account.

Chapter 22
Ten Other Places Your Kids 
Might Be Online
T

witter and Facebook continue to reign as the top social media sites, 
Google holds its place as the number one search engine, and YouTube is 
all-powerful in the land of video sharing, but many other online locations are 
incredibly popular with teens. If your kids aren’t already familiar with these 
platforms, chances are that they will be soon. They are definitely worth getting 
to know and discussing in your family when creating or updating your Digital 
Family Policy, and many of these platforms offer a great opportunity to discuss 
appropriate versus inappropriate content and private versus public.
Pinterest
http://pinterest.com
Pinterest is the third-largest social media platform (only behind Facebook 
and Twitter). The Pinterest mission is “to connect everyone in the world 
through the ‘things’ they find interesting.”
A virtual pinboard, account holders use Pinterest to organize and share items 
found on the Internet by “pinning” an image or graphic from the web loca­
tion. Pinterest account holders use pinboards to plan projects, share favorite 
recipes, collect beautiful pictures, organize vacation ideas, and more. Pins 
from other users are searchable, and many account holders browse public 
pinboards to re-pin images of interest. Users add pins to pinboards via a Pin 
It button on their web browser toolbar, a phone app, or a plug-in from the 
site they’re pinning.
Pinterest accounts are free, and new users can use current social media 
accounts to sign up. Users need to be 13 or older and agree to this when 
accepting the terms of service.

318
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
After you create your Pinterest account (by Facebook, Twitter, or e-mail 
account), you can customize your username, bio, profile picture, how you 
share pins via Facebook, e-mail notification preferences, and privacy set­
tings. To hide your privacy settings, open the drop-down menu next to your 
account name (upper right of the screen), and choose Settings➪Hide Your 
Pinterest Profile from Search Engines➪On.
	
You can’t, however, make a pinboard private.
Pinterest asks that account holders follow Pin Etiquette, which includes 
being respectful and crediting sources. If your teen is interested in joining 
Pinterest, use this opportunity to discuss items in your Digital Family Policy, 
such as copyright and appropriate images to share publicly. Also discuss 
with your teens that although you can hide pinboards from search engines, 
you can’t hide pins from users browsing Pinterest pinboards. Pinterest users 
should assume that everything they pin is public and may be shared.
Google+
https:/plus.google.com
Created in the summer of 2011, Google+ is a social network created and 
owned by Google. Google+ is open to anyone age 13 or older and is accessed 
via a free Google account. Google+ users may post in their “stream,” much 
like a Facebook or Twitter status update. They can also use “circles” to orga­
nize their contacts into groups, such as friends, family, and acquaintances. 
Users may add a contact to more than one circle — say, a circle called “High 
School Friends” and another called “Friends.”
Google+ also includes the Hangout social feature, where group chats, includ­
ing chats with video, may be held. To join a Hangout, users must know the 
unique URL assigned to that event. You can also communicate instantly with 
people in your circles via a Messenger function, and share photos.
Because of the variety of ways to use Google+, the possibilities are nearly 
endless. Some teachers use Google+ Hangouts as a way to share homework 
information and a place for teens to collaborate on assignments. Sports and 
extra-curricular activities can use Google+ circles as a way to share informa­
tion, calendars, and messages.
If your teen is using Google+, discuss those online privacy settings. Unless 
you change your Google+ account settings, your profile is visible to the 
public. The default settings for teen Google+ account holders are different 
than the default settings for account holders over age 18, and teens can over­
ride these settings.

319
 Chapter 22: Ten Other Places Your Kids Might Be Online
To change your Google+ privacy settings, sign in to your Google+ account, 
click your account image in the upper right, and then click the Privacy link. 
On the Profile and Privacy page that appears, click the Edit Visibility on 
Profile button next to Public Profile Information. Next to each item in your 
Google+ profile, select the globe icon to edit the visibility for that aspect of 
your profile. Click Done Editing to save your changes.
	
You can’t hide the following information from being public: Full Name, Brief 
Description, Gender, and Profile photo.
Ning
www.ning.com
Unlike other social media platforms where users create profiles, Ning allows 
users to also create what Ning calls “social websites.” Ning site creators can 
make site design changes, add members to their social website’s community, 
generate content, connect to other social media platforms, and even use their 
Ning to earn money. Pricing begins at $25 per month for Ning users who want 
to create their own site. However, you can have a free Ning account in which 
you can be a member of Ning social websites created by other users.
After you join a Ning site, you can change aspects of your profile (such as 
profile picture, gender, location, and website). Ning users need to be at least 
13 years old.
Schools, clubs, and other groups use Ning as a way to share information and 
chat with other members, but Facebook groups and school-owned forums 
are the most popular vehicles.
Foursquare
https://foursquare.com
Foursquare is a social media tool that allows users to share the places 
they’ve visited. Foursquare easily connects to other social media platforms, 
such as Facebook and Twitter, allowing users to share their locations and 
thoughts about those locations across platforms.
After you create a Foursquare profile online (you do need an e-mail or a 
Facebook account), download the free app to your smartphone to check in 
to locations. When checking in, you can add information about the location, 

320
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
including tips and reviews for others. You can also use Foursquare check-
ins to earn social media badges as well as tangible rewards such as coupon 
codes and free offers.
For many parents, Foursquare creates a variety of privacy concerns because 
users allow the public to see their current location. This is also a concern to 
parents, out and about with small children, checking in publicly to places like 
stores, restaurants, and parks.
You can still use Foursquare while protecting your privacy:
	
✓	Friend Requests: Users who want to find your check-in history must 
request to be your Friend on Foursquare — and you must approve 
this request.
	
✓	Private Check-Ins: You can opt for a Private Check-In, which allows you 
to add a place to your check-in history while keeping that check-in com­
pletely private, even from Friends. You can still earn points and badges 
without sharing your location.
	
✓	Disabling Sharing: Foursquare accounts can be connected to Twitter 
and Facebook, or you can disable these settings to keep check-ins from 
being shared with those audiences as well as their Foursquare Friends. 
To choose sharing settings, log in to your profile and then
 
a. From the drop-down menu in the upper right, choose Settings.
 
b. On the Settings page that opens, select Sharing with Other Networks 
(from list on the right) and set whether to connect your Foursquare 
account to Facebook and Twitter.
	
✓	Customize Privacy Settings: Follow the steps for setting sharing, but go 
in to the Privacy Settings (list on the right) and make changes.
Vimeo
http://vimeo.com
Vimeo is a video-sharing platform where users can upload and search video 
content for free. Account holders may also upgrade to Vimeo Plus or Vimeo PRO 
for a monthly fee. Like other social media–based platforms, Vimeo includes a 
community feature beyond its video-hosting capabilities, but participation in 
that community is not required to upload or search the video content on Vimeo. 
Social engagement on Vimeo includes liking video content, leaving comments on 
videos, following Vimeo users, and participating in Community Forums.

321
 Chapter 22: Ten Other Places Your Kids Might Be Online
	
Vimeo content restrictions prohibit sexually explicit material but do allow 
nonsexual nudity. Vimeo content filters do not restrict videos that contain 
nudity. Because of the type of content available on Vimeo and the lack of site-
run filters to make the site child-friendly, you may want to restrict access to 
Vimeo in your home or include other Vimeo-related guidelines in your Digital 
Family Policy.
Ustream
http://www.ustream.tv
Ustream is a free platform that allows users to create live broadcasts of 
events. The largest live streaming platform, Ustream broadcasts commer­
cially produced content as well as user-generated content. Ustream users 
can search the site by subject and keyword for content or use a provided link 
to go directly to a live broadcast or event. Ustream events also allow you to 
participate in a chat via a chat window while watching the live video content. 
The chat platform allows users to connect their chat to their existing social 
media accounts to share their Ustream participation across those platforms.
	
Teens may be asked to view specific content on Ustream related to learning 
goals or broadcasts created by educational experts. Although this content is 
likely safe, you may want to screen the content with your teen. Because there 
are no safety search filters on Ustream like on some other video-sharing sites, 
you should discuss Ustream search rules with your teens when creating your 
Digital Family Policy.
Flickr
www.flickr.com
Flickr, owned by Yahoo!, is a photo- and video-sharing website where you can 
share and host your photos and videos for free. You can also use Flickr to 
explore content uploaded by other Flickr users. Users can upgrade their free 
account to a Pro account for a small monthly fee. This service allows them 
to upload unlimited pictures. You must be at least 13 to have a Flickr Pro 
account.
Flickr users may include a variety of descriptions with their content (titles, 
tags, location, and people), and content can be organized by sets, collections, 
and as part of Flickr groups.

322
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Account holders can upload content from mobile devices, e-mail, browser, 
third-party apps, and the Flickr desktop app. Uploaded content can be shared 
through e-mail, Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Tumblr, Blogger, LiveJournal, 
WordPress, or RSS feed. Users may also grab a link to their photo or HTML 
code that can be embedded.
Flickr also offers a social media component, where users can add contacts to 
their account and send messages. Users may also join Flickr groups where 
they can view and upload shared content.
You do need an AT&T/Yahoo! account, or sign in with your Facebook or 
Google account.
You may select a default privacy setting that applies to all your content. If 
you add a photo or video to a group, group members can view and comment 
on that content regardless of your default settings, though.
From the Privacy & Permissions section (under Your Account), you can 
select everything from who can tag you in a photo to who can find your con­
tent in searches. You can also elect to activate Safe Search from this page, 
which allows you to see only those photos and videos that Flickr believes are 
safe for a global, public audience.
Instagram
http://instagram.com
Instagram is a popular photo-sharing social media tool. Using a free, down­
loaded application, this service allows users to take a photograph with their 
phone or tablet, apply a filter, and then upload the photo to the social shar­
ing platform. Users can share these uploaded images with other Instagram 
users and also on other social networks, such as Twitter, Flickr, Facebook, 
and Tumblr. Instagram may also be connected to Foursquare; Instagram 
users can be checked in on Foursquare by specifying a location when they 
upload a photo. This application, acquired by Facebook in 2012, is available 
for use on both iOS and Android platforms.
You need to download the Instagram application before opening an 
Instagram account. Find the app at Instagram online, at the Apple Store, or on 
Google Play (on an Android device). You need to provide an e-mail address.
Users can follow the accounts of other Instagram users and also use hashtags 
to search for photos as well as other users. Note: All photos uploaded via 
Instagram are public by default, so they are visible to anyone using Instagram 
as well as on the Instagram website. You can change Instagram account set­
tings to private, though, so that only people who follow you on Instagram can 
see your photos (from the Photo Privacy section).

323
 Chapter 22: Ten Other Places Your Kids Might Be Online
After setting your account to private, new followers have to be authorized 
by you before they can see your images, and only authorized followers will 
be able to view your photos. Changing this setting doesn’t affect existing 
followers, though.
	
Here’s a great reason to keep your photos private, especially if you’re worried 
about copyright infringement: When you upload images to Instagram, you 
grant Instagram the right — royalty-free — to modify, reproduce, and distrib­
ute your content unless that content is listed as private.
To use Instagram, you have to be 13 or older, agree to not post sexually sug­
gestive or nude photos, or use the account to threaten or intimidate other 
users. You may also not use URL’s in your Instagram account name without 
permission.
MeetMe
www.meetme.com
MeetMe (originally MyYearbook) is a social media site originally created 
to connect with friends from the past. It now is a platform where users can 
make new friends. MeetMe calls using social media to meet new people 
“social discovery.” MeetMe users can use games and applications to meet 
other MeetMe users and can access the platform online or via apps for iOS 
and Android operating systems.
Anyone 13 or older can create a MeetMe account. You don’t need a credit 
card, but you do have to provide an e-mail address.
	
Changing user settings to make an account private kind of defeats the goal of 
the site for user profiles to be public, allowing users to find and connect with 
each other. Much of the content shared on accounts is inappropriate for chil­
dren, though, and may involve sexual references and inappropriate language. 
Parents should supervise teens very carefully if allowed to create a MeetMe 
profile.
Tumblr
www.tumblr.com
Tumblr is one of the most popular social media platforms with teens today. 
A virtual scrapbook, Tumblr allows teens to share their favorite content from 
around the web on their pages called Tumblrs. Users can post text, photos, 
quotes, links, music, and videos from platforms ranging from their phone 

324
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
to their web browser. Teens can customize the look of their Tumblr pages. 
Tumblr users can blog original content, but the site is most often used to 
“reblog” (share) other content they’ve discovered.
Many parents allow their kids to have a Tumblr as a way to express themselves 
online. Tumblr allows anyone 13 or older to create an account. You do need an 
e-mail address.
After you create an account, you can connect to people you know via 
Facebook and Gmail.
	
Tumblr is a great way for teens to express themselves, but it can also put 
teens at risk for oversharing very personal information. Even though Tumblr 
allows users and commenters to remain anonymous, many teens share their 
Tumblrs with friends and follow their friends’ Tumblrs as well. There is also 
no way to control who follows your Tumblr, and users of any age may choose 
to follow the content uploaded by your teen. It is not possible to make a Tumblr 
private. If your teen uses Tumblr, discuss the public nature of this platform 
and the ramifications of oversharing. Be sure to include Tumblr content guide­
lines in your Digital Family Policy.
