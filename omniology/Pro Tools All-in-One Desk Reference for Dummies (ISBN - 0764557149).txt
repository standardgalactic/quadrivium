About the Author
Jeff Strong is the author of Home Recording for Musicians For Dummies and is
President of the REI Institute, a MusicMedicine research organization and ther-
apy provider. Jeff graduated from the Percussion Institute of Technology at the
Musician’s Institute in Los Angeles in 1983, and has either worked in or owned

four of which can be found at www.reiinstitute.com. This is his fourth book.


Author’s Acknowledgments
This book wouldn’t have happened without the inspiration and vision of
Senior Acquisitions Editor Steve Hayes. This is my second book with Steve;
this one was just as much fun to do as the first. A hearty thanks to my agent
Carol Susan Roth for making sure I get what’s coming to me.
Books, by nature, are a team effort  and this book is the result of an extremely
talented and dedicated team of professionals: Project Editor Paul Levesque
(my partner in crime for the second time), who reminded me what a great
editor can do for a writer; Senior Copy Editor Barry Childs-Helton, whose
guitar mania found its way onto the page; Technical Editor James Murray,
who kept me on the straight and narrow; and Copy Editor Virginia Sanders,
whose dry sense of humor put a smile on my face more than once during this
process.
I’m also indebted to Philip O’Keefe who contributed the text for the PC con-
figuration and Digidesign hardware sections of this book.
I am especially grateful for the love and support of my wife Beth and my
daughter Tovah, who never cease to amaze me in their capacity to endure
non-stop recording talk.

Introduction
C
hances are that after you became interested in recording some music,
you started hearing about a great software program called Pro Tools.
You may have read an article in which an artist said that he or she records
with Pro Tools, or you heard that such-and-such major recording studio
uses Pro Tools, or a friend told you that you need Pro Tools to record 
professional-quality music. Well, lots of great recording programs are 
available, but without a doubt the most popular — and one of the most 
powerful — is Pro Tools.
Pro Tools is an audio and Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) record-
ing program. Aside from recording audio and MIDI tracks, Pro Tools offers
some of the most powerful editing functions available, allowing you to tweak
your recordings to a high level of detail, clarity, and accuracy. You also get
excellent mixing abilities that help you mix your tracks together, EQ (equal-
ize) them, and apply effects. This all-in-one program lets you control your
music from start to finish.
About This Book
Pro Tools All-in-One Desk Reference For Dummies not only introduces you to
Pro Tools audio- and MIDI-recording software, it also presents basic multi-
track recording techniques. You find out about the many Pro Tools features
and functions and ways to use this program to create the best possible
recordings of your music.
This book also acquaints you with the basic audio-engineering skills needed
to make high-quality recordings. These skills can save you countless hours
of experimenting and give you more time to actually record your music (what
a concept).
In this book . . .
✦You explore the Pro Tools windows and menus.
✦You get a handle on all the useful functions within Pro Tools.
✦You discover the ins and outs of using the various pieces of equipment
in your studio.

Not-So-Foolish Assumptions
2
✦You explore tried-and-true engineering techniques, such as microphone
choice and placement.
✦You find out about the concepts of multitracking, mixing, and mastering.
✦You get a chance to turn your music into complete songs and discover
how to assemble and release an album.
Pro Tools All-in-One Desk Reference For Dummies puts you on the fast track
toward creating great-sounding CDs by cutting to the chase and showing you
skills you can use right away. I don’t bother you with tons of technical jargon
or useless facts.
Not-So-Foolish Assumptions
I have to admit that when I wrote this book, I made a couple of assumptions
about you, the reader (and we all know what happens when we ASSume any-
thing). But what the heck, I did it anyway. First, I assume that you’re interested
in recording your music (or someone else’s) with Pro Tools LE software.
I also assume that you’re relatively new at the recording game and not yet a
seasoned professional. Of course, if you are an audio engineer — maybe one
making the leap from analog to digital — this book offers a great brush-up on
many audio-engineering fundamentals and how they apply to the basic func-
tions of Pro Tools.) Oh, and I assume that you play a musical instrument or
sing — or are at least familiar with how instruments function and how sound
is produced.
Other than these things, I don’t assume that you play a certain type of music
or that you ever intend to try to “make it in the music business” (or even
that you want to treat it as a business at all).
I almost forgot one other foolish assumption regarding your computer: The
Start/Windows key (often called just the Windows key in Windows books)
is the key on a Microsoft keyboard (just outward from each Alt key on the
bottom key row) that is labeled only with a Windows logo. This key can acti-
vate various Pro Tools features, but non-Microsoft keyboards don’t have it. If
you have a PC without a Microsoft-style keyboard and it doesn’t have that
pesky Start/Windows key, don’t worry: I show you other possible ways to
activate the same features.
How This Book Is Organized
Pro Tools All-in-One Desk Reference For Dummies is organized so you can find
the information you want quickly and easily. Each book contains chapters
that cover a specific part of the recording process, and I briefly describe
each book in the following sections.

How This Book Is Organized
3
Book I: Home Recording Basics
Book I introduces you to the basics of home recording. Chapter 1 introduces
you to the individual components of a home studio, and explains what every-
thing is for. Chapter 2 shows you how to make the connections — both analog
and digital — that you need when you’re trying to get sound from one place to
another. Chapter 3 acquaints you with the mixing board, introducing you to
its many functions. Chapter 4 demystifies MIDI and gives you practical advice
on how to use this powerful communication tool to enhance your music.
Chapter 5 puts you inside the world of microphones. You get a chance to
understand what kind of mics are available, how they work, and which ones
work best for different situations.
Book II: Getting Started Using Pro Tools
Book II leads you into the Pro Tools world, examining the software and the
Digidesign hardware that you need in order to run it. Chapter 1 helps you con-
figure your computer to run Pro Tools — and walks you through the process
of installing the software on both Macs and PCs. Chapter 2 introduces you to
the available Digidesign hardware options — and shows you where and how
to plug it in. Chapter 3 helps you make your hardware and software work
together and introduces you to the concept of sessions — the standard build-
ing block of the Pro Tools song-file system. In Chapter 4, you examine the
three windows in Pro Tools — Transport, Edit, and Mix — where you do most
of your work. Book II finishes off with Chapter 5, which gets you up to speed
on file formats and compatibility in Pro Tools. You discover ways to import
and export various file types.
Book III: Recording Audio
Book III gets into the meat of actually recording music. Chapter 1 explains
tracks in Pro Tools and discusses setting them up properly. Chapter 2 explores
the fundamentals of getting a good source sound from microphones. You dis-
cover which mics work best for certain instruments and how to place those
microphones for the best sound. Chapter 3 helps you get ready to record your
first track. You discover how to set levels, enable recording, and monitor your
input signals so that you can hear yourself. This book ends with Chapter 4, in
which you begin the process of recording single or multiple tracks in Pro
Tools. Chapter 4 also shows you how to listen critically (but practically) to
those tracks when you play them back.
Book IV: Editing Audio
Book IV is all about editing the audio tracks that you record. Chapter 1
explains the basics of editing audio in Pro Tools, from knowing which of the
four edit modes to use on your music to using the Audio Region list and
playlists to find the material to edit. Chapter 2 gets you comfortable with

How This Book Is Organized
4
selecting the material you want to edit. You find out how to change a selec-
tion and hear it before you edit it — as well as how to use memory locators
to move quickly from one part of your session to another. Chapter 3 gets to
the heart of editing in Pro Tools. You get used to working with regions (the
standard on-screen representations of the music you recorded in Pro Tools),
using the editing commands, and using looped material to turn your raw
tracks into usable pieces. This book ends with Chapter 4, in which you step
up your editing prowess by exploring the Smart tool and other advanced
editing features.
Book V: Managing MIDI
Although Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) is in is infancy in Pro
Tools, you can still do a lot with this powerful communication protocol.
Chapter 1 helps you set up your MIDI devices. Chapter 2 gets you started
capturing MIDI data by showing you how to create MIDI tracks, and record
your performance. Chapter 3 presents the many Pro Tools editing functions
that you can use to improve on your performance. Chapter 4 explores MIDI
operations — specialized commands that you can use to transform your
MIDI data in numerous ways.
Book VI: Mixing in Pro Tools
Book VI helps you take all your individual tracks and blend them together to
create a finished song. Chapter 1 introduces you to the process of multitrack
mixing and helps you prepare yourself to mix. Chapter 2 walks you through
the process of setting up your Pro Tools session for mixing. Chapter 3 details
equalization (EQ) and how you can use it to make all your instruments fit
together well. Chapter 4 examines four types of dynamics processors —
compressors, limiters, gates, and expanders. These processors are essential
to getting your instruments to “sit in the mix,” (sound good together) and
this chapter helps you use them properly. Chapter 5 guides you into the
world of effect processors like reverb and delay. These effects are useful for
adding life to your productions and this chapter shows you some ways to
use them effectively. Chapter 6 covers one of the most useful things about
recording with Pro Tools: You can automate the elements of your mix —
levels, panning, effects, and so on. Chapter 7 finishes off Book VI by showing
you how to mix to a stereo file.
Book VII: Mastering with Pro Tools
Book VII focuses on the often-misunderstood process of mastering music.
Chapter 1 details what mastering is and helps you determine whether you
want to give it a try or let a professional do it for you. Chapter 2 provides a
step-by-step plan to help you in the event that you want to try your hand at
the mastering game.

Book VIII: Getting Your Music out to the Masses
Book VIII helps you break out of your cocoon so that you can share your fin-
ished music with others. Chapter 1 covers how to choose CD-Rs and burn
your music to them. You also explore the best ways to make copies of your
CDs. If you’re looking to cultivate an audience in cyberspace, Chapter 2
helps you make your music available on the Internet. You get a chance to
format your music for Internet distribution and discover some ways to 
promote your band.
Icons Used in This Book
Like all For Dummies authors, I use a few icons to help you along your way.
Certain techniques are very important and deserve remembering. This
icon gives you a gentle nudge to keep you on track.
Throughout the book, this icon shows up in instances where I include
technical background on certain subjects. When you see this icon,
brace yourself for some dense information.
This icon highlights expert advice and ideas that can help you produce
better recordings.
This icon warns you ahead of time about instances when you could
damage your equipment, your ears, or your song.
Where to Go from Here
This book is set up so that you can read it cover to cover (and progressively
build on your knowledge) or jump around and read only those parts that
interest you at the time. For instance, if you’re getting ready to record a mix
of your song and need some ideas on how to use equalization (EQ), go to

Book VI, Chapter 3. If you’re new to recording with Pro Tools and want to
know how to set up a session, check out Book II, Chapter 3. And if you’re
completely new to the whole concept of home recording, start with Book I,
Chapter 1. 
I recommend starting with Book I, Chapter 1 to get yourself up to speed on
my way of thinking. Book I, Chapter 1 can also help you understand some of
what I discuss in later chapters. Wherever you start and wherever you want
to go, you’re in for an adventure . . .

What You Need
In This Chapter
 Understanding the components of a home studio
 Discovering how each component contributes to the final sound
W
hether you use a PC- or Mac-based system for your Pro Tools studio,
your home recording system of choice employs much of the same
basic technology. In fact, your simple Pro Tools studio consists of the same
basic components as a typical million-dollar professional studio complex.
In this chapter, you discover the purpose of each individual component of a
home recording studio — and you also discover how each of these compo-
nents relates to the quality of sound you ultimately get from your studio.
This knowledge will help you to spend the right amount of money on the
right stuff. (See Book 2, Chapter 1 for more on purchasing gear.)
Eyeing the Big Picture
In spite of what you may surmise from this chapter — with its long list of
equipment — you only need a few things in order to do multitrack recording
with Pro Tools. This simple list comprises instruments and microphones
(called input devices), a computer, a Digidesign audio interface, Pro Tools
software, and monitors (speakers, to you home-stereo enthusiasts). No matter
how complicated your system becomes and how many pieces of gear you
end up accumulating, your studio will still consist of these basic parts.
This chapter breaks down recording systems into the components they have
to have — but you may not need to purchase every component separately to
get a great-sounding system. Many of these components come bundled together.
For example, your Digidesign hardware will include at least two preamps or
you may find speakers that come with a power amp inside them. 
Focusing on the Details
As you begin to build your home studio, you’ll notice a long list of
components — okay, let’s go ahead and call them “extras” — lurking within

the Top Four of computer, interface, software, and monitors. In this section, I
focus on these details so you can understand just what roles they play in
your system.
As you get more and more involved in recording, you’ll find you can add
almost any of these components to your existing system to expand and
enhance what you can do.
Interpreting input devices
All your expensive recording gear is useless if you have nothing to plug into
it. This is where the input device comes into play. An input device is, simply,
any instrument, microphone, or sound module that produces or delivers a
sound to the recorder.
Instruments
Your electric guitar, bass, synthesizer, and drum machines are typical of
the instruments that plug into the interface and represent most of the input
devices that you use in your studio. The synthesizer and drum machine can
plug directly into the Line In inputs of your interface, whereas your electric
guitar and bass need a direct box (or its equivalent) to plug into first. (In the
case of your Digidesign interface, you need to use one of the inputs with a
preamp.) 
A direct box is an intermediary device that allows you to plug your guitar
directly into the mixer without going through your amp first. (For more on
direct boxes, see the upcoming section, “Deciphering direct boxes.”) Check
out Figure 1-1 for an example of an instrument-input device.
Microphone
A microphone (abbreviated mic) enables you to record the sound of a voice
or an acoustic instrument — sound sources that, last time we checked,
couldn’t be plugged directly into the interface. A microphone converts

sound waves into electrical energy that can be understood by the interface.
I detail the several types of microphones in Book 1, Chapter 5. Check out
Figure 1-2 for a look at a microphone.
Sound modules
Sound modules are special kinds of synthesizers and/or drum machines.
What makes a sound module different from a regular synthesizer or drum
machine is that these contain no triggers or keys that you can play. Instead,
sound modules are controlled externally by another synthesizer’s keyboard
or by a Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) controller (a specialized
box designed to control MIDI instruments). Sound modules have MIDI ports
(MIDI jacks) to enable you to connect them to other equipment.

Often sound modules are rack-mountable, meaning they have screw holes
and mounting ears so you can put them into an audio component rack. Some
controllers, however, are not rack-mountable; Figure 1-3, for example, shows
a drum module that rests on a stand or tabletop.
Deciphering direct boxes
A direct box (or DI box, short for Direct Induction) is used to connect your
guitar or bass directly into the mixer without having to run it through your
amp first. A direct box’s purpose is twofold: to change the guitar’s imped-
ance level so the mixer can create the best sound possible, and to change
the nature of the connection from unbalanced (quarter-inch) to balanced
(XLR) so you can use a long cord without creating noise. (For more on cord
types and balanced-versus-unbalanced signals, go to Book 1, Chapter 2.)
For most home recordists, the main purpose of a direct box is to act as an
impedance transformer. You’re unlikely to need a long run of cords from
your guitar to your mixer. Without a direct box changing your impedance
levels, your guitar signal may sound thin or may have excess noise.
Perusing the preamp
Microphones produce a lower signal level than do line-level devices (synthe-
sizers, for example); thus they need to have their signal level increased. For
this purpose, you need a preamp, a device that boosts a microphone’s output.
Preamps can be internal or external, meaning they could reside within your
mixer or be a separate unit that you have to plug in between your microphone
and mixer.

The preamp is one of the most crucial elements of a recording system. It can
affect your instrument’s sound significantly. Most professional recording stu-
dios have a variety of preamps to choose from, and engineers use a particu-
lar preamp based upon the type of sound they’re trying to capture.
The three basic types of preamps available are solid state, tube, and hybrid
(you can find out more about preamps in Book 1, Chapter 5).
Solid-state
Solid-state preamps use transistors to boost the level of the microphone
or instrument. Top-quality (expensive) solid state preamps are generally
designed to produce a sound that’s clear and accurate (GML and Crane Song
brands, for instance). Solid-state preamps can also be designed to add a
pleasing distortion to the music (Neve and Neve-clone preamps, for exam-
ple). Many recording professionals prefer the clear and accurate sound of a
solid-state preamp for acoustic or classical music or any situation when cap-
turing a very natural sound is important. The preamps in your Digidesign
interface are solid state, though not as high a quality as many of the more-
expensive external preamps.
Tube
Since the beginning of the digital recording revolution, professionals have
been complaining about the harshness of digital recording. As a result, many
digital-recording pros prefer classic tube preamps because they can add
warmth to the recording. This warmth is actually distortion, albeit a pleasing
one. All-tube preamps are generally very expensive, but they are highly sought
after among digital recording aficionados because of their sound. Tube pre-
amps work well with music when you want to add color to the sound (that is,
not produce an accurate representation of the original source sound). No
wonder they show up a lot in rock and blues — and they’re great for recording
drums. You can also find tube preamps that are clean and open such as those
made by Manley Labs.
Hybrid
A hybrid preamp contains both solid-state and tube components. Most of the
inexpensive “tube” preamps that you find in the marketplace are actually
hybrids. (These are also called starved-plate designs because the tubes don’t
run the same level of voltage as expensive tube designs.) These types of pre-
amps are usually designed to add the classic tube warmth to your instru-
ment’s sound. How much the sound is colored by the tubes; how pleasing
that colored sound is to the listener’s ears is dependent on the quality of the
preamp. Most hybrid preamps allow you to dial in the amount of character
(pleasing distortion) that you want.

Meeting the Mixer
14
Your Digidesign interface will come with either two (Mbox and Digi 001) or
four (Digi 002 and 002 Rack) preamps. If you want to plug in more mics than
the number of preamps you have or if you want to be able to produce differ-
ent sounds from your preamps, you need to buy one or more external pre-
amps, such as the one shown in Figure 1-4.
Meeting the Mixer
The mixer is the heart of any recording system. Take a look at Figure 1-5.
Although the mixer may seem daunting with all its knobs, buttons, sliders,
and jacks, it’s really one of the most interesting and versatile pieces of equip-
ment that you’ll have in your studio. With the mixer, you can control the
level of the incoming signal, adjust the tonal quality of an instrument, blend
the signals of two or more instruments together, and a host of other things.
And don’t worry; after you read through this book, you’ll get the hang of all
those knobs in no time.
For the Pro Tools home recordist (that’s you), the mixer is incorporated into
your computer software. (Of course, you can always use an external hard-
ware mixer if you want.) The mixer in Pro Tools does the job well enough
that you don’t need an external mixer, although some people prefer having
physical faders and knobs to mess with. If you’re a knob-turner and like to
physically touch the instrument you’re playing (or, for that matter, the
gadget you’re tweaking), then a hardware mixer is your best choice. On the
other hand, if you prefer clicking a mouse or typing on a keyboard (the kind
with letters on the keys), then choose a software version.
An elegant and inexpensive solution for you knob-twiddlers is a dedicated
control surface such as the Mackie Control (shown in Figure 1-6). With this
unit, you get your knobs and faders while still using the internal mixer in Pro
Tools. This can be an advantage because it eliminates the need for lots of
analog-to-digital (ADC) and digital-to-analog (DAC) conversions (not to men-
tion the actual converters, which can cost a lot of money).
Managing the MIDI controller
If you’re like most home recordists, you’ll end up using some sort of MIDI
controller in your studio. (See Book 1, Chapter 4 for more about MIDI.) The
purpose of this piece of equipment is to allow the various MIDI instruments
to communicate and synchronize with one another.

MIDI (Music Instrument Digital Interface) is a protocol that musical instru-
ment manufacturers (in a rare moment of cooperation) developed to allow
one digital instrument to communicate with another. MIDI uses binary digital
data, in the form of 1s and 0s, to tell an instrument to play or release a note,
to change sounds, and a host of other messages. (Discover more about MIDI
in Book 1, Chapter 4.)
MIDI controllers come in many shapes and sizes. The most common are com-
puter software, keyboard, or standalone controllers. These controllers can
reside within the computer (Pro Tools, for example, has MIDI capabilities),
a keyboard (synthesizer), or a separate box. They enable you to either play,
in real time, another instrument or to trigger another instrument with the
sequencer, which is a MIDI program that allows you to play an instrument with-
out actually playing (like old-time player pianos). They just need to have MIDI
capability and be connected through their MIDI ports (using MIDI cables).

Recognizing the Recorder

Recognizing the Recorder
The recorder is where your music actually gets, well, recorded. In Pro Tools,
your recorder consists of your computer and the software. Sound becomes
data and is stored as digital information, as 1s and 0s. Digital recording intro-
duces very little noise into the final sound and can be copied without any
loss in that sound quality. (Depending on the bit depth and sample rate you
record at, of course. See next section.)
Digital recorders
A digital recorder is included as part of your Pro Tools setup. Digital
recorders use two terms to describe the overall quality of the sound that
they produce — sampling rate and bit depth.
Sampling rate
The sampling rate refers to the frequency at which the recorder samples the
incoming sound source. When a recorder samples a sound, it actually takes a
small snapshot of the audio signal. Typical sample rates for digital recorders
are 44.1 kHz (the sample rate for audio CDs), 48 kHz, 88.2 kHz, and 96 kHz (the
sampling rate for DVD audio). The higher the number, the more samples are
taken each second, and the closer the recorded sound is to the original.

What do these numbers mean? Well, the more times per second that a digital
recorder samples the sound of the incoming signal, the more of the original
sound it includes (which means, among other things, a bigger sound file that
takes up more space on your computer). These numbers are described in
kHz (kilohertz) — that is, as taking place thousands of times per second. For
example, when you record at 48 kHz, the sound is sampled 48,000 times
every second. This sounds like an awful lot, but accurate sound requires lots
of samples.
Bit depth
When you start looking at digital recorders, you’ll hear jargon such as 16-bit
(the bit depth of audio CDs), 20-bit, 24-bit, and so forth. This is the bit depth,
which is described in terms of bits (a bit, short for BInary digiT, is the basic
unit of information in the binary numbering system used by computers). The
numbers 16, 20, and 24 relate to the amount of digital information that can
be contained in each of those sample rates that I describe in the previous
section, “Sampling rate.” The higher the number, the more accurately the
sound is represented; most professional audio gear now records at a 24-bit
resolution. With that higher number, however, the sound is going to take up
more of your digital storage space. This usually isn’t a big deal, though, con-
sidering the low cost of huge hard drives.
A/D and D/A converters
A third variable that affects how good a digital recorder will sound is the
type of analog-to-digital (A/D) and digital-to-analog (D/A) converters that the
recorder uses. The A/D and D/A converters are what actually transform an
analog sound source into digital information and back again. They do this by
taking small snapshots of the incoming signal (at whatever sampling rate the
converter uses) and applying a number to that sample (based upon the bit
depth).
For example, suppose that you have a 24-bit converter with a 48-kHz sam-
pling rate. When it senses an auditory signal — a vocal perhaps — the A/D
converter takes a snapshot (measurement) of that signal 48,000 times per
second (48 kHz). Each of these snapshots is given a value between –8,395,008
and +8,395,008 (24-bit resolution has 16,790,016 possible levels), which will
put the vocal sound somewhere on a chart corresponding to a waveform
shape. The recorder in turn reads these numbers, and the D/A converter
translates these numbers back into an analog waveform again (whew!).
Converting an analog signal into digital data and back again is a highly tech-
nical process. You could spend days or even weeks reading about the intrica-
cies of audio conversion. (Check out Principles of Digital Audio by Ken C.
Pohlmann, published by McGraw-Hill Professional, or The Art of Digital Audio
by John Watkinson, published by Focal Press, if you’re into this techy stuff.)

Recognizing the Recorder
18
The most important thing to remember when considering A/D and D/A con-
verters is how well you like the sound. If the converter sounds good to you,
it’s a good converter.
You can buy separate A/D and D/A converters that can sound better than the
one included in your Digidesign hardware. Depending on your ears, your engi-
neering skills, and the style of your music, the improvement in sound of exter-
nal converters can range from barely noticeable to mind-blowing. Before you
spend any money on external converters, though, I highly recommend work-
ing on your skills as a songwriter, musician, and engineer.
The computer
No matter which platform of computer you choose (Mac or PC), the stuff
you find inside your computer plays a major role in determining how
smoothly (or how less-than-smoothly) your Pro Tools system runs. (Book 2,
Chapter 1 details the best computer setups for Pro Tools.)
To set up a Pro Tools computer, you need several things:
✦A computer (preferably with a speedy processor)
✦Bunches (BIG bunches) of memory
✦Dual hard drives
✦An audio interface (This is the Digidesign hardware that you use with
Pro Tools software)
✦The software (Pro Tools, of course)
The following list clues you in on the various pieces of hardware that you
find in your computer:
✦The CPU: The CPU (processor) is the heart of your computer studio.
The speed of your CPU will ultimately dictate just how well any program
runs on it. As a general rule, for audio get the fastest processor that you
can afford. For most audio software, you need at least a Pentium III for
the PC or a G3 for Mac. If you can afford it, get a dedicated computer —
one specifically for recording audio — because running other types of
applications (home finance, word processors, video games) can cause
problems with your audio applications and reduce the stability of your
system.
✦Memory: Computer-based audio programs and all their associated plug-
ins are RAM (Random-Access Memory) hogs. My advice: Get a lot of RAM.
Okay, that’s not very specific, but how much you really need depends on
your recording style. If you do a lot of audio tracks and want reverb or
some effect on each track, you need more RAM (and a faster processor).

Book I
Chapter 1
Discovering What
You Need
Recognizing the Recorder
19
Pro Tools recommends a minimum of 384MB of RAM, but you should
really get a lot more. And I mean a lot more. At least a gigabyte, but you
can never have too much. Also, don’t skimp on the quality of the RAM
you use. Cheap RAM is worse than no RAM at all, so I recommend that
you buy name-brand RAM.
Regardless of the platform you choose (PC or Mac), keep in mind that
you can never have too fast a processor or too much memory.
✦The hard drives: To record audio, be sure you get the right type of hard
drives. Notice how I said hard drives (plural). Yep, you should get more
than one if you want to record more than a few tracks of audio. You want
one hard drive to hold all the software and the operating system — and
another drive just for the audio data. Having two greatly increases the
likelihood that your system remains stable and doesn’t crash on you,
especially if you try to run 16 or more tracks.
As for the size of the hard drive — again, bigger is better, at least in the
audio drive where you store your music. For the core system drive, you
can get by with a 10GB (gigabyte) drive; for the audio, 20GB is still pretty
conservative because audio data can take up a ton of space. For exam-
ple, a 5-minute song with 16 tracks recorded at a 24-bit resolution and
44.1-kHz bandwidth would take up about 600MB of hard-drive space
(that’s about 7.5MB per track minute).
Choose your hard drives wisely. For the software hard drive, you can
get away with a stock drive (usually the one that comes with your com-
puter). But for the audio, you need a drive that can handle the demands
of transferring audio data at high speed. The main things you want to
look for are spindle speed, seek time, and buffer size.
Spindle speed: Also called rotational speed, this is the rate at which
the hard drive spins. For the most part, a 7,200-rpm drive will work
well for recording and playing back audio.
Seek time: This is the amount of time the drive takes to find the data
stored on it. You want an average seek time under 10 milliseconds.
Buffer size: Often called cache buffers, these memory units store
data as it’s being transferred. You want a buffer size of at least 512K.
The track count that your system can handle is directly related to the speed
of your hard drive — the faster the drive, the more tracks you can record
and play back at once. (Of course, the type of drive you get determines how
large a role your processor plays.) My current choice for a drive is a Maxtor
7200-rpm ATA IDE drive with an 8.5-ms seek time and 2MB cache buffer. A
100GB drive currently costs around $100.
Getting the sound in and out
After you have a computer with enough speed and muscle (see the earlier
section “The computer”), then you need the appropriate hardware to get the

Recognizing the Recorder
20
sound in and out of it. Traditionally (if there can be traditions in such a new
technology), you needed a sound card — also called a PCI card because it fits
in the PCI (Peripheral Component Interface) slot in your computer. You also
needed an audio interface, which allowed you to get the sound from your
mixer or preamp to the sound card. This is not the case anymore.
Currently, audio can be brought in and out of a computer in several ways:
✦Through a PCI card connected to your computer’s PCI slot: The Digi
001 is a PCI-based interface. The 001 has a sound card that installs in
your computer and a separate box that houses the converters, inputs,
and outputs.
If you have a Mac G5 computer, you can’t use the Digi 001. The PCI slots in
this computer aren’t compatible with the PCI card of the 001.
✦Through an interface connected to the USB port: The Mbox is Digi-
design’s USB offering. This interface works great; the only problem is
that you’re limited to two inputs and two outputs because of the rela-
tively slow data transfer speed of USB ports. If you don’t see yourself
needing to record more than two tracks at once, this may be a good
option for you.
✦Through your FireWire port: Both the Digi 002 and the Digi 002 Rack
connect to your computer through a FireWire port. FireWire is prefer-
able to USB because the transfer speed is fast enough to keep latency
(the delay from the audio going in and coming back out of your com-
puter) down to a minimum. FireWire ports are inexpensive and available
on laptop computers as well as desktop systems, which makes FireWire
interfaces more versatile than PCI-based systems.
Each of the Digidesign interfaces is described in detail in Book 2, Chapter 2.
Software
Since you’re using a Digidesign interface, you’ll also be using Pro Tools LE
software. Down the road, however, you may want to add some other soft-
ware to your system. This can include programs like Acid for creating loops
or Logic for more MIDI-intensive work.
On the Internet, you can find an online discussion board for each of the
major audio-recording software programs. Before you buy, go to the sites of
the systems that interest you and see what people are saying about the pro-
grams. Ask questions, explore the issues that the people are having with the
programs, and look for comments that reflect how well the programs inter-
act with Pro Tools and your Digidesign hardware. Doing so can save you lots
of time dealing with bugs in your system, and allow you to record a lot more
music. You can find these sites by using the product name as the keyword in
your favorite search engine or by checking out these Internet forums:

Signing On to Signal Processors
Part of the recording process involves making adjustments to a sound either
before or after it’s been recorded. This is the job of the signal processor.
Signal processors come in three varieties — equalizers, dynamic processors,
and effects processors. They can either be incorporated into the system or
be separate, standalone units. For most Pro Tools users, the signal proces-
sors of choice are integrated into the software as plug-ins, although you can
also use external processors by sending the audio out of your computer and
back in again.
Equalizers (EQ)
Equalizers enable you to adjust the frequencies of a sound in a variety of
ways. In effect, you tell the frequencies to
✦Go away: You can get rid of unwanted noise or an annoying ringing by
reducing select frequencies.
✦Come hither: Add life or presence to an instrument by bringing the best
characteristics of that instrument forward.
✦Scoot over: You can make room within the frequency spectrum for each
of the instruments in your mix by selectively boosting or cutting certain
frequencies.
You can find out more about EQ (and discover some great EQ tips and
tricks) in Book 6, Chapter 3. The three main types of EQ are graphic, shelf,
and parametric. Here’s the rundown:
Graphic EQ
Use graphic equalizers to choose a specific frequency to increase or decrease
by a certain amount, generally up to 6 or 12 decibels (dB). Doing so enables
you to eliminate an offending frequency from the signal or make other
adjustments to the tonal quality of the source signal. The graphic EQ will
have a certain number of frequency bands that you can adjust. You’re lim-
ited to only those frequency bands that your EQ has available. Figure 1-7
shows a typical graphic EQ.

Signing On to Signal Processors
22
Shelf EQ
A shelf equalizer affects a range of frequencies above or below the target fre-
quency. Shelf EQs are generally used to roll off the top or bottom end of the
frequency spectrum. For example, you can set a shelf EQ to roll off the fre-
quencies below 250 hertz (Hz) in order to reduce the amount of rumble (low-
frequency noise) in a recording. You can see how this looks in Figure 1-8.
Notice how the shelf EQ gradually reduces the amount of energy (sound)
below the set point and then levels off: hence, the shelf in its name.
Parametric EQ
The parametric equalizer enables you to choose the specific frequency that
you want to affect, as well as the range of frequencies to put around that fre-
quency. With a parametric EQ, you dial in the frequency that you want to
change, and then you set the range (referred to as the Q) — that is, the
number of octaves that the EQ will affect. Check out Figure 1-9: The two dia-
grams show how the Q relates to the range of frequencies affected. (The
higher the Q setting, the narrower the band of frequencies affected.)
You’ll find that the parametric EQ is one of your most useful tools when
mixing all your individual tracks into a stereo pair. I describe this tool in
detail in Book 6, Chapter 3.

Dynamic processors
Dynamic processors are devices that regulate the amount of sound or
energy that gets passed through them. This amount is defined as the
dynamic range — the range between the softest sound and the loudest
sound. Dynamic processors come in three varieties: compressors/limiters,
gates, and expanders. I explain each variety in the following sections.
Dynamic processors are used in a variety of ways. Use them to
✦Control the signal going into the mixer and recorder
✦Tame the levels and correct the effects of an erratic musical perform-
ance when mixing
✦Optimize the levels of the finished stereo tracks when mastering
Dynamic processors are some of the most useful tools that you have in your
home studio. See Book 6, Chapter 4 for more on dynamic processors.
Compressors/limiters
The compressor’s job is to compress the dynamic range of the sound being
affected. The purpose of the compressor is to eliminate transients (unusually
loud notes) that can create clipping (digital distortion). The compressor

limits not only how loud a note can be, but it also reduces the difference
between the loudest and softest note (compressing the dynamic range).
Compressors are used extensively on vocals; the device keeps transients at
bay by gently reducing the highest level that goes through it. Compressors
are also used in mastering, to raise the overall volume of a song without cre-
ating distortion. The device does this by reducing the overall dynamic range;
as a result, a compressor effectively raises the volume of the softer notes
without allowing the louder notes to be too loud and distorting.
A limiter works much like the compressor, except it severely limits the high-
est level of a sound source. The limiter is basically a compressor on steroids;
it gives you beefed-up control over volume. Any signal above a certain level,
called the threshold, gets chopped off rather than compressed (as with the
compressor). A limiter is a good choice in extreme situations, such as when
you want a really in-your-face snare drum sound. In this instance, the limiter
essentially eliminates any dynamic variation from the drummer’s snare drum
hits and makes them all as loud as possible.
Gates
A gate is basically the opposite of the limiter. Rather than limiting how loud a
note can get, the gate limits how soft a note can get. The gate filters out any
sound below a certain setting (the threshold) while allowing any note above
that threshold to be heard.
Gates are often used on drums to keep unwanted sounds from the cymbals
from bleeding through to the tom-tom or snare drum mics, or on guitars by
refusing to allow the noise generated by guitar effects to be heard when the
instrument isn’t playing.
Expander
The expander is basically the opposite of a compressor — instead of attenuat-
ing (reducing the volume of) the loudest notes in a performance, an expander
attenuates the softest notes. For example, if you have a singer whose breath
you can hear in the mic and you want to get rid of that particular blemish, just
set the expander to go on at a level just above the annoying breath sounds
and it will drop out the offending noise subtly.
Effects processors
Effects are historically used to mimic real-world situations. As a home
recordist, you will likely discover a great affinity toward your effects proces-
sors because they enable you to create sonic environments without having to
rent some great recording room. For example, imagine dragging your drums
and all your recording equipment into a large cathedral, setting them up, and
spending several hours getting the mics placed just right. Sounds like a lot of

work, right? (I’m tired just thinking about it.) Well, how about recording your
drums in your modest home studio and simply choosing the “cathedral hall
reverb” patch instead? Now that’s much easier.
I can practically guarantee that you will use effects processors all the time in
your studio. Scope out Book 6, Chapter 5 for how to use them effectively.
In the world of effects processors, you have many choices, and many more
show up every year. The most common effects processors are (in no particu-
lar order) reverb, delay, chorus, flanger, and pitch correction. Read on for
the lowdown on each type.
Reverb
Reverb is undoubtedly the most commonly used effects processor. With
reverb, you can make any instrument sound as if it were recorded in almost
any environment. Reverb, a natural part of every sound, is the result of the
sound bouncing around inside a room. The larger the room, the more pro-
nounced the reverb. The purpose of a reverb in audio production is to make
an instrument sound more natural (especially since most instruments are
recorded in small, nonreverberant rooms) or to add a special effect. Reverb
can make almost any recorded instrument sound better — if used correctly.
Delay
Think of delays as the recording studio’s version of an echo. The delay can
be set to happen immediately after the original sound or be delayed much
longer. Delay can sound natural or be used as a spacey special effect. You
can have a single echo or multiple delays (very common with the snare
drum in reggae music, for instance). Delays are commonly used on vocals
and guitar, although you can hear them on just about any instrument,
depending on the style of music.
Chorus
A chorus effect can make one instrument sound like several. Chorus effects
add very-slightly-off-tune versions of the unaffected sound, which results in
a fuller sound. You find chorus effects used on vocals, guitars, and lots of
other melodic instruments.
Flanger
A flanger (pronounced flanj-er) effect is similar to chorus effect in sound
except that the flanger gets its sound from delaying part of the affected
sound in relation to the original, rather than altering its pitch. Flangers are
sometimes used on background vocals and solo instruments to add an inter-
esting texture. This is a unique sound that you recognize almost immediately
upon hearing it.

26
The flanger effect comes from the early days in recording. You create the
flanger effect the old-fashioned way by recording a duplicate track of the one
that you want to flange, using a two-track recorder. You then play the two
identical parts back at the same time and gently press against the edge of
the two-track tape (the one with the duplicate part) while it’s running. This
delays certain parts of the sound slightly and drastically changes the charac-
ter of the instrument.
Nowadays, you can just choose the flanger patch (sound) on your effects
processor to get this sound. Isn’t technology great?
Pitch correction
Pitch correction, like its name suggests, is used to correct an out-of-tune note.
You can use this effect to help a singer or an instrument player sound better
by fixing those notes that are slightly out of tune. Pitch correction (also
called auto-tune) has gotten a bad rap lately (mainly from its overuse and
potential for abuse with a singer who can’t sing in key). When used sparingly
and appropriately, pitch correction can make an otherwise decent vocal per-
formance really shine. Auto-tune can also be used to create some interesting
effects, such as that robotic-vocal sound you hear on so many of the pop
songs on the radio nowadays. An easily distinguished example would be the
lead vocal on Cher’s “Believe.”
Monitors
To record and mix music, you need to be able to hear it (hey, obvious things
need love too). Monitors make this happen. You can use headphones or
speakers as monitors; most home studios use both. Monitors are an essen-
tial part of a recording studio because you need to get what you’re recording
and mixing into your ears before you make sure that it sounds good.
Without good speakers, you won’t know what your mixes are going to sound
like on other speakers. (Find out more about mixing in Book 6.)
Headphones
Chances are that your first home studio will be in a spare bedroom or a
corner of your garage or basement. All your recording, monitoring, and
mixing will be done in this room. If that’s the case, you’ll find that a set of
headphones is indispensable. When you use headphones, you can turn off
your speakers and still hear what’s being (or has been) recorded. When
you go to record a guitar using a microphone in front of the guitar amp, you
want to hear only the guitar — not the guitar amp and the guitar amp coming
back through your monitors. Headphones will allow you to do this. (See
Figure 1-10.)

Speakers
For most home recordists, the first set of monitors consist of the home
stereo system, but sooner or later you’re gonna want a real set of monitors.
Studio monitors come in many varieties, but the home recordist’s best bet is
a set of near-field monitors. Near-field monitors are designed to be positioned
close to you (which is often the case anyway because most home recordists
have very little room in which to work).
Near-field monitors either come with or without an amplifier. The amplified
monitors are called active monitors, and the nonamplified monitors are
referred to as passive monitors. Which type of monitor you choose depends
on your budget and whether you like the idea of the amp coming with the
speakers or prefer to purchase the amp separately. Figure 1-11 has a picture
of an active near-field monitor. The amplifier is located inside the speaker
cabinet.
If you end up getting passive monitors, then you need to buy an amplifier to
send power to the speakers. The amplifier connects to the outputs of the
mixer and boosts the signal to the speakers. A good power amp should be
matched in power to work well with whatever speakers you have.

Mastering Media
After you mix your music, you need to put your final music on something.
The two most common media for Pro Tools users are CD and raw computer
files. Which medium you choose depends upon what your goals are. For
instance, if you intend to send your finished mix out to a mastering house,
then you’re better off saving it as raw audio data in a computer file. On the
other hand, if you master your music yourself and just want to have it dupli-
cated (or you want to give copies for your friends to play), then you would
want to use a CD.

CD
With the cost of CD-R (write) and CD-RW (rewrite) drives plummeting, CD
mastering is the only choice for most home recordists. With CDs, you can
back up large amounts of data at a very low cost, and burn audio CDs that
can play in any CD player. You can even send out your mastered CD to be
duplicated and packaged for retail sale. (Book 8, Chapter 1 details the
process for burning CDs and how to have mass quantities created.)
Computer files
Sometimes you won’t want to master your music directly to CD. You may
decide to have a professional mastering house do it, or maybe you want to
put your music on the Internet. In those situations, store your recordings as
computer files. The following sections describe the most commonly used file
formats for storing recorded music.
WAV and AIFF
WAV and AIFF (Audio Interchange File Format) files are the formats for audio
files found with most professional audio software. The advantage to saving
your music to WAV or AIFF is that when you hand over a CD containing your
WAV and/or AIFF files to a mastering house, the recorded sound is actually in
a higher-quality format than that of the finished CD (provided your recorder
records in 20 or 24 bit, which most do). You can also take your music files to
any other studio that supports these file formats and work with them there.
MIDI
A MIDI file is not an audio file; rather, it’s a data file that contains MIDI infor-
mation that can be transferred from one computer to another. An advantage
to MIDI files is that they take up less room than an audio file. The disadvan-
tage is that they only contain the MIDI information and no sound. In order to
play a MIDI file, you have to have a sound module. And the sound you get
from the file depends entirely on what sound source you use.
MP3
MP3 is a file format that has become quite popular on the Internet. Its advan-
tage over audio CDs and other computer files is that it takes up less room.
Its disadvantage is that the data is compressed and the sound quality is not
near that of commercial CDs (contrary to what MP3 proponents claim). You
can find out more about MP3s and audio quality in Book 8, Chapter 2.

O
kay, so you’re ready to turn that spare bedroom or basement into a
recording studio. After you unpack all your shiny new gear and get it
plugged in properly, you need to get your room to work for you. This involves
creating an efficient place to work, but above all, it means getting your room
to sound good. This can be tricky; after all, pro studios spend tons of time and
money getting the room to sound great. You’re going to have to do much the
same. You may not have to spend a ton of money (as if any of us could), but
you will need to spend some time.
After you decide on a space for your home recording system, the next
steps involve setting up the system and getting your space to work for you.
In this chapter, I help you make sense of all those connectors that you end up
using — and help you get them all plugged in properly. I also show you how
to find the best way to work in your environment, with a goodly measure of
tips and tricks thrown in to make your room sound as good as possible.
Making Connections
No matter what type of home recording equipment you have, one thing’s for
sure — you’re gonna have to plug in some cords somewhere. Exactly where
depends on the particular system you own, so read through this section to
make sense of all those different cords and connectors, whether analog or
digital.
You probably have a lot of experience with analog connectors and cords,
such as the ones on your stereo system. But you may never have come in
contact with digital connectors, unless you’ve plugged in a DVD player to
your TV or had a chance to go into a recording studio that uses digital gear.
If you’ve already had this foretaste, pay particular attention to the “Digital”
section of this chapter.

Making Connections
32
Analog
No doubt you’ve had a chance to see and use a variety of analog connectors.
If you play a guitar or keyboard (synthesizer), for example, you’re familiar
with a quarter-inch analog plug. Some microphones use an XLR analog plug.
Keeping it all straight can be a little confusing: Why do you have to use one
plug for one thing and another for something else? And what’s a TRS plug,
anyway?
Read on to decipher the secrets of the most-common analog connectors:
quarter-inch (mono/TS and stereo/TRS), XLR, and RCA.
The quarter-inch analog plug
The quarter-inch plug is the most common audio connector and one of the
most versatile as well (you see it on cables strung all over the studio to con-
nect instruments, amps, speakers, headphones, and mixers). Quarter-inch
plugs come in two varieties: mono/TS or stereo/TRS.
Mono/TS
The humble plug at the end of the cord you use for your guitar or synthe-
sizer is an example of a mono quarter-inch plug; mono (monaural) means it
has only one channel with which to send the signal. This type of plug is also
referred to as a TS plug (short for Tip/Sleeve): The tip is the very tip of the
plug and the sleeve is the rest of the cylindrical metal part. A plastic divider
separates the two sections, each of which is connected to a different part of
the cable. Check out Figure 2-1 to see this familiar plug.
TS plugs are used for a variety of purposes — to go from your guitar to your
guitar amp, from your synthesizer to your mixer, from your mixer to your
power amplifier (amp), and from your power amp to your speakers. You’d
expect that one cord could work for all of these applications. After all, a TS
plug is a TS plug is a TS plug, right? Well, not really. The same plug can be
wired differently, and it can carry different levels of power. For example, an

33
instrument cord (the one you use for your synthesizer or guitar) contains
one wire and a shield — the wire is connected to the tip and the shield is
connected to the sleeve — whereas a speaker cord contains two wires and
no shield — one wire is connected to the tip and the other to the sleeve.
The speaker cord also carries a lot more current (power) than the instru-
ment cable; that’s the reason it doesn’t have a shield. The high signal level
covers up any noise present in the cord. Because there isn’t nearly as much
current present in an instrument, you don’t want to use a speaker cord for
your instrument; you need the instrument cable’s shield to keep the noise
down. If you do use a speaker cord for your instrument, you may end up
with some noise — a hiss, buzz, or even a radio broadcast coming out of
your amp (or wherever you’ve plugged in your instrument).
When you buy cords with TS plugs, first be sure to look at (or ask) what pur-
pose the cord is designed for. Then, when you get it home, be sure to make a
note of what type of cord it is so that you use it correctly. You can mark your
cord a number of ways: You can put colored tape on it (red for speaker or
blue for instrument, for example), put a tag or label on it, or (gasp) dot it
with nail polish. 
You generally don’t need to worry about which end of the cord you plug
into your instrument — the signal will travel equally well in either direction.
However, currently (so to speak), you can buy cords that are designed to send
the current in one direction. (The cord has an arrow on it designating which
direction the signal should flow.) I call these designer cords, and two of the most
common brands are Monster and Planet Waves. The theory behind these cords
is that they do a better job of preserving the sound qualities of the instrument
for which they’re designed. These cords are specifically designed for almost
every instrument and application known to humankind.
Instrument cords are often called unbalanced lines because of the way
they’re wired. An unbalanced cord has one wire surrounded by a braided
shield; the wire is connected to the tip of the TS plug and the shield is con-
nected to the sleeve. The signal is sent through the wire and the shield is
used for the ground. (It keeps the noise down.) There are balanced lines as
well, which I explain in the upcoming section on stereo/TRS plugs. 
Stereo/TRS
A stereo/TRS (short for Tip/Ring/Sleeve) quarter-inch plug looks like a stereo
headphone plug (take a look at Figure 2-2). The tip is at the very end of the
plug, the ring is the small middle section located between the two plastic
dividers, and the sleeve is the rest of the cylindrical metal part of the plug.
A TRS plug can be used a couple of ways: as a balanced cord or with a Y cord.
Read on to find out what these italicized terms mean.

Making Connections
34
A balanced cord is used on professional audio gear to connect the various
pieces of equipment together (the mixer to the recorder, for example). The
advantage with a balanced cord is that you can have longer cord runs with-
out creating noise.
Why is it that balanced cords are so conveniently noise-free? The balanced
cord has two wires and a shield inside, and is wired with the same signal
running through both wires. One is 180 degrees out of phase with the other
(their wave forms are exactly opposite one another) — the crest of one wave
occurs at exactly the same time as the trough of the other, so they cancel
each other out. When they get to the mixer (or wherever they’re plugged
into), one of the signals is instantly flipped and added to the other. Any noise
that was built up in the signal is cancelled out. (Yep, it’s wave cancellation
from high-school physics. Who knew it also rocks?)
A Y cord consists of a TRS plug on one end and two TS plugs on the other,
forming — you guessed it — a nice representation of the letter Y. The purpose
of this cord is to allow you to insert an effects processor — a compressor or
equalizer, for example — into the line-in insert jack of a mixer. Check out Book
1, Chapter 3 for all the details. The TRS plug both sends and receives a signal.
The Y cord is wired so the tip sends the signal and the ring receives it (see
Figure 2-3). The sleeve is connected to the shield of each cable.
XLR
The XLR connector is used for microphones and some line connections
between professional gear. This cable has a female and a male end. (See
Figure 2-4.) The cord is wired much like a TRS connector and is balanced to
keep the noise down. The XLR microphone cable is also called a low-Z cable
because it carries a low-impedance signal.
RCA
RCA plugs — named for good old RCA, also called phono plugs — are
common on home stereo (and some semi-pro) audio gear. (See Figure 2-5.)

They function much like a TS plug and aren’t very common in professional
audio equipment. Some mixers include them, however, so you can connect a
tape deck. They are also used for digital S/PDIF signals. (See the next section
for more on these babies.)

Digital
Since you’re using Pro Tools and your computer, you’re going to get comfort-
able with digital connectors. Digital audio equipment is a recent invention —
no one standard has emerged. Because of this lack of standardization, a vari-
ety of digital connectors are on the market, only a few (or one) of which may
be equipment that you own or intend to purchase. Regardless, knowing
about the most-common connectors and their purposes will help you decide
what equipment is right for you.
MIDI
MIDI, short for Musical Instrument Digital Interface, is a handy communica-
tion protocol that allows musical information to pass from one device to
another. To allow for the free passage of such information, MIDI jacks are
located on a whole host of electronic instruments — synthesizers, drum
machines, sound modules, and even some guitars have MIDI jacks. And, in
order to connect all these instruments, you need some MIDI cables. The MIDI
cable contains five pins (male) that plug into the female MIDI jack (port) on
the instrument or device. (See Figure 2-6.) 
The Digi 001, 002, and 002 Rack each have MIDI ports, while the Mbox does
not. If you want to use MIDI and you have an Mbox, you need to buy a sepa-
rate MIDI interface. Regardless of which Digidesign interface you have, you
will need to buy the cable for those ports separately.
AES/EBU
AES/EBU (Audio Engineering Society/European Broadcasting Union) cables
are much like S/PDIF (see following). The AES/EBU standards require that
these cables transmit two channels of data at a time. They differ from S/PDFIF 
Figure 2-5:

mainly on
consumer
stereo and

pro audio
equipment.

37
connectors in that they consist of XLR plugs and use balanced cables. 
(See Figure 2-7.) AES/EBU was developed to be used with professional audio
components, hence the use of balanced connections — the kinds used in
professional-level equipment. Your Pro Tools interface doesn’t have any
AES/EBU connectors — S/PDIF and ADAT Optical are used instead. (See the
following sections.)
S/PDIF
S/PDIF (short for Sony/Philips Digital Interface Format) connectors consist
of an unbalanced coaxial cable (one wire and a shield) and RCA plugs. (See
Figure 2-7.) They can also be made from fiber-optic cable and a Toslink con-
nector. The S/PDIF format can transmit two channels of digital data at once.
S/PDIF protocols are very similar to AES/EBU standards except S/PDIF was
originally designed for the consumer market — which explains why unbal-
anced cords are used. Even so, you can find S/PDIF connectors on a lot of
pro recording gear along with (or instead of) AES/EBU.
If you want to use cords longer than about 3 or 4 feet when you’re using a
S/PDIF connection — or about 15 feet for AES/EBU connections — your best
bet is to use video or digital audio cables. Regular audio cables degrade the
sound at longer distances because they can’t transmit the type of signal that
digital equipment produces without affecting the quality of the sound. If you
use audio cables for longer distances, the sound loses some definition,
becoming what some people describe as “grainy.”

ADAT Optical
The ADAT (Alesis Digital Audio Tape) Optical (lightpipe) format can send
eight tracks of digital audio at once. Developed by Alesis, ADAT Optical has
become a standard among digital audio products. It consists of a fiber-optic
cable using a special connector developed by Alesis. In your Digidesign
interface you can use the ADAT optical for either eight channels of ADAT
information or for Optical S/DIF connections — but you can only use one or
the other at one time. You choose your preference from the Hardware Setup
screen under the Setups menu.
TDIF
TDIF (Teac Digital Interface Format) is Teac’s return volley to ADAT Lightpipe.
TDIF uses a standard computer cable with a 25-pin connector. Like the ADAT
Lightpipe, TDIF cables can transmit eight channels of digital data at a time.
TDIF isn’t nearly as common as ADAT Lightpipe because Alesis made its
Light-pipe technology available to other companies to use for free (and
encouraged them to adopt it as a “standard”) and also because the Alesis
ADAT recorders were so common. You won’t find any TDIF connections in
your Digidesign hardware — ADAT is used instead.
Working Efficiently
I hope you’ll spend a great number of hours in your studio creating some
great music (possibly to the dismay of the rest of your family). One impor-
tant thing to keep in mind is that you need to be comfortable. First, get a
good chair and set up your workstation to be as easy to get around as possi-
ble. Figure 2-8 shows a classic L setup. Notice how everything that you need

is within arm’s reach. If you have enough room, you might want to consider
a U-shaped setup instead. You can see that in Figure 2-9.
If you use a lot of outboard gear — such as preamps or effects processors —
and you think that you need to plug and unplug a lot, invest in a good patch
bay so that you don’t have to strain to get at your cords tucked away behind
your mixer. A patch bay is a device that consists almost entirely of inputs
and outputs, allowing you to route your gear in (and out) in an almost-infi-
nite variety of ways. If you’re going to do much plugging and unplugging,
you’ll quickly find out that a patch bay is truly indispensable. It saves your
back and it saves your cords (repeated plugging and unplugging wears them
out quickly and produces buzzes that can be hard to locate).

Taming heat and dust
The number-one enemy of electronic equipment is heat. Dust is a close
second. Try to set up your studio in a room that you can keep cool and fairly
dust-free. Air conditioning is a must for most studios. Be careful with a
window air conditioner, though; it can make a lot of noise, requiring you to
shut it off when you record. Depending on where you live, this could heat
your room up really fast. To deal with dust, try to cover up your equipment
when you’re not using it, especially your microphones. A plastic bag placed
over the top of a mic on a stand works well.
You could also just put your mics away when you’re not using them. However,
if you use a particular mic a lot, you’re best off leaving it on a stand rather than
handling it — some types of mics are pretty fragile. (You can find more on caring
for your mics in Book 1, Chapter 5.)

Monitoring your monitors 
If you have a set of near-field monitors — the kind that are designed to be
placed close to you — they should be set up so they’re equidistant from
each other and from you, at a height that puts them level with your ears.
Figure 2-10 illustrates the best placement for your monitors. Placing your
monitors this way ensures that you hear the best possible sound from them
and can accurately hear the stereo field. (For more on the stereo field, see
Book 6, Chapter 1.)
Optimizing Your Room
Chances are that your studio occupies a corner in your living room, a spare
bedroom, or a section of your basement or garage. All these spaces are less-
than-ideal recording environments. Even if you intend to record mostly by
plugging your instrument or sound module directly into the mixer, how your
room sounds will have a big effect on how good your music may turn out
to be.
Let’s face it — as a home recordist, you’re unlikely to have easy access to
the resources that create a top-notch sound room. Commercial studios
spend serious cash — up to seven figures — to make their rooms sound,
well, professional. You don’t need to spend near that amount of money (you
mean you don’t want to sell off the private jet . . .?) to get great sounding
recordings. All it takes is a little understanding of the way sound travels,
some ingenuity, and a little bit of work.

Sound isolation
One of the concerns that you (and your neighbors) are probably going to
have when you start recording in your home is the amount of sound that
gets in and out of your room. Sound waves are nasty little buggers. They get
through almost any surface, and there’s not a lot you can do to stop it from
happening.
You’ve probably noticed this phenomenon when somebody with a massive
subwoofer in his car drives by blasting some obnoxious music. (Ever notice
how someone else’s music is obnoxious whereas your music never is, no
matter how loud you play it? Amazing . . . ) Your windows rattle, your walls
shake, and your favorite mug flies off the shelf and breaks into a thousand
pieces. Well, this is one of the problems with sound: It’s physical energy.
The best (and classic) way to isolate your studio room from everything
around it is to build a room within a room. I won’t go into detail here, but
you can go to my Web site (www.jeffstrong.com) to find some resources
to get you started.
For the purpose of most home recordists who don’t have the money or
space to build a room within a room, the best thing you can do is to try to
understand what noises are getting in and getting out and deal with those.
For example, if you live in a house or apartment with neighbors close by,
don’t record live drums at night. You could also consider using a drum
machine or electronic drumset (plugged directly into the recorder) instead.
Another idea is to try to choose a room in your house or apartment that is far-
thest away from outside noise (an interior room, for instance). Basements also
work well because they’re underground and most of the sound gets absorbed
by the ground. Install a little fiberglass batting insulation in the ceiling —
typical house insulation that you can find at your local home center — can
isolate you pretty well from your neighbors’ ears. Detached garages are gener-
ally farther away from other buildings, so sound has a chance to dissipate
before it reaches your neighbors (or before your neighbors’ noise reaches
your garage).
Also keep these things in mind when trying to isolate your studio:
✦Dead air and mass are your friends. The whole concept of a room
within a room is to create mass and still air space so the invading or
escaping sound gets trapped there. When you work on isolating your
room, try to design in some space that can trap air (creating dead air) —
such as a suspended ceiling or big upholstered furniture — or use
double layers of drywall on your walls (mass).
✦Don’t expect acoustical foam or carpet to reduce the noise. Using these
can help reduce the amount of sound that bounces around inside the
room, but it won’t do much to keep sound in (or out of) the room.

Book I
Chapter 2
Getting Connected:

✦Isolate the instrument instead of the room. Isolating the sound of your
guitar amp can be much less expensive than trying to soundproof your
whole room. Most commercial studios have one or more isolation booths
for recording vocals and other acoustic instruments. You can use that
concept to create your own miniisolation booths.
One idea for a truly miniisolation booth is to make an insulated box for your
guitar (or bass) amp. If you just have to crank your amp to get the sound you
want, you can place it inside an insulated box to reduce the amount of noise
that escapes to the outside world. Check out Figure 2-11 to see what I mean.
You can also create an isolated space in a closet by insulating it and closing
the door when you record, or you can put your guitar amp (or drums) in
another room and run a long cord from there to your recorder. If you do this,
remember that for long cord runs you need to use balanced cords; otherwise
you may get a bunch of noise and your signal may be too low-level to record
very well.

Sound control
After you create a room that’s as isolated from the outside world as possible,
you need to deal with the way sound acts within your room.
Sound travels through the air in the form of waves. These waves bounce
around the room and cause reflections (reverberations or echoes). One prob-
lem with most home studios is that they’re small — and sound travels very
fast (1,130 feet per second, to be exact). When you sit at your monitors and
listen, inevitably you hear the reflected sound as well as the original sound
that comes out of your speakers. With big rooms, you can hear the original
sound and reflections as separate sounds, meaning that the reflections them-
selves become less of a problem. For a good home studio, you have to tame
these reflections so they don’t interfere with your ability to clearly hear
what’s coming from the speakers.
How all these reflections bounce around your room can get pretty compli-
cated. Read up on acoustics (the way sound behaves) to discover more
about different room modes: axial (one dimension), tangential (two dimen-
sions), and oblique (three dimensions). Each relates to the way sound waves
interact as they bounce around a room. Knowing your room’s modes can
help you come up with an acoustical treatment strategy, but there are very
complicated formulas for figuring out your room’s modes, especially those
dastardly tangential and oblique modes.
You can find out more on room modes, as well as discover some room mode
calculators, on the Internet by using your favorite search engine and search-
ing for room modes. Go to the Web site matches and you’ll see quite a few
places to start looking. I recommend that you research these modes; this
topic alone could fill an entire book.
So, at the risk of offending the professional acoustical engineers in the world,
I’m going to share some tricks that I’ve been using in my studios. My main
goal has been to create a room with a sound I like and that gives me some
measure of control over the reflections within the room. Because I both
record and mix in one room (as do most home recordists), it’s helpful to be
able to make minor adjustments to the sound to accommodate what it is I’m
trying to accomplish.
There are two aspects of recording where sound control plays a major role —
tracking and mixing — and each requires different approaches for you to get
the best possible sound out of your recordings. I cover both these aspects in

Tracking is what you’re doing when you’re actually recording. Two things
that can make a room a bad environment for tracking are: (a) not enough

sound reflection; and (b) too much sound reflection. The goal when tracking
is to have a room that’s not so dead (in terms of sound reflection) that it
sucks the life out of your instrument and not so alive that it colors the sound
too much. The determining factor in how much reflection you want in your
room is going to be based upon the instrument that you record and the way
it sounds in the room.
If your room is too dead (not enough sound reflection), you’ll want to add
some reflective surfaces to liven things up (the room, that is). On the other
hand, if your room is too live (too much sound reflection), you need to add
some absorptive materials to tame down those reflections.
You could go out and buy a bunch of foam panels to catch the reflections, or
maybe put in a wood floor or attach some paneling to the walls to add some
life, but you’d be stuck with the room sounding only one way. It may end up
sounding good for recording drums or acoustic guitar, but then it would
probably be too live for getting a great vocal sound — which requires a
deader space. One solution that I’ve found to work well is to get (or make)
some portable panels that can either absorb or reflect the sound.
Figure 2-12 shows an absorber/reflector that I’ve used and have found to
work quite well. (Go to my Web site, www.jeffstrong.com, for plans to
build your own.) One side has an absorptive material (dense fiberglass insu-
lation) and the other a reflective surface (wood). They are put together in an
attractive frame and designed to stack easily when you want them out of the
way. Even with very little woodworking experience, you can crank out a set
of them in a weekend for very little money (about $30 per panel). I guarantee
that if you make them (or hire someone to make them for you), you’ll find
dozens of uses for them around your studio.
Sound control during mixing
Your first step in getting control of the sound of your (probably less-than-
perfect) room during mixing is to get a good pair of near-field monitors. 
Near-field monitors are designed to be listened to up close (hence the “near”
in their name) and will lessen the effects that the rest of the room has on your
ability to hear them accurately and get a good mix.
The next step to mixing in an imperfect room is to mix at low volumes. I
know; that takes the fun out of it, right? Well, as fun as it may be to mix at
high volumes, it rarely translates into a great mix. Great mixing engineers
often listen to their mixers at very low levels. Yes, they occasionally use high
levels, but only after the mixing is pretty much done — and then only for
very short periods of time. After all, if you damage your ears, you blow your
career as a sound engineer. (Hey, that rhymes! Or is there an echo in here?)
I don’t want to sound like your mother, but try to resist the temptation to
crank it up. Your ears last longer and your mixes sound better.

Even with these two things (near-field monitors and low mixing levels), you
still need to do something to your room to make it work better for you. The
secret to a good mixing room is to tame the reflections of the sound coming
out of your speakers.
Dealing with high and midrange frequencies is pretty easy — just put up
some foam panels or the absorptive side of the panels shown in Figure 2-12.
(See? I told you that you’d have a use for those panels.) Start by hanging two
(or putting them on a stand or table) so they’re level with your speakers on
the wall behind you. Also put one on each sidewall right where the speakers
are pointed. (See Figure 2-13.) This positioning gets rid of the higher frequen-
cies and eliminates much of the echo.
You may also need to put something on your ceiling right above your head,
especially if you have a low (8 feet or less) or textured ceiling. (You know, one
with that popcorny stuff sprayed on.) You may not want to mount one of the
absorption panels over your head because they’re fairly heavy. Wrapping up a
couple of 2-x-4-foot panels made of dense fiberglass (the same ones used in the
absorber/reflectors) in fabric would work just about perfectly. In fact, you can
make some overhead diffusers like the ones shown in Figure 2-14 very easily.
(The plans for these are also on my Web site at www.jeffstrong.com.)

You can also place a set of these overhead panels in the corners of your
room behind the speakers. Just hang them at the same height of your speak-
ers so that they cut off the corner of the room. If there isn’t enough room to
fit the panels at an angle in the corner, you can eliminate the backing from
the fiberglass and bend the fabric-covered panel to fit right in the corner.
Either approach will absorb sound that may otherwise bounce around
behind the speakers.

Another thing that you need to consider when you’re mixing is standing
waves. Standing waves are created when bass tones begin reflecting around
your room and bounce into each other. Standing waves have a weird effect
on mix quality. They can either overemphasize the bass from your speakers
(resulting in mixes that are short on bass) or cancel out some — or all — of
the bass coming out of your speakers (resulting in mixes with too much
bass). One of the problems with standing waves is that they can really mess
up your mixes and you may not even be aware that they are there.
To find out whether you have a problem with standing waves in your studio,
sit in front of your monitors and put on one of your favorite CDs. Now listen
carefully. Okay, now lean forward and backward a little bit. Does the amount
of bass that you hear change as you move? Next, get up and walk around the
room. Listen for places within the room where the bass seems to be louder
or softer. You may find places where the bass drops out almost completely. If
either inspection gives you a variable experience of the bass, then you are
the proud owner of standing waves. Don’t worry, though. You can tame that
standing-wave monster with a pair of bass traps.

Bass traps absorb the energy in the lower frequencies so they don’t bounce
all over your room and throw off your mixes. You can buy bass traps made
of foam from some music stores or (yep, you guessed it) you can make your
own out of wood and insulation. Check out Figure 2-15 for a look at some
homemade bass traps. (The plans to make these are — you guessed it —
located on my Web site: www.jeffstrong.com.)
The most common placement for bass traps is in the corners behind you
when you’re sitting at your mixer (as in Figure 2-16). You may also find that
putting a set in the other corners of the room helps even more.
After you place the bass traps, do the listening test again. If you notice some
areas where the bass seems to get louder or softer, try moving the bass traps
around a little. With some trial and error, you’ll most likely find a place where
they seem to work best.

Try not to get stressed out about the sound of your room. As important as
your room’s sound may be, it has a lot less impact on the quality of your
recordings than good, solid engineering practices. I know, I keep saying this,
but it’s important to remember. So do what you can and then work with what
you’ve got.

 Exploring routing and busing
I
f you’ve ever been to a recording studio and watched a great recording
engineer create a mix, you’ve probably been entranced by the way that he
or she interacted with the mixing board: a dance around the mixer, a twist of
a knob here, a push of a slider there. All this to the beat of the music. It’s like
watching a genius painter paint, or a great orchestra conductor conduct, or a
brilliant surgeon surge . . . er, operate. I’ll even bet that one of the reasons
you got interested in home recording is so you could have a chance to play
with those knobs yourself. Go ahead and admit it — you’ll feel better.
Well, you get your chance in this chapter. Not only do you discover what
each of those knobs does, you get a feel for all the functions that the mixer
fulfills in the studio. You discover what makes up a channel strip and how
it’s used. You get a chance to see how routing works (and even discover
what routing is). And you see how digital mixers use fader banks to provide
numerous functions while taking up very little space.
Meeting the Many Mixer Types
Pro Tools has an integrated mixer as part of its software, and with it you can
effectively do anything that you could possibly want (and more) with your
music. You can adjust EQ, levels, panning, and routing (to name just a few)
by either using keystrokes on your computer keyboard or administering a
click of your mouse.
Even with all the power that the Pro Tools mixer has, some people (myself
included) like to have some knobs to twiddle and some faders to slide while
they work. If you’re one of these people, this section will help you decide
which of the three hardware options would work best for you. 

Meeting the Many Mixer Types
52
Analog mixer
The analog mixer, as shown in Figure 3-1, enables you to route the signals
within the analog domain. Analog mixers tend to have many knobs, lights,
and faders — a set for each channel. If you want to change from mixing
inputs (your instruments) to mixing sounds recorded on the recorder, you
need to plug and unplug cords or you need to get a mixer with twice as many
channels as your recorder. 
Many people prefer analog mixers because they believe they sound better
than the mixer in Pro Tools software (this is not necessarily the case, at least
to my ears) or they want to create elaborate mixes for a band to hear in their
headphones as they record. 
The main disadvantage to using an analog mixer with Pro Tools (or any
other computer-based recording system) is that you need just as many
analog inputs and outputs for your Digidesign hardware as you want chan-
nels to mix in your mixer. For example, if you want to mix a 16-track song,
you need the equivalent of two Digi 002 Racks. The other possible disadvan-
tage is that each analog-to-digital-to-analog conversion degrades the sound
of your music.
Digital mixer
The digital mixer, as shown in Figure 3-2, is a great option for Pro Tools users
because it can perform the same functions as a conventional analog mixer in
a lot less space, and you don’t have to worry about having as many analog
connections. Also, the whole issue of sound degradation from going back and
forth to digital is moot because all your music stays in the digital domain.
If you want to use a digital mixer with Pro Tools, make sure that it is compati-
ble with the software — an easy task if you go to www.digidesign.com/
compato — and that you have enough channels of digital connection in
your hardware. (Book 2, Chapter 2 details each of Digidesign’s hardware
capabilities.)
Like in Pro Tools software, routing — the process of sending your signals to
various places within the mixer — becomes almost easy using one of these.
You can switch between input and track channels without having to change
a single cord.
One of the great things about digital mixers is that any EQ or effects plug-ins
that you use are powered by the processor in the mixer, not the processor in
your computer. This can allow you to have many more effects on your mixes
(not always a good thing) before your system bogs down.

Chapter 3

The downside to this arrangement is that you’re stuck with the EQ and
effects that are part of your mixer — and if they aren’t that great to begin
with, you may not want to use them.
The computer control surface
A computer control surface is a piece of hardware that interfaces with your
computer to control the controls within the Pro Tools software. As far as I’m
concerned, a computer control surface, like the one included with the Digi 002,
is the way to go with Pro Tools — as long as you have a powerful-enough
computer to handle the mix, because all your EQ and effects processing is still
done in the computer, unlike what you’d get with a digital or analog mixer.
There are quite a few control surfaces that integrate smoothly with Pro Tools,
including the cool-looking Mackie Control shown in Figure 3-3.

These controllers send MIDI messages — messages coded using the Musical
Instrument Digital Interface communications protocol — to the computer
telling it which parameters to change. These controllers can easily be pro-
grammed to work like a separate digital mixer.
Understanding Mixer Basics
In spite of the many types of mixers out there (see the “Meeting the Many
Mixer Types” section, earlier in this chapter), you’ll discover that they all
generally follow the same basic principles — and have a number of elements
in common. You’ll also discover that, regardless of the type of mixer you
use, two mixing aspects — the channel strip and busing (also known as 
routing) — are universal. The rest of this chapter concentrates pretty heavily
on these two aspects.
Think of a mixing board as a sort of air-traffic controller for the audio world.
Just as the guys (and gals) in the towers near an airport communicate with
all the planes in the air, making sure that collisions are avoided and that traf-
fic moves quickly and efficiently, the mixer routes all the incoming and out-
going signals from the instruments, effects, and recording devices so they
get to their desired destination without any problems.
Channel strip
The mixer is composed of numerous channels into which you process the
signal of an instrument or microphone before it’s sent to the recorder. This
is called the channel strip. (See Figure 3-6.) Even though the mixer may look
confusing with all its knobs, lights, and sliders, you only need to understand
the basic makeup of one channel to understand them all. The channel strip’s
job is to take the signal from an instrument or microphone and send it where
you want it.
The channel strip also enables you to make adjustments to the level of the
signal in a variety of ways: overall level, a certain frequency’s level (different
for each mixer), left or right stereo level, and effect levels.
The channel strip serves two functions: to control the level of an input device
(the input channel) and to control the level of a recorded track (the track chan-
nel). Both functions of the channel strip operate the same way. In fact, you can
use the same channel for either an input or track signal. The only difference is
which device (an instrument or the output from your recorder) is plugged in.
Input jack
The input jack, generally located on the back of the mixer (although it can
also be on the upper part of the top of the mixer), is where you plug in your

Understanding Mixer Basics
56
instrument (or microphone or the output from your recorder). Many profes-
sional mixers have both a quarter-inch and an XLR jack for each channel.
(See Figure 3-4.) For the lowdown on jacks, read through Book 1, Chapter 2.
The quarter-inch jack is used for line-level sources such as a synthesizer,
drum machine, or the cord from the line out of your guitar amp. The XLR
jack is for the male end of the microphone cord. Most semi-pro and pro
mixers also have phantom power available to the XLR jack. The phantom
power feature sends a low level of current from the mixer to the microphone
to get the microphone to produce a signal. Phantom power is necessary for
professional condenser mics.
If you choose not to mic your guitar amp and instead want to plug your
guitar directly into your mixer, you need to do one of three things:
✦Plug your guitar into your amp and run a cord from the Line Output of
the amp to the mixer’s channel input.
✦Plug your guitar into a direct box (a device that changes the impedance
level of your guitar or bass) and plug the direct box into the channel
input of your mixer.
✦Plug your guitar directly into the “Hi-Z” input of your mixer if it has one.
(You’ll find this feature on many newer mixers.)
Most pro mixers allow you to use either a balanced or unbalanced cord. (For
the scoop on balanced and unbalanced cords, see Book 1, Chapter 2.) Read
through the owner’s manual for your mixer to find whether balanced con-
nections are part of your mixer’s specs. Balanced connections are only
important if you have really long cords (over 25 feet, for instance) because
they cut down on the noise that can result from long cord runs using unbal-
anced cords.
Insert jack
Aside from the quarter-inch and XLR input jacks, another jack — an Insert
jack — is often found on the back of the mixer for each channel. Its purpose
is to enable you to send the signal from the channel out to a processor such
as a compressor or an equalizer and to receive the signal back after it has
been processed. Unlike the Effect Send (described in the upcoming section,
“Auxiliary (Aux) Send knobs”), this jack won’t let you mix in as much effect
signal as you want — all of the signal is affected. Figure 3-4 shows a typical
set of input jacks.
To use the Insert jack, you need a Y cable, as shown in Figure 3-5. You con-
nect the plug at the base of the Y to the mixer Insert jack; the plugs on the
two arms of the Y go into the input and output jacks of the processor.

Trim knob
The job of the Trim knob (labeled as Gain on your Digidesign interface) is to
adjust the level of the input signal as it enters the mixer. (You usually find
the Trim knob at the top of the front panel of the channel strip, as shown in

Figure 3-6.) The amount that you adjust the Trim knob depends on the
instrument that you have plugged into the channel strip. If the Trim knob is
set too high, you get distortion; if it’s set too low, you get too weak a signal
to record, so be sure to listen as you make your adjustments.
Most Trim knobs have a switch or markings for Line or Mic(rophone) sig-
nals. See these markings in Figure 3-6. Turn the knob all the way left for line
sources — or slowly keep turning it right for microphone sources — until
you get a nice clean sound coming into the mixer. See Book 3, Chapter 2 for
more on setting input levels.
If you choose to use an external preamp, check the owner’s manual of your
mixer to see whether you can bypass the internal preamp. Most professional
mixers enable you to do this. Sometimes just having the Trim knob all the
way down (to the Line marking) disengages the preamp from the circuit —
and this is the case with the Digidesign preamps. You can also plug into the
line inputs if you want to keep your Digidesign preamps free for other mics
or instruments.
Equalization
Semi-pro and pro mixers give you the opportunity to adjust the equalization
(EQ) of your signal — that is, to boost or reduce specific ranges of sound
frequency. Less-expensive mixers have fewer equalizer settings (as few as
two — one for high frequencies and one for low frequencies). Pro mixers have
three or four; digital mixers and software mixers may have more.
Auxiliary (Aux) Send knobs
You may find occasions when you want to add some effect, such as reverb
or delay, to the signal coming into your mixer. With effects such as reverb,
you don’t want to use the Insert jack — as you would with a compressor —
because you want to be able to control how much of the effect you actually
hear. (Compressors affect the entire signal, not some portion of it.)
This is where the Auxiliary (Aux) Send feature comes in. That’s what the
little knobs in the middle of the channel strip in Figure 3-6 are for. Adjust
these knobs to send as much (or as little) of the signal as you want to go to
the appropriate auxiliary component (Aux, get it?). Doing so specifies how
much (or how little) of the effects processing shows up in your final sound.
Turning the knob to the left produces less effect; turning it to the right gives
you more effect.

Not only can you set the Effect Send level at each channel (and you can send
more than one channel’s signal to each effect), you can also adjust the level
of the affected signal that’s brought back into the mixer and mixed with all
the dry signals at the master bus (see the “Routing/Busing” section later in
this chapter). This is the Aux Return, which you can find out more about in
the “Auxiliary (Aux) Return knobs” section, later in this chapter. 
Pre/Post switch
The Pre/Post switch enables you to send the signal to the Aux bus (through
the Aux Send knobs) either before (pre) it gets through the EQ and channel
fader or after (post) it goes there. Use the Pre/Post switch to send an un-
equalized signal to the effect, and then to adjust the EQ of the dry (unaf-
fected) signal without affecting what the effect sounds like. You can also use
the Pre/Post switch to control the level of both the signal and the effect with
the channel fader.
Having this option gives you more flexibility to control what the affected
sound will sound like. For example, you can send the dry signal of a kick
drum to a reverb (with the switch in the Pre position) and then boost the
bass on the dry signal. Doing this gives you some reverb on the higher fre-
quencies without adding it to the lower ones, which would create some mud
in the final mix. The downside to this is that you can’t use a fader to control
the level of the signal being sent to the effect. (You bypassed the fader in the
“Pre” position.) In this case, if you raise and lower the channel fader, the
amount of effect that you hear in relation to the dry signal will change as
well. For example, when you lower the fader, you hear more effect because
there’s less dry signal mixed in; when you raise the fader, you hear less
effect because the dry signal is louder and the effect level is the same.
Pan knob
Use the Pan knob to adjust where in the stereo field (how far left or right)
your signal is heard. This knob is generally located toward the bottom of the
channel strip and is an important part of mixing. Where you put something
in the stereo field has an effect on how well it’s heard among all the other
instruments playing through the mixer. (Book 6, Chapter 1 has more details
on panning and mixing.)
Mute switch
The Mute switch, located toward the bottom of the channel strip, enables you
to silence the channel (mute it). This switch is commonly used during mix-
down to help you work with the sound of a particular part in the mix. This
switch allows you to quickly silence the parts you don’t want to hear when
you’re mixing so you can concentrate on the sound of the instruments that
you want to hear. For example, when you work in EQing and balancing the

Book I
Chapter 3
Meeting the Mixing
Board
Routing/Busing
61
levels of the drum set, you can use the mute switch for all the other chan-
nels so you hear only the drum-set tracks. 
Solo switch
The Solo switch, when engaged, allows one channel to “sing solo” while
muting all the rest. This switch (normally located near the Mute switch)
is also commonly used during mixdown when you want to hear only one
instrument. This saves you the hassle of having to press the Mute switch on
all the rest of the channels. For example, when you work on EQing and are
affecting the lead vocal, you can press the Solo switch to mute all the other
instruments while you make your adjustments. Then when you want to hear
what your adjusted vocal sounds like with the rest of the instruments, all
you have to do is disengage the Solo switch (press it again).
Assign switches
The Assign switches can be located just above the fader, at the top of the mixer
or right next to the fader. Use these switches to choose where to send the out-
going signal. You can send it to the Master bus or to any of the submix buses.
(For more on buses — the electronic pathways along which signals are sent —
see the next section.) If your mixer doesn’t have a separate Solo switch, one of
the Assign switches can give you the option of soloing that channel.
Faders
The fader, usually a slider control located at the bottom of each channel
strip, determines the overall level of the signal coming out of the channel
strip before it makes its way to the recorder, the Master bus, or the submix
bus. (Check out the next section, “Routing/Busing,” for more details.)
Routing/Busing
After you have an instrument plugged into the mixer channel strip, you want
to send that signal somewhere. This is referred to as routing or busing. (The
place where the signal ends up is, conveniently enough, referred to as a bus.)
Most mixers offer numerous busing possibilities, including busing to the
✦Master bus: where you can send your mixed music to a two-track
recorder.
✦Submix bus: where you can mix several tracks together before they go
to the Master bus.
✦Control room bus: where you can listen to the tracks through your 
monitors.
✦Auxiliary bus: where you can add an effect to your signal.

Routing/Busing
62
In the next few sections, I introduce you to some of the most-used busing
options and describe some ways to make this process easier.
The busing controls are generally located on the right side of the mixing con-
sole, as shown in Figure 3-7. Here you have faders for the Master and submix
(Sub) buses, dials for the Aux bus, and Solo and Mute buttons for the Master
and submix (Sub) buses. This area is often called the master control section
of the mixer.
Master fader
The Master fader, located in the lower-right corner of Figure 3-7, controls the
Master bus, where your mixed music goes out to the 2-track recorder or back
into Pro Tools. When you have something plugged into a channel input, it’s
automatically sent to the Master bus. Where you have your Pan knob set for
each channel (how far to the left or right) dictates how much signal is sent to
the left or right channels of the Master bus. Some mixers are designed with
only one master fader to control both left and right channels; on other mixers,
you have one fader for each left and right channel.
Sub (submix) faders
Depending on the mixer you own, you may or may not have a group of submix
(Sub) faders located to the left of the Master fader, as shown in Figure 3-7. The
submix faders control the submix buses, which is where you can mix several of
your tracks and group them together independently of the rest of the tracks.
You use the Assign switches for each channel to choose which (if any) submix
buses you want the signal sent to.
The submix can be sent out of the mixer as a unit. For example, you may want
to record all the drums on one or two tracks instead of recording them indi-
vidually. The submix is also routed to the Master bus as a unit. If you assign
instruments to a submix, they get diverted from the Master bus and go to
the submix fader first. Then everything assigned to that submix fader gets
sent to the Master bus to be controlled by the Master fader. Most mixers also
allow you to send the submix out without having to go through the Master
bus first — there are often submix outputs located on the back of the mixer.
Solo/Mute switches
Above each submix fader on your mixer, you’ll most likely have Mute and
Solo switches, as shown in Figure 3-7. Use these switches to, well, solo or
mute (that is, isolate or silence) the submix group. For example, you may
want to hear only the submix of the drums or maybe background vocals.
This switch allows you to quickly check your submix.

Control Room level knob
The Control Room level knob, usually located above the Master fader, as shown
in Figure 3-7, controls the level of the signal going through the Control Room
bus — the signal that’s sent to your studio monitors. The Control Room level
knob is fed by the Master bus and has the same mix that goes through the
master output to your recorder. This allows you to have a different volume
than the master level so you can monitor at a different volume than the level
being sent out through the Master bus.
The Control Room level knob is especially useful when you’re recording and
sending a high level to the recorder but also want to listen to what’s being
recorded — at a more comfortable, lower volume — through the monitor
speakers.
Phones knob
Like the Control Room level knob, the Phones knob (located above the
Control Room level knob in Figure 3-7) enables you to adjust the level going
to the headphones independently of the master level. The Phones knob is
fed by the Master bus and will have the same mix as the Master fader.
Auxiliary (Aux) Send knobs
The Aux Send knobs, also located in the master controls section of the mixer,
allow you to send the entire mix from the Master bus to an effects processor,
such as a reverb or delay. In Figure 3-7, you can see the Aux Send knobs above
the submix fader on the left.
Auxiliary (Aux) Return knobs
The Aux Return knobs control the overall level for each of the signals routed
through an effects processor and sent back to the Master bus. You use these
knobs to mix in the amount of wet (affected) signal that you want. The wet
signal mixes with the dry (unaffected) signals from each of the channels.
Aux Assign
Some mixers can route a signal sent through an effects processor to any
of the submix buses, where they can be controlled by the corresponding
submix fader. This Aux Assign capability enables you to have (for instance)
the reverb you want on the drums routed to the submix fader that controls
the overall drum level. You choose your bus by pressing in the correspon-
ding Assign button.

Output Jacks
65
Master Level meters
At the top of many mixers are the Master Level meters, which keep tabs on
recording levels and warn you when you may be producing a signal that’s
too strong or too weak. Too strong a signal could lead to distortion; too weak
a signal produces a sound that lacks fidelity (sounds thin). Master Level
meters can come in the form of VU meters (the ones with needles that go
back and forth) or as LED lights (where green is good and red is bad).
Output Jacks
Most mixers have a bunch of output jacks (where — you guessed it — the
signal comes out) located at the left on the back of the mixer, as shown in
Figure 3-8. You often find output jacks for the Master bus, headphones, moni-
tors, and Direct Outs for each channel, as well as jacks for the Aux Returns.

Master Out jack
The Master Out jack goes to the power amp for your speakers or to a master-
ing recorder (2-track). This jack is controlled by the Master fader and sends
the signal that’s routed through the Master bus.
Phones jack
The Phones jack is for your headphones and is fed by the Phones knob on
the master console, which carries the same signal as the Master bus — only
you get to control the volume separately.
Monitors jack
The Monitors jack is where you plug in your monitor speakers. Control this
jack with the Monitor (or Control Room) knob on the mixer. It carries the
signal from the Master bus to the speakers.
Direct Out jacks
You get Direct Out jacks on more full-featured mixers. These jacks are con-
trolled by their corresponding channel fader (Channel 1 goes to Direct Out 1;
Channel 2 to Direct Out 2; and so on). The signal goes directly out from each
channel without going through the Master bus.
Most semi-pro and pro mixers won’t actually have a Direct Out for each
mixer channel. That’s no big deal; Direct Out jacks are designed so you can
send a signal directly out (hence the name) from the channel to a recorder. If
you don’t have direct outs on your mixer, you can just use the Insert jack to
send your signal directly out of the mixer and into the recorder. The exact
procedure for this connection depends on your mixer; check your owner’s
manual.
Direct Out jacks are really helpful when you’re recording using overdubs, a
process where you layer a track by recording one instrument at a time. For
example, you could record the drums on Channels 1 through 4, the bass guitar
on Channel 5, and the guitar part on Channel 6. You then send the signal via
the Direct Outs from Channels 1 through 6 to the recorder’s Tracks 1–6 and
send those signals back to the mixer on channels 9 through 14. You could then
use Channel 7 to record the lead guitar part to Track 7 of the recorder while
listening back to Tracks 1 through 6 on channel strips 9 through 14. This saves
you from having to crawl behind your mixer and change cords when you want
to hear the recorded track back.

As you can see, the mixer setup can get complicated. Don’t worry. After you
get to know your mixer and get a chance to try some different routing config-
urations, this stuff will become second nature to you.
Aux Return jacks
The Aux Return jacks are where you plug in the cord from the line-out jack of
your effects processor. This jack is fed to the Aux Return knob.
Patch Bay
After you set up your mixer and plug it into the input devices, effects proces-
sors, and recorder, you’re set to go. But what if you want to record a track
and then listen back to it right away to see whether you like what you hear?
Well, for most home recordists, this can be a problem because you’ll most
likely have only enough channel strips in your mixer for either recording or
listening back. If this is the case, you’re going to have to crawl behind the
mixer and unplug your input device and then plug in the outputs from your
recorder. Then, when you’re done listening back, you have to switch the
cables back in order to record again. All this crawling and connecting can
be time-consuming (and eventually hard on your cables).
The solution is to get a patch bay. A patch bay is a device that consists almost
entirely of input and output jacks. You plug your gear into it so you can change
the cord configuration without crawling around behind your big pile of tech-
nology. Check out Figure 3-9 for a look at a patch bay.
A patch bay is an essential tool for analog studios — and it’s useful for the
more-complicated digital ones as well. Patch bays function by giving two
series of jacks — one in the back where you plug in all your gear, and one in
the front that you can use to patch — connect together with cables — any

one piece of gear into any other. For example, imagine that you want to plug
in the output from your synthesizer into Channels 1 and 2 and you want to
record your friend’s guitar in Channel 3. At the same time, you want to moni-
tor the bass guitar on Channel 4 and the drums on Channels 5 through 8.
This is pretty straightforward, but what if you want to hear what you
recorded on Channels 1 through 3? With a patch bay, all you have to do is
change the cords going into mixer Channels 1 through 3 at the patch bay.
You still have to change cords when you use a patch bay, but at least every-
thing is upfront and accessible; without a patch bay, you’re stuck having to
crawl behind your mixer and recorder to change the cords.

y first job in a recording studio was in 1985. I can still remember
the first time I walked into that studio. The owner was sitting, arms
crossed, in a chair in front of the mixing console (it was called a console in
those days because the mixer was an actual piece of furniture that took up
nearly the whole room). He looked at me and hit a key on the Macintosh
computer sitting next to him. Then all of a sudden, a synthesizer started
playing, then another, and yet another. This is cool, I thought. But then I
heard my nemesis — the drum machine.
Drum machines made me lose my recording gigs as a drummer and drove me
to expand my career to that of a recording engineer as well. However, I even-
tually came to love that drum machine and the many others to follow (sigh).
In fact, over the years, I became so captivated by the whole MIDI/drum
machine thing that I assembled a whole series of electronic drum sets using
drum machines and samplers — all controlled through MIDI.
In this chapter, you find out how MIDI enables synthesizers and computers
to communicate with one another — a revolutionary thing for the musician.
You get your hands dirty in the world of sequencing — the process of record-
ing MIDI performance information so you can play your performance auto-
matically. You also peruse a variety of MIDI-capable instruments and explore
the ins and outs of controlling your MIDI gear.
Like audio recording, MIDI can be a deep subject. You can go nuts trying to
understand every little nuance of MIDI. (I know some guys who are not quite
the same after plunging headfirst into this stuff.) The reality is that to use
MIDI effectively, you don’t need to know every little thing about it. In this
chapter, I focus on what you need to know to get started.

Meeting MIDI
70
Meeting MIDI
MIDI is a protocol (a set of agreed-upon standards) for musical instruments to
communicate with one another through a cabled connection and a common
digital language. This arrangement allows each one to understand the other,
regardless of manufacturer or instrument. All that’s required is an instrument
equipped with MIDI ports (jacks).
MIDI data is different from an audio recording because it contains no sound
as such; rather, it’s limited to performance information. This includes infor-
mation about various performance characteristics, which (for keyboards, at
least) includes the following:
✦Note-on and note-off: What note is played and when.
✦Velocity: How hard someone presses a key.
✦After-touch: Whether the key pressure changes after the initial press.
✦Vibrato and pitch bend: Whether the pitch changes while a key is
pressed.
This information allows the MIDI musician to potentially create a perform-
ance that is as rich in texture as those of the world’s finest players.
Digital messages sent from one device to another across a cable (called the
MIDI cable, of course) create MIDI data. The cable connects to MIDI ports on
each device, and the messages are sent in the form of binary digits. Each
instrument can understand and respond to these messages.
Perusing MIDI ports
There are three types of MIDI ports: In, Out, and Thru. The In port receives
incoming messages, and the Out port sends those messages. You use the
Thru port when you create a daisychain, which means you connect more
than two devices together. The Thru port sends the messages that one
device receives directly to the In port of another instrument. Figure 4-1
shows a daisychain setup.
MIDI signals travel in only one direction. Data flows from the Out port of
one device to an In port of another device — but not the other way around.
Likewise, data going through the Thru port originates from the first device
in the chain — not the device whose Thru port is being used. The particular
way that data flows is what gives you flexibility in how you can connect dif-
ferent devices together. Here are some examples:

Book I
Chapter 4
MIDI and Electronic
Instruments
Meeting MIDI
71
✦Example 1: In Figure 4-1, three synthesizers are connected in a daisy-
chain lineup. A cable connects device A’s Out port to device B’s In port.
Another cable connects device B’s Thru port to device C’s In port. In this
scenario, device A controls devices B and C. Devices B and C can’t con-
trol any other device, because neither device B nor device C has a con-
nection from its Out port.
✦Example 2: Suppose you connect device B to device C by using device
B’s Out port instead of its Thru port. In this case, device A sends mes-
sages to device B but not to device C. Device B controls device C. Device
C has no control over either A or B because neither one is connected to
device C’s Out port.
✦Example 3: Now take a look at Figure 4-2. In this figure, two devices
have MIDI cables running from the Out port of each to the In port of the
other — which allows communication to go both ways. (The MIDI inter-
face in this figure is necessary for making MIDI connections in a com-
puter.) For example, a master synthesizer and a computer sequencer are
frequently connected this way so you can send performance information
from the synthesizer to the sequencer (when you’re recording your part)
and from the sequencer back to the synthesizer (when you want to play
the part back again).

A connection to a MIDI device’s In port or through a device’s Thru port 
doesn’t allow the device to control another device. A MIDI device can con-
trol another device only if the cable is connected from its Out port to the
other device’s In port.
Understanding MIDI channels
Okay, so you’ve got a daisychain of MIDI instruments all hooked together,
and you want to control them from your master keyboard or sequencer pro-
gram. Now you want the drum machine to play the drum part and a sound
module to play the string part. This is where MIDI channels come in handy.
The MIDI channels allow you to designate which messages go to a particular
machine. You can program each machine to receive messages on one or
more of the 16 MIDI channels. For instance, you can set your drum machine
to receive messages on Channel 10 (the default channel for drum sounds)
and set the sound module with the string sounds to receive data on Chan-
nel 1. (You set the MIDI channels on your digital instrument by going into
the System Parameters menu. Check your owner’s manual for specific proce-
dures.) After you assign your channels, your master keyboard sends the
performance information for both MIDI signals — the drum machine and
the sound module playing the string sounds — across one MIDI cable. Each
receiving device responds only to the messages directed to the MIDI channel
that it’s assigned to receive.
In this scenario, the sound module with the string sounds receives all the data
from the master keyboard, responds to the messages on Channel 1, and simul-
taneously sends the data from the master keyboard onto the drum machine
(via the sound module’s Thru port). The drum machine receives the same

messages from the master keyboard as the sound module, but only responds
to those sent for Channel 10.
Having 16 MIDI channels allows you to have up to 16 separate instruments
playing different parts at the same time. You may use 16 different devices or
16 different parts from the same device if you have a multitimbral sound gen-
erator (see the synthesizer section later in this chapter for more on such
sound generators).
You’d think that each MIDI channel would be sent along its own wire in the
MIDI cable. That’s actually not the case. Inside the MIDI cable are three
wires — two for data transmission, and one to serve as a shield. MIDI mes-
sages are sent across the two wires using a channel code, which tells the
receiving device to what channel it should send the data following the code.
Such a MIDI channel message, also called a channel voice message, precedes
each performance command.
Appreciating MIDI messages
In order for MIDI instruments to communicate with one another, they need
to have a vocabulary in common. This is where MIDI messages come in. MIDI
messages contain an array of commands, including performance data, con-
trol changes, system-common messages, and system-exclusive messages
(about which more in a minute).
Not all MIDI devices recognize all MIDI commands. For example, a sound
module generally can’t send performance-data messages (such as after-
touch) because a sound module doesn’t have triggering mechanisms that
produce those commands.
Check your instrument’s manual for a MIDI Implementation Chart. All MIDI
instruments come with this chart. In it, you can find a list of all the MIDI
commands that the device can send or receive. The chart also includes
information on polyphony, which refers to how many notes the instrument
can play at once, and multitimbrality, or how many different sounds the
instrument can produce at the same time.
Performance data
Included in performance data are note-on and note-off messages, as well as
specifications for velocity, after-touch, vibrato, and pitch bend.
MIDI performance-data messages each have 128 different values. For exam-
ple, each note that you play on the keyboard has a number associated with
it (middle C is 60, for instance). Likewise, velocity is recorded and sent as a
number between 0 and 127, 0 being the softest volume (no sound) and 127
the loudest that you can play.

Meeting MIDI
74
Control-change messages
Control-change messages are a type of performance-data message. These
messages contain data about expression, including modulation, volume,
and pan.
System-common messages
System-common messages contain data about which channel the performance
data is sent to and what sound in the sound library to play. System-common
messages also include information about timing data, master volume, and
effects settings.
System-exclusive messages
System-exclusive messages contain information that is exclusive to the
system or device. These messages can include data transfers of new sound
patches, among other things.
To use MIDI effectively, you don’t need to know all (or even many) of the
MIDI messages that a device can recognize. If you hook up your gear and
play, your MIDI devices generate and respond to the messages for you.
Managing modes
Your synthesizer, drum machine, or other MIDI module has four operating
modes, appropriately called Mode 1, Mode 2, Mode 3, and Mode 4. These
modes dictate how your instrument responds to the MIDI messages it
receives.
Mode 1: Omni On/Poly
In Omni On/Poly mode, your instrument responds to all the MIDI messages
coming across the wires (well, except for the MIDI channel data). This means
that your synthesizer (or whatever) tries to play the parts of all the instru-
ments hooked up to your MIDI controller. In this mode, your device also
plays polyphonically (more than one note at a time).
Some older MIDI devices default to Omni On/Poly mode (Mode 1) when you
turn them on. In such a case, you have to reset your instrument if it’s one of
several in your MIDI setup. If you don’t, the instrument responds to any MIDI
message sent from the controller, not just the ones directed toward it.
Mode 2: Omni On/Mono
Omni On/Mono allows your device to receive messages from all MIDI chan-
nels but only lets it play one note at time (monophonically). This mode is
rarely, if ever, used.

Book I
Chapter 4
MIDI and Electronic
Instruments
Meeting MIDI
75
Mode 3: Omni Off/Poly
In the Omni Off/Poly mode, your device can play polyphonically but responds
only to MIDI signals on the channels that it’s set to. This is the mode you use
most often when you’re sequencing — recording or playing back MIDI data.
(Book 5, Chapter 2 covers this process in Pro Tools in greater detail.)
Mode 4: Omni Off/Mono
In the Omni Off/Mono mode, your instrument responds only to the messages
sent on the MIDI channel it’s set to and ignores the rest. Rather than play
polyphonically, as in Mode 3, your instrument plays only one note at a time.
This can be advantageous if you’re playing a MIDI controller from an instru-
ment that can play only one note at a time, such as a guitar or saxophone.
General MIDI
If you end up composing music for other people to play on their MIDI 
instruments — or if you want to use music from another composer —
General MIDI is invaluable to you. General MIDI (GM) is a protocol that
enables a MIDI instrument to provide a series of sounds and messages 
consistent with other MIDI instruments. With General MIDI, you can take
a Standard MIDI File (SMF) of a song created on one sequencer program,
transfer the file to another program, and use that other program to play the
exact performance — sounds, timing, program changes, everything.
GM instruments contain numerous sound patches that the MIDI community
has standardized. Not all these sounds are exactly the same as far as sound
quality goes, but their sound type and location (acoustic grand piano on
patch #1, for instance) is the same on all GM-compatible machines.
Not all MIDI-capable instruments follow the GM standards. If this feature is
important to you, be sure you find out if the instrument that interests you is
GM-compatible before you buy.
GM standards dictate not only the particular sounds that a synthesizer has,
but also which drum sounds are located on which keys, how many notes of
polyphony the instrument has, and how many different channels the instru-
ment can receive and send instructions on. The two levels of GM compatibil-
ity are Level 1 and Level 2.
GM Level-1 compatibility
Level 1 protocols were developed in 1991 and consist of a minimum of 128
instrument patches, 24 notes of polyphony, receiving and sending capability
for all 16 MIDI channels, 16-part multitimbrality, and a host of controller and
performance messages.

Getting Started with MIDI
76
GM Level-2 compatibility
Level 2 was implemented in 1999 and includes more sounds, polyphony, and
features. A GM2-compatible device has 32 notes of polyphony, 16-channel
support, up to 16 simultaneous instrument sound patches, and a host of
additional sounds (384, to be exact) including 2 channels of simultaneous
percussion sounds. Also added to the GM2 standard are reverb and chorus
effects.
Getting Started with MIDI
Enough with the technical aspects of MIDI — you want to know how to start
using this great technology, right? Well, in this section, I introduce you to
some essential MIDI gear, help you synchronize your machines, and show
you the basics of sequencing. You also discover how to save and transfer
your MIDI files.
Gearing up
Okay, so this MIDI thing sounds kind of interesting to you, and you want to
know just what you’re going to need to buy to do some MIDIing yourself. Well,
I’m sorry to inform you that you can’t do any of this cool MIDI stuff with your
vintage Stratocaster guitar or your acoustic drum set (unless you do some
fancy rigging to your gear — see the sidebar, “MIDI control this . . .”). What you
do need is
More is better
Roland and Yamaha both decided a while ago
to raise the bar on the GM level-1 standards by
developing their own protocols. Called GS and
XG respectively, the machines conforming to
either of these standards are synthesizers on
steroids. For example, the Yamaha XG protocol
calls for a minimum of 480 sounds, including at
least 9 drum sets and 51 types of effects
(reverb, chorus, and variations), among a host
of control-change messages. Roland’s GS stan-
dard, on the other hand, requires at least 226
different instrument patches and 20 different
control-change messages, among other things.
If you use a GS or XG synthesizer to compose
your music, you may be disappointed if you play
that composition back on a synthesizer that
doesn’t have the GS or XG enhancements; the
sound won’t be quite the same. You’ll get the
same instrument type (grand piano, for
instance) but the sound of the instrument will
be different. Also, if you used any of the addi-
tional MIDI messages contained in the GS and
XG protocols (control change, for example),
they won’t be understood by the non-GS or XG
device.

✦A sound generator: This device is what enables you to hear the music
and may be a synthesizer, drum machine, sound module, or sampler.
✦A MIDI controller: This is the device that actually controls the MIDI
instruments in your studio. You’ll most likely use the MIDI functions in
Pro Tools for this purpose. This may also be your keyboard, electronic
drum pads, or other MIDI instruments (such as the Roland GK2a).
✦A sequencer: This device records and plays the MIDI performances that
are programmed into it. The sequencer allows you to program your part
into the synthesizer and have it play back automatically (much like the
old-time player piano). Again, you’ll most likely use Pro Tools software
for this, but you could use a sequencer in your keyboard if you prefer.
✦A MIDI interface: The MIDI interface is used to enable your computer to
send and receive MIDI data. If you have a Digi 001, Digi 002, or Digi 002
Rack you already have MIDI ports in your hardware (sorry, Mbox users,
you have to buy a separate MIDI interface).
I know this sounds like a lot of stuff, but most of this gear performs more than
one function in the MIDI studio. For example, nearly all synthesizers come
with drum sounds, and some synthesizers even include a sequencer. In this
case, this one synthesizer can do the job of sound generator, drum machine,
MIDI controller, and sequencer all in one.
In the following sections, I discuss the different types of sound generators.
Although you may find one piece of equipment that does everything you
want, in this section, I separate all the features different equipment may
have to help you understand the function of each feature and decide for
yourself how to configure your studio.
Sound generators
The sound generator is the core of the MIDI studio. This is what produces
the sounds that you hear. Without it, you may as well skip the rest of the
stuff because, of course, you won’t hear any of your work.
Sound generators can come in many different shapes and sizes: There’s the
fully functional keyboard synthesizer, the independent drum machine, the
standalone sound module, samplers, software synthesizers (soft-synths),
and the computer sound card. Each of these devices has its strengths and
weaknesses. (Read on for the details.)
Synthesizer
A synthesizer, like the one shown in Figure 4-3, consists of not only sounds,
but also a keyboard on which you can play these sounds. Synthesizers come
in a variety of sizes and configurations. For example, some keyboards come
with 61 keys (5 octaves) while others provide as many 88 keys — the size of
an acoustic piano keyboard. 

Getting Started with MIDI
78
If you’re in the market for a synthesizer, you need to consider several things:
✦Polyphony: Polyphony is the number of notes that sound at one time.
Most decent synthesizers nowadays have at least 16 notes of polyphony,
although models that can produce 32 notes at once are not uncommon.
Each manufacturer treats polyphony differently, and the GM standards
allow some variations on the effective use of this parameter. For instance,
a synth patch may use more than one digital sound to create the actual
sound you hear. The synth patch that you love so much may, in fact, con-
sist of four different sounds layered on top of one another. In such a case,
you just reduced your polyphony by three-fourths, just by using that one
patch. If your synthesizer has 16-note polyphony, it’s now down to 4-note
polyphony because each of those 4 notes has four “sounds” associated
with it. If you use this patch, you can play only 4 notes (a simple chord)
at a time, not the 16 that you thought you had to work with.
Your best bet is to buy a synthesizer (or sound module) with the highest
polyphony you can get, especially if you want to layer one sound on top
of another or do multitimbral parts with your synth.
✦Multitimbrality: Most decent keyboards allow you to play more than one
sound patch at a time. This is called multitimbrality, which basically allows
you to have your keyboard divided up into several groups of sounds. For
example, a multitimbral synth can divide a song’s chords, melody, bass
part, and drum-set sounds into different groups of sounds — and then
play all those groups at once.
If you do any sequencing (recording or playing back MIDI data), a multi-
timbral synth is a must-have. Otherwise, you would need a separate syn-
thesizer for each type of sound that you want to play. Fortunately, with
the GM standards, compatible synthesizers made in the last ten years
have the ability to play 16 sounds at once.
✦Keyboard feel: Some keyboards have weighted keys and feel like real
pianos, while other keyboards have a somewhat spongy action. If you’re

a trained piano player, a spongy keyboard might feel uncomfortable to
you. On the other hand, if you have no training in piano and don’t need
weighted keys, you don’t have to pay the extra money for that feature.
✦Sound quality: This is a subjective thing. Choose the synthesizer that
has the sounds you think you’ll use. I know this seems kind of obvious,
but buy the synthesizer whose sounds you like even if this means wait-
ing and saving up some more money before you can buy. If you buy a
synth that was a good deal but don’t love the sounds, you’ve wasted
your money because you’ll just end up buying the more expensive one
later anyway.
✦Built-in sequencer: Many keyboards contain a built-in sequencer, which
will allow you to program and play back your performance. Units like
these are usually called keyboard workstations or MIDI workstations
because they contain everything you need to create a song. If you’re con-
sidering one of these complete workstations, take a good, hard look at the
sequencer and the user interface — make sure that you like the way those
work for you. Each manufacturer treats the process of sequencing a little
differently; you can probably find one that fits your style of working.
Drum machine
A drum machine contains not only the sounds of the drum set and other
more exotic drums, but also a sequencer to allow you to program rhythms.
Figure 4-4 shows you a typical drum machine.
Most drum machines contain hundreds of drum sounds, numerous preset
rhythm patches, and the ability to program dozens of songs. All standalone
drum machines have pads on which you can play the part. The more
advanced drum machines can give your rhythms a more human feel. Effects,
such as reverb and delay, are also fairly common on the more advanced
drum machines.
Sound module
A sound module is basically a stripped-down version of a synthesizer or drum
machine. Sound modules don’t contain triggering devices (such as the keys
for the keyboard, hex pickups for the guitar, or pads for the drum machine).
What they do contain are a variety of sounds (often hundreds) that a master
controller or sequencer can trigger. The advantage to sound modules is they
take up little space and cost considerably less than their fully endowed coun-
terparts (the synths and drum machines, that is).
If you already have a master keyboard, then you may find that adding sound
modules is a cost- and space-effective way to add more sounds to your
system.

Samplers
A sampler is a sound module that contains short audio samples of real
instruments. Most samplers come with sound libraries containing hundreds
of different types of sounds, from acoustic pianos to snare drums to sound
effects. These sounds are often much more realistic than those that come in
some synthesizers.
The real purpose of a sampler is to allow you to record your own sounds.
For example, in the ’80s, it was cool to make a drum set out of unusual per-
cussive sounds. A snare drum could be the sound of a flushing toilet (don’t
laugh, I actually did this) or breaking glass. Tom-toms could be grunts set
to certain pitches. You’d be amazed at the strange stuff that people have
turned into music — all with the help of a sampler.
Another common use of a sampler is recording short sections of already
recorded songs. This can be a melodic or rhythmic phrase, a vocal cue, or a
single drum or synth sound. Sampling other songs is common in electronic
music, rap, and hip-hop (be careful of copyright issues before doing this,
however). If you’re into electronic music or hip-hop, you may find a sampler
a necessary addition to your studio.

Soft-synths
If you’ve chosen a computer-based system to run your home studio on,
your DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) software enables you to produce great
sounds by using soft-synth plug-ins. Soft-synths are basically software equiva-
lents of standalone synthesizers, sound modules, or samplers. As you can see
in Figure 4-5 a soft-synth’s GUI — its Graphical User Interface, the smiley face
that the software shows the world — is often designed to look just like a
piece of regular hardware, complete with “buttons” and “knobs.” 
Of course, soft-synths have their advantages and disadvantages:
✦Advantages: Soft-synths cost less than standalone units because no
hardware is involved.
✦Disadvantages: Unlike regular synthesizers, soft-synths use up proces-
sor power. This can slow down your computer system and prevent
you from recording as many audio tracks or applying as many effect
patches as you’d like. Another downside (depending on whom you talk
to) is that soft-synth programs may not sound quite as good as an exter-
nal synthesizer.
Countless soft-synth plug-ins are available for Pro Tools. Check out Digidesign’s
compatibility page for programs that will work with the soft-ware (www.
digidesign.com/compato).
Sound card
Most sound cards that you can put in your computer (or that come with a
computer) have General MIDI sounds in them. Depending on the quality of
your sound card, it may sound decent or border on unbearable.
Figure 4-5:

82
To find out if the GM sounds in your computer’s sound card are any good, go
ahead and play a MIDI file on your computer. First, do a search on the Internet
for MIDI files (just type MIDI into your favorite search engine). Some sites
require you to pay to download a song — especially for popular or familiar
tunes — but you can find many sites that allow you to choose a song to listen
to without downloading or paying a fee. Click a song and it’ll start playing
automatically. You’ll immediately know whether you like the sound of your
sound card.
If you bought a new sound card for your computer to record audio with,
you’ll generally find that the sounds are pretty good. And (happily) with
your audio program, you also have access to soft-synth patches.
MIDI controller
A MIDI controller is essentially what its name describes — it’s a device that
can control another MIDI device. MIDI controllers come in many different for-
mats. In fact, a MIDI controller can be anything from a synthesizer to a drum
machine, a computer to a xylophone.
When MIDI first came out, your controller choice was limited to a keyboard,
but now you can choose between keyboards, wind controllers (for saxo-
phones or other wind instruments), guitars, or drums. So even if you don’t
play piano, you can find a controller that resembles an instrument you know
MIDI control this . . . 
MIDI controllers aren’t just limited to those that
you can find in your musical instrument store.
In fact, a MIDI controller can be just about any-
thing that you can imagine. Creative musicians
have come up with interesting MIDI controllers,
including body suits that allow you to tap on or
move your body to trigger sounds.
You, too, can make your own MIDI controller.
All you need is a little imagination and some
basic building and electronics skills. For exam-
ple, one of my first electronic drumsets con-
sisted of kitchen pots and pans fitted with
electric pickups routed to a Roland Octapad.
This setup was easy to make. First, I attached
a piezoelectric pickup (which cost about $1
from an electrical supply company) to the
inside of a pan by using silicon caulk. Then I
connected the wires from the pickup to a cord
with a quarter-inch TS plug on the end. I
plugged the cord into the Octapad, and when I
hit the bottom of the pan, the Octapad sent a
MIDI message to my sampler. You can attach
these simple $1 piezoelectric pickups to just
about anything and trigger a sound source. (You
may need a device, such as the Roland
Octapad or other electronic drumset module, to
convert the signal from the piezo pickup into
MIDI messages.)

how to play. Look around, and you may find one (or more) MIDI controllers
that allow you to create music your way.
Sequencer
Although you can get standalone sequencers and sequencers integrated into
a synthesizer, you probably want to just use the sequencer in Pro Tools for
this. The reasons for this are many, but the overriding factor is that you can
have your MIDI and audio tracks in one place, and Pro Tools offers you more-
powerful editing capabilities than a sequencer that’s contained in a box and
that uses a tiny LCD screen.
MIDI interface
The MIDI interface allows you to send and receive MIDI information from a
computer. All Digidesign interfaces — with the exception of the Mbox —
have a MIDI port, but if you end up doing a lot of MIDI sequencing and use
more than one sound module or external controller, or if you have the Mbox,
you need a separate MIDI interface, such as the one shown in Figure 4-6.
MIDI interfaces come in a staggering variety of configurations, so there are
several things to consider when you buy a MIDI interface. The following
questions will help you to determine your needs:

✦What type of computer do you own? MIDI interfaces are configured to
connect to either a serial, parallel, or USB port. You determine which
one to use by the type of port(s) you have in your computer. For exam-
ple, new Macs only have a USB port, although you can add a serial port
if you remove the internal modem. A PC has either a parallel port or a
USB port (sometimes both). PCs also have a joystick port, which
accepts a special MIDI joystick cable (no MIDI interface is needed).
✦How many instruments do you intend to connect? MIDI interfaces
come with a variety of input and output configurations. There are
models with two “ins” and two “outs,” four “ins” and four “outs,” and
even eight “ins” and eight “outs.” There are also “thru” boxes that have
one or more inputs and several outputs. If you have only one or two
instruments, you can get by with a smaller interface (in this case a 2x2
interface — two “ins” and two “outs” — would work great). If you have
many instruments that you want to connect, you need a larger box.

 Looking at the various types of microphones
 Positioning microphones for the best sound
 Exploring a variety of preamps
 Taking care of your microphones
A
microphone’s job is generally to try to capture, as closely as possible,
the sound of an instrument. But you can also use a microphone to
infuse a specific sound characteristic into a performance. Likewise, a
preamp — which boosts the signal of a microphone as it travels to the
recorder — can be used to accurately represent a sound or to add texture
and dimension to it. The fact is that microphones and preamps are the
center of the sound engineer’s palette. Just as a painter has his paints and
brushes, you have your microphones and preamps. And just as a painter
can create a stunning variety of visual textures with his tools, you too can
make your creative statement with the judicious use of these two pieces of
equipment.
In this chapter, you explore the two most versatile tools of your auditory
craft. You look at the various types of microphones and preamps, and you
gain an understanding of each one’s role in capturing a performance. You
also discover what types of mics and preamps work for particular situa-
tions. To top it off, this chapter guides you through purchasing and caring
for your precious new friends (the mics and preamps, that is). You can find
out how to use your mics in Book 3, Chapter 2, where I discuss specific mic-
placement options.
Meeting the Many Microphone Types
When you start looking at microphones, you’ll find basically three different
types of construction methods (dynamic, condenser, ribbon) and three
basic polarity patterns (omnidirectional, figure-8, and cardioid). This sec-
tion explores these various constructions and patterns and helps you make
sense of them.

Meeting the Many Microphone Types
86
Construction types
Whether a microphone is a $10 cheapie that has a cord permanently attached
to it or a $15,000 pro model with gold-plated fittings, all microphones convert
sound waves to electrical impulses that the preamp or mixer can read and the
recorder can store. Each of the three construction types captures this auditory
signal in a different way, and as such, each adds certain characteristics to the
sound. Here’s how the different mics affect sound:
✦Ribbon: Adds silkiness to the recorded sound because it rolls off the
higher frequencies slightly.
✦Dynamic: Tends to accent the middle of the frequency spectrum.
✦Condenser: Tends to have a well-rounded frequency response.
I detail these aspects in the following sections. In most cases, the type of
construction dictates the general cost category in which the mics fit. 
Condenser microphones
The condenser microphone is, without a doubt, the most popular style of
microphone used in recording studios (home or commercial). Condenser
mics are sensitive and accurate, but they can also be expensive. Recently,
however, condenser mics have come down in cost, and you can buy a decent
one for around $200. Very good ones start at about $500.
The condenser microphone has an extremely thin metal (or metal-coated
plastic or Mylar) diaphragm (the part that senses the signal). The diaphragm
is suspended in front of a metal plate (called a backplate). Polarizing voltage
is applied to both the diaphragm and the backplate, creating a static charge
in the space between them. When the diaphragm picks up a sound, it vibrates
into the field between it and the backplate. This produces a small signal that
can then be amplified. Figure 5-1 shows how a condenser mic is constructed.
Condenser mics need a small amount of voltage (between 9 and 48 volts) to
function. If you use a condenser mic, make sure that it has its own internal
battery — or that you have a preamp or mixer equipped with phantom
power. (Not sure what phantom power means? You’re in luck. The next sec-
tion will enlighten you.)
Phantom power?
Phantom power is the small amount of voltage applied to run a condenser
microphone properly. In most cases, the phantom power comes from your
mixer or preamp and is sent to the microphone through one of the wires in
the XLR cable. (I cover XLR cables in Chapter 3.) Some condenser mics have
an internal battery or separate power supply that provides this power.

Book I
Chapter 5
Understanding
Microphones
Meeting the Many Microphone Types
87
A switch, which is usually located on the preamp or mixer, enables you to turn
the phantom power off and on. Even though dynamic microphones don’t use
phantom power, this small amount of voltage doesn’t damage them.
Tube or solid state?
Condenser mics can be made with transistors (these are solid-state mics) or
vacuum tubes (tube mics). As with all gear that offers a choice between tube
and solid state, base your decision on the sound characteristics that you
prefer. For the most part, tube condenser mics have a softer high end (though
not necessarily less high end) and a warmer overall tone. Solid-state mics, on
the other hand, are often more transparent — they capture the sound with less
coloration, sometimes with a bit greater clarity.
Large- or small-diaphragm?
Condenser mics come in two broad categories: small-diaphragm and large-
diaphragm (see Figure 5-2). Large-diaphragm condenser mics are more popu-
lar than their small-diaphragm counterparts; they offer a more pronounced
bottom end (low frequencies). Large-diaphragm mics also make less self
noise, which is electronic noise created by the microphone.
Before you go out and buy only large-diaphragm mics, consider this: Small-
diaphragm condenser mics often have an even frequency response and can
more accurately capture instruments with a pronounced high-frequency
component (violins, for instance).

Dynamic microphones
Chances are you’ve had a chance to use a dynamic mic. Two hugely popular
Shure models characterize this type of mic — the SM57 and the SM58, which
has a silvery ball of gridded wire at one end and an XLR connector at the
other. Dynamic microphones have several qualities that make them unique.
First, they can handle a lot of volume (technically known as SPL, meaning
Sound Pressure Level), which makes them perfect for extremely loud signals,
such as drums, amplifiers, and some rock vocals. Dynamic mics are not as
transparent as condenser mics (they don’t represent high frequencies as
accurately), so they often impart a “dirty” or “gritty” sound to the signal. 
The dynamic microphone uses a magnetic field to convert the sound impulse
from the diaphragm into electrical energy (as in Figure 5-3). The diaphragm,
often made of plastic or Mylar, is located in front of a coil of wire called a
voice coil. The voice coil is suspended between two magnets. When the
diaphragm moves (the result of a sound), the voice coil moves as well. The
interaction between the voice coil’s movement and the magnets creates the
electrical signal.
The sound of a dynamic mic can be described as somewhat boxy, meaning
that these mics don’t represent the highest or lowest frequencies of your

diaphragms.

89
hearing spectrum accurately (not necessarily a bad thing). They are also
durable. Rough treatment probably won’t damage them much (aside from
the diaphragm, which a tough metal screen protects). Dynamic mics are the
type used most often for live shows. They tend to be inexpensive to buy and
easy to maintain; you can get a good dynamic mic for around $100.
Ribbon microphones
A ribbon microphone produces its sound in much the same way as a dynamic
mic. The diaphragm is suspended between two magnets. The ribbon mic uses
a thin ribbon of aluminum (see Figure 5-4) instead of the plastic or Mylar you’d
find in a dynamic mic. Although ribbon mics were very popular from around
the 1930s to the 1960s, they’ve mostly taken a backseat to condenser mics in
today’s studios. This is mainly because they are fragile, expensive, and aren’t
as transparent as condenser mics. In fact, a gust of wind or a strong breath
into the diaphragm is all it takes to break a ribbon mic.
Ribbon mics are experiencing a renaissance because a lot of recording engi-
neers are searching for an old, vintage sound. Ribbon mics have a unique
sound that is often described as silky or smooth. This essentially means that
the high frequencies tend to roll off (gradually reduce) slightly, and the lower
frequencies smear together a bit. 
Ribbon mics are fairly expensive. You’d be hard pressed to find a new one
for much less than $1,000.
Polarity patterns
Microphones pick up sounds in different ways, which are known as polarity
patterns. Here’s how the various patterns work:

✦Omnidirectional mics can capture sounds all around them.
✦Cardioid (or directional) mics pick up sounds just in front of them.
✦Figure-8 (or bidirectional) mics pick up sounds from both the front
and back.
Omnidirectional
The omnidirectional mic is able to pick up sounds coming from anywhere
around it. Omnidirectional mics are useful for situations where you want to
capture not only the source sound, but also the sound of the room it’s coming
from. You can find omnidirectional mics used in stereo pairs, suspended over
drum sets to capture the whole sound of the kit, or used overhead to pick up
groups of acoustic instruments (such as orchestras).

Omnidirectional mics are not generally used for close miking — placing the
mic less than a foot from the sound source — because they tend to catch too
much background noise. You can see the pick-up pattern of an omnidirec-
tional mic in Figure 5-5. The round pattern shows that the mic picks up
sound from all directions.
Cardioid
Cardioid microphones pick up the sound in front of them and reject any sounds
that come from behind. Cardioid mics are the most common for live bands
because you can control the sound that they pick up. If you have a cardioid mic
on the tom-tom of a drum set, for example, the mic picks up only the sound of
that drum and not the sound from the other instruments around it.

The three types of cardioid microphones are cardioid, super-cardioid, and
hyper-cardioid. The differences among the types of cardioid patterns of each
mic aren’t that great. Check out the graphs in Figure 5-6 to see how the
polarity patterns of cardioid microphones differ.
Generally, you don’t need to think about the minor polarity-pattern differ-
ences among the types of cardioid mics when you buy or use a microphone.
You won’t notice the practical differences in the way these three types of
mics work.
Figure-8
Figure-8 mics (also called bidirectional) pick up sound from both the front
and back, but not all the way around. If you take a look at the graph in Figure
5-7, you can see that sound is not effectively picked up from areas on either
side of the microphone.
Figure-8 mics are often used to record two instruments simultaneously. For
example, you can place the microphone between two horn players with the
side of the mic perpendicular to the players. This allows you to capture both
instruments while eliminating any sound in front of the musicians.
Most figure-8 condenser mics have the same frequency response for both
the front and back sides, but some ribbon mics produce very different
responses that depend on whether the sound is coming from the front or the
back. For instance, a Royer r121 ribbon mic picks up more high frequencies
from behind the mic than from in front. You can use this to your advantage
when recording an instrument. If the sound is too rich in low frequencies,
just turn the mic around a little — or a lot, depending on how much of the
high frequencies you want to add. (More on this in Book 3, Chapter 2.)

Multiple-pattern mics
Some condenser microphones can change their pick-up patterns. You can
choose from cardioid, omni, or figure-8 (as in Figure 5-8). These mics (gener-
ally they’re large-diaphragm) can do this trick because they usually contain
two sets of diaphragms and backplates, positioned back-to-back. You may
want to have at least one multiple-pattern mic around to give you more
variety in microphone positions.
The omni pattern in a multiple-pattern microphone works (and sounds) dif-
ferently from a true omnidirectional mic. For critical applications (recording
an orchestra, for instance), you may not find that a multiple-pattern mic is a
fair substitute for an exclusively omnidirectional mic.

Buying the Right Microphone for You
Buying microphones is, without a doubt, one of the most critical decisions
that you’ll make when setting up your home studio. Using the right micro-
phone for the job can mean the difference between an okay track and a truly
spectacular one.
As recently as just a few years ago, your choice in microphones was between
inexpensive dynamic mics (what most home recordists could afford) and
expensive condenser or ribbon mics (what the pro studios had). But, as luck
would have it, you’ve entered a time in home recording where your options
are much more diverse. In fact, a whole line of project-studio mics has recently
emerged. This is a new market that manufacturers have found to be hugely
profitable, so the choices are expanding almost daily. In some cases, a $500
project-studio mic can rival a $2,000-plus pro mic — at least for the home
recordist’s purposes.
So the question that you’re inevitably going to ask is, “What microphones
should I get for my home studio?” Good question. And the answer is, “Well, it
depends on what you need.” So before I go into detail about what mics might

be best for you, try to spend a minute assessing your needs. These questions
may help you figure out what your needs are:
✦What type of music will you record? If you play rock or pop music, you
probably want to start with dynamic mics because they’re inexpensive
and their limitations in high or low frequencies don’t matter as much as
they would if (for example) you wanted to record your string quartet. In
this case, a pair of condenser mics would do the trick.
✦What instruments will you record? Loud amps, drums, and screaming
singers beg to be recorded with dynamic mics, whereas light percussion,
vocals, and stand-up basses shine through with large-diaphragm con-
denser mics.
✦How many mics will you use at once? If you need to record your whole
band at once, budget constraints may dictate your choice between
dynamic and condenser mics or a condenser or ribbon mic for vocals. If
you need only a couple of mics to record the occasional vocal or instru-
ment, then you can invest more in each mic.
How many, what kind
You will likely build your microphone collection over time rather than buying
all your mics at once. This is the best way to buy mics, because it gives you
time to develop an understanding of what you can do with the microphone
that you have before you plunk down your money for another. You’re better
off having a few mics that best fit your situation than a whole bunch of mics
that just sorta work for you.
If you’re like most people, your budget dictates how many mics you can buy
and what kind they might be. In this section, I try to help you get the best
mics for your recording needs and guide you through the process of slowly
accumulating microphones.
Before you go out and buy a ton of mics, know this: Many digital systems
have an effect called a mic simulator — a program that allows you to use a
relatively inexpensive mic and get the sound of a much more-expensive one.
If your system has a mic-simulator program (you can find out by searching
through your system’s effects patches), then I recommend getting a basic
dynamic mic first. You may find that you like the way the mic simulator
sounds and discover that you don’t need as many mics as you thought.
Getting started
A basic mic setup consists of a couple of dynamic mics for drums, guitar
amps, or other loud instruments and a decent condenser mic for vocals or
other acoustic instruments. You can buy a good, sturdy all-around dynamic
mic for under $100; a lower-end (but nice-sounding) condenser mic costs
around $200.

Buying the Right Microphone for You

For most home recordists, a large-diaphragm condenser mic is the first con-
denser mic. These are good all-around mics that can work well for a lot of
applications.
Movin’ on
After you have your basic mics, you can start to add a few more. If you intend
to record your band, you need to at least mic the drum set (four mics will get
you around the set). In this case, you can add a couple more dynamic mics
and start thinking about getting one or two that are designed for particular
applications. For instance, you can find mics on the market that are made to
work best on the kick drum of a drum set. 
At this point, you can also get a second condenser mic — maybe a small-
diaphragm condenser mic this time or a large-diaphragm tube condenser.
You may want to choose one that sounds different from the one you already
have, or, if you love the one you have, you can get a second one just like it so
you have a stereo pair.
Going all out
As your mic collection grows, you’ll probably start looking for a vocal mic
that works best for your voice. In this case, you may look at large-diaphragm
tube condenser mics or even a ribbon mic.
After this, your next step might be to buy a stereo pair of omnidirectional
mics for drum overheads (mics placed over the drum set) or other multi-
instrument applications. 
Detailing applications
Certain mics work better than others for particular situations. In this sec-
tion, I try to present some typical applications to give you an idea of what
types of mics are traditionally used for various purposes. (You can find more
ideas about mic usage in Book 3, Chapter 2, where I discuss specific miking
techniques.)
When you consider a mic, think about the frequency spectrum of the instru-
ment(s) you’re recording. If you use a dynamic mic for a symphonic orches-
tra performance, for example, you’ll be disappointed by the results because
it lacks an accurate high-frequency response. On the other hand, using a
small-diaphragm condenser mic on the tom-toms of a drum set makes them
sound thin and is a waste of money because you can get by with a much less
expensive dynamic mic for this purpose.

Microphone choice is fairly subjective. The following list contains some
basic suggestions, based on what’s typically used in the recording industry.
You may choose a different type of mic, especially if you try to create a cer-
tain effect. For instance, using a ribbon mic on a metallic shaker rather than
a small-diaphragm condenser mic softens the highest frequencies of the
instrument and gives it a mellower sound.
✦Vocals: Most people prefer the sound of a large-diaphragm condenser
mic for vocals. If you have the budget, you may also want to audition
some ribbon mics for your voice. A dynamic mic is best when you’re
going for a dirty or raw sound (excellent for some harder rock, blues, or
punk music) or if your singer insists on screaming into the mic. A small-
diaphragm condenser mic is rarely the first choice for most singers, but
not out of the question for some female vocalists if you don’t mind a
bright, present sound (pronounced high frequency).
✦Electric guitar amp: A dynamic mic or a small-diaphragm condenser
works well on an electric guitar amp. Some people use large-diaphragm
condenser mics on guitar amps and like the added low frequencies that
can result.
✦Electric bass amp: Your first choice when miking an amplified electric
bass is either a large-diaphragm condenser mic or a dynamic mic. Either
one can capture the frequency spectrum that the bass guitar encom-
passes. Small-diaphragm condenser mics aren’t a good choice because
of their inherent high frequency focus. 
✦Acoustic guitar and other stringed instruments: A large or small-
diaphragm condenser mic or a ribbon mic works well in most instances.
A dynamic mic has too limited a frequency response to create a natural
sound (but may create an effect that you like). Choose the large or small-
diaphragm based upon the overall frequency spectrum of the instru-
ment. For example, if you want to capture the depth of a guitar’s tone,
choose a large-diaphragm mic, but for an instrument with a higher regis-
ter, such as a violin or mandolin, a small-diaphragm mic works great.
✦Drum set: The tom-toms, snare drum, and kick (bass) drum all sound
good with dynamic mics because they don’t put out any high frequen-
cies. You can also use large-diaphragm condenser mics, but be careful
where you place them — if your drummer hits them, they’re toast.
✦Cymbals: For the cymbals of a drum set, a pair of small-diaphragm 
condenser mics works well, although some people prefer to use large-
diaphragm mics instead. Many old-timers are using ribbon mics on 
cymbals when they record digitally to give the mics a softer sound. A
dynamic mic would lack the high-frequency response needed to make
the cymbals shine through in a mix.
✦Miscellaneous percussion: Now, here’s a broad category. By miscella-
neous, I mean shakers, triangles, maracas, and other higher-pitched 

Buying the Right Microphone for You
98
percussion toys. For these instruments, you’ll find that either small or
large-diaphragm condenser mics work well. If it’s a very quiet instru-
ment, a large-diaphragm mic is preferable because of the higher self
noise of the small-diaphragm mic.
If you intend to record loud instruments — drums, amplified guitars, or
basses — look for a mic with a high SPL (Sound-Pressure Level) — a rating of
how much volume (listed as decibels) the microphone can handle before
distorting. A high SPL is above 130 decibels.
Some professional condenser mics have a pad switch that allows you to
reduce the sensitivity of the mic, thereby increasing how well it can handle
high sound-pressure levels.
Partnering with preamps
One of the most important relationships in your home studio is the one
between your microphones and the preamp — the nice bit of hardware that
boosts the mic’s signal so it can be recorded. The greatest microphone in
the world is wasted if it’s run through a cheap preamp. By the same token, a
cheap mic plugged into a great preamp sounds only as good as the bad mic.
Your Digidesign hardware comes with at least two preamps (Book 2, Chap-
ter 2 details each piece of hardware). This may be enough for you, but you
may want a separate preamp if you want a different (better) sound, or if you
need more inputs than your hardware provides.
For the most part, the preamps in the Digidesign hardware are more than ade-
quate until your engineering skills are way up there. I recommend using them
and spending your money on some decent mics first. (Unless, of course, you
need more preamps than those that come with your hardware.)
You can find three types of preamps in the marketplace — solid-state, vacuum-
tube, and hybrid — and each has its own characteristics. In this section, you
get a chance to explore some preamp styles and discover how each relates to
the sounds produced by the types of microphones I discussed earlier in the
chapter. This can help you to start considering the relationship between the
microphone and preamp in your studio.
Solid-state
Solid-state preamps use transistors to boost the level of the microphone.
Solid-state preamps can be designed to produce as clear and detailed (that
is, “transparent”) a sound as possible or can be designed to create a pleasing
level of distortion (warmth) for your music. Solid-state preamps cost any-
where from a couple hundred to several thousand dollars.

Book I
Chapter 5
Understanding
Microphones
Buying the Right Microphone for You
99
A good clean, clear, solid-state preamp (such as those from the Earthworks
or GML brands) is a great choice if you want as natural a sound as possible
on your recording of an instrument or if you are using a microphone that has
a sound quality that you want to hear as clearly as possible. For example, I
particularly like the way a solid-state preamp works in conjunction with a
tube condenser or ribbon mic. The warmth and smoothness of these types
of microphones shines through clearly with a clean solid-state preamp.
On the other hand, a more aggressive (warm or pleasingly distorted) solid-
state preamp, such as those modeled after the classic Neve designs, can add
just a touch of “grit” to certain instruments. These types of preamps are
great with dynamic, ribbon, or condenser mics, especially when recording
drums, guitar, and some vocals.
Tube
Tube preamps use vacuum tubes to process and amplify the microphone’s
signal. This generally adds some coloration to the sound of your mic (how
much and what kind of coloration depends on the particular preamp). As
you’ve undoubtedly discovered after reading any other chapter in this book,
digital recording aficionados love the sound of tube gear, especially tube 
preamps. The advantage with a tube preamp is that it can add a nice warm
sound to your mics. The disadvantage is that you often can’t get rid of this
colored sound. Professional recording engineers often have several tube pre-
amps in their studios to give them different coloration options.
The preamps included in your mixer are solid-state. If you find that you want
the colored sound of a tube preamp, you have to buy an external one.
Tube preamps are great for imparting a subtle low-frequency addition to the
sound of the microphone signal. Tube preamps also seem to soften the higher
frequencies slightly. If you’re like most people, you’ll find the addition of a
tube preamp to be welcome, especially if you intend to record rock, blues, or
acoustic jazz music. The downside is that all-tube preamps are expensive,
with the least expensive costing about $1,000 (the Peavey VMP-2) and most
running several thousand dollars (for brands such as Manley Labs).
I prefer to use tube preamps with drums and any “woody” instrument
(acoustic guitar, for instance). In this case, I often find myself reaching for a
large-diaphragm condenser mic, and in extreme cases, I might even use a
large-diaphragm tube condenser mic with the tube preamp (for an extra dose
of “tubiness”).
Hybrid
A hybrid preamp contains both solid-state and tube components to boost the
mic’s signal. Most of the inexpensive (under $1,000) “tube” preamps that you
find in the marketplace are actually hybrids. An advantage to this design

Buying the Right Microphone for You
100
approach is that the preamp can often be adjusted to give you varying degrees
of that warm tube sound. The disadvantage is that these relatively inexpensive
“tube” preamps won’t have as clear a sound as a great solid-state preamp, and
they won’t have quite the same pleasing character as an expensive all-tube
preamp. 
For most home recordists, this type of preamp offers a lot of flexibility and
can allow you to get either a fairly clear, open sound of a solid-state preamp
or a warm, colored sound characteristic of a classic tube preamp. If you can
afford only one external preamp, you might find a great solution in one of
these hybrid versions.
The countless hybrid preamps on the market vary widely. (In fact, most of the
hybrid preamps are actually marketed as tube preamps.) Your best bet in
choosing a hybrid (or any preamp, for that matter) is to do some research.
Talk to people, read reviews, visit Internet forums, and then audition the two
or three that stand out to you. Choose the one that you think sounds best for
your needs.
Considering compressors
A compressor enables you to alter the dynamic range of an instrument.
Along with the microphone and preamp, the compressor is often added to
the signal chain before it goes to the mixer. The advantage of using the com-
pressor in the signal chain before it hits the mixer is that you can control the
transients of an instrument so it doesn’t overload your converters and
create digital distortion.
The compressor plug-ins in Pro Tools are of no use to you if you want to con-
trol the transients of an instrument because they are located after the con-
verters. If you don’t want to use (or can’t afford) an external compressor,
keep your input level down a bit when you record (Book 3, Chapter 3 covers
setting levels in detail).
If you record a lot of vocals or real drums, a decent external compressor
may be a good idea. You can find some great-sounding compressors for as
little as $200. (Check out my Web site at www.jeffstrong.com for some
great “bang-for-the-buck” compressor finds.)
Preamp, compressor, and equalizer combos
As long as you’re looking at preamps and compressors, take a look at some
channel-strip devices — combos that integrate preamp, compressor, and
equalizer. For some people (maybe you), a channel-strip device is the way to
go. Using just one unit cuts down on the number of cords, and it’s designed
to make the three parts function well together. Quite a few great-sounding
channel-strip devices are available for under $500.

Analyzing some microphone accessories
Along with your new mics, you’re going to need a few accessories. These
include mic cords, stands, and pop filters.
Microphone cords
Microphone cords can cost anywhere from about $10 up to several hundred
dollars. You’re probably asking yourself, “Is there really a difference between
a $10 or $20 mic cable and one that sells for hundreds of dollars?”
My answer is, “Supposedly, but chances are, you’ll never hear it.” Let me
qualify this answer a little. Unless you have very good microphones, pre-
amps, A/D and D/A converters, mixer, recorder, and monitors, you’re wasting
your money on expensive microphone cords. I know only one sound engi-
neer (not me, though — I’ve spent too many years behind the drums) who
claims that he can actually hear the difference between an average mic cord
and one of the expensive ones. And he says that the difference is very
subtle. (It would have to be — otherwise I’d hear the difference too.)
Don’t waste your money on an expensive mic cord (or any cord) until you’ve
got such kickin’ equipment that the cord is the weakest link in your signal
chain. By then, spending a couple hundred dollars on a cord will seem like
pennies because you’ll already have invested tens of thousands of dollars in
top-quality gear.
Stands
A sturdy stand is essential if you intend to mic anything in your studio.
Studio mics can get a bit cumbersome, and decent mic stands are relatively
inexpensive — so try to resist the temptation to buy a flimsy stand. A good
mic stand has a sturdy base and can securely hold your mics.
Good mic stands cost about $30 and have either a round, cast-iron base (great
for getting into tight spaces) or a tripod base (superior stability). Either one
works well. Check out Figure 5-9 to see these two types of stands.
Pop filters
A pop filter is a nylon screen that is used to eliminate the “pops” (technically
called plosives) that singers make when they sing. Plosives are the result of
sudden bursts of air projected into the mic (from singing words starting with
Ps and Ts, for example). If you record vocals, a pop filter is a must-have.
Pop filters are relatively inexpensive, but if you want to make your own, you
can with a pair of tights or pantyhose and a coat hanger. Bend the coat hanger
into a circle and stretch the nylons or pantyhose over it. You can attach the
coat hanger to the mic stand by using duct tape. Adjust it so the pop filter is

Buying the Right Microphone for You

about 4 to 6 inches away from the microphone. Have the singer sing through
it. Check out Figure 5-10 for a look at a homemade pop filter.

After investing hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars in microphones, you
probably want to know how to take care of them properly. Caring for or stor-
ing your microphones isn’t rocket science. Just follow the general guidelines
and ideas that follow, and you’ll keep your mics in tip-top shape.

A good microphone lasts a lifetime. Take care of your mics, and they’ll offer
you years of service.
Daily care
Probably the most important thing to keep in mind when using your mics is
to resist the temptation to blow into them. I know you’ve probably seen the
doof on stage blow into a mic and yell, “Test — is this thing on?” to see if it’s
working. And some folks figure that’s how the pros must check their mics —
well, it isn’t. Blowing into a mic is one of the worst ways to test it — and for
some sensitive models (like those expensive ribbon mics), it’s a sure way to
literally blow the diaphragm. If you want to check to see whether a mic is
working, then just speak into it in a normal voice.
There is no need to blow or yell into any mic, unless, of course, you’re singer’s
style is to yell into the mic and you’re trying to set the input level. In this case,
offer him or her your trusty dynamic mic and keep that expensive ribbon mic
hidden.
Another thing to keep in mind when handling your mics is that they can be
fragile. Condenser and ribbon mics don’t survive rough handling well. In
fact, if you drop a condenser or ribbon mic, you may break it. (This is a good
reason to have a sturdy stand.) Dynamic mics, on the other hand, are more
durable, which is why they are often used for live applications and on drums
(where it’s not uncommon for an overzealous drummer to whack them by
accident — as a drummer, I know about this firsthand). 
Try to keep your mics away from dust and high humidity. Dust is probably
the number-one enemy of a microphone; it can settle on the diaphragm and
lessen the sensitivity of the mic — even alter its frequency response. Always
cover your mics or put them away when you’re not using them.
Storing
Most professionals have mic lockers where they can safely keep the mics
that aren’t in use. Mic lockers can look a number of ways. You can make a
special locked box fitted with foam padding that has a cutout for each mic,
or you can keep your mics in their pouches or cases (if they came with
them) in a closet or cabinet.
Regardless of the type of storage cabinet you have, try to handle your mics
as little as possible. In fact, if you have a mic that you use a lot, you’re often
better off leaving it on a secure stand between sessions instead of dragging it
in and out of its case or storage cabinet.

Book I
Chapter 5

Microphones
Caring for Your Microphones
105
If you do leave your mic out on its stand when it’s not in use, cover it with a
plastic bag and close the open end around the mic. (See Figure 5-11.) This
keeps off the dust.
Humidity can also be a problem for microphones. If you live in a humid envi-
ronment, store your mics with a bag of silica gel next to them. (Silica gel is
the stuff that comes in the packaging of a lot electronic gear. It absorbs mois-
ture.) You can find silica gel listed as desiccant packets (Desi Pak) by the
manufacturer. You can order silica gel in quantities as little as ten from
Hydrosorbent Products, P.O. Box 437, 25 School Street, Ashley Falls, MA
01222 (www.dehumidify.com/desipak.html). 
You can also do an Internet search using the term, Desi Pak.

ro Tools works well on both Macs and PCs, so no matter which type of
computer you prefer, you can make good music without much hassle.
However, there are a few things you need to do to your computer — and
certain hardware requirements you need to observe — to run Pro Tools
successfully.
This chapter gets you up to speed on these areas. You also walk through the
process of setting up and configuring your system and installing the software.
As an added attraction I’ve included some advice on how to keep the bugs at
bay. (You know, those nasty computer hiccups that can keep you from captur-
ing your best guitar solo or, worse yet, losing it after the fact.) 
Using Pro Tools on a Mac
Getting up and going on a Mac is easy. Once you have a computer that has the
right specs (which I cover in this section) it will take you less than 15 minutes
to be ready to plug in your hardware (I cover this in Book 2, Chapter 2) and
start recording (covered in Book 3). This section takes you through, step by
step, the process of turning your Mac into a lean, mean, audio recording
machine.
Understanding system requirements
One of the great things about Macintosh computers is that they’re isn’t a lot
of variables. Almost any Mac will be able to record audio using Pro Tools.
(Well, as long as it meets the basic system requirements. See the following
Remember icon.) There are a few things, however, that you need to know to
record well. These are covered in this section.

Using Pro Tools on a Mac
110
The best way to ensure that the computer you own or are considering
buying will work with Pro Tools and the Digidesign hardware that you want
is to go to the compatibility page on Digidesign’s Web site at
www.digidesign.com/compato/
Choose the hardware and operating system you use (or intend to use) to see
what will work with it. 
Since the people at Digidesign can’t test all possible hardware options, you
might also want to check out the Digidesign User’s Conference (DUC) for any
topics covering hardware issues. That Web page is: duc.digidesign.com/.
There is a section down the page dedicated to Pro Tools for Macs.
Knowing which Mac to buy
For the most part, any PowerBook, G4 with the AGP graphics card, and most
G5s. (The newest ones often take a few weeks for Digidesign to add to its list
of compatible computers.) In addition, iMacs, iBooks and eMacs may work
but you will need to check out the compatibility documents for the hardware
and operating system you intend to use on the Digidesign Web site. (Again,
the Web address for that is www.digidesign.com/compato/.) 
The Digidesign interface you have dictates what type of computer you can
use. For example, if you have a Digi 001, you need a computer with an open
PCI slot. This eliminates everything except the G4. The G5 is off the list too,
because it uses a PCI configuration that is incompatible with the Digi 001.
The Digi 002 and 002 Rack both require a FireWire port on the computer.
This covers just about all the newer Macs. The Mbox uses a USB connection
so make sure that your computer of choice has at least one USB port (they
all should).
Opting on an operating system
Even though many people still get by using OS 9, OS X is the operating
system you really need to use to get the most out of the newest Pro Tools
software. All new Macs are being shipped with OS X and some Digidesign
hardware, such as the 002 Rack, only works on OS X. As well, Pro Tools
version 6 won’t work on OS 9. 
If you have an older computer that runs OS 9 and can’t upgrade to X, you’re
stuck using version 5 of the Pro Tools software and choosing between the
002, M-Box, and 001. These options work fine, but I’ve got to tell you that OS
X is a much better operating system than OS 9. Also, Pro Tools version 6.1 is
far superior to version 5. Bottom line: I think the pain (and cost) of upgrad-
ing is worth it. I strongly suggest that you upgrade as soon as you can —
even if this means buying a new computer.

Your Computer

Recognizing your RAM needs
Pro Tools requires at least 384MB of RAM (Random Access Memory), but I
say go for broke here. Get as much RAM as your system can hold. And don’t
buy the cheap stuff — get high-quality RAM. The only thing to remember is
that for Pro Tools versions prior to 6.1, the maximum RAM that you can have
in your system is 1.5GB. 6.1 and above will handle 2GB. If you have more RAM
than Pro Tools can handle, you get an error message at startup and Pro Tools
won’t boot.
Getting a handle on hard drives
Pro Tools (and any other audio-recording software for that matter) likes to
have more than one hard drive. In fact, I’ll go as far as to say that Pro Tools
needs more than one hard drive to run properly. My advice? Get two drives:
One drive for all your system files and software, and the other for all your
audio and MIDI files. Here’s a look at how to organize them:
✦Drive one: The system drive. For your system drive you can use the stock
drive that came with your computer — but if you have a choice, I recom-
mend getting one with a spindle speed (also known as rotational speed, the
speed at which the hard drive spins) of 7,200 rpm. You’ll be much happier
and Pro Tools will be much happier too. And get a big one — hard drive,
that is. 
There is no need to partition your drive even if you have other programs
such as finance or word-processing software on your computer. In fact,
doing so may slow down your system.
✦Drive two: The audio drive. It used to be that you needed a good high-
speed SCSI drive to record and playback audio reliably, but this isn’t the
case anymore. You can use both IDE and FireWire drives for storing
audio; just make sure that you have a drive with the following (or better)
specs:
• Spindle speed: Also called rotational speed, this is the rate at which
the hard drive spins. For the most part, a 7,200-rpm drive will work
well for recording and playing back audio.
• Seek time: This is the amount of time that it takes the drive to find
the data that’s stored on it. You want an average seek time under 10
milliseconds (ms). Get as low as you can. (I prefer a seek time of 8 to
9 ms.)
• Buffer size: Often called a cache buffer, buffers are memory units
that store data as it’s being transferred. You want a buffer size of at
least 512K, but get one as big as you can. I recommend a drive with
an 8 MB buffer.

Using Pro Tools on a Mac
112
• Chipset: If you use a FireWire drive make sure that it comes with at
least the Oxford 911 bridge chipset. This is necessary to get the most
bandwidth out of the drive and results in more tracks in your session.
A drive with these specs in a good size (100GB or so) will run you about
$100, so there’s no reason not to spring for the second drive. 
If you use either the 002 or the 002 Rack as your interface, you’re better off
using an ATA/IDE drive as your audio drive, since a FireWire drive will com-
pete with the 002’s FireWire connection for bandwidth. If you want to use a
PowerBook or other Mac that doesn’t have room for a second internal ATA/
IDE drive, you may need to get either a PCI (for desktops) or Cardbus (for
laptops) FireWire adapter. Using an adapter will let you record and playback
more tracks and essentially make your sessions run smoother.
Dealing with other software on your system
There was a day not too long ago when installing any other software on the
computer that you intended to record audio into was asking for trouble. This
isn’t a problem so much anymore (see the Warning icon below though) but
you still need to be careful not to stress your system by putting too much
junk on your computer (games come to mind). 
As an experiment, I had Pro Tools running while I had both my e-mail and
Internet browser program open and downloading files, as well as Photoshop
and MS Word running (talk about multitasking!) — and Pro Tools still ran
fine. I wouldn’t try to record or mix seriously with all this stuff going, but I
was able to work without my system crashing.
With that said, if you’re really serious about having a bulletproof system, try
to keep any extra software (such as games, finance, publishing, graphics,
and so on) off your audio computer. At the very least keep all other applica-
tions closed while you work in Pro Tools.
Whatever you do, don’t install AOL on this computer. I don’t want to bash
AOL, but its software is not too successful at making friends with audio pro-
grams. Imagine it as the schoolyard bully. You don’t pick a fight with a bully;
you just walk away, or better yet, avoid it altogether. So put that free AOL
disc down and slowly back away! You’ll thank me later.
If you already have AOL installed in this computer, then either take your
chances or (and this is what I’d do) back up all your software and files,
reformat the drive and reinstall everything from scratch. Uninstalling AOL
doesn’t work; it still leaves some things on the computer that are impossible
to find and could still cause trouble.

Setting system settings
Before you install Pro Tools software check to make sure that you have the
latest version of OS X. (Also check Digidesign’s compatibility Web page to
make sure this version is supported.) Then follow these steps to prepare
your system for the software installation:
1. Log on to your computer using an administration account.
Your OS X documentation will spell out this procedure for you.
2. Choose Apple➪System Preferences from the main menu, as shown in
Figure 1-1.
3. Under the Hardware Options, click the Energy Saver icon. 
A new window opens.
4. Under the Sleep tab, slide the slider for Put The Computer To Sleep
When It Is Inactive For: option over to Never, as in Figure 1-2. 
This keeps your computer from shutting down if you record a long song
because you don’t touch any keys while recording.
5. Leave the Put the Hard Disk To Sleep When Possible option
unchecked. 
This keeps your computer from going to sleep during long sessions.
6. Go back to the main Systems Preferences page by pressing the Show
All button in the upper-left corner of the window.
7. Choose Software Update from the System options at the bottom of the
page.
Figure 1-1:

This keeps your system from dedicating resources to look for and down-
load software updates. 
9. Close the window by clicking the red button in the upper-left corner
of the window.

3. Enter your OS X Administration password and click OK. 
The Pro Tools installer opens.
4. Select the Startup hard drive as the destination drive. 
The installation path is set.
5. Click Install. 
Pro Tools is installed on your computer (this may take a few minutes so
sit back and contemplate the fun you’re going to have once it’s finished
installing itself). 
6. Restart your computer.
Wait to open the program until after you’ve attached your hardware. The
complete details for this procedure are located in Book 2, Chapter 2. 
Using Pro Tools on a PC
Getting set up with a PC is a little more complicated than it is with a Mac,
simply because there are a lot more hardware variables to deal with. But as
long as you keep the basic system requirements in mind, you can set your-
self up a very powerful system, often for less money than you’d shell out for
a comparable Mac-based system. In this section, I cover some basic things to
keep in mind when you’re either purchasing or configuring a PC system for
use with Pro Tools.
Understanding system requirements
Although the system requirements for PCs are similar to the basic ones for
Macs, you do have to deal with a ton more variables. Of these variables, cen-
tral processing units (CPUs), motherboards, and graphics cards are proba-
bly the most confusing to people starting out. These components — as well
as the more basic stuff such as hard drives and RAM — are covered in this
section so you can get up and running on a PC in no time.
Again, the best source for the latest hardware compatibility information can
be found online at the Digidesign Web site at 
(www.digidesign.com/compato/) 

Using Pro Tools on a PC
116
or on the Digidesign User’s Conference (DUC) Web page at 
duc.digidesign.com/
The DUC Web page has a section down the page dedicated to Pro Tools for
PCs. At the top of that forum, you’ll find a very useful thread called “The Best
System For Pro Tools Under $1,000.00,” which contains a wealth of informa-
tion about user-tested system configurations that are known to work well.
Central Processing Unit (CPU)
The CPU is a small chip that is responsible for processing all the data in your
computer. It’s essentially the computer’s brain. There are two major CPU
manufacturers in the PC world — Intel and AMD. Digidesign supports both,
and each can work fine as the core of your Pro Tools host computer. For Intel
systems, I recommend going with a Pentium 4, and for AMD systems, the
Athlon XP.
Avoid the lower-cost (and lower-performance) Intel Celeron and AMD Duron
processors.
Also, at this time, Pro Tools for Windows isn’t optimized for the new 64-bit
CPUs that are just starting to hit the market. Until that changes (and eventu-
ally it will), stick with the Athlon XP or Pentium 4. Regardless of which you
decide on, I suggest getting the fastest processor you can afford.
Since Pro Tools is a host-based system, it relies on the processing power of
your computer’s CPU instead of hardware-processing cards (as the more
elaborate Pro Tools HD systems do). The number of plug-ins and amount of
mix automation you can use in a session is directly related to how powerful
(read: fast) your system is — so don’t skimp on CPU speed.
Motherboard
The motherboard is the main circuit board in your computer and holds the
CPU, memory, and other peripheral cards. The motherboard you choose will
depend on whether you are running the Intel or AMD CPU (see previous sec-
tion). Each CPU type has its own motherboard requirements, and there are
many choices available for each, with new motherboards being released all
the time. I have had good results over the years with Asus brand mother-
boards, although other brands can also work well. 
When you select a motherboard for use with Pro Tools, your main concern is
that it (a) supports the CPU you plan on using and (b) has a compatible
chipset, as specified by Digidesign on the compatibility Web site at 
www.digidesign.com/compato/

Book II
Chapter 1

Your Computer

Be sure to check out the compatibility site before you buy a motherboard.
Graphics card
Pro Tools doesn’t make the same demands on your graphics card that
modern game software does. A simple 2X or 4X AGP graphics card will work
just fine. Make sure, however, that the graphics card you use is compatible
with your motherboard. In most cases, this isn’t an issue, but check it out
anyway as a hedge against Murphy’s Law.
For example, my latest motherboard (an Asus A7N8X Deluxe) wasn’t compat-
ible with my old Matrox G550 graphics card, but it works fine with my new
ATI Radeon 9000 card.
One final consideration for graphics cards: You may want to consider a dual-
head AGP graphics card. These work just like any other graphics card, but
support the use of dual monitors. Since Pro Tools uses two main display
screens, having two monitors and a dual-display-capable graphics card
allows you to see both screens without having to “toggle” between them.
Okay, it’s certainly not a requirement, but many people find that it’s a nice
convenience.
RAM
As far as RAM (Random Access Memory) goes, I suggest a minimum of 512
MB, and more if possible. The only important thing to remember when
buying RAM for your PC is that you get the proper type of RAM for your
motherboard.
Like I said in the Mac section, don’t buy cheap RAM. It can cause problems
with your system. High-quality RAM is not much more expensive than the
cheap stuff, so spend the extra few bucks and you’ll be thanking me when
your system doesn’t freeze on you.
Hard drives
Hard drives for a PC system are essentially the same as those for Macs. Check
out the hard-drive section for Macs earlier in this chapter for the lowdown on
buying hard drives for your system.
Opting on the operating system
For PC users, Windows XP is the way to go. It is by far the most stable operat-
ing system Microsoft has released to date. While it’s true that older versions
of Pro Tools (5.0 – 5.3.1) would work on Windows 98 Second Edition or
Windows ME, all versions from 5.3.2 onward require Windows XP. The Digi
001 will work any version (5.0 and newer), but if you use any of Digidesign’s

Using Pro Tools on a PC
118
newer hardware (002, Mbox, or 002 Rack), you have no choice but to upgrade
to Windows XP. Additionally, the 002 Rack needs Pro Tools 6.1 software, and
you can’t run 6.1 without Windows XP.
Both the Home and Professional versions of Windows XP will work. Which
one should you buy? They are basically the same. For use with Pro Tools,
the main difference is that Windows XP can run dual-CPU systems. (The cen-
tral processing unit is the main computer “brain,” so essentially it’s a mutant
Computer with Two Brains.) The Professional version lets you run dual CPUs;
the Home version doesn’t. As of this time, there is no real performance advan-
tage to running a dual CPU system on a Windows PC. That may change in the
future as Pro Tools evolves.
Unless you already own a dual-CPU-equipped computer — or plan to pur-
chase (or build) one in the not-too-distant future, save yourself a few bucks
and go with the Windows XP Home edition.
Preparing to install Pro Tools software
Before you can actually install your Pro Tools software, you need to get your
system configured for it. This section describes the procedures and helps
you make sure that your system will run trouble-free (at least as much as can
be expected).
Windows settings
While it’s true for the most part that you can run Pro Tools just fine on a
standard Windows XP configuration, a few system adjustments will free up
system resources, allowing more of your computer system’s power to be
freed up for use by Pro Tools. This is important since Pro Tools is a native
DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) — one that relies solely on the host com-
puter’s processing power with no additional DSP (Digital Signal Processing)
cards for support. And some of these adjustments — such as enabling DMA
for all your IDE hard drives — are crucial for running Pro Tools successfully.
The sections that follow lay out the basic system settings that I recommend.
Windows XP Classic mode
There are many ways to accomplish the same basic housekeeping and setup
tasks in Windows XP. Since I don’t know how your system is set up right now,
I lead you through the process from the start. The first thing you want to do
is set your system to Windows Classic mode. Here’s how:
1. Click Start and choose Settings➪Control Panel from the Start menu
that appears. 
The contents of the Control Panel folder appears on-screen.

Book II
Chapter 1
Configuring
Your Computer
Using Pro Tools on a PC
119
2. Double-click the Display icon.
3. Select the Themes tab, and under Themes, select Windows Classic. 
4. Click the Apply button. 
5. Select the Desktop tab, and under Background, select None.
6. Click OK. 
This procedure disables the active desktop in Windows, which frees up
some valuable system resources.
Choosing Control Panel settings
Windows XP is remarkably stable, but for those rare times when it (or a pro-
gram running under Windows) crashes, it generates an error report and asks
whether you want to send the report to Microsoft. This feature, called Error
Reporting, takes system resources to run — and since you’d rather have
those resources working hard to keep Pro Tools running smoothly, you need
to disable Error Reporting. Here’s the drill:
1. Click Start and choose Settings➪Control Panel from the Start menu
that appears.
2. Double-click the System icon.
3. Select the Advanced tab.
4. Click the Error Reporting button.
5. Click Disable Error Reporting.
6. Click OK.
7. Leave the Control Panel open. You have more settings to adjust.
Standby power should be set to Always On for your Pro Tools system. To do
this, follow these steps:
1. Open the Control Panel if you closed it already. (Click Start and
choose Settings➪Control Panel.) 
2. Double-click the Power Options icon. 
3. Under Power Schemes, select the Always On option. 
4. Click OK.
5. Leave the Control Panel open. You have more settings to adjust.

Using Pro Tools on a PC
120
You also want to make sure that your screen doesn’t go to sleep and crash
your session. These steps show you how to do this:
1. Open the Control Panel if you closed it already. (Click Start and
choose Settings➪Control Panel.)
2. Double-click the Display icon and then select the Screen Saver tab. 
3. Select None in the Screen Saver selection menu.
4. Click Apply. 
5. Select the Appearance tab. 
6. Click Effects. 
Make sure that none of the options listed in the window are selected
with a check mark. If any of them are, simply click those pesky check
marks so they disappear.
7. Click OK. 
8. Leave the Control Panel open; there’s still one more thing you have
to do.
Your System Sounds need to be disabled to prevent potential problems with
Pro Tools. To do this, follow these steps: 
1. Open the Control Panel if you closed it already. (Click Start and
choose Settings➪Control Panel.)
2. Double-click the Sounds And Audio Devices icon in the Control Panel. 
3. Select the Sounds tab.
4. Under Sound Scheme select No Sounds. 
5. Click OK.
6. Close the Control Panel.
Congratulations! You’ve just configured your system settings.
Enabling DMA
All IDE hard drives on your system MUST have DMA enabled before Pro
Tools can effectively write and read data to and from your hard drives. To
enable DMA, do the following:
1. Right-click the My Computer icon on the Windows desktop. 
2. From the context menu that appears, select Properties to access the
Properties window and then select the Hardware tab. 

Book II
Chapter 1
Configuring
Your Computer
Using Pro Tools on a PC
121
3. On the Hardware tab of the Properties window, click the Device
Manager button. 
4. In the Device Manager window, double click IDE ATA/ATAPI 
controllers.
The Device Manger tree expands to show the controllers associated with
your system.
5. From the listing, double click the Primary IDE controller and select
the Advanced Settings tab.
If it doesn’t already say DMA If Available under the Transfer Mode
option, change it so it does. If you have several disk drives on your
system, you have to do the same for Device 0 and Device 1.
6. Click OK and repeat the same steps for the Secondary IDE controller.
It’s in the Device Manager, directly below the Primary controller.
Disabling AutoPlay
AutoPlay is a feature of Windows XP that automatically runs certain pro-
grams or plays music on a CD when you insert it into your computer’s CD
drive. This is a handy feature in everyday life, but can cause problems with
the Pro Tools software. For the sake of Pro Tools, disable AutoPlay for all CD
drives on your system. Here’s the drill:
1. Double click the My Computer icon on the Windows desktop.
The My Computer window duly appears.
2. In the My Computer window, right-click the icon for your CD drive.
3. From the context menu that appears, select Properties to access the
Properties window and then select the AutoPlay tab.
4. Select Music Files in the Select Content Type menu. 
5. At the bottom of the dialog box, click the Prompt Me Each Time To
Choose an Action option.
6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 with the Pictures, Video Files, Mixed Content,
Music CD, and Blank CD options for the Select Content Type Menu.
7. Click OK.
8. Repeat steps 1 through 8 for each CD or DVD drive on your computer.
Disabling virus protection
Virus protection is an important thing to have on any computer that con-
nects to the Internet, but virus protection can also adversely affect Pro Tools

Using Pro Tools on a PC
122
performance. Ideally, your Pro Tools host computer would be dedicated to
just running Pro Tools. However, many of you will be using an “all-purpose”
computer that you will use for many tasks, such as surfing the Web for busi-
ness, pleasure, and/or for helping with your children’s homework. In that case,
you should turn off your virus protection whenever you are running Pro Tools.
Check with the documentation that came with your virus-protection software
for the best way to do this. (And don’t forget to re-enable virus protection
before you log on to the Internet again.)
I hate to repeat myself but I will: If you’re really serious about having a bullet-
proof system, try to keep any extra software (such as games, finance, pub-
lishing, graphics, and so on) off your audio computer. At the very least, keep
all other applications closed while you work in Pro Tools.
Once you’ve made all of these system adjustments listed above, you need to
reboot your computer.
Connecting your hardware 
Once you have your system fine-tuned (as in the previous section), you can
now connect your hardware. Shut down your computer and refer to Book 2,
Chapter 2 for the specifics on connecting your Digidesign hardware. Each
piece of hardware has its own installation procedure; I’ve covered each one,
step by step, in that chapter. Once you have the hardware connected, turn
on your computer. Then, after the Windows desktop appears, turn on the
power to your Digidesign hardware (if you’re using a product that doesn’t
have a power switch, you can ignore this step).
On Windows PCs, it’s important to wait to install the program until after
you’ve attached your hardware, and, if needed, powered it on. The complete
details for this procedure are located in Book 2, Chapter 2.
Installing the program
After you’ve complete the Windows system-setup adjustments listed in the
previous section, you can install Pro Tools software by following these steps:
1. Connect your Digidesign interface to your computer. 
If you have a 002 or 002 Rack this means connecting the FireWire cable,
the Mbox requires the USB connection, and the 001 requires plugging
in the PCI card into an open PCI slot and making the connection between
the PCI card and the breakout box (the rest of the 001 system). 
2. Start Windows. 
The Windows desktop appears.
3. Turn on your Digidesign interface if it has a power switch.

4. Insert the Pro Tools software CD in your computer’s CD drive.
5. Double-click the My Computer icon on the Windows desktop.
The My Computer window appears.
6. In the My Computer window, double-click the icon for your CD drive.
The contents of the CD are displayed in a new window.
7. Double-click the Pro Tools Installer folder.
8. Double-click Setup.
9. Once the Installer appears, click Next to continue.
10. Specify the default paths for installation — they’re fine and it’s less
hassle — and click Next.
11. Wait for the installation to complete.
12. Restart your computer.
Digidesign has included additional drivers that aren’t needed for use with
Pro Tools, but are included in case you’re using third-party programs and
want your Digidesign hardware to interface with them. Frankly, I don’t rec-
ommend installing these drivers unless you absolutely have to. Remember,
it’s best to keep a lean, mean DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) machine, and
that means staying away from any unnecessary drivers and programs. If you
have to install these drivers for use with a third-party audio program (such
as Sonar or Cubase), refer to their manuals and the Digidesign documenta-
tion that came with your hardware for instructions.
Keeping Bugs at Bay: Good Habits To Get Into
One thing is certain with computers: Hiccups will happen. Just when you
think everything is performing perfectly, something crashes your system.
Since these things are inevitable, I recommend that you work on developing
some good habits to keep these minor problems from becoming disasters. In
this section, I list a bunch of things that can help give you as stress-free an
experience recording on your computer as possible.
Back up your data often (and more than once)
There’s an old saying about computer data — If it doesn’t exist in at LEAST
two places, then it DOESN’T EXIST! Your hard drive can be considered one
such “location.” A lot of people also copy their data to a second hard drive
(either the system drive or a FireWire drive) — and removable media back-
ups are also commonly used. This would include CD-R or DVD +/-R discs.

Keeping Bugs at Bay: Good Habits To Get Into
124
Regardless of the method you choose, the important thing to remember is to
back up your data. Hard drives have become remarkably reliable, but as with
anything else, failures can and do happen. If your hard drive should fail (or if
you accidentally delete something that you shouldn’t have), you’ll be very
happy you made copies of all your Pro Tools sessions to another storage
device — and (if you didn’t make copies) very sad to see your hard work 
disappear forever right before your eyes.
On the PC, I prefer to back the data up to a FireWire drive and to either CD-Rs
or DVD-Rs. DVD burners are becoming a more attractive option, since they
can hold over six times as much data as a CD-R disc, and the prices on DVD
burners and the blank disks they use are dropping all the time. I recently
added a 4X DVD-/+RW drive to my system and it cost around $200, with
blank discs running a bit over a dollar each. Since large Pro Tools sessions
can easily exceed the storage capacity of a CD-R, the extra storage capacity
of DVD discs allows you to store the session on a single disc instead of span-
ning it across multiple discs — which makes backing up your data that much
easier.
The software you need for backing up your data to CD was probably
included with your CD/DVD burner (or came preinstalled on your system).
Any good burning software, such as Nero or CD Creator, will work just fine
for making CD-R backups of your work. The important thing to remember is
that if it’s important to you, make a backup copy of it. I recommend you get
into the habit of backing up your session data at the end of every Pro Tools
session. Trust me, you’ll thank me for this later. 
Back up your system drive
Installing your operating system, software applications, plug-ins, and so forth
can take a considerable amount of time. So I prefer to back up this informa-
tion as well as my audio and session data. On the PC, Norton Ghost 2002 is a
great way to do this. This program allows you to create a “ghost” image of
your hard drive and save it to either another hard drive (or to removable
media, such as CD-Rs). In the event of a hard drive crash or other problem,
you can restore your drive (or a new drive) to exactly the way you had it
before the crash occurred. The best part is that this takes a lot less time
than reinstalling everything from scratch does. I normally install Windows
XP, then all my software, and then back it up with Ghost. After that, I leave
the C (operating system) drive alone, and use my second drive exclusively
for Pro Tools sessions and audio data, leaving the system drive for only the
programs. Any time I add any new programs or plug-ins — or make any
other significant changes to my system drive — I create a new Ghost backup
before I install the new stuff. That way, if disaster does strike, my system can
bounce back and be up and running with very little delay.

125
A few minutes spent backing up your system drive and your Pro Tools ses-
sions now can save you hours of work reloading all of your programs later
and can also save you from losing that session you spent so many hours
perfecting. So get into the habit of backing up your data regularly.

I
n order to use Pro Tools software, you need to have one of Digidesign’s
hardware interfaces — the boxes that get the sound in and out of your
computer. Digidesign choices here include the Mbox, Digi 001, Digi 002, and
Digi 002 Rack. All these interfaces work with either Macintosh-or Windows-
based computers, and they all run using the same Pro Tools software.
Differences include the number of inputs and outputs each interface 
provides, the sample rates each one supports, and the different ways
they connect to your computer.
In this chapter, you get the lowdown on the Mbox, Digi 001, Digi 002, and
Digi 002 Rack. To help you choose the best interface for your needs, we tell
you how many inputs and outputs you get, note the sample rates, and dis-
cuss connection requirements for each of these units. Also, in the case of
the Digi 002, we get you up to speed on the numerous functions of the con-
trol surface — the faders and knobs that let you mix with your hands. In this
chapter, we also show you how to connect each interface so you can get
your system up and running.
Throughout this chapter, we describe a lot of connector types. Some of these
may be familiar to you, while others may seem a bit like rocket science. (What
is an S/PDIF, anyway, and will it blow up if I plug it in?) If you start getting a
little dizzy from all these new terms, check out Book 1, Chapter 3, where
we explain all types of analog and digital connectors in detail.
Despite the differences between the various Digidesign interfaces, there are
many things they share. These include:
✦Preamps: All the interfaces contain at least two preamps. Preamps boost
the signal from microphones so that you can record them directly into
Pro Tools. I discuss preamps in detail in Book 1, Chapter 1.

Mbox
128
✦Phantom Power: Phantom power is a small current (48 volts) that is
sent from your interface to your microphone (through the mic cable)
and is necessary for your condenser microphone to work. Phantom
power is only available on your preamp channels and can be switched
on and off.
✦Line-Level Inputs: Line-level inputs are analog connections that let you
plug your guitar, keyboard, or other instruments into your interface
without any gear between your instrument and the device. Getting your
preamp inputs in the interface to accept line-level signals is easy; just
push a button on the interface.
✦S/PDIF: The S/PDIF connector lets you plug in an external converter into
your interface, allowing you to bypass the analog-to-digital or digital-to-
analog conversion process. Some people prefer to do this if they have
separate converters that they prefer the sound of over the ones con-
tained in the interface. All the Digidesign interfaces contain S/PDIF
inputs and outputs.
✦ADAT Lightpipe: The ADAT lightpipe connectors let you have up to
eight channels of digital information coming and going through your
device. Like S/PDIF, this lets you bypass the conversion process in your
interface. ADAT lightpipe is useful if you have an external digital mixer
and you want to mix with that. All the Digidesign interfaces except for
the Mbox have ADAT lightpipe inputs and outputs. 
Mbox
The Mbox (pronounced “EMbox”) is Digidesign’s least expensive Pro Tools
hardware interface. (That’s it in Figure 2-1.) Perfect for people with limited
input and output needs (and maybe limited cash flow), such as solo artists
and singer/songwriters who only need to record one or two tracks at a time
(instead of, say, the Flatbush Philharmonic), and those who need something
small and portable.
The Mbox interfaces with the host computer and gets its power via a USB
interface — rather than from a separate power source — making it an ideal
solution for laptop users who want to edit music on the go. While it lacks the
high sample rate capabilities and MIDI input and outputs of the Digi 002/002
Rack, it’s still a very capable product and is a perfect solution for those who
are looking for ultimate portability or have to squeak by on a tight budget.

Chapter 2
Setting Up Your

Mbox
129
Following the ins and outs of the Mbox
The Mbox is actually the simplest of the Digidesign lineup. It includes a pair
of combination line/instrument input/microphone preamps (by Focusrite).
Phantom power is included. Better still, you can either fire up the built-in
microphone preamps to work with condenser microphones that need phan-
tom power, or switch ’em off to work with dynamic or ribbon mics. (For
more about phantom power and condenser mics, see Book 1, Chapter 5.)
Mbox works its magic via S/PDIF digital input and output jacks. These are
much the same as the stereo coaxial (coax or RCA) connectors that allow
you to record audio into your computer. Typically such a connection sends
the output from your CD player or keyboard over a balanced (TRS) or unbal-
anced (TS) quarter-inch cable to the line inputs (depending on what kind of
output jacks you have on your CD player or keyboard). If you want to use
microphones that require cables with three-pin XLR connectors, no problem:
Mbox offers XLR jacks in back.
Figure 2-1:
The Mbox is
a USB
interface
with two
inputs and
two outputs.

Mbox
130
The line and XLR inputs share the same jack — called a Neutrik combo jack.
These jacks, located on the back of the Mbox, can accept standard XLR
(microphone) cables, or balanced TRS or unbalanced TS quarter-inch cables
via the hole in the center of the jack. Pretty slick! You can hook up a bass or
guitar the same way as a line input without having to use a separate direct
box. (Book 1, Chapter 1 has more about direct boxes.)
No matter which input type you use — a microphone, say, or some kind of
instrument — make sure that the front panel Source switch is set for the
input type you’re using. Three LED lights next to the selector switch tell you
at a glance which type of input the Mbox is set up for; press the switch
repeatedly to scroll through the three possible types — Mic, Line, or
Instrument.
You’ll want to be able to hear what you’re doing, so you’ll probably want to
connect a pair of headphones to either stereo headphone jack (1/8-inch on
the front panel or 1/4-inch on the rear). If you want to go the speaker route,
you can connect powered monitor speakers to the quarter-inch line output
jacks on the back of the Mbox.
If you have a DAT player, CD player with a digital output, or other equipment
with digital S/PDIF coax connectors that you’d like to connect to the S/PDIF
inputs of your Mbox, use 75-Ohm coax digital audio cables. These cables
look a lot like the regular RCA cables you’d use to connect a cassette deck
to your home stereo, but don’t let looks deceive you. It’s important you
use the proper cables; make sure that the cables you end up using are really
75-Ohm coax digital audio cables. (Book 1, Chapter 2 has more on cables and
connectors.)
Hooking up the Mbox
Hooking up the Mbox is pretty simple. Just connect a few cords and you’re
ready to go. This section covers these connections.
Connecting to the computer
Did I say simple? Check this out:
1. Shut down your computer.
2. Attach the included USB cable to your Mbox USB jack.
3. Plug in the other end of the cable to the USB connector on your
computer. 
Don’t use a USB hub; connect directly into your computer. This keeps
your signal from being interrupted by having too much data trying to get
through one USB line. 
4. Turn your computer back on and install your software.

Book II
Chapter 2
Setting Up Your

Mbox
131
Connecting your gear
In case you haven’t noticed, The Mbox has no power plug or switch. This is
because it’s powered by your computer through the USB cable. When your
Mbox is plugged into the computer and your computer is turned on, the
Mbox is ready to go. You can double-check this by seeing if the USB light is
on (the one located on the right side of the front panel above the Mix knob). 
The Mbox has two analog inputs that can handle any of your gear. This 
connector takes XLR (microphone), TRS (balanced cords — the ones with
three wires in them that cancel out any built up noise), and TS (your run-
of-the-mill instrument cables). These inputs are controlled by the top two
knobs on the front of the Mbox, labeled Source 1 and Source 2. These knobs
let you adjust the level of the signal. Next to each of these knobs is a button
that lets you select the type of device that you’re running through the inputs.
You have three options:
✦Mic: This option is for your microphones. If you have a mic connected to
the Mbox with a standard XRL mic cable, this is the option to choose.
✦Line: This option is for line-level sources. This includes synthesizers,
tape decks, and other line-level sources.
✦Inst: This option is for instrument connections. This is the one you
choose when you want to plug your guitar or bass directly into the
Mbox — without a direct box in between. (Book 1, Chapter 1 has more
on direct boxes.)
The front panel also has a Mix knob. This knob lets you monitor your inputs
while you record and also lets you hear the playback of any previously
recorded tracks. Adjusting this knob lets you mix the balance between your
input and the already-recorded stuff in your headphones. This makes it easy
to overdub without hearing a delay from the time it takes your instrument’s
signal to enter and exit the computer. Because the Mbox uses a USB connec-
tion and USB transfer rates are pretty slow (for audio, anyway), the delay is
significant. Using the Mix function in the Mbox allows you to have “zero
latency monitoring.” In other words, there’s no delay in your headphones
when you overdub tracks. 
Of course, using zero latency monitoring causes other problems. That is,
your overdubbed tracks are exactly 147 samples behind (the amount of time
it takes the signal to enter the computer) your previously recorded tracks. If
you use the Mix knob when you overdub and you played in time with the
tracks already recorded in Pro Tools, you need to move them earlier in the
session (song) to line them up. This isn’t a big deal and I give you step-by-
step instructions on how to do this in Book 3, Chapter 4.
You can connect your headphones to either the 1/8-inch jack on the front 
or the 1/4-inch jack on the back, or both if you have two people wanting to

Digi 001
132
listen through phones. The overall volume of your headphones is controlled
by the bottom knob on the Mbox labeled (appropriately enough) Headphones. 
On the back of the Mbox there are two Line outputs where you connect your
speakers and two channel inserts. These channel inserts let you connect a
compressor between the analog input (including the preamps) and the A/D
converter. To do this you need a “Y” cord. (I describe inserting using a “Y”
cord in Book 1, Chapter 3.)
The Mbox has two digital S/PDIF jacks in the back where you plug in your
digital gear, such as external converters or a CD player equipped with S/PDIF
outputs. If you have S/PDIF connections made in the Mbox, the S/PDIF light —
located up and to the left of the Mix knob — lights up. 
Digi 001
The Digi 001, as shown in Figure 2-2, is the product that brought Pro Tools
capabilities to the masses. It is similar to the newer Digi 002 Rack unit (listed
later in this chapter) in terms of its basic input and output capabilities, except
that it uses a PCI card for interfacing to your computer, rather than a FireWire
connection. The PCI card attaches via a special cable (included with the Digi
001 package) to a breakout box — the box that contains all the digital and
analog inputs and outputs, preamps, and the converters. This makes it some-
what more difficult to install; you have to open your computer case to insert
the PCI card, and then attach the cable to the card and the breakout box.
The 001 is not capable of the same high sample-rate operation you’ll find in
the newer Digi 002 and Digi 002 Rack, which are capable of 88.2/96 KHz.
Speed isn’t much of a issue in this case, though, since many of today’s top
albums are still being recorded at 24 bit/44.1 KHz. But as time marches on,
new technology gets better results. So while the 001 is still a capable prod-
uct, it’s slowly being phased out in favor of the newer 002 line.
The 001 can’t be used with the new Mac G5s because the PCI slot in the
newer computers is a different configuration. Use your 001 with either a PC
or a Mac G4.

Discovering the ins and outs of the Digi 001
The Digi 001 has all the inputs and outputs you need for recording a whole
band at once:
✦8 analog inputs: Two of these inputs also have microphone preamps
and switchable phantom power, enabling you to plug a microphone
directly into the 001.
✦8 analog outputs: You can use these to send tracks out of your com-
puter in a variety of ways — helpful if you have an analog mixer you
want to use.
✦8 channels of ADAT lightpipe digital inputs and outputs: The lightpipe
connection sends digital info through a glass (or plastic) wire. This con-
nector is useful for sending digital signals into and out from other com-
ponents (a digital mixer, for example) and can send up to eight channels
at a time.
✦2 channels of S/PDIF digital I/O: These inputs and outputs are com-
monly used for CD players and external converters.
✦1 MIDI in and MIDI out jack: You’d use these for connecting a MIDI 
keyboard or sound module (MIDI sound source) so you can record and
playback your MIDI performances. 
✦1 stereo quarter-inch headphone-output jack: Plug in a pair of head-
phones so you can hear what’s coming and going from the unit. The jack
comes with a dedicated volume control mounted on the front panel.
Hooking up the Digi 001
Hooking up the Digi 001 is easy. All you have to do is make the proper con-
nections on your computer, install the software, and plug in your gear. This
section covers these details.
Connecting to your computer
For some people, opening up a computer to connect the PCI card is nerve-
wracking. Follow these instructions and you can cut the problem down to
size:
1. Shut down your computer and unplug it from the wall outlet.
You’re going to be messing around inside the computer case and you
don’t want any power connected to it.
2. Open the case.
This usually requires removing a couple of screws on the rear of the
case to allow removal of the side panel on the left.

Digi 001
134
3. Touch the metal frame of your computer.
Doing so discharges any static electricity that may have built up.
4. Remove the Digi 001 PCI card from its static-free bag. 
Grip it from the edges (like holding a CD of your favorite music) and be
careful not to drop it.
5. Locate an open PCI slot (consult your computer’s manual if you don’t
know where this is) and gently push the Digi 001’s card into the slot —
it will only go in one way.
Be careful not to bend the card or use excessive force, but make certain
you have it fully seated into the PCI slot. If you’re unsure where the PCI
slots are or how the PCI card fits, consult both your computer’s manual
and the Getting Started guide that comes with the Digi 001.
Take your time and don’t rush this step. I’ve seen more than one Digi 001
system that had intermittent problems because of an improperly
installed card.
6. Screw the screws for the PCI card in to fully seat the card.
7. Close your computer case.
Next you need to connect the PCI card to the main Digi 001 unit, using the
included cable. This cable attaches to the long connector on the back of
the PCI card (which you can now find at the back of your computer) and
the other end connects to the connector labeled “Computer” on the back
of the Digi 001. Make sure you have the cables firmly connected. Now just
boot up your computer and install your Pro Tools software!
Connecting your gear
You’ve probably noticed that the Digi 001 unit has no power plug or switch,
although there is a Power On LED indicator on the front panel. The 001 gets
its power from your computer over the multipin cable. If your computer is
on, then so is the 001.
Mic- and line-level I/O connections for the Digi 001 are handled in much the
same way as for the Mbox, but the Digi 001 has a few tricks hidden up its
sleeve. As with the Mbox, inputs 1 and 2 (mounted on the front panel of the
breakout box) are on Neutrik combo XLR/quarter-inch connectors. The rear
panel has six more line inputs on quarter-inch TRS jacks. Inputs 3 and 4 can
be used normally (as inputs for Pro Tools) or can be routed directly out the
MON Out L/R jacks (MON being short for monitor) by pressing the Monitor
Mode switch on the front panel of the Digi 001.
The output section has eight line-level output jacks, as well as an “extra”
set of outputs labeled MON Out L and MON Out R. These normally have the
same signal coming out of them as you would get from Outputs 1 and 2, but

Book II
Chapter 2
Setting Up Your
Hardware
Digi 002 Rack
135
with a couple of twists. We already discussed how pressing the front panel
Monitor Mode switch directly routes the signal from inputs 3 and 4 directly
to these outputs. In addition, however, you can control the volume level of
the signal coming out of the MON Out L/R jacks with the Gain knob. This
knob, mounted on the front panel, is right between the Monitor Mode switch
and the Power LED indicator, just to the left of the Headphone Volume knob.
Digital I/O is also available on the Digi 001 with the S/PDIF coax and ADAT
lightpipe connectors. The S/PDIF connectors are located on the back of the
breakout box, while the lightpipe connectors are located on the PCI card.
(Book 1, Chapter 3 explains these digital connectors in detail.)
The two MIDI ports on the back of the Digi 001 can be connected with stan-
dard 5-pin MIDI cables. You should connect the MIDI Out of your MIDI key-
board to the MIDI In jack on the 001, and the MIDI Out jack back into the
MIDI In jack on your keyboard or other MIDI device.
The Digi 001 also includes a jack for an optional punch in/out foot pedal.
These were very popular back in the days of the four-track cassette mini-stu-
dios; a musician could use a footswitch to “punch” in or out of Record mode,
leaving both hands free to play an instrument. You can use a footswitch with
the Digi 001 to do the same thing, but most people use other methods these
days. You get a look at some possible ways to toggle Record mode on and off
when we start discussing using the Pro Tools software later in this book, but
for those who are more comfortable with the “old school” method, the jack
is there.
After connecting all the inputs and outputs on the Digi 001 to their proper
components, you may wonder about the “mystery” connector on the back of
the Digi 001 labeled “Serial.” It’s not mentioned in the Digidesign Getting
Started guide that comes with the Digi 001.
What is it? What does it do? Why is it there? Well, there’s been a ton of spec-
ulation about that little connector over the past couple of years. I’ll let you
in on a little secret: It doesn’t do anything. It isn’t even connected inside the
unit. (Don’t open yours up to look though — you will void your warranty.)
Why is it there? No one really knows for sure.
Digi 002 Rack
The Digi 002 Rack, shown in Figure 2-3, is similar to the older Digi 001 in
terms of its basic input and output capabilities, except it uses a FireWire
cable to connect to your computer instead of a PCI card. This makes
installing it considerably easier, since (assuming your computer already
has a suitable FireWire interface installed), it doesn’t require opening your
computer case to install anything.

Digi 002 Rack
136
In addition, the Digi 002 Rack is capable of high sample-rate operation at up
to 24 bit/96 KHz. The difference in sample rates offers a subtle improvement
in sound quality, along with the more-noticeable sonic improvements that
result from the upgrades Digidesign made to the analog-to-digital and digital-
to-analog converters and the microphone preamps.
While Digi 001 systems are available on the used market at very attractive
prices, I would suggest getting a 002 or 002 Rack instead if your budget can
handle it. It’s definitely a better-sounding interface and the new features are
well worth the added cost.
Discovering the ins and outs of the Digi 002 Rack
The Digi 002 Rack and Digi 002 feature nearly the same inputs and outputs as
the Digi 001, with a couple of differences. Like the Digi 001, they have eight
analog inputs, but four of those inputs feature microphone preamps, instead
of just the two found on the Digi 001. The Digi 002 Rack and the Digi 002
retain eight channels of ADAT lightpipe, two channels of S/PDIF digital I/O,
and a single MIDI In jack, but they also give you two MIDI Out jacks instead
of just one. This can be handy if you have more than one MIDI keyboard or
sound module you want to connect to Pro Tools, but not so many that you
have to add another MIDI interface to your system. The Headphone jack and
its volume control are also included, as well as the main Monitor Out volume
control. The Digi 002 Rack and the Digi 002 also include a pair of separate,
switchable Aux (auxiliary) inputs and Alt Main Analog outputs; you can use
these to connect a CD player or other line-level source to your system.
Hooking up the 002 Rack
Hooking up the Digi 002 Rack is as easy as plugging in a few cords — some
between your computer and the 002 and others between your instruments
and the 002. This section covers these connections.

Connecting to the computer
Compared to connecting the Digi 001, hooking up the Digi 002 R to your com-
puter is child’s play:
1. Shut down your computer.
2. Attach the included IEEE 1394 (FireWire) cable to one of the 1394 con-
nectors on the back of the 002 Rack.
3. Plug in the other end of the cable to the FireWire connector on your
computer. 
4. Connect the power cable to the Digi 002 Rack and plug it into the wall
power socket.
5. Turn your computer back on and install your software.
As with the Mbox, you should avoid using any “hubs” and instead connect
the Digi 002 Rack directly to a FireWire port on your computer.
I suggest that you boot your computer first, and then power up the 002 Rack
after the boot finishes up. You’re not going to break anything if you power up
the 002 Rack first and boot later, but things tend to function better if you fol-
low the procedure given here.
Connecting your gear
Although connecting audio and MIDI gear is much the same process for the
Digi 002 as for the Digi 001, there are a few differences. First, there’s no PCI
card for the 002 Rack; the ADAT lightpipe connectors are on the back of the
rack unit, where they’re labeled Optical. 
Why Optical instead of ADAT? Well, these use light instead of magnetic
impulses. In addition to functioning as ADAT lightpipe connectors, these can
also be set for use as optical S/PDIF connectors.
The ADAT lightpipe interface only functions at the 44.1/48 KHz sample rates,
while the optical S/PDIF can be used at any sample rate, including the higher
rates of 88.2/96 KHz. Either the coax (RCA) S/PDIF connectors or the optical
connectors can be used, and even have cables connected to them at the same
time, but only one or the other can be active at once. If you are working with
a 44.1/48 KHz sample rate session, it is possible to use the analog inputs, 8
channels of ADAT lightpipe and the coax S/PDIF all at the same time, giving
you a maximum of 18 possible inputs and outputs at once. At the higher
sample rates of 88.2/96 KHz, you have a maximum of ten inputs and outputs —
eight analog and two of either optical or coax S/PDIF digital.
Like the Digi 001, the 002 Rack has a pair of monitor outputs, perfect for
connecting to your powered monitor speakers. You can adjust the playback
volume with the Monitor Level control on the front of the Digi 002 Rack. The

Digi 002
138
002 Rack also includes a Mute switch, which cuts off all sound from these
outputs, and a Mono switch that combines stereo output into a monaural
signal (handy for checking the mono compatibility of your mixes).
Two more pairs of jacks are also new to the Digi 002 Rack:
✦Alt Source Input: These jacks can be routed to inputs 7 and 8 of the Digi
002 (instead of whatever is plugged into the normal line 7 and 8 inputs)
or sent directly to the Monitor Outputs. This is useful if you want to
listen to a tape deck or CD player without firing up Pro Tools software or
your computer.
✦Alt Main Output: These jacks duplicate the signal coming out of the
Main Outputs 1 and 2.These jacks are handy if you have two sets of mon-
itors and you want to hook them both up to your system.
The Digi 002 Rack also includes a jack for an optional footswitch for hands-
free punching in and out of recording. It’s lacking the “mystery serial connec-
tor” from the 001, but that’s no great loss since that connector didn’t do
anything anyway!
Digi 002 
The Digi 002 (shown in Figure 2-4) is a groundbreaking product for two reasons:
✦It’s the first Pro Tools hardware interface that can use the new high
sample rates of 88.2/96 KHz.
✦It has a full-featured control surface built in — an external device that
moves the software controls in Pro Tools. This allows you to perform
many tasks using dedicated hardware controls instead of having to use
the computer mouse to adjust software controls. Many people find dedi-
cated hardware switching a far more familiar and intuitive way of working.
While it’s true you can adjust things like channel faders (used to control
volume levels for individual tracks) just fine with a mouse, it’s often easier
to grab a physical fader and move that instead. Also, unlike an on-screen
control panel, a hardware control surface gives you enough things to grab
that you can actually adjust several different things at once — perfect
when you want to fade out one instrument while simultaneously fading in
a second part. As with the 002 Rack, the microphone preamps and con-
verters are significantly improved over those found on the Digi 001, result-
ing in even better sound quality. And since the 002 Rack uses a FireWire
interface to connect to your computer (it’s the first Pro Tools hardware
interface to use this method), installation is considerably easier.

Déjà vu-ing the ins and outs of the Digi 002
The ins and outs of the Digi 002 are identical to those of the Digi 002 Rack
unit described in the previous section. If you thought something looked
familiar here, you’re right.
Examining control surface features
The control surface is the only real difference between the Digi 002 and Digi
002 Rack, but it’s a big difference. As with the Rack version, you have controls
for four mic preamps, as well as the headphone and monitoring controls. While
the control surface doesn’t completely eliminate the need for a keyboard and
mouse, many functions that would require them when using a Digi 002 Rack
can be controlled directly from the control surface of the Digi 002, which has
six main sections (described next).

Digi 002

Fader section
The Fader section takes up most of the Digi 002’s top panel. It includes
✦8 motorized, touch-sensitive, 100mm faders: These faders control
volume levels of individual tracks, among a host of other functions.
These faders also move to follow the changes of the faders on-screen.
This feature is helpful when performing complex mixes with automation.
(Book 6, Chapter 6 has more on automating mixes.)
✦Mute, Solo, and SEL (select) buttons: These buttons control the Mute,
Solo, and Selection functions in the software.
✦Rotary Encoders: Encoders are used for panning the sound from one
channel to another, and for other functions such as adjusting reverb 
settings or other plug-in parameters.
✦Encoder Meter LED Rings: These rings are used for showing the 
position of your encoder knobs, track levels, and so forth.
✦Channel Scribble Strips: This is where abbreviated names of the corre-
sponding Pro Tools tracks and other information such as fader values
and plug-in parameters are displayed. Like many other areas of the Digi
002, these scribble-strip alphanumeric displays are multifunctional.
They display a variety of different data besides just track names,
depending on how other switches on the 002 are set.
Console/Channel View section
The Console/Channel View section is the collection of buttons just to the left
of (and directly above) the Scribble Strips. These buttons, when used along
with the Scribble Strips, SEL buttons, Rotary Encoders, and Encoder Meters
(and even the eight main faders), offer a variety of capabilities from viewing
and adjusting the Aux Send levels to changing the parameters for panning,
channel inserts, and plug-ins. 
Views is the Digidesign term for what’s displayed on the Digi 002 control 
surface and the 002 offers two views: Console and Channel. 
✦Console View: What you see on-screen is a virtual console; you can
adjust panning, sends, and inserts for all channels on the control 
surface. 
✦Channel View: All of the Rotary Encoder controls and Scribble Strips 
are used to display and manipulate controls of various types — plug-in
parameters, inserts, or sends — for a single track. If, for example, you
want to see all the values for a particular plug-in (or all the send levels
for a particular track) at once, Channel View is the way to get a look at it. 
The switches directly above the Scribble Strips are used to select which type
of data is displayed; you can navigate through various plug-in pages, bypass
a plug-in, or exit Channel View and return to Console View.

Global Fader controls
Located just to the right of the channel faders, the Global Fader controls
affect how all of the faders will operate as well as their assignments. The 
following list spells out what each Global Fader control does:
✦Record Enable: The Record Enable switch does just what its name 
suggests — it enables the recording capability for tracks when you
press. Pressing the Channel Select switch immediately after that is
how you specify the track(s) you want to, uh, record-enable.
✦Fader Flip: The Fader Flip switch functions in a variety of different ways,
depending on which View mode you’ve chosen at the moment. Normally,
when you press this button, it flips the main Channel Faders and the
Rotary Encoders. Then you can use the Channel Faders to control pan-
ning and other functions normally handled by the Rotary Encoder con-
trols. Hey, sometimes that’s just more intuitive.
The Send Flip mode, which operates when you’re in Console View, allows
you to adjust send levels with the Channel Faders instead of the Rotary
Encoders, and the Plug-in Flip mode, which functions when you are in
Channel View and have a plug-in open, allows you to use the Channel
Faders to control the parameters of software plug-ins such as compres-
sors and equalizers.
✦Master Fader: The Master Fader switch gives you the ability to move all
master faders in your Pro Tools session to the far right hand side of the
control surface. 
Transport and Navigation controls
Located just to the right of the faders is the Transport and Navigation section,
offering dedicated controls for transport functions — record, play, stop, and
so on. These duplicate the on-screen transport controls found in the Pro
Tools software.
A large, circular collection of four switches holds the Navigation and Zoom
keys. Used along with the three keys immediately above them (labeled Bank,
Nudge, and Zoom), these are used to zoom in and out of waveform displays,
select banks of faders in groups of eight, or nudge the faders to the left or
right, one track at a time. This allows you to control all the on-screen faders
with just the eight hardware faders on the 002. Magic? Maybe not, but it’s
close enough for rock’n’roll.
There are also buttons for selecting Loop Playback and Loop Record, to
enable or disable Quick Punch, and to switch between the Edit, Mix, and
Plug-in windows in the Pro Tools software. 
The Function/Utility switches on the far right of the 002 are primarily used
for when you use the Digi 002 as a standalone mixer without a computer.

Digi 002
142
You’d use these switches to handle such tasks as entering Utility mode,
naming channels, and taking fader and control “snapshots” (as well as saving
and recalling them) so you have a clear record of exactly what you did in a
particular session. The F4 and F5 keys are surprisingly useful for running the
Pro Tools software — read on to find out how.
F4 temporarily disables that spooky movement of the motorized hardware
faders, without affecting the actual automation within the Pro Tools soft-
ware. This feature can be handy when you’re recording yourself with a
microphone in the same room as the 002 and you don’t want your micro-
phone to pick up the sound of the faders moving around. When you’re 
done, just press F4 a second time and fader operation returns to normal.
The F5 switch can call up plug-ins you’ve inserted on various tracks and
allows you to quickly change to various data-display modes for the Scribble
Strips.
Status Indicators and Display Controls
Directly above the Transport and Navigation controls is the Status Indicators
and Display Controls area of the Digi 002. 
Here you’ll find a multi-LED displays that indicate the following:
✦Sample rate for the current session.
✦Successful communication with your computer via the FireWire interface.
✦Whether or not MIDI data is being received at the MIDI In port or being
transmitted out of either MIDI Out port. 
Two additional Scribble Strips are also located here (called the Display
Scribble Strips). These displays have two modes — these can be toggled by
pressing the Display Mode switch: 
✦Status mode: This displays the current status of the Channel Scribble
Strips, letting you know exactly what sort of data they are displaying,
such as pan, sends, EQ, and so on. 
✦Counter Mode: This displays the current value of the main location indi-
cator in the Pro Tools software, letting you know exactly what position
you’re currently at within your song. This can be displayed as either
bars and beats, minutes and seconds or in samples, depending on which
of the three is selected as the main time scale in the Pro Tools software.
The Encoder/Meter Mode switch allows you to change the type of data dis-
played by the Encoder Meter LED rings that surround each Rotary Encoder
control. As you toggle this switch, the meters display either levels or pan-
ning positions. This capability is available for mono or stereo channels and

Book II

sends (the signal going to effects); the three Encoder / Meter Mode LED indi-
cators show you the current status. 
Switches for Enter, Undo, and entering Standalone Mode are also located in
this section. 
Keyboard Modifier switches
As you start using Pro Tools, you’re likely to suspect right away that many
tasks are performed by pressing a combination of two or more keys on your
keyboard simultaneously. These keyboard shortcuts can save a lot of time
compared to fishing around in the program menu for the action you want
to perform. The Keyboard Modifier switches duplicate the most-often-used
computer keys used for these commands (such as Shift, Option, and
Control). 
Hooking up the 002
Connecting the Digi 002 is done in the exact same way as the Digi 002 Rack
as described in the previous section. Hook up the 1394 FireWire cable to the
back of the Digi 002 and the other end to your computer’s 1394 FireWire port,
plug in the power cable, and you’re all set to install your Pro Tools software. 
It’s always best to follow this standard procedure: Turn on your computer
first, and then power up the 002 after your computer finishes booting. You’re
not going to break anything if you turn the 002 on first, but the software tends
to function with improved stability this way.

P
ro Tools software is one of the more-simple and easy-to-get-started-on
audio programs out there, but like any software there are some basic
conventions that you need to know in order to work as efficiently as possi-
ble. This chapter covers the basics so you can better understand your soft-
ware and get your system configured properly. This chapter also shows you
how to open, set up, and navigate sessions as well as how to manage file
formats and file types.
Keeping Software Straight
Pro Tools comes in several versions: TDM and LE, for example, Mac and PC,
versions 6 and earlier. Although there are only minor differences between
them, knowing such differences will help you better understand your own
system. Read on to find out the details. 
Looking at LE and TDM versions
Digidesign, the maker of Pro Tools software, offers two basic types of sys-
tems: LE and TDM. Although this book focuses on Pro Tools LE, you may
end up encountering the TDM version if you take your files to a commercial
studio that uses a TDM system. In this section, I offer an overview of both
types of systems. 
Pro Tools LE
Pro Tools LE is a host-based system — the Digidesign hardware (the 002, for
example) acts as an interface between the analog-and-digital world and the
software. Pro Tools software relies on the processing power of your com-
puter’s CPU to work — all the recording, playback, mixing, editing, and

Keeping Software Straight
146
other processing you do is dependent on the power of your computer. So,
the more powerful your computer, the more you’ll be able to do with your
Pro Tools LE system. Pro Tools LE has a limited number of tracks that you
have active (playing or recording at once). For versions 5.3.2 and newer the
limit is 32 and for versions 5.3.1 and lower the limit is 24 tracks.
Pro Tools TDM
Pro Tools TDM systems are processor-based — such systems provide special
computer chips that go into the computer to handle all the processing needs
of the software. This takes the load off the computer and guarantees certain
levels of performance. Pro Tools TDM has been the professional standard
because Digidesign hardware (with its own built-in processors) can offer a
stable, reliable, and predictable level of performance, and putting the same
processors in your computer can give you the same performance. Your track
limits are much higher with the TDM system compared to the LE version —
up to 128 audio tracks — and these track counts are guaranteed by the
Digidesign DSP (Digital Signal Processing) chips. The downside is that TDM
systems are much more expensive than the LE version.
As a way of offsetting the higher cost, Digidesign has offered a few things to
TDM users that LE users don’t have. These include more and better plug-ins
and a few extra editing and mixing options. The good news is that any
recordings you do in your LE system can be opened in a TDM system (at a
commercial studio, for instance) to mix or otherwise process your tracks.
This is handy if you want to record at home and then take it to a pro to mix.
Distinguishing between software versions
There’s one thing you can count on in the computer world: New software
versions are always being developed and improved upon. There’s not a lot
you need to know about the different software versions, except that prior to
version 5.3, Pro Tools LE was limited to 24 tracks. Newer versions, up to the
current 6.1, can go up to 32 tracks.
Chances are you use version 6. If, for some reason, you decide to open a ses-
sion and work on it in a version before 5.3 — and you have 32 tracks of mate-
rial in your session — you lose any tracks above 24 if you try to save the
session in that earlier version.
Differences between Macs and PCs
Aside from the obvious hardware and operating-system differences between
Apple- and Windows-based computers, Mac and PC versions of the Pro Tools
software are nearly identical. The only significant difference you’ll find
between the two is in the keyboard shortcuts you use to perform certain
tasks. Throughout the book I give both versions of the shortcuts.

Getting Set Up
Before you can do any work in Pro Tools, you have to set up both your hard-
ware and your Playback Engine settings. This section walks you through how
to do this.
Setting hardware settings
One of the first things you need to do before you start using Pro Tools in
earnest is to configure your hardware settings within the software program.
This is done using the Hardware Setup window, shown in Figure 3-1. (To get
there, choose Setups➪Hardware Setup from the main menu.) Within this
window you can check out your peripherals as well as set the clock source,
bit rate, and digital input. I give you a rundown of these options in the fol-
lowing sections.
Peripherals
Located in the upper-left portion of the window, the Peripherals pane shows
the hardware you have hooked up to your computer. In the case of Figure
3-1, it’s the Digi 002. If you have a Digi 001 or Mbox, you’ll see either one of
those listed in this pane.
Clock Source
This drop-down menu allows you to choose your source for the digital master
clock. This makes sure that if you have more than one device (a separate A/D
converter connected to your Digidesign interface, for example), all devices are
synchronized. If you just use the Digidesign interface, simply choose Internal
in this menu, but if you have other digital devices, such as a digital mixer or
external converter, choose your clock source based on the device that has the
best clock. In this case, you can choose from the following options:
Figure 3-1:
The
Hardware
Setup 
menu is
where you
configure
your
hardware
device.

Getting Set Up
148
✦Internal: Uses the digital clock inside the Digidesign interface.
✦ADAT: Synchronizes from a signal sent into the ADAT input of your 
interface.
✦S/PDIF: Synchronizes to a signal sent via the coaxial S/PDIF input.
✦Optical (S/PDIF): Synchronizes to a S/PDIF signal coming in the
ADAT optical input. You can only choose this last one if you have
the lower option checked in the Digital Input check box. (See the
following section.)
For more on ADAT, S/PDIF and Optical connections, check out Book 1,
Chapter 2.
Before you can use one of the digital connections as a clock source, you
have to connect the device to your Digidesign hardware — and then you
adjust the setting in the Hardware Setup menu. Otherwise the device won’t
show up in the window.
If you have more than one digital device connected (such as a digital mixer
connected to your Digidesign interface), do some experimenting by record-
ing with different clock sources; compare the chosen sources to see which
one gives you the best sound. (Digital clocks vary in quality.) Also, if you
have more than three digital devices connected to your system, consider
using a specialized master clock and distribute this clock source to all your
devices. This will likely give you a better sound because it makes sure that
all your devices are following the same clock timing.
Digital Input
This check box lets you choose how the digital inputs on your Digidesign
hardware function. For example, with the Digi 002 you can use the Optical
jacks (located on the back of the device — see Book 2, Chapter 2 for more)
to send and receive either ADAT or S/PDIF signals. Your two options in this
section of the window are
✦RCA: Selecting this option means your RCA jacks send and receive
S/PDIF signals while the Optical jacks send and receive ADAT signals.
✦Optical: Selecting this option means your RCA jacks are disabled (you
can no longer send and receive ADAT signals) and the S/PDIF signals are
sent through the optical jacks instead.
Sample Rate
The Sample Rate drop-down menu allows you to choose the sample rate
in which to work. Depending on your hardware, you can choose 44.1kHz,
48kHz, 88.2kHz, or 96kHz. Check out the Book 2, Chapter 2 to see which
sample rates are supported by your Digidesign device and, while you’re at
it, check out Book 1, Chapter 1 for the nitty-gritty of sample rates.

Book II
Chapter 3
Examining 
Software Basics
Getting Set Up
149
The Sample Rate drop-down menu is only editable when you don’t have a
session open. If you have a session open, this box will show the sample rate
chosen when this session was created but won’t allow you to make any
changes. To choose a different sample rate, close the session you have open
and then choose Setups➪Hardware Setup from the main menu, make your
choice, and then click OK. Then open a new session. This new session will
be in the sample rate you just chose.
Playing with the Playback Engine settings
The Playback Engine window is where you can tweak various options —
hardware-buffer size, CPU-usage limit, and playback-buffer size, for example —
so your system runs at top efficiency. Getting there — where “there” looks a
lot like Figure 3-2 — involves choosing Setups➪Playback Engine from the main
menu. As for what all these options actually mean, the following sections take
care of that.
H/W Buffer size
H/W here stands for “Hardware,” and the hardware-buffer size controls the
amount of memory used to handle the processing of audio (as well as plug-
ins like reverb). The lower this setting, the lower the latency (time it takes to
get sound into and back out of your system) that you hear when you record.
I suggest that you keep this setting as low as possible while recording (espe-
cially when you do overdubs). How low you can go depends on how many
tracks you record at once — and whether you want to use plug-ins like
reverb while recording. Using lots of tracks and lots of plug-ins requires lots
of memory, which may force you (rats!) to bump up the hardware-buffer size.
Higher buffer sizes mean higher latencies, which can make overdubbing
tracks more difficult, so I reserve high buffer sizes until after I’m done
recording all my tracks.
Figure 3-2:
The
Playback
engine

lets you

system’s
perfor-
mance.

Getting Set Up
150
When you’re ready to mix, go ahead and raise the buffer size. This will put
less stress on your system and allow you to have more plug-ins going at a
time before you run into performance problems.
CPU Usage Limit
This menu allows you to set the amount of the computer’s processing power
(as a percentage) that is used to run the program. The default is 65%, but you
can go much higher if you only have Pro Tools open when you work. The more
programs you have open when working in Pro Tools, the lower the setting you
want to have. Set it as high as you can without affecting the response of your
screen redraws. A good setting to start with is around 75% to 85%.
DAE Playback Buffer
The DAE (Digidesign Audio Engine) playback buffer deals with the amount of
memory the audio engine uses to manage the hard drive’s buffers. Again you
want as low a setting as you can get without sacrificing system performance.
If the setting is too high, you experience a delay between when you hit the
Play command and when Pro Tools starts playing the recording. Too low a
setting, on the other hand, can create problems such as audio dropout —
the sound cuts off — when you record or play back tracks. Start with the
default setting and make adjustments as needed.
The ins and outs of inputs and outputs
Pro Tools allows you to assign your Input, Output, Insert, and Bus routings
as you want. You do this within the I/O Setup window, shown in Figure 3-3.
(Choose Setups➪I/O Setup to get there.)
Input
The Input tab of the I/O Setup window menu lets you choose and change the
name of the inputs coming from your Digidesign hardware. Simply clicking
the Default button brings up the inputs of the hardware you have connected.
If you want to change the name of any of the inputs, double-click the current
name, type in your new one and press Return. Whatever name you choose
shows up in the Input section of the channel strip in the Mix and Edit 
windows.
Customizing the names of your inputs and outputs makes setting up sessions
and remembering where everything is routed much easier. For example, if
you use the S/PDIF inputs as your main microphone inputs (you’d have an
external preamp and a A/D converter between your mic and the interface)
you can name them mic 1 and mic 2 instead of S/PDIF. 

Book II
Chapter 3
Examining 
Software Basics
Getting Set Up
151
Instead of choosing the default setup, you can start from scratch and set up
your own Input routings by selecting the New Path or New Subpath options.
You can also delete paths if you choose. Additionally, you can import or export
routing settings by choosing the Import or Export buttons. This can save you
time if you have custom settings that you want to use in all your sessions.
Output
Clicking the Default button in the Output tab of the I/O Setup window dis-
plays the outputs of the hardware connected to your system. As was the
case with the Input tab of the I/O Setup window, you can change names
for the outputs if you want. The Output tab, however, has three additional
options, as shown in Figure 3-4: Meter, Audition, and Default Output. These
options do the following:
✦Meter: This is the output assigned to the master meter in the Mix window.
This pop-up menu lets you assign any of your hardware or bus outputs
as main outputs so you can know what the levels are.
✦Audition: This is the output where audio regions — the representations
of the audio files in your tracks — play. (Book 4, Chapter 1 has more on
audio regions.)
✦Default Output: Choosing your main output here automatically places
this output in every track that you open in your session. Making your
main output your default output makes things quicker and easier
because you don’t have to choose an Output setting in the Mix or Edit
window whenever you create a new track.
Figure 3-3:
The I/O
Setup
window lets
you set your
system’s
routings.

Dealing with Sessions
152
Insert
The Insert tab of the I/O Setup window allows you to set the routing for any
of your insert effects, such as compressors and limiters. (See Book 6,
Chapter 4 for more on insert effects.)
Bus
The Bus tab of the I/O Setup window has the 16 available buses for your
send/return effects, such as reverb. (Check out Book 6, Chapter 5 for more
on send/return effects.)
Choose Default for all the settings in the various tabs of the I/O Setup
window and you’ll be up and running quickly.
Dealing with Sessions
Before you can do any recording, editing, or mixing in Pro Tools you have to
set up a session in which to work. A session in Pro Tools is simply a song file
that contains all the audio and MIDI tracks, plug-ins, and mixer settings for
all your tracks. Session files don’t actually contain the audio data; they just
have the audio files attached to them.
Creating a new session
To create a new session, choose File➪New Session from the main menu or
press Command+N on a Mac or Control+N on a PC. A dialog box appears, as
shown in Figure 3-5, where you can choose the following:
Figure 3-4:

Dealing with Sessions
153
✦Session Name: This is where you type the name of this new song. 
✦File location: You can choose where you want to save the file on your
hard drive. I recommend that you use the handy New Folder button to
create a new folder for storing the session file and that you name the
folder the same as your session file. This makes it easy to find on your
hard drive — especially if you haven’t worked on the session for a while. 
✦Audio File Type: This pull-down menu lets you choose between BWF
(Broadcast WAV File), AIFF, or SD2 files. Choose the one that works best
for you. (I always use BWF files because they’re compatible with other
software I use. Your needs may be different.) If you aren’t transferring
your files from one program to another, I suggest using the default BWF
option.
✦Sample Rate: Here you choose the sample rate of your session. Your
options will depend on the Digidesign hardware you have. For example,
if you have the Digi-001 or M-Box, your choices will be between 44.1kHz
and 48kHz, whereas if you have a Digi-002 or 002r, you can choose
between 44.1kHz, 48kHz, 88.2kHz, and 96khz.
The higher the sample rate, the more work your computer’s processor
has to do. Often you have to balance your desire for the highest-
resolution music possible against the capabilities of your system.
Figure 3-5:
The New
Session
menu is
where 
you set up 
a new 
song file.

Dealing with Sessions
154
The sample rate you choose depends on your goals, intended final
format (CD, for example), and the speed of your computer’s processor.
For example, if your session is going to have a ton of tracks and end up
on a CD, your best bet is to choose 44.1kHz because that’s where you’ll
end up when you record to CD. Keep in mind, too, that a whole slew of
tracks means your computer will need as much processing power as
possible to handle mixing and processing tasks. In this case, recording
at 96kHz would likely put too much strain on your computer and deprive
you of the power to do what you want during mixing.
On the other hand, if you suspect you won’t use very many tracks and
want the highest resolution possible — or if you have a very powerful
computer and won’t go crazy creating multiple tracks — 88.2kHz or
96kHz may meet your goals better.
I recommend getting to know your system before you record a lot of
music with it. Experiment with different sample rates and track counts
to see what your computer can handle. With this information, you can
get a good sense of how hard you can push your system before you
reach the limits of its performance.
✦Bit Depth: In this box, you can choose between 16- and 24-bit rates.
Choose 24 bit.
✦I/O Settings: In this dialog box, you can choose between the most
recently used setting or a stereo-mix setting.
✦Forced Compatibility: Checking this box ensures that if you transfer
your session from a Mac computer to a PC, you can still open the ses-
sion and work in it. Leave this box checked.
Opening sessions
To open a session, choose File➪Open Session from the main menu or press
Command+O on a Mac or Control+O on a PC. No matter which command you
choose, you get the Open Session dialog box shown in Figure 3-6. Choose the
file you want to open and then click Open.
It’s worth repeating: If you have a session with more than 24 tracks and you
want to keep those additional tracks, don’t open it in a Pro Tools version
before 5.3 (or if you do, don’t save it in there) because any additional tracks
will be lost when you hit Save.
Saving sessions
You have three options for saving sessions in Pro Tools: Save Session, Save
Session As, and Save Session Copy In. These options are detailed in the next
sections.

Book II
Chapter 3
Examining 
Software Basics
Dealing with Sessions
155
Saving a Session
This is the same Save command that you find in any computer program.
As usual, it’s located under the File drop-down menu. (You can also initiate
a save by pressing Command+S (on a Mac) or Control+S (on a PC). 
I highly recommend that you get used to hitting Command+S often to keep
from losing any data while you work. You can also turn on the Auto Save
function and have Pro tools save your session automatically. Choose Setups➪
Preferences to access the Preferences dialog box, click the Operations tab,
and then click in the Enable Session File Auto Backup box.
Using Save Session As
The Save Session As command is located under the File menu; use it to save
your session with a new name and/or location. Figure 3-7 shows the Save As
dialog box.
Use this command if you want to save a variation of a session that you’ve
been working on. I do this a lot when I’m mixing because this way I can have
a bunch of different mixes to choose from later on. The good thing about this
command is that it only saves the session data and not the audio or MIDI
files so it won’t take up much room on your hard drive.
Figure 3-6:
The Open
Session
dialog box.

Dealing with Sessions
156
Choosing Save Session Copy In
If you want to transfer your files from one program to another (Pro Tools
to Logic, for example) the Save Session Copy In command can be useful.
Choosing File➪Save Session Copy In opens the dialog box you see in Figure
3-8. Here you can change the file name, location, and file type, among other
options. Each of these are detailed in the following bullet list: 
✦Session format: This pop-up menu lets you choose the Pro Tools version
you want to save in. Your options will include the current version as well
as PT5, PT4 24bit, PT4 16bit, and PT 3.2. (Keep in mind that you may
lose some data if you save this session in an earlier version.)
✦Session Parameters: The session parameters include audio file type,
sample rate, and bit depth. You can choose from the same options that
you had when you first opened the session. Within this box you can also
choose to force Mac/PC compatibility. If you want to share this session
between a Mac and PC, you need to have this box checked. Personally, I
leave this box checked all the time, just in case I want to transfer my ses-
sions back and forth.
✦Items to Copy: The Items to Copy box includes options for audio files,
plug-in settings, and movie or video files that may be part of the session.
If you plan on taking this session to another computer, use this option
when you choose what you want to copy.

Relying on Revert to Save
Revert to Save (located under the File menu) is a handy feature if you’ve
done a bunch of work since you last saved your session and want to undo
it without having to use the Undo command (located under Edit menu) to
backtrack through the steps and undo each one.
Personally, if I’m in the position of wanting to undo a bunch of stuff and
haven’t used the Save command since starting those changes, I choose to
Save As the session. This way I have those changes just in case that, after
thinking about it for a while, I do decide to keep them. If I go that route, the
changes will be sitting in a separate session file, safe and (ahem) sound.
Creating a session template
To make your life easier, you can create a session template with all the options
you want already in place — track settings, window views, mixer settings,
and so on — so all you have to do when you open a new session is open the
template and save it with your new session name.
To prepare a template, start by opening a new session and then creating
your session as you want. After you’ve got all the options set, save the ses-
sion file with a name that you’ll remember (like killer session template 1) so
you can find it easily.
To transform the session file you saved into a session template, do the steps
listed in one of the following steps lists — one for the Mac and one for the PC.
Figure 3-8:

Using a Mac
Heads up, you Mac users out there:
1. Single-click the file to highlight it.
2. Press Command+I or choose File➪Get Info from the main menu.
The General Information window opens, as shown in Figure 3-9.
3. Check the Stationery Pad box and close the window. 
Your template is now saved in the location that you chose when you
opened the session in the first place.
To later open your template, choose that template name after you choose
File➪Open Session from the main menu.
Using a PC
PC users, here’s the drill:
1. Right-click the file icon to highlight it and choose Properties from the
menu.
The Properties window appears.
2. Check the Read Only box under Attributes on the bottom of the page.
3. Press OK to close the Properties window. 
Your session file is now turned into a template for later use. It remains
located in its original folder. 
To later open your template, choose that template name after you choose
File➪Open Session from the main menu.

A variety of session templates comes with your Pro Tools Hardware. To use
them, choose the Pro Tools LE Session Templates folder from the Software
CD-ROM and drag it onto your hard drive. Open the template session and
rename it as your new session. You can use this folder for all of your tem-
plates so that finding them again is easy — when you want to use one simply
choose File➪Open session from the main menu, select the template folder
from the Open Session dialog box, and scroll to the template you want to use.
Getting to Know Audio and MIDI Files
Every time you hit the Record button with a track engaged (as in Book III,
Chapter 1, where you can find more on tracks) you create an audio or MIDI
file. This section walks you through what these files are and how to deal with
them.
Understanding audio files
An audio file is the data created from recording onto an audio track. Audio
files in Pro Tools are called regions. You can import, export, and edit these
regions in a staggering variety of ways. (Book 4 shows you many of the ways
to edit audio.) Whenever you create a new audio file, this region is added to
the Audio Regions List, where you can manage it (as in Figure 3-10). The
Audio Regions List is located on the right side of the Edit window. If the
list isn’t visible, click the double arrows at the bottom-right of the Edit
window. This expands the Edit window to include the Audio and MIDI
Regions List view.
Meeting MIDI files
MIDI files are created whenever (you guessed it) you record MIDI data into a
MIDI track. MIDI tracks don’t contain actual sounds; instead, they consist of
Figure 3-10:
Audio files
created by
recording
into an

show up in
the Audio
Regions List.

Getting to Know Audio and MIDI Files
160
the MIDI performance and system instructions used to control a MIDI instru-
ment. To have the MIDI data become sound, you have to record the output of
your MIDI sound module (what it does in response to the MIDI file’s instruc-
tions) onto an audio track. Then these sounds are contained in an audio file.
MIDI files show up in the MIDI Regions List (shown in Figure 3-11), where you
can mange them. The MIDI Regions List is located in the lower-right section
of the Edit window, below the Audio Regions List. If the List isn’t visible,
click the double arrows at the bottom-right of the Edit window. This opens
the Audio and MIDI Regions list sections of the window.
Finding your files
Whenever you open a session in Pro Tools, the program has to go out and
find all the audio and MIDI files associated with that session before the ses-
sion will actually open. If, for some reason, Pro Tools can’t find the files — if
you’ve moved them, for instance — then a Missing Files dialog box opens.
There you can choose to skip the file, let Pro Tools search for it automati-
cally, or search for it manually. (See Figure 3-12 for a look at the Missing Files
dialog box.) I always choose the Automatic Search option — it finds the
missing file nearly every time. The only time that hasn’t worked for me is
when I’ve moved a file to another hard drive. (Then I choose the manual
selection method.)

After your session opens, all the audio and MIDI files (regions) for that ses-
sion are displayed in the Audio Regions List or MIDI Regions List in the Edit
window. Not only can you manage the files from these lists, but you can also
import files that were originally recorded in another session — or even using
another recording program (such as Logic or Nuendo).

ecognizing that recording is a complex process, Pro Tools gives you
three distinct windows in which to work: Transport, Mix, and Edit.
Each window performs a certain set of functions and gives you control of a
specific set of details. These are outlined in the sections to follow. These
windows are the heart and soul of Pro Tools and the more comfortable you
are navigating them the easier life will be as you create your masterpieces.
Tackling the Transport Window
At its most basic level, the Transport window — see Figure 4-1 — acts like
the transport mechanism of a tape deck that moves the tape past the record
and playback heads: It controls the digital processes that correspond to
recording, playing, stopping, rewinding, and so on. On a deeper level, how-
ever, it also offers a host of other functions. This section details all the
Transport window’s functions.

164
Adjusting the Transport window
There are those of us who salivate at the thought of information overkill and
those of us who live by the maxim “Less is more.” Pro Tools is smart enough
to accommodate both schools of thought. In case you don’t want all the
information (and the accompanying clutter) present in the Transport
window as shown in Figure 4-1, you can show or hide parts of it as you
choose. You can find the commands for paring down the size of the
Transport window under the Display drop-down menu at the top of the main
Pro Tools window. Just choose Display➪Transport Window Shows and then
choose from the options listed — Counters, MIDI Controls, and Expanded —
as shown in Figure 4-2.
Basic controls
The upper-left portion of the Transport window is home to your basic, tradi-
tional transport controls. If you honed your recording skills on a tape deck,
you’ll be right at home. Taking a look at Figure 4-3, you’ll find (going from left
to right) the following:

✦Online: Engaging this button allows you to control record and
playback with an external device. Before you can use this feature,
you need to connect your device and specify its synchronization
settings in Pro Tools. (Check out the Synchronization section of
the Pro Tools Reference guide that came with your software for
details on how to do this.)
✦Return to Zero: Clicking here takes you back to the beginning of
the session. You can also press Return on a Mac or Enter on a PC
if you prefer to use your keyboard instead of the mouse.
✦Rewind: This button “rewinds” the session in one of two ways,
providing a fine-tuned control that’s really hard to get with the
mechanics of a tape deck:
• Press the button down and hold it. The session rewinds until you
release it. One cool thing about this way of rewinding is that when
you release the Rewind button, a marker is placed in the song — and
all you have to do to rewind back to that point is hit the Stop button.
The session goes right back to that point. (This is great if you want
check the same spot several times — for example, to make sure that
new guitar part comes in right on cue.)
• Click the button. Each click rewinds the session a prescribed amount,
depending on the time-scale setting displayed in your Main Counter
(more about that in the next section). For example, if you have your
Main Counter set up to display bars and beats, then clicking the
Rewind button moves the session back one bar of music. If you have
min:seconds or samples showing in the display, then the session
moves back in one-second increments.
✦Stop: Stop simply stops the session. (You can get the same thing
done much faster, though, by pressing the Spacebar on your 
keyboard — no fumbling with the mouse required.)
✦Play: The Play button starts the session. Simply hitting the Play
button (or pressing the Spacebar) starts playback; pressing the
Record button first and then the Play button starts recording (as
long as you have a track enabled to record — and Book 3, Chapter
3 covers this in detail).
✦Fast Forward: To move quickly through the session, just use the
Fast Forward button. You can use Fast Forward one of two ways: 
• Press and hold the button. The session fast-forwards until you
release the button. Depending on whether you were playing the 
session when you press and hold the button or the session was
stopped, releasing the Fast Forward button can either return you
to play mode or stop the session at that point.

• Click the button. Each click forwards the session a prescribed
amount based upon the time scale setting displayed in your Main
Counter (see next section). For example, if you have your Main
Counter setup to display bars and beats, clicking the Rewind
button moves the session back one bar of music. If you have
min:seconds or samples set in the display, the session moves back
by one-second increments.
✦Go to End: This button takes you to the end of the session. If you
don’t want to use your mouse, you can also press Option+Return
on a Mac or Control+Enter on a PC.
✦Record: The Record button readies your session to record any
enabled tracks (Book 3, Chapter 3 talks about this more). You
need to have at least one track enabled for this function to work.
You’ll be alerted if you don’t. If you want to skip using the mouse,
you can ready recording by pressing Command+Spacebar on a
Mac or Control+Spacebar on a PC. To actually record you need to
press the Play button after pressing Record.
In addition to readying recording, you can toggle through the different
Record modes by pressing the Control key while you click with your
mouse (on a Mac) or right-click (on a PC). These Record modes are
covered in detail in Book 3, Chapter 4, but here is an overview:
• Nondestructive: This Record mode is indicated (rather subtly) by
not showing an icon in the Record button; it doesn’t delete any 
previous takes (a take is a recorded performance) on that track.
• Destructive: This mode — indicated by a small D in the center of the
Record button — records over the track, destroying any previous
takes as it does so. Don’t use this mode unless you absolutely don’t
want the previous take, because it’s gone forever.
• Loop: This mode — indicated by a loop graphic inside the Record
button — allows you to repeatedly record over a selected section of
your track (called, curiously enough, a loop). It’s a handy function if
you have a section that may need more than one try to get right —
when you’re done recording a take, it returns you to the start of the
looped section and begins recording over again. Each loop through
the section is saved and added to your track’s playlist where you can
choose the best one later.
• Quick-punch: This mode is indicated by a “P” in the center of the
Record button. Quick-punch allows you to automatically punch in
and out of a section of a song. If, for example, your bass player just
laid down a killer part except for two lousy notes, you can rerecord
just those notes on the fly by punching in (start recording) just before
the notes and punching out (stop recording) right after them.

Counters
The Counters section of the Transport window tells you where you are in the
session. This section contains only the main counter for your session. 
If the Counters section isn’t visible, choose Display➪Transport Window
Shows from the main menu and then choose Counter — to see the Main
Counter — and/or Expanded — to see the rest of the counters listed in this
section. (Figure 4-4 shows how the Transport window looks with both these
options checked.)
The Counters section of the Transport window is home to the main counter,
which is located in the center of the window and shows where you are in the
session. There is a pull-down menu located to the right of this counter where
you can choose the format — bars:beats, min:seconds, samples — to be
displayed. Simply click the white triangle and choose the format you desire.
Expanded
The Expanded section of the Transport window shows a secondary counter
for your session as well as additional goodies to help you get around your
session. These include pre- and post-roll setting, a transport master selector
for synchronizing Pro Tools with other devices, and start, end, and length
times for selections. These are all shown in Figure 4-4. 
The Expanded section of the Transport window contains the following dis-
play extras: 
✦Secondary Counter: Below the Main Counter is a secondary counter 
for your session. You can select the format displayed by opening the
Figure 4-4:
The
Counters
and
Expanded
sections 
of the
Transport
window.

Tackling the Transport Window

pull-down menu to the right of the counter. Again, your choices are
bars:beats, min:seconds, and samples. This lets you have two 
different counters displayed at one time, which is handy if you want
to see where you are in your session in two different formats, such as
minutes/seconds and bars/beats. 
✦Pre-roll: The pre-roll allows you to choose an amount of time that the
session plays before a) the timeline of your session begins, or b) wher-
ever you have the Start cursor. This is useful if you use a click track (the
equivalent of an electronic metronome) or want to do some punch
recording; whoever’s playing can use it to get used to the tempo before
you start to record. (See the “MIDI controls” section, later in this chap-
ter, for more on using a click track. See Book 3, Chapter 4 for more on
punch recording.)
You choose the amount of your pre-roll by clicking in the value in the
Pre-roll counter and then either typing a new value or (with the mouse
button held down) scrolling up or down. Engage the Pre-roll function by
clicking the Pre-roll box next to the counter.
✦Post-roll: The post-roll is pretty much like the pre-roll except (surprise,
surprise) in this case you tack on a specified amount of time after the
session ends (or wherever the timeline End point is set).
You choose the length of your post-roll by clicking in the value in the
Post-roll counter and either typing a new value or, with your mouse held
down, scrolling up or down. Engage the Post-roll function by pressing
the Post-roll box next to the counter.
✦Transport Master: The drop-down menu of the Transport Master box
lets you choose a specific device for the main Transport functions (play,
record, stop, and so on) to control. In this menu, you can choose from
several options, including MMC (MIDI Machine Control), MIDI, and
Machine. (The last-named refers to Digidesign’s MachineControl 
software, which you have to buy from Digidesign. This is used for 
post-production and film work.) If you want to get into synchronizing
Pro Tools with other devices, check out the Digidesign reference 
manual for details on how to do this. If you have no other control
devices synchronized to Pro Tools, then this box says Transport =
Pro Tools.
✦Start: Use the Start counter to set the beginning of a range within 
which you can play or record. You choose this starting point by click-
ing in the Counter window and then either typing in the value or clicking
and holding with your mouse (scrolling up or down to get the value you
want).

Book II
Chapter 4
Understanding the
Pro Tools Windows
Tackling the Transport Window
169
✦End: The End counter shows you where the play or record range ends.
You can choose this endpoint by clicking in the counter window and
then either typing in the value or clicking and holding with your mouse
(scrolling up or down to get the value you want).
✦Length: The Length counter shows the length of the play range created
with the Start and End counters. As with the other counters, you can
type in a value by clicking in the counter window first or you can
click and hold your mouse button while you scroll up or down.
Typing in a value other than what is shown after you set the Start and
End counter changes the placement of the End counter.
MIDI controls
The MIDI controls section is located on the right side of the Transport
window. (If it’s not showing in your Transport window, choose Display➪
Transport Window Shows➪MIDI Controls.) The MIDI Controls section,
shown on the right side of Figure 4-5, includes the following:
✦Wait for Note: Clicking this button lets Pro Tools know it should
wait to start recording until it receives a musical note from a MIDI
device. This allows you to ensure that your first note is precisely
at the beginning of the recorded section.
✦Click: This button turns on and off the metronome signal sent
through the MIDI out of your MIDI interface.
Double-clicking this button opens the Click/Countoff Options dialog box
(see Figure 4-6) where you can choose various Click parameters, includ-
ing when the click sounds, what note it transmits, and what MIDI port
(output) it uses.
Figure 4-5:
The MIDI

of the
Transport

Tackling the Transport Window
170
✦Count-off: This button turns on and off a specified count-off of
the length chosen at the bottom of the Click/Countoff dialog box
(Figure 4-6). (Double-clicking the Countoff button opens this box.)
You can set the count-off to sound only during recording or during
both recording and playback. You type in the length of this count-
off in the Click/Countoff box. This number shows up in the count-
off button once the dialog box is closed.
✦MIDI Merge: Using this selector, you can either merge your
recorded MIDI data with existing MIDI data on the record-enabled
track or erase the existing data and replace it with the new stuff.
Engaging the button lets you merge data.
✦Conductor: Clicking this button turns on the tempo map defined
in the Tempo line of the Edit window (see “Examining the Edit
Window,” later in this chapter, for more on the Tempo line). You
create this map by double-clicking the Meter button (described
next).
Alternatively, you can disable this button and choose a tempo by
manually entering it (more about choosing the tempo in a minute).
✦Meter: This button shows you the time signature for the present
section of the session. Double-click this icon and a dialog box
opens, allowing you to specify time signature (meter), tempo, and
start point for these values. With this dialog box you can set up a
tempo map, a scheme describing tempo changes for your entire
song, no matter how complex. (Book 3, Chapter 2 details how to
create a tempo map.)

✦Note: When the Conductor button is not engaged, the Note icon
tells you what value note the metronome is sounding. Click this
icon and a drop-down menu opens, letting you choose the value
from whole notes to sixteenth notes.
✦Tempo: With the Conductor button engaged, this box simply
shows you what tempo the current section of the session is in;
with the Conductor button disabled, you can manually enter any
tempo you like. You can do this in one of three ways:
• Typing it in. By clicking in the box where the tempo is displayed
you can type in a number, in beats per minute. Press Return and the
metronome and counters play at this tempo.
• Tapping it in. By tapping the Tap button you can get Pro Tools to
play the tempo without you having to know exactly how many beats
per minute you want. (This is a great feature for people who aren’t
comfortable with metronome numbers.)
• Sliding it in. By adjusting the horizontal slider located under
the Conductor, Meter, and Tempo buttons, you can choose your
tempo. Slide to the right and you get a faster tempo; slide left for a 
slower one.
Examining the Edit Window
The Edit window, shown in Figure 4-7, is where you’ll do most of your work.
Here, everything is set up in a timeline so you can see what’s happening in
the session as it plays. This window contains a variety of tracking informa-
tion, including inputs and outputs, sends, inserts, and automations data. The
Edit window also has the tools you need to do any editing of audio and MIDI
data you may want, such as creating, arranging, and editing specific regions
of an audio track.
The list is almost endless. Don’t fret though; everything you need to know to
use this window effectively is in this section.
Taking a look at track controls
Each track, whether audio or MIDI, is shown in the Edit window. These run
horizontally underneath the Timeline section of the window. Figure 4-8 gives
you a close-up view of the track section of the Edit window.

Basic controls
On the far left of the track section of the Edit window you have some basic
controls. These include the following:
✦Track Name button: By double-clicking this button (which shows the
name of the track) you can open a window that lets you change the
track’s name and also add some comments. (All comments show up in
the Comments section of the expanded Edit window or in the Mix
window.)
✦Playlist selector: Click and hold this button to open a drop-down menu
that allows you to choose from edit playlists (see Book 4, Chapter 1 for
more on edit playlists).
✦Record Enable button: Press this button if you want to enable the track
for recording.
✦Solo button: Depressing this button solos a track — turns off the rest of
the tracks — in a mix.
✦Mute button: Depressing this button turns off this track.
✦Track View selector: Click and hold this button to open a menu that lets
you choose different views in the Timeline section of the track in the
session. Your options include Blocks, Waveform, Volume, Mute, and Pan.
✦Track Height selector: This arrow opens a drop-down menu from which
you choose the height of the track data display. You choices include
Mini, Small, Medium, Large, Jumbo, and Extreme.
✦Automation Mode selector: Click and hold this button to open a menu
that lets you choose from various automation modes, including volume,
mute, pan, and send level. Each of these display modes shows the wave-
form in the background and the setting for the automation data in the
foreground. (Book 6, Chapter 6 has more on automation modes and how
to use them.)
✦Voice selector: This button turns the track on and off. Click and hold
this button to choose between auto (the track is heard if it has data 
in it) and off (the track doesn’t sound, even if it has an audio or MIDI file
attached to it). Since Pro Tools LE only allows you to have 32 active voices
(24 on versions 5.3.1 and older) you can use this selector to keep a track
from occupying one of those voices.
Optional windows in the track section
You can enhance your Edit window view by adding information from the Mix
window for each track. Just choose Display➪Edit Window Shows➪All from
the main menu and you’ll end up with something that looks like Figure 4-9.

Examining the Edit Window
174
This is a handy feature if you only have one monitor and you want to be able
to see the comments, inserts, sends, and I/O settings (or any combination)
for each track without having to open the Mix window. (Not sure what
inserts, sends, and I/O settings actually are? Don’t worry. I detail those
in the “Managing the Mix Window” section, later in this chapter.)
One of the really cool things in this section of the expanded window is that
you can actually open a channel strip for an individual track by clicking the
small fader icon located at the lower right of the I/O settings window. Click
the icon again and the channel strip disappears. Figure 4-10 shows the chan-
nel strip after being called up from the Edit window. (This feature is so
handy that I rarely use the Mix window anymore.)

Chapter 4
Understanding the
Pro Tools Windows

Examining edit modes
Editing in Pro Tools is done on regions. Regions are representations of the
audio or MIDI files stored on your hard drive. What makes editing this way
so powerful is that when you change a region you aren’t actually changing
the audio file itself (there are some exclusions to this, which are covered in
Book 4, Chapters 3 and 4, and Book 5, Chapter 3) you are only changing the
way that Pro Tools plays it back. 
When you want to move regions around in Pro Tools, you have four edit
modes in which to work: Shuffle, Spot, Slip, and Grid (shown in Figure 4-11).
These are located in the upper-left corner of the Edit Window. The following
bullet list describes each of these modes:
✦Shuffle: Using this mode, you can shuffle a region around and place it
automatically at the end of the nearest region. For example, if you want
to move the second bar of a four-bar phrase to the last bar, all you have
to do is create a separate region for each bar, grab it by clicking it with
the Grabber tool, and move it over to the end. (Book 4, Chapter 2
explains, in detail, how to do this.) The third bar moves over to replace
the second; the original second bar snaps right to the end of the fourth
bar. This mode is handy for shuffling regions around while making sure
that there is no overlap or dead space between them.
✦Spot: You can use this mode to designate the exact timeline placement
of a region you want to move. When you click a region with Spot mode
active, a dialog box pops up, asking you to enter the start point. Do so,
click OK, and the selected region is placed right where you want it.
✦Slip: Use this mode to move regions anywhere you want with your mouse
by selecting them any of the ways described in Book 4, Chapter 2. You
can have regions overlap or leave space between them, for instance.
Figure 4-11:
The four edit
modes in
Pro Tools.

Examining the Edit Window
176
✦Grid: This mode enables you to move regions to a time grid — user-defined
divisions of your session. You can set the time grid’s scale by choosing
Tools➪Grid Value in the main Edit window.
For more detailed information on these edit modes, check out Book 4,
Chapter 1.
Zeroing in on Zoom controls
The Zoom controls (Figure 4-12) are located next to the Edit Mode selectors.
Use these buttons to fit a good working view of your audio and MIDI regions
into your screen by specifying horizontal and vertical zoom (as the following
list makes clear):
✦Horizontal Zoom: These outer two Zoom buttons control the horizontal
zoom of the timeline, and of all audio and MIDI tracks and regions.
Clicking the left button narrows the view; clicking the right button
lengthens it.
✦Vertical Zoom: These two center Zoom buttons control vertical zoom
for audio and MIDI — the button for audio is at center-left and the one
for MIDI is at center-right. Clicking the arrow at the top of either button
increases the height of the display; clicking the arrow at the bottom
decreases the height.
✦Zoom Presets: At the bottom of the Zoom Controls section are five —
easily programmable — presets. On a Mac, you simply Command+
Click any one of the five buttons to assign your present setting to that
button. On a PC, Control+Click does the trick. The zoom settings are
saved and you can recall them by clicking on the assigned preset
number. 
Elucidating edit tools
Pro Tools has some powerful editing features, easily accessible from the 
Edit toolbar found next to the zoom controls at the top of the Edit window.
Figure 4-12:
The Zoom
controls.

Book II
Chapter 4
Understanding the
Pro Tools Windows
Examining the Edit Window
177
Figure 4-13 shows you what the toolbar icons for these tools look like and
the following list tells you what the tools can do for you:
✦Zoomer: The Zoomer tool does much the same thing as the Horizontal
Zoom tool, with a handy editing advantage: It zooms right in to the point
that you click with your mouse or the area you click-drag across.
✦Standard Trimmer: This tool lets you change the size of a region by
clicking the beginning or end of the region and then sliding it to where
you want it.
✦Selector: Use the Selector tool to highlight a spot within a region so you
can cut, paste, or do whatever you want with it. All you have to do is
click and drag the mouse over the section you want to select.
✦Grabber: In general terms, the Grabber tool lets you grab a region to
move around your session. It has two options (which you can view if
you click and hold the mouse button with the pointer over the tool): the
Time and Separation tools (whichever tool you used last is the default
tool until you select the other).
• Time: The Time Grabber tool lets you select an entire region and
then move it anywhere within — and between — tracks. You simply
click the region with your mouse, hold down the button, and then
drag the region to where you want it.
• Separation: The Separation Grabber tool lets you move a portion of
a region within or between tracks. To select a portion to move, use
the Selector tool shown earlier in this list.
✦Scrubber: The Scrubber tool lets you listen to a region without having to
play the entire track. To use this tool, click the region and drag it for-
ward to hear the audio play forward. Drag the mouse back along the

region and you can ear the audio play backward. This tool is handy
when you want to locate a specific note in the audio region.
✦Pencil: The Pencil tool can be used to redraw audio waveforms (great
for drawing over clipped notes for example), to do MIDI editing, such as
inserting or deleting notes, or to draw automation settings, among other
things. (Book 4, Chapter 3 explains waveform editing in detail.) Clicking
and holding this button opens a pop-up menu that offers five Pencil
types (shown in Figure 4-14) as well as the Customize Note Duration
option to use. (For more on custom note durations, see Book 4, 
Chapter 3.)
✦Smart Tool: This tool combines the functions of the Standard Trimmer,
Selector, and Grabber tools. It changes the way the cursor works according
to where you are within a region, automatically becoming the appropriate
tool for that section. This keeps you from having to constantly switch tools
as you work. (Ah, progress.)
Looking at Counter displays
The Edit window has two distinct Counter displays, and for each display
you have a choice among three different formats — bars and beats, minutes
and seconds, and samples — for showing where you actually are in the ses-
sion. You choose your format from a drop-down menu that you access by
clicking the small arrow located to the right of the display, as shown in
Figure 4-15. This is a handy feature for being able to see where you are in
your session. For example, I find that having my main counter to bars and
beats and the secondary counter set to minutes and seconds helps me keep
track of where I am in the session and how that relates to the actual length
of the tune. This is especially important if I have a tune that has to conform
to a certain time limit, since I prefer to work in beats and bars.

Evaluating the Event Edit area
Next to the Counter displays are the Event Edit displays. (See Figure 4-16.)
These displays show the start point, end point, and length of a selected
region in the same format as the main Counter display (see previous section
for more on Counter displays). If you choose a specific MIDI note to examine,
another window opens that shows you the pitch, note velocity, and release
velocity of that note.
You can use the display to choose particular regions by clicking in the
window and typing in the values you want. Press Return (Mac) or Enter
(PC) to activate the selection.
Instead of typing start points and end points into the Event Edit display, you can
use the blue arrows in the Rulers section of the Edit window to choose your
start point and end point, as shown in Figure 4-17. Click and drag each arrow to
where you want it. You can also use the Selector tool and click-drag across the
area you want to select. Book 4, Chapter 2 explains these options in detail.

The Black Bar hodgepodge
You’ll find Edit Mode buttons, Zoom controls, Edit tools, Location displays,
and Event Edit displays — all the stuff we’ve talked about so far in this
chapter — marching along the very top of the Edit window. Right beneath all
these features, however, is a thin black toolbar that plays host to yet another
variety of useful tools. (Refer to Figure 4-7 to see the black toolbar in all its
glory.) The following list gives you the goods on what each tool can do for you:
✦Track View: The Track View tool lets you choose different view
formats for the Track section (the left-most column) of the Edit
window. Clicking the downward-pointing arrow calls up a pop-up
menu, where you can choose Comments view, I/O view, Inserts
view, Sends view, All, or None.
✦Ruler View: The Ruler View tool lets you choose different view
formats for the Ruler section — the section running horizontally
along the top of the Edit window. Clicking the downward-point
arrow calls up a pop-up menu, where you can choose to see the
Main Counter, Tempo, Meter, Markers, All, or None. The selection(s)
you make here appear in the Timebase ruler section of the Edit
window. (Check out the “Rulers rule!” section later in this chapter
for details on the Timebase ruler.)
✦Tab to Transients: The Tab to Transients button, when engaged,
allows you to press the Tab key on your keyboard and move from
transient to transient in the highlighted audio track. (A transient,
by the way, is the loud initial attack that first attracts your
attention to a sound.)
I love this feature for separating drum loops from a track. I simply
engage this button, locate my cursor close to the start of my loop,
hit the Tab key, and I’m right at the start of the section I want to cut.
Without this feature I’d be messing around for quite a while to find the
exact start point of the part I want to separate.
✦Command Keyboard Focus: The Command Keyboard Focus button
toggles the Keyboard Focus option on and off. What is the Keyboard
Focus option, you ask? Well, here’s the short answer: This option
allows you to use your keyboard to perform shortcuts — for exam-
ple, you can select regions from the MIDI or audio lists (see the
“Looking at lists” section later in this chapter), perform an edit,
or enable or disable groups. For the long answer — as in, how do
you actually use keyboard shortcuts? — these shortcuts are inter-
spersed throughout the book for each command as I describe
them.

Book II
Chapter 4

✦Link/Unlink: By default the Timeline and Edit selections are linked
so that if you choose a section to edit, the Timeline start and end
times coincide with the start and end times of this selection, as
shown on the left in Figure 4-18. Sometimes you want to be able to
have a timeline setting remain unchanged as you select a different
place to edit, as on the right in Figure 4-18. (In this case, click the
Link/Unlink button once to turn linking off; click again to turn link-
ing back on.)
✦Grid Value: This display shows the value for the Edit Window’s
grid — the boundary lines for your session. The grid boundary
value appears in the same format as the main time scale —
bars/beat, min: seconds, or samples — unless you choose other-
wise in the pull-down menu, where you also choose the boundary
resolution for the grid itself. This is a great function when you
want to move regions around in a tune and have them align to cer-
tain locations. For example, if I move drum grooves around I can
have them snap right to the beginning of a bar by setting the grid
value to 1 measure and moving the region close to the start of the
measure. 
✦Nudge Value: The Nudge Value display shows the setting for the
distance that a region is moved with each press of the plus and
minus keys on your keyboard. Clicking the downward-pointing
arrow calls up a pop-up menu, shown in Figure 4-19, where you 
can choose this “nudge” value. Note that you can choose a number
of different ways how your distances are to be measured —
Bars:Beats, Min:Secs, Samples, or Regions/Markers.

✦Cursor: The Cursor display tracks where your cursor is in the timeline
as well as the location of the sound wave in the selected track. (See
Figure 4-20.)
Looking at lists
In the humdrum world, it’s hard to get excited about laundry lists and shop-
ping lists. In the world of Pro Tools, however, lists are something to crow
about, because they can help you keep track of your tracks, audio regions,
MIDI regions, and groups.
The lists for your tracks, edit groups, audio files, and MIDI files are displayed
on either side of the Edit window. To keep track of — and/or manipulate —
any of these lists, you’re going to want to familiarize yourself with one more
list of features:
✦Show/Hide Tracks list: The Show/Hide Tracks list lets you choose which
tracks get displayed in your Edit and Mix windows. As Figure 4-21 shows,
Figure 4-20:

you can choose to show all tracks, hide all tracks, or to show/hide only
those tracks you’ve already selected. This menu is opened by click-hold-
ing over the Show/Hide title at the left side of the Edit window. (Refer to
Figure 4-7.) If the Show/Hide section of the window isn’t visible, click 
the double arrows at the far lower left of the Edit window. The Show/
Hide and Edit Groups (see next bullet) section appear.
✦Edit Groups: In Pro Tools, you can group together selected tracks and
perform an edit on them all at the same time. This is called working with
an Edit Group. These groups are displayed in the Edit Groups list and
clicking the name of the group toggles the enabling of a group on and off.
You can also create, delete, or suspend groups by click-holding the Edit
Groups title at the top of the groups list and then choosing an option
from the pop-up menu that appears, as shown in Figure 4-22.
✦Audio Regions: Audio Regions in Pro Tools are the representations of
the audio files associated with your session. The Audio Regions list
shows all the audio regions that are part of your session. You can do a

host of things to your audio regions such as renaming them, clearing
them, exporting them, compacting them, and so on. 
These functions are performed by opening the pop-up menu shown in
Figure 4-23. To open this menu, click-hold the Audio title at the top of the
Audio Regions list. If the Audio Regions list isn’t open in your session,
click the double arrow at the bottom-right corner of the Edit window to
open it.
✦MIDI Regions: The MIDI Regions list shows all the MIDI regions in your
session. By clicking open the pop-up menu shown in Figure 4-24, you
can manage your MIDI regions by (for example) sorting them, renaming
them, and importing them. This menu is accessed by click-holding the
arrows next to the name of the track.

Rulers rule!
Lists hover discretely to the left or right of the Edit window. Rulers (as you
might expect) lord it over the top of the Edit window and are masters of all
they survey.
In Pro Tools-speak, rulers are actually referred to as Timebase Rulers; they
show you where you are within the session (Figure 4-25). The Timebase
Rulers section of the Edit window also lets you view the time, tempo, meter,
and markers of a session. The following list gives details the four timelines:
✦Time: You have a choice between the now-familiar formats of Bars:Beats,
Min:Secs, and Samples. By default, this timeline shows the same time
format as the Main Counter, but it’s easy to change to one of the other for-
mats. Just choose Display➪Ruler View Shows and then choose the format
you want included in the Timebase Rulers section, as shown in Figure 4-26.

✦Tempo: The Tempo timeline shows you all the tempos and tempo
changes in your section. But there’s more! Using the Tempo timeline,
you can quickly change the tempos in the session by clicking the little
Note icon to the left of the Tempo title all the way to the left side of the
figure. Doing so opens the Tempo Meter Change dialog box, where you
can enter a new tempo for the session. Book 3, Chapter 3 goes into detail
about creating Tempo changes (called tempo maps) in your session.
If you don’t plan on having any tempo changes and really don’t want to
see the Tempo timeline, you can hide it by choosing Display➪Ruler View
Shows from the main menu and then deselecting the Tempo option.
✦Meter: This timeline shows the meters (time signatures) contained in
your session. To change the meter, click the little #/# icon to the left of
the Meter title all the way to the left side of the figure. This opens the
Tempo Meter Change dialog box. 
If you prefer not to see this timeline, you can hide it by choosing Display➪
Ruler View Shows from the main menu and then deselecting the Meter
option.
✦Markers: The Markers timeline shows the position of session markers.
(For more on session markers, see Book 3, Chapter 2.) Clicking the
Marker icon to the left of the marker’s name opens a dialog box where
you can enter your marker information, as shown in Figure 4-27. Markers
are great for quickly locating sections of your tune. For example, pacing
a marker at the start of the verses and choruses can make moving
between them a breeze. You can even use markers in Pro Tools to recall
visual settings — track height, zoom settings — or record and playback
options — pre- and post-roll times — as well as the enabling of grouped
tracks for speedy editing.

Managing the Mix Window
187
Managing the Mix Window
The Mix window is like a standard mixer, housing channel strips of each
track type available in Pro Tools. Not only do these track types include
audio, MIDI, auxiliary, and master tracks, as shown in Figure 4-28, but you
can also choose various views of the channel strips, from a basic view to
expanded views showing comments, inserts, and sends. Moreover, in addi-
tion to all your channel strips, the Mix window can list all the tracks in your
session, along with any grouped tracks you may have created.
I know this sounds like a lot to keep track of (so to speak), but don’t worry. The
upcoming sections fill you in on all you need to know to keep things straight.
Checking out channel strips
Each track in the Mix window has its own channel strip, and these channel
strips perform the same kinds of tasks you’d see channel strips doing in a
Figure 4-28:

hardware mixer, stuff like volume control, panning, effects sends and inserts,
mute and solo switches, automation, input and output routing, and enabling
recording. The Mix window can handle pretty much any kind of track you
can imagine, including the track types covered in the next few sections.
Audio track
Your audio track is your basic meat-and-potatoes track, the main building
block in your sonic universe. Getting the audio track to do exactly what you
want takes a lot of work; Pro Tools is well aware of this fact, and therefore
provides you with a full-featured tool palette so you can take care of busi-
ness. More specifically, the audio track’s channel strip contains the following
tools (as shown from top to bottom in Figure 4-29):
✦Input: Clicking the Input button opens a pop-up menu where you can
choose the sound source that feeds the track. It can either be a physical
input from your hardware interface or it can be a bus (an internal signal
path; see Book 1, Chapter 3 for more on buses). The hardware you use
(Digi-002, M-Box, or whatever) determines the number of inputs you
have to choose from.
✦Output: This button controls the output of the track — where the sound
goes when it leaves the track. Like the input selector button (see above)
clicking it opens a menu that lets you choose from either the hardware
outputs of your interface or any of 16 buses (internal signal paths) avail-
able in Pro Tools.
✦Automation Mode: In Pro Tools, automation means having certain mix
parameters, such as volume, panning, mute, send level, and insert level
adjust dynamically throughout the session. Using this button you can
choose between the different automation modes, including Off, Read,
Touch, Latch, or Write. (Book 6, Chapter 6 details these automation
modes.)
✦Panning Slider: Use the slider to pan your track to the left or right in the
stereo field, which is sort of the audio equivalent of a movie scene. (For
more on panning, see Book 6, Chapter 1.)
✦Panning Display: This display shows you your track’s panning position —
its place left, right or center, in the stereo field.
✦Solo and Mute: These buttons either solo or mute the track. (For more
on soloing/muting, see Book 6, Chapter 1.)
✦Record Enable: Pressing the Record Enable button enables the track for
recording. When enabled, this button flashes red.
✦Voice On/Off: This selector lets you choose between Off, where the track
does not play, or Auto, where the track plays if there is data present.

✦Volume Fader: This is the control for setting the volume of the audio
contained in this track.
✦Velocity Meter: This display, located to the right of the Volume Fader,
shows you the volume (“velocity,” in Pro Tools-speak) of the track as the
music plays. Any notes above digital 0 show in red at the top of the display.
✦Group: The little red G is present if this track is grouped with others.
You can find out which group it belongs to by clicking and holding over
the icon.
✦Track Type: This icon shows you what type of track it is. In Figure 4-28,
the small waveform lets you know that this is an audio track.
✦Numerical Volume: This display shows you the volume of the track in
decibels.
✦Track name: This tells you the name of the track. You can change the
name at any time by clicking the name and typing in a new one.
MIDI track
The MIDI track, shown in Figure 4-30, shares many of the features of the
audio track, but there are some important differences, as the following list
makes clear:
✦Input: The Input button lets you choose the MIDI input feeding this
track. Clicking the button opens a pop-up menu where you can choose
the MIDI port and channel(s) that you want to receive MIDI data from.

✦Output: The Output button lets you choose the physical MIDI output
that you want to assign the track to — any of the 16 MIDI channels (or
choose All).
✦Program Change: This button lets you change the sound that comes
out of your MIDI hardware when a note is played. Clicking this button
opens the MIDI Program Change dialog box. In it, you enter the program
number or name of the sound to want the track to play. This lets you
change sounds throughout the session,
✦Track type: This MIDI track icon looks like a MIDI port.
Auxiliary input track
An auxiliary input track is a track that you can use for grouped audio — or
for MIDI tracks, effects sends, submixes, alternative mixes, monitor mixes,
and so on. Auxiliary tracks are similar to audio tracks and have the same
functions, except you don’t have a record-enable button because these
tracks don’t actually contain any audio; they are only for routing other
tracks through them. The Track Type icon is a downward-facing blue
arrow. Figure 4-31 shows a typical auxiliary track’s channel strip.
Master Fader track
The Master Fader track lets you control where your other tracks are sent.
This track’s channel strip is much simpler than the others; all it really does
is sum (add) the other tracks together. The features include just the outputs,
automation modes, fader and velocity display, and the Groups button.

Stereo and mono
Each of the tracks can either be in monaural or stereo. Stereo tracks differ
from mono tracks: They have two panning sliders and two velocity displays
showing. Figure 4-33 shows a stereo track.

Stereo audio tracks take up two voices in your system. (Any audio track
that’s active takes up a “voice” — Book 3, Chapter 1.) Since you can only
have a total of 32 voices playing in any one session at one time, you need
to choose your stereo tracks wisely.
Expanding the view of the channel strips
You can add three additional views to your channel strips by choosing
Display➪Mix Window Shows from the main menu and then selecting
Comments, Inserts, and/or Sends. Figure 4-34 shows you what you can 
expect to see, and the next few sections tell you the particulars for 
each view.
Comments view
Using this option, you can add comments to each track — just click the
Comments box and type in your comments. This can be helpful for keeping
track of things like microphones used, edits performed, or anything that can
keep you organized while mixing.
Inserts view
The Inserts View section of the channel strip displays any inserted DSPs
(Digital Signal Processors) that you have for each track — usually effects
such as compression or delay. Click the arrows in the window to open a pop-
up menu where you can choose from the plug-ins in your system. Figure 4-35
shows a typical list of these inserts. (Book 6, Chapters 4 and 5 have more on
inserted effects.)

in Figure 4-36) where you choose the bus or interface output to send your
track’s signal. (If you use outboard effects, see Book 6, Chapter 5 for more
details.)
Looking at lists: The Mix Window variant
Plenty of lists appear in the “Examining the Edit Window” section (earlier
in this chapter), but Pro Tools listmaking capabilities crop up in the Mix
window as well. Aside from containing all the channel strips for your project,
the Mix window can also be set to list all the tracks in your session — as well
list any groups you’ve created with those tracks. These lists show up on the
left side of the Mix window, as shown in Figure 4-37.
Show/Hide Tracks list
Going from top to bottom, the first list to the left of the Mix window is the
Show/Hide Tracks list. Each track of your session is listed in this list and
with this List you can show or hide each track by simply selecting or dese-
lecting it in the List window. When you hide a selected track, the channel
strip disappears from the Mix window. This makes it easy to work with indi-
vidual tracks or groups of tracks by keeping your Mix window uncluttered.
To show a hidden track, click that track’s name in the Show/Hide Tracks list
and watch it reappear.

Groups list
The Groups list lets you create and manage grouped tracks — tracks that
you’ve assigned together so that you can edit them together. To create
groups of tracks, hold the Shift key down and click the names of the tracks in
each channel strip to highlight them. After they’re highlighted, click and
hold the Edit Groups title. When a drop-down menu appears, choose Create
Group; when a dialog box appears, enter a name for your new grouped track.
After you’ve created a few groups, you can show or hide them in any combi-
nation that you want.

Chapter 5: Importing and 
Exporting Files 
In This Chapter
 Importing and exporting audio files
 Importing and exporting MIDI files
 Importing and exporting session data
O
ne of the most powerful aspects of Pro Tools is that it can import a
variety of file types and formats into a session, and export them just as
easily. You can record tracks in another session (or even another software
program) and be able to edit, mix, and process them in Pro Tools.
You can (for example) import and export audio files, MIDI files, and session
tracks in formats from AIFF and BWF to Standard MIDI files (SMF) — and
even import raw session data, the tracks, plug-in settings, and other session
details. This chapter covers all these options — and if you have some files
that use bit depths and sample rates different from the session you’re work-
ing on, I show you how to import them, too.
Importing into a Session
If you want to fancy up your Pro Tools session, you can import stuff not only
from other Pro Tools sessions but also from other recording programs such
as Logic. So prepare to get fancy.
Importing audio files
Before Pro Tools can import an audio file into your session, it has to find the
file on your hard drive. Then you can either add the file directly, copy it first
and then plunk it down in your session, or convert it to a different format
before you import it. Here’s a look at the types of files you can import, as
well as the steps that make it all possible.

Importing into a Session
198
Figuring out file types
You can import audio files of the following types into a Pro Tools session:
✦SDII: This stands for Sound Designer II, formerly the native format for
Pro Tools sessions on Macs. This format isn’t used much anymore and
you can’t exchange files of this type with PC computers unless you first
convert them into a different format, such as BWF or AIFF.
✦BWF (WAV): This file type is the standard for older, PC-based Pro Tools
systems. Currently it’s the most commonly used file type (for that
matter, I normally work with it); BWF (Broadcast Wave Files) files are
compatible with both Macs and PCs.
✦AIFF: This stands for Audio Interchange File Format, and it used to be
native to Macs. You don’t have to convert AIFF files to any other format
before importing them into a Pro Tools session, even if it’s on a PC.
✦MPEG-1 Layer 3: This type — yep, it’s the famous MP3 — is a great
format for putting music on the Internet (say, a demo track for your
band), as you’ll find out if you check out Book 8, Chapter 2. If you
choose this option, you have several parameters to choose from when
encoding your music so that you can get the best combination of size
and sound quality.
MP3 is an “option” for Pro Tools: You have to buy the full-feature 
version of this capability if you want to use it any longer than its 30-day
free-trial period. Once your trial period is up you can buy the authoriza-
tion code to keep using this option from Digidesign for $20. Go to www.
digidesign.com/products/products.cfm, click Compatible Software
and, once that page loads, scroll down until you get to the MP3 options
(there’s one for PCs and one for Macs).
✦RealAudio G2: This file format is for streaming audio files received over
the Internet using the RealAudio player. You can use this file format on
all PCs and on Macs running OS 9, but not on Macs using OS X. RealAudio
G2 uses compression to reduce the size of the music file — but when you
downsize the file, you also lose some sound quality, so it’s not recom-
mended for your final mix.
✦QuickTime: This is a Mac-only file type, and Pro Tools offers no built-in
support for it (even though it shows up here). The QuickTime format is
useful if you want to send the file via e-mail to someone. You play
QuickTime files using the Apple QuickTime player — a nice bit of soft-
ware supported by many multimedia applications — but you have to
purchase and install that program separately.

Book II
Chapter 5
Importing and
Exporting Files
Importing into a Session
199
✦Sound Resource: This is a Mac-only format and the only time to use it
(in my opinion) is if you want to play the music in an application that
doesn’t support either SDII or AIFF formats. If you end up with a file in
this format you can convert it easily using the Import Audio to Track
command.
✦Windows Media: This is a Windows-only format. Like with other unsup-
ported file formats, you can convert these files into something useable
by accessing the Import Audio dialog box (Choose File➪>Import Audio
to Track).
Importing audio
The previous section outlined the different types of files Pro Tools can
handle. Now it’s time to look at how you can import those audio files into
Pro Tools. The two most common ways of doing this are
✦From the Audio Regions list: The Audio Regions list is located on the left
side of the Edit window. (If it’s not visible, click on the double arrows at
the bottom right of the Edit window.) To get a file added to this list, click
the Audio Regions List title to display the Audio Regions menu and then
choose Import Audio from the options listed. Doing so gets you the
Import Audio dialog box, as shown in Figure 5-1 — more on that later.
If you want to avoid the menu altogether, just press Shift+Command+I on
a Mac or Shift+Control+I on a PC. This gets you to the selfsame Import
Audio dialog box.
✦From the File menu: Choose File➪Import Audio to Track to access the
Import Audio dialog box, which you can then use to place the audio
directly into a track in your session.
Whichever of these methods you choose, you end up with the Import Audio
dialog box, where you choose the file you want to import.
To keep the Import process rolling along, follow these steps after the Import
Audio dialog box opens:
1. From the File Browser section of the Import Audio dialog box, click
the file you want to import. 
The properties of the selected file appear in the lower half of the dialog
box.

Importing into a Session
200
The easiest way to find the files you want to import is from the browser
section, located under the From drop-down menu. You can use the scroll
bar at the bottom to find the hard drive you want by moving it all the way
to the left. From there, progress to the right by choosing the folders you
want as you go until you get to the actual file you want to import.
You can limit the types of files that show up in the file browser by choos-
ing to display only certain file types (WAV, for example) by selecting this
file type in the Show drop-down menu.
Depending on the properties of the file you select — and the settings in
your session — you have three options: Add, Copy, and Convert.
• Add: If the audio files are the same file type and bit depth as your
session, you can add the files directly into your session. When you
do so, you’re telling Pro Tools to use the original file — not a copy —
from its current place on your hard drive.

Importing into a Session
201
If you have to add files of different file types into your session, you
can — AIFF or WAV on a PC, SDII, AIFF, or WAV on a Mac — but doing
so slows down system performance.
• Copy: If your file is of the same type and bit depth as your session,
you can make a copy of the file to put into your session. Doing this
allows you to place the copy directly in the folder with the other
files in your session. If you destructively alter the copy, you won’t
be altering how the original file plays in any other session. The only
drawback to choosing Copy when importing an audio file is that you’re
adding more stuff that takes up space on your hard drive (not a big
deal these days, given the low cost of huge hard drives).
• Convert: If the file you choose to import is of a different file type, bit
depth, or sample rate as your session, you need to convert it first
before importing it into your session.
When you choose to convert a file, you also choose the quality of
the conversion process. You set the conversion quality of your con-
verted files by using the Editing tab of the Preferences window, as
shown in Figure 5-2. (Choose Setups➪Preferences to get to the
Preferences window.) The menu that controls conversion quality is
located in the middle of the Editing tab of the Preferences window.
Options range from “TweakHead” (highest quality/slowest conver-
sion) to “Low” (lowest quality/fastest conversion).

2. Audition the selected file before importing it by pressing the Play and
Stop buttons in the lower section of the dialog box.
The vertical slider adjusts the volume of your audition; the horizontal
slider adjusts your location in the auditioned file.
3. Click Add, Copy, or Convert to place the file in the Import list.
You can select more than one file by Shift+clicking to highlight the files
you want to include in the list. You can also click Add All or Convert All
to include all the files in the current directory on the Import list.
4. Click Done after you’ve placed all the files in the Import list that you
want to include.
If you chose Convert or Copy when placing the file in the Import list,
you’re prompted to choose a location for the imported files.
If you import using the Import to Track option from the File menu, your
files appear in a separate track within your session and are listed in the Audio
Regions list. If you import using the Import Audio command from the Audio
Regions menu, the files appear in the Audio Regions list — not as a separate
track within your session.
Importing MIDI files
MIDI data contains all the performance information for your MIDI instruments,
but it doesn’t contain any actual sound — you need a sound source for that.
Pro Tools lets you bring that data into a session where you can work with
and add the sounds you want. This data is in the form of a Standard MIDI File.
Standard MIDI files consist of data stored in a common format that can be read
by nearly all MIDI devices. When you import a Standard MIDI file into Pro Tools,
you get two choices: You can import the file directly into a track or you can
import it into your session’s MIDI Regions list. This section details the types
of MIDI files supported by Pro Tools and how to import them.
Figuring out file types
Pro Tools allows you to import the following two types of Standard MIDI files:
✦Type 0: Type 0 Standard MIDI files contain all MIDI data on one track.
When you import this type of file into a session, Pro Tools sorts out data
appropriate for each stereo channel and places the data in separate
regions and tracks.
✦Type 1: Type 1 MIDI files contain multiple tracks of MIDI data. When you
import this type of file into Pro Tools, each track’s data goes to a sepa-
rate MIDI track or region in Pro Tools.

Book II
Chapter 5

Importing MIDI
You can import standard MIDI files into a Pro tools session one of two ways:
✦From the File menu: Choose File➪Import MIDI to Track command in the
File menu to access the Import MIDI dialog box (shown in Figure 5-3),
which you can then use to place the MIDI file directly into a track in your
session.
✦From the MIDI Regions list: The MIDI Regions list is located in the lower
right of the Edit window. If this list is not visible, click the double arrow 
at the bottom-right corner of the window. Choose Import MIDI from the
MDI Regions list menu, which is opened by clicking the MIDI title at the
top of the MIDI Regions list. Doing so gets you the Import MIDI dialog
box, which you can use to put your imported file on the MIDI Regions
List. From there, you can drag the file into an existing MIDI track.
Whichever of these methods you choose, you end up with the Import MIDI
dialog box, where you choose the file you want to import.
Select the file using the browser at the top of the dialog box. Highlight the file.
1. If you want the tempo of the imported MIDI file to override the tempo
of your present session, check the Import Tempo From MIDI File box. 
Figure 5-3:

MIDI dialog
box lets you

Like with the Import Audio dialog box, the easiest way to find the files you
want to import is from the browser section located under the From drop-
down menu. To navigate this browser section, move the scroll bar at the
bottom of the section all the way to the left to find the hard drive that con-
tains your MIDI files. Click it to select it then click the folders you want
from the boxes on the right until you get to the file you want to import.
Choosing this option removes existing tempo-and-meter information
from your current session. If you want to keep the tempo and meter 
settings of your present session, be sure to keep the Use Existing Tempo
From Session check box selected.
2. Click Import (on a Mac) or Open (on a PC). 
Your file is imported into Pro Tools.
You may get a message asking if you want to keep or discard any existing
MIDI tracks or regions in the session. If so, choose one of the options. (If
you already have MIDI tracks that you want to use in the session, be
sure to choose to keep them; if not go ahead and discard them.)
Your successfully imported MIDI file is placed in your session one of two ways:
✦If you imported using the File➪Import MIDI to Track command, your file
has been placed in the appropriate tracks in your session. If this is the
case, select the MIDI channel and instrument you want to specify for
each MIDI track’s output so that you can hear the performances when
you play your session, as described in Book 2, Chapter 4. 
✦If you imported using the MIDI Regions list menu, your MIDI data has
been placed in the MIDI Regions list. Click and drag the files from the
MIDI Regions list into an existing track to put them in your session.
Importing tracks
The Pro Tools Import Bag of Tricks is not limited to just audio and MIDI files.
In fact, you can import entire tracks from another session into your current
session just by using the Import Tracks command. Choose File➪Import
Session Data to call up the Import Session Data dialog box and you’re well
on your way to getting that great track from last month’s session embedded
in your present project.
Understanding the Import Session Data dialog box
The Import Session Data dialog box is where you select the various properties
of the tracks you want to import. If you’re bringing in a track from a previous
session, this is where you choose what aspects of your original track you
want kept (say, keep the plug-in settings and lose the panning settings) 
when it gets imported into your present session.

As Figure 5-4 shows, the Import Session Data dialog box gives you lots of
properties to mull over. (“Do I import? Don’t I import? What parts of this
stuff do I or don’t I import? Ack . . .”) These properties include
✦Source Properties: This box shows the basics — session name, session
type, session start time, bit depth, and sample rate — of the selected
source file.
✦Audio Media Options: This drop-down menu lets you select the way you
copy and consolidate the source’s audio files. Its options include
• Refer to Source Media (Where Possible): Use this option if you want
to avoid duplicating files — it refers to your original files whenever
possible. The files are only copied if they don’t reside on supported
media (such as CD-ROM), or if they have a different sample rate or
bit depth from the session you import into. This saves some space
on your hard drives.
• Copy from Source Media: Choosing this option copies all the audio
files, automatically converting any files that have bit depths or sample
rates that differ from those of the target session. This uses up space
on your hard drive, but with today’s super-cheap drives it’s not as
big a deal as it used to be when drives were expensive.
Figure 5-4:

Data dialog

• Consolidate from Source Media: This option copies and consoli-
dates the audio in regions used in the source session, eliminating any
unused audio from the parent files. When you choose this option,
you also get to choose the “handle” length (the extra time before and
after the region start and end times). This keeps you from importing
any unnecessary material if you’re sure that you won’t be using it in
your session.
• Force to Target Session Format: This option copies — and converts —
any files that don’t have the same bit depth and sample rate as the
target session; it points to (but doesn’t copy) any files that do match
these traits. Use this option if you don’t want any extra stuff taking
up room on your hard drives.
✦Video Media Options: The drop-down menu here gives you two options
when importing video data into a session: You can either copy the stuff
or you can refer to the source material. Which option you choose
depends on how much hard drive space you have and whether you
think you need more than one copy of the original file. If you have tons
of space and think you’ll be editing the data, by all means copy it, but if
you know you won’t be making any changes there’s no need to add to
the clutter of your hard drive.
✦Timecode Mapping Options: Every video file contains time code data
(information that lets you know where you are in the video). You can
choose any of three ways to place imported material in the session:
• Maintain Absolute Timecode Values: This option puts your
imported tracks at the same time location as the source session.
This is a good choice if the session you import into uses the same
start time as your source session and you want the imported session
tracks to remain at the beginning of the session.
• Maintain Relative Timecode Values: This option places the imported
material at the same time from the start of the session as their source
session. This means that if you have tracks in a session that start
30 seconds from the beginning of the session, they will remain 
30 seconds from the start of the session they’re imported into
regardless of what the actual start time of both session are. 
• Map Start Timecode To: This option lets you choose a new start
time for your imported files. When you select this option, you also
select the start time for your imported file in the Time Value field.
This option is useful when you have a different start time on the ses-
sion data you want to import and you want to place the imported
data at a specific point in the new session. This start point is entered
into the Time Value field. 

Book II
Chapter 5

Exporting Files

207
✦Track Offset Options: Selecting this option allows you to place the
tracks relative to their original start times. For example, if you want to
import session data into a track and have it start four measures (bars)
after the session starts you can select this option and enter four bars in
the Time Value field. 
✦Sample Rate Conversion Options: If your source and target sessions
have different sample rates (you select the sample rate of a session
when you create it), you are prompted to select the way the sample rate
conversion is carried out. This area of the Import Tracks dialog box lets
you do that using the following options:
• Source Sample Rate: This option lets you choose the sample rate
from which your source files begin the sample rate process.
• Destination Sample Rate: This setting is always the same as that of
your current session.
• Conversion Quality: This drop-down menu lets you choose the sound
quality you get from the sample-rate conversion process. You have 
a choice among Low (fastest), Good, Better, Best, and TweakHead
(slowest). 
✦Source Tracks: This section of the Import Tracks dialog box shows you
all the source tracks in the session containing the tracks you want to
import. Each track has a drop-down menu that allows you to either
select it for import or not.
✦Import Tempo/Meter Map: This check box allows you to import tempo
and meter maps (specified tempo and meter events throughout the ses-
sion) from the source session. Select this option if your source session
contains tempo and meter information that you want to use in the
target session.
Importing tracks
After you’ve had a chance to get comfortable with the Import Tracks dialog
box, you can get some practical experience by using the following steps to
import some actual tracks into a session:
1. Choose File➪New Session to create a new session or choose
File➪Open Session to open an existing one.
2. Choose File➪Import Session Data from the main menu. 
A dialog box appears, prompting you to choose a file from which to
import session data.
3. Choose the Pro Tools file (.pts suffix) containing the track you want
to import, and then click Open.
The Import Session Data Dialog box opens. (Refer to Figure 5-4.)

Exporting from a Session
208
4. In the Import Session dialog box, go through the Source Tracks list
and click the name of each track you want to import.
To select multiple noncontiguous tracks, press and hold Ctrl (on a PC)
or Command (on a Mac) as you click the track names. To select multiple
contiguous tracks, press and hold Shift as you click the names.
5. From the drop-down menus, choose your Audio Media and Video
Media, Timecode Mapping, and Track Offset options.
See the previous section, “Understanding the Import Session Data dialog
box,” for more on how to use these options.
6. If the sample rate of your new session is different from the sample
rate of the session you’re importing from, you need to first convert it
to the target session’s rate before you can import it. Do this by select-
ing the sample rate of the source session from the Source Sample Rate
drop-down menu and choosing a conversion quality.
You find this drop-down menu in the Sample Rate Conversion Options
section of the Import Session Data dialog box.
7. If you want to import meter and tempo maps from the source session,
click to put a check in the Import Tempo/Meter Map check box.
Importing these maps ensures that the target session will have the same
meter and tempo as the source session.
8. Click OK.
9. If you chose to copy audio or video media — or consolidate data from
them — select a location to place the media files.
Exporting from a Session
Pro Tools lets you export audio, MIDI, and region data from one session to
another. This is handy if you want to take parts of a song and add them to
parts of another song, as in the case of an R&B remix of a pop tune. This
section describes the process.
Exporting audio
Pro Tools gives you several ways to export audio — as regions, as stereo
interleaved files, or as region definitions, depending on what you want to
do with it. Here a rundown on these options (and what the heck these
terms mean): 
✦Export Audio Regions as Files: This lets you take a region in your track
and export it as its own audio file that you can then use in another ses-
sion. This is great for making separate audio files of drum loops, for
example, if you’re ready to place them in your mix.

Book II
Chapter 5
Importing and
Exporting Files
Exporting from a Session
209
✦Export as Interleaved Stereo Files: This lets you take the regions from a
stereo track or two regions from two mono tracks and save them as a
single interleaved stereo file. (Interleaved stereo files are the type that
many other programs create when doing a stereo mix.)
✦Export Region Definitions: This lets you export the information that
defines the region. Doing this keeps you from having to make a copy
of the audio (saves hard drive space) while still being able to use the
region in a new session. (Pro Tools uses the original audio file so you
don’t have two in your system.)
Exporting regions
Since regions are only portions of the audio in an audio file, Pro Tools lets
you take this portion and make a separate file containing just this audio
data. Exporting regions allows you to take a lovingly crafted musical element
(a killer drum loop, for example) and use it in another session or application
without having to re-create it from the parent audio file.
To export a region as a new audio file, follow these steps:
1. Select the region(s) one of two ways:
• From the Audio Regions list (located on the right side of the Edit
window): Select the region(s) you want to export by clicking the
region’s name. To select more than one region, hold the Shift key as
you click each region’s name. (If the list isn’t visible, click the double
arrows at the bottom left of the Edit window to call it up.)
• From the Track playlist in the Edit window: Click anywhere on the
region to select it. To select more than one region, hold the Shift key
as you make your selections.
2. Choose Export Selected as Files from the Audio Regions pop-up menu —
the menu you open by click-holding the Audio Regions name at the top
of the Audio Regions list.
The Export Selection dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 5-5.
3. Choose the export settings you want for your new file. 
You have the following settings to deal with:
• File type: Choose the file type of the session you want to use this file
in. If you’re not sure where you’re going to use the file, choose either
BWF or AIFF.
• Format: Your choices here are Multiple Mono or Stereo. Choose the
format appropriate for your file. If your drum loop, for example, is in
stereo and has panning information, you’ll want to select Stereo.

Exporting from a Session
210
• Bit Depth: You can choose from 8, 16, and 24 bits. I recommend
selecting the same bit depth as your current session.
• Sample Rate: You choices include 44.1, 48, 88.2, 96, and 192kHz. Choose
the sample rate of the session you want to put this file into. If you’re not
sure, select the same rate as your current session. 
4. Select a destination for the file in the Destination Directory field by
clicking the Choose button and following the prompt.
5. Select from the Resolve Duplicate File Names By options. These
options are:
• Prompting for Each Duplicate: This stops the exporting process and
lets you know when Pro Tools finds a duplicate file name. You can
then choose to either replace the original or create a new name.
• Auto Renaming: You authorize Pro Tools to automatically create a
new name for these files. This is the best option to choose if you
don’t want to have to answer a prompt for each duplicate file name
and you want to make sure that your original files aren’t replaced.
• Replacing with New Files: This option replaces any existing files
containing the same name with your newly exported ones. This is
the option to take if you’re sure that you don’t ever want the original
files bearing the same name.

6. Click Export.
Your new file is created and saved to the destination you chose in the
Destination Directory field of the Export Selected dialog box.
Exporting stereo-interleaved files
A stereo-interleaved file is a single audio file with all the stereo data con-
tained in them. These types of stereo files are different than the ones used in
Pro Tools, which consist of two separate audio files for stereo (one contains
the left channel data and the other contains the right channel data).
Although Pro Tools doesn’t support stereo-interleaved file types, you can
export regions from within your session as a single, stereo-interleaved file.
This is an important feature because many other audio applications — such
as mastering programs — use stereo-interleaved files instead of the separate
ones that Pro Tools favors. 
To export a region as a stereo-interleaved file, do the following:
1. Select either a stereo region or two mono regions one of two ways:
• From the Audio Regions list (located on the right side of the Edit
window): Click the name of the region to highlight it. To select two
mono regions, hold the Shift key as you click each region’s name.
• From the track playlist in the Edit window: Click anywhere on the
region within the track to highlight it. For more than one mono
region, hold the Shift key as you click each region. 
2. Choose Export Selected as Files from the Audio Regions list pop-up
menu — the menu you opened by click-holding the Audio Regions
name at the top of the Audio Regions list. 
The Export Selected dialog box opens. (Refer to Figure 5-5.)
3. Choose Interleaved from the Format drop-down menu in the Export
Selected dialog box.
4. Choose the rest of your settings for this file.
Check out the previous section, “Exporting regions,” for tips on what 
settings to choose here.
5. Click Export.
Your file is created and saved on your hard drive so you can use it in an
application that supports stereo-interleaved files.

Exporting from a Session
212
Exporting region definitions
Region definitions are the information that Pro Tools uses to define the loca-
tion, start, and end times of a region within the parent audio file. If you’ve
come up with some Pro Tools regions that you want to use in another ses-
sion (or some other application that supports Pro Tools regions data), you
can export region definitions from your session without having to copy the
region as an audio file. In effect, all you save using this command are the
pointers that make up the region definition: The definition points to the
parent file and not the audio itself.
If you actually want to use a region definition in another session or applica-
tion, make sure that the region’s parent audio file still exists on the hard
drive. A definition that points to nothing is no help.
To export region definitions, follow these steps:
1. Select the regions you want to export the region definitions for. This
can be done one of two ways:
• From the Audio Regions list (located in the right side of the Edit
window): Select the region(s) you want to export by clicking the
region’s name. To select more than one region hold the Shift key as
you click each region’s name. (If the list isn’t visible, click the double
arrows at the bottom-left of the Edit window):
• From the Track playlist in the Edit window: Click anywhere on the
region to select it. To select more than one region, hold the Shift key
as you make your selections.
2. Choose Export Region Definitions from the Audio Regions list pop-up
menu — the menu you opened by click-holding the Audio Regions
name at the top of the Audio Regions list.
3. Click Export. 
The pointing data for the selected regions are exported.
Exporting MIDI
Ah, the miracle of MIDI — say you’ve laid down a kickin’ “keyboard” part on
guitar synth. How do you get it out of the current session? To export MIDI
data to another device or application, you need to save your MIDI tracks and
regions as a Standard MIDI file. You can save them as Type 0 files (a single
multichannel track) or as Type 1 files (multiple tracks).
To export MIDI tracks, follow these steps:
1. Mute any MIDI tracks you don’t want to include in the Export MIDI
procedure by depressing the Mute button for these tracks. 
Any muted tracks are excluded from the export function. 

Book II
Chapter 5
Importing and
Exporting Files

213
2. Choose File➪Export MIDI from the main menu. 
The MIDI Export dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 5-6.
3. Enter the name and location for this newly exported file.
4. Select either 0 for type 0 (single track) or 1 for type 1 (multiple track)
in the MIDI version field.
5. Press Save.
Your new MIDI file is created from all the unmuted MIDI tracks in your
session in the location you designated. This file includes all notes, con-
troller events, program changes, System Exclusive data (instructions
exclusive to the device), and tempo, meter, and marker events. SMPTE
time-code start time is also included so that your MIDI files will start at
their proper time when opened.
Managing Files
As soon as you start to record and edit your music, you start filling your
hard drive with data. Properly managing your data helps you keep your
system stable, lets you maximize your hard space, and protects you from the
worst disaster of them all — lost data. This section details three important
file-management tasks — compacting files, deleting files, and backing up
data — you should routinely do to keep everything running smoothly. 
Compacting files
Editing means cutting a snippet from here and taking the best chunk from
there and putting it altogether to make a — hopefully coherent — whole. 
It also means that, after you extract that great 15-second bit from that 
75-second clip, you’re going to have a lot of stuff cluttering up the virtual
cutting-room floor of your hard drive. What to do?

You can get rid of the clutter — the unused portions of the audio files in
your session — by using the Audio Regions list’s Compact Selected com-
mand. This command deletes any audio from a file in your session where
there are no regions referencing the data. It helps conserve disk space.
You’d generally use the Compact Selected command after you’ve done all the
editing in your session, because it permanently deletes the unused audio
data from the session. Don’t use this command until you’re sure that you
don’t want to use any of your data leftovers.
Compacting your audio files consists of three basic steps:
1. Select any unused regions in the session.
2. Clear these unused regions. These two steps (ahem) clear the way to
your final step:
3. Compact the files by removing the data for those cleared regions from
the parent files.
To compact an audio file, do the following:
1. Choose the Select Unused➪Regions option from the Audio Regions
List pop-up menu — the menu you opened by click-holding the Audio
Regions name at the top of the Audio Regions list. 
Any regions not used in a track in the current session become high-
lighted in the Audio Regions list.
2. Choose Clear Selected from the Audio Regions List pop-up menu to
remove the unused regions.
The Clear Audio dialog box appears.
3. Click Remove.
This removes the unused regions from your session.
4. Select the region(s) you want to compact from the Audio Regions list
by clicking the Region’s name. 
To select more than one region, hold the Shift key as you click each
region’s name.
5. Choose Compact Selected from the Audio Regions List pop-up menu —
the menu you opened by click-holding the Audio Regions name at the
top of the Audio Regions list.
The Compact dialog box appears. This box contains a warning about the
consequences of compacting a file (read the Warning icon earlier in this
section) as a reminder that this is an irreversible process.

Chapter 5

Exporting Files

6. If you have crossfades in the selected region(s), enter the amount of
padding (in milliseconds) that you want to put around each selected
region.
Padding adds space before and after your regions to account for any
crossfades (Book 4, Chapter 4). Choose a pad length equal to (at least)
to longest crossfade length for your selected regions.
7. Click the Compact button, located at the bottom of the Compact Audio
dialog box.
Your file is compacted and the session is saved.
Deleting unwanted files
As with any creative process, what you end up with (in addition to your
knockout musical creation) is leftover junk that just takes up space. You can
delete unwanted files in your session from your hard drive by using the Clear
Selected command located under the Audio Regions list pop-up menu (opened
by click-holding the Audio Regions name at the top of the Audio Regions list).
Less unused data on your hard drive means more space for the good stuff.
To delete an audio file, do the following:
1. Select the audio files you want to delete from the Audio Regions list. 
The audio files are listed in bold letters in the Audio Regions list.
2. From the Audio Regions list pop-up menu (opened by click-holding
the Audio Regions name at the top of the Audio Regions list), choose
Clear Selected.
The Clear Audio dialog box appears. You have the option of Remove
(which you use before compacting a file — see previous section) and
Delete. This is the one you want for this procedure.
3. Click the Delete button in the Clear Audio dialog box. 
Your file is permanently deleted from your hard drive.
The Clear Selected command is irreversible. Once you click Delete, your
data is gone forever. If you think you might want the data someday, choose
Remove from the Clear Audio dialog box. Your file is removed from the ses-
sion but not from your hard drive.
Backing up data
There’s a saying in the computer world: If the data doesn’t exist in more than
two places, it doesn’t exist. I know I said this before (Book 2, Chapter 2, to
be precise), but I think it bears repeating. As someone who lost an entire

Managing Files
216
project’s worth of data because I “forgot” to back up my files, I strongly
encourage you to make a habit of backing up your sessions.
Backing up your files to the same hard drive does you no good if your drive
shuts down (a common occurrence). Always back-up to a different hard drive
or to another medium, such as DVD-R (check out the manual for your DVD
burner for steps on how to do this).
To back up your session files to another hard drive, do the following:
1. Create a new folder on a different hard drive than your session and
call it Back Ups. 
2. Choose File➪Save Session Copy In from the main menu. 
The Save Session Copy In dialog box appears.
3. Use the File Browser section of the dialog box to select the folder you
created in Step 1 as the destination for your backup files.
4. Enter a name for your backup in the Save As field of the Save Session
Copy In dialog box. 
Since this copy exists on a whole different hard drive, I can use the same
name as that of my original session — and if it’s an exact duplicate, I do.
This is important because if, for some reason, the original files are lost
all you have to do is drag the backed-up files onto your audio drive and
get to work. Using a different name means you have to rename or import
all your files before you can use them. 
5. Under the Items to Copy box, select All Audio files as well as any other
setting you want to save such as plug-in settings or movie/video files.
6. Click Save.
The files you selected are backed up to the destination you specified in
Step 3.
You can also back up your files by clicking and dragging the folder contain-
ing your session and audio files from one hard drive to another on your com-
puter’s desktop.

 Understanding track views

B
efore you can do any recording in Pro Tools, you need to create and
configure some tracks — specific places to put the vocals, instrumental
parts, pterodactyl screeches, whatever. This involves setting up new tracks,
naming the tracks, and assigning inputs and outputs to your newly created
and named tracks.
But that’s not all. When working with tracks in Pro Tools, you also need to
know how to show and hide them, activate and deactivate them, solo them,
mute them, and adjust your view of them, among other things. This chapter
takes the mystery out of dealing with tracks and shows you how to work
with them both efficiently and effectively.
Understanding Tracks in Pro Tools
Pro Tools has four types of tracks — Audio, Auxiliary Input, Master Fader,
MIDI — and two track formats — mono and stereo. All possible permuta-
tions and combinations of these various types and formats are explained
(with subtlety and style) in this section.
Track types
When you work with tracks in Pro Tools, you have to keep in mind that
you’re sure to end up dealing with four distinct flavors of tracks. They are
✦Audio Tracks: An audio track contains audio files and can be either
mono or stereo.
✦Auxiliary Input Tracks: These tracks are used as effects sends, for sub-
mixes, or for other routing purposes.
✦Master Fader Tracks: This track type contains the summed output for
all the tracks routed to it. Master Fader tracks can be either mono or
stereo, although stereo is most common.

Setting Up Tracks
220
✦MIDI Tracks: MIDI tracks contain MIDI data — instructions to MIDI
devices on how to create specific digital sounds. (For more on MIDI
check out Book 1, Chapter 5 and for more on MIDI tracks, go to Book 5.)
These tracks are only available in mono.
Track formats
You’ll find that Pro Tools offers a bit less variety when it comes to track for-
mats. You get two — count ’em, two — choices: 
✦Mono: A mono (monaural) track consists of a single channel of audio or
MIDI data. It uses — as its name implies — just one voice. 
✦Stereo: A stereo (stereophonic) track consists of two channels of audio
and uses two voices. A MIDI track can’t be stereo.
Setting Up Tracks
Setting up your recording project is a little like setting up a railroad: It’ll only
take you somewhere if you’ve already put the tracks in place. Getting that
done is what this section is about.
Creating new tracks
To create a new track, you can either choose File➪New Track from the main
menu or press Command+Shift+N on a Mac (or Ctrl+Shift+N on a PC). Either
method opens the New Track dialog box (shown in Figure 1-1), where you
get to choose the following:
✦Number of new tracks: The default here is 1 but you can pretty much
create as many new tracks as you like. Just keep in mind that you can
only have 32 voices playing at one time in your session.
✦Track format: Here you choose stereo or mono.
✦Track type: Clicking the arrows opens a menu that lets you choose
between an Audio, Auxiliary Input, Master Fader, or MIDI track. 
Make your selections and click Create to create your new track. This track
then appears in the Edit and Mix windows and in the Show/Hide list located
on the right side of the Edit window. If the Show/Hide list isn’t visible, click
the double arrow at the lower-left corner of the Edit window.

Duplicating tracks
You can duplicate tracks — creating a new track that mirrors all the input,
output, effects send settings, and insert settings of your original track — in
two easy steps:
1. Click the name of the track in the Mix or Edit windows. To select more
than one track to duplicate, hold the Shift key as you click each
track’s name.
The name is highlighted. 
2. Choose File➪Duplicate from the main menu. 
The new track will appear in the Mix and Edit windows to the right of
the track you’re duplicating and just below the duplicated track in the
Show/Hide list.
Naming tracks
When you open a new track (select File➪New Track), Pro Tools creates a
default name for the track — something really helpful like Audio 1 — but you
can change the name to anything you want. You do this by double-clicking
the name of the track in either the Mix or Edit window. A dialog box similar
to what you see in Figure 1-2 will open and you’ll be able to use the fields to
both change the name of the track as well as add any comments you may
want to include about the track. Once you enter your track name and com-
ments, click OK and you’re set.

Assigning inputs and outputs
In order to record with your new track, you need to assign an input to it so
Pro Tools knows where your source sound is coming from. In order to hear
the track play, you need to choose an output so Pro Tools can send the
sound out to your monitors or to your headphone jack. 
That makes sense, right? Now, to actually assign an input to your track, do
the following:
1. Choose Display➪Edit Window Shows➪I/O View from the main menu
to open the I/O section of the Edit window.
The I/O section shows the inputs and outputs for each track.
2. Within the I/O section of your track in the Edit window, click and hold
the Input selector (see Figure 1-3) until the Input contextual menu
pops up.
3. While still holding down your mouse button, move the mouse over the
Input menu until it rests on the input listing you want. 
4. Release the mouse button to select your choice from the Input contex-
tual menu.
This menu closes and the input you’ve selected appears in the Input
selector.
Choosing your outputs requires pretty much the same procedure, although
now you start things off by clicking the Output selector instead.

Altering Your View of Tracks
Pro Tools gives you lots of options to change the way tracks look in the Mix
and Edit windows. You can change a track’s color, size, location, and even
whether you can see it or not. This section gets you up to speed on these
options.
Showing and hiding tracks
Both the Edit and Mix windows have the option of including an audio tracks
list in the window view (Figure 1-4). In this list, called the Show/Hide Tracks
list, you can show or hide selected tracks or groups of tracks. This list is
located on the left side of either window. If it’s not visible, click the double
arrows at the bottom left side of either window to open it in that window.
You can show and hide tracks one of two ways:
✦Use the pop-up menu. Click and hold the title bar of the Show/Hide
Tracks list until a contextual menu opens up, as shown in Figure 1-5, and
then just choose the option you want. 
Keep in mind that the Show Only Selected Tracks option and the Hide
Selected Tracks option require that you first highlight your desired
tracks in the main part of the Edit or Mix windows. To select one track,
just click the track’s name. To select more than one track, hold down the
Shift key while clicking each track you want. When you then use the
Show Only Selected option, for example, all tracks that are not high-
lighted will be hidden.
✦Click the track name in the Show/Hide Tracks list. Clicking directly on
the track name located in the Show/Hide Tracks list toggles between
hiding and showing the track. You can even move the tracks around by
click-dragging it to where you want it in relation to the others.

If the Show/Hide Tracks list is not showing, click the double arrow at the
bottom-left corner of the window to open it (Figure 1-6).
You can also use the Show/Hide Tracks list pop-up menu to sort tracks by
name, type, edit group, mix group, or voice, as shown in Figure 1-7. This
menu is opened by click-holding the Show/Hide Tracks list title.

Assigning track color
To make all your tracks easier to keep track of when you’re working, you
can assign color groups to the waveform display for each track in the Edit
window. To do this, choose Setups➪Preferences from the main menu and
then select the Display tab in the Preferences dialog box. This opens the
window shown in Figure 1-8.

In the middle of this window is a box called Edit Window Color Coding. You
can choose from several options:
✦None: Makes the display for all the tracks the same color.
✦Tracks and MIDI channels: Assigns colors to each waveform display
based upon the audio track number and the MIDI channels assigned for
each MIDI track. 
✦Tracks and MIDI devices: Bases colors for the waveform display on the
audio track number and the MIDI device used.
✦Groups: Colors the waveform display for your tracks according to a
track’s group membership.
Changing track size
You can alter the viewed size of tracks in both the Edit or Mix windows. This
can be a godsend, for example, when you have a ton of tracks in a session
and you want to see them all on the screen (pick a small size) or if you have
a track that you want to edit on (choose a giant size one). Here are your
options:
✦Edit Window: The Edit window allows you to choose from several
different-size track views. Your options include: Mini, Small, Medium,
Large, Jumbo, and Extreme. You access these options by clicking the
track height selector or the ruler bar at the far left side of the waveform
display of the track, as shown in Figure 1-9.
✦Mix Window: In the Mix window, you can toggle between Regular and
Narrow channel strip views by choosing Display➪Narrow Mix Window
or Display➪Regular Mix Window from the main menu, as shown in
Figure 1-10. Pressing Shift+Command M on your Mac’s keyboard 
(or Shift+Control on a PC) also toggles between the two views.

Moving tracks around
You can move tracks around and arrange them in your Mix or Edit window
as you want them. This feature is handy if you have a group of tracks that
you want to have next to each other, such as percussion and drums. I place
any submixed tracks together to help me keep track (sorry, I couldn’t help
myself) of them all without having to move all over the Edit or Mix windows.
The following steps show you how to do this:
1. Locate the name of the track you’d like to move in the Show/Hide list,
as shown in Figure 1-11.
2. Using your mouse, click the track name and then drag the track up or
down to where you want it.
3. Release the mouse.
The track stays put where you dragged it.
Moving the track around in one window will change its location in the other.

228
Deleting tracks
To delete a track, follow these steps:
1. Select the track by clicking its name in either the Edit or Mix window.
2. Choose File➪Delete Selected Tracks from the main menu.
3. Click OK.
Grouping Tracks
In Pro Tools, it’s a snap to create and manage groups of tracks. I strongly
recommend taking advantage of Pro Tools grouping features, since they let
you perform lots of different tasks — edits, for example — on more than
one track at a time. 
Keeping track of grouped track parameters
When tracks are grouped, certain parameters become linked. These include
✦Automation modes
✦Editing functions 
✦Mutes
✦Send mutes
✦Send levels
✦Solos
✦Track view
✦Track height
✦Volume levels
That’s a lot of parameters, but don’t let this long list fool you into thinking
that grouping links up everything associated with your tracks. Some param-
eters are not linked when you use the grouping feature, including
✦Creating plug-in instances
✦Output assignments
✦Panning
✦Record enables
✦Send panning
✦Voice assignments

Book III
Chapter 1
Taking Care

229
Having these parameters independent when tracks are grouped is nice
because many times these parameters vary from track to track. For example,
you don’t want the same plug-ins on all your drum tracks or the same pan-
ning setting on all backup vocal tracks (both of these are great candidates
for grouping).
Creating groups
You can create groups by following these steps:
1. In either the Edit window or the Mix window, shift-click the tracks you
want in your group.
It doesn’t matter which window you use as your starting point here.
Whatever groups are created in one window automatically get created in
the other window.
2. Choose File➪Group Selected Tracks from the main menu — or New
Group from the Group pop-up menu — the menu you opened by
click-holding the Group title in the Groups list section of the Edit 
or Mix window. 
The New Group dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 1-12.
3. Enter a name for your group in Name for Group field.
4. Use the Group Type drop-down menu to choose which window(s) will
show your new group.
Your choices here are Edit (when you want the group listed just in the
Edit window), Mix (when you want the group listed just in the Mix
window), and Edit and Mix (when you want your group listed in both
windows).
5. Choose a group ID from the drop-down menu. 
The Group ID is a single letter that defines your group. This lets you see
which group a track is in at a glance. (The Group ID for a track is located
beneath the track’s level meters in the mix window.)
6. Click OK. 
The New Group dialog box closes and your new group appears in the
Edit, Mix, or Edit and Mix windows (depending on your choice in Step 4).
If a track in a group is hidden in the Show/Hide Tracks list, that track won’t
be affected by edits done to that group. All mix operations — with the
notable exception of Record Enable — do apply to hidden tracks, though.

Grouping Tracks
230
Enabling groups
Before you can work with grouped tracks, you need to enable the group,
which you do by clicking the group name in the Groups list. (You’ll find the
Edit Groups list in the lower-left side of the Edit window; the Mix Groups list
is in the lower-left side of the Mix window. If they aren’t visible, click on the
double arrow at the bottom-left corner of the Mix or Edit window, respec-
tively.) Highlighting in blue means the group is enabled. Click the group
again to disable it. The blue highlight will disappear.
You can also enable and disable groups using a keystroke on your keyboard
in the Mix window by simply pressing the key for the group ID. To do the
same thing in the Edit window, you need to first make sure that the
Commands Focus (A-Z) button to the right of the Edit Groups name is high-
lighted, as shown in Figure 1-13. (How will you know that it’s highlighted?
That’s easy. In its highlighted state, a blue border surrounds the box.) 
Editing groups
Once you’ve set up some groups, you don’t have to treat them as if they
were set in stone. You can add — or subtract — members to the group, you
can change the group name, or you can just delete the group altogether.
These options are covered in this section.

Renaming a group
Follow these steps to rename a group:
1. Double-click the area to the left of the group name in the Groups list. 
The New Group dialog box reappears.
The Edit Groups list is located in the lower-left side of the Edit window;
the Mix Groups list is in the lower-left side of the Mix window. If they
aren’t visible, click the double arrow at the bottom-left corner of the Mix
or Edit window, respectively. 
2. Type in your new name in the Name for Group box.
3. Click OK.
Your group gets a spanking new name.
Adding a track to a group
You can add a track to an existing group by doing the following:
1. Shift+click the track name of the track(s) you want to add to a group.
2. Choose File➪Group Selected Tracks from the main menu or press
Command+G. 
The New Group dialog box appears.
3. Select the Group ID of the existing group you want to serve as the
selected track’(s) new home. 
4. Click OK.
The selected tracks are added to the groups whose Group ID you specify
in Step 3.
Deleting groups
You can delete unwanted groups by doing the following:
1. Click the name of the group in the Groups list.
Again, you find the Edit Groups list in the lower-left side of the Edit
window, and the Mix Groups list in the lower-left side of the Mix window.
If they aren’t visible, click the double arrow at the bottom-left corner of
the Mix or Edit window, respectively.

232
2. Click the Groups pop-up menu (opened by click-holding the Group
title in the Groups list section of the Edit or Mix window) and select
Delete Group.
Your group is history.
Linking edit and mix groups
When you create a new group, you have the option of making that group an
Edit group, a Mix group, or a combination Edit/Mix group. Regardless of
which option you choose, by default functions done in either the Edit or Mix
windows will affect groups in both. For example, if you have a drum group in
your Mix window consisting of kick, snare, toms, and overheads and you
want to edit a bad note out the snare drum in the Edit window, you end up
editing not only the snare drum note but also the audio from the other mem-
bers of the drum group you assigned in the Mix window.
This may be what you want most of the time, but there may be situations
where you don’t want the default — where Edit or Mix functions affect entire
groups. The way to get around this is to disable the Link Edit and Mix
Groups option in the Preferences menu. Do so by following these steps:
1. Choose Setups➪Preferences from the main menu.
The Preferences dialog box appears.
2. Choose the Operation tab in the Preferences dialog box.
You get a screen that looks like Figure 1-14.
3. Deselect the Link Mix and Edit Group Enables option.
You can find the option near the top of the right column of choices.

Soloing and Muting
Soling and muting tracks is a big part of the mix process. By being able to
hear only those tracks you want to hear at a given time, you can find
unwanted sounds lurking in your tracks by soloing the suspected track or
you can turn off the lead vocal when you tweak the backup vocals. You can
solo and mute each track in the Edit window by clicking the Solo or Mute
button located underneath the track name, as on the left side of Figure 1-15.
You can do the same thing in the Mix window by clicking the Solo and Mute
buttons located above the volume fader, as on the right side of Figure 1-15.
Check out Book 3, Chapter 4 for more on these windows and the location of
the Solo and Mute buttons. 
Soloing a track turns the mute function on for the rest of the tracks. You can
solo and mute more than one track at a time. Choose the appropriate button
for each track.
Managing Track Voices
Pro Tools has 32 available voices. This means that you can only have 32 dif-
ferent mono tracks playing or recording at one time. (With stereo, you can
only have 16 tracks, because each stereo track uses two voices.) Since it
isn’t that uncommon to have more than 32 tracks in a session, you need
ways to manage the 32 available voices so you can hear all your tracks (or at
least the important ones). This can be done one of two ways: by setting
voice assignments for each track, and by setting voice priority. The next two 
sections give you the skinny on each method.

Assigning voices
In Pro Tools, the controls for each track let you choose between Off and
Auto for voice assignments. Figure 1-16 shows the Voice Assignment menu in
the Edit (left) and Mix (right) windows. With a tracks voice assignment set to
Off, the track won’t play. If you have the track’s voice set to Auto, Pro Tools
automatically turns that track on and off according to how many voices are
available for playback and where this particular track sits in the Voice
Priority listing. (See the next section for more on voice priorities.)
For example, if you have a session containing 33 tracks, only 32 will play at
any one time. Now, if you have one track (rhythm guitar) that only plays
during the verse and another track (lead guitar) that only plays during the
chorus, you can get these two tracks to trade off so only one at a time uses
the available voice amongst the 32 — and everybody’s happy because every
note recorded will get heard.
Imagine, though, that both guitar parts have to play in the bridge section of
the song. In this game of musical chairs, one part won’t find one of the 32
available “slots” — and won’t play. Which part ends up being silenced is
determined by how high up the part sits in the list of tracks. You can choose
how high by setting the voice priority of each track, something I cover in the
next section.
Setting voice priority
Since Pro Tools only allows you to play 32 voices but lets you have more
tracks than that in your session, you may need to do some finagling among
the available voices if you want every track (or at least the most important
ones) to be heard throughout the song. To pull off this trick, you have to set
the voice priority of each track.

the voice
assignment
for each
track in the

windows.

Book III
Chapter 1
Taking Care

Managing Track Voices
235
Voice priority is determined by the track’s position in the tracks list in the
Edit and Mix windows — the higher its place in the list, the higher its prior-
ity for voice assignment. You can increase the voice priority of a track the
following ways:
✦Using the Show/Hide Tracks List: Click and hold with the pointer over
the track you want, and drag that track up the list.
✦Using the Edit Window: Click and drag the name of the track up the list.
✦Using the Mix Window: Click and drag the name of the track to the left
on the list.
The higher up the list a track is, the higher its priority and the stronger its
claim on the available voices when you assign voices.
Freeing up a voice from a track
Since you can’t make every track the highest priority, there is another way to
free up (or at least control) how your available voices get used. If you can
identify a voice that’s less crucial at a given moment, you can free that voice
from a track by doing one of the following:
✦Turn the voice assignment to Off. You can do so by using the Voice
Assignment menu and choosing (logically enough) Off. (See the
“Assigning voices” section, earlier in this chapter, for more on the 
Voice Assignment menu.)
✦Deactivate the track by pressing Command+Ctrl on a Mac or
Ctrl+Start/Windows on a PC and clicking the name of the track you want
to deactivate. You can activate the track again by performing the same
command over again, which toggles the track back on.
✦Turn off any output or send assignments for that track.

 Miking drums
 Miking amplified instruments
 Miking acoustic instruments
You can you do all the right things to get your Pro Tools software ready
to record tracks — see Book 3, Chapter 1 for more on that topic — but
it won’t mean diddly if you don’t know how to set up your mics properly. 
As you’ll soon find out, the location of a microphone in relation to your
instrument or a singer has a huge impact on the sound of your recording. In
fact, just a movement of an inch or two or even a slight turn of the mic can
bring out different characteristics in the sound. The art of placing mics is
one that you will undoubtedly spend a lifetime discovering.
In this chapter, you discover the fundamentals of using microphones to get
a good source sound. You explore tried-and-true miking methods along with
some practical miking tips and tricks that you can use right away. You also
examine the use of compression and mic placement to control and eliminate
transients — the usual peaks in the instrument’s sound.
Tracing Typical Microphone Techniques
Regardless of the style of microphone you use — or the type of instrument
you record — you can use one or more of the following mic-placement tech-
niques to capture the sound you want:
✦Spot (or close) miking: Put your microphone within inches of the sound
source.
✦Distant miking: Pull your mic back a few feet from the sound.
✦Ambient miking: Place your mic way back in a room.
✦Stereo miking: Set up two mics at various distances from one another.
✦Combining miking strategies: Use a combination of the four traditional
placement strategies listed here.

Tracing Typical Microphone Techniques
238
This section introduces you to the four traditional mic-placement strategies
employed in recording. You discover the characteristics and purposes of
each of these four methods and get a look at how each relates to a particular
tonal or sound quality. I also discuss how you can combine these strategies.
Spot
Spot miking (also called close miking) involves placing your microphone
within a couple of feet of the sound source. People with a home-recording
setup use this technique most often because it adds little of the room (the
reverb and delay) to the recorded sound. Figure 2-1 shows the close miking
placement.
With spot miking, where you place the mic is much more crucial than it is
with any other technique. Because the mic is so close to the sound source,
small adjustments to the mic’s placement make a noticeable difference, and
the mic may not capture the complete sound of the instrument. Finding the
spot that sounds the best may take some trial and error.

Chapter 2

Tracing Typical Microphone Techniques
239
Distant
When you use distant miking, you place mics about 3 or 4 feet away from the
sound source. (See Figure 2-2.) Distant miking enables you to capture some
of the sound of the room along with the instrument. An example of a distant-
miking technique is the overhead drum mic. With it, you can pick up the
whole drum set to some extent. Coupled with a few select spot mics, you can
record a natural sound.
Ambient
Ambient miking is simply placing the mic far enough away from the sound
source so you capture more of the room sound (the reverb and delay) than
the sound of the actual instrument. (See Figure 2-3.) You may place the mic a
couple of feet away from the source but pointed in the opposite direction, or
you may place it across the room. You can even put the mic in an adjacent
room, although this is an unorthodox technique, I’ll admit. The distance that
you choose varies from instrument to instrument.
Ambient mic placement works well in those places where the room adds to
the sound of the instrument (home recordists sometimes use stairwells,
bathrooms, or rooms with wood paneling to liven up the sound). The sound
you record is ambient (hence the name) — that is, steeped in the sonic qual-
ities of the surroundings. If you mix this in with a spot mic, you can end up
with a natural reverb. If your room doesn’t add to the sound of the instru-
ment, you’re better off not using any ambient mics. You can always add a
room sound by using effects in the mixing process. (See Book 6, Chapter 5
for more on using effects.)

Stereo
Stereo miking involves using two mics to capture the stereo field of the
instrument. There are a variety of stereo miking techniques and some pretty
complicated ways of using two mics to record. The three most common
approaches, however, are X-Y (coincident) pairs, the Blumlein technique,
and spaced pairs. You can also find stereo mics that — on their own — do a
good job of capturing the stereo field of an instrument.
Stereo miking has the advantage of capturing a natural stereo image. When
you listen to performances that were recorded with well-placed stereo

miking, you can hear exactly where on the stage each instrument performed.
Of course, there is an art to such wonderful stereo miking. You can’t just set
up a couple of mics in a room and get a good stereo sound. Capturing a stereo
image with two mics requires some careful planning.
X-Y pairs
X-Y (also called coincident) stereo miking consists of using two mics placed
right next to each other so the diaphragms are at almost right angles (any
where from 90 to 135 degrees) as close together as possible without touch-
ing one another. X-Y stereo miking is the most-common type of stereo mic
setup and the one you’ll probably use if you end up doing any stereo miking.
Figure 2-4 shows a basic X-Y setup. Notice how the mics in this figure are
attached to a special mounting bracket. This bracket makes positioning the
mics easy.
Blumlein technique
The Blumlein technique is named after Alan Dower Blumlein, who patented
this approach in 1931. Blumlein stereo miking involves placing two figure-8
mics in much the same way as the X-Y pattern (at right angles to one
another with the diaphragms as close together as possible). The two mics
are mounted on separate stands, one above the other. The advantage with
this technique is that the figure-8 mics pick up signals from both the front
and back. This produces a very natural sound. You also don’t have to con-
tend with any proximity effects (enhanced bass response that comes from
being close to the sound source), because figure-8 mics don’t produce this
effect. Figure 2-5 shows this technique. (For more on figure-8 mics, see 
Book 1, Chapter 5.)
Figure 2-4:

Tracing Typical Microphone Techniques
242
Spaced pairs
Spaced-pair stereo miking involves placing two mics at a distance in front of
the instrument(s) you want to record and at a distance from one another.
This approach can work well if you record an ensemble that takes up a fairly
large amount of room. Figure 2-6 shows a top view of a typical spaced stereo
mic set-up.
One of the most important things to consider when you use spaced pairs for
stereo miking is that they can develop phase problems if you don’t space the
mics properly. For the most part, placing the mics three times further apart
than they are from the sound source takes care of phase problems. This is
called the 3:1 rule. (For more on phase problems, see the “Problems with
stereo miking” sidebar in this chapter.)
Stereo microphones
If you want to record an instrument in stereo and don’t want the hassle of
learning how to set up stereo pairs, you can use a stereo mic. Stereo mics
basically have two diaphragms in them and use a special cord that allows
you to record the output from each diaphragm on a separate track. Take a
look at an inexpensive stereo condenser mic in Figure 2-7.

Problems with stereo miking
When you do stereo miking, watch out for
phase cancellation and poor stereo imaging.
Phase cancellation happens when the two
microphones are placed in such a way that
each one receives the sound at a slightly dif-
ferent time. When this occurs, you don’t hear
the bass as well; the low frequencies drop off.
Improper mic placement — or two mics that
are out of phase with one another — can cause
phase cancellation.
Most digital recorders have a phase switch
that allows you to reverse the phase of the
signal. (Pro Tools lets you do this after it’s
recorded.) To test whether two mics are out of
phase, just reverse the phase on one mic (don’t
do both) and listen to see whether the low fre-
quencies become more apparent. If they do,
then you’ve corrected the problem and you’re
good to go. If this doesn’t correct the problem,
you can try changing cords on one of the mics
(some mic cords are wired differently from
others). If this doesn’t work either, then you
need to adjust the relationship between the two
mics. Just move one around a little and listen
for any changes in the bass response. When
the missing bass appears, you know you’ve
solved the problem.
You have a problem with poor stereo imaging if
you can’t tell clearly where the various instru-
ments or vocals show up from left to right 
(or right to left, if that’s the way you think), or
you can’t hear a clear center point in the sound.
Poor stereo imaging is a little more difficult to
correct than phase cancellation, but you can
fix it.
The solution depends on the stereo miking
technique you use. If you use the X-Y tech-
nique, you’ve probably placed your mics too
close to the sound source. If you use the
spaced-pairs technique, you’ve probably placed
the mics too close to one another in relation to
their distance from the instruments. In either
case, adjusting the placement of your mics
should clear up the problem.

Mic combinations
Many times, you’ll want to use more than one mic. The possible combinations
are almost limitless: You can use several spot mics on one instrument, you
can use a spot mic and an ambient mic, you can have a distant mic and a
spot mic, or . . . Well, you get my point. I don’t go into detail in this section,
but I do cover some great ideas (if I do say so myself) in “Setting Up Your
Mics: Some Suggestions,” later in this chapter.

Taming Transients
245
If you do end up doing multiple mic combinations, remember to listen for
any phase problems. Do a couple of run-throughs to get level and balance,
and try to correct phase troubles before you actually record the perform-
ance. Of course, since you’re using Pro Tools, you can deal with some phase
problems later. This is done one of two ways:
✦Use the Invert command located in the AudioSuites menu. (Choose
AudioSuites➪Invert from the main menu.)
✦Move your tracks around in your session to line up the waveforms. This
is called time aligning and is covered in Book 4, Chapter 3. 
Taming Transients
The single most difficult part of getting a good sound by using a microphone
is dealing with sudden, extreme increases in the sound signal. These blips
are called transients, and they happen when a drum is first struck, when a
vocalist sings certain syllables (for example, those that begin with P), and
when a guitar player picks certain notes. In fact, because you can’t always
control the amount of force that you apply to an instrument, transients can
happen any time — with any instrument — and without warning. (Highly
trained musicians produce fewer transients because they have a greater
mastery over their muscular movements.)
In digital recording, all it takes is one slight, unexpected note to cause clip-
ping and distortion, ruining what may be the perfect musical performance.
Believe me, nothing is so heart-wrenching as listening to the perfect take and
hearing the unmistakable sound of digital distortion. Although you can’t
eliminate transients completely (they are part of an instrument’s character),
you can tame the extreme transients that often cause digital overs (a thick
signal at too high a level, resulting in distortion). You can lash ’em down in
three ways:
✦Set your levels properly so the transients don’t overload the converters.
✦Make sure you have proper mic placement.
✦Run the signal through a compressor when recording. A compressor is a
piece of hardware (not included in your Digidesign interface) that con-
trols the dynamics of your signal to keep your levels from getting too
high.
Setting your levels properly
It used to be the case, back in the days of 16-bit digital recording (in ancient
times, oh, six years or so ago), that you wanted to record at as high a level
as possible without going over the maximum of 0dB. The idea was to ensure

Taming Transients
246
the highest-possible fidelity by using as many of the available 16 bits as
possible. If you recorded at lower levels, you used fewer bits — which
resulted in lower fidelity and higher noise levels.
Now, in the advanced age of digital (some six entire years later), your best
bet is to record with 24-bit resolution. Those extra 8 bits gained since the
olden days free you from having to record at the highest level possible. In
fact, you can put your max levels down around –12dB and still end up with
great-sounding tracks. Giving yourself that kind of room (called, logically
enough, headroom) allows an instrument’s transients to be recorded without
causing problems with your converters.
I highly recommend recording with peak levels no more than –12dB or
–10ddB, unless you run the incoming signal through a compressor before it
hits your converters. Sure, your tracks will be quieter, but you can deal with
that during mixing (Book 6, Chapter 1) and mastering (Book 7, Chapter 1).
Placing mics properly
A microphone that’s too close to a loud sound source (or pointed too
directly at the point of attack) can easily pick up extreme transients. In most
cases, all you have to do is to pull the mic away from the instrument a little
or turn it ever so slightly so it avoids picking up too high a signal. (I cover
mic setup thoroughly in the next section.)
The main thing to keep in mind when placing your microphones is to experi-
ment. Don’t be afraid to spend time making small adjustments. After all, the
track you save could be your own.
Compressing carefully
Compressors are processors that allow you to control the dynamics of a
signal — extremes of loudness or softness — and boy, are they ever versa-
tile. You can use them on the front end while tracking (recording) instru-
ments to ward off any stray transients. You can use them to level off an
erratic performance. And you can use them to raise the overall apparent
level of a mixed song. In this section, you explore the first use of compres-
sion: the control of transients. (You can find out about the other ways to use
compression in Book 6, Chapter 3, and in Book 7, Chapter 2.)
The compressor is an invaluable tool when you record digitally because it
enables you to record at high levels without worrying as much about digital
clipping. The only problem is that the careful use of compression is an art
that normally takes a while to get the hang of. Don’t worry, though. In this
chapter, you get some guidelines for using compression and in Book 6,
Chapter 4 I offer quite a few conservative compression settings for a variety
of instruments to get you started.

Pro Tools includes a compressor plug-in with the software program. You can
use this built-in compression if you’re tweaking a session you’ve already
recorded — for that matter, you can use this feature when you’re recording
your tracks, but that won’t do you any good. Remember that the Pro Tools
compression system is digital; it can’t work with analog signals. Your signal
has to go through the A/D converter (and get changed from analog to digital)
on its way to being recorded — and the A/D converter in your Digidesign
interface, not the compression plug-in, is first in line after the preamp. All of
which defeats the purpose of using a compressor to control transients.
(Bummer.) In fact, the A/D converter is usually where you often get your first
dose of distortion. (Ditto.) If you’re serious about using compression on the
front end to tame those transients, you may want to consider an external
preamp that you can insert into the signal chain before the A/D converter
(that is, before the signal gets to your Digidesign interface).
Compressors have a series of dials that allow you to adjust several param-
eters. They are
✦Threshold: This setting dictates the level at which the compressor
starts to act on the signal, listed in decibels (dB). For the most part, you
want to set the threshold level so the compressor acts on only the high-
est peaks of the signal.
✦Ratio: This setting determines the amount that the compressor affects
the signal. The ratio — such as 2:1, for instance — means that for every
decibel that the signal goes over the threshold setting, it is reduced by
two. In other words, if a signal goes 1dB over the threshold setting, its
output from the compressor will only be 1⁄2 dB louder. The ratio is the
one parameter that varies considerably from instrument to instrument
because the level of the transient varies.
✦Attack: This knob controls how soon the compressor starts, well, com-
pressing. The attack is defined in milliseconds (ms); the lower the
number, the faster the attack. For the most part, you’re trying to control
transients, and they happen at the beginning of a note. Therefore you
want the attack set to act quickly.
✦Release: This parameter controls how long the compressor continues to
affect the note after it starts. Like the attack, the release is defined in
milliseconds. Because transients don’t last very long, your best bet is
usually a short release time if you’re using compression on the front end.
✦Gain: This knob allows you to adjust the level of the signal going out of
the compressor. The setting is listed in decibels. Because adding com-
pression generally reduces the overall level of the sound, you use this
control to raise the level back up to where it was going in.
✦Hard knee or soft knee: Most compressors give you the option of
choosing one or the other of these odd-sounding settings (or they do 
it for you, based on the setting you’ve chosen). Both refer to how the
compressor behaves as the input signal passes the threshold: a hard

Setting Up Your Mics: Some Suggestions
248
knee applies the compression at an even rate, regardless of how far over
the threshold the level is. So if you choose a compression setting of 4:1,
the compressor applies this ratio for any signal over the threshold limit.
Hard-knee compression is used for instruments such as drums, where
you need to clamp down on any transients quickly.
The soft knee, by contrast, applies the compression at a varying rate
that depends on how far over the threshold setting the signal is. The
compressor gradually increases the ratio of the compression as the
signal crosses the threshold until the amount matches the level you set.
Soft-knee compression is used on vocals and on instruments where the
signal doesn’t have fast peaks.
Using compression is an art form. There is no one way to get the sound you
want. Although I go into detail on compression and offer some great com-
pressor settings for a variety of applications in Book 6, Chapter 4, there are a
couple of things you can keep in mind as you think about using compression
on your tracks:
✦You can always add compression to a recorded track, but you can
never take it away. If you’re not sure how much compression to apply
to a particular situation, you’re much better off erring on the side of too
little because you can always run the sound through another compres-
sor later if you need to. 
✦If you can hear a change in the sound of your signal, then you most
likely have it set too high. The reason to use a compressor on the front
end is to eliminate extreme transients, which you can’t hear when you
play anyway. If your compression setting changes the sound at all, then
you would want to turn it down slightly (unless you’re going for that
effect).
Setting Up Your Mics: Some Suggestions
When you start to record, you discover an almost infinite number of ways to
set up your mics. I can’t go into all of them here (as if I really knew all of
them anyway), but what I can do is share the miking approaches that I use
and have found to work for me. Okay, they’re not just my approaches;
they’re pretty common ways for miking a variety of instruments.
Telling you that a particular mic position will work for you is like telling you
that you’ll like a particular ice cream flavor. I don’t know your tastes, goals,
or specific recording conditions, so I can’t truly know what will work for you
beforehand. Think of the miking techniques in this chapter as a starting
point — and don’t be afraid to experiment until you find the sound you want.
There’s no absolute right or wrong when it comes to miking. There’s only
what works for you and what doesn’t. (Book 1, Chapter 5 talks more about
microphone types and how they’re used.)

Vocals
Regardless of the type of studio you have or the style of music that you
record, you’ll probably record vocals at some point. And unfortunately, vocals
are one of the most challenging instruments to do well. First, you have to find
the right mic for the person who’s singing, and then you need to try different
approaches in order to get the best sound out of him or her. Fortunately,
you’re in luck. In this section, I lead you through the (sometimes complicated)
process of getting good lead and backup vocal sounds.
The room and the vocals
To get the best recording of vocals possible, you need a dead room — a
room that has no reverberation. (Book 1, Chapter 2 has some tips on how to
deaden your room.) Recording vocals in a dead room gives a sense of “pres-
ence” and allows you to add compression to the vocals without making them
sound distant. (This is because the compressor raises the level of the back-
ground noise, particularly the reverberation from a live room that bounces
the sound around a lot.)
The easiest way to deaden your room for vocal recording is to hang up cur-
tains, carpet, or blankets around the room (or to use the absorbent side of
the reflector/absorber panels that I discuss in Book 1, Chapter 2). Try to
cover the area in front — and to both sides — of the vocal with sound-
absorbent materials. (If you use the reflector/absorber panels that I describe
in Book 1, Chapter 2, then you’d better use the stands; the panels are only 
4 feet tall.)
The mics and the vocals
You have a lot of options for miking vocals. The type of mic you use dictates
where you place it. Here’s the gist:
✦Dynamic mic: Dynamic mics sound best when you place them close to
the singer’s mouth. The effect that you get is gritty. (Huh? Okay, by
gritty, I mean dirty. That’s no help either? Let me see . . .)
Dynamic mics produce a midrange-dominated sound (the high frequen-
cies aren’t reproduced well). You’ll find that when a singer sings with the
mic right in front of his or her mouth, the sound lacks even more high
frequencies due to the proximity effect (close range enhances the low-
frequency response). What you get is a deep, bass-heavy sound that’s
often described as gritty or dirty. This type of sound can be great for
matching the mood of some styles of rock and blues music.
To set up a dynamic mic for this purpose, just put it on a stand so the
singer can get his or her mouth right up against the windscreen. With
this type of singing style, I recommend a compressor setting that
“pumps and breathes.” (That is, you can hear the compressor working.

Setting Up Your Mics: Some Suggestions
250
See my discussion of compression in Book 6, Chapter 4 for a recom-
mended setting.)
✦Large-diaphragm condenser mic: Large-diaphragm condenser mics are
those most commonly used for vocals. These mics can clearly repro-
duce the entire audible frequency spectrum, emphasizing the low mids
slightly at the same time. What you get is a nice warm, full-bodied sound
(that sounds like I’m describing a wine). The proximity effect (how close
the singer is to the mic) determines how nice and warm-bodied the
sound is. The closer the singer is, the deeper and richer the tone can be.
When you set up a large-diaphragm condenser mic for vocals, place the
mic in such a way that the nasty sibilants (the sound from singing s and t
sounds) and pesky plosives (pops from singing p syllables) don’t mess
up your recordings. To deal with plosives and sibilants, you can either
use a pop filter (see Book 1, Chapter 2) or have the singer sing past
(instead of right into) the mic. If you want the singer to sing past the
mic, you can
• Place the mic above the singer and set it at an angle pointing away
from him or her (Figure 2-8, left).
• Set up the mic below the singer and angle it away from him or her
(Figure 2-8, right).
• Put the mic off to the side and face it toward the singer (Figure 2-8,
center), but not squarely in the path of the vocal. 
✦Small-diaphragm condenser mic: Small-diaphragm condenser mics
create a much brighter, airier sound than their large-diaphragm cousins.
You don’t get the low-mid warmth of the large-diaphragm beast, so the
small-diaphragm mic probably won’t be your first choice as a vocal 
mic — unless (for example) you’re recording a female vocalist with a
soprano voice and you want to catch the more ethereal quality of her
higher frequencies.

You set up the small-diaphragm mic in the same way you set up the large
diaphragm mic.
✦Ribbon mic: The ribbon mic is a good choice if you’re looking for an
intimate, crooner-type sound (think Frank Sinatra). The ribbon mic is
thought to add a silky sound to the singer’s voice — produced by a
slight dropoff in the high frequencies (not as severe as you’d get from a
dynamic mic). To my drum-abused ears, ribbon mics have a kind of soft-
ness that large-diaphragm condenser mics don’t have. The sound is
more even, without the pronounced low-mid effect.
If you use a ribbon mic, you can set it up in the same way you set up a
condenser mic. You just need to be more careful about singing directly
into a ribbon mic because the ribbon breaks if you sing, speak, or
breathe too hard into it.
Backup vocals
To record backup vocals, you can either track each part separately (using
the same mic-placement techniques that I describe earlier) or you can have
all the backup singers sing at once into one or two mics. If you go for the
latter method, you can either use a stereo pair of mics, a figure-8 mic, or an
omnidirectional mic.
If you use a stereo pair, I recommend setting them up in a coincident X-Y
pattern. Have the vocalists stand next to each other, facing the mics at a
distance of about 3 or 4 feet. Either large- or small-diaphragm mics work best
for this setup. Check out Figure 2-9 for a neat top view of this arrangement.

If you choose to use a figure-8 mic, then the singers can stand on opposite
sides of the mic (Figure 2-10). The advantage of this setup is that the singers
can look at each other while they sing, which helps keep the vocals tight.
An omnidirectional mic can also work well for backup vocals. In this case,
the singers stand in a circle around the mic, as shown in Figure 2-11.
Electric guitar
Miking your electric guitar is a personal thing. Every guitar player, it seems
to me (although I don’t play guitar, so what do I know?), spends an awful lot
of time getting his or her “sound.” If you’re a real guitar player, then you
undoubtedly take great pride in getting your sound exactly right on tape, er,
disc. You likely spend countless hours tweaking your amp and adjusting the
mic to get it just right. On the other hand, if you’re not a (harrumph) real
guitar player, you may just want to record the part and get it over with.
Either way, you can start looking for that perfect guitar sound by placing
your mics in one (or more) of the ways that I outline later in this chapter.
The room and the guitar
Whether you play through a small jazz chorus amp or power-chord your way
through a 6-foot-tall Marshall stack, the room that you play in has less
impact on your sound than it does if you play drums or sing. For the most
part, look for a room that is fairly dead — a room without natural reverbera-
tion. You can always add effects later.

Guitar miking involves mostly spot mics, so your only consideration when
recording a guitar and using an amp is how your neighbors feel about the
noise, er, your most excellent guitar playing.
If you have finicky neighbors, you can put your guitar amp inside an amp-
isolator box (see Book I, Chapter 2) to cut down on the noise. You can find
the plans to build one on my Web site, www.jeffstrong.com. (Or, hey, you
could try plugging the guitar directly into your Digidesign interface. You
might like the sound you get. More about that in a minute.)
The mics and the guitar
The type of mic you choose depends largely on the type of sound you’re
looking for. For example, if you’re looking for a distorted rock guitar sound
with effects, you can get by just fine with a dynamic mic. If you favor a
clean sound, a small-diaphragm condenser mic might work better for you. 
If you’re going for a warm, full-bodied sound, try using a large-diaphragm
condenser mic.
No matter which type of mic you use, you get the best sound from your amp
speakers by putting the mic about 2 to 12 inches away from the cabinet, with
the mic pointing directly at the cone of one of the amp speakers (specifically,
the center of the speaker, which is that cone-shaped thing in the box). You
can see this positioning in Figure 2-12.

You may want to experiment with how far the mic is from the amp and the
angle at which you point it. Sometimes just a slight movement in or out, left
or right, can make all the difference in the world. You can even try pointing
the mic at different speakers if your amp has more than one, because each
speaker has a slightly different sound.
For speaker cabinets that have more than one speaker, I know some engineers
who actually disconnect all but one speaker to lower the overall volume with-
out losing the intense, distorted sound. This can be especially beneficial if you
have one of those amp stacks with a volume knob that goes to 11, and you just
gotta crank the amp to get your “tone” (come on, rockers, you know who you
are). This way you don’t overdrive the mic (which creates the wrong kind of
distortion) and can still get that nasty sound you’re looking for.
If you can’t quite get the sound that you want from your amp with the one
mic pointed at the speaker cone, try adding a second mic about 3 or 4 feet
away — also pointed directly at the speaker cone — to get a more ambient
sound. This arrangement may also give your sound more life, especially if you
have a room with natural reverberation. If you add a second mic, however,
remember to watch for phase differences between the mics and make adjust-
ments accordingly. (I discuss phase cancellation earlier in this chapter.)

Are you sick of the same old sound coming out of your amp? Wanna really
shake things up (and I mean this literally)? Well, put your guitar amp in a
tiled bathroom and crank it up. You can put a mic in the bathroom with your
amp (a couple of feet away) and maybe another one just outside the door
(experiment with how much you close or open the door). The effect is, 
well . . . Try it and find out for yourself. 
Electric bass
When you mic an electric bass, getting a good sound can be a real bear. Your
two adversaries are muddiness (lack of definition) and thinness (a pronounced
midrange tone). These seem almost polar-opposite characteristics, but they
can both exist at the same time. I outline the best way to avoid these problems
in the following sections.
Running your bass guitar directly into the board — via a direct box, your
amp’s line-out jack, or a preamped input on your Digidesign interface —
gives the guitar a punchier sound. 
The room and the bass
The sound of an electric bass guitar can get muddy awfully fast. Your best
bet is to choose a room that doesn’t have a lot of reflective surfaces (such as
paneled walls and wooden floors) that bounce the sound around. A dead
room is easier to work with. Don’t make your room too dead, however, or it
just sucks the life out of your amp’s tone. If you can get your amp to sound
good in your room, placing the mic properly is easy.
Don’t be afraid to be creative and to try recording your bass in different
rooms. Look for a room with a warm sound to it. One thing, though — the
bathroom amp trick doesn’t work too well for a bass guitar (but it can be fun
to try anyway).
The mics and the bass
Because the bass guitar produces low frequencies, a dynamic mic or a large-
diaphragm condenser mic works well. I personally avoid small-diaphragm
condensers and ribbon mics for the electric bass, but try them if you want.
Who knows — you may end up with an awesome bass track.
Mic placement for the electric bass is similar to the guitar; you place a single
mic 2 to 12 inches away from one of the speakers. Sometimes, with bass, you
can angle the mic and let the speaker’s sound kind of drift past the diaphragm.
Potentially it’s a great sound. For a bass, skip the distant mic (which gener-
ally just adds muddiness to the sound).

Acoustic guitars and such
At the risk of offending banjo, dobro, or ukulele players, I’m lumping all gui-
tarlike (strummed or picked) acoustic string instruments together. I know,
they all sound and play differently, but the microphone-placement tech-
niques are similar for all these instruments. Allow me to explain.
Because all these instruments have a resonating chamber and are played
with the instrument facing forward, you can pretty much use the same mic
placement for any of them. You use different types of mics for different
instruments, and I get to that in a minute.
The room and the acoustic instruments
Because these are acoustic instruments, the room plays a role in the sound
that you end up recording. Unless you have a great-sounding room, you want
to minimize its impact on your instrument’s sound. You can do this in a
couple of ways — by recording with spot mics or by placing absorber/reflec-
tors in strategic places around your room — absorber-side-out (toward the
walls) if the room is too live, reflector-side-out if the room is too dead.
For example, if your studio resides in a spare bedroom with carpeting and
that awful popcorn stuff on the ceiling, then you can put a couple of the
reflector panels around your guitar player and the mic. This adds some
reverberation to your guitar. Any unwanted reflections from the ceiling or
walls are shielded from the mics because the absorber sides of the panels
are facing the rest of the room.
The mics and the acoustic instruments
I prefer to use condenser mics when recording acoustic instruments. The
type of condenser mic you use depends on the overall tonal quality that you
want to capture or emphasize. For example, if a guitar has a nice, woody
sound that you want to bring out in the recording, then a large-diaphragm
condenser mic is a good choice. On the other hand, if you’re trying to cap-
ture the brightness of a banjo, a small-diaphragm mic is a better choice.
You can position your microphone in a variety of ways, and each accents
certain aspects of the instrument’s sound. Even a slight adjustment to the
mic can have a significant impact on the sound. You may have to experiment
quite a bit to figure out exactly where to put a mic.
To help with your experimentation, listen to the guitar carefully and move
the mic around (closer in and farther out, to the left and right) until you find
a spot that sounds particularly good. You need to get your ears close to the
guitar to do this.

Book III
Chapter 2

Setting Up Your Mics: Some Suggestions
257
Here are some suggestions to get you started:
✦Put the mic about 6 to 18 inches away from and 3 to 4 inches below the
point where the neck meets the body of the guitar (or banjo, or what-
ever). Then make minor adjustments to the direction in which the mic
points. Pointing it toward the sound hole(s) often gives you a richer,
deeper tone. (This can translate to muddiness on some instruments.)
Turning the mic more toward the neck brings out the instrument’s
brighter qualities. (See the image on the left in Figure 2-13.)
✦Place a mic about 3 feet away from the instrument and point it directly
at the sound hole. At this distance, you capture the rich sound from 
the sound hole and the attack of the strings. See the center image in
Figure 2-13.
✦Put a mic about 6 inches out from the bridge of the guitar. Try pointing
the mic in different directions (slight movements of an inch or less can
make a huge difference) until you find the spot that sounds best to you.
See the image on the right in Figure 2-13.
✦Try setting up a mic at about the same distance and angle from the
instrument as the player’s ears. Point the mic down toward the instru-
ment so the mic is a couple of inches away from either side of the musi-
cian’s head. This is an unorthodox approach that I like because I’ve
found that guitar players adjust their playing style and intonation to cor-
respond to what they’re hearing when they play. With this technique,
you’re trying to capture exactly what the musician hears.
Drum set
If you’re like most musicians, getting great-sounding drums seems like one of
the world’s great mysteries. (You know, along the lines of how the pyramids
were built or how to cure cancer.) You can hear big, fat drums on great albums
but when you try to record your drums, they always end up sounding more
like cardboard boxes than drums. Fret not (hey, at least I didn’t say that in the
guitar section), for I have solutions for you.

First things first: Tuning your drums
The single most important part of getting killer drum sounds is to make sure
your drums are tuned properly and that they have good heads on them
(okay, that’s two things). Seriously, if you spend some time getting the drums
to sound good in your room, you’re already halfway to the drum sound of
your dreams. There isn’t space to go into detail here (especially if you play a
large kit), but if you want specific drum-tuning guidance, you can do a search
on the Internet or (ahem) check out a copy of my book, Drums For Dummies
(Wiley Publishing, Inc.).
You’re looking for a clear, open tone on your drums. By and large, resist the
temptation to apply duct tape or other dampeners to the drumheads. Drums
that are deadened and don’t ring clearly are definitely going to sound like
cardboard boxes when you record them.
What type of drum set?
If you want to buy a drum set for your studio,
here are some guidelines that have worked 
for me:
 Smaller drums can sound bigger. At one
point I had two top-notch Gretsch drum
sets in my studio. One was a rock kit that
had a 24-inch kick, 13-, 14-, and 12-inch
tom-toms; and a 61⁄2-inch deep metal snare
drum. The other was a small jazz kit, con-
sisting of a 12-inch kick, 10- and 14-inch
tom-toms, and a 5-inch-deep wood snare.
Guess what? Even for the hardest rock
music, the small kit sounded much bigger.
You tune the small drums down a bit and
they just sing!
 Choose your heads wisely. Not all heads
are equal. Some sound great on stage
while others are better suited for the studio.
Because the heads that come with a kit are
(most likely) not the ones that sound the
best on a recording, invest some money in
testing different drumheads on your kit. 
I prefer either Remo pinstripes (great for
rock and R&B) or coated ambassadors
(great for jazz) on the top and either clear
or coated ambassadors (either works, I just
choose what I like to look at) on the bottom
of the drum. 
 Use cymbals with a fast decay. Cymbals
that sound great on stage are different from
those that sound great in the studio. Stage
cymbals often have long decays and slow
attacks. This causes bleeding, especially
through the tom-tom mics, and correcting
the problem can be a headache. If you buy
cymbals for your studio, choose those that
have a very fast attack and a short decay. 
 More expensive isn’t always better. For
recording, my favorite drum sets are used
kits from the late ’60s and early ’70s. My all-
time favorite recording set is a late ’60s
Gretsch jazz drum set with a 12-inch kick
drum, a 10-inch mounted tom-tom, and a
14-inch floor tom. For a snare, I love old 5-
inch-deep wooden snare drums (Gretsch,
Ludwig, Slingerland, whatever). The last
one of these sets I bought cost me $350,
including all the mounting hardware and
snare drum. It wasn’t pretty, but boy, did it
sound great.

Once you get your drums tuned as well as you can, the next step is to take
care of any rattles that might be coming from the stands or mounting hard-
ware. Tighten up any loose hardware and move any stands that may be
touching one another. You may need to make some small adjustments to the
pitches of your drums if they are causing any hardware to rattle.
If you still have some ringing or unwanted overtones, then you can dampen
the drums slightly. Cotton gauze taped lightly on the edge of the head (away
from the drummer) is often enough. If you want a really dry sound on your
snare drum, you can use the wallet trick: Have the drummer place his or her
wallet on the head. (Use the drummer’s wallet — it’ll probably be lighter
because of all the money that isn’t in it.)
When the tuning of your drums is perfect, you’re ready to start placing some
microphones. You can choose from an unlimited number of miking configu-
rations, only a few of which I can cover here. (It would take a whole book to
cover them all.)
The room and the drums
The room influences the drums’ sound more than it influences that of the
other instruments. If you’re looking for a big drum sound, you need a fairly
live room (one with lots of reflection).
I know you’re thinking, “But all I have to work with is a bedroom for a studio
and it’s carpeted.” No worries, you can work with that. Remember, if you
have a home studio, then potentially you have your whole home to work
with. Here are a couple of ideas to spark your imagination:
✦Buy three or four 4-x-2-foot sheets of plywood and lean them up against
the walls of your room. Also place one on the floor just in front of the
kick drum. This adds some reflective surfaces to the room.
✦Put the drums in your garage (or living room, or any other room with a
reverberating sound) and run long mic cords to your mixer. If you have a
laptop computer for your Pro Tools system, you can just throw it under
your arm and move everything into your garage or, better yet, take all
this stuff to a really great-sounding room and record.
✦Set up your drums in a nice-sounding room and place an additional mic
just outside the door to catch some additional ambient sound. You can
then mix this in with the other drum tracks to add a different quality of
reverberation to the drums.
Kick (bass)-drum considerations
The mic of choice for most recording engineers when recording a kick drum
is a dynamic mic. In fact, you can find some large diaphragm-dynamic mics
specifically designed to record kick drums. 

Setting Up Your Mics: Some Suggestions
260
No matter where you place the mic, you can reduce the amount of boominess
that you get from the drum by placing a pillow or blanket inside the drum.
Some people choose to let the pillow or blanket touch the inside head. I prefer
to keep it a couple of inches away from the inside head, but sometimes it’s
okay to let it touch the outside head.
That said, you can place your mic in several ways (all conveniently illustrated
in Figure 2-14):
✦Near the inside head: If you take off the outside head or cut a hole in it,
you can stick the mic inside the drum. Place the mic 2 to 3 inches away
from the inside head and a couple of inches off center. This is the stan-
dard way to mic a kick drum if you have the outside head off or if a hole
is cut in it. This placement gives you a sharp attack from the beater hit-
ting the head. 
✦Halfway inside the drum: You can modify the preceding miking tech-
nique by moving the mic back so it’s about halfway inside the drum. In
this case, place the mic right in the middle, pointing at where the beater
strikes the drum. This placement gives you less of the attack of the
beater striking the head and more of the body of the drum’s sound.
✦Near the outside head: If you have both heads on the drum, you can
place the mic a few inches from the outside head. If you want a more
open, boomy sound (and you have the drum’s pitch set fairly high),
point the mic directly at the center of the head. If you want less boom,
offset the mic a little and point it about two-thirds of the way toward the
center.
If your drum sounds thin after trying these mic placement approaches, you
can try these two things:

261
✦Tune the drum slightly up. In your quest for a deep bass tone, you may
have tuned the drum too low. (This is especially common if you have a
large bass drum.) In this case, the drum’s fundamental tone may be too
low to be heard clearly. Raising the pitch a bit usually solves the problem. 
✦Create a tunnel with acoustic panels. Putting the mic in the tunnel often
helps if you have a room that’s too dead. Place two of the panels on their
sides (reflective surfaces facing into the room) with one end of each
panel near the outside of the drum. Angle the panels out so that where
they are farthest from the drum set, the distance between them is just
under 4 feet. Then lay the other two panels (reflective surface facing
down) across the side panels to create a tunnel. You can also place a
piece of plywood on the floor under these panels to further increase the
resonance. Place the mic halfway into the tunnel, facing the center of the
drum.
Snare-drum considerations
The snare drum is probably the most important drum in popular music. The
bass guitar can cover the kick drum’s rhythm, and the rest of the drums
aren’t part of the main groove. A good, punchy snare drum can make a track,
whereas a weak, thin one can eliminate the drive that most popular music
needs.
Because the snare drum is located so close to the other drums (especially
the hi-hats), a cardioid pattern mic is a must. The most common mic for a
snare drum is the trusty Shure SM57. The mic is generally placed between
the hi-hats and the small tom-tom about 1 or 2 inches from the snare drum
head (see Figure 2-15). Point the diaphragm directly at the head. You may
need to make some minor adjustments to eliminate any bleed from the hi-
hats. This position gives you a nice, punchy sound.
If you want a crisper tone, you can add a second mic under the drum. Place
this mic about an inch or two from the head with the diaphragm pointing 
at the snares. Make minor adjustments to minimize any leakage from the 
hi-hats.
If you have the available tracks, record each snare mic to a separate track
and blend the two later during mixdown. If you don’t have the available
tracks, blend them together until you have the sound that you want. You can
also try reversing the phase of the bottom mic. (Some preamps have a phase
switch for each channel or you can reverse the phase by choosing the Invert
option under the AudioSuites menu. Choose AudioSuite➪Invert from the
main menu.) Some people prefer the sound of the bottom mic this way.

Setting Up Your Mics: Some Suggestions
262
Tom-toms
The tom-toms sound best when you use a dynamic mic. For the mounted
toms (the ones above the kick drum), you can use one or two mics. If you
use one mic, place it between the two drums about 4 to 6 inches away from
the heads. (Figure 2-16 shows this placement option.) If you use two mics,
place one above each drum about 1 to 3 inches above the head.
If you want a boomy sound with less attack, you can place a mic inside the
shell with the bottom head off the drum.
Floor toms are miked the same way as the mounted tom-toms:
✦Place a single mic a couple of inches away from the head near the rim. 
✦If you have more than one floor tom, you can place one mic between
them or mic them individually.
Hi-hats
The hi-hats are generally part of the main groove — as such, they’re impor-
tant enough that you want to spend some time getting a good sound. You’ll
probably have problems with a few other mics on the drum set picking up
the hi-hats, particularly the snare drum mic and overhead mics. (Some
people don’t even bother miking the hi-hats for this reason.)
Figure 2-15:
The proper
placement

263
I like to mic hi-hats because, to me, these cymbals often sound too trashy
through the snare-drum mic. If you mic the hi-hats, make sure that the
snare-drum mic is picking up as little of the hi-hats as possible by placing 
it properly.
You can use either a dynamic mic or, better yet, a small diaphragm con-
denser mic for the hi-hats. The dynamic mic gives you a trashier sound and
the small diaphragm condenser mic produces a bright sound. You can work
with either by adjusting the EQ. I usually add just a little bit (4dB or so) of a
shelf EQ set at 10 kHz to add just a little sheen to the hi-hats. Book 6,
Chapter 3 covers EQ in detail.
Place the mic about 3 to 4 inches above the hi-hats and point it down. The
exact placement of the mic is less important than the placement of the other
instrument mics because of the hi-hats’ tone. Just make sure your mic isn’t
so close that you hit it instead of the cymbal.
Cymbals
You want to know one secret to the huge drum sound of Led Zeppelin’s
drummer, John Bonham? Finesse. He understood (I’m guessing, because 
I never really talked to him about this) that the drums sound louder and
bigger in a mix if the cymbals are quieter in comparison. So he played his
Figure 2-16:
Miking the

Setting Up Your Mics: Some Suggestions
264
cymbals softly and hit the drums pretty hard. This allowed the engineer to
boost the levels of the drums without having the cymbals drown everything
else out. Absolutely brilliant.
Because the drums bleeding into the overhead mics is inevitable and the
overhead mics are responsible for providing much of the drums’ presence in
a mix, playing the cymbals softly allows you to get more of the drums in
these mics. This helps the drums sound bigger.
Ask (no, demand) that your drummer play the cymbals quieter. Also use
smaller cymbals with a fast attack and a short decay. Doing these things cre-
ates a better balance between the drums and cymbals and makes the drums
stand out more in comparison.
Small-diaphragm condenser mics capture the cymbals’ high frequencies
well. You can mic the cymbals by placing mics about 6 inches above each
cymbal or by using overhead mics set 1 to 3 feet above the cymbals. (See the
next section for more on mic placement.)
The whole kit
Most of the time, you want to have at least one (but preferably two) ambient
mics on the drums — if for no other reason than to pick up the cymbals.
These (assuming you use two mics) are called overhead mics and (as the
name implies) you place them above the drum set (usually by means of a
boom stand). The most-common types of mics to use for overheads are
large- and small-diaphragm condenser mics because they pick up the high
frequencies in the cymbals and give the drum set’s sound a nice sheen
(brightness). You also might want to try a pair of ribbon mics to pick up a
nice, sweet sound on the overheads (but remember, ribbon mics can be
fragile).
To mic the drum set with overhead mics, you can use either the X-Y coinci-
dent technique or spaced stereo pairs. Place them 1 to 2 feet above the cym-
bals, just forward of the drummer’s head. Place X-Y mics in the center and
set up spaced stereo pairs so they follow the 3:1 rule (the mics should be set
up 3 to 6 feet apart if they are 1 to 2 feet above the cymbals). This counters
any phase problems. Point the mic down toward the drums and you’re ready
to record. Figure 2-17 shows both of these setups.
Hand drums
Hand drums can be anything from the familiar conga to unusual drums such
as the North African tar, Middle Eastern doumbek, or Brazilian Pandeiro.
Because you may encounter many types of hand drums, this section gives
you some general guidelines when recording any hand drum.

Book III
Chapter 2
Miking: Getting a
Great Source Sound
Setting Up Your Mics: Some Suggestions
265
Your selection in mics depends on the type of drum and its tonal character-
istics. For example, conga drums occupy the middle of the frequency spec-
trum and produce a loud sound that a large diaphragm condenser mic can
capture well. Or if you want a tighter, drier sound, you can use a dynamic
mic. If you choose the dynamic mic, the mic colors the sound of your
recording.
If you want to record any number of the smaller, higher-pitched hand drums,
use either a large or small diaphragm condenser mic and skip the dynamic
mic altogether.
Mic placement also varies considerably among the various hand drums.
Listen to the sound of the drum and find a place where you like what you
hear. For the most part, placing the mic anywhere from 1 to 3 feet from the
drum creates the fullest sound. If you want a lot of attack, you can place the
mic closer. You lose some of the drum’s depth, however, when you place the
mic closer than a foot.
Percussion
Miscellaneous percussion instruments, such as shakers and triangles, are
nice additions to many styles of music. These instruments sound best with a
good condenser mic. I choose a large or small diaphragm mic, depending on
the characteristics that I want to pick up. For instance, a shaker can sound
great with a large diaphragm mic because this mic brings out the lower fre-
quencies of the instrument slightly and softens the overall sound a bit.
The room and the percussion
Most of the time, the room doesn’t have a huge impact on percussion instru-
ments because you mic them closely. If your room does get in the way, use
the acoustic panels in much the same way that I suggest for vocals earlier in
this chapter (partially surround the mic and musician with baffles).
X-Y mics 1-2 feet above cymbals

The mics and the percussion
Both large and small diaphragm mics work well for percussion. The main
thing to remember when recording percussion instruments is that they can
have a high SPL (Sound Pressure Level, or just plain volume), so you may
need to pad the mic.
As far as mic placement goes, I like to put a single mic anywhere from 6 to 18
inches away, depending on the size of the instrument. For example, because
maracas are loud, I put the mic back a bit (18 inches), whereas with a trian-
gle, I find that 6 to 8 inches sounds best.

A
fter you get your mics set up — see Chapter 2 of this book for more on
that — and before you actually start to record, there are still a few
things you can do to make the process easier and to optimize the perform-
ance of your system. This chapter covers all you need to do before you
actually start to record. This includes understanding and using Record
modes and dealing with disk allocation, for starters.
This chapter also shows you how to enable your tracks to record, how to
set your levels to give you the best sound possible, and how to manage your
monitoring setup so it’s easy to perform at your best. To top it off, this chap-
ter guides you through the process of setting up a click track and song
tempo and meter map so when it comes time to edit your audio (not that
your performances need editing), you’ll be able to do it quicker and with
less effort. (Not sure what click tracks, tempo maps, and meter maps are?
Don’t worry. By the time you finish this chapter, you’ll be throwing these
terms around like a seasoned sound engineer.)
Recognizing Record Modes
Pro Tools offers the following four Record modes: Non-Destructive,
Destructive, Loop, and QuickPunch. You can choose the mode you want 
by selecting the mode from the Operations section of the main menu
(Operations➪QuickPunch, for example), by Ctrl+clicking (Mac) the Record
button in the Transport window, or by right-clicking (on a PC) that selfsame
Record button. All this clicking cycles you through the four record modes. 
Each of these modes has its place; knowing which one to use for a given sit-
uation can help you greatly in the efficiency department. These different
modes are detailed in the following sections.

Recognizing Record Modes
268
You can see which mode you’re in by looking at the Record button in the
Transport window. The modes are designated as shown in Figure 3-1.
Non-Destructive Record mode
Non-Destructive recording is the default setting in Pro Tools. Whenever you
record in this mode, a new audio file is created without erasing any previous
files or regions. This new file automatically gets added to the Audio Regions
list — located on the right side of the Edit window (if it’s not visible, click the
double arrow at the bottom right of the Edit window) — where it resides
with the previously recorded files.
Destructive Record mode
Recording in Destructive Record mode erases any and all previously recorded
audio regions found on that particular track — which basically mirrors the
way traditional analog tape recorders work. This can be handy for keeping
your hard drives from becoming full quickly, but it means that you don’t get
a chance to use a previous take after you’ve recorded over it. Since Non-
Destructive Record mode is the default mode, you need to select Destructive
Record mode from either the Operations menu (choose Operations➪
Destructive from the main menu) or Ctrl+click (on a Mac) the Record button
in the Transport window or right-click (on a PC) until the “D” icon appears in
the Record button, as shown in Figure 3-1. 
Loop Record mode
Loop recording consists of choosing a start and end point on a track and
having this section play over and over again while you record and rerecord.
Each time the loop runs, it creates a new audio region. That way you can

record a difficult section of a song as many times as you want and still have
all the takes available for review later on. To enable Loop Record mode
chose Operation➪Loop Record or Ctrl+click (on a Mac) the Record button in
the Transport window or right-click (on a PC) until the Loop Record icon
appears in the record button (Figure 3-1).
To create a loop to record to, follow these steps:
1. Enter the start point for your loop in the Start field of the Transport
window.
The Transport window runs along the top of the Edit window. Its (many)
features are discussed in detail in Book 2, Chapter 4.
2. Enter the end point for your loop in the End field in the Transport
window.
3. If you want a pre-roll, enter an amount of time for it to run, using the
Pre-Roll field of the Transport window.
The pre-roll will only happen before the first time through the loop. After
that, the loop runs the same way each time through: from start point to
end point and then back to the start point.
To find out how to review a bunch of audio regions you’ve recorded using
loops, check out the “Auditioning takes” section of the next chapter (Book 3,
Chapter 4). 
QuickPunch Record mode
The QuickPunch Record mode is great for manually adding a corrected musi-
cal phrase on the fly — punching in (starting to record) and punching out
(stopping the recording process) onto record-enabled tracks while the song
plays. Of course, you can punch in and out in the Destructive and Non-
Destructive modes (by selecting start and end points), but QuickPunch is
designed for use on the fly: You can punch in and out up to 100 times during
each pass of the song. To select the QuickPunch Record mode, choose it
from the Operations menu (choose Operations➪QuickPunch from the main
menu) or Ctrl+click (on a Mac) the Record button in the Transport window
or right-click (on a PC) until the QuickPunch icon (a little “P”, refer to Figure
3-1) appears inside the Record button.
QuickPunch also ensures that you can constantly hear the audio as the
punch in and punch out happens, seamlessly switching between monitoring
the already-recorded track and monitoring the input source for the track
being punched.

Dealing with Disk Allocation
270
By default, Pro Tools switches automatically from the recorded material to
the fresh input as the punch is enabled — and back again as the punch is
disabled. If you don’t want this feature and would prefer hearing your input
source before and after the punch (as well as during the punch), choose
Operations➪Input Only Monitoring from the main menu. (This is detailed
later in this chapter.)
Dealing with Disk Allocation
Recording and playing back audio tracks is a hard drive-intensive process.
To make this process as smooth as possible, you want to set up your hard
drive for the best possible (optimized) disk allocation — the process of spec-
ifying where your tracks get stored.
Basically, “to optimize” here means either limiting the amount of hard-drive
space used for recording audio or by recording to more than one hard drive.
Both options are covered in this section.
Allocating hard-drive space
How fast you can write to or read from a hard drive depends on where the
data is on the disk; if it’s all over the place, the hard drive has to hunt for it,
which means the data takes longer to read. To minimize the jumping around
that the hard drive has to do to find the data, you can tell Pro Tools to put
your recorded audio on only a limited portion of the disk. This process of
disk allocation speeds up access time. (You’ll find that certain types of hard-
drive formats, such as HFS+, and NTFS, are especially prone to slow-pokiness
and can benefit from this “marking off” of available disk space.)
To allocate your hard-drive space, follow these steps:
1. Choose Setups➪Preferences from the main menu.
The Preferences dialog box duly appears.
2. Click the Operation tab at the top of the Preferences dialog box.
The Preferences dialog box puts on its Operation face.
3. In the Open Ended Record Allocation box, choose Limit To:.
4. Type in a time slightly longer than the longest song you usually
record.
This limits the maximum file size so that Pro Tools places it within cer-
tain boundaries on the hard drive, thus reducing the real estate that
must be traveled for each file.

Book III
Chapter 3
Preparing to Record
Dealing with Disk Allocation
271
If you expect that you might end up with a really long song, check the Use
All Available Space option instead — or choose a really high number (say,
60 minutes) for your limit. This way your recording won’t stop before you
want it to.
Using multiple audio drives
One way to increase your ability to record and play back more tracks is to
have more than one hard drive dedicated to audio. (Remember, this means
having three hard drives in your computer: one for the system files and
applications, and two for audio.)
To allocate a specific hard drive on which to record a track, choose Setups➪
Disk Allocation from the main menu to open the Disk Allocation dialog box
(as shown in Figure 3-2). In this dialog box, you can manually choose the
hard drive that each audio track is recorded to by click-holding the track
name (a pop-up menu opens) and selecting one of the drives from the list
(all the drives in your computer will show up in this list). Or you can check
the Use Round Robin Allocation for New Tracks option — in which case, Pro
Tools distributes the tracks serially to more than one hard drive. All your
files are placed in a folder created for the session by Pro Tools.
If you want to designate a different folder to record your tracks to, check the
Disk Allocation dialog box and press Change. Select the folder from the
dialog box that appears.
If you want to record audio to the system drive, remember that audio takes
up a big honkin’ lot of space, and having to deal with it will compromise the
performance of your system. Only choose this drive if you have no other
options — you have only one hard drive in your system, for example, or all
your other drives are full.

Enabling Recording
When you enable recording for a track, you’re ready to go. But before you
push the ol’ Record Enable button, check out what I have to say about the
ins and outs of enabling recording, using Latch mode, and running the
Record Safe mode. Doing so may help you avoid some common pitfalls.
Record-enabling
Enabling a track for recording (the audio buzzword is record-enabling) is
easy: Just click the Record Enable button for that track in either the Edit or
Mix window (Figure 3-3). The track will stay in Record mode until you either
click another track’s Record Enable button or you toggle out of Record mode
(by clicking the track’s Record Enable button one more time).
It is possible to keep a track in Record mode when you move on and enable
other tracks — just engage the Latch mode (see next section) or hold the
Shift key down as you select your other track(s). 
Aside from simply clicking the Record Enable button, you are free to use key-
board shortcuts to enable all tracks or selected tracks. These are done the
following ways:
✦To record-enable all tracks: Option+click (on a Mac) or Alt+click 
(on a PC) the Record Enable button of any track.
✦To record-enable selected tracks: Shift+click each track to select multi-
ple tracks and then Shift+option+click (on a Mac) or Shift+Alt+click (on a
PC) the Record Enable button on one of the selected tracks. You can
select grouped tracks to enable by highlighting the group in the Edit
Groups list (located in the lower right of the Edit window) and then
Shift+option+clicking (on a Mac) or Shift+Alt+clicking (on a PC) a Record
Enable button on one of the tracks in the group.
This step is only a time-saver if you already have some tracks selected
and you want to record enable them. If your tracks aren’t already selected
it’s much faster to just Shift+click the Record Enable button on each track.
Once you have one or more tracks enabled for recording, you can hit Record
then Play to start recording. (Book 3, Chapter 4, has more on the intricacies
of recording.)

Book III

Enabling Recording
273
Using Latch Record Enable mode
With Pro Tools, you have the option of latching — or unlatching — your
Record Enable buttons. And what, pray tell, is latching? Well, in Latch
Record Enable mode you basically “lock” record enabling down so, when
you enable recording on one track and then move to enable recording on
another track, the first track stays in Record Enable mode. This allows you
to consecutively enable more than one track. 
With Latch Record Enable mode off, when you enable one track and then
go to enable another track, the first track will turn off and no longer be
record-enabled. 
Now that that’s straight, here’s how you actually turn Latch Record Enable
mode on and off:
1. Choose Setups➪Preferences from the main menu.
The Preferences dialog box appears.
2. In the Preferences dialog box, choose the Operation tab.
The Operation view of the Preferences dialog box appears.
3. Check the Latch Record Enable Buttons box to turn on this feature. 
This check box is located in the upper right of the window as shown in
Figure 3-4.

Running Record Safe mode
Record Safe mode does for your tracks what Write Protect features do for
your floppy disks or Zip disks — it makes it impossible for you to record-
enable a track. This is a truly helpful feature that has saved me from acciden-
tally recording over an already-great track. To put a track into Record Safe
mode, Command+click (on a Mac) or Ctrl+click (on a PC) the track’s Record
Enable button. (Remember: You can find the Record Enable button in either
the Edit window or the Mix window — refer to Figure 3-3.) If you clicked cor-
rectly, the Record Enable button will gray out, as shown in Figure 3-5. To
reverse this procedure, Command+click (Mac) or Ctrl+click (PC) the button
again.
If you want, you can put more than one track at a time in Record Safe mode.
Here’s how: 
✦Placing selected tracks in Record Safe mode: Command-Option-Shift-
click (on a Mac) or Ctrl+Alt-Shift-click (on a PC) the Record Enable
button for one of the selected tracks. This step assumes you have tracks
already selected (Shift+click the track name in either Edit or Mix window

to select them). If the tracks aren’t already selected, then it’s much
quicker just Command+clicking (on a Mac) or Ctrl+clicking (on a PC) the
track’s Record Enable button for each track. 
✦Placing all tracks in Record Safe mode: Command+Option+click (on a
Mac) or Ctrl+Alt+click (on a PC) the Record Enable button on any track.
To toggle either selection off, just repeat whatever click combination you
used to get the multiple tracks selected in the first place. 
Setting Levels
One of the most important parts of getting good recordings is to get your
recording levels just right — too low and your instrument sounds thin or
weak, too much level and you risk clipping (distorting) the signal. 
In order to get a signal into Pro Tools, you need to a) record-enable a track
and b) have the Input selector set to the hardware input your instrument or
microphone is plugged into. (Book 2, Chapter 3 has more on inputs in gen-
eral and Input selectors in particular.) Once this is done you can set the
recording level in Pro Tools one of two ways:
✦Using the preamp trim knob in your Digidesign interface. The 002 and
002R have four preamps while the M-Box and 001 have two preamps.
You can plug your microphone or your electric guitar or bass directly
into the input and adjust the trim knob until you get a good signal show-
ing in the track’s level meter. (“Good” here means peaks that don’t rise
above the yellow — see the “What’s a good level to record at?” sidebar,
later in this chapter.) 
Condenser mics need phantom power to function. You can turn on phan-
tom power to the channels with preamps by engaging the switch on the
back panel of the interface.
✦Using the line-in inputs in your interface and adjusting the output
level of your instrument using the instrument’s volume control. If you
use the line-in inputs, your instrument needs to be at line level. This
means that you can plug your synthesizer directly into these inputs but
if you want to use a microphone or an electric guitar or bass, you need
to boost the signal beforehand. 
For microphones, this involves using an external preamp and plugging
your mic into the preamp and the preamp into your Digidesign interface.
For an electric guitar or bass, you need a direct box (or a preamp with a
direct box connection). You place this device between your guitar’s
output and the Digidesign input. Make adjustments to your signal level
at this device, using the device’s gain control.

Setting a Record Range
276
The Volume fader for the track has no control over the Input level. It only
controls the playback and monitoring level. So if you want to adjust the
Input level, you need to make the adjustments on your interface or preamp.
(Check your owner’s manual if you’re not sure how to do this.)
Adjust the level of your input until you get a reading of the highest notes
somewhere in the middle of the yellow range in the track’s level meter.
Setting a Record Range
When you record in Pro Tools, you can either start and stop your session as
you record or you can set a recording range so the Pro Tools starts and stops
the recording process for you. This can be useful if you have your hands full
with instruments and you don’t want to take the chance that you’ll miss your
desired start or stop point by doing it by hand.
You can set the recording range using one of several methods:
✦Type a start and end time into the Start and End boxes of the Transport
window. (For a detailed look at the Transport window, check out Book 2,
Chapter 4.)
What’s a good level to record at?
There’s a lot of debate among professional
recording engineers as to what’s the best level
to record at in a digital recorder (such as Pro
Tools). Some say you should get as high a level
as possible to take full advantage of the
dynamic range that digital recording offers.
Others say that it’s better to record a little lower
so you don’t overload the summing bus of the
software when it comes time to mix. According
to this theory, doing so prevents unintentional
clipping (distortion, in other words) from
extreme transients (the initial attack of the
instrument) when recording. So, which way
should you go?
Well, since I record a lot of instruments with
fast, extreme transients such as drums, I fall
into the “record lower to be safe” category.
Typically I go for a level around –12dB, with
peaks no higher than –6dB. (If you follow my
lead here, your level meter should read in the
low- to middle-yellow range.) This gives me a
good signal that has plenty of dynamic range
but still leaves some headroom (room for more
signal before clipping) to work with. It also min-
imizes any possibility of extreme transients
ruining the take. 
I’m going to recommend, then, that you keep
your maximum levels squarely in the low to
middle of the yellow range in the track’s level
meter, regardless of the type of instrument you
want to record. If you follow my advice, you’ll
definitely thank me when you start to mix all
your tracks together. (Check out Book 6 for
more on mixing.)

Monitoring Your Tracks
277
✦Select a range in the ruler or in a track’s playlist. If you want to use the
ruler method, simply adjust the two blue arrows along the timeline until
you have the Beginning arrow and the End arrow where you want them. If
you want to use the track playlist method — where you set beginning and
end times by dragging across the record range with the Selector tool —
you must have the Link Edit and Timeline Selections turned on. This is
done either by choosing Operations➪Link Edit and Timeline Selections
from the main menu or by clicking the Link button in the Edit window.
(The Link button, shown here in the margin, is on the long, black toolbar
right above the timeline in the Edit window. Book 2, Chapter 4 tells you
more about it.) To turn Link Edit and Timeline Selections off again, click
the Link button again or choose Operations➪Auto Input Monitor from
the main menu.
Of course, if you don’t want to preset the recording range — letting the clips
fall where they may, as it were — don’t select either of these options and just
let the playing start wherever it is and run to the end.
You can also set a pre-roll and post-roll time in the Transport window. You
use pre-roll and post-roll settings to designate an amount of time for the song
to play either before (pre-roll) or after (post-roll) the actual recording hap-
pens. This can help you get into the groove of the song before you need to
start worrying about how well you’re playing.
Monitoring Your Tracks
To record effectively, you need to hear what you’re doing. This is the role of
monitoring. Managing your input monitoring in Pro Tools involves setting up
your monitor configuration and output and balancing between lowest latency
(the delay between input and output of the sound) and system performance.
These areas are detailed in this section.
Setting up monitoring
To set up your monitoring, you first need to choose the output of the tracks
you want to monitor so they match the main outputs on your system. Do
this by selecting the outputs in each track’s Output selector, located above
the Pan control in the Mix window. (Book 2, Chapter 4 has more than you’d
ever need to know about Output selectors and Mix windows.)
Choosing a monitor mode
Pro Tools has two monitor modes: Auto Input monitoring and Input Only
monitoring. (More on what these terms actually mean in a minute.) You 
can select between these two options by choosing Operations➪Auto 
Input Monitor or Operations➪Input Only Monitor from the main menu. 
(See Figure 3-6.)

Monitoring Your Tracks
278
Auto Input monitoring
In Auto Input Monitoring mode, you hear your previously recorded audio 
(if there is any) on a record-enabled track right up until the point you start
to record. Once recording has begun, you hear the input source as it’s being
recorded. After the recording is done, Pro Tools switches you back to hear-
ing the previously recorded stuff. This is useful for doing punch recording,
where you start and stop recording while the session plays.
Input Only monitoring
In Input Only Monitoring mode, you only hear the input source through your
monitors, regardless of whether other stuff is recorded on that track. When
this mode is enabled, the Record button in the Transport window is green.
When this mode is not enabled the record button is red.
Linking and unlinking Record and Playback faders
You have the option of “linking” the fader on your tracks when in Record
Enable or Playback mode (meaning that moving the fader in one mode moves
it the same distance in the other mode) or “unlinking” them (so you can main-
tain separate fader levels in each mode). If you opt for the unlinking option,
Pro Tools remembers where your fader was set in both Record Enable mode
and Playback mode and returns the fader to its position when you switch
between these modes. 
Unlinking your Record and Playback faders allows you to set the level differ-
ently for playback and record. This can be useful for punch recording —
where you start and stop recording while the session plays — since you can
adjust both the recorded stuff and your input source independently and
have the same relative levels between your previously recorded track and
the input in the mix. Otherwise your input source may be too loud or too
soft in comparison.

To link Record and Playback faders, follow these steps:
1. Choose Setups➪Preferences from the main menu.
The Preferences dialog box makes an appearance.
2. Click the Operation tab at the top of the Preferences dialog box.
The Preferences dialog box presents you with its Operation face.
3. Check or uncheck the Link Record and Play Faders box located in the
column on the right, as shown in Figure 3-7, depending which way
you want to work.
4. Click Done.
Adjusting the monitoring latency
All digital systems have some delay between the input of the audio and its
output. This is called latency. Latency used to be a big deal in computer-
based systems, because to record more than a couple of tracks at once you
had to set your system — usually by using a high HW (hardware) buffer
size — so the latency was painfully noticeable. This made it hard for many
musicians to record because they heard a distracting delay in their head-
phones as they recorded. 
Nowadays, latency isn’t such a big deal because computers are often power-
ful enough to be able to handle a lower buffer size while recording. You can
lower the buffer size in the Playback Engine dialog box, shown in Figure 3-8.
(To access the Playback Engine dialog box, just choose Setups➪Playback
Engine from the main menu.) Depending on your Digidesign interface, you
have the choice between 64 (002 and 002R only), 128, 256, 512, and 1024
samples. The lower the number, the lower the latency.
Figure 3-7:
The Link
Record and
Play Fader
check box.

Monitoring Your Tracks
280
For most recordings, you can get by with either 256- or 128-sample settings.
When recording at 44.1 kHz, this only represents around a 3 and 6 ms delay,
respectively. This is equivalent to standing either 3 or 6 feet away from your
instrument/amp/speaker. When mixing lots of tracks with a bunch of plug-
ins, you want to adjust this to a higher setting such as 512 or even 1024,
depending on the speed of your processor.
Using low-latency monitoring
If you want the least amount of latency possible and you don’t mind not
hearing reverb or other effects through your headphones, you can go for the
low-latency monitoring option: Just choose Operations➪Low Latency
Monitoring from the main menu. (See Figure 3-9.) 
Low-latency monitoring bypasses the internal mixer in Pro Tools and sends
the input’s sound back out without processing it. This reduces latency but it
also limits what you can do. Here are some of the “strings attached” that
come with low-latency monitoring:

✦Low-latency monitoring only applies to outputs 1 and 2 on your hard-
ware. Any tracks set to another output can’t be monitored this way, so
you must choose outputs 1 and 2 as your outputs for the track you want
to monitor.
✦None of the plug-ins that you have routed to tracks 1 and 2 will be heard
in this mode.
✦Tracks set to record from an internal bus (a submix for example) can’t
be monitored this way. You can only use this mode for tracks that use a
hardware input.
✦Tracks that you’re recording to won’t show up in the levels at the Master
Fader channel.
Creating a Click Track
A click track is basically a metronome that you can listen to while recording
to ensure that you stay in time with the session. Recording to a click track
can have many advantages, including being able to match the song’s sections
to particular bars or beats within the session. It also makes finding edit points
and performing certain edits much easier. I always spend a few minutes set-
ting up a click track for my songs and I recommend that you give it try, too.
To create a click track, you need to attach and configure a MIDI device to
produce the click. You also need to set a tempo and meter and create a track
to record the click to. The steps for these procedures are covered in this
section.
Setting the tempo
To set the tempo and meter of your session, or a section within your ses-
sion, double-click the Meter button in the expanded Transport window
(Check out Book 2, Chapter 4 for more on the expanded Transport window)
or choose Windows➪Show Tempo/Meter from the main menu. This will
open the Tempo/Meter Change dialog box. Choose Tempo Change from the
drop-down menu and you will have four parameters to adjust, as shown in
Figure 3-10: 
✦Snap to Bar: Checking this box aligns any tempo event you create to the
first beat in the nearest bar. 
✦Location: This is where you type the location where this tempo will
begin. Choosing 1/1/000 (bars/beats/ticks) makes this the default tempo
for the song.
✦Tempo: This box lets you type in the tempo, in beats per minute (BPM).
✦Resolution: This menu lets you choose the BPM (beats per minute)
value for the tempo of the song or song’s section. The default is 1/4 note.

Creating a Click Track
282
Choosing the meter
You set the meter for the session with the help of the Tempo/Meter Change
dialog box. You call up the dialog box by double-clicking the Meter button in
the expanded Transport window (or choose Windows➪Show Tempo/Meter
from the main menu). When the dialog box appears, choose Meter Change
from the drop-down menu, as shown in Figure 3-11. The Meter Change view
of the Tempo/Meter Change dialog box gives you the following parameters
to adjust:
✦Snap to Bar: Check this box to align any meter events with the first beat
in the nearest bar. 
✦Location: The number you enter in this box determines the beginning of
the meter (time signature) event. For songs with only one time signa-
ture, you enter 1/1/000 (bars/beats/ticks).
✦Meter: This box lets you type in the meter (4/4, for example) that you
want to use.
✦Click: This menu lets you choose the note value for the clicks played in
each measure. Choosing 1/4 note gives you four clicks in a 4/4 measure.

Configuring your device
To play a click track in Pro Tools, you need a device for creating the sound.
This can be an external MIDI sound module (such as a drum machine or key-
board) or a virtual device such as the DigiRack Click software plug-in (only
available in versions 6.0 and up).
To configure the click-track device, follow these steps:
1. If you’re using an external MIDI device for your click, connect the
device to a MIDI port connected to your computer. 
The 002 and 002R come with MIDI ports. The 001 and M-Box do not — if
you have one of these, you have to get a separate MIDI interface (Book 1,
Chapter 4 can get you up to speed on this). If you use the Click plug-in,
you don’t need to use your MIDI ports.
2. Choose MIDI➪Click Options from the main menu or double-click
either the Click button or the Countoff button in the Transport
window.
The Click/Countoff Options dialog box appears, as shown in
Figure 3-12.
3. In the Click/Countoff Options dialog box, click the Output drop-down
menu to choose the device that will play your click. 
If you’re using an external device, be sure to choose the port and MIDI
channel that your device is connected to. If you’re using the Click plug-
in, choose None.
4. Choose when you want the click to be played by selecting from the
options at the top of the window.
You can choose between During Play and Record, Only During Record,
and Only During Countoff.
5. Using the appropriate boxes, choose the MIDI note, velocity, and dura-
tion for the accented and unaccented notes of the click.
6. Select whether you want a countoff only during record or not and
then enter the number of bars you want in the Bars field. 
Selecting Only During Record means that there will be no countoff when
you play back the track. If you don’t want any countoff at all, type in 0
bars in the Bars field.
Even with your device configured, you still won’t get any sound out of your
click track until you enable it in your session. The next section shows you
how to do this.

Creating a Click Track
284
Enabling a click track
Even an electronic equivalent of a metronome has to be set in motion to do
any good. When you’ve set up your click track to do its job, you have to
enable it so it will run while you’re recording.
You can enable your click track in one of two ways:
✦Choose MIDI➪Click from the main menu.
✦Click the Click button in the MIDI section of the Transport window.
When Click is engaged this button will be blue.
You can engage the countoff by clicking the Countoff button in the MIDI
section of the Transport window. This button displays the number of
bars that the countoff is set for, and shows itself as blue when it’s
engaged.
Hearing your click
Of course, even when enabled, a click track does no good if you can’t hear
it — and yes, you have to tell the computer to let you hear it. To hear the
click played, you need to set up either your MIDI device or Click plug-in in its
own session track. The procedure for each is explained in this section.
Connecting an external device 
Follow these steps to connect your external MIDI device to sound the click:

1. Connect the audio output of your external MIDI device to an audio
input of your Digidesign hardware.
2. Create a new mono audio track by selecting File➪New Track from the
main menu or by pressing Shift+Command+N (on a Mac) or
Shift+Control+N (on a PC). When the New Track dialog box opens, use
the pop-up menus to choose a single mono Audio track and then click
Create. 
Your track appears in the Edit and Mix window and in the Audio Regions
list located at the right side of the Edit window.
Why mono? Well, it’s annoying to hear the clicking in only one ear. Mono
puts it in both ears, nice and clear.
3. Using the Input selector for your new track in either the Edit or Mix
window, select the input that corresponds to the input your device is
connected to.
4. Set the output to the main stereo outputs of your session, using the
Output selector for your new track in either the Edit or Mix window.
5. Record-enable the track by clicking the Record Enable button in
either the Edit or Mix window. 
Your click track plays according to your choice in the Click/Countoff
dialog box.
Routing the Click plug-in
Routing the Click plug-in to play the click requires these steps: 
1. Create a new auxiliary track by selecting File➪New Track from 
the main menu or by pressing Shift+Command+N (on a Mac) or
Shift+Control+N (on a PC). 
The New Track dialog box opens.
2. Use the pop-up menus to choose a single mono Aux Input track and
then click Create.
Your track appears in the Edit and Mix windows.
3. Using the Input selector for your new track in the Edit or Mix window,
select any one of your hardware inputs.
4. Set the output to the main stereo outputs of your session, using the
Output drop-down menu for your new track.
5. Display your Inserts options by choosing Displays➪Mix Window
Shows➪Inserts. 
The Inserts section for each channel strip appears in the Mix window. 

Creating a Click Track
286
6. Choose Click Plug-in from the Inserts drop-down menu for the track
you just created, as shown in Figure 3-13. 
The Click Plug-In dialog box opens. 
7. Use the Click Plug-In dialog box to choose the volume for your
accented and unaccented notes. Adjust the controls to taste and then
close the window by clicking the button in the upper left.
Your click track plays according to your choice in the Click/Countoff
dialog box.
I normally use a drum machine (or other decent drum sound from an exter-
nal device) to create my click. The Click plug-in, handy as it is, doesn’t have
the most pleasing sound.
Setting up tempo and meter events
If your song has any tempo or meter changes in it, you can set up a map of
these changes (events). You may want to do this if you have complex songs
with several different time signatures or tempos. This makes sure that your
click track follows these changes so you can stay in time too. This section
shows you how. 
Creating new tempo or meter events
Tempo and meter events are changes to your tempo or meter throughout
the song. You can make changes to the tempo or meter anywhere within the
song and the placement of these events throughout the session constitutes
Figure 3-13:

the tempo and meter maps. The easiest way to create new tempo or meter
events is to type in the location of the change of tempo or meter in the
Location field within the Tempo/Meter Options windows. You can also select
your locations by doing the following:
1. Click the Tempo or Meter ruler bar in the Edit window where you
want your tempo or meter change to happen.
Book 2, Chapter 4 gives you all the details on both the Tempo and Meter
ruler bars.
2. Open the Tempo/Meter Change dialog box by clicking the appropriate
icon at the far-left side of the ruler bar.
In the Tempo ruler, the icon is a quarter note; for the Meter ruler,
the icon is a fraction (1⁄4).
3. In the Tempo/Meter Change dialog box, check the Snap to Bar box if
you want the tempo or meter event to start at the beginning of the
nearest bar.
4. Type in the tempo or meter you want to use for that section.
5. Click Apply.
A triangle icon (green for tempo and yellow for meter) appears at the
location of this tempo or meter change.
You can use these steps to create more changes in tempo or meter (events)
anywhere within the session. As you create these events, Pro Tools creates a
map of them within your session with the little icons.
Editing tempo and meter events
When your tempo or meter events are in place, you can move them around,
delete them, copy them, or paste them. The following list tells you how:
✦Moving a tempo or meter event: You can move the location of tempo or
meter events easily by dragging the corresponding triangle along the
ruler to where you want it. Alternatively, you can double-click the trian-
gle to open the Tempo/Meter Change window, where you can use the
Location field to set a specific location.
✦Deleting an event: To delete an event, Option+click (on a Mac) or
Alt+click (on a PC) over the triangle of the event you want to remove.
✦Copying an event: To copy a tempo or meter event, follow these steps:
1. Set the Edit mode to Grid and the grid resolution to 1 bar.
Doing so ensures that you select the beginning of a bar. (Book 4,
Chapter 1 details how to work with Edit modes and grid resolutions.)

Creating a Click Track
288
2. Press Command (on a Mac) or Ctrl (on a PC) and click and drag
from the beginning to the end of the event you want to copy.
You can select more than one contiguous event by continuing to drag
across the events you want to select.
3. Choose Edit➪Copy from the main menu or press Command+C 
(on Mac) or Ctrl+C (on a PC) to copy the events.
✦Pasting an event: To paste an event that you’ve already copied, follow
these steps:
1. Click the place in the ruler bar where you want to paste the
event(s).
2. Choose Edit➪Paste from the main menu or press Command+V 
(on a Mac) or Ctrl+V (on a PC).

ecording audio is what Pro Tools does best. (Well, that and editing it.
See Book 4.) This chapter guides you through the process of recording
single and multiple tracks from analog and digital sources, as well as playing all
that stuff back again. In this chapter, you also discover the home recordist’s
best way to create full-blown songs: overdubbing.
Overdubbing is adding tracks to those you’ve already recorded. This is a
process that I guarantee you’ll use a lot, so I spend a fair amount of time get-
ting you up to speed on the best (and easiest) ways to overdub in Pro Tools.
Recording Tracks
Recording audio tracks in Pro Tools requires that you first choose your
Record mode, create a track, set levels, enable recording, and turn on a click
track if you’re using one. These steps are all covered in detail in Book 3,
Chapter 3 (the previous chapter), but you’ll also find a basic overview of
these topics in this section. 
Once you have all these steps taken care of, you’re ready to record some
audio. This section leads you through the process of recording a single track
or multiple tracks, undoing or canceling takes, recording additional takes,
auditioning takes, and using playlists to organize and choose takes to 
listen to. 
Recording a single track
Most home recordists tend to record a single track at a time. (After all, most
human beings can only play one instrument at a time.) Recording to a single
track — whether it’s a mono or stereo — requires the following basic steps
(Steps 1-6 are explained in detail in Book 3, Chapter 3 — the previous 
chapter):

Recording Tracks
290
1. Open a session or create a new session.
2. Create a new audio track by pressing Command+N (on a Mac) or
Ctrl+N (on a PC) or by choosing File➪New Track from the main menu.
3. Assign an input and output to your new track by using the Input and
Output drop-down menus found in the Controls section of the track. 
4. Record-enable the track.
5. Set your recording level.
Be sure that your monitor speakers are turned off or all the way down if
you’re recording in the same room as your monitors, because the micro-
phone may create feedback (an obnoxious hum or squeal) if it’s too
close to your speakers. My advice: When recording, use headphones to
monitor your playing.
6. Enable the click track and pre-roll (if you’re using those features).
7. Click the Return to Zero button in the Basic Controls section of the
Transport window, as shown in Figure 4-1. 
This ensures that you start recording at the beginning of the session.
8. Click the Record button in the Basic Controls section of the Transport
window, as shown in Figure 4-2. The Record button blinks red.
Keep in mind that clicking Record doesn’t actually start the recording
process; it only gets Pro Tools ready for recording. 
If you want to record using keyboard shortcuts for Step 8, you can use any of
the following methods:
✦Press the F12 key.
✦Press Command+Spacebar (on a Mac) or Ctrl+Spacebar (on a PC).

✦If you’ve set your system so your Numeric Keyboard mode is linked to
Transport, just press the numeric keyboard’s 3 key. (Linking your numeric
keyboard to Transport is easy; just choose Setups➪Preferences from the
main menu to access the Preferences dialog box, select the Operation tab
from the dialog box and then select Transport in the Numeric Keypad
mode section.)
9. Click the Play button in the Basic Controls section of the Transport
window (Figure 4-3).
Only after you click Play does Pro Tools actually start recording; the
Record button glows a nice red while recording (not that you’ll be
watching it as you play).

Managing multiple tracks at once
There are times that you’ll want to record more than one track at a time —
when you stereo-mic an instrument, when you record drums using several
mics, or even when you want to record a few musicians at a time. Recording
multiple tracks at one time follows much the same procedure as if you were
recording a single track — the only difference is that you use one of the 
following methods to choose multiple tracks:
✦Select the Latch Record Enable Buttons option in the Operation tab of
the Preferences dialog box, and then click each track’s Record Enable
button. (To call up the Preferences dialog box, choose Setups➪
Preferences from the main menu.) 
✦Press and hold the Shift key as you click each track’s Record Enable
button to record enable noncontiguous tracks.
✦To select all the tracks in your session, Option+click (on a Mac) or
Alt+click (on a PC) the Record Enable button on any track.
✦To record-enable a selected track, Shift+option+click (Mac) or
Shift+Alt+click (PC) the Record Enable button on the selected track.
Book 3, Chapter 3 has more on these options.
Recording multiple tracks at once takes a toll on your system. A normal and
common symptom of this load is a delay between the time you click the Play
button and when the recording actually starts. You can eliminate this delay
by letting your system “warm up” first. This is done by following these steps:
1. Click the Record button.
2. Press and hold Alt (on a PC) or Option (on a Mac) key while you click
the Play button.
The Record and Play buttons flash.
3. Click the Play button when you’re ready to record.
Pro Tools starts recording immediately, with no delay.
4. When you’re done recording, click the Stop button.
Using pre- and post-rolls
A pre-roll or post-roll is a designated amount of time that the session plays
before or after the recording starts or stops. I’m a big fan of pre- and post-
rolls (well, at least pre-rolls). For example, setting a pre-roll for two or three
bars lets me get into the groove of a song before the recording actually starts.
You can set pre- and post-rolls several ways, as the following sections make
abundantly clear.

Using the Pre-Roll and Post-Roll fields in the Transport window
To set the pre- and post-roll values in the Transport window, do the following:
1. Choose Displays➪Transport Window Shows➪Expanded View from the
main menu. 
The Pre-Roll and Post-Roll fields appear beneath the basic transport
controls.
2. Click in the Pre-Roll Counter field in the Transport window and type
in the length you want, as shown in Figure 4-4.
This field will be displayed in the same format as the main counter. In
the case of Figure 4-4, the format is bars and beats.
3. Press Enter.
4. Click in the Post-Roll Counter field and type in your desired value.
This, too, will be displayed in the format selected for the main counter.
5. Press Enter.
6. Click the Pre-Roll and/or Post-Roll button in the Transport window to
enable it. (The buttons are labeled “pre-roll” and “post-roll” and are
to the left of the counter fields you used in Steps 2 and 4.)
All enabled buttons are highlighted.
Using the Pre-Roll and Post-Roll flags 
in the ruler bar of the Edit window
The Pre- and Post-Roll flags are located along the Timebase ruler in the Edit
window. The flags are colored gray when they are disabled and green when
they are enabled. Follow these steps to set the pre-roll and post-roll amounts
using the flags in the ruler bar:

1. Press Command+K (on a Mac) or Ctrl+K (on a PC) or choose
Operations➪Pre/Post-Roll Playback from the main menu to enable
Pre-Roll and Post-Roll flags on the ruler of the Edit window.
The flags turn green to alert you that the pre- and post-roll functions are
enabled.
2. If you want the flag to snap to the grid, click the Grid button in the
upper-right of the Edit window to select the Grid Edit mode.
Otherwise use any other Edit mode.
3. Click and drag the Pre- and Post-Roll flags on the ruler to where you
want them.
If you want the same value for both the pre- and post-rolls, you can press Alt
(on a PC) or Option (on a Mac) while you drag one of the flags. The other
flag will follow along as you move one.
Setting pre-rolls and post-rolls within a track’s playlist
Playlists are the regions contained in a track and are located in the middle of
the Edit window to the right of the track controls. Playlists most often dis-
play the waveform for the audio in the regions but can be set to display
other things, such as automation views. In addition to all the other neat
things you can do with a playlist, you can also enable and disable pre- and
post-rolls. Just do the following:
1. Choose Operations➪Link Edit and Timeline Selection from the main
menu.
2. Click the Selector tool and drag along your track where you want the
recording to start and stop. 
This selects your record range.
3. Option+click (on a Mac) or Alt+click (on a PC) the track’s playlist
where you want to put the pre-roll.
This both turns on the pre-roll and sets its location, as shown in 
Figure 4-5.
4. Option+click (on a Mac) or Alt+click (on a PC) the track’s playlist
where you want to put the post-roll. 
This both turns on the post-roll and sets its location.

To turn off the pre-roll from within a track’s playlist, Option+click (on a Mac)
or Alt+click (on a PC) near the Start point of the record range selected. To
turn off the post-roll, Option+click (on a Mac) or Alt+click (on a PC) near the
End point of the record range selected.
Playing Back Your Tracks
After you’ve recorded a track, most likely you’ll want to listen to it to make
sure that it sounds the way you want it. Pro Tools offers you many ways to
play back a track. In this section, I guide you through a few of the many
options for playing back audio regions.
Playing recorded tracks
After you’ve recorded a track and clicked the Stop button, you can hear the
track by turning off the Record Enable button (click it to make the light dis-
appear, as shown at left in Figure 4-6) and then clicking the Play button
(shown at right in Figure 4-6). You can adjust the volume by moving the
channel’s fader up and down.
If you use the Auto Input Monitoring option from the Operations menu, there
is no need to disable the Record Enable button. All you have to do is return
to the beginning of the session (Press the Return to Zero button in the
Transport window) and click the Play button in Basic Controls section of the
Transport window. Pro Tools will automatically switch to play back the
recorded track. When you click Record, and then click Start to record
another take, Pro Tools will switch your monitoring back to the input.
Before you play back a track, make sure the fader is turned down most of the
way; too-high volume can ruin your ears or speakers. You can slowly bring it
up as the session plays to get the volume you want.

pre-or post-
roll flag.

Playing Back Your Tracks
296
If you have Link Edit and Timeline Selection checked under the Operations
menu, you can play back your recorded track from anywhere in the session
by clicking where you want to start on the Timebase ruler — using the
Selector tool in the Edit window — and then clicking Start. You can also use
the Rewind and Fast Forward buttons to move through the session, but this
tip makes getting around much faster and easier.
Setting scrolling options
Pro Tools lets you decide how you want the track material and Timebase
ruler data to move (scroll) in Edit window as a session is playing or record-
ing. You can choose between the following (all located in the Scroll Options
submenu under the Operations menu, as shown in Figure 4-7):
✦No Auto-Scrolling: With this option chosen, the Edit window remains
where it is as the session plays. You can still move through the session
by sliding the scroll bar at the bottom of the window as the session plays.

You can set
the Edit

✦Scroll After Playback: Scroll After Playback keeps the Edit window
static as the session plays and immediately takes you to the current
location of the song after the session has stopped.
✦Page Scroll During Playback: Page scrolling during playback keeps the
cursor visible at all times as the session plays. As the cursor moves from
left to right, the window moves right.
This is the option I generally choose because I can easily keep track of
where I am in the session at all times.
Listening to playback loops
If you want to hear a specific section of a session over and over — to find
unidentifiable sounds, for example — you can create a playback loop. You
set this up by choosing Operations➪Loop Playback from the main menu, as
shown in Figure 4-8, or you can press Shift+Command+L or Ctrl+click the
Play button (on a Mac) or Shift+Ctrl+L or right-click the Play button (on a PC). 
Next, set the Start and End point of the loop. There are several ways to des-
ignate the Start and End points. These include:
✦Use the Start and End fields in the Expanded section of the Transport
window: Click in the Start and End fields and type in the Start and End
points of your loop.
✦Select a range in the track’s playlist or Timebase ruler (the timeline
near the top of the Edit window): Make sure that you have the Link Edit
and Timeline Selection option checked in the Operations menu. Then,
using the Selector tool, choose the range you want to loop, either in a
track or along the Timebase ruler by dragging the Selector from the Start
to End point.

✦Drag the playback markers in the Timebase ruler (timeline): Using the
Selector tool, click and drag the playback markers (also called Start and
End point markers). These are the blue arrows — or red if you have any
tracks record-enabled — at the beginning and end points of your loop.
You can move the markers either together or individually.
✦Use memory locators: Memory locators are user-assigned markers in
the song. (This option is covered in detail in Book 4, Chapter 3.)
Click the Play button in the Basic Controls section of the Transport window
to listen to the loop. 
Using the Scrub feature
The Scrub feature in Pro Tools — located in the Edit window — works just
like rocking the tape back and forth against the playback head of a reel-to-reel
tape machine. (A what?) Um, okay. If you don’t recall that bit of twentieth-
century technology, just trust me: Scrubbing was a way of listening to tiny
snippets of a recorded track by moving the tape only a little. You can listen to
a track by moving the cursor back and forth across the spot you want to hear.
You can hear it both forward and backward (in case you want to check the
secret backward message . . . just kidding). This is useful in finding a specific
note in the track — the hit of a snare drum, for instance. One of the great
things about the Pro Tools Scrub feature (as opposed to that of some other
recording programs) is that you can scrub at any speed by simply moving the
cursor at different speeds.
To scrub a track, follow these steps:
1. Click the Scrubber button from the top of the Edit window, as shown
in Figure 4-9.
The Scrubber button looks like a minispeaker emitting sound.
2. Click-and-drag over the waveform in a track to hear it played.

You can scrub two adjacent tracks at once by dragging the Scrubber at the
boundary between the two tracks.
Doing Additional Takes
Chances are that your first attempt at recording a track wasn’t as good as
you’d like. No problem. You can just do another take. This process is the
same as recording your first one, but Pro Tools offers some options that can
make it easy and fun to get the “perfect” performance. These include loop
recording, punching in and out — sometimes (if you’re really on the fly)
using the Pro Tools QuickPunch feature. Of course, you can always just
record the whole thing over again if you want. All these options are covered
in this section.
Starting over from scratch
Sometimes the best way to get it right is to start over. To record another take
of the entire session, click the Return to Zero button in the Basic Control
section of the Transport window to return to the beginning of the session.
Then follow the steps in the “Recording a single track” section, earlier in this
chapter. 
If you record in Destructive mode, any additional takes that you record onto
a track will erase the previous one. So, if you want to make sure that you
have a take for later, first make sure you’re not using Destructive mode when
you record over any existing takes on a track. Or you can create a new
playlist for that track before you record your next take. (See the “Recording
to Playlists” section, later in this chapter, for more on how to do that.)
Punching in and out
If you like some of your initial take and only want to record over part of it,
you can set points to start and stop this “recording over” within the session.
This is called punching in and out. 
Punching into or out of a track involves (first) setting a Start point and End
point. You can do that in one of several ways, as detailed in the next few
sections.
Before you create your Start and End points for a punch you need to decide
where these points are going to be. To make this decision you most likely
need to play the track back so you can hear where you want to punch. If
you’re not sure how to do this, the “Playing Back Your Tracks” section
earlier in this chapter gives you the details on this process.

Using the Start/End fields in the Transport 
To set the Start and End points in the Transport window, follow these steps:
1. Select the Expanded view option of the Transport window by choos-
ing Displays➪Transport Window Shows➪Expanded from the main
menu.
2. Click in the Start field in the Basic Controls section of the Transport
window and type in the beginning of the punch section you want. 
This field appears in the same format as the main counter. In the case of
Figure 4-10, it shows bars and beats.
3. Press Enter.
4. Click in the End field and type in the end of the range. 
This field, too, appears in the format selected for the main counter 
(as in Figure 4-10).
5. Press Enter. 
You’re now ready to perform a punch. Check out the “Performing the
punch” section, later in this chapter, for steps on how to actually per-
form the punch.
Selecting a section of a track’s playlist
The playlist section of the Edit window contains all the regions for the track.
You can make a selection within this playlist by following these steps: 
1. Choose Operations➪Link Edit and Timeline Selection from the main
menu. 
This ensures that when you make your selection in a track’s playlist, the
Start and End point markers in the Timebase ruler follow along. 
2. Using the Selector tool, click and drag over the section in your track
you want to record over, as shown in Figure 4-11.

This highlights the selection and positions the Start point at the begin-
ning of your selection and the End point at the end.
You’re now ready to perform a punch. Go to the “Performing the punch” sec-
tion later in this chapter for steps on how to actually perform the punch.
Dragging the Start and End Point markers along the ruler bar
The Start and End Point markers are located along the Timebase ruler in the
Edit window and appear as Up and Down arrows — down for punch in and
up for punch out. The flags are colored blue when no tracks are record-
enabled and red when one or more tracks are record-enabled. Setting Start
and End Point markers in the Ruler bar consists of these steps:
1. Choose Operations➪Link Edit and Timeline Selection from the main
menu. 
This makes sure that when you drag the markers along the ruler bar the
corresponding section in the track’s playlist are selected as well.
2. If you want the markers to snap to the grid, click on the Grid button
in the upper-left of the Edit window to select the Grid Edit mode; 
otherwise use any other Edit mode.
3. Using the Selector tool, click and drag the Start and End Point arrows
to where you want them, as shown in Figure 4-12.
You’re now ready to perform a punch. The “Performing the punch” section,
later in this chapter, lays out steps on how to actually perform the punch.
If you want to select the entire length of the session, double-click one of the
arrows.

Performing the punch
Once you have set the Start and End points for your punch (whether in 
or out), you can record to that section by doing the following:
1. Set and enable a pre-roll by clicking in the Pre-Roll field in the
expanded Transport window (choose Displays➪Transport Window
Shows➪Expanded View to get there) and typing in the amount of
pre-roll you want. 
When you’ve done so, you can hear the previously recorded track before
the punch-in happens.
2. Set and enable a post-roll by clicking in the Post-Roll field in the
expanded Transport window (choose Displays➪Transport Window
Shows➪Expanded View to get there) and typing in the amount you
want for your post-roll. 
Doing so lets you hear how your punch fits in with the previously
recorded track.
3. Choose either Non-Destructive or Destructive Record mode. 
Non-Destructive Record mode is the default mode and is active if you
have a Record button without any icon in it. The Destructive Record
mode is selected from the Operations menu (choose Operations➪
Destructive Record from the main menu). When you have this mode
selected a small “D” is visible in the center of the Record button in the
Transport window.
4. Click the Record Enable button for the track you want to record onto. 
The button will shine red. 
Only use the Destructive Record mode if you’re really sure you don’t
want to keep the previous take in the selected section.
5. Click the Record button. 
The Record light flashes red.

6. Click the Play button when you’re ready to record.
The session will start at the pre-roll time, the Record button will flash
red, and you’ll hear the previously recorded track until the pre-roll is
over. The monitoring will switch to the input source and the Record light
stops flashing — but remains red.
When you hit the end of the recording range, the session either stops play-
ing or — if you have the post-roll enabled — stops recording. At that point,
the Record button starts flashing again — and the monitoring switches back
to the recorded region until the end of the post-roll period. When the session
reaches that point, it stops playing.
Loop recording
Loop recording lets you choose a section of the song to repeatedly record
over. This makes it easy to try a bunch of takes without having to manually
start and stop each time through the section. Loop recording can be done a
bunch of ways. I described one in Book 4, Chapter 3, but here’s another:
1. Choose Operations➪Link Edit and Timeline Selection from the main
menu. 
This insures that when you make a selection in either the Timebase ruler
or within a track’s playlist, both are selected. 
2. Click on the Selector tool at the top of the Edit window to select it.
3. Using the Selector tool, click and drag across the section of the track
that you want to record over.
4. Record-enable the track by clicking the Record Enable button in the
Track Controls section of the Edit window.
5. Select the Loop record mode by either choosing Operations➪Loop
Record, pressing Option+L (on a Mac) or Alt+L (on a PC), or by
Ctrl+clicking (on a Mac) or right-clicking (on a PC) the Record button
in the Basic Controls section of the Transport window until the Loop
Record icon shows up. 
6. Click the Record button in the Basic Controls section of the Transport
window to prepare the session to record.
7. Click Play in the Basic Controls section of the Transport window to
start recording.
If you designated a pre-roll, it will only happen before the first time through
the loop. After that, the loop goes from Start point to End point, back to Start
points, and so on.

Using QuickPunch
If you have a bunch of sections that you want to replace in a track (say, a
bunch of guitar counter points to support the lead vocal) and you want to
record the new parts in just one pass of the session, you can use QuickPunch
mode.
Setting up for QuickPunch
Setting up for QuickPunch requires these steps:
1. Click the Return to Zero button in Basic Controls section of the
Transport window to return to the beginning of the session.
2. Record enable the track(s) you want to fix by clicking the Record
Enable button for each track in the Track Controls section of the Edit
window.
3. Set the Record mode to QuickPunch by choosing
Operations➪QuickPunch, Ctrl+clicking (on a Mac) or right-clicking
(on a PC) the Record button, or pressing Shift+Command+P (on a Mac)
or Shift+Ctrl+P (on a PC). 
The QuickPunch (P) icon appears in the Record button.
4. Click the Play button to start the session.
The Record button flashes as the session plays and you hear the previ-
ously recorded track in the monitors.
5. Click the Record button when you want to punch in. 
The Record button stops flashing and recording starts immediately.
Monitoring switches from what’s recorded to what’s coming in; you hear
the input source.
6. Click the Record button again to stop recording. 
The button begins flashing again and monitoring switches back to the
recorded track.
You can repeat this procedure up to 100 times per session (probably enough
to fix that pesky track, huh?).
Overdubbing: Recording additional tracks
Overdubbing is the process of adding tracks to those you’ve already recorded.
This is the mainstay of the home recordist’s recording repertoire; it allows
you to play all (or as many as you want) of the instruments in your song. You
can start with the drum tracks, add some bass guitar, then some rhythm
guitar, and later the lead vocals, and so on.

Book III
Chapter 4
Recording Audio
Doing Additional Takes
305
The process of overdubbing is similar to recording your first track except
you have to be able to hear the other tracks and synchronize to them as you
play. The main things to be concerned about when you overdub are these:
✦Creating a monitoring mix: Take some time to create a mix of the previ-
ously recorded tracks that you can hear as you record so you have a
blend that inspires you to perform your best. Depending on your
system, you may not be able to add any effects to your mix, but getting
the right balance between instruments can really help your recording.
(Check out Book 6 for more on mixing.)
✦Getting into the groove: Make sure that you have the least amount of
latency in your system when overdubbing; otherwise it can really mess
up the groove. Book 3, Chapter 3 (the previous chapter) covers this in
detail — and it’s especially important for instruments with a fast attack
and decay such as drums and percussion (they sound awful when
they’re slightly out of time).
The M-box, because it’s a USB interface, has a noticeable latency no matter
what buffer setting you choose for your hardware. This latency can simply
be too much for some critical instruments, so Digidesign has implemented a
monitoring setup that lets you monitor the input of the M-Box while hearing
the output of your recorded tracks, which reduces the latency. To set up your
M-box monitoring to record without hearing latency, follow these steps:
1. Click the Mute button located in the Track Controls section of the Edit
window to mute the track you’re overdubbing onto.
This keeps you from hearing the track as it comes back out of the system.
2. Click the Mono switch on the M-box. 
This allows both the input and the recorded tracks to play through both
speakers. If this switch isn’t depressed, you hear the input in one ear only.
3. Adjust the Mix knob on the front of the M-Box to blend your input
with the tracks playing in the session.
You need to do this when the session is playing and you’re playing your
instrument at the same time so you can hear both the recorded tracks
and your input. Try a test run-through to get a balance before you actu-
ally record.
After you’ve recorded your overdubbed track, you need to move it to a posi-
tion that’s 164 samples earlier in the Edit window. These 164 samples are the
exact amount of time that it takes for the sound to go through the Mbox and
into Pro Tools. Follow these steps:

Doing Additional Takes
306
1. Click on the Grabber tool (it looks like a small hand) at the top of the
Edit window.
Using this tools lets you “grab” the region you want to move.
2. Click and drag to highlight the overdubbed track.
3. Choose Edit➪Shift from the main menu or press Option+H (on a Mac)
or Alt+H (on a PC). 
The Shift dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 4-13.
4. Check Earlier in the top box and type 164 into the Samples field at the
bottom. 
This moves your overdubbed material the exact amount of the latency
introduced by the Mbox when you recorded.
5. Click OK.
To make sure each overdubbed track lines up with the first track, you need
to shift each overdubbed track over immediately after you record it (or at
least before you record another overdub). This ensures that all the previ-
ously recorded tracks you’re hearing are lined up with the first track when
you record a new one.
Recording to playlists
Whenever you have material recorded to a track, it exists within the Edit
window as a playlist. This playlist contains all the regions (representations
of the actual audio on your hard drive) that are currently in a track. One of
the nice things about Pro Tools is that you can create a bunch of separate
playlists for a track and swap them in and out of the track. Whichever of a
track’s playlists is in the Timebase ruler section of the Edit window is the
one that is heard when your session is playing back.

box to

Playlists are handy for keeping all of your takes organized and it also lets you
record additional takes on a track even when you’re using Destructive Record
mode. You can create a new playlist by clicking the little arrows next to the
track’s name in the Track Controls section of the Edit window. This opens a
pop-up menu for a track, as shown in Figure 4-14.
To record to this playlist, follow the steps in the “Recording a single track”
section earlier in this chapter.
Auditioning takes
After you record a bunch of takes of a track, you can audition them to see
which one you prefer in one of three ways: from the Audio Regions list, from
the Take List drop-down menu, and from the track’s playlist. You can also set
preferences for viewing takes of a track and you can audition takes from mul-
tiple tracks at once. All these options are covered in this section. 
Auditioning from the Audio Regions List
You can take regions from the Audio Regions list located at the right side of
the Edit window (if this list isn’t visible click the double arrow at the bottom-
right corner of the Edit window) and drag them directly into a track’s playlist
(the regions that represent the audio for a track) located to the right of the
Track Controls section of the Edit window. 
1. Click the Grabber button in the Edit window to select the Grabber
tool.
2. Click the current take in the track’s playlist, as shown in Figure 4-15. 
The playlist in a track consists of all the regions that you can see in the
session.

The region is placed in a track and is ready to play. 
Auditioning from the Takes List pop-up menu
You can audition your takes by opening a pop-up menu that has a list of all
the takes for a punch or loop recording session. This options lets you freely
switch the takes as the session plays. This section outlines the procedures. 
1. Click the Selector button in the Edit window to choose the Selector

You can also click the precise Start point of the punch or loop range in
the track’s playlist or along the Timebase ruler without first selecting
the track.
3. Choose the take you want to hear from the Takes List pop-up menu.
This take will replace the previous one and be placed at its correct posi-
tion in the session.
You can follow the steps for both of these approaches if you want to audition
more takes.
Using the Takes List pop-up menu, you can choose and change takes even as
the session is playing.
The different takes are listed in the order they were recorded — but if you
start moving them around, you can identify them by the time stamp created
when you recorded the take.
Choosing from a track’s playlist
The track’s playlist contains the regions located in a track. The playlist is
located to the right of the Track Controls for each track and represents the
audio data for the track. To audition tracks from a track’s playlist, click in
the little arrows next to the track’s name in the Track Controls section of the
Edit window to open the playlist pop-up menu and then choose the playlist
to play, as shown in Figure 4-18. The name of the track changes to the name
in the chosen playlist.
Choosing your take’s preferences
You can use the “Matching Start Time” Takes List section of the Edit tab of
the Preferences dialog box (shown in Figure 4-19) to choose which takes get
listed in the Takes List pop-up menu. (To access the Preferences dialog box,
choose Setups➪Preferences from the main menu.) 
Figure 4-17:

The Takes List options include the following:
✦Take Region Name(s) That Match Track Names: Checking this box
ensures that only takes from the same track are present.
✦Take Region Lengths That Match: Checking this option only shows
takes that are the same length as the one presently in the track.
✦“Separate Region” Operates on All Related Tracks: If you check this
box, all takes with the same User Time Stamp are edited when you use
the Separate Region command for the track.
Auditioning takes from multiple tracks at one time
If you want to audition takes from multiple tracks at once — when recording
drums to several tracks at a time, for example — follow these steps:
1. Check both the Take Region Name(s) That Match Track Names and the
Take Regions Lengths That Match options in the “Matching Start
Time” Takes List section of the Edit tab of the Preferences dialog box
(see previous section).
2. Click the Selector button in the Edit window to choose the Selector
tool.

3. Using the Selector tool, drag across all the tracks for the range you
want to replace, as shown in Figure 4-20.
4. Command-click (on a Mac) or Ctrl+click (on a PC) one of the tracks
within that selected region.
The Takes List pop-up menu appears. Takes that match the preferences
set in Step 1 show up in the list.
5. Choose a region (take) from the list. 
Getting Rid of Unwanted Takes
If you have a take (recorded performance) that you don’t like, you can get
rid of it in one of several ways. You can cancel the take as you’re recording,
undo the take after you’ve recorded it, or clear the audio region from the
Audio Regions list. All of these options are detailed in this section.
Canceling your performance
Canceling a performance is handy when you’re in the middle of recording
and you know you’re not going to keep the take (for example, the mail
arrived and the dog went ballistic in the middle of your vocal). To cancel 
a performance, simply press Command+period (on a Mac) or Alt+period 
(on a PC). This stops the session and clears the audio region created for this
take with one stroke.
Figure 4-20:

Getting Rid of Unwanted Takes
312
You can’t use this command if you record in Destructive Record mode.
Undoing your take
If you’ve already stopped recording and you know that you don’t want to
keep your latest try, you can undo the take by choosing Edit➪Undo Record
Audio from the main menu, as shown in Figure 4-21, or by pressing
Command+Z (on a Mac) or Ctrl+Z (on a PC).
If you used QuickPunch mode, only the last punch will be undone. If you
used Loop Record mode, on the other hand, all the looped passes will be
undone. And if you used Destructive Record mode, your previous take will
have already been erased when you recorded — so undoing the last take will
leave you with nothing on that track.
Clearing the file from the Audio Regions list
If you decide, after hearing a few of your takes, that you want to get rid of
one or more of them, you can clear the take(s) from the Audio Regions list.
The following steps show how:

ard-disk recording — in general, and with Pro Tools specifically —
makes the process of editing audio fast and easy. In days of old, if you
wanted to remove a bad note or shoddy drum hit, you had to break out a
razor blade and some sticky tape, prepare the offending segment of mag-
netic tape for surgery, hold your breath, and apply a steady hand. Any
changes to the recorded tracks got you into a messy, inexact, time-consum-
ing process that many engineers weren’t very good at. Even the steadiest
hands couldn’t come close to the accuracy and variety now available 
(to even the clumsiest of the bunch) through the editing functions of the
new digital gear.
This chapter gets you started on the process of editing audio in Pro Tools.
First you get to know the basic ways that Pro Tools does editing — in partic-
ular, the role of audio regions (representations of your audio files in the Edit
window). This chapter then guides you through finding and viewing regions
so making edits is quick and easy. You also discover the joys of using
playlists to work with these regions. And as if all that wasn’t enough, this
chapter also explains the four different edit modes available in Pro Tools.
Understanding Pro Tools Editing
Editing in Pro Tools on your computer is similar to working with any hard-
disk recorder — often it’s much easier. Two things about editing in Pro Tools
make it fast, easy, and (from the viewpoint of your creative work) safe. First,
unless you specify otherwise, it’s nondestructive; you can always undo your
edit if you don’t like it. Second, you can perform most editing functions in
Pro Tools while your session is playing back. Both these features are detailed
in this section.

Getting to Know Region Types
318
Nondestructive editing
Nondestructive editing means your original audio files are not changed when
you edit an audio region. Most editing functions in Pro Tools — for example,
clearing, cutting, pasting, separating, and trimming your audio regions — are
nondestructive. (All these operations are explained in Book 4, Chapter 2.)
Not all Pro Tool editing procedures are nondestructive. A few are destruc-
tive; they will permanently alter your source audio file. Whenever I describe
one of these procedures, I’ll warn you — with a Warning icon — that once
you perform the function, your source file will be changed. To make things
even safer (and so you don’t have to memorize all the instances in which
edits are destructive), Pro Tools warns you automatically — a dialog box
appears, asking whether you want to continue.
Editing during playback
Most editing functions can be carried out while the session is playing. This
feature makes editing much faster and easier because you can instantly hear
(and see) what your changes have done. Some of these edits include
✦Capturing, separating, and trimming regions
✦Nudging, placing, rearranging, or spotting regions
✦Creating fades or crossfades in and between regions (version 6.0 and
higher)
✦Auditioning playlists
✦Editing automation data
✦Inserting RealTime plug-ins (version 6.0 and higher)
✦Processing audio using Audio Suite plug-ins
You can find out more about these functions throughout this chapter and
the next three chapters (Book 4, Chapter 2, Book 4, Chapter 3, and Book 4,
Chapter 4). 
You can’t, however, perform any routing changes (change send assignments)
or alter inputs or outputs while playing your session.
Getting to Know Region Types
When you record a track, a new audio region is created in the track’s
playlist — the track displays you see next to the Track Controls section in
the Edit window. This region corresponds to an audio file of that perform-
ance, which resides on your hard drive. When you perform edits to your
recorded performances you do so by making changes to these regions.

Book IV
Chapter 1
Audio Editing
Basics
Getting to Know Region Types
319
Both edited and unedited regions appear on the Audio Regions list, the
handy list you find to the right of the track playlist. (If the Audio Regions list
isn’t visible click the double arrow at the far bottom-right of the Edit window
to open it.) Several region types show up in the list, indicating the entire audio
file or a portion of it. You can choose Whole-File, User-Defined, Auto-Created,
Offline, and Stereo audio regions. The following list gives you details on each
region type:
✦Whole-File: Whole-File audio regions represent entire audio files
recorded to your hard drive. Displayed in bold letters in the Audio
Regions list, they’re created when you do one of four things:
• First record an audio track
• Import an audio file from outside the session
• Consolidate existing regions
• Nondestructively process audio using an Audio Suite plug-in
✦User-Defined: User-defined regions are created when you do one of
three things:
• Rename an existing region
• Capture, record, consolidate, or separate audio regions
• Trim a Whole-File region
✦Auto-Created: These regions are automatically created when you edit a
region or punch-record over one. The more takes you record of your
tracks — and the more edits you do — the more these regions add up.
To keep your Audio Regions list from becoming cluttered, you can hide
your Auto-Created regions easily — or you can convert them into full-
fledged User-Defined regions by renaming them.
✦Offline: These regions can’t be linked to an audio file on your hard
drive, usually because Pro Tools can’t find the original file. In the Audio
Regions list, the names of these regions are displayed in dimmed italics;
in the track’s playlist, they show up in blue italics. You can generally edit
these regions as you would any other region — except you can’t process
them using Audio Suite plug-ins.
✦Stereo: These audio regions are associated with a stereo file. If you click
the triangle to the left of the region name, you can see the two mono
channels (one for each side) listed. These individual channels can be
dragged onto separate tracks if you choose.

Viewing Regions
320
Viewing Regions
You can customize the way you view audio regions a number of ways in Pro
Tools — select the track view, change the track height, assign name and time
locations, zoom in and out. These options get a closer look in this section.
Selecting the track view
By default, audio tracks in the Edit window are set to Waveform. This view
shows a visual representation of the sound produced by the audio file associ-
ated with a particular region. Pro Tools also gives you the option of ditching
the Waveform view and going with something different. You switch between
different views with the help of the Regions View menu shown in Figure 1-1,
which you access by clicking and holding the Regions View display in the
Track Controls section of the Edit window. Your options are as follows: 
✦Block: Block view shows a blank box for each audio region. This view
makes screen redraws much quicker (useful during mixing when all the
editing is done and you don’t need to see the waveform).
✦Waveform: Waveform is the default view — a graphical representation of
the audio file, much like what you’d see if you ran a sound through an
oscilloscope. This is the best view to be in when you’re editing regions
because you can easily find the start of a note. After a while, you’ll prob-
ably be able to almost hear the track by looking at the waveform.
Besides being able to see waveforms in their normal way — with both
positive and negative values — you can choose the Draw Waveforms
Rectified option, which displays the waveform as a combined positive
value. This can be useful when you want to create volume automation to
increase or reduce specific notes (such as, respectively, a weak or very
loud drum hit). To get that rectified look, check the Draw Waveforms
Regions View Selector button

Rectified box on the Display tab of the Preferences dialog box. (You
know the drill: Choose Setups➪Preferences from the main menu to get
to the Preferences dialog box.)
✦Volume: This view shows the volume level of the track. The volume level
is displayed as a line superimposed over the waveform. In this view, the
region’s name is hidden.
✦Mute: This view shows whether the track is muted. When a track is
muted, the line shows at the bottom of the view; when the track is
unmuted, the line shows at the top. If a track uses automatic muting, a
vertical line shows where the mute is turned on or off. This view also
shows the waveform in the background.
✦Pan: Pan view shows the apparent position of the track’s output from
left to right (pan) in the stereo sound. When the track is panned in the
center, the line is centered in the view. Far-left panning shows up at the
top; far-right is on the bottom. Settings in between these two extremes
correspond to the pan value. In this view you can also see a waveform
display in the background. 
You can toggle between Waveform and Volume views by highlighting the
track and pressing Ctrl+Minus/Dash on a Mac or Start/Windows+Minus/Dash
on a PC.
Adjusting the track height
Pro Tools lets you choose from various track heights, including Mini, Small,
Medium, Large, Jumbo, and Extreme. This lets you make tracks you’re not
editing small while the tracks you want to edit can be made big enough so
that you can really get in close to a waveform when you edit. You choose
your various track heights from the Track Height pop-up menu, which you
can access one of two ways:
✦From the Track Height Selector button in the Track Controls section of
the Edit window: Click and hold with the mouse pointer over the button
(it looks like a “>”) to make the Track Height pop-up menu appear, as
shown in Figure 1-2. Choose the size you want.
✦From the far-right edge of the Track Controls section: Choose the track
height you want by clicking-holding with the mouse pointer over the
little ruler at the far side of the Track Controls section (as in Figure 1-3)
and selecting an option from the Track Height pop-up menu that
appears.
For stereo tracks, you can choose an expanded view that allows you to view
each channel separately. If you edit the channels individually and they end
up being different lengths, these stereo tracks will become two mono tracks
instead.

Viewing Regions

Assigning region-name and time-location displays
Every audio region has a region name and time stamp attached to it. You can
choose whether this information shows up on the region displays in your
tracks.
Displaying region names
You can choose to show or hide the name of the regions in the track displays
by checking or unchecking the Display Name in Regions option under the
Display menu, as shown in Figure 1-4.
Choosing region time stamps
You can choose any of several Time Stamp views from the Display Time in
Regions option, which is also under the Display menu (see Figure 1-5). Your
options include these:

Zooming in and out
You can zoom in and out of all tracks using the Zoom buttons at the top of
the Edit window (see Figure 1-7) or you can zoom in and out of a single track
by using the Zoom tool (see Figure 1-8). You can also zoom in on the ruler
and toggle the zoom back and forth between unzoomed and zoomed. Being
able to zoom way in to a region lets you make precise edits to the waveform.
Zooming in on all tracks using the Zoom buttons
The Zoom buttons section of the Edit window has buttons that allow you to
zoom in and out both horizontally and vertically, as well as buttons for creat-
ing zoom presets for levels that you use frequently. The following list gives
you the details on each feature:
✦Horizontal Zoom: The outer two Zoom buttons control how wide a por-
tion of the timeline — and of all audio and MIDI tracks and regions —
you can see on-screen. Clicking the left button gives you a narrower
view; clicking the right button gives you a wider view.
✦Vertical Zoom: To zoom vertically in on audio tracks, click the top or
bottom part of the button with the waveform icon (at the left of the
window). Clicking the top of the button increases the height of the dis-
play in the track’s view; clicking the bottom decreases the height. Keep
in mind that increasing the vertical zoom may make the waveform too
big to fit in the track display. If this is the case, you can increase the
Zoom buttons

track’s height as described in the “Adjusting the track height” section,
earlier in this chapter.
✦Zoom Presets: At the bottom of the Zoom buttons section are five pre-
sets that work like the presets on your car radio. To assign a setting to a
Preset button, just get the Zoom setting you want — kind of like tuning
your car radio to the station you want — and then Command+Click (on a
Mac) or Ctrl+Click (on a PC) the Preset button. Then repeat the steps for
the other four Preset buttons.
You can select a preset in any of several ways:
• Click the numbered Preset button you want in the Zoom Buttons sec-
tion of the Edit window.
• Press the number of the Preset button you want on your keyboard
while pressing the Start/Windows key on a PC or the Ctrl key on 
a Mac.
• With Command Keyboard Focus (Commands Focus) enabled, press
the number of the Preset number you want on the number pad of
your keyboard. (You enable Command Keyboard Focus by clicking
the Command Keyboard Focus button, shown here in the margin.)
Zooming in on a single track using the Zoom tool
The Zoom tool lets you select a specific spot in a track to zoom in and out of.
The Zoom tool has two modes: Normal and Single Zoom. 
✦Normal Zoom Mode. You can zoom in and out both horizontally and
vertically on the waveform when using this mode.
• Zoom horizontally: First click the Zoom Tool button, shown here in
the margin, to select the Zoom tool. Then click and drag a section to
select it, as shown in Figure 1-8. Pro Tools zooms to that section. To
zoom in farther, click and drag again.
Figure 1-8:

326
• Zoom vertically and horizontally: Press Command on a Mac or Ctrl
on a PC and then click and drag the section, as shown in Figure 1-9.
Pro Tools zooms in. Repeat to zoom in farther.
To zoom out again, press the Option key while you click the zoomed
area. Each click moves you out a little bit.
✦Single Zoom Mode: If you’re in Single Zoom mode when you finish zoom-
ing in on a spot, Pro Tools switches you back to the tool you were using
previously. For example, if you want to scrub a section of a track and
need to zoom in to get a more-accurate Start point, you can use the
Single Zoom mode of the Zoom tool to zoom in. Once you’re zoomed in,
you automatically return to the Scrub tool. 
You can select Single Zoom mode one of two ways:
• Click and hold the Zoom Tool button (shown here in the margin) and
select the Single Zoom option.
• Click the Zoom Tool button and press F5 on your keyboard to toggle
back and forth between Zoom Tool modes.
No matter which method you choose to select Single Zoom mode, once
you are in this mode, the Zoom Tool button changes its face to look like
what you see here in the margin.
Zooming in on the ruler
If you have a spot in your session (the start of the chorus, for example) 
that you want to zoom into, you can use the ruler bar (where the location of
your session is displayed) to select your zoom location. This is done by
Command+Ctrl+clicking (on a Mac) or Ctrl+Alt+clicking (on a PC) over a
section of the ruler to zoom in one level. You can also drag over a section 
of the ruler while holding the Command and Ctrl (on a Mac) or Ctrl and Alt
(on a PC) keys.

Zooming with the Zoom Toggle command
The Zoom Toggle command takes a selection, increases the track’s height to
Large, and fills the window. This command makes zooming quick by using
just one keystroke. This is a great function to use when you edit parts and
need to get in really close to make an accurate edit, and then move out fur-
ther in order to find the next spot to edit. To use the Zoom Toggle command,
follow these steps:
1. Choose the Selector tool by clicking it at the top of the Edit window.
2. Using the Selector tool, select a portion of one or more tracks.
3. Press Ctrl+E on a Mac or Start/Windows+E on a PC. 
The track height changes to the Large setting (see the “Adjusting the track
height” section, earlier in the chapter) and the selection fills the space.
4. Repeat this command to return to the previous view.
If you want to change the default height for the Toggle Zoom to something
other than Large, you can do so using the Zoom Toggle Track Height drop-
down menu (it’s on the Display tab of the Preferences dialog box, as shown in
Figure 1-10). Choose Setups➪Preferences from the main menu to call up the
Preferences dialog box; there you can select any of the possible Track Height
options.
Understanding Edit Modes
Pro Tools offers four basic Edit modes; the mode you use depends on the
task you want to perform. You get a chance to dig pretty deep into these
Edit modes in the next chapter, but here’s a basic overview of each of them.
Figure 1-11 shows all four Edit Mode buttons — Shuffle, Spot, Slip, and 
Grid — all nicely lined up on the toolbar — and coming right up is a list that
gives you a taste of what each mode can do for you.
Figure 1-10:

Understanding Edit Modes
328
✦Shuffle: Shuffle mode allows you to move a region around in an audio
track, automatically placing it at the end of the nearest region. This is a
handy way to move regions around if you want to experiment with alter-
nate arrangements of a song. For example, you can move the second bar
of a four-bar phrase to the last bar by grabbing it and sliding it over to
the end. The third bar will move to replace the second and the second
bar will snap right to the end of the fourth. Presto — new arrangement.
✦Spot: In Spot mode, you can designate the exact timeline placement of a
region you want to move. Click to engage Spot mode, and then click a
region (which brings up the Spot dialog box, as shown in Figure 1-12).
Enter the place you want to move the region to in the appropriate field
and then click OK.
If you want to move the region back to its original place, you can click
the arrow to the right of the Original Time Stamp field in the Spot
dialog box.

329
✦Slip: Slip mode lets you move regions anywhere you want within the
playlist. You can have regions overlap or leave space between them, for
instance. To move a region using Slip mode, click and hold over the
region and drag it to where you want it. 
✦Grid: Moving a region using Grid mode snaps the region to the prede-
fined time grid. Grid mode is useful if you want to quickly move a drum
part over a beat, for example. Starting with version 6.0, Grid mode gives
you two different options: Absolute and Relative. To choose one of these
modes, click and hold the Grid button and choose the one you want.
Here’s what they offer you:
• Absolute Grid Mode: When using Absolute Grid mode, if you move a
region that doesn’t begin where the grid resides — on the & of 1
when the grid is set to 1/4 notes, for example — the region will snap
to the resolution of the grid. 
This isn’t a good mode to use if you have a region that starts on the
& of 1 (1/8 note before the downbeat) with a 1/4 note grid and you
want the region to fit in the measure the same way after moving it.
• Relative Grid Mode: In Relative Grid mode, you move regions by the
unit of the grid (1/4 notes, for example). So, in the example of a
region starting on the & of 1 with a grid resolution of 1/4 notes, the
region will move over by the grid value (1/4 notes), leaving the start
time of the region on the & of the beat.
This Grid Mode is useful for moving a drum hit over and having it fit
within the grid — even if its start point doesn’t originally match the
grid itself.
Setting the Grid resolution
Setting the resolution of the Grid is an outrageously handy tool for precision-
tweaking the rhythms of your track. If you decide to go the Grid Mode route,
you can set the resolution of the grid that you work in by following these
steps:
1. Click-hold on the Grid Value window, located under the Edit tools in
the main Edit window, as shown in Figure 1-13.
The Grid Resolution menu appears, offering you choices for the resolu-
tion of your grid — 1/2 notes, 1/4 notes, 1/16 notes, whatever.

Understanding Edit Modes
330
2. Drag to the resolution you want.
Within this menu you can also choose the time scale you want the grid in
and whether you want the grid to follow the main time scale.
Displaying the grid lines
Again, if you want to work in Grid mode, it might help if you can actually see
the grid lines in the Edit window: You can get them to display by using one of
two methods:
✦Check the Draw Grids in Edit Window check box in the Display tab of the
Preferences dialog box, as shown in Figure 1-14. (Call up the Preferences
dialog box by choosing Setups➪Preferences from the main menu.) 
✦With the Grid Edit mode enabled, click the Timeline Ruler button to
toggle the grid on and off, as shown in Figure 1-15.

Working (Okay, Playing) with Playlists
The Edit playlists within your tracks consist of various arrangements of the
regions within a track. Each track can have one or more regions that you can
arrange in any order that you want using the Edit modes listed in the previ-
ous section. Edit playlists allow you to experiment with different arrange-
ments of regions within a track — and you can still change them at will by
switching to another playlist. This is handy if you want to try different
arrangements of songs and easily compare them without having to create
copies of entire sessions (as you would with some other programs).
Edit playlists are accessed by clicking the Playlist selector in the Track sec-
tion of the Edit window, as shown in Figure 1-16. The menu called up by the
Playlist selector, shown in all its glory in Figure 1-17, lets you choose from
the various playlists, as well as letting you create, duplicate, or delete them. 
Click here to open the Playlist pop-up menu.

Creating a new playlist
When you record or import audio into a track, you automatically create an
empty playlist. With this new playlist you can import audio regions, drag
those regions in, or copy and paste them from other tracks. You can create
additional playlists by opening the Playlist drop-down menu — done by
clicking the Playlist selector next to the track’s name in the Track Controls
section of the Edit window — and choosing New. (Refer to Figure 1-17.)
Duplicating a playlist
Being able to duplicate a playlist makes creating different arrangements of a
track or making edits to the regions in a playlist easy. Instead of creating a
new blank playlist, you’re starting from one you’ve already created. To dupli-
cate a playlist, click and hold with the mouse pointer over the playlist drop-
down menu and choose Duplicate. You get the option of naming the new
playlist or going with the default.
Deleting a playlist
Playlists take up no space on your hard drive so you don’t need to delete
them to free up space, but if you want to delete a playlist from a session,
follow these steps:
1. Make sure that the playlist you want to delete isn’t the active one in
the track.
2. Open the track’s playlist menu by clicking the Playlist selector — 
the arrows located next to the track’s name in the Track Controls
section of the Edit window.
3. Select Delete Unused. 
A menu opens, listing all playlists in the track (except the currently
assigned playlist).
4. Select the playlist you want to delete from the list.
If you want to delete more than one, press and hold the Shift key as you
select the playlists.

5. Click OK. 
The selected playlist is deleted.
You can’t undo this operation.
Renaming playlists
To rename the current playlist in a track, double-click the name of the track
where the playlist resides, and then type in a new name.
Choosing playlists
You can choose the playlist that appears in a track by clicking the Playlist
selector (the arrows located next to the track’s name in the Track Controls
section of the Edit window) and dragging to the playlist you want. The name
of the playlist then shows up as the track’s name.
Using the Audio Regions List
All the audio regions in your session are displayed in the Audio Regions list,
located on the right side of your Edit or Mix window, as shown in Figure 1-18.
From this list you can
✦Drag a region into a track.
✦Drag to rearrange regions in the list.
✦Audition any region by Alt+clicking (on a PC) or Option+clicking 
(on a Mac) a region in the list.
Once you start recording, importing, and editing regions in your session, you
can start accumulating regions in this list very quickly. Fortunately, Pro Tools
helps you keep track of them by displaying region types differently. The “dis-
tinguishing marks” are as follows:
Figure 1-18:
The Audio
Regions list
shows all
the regions
in a session.

Using the Audio Regions List
334
✦Whole File regions are in bold.
✦Auto-Defined and User-Defined regions are in regular text.
✦Offline regions are in italics.
✦Stereo regions contain two mono regions that can be expanded by click-
ing the triangle to the left of the region name.
Selecting regions
You can select single or multiple regions from the Audio Regions list several
ways.
✦To select a single region, you have one option: Click a single region. It
becomes highlighted. Then click to put a check in the box next to Region
List Selection Follows Track Selection in the Edit tab of the Preferences
dialog box (that’s the dialog box you get by choosing Setups➪Preferences
from the main menu). Voilá — the track containing this region becomes
highlighted to show it’s selected.
✦To select a range of contiguous regions, you have two choices:
• With the cursor on the left of the Audio Regions list (a marquee will
appear) click-drag across the regions you want to select.
• Shift+click to the left of the first and last region names for a group of
regions. All the regions in between these two will be selected.
✦To select multiple regions that aren’t next to one another, you have two
methods to choose from:
• With the cursor located to the left of the region (a marquee will
appear), Command+click each region. (Got it, Mac fans?)
• For all you PC people, Shift+click over the name of each region.
Using the Audio Regions list pop-up menu
Audio regions can also be managed from the pop-up menu located at the top
of the Audio Regions list, as shown in Figure 1-19. (The Audio Regions list is
located at the right side of the Edit window. If it isn’t visible, click the double
arrow at the bottom-right corner of the Edit window to open it.) Open this
menu by clicking and holding the Audio Regions title at the top of the Audio
regions list. Many of the functions in this menu are covered in this section.

Sorting regions
After you start editing in earnest, the regions in the Audio Regions list start
adding up. The only way to be able to keep track of them is by being able to
sort them. Pro Tools offers you several ways to sort, including by name, by
time stamp (when it was recorded), by length, and a host of others. To sort
regions from the Audio Regions pop-up menu, choose Sorting from the menu
and choose one of the many options pictured in Figure 1-20.
Finding regions
You can find regions in the list by selecting Find from the Audio Regions pop-
up menu. When you do this, a dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 1-21,
where you can enter part of a word or a whole word for the region you want
to find.

Displaying region information
Besides displaying just the region’s name — the default for the Audio
Regions list — you can have Pro Tools display some additional information
about the region in the playlist section of the track:
✦The complete path of the region’s location. Choose the Show Full Path
option under the Audio Regions list pop-up menu. Open this menu by
click-holding the Audio Regions title at the top of the Audio Regions list
located on the right side of the Edit window. (If this list isn’t visible, click
the double arrow at the bottom-right corner of the Edit window.)
✦The name of the file where the audio region is located. Choose Show
File Name under the Audio Regions list pop-up menu.
✦The name of the hard disk where the file is located. To see this infor-
mation, choose Show Disk Names under the Audio Regions list pop-up
menu.
Managing Undos
Here’s the realm where digital editing saves you vast quantities of time,
hassle, and frustration: Pro Tools lets you undo operations that you perform
in your sessions. This gives you vast flexibility and offers at least some
safety net when you start messing around with your songs.
Setting levels of Undo
Prior to version 6.1, Pro Tools offered up to 16 levels of Undo. 6.1 and up
offers up to 32 levels of Undo. You don’t have to use them all, though. In fact,
if you have minimal memory in your computer, performing operations such
as edits in Pro Tools will quickly fill it up and really slow things down, or, if
Figure 1-21:
Here you
type a word
or part of a
word of the
region you
want to find.

Book IV
Chapter 1
Audio Editing
Basics
Managing Undos
337
your memory is really low, it prevents you from performing an edit at all.
This is because all your previous edits are stored in RAM, right up to the
number you specified under your preferences. 
Luckily, Pro Tools offers you the ability to choose the maximum levels of
Undo that your session will have. You can set these levels on your session
by doing the following:
1. Choose Setups➪Preferences from the main menu.
The Preferences dialog box duly appears.
2. Click the Edit tab.
The Preferences dialog box shows its Edit face.
3. Type in the number of Undos you want in your session in the Levels of
Undo field at the bottom of the window, as shown in Figure 1-22.
4. Click Done.
Performing Undos
Performing Undos in Pro Tools is just like any other program: Choose Edit➪
Undo from the main menu. The Undo option also includes the name of the
operation that you’re undoing, as shown in Figure 1-23. This is helpful when
you want to perform multiple Undos, because you have to move back pro-
gressively through each operation that you performed. Keeping track of 
32 operations can be tricky.
You can redo an Undo — only the last one — by choosing Edit➪Redo from
the main menu.
Figure 1-22:
Choose the
levels of
Undo in your

Managing Undos
338
Knowing when you can no longer Undo
Some operations result in clearing your Undo lineup. Whenever you perform
the following operations, your previous operations can no longer be undone:
✦Importing track or session data.
✦Selecting Select Unused Regions or Select Unused Regions Except Whole
Files from the Audio Regions list pop-up menu.
✦Deleting a track or clearing a region from the Audio Regions list pop-up
menu.
Pro Tools won’t warn you before you perform these operations. But hey,
sometimes we human beings actually do know what we’re doing.

efore you can do any editing of audio regions, you have to make a selec-
tion. Pro Tools offers many ways to select material. You can select from
a single track, grouped tracks, or the entire track list. You can select from a
track’s playlist or from the Timeline ruler. And you can make adjustments to
the length and position of the selected material. All these options are covered
in this chapter.
Selecting Track Material
When you select material to edit, the selection becomes highlighted and, if
you have the Edit and Timeline Selection Linked option chosen, you’ll see
little arrows in the Timeline ruler designating the Start and End points of
the selection. (Figure 2-1 shows a selection, whereas you can see the handy
Edit and Timeline Selection Linked button right here in the margin.) The
arrows will be blue if there are no tracks enabled for recording and red if
there are. 
If you haven’t chosen the Edit and Timeline Selection Linked option, Edit
markers instead of arrows will mark your selection, as shown in Figure 2-2.

Selecting Track Material
340
Selecting part of a region
You can select material one of three ways:
✦Drag within a track’s playlist, as shown in Figure 2-3. Do this by clicking
and dragging your Start and End points within the track’s playlist.
Figure 2-3:

✦Drag along the Timeline ruler, as shown in Figure 2-4. Do this by clicking
and dragging your Start and End points along the Timeline ruler or by
moving the Start and End point arrows to where you want them. Doing
this selects all the unhidden tracks in the session.
✦Enter values in the Start and End fields of your Expanded section in
the Transport window, as shown in Figure 2-5. Do this by highlighting a
track and typing in your start point in the Start field and pressing Return
(Mac) or Enter (PC). Type in your end point in the End field and press
Return (Mac) or Enter (PC) or type in the length of the selection in the
Length field and press Return (Mac) or Enter (PC). 
When you make a selection within a track that is part of a group, all tracks in
the group — except those that are specifically hidden — are selected.

To create a selection that extends farther than the width of your computer
screen, click the Start point, scroll to the End point, and then Shift+click the
point. You can toggle back and forth from the Start and End points by press-
ing the left or right arrow keys respectively.
Selecting across multiple tracks
You can select more than one track to edit in Pro Tools in several ways: 
✦Drag across the tracks you want using the Selector tool (click the
Selector Tool button at the top of the Edit window to, well, select it).
This only works if the tracks you want to include are adjacent to one
another.
✦Group the tracks you want to select and click-drag on one of the tracks
within that group. Any hidden tracks in the group will not be selected.
(For more on groups and grouping, see Book 3, Chapter 4.)
✦Drag along the Timeline ruler to select all the tracks.
✦To select all the tracks along with any conductor tracks (those dealing
with Meter and Tempo changes), press Alt (on a PC) or Option (on a Mac)
while dragging along the Timeline ruler.
Selecting an entire region
You can select an entire region one of two ways:
✦Click in that region with the Grabber tool.
Click the Grabber Tool button located at the top of the Edit window to
enable it.
✦Double-click the region with the Selector tool.
Click the Selector Tool button located at the top of the Edit window to
enable it.
Selecting two regions and any space between them
To select two or more regions and include any space that separates them,
follow these steps:
1. Select the Grabber tool by clicking the Grabber Tool button at the top
of the Edit window.
2. Click in the first region with the Grabber tool.
3. Shift+click the next region. To add more regions, Shift+click each one
you want until you have them all chosen.
All regions selected become highlighted, along with any spaces that
exist between them.

Selecting an entire track
You can select all the regions in a track one of two ways:
✦Triple-click one of the regions in the track.
✦Click in the track with the Selector tool and choose Edit➪Select All from
the main menu or press Command+A on a Mac or Ctrl+A on a PC.
You call up the Selector tool by clicking the Selector button located at the
top of the Edit window.
Selecting all regions in all tracks
You can select all regions located in the tracks of your session (except the
hidden ones) in any of four ways:
✦Select All in the Edit Groups list pop-up menu. This menu is accessed by
click-holding the Edit Groups title in the Edit Group List section of the
Edit window. If the Edit Group List isn’t visible, click the double arrow at
the bottom-left corner of the Edit window.
✦Triple-click any region within a track in the playlist section of the Edit
window.
✦Press Return and Command+A (on a Mac) or Ctrl+A (on a PC) on your
keyboard.
✦Double-click anywhere along the Timeline ruler (the session’s timeline).
If you want to include the conductor events in your selection (tempo or
meter changes) of all regions in the tracks, make sure that you have the Edit
and Timeline Selection Linked option chosen and press Ctrl (on a PC) or
Option (on a Mac) while you double-click the Timeline ruler.
Selecting on the fly
You can make selections while your session is playing by using the arrow
keys. Follow these steps:
1. Engage the Link Edit and Timeline Selection Linked button or choose
Operations➪Link Edit and Timeline Selection Linked from the main
menu. Alternately, you can engage the Edit and Timeline link button
at the upper right of the Edit window.
2. Click the track somewhere before the place you want to start your
selection. 
This is where the session will start playing back. If you want a select a
point near the beginning of the session, you can skip this step and just
start playing from the beginning.

Selecting Track Material
344
3. Either click Play in the Transport window or press the spacebar on
your keyboard to start the session playing.
4. Press the Down arrow key on your keyboard when your playback
reaches the point where you want the selection to begin.
5. Press the Up arrow when your playback reaches the point where you
want the selection to end.
6. Click Stop in the Transport window or press the spacebar on your
keyboard to stop the session.
To scroll back to the selection Start point, press the Left arrow key; to scroll
to the selection End point, press the Right arrow key.
If you have either the Scroll After Playback or Page Scroll During Playback
options checked under Scroll Options in the Operations menu, these options
toggle off when you select on the fly. To reactivate one of them after you’ve
made your selection, you need to scroll down the Operations menu and
check that option again (version 6.0 and later).
Selecting using the Selection Indicator fields
You can use the Selection Indicator fields to enter either the Start and End
points or the length of a selection. This section describes how to do this.
Making a selection using the indicators
1. Using the Selector tool, click in the track you want to select. 
Remember: You choose the Selector tool by clicking the Selector Tool
button at the top of the Edit window.
2. Click in the Start field and type in the start point that you want and
then press Return (on a Mac) or Enter (on PC).
3. Click in the End field and type in the location of the end of the selec-
tion and then press Return (on a Mac) or Enter (on a PC).
You can also enter the length of the selection after entering the Start point.
The End point will automatically be entered in the End field.
Changing a selection using the indicators
To change the values in any of the indicator fields without typing in a value:
✦Press the slash (/) key on your keyboard to move from one selection
indicator to the next.

Book IV
Chapter 2
Selecting 
Material to Edit
Making Changes to Your Selection
345
✦Press the period (.) key or the left and right arrow keys to move from
one time field in an indicator to the next.
✦Press the up arrow key to increase the value in the field or the down
arrow key to decrease it. 
Making a selection using the 
Tab to Transients function
Transients are the initial attack in an instrument and in Pro Tools you can
move from one transient in a region to another by engaging the Tab to
Transients button and pressing the Tab key. To use this function to choose
Start and End points for a selection:
1. Enable the Tab to Transients button.
The button here in the margin shows you what to look for.
2. Make sure that you have the Edit and Timeline Selection Linked option
enabled by checking the Link Edit and Timeline Selection Linked
checkbox in the Operation menu or by engaging the Edit and
Timeline link button.
3. Using the Selector tool, click in the audio track somewhere before the
Start point of the area you want to select.
4. Press the Tab key on your keyboard repeatedly to move from transient
to transient until you get to the Start point. If you go too far, you can
back up by pressing the Ctrl (on a PC) or Option (on a Mac) key when
you hit Tab.
5. Press the Shift key as you tab through the transients to the End point.
Again if you go too far, you can back up the End point by pressing
Shift+Ctrl+Tab (on a PC) or Shift+Option+Tab (on a Mac).
Making Changes to Your Selection
Try as you might, after you’ve made a selection on one of your tracks, you
may find that your selection just doesn’t cut it. You may end up with too much
or too little material at the beginning or end of the selection. You may decide
that you want to move the entire selection over in time to encompass differ-
ent material. You may decide that you want to include other tracks in the
selection. You also may want to change the track onto which you’ve made
your selection. Luckily, you don’t have to start over selecting material to do
this. You can make these adjustments to a selection quickly and easily in Pro
Tools. This section describes these ways to change what you’ve selected.

Making Changes to Your Selection
346
Changing a selection’s length
If, after you’ve made a selection, you want to change its Start or End point
(say, skip the first two bars of your selection), you can do so by doing one
of the following:
✦Using the Selector tool, Shift+click at the point you want outside the cur-
rent selection.
✦Again using your Selector tool, Shift+drag either the Start or End point to
where you want it.
✦Drag the Playback marker (or Edit marker if the Edit and Timeline selec-
tions are unlinked) for the Start or End point in the Timeline ruler (the
section in the Edit window with the time markers located above the track
playlists).
✦Type in the new Start or End point value in the Start or End field of the
Expanded section of the Transport window and press Enter (on a PC) or
Return (on a Mac).
Nudging selections
Sometimes you want to move a selection very slightly forward or back in the
Timeline to make sure you cover the exact material you want to edit. Pro Tools
lets you use the Nudge function to move either your entire selection or just
its Start or End point so you can fine-tune your selections.
Nudging the entire selection
You can move a selection by the increments set up in your Nudge Value menu,
so that you can move across the material without actually moving that mate-
rial itself. (The latter move is done after you finish making a selection and is
covered in Book 4, Chapter 3). Follow these steps:
1. Make your selection, using one of the procedures listed earlier in this
section.
2. Click-hold on the Nudge Value drop-down menu, located next to
Nudge below the Counter section of the Edit window.
The Nudge Value menu pops up.
3. Select the desired value for your nudge in the pop-up menu, as shown
in Figure 2-6. 
For more on using the Nudge feature, go to the next chapter (Book 4,
Chapter 3).
4. Press the Shift key along with either the + key or – key.
Doing so “nudges” your selection to the right or left by the designated
nudge value.

Extending selection lengths
Sometimes the best way to get all the material in your selection is to redefine
its boundaries. Pro Tools offers you three ways to extend your selection: to
the Start or End point of the selected region, to include an adjacent region,
or to markers (memory locations). These options are covered in this section.
Extending to the Start or End point of a selected region
Follow these steps to extend your selection to the Start or End point of the
region:
1. Select a portion of the region using the Selector tool, or simply click
anywhere in that region. 
Remember: Choose the Selector tool by clicking the Selector button at
the top of the Edit window.
2. Press Shift+Tab to extend the selection to the end of the region or
Shift+Ctrl+Tab (on a PC) or Shift+Command+Tab (on a Mac) to extend
your selection to the start of the region.
Extending a selection to an adjacent region
Use the following steps to extend a selection to include an adjacent region:
1. Using the Grabber tool, click the first region to select it.
2. Press Shift+Ctrl+Tab (on a Mac) or Shift+Start/Windows+Tab (on a PC)
to include the following region or press Shift+Ctrl+Option+Tab (on a
Mac) or Shift+Start/Windows+Ctrl+Tab (on a PC) to include the previ-
ous region.
Extending a selection to a memory location (marker)
Memory locations (markers) are flags you can place within the session to
make navigating your session faster. I usually make a habit of putting a marker
at the beginning of each verse and chorus to help me find them quickly. To
extend a selection to a marker or memory location, follow these steps:

Book IV
Chapter 2
Selecting 
Material to Edit
Making Changes to Your Selection
349
1. Click the Start or End point in a track or make a selection in one of
the ways listed earlier in this chapter.
2. Shift+click a marker in the Markers ruler (located above the track
playlist section of the Edit window) or a memory location in the
Memory Locations window. 
The Memory Locations window is opened by clicking on any of the
markers in your session or by clicking on the Marker icon at the left of
the Markers ruler.
Moving and extending selections between tracks
You can take a selection on a track and extend it to include other tracks —
or you can even move the selection to another track. For example, this is
handy if you selected the snare drum and then decided you want to include
the rest of the drum tracks in your edit. Another example would be if you
selected one rhythm guitar track but decided you want to edit another
rhythm guitar track instead. This section covers these options.
Moving a selection to another track
If, after you’ve made a selection, you decide that you’d rather edit a different
track instead — while still using the same Start and End points as the selec-
tion you’ve already made — you can move the selection from one track to
another. This process is done by following these steps:
1. Click the Commands Focus button, seen here in the margin, to enable
the Commands Focus function. 
2. Make a selection, using one of the procedures listed earlier in this
chapter.
3. Press P to move the selection to the previous (above) track or press ;
(semicolon) to move the selection to the following (below) track.
Extending a selection to an adjacent track
If you’d like to include adjacent tracks in your selection — as in the case of
adding drums track to a selection you made on the snare drum track — you
can do this by following these steps:
1. Click the Commands Focus button to enable the Commands Focus
function.
2. Make a selection in a track in one of the ways listed earlier in this
chapter.

Managing Memory Locations

3. Press Shift+P to include the previous (above) track or Press Shift+;
(semicolon) to include the following (below) track. 
Figure 2-7 shows what happens when you extend a selection to include
an adjacent track.
If you’ve gotten overzealous in extending your selection to adjacent tracks
you can remove the bottom track from this group by pressing Ctrl+Option+;
(semicolon) on a Mac or Start/Windows+Alt+; (semicolon) on a PC.
Managing Memory Locations
Memory locations let you quickly move from one position in a session to
another with the click of a button. You can have up to 200 memory markers
in each session. 
Dealing with the dialog box
Whenever you create a memory location a dialog box opens, as shown in
Figure 2-8, where you choose the parameters of the marker. This box contains
two sections: Time Properties and General Properties.
Setting time properties
The Time Properties section of the New Memory Location dialog box lets you
choose from three options — Marker, Selection, and None — and whether
you want the reference in bar/beat (the location in your session related to
measures) or absolute time (the location in your session related to the clock
in minutes and seconds from the start of the session).

The following list fills you in on what each of the three options here means:
✦Marker: This option marks a specific location and is designated by a
yellow icon in the Markers ruler — the ruler located at the top of the
playlist section of the Edit window. If you set the reference for the loca-
tion marker to Bar/Beat, the icon is a chevron (Figure 2-9, left) and if you
set the reference to Absolute, it appears as a triangle (Figure 2-9, right). 
✦Selection: Using this option marks a selected range within a track or
multiple tracks. 
✦None: This type of memory location is called a General Properties
memory location and it actually doesn’t contain any time-based infor-
mation; rather, it memorizes just the selections from the General
Properties section of the menu. (See the next section for more on
General Properties.) This is good option if you just want to remember 
a zoom or pre- and post-roll setting for part of the session.

Choosing general properties
In the General Properties section of the Memory Location dialog box (refer
to Figure 2-8) you can set preferences for the information that you store with
the memory location. These include
✦Name: You can enter a name in this field to help you remember what the
memory location is for.
✦Zoom Settings: This lets you store the horizontal and vertical zoom set-
tings for the tracks.
✦Pre- and Post-roll Times: This option stores the pre- and post-roll times
and is handy when using the Selection memory location for setting
record ranges.
✦Track/Show Hide: This setting allows you to store track layouts in your
session (as far as them being shown or hidden, anyway).
✦Track Heights: This option lets you store the height of tracks in your
session.
✦Group Enables: This setting stores both Edit and Mix groups for easy
recall of them when mixing or editing.
Creating memory locations
You create memory locations differently depending on the type — Marker,
Selection, None — that you want. This section details those ways.
Memory markers
Creating a Marker memory location requires these steps:
1. Get all your Settings ducks in a row for your session, so that the ses-
sion is set up the way you want it to be. 
Settings here can include zoom settings, track heights, or any of the set-
ting options listed in the previous section, “Dealing with the dialog box.”
2. Link your Edit and Timeline selections by clicking the Link Edit and
Timeline Selection button, pressing Shift+/, or choosing Operations➪
Link Edit and Timeline Selection from the main menu.
The Edit and Timeline Link button is shown here in the margin.
3. Open the Markers Ruler — if it’s not already displayed — by choosing
Display➪Ruler View Shows➪Markers from the main menu. 
The Markers ruler appears just above the playlist section of the Edit
window.

Playing Selected Material
After you make a selection, you’re free to give it a listen. This section covers
a variety of ways of doing this.
Playing your selection
To play your selection, simply click the Play button in the Transport window
or press the Spacebar on your keyboard. All the tracks in the session will play
during the selected range. If you only want to hear the track(s) in which you
made your selection, you’ve got one of two choices:
✦Hide or mute the tracks you don’t want to hear.
✦Solo the track(s) you do want to hear.
Using pre- and post-rolls
You can set Pro Tools to play a designated length of time before and after
your selection by using pre- and post-rolls. This section shows you how to
set your pre-rolls and post-rolls, as well as how to audition them.
Setting and enabling pre- and post-rolls
To set pre- and post-rolls
1. Choose Display➪Transport Window Shows➪Expanded from the
main menu. 
The Pre- and Post-Roll fields appear in the window.

Auditioning Start and End points
When you audition Start and End points, you get to listen to just the begin-
ning or end of a selection without having to listen to the whole thing. This
kind of auditioning is done in the following ways:
Auditioning the Start point
You can audition the Start point of a selection either with or without listen-
ing to the pre-roll along with it. Both options are covered in this section.
✦To audition just the Start point of a selection: Press Ctrl+left arrow (on
a PC) or Command+left arrow (on a Mac). The selection plays for the
length of time designated in the Post-Roll field of the Transport window.
✦To audition the Start point of a selection along with the pre-roll: Press
Ctrl+Alt+left arrow (on a PC) or Command+Option+left arrow (on a Mac).
The pre-roll plays along with the length of the selection, as designated
in the Post-Roll field of the Transport window as long as you have the
Pre/Post-roll Playback function enabled. (Choose Operations➪Pre/Post-
roll Playback from the main menu.)
Auditioning the End point
Pro Tools lets you audition the end point of your selection, either with or
without hearing the post-roll too. Here’s how to use these options:
✦To audition just the end point of a selection: Press Alt+right arrow (on
a PC) or Option+right arrow (on a Mac). The selection will start at the
point equal to the pre-roll amount from the end of the selection. 
✦To audition the End point of a selection along with the post-roll: Press
Ctrl+Alt+right arrow (on a PC) or Command+Option+right arrow (on a
Mac). The Selection will start at the point equal to the pre-roll amount
from the end of the selection and continue until the end of the post-roll.
Looping your selection’s playback
If you have a section of the song that you want to listen to repeatedly (say,
if you’re trying to find a chair squeak to edit), you can loop a selection by
engaging the Loop command. This enables you to create looped sections
and to make sure that your Start and End points play seamlessly. Follow
these steps to loop a selection:
1. Engage the Link Edit and Timeline Selection option by either choosing
Operations➪Link Edit and Timeline Selection from the main menu or
by clicking the Edit and Timeline Link button.

Playing Selected Material
364
2. Make a selection using one of the techniques listed in the “Selecting
Track Material” section, earlier in this chapter.
3. Choose Operations➪Loop Playback from the main menu, or Ctrl+click
(on a Mac) or Right-click (on a PC) the Play button in the Transport
window.
4. Click Play in the Transport window or press the Spacebar on your
keyboard. 
If you have the pre-roll engaged, playback will begin with it; otherwise it
starts at the beginning of your selection. When the selection loops the
pre-and post-rolls won’t play after the starting pre-roll (if you have the
function engaged).
5. Click Stop in the Transport window or the Spacebar on your keyboard
to stop playback.

 Editing regions
 Working with looped material
P
ro Tools offers you many options for editing the audio files in your ses-
sions, include cutting file segments, copying them, pasting them, clear-
ing them, basting them, and marinating them. (Okay, maybe not the last two,
but you get the point.). You can also edit by trimming segments, moving
them, aligning them, locking them, and so on.
In this chapter, you discover the many Edit commands of Pro Tools and you
begin to edit regions — our term for audio file segments — using the various
Edit functions that Pro Tools is famous for. I also fill you in on creating loops
you can use to build your song (if that’s the way you want to work).
Editing Regions
Regions are the defined areas of the track in which you do your editing. Each
audio file is represented in your session by a region (or series of regions). A
region can be the entire file or it can be bits and pieces of a file. When you
edit in Pro Tools, you’re not actually making any changes to the audio file.
(There are some exceptions to this that I explain later in this chapter.).
Instead, you make changes to the way Pro Tools plays those files by editing
the regions that represent the file.
For example, if you decide that a track really does sound better without that
accordion solo and you cut that section of the region containing that part, the
section isn’t really erased from your hard drive — it’s simply not played back
when you listen to your session. This allows you to make a stunning variety
of edits without having to worry about ruining your original audio file.
Being able to create, capture, separate, trim, and heal regions is essential 
to being able to edit in Pro Tools. These procedures are explained in this
section.

Editing Regions
366
Creating regions 
Whenever you record or import an audio file in Pro Tools, you create a region
of that entire file. You can edit that region, but once you cut it, separate it,
paste it, or do any other edit to it, you’ll be creating new regions from the
original file. There are several ways to create new regions with which to work,
including capturing selections, separating selections, and trimming to a selec-
tion. These are all covered in this section.
When you create a new region, it appears in the track’s playlist — the area
next to the Track Controls section of the Edit window that contains the
visual representations of the audio files (regions) — as well as in the Audio
Regions list, located on the right side of the Edit and Mix windows.
Using the Capture Region command
The Capture Region command lets you create a new region within an exist-
ing one. The new region is still part of the original region, but it has its own
name. If you want to create a region that can be moved around separately
from the original, use the Separate Regions command detailed in the next
section. To use the Capture Region command, follow these steps:
1. Choose the Selector tool from the top of the Edit window.
2. Click and drag the track’s region in the playlist section of the Edit
window where you want to create a new region.
3. Choose Edit➪Capture Region from the main menu or press
Command+R (on a Mac) or Ctrl+R (on a PC). 
The Name Region dialog box appears.
4. Enter the name of this region in the Name Region dialog box and
click OK. 
The new region is created and the region’s name appears in the Audio
Regions list menu in the Track’s playlist.
Employing the Separate Regions command
If you want to create a region that can be moved around separately from the
original, use the Separate Regions command. Here’s how it’s done:
1. Choose the Selector tool from the top of the Edit window.
2. Click-drag on the track’s region in the track’s playlist where you want
to create a new region. 
If you want to select more than one track, drag across the desired tracks.

Book IV
Chapter 3
Getting into Editing
Editing Regions
367
3. Choose Edit➪Separate Region from the main menu or press
Command+E (on a Mac) or Ctrl+E (on a PC). 
The Name Region dialog box appears.
4. Enter the name of this region in the Name Region dialog box and
click OK.
The new region is created; its name appears in the Audio Regions list
menu. You can now move, copy, cut, or otherwise edit this region.
If you don’t want to have to type in a name for this new region, you can use
the Pro Tools Auto-Name feature, which automatically gives your new regions
such exciting names as Audio 2_02. To activate this feature, choose Setups➪
Preferences from the main menu, click the Edit tab in the Preferences dialog
box when it appears, and then check the Auto-Name Separated Regions check
box on the tab.
If you have a bunch of takes that you’ve recorded in succession (when you
loop-record, for example) and you want to separate all of them at the same
place, check the Separate Region Operates on All Related Takes option on
the Edit tab of the Preferences dialog box. (Choose Setups➪Preferences from
the main menu to get to the Preference dialog box.) If you choose to do this,
make sure that both the Take Region Names That Match Track Names and
Take Regions Lengths That Match options are also checked in the Edit tab of
Preferences dialog box
Using the Separation Grabber tool
If you want to separate and move a region in one step, you can use the
Separation Grabber tool, located in the Edit Tools section of the Edit window.
This tool toggles between the Grabber tool by click-holding the button and
choosing the Separation option from the pop-up menu that appears, as shown
in Figure 3-1.
To use the Separation Grabber tool, follow these steps:
Figure 3-1:
Toggling the
Grabber and
Separation
Grabber
tools.

Editing Regions
368
1. Using the Selector tool, drag over the part of the region you want to
separate in the playlist section of the Edit window. 
This selection can be across multiple tracks or regions within a single
track.
2. Click-hold on the Grabber tool and choose the Separation option from
the pop-up menu that appears.
3. Click the selection you made in Step 1 and drag the selection to where
you want it. 
Pro Tools automatically creates three new regions: the separated section
and the parts before and after this section. These three sections all show
up in the Audio Regions list menu.
If you want to leave the original region as it is and grab a section from it to
put somewhere else, press Option (on a Mac) or Alt (on a PC) when you drag
the selection with the Separation Grabber tool. The original region remains
intact and your selection is simply copied and moved.
Trying the Trim to Selection command
The Trim to Selection command allows you to choose a section of a region
and remove the unselected parts of that region. Follow these steps to trim
unwanted parts from a selection:
1. Choose the area you want to keep by selecting it in the track’s playlist
with the Selector tool.
2. Press Command+T (on a Mac) or Ctrl+T (on PC) or choose Edit➪Trim➪
To Selection from the main menu, as shown in Figure 3-2.
The unselected parts of the region disappear.
Healing regions
You can use the Heal Separations command to combine regions that you
separated into one region again. There are some restrictions to this process,
though:
✦You can’t heal regions that come from different audio files.
✦Your regions must be in the same places they were when you 
separated them.

Book IV
Chapter 3
Getting into Editing
Editing Regions
369
To heal two regions, follow these steps:
1. Using the Selector tool, select a portion of both regions along with the
spot to be healed, as shown in Figure 3-3.
2. Choose Edit➪Heal Separation from the main menu or press
Command+H (on a Mac) or Ctrl+H (on a PC). 
Your two regions become one again.

If the selection doesn’t heal (because one region has been moved, for
instance) you can do one of the following:
✦Choose Slip Edit mode (select this from the Edit mode options at the
top-left portion of the Edit window) and delete one of the two regions.
Next, using the Trimmer tool, expand the existing region to its original
size. (See the “Trimming regions” section, later in this chapter, for more
on the Trimmer tool.) This procedure expands the region to include
hidden material. In this, case the hidden material is the stuff from the
deleted region.
✦Delete both regions and drag the original region into the track from the
Audio Regions list (Book IV, Chapter 1 has more on this procedure).
Placing regions in tracks
All the regions for your session are located in the Audio Regions list; you can
use this list to drag a region (or regions) into any track.
Placing a region in a track
Follow these steps to place a region in a track:
1. Select the region you want to place in a track by highlighting it in the
Audio Regions list.
The Audio Regions list is located on the right side of the Edit and Mix
windows.
2. Click the region’s name and drag it into the track where you want it.
Depending on the Edit mode that you have selected — you select an Edit
mode from the options located at the upper-left corner of the Edit window —
your region is placed in one of several possible ways:
✦In Shuffle mode: Placing a region while in Shuffle mode slides existing
regions over to make room for the one you’re placing. This places regions
end to end (they automatically touch on another).
✦In Spot mode: Placing a region while in Spot mode opens a dialog box
where you can enter the position of the region you’re placing. This mode
allows you to place a region at a precise point.
✦In Slip mode: Placing a region while in Slip mode lets you drag the
region anywhere you want within the track’s playlist, allowing you to
overlap another region or be separated from it. 
✦In Grid mode: Placing a region in Grid mode places the region to the
nearest grid boundary. Pro Tools lets you temporarily disable the grid
by pressing Ctrl (on a PC) or Command (on a Mac) while you drag your
selected region into a track.

You can adjust the grid value for your session by opening the Grid Value drop-
down menu, shown in Figure 3-4. (This menu is opened by click-holding on
the arrow to the right of the Grid title in the center of the Edit menu, right
below the Edit tools.)
Placing a region at the Edit Insert point
You can designate an Edit Insert point by clicking your cursor within a track
in the playlist section of the Edit window; you can then place your region
right at this point. You can either have the region’s Start or End point snap
to the Edit Insert point. 
To designate an Edit Insert point, start by locating your cursor at the place
in the track where you want the region placed, as shown in Figure 3-5. Then,
depending on where you want your region to end up, do one of the following:
✦To place the start of a region at the Edit Insert point: Press
Start/Windows (on a PC) or Ctrl (on a Mac) key while you drag
the region from the Audio Regions list to the track. 
If the region is already in the track and you want to move it,
Start/Windows+click (on a PC) or Ctrl+click (on a Mac) while
dragging with the Grabber tool.
✦To place the end of a region at the Edit Insert point: Press
Ctrl+Start/Windows (on a PC) or Command+Ctrl (on a Mac) while
you drag the region from the Audio Regions list to the track.
If the region already resides in the track, Ctrl+Start/Windows+click (on a
PC) or Command+Ctrl+click (on a Mac) while dragging with the Grabber
tool.

Using region Synch points
A Synch point is a specific location in your session where you can have
regions align to. This lets you place a specific point in the region (called the
synch point) precisely where you want without regard to the placements of
Start or End points of that region. You can assign a region Synch point in Pro
Tools anywhere within the session. This feature is helpful when you want to
place a sound at a precise point in the session, as when you’re spotting (posi-
tioning) sound effects for video. Using a Synch point, you first mark the loca-
tion sound effect that you want to place (breaking glass for instance) in the
region with this sound and then place that region where you want the glass
to start breaking in your session. This makes it easy to spot that sound even
when the sound doesn’t begin at the Start point of a region. 
Creating a Synch point
To define a region’s Synch point, follow these steps:
1. Using the Selector tool, click within a track where you want your
Synch point to be.
2. Choose Edit➪Identify Synch Point from the main menu, as shown in
Figure 3-6, or press Command+, (comma) (on a Mac) or Ctrl+, (comma)
(on a PC). 
A small arrow appears at the bottom of the region, as shown in Figure 3-7,
to show you where you’ve placed the Synch point.
You can remove the Synch point by choosing Edit➪Remove Synch Point
from the main menu.
Since each region can only have one Synch point at a time, if you want to
change the location of this Synch point, simply select a new place in the
region and choose Edit➪Identify Synch Point again from the main menu. The
old Synch point is removed and a new one appears at the new location.

Placing a region’s Synch point at an Edit Insert point
Once you have a Synch point defined, you can use it to place or align a region
within your track’s playlist. To place the Synch point of the region to the Edit
Insert point in the track’s playlist, do the following:
1. Using the Selector tool, click a point in the target region to define
your Edit Insert point.
2. Press Shift+Ctrl (on a Mac) or Shift+Start/Windows (PC) while dragging
the region you want to insert — the one containing the Synch point you
added, following the procedure outlined in the previous Steps list —
from the Audio Regions list into the track.

If the region with the Synch point already resides within the track,
switch to the Grabber tool, and then press Shift+Ctrl (on a Mac) or
Shift+Start/Windows (on a PC) while clicking on the region. 
The region’s Synch point snaps to the selected position in the track’s
playlist.
Aligning regions 
Pro Tools lets you align the Start, End, or Synch point of regions to the Start
point of another region. This can be helpful for arranging regions in songs to
get synchronized playback.
Aligning a Start point of a region to the Start 
point of a region on another track
To do this, follow these steps:
1. Using the Grabber tool, click the region in the playlist of the track you
want to align to.
2. If the region you want to move already exists in the playlist of the
track from Step 1, press Start/Windows (on PC) or Ctrl (on a Mac) and
then click on the region you want to move. The region automatically
moves into position.
or
If the region you want to move resides in the Audio Regions list, press
Start/Windows (on a PC) or Ctrl (on a Mac) and then click and drag
the region onto the track’s playlist. 
Both Start points are aligned.
Aligning the End point of a region to the Start 
point of a region on a different track
To do this, follow these steps:
1. Using the Grabber tool, click the region you want to align to in the
track’s playlist.
2. If the region you want to move is located in the playlist of the track
from Step 1, press Ctrl+Start/Windows (on a PC) or Command+Ctrl
(on a Mac) and then click the region.

The region automatically moves into position.
or
If this region isn’t already in the track’s playlist, press Ctrl+Start/
Windows (on a PC) or Command+Ctrl (on a Mac) and click and drag
the region you want to move from the Audio Regions list onto the
playlist.
The End point of the region you moved is aligned to the Start point of
the first region you chose.
Aligning a region’s Synch point to the 
Start point of another track’s region
You can align your Synch point on one track to the Start point of a region on
another track by following these steps:
1. Using the Grabber tool, click the region you want to align to in the
track’s playlist.
2. If the region you want to move is located in the playlist of the track
from Step 1, press Shift+Ctrl (on a Mac) or Shift+Start/Windows (on a
PC) while clicking with the Grabber on the region. 
The region automatically moves into position.
or
If the region doesn’t already exist within the track’s playlist, you can
place and align a region from the Audio Regions list by pressing
Shift+Ctrl (on a Mac) or Shift+Start/Windows (on a PC) while clicking
and dragging the region from the Audio Regions list.
The Synch point of the second region aligns to the Start point of the
first, as shown in Figure 3-8.

Trimming regions
You can trim regions using the Trimmer tool, by choosing Edit➪Trim from
the main menu, or by nudging the Start or End point of a region. The Trim-
mer tool, shown here in the margin, consists of two options: the Standard
Trimmer and the Time Trimmer. All of these trimming options are detailed
in this section.
Using the Standard Trimmer tool
The Standard Trimmer tool lets you shorten or lengthen (to the maximum
length of the parent audio file, anyway) a region without altering the original
file. Whenever you trim a region, a new region is created in the Audio
Regions list.
To trim a region using the Standard Trimmer tool, first call up the tool by
clicking the Trimmer Tool button and then do one of the following:
✦Place the cursor near the Start or End point of a region and drag the
region’s Start or End point to shorten or lengthen, as shown in Figure 3-9.
or
✦Place your cursor where you want to trim the region and click with your
mouse, as shown in Figure 3-10. The region is trimmed to the Start point
or the End point, depending on where you’ve placed the cursor. If the
cursor is located closer to the Start point, you trim the Start point; if
the cursor is closer to the End point, you trim the End point. You can
reverse the default here by pressing Option (on a Mac) or Alt (on a PC)
as you trim.
You can tell which way the trim is going to happen by the direction of the
cursor. Figure 3-11 shows the cursor as it is set to trim the Start point (left)
and the End point (right). 
Figure 3-9:

Getting into Editing
Editing Regions
377
The Trimmer tools (both the Standard Trimmer and the Time Trimmer)
behave differently depending on the Edit mode you’re using. Here’s a quick
rundown of the differences:
✦Shuffle mode: In this mode, any adjacent regions slide over as you
expand or trim the region. 
✦Spot mode: In this mode, the Spot dialog box appears, prompting you to
type in the exact placement of the region’s Start or End point.
✦Grid mode: In this mode, any trimming or expanding that you do auto-
matically snaps to the nearest grid boundary.
✦Slip mode: In this mode, your region moves to wherever you place it.
Any other regions in the playlist remain where they are.
If you want to return the region to its original size, you can either
✦Drag the original region from the Audio Regions list to the track’s
playlist.
✦Drag the Start or End point of the region with the Trimmer tool to its
original length.

Tackling the Time Trimmer tool
The Time Trimmer tool, shown here in the margin, expands or compresses a
region using the Time Compression/Expansion (TC/E) plug-in, in the process
of creating a new audio file. Using the Time Trimmer is different from using
the Standard Trimmer: Instead of cutting off part of the file when you trim,
the Time Trimmer tool shortens how long the region takes to play. 
When you use the Time Trimmer tool to expand or compress a region, it alters
the speed at which the region plays — which alters the way the material in the
region sounds. Compressing speeds up the region; expanding slows it down.
To use the Time Trimmer tool, call it up by click-holding over the Trimmer
tool button and dragging down to select the Time Trimmer option and then
do one of the following:
✦Place the cursor near the Start or End point of a region and drag the
region’s Start or End point to shorten or lengthen the region. (Refer to
Figure 3-9.)
or
✦Place your cursor where you want to expand or contract the region and
click with your mouse. (Refer to Figure 3-10.) The Start or End point of
the region moves out or in depending on which way the Time Trimmer
Tool cursor is facing. (See Figure 3-12.)
The Edit mode you use determines how the Time Trimmer tool behaves and
how the regions surrounding the trim react. Check out the previous section
for a rundown of the different ways the Edit modes work with the trim tools.
To return the region to its original length, follow these steps:
✦Drag the original region from the Audio Regions list to the track’s
playlist.
✦Select Edit➪Undo from the main menu if this was the last operation you
performed.
Taking advantage of the Trim command
You can trim regions using the Trim command located in the Edit menu.
(Refer to Figure 3-2.) The menu gives you three options: 
✦Trim to Selection: This command removes all of the region except the
part you’ve selected, as shown in Figure 3-12. To do this trim, select the
part of the region that you want to keep and then choose this command.

Book IV
Chapter 3
Getting into Editing
Editing Regions
379
✦Trim Start to Insertion: This command trims the region from the Start
point to the Edit Insert point designated by your cursor, as shown in
Figure 3-13. To perform this trim, start by placing your cursor where you
want to trim to and then choose this command. 
✦Trim End to Insertion: This command removes that part of the region
from the Edit Insert point to the End point of the region, as shown in
Figure 3-14. Doing this trim is as simple as placing you cursor at the
desired place in the region and choosing the command from the 
Edit menu.
Using the Nudge function to trim a region
You can trim or expand the Start or End points of a region using the plus (+)
and minus (-) keys on the number pad section of your keyboard. (To see how
to set the Nudge value, go to the next section, “Moving regions.”)

To trim the Start point using the Nudge function:
1. Select a region, using the Grabber tool.
2. Press Alt (on a PC) or Option (on a Mac) along with the plus (+) key to
trim or the minus (-) key to expand the Start point.
Each time you press the key, you move the boundary of the region by
the Nudge value.
To trim the End point using the Nudge function:
1. Select a region, using the Grabber tool.
2. Press Ctrl (on PC) or Command (on Mac) along with the plus (+) key to
expand or the minus (-) key to trim the End point. 
Each time you press the key, you move the boundary of the region by
the Nudge value.
Moving regions
You can move (that is, slide) regions in a session either within a track or
across tracks. You can nudge them, shift them, and — depending on the Edit
mode you’re using — you can move them to precisely where you want them.
This section details the many ways you can move regions.
Before you do any moving, however, keep two things in mind:
✦You can make a copy of a region you want to slide by pressing Option
(on a Mac) or Alt (on a PC) as you slide it. This keeps the original in its
place.
✦When you move a region from one track to another, you can keep its Start
point from changing by pressing Ctrl (on a Mac) or Start/Windows (on a
PC) as you slide it. This is good because it lets you move regions from
track to track without losing (ahem) track of its position in the session.
Nudging
If you only want to move a region over a little bit, you can simply nudge it.
With the Nudge function, you can set the Nudge value to be as fine or coarse
as you like.
To set the Nudge value, click-hold over the arrow to the right of the Nudge
title located just beneath the Counters in the Edit window to open the Nudge
Value pop-up menu and then select the scale and value you want, as shown in

Book IV
Chapter 3
Getting into Editing
Editing Regions
381
Figure 3-15. You can choose Bars:Beats, Min:Sec, or Samples for your Nudge
scale. The values you choose depend on this scale. You can also choose to
follow the main time scale for the session by checking that option at the
bottom of the dialog box.
To actually nudge a region or multiple regions, do the following: 
1. Select the region or regions that you want to move using the Grabber
tool. (Select the Grabber by clicking on its icon in the upper part of
the Edit window.) 
To select more than one region, press the Shift key as you grab each
region.
2. Press the plus (+) key or minus (-) key in the numerical section of your
keyboard to move it right or left respectively. 
Each press of the key moves the region over by the Nudge value.
If you want to move the region over faster and still use the Nudge function,
you can have Pro Tools move the region by the next higher Nudge value than
the one you have chosen. For example, if you have the Nudge value set for
1/4 notes, you can nudge by 1/2 notes. Here’s the drill:
1. Select the region(s) you want to nudge with the Grabber (select the
Grabber by clicking on its icon in the upper part of the Edit window).
2. Press Start/Windows (on a PC) or Ctrl (on a Mac) as well as the slash
key (/) to move the material forward (right) or the M key to nudge it
back (left).
You can skip the Start/Windows or Ctrl keys if you have the Commands
Focus (a-z) button enabled.
Figure 3-15:
You can set
the Nudge
value from

Editing Regions
382
You can nudge the contents within a region without moving its Start or End
points. This lets you keep the region you have and its Start and End points
while changing which material from the region’s parent audio file is contained
within the region’s boundaries. 
1. Select the region you want to nudge with the Grabber tool. 
2. Press Start/Windows (on a PC) or Ctrl (on a Mac) and the plus (+) key
to move the region’s content to the right and minus (-) key to move the
contents to the left.
The region stays put and the audio from the original file moves within it,
as shown in Figure 3-16.
This process only works if there is audio information located outside the
current region’s boundaries.
Shifting regions
Pro Tools has a Shift command that lets you move regions by a specified
amount. This is real handy when compensating for latency, such as with the
Mbox or with some plug-ins. 
To shift regions using the Shift command, follow these steps:
1. Select a region, using either the Grabber or the Selector tool.
You can select regions from more than one track. (Check out Book 4,
Chapter 2 for details on how to do this.)
2. Choose Edit➪Shift from the main menu. 
The Shift dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 3-17.
3. Enter the Shift value in the Shift dialog box and whether you want to
shift the region earlier or later. 
This value can be in whatever time format you want: bars and beats,
minutes and seconds, or samples.

4. Press OK.
The region shifts by the amount you specified in Step 3.
The Edit mode you’re in has no effect on the way the Shift command works.
Your region moves over by the specified amount regardless of whether any
other regions are present on that spot.
Moving with Edit modes
When you move or slide regions around in sessions, each Edit mode treats
the regions differently. This section lays out the ways these modes work.
(You select your Edit mode by clicking on the corresponding mode name in
the upper-left side of the Edit window.)
✦Shuffle mode: You can shuffle regions by selecting the Shuffle Edit
mode. This mode lets you shuffle the regions in a track around, but they
always snap to one another — Start point to End point.
✦Slip mode: In Slip Edit mode you can move regions around at will. You
can have space between them and have them overlap.
If you place a region in a track using Slip mode and then switch to Shuffle
mode, that region stays where it is as you shuffle other regions in the
track. These other regions may end up overlapping the slipped region
or you may end up with empty space between them.
✦Spot mode: In Spot mode, whenever you select a region or part of a
region, the Spot dialog box opens, prompting you to enter your destina-
tion location. 
✦Grid mode: In Grid mode, your regions snap to the nearest grid bound-
ary as you move them around. Grid mode offers you two options:
Absolute and Relative.
Whenever you move a region in Absolute mode, the Start point moves to
the nearest grid boundary. When you move a region in Relative mode, it
moves by grid increments (the square units of the grid). This allows you
to move a region around while keeping its Start point at the same posi-
tion relative to a grid boundary.
Figure 3-17:
The Shift
dialog box
lets you shift
a region by
a specific
amount.

Editing Regions
384
For example, if you have a region that starts on the last sixteenth note of a
beat and your grid value is set for quarter notes, here’s what the move looks
like: Each time you move the region by one grid increment, the region moves
by the value of one quarter note — but it stays at the last sixteenth note of
the beat. This is handy for moving drum rhythms around.
You can change the grid resolution by opening the Grid pop-up menu —
refer to Figure 3-4 — and choosing the grid scale and value. You open this
menu by click-holding over the arrow to the right of the Grid title situated
under the Edit tools at the upper end of the Edit window.
You can show the grid in the Edit menu by pressing the Timebase ruler icon
located at the top of the Timebase ruler section of the Edit window. This grid
is labeled with whatever time format you have chosen for your Main counter.
You can also choose the Draw Grid in Edit Window option in the Display tab
of the Preferences dialog box to show the grid. (Choose Setups➪Preferences
from the main menu to call up the Preferences dialog box.)
Locking regions
You can lock regions in place after you’ve put them where you want them.
This keeps you from accidentally moving or deleting them as you work with
other regions in the session. To lock a region, do the following:
1. Select one or more regions with the Grabber tool. 
To select multiple regions on different tracks, press and hold the Shift
key as you click each region.
2. Choose Edit➪Lock/Unlock Region from the main menu.
A small closed-lock icon appears at the lower-left corner of the region, as
shown in Figure 3-18. 
To unlock a region, select the region and choose Edit➪Lock/Unlock from the
main menu.

Book IV
Chapter 3

385
In effect, any region after the locked region is also locked when you’re in
Shuffle mode since they won’t move. Also, in this mode, you can’t place a
region in front of the locked one if it’s longer than the space available for it.
Quantizing regions
Quantizing regions in Pro Tools involves snapping a region’s Start or Synch
point (if you have one defined) to the nearest grid boundary. It’s a way to
align regions — handy for working with drum and percussion parts because
you can arrange them and then quantize them to make them fit the groove of
the song. To quantize a region, follow these steps:
1. Set the grid value that you want in the Grid Value pop-up menu. 
You open this menu by click-holding the arrow to the right of the Grid title
located just beneath the Edit tool sections at the top of the Edit window.
2. Select the region you want to quantize using the Grabber tool. 
Selecting part of a region quantizes the entire region because this com-
mand moves the Start point (and the rest of the region with it).
3. Choose Edit➪Quantize Region from the main menu, as shown in
Figure 3-19, or press Command+Zero (on a Mac) or Ctrl+Zero (on a PC).
The region’s Start or Synch point moves to the nearest grid boundary.

Muting/Unmuting regions
You can mute regions or parts of regions. This gives you more flexibility than
muting an entire track. To mute a region, do the following:
1. Select a region or portion of one. 
To select the entire region use the Grabber tool and click anywhere on
that region within the track’s playlist. To select a portion of a region, use
the Selector tool and drag across the region in the track’s playlist.
2. Press Command+M (on a Mac) or Ctrl+M (on a PC) or choose Edit➪
Mute/Unmute Region from the main menu. 
When muted, the region appears dimmed in the playlist, as shown in
Figure 3-20.
To unmute a region, follow these steps:
1. Select the muted region or portion of the region using the Grabber tool.
You select the Grabber tool by clicking the Grabber tool button at the
top of the Edit window.
2. Choose Edit➪Mute/Unmute from the main menu or press Command+M
(on a Mac) or Ctrl+M (on a PC).
What was muted is now unmuted.
Splitting stereo tracks
When you work with stereo tracks, you usually work with both sides of the
stereo file at once. If you want to edit one or another of the stereo channels
independently, the first step toward doing so is splitting the stereo track into
two mono tracks.
Figure 3-20:
Muted
regions are

Book IV
Chapter 3
Getting into Editing
Examining Edit Commands
387
You split a stereo track into two mono tracks by following these steps:
1. Click the track in the Edit or Mix window with the Grabber tool to
select the track you want to split, as shown in the upper part of
Figure 3-21.
If you want to split more than one track, Shift+click the rest of the tracks.
2. Choose File➪Split Selected Tracks into Mono from the main menu.
The tracks are split and renamed automatically, as shown at the bottom
in Figure 3-21.
Examining Edit Commands
If you’ve worked with any word-processing program, you’re probably famil-
iar with Edit commands such as cut, copy, clear, duplicate, and paste. Pro
Tools, being the super-editor of audio it is, offers a couple more: repeat and
merge-paste. All of these Edit commands are detailed in this section.
The view that you choose for a track affects the kinds of edits you can make
using the commands in this section. If you have the Waveform view open, for
example, any edit you do affects all the parameters for that track — including
automation data. Conversely, if you have one of the Automation Parameters
views open, that parameter is the only one affected by the edit.
Each Edit mode treats the material in the tack differently when you use the
Edit commands in this section. For instance, when you use Shuffle mode,
regions slide over to make room for a pasted region (or to close the gap left
from a cut region). Likewise, in Slip mode, existing regions stay put, no matter
whether a space is left after cutting or if regions overlap from pasting.
Figure 3-21:
A stereo
track (top)
can be split
into two
mono tracks
(bottom).

Examining Edit Commands
388
Using the Cut command
As in most programs that employ a Cut command, any selection that you cut
is removed from the track and placed in the Clipboard where you can paste
it somewhere else if you choose. Here’s how to cut a region or selection:
1. Click-hold on the Track View selector (located in the Track Controls
section of the Edit window) and drag down the list to choose the track
view you want. 
This determines what data is cut from the track. (See the Remember
icon at the beginning of this section.)
2. Select the region or part of the region you want to cut. 
To select the entire region use the Grabber tool and click anywhere on
that region within the track’s playlist. To select a portion of a region, use
the Selector tool and drag across the region in the track’s playlist.
3. Press Command+X (on a Mac) or Ctrl+X (on a PC) or choose Edit➪Cut
from the main menu. 
The selection is placed in the Clipboard.
If you selected only part of a region to cut, Pro Tools creates new regions,
basing them on the new region arrangement for the track. For example, if
you choose a part of a region within the entire region, you end up with three
new regions listed in the Audio Regions list: the portion to the left of the
selection, the cut selection that no longer resides in the track’s playlist and
now sits in the clipboard instead, and the material to the right of the cut
selection. 
Employing Copy
The Copy command in Pro Tools functions just as it does in any computer
software Copy function: The selected material is copied to the Clipboard. To
copy a selection, follow these steps:
1. Click-hold on the Track View selector (located in the Track Controls
section of the Edit window) and drag down the list to choose the track
view you want to edit. 
This determines the data that is cut from the track. (See the Remember
icon at the beginning of this section.)
2. Select the region or part of the region you want to copy. 
To select the entire region, use the Grabber tool and click anywhere on
that region within the track’s playlist. To select a portion of a region, use
the Selector tool and drag across the region in the track’s playlist.

3. Choose Edit➪Copy from the main menu or press Command+C (on a
Mac) or Ctrl+C (on a PC). 
The selection is placed in the Clipboard, and, if you’re not dealing with
the entire region, a new region corresponding to your selection is cre-
ated in the Audio Regions list.
Clearing selections
In Pro Tools, the Clear command removes the selected material from a track
without putting it in the Clipboard and without adding a region to the Audio
Regions list corresponding to the selection you cleared. To clear a selection,
do the following:
1. Choose the Waveform Track view if you want to clear all the data from
the selection (or choose the Automation Parameters view if you only
want to clear from that parameter). To select a track view, click-hold
on the track view selector (located in the Track Controls section of the
Edit window) and drag down the list.
This determines the data that is cut from the track. (See the Remember
icon at the beginning of this section.)
2. Select the region or part of the region you want to copy. 
To select the entire region, use the Grabber tool and click anywhere on
that region within the track’s playlist. To select a portion of a region use
the Selector tool and drag across the region in the track’s playlist.
3. Choose Edit➪Clear from the main menu or press Command+B (on a
Mac) or Ctrl+B (on a PC). 
The selection is cleared from your session.
If you only cleared part of the region, Pro Tools creates new regions from the
remaining material in the region.
Performing a paste
When you paste a selection, the pasted material comes from the Clipboard —
the result of either a Copy or Cut command. To paste a selection, do the 
following:
1. Using the Selector tool, place your cursor where you want to paste the
material in the appropriate track.

Examining Edit Commands
390
If you want the selection to be right at the Start or End point of a region,
you can move the cursor to the right or left to put it there:
• Pressing the Tab key to move the cursor to the right.
• Press Ctrl+Tab (on a PC) or Option+Tab (on a Mac) to move the
cursor to the left.
2. Press Command+V (on a Mac) or Ctrl+V (on a PC) or choose Edit➪Paste
from the main menu. 
The material in the Clipboard is placed at the selection point.
If you paste a selection at an Edit Insert point (putting the cursor at a single
point) in Shuffle mode, the material to the right of the cursor slides over to
the end of the pasted section. If you paste into a selected section of the track,
the pasted material replaces the selected material.
Using the Duplicate command
Using the Duplicate command in Pro Tools is essentially the same as copying
and then pasting the Start point of the selection right after the End point of
the copied section. Duplicate makes quick work of creating loops. To dupli-
cate a selection:
1. Select the region or part of the region you want to duplicate. 
To select the entire region, use the Grabber tool and click anywhere on
that region within the track’s playlist. To select a portion of a region, use
the Selector tool and drag across the region in the track’s playlist.
2. Choose Edit➪Duplicate from the main menu or press Command+D
(on a Mac) or Ctrl+D (on a PC). 
The selection is copied and pasted at the End point.
If you want to construct loops, make sure that you’ve set the main time scale
of your session to Bars:Beats. Also, use the Selector tool to drag your selec-
tion or (if you’d rather type in a specific value) type in the number of bars or
beats in the Start and End points in the Event Edit area. This ensures that
your selection is duplicated and placed in the proper time location. Using
the Grabber tool may result in the material moving by a few samples in one
direction or another.

Performing a repeat
If you want to duplicate a selection more than once (when creating looped
sections, for instance) you can use the Repeat command. The Repeat com-
mand works the same way as the Duplicate command except that when you
choose Edit➪Repeat from the main menu (or press Option+R on a Mac or
Alt+R on a PC) the Repeat dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 3-22, where
you can enter the number of times you want to repeat the Paste part of the
procedure.
Each repeated selection is placed immediately after the previous one.

 Getting to know the Smart tool 
 Fixing waveforms
 Silencing regions
 Using processing plug-ins
 Performing fades and crossfades
A
side from the basic editing methods — the ones I describe in the first
three chapters of this minibook — Pro Tools offers some extra goodies
that can make the editing process easier. And what might I mean by goodies?
In this particular case, I’m talking about the aptly named Smart tool, the
Pencil tool, processing plug-ins, fades, and crossfades. This chapter lays out
these tools and helps turn you into a Pro Tools editing pro (or at least an
informed amateur). 
Signing On to the Smart Tool
The Smart Tool in Pro Tools is, well, smart. This tool consists of three tools
you’ve already had a chance to explore in Book 4, Chapter 3 — the Trimmer,
Selector, and Grabber. But it’s more than just these three tools. The Smart
tool actually changes the way it works depending on what you try to do with
it. For example, if you place the cursor close to the Start or End point of a
region, the Trimmer tool will be activated, whereas if you place the cursor
somewhere else within the region, the Selector or Grabber tool will appear,
depending on where you put the cursor.
To use the Smart tool, click the button located under the Selector tool in the
Edit window, as shown in Figure 4-1.

Signing On to the Smart Tool
394
Using the Smart tool in Waveform view
When you’re using the Smart tool with a track set to Waveform view, each
Edit tool in the Smart tool set (Trimmer, Selector, Grabber) becomes active
according to where you place the cursor in the region. (See Book 2, Chapter 4
for more on setting your view to Waveform view.) While you’re in Waveform
view, you can also perform fades and crossfades. This section details each of
these editing tools and/or techniques.
Trimmer tool
To activate the Trimmer tool when you’re in the Smart tool mode, position
your cursor near the Start or End point of the region you want to work with.
The Trimmer cursor appears, as shown in Figure 4-2. You can trim or extend
a region by clicking and dragging the Start or End point to the left or right.
Selector tool
You enable the Selector tool when you’re in the Smart tool mode by posi-
tioning your cursor in the upper half of the region, as shown in Figure 4-3.
When you see the Selector cursor, you can drag across the region to make
a selection.

Grabber tool
When you place the cursor in the lower half of a region — but not near the
Start or End point — you enable the Grabber tool, as shown in Figure 4-4. To
grab the region, click it when the Grabber cursor appears. You can then drag
the region to another place.
Fading in or out
Fade-ins and fade-outs are editing techniques where you make the volume of
the region increase from silence (fade in) or decrease to silence (fade out).
This is useful when you want to eliminate abrupt changes in sound, such as
clicks, when a region start or ends. You can use the Smart tool to perform a
fade-in or -out by placing the cursor in the upper corner of the region near
the Start point (for a fade-in) or End point (for a fade-out) and waiting until
the Fade icon appears, as shown in Figure 4-5. Then you can select the Fade
length by dragging your cursor to the right (to fade in) or left (to fade out).
(For more on fade-ins and fade-outs, see the “Performing Fades and
Crossfades” section, later in this chapter.)

Creating crossfades
A crossfade is when the volume of the first of two adjacent regions decreases
to silence while the second of these two regions increases from silence. This
smooths the transition going from one region to another. You can create a
crossfade between two adjacent regions by placing the cursor at the bottom
corner where the two regions adjoin and waiting until the Crossfade icon
appears, as shown in Figure 4-6. Once the icon appears, you can drag to 
the left or right to set the Crossfade length. (The “Performing Fades and
Crossfades” section, later in this chapter, has more on crossfades.)
Using the Smart tool in Automation view
To add to the versatility of the Smart tools (outlined in the previous section),
each tool in the set — Trimmer, Selector, and Grabber — performs differently
when you have a track set to one of the Automation views (Volume, Panning,
Mute, and Send Levels). (Book 2, Chapter 4 has more on track views; Book 6,
Chapter 6 has more on automating a mix.)

Automating the Trimmer tool
To select a region in one of the Automation views using the Smart version of
the Trimmer tool, position your cursor in the top 25 percent of the region. The
Trimmer icon appears, as shown in Figure 4-7. You can move your cursor up
and down to change the automation value or to create breakpoints (places
where changes occur in the automation curves). If you want finer control of
the Trimmer tool and your work, press Ctrl (PC) or Command (Mac) after
you begin trimming.
Automating the Selector tool
To use the Selector tool in Smart mode when you have one of the Automation
views set for a track, position your cursor in the lower 75 percent of the
region, as shown in Figure 4-8. You can then make your selection.
Automating the Grabber tool
To use the Smart version of the Grabber tool in a track set to one of the
Automation views, press Ctrl (on a PC) or Command (on a Mac) with your
cursor placed in the region, as shown in Figure 4-9.

You can use the Grabber tool in several different ways when you have a
track set to an Automation view. Here are two especially handy ways:
✦Editing existing breakpoints: Just position the cursor near one of these
points and the Grabber magically appears. You can increase the resolu-
tion of your movements to fine control by pressing Ctrl (on a PC) or
Command (on a Mac) after you start moving the breakpoint.
✦Constraining the Grabber vertically: To keep the Grabber from moving
right or left, press Shift — or, if you’ve set the tool to fine control, press
Ctrl+Shift (PC) or Command+Shift (Mac).
Perusing the Pencil Tool
In spite of all your effort to keep from creating any of the digital distortions
known as overs — also referred to as clipping — you may have one pop
through. No worries; you can use the Pencil tool to redraw the waveform and
get rid that nasty critter (is that cool, or what?). You can also use this tool to
remove other unwanted pops or clicks that show up in your precious tracks.
The Pencil tool, shown here in the margin, is only active when you zoom way
into a waveform, as shown in Figure 4-10.

Perusing the Pencil Tool
399
Using the Pencil tool to redraw a waveform is a destructive act; it changes
your original audio file permanently. Before you redraw, it’s a good idea to
make a copy of the original region (using the Duplicate function under the
AudioSuite menu) so you don’t lose the good stuff in the original file. The
next section tells you precisely how to do that.
Creating a copy of the original file
I strongly recommend making a copy of a region before you edit it with the
Pencil tool (see the Warning icon in the previous section). Here’s how it’s
done:
1. Select the region you want to work on.
2. Choose AudioSuite➪Duplicate from the main menu. 
The Duplicate dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 4-11.
3. Enable the Use in Playlist option on the right; make sure that Playlist
is chosen in the top-center field.
4. Click Process at the lower right.
You now have a copy of the original region that’s put in the track in place
of the original. (The original still resides in the Audio Regions list.)
Using the Pencil tool to redraw a waveform
To redraw a waveform (after you’ve made a copy of it — see the previous
section for why), follow these steps:
1. Find the area in the region that you want to edit.
2. Using the Zoomer tool, click repeatedly on the spot you want to edit
until you get into the sample level. 
The waveform will look like a single wavy line. (Refer to Figure 4-10.)
Figure 4-11:
The
Duplicate
dialog box.

Silencing Selections

3. Select the Pencil tool.
4. Locate the exact spot to edit.
Your target, typically a moment of distorted sound, is usually easy to see
because it looks like a sharp peak in the waveform (Figure 4-12, left). If
it isn’t apparent, you may need to adjust the horizontal until you can
see it clearly. (For more on adjusting the horizontal zoom, see Book 2,
Chapter 4.)
If you have trouble seeing the problem, use the Scrub tool to listen
to the audio. 
5. Draw over the waveform to round over the spot that was chopped off
when the note got “clipped” (Figure 4-12, right).
Take it easy on making changes to the waveform. All you want to do is
smooth out the peak, not change the sound too much.
Silencing Selections
Pro Tools offers a couple of ways to manage silence in selections: You can
strip silence from regions to reduce the size of your audio files and you can
insert silence into regions where you don’t want any sound. Both these
options are covered in this section.
Stripping silence
The Strip Silence command allows you to take a selection that meets a mini-
mum sound level and silence it. This divides the region that the silence was
stripped from into smaller regions. This lets you isolate sound effects or
Figure 4-12:

musical passages so you can quantize them or locate them at specific Synch
points within your session (check out Book 4, Chapter 3 for more on synch
points). Stripping silence from regions also allows you to compact your audio
file farther than you could if you didn’t strip the low-volume parts to silence.
(See the “Compacting a file” section, later in this chapter.) This technique
saves hard-disk space by making your audio files smaller.
Understanding the Strip Silence window
Whenever you use the Strip Silence command (see next section), a dialog win-
dow opens (see Figure 4-13) where you can set the parameters under which
the silence will be stripped from a region. These parameters include
✦Strip Threshold:. This setting determines the signal level below which
the audio is silenced.
✦Minimum Strip Duration: This parameter makes sure that if you have a
really small section that falls below the threshold, you don’t end up with
a ton of sections where silence was stripped and didn’t need to be.
✦Region Start Pad: This parameter adds a specified amount of time to
the beginning of each region created when you use the Strip Silence
command.
✦Region End Pad: This parameter is essentially the same as the previous
one except it adds time after the end of a region stripped from silence. 
✦Rename: This button opens The Rename Selected Regions dialog box
(see Figure 4-14) where you choose how new regions are named after
silence has been stripped.

Using the Strip Silence command
To strip silence from audio regions, follow these steps:
1. Select a region or part of a region.
Book 4, Chapter 2 has more on making selections.
2. Choose Windows➪Show Strip Silence from the main menu. 
The Strip Silence dialog box opens. (Refer to Figure 4-13.) 
3. Click the Rename button to set your region name preferences.
4. Adjust the parameter sliders until rectangles appear in the region and
any material you want to remove resides outside the rectangles, as
shown in Figure 4-15. 
This may take some time. If you want to increase the resolution of the
sliders, press Command (on a Mac) or Ctrl (on a PC) as you move them.

5. When you have the rectangles where you want them, click the Strip
button in the Strip Silence dialog box.
Any part of the region not in the rectangles is removed; each rectangled
section then becomes a new region, using the naming scheme that you
choose in the Rename window.
Inserting silence
If you’re like most people, you keep the session rolling — even when you
don’t play anything during certain passages — in order to keep the feel hap-
pening throughout the tune. In this case, it’s not uncommon to have passages
where pretty much nothing is recorded (well, except for maybe a cough or a
chair squeak). Rather than cutting those sections out of your track you can
insert silence into those sections instead. Using the Insert Silence command
you can put silence anywhere you want within a track quickly and easily.
Keep in mind, though, that inserting silence into tracks works differently for
each Edit mode. This can often prove confusing, so to help you keep things
straight, I not only show you how to insert silence, but also let you know
what conditions apply when you use the different Edit modes.
Inserting an amount of silence
You insert silence into a track with the following steps:
1. Select the part of a region that you want to silence using the Selector
tool and click-drag across the section of the region you want to select.
2. Choose Edit➪Insert Silence from the main menu or press Shift+
Command+E (on a Mac) or Shift+Ctrl+E (on a PC).
The selected section is silenced.
Understanding the results
When you’re using the Insert Silence command, each Edit mode treats certain
conditions differently. The difference depends on the mode in use at the time:
✦Shuffle mode: If the track(s) you selected is set to Waveform view, all
audio and automation data is cleared and all subsequent regions are
shuffled the amount of the silence. 
✦Slip mode: If the track(s) you selected is set to Waveform view, all audio
and automation data is cleared. On the other hand, if your track is set to
one of the Automation views, only the data from that view is removed. 
✦Grid mode. All audio and automation data is cleared. This is essentially
the same as using the clear command (Book 4, Chapter 3). All the regions
stay where they are in the session when the silence is inserted.

Performing Fades and Crossfades
404
Performing Fades and Crossfades
Fade-ins and fade-outs are techniques where you make the volume of the
region increase from silence (fade in) or decrease to silence (fade out). This
is useful when you want to eliminate abrupt changes in sound, such as
clicks, when a region start or ends. A crossfade is the combination of a fade-
out and a fade-in that happens at the junction of two adjacent regions to
make the transition between these two regions smooth. You can create fade-
ins, fade-outs, and crossfades — faster and easier than ever before — in Pro
Tools. You can use fades to bring regions in and out of a mix or to make a
seamless transition from one adjoining region to another. One of the key
aspects of creating fades is creating a curve (the way the fade happens) that
fits the material you want to fade and it shouldn’t surprise you that Pro
Tools gives you many options for shaping your curves. 
Dealing with the Fades dialog box
Whatever kind of fade you create — fade-in, fade-out, or crossfade — the
fade is made according to the settings in the Fades dialog box. You access the
Fade dialog box by choosing Edit➪Fades➪Create Fades from the main menu.
After you get the dialog box up on your computer screen (as in Figure 4-16),
you can adjust the following parameters to meet your needs:
✦Audition: Clicking this button plays the crossfade so you can hear what
your settings will sound like.
✦View First Track: Pro Tools lets you select more than one track to cross-
fade at one time. (The crossfade, however, takes place on each track and
not across tracks.) The View First Track button allows you to view and
audition the first of the tracks selected.
✦View Second Track: In a selection that includes more than one track,
this button shows you the second track. If you have more than two
tracks selected, you can’t view beyond the second.
✦View Both Tracks: Clicking this button lets you view and audition both
tracks selected for crossfading.
✦Fade Curves Only: Enabling this button shows the fade curves but not
the waveforms for the audio you want to crossfade.
✦Fade Curves and Separate Waveforms: This button lets you see both the
fade curves and the waveforms for each track. The fade out waveform
shows up above the fade in waveform.
✦Fade Curves and Superimposed Waveforms: This button superimposes
the two waveforms one on top of the other and shows the fade curves.

✦Out Shape Setting: This box lets you select the shape of the fade out
curve. You have three options:
• Standard: This setting uses a basic fade-out shape that you can adjust
by clicking the curve and dragging the curve the way you want it.
• S-Curve: This setting creates an “S” shaped curve that you can adjust
by clicking the curve and dragging to the shape you want. (Well, as
long as it’s an S-shape.)
• Presets: Clicking here presents you with a pop-up menu containing
seven preset curves for you to choose from, as shown in Figure 4-17.
You can change a preset by clicking one of the End points and drag-
ging it.
✦Link settings: You have the following three choices on how you want the
fade-out and fade-in curves of your crossfades to relate to one another:
• Equal power: This option keeps the relative volume of the Fade Out
and Fade In regions the same. This selection is best for material that
differs greatly in sound character, such as the fading out of one
instrument and the fading in of another.
• Equal Gain: This setting keeps the Fade In and Fade Out selections
from summing together and overloading the track, resulting in clip-
ping (distortion). This setting is best for selections that have the
same relative volume and phase, such as one drum loop to another.
• None: This setting leaves the two fades independent of one another.
This gives you more flexibility to create unique fades. If you want to
edit the Fade In curve only, press Alt (on a PC) or Option (on a Mac)
while you drag the curve. To adjust the Fade Out only, press Ctrl (on
a PC) or Command (on a Mac) while you drag the curve.

✦Use Dither: Clicking this option applies dither — a way to improve the
sound of very quiet material. (Book 7, Chapter 2 has more on dither.)
You don’t need this box checked if you crossfade fairly loud material,
but it’s a good idea if the audio is quiet.
✦In Shape Setting: This box lets you select the shape of the Fade In curve.
As was the case with Out Shape setting, there are two options:
• Standard: This setting uses a basic fade in shape that you can adjust
by clicking the curve and dragging the curve the way you want it.
• S-Curve: This setting creates an S-shaped Fade In curve that you can
adjust by clicking the curve and dragging it to the shape you want
(as long as it’s an S-shape).
✦Presets: As you might have guessed, there are seven preset curves that
you can choose from — mirror images of the curves found in the Out
Shape Presets menu. You can change them by clicking one of the End
points and dragging it.
Creating crossfades
There are three types of crossfades: centered, pre, and post. These different
flavors — and the actual process of creating a crossfade — are covered in
this section.
Creating a centered crossfade
The centered crossfade is the most common type of crossfade and is great for
times when the material in the two regions fits well together — such as with
two different takes of a lead vocal part that end up being your final vocal track.
Center crossfades are fades where the crossfade happens evenly between
the two regions, incorporating audio on both sides of two regions’ splice
points (the point where they meet). In order for this type of crossfade to
work, you need audio data after the End point of the first region and before
the Start point of the second region.
To create a center crossfade, follow these steps:
1. Using the Selector tool, drag from the point where you want the cross-
fade to start (in the first region) to where you want the crossfade to
end (in the second region), as shown in Figure 4-18. 
2. Choose Edit➪Fades➪Create Fades from the main menu or press
Command+F (on a Mac) or Ctrl+F (on a PC). 
The Fades dialog box opens. (Refer to Figure 4-16.)

Performing Fades and Crossfades
408
3. Enter your crossfade preferences in the Fades dialog box as listed in
the previous section, “Dealing with the Fades dialog box.”
Make adjustments to the view, the Fade In and Fade Out curves, and the
Link option — auditioning the crossfade periodically as you go — until
you have the crossfade you want.
4. When you’re happy with the sound of the crossfade, click OK. 
Your crossfade will be calculated. You can change the duration of the
fade by trimming it (see the “Trimming a crossfade” section later in this
chapter).
Creating a pre-crossfade
This type of crossfade happens before the Start point of the second region,
as shown in Figure 4-19. This is a good type of crossfade to use when you
have an initial attack (a cymbal crash, for example) that happens right at the
Start point of the second region. In this example, if the second region isn’t at
full volume when the crash happens you lose the impact of the cymbal. The
pre-crossfade ensures that you get the full impact of the cymbal. For this
crossfade to work, audio data has to be in place before the Start point of the
second region.

crossfade

Follow these steps to create a pre-crossfade:
1. Using the Selector tool, click in the region at the point where you want
the pre-crossfade to begin.
2. Shift-drag or press Shift+Tab to select to the end of the region.
3. Choose Edit➪Fades➪Create Fades from the main menu or press
Command+F (on a Mac) or Ctrl+F (on a PC).
The Fades dialog box makes its appearance. (Refer to Figure 4-16.)
4. Choose your Fade settings and audition them, adjusting the settings as
you go until you have the fade that you want.
5. Click OK.
The fade is created.
Creating a post-crossfade
The post-crossfade happens after the end of the first region, as shown in
Figure 4-20. This type of crossfade is useful for times when you have a sound
that continues all the way up to the end of the first region (to keep the drum
theme going, a hi-hat note, for instance) and you want to make sure that the
last hi-hat doesn’t drop off in volume as it’s being hit. This type of crossfade
only works if the first region contains audio data after its End point. 
Follow these steps to create a post-crossfade:
1. Using the Selector tool, click in the region at the point where you want
the fade to end.
2. Shift-drag or press Shift+Option+Tab (on a Mac) or Shift+Alt+Tab (on
a PC) to select back to the region’s Start point.
3. Choose Edit➪Fades➪Create Fades from the main menu or press
Command+F (on a Mac) or Ctrl+F (on a PC) to open the Fades dialog
box. (Refer to Figure 4-16.)

5. Click OK.
The fade is created.
Removing a crossfade
To remove a crossfade, select the crossfade with the Grabber tool and press
Delete (on a Mac) or Backspace (on a PC). You can also choose Edit➪
Fades➪Delete Fades from the main menu.
Trimming a crossfade
Here’s how to change the boundaries of a crossfade:
1. Select the crossfade by double-clicking with the Selector tool or grab-
bing with the Grabber tool.
2. Using the Trimmer tool, click and drag either side of the crossfade.
Fading in and out
A fade-in is where you make the volume of the region increase from silence
in order to smooth the transition into the region. A fade-out is a decrease in
volume that is useful when you want to smooth the transition out of a region.
These types of fades are often used when you have accent parts that come
and go in the song — keyboard or guitar licks that counterpoint the lead
vocal, for instance — and you want them to seamlessly flow in and out of the
song. Without a fade into or out of the region you may hear abrupt changes
in the sound due to the background noise in those parts. 
You can fade a single region in or out by using the Fades dialog box. Creating
these fades saves you the trouble of performing automation curves to fade
in or out. (Of course, you can still do that, but it does use more of your com-
puter’s processing power. I explain the process in Book 6, Chapter 6.)
Fading in to the beginning of a region
To fade in to a single region, follow these steps:
1. Using the Selector tool, select the beginning of the region you want to
fade into. 
To make this process work, you have to begin your selection point
before (or at) the Start point — not after it.
2. Choose Edit➪Fades➪Create Fades from the main menu or press Ctrl+F
(on a PC) or Command+F (on a Mac).
The Fades dialog box appears. (Refer to Figure 4-16.)

Cleaning Up Your Session

Cleaning Up Your Session
After you’ve done all your editing, you probably have a ton of regions in your
Audio Regions list. Things can get cluttered up pretty quick, so before I start
mixing the song, I like to clean up my session by consolidating regions, getting
rid of any unused regions, and compacting the regions that I do want to use.
Doing these things both makes it easier to deal with the regions in the ses-
sion and frees up hard disk space. It can also make playing the tracks easier
on your hard disk, depending on how many tracks you have in your session. 
Consolidating selections
You can consolidate regions that make up a section of a song by using the
Consolidate Selections command. In effect, you take a bunch of regions — for
instance, the various assembled takes of your guitar part that create the parts
for a song’s verse — and make them into one region. This makes moving or
copying this section easier and makes for a less-cluttered track playlist.
To consolidate selections, follow these steps:
1. Select the regions you want to consolidate using either the Selector
tool or the Grabber tool or, if you want to select all the regions in the
track, triple-click anywhere in the track’s playlist.
2. Choose Edit➪Consolidate Selection from the main menu or press
Option+Shift+3 (on a Mac) Alt+Shift+3 (on a PC). 
The selected regions are replaced by a new region, which contains all
the audio from the selection, including any muted regions.
Automation data is not consolidated. If you have regions that you want to
consolidate and you want to keep any automation data at all, your best bet
is to do a bounce procedure for that selection. (I cover bounce procedures
in Book 6, Chapter 7.)
Removing unused regions
You can easily get rid of any regions that are not being used in your session.
Here’s how :
1. Open the Audio Regions pop-up menu by click-holding on the Audio
Regions title at the top of the Audio Regions list located on the right
side of the Edit window. 

Book IV
Chapter 4
Adding to Your
Editing Palette
Cleaning Up Your Session
415
2. Under Select➪Unused Regions in the Audio Regions List pop-up menu
or press Shift+Command+U (on a Mac) or Shift+Ctrl+U (on a PC).
All regions in the list that aren’t included in any tracks in the session are
highlighted.
3. Choose Clear Selected from the Audio Regions list pop-up menu. 
The Clear Audio dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 4-25, asking if
you either want to remove the regions from the session or delete the
audio files from your hard drive. Choose the option you prefer.
Removing the regions from your present session will ensure that you have
the region to use in another session, but it won’t reduce the amount of stuff
on your hard drive. If you want to free up space and know that you won’t use
the region in another session, delete it to save disk space.
Compacting a file
You can compact an audio file (make it smaller) by using the Compact Selected
command from the Audio Regions pop-up menu. Compacting an audio file
in Pro Tools deletes any audio data that is not being used. This reduces the
amount of space taken up in your hard drive, which makes backing up your
data a quicker process.
Compacting an audio file is like taking all the pieces of tape that were cut
from reels of recorded tape and — gasp — throwing them away. (Well, okay,
that’s what it would have been like in the days before digital audio.) My point
is that, once you compact a file, you’re committed to the results. This is one
of the few editing tasks that you can do that you can’t undo afterward.
Figure 4-25:
The Clear
Audio dialog
box lets you
get rid of
any regions
you aren’t
using in your
session.

Cleaning Up Your Session
416
You only want to compact an audio file after you’ve done all your editing
and you’re sure you don’t want any of the unused data. (You’re sure. Right?)
To compact a region, follow these steps:
1. Choose the region(s) you want to compact from the Audio Regions list.
2. Open the Audio Regions pop-up menu by click-holding over the Audio
Regions title at the top of the Audio Regions list and then choosing
Compact. 
The Compact dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 4-26.
3. In the Padding field, enter the amount of padding you want on your
regions. 
Padding is the amount of data on either side of the region’s Start and End
points that may contain fade information. If you have fades in the region,
set your padding amount to the length of the fade to insure that your
fades still work. 
4. Click Compact.
Pro Tools deletes all the data outside the region and its padding.

IDI functions in Pro Tools are new to the program, so at this point in
time MIDI is still pretty basic. For the home recordist without heavy-
duty MIDI needs (you know who you are), using MIDI in Pro Tools is simpler
than in many other MIDI-intensive programs such as Logic or Sonar. Even
though MIDI isn’t exactly the Pro Tools strong suit, it still offers plenty of
functions that can help make your music shine.
In this chapter, I walk you through the process of setting up your system
and session to record MIDI in Pro Tools. Along the way, you discover how to
set up your devices, create MIDI tracks, and enable them for recording. You
also get a chance to create a click track to play along with that makes editing
MIDI faster and easier.
Setting Up Your MIDI Devices
The process of setting up your MIDI device varies according to whether you
use a Mac or a PC. Either way, though, setting up a MIDI device only takes a
couple of minutes. This section walks you through the process.
Enabling MIDI devices in Mac OSX
Before you can record MIDI in Mac OS X, you need to do three separate
things: a) set up your MIDI devices in OS X; b) enable the MIDI channels,
which lets you choose the MIDI channels that each device receives and
sends data on; and c) enable the input devices in Pro Tools so that you can
actually use those devices in Pro Tools.

Setting Up Your MIDI Devices
420
To configure your MIDI devices in OS X, follow these steps:
1. Using your MIDI cables, connect the devices you want to use with Pro
Tools to either the Digidesign hardware or to a separate MIDI interface.
2. Click the Audio MIDI Setup icon (see margin) in the Dock.
The Audio MIDI Setup window opens.
3. Click the MIDI Devices tab of the Audio MIDI Setup window.
A message appears that tells you your system is being scanned. Once
the scan is complete, your MIDI interface should appear in the tab’s
window, along with any devices connected to it, as shown in Figure 1-1.
4. If one or more of your devices don’t appear, double-check your cables
for proper connection, and then click the Rescan MIDI icon. 
5. If your device still doesn’t appear, click Add Device. In the dialog box
that appears, enter the name, manufacturer, and model number of the
device, and then click OK.
6. After your devices appear in the MIDI Devices tab of the Audio MIDI
Setup window, close the window by choosing Audio MIDI Setup➪Quit
Audio MIDI Setup from the main menu (or press Commmand+Q). You
can also close this window by clicking on the red X in the upper-left
corner of the window.
To enable MIDI channels in your devices

1. Click the Audio MIDI Setup icon (see margin) in the Dock.
The Audio MIDI Setup window opens. (Refer to Figure 1-1.)
2. Click the MIDI Devices tab of the Audio MIDI Setup window.
All MIDI devices connected to your MIDI interface should appear in the
tab’s window
3. In the MIDI Devices tab of the Audio MIDI Setup window, double-click
the device for which you want to activate MIDI channels. 
The Device window appears.
4. Click the More Properties tab to expand the window. 
The window expands to include Basic and Expert tabs containing settings
you can make to your device.
5. Click the Basic Tab. 
6. In the Transmits and Receives section of the Basics tab, click the chan-
nel number(s) that you want to be able to transmit and receive data
through. 
Blue highlighted channels are active.
7. Click OK to close the Device window.
8. Close the Audio MIDI Setup window by clicking the red X in the
upper-left of the window or by pressing Command+Q.
You can receive MIDI data from other software programs through the Pro
Tools inputs. This is useful if you want to use a separate MIDI sequencer
(such as Logic) to record and edit your MIDI performances before you bring
it into Pro Tools. If you want to do more intensive MIDI editing than Pro
Tools offers, this option can be real handy. (For more on using inputs, see
Book 5, Chapter 2.) 
If you use any control surfaces such as the Mackie Control or if you want to
synch your system to another using MMC (MIDI machine control), you must
enable the devices for these tasks in the MIDI Input Enable dialog box, along
with your other MIDI devices. 
To enable input devices in Pro Tools, follow these steps:
1. Choose MIDI➪Input Devices from the main menu. 
The MIDI Input Enable dialog box opens, displaying all the MIDI ports in
your system, as shown in Figure 1-2.
2. Check the boxes for the devices you want to use.
3. Click OK.

Setting Up Your MIDI Devices
422
Enabling MIDI devices in Windows XP
Enabling MIDI devices is as easy as adding a printer to your system. 
To configure MIDI devices in Windows XP:
1. Install the drivers for your MIDI device as described in the device’s
manual. 
If you use the MIDI ports in your Digidesign interface, this step was
already done when you installed the software, as I describe in Book 2,
Chapter 1.
2. Using your MIDI cables, connect the devices you want to use with Pro
Tools to either the Digidesign hardware or to a separate MIDI interface.
3. Turn on the power for the device. 
At this point, your device should show up in your MIDI tracks’ Input and
Output selector pop-up menus. If not, restart your computer. If this still
doesn’t work, you may need to go into the Device Driver menu and man-
ually move the driver for your device into the Device Driver folder. 
To enable input devices in Pro Tools. the steps are just like those you’d use
for a Mac:
1. Choose MIDI➪Input Devices from the main menu. 
The MIDI Input Enable dialog box opens, showing the MIDI ports in your
system.
2. Check the boxes for the devices you want to use.
3. Click OK.

Running MIDI Thru
MIDI Thru allows you to hear what your MIDI instrument is playing while the
track it’s assigned to is record-enabled. Pro Tools also lets you set up a default
MIDI Thru instrument, so that you don’t have to choose a device each time
you enable a MIDI track. Pro Tools uses the designated MIDI Thru instrument
automatically. 
To enable MIDI Thru, all you have to do is choose MIDI➪MIDI Thru from the
main menu.
When you enable MIDI Thru, you also need to disable Local Control in each
of your devices to keep them from receiving double messages and creating
stuck notes. This is done within each of your MIDI devices. Consult your
device’s manual for details on how to do this.
If, for some reason, you end up with some stuck notes, choose MIDI➪All
Notes Off from the main menu or press Ctrl+Shift+period (.) on a PC or
Command+Shift+period (.) on a Mac.
To set the default MIDI Thru instrument:
1. Choose Setups➪Preferences from the main menu. 
The Preferences dialog box opens.
2. Click the MIDI Tab. 
The MIDI Preferences dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 1-3.
Figure 1-3:
The MIDI
Preferences
menu lets
you choose
the default

session.

Setting Up Your MIDI Devices
424
3. Choose the MIDI device — as well as the channel you want to use to
play the MIDI data — from the Default Thru Instrument drop-down
menu.
4. Click Done.
Managing the MIDI Input filter
The MIDI Input filter allows you to ignore certain MIDI data while recording.
For example you can have Pro Tools ignore aftertouch or pitch bend mes-
sages when you record a drum part using your keyboard. This can be handy
if you want to avoid recording system exclusive data — messages that are
exclusive to the device and not related to performance information — when
recording a MIDI performance.
To set the MIDI Input Filter parameters:
1. Choose MIDI➪Input Filter from the main menu. 
The MIDI Input Filter dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 1-4.
2. Select the Record options (All, Only, All Except) by checking your
selection.
Choosing All means that Pro Tools will record all the MIDI messages
received, whereas choosing Only means that only the parameters that
you select in Step 3 are recorded, and choosing All Except sets your
system to record all the MIDI data it receives except for the boxes you
check in Step 3.
Figure 1-4:

Input Filter
dialog box

3. Depending on the mode you chose (see previous step) check the boxes
in the Channel Info and Controllers sections that correspond to what
you want to include or exclude from the recording process.
4. Depending on the choice you made in Step 2 and whether you want to
include any system-exclusive data in your recording, either check or
uncheck the System Exclusive box. 
If you chose All in Step 2 checking or unchecking this box doesn’t
matter — system-exclusive data is recorded either way. If you chose
Only in Step 2, checking this box means system exclusive data is
recorded and if you chose All Except in Step 2, checking this box 
means that system-exclusive data is not recorded. 
5. Click OK.
Quantizing your inputs
You can have Pro Tools automatically quantize your performance — adjust
the position of each note’s timing so that it fits within a specified time frame.
This can be useful if you want the timing of your performance to fit a selected
grid exactly.
Be careful with quantizing. Stop short of doing too much — it’s real easy to
suck the life out of a performance.
To quantize your input
1. Choose MIDI➪Input Quantize from the main menu. 
The Input Quantize dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 1-5.
Figure 1-5:
In the Input
Quantize
dialog box,
you can
automati-
cally adjust

of your
perform-
ance as it’s
recorded.

Setting Up Your MIDI Devices
426
2. Check the Enable Input Quantize box to quantize and enter the rest of
the options/parameters in the window. 
Here’s a rundown on what each of these parameters mean:
What to quantize: The section lets you choose the part of the note to
quantize.
Attack. The filed sets the quantization to the start of the selected
notes.
Release. Clicking this field quantizes the ends of the notes. 
Preserve Note Duration. Clicking this field produces different results
depending on whether you choose Attack or Release. 
With Attack selected, Preserve Note Duration keeps the end of the
note intact and with Release selected the start of the note is left
intact. If both Attack and Release are selected the Preserve Note
Duration option is dimmed.
Quantize grid: This section is where you choose the resolution of the
quantize grid, from whole notes to 32nd notes. 
Note Selector. This section lets you choose the note value of your
quantize grid. Click the note to select it.
Tuplet. Checking this box lets you select odd note groupings such
as triplets. When you check this option, you need to fill in the tuplet
value. For example to create a regular eighth-note triplet choose “3 in
time 1” and for a quarter note triplet choose “3 in time 2.”
Offset Grid By. This option lets you move the quantize grid forward
or backward in time by the selected number of ticks. This is helpful
for creating grooves that lie slightly ahead or behind the beat.
Swing. This field lets you create a swing (dotted quarter-eighth note
triplet) feel. You specify a percentage (from 0 to 300) with 100% being
a triplet feel.
Options: You can include other options with your quantize operation.
These include:
Include Within. Selecting this option only quantizes the notes that fall
within the boundaries created with this setting. Your setting ranges
are from 0 to 100% with the smaller number affecting the narrower
range of notes.
Exclude Within. Exclude Within lets you choose to exclude any notes
within the boundaries set in this field. Like with Include Within, you
can set your boundaries between 0 and 100%.

Book V
Chapter 1

Setting Up Your MIDI Devices
427
Strength. This is, in my opinion, the most useful function in the Pro
Tool’s quantize operation. Using this option lets you move your
quantized notes by a percentage rather than just snapping them
right to the grid. Your setting range runs from 0 to 100%, with the
higher numbers keeping more strictly to the grid than lower values.
Randomize. This option adds a level of randomness to the quantiz-
ing of your selection. This can further help with keeping your rhythm
from being too rigid. You can select values between 0 and 100%. Lower
values place the randomized notes closer to the grid.
3. Press Enter (on a PC) or Return (on a Mac) to close the window.
Offsetting MIDI tracks
Pro Tools lets you offset your MIDI tracks to be a specified amount of time in
your session. This can be especially handy if you record your MIDI track
while listening to your sound device through the Digidesign interface; you
may notice some delay (also called latency) in the sound. This delay is the
result of the time it takes the sound to travel through the interface, into the
computer, and then back out the interface to your speakers. Depending on
the Buffer setting you have in your session, this latency may be large enough
to bother you. (Book 2, Chapter 3 has more on Buffer settings.)
The way around this problem is to offset your MIDI tracks by moving them
to a point earlier in your session by the amount of the delay. This makes Pro
Tools play the MIDI track(s) earlier so you can hear them on time.
To offset all of your MIDI tracks, follow these steps:
1. Choose Setups➪Preferences from the main menu. 
The Preferences dialog box opens.
2. Click the MIDI Tab. 
The MIDI Preferences dialog box opens. (Refer to Figure 1-3.)
3. Enter a negative number equal to your H/W buffer setting in the
Global MIDI Offset field. 
This offset amount uses samples (the individual snapshots of the audio
in your session) as the unit of measure. 
4. Click Done.
Your specified offset will compensate for the latency.

Getting Ready to Record
428
To offset a single track, follow these steps:
1. Choose Windows➪Show MIDI Track Offsets from the main menu.
The MIDI Track Offsets window opens.
2. On the row for the track you want to offset, double-click the Sample
Offset column. 
The field is highlighted.
3. Enter the offset value in the Sample Offset column. 
A negative number moves the track to an earlier point in the session; a
positive number moves it later. Enter a value equal to the H/W buffer set-
ting (as described in Book 2, Chapter 3).
4. Press Return (on a Mac) or Enter (on a PC) to save the value and close
the window.
Getting Ready to Record
Setting up MIDI tracks involves first creating the tracks for your session and
then setting the inputs, outputs, and MIDI channels for the tracks you created.
This section spells out how to do all these tasks.
Creating MIDI tracks
Of course, before you can manipulate a MIDI track, you’ve got to have one.
To create a new MIDI track, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪New Track from the main menu. 
The New Track dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 1-6.
2. Enter the number of tracks you want to create.
3. Select MIDI Track from the drop-down menu.
4. Click Create.
Your new track(s) appear in both the Edit and the Mix windows.
Figure 1-6:
The New
Track dialog
box lets you
create new
MIDI tracks.

Book V
Chapter 1
Preparing to 
Record MIDI
Getting Ready to Record
429
When you create a new track a default name is used — something not entirely
useful (like MIDI 1). You can rename this track by following these steps:
1. Double-click the track name in the Edit window.
The Name Track dialog box appears.
2. Type in the new name and add any comments about the track in the
appropriate places.
3. Click OK to close the window.
Your track gets a — hopefully more helpful — new name.
Setting inputs, outputs, and MIDI channels
For MIDI tracks, like with audio tracks, you need to select the input and
output sources for your MIDI data in order to be able to record and play back
your tracks. Where MIDI tracks differ from audio tracks is that you also need
to set the MIDI channel(s) through which the MIDI data for each track travels.
You can set the inputs and outputs for your MIDI tracks in either the Edit or
Mix window. If you want to set these in the Edit window, make sure that
you’ve set up the window so that it displays the Input and Output sections
(Choosing Display➪➪Edit Window Show➪I/O View gets that done for you). 
To set the input on a MIDI track, follow these steps:
1. Click the MIDI Input Selector pop-up menu.
You find the selector in the Track Controls section of the Edit window
and above the track’s fader in the Mix window.
2. Drag through the menu to the MIDI device and channel you want.
3. Release your mouse.
To set the output for your MIDI track, follow these steps:
1. Click the MIDI Output Selector pop-up menu.
You find the selector in the Track Controls section of the Edit window
and above the track’s fader in the Mix window.
2. Drag through the menu to the MIDI device and channel you want.
3. Release your mouse button.
You can assign multiple destinations for your MIDI tracks by pressing Ctrl
(on a Mac) or Start/Windows (on PC) when you select your input and output
assignments.

Any devices and MIDI channels that are already assigned to another track are
listed in bold letters. This makes it easy to keep from accidentally assigning
two tracks to the same device and channels (although you can if you want to).
Creating a click track
Click tracks (a metronome to play to) are useful for making sure that your
performance data lines up with the bars and beats of your session. Having
your MIDI line up allows you to do a variety of editing tasks much faster and
more accurately.
To create a click track, you need to set a tempo and meter and enable the
click in the Transport window. I cover the steps for these procedures in this
section.
Setting the tempo
To set the tempo and meter of your session, or a section within your ses-
sion, do the following:
1. Double-click the Meter button in the expanded Transport window —
check out Book 2, Chapter 4 for more on expanding the Transport
window — or choose Windows➪Show Tempo/Meter from the main
menu.
The Tempo/Meter Change dialog box appears. 
2. Choose Tempo Change from the drop-down menu.
The Tempo Change view of the Tempo/Meter Change dialog box, shown
in Figure 1-7, has the following four parameters to adjust:
Snap to Bar: Checking this box aligns any tempo event you create to
the first beat in the nearest bar. (See the “Setting up tempo and
meter events” section in Book 3, Chapter 3.)

Location: This is where you type the location at which this tempo
begins. Choosing 1/1/000 makes this the default tempo for the song.
Tempo: This box lets you type in the tempo, in beats per minute
(BPM).
Resolution: This menu lets you choose the note value that gets one
beat for the tempo of the song or song’s section. The default is 1/4 note.
Choosing the meter
You can set the meter for the session by doing the following:
1. Double-click the Meter button in the expanded Transport window —
check out Book 2, Chapter 4 for more on expanding the Transport
window — or choose Windows➪Show Tempo/Meter from the main
menu.
The Tempo/Meter Change dialog box appears. 
2. Choose Meter Change from the drop-down menu.
The Meter Change view of the Tempo/Meter Change dialog box, shown
in Figure 1-8, has the following four parameters to adjust:
Snap to Bar: Check this box to have any meter events align to the
first beat in the nearest bar. (See the “Setting up tempo and meter
events” section in Book 3, Chapter 3.)
Location: The number you enter in this box determines the beginning
of the meter (time signature) event. For songs with only one time sig-
nature, you enter 1/1/000.
Meter: This box lets you type in the meter that you want to use. 
Click: This menu lets you choose the note value for the clicks that
are played in each measure. Choosing 1/4 note means you’ll hear
four clicks in a 4/4 measure.

Configuring your device
Of course, to play a click track in Pro Tools, you need a device to create the
sound (details, details). This can be an external MIDI sound module (such as
a drum machine or keyboard) or the DigiRack Click plug-in.
Follow these steps to configure the click-track device:
1. Choose MIDI➪Click Options from the main menu or double-click
the Click or Countoff button in the Transport window.
The Click/Countoff Options dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 1-9.
2. In the Click/Countoff Options dialog box, use the Output drop-down
menu to choose the device to play your click.
If your using an external device, choose the port and MIDI channel that
your device is connected to. If you’re using the Click plug-in choose None.
3. Choose when you want the click to be played by selecting from the
options at the top of the window. 
You can choose between During Play and Record, Only During Record,
and Only During Countoff.
4. Select the MIDI note, velocity, and duration for the accented and unac-
cented notes of the click in the appropriate boxes.
5. Select whether you want a countoff or not and the number of bars
you want. 
Selecting Only During Record means that there’s no countoff when you
play back the track. If you select one of the other options and decide
that you still don’t want any countoff, type in 0 bars in the Bars box.

The next order of business is to enable your click track, which you can do in
one of two ways:
✦Choose MIDI➪Click from the main menu.
✦Click the Click button in the MIDI section of the Transport window.
When Click is engaged, this button is blue.
You can engage the countoff by clicking the Countoff button in the MIDI sec-
tion of the Transport window. This button displays the number of bars that
the countoff is set for. This button is blue when it’s engaged.
If you want to use the Click plug-in — rather than an external device — to
play the click, do the following: 
1. Create a new auxiliary track by choosing File➪New Track from the
main menu or pressing Shift+Command+N (on a Mac) or Shift+Ctrl+N
(on a PC). 
2. In the track you created in Step 1, select one of your hardware inputs
from the Input Selector pop-up menu.
3. Use the Output selector to set the output of the track to the main out-
puts (the outputs you use for your monitors - usually 1 & 2).
4. Make sure that the Inserts option is chosen under the Mix Window
Shows menu. (Choose Displays➪Mix Window Shows to check.)
5. Choose Click from the Inserts pop-up menu (click-hold over the arrow
and drag to the plug-in) for the track you just created, as shown in
Figure 1-10. 
Your chosen click plays according to your choice in the Click/Countoff
dialog-box menu.

I usually use a drum machine or other decent drum sound from an external
device to create my click track. The Click plug-in, as handy as it is, doesn’t
have the most-pleasing sound.

R
ecording MIDI in Pro Tools is much like recording audio. The advan-
tage with MIDI is that you only record the performance data and not
the sound itself. This allows you flexibility in choosing the sound that you
ultimately want for your song. 
In this chapter, you discover the process of recording MIDI in Pro Tools. You
walk through enabling your tracks and recording your MIDI data. You also
get a chance to overdub using use punch and loop recording.
Recording MIDI Performances
If you read Book 3, Chapter 4, you pretty much know the basics about record-
ing MIDI performances, because the process is very similar to recording
audio tracks. The only significant difference is that you can set your system
to wait until it receives MIDI data before starting to record. (This keeps you
from having to hit the Record button in the Transport window.) This section
details how to record single or multiple MIDI tracks.
Enabling recording for MIDI tracks
You can record-enable your MIDI tracks the same way you enable recording
for audio tracks. Let me count the ways:
✦To record-enable a single track: Click the Record Enable button, which
you can find in either the track’s channel strip (in the Mix window) or
the track menu (in the Edit window). The Record Enable button blinks
red to let you know it’s engaged.
✦To record-enable all tracks: Option+click (on a Mac) or Alt+click (on a
PC) the Record Enable button on any track.

Recording MIDI Performances
436
✦To record-enable selected tracks: Shift+click to select the tracks you
want in the playlist and then Shift+Option+click (on a Mac) or
Shift+Alt+click (on a PC) the Record Enable button of one of the
selected tracks.
Setting the Wait for Note option
One of the nice things about recording MIDI in Pro Tools is that you can set
your session to start recording only after it starts receiving MIDI data. This
feature is called Wait for Note, and it allows you to make sure that your first
note is timed exactly where Record Start Time is set.
To enable the Wait for Note feature, do the following:
1. Set your Transport window to display MIDI controls by choosing
Display➪Transport Window Shows➪MIDI Controls from the main
menu.
The Transport window expands to include MIDI controls.
2. Click the Wait for Note button to highlight it, as shown in Figure 2-1.
Recording MIDI tracks in Pro Tools requires that you get a few tasks out of
the way first — choose the Record mode, create a track, set levels, enable
recording, and turn on a click track if you’re using one. Those steps are all
covered in detail in Book 3, Chapter 3; when you’ve got ’em done, you’re
ready to record some MIDI. 
This section gives you a basic overview of what you can do at that point —
record a single track or multiple tracks, undo or cancel takes, record addi-
tional takes, audition takes, and use playlists to organize the whole mess, or
choose some takes to listen to.

Monitoring MIDI inputs
Even after you get your MIDI devices all hooked up and record-enabled, you
still won’t hear what you’re playing unless you make some connection to the
analog outputs of your MIDI device and route them to an audio track in Pro
Tools.
To monitor your MIDI device through Pro Tools, do the following: 
1. Connect the analog output of your MIDI device to one of the analog
inputs in your Digidesign hardware.
2. Choose File➪New Track from the main menu.
The New Track dialog box appears.
3. Use the drop-down menus of the dialog box to enter the number of
tracks you want (1), the type (Audio), and whether you want your
track in mono or stereo.
4. Using the new track’s Input selector, select the analog input that your
device is connected to in your Digidesign interface.
5. Using the new track’s Output selector, select the main outputs for your
session.
6. Record-enable this track by clicking the Record Enable button in
either the track’s channel strip (Mix window) or the track menu (Edit
window).
Now you should hear the sound coming out of your MIDI device as you
play your MIDI performance. 
Recording MIDI tracks
After you’ve record-enabled your MIDI track(s) (see the “Enabling recording
for MIDI tracks” section, earlier in this chapter), you can begin recording.
Follow these steps to record one or more MIDI tracks:
1. Click the Record Enable button located in either the track channel
strip (Mix window) or track menu (Edit window) to record-enable the
track(s).
2. Using the channel strips located in the Mix window, set the level of
the instruments in your session using the fader for each audio track
associated with your MIDI devices.
This is so you hear your music the way you want.

Playing Back Your Tracks
438
3. Enable the click track and the pre-roll if you’re using them.
4. Click the Return to Zero button in the Transport section of the
Transport window.
Doing so ensures that you start recording at the beginning of the
session.
5. Click the Record button in the Transport section of the Transport
window.
This step gets you ready to record; it doesn’t start the actual recording
process.
6. Click the Play button in the Transport section of the Transport
window.
Pro Tools starts recording.
7. When you’re done recording, click the Stop button in the Transport sec-
tion of the Transport window or press the Spacebar on your keyboard. 
The finished take appears in the MIDI Regions list as a new region.
Playing Back Your Tracks
After you’ve recorded a track, most likely you’ll want to listen to it to make
sure that it’s sounds the way you want it to sound. Pro Tools offers you many
ways to play a track back. In this section I guide you through a few of the
many options for playing back audio regions.
Playing recorded tracks
After you record a track and click the Stop button, you can immediately hear
the track by toggling off the Record Enable button on your MIDI tracks —
click it to make the red light disappear — and then clicking the Play button.
Leave the audio tracks associated with the MIDI devices in record-enable
mode so that you hear the playback of the MIDI device from the recorded
MIDI data instead of the recorded audio that was recorded to that track when
you recorded your performance. You can adjust the volume by moving the
fader in the channel strip for the audio track associated with your MIDI
device up and down.
Setting scrolling options
Pro Tools lets you decide how you want the Edit window to scroll when a
session is playing or recording. Just choose Operations➪Scroll Options from
the main menu and you’ll see the choices displayed in Figure 2-2. The follow-
ing list gives you the scoop on each option:

Book V
Chapter 2
Recording MIDI
Playing Back Your Tracks
439
✦No Auto-Scrolling: With you choose this option, the Edit window remains
where it is as the session plays. You can still move through the session
by manually sliding the scroll bar at the bottom of the window as the
session plays.
✦Scroll After Playback: This option takes you to where the cursor is
located once the session has been stopped. 
✦Page Scroll During Playback: Page scrolling during playback keeps the
cursor visible at all times as the session plays. The cursor moves from
left to right and the Edit window follows gamely along, just like Little
Bo Peep’s sheep.
This is the option I generally choose because I can easily keep track of
where I am in the session at all times.
Changing sounds
One of the great features of recording MIDI data is that you can change the
sound that the recorded performance plays. This lets you decide what sound
you use in your song after you’ve played the part. 
You can change the playback sound of a recorded MIDI track one of two ways:
✦Change the MIDI Device or Channel: Click the Output selector for the
MIDI track and scroll to a different MIDI channel or MIDI device.
✦Change the MIDI Patch: Click the Patch pop-up menu located in the
Track Controls section of the Edit window, as shown in Figure 2-3. After
the Patch window opens, as shown in Figure 2-4, choose a patch from
the list and then click Done to close the window.

Getting Rid of Unwanted Takes
440
Getting Rid of Unwanted Takes
If you have a take (recorded performance) that you don’t particularly like,
you can get rid of it several different ways. You can cancel the take as you’re
recording, you can undo the take after you’ve recorded, or you can clear the
audio region from the Audio Regions list. All of these options are detailed in
this section.
Canceling your performance
Canceling a performance is handy when you’re in the middle of recording
and you know that you’re not going to keep the take. To cancel a perform-
ance, simply press Command+period (on a Mac) or Ctrl+period (on a PC).
This will stop the session and clear the audio region created for this take
with two keystrokes.
Undoing your take
If you’ve already stopped recording and you know you don’t want to keep
your latest try, you can undo the take by choosing Edit➪Undo MIDI Recording
Figure 2-4:

window lets
you choose
a different

from the main menu (as shown in Figure 2-5), or by pressing Command+Z
(on a Mac) or Ctrl+Z (on a PC).
If you punched in more than once before you stopped the recording, only
the last punch is undone. The rest of the punches remain.
When you use Loop record mode, all the takes from the loop sequence are
undone. 
Clearing the file from the MIDI Regions list
If you decide, after hearing a few of your takes, that you want to get rid of
one or more of them, you can clear the offending takes from the MIDI Regions
list. Here’s how to get that done:
1. Highlight the region you want to get rid of in the MIDI Regions list by
clicking it.
The MIDI Regions list is located in the lower-right corner of the Edit
window, right below the Audio Regions list. If this section of the 
Edit window isn’t visible, click the double arrow at the bottom-right
corner of the Edit window to expand it.
Figure 2-5:

2. Click-hold the MIDI Regions list title (“MIDI”) at the top of the list to
access the MIDI Regions pop-up menu and then choose Clear Selected
(as shown in Figure 2-6), or press Shift+Command+B (on a Mac) or
Shift+Ctrl+B (on a PC).
To select more than one region to clear, press and hold the Shift key as
you click each region.
Overdubbing MIDI Performances
Once you have some MIDI performances recorded, you can add to or
change them easily. The time-honored name for this kind of recording is
overdubbing — but MIDI takes it to a whole new level. In Pro Tools, you can
overdub MIDI in several ways: You can punch in or out, loop, and either
merge (that is, add) new data or replace existing performance information.
This section gets you up to speed on these procedures.
Using MIDI Merge/Replace
When you overdub to a MIDI track, Pro Tools offers you the option to either
replace existing material or add new data to it. Which option you use depends
on the position of the MIDI Merge button located in the Transport window,
as shown in Figure 2-7.
✦When the button is engaged (MIDI Merge mode), new material is merged
with any existing MIDI data on the record-enabled track(s).
✦When the button is disengaged (MIDI Replace mode), new MIDI data
replaces any existing information on record-enabled track(s).

To engage MIDI Merge, do the following:
1. Open the MIDI controls section of the Transport window by choosing
Display➪Transport Window Shows➪MIDI Controls from the main menu.
The Transport window expands to include the MIDI controls section.
2. Click the MIDI Merge button. 
The button becomes highlighted.
Punching in and out
If you like some of your initial take and only want to record over part of it
you can set points at which to start and stop recording within the session.
This is called punching in and out. Punching in or out of a track involves first
setting a Start and End point. This can be done several ways; the next sec-
tions give you the details.
Using the Start/End fields in the Transport 
section of the Transport window
This method is pretty straightforward. To set your Start and End points using
the Transport section, just do the following: 
1. Choose Displays➪Transport Window➪Expanded View from the main
menu to get a nice, big view of the window.
2. Click in the Start field in the Transport section of the Transport
window, type in the beginning of the punch section you want, and
then press Enter.

This field will be displayed in the same format as the main counter. In
the case of Figure 2-8, the format is Bars and Beats.
3. Click in the End field, type in the end of the range, and then press
Enter.
This field is displayed as well in the format selected for the main counter
(as in Figure 2-8).
Selecting a section of a track’s playlist
For those of you out there who are especially handy with a mouse, this
method may have some appeal:
1. Make sure that the Link Edit and Timeline Selection option is chosen
under the Operations menu.
2. Using the Selector tool, click-drag a recorded range in your track, as
shown in Figure 2-9. 
The section becomes highlighted and the session Start and End points
are set to match the beginning and ending of this selection.

Dragging the Start and End point markers along the ruler bar
The Start and End markers are displayed along the Timeline in the Edit
window as up and down arrows — down for punch in and up for punch out.
The arrows are blue when no tracks are record-enabled and red when one or
more tracks are record-enabled. Setting Start and End points in the Timeline
consists of these steps:
1. Make sure that the Link Edit and Timeline Selections is chosen under
the Operations menu.
2. Select the Grid edit mode (click on the Grid mode selector in the upper
left of the Edit window) if you want the markers to snap to the grid,
otherwise use any other Edit mode.
3. Click-drag the Start and End Point arrows to where you want them, as
shown in Figure 2-10.
Performing the punch
After you have designated the Start and End points of your punch-in-and-out
range, you can record to that section by doing the following:
1. Set and enable a pre-roll.
Doing so enables you to hear the previously recorded track before the
punch-in happens. Here’s the quick drill. (See Book 3, Chapter 4 for
details.) 
a. Click the Pre-Roll field in the expanded version of the Transport
window and type in a pre-roll time. (Choose Display➪Transport
Window Shows➪Expanded if you need to expand the window.)
b. Click the Pre-Roll button in the expanded version of the Transport
window to enable the pre-roll function.
Figure 2-10:

2. Set and enable a post-roll. 
Doing so lets you hear how your punch fits in with your previously
recorded track. Here’s the quick drill. (See Book 3, Chapter 4 for details.)
a. Click the Post-Roll field in the expanded version of the Transport
window and type in a pre-roll time. (Choose Display➪Transport
Window Shows➪Expanded if you need to expand the window.)
b. Click the Post-Roll button in the expanded version of the Transport
window to enable the post-roll function.
3. Choose the nondestructive record mode by making sure that destruc-
tive, loop, and quick-punch modes are disabled in the Operations
menu.
4. Choose either MIDI Merge or MIDI Replace mode.
See the “Using MIDI Merge/Replace” section, earlier in the chapter, for
more on MIDI Merge/Replace.
5. Click the Record Enable button in either the track’s channel strip
(Mix window) or the track menu (Edit window).
The track is record-enabled.
6. Click the Record button in the Transport section of the Transport
window.
The Record button flashes red.
7. Click the Play button in the Transport section of the Transport
window when you’re ready to record.
The session starts at the pre-roll time, the Record button flashes red,
and you hear the previously recorded track until the pre-roll is over. The
monitoring then switches to the Input source and the Record button
stops flashing (but remains red). Once you hit the end of the record range,
the session either stops playing or (if you’ve enabled a post-roll) the
recording stops. If the recording stops to accommodate a post-roll, the
Record button starts flashing again. The monitoring then switches back
to the recorded region until the end of the post-roll period. When the
post-roll is done, the session stops playing.
Punching MIDI on-the-fly
With MIDI you can punch in and out of a track while the session plays. This
is called punching on-the-fly and is especially effective if you have a Digi 002,
002 Rack, or 001 — and a footswitch connected to the footswitch input on
your interface.

Book V
Chapter 2
Recording MIDI
Overdubbing MIDI Performances
447
To punch on-the-fly
1. Choose the nondestructive record mode my making sure that destruc-
tive, loop, and quick-punch modes are disabled in the Operations
menu.
2. Select either MIDI Merge or MIDI Replace mode.
See the “Using MIDI Merge/Replace” section, earlier in the chapter, for
more on MIDI Merge/Replace.
3. Disable the Wait for Note and Countoff options in the Transport
window.
4. Click the Record Enable button in either the track’s channel strip
(Mix window) or the track menu (Edit window).
The track is record-enabled.
5. Click the Play button in the Transport section of the Transport window. 
The session plays.
6. When you reach the point where you want to start recording in the
session, click the Record button or press the footswitch.
The punch begins. Play what you want to go in there.
7. When you reach the point that you want to stop recording, click the
Record button or press the footswitch again.
Recording stops but the session continues playing — with any luck,
seamlessly.
Loop recording
Loop recording lets you choose a section of the song to repeatedly record
over. This makes it easy to try a bunch of takes without having to manually
start and stop every time you go through the section. Loop recording can be
done a bunch of ways. I described two of ’em in the Audio Recording chapters
(Book 3, Chapters 3 and 4), but I prefer using MIDI Merge mode to loop-record
MIDI (makes sense, doesn’t it?).
To loop-record using MIDI Merge mode, do the following:
1. Choose the nondestructive record mode by making sure that destruc-
tive, loop, and quick-punch modes are disabled in the Operations
menu.
2. Enable MIDI Merge mode.
The button becomes highlighted.

Overdubbing MIDI Performances

3. Disable the Wait for Note and Countoff options in the Transport
section of the Transport window.
4. Enable the Link Edit and Timeline Selection option in the Operations
menu.
5. Choose the Selector tool in the Edit window.
6. Click-drag across the section of the track that you want to record over.
7. Click in the Pre-Roll field in the expanded Transport window and type
in a pre-roll time. Click the Pre-Roll button in the Transport window
to enable the pre-roll function. (Choose Display➪Transport Window
Shows➪Expanded if you need to expand the window.)
If you don’t want to hear a section of the session before the loop begins
skip this step.
8. Click the Record Enable button located in either the track channel
strip (Mix window) or track menu (Edit window) to record enable the
track.
9. Select Loop Record mode. You’ve got a three ways to make this 
selection:
• Check the Loop Record option under the Operations menu.
• Press Option+L (on a Mac) or Alt+L (on a PC).
• Ctrl+click (on a Mac) or right-click (on a PC) the Record button in the
Transport window until the Loop Record icon shows up.
10. Click Play in the Transport section of the Transport window to start
recording.
While the recording is under way, the new MIDI data appears in the track
as a new region (and in the MIDI Regions list) — but doesn’t replace the
previously recorded material. 
11. Click Stop when you’re finished recording.
If you designated a pre-roll, it only happens before the first time through the
loop. After that, the loop goes from Start point to End point, back to the Start
point, and so on, as many times as needed.
If you loop-record using the Loop Record mode without engaging MIDI Merge,
then each time you go through the loop, you create a new region in the MIDI
Regions list. This is in contrast to loop-recording audio tracks, where all the
takes are stored in one audio file.

Recording System-Exclusive Data
449
Recording System-Exclusive Data
In Pro Tools, you can record system-exclusive data — data that is unique to
your MIDI device — to a MIDI track. That means you can record changes
made to your patches (prepared sounds selected from a sound bank), to
your configuration, and any real-time changes in the system. For example,
you can record patch changes so your MIDI device changes its sound as the
session plays (from, say, a Chainsaw patch to a Bagpipe patch). You can also
store the parameter settings for a device and have Pro Tools automatically
restore those settings to your device before your session plays.
To record system-exclusive data to a MIDI track in Pro Tools, do the following:
1. Connect the MIDI Out of your device to one of the MIDI In ports con-
figured in Pro Tools.
2. Choose File➪New Track from the main menu.
The New Track dialog box appears.
3. Use the drop-down menus of the dialog box to enter the number of
tracks you want (1), the type (MIDI), and whether you want your track
in mono or stereo.
4. Use the new track’s Input selector, set the input of the track to the
MIDI In port that’s connected to your device.
5. Choose the non-destructive record mode by making sure that destruc-
tive, loop, and quick-punch modes are disabled in the Operations
menu.
6. Choose MIDI➪Input Filter from the main menu.
The MIDI Input Filter dialog box appears.
7. Enable system-exclusive recording by checking the System Exclusive
check box in the MIDI Input Filter dialog box. 
8. Enable the Wait for Note function in the Transport. 
9. Click the Return to Zero button in the Transport window to return to
the beginning of the session.
10. Click the Record Enable button in either the track’s channel strip (Mix
window) or the track menu (Edit window).
The track is record-enabled.

The Record, Play, and Wait for Note buttons flash.
12. Initiate the MIDI dump on your MIDI Device. (Check your MIDI device’s
manual to figure how this is done; it’s different for every device.)
The transfer begins.
13. Click Stop when the transfer is finished.
To send system-exclusive data back to your device, do the following:
1. Make sure that the MIDI Out port of your MIDI interface is connected
to the MIDI In port of your device.
2. Using the Output selector of the MIDI track that has the system-
exclusive data, set the output to the MIDI port that’s connected to
your device.
3. Set your device to receive system-exclusive data. (You may need to
check your owner’s manual for details on how to do this.)
4. Click the Return to Zero button in the Transport section of the
Transport window to return the session to the beginning.
5. Click Play in the Transport window.
The session plays and the system-exclusive data is received.
6. Click Stop when the transfer is complete.

lthough MIDI editing in Pro Tools isn’t as elaborate as what you find in
programs like Logic or Sonar, it’s plenty powerful enough to tweak your
MIDI data quite a bit. If your overall MIDI needs are moderate, the relatively
simple Pro Tools MIDI features can do what you need with minimum fuss.
In this chapter, you explore the MIDI-editing functions available to you in
Pro Tools. You examine the many uses of the Pencil tool, discover ways to
edit MIDI notes, controller data, and system-exclusive messages. 
Working with MIDI Tracks
Working with MIDI tracks is almost the same as working with audio tracks.
(The latter are covered in great detail in Book 4, Chapters 1 and 2.) This sec-
tion explains track views, selecting MIDI data, understanding regions, and
setting default program changes.
Taking a look at track views
You can adjust the track view for MIDI tracks by clicking the Track View selec-
tor in the Track Controls section of the Edit window, as shown in Figure 3-1.
The track views for MIDI tracks include the following options: 
✦Blocks: In Blocks view, regions are displayed as blocks, each showing
only the region name. This view takes up the least amount of processing
power to show and redraw — that makes it the best option after all your
editing is done and you’re ready to start mixing.
✦Regions: Regions view shows the regions in the track, also displaying
notes in the track in the piano-roll fashion you see in Figure 3-2. The
notes can’t be edited but the regions can be. This view is useful when
you want to move or edit the regions in your track.

Working with MIDI Tracks
452
When you edit in the Regions view on a MIDI track, you edit continuous
controller events (volume, pitch bend, aftertouch) along with the region
because such events are connected to the region and not to the track’s
playlist.
✦Notes: The Notes view displays the location, pitch, and duration of the
notes in the track in piano-roll format (as in Figure 3-3). You can edit or
insert MIDI notes in this view.
MIDI notes are shown as small rectangles — the horizontal range repre-
sents the location and duration of the note; the vertical placement shows
the note’s pitch.
Along the left side of the track’s playlist is a representation of a keyboard
with up and down arrows, which allow you to scroll through the octaves
of the notes. This is necessary because not all the possible MIDI notes
can be displayed in the track’s playlist at one time. A single line at the
top or bottom of the track display designates any notes that can’t be dis-
played (because they’re above or below the octave being displayed).
You can also scroll through the octaves in the playlist by using the
Grabber tool and dragging the piano-roll display up and down.
✦Velocity: This view displays — and allows you to edit — velocity (note
volume) settings for each note in the track. (You can still see the piano-
roll data in the background.)

✦Volume: The Volume view shows automation volume curves with break-
points — markers that show shifts in the automation level — displayed
as dots along the line. Note data, in piano-roll format, is shown in the
background. In this view, you can edit the volume data but not the
underlying notes.
✦Pan: This view displays — and lets you adjust — panning automation
data (far left at the top and far right at the bottom) with the piano-roll
display in the background.
✦Mute: This view shows mute automation settings for the track — and
allows you to mute or unmute the track. Note data, in piano-roll format,
is shown in the background.
✦Pitch Bend: The Pitch Bend view shows any pitch bend data in the track
as a line graph with editable breakpoints. The piano-roll data is shown in
the background but can’t be edited.
✦After Touch: This view shows aftertouch data — the velocity of the note
after the initial touch of the keyboard — as a line graph with editable
breakpoints. The piano-roll data is shown in the background to help you
know where you are in the session.
✦Program Change: This view displays program-change information for the
track with the piano-roll data in the background (uneditable, of course).
Use this view to add or edit program-change events. 
✦Sysex: This view shows system-exclusive data — messages exclusive to
the MIDI device — for the track. 
✦Controller: This view shows continuous controller data, such as modu-
lation wheel, breath controller, foot control, and sustain with the piano-
roll data in the background. Use this view to add or edit continuous
controller data for your track.
You can toggle between the two most-used MIDI track views: Regions and
Notes. Do this by pressing Start/Windows (on a PC) or Ctrl (on a Mac) while
you press the minus key on the alpha section (the main section) of the key-
board or simply press the minus key (alpha section) after having engaged
the Command Keyboard Focus button. (See Book 2, Chapter 4, for more 
on the Command Keyboard Focus feature.)

Selecting track material
You can select track material the same way you select material from audio
tracks — well, okay, with a few variations. This section tells you about those
variations; Book 4, Chapter 2 covers the selection stuff about audio tracks
that’s perfectly applicable to MIDI tracks. (You may want to skim through
Book 4, Chapter 2 to refresh your memory about selection basics.) 
MIDI notes are selected from the Notes view; regions are selected from the
Regions view.
Selecting notes with the Pencil tool
You select notes with the Pencil tool by clicking the notes. (No big deal, right?)
To select more than one note, press the Shift key as you click each of the
notes. Selected notes become highlighted.
Using the Selector tool
When you use the Selector tool to select notes, certain conditions apply.
They’re pretty straightforward:
✦Before a note can be included in a selection, its Start point must be in
the selection range. In Figure 3-4, for example, the note whose Start
point begins before the selection range is not selected. (You can tell it’s
not selected because it’s not highlighted.)
✦Notes with their End points outside the selection range are still selected.
✦When you select notes using the Selector tool, you also select (automati-
cally) all the underlying automation and controller data pertaining to
the notes.

Grabbing with the Grabber tool
When you select a series of notes with the Grabber tool, all notes partially or
fully contained in the Grabber selection are selected, as shown in Figure 3-5.
Notes selected with the Grabber tool don’t include automation or controller
data.
Selecting notes from the mini keyboard
You can select all the notes in a track that have the same pitch by clicking
the represented MIDI note in the minikeyboard located along the left side of
the track’s playlist display, as shown in Figure 3-6.
Recognizing regions
The procedures for working with MIDI regions are the same as those for audio
regions. Book 4, Chapter 1 describes how to select and view regions in a
track’s playlist, as well as how to work with regions in the Audio Regions list.
The procedures for working with the MIDI Regions list are the same as those
for working with the Audio Regions list, so if you check out Book 4, Chapter 1,
you’re all set.

Dealing with Note Chasing
456
Setting MIDI patches on tracks
You can change the default program (sound patch) in use with your MIDI
tracks so your MIDI device automatically resets to the program you want for
your track. Here’s how to make it happen:
1. Click the Program button in the Track Controls section of the Edit
window, as shown in Figure 3-7. 
The Patch Select dialog box opens.
2. Click the patch number or name that you want from the list in the
main section of the dialog box. It becomes highlighted.
Depending on your MIDI device, you may need to specify a bank along
with the patch number. The bank number is entered in one of the
Controller fields at the top of the dialog box. Check the specification 
for your device to see what to enter in this field.
3. Click Done. 
The Patch Select dialog box closes and the patch number/name is dis-
played on the Program button of the Track Controls section.
You can have Pro Tools automatically scroll through the patches in your
MIDI sound module by checking the Incremental Patch option in the Patch
Select dialog box and entering a value for the number of seconds that each
patch sounds as your session plays.
Dealing with Note Chasing
Note chasing makes sure that when you start your session in the middle of a
long MIDI note, the note is played. This is useful when you want to start and
stop the session from anywhere and still be able to hear the notes that are
recorded.
Figure 3-7:
The Program
button is

Chapter 3
Editing MIDI Data
Editing MIDI in the Edit Window
457
The Note Chasing feature is turned on by default, but you may want to turn
it off on any tracks that you have playing loops (doing so ensures that the
loop doesn’t get out of synch when you start and stop the session in the
middle of its sequence).
To turn on and off Note Chasing, do the following:
1. Click the track’s Playlist selector, located in the Track Controls section
of the Edit window. (The selector is the arrow to the right of the
name of the track.)
The Track Playlist pop-up menu opens with an option for engaging note
chasing in the track.
2. Choose Note Chasing from the Track Playlist menu.
You uncheck to turn the Note Chasing feature off and check to turn it on.
Editing MIDI in the Edit Window
As with audio, you do most of your MIDI editing from the Edit window. The
process, again, is very similar to editing audio (described in Book 4,
Chapters 1, 2, and 3). This section offers some tips and tricks tailored to
inserting, deleting, and editing MIDI data — but for the most part you’re
going to hear about the amazing Pencil tool, Smart tool, and Grabber tool.
If your MIDI region exists in only one location (that is, it’s not shared with
other tracks or sessions), then any changes you make to the data in that
region change it permanently. If you want to ensure that you don’t lose
important data while editing (or want to be able to return to the original),
make a copy of the playlist and work from there. (I explain playlists in detail
in Book 4, Chapter 1.)
Perusing the Pencil tools
Pro Tools offers five Pencil tools — Free Hand, Line, Triangle, Square, and
Random — that let you create and edit MIDI data easily with your mouse.
You select these tools by clicking and holding the Pencil Tool icon and then
choosing from the pop-up menu that appears, as shown in Figure 3-8. Each of
these tools can be used to add notes and draw velocity and controller data,
but each one works a little differently, as the following list makes clear: 
✦Free Hand
When you insert notes, here’s what happens:
You can place them anywhere you want and drag your mouse to
specify the duration you want the note to be.

Editing MIDI in the Edit Window
458
If you simply click with the Free Hand Pencil tool to insert a note, the
note duration is equal to the grid value for your session. (Grid values
are boundaries you can set for your session and are set in the Grid
Value drop-down menu, located just below the Pencil Tool button in
the Edit window.)
Note velocity is determined by the setting you have in the MIDI tab
of the Preferences dialog box. (Choose Setups➪Preferences to access
the Preferences dialog box.)
When you draw velocity or continuous controller data, here’s what
happens:
• You can draw any shape you want with your mouse.
• The resolution of the lines is determined by the settings you’ve chosen
for controller data in the MIDI tab of the Preferences dialog box.
(Choose Setups➪Preferences to access the Preferences dialog box.)
✦Line
When you insert notes, here’s what you get:
You can place as many notes as you want as a single pitch.
The note duration is equal to the current grid value in your session.
The note velocity is determined by the setting you have in the MIDI
tab of the Preferences dialog box. 
When you draw velocity or continuous controller data, these conditions
apply:
• The line is straight from the initial mouse click through the drag and
release. 
• The resolution of the lines is determined by the settings you have
chosen for controller data in the MIDI tab of the Preferences 
dialog box.

459
✦Triangle
When you insert notes, three conditions apply:
You can place as many notes as you want as a single pitch.
The note duration is equal to the current grid value in your session.
The note velocity oscillates between the setting you have for Note
On Velocity in the MIDI tab of the Preferences dialog box and 127
(maximum level).
When you draw velocity or continuous controller data, here’s what 
you see:
The line is a triangular pattern, which changes direction according to
the current grid value in your session. 
The resolution of the lines is determined by the settings for controller
data you have chosen in the MIDI tab of the Preferences dialog box.
✦Square
When you insert notes, here’s the skinny:
You can place as many notes as you want as a single pitch.
The note duration is equal to the current grid value in your session.
The note velocity alternates between the setting you have for Note
On Velocity in the MIDI tab of the Preferences dialog box and 127
(the maximum level).
When you draw velocity or continuous controller data, it works this way:
The line is a square pattern, which repeats according to the current
grid value in your session. 
The resolution of the lines is determined by the settings you have
chosen for controller data in the MIDI tab of the Preferences dialog box.
✦Random
When you insert notes, here’s what you get:
You can place as many notes as you want as a single pitch.
The note duration is equal to the current grid value in your session.
The note velocity changes randomly between the setting you have
for Note On Velocity in the MIDI tab of the Preferences dialog box
and 127 (maximum level).
When you draw velocity or continuous controller data, the line is a
random pattern, which changes value according to the current grid
value in your session. 

Editing MIDI in the Edit Window
460
Custom note duration
When you insert a note using one of Pencil tools and you want a different
value than the grid setting in your session you can choose the Custom 
Note Duration option located at the bottom of the Pencil Tool pop-up menu.
Enabling this option adds the Notes button you see here in the margin beneath
the Pencil Tool icon on the Edit Window toolbar.
The Custom Note Duration option lets you specify a note duration other
than your current grid setting.
To choose a custom note duration when you’re inserting a MIDI note, do the
following:
1. Click-hold on the Pencil button in the Edit window toolbar.
The Pencil Tool pop-up menu appears.
2. Select the Custom Note Duration option from the Pencil Tool pop-up
menu.
The Notes button appears beneath the Pencil button in the Edit Window
toolbar.
3. Select the Pencil tool you want to use from the pop-up menu.
4. Using the Notes button beneath the Pencil Tool button, choose a note
duration.
5. Using the Pencil tool you selected in Step 3, insert the note in your
track.
Adding MIDI events
You can add MIDI notes or controller data (collectively called MIDI events)
to a MIDI track by using the Pencil tool (see the previous section for more
about the Pencil tools).
Inserting notes
To use the Pencil tool to insert a note, do the following:
1. Using the Track View pop-up menu in the Track Controls section of
the Edit Window, set the track view to Notes.
2. Click-and-hold the Pencil button and then select the Pencil tool you
want to use from the Pencil Tool pop-up menu that appears.
3. Locate the place you want to add your MIDI note in the track’s
playlist area.
4. Using the Pencil tool you selected in Step 2, click in the playlist to
insert a note with a duration equal to the grid value.

Book V
Chapter 3
Editing MIDI Data
Editing MIDI in the Edit Window
461
When you use the Free Hand tool, you can make the note to whatever duration
you want. Do so by clicking the Start point of the note in the track’s playlist,
dragging to the End point you want, and then releasing the mouse button.
If you want to hear the MIDI note as you insert it, first make sure that you
have the Play MIDI Notes When Editing preference chosen in the MIDI tab 
of the Preferences dialog box. (Choose Setups➪Preferences to access the
dialog box.)
If you have the Grid mode enabled as your editing mode, the inserted note is
snapped to the nearest grid boundary. To disable this function, press Ctrl
(on a PC) or Command (on a Mac) as you insert the note. (Book 4, Chapter 1
has more on editing modes.)
Drawing velocity or continuous controller data
To draw velocity or continuous controller data in a track’s playlist, do the
following:
1. Using the Track View pop-up menu in the Track Controls section of
the Edit Window, set the track to Velocity or Controller view.
2. Click and hold the Pencil button and then select the Pencil tool you
want to use from the menu that appears.
3. Locate the place where you want to enter your MIDI data in the track’s
playlist.
4. Using the Pencil tool you selected in Step 2, click and drag in the
track’s playlist to sketch in the velocity or the controller level you
want to draw. 
5. Release the mouse button when you reach the end point of your edit.
Inserting program changes
To insert MIDI program changes, do the following:
1. Using the Track View pop-up menu, set the track to Program 
Change view.
2. Click and hold the Pencil button and then select the Pencil tool you
want to use from the menu that appears.
3. Click in the track’s playlist at the location you want the change to
occur.
The Patch Select dialog box opens.
4. Click the patch number or name in the main section of the dialog box
to select it.

5. Click Done.
The program change is inserted, as shown in Figure 3-9.
Deleting MIDI data
You can delete MIDI notes and other data several ways. This section details
the process.
Deleting a MIDI note
To delete a MIDI note, do the following:
1. Using the Track View pop-up menu, set the track view to Notes.
2. Using either the Grabber tool or the Selector tool, select the note in
the playlist you want to delete. 
3. Press Delete on your keyboard or choose Edit➪Clear from the main
menu.
Instead of Steps 2 and 3 just given, start out with the Pencil tool. Then press
Alt (on a PC) or Option (on a Mac) to change the pencil into an eraser, and
click the note to delete it.
If you use the Selector to select the note, all automation and controller data
is deleted along with the note.

1. Using the Track View pop-up menu, set the track view to Program
Change.
2. Select the program change you want to delete:
Using the Grabber tool, either click the event or drag across it to select
it. (If you drag, you can include other MIDI events in your selection to
delete them as well.)
Using the Pencil tool, press Alt (on a PC) or Option (on a Mac) while
you click the event. (You won’t need to perform Step 3 using this pro-
cedure, because the event is automatically deleted.)
3. Press Delete on your keyboard or choose Edit➪Clear from the 
main menu.
The event is deleted.
Changing MIDI events
In the Edit window, you can edit MIDI notes in a variety of ways including
changing pitch, duration, velocity, and time location.
When you edit or move notes, you can make a copy of the note to move by
pressing Option (Mac) or Ctrl (PC) as you drag the note.
Changing a note’s pitch
To change a note’s pitch, do the following:
1. Using the Track View pop-up menu, set your track to Notes view.
2. Select the Pencil or Grabber tool.
3. Press Shift to keep the note’s start point from changing as you move it.
4. Click the note and drag it up (higher pitch) or down (lower pitch) in
the playlist. 
5. Release the mouse button when the note is where you want it.
Changing a note’s duration
To change a note’s duration — its Start or End points — do the following:
1. Using the Track View pop-up menu, set your track to Notes view.
2. Select the Pencil tool.
3. Using the Pencil tool, click on the note you want to change. 
Press Shift as you click to select more than one note.

Editing MIDI in the Edit Window
464
4. Click the Start or End point of the note and drag it left or right.
If your edit mode is set to Grid, the note is moved along the grid bound-
ary. If you’re using the Spot edit mode, the Spot dialog box appears; there
you can type in a location for the note and then click Done.
5. Release the mouse button when the note is where you want it.
Changing a note’s velocity
In the MIDI world, velocity means volume. To change a note’s velocity, do the
following:
1. Using the Track View pop-up menu, set your track to Velocity view.
2. Select the Grabber tool.
3. Click the diamond-shaped icon at the top of the velocity stalk — the
vertical line with a diamond at the top representing the velocity
level — in the track’s playlist and drag it up or down. 
4. Release the mouse button when the velocity is where you want it.
You can also use one of the Pencil tools to draw various velocity shapes.
This is done by selecting the desired Pencil tool and drawing a line in the
track’s playlist where you want the velocities to be. (See “Perusing the Pencil
tools” section, earlier in this chapter, for more on drawing velocity settings.)
You can scale the velocities of several notes by using the Selector to select
the notes and the Trimmer to drag them up or down as a unit. This lets you
keep the relationship between the velocities the same as you change the
overall levels.
Changing time locations
Time locations define where the Start points of your notes are placed within
your session. To change a note’s time location, do the following:
1. Using the Track View pop-up menu, set your track to Notes view.
2. Select the Pencil or Grabber tool.
3. Press Shift to keep the note’s pitch from changing as you move it.
4. Click the note and drag it left or right. 
If your edit mode is set to Grid, the note is moved along the grid bound-
ary. If you’re using Spot edit mode, the Spot dialog box appears; there
you can type in a location for the note and then click Done.
5. Release the mouse button when the note is where you want it.

Moving notes freely
To move a note freely in the track, do the following:
1. Using the Track View pop-up menu, set your track to Notes view.
2. Select the Pencil or Grabber tool.
3. Click the note and drag it left or right, up or down. 
4. Release the mouse button when the note is where you want it.
Editing note attributes
To edit a note by changing note attributes as displayed in the MIDI Event
List, do the following:
1. Using the Track View pop-up menu, set your track to Notes view.
2. Click the note using the Pencil or Grabber tool. 
The note’s attributes show up in the MIDI Event List window with a blue
highlight (as shown in Figure 3-10).
3. Click in the Attribute field you want to change in the box. 
Your options include:
• Start: This field indicates the Start point of the selected note. This is
displayed in the main time scale setting for the session.
• End: This field controls the End point of the note, which is displayed
in the main time scale format. If this field isn’t visible, click the
Options button at the top of the MIDI Event List dialog box and
choose Show Note End Time from the menu that appears.
Figure 3-10:

• Length/Info: This field displays the duration of the note (shown in
the session’s main time scale). Changing the Start or End times also
changes this value. Changing this field alters the End point but leaves
the Start point untouched. MIDI events without length data, such as
program changes or controller events, show data associated with
that data, such as the program number or controller event type. If
this field isn’t visible, click the Options button at the top of the MIDI
Event List dialog box and choose Show Note Length from the menu
that appears.
• Pitch: This field displays the pitch of the note.
• Attack Velocity: This field shows the velocity of the start of the note
as a MIDI value between 0 and 127.
• Release Velocity. This field displays the release velocity of the note
as a MIDI value between 0 and 127.
4. Enter in the new value in the field corresponding to the attribute you
want to change.
5. Click Return (on a Mac) or Enter (on a PC).
The note changes to match the new attributes.
If you want to change more than one field, press the Slash key to move
between fields.
Editing program data
Since MIDI contains no sound in itself, you can create program change events
to change the sound patches of your MIDI sound modules throughout the
session. This can keep your computer processing resources optimized and
keep you from using more tracks than absolutely necessary for your session,
which is a good thing since Pro Tools allows you to have no more than 32
active tracks playing in a session.
Changing program patches
Program patches are the sounds available in your MIDI device. To change
program patches:
1. Using the Track View pop-up menu, set the track to Program 
Change view.
2. Using the Grabber tool, double-click the program change event you
want to change.
The Patch Select dialog box appears.

Book V
Chapter 3
Editing MIDI Data
Editing MIDI in the Edit Window
467
3. In the Patch Select dialog box, select the new patch name/number. 
(If the patch resides on a different bank as the current patch, select
the new bank as well.)
4. Click Done. 
The Patch Select dialog box closes and the new program is sounded
when you play your session.
Moving program change markers
Program change markers are helpful little tools because they tell Pro Tools
when to change the sound of your MIDI device as your session plays. To move
a program change marker:
1. Using the Track View pop-up menu, set the track to Program 
Change view.
2. Select the Grabber or Pencil tool.
3. Click-drag the Program Change Marker left or right. 
If you have Grid mode enabled, the program change event moves to the
closest grid boundary. If you have Spot mode selected, the Spot dialog
box opens; there you can enter a new location for the marker and then
click Done.
Changing continuous controller data
When you deal with continuous controller data, you are dealing with Volume,
Pan, Pitch Bend, After Touch, and MIDI controllers. All this data is represented
as a line graph punctuated by a series of breakpoints. You have a choice
when you want to make changes: you can edit the line itself using the Pencil
tool or you can edit the breakpoints using the Grabber, Pencil, or Smart tool. 
Editing lines with the Pencil tool
To edit the line graph with a Pencil tool, do the following:
1. Using the Track View pop-up menu, select the track view that corre-
sponds to the parameter you want to edit (Volume, Pan, Pitch Bend,
After Touch, MIDI Controller).
2. Click and hold the Pencil button, and then select the Pencil tool you
want to use from the menu that appears.
3. Click in the playlist where you want to start drawing and drag your
mouse to draw the new values. 

Editing MIDI in the Edit Window
468
The line is drawn and breakpoints are inserted according to the resolution
you’ve set for the Pencil Tool Resolution When Drawing Controller Data
option in the MIDI tab of the Preferences dialog box. (Choose Setups➪
Preferences from the main men to access the Preferences dialog box.)
4. Release the mouse button when you reach the end of your edit.
Editing breakpoints
If you’re not adept at drawing lines, you might want to work with breakpoints
instead. Here’s how: 
1. Using the Track View pop-up menu, select the track view that corre-
sponds to the parameter you want to edit (Volume, Pan, Pitch Bend,
After Touch, MIDI Controller).
2. Select the Grabber tool.
3. Click and drag the breakpoint.
4. Release the mouse button.
Scaling breakpoints
When you scale breakpoints, you move a group of breakpoints while retaining
the relationship between them. You can use the Trimmer tool to scale break-
points, as in the following Steps list:
1. Using the Track View pop-up menu, select the track view that corre-
sponds to the parameter you want to edit (Volume, Pan, Pitch Bend,
After Touch, MIDI Controller).
2. Select the Selector tool.
3. Click-drag across the breakpoints you want to scale with the mouse. 
The selection becomes highlighted.
4. Select the Trimmer tool.
5. Click and drag the breakpoints up or down. 
The breakpoints move as a unit but they don’t all move the same amount.
They move differently to keep the relationship between the breakpoints
intact.
6. Release your mouse button.
There are other ways to edit continuous controller data in Pro Tools. Check

Using the Smart tool
The Smart tool puts a new spin on three older tools — the Trimmer tool,
Selector tool, and Grabber tool. Basically, the Smart tool changes the way it
works depending on what you try to do. This section details how this tool
behaves when you work with MIDI data.
To use the Smart tool, press the button located under the Selector tool in the
Edit window, as shown in Figure 3-11.
Check out Book 4, Chapter 4 for more details about the Smart tool.
Using the Smart tool in Notes view
When you use the Smart tool with your Track view set to Notes, the tool
behaves the following way:
✦Placing the cursor so that it doesn’t touch any notes or pressing
Command (on a Mac) or Ctrl (on a PC) enables the Selector face of the
Smart tool. You can then click and drag to make a selection.
✦Positioning the cursor near the middle of a note enables the Grabber
face of the Smart tool.
✦Placing the cursor over the Start or End point of a note enables the
Trimmer face of the Smart tool.
✦To turn the Smart tool into an eraser, make sure the cursor isn’t touch-
ing any notes (the Selector appears) and then press Start/Windows+Alt
(on a PC) or Ctrl+Option (on a Mac).
Using the Smart tool in an Automation or in Controller views
When you use the Smart tool in an Automation view (Volume, Mute, or Pan)
or in Controller view, the tool acts the following ways: 
Click here to enable the Smart tool.

✦Trimmer: To enable the Trimmer tool, position your cursor in the top
25% of the region. The Trimmer icon appears. You can move your cursor
up and down to change the value or to create breakpoints. If you want
finer control of the Trimmer tool while you work, press Ctrl (on a PC) or
Command (on a Mac) after you begin trimming.
✦Selector: To enable the Selector tool, position your cursor in the lower
75 percent of the region. You can then drag your selection.
✦Grabber: To enable the Grabber tool, press Ctrl (on a PC) or Command
(on a Mac). You can do several things using the Grabber tool with a
track set to an automation view:
Edit Existing Breakpoints: Position the cursor near one of these
points and the Grabber appears. You can increase the resolution 
of your movements to fine-control by pressing Ctrl (on a PC) or
Command (on a Mac) after you start moving the breakpoint.
Constrain the Grabber Vertically: To keep the Grabber from moving
right or left, press Shift or — if you’ve set the tool to fine control —
press Ctrl+Shift (on a PC) or Command+Shift (on a Mac).
Exploring MIDI Events
The MIDI Event List consists of all the MIDI data in your track. This list dis-
plays the location, pitch, velocity, and duration of every note as well as all
other parameters for the track. The MIDI Event List window lets you edit all
your track’s MIDI data in one place — it’s one extremely helpful tool in the
Pro Tools toolbox. This section explains the ways to best use this window to
edit your track.
Exploring the MIDI Event List window
The MIDI Event List window, shown in Figure 3-12, displays MIDI data for a
selected track. You can open the window in several different ways:
✦Choose Windows➪Show MIDI Event List from the main menu. 
✦Press Start/Windows (on a PC) or Ctrl (on a Mac) while you double-click
the MIDI track name in the Edit or Mix window.
✦Press Alt+equal (=) on a PC or Option+Equal (=) on a Mac. Pressing this
combination again toggles you back to the Edit window.
If you have a selection made within a MIDI track and you open the MIDI
Event List window, the selected note or range of notes is highlighted.
The cursor location is marked with an arrow in the MIDI Event List.

Examining MIDI Event menus
The MIDI Event List contains three menus at the top of the window. These
are the Track Selector menu, the Options menu, and the Insert menu. The
following list gives you the details on the various menu options:
✦Track Selector: This menu shows the track that’s currently listed in the
window and lets you choose a different track to display.
✦Options menu: This menu consists of the following options, shown in
Figure 3-13:
• Show Sub Counter: This option displays the event times in the sub-
counter value. (Book 2, Chapter 4 has more on how to use counters.)
• Go to: Choosing this option opens a dialog box where you enter the
location in the session you want to go to.

• Scroll During Edit Selection: This option automatically scrolls the
MIDI Event List as you move your edit point in the Edit window.
• Show Note Length: Checking this option displays the length of the
MIDI notes in the MIDI Event List.
• Show Note End Time: This option lets you display the end time of
the MIDI notes in the Event List instead of the note length (sorry, you
can’t have both).
• Insert At Edit Location: This option lets you designate that any
inserted event is placed at the Edit Start or Insertion point.
• Insert At Playback Location: This option lets you insert notes on-
the-fly as the session plays back.
• Insert At Playback Location With Grid: This option snaps any
inserted notes placed on-the-fly (see the previous bullet) to the near-
est grid boundary.
• View Filter: This option opens the MIDI Event List View Filter dialog
box, as shown in Figure 3-14. You use this dialog box to specify which
fields appear in the MIDI Event List dialog box. This, in turn, effects
which events are edited using Cut, Copy, and Paste — any fields that are
not displayed in the MIDI Event List aren’t affected by Cut, Copy, and
Paste commands. (For more about this window, see Book 5, Chapter 4.)
✦Insert menu: The Insert menu consists of the types of events you can
insert into the track using the MIDI Event List. This menu is covered in
greater detail in the “Inserting MIDI events” section, later in this chapter.

Although it isn’t actually a menu option, the number of Events in your current
track is displayed to the right of the three menus listed in this section.
Eyeing the rest of the MIDI Event List
Below the MIDI Event menus (see previous section) lies the whole range of
possible MIDI events for the track. (Refer to Figure 3-12.) These events are
listed in order from the beginning of the session to the end and are listed in
three columns. (The “Inserting MIDI events” section, later in this chapter,
explores these columns further.)
✦Start: This column displays the location of the event’s Start point in
either the main or sub counter time format, depending on whether you
have the Show Sub Counter option checked in the Options menu. (See
the “Examining MIDI Event menus” section, earlier in this chapter.)
If more than one event is located at the same place in the session (as with
chords, for example) the location for all but the first event is dimmed.
This makes it easier to see these multiple events.
To the left of the Start point is an arrow indicating the location of the
cursor in the session.
✦Event: This column shows the event type — indicated by the icon at
the left of the column — as well as its associated values. In the case of
notes, you see the note letter and octave as well as its attack and release
velocities.
✦Length/info: This column shows the length or End point of the MIDI notes,
depending on whether you have the Show Note Length or Show Note End
Time option selected under the Options menu. (See previous section.)
Getting around the MIDI Event List
There are several ways to move quickly around the MIDI Event List. They
include these:
✦Double-clicking the event in the list highlights your selection.
✦Pressing Tab or the Down arrow moves you to the next event.
✦Pressing Ctrl+Tab (on a PC) or Option+Tab (on a Mac) or pressing the
Up arrow moves you to the previous event.
✦Using the left or right arrows moves you laterally in the event list.
✦Pressing Shift while you double-click or pressing Tab/arrow adds events
to your selection.
✦Choosing Go To from the Options pop-up menu takes you to a specific
location in the event list.
✦Selecting the Scroll to Edit Selection option under the Options menu lets
you go automatically to the beginning of the edit selection.

Editing in the MIDI Event List
Editing in the MIDI Event list isn’t for everyone. Many people prefer the visual
format offered by the Edit window, but editing in the MIDI Event List window
can be faster and more accurate. This section describes the process of insert-
ing, deleting, and editing MIDI data in the MIDI Events List.
Inserting MIDI events
Using the Insert menu, shown in Figure 3-15, you can insert the following MIDI
events into your track:
✦Note: Selecting Note lets you enter the start time, pitch, attack velocity,
release velocity, and either the end time or duration of the notes. 
✦Pitch Bend: When you enter pitch bend information in the Event entry
window, you include start time and the bend amount. Positive values
raise the pitch while negative numbers lower it.
✦Volume: The Volume Event entry window lets you enter the start time,
controller number (it’s set to 7 for volume) and the volume level (0-17).
The controller name appears in the far right column. 
✦Pan: The Pan Event entry window contains fields for start time, controller
number (in this case it’s set to 10), and pan value (negative numbers pan
left of center while positive numbers pan right of center). The controller
name (pan) appears in the far right column.
✦Mono Aftertouch: The Mono Aftertouch Event entry window offers fields
for the start time and the aftertouch level (0 and 127). Aftertouch is the
velocity of the note after the initial attack.
✦Poly Aftertouch: The Poly (polyphonic) Aftertouch Event entry window
offers fields for the start time, note name, and the aftertouch level
(0 and 127).
✦Program Change: The Program Change Event entry window has fields for
the start time, program number, controller 0 value, and controller 32
value. The program name appears when you choose the program number.
✦Controller: This option lets you designate which of the many controller
events you want to enter. The event’s entry window for this option
includes the start time, controller number, and the controller value. The
controller number you choose determines the controller parameter you
change and this parameter name shows up in the farthest column to
the right.
✦Another (note): This option enters the data from the previous inserted
event into fields.

MIDI Operations
In This Chapter
 Quantizing MIDI notes 
 Flattening and restoring MIDI performances

P
ro Tools offers you a handful of MIDI operations (located under the
MIDI section of the main menu) where you can transform a mediocre
track into a stunning performance (well, almost, depending on how well you
use these operations). These operations allow you to make changes to the
MIDI performance data on a track. 
In this chapter, you get a chance to dig into some of the most-powerful MIDI
editing operations in Pro Tools. This lets you do some really cool things like
change the key of a song, alter the characteristics of a performance, or correct
timing problems. This chapter also leads you through the MIDI Operations
menu and shows you how to perform each of the operations in the menu.
Getting Used to the MIDI Operations Menu
Logically enough, the MIDI Operations window is where you do all your MIDI
operations. This window, shown in Figure 4-1, is accessed by choosing any
one of the MIDI operations listed under the MIDI section of the main menu,
or by choosing Windows➪Show MIDI Operations from the main menu.
After this window is open, you can select the operation you want to perform
from the pop-up menu at the top of the window.
To close the window, press Return (on a Mac) or Enter in the alphanumeric
section of the keyboard (on a PC) when you apply the operation.
When you use the MIDI Operations window, you can use the following com-
mands as a fast way to navigate and adjust parameters:
✦Press Tab to move forward through the fields in the window and
Shift+Tab to move backward through the fields.

Performing MIDI Operations

✦Use the Up and Down arrows to adjust values up and down in your
selected field.
✦Press Ctrl (on a PC) or Command (on a Mac) as you drag to adjust the
value up or down in your selected field’s dialog box.
✦Press Command (on a Mac) or Ctrl (on a PC) to increase the resolution
of the sliders as you use them to adjust the values in your selected field.
✦Play a note on your MIDI controller to select a note in fields with pitch
and velocity settings.
Performing MIDI Operations
MIDI operations are all done from the MIDI Operations window (see previous
section). The operations you can perform are listed in the pop-up menu at
the top of the window. In version 6 of Pro Tools, you have the following oper-
ations available to you (as shown in Figure 4-2):
✦Quantize: Lets you adjust the timing of your selected notes.
✦Groove Quantize: Similar to the Quantize operation, except you use a
groove template to create a grid to quantize to.
✦Restore Performance: This option lets you return to previously saved
performance settings.
✦Flatten Performance: This option lets you tweak performance data and
lock it in before you do any more tweaking.
✦Change Velocity: Lets you adjust the volume of the attack or the release
of selected MIDI notes.

✦Input Quantize: Lets you set a Quantize value that your recorded per-
formance is adjusted to automatically as you record it.
Stay tuned: This section looks at each of these MIDI operations in greater
detail. If you want to perform any one of them, here’s how:
1. Select the note(s) you want to change.
Book 4, Chapter 2 describes how to make these selections.
2. Select the MIDI operation you want to perform from the MIDI section
of the main menu (or choose Windows➪MIDI Operations from the
main menu and choose the operation you want from the window’s
pop-up menu).
3. Make the settings you want in the fields available. 
Check out the section for each operation to see what to adjust.
4. Apply the operation by clicking Apply or using the keyboard:
• If you want to keep the MIDI Operations window open, press Enter in
the number pad section of the keyboard or click Apply.
• If you want to close the MIDI Operations window, press Return (on a
Mac) or Enter in the alphanumeric section of the keyboard (on a PC)
to apply the operation and close the MIDI Operations window.

Quantize
The Quantize MIDI operation lets you adjust the timing of your selected
notes. This is great when you want to conform the rhythmic placement of
your MIDI notes to a grid or you have a problem with a really bad drummer
and you want to fix his timing mistakes.
The Quantize version of the MIDI Operations window, shown in Figure 4-3,
contains the following fields:
✦What to Quantize: This section lets you choose which part of the note
to quantize.
Attacks: This field sets the quantization to the start of the selected
notes.
Releases: Clicking this field quantizes the ends of the notes.
Preserve Note Duration: Clicking this field produces different results
depending on whether you choose Attack or Release.
With Attack selected, Preserve Note Duration keeps the end of the
note intact and with Release selected the start of the note is left
intact. If both Attack and Release are selected, the Preserve Note
Duration option is dimmed.
✦Quantize Grid: This section is where you choose the resolution of the
quantize grid, from whole notes to 32nd notes. If you choose 16th notes,
for example, your notes will move to the nearest 16th note when you
quantize.

Note Selector: This section lets you choose the note value of your
quantize grid. Click the note to select it.
Tuplet Checking: This box lets you select odd note groupings such
as triplets. When you check this option, you need to fill in the tuplet
value. For example, to create a regular eighth-note triplet, choose 3
in time 1; for a quarter-note triplet, choose 3 in time 2.
Offset Grid By: This option lets you move the Quantize grid forward
or backward in time by the selected number of ticks. This is helpful
for creating a groove that lies slightly ahead of — or behind — the
beat.
Swing: This field lets you create a swing feel (dotted-quarter-eighth-
note triplet). You specify a percentage (from 0 to 300); selecting 100%
provides a triplet feel.
✦Options: Choose these to fine-tune your Quantize operation by specifying
which notes to quantize and by how much:
Include Within: Here you specify a range of notes to include.
Selecting this option quantizes only selected notes that fall within
the boundaries you set here (from 0 to 100%); the smaller the
number, the narrower the range of notes affected.
Exclude Within: Here you specify a range of notes to exclude from
quantization. Any selected notes that fall within the boundaries you
set here (between 0 and 100%) won’t be quantized.
Strength: This is, in my opinion, the most-useful function in the Pro
Tool Quantize operation. You can use it to move your quantized
notes by a percentage (from 0 to 100%) rather than just snapping
them right to the grid. Higher numbers keep more strictly to the grid
than do the lower values.
Randomize: This option adds a level of randomness to the quantiz-
ing of your selection — no, not to mess up the rhythm, but to keep it
from being too rigid. You can select values between 0 and 100%. Lower
values place the randomized notes closer to the grid.
Using these four options well helps keep a natural feel in your performance.
Groove Quantize
The Groove Quantize function is similar to the Quantize operation except
that you use a groove template to create the grid to quantize to. This lets
you take the groove from an already-recorded performance and apply it to
the MIDI sequence of your track. This operation is performed from the
Groove Quantize version of the MIDI Operations window, shown Figure 4-4. 

Performing MIDI Operations
484
One limitation of Pro Tools LE is that you can’t create your own groove tem-
plates. Instead, you either have to use the ones that come with Pro Tools
(which aren’t bad), buy one from Digidesign, or hunt one up from a third-
party maker. Of course, there’s an off chance that you may find some down-
loadable ones on the Internet. To find out, I recommend checking out the
Digidesign User Conference Web site at duc.digidesign.com/ (do a search
for Digigroove template).
The fields in the Groove Quantize version of the MIDI Operations window
include the following:
✦Groove Template selector: This pop-up menu lets you choose a groove
template to apply to your selection. (These templates are located in the
Groove folder within the Pro Tools folder on your system’s hard drive.)
After you choose your template, its content, meter, and tempo informa-
tion show up in the Comments section in the middle of the window.
✦Options: Here’s where you can tinker with your groove:
Pre-Process Using “Quantize”: When you have the timing field
enabled (see next section), checking this box applies the setting in
the Quantize version of the MIDI Operations window to the template
before you apply your selection using the Groove Quantize settings.
Timing: This option lets you adjust the timing of the quantization
applied. A setting of 0% makes no change to the selection; a setting
of 100% places the notes right at the groove template’s grid settings.
A setting of 200% moves the selected notes twice the distance from
the template’s grid locations.

Duration: This setting changes the duration of the notes to fit the
groove template. A setting of 0% makes no change, a setting of 100%
matches the notes to the groove template, and a setting beyond that
increases or decreases the duration of the original notes according
to their ratio to the notes in the groove template.
Velocity: This field changes the velocity — the volume — of the quan-
tized notes. As with the other fields (Timing and Duration), the lower
the number, the less the velocity changes. 
✦Slider Settings: You can recall and save the slider settings of the options
with a template. 
• Recall with Template: Checking this box resets all the option settings
to those that are saved with the template.
• Save: Click this button to save your current option settings. If you
choose Save, you can add any comments about the template and they
will show up in the Comments section of the Groove Quantize window.
Restore Performance
Restore Performance returns you to your previously saved performance set-
tings. This operation is like having an Undo for all the other operations listed
in this chapter. Your performance returns to one of two earlier states:
✦The settings saved using the Flatten Performance command (see next
section) if you used it
✦Its original settings (if you haven’t saved any other settings)
Using the Restore Performance version of the MIDI Operations window, you
can select from several areas to restore. (See Figure 4-5.)
✦Timing (Quantization): This option restores the note’s start time. If the
Duration box is unchecked, the duration of the notes changes back to
what it was originally.
✦Duration. This option restores the length of the note. If you don’t have
the Timing box checked, the Start times of your notes don’t change 
but the end times may.
✦Velocity: This option restores the volume of the note.
✦Pitch. Well, you know what this restores.
If you used the Input Quantize operation when you recorded, you can remove
it by using this operation. Choose the Timing (Quantization) option and your
original performance is resurrected in all its pristine beauty.

Performing MIDI Operations
486
Flatten Performance
Flatten Performance is the operation you use when you want to save the per-
formance data of a selection — timing, duration, velocity, and pitch — as the
“original” setting that the Restore Performance operation (see previous sec-
tion) returns you to. The Flatten Performance version of the MIDI Operations
window is shown in Figure 4-6.
This operation lets you tweak performance data and lock it in before you do
more tweaking. If you don’t like the extra tweaking, you can just go back to
these settings. It’s a little added insurance when you’re messing creatively
with MIDI data.
The Flatten Performance operation lets you save the following data:
✦Timing (Quantization): The note’s Start time. If the Duration box is
unchecked, the duration of the note changes back to what it was originally.
✦Duration: The length of the note.
✦Velocity: The volume of the note.

Change Velocity
The Change Velocity version of the MIDI Operations window, shown in Figure
4-7, lets you adjust the volume (velocity in MIDI-speak) of the attack or release
of selected MIDI notes.
This operation is a lifesaver for times when you have a drummer playing an
electronic kit and just one note is weak — or when you need to tame overly
aggressive cymbals.
The Change Velocity window contains the following fields:
✦Change Velocity Of: Here you choose between the initial attack of the
note (attack) or the release value.
✦Set All To: Checking this box sets all the velocities of the selected notes
to the value in the box. You can ether type the value in or move the slider
up or down. 
✦Add: Here you add a specified value to your existing one. You can either
enter the value in the box or use the slider.
✦Subtract: Here you subtract a specified value to your existing one. You
can either enter the value in the box or use the slider.
✦Scale By: Here you set a scale for how much the velocities of your
selected notes are to change — a percentage between 1 and 400. (Again,
you can use the slider or type in a number.)

✦Change Smoothly: This lets you change the velocity of selected notes
gradually over time. This is useful for creating crescendos and decrescen-
dos. Type in the beginning and end values in the fields.
✦Change Smoothly By Percentage: This option is similar to Change
Smoothly (see previous bullet), except you specify a percentage of change
instead of typing in specific numbers. This field is also where you can
use a curve graph to specify how much the notes’ velocity must increase
or decrease; you choose a percentage value between –99 and +99. The
curve graph then shows how your setting is implemented.
✦Limit To: Select this option if you want to set a minimum and maximum
range for your Change Velocity settings. You type those values into the
fields.
✦Randomize: Here you create a random velocity change, specifying it as a
percentage value between 0 and 100%. For example, if you choose a Set
All To value of 60 and a Randomize setting of 40%, you end up with
Change Velocity values from 48 to 72.
Be careful if you’re changing groups of notes. Using Add or Subtract for that
purpose can change the relationships between various notes. If you like the
way the original notes sound together, try using the Scale option instead.
This keeps the relationships between notes intact.
Change Duration
The Change Duration operation lets you alter the length of recorded MIDI
notes. The Change Duration version of the MIDI Operations window, seen in
Figure 4-8, contains the following fields:
✦Set All To: Check this box to set the duration of selected notes to the
value in the box.
✦Add: Here you add a specified value to your existing one.
✦Subtract: Here you subtract a specified value to your existing one.
✦Scale By: Here you set a scale for how much the velocities of your
selected notes are to change — a percentage between 1 and 400.
✦Move Releases to the Closest Attack: This setting moves the end times
of the notes to the closest attack by either lengthening or shortening the
notes. 
✦Extend Releases to the Next Attack: This setting extends the selected
notes to the next attack. You can limit this extension by entering a value
in the Add No More Than fields either as a percentage or by quarter
notes and ticks (portions of quarter notes). 
✦Change Smoothly: Here you change the length of notes gradually over
time, entering quarter notes and ticks in the From and To boxes to spec-
ify beginning and end times for the change in duration.

✦Change Smoothly by Percentage: This field lets you apply the duration
change smoothly (see previous bullet) by a percentage rather than by
entering quarter notes and ticks. You can also adjust the curve of the
change, using values from –99 to +99.
✦Limit Range: This setting lets you specify a minimum and maximum
change duration for the settings you’ve chosen.
✦Randomize: This field lets you create a random change in duration,
based on the setting you chose in the fields described here.
The Change Duration operation is useful for changing the feel of the music
by making your selection either more staccato or legato.
Transpose
The Transpose operation lets you change the pitch of selected notes. Checking
out the Transpose version of the MIDI Operations window, shown in Figure
4-9, you see that the Transpose operation offers you two ways of doing this:
✦Transpose By: This setting lets you transpose by semitones (1/2 step).
You can either type in the value or use the slider to adjust the setting.
✦Transpose: Here you type in the note and octave that you want to trans-
pose from (in the From box) and to (in the To box). You can also use the
slider to adjust the settings if you prefer.
Transposing using this MIDI operation makes it easy to change the pitch —
in effect, the musical key — of the entire song or region. This is especially
helpful if you decide that the song needs to be in a different key for your
singer to sing well.

Select Notes
The Select Notes operation allows you to choose specific MIDI notes or a
range of notes in a selection. Your options, shown in the Select Notes version
of the Operations window you see in Figure 4-10, include these:
✦All Notes: This option selects all the notes in your selection.
✦Notes Between: This option lets you specify the range of notes to select.
You can either use pitch references (C1, B1, and so on) or MIDI note num-
bers (0-127) for your selection.
✦Top: This option chooses the highest note or notes (depending on the
number you enter) in each chord.
✦Bottom: This option selects the lowest note or notes (depending on the
number you enter) in each chord.
To actually select notes, do the following:
1. Make a selection on a track or tracks that contain the notes you want
to select.
Book 4, Chapter 2 has all you need to know about making selections.
2. Choose MIDI➪Select Notes from the main menu.

3. Enter your note or note range in the window.
Again, your choices here are All Notes, Notes Between, Top, and Bottom.
4. Click Apply.
This operation is handy for selecting the snare drum from a drum sequence
before you change its note (pitch) or quantize it. 
Split Notes
The Split Notes version of the MIDI Operations window, shown in Figure 4-11,
is similar to the Select Notes version (see previous section). It allows you to
select a note or range of notes, but in addition you can also either copy or
cut the selected notes. These two options each treat the material differently:
✦Copy: This command places a copy of the selected notes in the Clipboard
so you can place them somewhere else.
✦Cut: This removes the selected notes from the original track and places
them in the Clipboard so that you can paste them into another location.
The Split Notes operation is handy for taking the tom-toms from a drum
sequence and moving them to their own track where you can edit, pan, and
effect them separately from the rest of the drums. Another useful thing you
can do with Split Notes (keeping the drum-track theme going) is to make a
copy of all the kick-drum notes and put them in another track where you can
process them and add them to the original kick during mixdown. (Hey, why
not get your kicks while you can? Sorry about that.)
To actually split notes from a MIDI track, do the following:
1. Make a selection on a track or tracks that contain the notes you want
to select.
Book 4, Chapter 2 has all you need to know about making selections.

5. Click Apply.
To place the split notes into another track, do the following:
1. Position your cursor in the destination track at the same point as the
Start point of your Split Note operation.
2. Press Command+V (on a Mac) or Ctrl+V (on a PC) to place the copies
or cut notes from your Clipboard into the track.
Input Quantize
The Input Quantize operation lets you set a Quantize value that your recorded
performance is adjusted to automatically as you record it. The fields you can
adjust in the Input Quantize version of the Operations window (see Figure 4-12)
are the same as with the Quantize operation. 
Unless your timing is really bad (or the person you record can’t walk and chew
gum at the same time), I suggest that you disable this function and quantize —
if needed — after your performance is saved. Otherwise it’s incredibly easy
to overdo the quantizing and end up with a performance with absolutely no
human feel to it.

hink about all the time it took for you to record all the tracks for your
song. You spent countless hours setting up mics; getting good, “hot”
(high, but not distorting) levels on your instruments; and making sure each
performance was as good as you could get it. You’d think, then, that most of
your work would be done. 
Well, on the one hand, it is — you no longer have to set up and play each
instrument. On the other hand, you still have to make all the parts that you
recorded fit together. This process can take as long as it took you to record
all the tracks in the first place. In fact, for many people, it takes even longer
to mix the song than to record all its parts.
In this chapter, I introduce you to the process of mixing your music. You get
a chance to see the basics of mixing using the Pro Tools Mix window and
you discover how to set up external mixing aids such as MIDI control sur-
faces, digital mixers, and analog mixers. To top it all off, you discover how to
reference your music to other people’s recordings and how to train your
ears so that your mix “translates” to different types of playback systems. 
Mixing music is a very subjective thing. You can relate one instrument to
another in an almost infinite variety of ways. You may find that several mixes
work equally well for your song. Allow yourself to experiment and don’t be
afraid to record several different mixes if you want.
Understanding Mixing
The goal of mixing is to make sure each instrument can be heard in the 
mix — the recorded whole that results from blending all your recorded

Managing Levels as You Work
496
parts together — without covering up something else or sounding out of
place. You can pull this off in several ways:
✦Choosing the recorded parts that add to the emotional impact of the
music and build intensity throughout the song. By necessity, this also
means choosing not to use parts that are unnecessary, or which clash
with parts that have a greater impact.
✦Setting the level (volume) of each instrument relative to the others so
nothing is buried so far back in the mix that you can’t hear it — and no
instrument is so loud that it overpowers the other instruments.
✦Adjusting the equalization (also called EQ or frequency response) of
each instrument so each leaves room for the other instruments in the
mix. This means getting rid of any frequencies of an instrument that
clash with those of another, or emphasizing certain frequencies that
define the sound of an instrument so it can be heard clearly in the mix.
✦Taking advantage of stereo panning (movement from left to right) to put
each instrument in its proper place in the stereo field — toward the left
or right — where it can either sound as natural as possible or produce a
desired effect. Also, stereo panning allows you to make room for each
instrument in the mix, especially those with similar frequency ranges.
✦Adding effects (such as reverb or delay), to the instruments in the mix
to either place them “in front” or “in back” relative to other instruments
or to create a desired sound.
The mixing process is where you can get really creative in crafting your song.
The stress of capturing great performances is over — all that’s left for you to
do is to massage all the parts of your song into a cohesive whole. Don’t be
afraid to try new things. Experiment with different EQ, panning, and effect
settings. Take your time and have fun. The great thing about mixing is that
you can make as many versions as you want — and you can always go back
and try again. 
Managing Levels as You Work
When you mix all the tracks in your session together, the mix bus (which, for
its part, is controlled by the master fader) is where they end up. There the
signals are summed (added together) and result in a level (volume) that is
higher than that of the original tracks. One danger in mixing in-the-box (within
Pro Tools) is that this level can get pretty high and you may not recognize it
unless you listen very carefully.
As you work, watch the level meter in the master fader and make adjust-
ments to the individual tracks to bring the individual levels down, rather
than dropping the fader on the master.

Book VI
Chapter 1
Mixing Basics
Getting Started Mixing Your Song
497
Many people like to get the most volume out of their song when mixing, so
they crank the master fader up to where the levels peak right at 0dB or maybe
–.1dB. This used to be considered okay to do, but more and more professional
engineers are backing off on the mix bus by as much as 6dB. This is what I
recommend as well. Keep your peak levels that go to the master fader down
to about –3dB to –6dB and make this up when you master (or have someone
else master) your music. Sure, the volume will be lower than it is on the com-
mercial CDs you own — but you can adjust that during the mastering process.
(Book 7, Chapter 1 has more on mastering.)
The advantage to keeping peak levels down is that you get better levels going
to the mix bus and reduce the chance that some clipping (also called overs in
digital recording — distortion that results when the summed signals end up
too hot and overload the mix bus) will happen.
Getting Started Mixing Your Song
Before I start to mix a song, I do a few things to prepare myself for the process.
My goal before I mix is to get in the headspace of mixing. This often means
taking a step back from the song and approaching it as a listener rather than
as the musician who recorded each of the tracks. Start the mixing process by
following these steps:
1. Determine the overall quality you want from the song.
At this point I don’t mean “quality” in terms of “is it good or bad?”
Rather, I define “quality” here as a musical style or a feeling. Do you want
it to kick? Soothe? Scream? You probably don’t need to think about this
too hard if you had a definite sound in mind when you started recording.
In fact, most composers hear a song in their heads before they even
start recording.
2. Listen to a song or two from a CD that has a sound or feel similar to
the song you’re trying to mix.
Listen to the examples on your studio monitors if you can; try to get a
sense of the tonal and textural quality of these songs. Listen to them at
fairly low volume; be careful not to tire your ears. All you’re trying to do
at this point is get your ears familiar with the sound you’re trying to pro-
duce in your music.
3. Set up a rough mix using no EQ or effects and listen through it once.
For this listening session, don’t think like a producer; rather, try to put
yourself in the mindset of the average listener. Listen to the various
parts that you’ve recorded — does anything stick out as particularly
good or bad? You’re not listening for production quality. You’re trying to
determine which instruments, musical phrases, licks, melodies, or har-
monies grab you as a listener.

Mixing In Pro Tools
498
4. Get a piece of paper and a pen to jot down ideas as you work.
As you listen through the song, take notes on where certain instruments
should be in the mix. For example, you may want the licks you played on
lead guitar throughout the song to be muted during the first verse. Or
maybe you decide that the third rhythm guitar part you recorded would
be best put way to the right side of the mix while the other two rhythm
guitar parts might be closer to the center. Write these ideas down so you
can try them later. Chances are you’ll have a lot of ideas as you listen
through the first few times.
Mixing In Pro Tools
Pro Tools comes with a powerful software mixer — everything you may want
to do can be done with mouse and keyboard. Even so, many people — myself
included — prefer to mix using real faders, knobs, and buttons. This can be
done several ways: using the Digi 002 control surface, a MIDI controller, a digi-
tal mixer, or an analog mixer. These alternative types of mixers are covered
in more detail in Book 1, Chapter 2; for now, I just want to cover the basic
setups of these various options.
Using the 002 control surface
If you have the Digi 002 with the control surface, your system is automatically
integrated within Pro Tools software. With your system hooked up via the
FireWire interface, all of your faders, knobs, and buttons should work seam-
lessly with the software mixer. When you push a fader on the control surface,
the corresponding track fader in the computer moves as well. 
Check out the manual for the 002 to get familiar with the operation of its
control options. Or you can just fiddle around a bit — the controller is very
intuitively set up.
Using a MIDI controller
Quite a few MIDI control surfaces currently on the market work well with Pro
Tools. (The Mackie Control is one that immediately comes to mind.) If you
want to go the MIDI route, check out the compatibility page on the Digidesign
Web site (www.digidesign.com/compato/) to see whether the unit you’re
interested in is supported.
Hooking up a MIDI control surface is the same as setting up any MIDI instru-
ment, so go to Book 5, Chapter 1 for details on configuring your system.

Book VI
Chapter 1
Mixing Basics
Mixing In Pro Tools
499
Once you’re hooked up and running, the control surface is basically the
same as using a Digi 002. All your faders, knobs, and buttons on your control
surface will adjust one of the parameters in the Pro Tools software. The
manual for your MIDI control surface will spell out the function of each of
the buttons. In the case of the Mackie Control, you can get a template that
fits over the surface of the controller and shows you the appropriate func-
tions in Pro Tools listed for easy reference.
Using a digital mixer
If you want to use a digital mixer with your Pro Tools system, you need to
make sure that you have the proper number of digital inputs and outputs in
your Digidesign interface in order to connect to your mixer. With the 002 Rack,
for example, you have ten outputs (eight ADAT and two S/PDIF) that you can
use to send your tracks from your computer to your mixer. (Just make sure
that your mixer can accept ADAT and S/PDIDF signals at the same time, other-
wise you’re down to eight.) This means you can send no more than ten tracks
of material to your mixer to mix. In this example, if you have a session with
more than ten tracks, your digital mixer becomes somewhat useless — unless
you want to mix in stages (ten tracks at a time) or mix in the box (within Pro
Tools) and from your mixer.
I don’t recommend this half-in-the-box approach because you’ll have a delay
between the internal track and the tracks sent to your mixer. Any such delay
will really mess with the feel of your music.
To connect your digital mixer to your Pro Tools system, simply run the appro-
priate cables (ADAT, for instance) from the output of your Digidesign interface
to the input of your digital mixer. When you move a fader (or a button or a
knob) in your mixer, the corresponding fader (or button or knob) track in
the Pro Tools software you see on-screen won’t be affected.
Using an analog mixer
As was the case with the digital mixer, your ability to mix in an analog mixer
is limited by the number of outputs that your interface has. In this case, it all
depends on the number of analog outputs you have. For example, the 002 R
provides eight analog outputs, so this is the maximum number of tracks you
can mix with an analog mixer at any one time.
Mixing a session with more than eight tracks can be done, but it’s not worth
the hassle in my opinion, unless you have a really expensive analog mixer.
Inexpensive analog mixers (those under $10,000, for instance) won’t sound
any better than mixing within Pro Tools.

Using the Stereo Field
500
If, for some reason, you want to mix your session through an analog mixer,
all you need to do is connect each of the analog outputs from your Digidesign
hardware to one of the inputs of your mixer. In the case of the 002 Rack, you
need eight TS cables running from outputs 1 through 8 to the corresponding
inputs of your mixer. (Book 1, Chapter 2 has more on the various cables you
meet in the recording world.)
Using the Stereo Field
When you’re at a live concert and you close your eyes, you can hear where
each instrument is coming from on stage. You can hear that certain instru-
ments are on the left side of the stage, others are on the right, and still others
seem to come from the center. You can also generally discern whether an
instrument is at the front or the back of the stage. Put all these sound-based
impressions together, and you’ve got a 3D image made of sound — a stereo
field.
What makes up the stereo field is the specific placement of sound sources
from left to right and front to back. When you mix a song, you can set your
instruments wherever you want them on the imaginary “stage” created by
your listener’s speakers. You can do this with panning, which sets your
instruments from left to right, and you can use effects (such as reverb and
delay), to provide the illusion of distance, placing your instruments toward
the front or back in your mix. (Book 6, Chapter 4 has more on effects.) When
you mix your song, try to visualize where on stage each of your instruments
might be placed.
Some people choose to set the panning and depth of their instruments to
sound as natural as possible, while others use these settings to create other-
worldly sounds. There is no right or wrong when panning and adding effects
to simulate depth, just what works for your goals. Don’t be afraid to get cre-
ative and try unusual things.
Left or right
You adjust each instrument’s position from left to right in a mix with the
Panning control, located in the Pro Tools Mix window. (See Figure 1-1.) Panning
for most songs is pretty straightforward, and I outline some settings in the
following sections. Some mixing engineers like to keep their instruments
toward the center of the mix; other engineers prefer spreading things way
out with instruments on either end of the spectrum. There’s no absolute
right or wrong way to pan instruments. In fact, no one says you have to leave
any of your instruments in the same place throughout the entire song. Just
make sure that your panning choices contribute to the overall impact of the
music. (Check out Book 6, Chapter 5 for how to automate your panning in
Pro Tools.) 

Book VI

Lead vocals
Lead vocals are usually panned directly in the center.
Backup vocals
Because backup vocals are often recorded in stereo, they are panned hard
left and hard right. If you recorded only one track of backup vocals, you can
make a duplicate of the track and pan one to each side, just as you can with
stereo tracks.
In addition to tracks panned to each side, some mixing engineers also have a
third backup vocal track panned in the center to add more depth. Your choice
to do this depends on how you recorded your backup vocals, and on how
many tracks you have available for them.

Using the Stereo Field
502
Guitar parts
Lead guitar is often panned to the center (or just slightly off-center if the
sound in the center of the stereo field is too cluttered). Rhythm guitar, on
the other hand, is generally placed somewhere just off-center. Which side
doesn’t matter, but it’s usually the opposite side from any other background
instruments, such as an additional rhythm guitar, synthesizers, organs, or
pianos.
Bass
Normally the bass guitar is panned in the center, but it’s not uncommon for
mixing engineers to create a second track for the bass — panning one to the
far left and the other to the far right. This gives the bass a sense of spacious-
ness and allows more room for both the bass guitar and the kick drum in
the mix.
Drums
As a general rule, I (and most other people) pan the drums so they appear in
the stereo field much as they would on stage (but this doesn’t mean you have
to). The snare drum and kick drum are typically panned right up the center,
with the tom-toms panned from slightly right to slightly left. Hi-hat cymbals
often go just to the right of center, the ride cymbal just left of center, and
crash cymbals sit from left to right, much like the tom-toms.
Percussion
Percussion instruments tend to be panned just off to the left or right of center.
If I have a shaker or triangle part that plays throughout the song, for instance,
I’ll pan it to the right an equal distance from center as the hi-hat is to the left.
This way you hear the hi-hat and percussion parts playing off one another in
the mix.
Piano/synthesizers/organs
These instruments are usually placed just off-center. If your song has rhythm
guitar parts, then the piano or organ usually goes to the other side.
Synthesizers can be panned all over the place. In fact, it’s not uncommon for
the synths to be actively panned throughout the song (that is, they move
from place to place).
Front or back
As you probably discovered when you were placing your mics to record an
instrument, the quality of sound changes when you place a mic closer to —
or farther away from — the instrument. The closer you place the mic, the

Book VI
Chapter 1
Mixing Basics
Adjusting Levels: Enhancing the Emotion of the Song
503
less room ambience you pick up, which makes the instrument sound closer
to you or “in your face.” By contrast, the farther from the instrument you
place your mic, the more room sound you hear; the instrument sounds far-
ther away.
If you’ve ever stood in a large room and talked to someone, you have seen
(well, heard, actually) how this relationship works. When your friend stands
close to you, you can hear him clearly. You hear very little of the reflections
of his voice from around the room. As he moves farther away from you, the
room’s reflections play an increasing role in the way that you hear him. By
the time your friend is at the other side of the room, you hear not only his
voice, but also the room in which you are talking with him. In fact, if the
room is large enough, your friend probably sounds as if he were a mile away
from you, and all the reflections from his voice bouncing around the room
may make it difficult to understand what he says.
You can easily simulate this effect by using your reverb or delay effects
processors. In fact, this is often the purpose of reverb and delay in the mixing
process. With them, you can effectively “place” your instruments almost any-
where that you want them, from front to back, in your mix.
The less reverb or delay you use with your instrument, the closer it appears
on the recording; the more effect you add to an instrument, the farther away
it seems.
The type of reverb or delay setting that you use has an impact on how close
or far away a sound appears as well. For example, a longer reverb decay or
delay sounds farther away than a shorter one. 
In Book 6, Chapter 4, I go into detail about the various effects processors to
help you understand how best to use them. I also present settings you can
use to create natural-sounding reverb and delay on your tracks, as well as
some unusual settings that you can use for special effects.
Adjusting Levels: Enhancing the Emotion of the Song
After you have a rough mix and have gotten your EQ (Book 6, Chapter 3) and
panning settings where you want them, your next step is to determine which
parts of which tracks are used when — and sometimes whether a part or
track is used at all. If you’re like most musician/producers, you try to get all
the wonderful instrumental and vocal parts you recorded as loud as possible
in the mix so each brilliant note can be heard clearly all the time. After all,
you didn’t go through all the time and effort to record all those great tracks
just to hide them in the mix or (worse yet) mute them, right?

Adjusting Levels: Enhancing the Emotion of the Song
504
Well, I feel your pain. But when you get to the mixing point of a song, it’s time
to take off your musician’s hat and put on the one that says producer. And a
producer’s job is to sort through all the parts of a song, choose those that
add to its impact, and dump those that are superfluous or just add clutter.
Your goal is to assemble the tracks that tell the story you want to tell and
that carry the greatest emotional impact for the listener.
This can be the toughest part of mixing your own songs, because you aren’t
likely to be totally objective when it comes to determining what to use and
what not to use. Try not to get stressed out. You aren’t erasing any of your
tracks, so you can always do another mix later on if you just have to hear the
part that you muted before.
One of the great joys when listening to music (for me, anyway) is hearing a
song that carries me away and pulls me into the emotional journey that
the songwriter had in mind. If the song is done well, I’m sucked right into the
song, and by the end, all I want to do is rewind it and listen to it again.
What is it about certain songs that can draw you in and get you to feel the
emotion of the performers? Well, aside from a good melody and some great
performances, it’s the way the arrangement builds throughout the song to
create tension, release that tension, and build it up again. A good song builds
intensity so that the listener feels pulled into the emotions of the song.
Generally, a song starts out quiet, becomes a little louder during the first
chorus, and then drops down in level for the second verse (not as quiet as
the first, though). The second chorus is often louder and fuller than the first
chorus, and is often followed by a bridge section that is even fuller yet (or at
least differs in arrangement from the second chorus). The loud bridge sec-
tion may be followed by a third verse where the volume drops a little. Then a
superheated chorus generally follows the last verse and keeps building
intensity until the song ends.
When you’re crafting the mix for your song, you have two tools at your dis-
posal to build and release intensity: dynamics and instrumental content (the
arrangement).
Dynamics
Dynamics are simply how loud or soft something is — and whether the loud-
ness is emotionally effective. Listen to a classic blues tune (or even some
classical music), and you’ll hear sections where the song is almost deafen-
ingly silent and other sections where you think the band is actually going to

Book VI
Chapter 1
Mixing Basics
Adjusting Levels: Enhancing the Emotion of the Song
505
step out of the speakers and into your room. This is an effective and power-
ful use of dynamics. The problem is that this seems to be a lost art, at least
in popular music.
It used to be that a song could have very quiet parts and really loud ones.
Unfortunately, a lot of CDs nowadays have only one level — loud. This often
isn’t the fault of the musicians or even the band’s producer. Radio stations
and record-company bean counters have fueled this trend; they’re betting
that if a band’s music is as loud as (or louder than) other CDs on the market,
it’ll attract more attention and sell more copies. (You can read more about
this trend in Book 7, Chapter 1.) But consider: Whether you can hear the
music is one thing; whether it’s worth listening to is another.
Try recording a song with a lot of dynamic changes. I know this bucks the
trend, but who knows? You may end up with a song that carries a ton of emo-
tional impact. Also, as you mix your song, incorporate dynamic variation by
dropping the levels of background instruments during the verses and bring-
ing them up during the chorus and bridge sections of the song. You can
always eliminate your dynamic variation (if you absolutely have to) by
squashing your mix with compression during the mastering process.
The biggest mistake that most people make when they mix their own music
is to try to get their song as loud as commercial CDs. This is the mastering
engineer’s job, however, not yours, so don’t worry about it. Get your song to
sound good with a balance between high and low frequencies and loud and
soft sections. Let the mastering engineer make your music as loud as it can
be. He or she definitely has gear that is better designed to raise the volume
of a recording without making it sound squashed or harsh.
The arrangement
Building intensity with the arrangement involves varying the amount of
sound in each section. A verse with just lead vocal, drums, bass, and an
instrument playing the basic chords of the song is going to have less inten-
sity (not to mention volume) than a chorus with a wash of guitars, backup
vocals, drums, percussion, organ, and so on. Most songs that build intensity
effectively start with fewer instruments than they end with.
When you mix your song, think about how you can use the instruments to
add to the emotional content of your lyrics. For example, if you have a guitar
lick that you played at every break in the vocal line, think about using it less
to leave space for lower levels at certain points in your song. If you do this,
each lick will provide more impact for the listener and bring more to the
song’s emotion.

Tuning Your Ears
506
Tuning Your Ears
To create a mix that sounds good, the most critical tools you need are your
ears, because your ability to hear the music clearly and accurately is essential.
To maximize this ability, you need a decent set of studio monitors and a good
idea how other people’s music sounds on your speakers. You also need to
make sure that you don’t mix when your ears are tired. This section explores
these areas.
Listening critically
One of the best ways to learn how to mix music is to listen to music that you
like — and listen, in particular, for the way it’s mixed. Put on a CD of some-
thing similar to your music (or music that has sound you like) and ask your-
self the following questions:
✦What is the overall tonal quality or texture of the song? Notice how
the frequencies of all the instruments cover the hearing spectrum. Does
the song sound smooth or harsh, full or thin? Try to determine what you
like about the overall production.
✦How does the song’s arrangement contribute to its overall feel? Listen
for licks or phrases that add to the arrangement. Notice if the song seems
to get fuller as it goes on.
✦Where are the instruments in the stereo field? Notice where each
instrument is, from left to right and front to back, in the mix. Listen to
see whether they stay in one place throughout the song or move around.
✦What effects are being used on each instrument? Listen for reverb and
delay — in particular, how they affect decay lengths — as well as for the
overall effect level compared to the dry (unaffected) signal.
✦What tonal quality does each instrument have? Try to determine the
frequencies from each instrument that seem dominant. Pay particular
attention to the way the drums sound, especially the snare drum.
Even if you’re not mixing one of your songs, it’s a good idea to just sit down
once in a while and listen to music on your monitors to get used to listening
to music critically. Also, the more well-made music you hear on your moni-
tors, the easier it is to know when your music sounds good on those same
speakers.
A good mix should sound good on a variety of systems, not just through the
speakers in your studio. Before you decide a mix is done, copy it onto a CD
and play it in your car, your friend’s stereo, and a boom box. In fact, try to
listen to your music on as many different kinds of systems as you can. As

Book VI
Chapter 1
Mixing Basics
Tuning Your Ears
507
you listen, notice if the bass disappears or becomes too loud or if the treble
becomes thin or harsh. Basically you’re trying to determine where you need
to make adjustments in your mix so that it sounds good everywhere.
Unless you spent a lot of time and money getting your mixing room to sound
world-class, you’ll have to compensate when you mix to get your music to
sound good on other people’s systems. If your room or speakers enhance the
bass in your song, the same tracks will sound thin on other people’s systems.
On the other hand, if your system lacks bass, your mixes will be boomy when
you listen to them somewhere else.
Choosing reference CDs
A reference CD can be any music that you like or that helps you to hear your
music more clearly. For the most part, choose reference CDs that have a good
balance between high and low frequencies and that sound good to your ear.
That said, some CDs are mixed really well, which can help you get to know
your monitors and train your ears to hear the subtleties of a mix. I name a
few in the following list. (Disclaimer: I try to cover a variety of music styles
in this list, but can’t cover them all without a list that’s pages long.)
✦Steely Dan, Two Against Nature
✦Peter Gabriel, So
✦Sarah McLachlan, Surfacing
✦No Doubt, Return of Saturn
✦Los Lobos, Kiko
✦Marilyn Manson, Mechanical Animals
✦Depeche Mode, Ultra
✦Bonnie Raitt, Fundamental
✦Macy Gray, On How Life Is
✦Pearl Jam, Yield
✦Metallica, S&M
✦Dr. Dre, 2001
All commercial CDs have been mastered. This is going to affect their sound
a little — most importantly, they’ll be louder than your music in its pre-
mastered form. If you toggle back and forth between your mix and a reference
CD, adjust the relative levels so that each one sounds equally loud coming
through your speakers. The louder song always sounds “better.” And what-
ever you do, don’t try to match the volume of your mix to a reference CD.

Tuning Your Ears
508
Dealing with ear fatigue
If you’ve ever had a chance to mix a song, you may have found that you do a
better mix early on in the process, and the longer you work on the song, the
worse the mix gets. In most cases, this is because your ears get tired — and
when they do, hearing accurately becomes harder. To tame ear fatigue, try
the following:
✦Don’t mix at the end of the day, especially after doing any other
recording. Save your mixing for first thing in the morning when your
ears have had a chance to rest. 
✦Keep the volume low. I know you’ll be tempted to crank the volume on
your song as you work on it, but doing so only tires your ears prema-
turely and can cause damage, especially if you have monitors that can
get really loud.
✦Take a break once in a while. Just 10 or 15 minutes of silence can allow
you to work for another hour or so. Also, don’t be afraid to walk away
from a mix for a day or more.
✦Try not to mix under a deadline. This suggestion fits with the preced-
ing one. If you’re under a deadline, you can’t give yourself the time you
may need to rest and reassess your mix before it goes to print.
Making several versions
One great thing about digital recording is that it costs you nothing to make
several versions of a mix. All you need is a little (well, actually a lot of) hard-
disk space. Because you can make as many variations on your song’s mix as
your hard drive allows, you can really experiment by trying new effects set-
tings or trying active panning in your song and see whether you like it. You
may end up with something exciting. At the very least, you end up learning
more about your gear. That’s always a good thing.
Print (that is, make a clear recording of) a mix early on. Most of the time,
your best mixes happen early in the mixing process. Print (or save) the first
good mix you make — before you try making more “creative” ones. If you get
burned out or run out of time, you still have a decent mix to fall back on.

efore you can actually mix anything in Pro Tools, you have to get a few
preliminaries out of the way first. More specifically, you need to open
the Mix window, you need to have a good grasp of how the signal flows
through the system, you need to know how to create auxiliary inputs and
master faders, and you need to get up to speed on inserts and sends. This
chapter gives you the details on all of these things.
Revisiting the Mix Window
When you mix in Pro Tools, you spend most of your time working in the Mix
Window, as shown in Figure 2-1. The Mix window contains the channels strips
for each track, routing information, and your master faders. Each part of the
Mix window is covered in detail in Book 2, Chapter 4.
To open the Mix window, choose Windows➪Show Mix from the main menu
or press Command+equal sign (=) on a Mac or Ctrl+equal sign (=) on a PC.
You can then set up the display parameters of the window by choosing
Display➪Mix Window Shows from the main menu and choosing the options
you want included in the view, as shown in Figure 2-2.

Getting to Know Signal Flow
Knowing how the tracks you record are routed through Pro Tools can help
you make the best choices and keep your sound top-notch as you mix your
song. Figure 2-3 shows how the signal (represented by the regions in your
audio tracks) flows through the track channels in the Pro Tools mixer
(shown in the Mix window).
The audio enters the mixer at the top of the diagram and flows downward.
From top to bottom, the channel strip contains the following sections:
✦Source: This is the audio recorded to your hard drive or, if you have the
track record-enabled, the input coming from the input you have selected
in the Input section of the channel strip. The signal starts here and
enters the Track’s channel strip. 
✦Insert: This lets you insert effects into your track. Inserts in Audio and
Auxiliary Input tracks occur before the fader (pre-fader) for the track.
Inserts on master fader tracks occur after the fader (post-fader).
✦Send Pre-fader: This lets you send your signal out to an Auxiliary Input
track where you can then insert an effect. 
✦Mute: This button lets you mute (turn off) the output of the track.
✦Fader: This lets you control the level (volume) of your signal leaving the
track and going to the output(s) you have chosen in the Output section
of the channel strip.
✦Send Post-fader: When you have the “Pre” button disengaged, your Send
signal is sent from your track after it passes through the track fader.
Adjusting the volume of the track also adjusts the level going through
your send.
✦Pan: This lets you adjust how much of your signal goes to the left or right
channel of your stereo output. This option is only available if your Output
setting is set for stereo. 
✦Output: This is where your signal goes as it leaves the track’s channel
strip. This can be the master bus, or an effect or submix bus (controlled
by an Auxiliary Input track). 
To create a new track (whether audio, MIDI, auxiliary input, or master fader)
choose File➪New Track from the main menu to call up the New Track dialog
box, where you can choose the type of track you want to create. (Book 3,
Chapter 1 covers this process in detail.)

Rounding Out Your Routing

Rounding Out Your Routing
When you start mixing in Pro Tools, it helps to have few routing setups under
control. You need a master fader so you can control the volume leaving Pro
Tools, and you need to know how to use the insert and send portions of the
channel strip so that you can insert effects into your tracks. This section out-
lines these procedures.

If you’re using version 6 or higher, you can make a track inactive by Ctrl+
Start/Windows+clicking (on a PC) or Command+Ctrl+clicking (on a Mac) the
Track Type indicator in the lower right of the track’s channel strip (as in
Figure 2-4). This frees up processing power, and is something I recommend
for any tracks in your session that you don’t want to play.
Using a master fader
The master fader is used to control the level coming out of all the tracks routed
to it. Here’s a short list of a few of the things you can do with a master fader:
✦Control the main level of your mix: This is the standard use of this
fader. All your tracks are routed to the master fader and you use it to
control the overall level going to your monitors.
✦Control submix levels: To do this, route the tracks you want to submix
to one of your buses and assign the input of the master fader to this bus.
Click here

track inactive.

The output of this master fader goes to your master bus. You can set the
individual levels of the submixed track at each track’s fader and the
combined level at this submix’s master fader. 
✦Control effect-send levels: You can route your sends — signals going
through the Send section of your track — to a bus and designate that
bus as the input of a master fader. You can then insert your effect into
this master fader’s input, and set the resulting output to go to your mix
bus’s master fader.
✦Add effects to your entire mix: You can add effects such as compression
or reverb to the entire mix by placing it in the insert of the master fader. 
To create a master fader, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪New Track from the main menu.
The New Track dialog box appears.
2. Use the drop-down menus to enter the number of tracks you want, the
type (in this case choose Master Fader) and whether you want your
tracks(s) in stereo.
3. Click Create. 
The master fader appears in your session.
4. Click the master fader’s Output selector — the second of the three but-
tons in the middle of the channel strip — and set it to the output that
you want it to control. 
Set this to the main outputs that all your tracks are routed to if you want
to make this the master fader for your main mix bus.
Adding auxiliary inputs
Auxiliary inputs are pretty much like audio tracks, except they receive a signal
from within Pro Tools, rather than from some external source (such as a micro-
phone). Auxiliary inputs let you route internally and are great for some vital
mixing tasks such as
✦Sending several tracks to a single effect processor: This can reduce the
stress on your system and can help you to make your tracks sound more
cohesive — by blending their reverb sounds together, for example. 
✦Controlling a submix with a single fader: Submixing is the process of
mixing tracks together before they are mixed by the master bus. Book 6,
Chapter 7 details how to perform a submix in Pro Tools.
✦Inputting audio signals from your MIDI devices: This lets you monitor
the output from your MIDI devices as your MIDI tracks trigger them.

To create an auxiliary input track, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪New Track from the main menu.
The New Track dialog box appears.
2. Use the drop-down menus to enter the number of tracks you want, the
type (in this case choose Auxiliary Input), and whether you want your
tracks(s) in stereo.
3. Click Create.
The auxiliary input appears in your session.
4. Click the track’s Input selector — topmost of the three buttons in the
I/O section of the channel strip — and choose the source for this track.
This can be an internal bus or hardware input.
5. Click the Output selector — second of the three buttons in the middle of
the channel strip — and set it to the output you want to send the signal.
Inserting inserts
Inserts are effects that you can place into a track’s signal to alter its sound.
For example, inserting a compressor lets you control the dynamic range of
your track and inserting a delay can add an echo effect to your instrument.
You can have up to five inserts in each track in Pro Tools. You can use either
hardware or software (plug-in) effects in these inserts.
The signal passes through the effects in the order — from top to bottom —
in which they appear in the Insert section of your track’s channel strip. For
example, in Figure 2-5, the signal goes through the compressor before it goes
through the reverb. To change the order of your insert, simply click and drag
it up or down the list.
Figure 2-5:

516
To insert an effect into a track’s channel strip, follow these steps:
1. Enable the Insert view in the Mix window by choosing Display➪Mix
Window Shows➪Inserts from the main menu. 
The Insert section of the Mix window appears at the top of your track’s
channel strip.
2. Click an entry in the Insert section to open the pop-up menu.
3. Select a plug-in to insert (or the hardware output/input you want if
you’re using an external effect). 
If you choose a plug-in, the plug-in window opens. (See the “Playing with
Plug-ins” section, later in this chapter, for more information.)
Turning off the effect
There are three ways to turn off the effect in an insert:
✦Remove the insert: To remove the insert from the track, choose No
Insert from the Insert pop-up menu. (Click-hold over the arrows located
to the left of the Insert name to access the menu.) This removes the
insert from the track and moves any inserts below it up the line.
✦Bypass the effect: Do this by engaging the Bypass button in the plug-in
window. To open this window, click the Insert name in the Insert section of
the track’s channel strip. This keeps the effect in-line but turns it off. The
effect still draws processing power even though you don’t hear it.
✦Make the insert inactive: Do this by pressing Ctrl+Start/Windows (on a
PC) or Command+Ctrl (on a Mac) as you click the plug-in’s name in the
Insert section of the channel strip. Doing so removes the effect from the
signal chain but not from the Insert section. This frees up processing
resources and allows you to turn on the insert at any time. (You simply
repeat the keystrokes-and-click you used to turn it off.)
Setting up sends
You can send the signal from your track to another bus for processing. Pro
Tools lets you have up to five such sends per audio or auxiliary track. Sends
are useful for two major purposes:
✦Applying effects to more than one track, which you can do internally
(using a plug-in) or externally (using a hardware device). 
✦Creating submixes that combine several tracks into one or two tracks.

Book VI
Chapter 2
Setting Up Your Mix

517
You can choose to send the signal pre- or post-fader, which means the signal
going to the send is either sent before or after it travels through the track’s
fader. The Pre- or Post-Fader options, along with the Send Level, Panning,
and Mute options, are accessed through the Send window, shown in Figure
2-6. You access this window by clicking the Send name in the Send section of
the track’s channel strip. If the Send section isn’t visible in the track’s chan-
nels strip, enable the Send view in the Mix window by selecting Display➪
Mix Window Shows➪Sends from the main menu.
To assign a send, follow these steps:
1. Enable the Send view in the Mix window by selecting Display➪
Mix Window Shows➪Sends from the main menu. 
The track channel strips expand to include the Sends section, located
between the Inserts and I/O sections of the channel strip.
2. Click one of the entries in the Send section to open the entry’s pop-up
menu.
3. Select the bus or hardware output/input to which you want to send
the signal.
The Send window opens.

4. In the Send window, select Pre- or Post-Fader. 
Selecting Pre-Fader sends the signal from your track before the fader
control for that track and selecting Post-Fader sends the signal after it
passes through the channel’s fader.
5. While still in the Send window, adjust your level, panning, and mute
settings.
To assign an effect to this sent signal, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪New Track from the main menu.
The New Track dialog box appears.
2. Use the drop-down menus to enter the number of tracks you want, the
type (in this case choose Auxiliary Input), and whether you want your
tracks(s) in stereo.
3. Click Create.
The auxiliary input appears in your session.
4. Assign the input for this auxiliary track to the bus that you chose for
your send destination in the previous list.
5. Follow the steps for inserting an effect into a track (see “Inserting
inserts,” earlier in this chapter).
Viewing sends
You can view your sends, send controls, and send assignments by opening
the following windows in your session:
✦Send A-E views: You can see the controls for a send in the track’s channels
strip by choosing Display➪Send View Shows➪A-E from the main menu,
where A-E represents a listing of the sends you have available to work with.
✦Send View Level Meters: If you want to add to the basic Send view (see
previous bullet) to include level meters for the Send signal, select Show
Meters in Sends View in the Display tab of the Preferences dialog box.
(Choose Setups➪Preferences from the main menu to access this dialog
box.) 
✦Send Assignments: You can show Send assignments for your tracks by
choosing Display➪Sends View Shows➪Assignments from the main
menu. This lets you see the names of the sends assigned to a track.
✦Send Output Window: You can open a window that contains all the Send
settings in a large format by clicking the name of the Send in the Send sec-
tion of the track’s channels strip. This Send Output window is explained
further in the section “Accessing Output Windows,” later in this chapter.

519
✦Send Names: As one more way to stay organized, you can name the desti-
nation buses for your sends. Do so by choosing Setups➪I/O Setup from
the main menu and then choosing the Bus tab of the I/O Setup dialog box.
After you get the Bus tab up, double-click the name of one of the buses
(to highlight it) and then type in its new name, as shown in Figure 2-7.
Turning off the effect
There are three ways to turn off the effect in a send:
✦Remove the Send: To remove the send from the track, choose No Send
from the Send pop-up menu. (Click-hold over one the arrows in the Send
section of a track’s channel strip to open the pop-up menu.) This removes
the send from the track and moves any other sends below it up the line.
✦Bypass the effect: Do this by engaging the Bypass button in the plug-in
window. This keeps the effect in-line but turns it off. The effect still draws
processing power even though you don’t hear it. To open the plug-in
window, click the name of the plug-in in the track that this plug-in is
inserted into. The Bypass button is located at the top of the window.
Figure 2-7:

Accessing Output Windows
520
✦Make the send inactive: Do this by pressing Ctrl+Start/Windows (on a
Windows PC) or Command+Ctrl (on a Mac) while you click the send bus’s
name in the Sends list. Doing so removes the effect from the signal chain
but not from the Sends list. Making a send inactive frees up processing
resources, but you can still turn on the send at any time. (Simply repeat
the keystrokes-and-click you used to turn it off.)
Using sends for groups
Controlling the send level and mute for sends across an entire group can be
an enormous help, because it allows you to use one set of controls for all the
tracks in a group. To control sends for a group, do the following:
1. Choose Setups➪Preferences from the main menu.
The Preferences dialog box appears. 
2. Choose the Automation tab of the Preferences dialog box.
3. Check the Enable Send Level Follows Groups option and/or the Send
Mute Follows Groups option.
This sets it up so that the following happens:
• If you select Enable Send Level Follows Groups, any send level change
you make on one track in the group affects all the tracks in a group.
• If you select Send Mute Follows Groups, any send mutes that you
create on one track in the group affect all the tracks in a group.
For more on group sends, see Book 6, Chapter 6.
4. Click Done.
Accessing Output Windows
Outputs windows are floating sections of either the channel strip or the send
settings. These windows allow you to adjust Output controls without having
to search for them in the Mix window. This section details the Send and the
Track Output windows.
Tackling Track Output windows
Track Output windows contain Fader, Pan, Automation, Output Selector, Solo,
and Mute controls, as shown in Figure 2-8.
To open a Track Output window, just click the Output Window button in the
track’s channel strip in the Mix window, as shown in Figure 2-9.

The track output window includes the following controls:
✦Close: Clicking this button closes the window.
✦Path Meter View Box: When you click this button (the last button to the
right at the top of the window), another window opens, showing the
meters for the output path you selected in the Path Selector box. (See
the appropriate bullet item later in this list.)
✦Tracks Selector: This box lets you choose the track that shows in this
window. You can choose from any track (audio, auxiliary input, or master
fader) in your session.
✦Output Selector: From this box, you can choose from among the outputs
(whether track or send) in your system.
✦Path Selector: This button lets you choose the output path for the current
track.
✦Automation Safe: Clicking this button puts the track in Automation Safe
mode where no new automation data can be written. (Book 6, Chapter 6
has more on automation data.)
✦Target: Engaging this button keeps this track’s window open if you click
another Track or Send Output window. With the Target button disengaged
(the button will be red), whenever you open a send in the Output Selector
box (see bullet earlier in this section) or another track’s Output Window
button, the current track will be replaced by the new Track or Send
Output window.
✦Inverse Pan: For stereo tracks, this button ensures that when you move
one of the pan controls (left or right) the other moves to exactly the oppo-

Setting up the Send Output window
The Send Output window, shown in Figure 2-10, shows the same basic infor-
mation as the Track Output window (refer to Figure 2-8), with two exceptions: 
✦Send Selector: Instead of viewing and selecting the output for the track
(Output selector), you can choose any of the five sends for the track.
✦Pre/post button: This button controls whether the send is located before
(pre-) or after (post-) the track’s fader control. This is the button marked
“Pre” located just below the name of the track that feeds this send. Engag-
ing this button sends the signal before the fader (pre-fader) and leaving
the button untouched sends the signal after the fader (post-fader).
To open a Send Output window, just click the Send name in the track’s Send
list in the Mix window.

Playing with Plug-ins
Whenever you want to process your tracks in Pro Tools — add EQ, effects,
or dynamics processors — you use a plug-in. Plug-ins are audio-processing
tools that change the sound of your original file. Some plug-ins permanently
alter the original file and work offline (that is, processing happens without
playing the session). This is the case with pitch-shifting, for example. Other
plug-ins — reverb, for example — affect the audio file without permanently
changing it, processing the audio in real time as the session plays.
These two types of audio processing — offline and real-time — are some of
the more-powerful mixing tools available to you in Pro Tools. With them you
can EQ your tracks and add compression, reverb, delay — and a myriad of
other enhancements — to your music. Your only limitations are the plug-ins
you have at your disposal and the processing power of your computer. This
section introduces you to the two types of plug-ins — AudioSuite and RTAS
(Real Time Audio Suite) — and then shows you how to route your system so
you can use them effectively.
Real Time Audio Suite (RTAS)
RTAS plug-ins process your audio as your session plays, allowing you to
make adjustments on the fly and be able to hear these changes immediately.
This is handy for adding compression, delay, and reverb, for example. The
drawback to this is that anytime you process as your session plays, you’re
using up more of your computer-processing power — sometimes a lot more,
as in the case of reverb. This section lays out the basics of using RTAS plug-
ins (see Book 6, Chapters 3 through 5 for more detailed information).
Routing your RTAS plug-ins
RTAS plug-ins are like the effects processors that you plug into your mixer.
The sound from your tracks are sent to these effects and routed back
through the mixer so you can hear the affected sound.
There are two ways to place these effects in your mixer within Pro Tools: by
using inserts or by using sends and returns. (Check out the previous section,
“Rounding out Your Routing,” for more on inserts and sends.)
✦Inserts: Inserting a plug-in basically involves putting the effect inline
with the audio as it travels through the channel strip in your mixer. This
means all the sound from the audio file passes through the effect on its
way out of the mixer (and to your ears).
When you insert a plug-in, you can choose from three formats:
• Mono in/mono out: One channel goes in and one comes out of the
effect.

Book VI
Chapter 2
Setting Up Your Mix
Playing with Plug-ins
525
• Mono in/stereo out: One channel goes in and two come out.
• Stereo in/stereo out: Two channels go in and two channels come out.
✦Sends. Using a send for your effects lets you route a portion of your
track’s signal that you can then control with the Send level. These sends
are routed to an auxiliary track, into which the effect is inserted. Thus
you can route more than one track to a single effect.
Understanding the RTAS Plug-In window
When you select a plug-in (or click its name in the Inserts section of a track’s
channel strip), a window opens, displaying all the controls for the plug-in (as
shown in Figure 2-11). Most plug-ins usually have controls similar to what
you see in the following list: 
✦Track Selector: This control lets you choose to view the plug-ins for any
of the tracks in your session (except MIDI). Selecting a track without a
plug-in shows no insert.
✦Insert Selector: Allows you to choose from the five inserts for the track
you have selected.
✦Plug-In Selector: This menu lets you select from any RTAS plug-in that’s
located in your Plug-Ins folder — the one located within the Pro Tools
folder on your hard drive. 
✦Bypass Button: This button (surprise, surprise) bypasses the effect,
allowing you to quickly and easily compare the affected and unaffected
sounds. A bypassed effect shows as blue in the Mix and Edit windows. If
you bypass some, but not all, of a multimono effect, the effect shows as
purple in the Mix and Edit windows. This makes it easy for you to see
whether one of your effects is bypassed without having to open all your
Plug-In windows.

✦Settings menu: Click-holding on the arrows at the left side of the plug-in
window accesses the Settings pop-up menu, shown in Figure 2-12, which
lets you save, copy, paste, import, delete, and lock your plug-ins’ set-
tings, as well as set plug-in preferences (such as where to store these
settings).
✦Librarian menu: This drop-down menu lets you choose from plug-in set-
tings that you may already have stored. This menu is activated by click-
holding on the setting name (labeled Factory Default in figure 2-11) next
to the arrows for the Settings pop-up menu.
✦Compare button: This button lets you toggle back and forth between
your current and your previous setting.
✦Automation Enable button: Clicking this button opens the Plug-In Auto-
mation dialog box, which allows you to set automation for your selected
plug-in parameters. (Book 6, Chapter 6 has more on automation.)
✦Automation Safe button: Engaging this button keeps any written auto-
mation data from being overwritten.
✦Target button: Depressing this button keeps the current Plug-In window
open when you open another plug-in. With this button off, clicking the
plug-in name in a track’s insert replaces the open window with a new
window.
✦Phase Invert button: This button (not available on all plug-ins) allows
you to reverse the phase of the audio passing through the plug-in. This
means flipping the waveform top to bottom.
Working with RTAS plug-ins
Chances are that you’ll spend quite a bit of time using plug-ins. Unless you
have a control surface, you’ll probably end up spending more time than nec-
essary just mouse-jockeying the controls. In this section, I offer some short-
cuts to make working with plug-ins quicker and easier.

AudioSuite
Pro Tools comes with a variety of offline plug-ins — that is, effects that you
can use to process your tracks so that you end up either altering the original
audio file or creating a new one. These types of plug-ins are listed under
AudioSuite in the main menu. Figure 2-13 shows the plug-ins that come with
Pro Tools LE.

Understanding the Plug-In window
When you select a plug-in from the AudioSuite menu, a window opens, con-
taining all the controls for the plug-in, as shown in Figure 2-14. You’re going
to find the same kinds of controls for nearly all the plug-ins. They include the
following:
✦Plug-in Selector: This menu lets you select from any AudioSuite plug-in
listed in the AudioSuite menu.
✦Selection Reference: This menu lets you choose which regions are
processed. By default, when you select a region in the track, in the
playlist, or in the Audio Regions list, all occurrences of the selected
region are processed. You can limit the processing to either the
track/playlist or the Audio Regions list by selecting from the pop-up
menu. Your choices are
• Playlist: If you choose Playlist, only regions that are currently
selected in tracks or playlists in the Edit window are processed. 
• Region List: If you choose this option, only regions currently
selected in the Audio Regions list are processed.

✦Use in Playlist button: This button lets you choose whether your chosen
processing happens to all instances of your selected regions throughout
the session, or whether processing happens only to those you have
selected. The settings are as follows:
• Off: When this button is disabled, your processed audio is added to
the Audio Regions list but not put into the session.
• On: When this button is enabled, the processed audio is placed in
the playlist according to the Selection reference you have chosen.
(See the previous bullet item.) If you have Region List selected, all
copies of the region are replaced within the session. If you selected
Playlist, only the regions that you selected in the tracks are replaced.
✦File Mode Selector: This menu allows you to choose how your audio is
processed. You have three options:
• Overwrite Files: This option destructively overwrites your original
file. Not all plug-ins have this option.
• Create Individual Files: This option creates a new audio file for each
region processed. These regions appear in the Audio Regions list.
• Create Continuous File: Choosing this option processes the selected
region as a single audio file. This option isn’t available when you
have Region List chosen as you Selection reference. (See the earlier
bullet item in this list).
✦Process Mode Selector: This menu appears if you have a selection that
includes more than one region. With it, you can select whether process-
ing is done region by region or whether it affects the entire selection.
✦Settings menu: This drop-down menu lets you save, copy, paste, import,
delete, and lock your plug-ins settings as well as set plug-in preferences
(such as where to store these settings). 2-12 shows this menu.
✦Librarian menu: This pop-up menu lets you choose from plug-in settings
that you may already have stored.
✦Compare button: This button lets you compare the unprocessed sound
to the processed sound.
✦Preview button: Pressing this button lets you preview the audio before
you commit to processing it.
✦Bypass button: This button bypasses the effect, allowing you to quickly
and easily compare the affected and unaffected sounds. (This button
only applies to the Preview feature and doesn’t change the processing of
the file.)
✦Process: Clicking this button processes the region(s) you have selected
according to the rest of the settings in this window.

Processing with External Effects
530
Using AudioSuite Plug-ins
You can use the AudioSuite plug-ins to process any part — or all — of an audio
region. If you choose part of a region, that region is split so the selected part
becomes its own region.
To use an AudioSuite plug-in, follow these steps:
1. Using the Selector tool, select the region or regions (click-drag across
them) in the Edit window you want to process. 
Book 4, Chapter 2 details this process. 
When you process audio using the Reverb or Delay plug-ins, make sure your
selection includes extra room at the end of your material to include the
actual reverb and delay; otherwise, the sound will be cut off.
2. Select the plug-in from the AudioSuite menu.
The Plug-In window appears.
3. Click Preview to hear your selected material.
4. Adjust the plug-in controls until you get the sound and processing set-
tings you want.
The previous section spells out what these settings are for.
5. Click the Process button.
Pro Tools processes your audio.
Be aware that the processing can take some time and always demands some
computer resources. 
Processing with External Effects
You can connect external effects devices (such as a reverb or compressor),
to Pro Tools and easily route your sends or inserts to them. The advantage
of using an external device (with its own dedicated source of processing
power) is that you can reduce demand for your system’s resources. The dis-
advantage is that going out and back into Pro Tools takes at least some time;
you get a delay (also known as latency) in the returned signal, especially if
you’re using the analog connection in your Digidesign interface. This latency
isn’t much of a problem with reverbs, since often a pre-delay on the effect is
desirable anyway, but it can be a real issue if you use an analog compressor.
(Book 6 Chapter 5 talks about pre-delay on reverb.)

Book VI
Chapter 2
Setting Up Your Mix
Processing with External Effects
531
The best way to eliminate the latency inherent in routing to an external
analog device is to record your effect to a new track and then shift the new
region in that track over so it synchronizes with the source track for that
instrument (Book 4, Chapter 3 explains the process of shifting regions.)
Using an external effects device requires three simple steps: creating a hard-
ware insert, connecting the device to your interface, and assigning the insert
in your track. How to go about that? Glad you asked . . . 
Creating a hardware insert
Before you can route your track’s insert to an external device, you need to
create a hardware insert — an insert in a track that routes your signal to one
of the hardware inputs and outputs of your Digidesign interface. Follow
these steps:
1. Choose Setups➪I/O Setup from the main menu.
The I/O Setup dialog box appears.
2. Choose the Insert tab on the I/O Setup dialog box.
3. Choose one of the insert paths listed (or choose Default if none are
listed); double-click that path to create a new name for it. 
The insert becomes highlighted.
4. Type in a new name for the insert.
5. Select the proper format for the insert path (mono or stereo).
Connecting your external device
You can connect either an analog or digital device as your hardware insert.
This section describes connecting both devices.
Connecting an analog device
Nothing much to it, really. Just do the following:
1. Select the output and input (or pairs for stereo) that correspond to the
inserts you created in the previous section.
2. Connect the output of your Digidesign interface to the input of your
external device.
3. Connect the output of your external device to the selected input in
your Digidesign interface.

Processing with External Effects
532
Connecting a digital device
Whoa, here comes the high-tech stuff, right? Nah. It’s a bit more involved, but
it’s still not brain surgery:
1. Connect your external device to your Digidesign interface using the
digital connections on the back of your device. 
Depending on your device, you either use an optical connection or a
coaxial S/PDIF connection (Book 1, Chapter 2 has more about these
types of connections). Connect the output of your Digidesign interface
to the input of your external device and the Output of your external
device to the input of your Digidesign interface.
2. Choose Setups➪Hardware Setup from the main menu. 
The Hardware Setup dialog box opens.
3. Click your Digidesign interface in the Peripheral section of the
window to select your Digidesign interface. 
If you only have one Digidesign interface connected to your computer, it
is automatically highlighted.
4. Perform one of the following in the Digital Input section of the
Hardware Setup dialog box:
• To connect through the optical ports, choose S/PDIF from the Optical
Format drop-down menu.
• To connect through the coaxial (RCA) S/PDIF jack.
5. Choose your clock source — the digital clock that controls your
system — from the Clock Source pop-up menu.
• If you want the effect device to be your clock source select External.
• If you want Pro Tools to be the clock source (or if you don’t know
what a clock source is) select Internal.
Check out the Pro Tools Reference manual for more on clock sources.
6. Set your external device to the appropriate clock source — Internal if
you selected External in Pro Tools, and External if you selected
Internal in Pro Tools. 
Your owner’s manual should describe this process.
7. Click OK.

Routing your track
To route your track’s insert to the hardware insert connected to your effects
device, select the hardware insert from the Insert Pop-up menu, accessed by
click-holding over one of the arrows in the Insert section of your track’s
channel strip.
You’re now ready to dig in and use your external effect processor on your
Pro Tools tracks. 
The only disadvantage with using external effects in Pro Tools is that you
can’t save the effect settings with your Pro tools session like you can with an
RTAS plug-in. In order to get around this deficit, I usually type the effect patch
(setting number) I use for a track in the Comments section of the track. To
enter this information, double-click on the track’s name in either the Edit or
Mix window to call up the Name Track dialog box. Then enter your effect
patch and any other reminders you need in the Comments section and click
OK to save your comments and close the window.

Chapter 3: Using Equalization
In This Chapter

E
qualization (EQ) is the process of changing the frequency response of
the data in the session’s track to make the track sound the way you
want. The main goal when EQing during the mix process is to get the instru-
ments in your song to smoothly blend together.
In this chapter, you discover the types of equalizers used in Pro Tools and
you walk through the process of applying EQ to your tracks. This chapter
also offers some basic EQ settings for a variety of instruments to get you
started EQing your songs.
Exploring Equalization
The most useful tool you have for mixing is equalization (EQ). You use equal-
izers to adjust the various frequencies of your instruments so that there’s
enough room for each of them in your stereo tracks. Pro Tools offers three
types of equalizers — parametric, low-shelf/high-shelf, and low-pass/high-pass.
I outline these types of EQ in the following sections.
Parametric
The parametric equalizer (called a Peak EQ in Pro Tools and designated
by the icon shown here in the margin) allows you to choose the fre-
quency that you want to change as well as the range of frequencies
around that frequency. With a parametric EQ, you dial in the frequency
that you want to change and then set the range itself (referred to as
the Q) that you want to affect.
The Q is a number that signifies the range of frequencies that the EQ affects —
usually between 1⁄2 and 2 octaves. Pro Tools offers settings from .33 to 12, with
the lower numbers allowing larger ranges of frequencies to be EQed.

Dialing in EQ
536
You choose your Q setting based on what you hear in the mix. Just as you
can experiment with different frequencies to adjust in the mix, you can also
try different Q settings to find the best-possible frequency range to use.
The beauty of a parametric EQ is that you can take a small band (range) of fre-
quencies and boost (increase) or cut (decrease) them. This capability enables
you to get the various instruments in a mix to fit in with one another. (This
technique is called carving out frequencies.) When you’re mixing, the paramet-
ric EQ is the most useful equalizer because you can adjust the frequency
response of each instrument so that the other instruments can be heard clearly
in the mix. The only downside to parametric EQs is that they need processing
power to run. If you have a lot of EQing to do, you may end up stressing your
system pretty hard. (Yet another reason to have a powerful computer.)
Low-shelf/high-shelf
A shelf equalizer affects a range of frequencies above (high-shelf) or below
(low-shelf) the target frequency. Shelf EQs are generally used to roll off the
top or bottom end of the frequency spectrum. For example, you can set a
low-shelf EQ to roll off the frequencies below 250 hertz (Hz), which reduces
the amount of rumble (low-frequency noise) in a recording. You generally
use the shelf EQ to adjust the lowest and highest frequencies and the para-
metric EQ to adjust any in-between frequencies when you mix.
In Pro Tools, the low- and high-shelf EQs are designated with the icons seen
here in the margin. 
Low-pass/high-pass
Believe it or not, sometimes your track just sounds better if you eliminate a
few carefully chosen frequencies. You just need to know which ones to
target. That’s where a couple of Pro Tools capabilities can help with the
needed audio acrobatics: low-pass (ducking the high frequencies you don’t
want) and high-pass (jumping over the low frequencies you don’t want).
This type of EQ is actually called a filter — it filters out frequencies either
higher (low-pass) or lower (high-pass) than the target frequency. The high-pass
filter is useful for getting rid of unwanted low frequencies, and the low-pass
filter is used for eliminating unwanted high frequencies. In Pro Tools, the low-
and high-pass filters are designated with the icons seen here in the margin.
Dialing in EQ
Before you start EQing your tracks, you need to know how to insert the EQ
plug-in in a track and how to actually make those adjustments with one of
the EQ plug-ins in Pro Tools. This section details these procedures.

Book VI
Chapter 3
Using Equalization

537
Inserting an EQ plug-in in a track
To EQ a track, you first need to insert the Pro Tools AudioSuite plug-in in the
track. To do so, the follow these steps:
1. Choose Display➪Mix Window Shows➪Inserts from the main menu to
make sure that the Inserts section is showing in the Mix window.
2. Click the top arrow on the left side of the Inserts section of the track’s
channels strip.
The Inserts pop-up menu appears, as shown in Figure 3-1.
3. Select either the Multi-Channel Plug-In or Multi-Mono Plug-In option to
fit the type of track you have.
If your track is stereo, use Multi-Channel; if it’s mono, use Multi-Mono.
4. Select either the 1-Band EQ II or 4-Band EQ II option.
Your chosen EQ plug-in window opens. (The 1-Band EQ II option lets you
set one EQ parameter, whereas the 4-Band EQ II option lets you work
with four parameters. For more on which option would work best for
you, check out the following section.)
5. Adjust the parameters that you want to EQ.
You can find the particulars for each kind of EQ — parametric, low-shelf/
high-shelf, and low-pass/high-pass — later in the chapter.
If you want to EQ a bunch of tracks at the same time and use the same set-
tings (submixes, for example), you can do this the following way:
1. Select one of the buses from the Output selector in each track that you
want to submix.
2. Choose File➪New Track from the main menu.
The New Track dialog box appears.
3. Use the drop-down menus to enter the number of tracks that you want
(1) the type (Auxiliary Input) and whether you want your track in stereo.
Figure 3-1:

Inserts pop-
up menu and

4. Use your new track’s Input selector to select the bus that you used for
the output of the submix tracks as the input for this auxiliary track.
5. Insert one of the EQ plug-ins from the Insert pop-up menu in this aux-
iliary track.
The EQ plug-in window opens.
6. Adjust the EQ settings to get the sound that you want.
You can find the particulars for each kind of EQ — parametric, low-shelf/
high-shelf, and low-pass/high-pass — later in the chapter.
Perusing Pro Tools EQ options
Using an EQ in Pro Tools consists of selecting one of the plug-ins, inserting it
in the track that you want to affect, and setting your parameters. Pro Tools
comes with two basic EQs: 1-band EQ and 4-band EQ. (They’re part of the
RTAS set of tools.)
You can also use any RTAS-type EQ plug-in, but these have to be purchased
separately. If you do an Internet search with the keyword RTAS plug-ins, you’re
sure to find tons to choose from. (For you enquiring minds out there, RTAS
stands for Real Time Audio Suite — the plug-in format that Pro Tools uses.)
1-band EQ
The 1-band EQ plug-in for Pro Tools, shown in Figure 3-2, lets you apply one
EQ filter to a track. This EQ is useful if you just want to adjust one parameter.
You can choose any of the three types of EQs — parametric, low-shelf/high-
shelf, and low-pass/high-pass — by clicking the appropriate button to engage
your chosen EQ.
4-band EQ
The four-band EQ in Pro Tools, shown in Figure 3-3, lets you adjust up to four
EQ filters to a track. This type of EQ is useful when you have to do some
major EQing to a track. You can choose from a low-shelf, high-shelf, and two
parametric (Peak) EQs.
In the 4-Band EQ plug-in window, the high shelf is located at the top of the
window and the low shelf at the bottom. The two parametric EQs are located
between the two shelf EQs.

Using parametric EQ
To use the parametric EQ, click the Peak EQ button in whatever EQ plug-
in window — 1-band or 4-band, for example — you have open. You have
three settings to adjust:
✦Gain: This is the amount of boost (increase) or cut (decrease) that you
apply to the signal. You can either type in the amount in the box next to
the Peak EQ button or use the slider to the right.
✦Freq: This is the frequency that the EQ centers around. You select the
range of frequencies above and below this point by using the Q setting
(see next bullet). You can either type in the frequency on the box or you
can use the slider to make your adjustment.
✦Q: This is the range of frequencies that your EQ will affect. The higher
the number, the narrower the range that gets EQed. You adjust this set-
ting either by moving the slider or by clicking in the box and typing a
value between .33 and 12.
Using low-shelf/high-shelf EQ
To use low-shelf/high-shelf EQ, click the Low Shelf and High Shelf buttons in
the EQ plug-in window. When you use low-shelf/high-shelf EQ, you have two
parameters to adjust: 
✦Gain: This is the amount of boost or cut that you apply to the signal.
You can either type in the amount in the box next to the shelf button or
use the slider to the right.
✦Freq: This is the frequency that the shelf starts at. You can either type in
the frequency in the box or use the slider to make your adjustment.
Using low-pass/high-pass EQ
Here’s where you tell Pro Tools which frequencies to avoid in the course of
adjusting the EQ. The low- and high-pass buttons appear in the margin.
To use the low- or high-pass filter, click the appropriate button in the EQ
window. The only option to set is Freq, which is the frequency that the filter
engages. Any frequency below (high-pass) or above (low-pass) the setting is
removed from the track. You can either type the frequency in the box or use
the slider to make your adjustment.
Equalizing Your Tracks
Only so many frequencies are available for all the instruments in a mix. If
more than one instrument occupies a particular frequency range, they can
get in each other’s way and muddy the mix. Your goals when EQing during

Book VI

the mixing process are to reduce the frequencies that add clutter and/or to
enhance the frequencies that define an instrument’s sound. To do this, make
a little space for each instrument within the same general frequency range,
which you can accomplish by EQing the individual tracks as you mix. The
first part of this chapter shows you how to get up to the point of doing some
EQing. The rest of the chapter gets your hands dirty with some real EQing
experience.
Here’s a good trick to use when initially trying to decide which frequencies
to boost or cut: First, solo the track(s) that you’re working on and set your
parametric EQ to a narrow Q setting (a high number). Next, turn the boost
all the way up (move the Gain slider all the way to the right) and sweep the
frequency setting as you listen (to sweep, just move the Freq slider to the
left and right). Noticing the areas where the annoying or pleasing sounds are
located can help you better understand the frequencies that your instru-
ment produces. When you find a frequency to adjust, experiment with the Q
setting to find the range that produces the best sound, and then adjust the
amount of boost or cut until it has the effect that you want.
After you determine the frequencies that you want to work with, do your
EQing to the individual track while the instrument is in the mix (not soloed).
You want to make the instrument fit as well as possible with the rest of the
instruments, and to do this you need to know how your instrument sounds
in relation to all the music going on around it.
Your goal when making adjustments in EQ is to make all the tracks blend
together as well as possible. In some instances, you may have to make some
radical EQ moves. Don’t be afraid to do whatever it takes to make your mix
sound good — even if it means having cuts or boosts as great as 12dB.
General guidelines
Although some instruments do call for specific EQ guidelines, you need to
think about some general considerations when EQing, regardless of the instru-
ment involved. When it comes to the audible frequency spectrum (which is
about 20 Hz to 20 kHz), certain frequencies have special characteristics:
✦Frequencies below 100 Hz can either warm up an instrument or can add
boominess to it.
✦Frequencies between 100 and 200 Hz can be muddy for some instruments
and can add fullness to others.
✦Frequencies around 400 Hz can sound boxy.
✦Frequencies around 800 Hz can add depth or body.
✦1-kHz to 2-kHz frequencies can add attack (initial signal) or punch (pro-
nounced attack) to some instruments and can create a nasally sound in
others.

Equalizing Your Tracks
542
✦2 kHz to 5 kHz can increase the presence of instruments.
✦5-kHz to 8-kHz frequencies can sound harsh on some instruments.
✦Frequencies from 8 kHz to 17 kHz add airiness or brightness to an 
instrument.
You’re generally better off cutting a frequency than boosting one. This belief
goes back to the days of analog EQs, which often added noise when boosting a
signal. This can still be a factor with some digital EQs, but the issue is much
less. Out of habit, I still try to cut frequencies before I boost them, and I recom-
mend that you do the same (not out of habit, of course, but because if a noise
difference exists between cutting and boosting, you may as well avoid it).
The exact frequencies that you end up cutting or boosting depend on three
factors: the sound you’re after, the tonal characteristic of the instrument,
and the relationship between all the instruments in the song. In the following
sections, I list a variety of frequencies to cut or boost for each instrument. If
you don’t want to follow all the suggestions, choose only the ones that fit
with your goals.
The Parametric EQ is the type of EQ you use most when trying to get your
tracks to fit together. This EQ gives you the greatest control over the range
of frequencies you can adjust. The other EQ types (high-shelf, low-shelf,
high-pass, low-pass) can often be used successfully for the top or bottom fre-
quencies listed in the sections that follow. 
To adjust frequencies using Pro Tool’s EQ plug-ins, use the Frequency slider
to choose the frequency you want to EQ and the Gain slider to control the
amount of EQ that you boost (move the slider to the right) or cut (move the
slider to the left) from your track.
Vocals
For the majority of popular music, the vocals are the most important instru-
ment in the song. You need to hear them clearly, and they should contain the
character of the singer’s voice and style. One of the most common mistakes
in mixing vocals is to make them too loud. The next most common mistake is
to make them too quiet. (The second mistake most often occurs when a shy
or self-conscious vocalist is doing the mixing.) You want the lead vocals to
shine through, but you don’t want them to overpower the other instruments.
The best way to do this is to EQ the vocal tracks so they can sit nicely in the
mix and still be heard clearly. The following guidelines can help you do this.
Lead
The lead vocal can go a lot of ways, depending on the singer and the style of
music. For the most part, I tend to cut a little around 200 Hz and add a
couple dBs at 3 kHz and again at 10 kHz. In general, follow these guidelines:

Book VI
Chapter 3
Using Equalization
Equalizing Your Tracks
543
✦To add fullness, add a few dBs at 150 Hz.
✦To get rid of muddiness, cut a few dBs at 200 to 250 Hz.
✦To add clarity, boost a little at 3 kHz.
✦For more presence, add at 5 kHz.
✦To add air or to brighten, boost at 10 kHz.
✦To get rid of sibilance, cut a little between 7.5 to 10 kHz.
Backup
To keep backup vocals from competing with lead vocals, cut the backup
vocals a little in the low end (below 250 Hz) and at the 2.5-to-3.5-kHz range.
To add clarity, boost a little around 10 kHz without letting it get in the way of
the lead vocal.
Guitar
For the most part, you want to avoid getting a muddy guitar sound and make
sure that the guitar attack comes through in the mix.
Electric
Electric guitars often need a little cutting below 100 Hz to get rid of muddiness.
A boost between 120 and 250 Hz adds warmth. A boost in the 2.5-to-4-kHz range
brings out the attack of the guitar, and a boost at 5 kHz can add some bite.
Acoustic
Acoustic guitars often do well with a little cut below 80 Hz and again around
800 Hz to 1 kHz. If you want a warmer tone and more body, try boosting a
little around 150 to 250 Hz. Also, try adding a few dBs around 3 to 5 kHz if
you want more attack or punch. A few dBs added at 7 kHz can add a little
more brightness to the instrument.
Bass
This instrument can get muddy pretty fast. The mud generally happens in
the 200 to 300 Hz range, so I either leave that alone or cut just a little if the
bass lacks definition. I rarely add any frequencies below 100 Hz. If the instru-
ment sounds flat or thin, I boost some between 100 and 200 Hz. Adding a
little between 500 Hz and 1 kHz can increase the punch, and a boost between
2.5 and 5 kHz accentuates the attack, adding a little brightness to the bass.
One of the most important things to keep in mind with the bass guitar is to
make sure that it and the kick drum can both be heard. You need to adjust
the frequencies of these two instruments to make room for both. If you add a
frequency to the kick drum, try cutting the same frequency from the bass.

Equalizing Your Tracks
544
Drums
The guidelines for EQing the drums depend on whether you use live acoustic
drums or a drum machine. (The drum machine probably requires less EQ
because the sounds were already EQed when they were created.) The type
and placement of your mic or mics also affect how you EQ the drums. (You
can find out more about mic placement in Book 3, Chapter 2.)
Kick
You want the kick drum to blend with the bass guitar. To do this, reduce the
frequencies that the bass guitar takes up. For example, if I boost a few dB
between 100 and 200 Hz for the bass guitar, I generally cut them in the kick
drum (and maybe go as high as 250 Hz). To bring out the bottom end of the
kick drum, I sometimes add a couple of dBs between 80 and 100 Hz. The kick
drum can get boxy sounding (you know, like a cardboard box), so I often cut
a little between 400 and 600 Hz to get rid of the boxiness. To bring out the
click from the beater hitting the head, try adding a little between 2.5 and 5
kHz. This increases the attack of the drum and gives it more presence.
Snare
The snare drum drives the music, making it the most important drum in popu-
lar music. As such, it needs to really cut through the rest of the instruments.
Although the adjustments that you make depend on the pitch and size of the
drum and whether you used one mic or two during recording, you can usually
boost a little at 100 to 150 Hz for added warmth. You can also try boosting at
250 Hz to add some depth. If the drum sounds too boxy, try cutting at 800 Hz
to 1 kHz. A little boost at around 3 to 5 kHz increases the attack, and an
increase in the 8 to 10 kHz range can add crispness to the drum.
If you used two mics during recording, you might consider dropping a few
dBs on the top mic in both the 800 Hz to 1 kHz range and the 8 to 10 kHz
range. Allow the bottom mic to create the crispness. I generally use a shelf
EQ to roll off the bottom end of the bottom mic below, say, 250 to 300 Hz.
Depending on the music (R&B and pop, for instance), I may use a shelf EQ to
add a little sizzle to the bottom mic by boosting frequencies above 10 kHz.
For many recording engineers and producers, the snare-drum sound is
almost a signature. If you listen to different artists’ songs from the same pro-
ducer, you’ll likely hear similarities in the songs’ snare-drum sound. Don’t be
afraid to take your time getting the snare drum to sound just right. After all,
if you become a famous producer, you’ll want people to recognize your dis-
tinct snare-drum sound. And you want it to sound good anyway.

Tom-toms
Tom-toms come in a large range of sizes and pitches. For mounted toms, you
can boost a little around 200 to 250 Hz to add depth to the drum. A boost in the
3 to 5 kHz range can add more of the sticks’ attack, and for some additional
presence, try adding a little in the 5 to 8 kHz range. If the drums sound too
boxy, try cutting a little in the 600-Hz-to-1-kHz range.
For floor toms, you can try boosting the frequency range 40 to 125 Hz if you
want to add some richness and fullness. You may also find that cutting in the
400-to-800-Hz range can get rid of any boxy sound that the drum may have.
To add more attack, boost the 2.5-to-5-kHz range.
Hi-hats
Most of the time, the hi-hats are pretty well represented in the rest of the mics
in the drum set, but depending on which mics are picking up the hi-hats, you
can use the hi-hat mic to bring out their sheen or brightness. To do this, try
boosting the frequencies above 10 kHz with a shelf EQ. You may also find that
cutting frequencies below 200 Hz eliminates any rumble created by other
drums that the hi-hat mic picked up.
Cymbals
With the cymbals, I usually cut anything below 150 to 200 Hz with a shelf EQ
to get rid of any rumbling that these mics pick-up. I also drop a few dBs at 1
to 2 kHz if the cymbals sound kind of trashy or clanky. Adding a shelf EQ
above 10 kHz can add a nice sheen to the mix.
Overhead mics
If you used overhead mics to pick up both the drums and the cymbals, be
careful about cutting too much low end — doing so just sucks the life right
out of your drums. Also, if the drums coming through the overhead mics
sound boxy or muddy, work with the 100-to-200-Hz frequencies for the mud-
diness and 400-Hz-to-1-kHz frequencies for the boxiness.
Percussion
High-pitched percussion instruments (shakers, for example) sound good
when the higher frequencies are boosted a little bit, over 10 kHz for instance.
This adds some brightness and softness to their sound. You can also roll off
many of the lower frequencies, below 500 Hz, to eliminate any boxiness that
might be present from miking too closely. (See Book 3, Chapter 2 for more on
mic placement.)

Equalizing Your Tracks
546
Lower-pitched percussion instruments, such as maracas, can also have the
lower frequencies cut a little — use 250 Hz and lower. Try boosting frequen-
cies between 2.5 and 5 kHz to add more of the instruments’ attack. To
brighten them up, add a little bit in the 8-kHz-to-10-kHz range.
Piano
For pianos, you often want to make sure that the instrument has both a nice
attack and a warm-bodied tone. You can add attack in the 2.5-to-5-kHz range,
and warmth can be added in the 80-to-150-Hz range. If your piano sounds
boomy or muddy, try cutting a little between 200 and 400 Hz.

ynamics processors allow you to control the dynamic range of a signal.
The dynamic range is the difference between the softest and loudest
signals that a sound source produces. The dynamic range is listed in deci-
bels (dB). The larger the dynamic range, the more variation exists between
the softest and loudest notes.
The four types of dynamics processors are compressors, limiters, gates, and
expanders. This chapter gives you the lowdown on each type and how they
can help you do a number of important things to your music. You can add
punch or smooth out an instrument’s sound, even out an erratic perform-
ance, or eliminate noise from a track.
Connecting Dynamics Processors
Dynamics processors are Insert effects. This means you insert them into a
track so they become part of it, affecting the track’s entire signal. To apply a
dynamics processor in Pro Tools follow these steps:
1. Choose Display➪Mix Window Shows➪Inserts from the main menu to
make sure that the Inserts section is showing in the Mix window.
2. Click the top arrow on the left side of the Inserts section of the track’s
channel strip.
The Inserts pop-up menu opens, as shown in Figure 4-1.
3. Select either the Multi-Channel Plug-In or Multi-Mono Plug-In option
depending on whether your track is a stereo (in which case, use multi-
channel) or a mono (use multimono) track.
4. Select the Compressor, Limiter, Expander-Gate, or Gate option.

Introducing Compressors
548
The chosen plug-in window opens. (Figures 4-2, 4-3, 4-4, and 4-5 show the
Compressor, Limiter, Expander-Gate, and Gate respectively).
Introducing Compressors
The compressor’s job is to compress (go figure) the dynamic range of the
sound being affected. The compressor not only limits how loud a note can
be but also reduces the difference between the loudest and softest note,
compressing the dynamic range.
Compressors are used for three main purposes (although other purposes
certainly exist as well):
✦To keep transients — the initial attack of an instrument — from creating
digital distortion during tracking. This is common with drums that have
a very fast attack (initial signal) that can easily overload the recorder (or
converters or preamps).
✦To even out any performance that shows signs of a high degree of un-
wanted dynamic variation. You do this during either the mixing or track-
ing stage. Some recorded passages are too loud and others are too quiet.
✦To raise the overall apparent level of the music during mastering. For
example, listen to a CD recorded ten years ago and one from the last
year or so. The newer CD sounds louder.
I cover Purpose 1 in Book 3, Chapter 2, and I explore Purpose 3 in Book 7,
Chapter 2. So that leaves Purpose 2 to explore with sample settings later in
this section.
Getting to know compressor parameters
Pro Tools comes with its own compressor plug-in, as detailed in the previous
section. After you get this guy open, you’re going to want to adjust the follow-
ing parameters (listed top to bottom in Figure 4-2):

✦Gain: The Gain slider allows you to adjust the level (volume) of the
signal going out of the compressor. This is listed in decibels (dB).
Because adding compression generally reduces the overall level of the
sound, you use this control to raise the level back up to where it was
when it went in.
✦Threshold: The Threshold setting dictates the dB level at which the
compressor starts to act on the signal. This setting is often listed as dB
below peak (0dB). In other words, a setting of –6dB means that the com-
pressor starts to act when the signal is 6 decibels below its calibrated
0dB mark. (In digital systems, 0dB is the highest level a signal can go
before clipping.)
✦Ratio: The Ratio setting shows the how much the compressor affects the
signal. The ratio — 2:1, for instance — means that for every decibel that
the signal goes over the threshold setting, it is reduced by two. In other
words, if a signal goes 1dB over the threshold setting, its output from
the compressor will be only 1⁄2dB louder. With ratios above 10:1, your
compressor starts to act like a limiter (see the later section “Looking
into Limiters”).
✦Attack: The Attack slider controls how soon the compressor kicks in.
The attack is defined in milliseconds (ms), and the lower the number,
the faster the attack.
✦Release: The Release slider controls how long the compressor continues
affecting the signal after it drops back below the Threshold setting. Like
the attack, the release is defined in milliseconds. The lower the number,
the faster the release time.
✦Knee: The Knee slider controls how the compressor behaves as the input
signal passes the threshold. The lower the setting, the more gradual the
compressor acts as the signal passes the threshold.

Getting started using compression
The compressor is one of the most useful — and one of the most abused —
pieces of gear in the recording studio. The most difficult part of using com-
pression is that every instrument reacts differently to the same settings. In
this section, I offer you some guidelines and ideas for using the compressor
effectively. 
The following steps show you one good way to get familiar with the 
compressor:
1. Start with a high Ratio setting (between 8:1 and 10:1) and move the
Threshold slider all the way to the right.
2. Slowly move the Threshold slider back to the left, watch the meters,
and listen carefully.
As you reduce the threshold, notice where the meters are when you start
hearing a change in the sound of the track. Also notice what happens to
the sound when you have the threshold really low and the meters are
peaked. (The sound is very different from where you started.)
3. Slowly move the Threshold slider back to the right and notice how the
sound changes back again.
After you get used to how the sound changes as you adjust the Threshold
setting, try using different Attack and Release settings and do this procedure
again. The more you experiment and critically listen to the changes made by
the different compressor settings, the better you’ll understand how to get
the sound that you want. The following guidelines can also help you achieve
your desired sound:
✦Try to avoid using any compression on your two-track mix while you
mix your music. Compression is a job for the mastering phase of your proj-
ect. If you compress your stereo tracks during mixdown, you limit what
can be done to your music in the mastering stage. This is true even if you
master it yourself and think you know what you want during mixdown.
✦If you hear noise when you use your compressor, you’ve set it too high.
What’s happening is you’re compressing the loud portions enough to
make the level of the softest sections of the music (including any noise)
much louder in comparison. To get rid of the noise, decrease the Ratio or
the Threshold settings.
✦To increase the punch of a track, make sure that the Attack setting
isn’t too quick. Otherwise, you lose the initial transient and the punch
of a track.
✦To smooth out a track, use a short Attack setting and a quick Release
time. This evens out the difference in level between the initial transient
and the body of the instrument, and results in a smoother sound.

Less is more when using compression. Resist the temptation to move those
sliders too much to the right — it just squashes your music. On the other
hand, if that’s an effect that you’re going for, don’t be afraid to experiment.
Using compression
When you first start experimenting with some compressor settings, you
most likely won’t know where to start. To make this process easier for you,
this section includes some sample settings for a variety of instruments. Start
with these and use the guidelines listed in the previous section to fine-tune
your settings.
Vocals
Most recording engineers think that compression is a must for vocals. It
evens out the often-erratic levels that a singer can produce and tames the
transient jumps in level that can cause digital distortion. You can use com-
pression on vocals to even out the performance and to create an effect.
If you use a compressor to even out a vocal performance, you don’t want to
hear the compressor working. Instead, you want to catch only the occasional
extremely loud transient that would cause clipping. A good compression set-
ting has three elements: a fast attack to catch the stray transient, a quick
release so that the compression doesn’t color the sound of the singer, and a
low ratio so that when the compressor does go on it smooths out the vocals
without squashing them. A typical setting might look like this:
Threshold: –8dB
Ratio: Between 1.5:1 and 2:1
Attack: <1 ms
Release: About 40 ms
Gain: Adjust so that the output level matches the input level. You don’t
need to add much gain.
If you want to use a compressor that pumps and breathes — that is, one that
you can really hear working — or if you want to bring the vocals way up
front in the mix, try using the following setting. This puts the vocals “in your
face” as recording engineers say:
Threshold: –2dB
Ratio: Between 4:1 and 6:1
Attack: <1 ms
Release: About 40 ms

Introducing Compressors
552
Gain: Adjust so that the output level matches the input level. You need
to add a fair amount of gain at this setting.
As you can see, the two parameters that you adjust most are Threshold and
Ratio. Experiment with these settings and check their effects by toggling
between the affected and unaffected sound. (Use the Bypass button in the
plug-in window.) Watch the levels going to disk and make sure that they
don’t peak over –6dB or –4dB. This ensures a hot signal — one that is loud —
and also leaves you some headroom (a few decibels below clipping) for
when you mixdown. (More on this in Book 6, Chapter 7.)
Electric guitar
Generally (these days, at least), the signal from an electric guitar gets run
through a compressor and other external effects before it’s even recorded.
You don’t need additional compression when you track the guitar unless you
use a clean (undistorted) setting on your guitar. If you do want to use a little
compression to bring the guitar forward and give it some punch, try these
settings:
Threshold: –1dB
Ratio: Between 2:1 and 3:1
Attack: 25ms to 30ms
Release: About 200ms
Gain: Adjust so that the output level matches the input level. You don’t
need to add much gain.
The slow attack is what allows the guitar to have a bit of punch to it. If you
want less punchiness, shorten the attack slightly. Be careful though — if you
shorten it too much, you end up with a mushy sound. (Ahem . . . we’re not
talking romance here. I mean the guitar has no definition.)
Electric bass
Another way to get a handle on the potential muddiness of the amplified bass
guitar is to use a little compression. Compression can also help control any
uneven levels that result from overzealous or inexperienced bass players. Try
these settings for a start:
Threshold: –4dB
Ratio: Between 2.5:1 and 3:1
Attack: Between 40 ms and 50 ms
Release: About 180 ms
Gain: Adjust so that the output level matches the input level. You don’t
need to add much gain.

Book VI
Chapter 4
Digging into

Introducing Compressors
553
Acoustic instruments
You don’t generally need a lot of compression on acoustic instruments, espe-
cially if you want a natural sound. You can use the compressor to even out
the resonance of the instrument, which keeps the main character of the
instrument from getting lost in a mix and avoids a muddy sound. Here’s a
good setting for strummed or picked acoustic instruments:
Threshold: –6dB
Ratio: Between 3:1 and 4:1
Attack: About 150 ms
Release: About 400 ms
Gain: Adjust so that the output level matches the input level. You don’t
need to add much gain.
The release is set very high because of the amount of sustain that these
acoustic instruments can have. If you play an instrument with less sustain,
such as a banjo, you may find that a shorter attack and release work just
fine. In this case, you can try the following settings:
Threshold: –6dB
Ratio: Between 2.5:1 and 3:1
Attack: Between 40 ms and 50 ms
Release: About 180 ms
Gain: Adjust so that the output level matches the input level. You don’t
need to add much gain, if any.
Kick drum
The kick drum responds quite well to a compressor when tracking. For the
most part, you can get by with settings that tame the boom a little and allow
the initial attack to get through. A sample setting looks like this:
Threshold: –6dB
Ratio: Between 4:1 and 6:1
Attack: Between 40 ms and 50 ms
Release: Between 200 ms and 300 ms
Gain: Adjust so that the output level matches the input level. You don’t
need to add much gain.

Looking into Limiters
554
Snare drum
Adding compression to the snare drum is crucial if you want a tight, punchy
sound. You can go a lot of ways with the snare. The following settings are
common and versatile:
Threshold: –4dB
Ratio: Between 4:1 and 6:1
Attack: Between 5 ms and 10 ms
Release: Between 125 ms and 175 ms
Gain: Adjust so that the output level matches the input level. You don’t
need to add much gain.
Percussion
Because these instruments have high sound levels and are prone to extreme
transients, I like to use a little compression just to control the levels going to
disk. Here’s a good starting point:
Threshold: –10dB
Ratio: Between 3:1 and 6:1
Attack: Between 10 ms and 20 ms
Release: About 50 ms
Gain: Adjust so that the output level matches the input level. You need
to add a bit of gain.
Looking into Limiters
The limiter works much like the compressor except that it limits the highest
level of a sound source. Any signal above the threshold is chopped off rather
than compressed. Limiters are great for raising the overall level of an instru-
ment and keeping transients from eating up all the headroom (maximum
level) of a track.
Understanding limiter settings
Pro Tools comes with the limiter plug-in shown in Figure 4-3. You insert this
plug-in into a track by following the procedures listed in the “Connecting
Dynamics Processors” section at the beginning of this chapter. The limiter
contains the following parameters:

Book VI
Chapter 4
Digging into
Dynamics
Processors
Looking into Limiters
555
✦Gain: The Gain slider allows you to adjust the level (volume) of the
signal going out of the limiter. This is listed in decibels.
✦Threshold: The Threshold setting dictates the level at which the limiter
starts to act on the signal. This is listed in dB (decibels). This setting is
often listed as dB below peak (0dB). In other words, a setting of –6dB
means that the limiter kicks in when the signal is 6 decibels below its
calibrated 0dB mark. (In digital systems, 0dB is the highest level a signal
can go before clipping.)
✦Attack: The Attack slider controls how soon the limiter kicks in. The
attack is defined in milliseconds (ms), and the lower the number, the
faster the attack.
✦Release: The Release slider controls how long the limiter continues lim-
iting the signal after it has dropped back below the threshold setting.
Like the attack, the release is defined in milliseconds. The lower the
number, the faster the release time.
Setting limits with the limiter
The limiter is essentially a compressor on steroids, so many of the settings
that you can use for a compressor work for limiters. The only difference is
that you don’t have the Ratio and Knee settings. Keep in mind these two tips
when using limiters on your tracks:
✦When using limiters to raise the volume of a track or mix, limit only 2 or
3dB at a time. This way, the limiter doesn’t alter the sound of your
signal; it just reduces the highest peaks and raises the volume.
✦To add grunge to a track, lower the Threshold setting so that you limit
the signal 6 to 12dB. Tweak the Attack and Release parameters to get the
sound you’re after. This creates distortion that may work for a particular
track such as the snare drum.

Introducing Gates
556
Introducing Gates
A gate is basically the opposite of the limiter: Rather than limiting how loud a
note can get, the gate limits how soft a note can get. The gate filters out any
sound below the threshold and allows any note above it to be passed through
unaffected.
Gates are useful for filtering out any unwanted noise that may be present in
the recording environment. A classic situation for using gates is when you
record drums. You can set the gate to filter any sound (other drums, for
instance) except for the sounds resulting from the hits to the particular
drum that you have miked.
Getting to know gate parameters
You can see the gate plug-in that ships with Pro Tools in Figure 4-4. The vari-
ous settings that you get to play with are similar to the ones for compressors
and limiters, as the following list makes clear:
✦Threshold: The Threshold slider sets the level (in dB) at which the gate
opens (stops filtering the signal). The gate allows all signals above the
Threshold setting to pass through unaffected, whereas any signals below
the Threshold setting are reduced by the amount set by the Range control.
✦Attack: Like with the compressor and limiter, the Attack slider sets the
rate at which the gate opens (in milliseconds). Fast attacks work well for
instruments with, well, fast attacks, such as drums, whereas slow
attacks are better suited for instruments with slow attacks, like vocals.
✦Hold: The Hold setting controls the amount of time that the gate stays
open after the signal drops below the threshold. When the hold time is

reached, the gate closes abruptly. This parameter is listed in milliseconds
(ms). The Hold parameter allows you to get the gated drum sound that
was so popular in the 1980s. (Phil Collins, anyone?)
✦Decay: The Decay setting dictates the rate at which the gate closes after
the signal hits the threshold (listed in milliseconds). Unlike the Hold fea-
ture, the Decay setting doesn’t close abruptly; rather it slowly (accord-
ing to the Decay setting) closes, which produces a more natural sound. 
✦Range: The Range setting is similar to the Ratio setting on the compres-
sor except that you choose the dB amount by which the gate attenuates
(reduces) the signal. For example, a setting of 40dB drops any signal
below the Threshold setting by 40 decibels.
Getting started using gates
Noise gates can be extremely useful for getting rid of unwanted noise. The
most common use for a gate is to eliminate bleeding from drum mics. For
example, you may get bleed from your snare drum into your tom-toms mics.
When using noise gates, keep the following in mind:
✦When the threshold is reached, the gate allows the signal through. If
your background noise is high enough, when the gate opens, you still
hear not only the intended sound but the background noise as well.
✦When gating drums, be sure to set the attack very fast. Otherwise, the
initial transient is lost, and you end up with mushy-sounding drums.
✦When setting the release time of the gate, adjust it until it sounds natural
and doesn’t clip off the end of your instrument’s sound.
✦Set the range just high enough to mask any unwanted noise. If you set it
too high, the sound becomes unnatural because the natural resonance
of the instrument may be filtered out.
Examining the Expander
The expander is to the gate what the compressor is to the limiter — instead of
reducing the volume of notes below the set threshold by a specified amount,
the expander reduces them by a ratio. In other words, with the gate, you set a
certain dB amount by which a signal is reduced, and with the expander, you
reduce the signal by setting a ratio. The ratio changes the signal gradually,
making the affected signals sound more natural.
You use an expander when you want to subtly reduce noise from a track
rather than just filtering it out completely. A classic example is when you deal
with breath from a singer. If you use a gate, you get an unnatural-sounding

Examining the Expander
558
track because the breaths are filtered out completely. With the expander, you
can set it to reduce the breath just enough so that it’s less noticeable, but you
can leave a little of the sound in to make the singer sound normal. (I mean,
everyone has to breathe, right?)
Playing with expander parameters
The expander plug-in in Pro Tools, shown in Figure 4-5, uses similar settings
to the compressors, limiter, and gates. They are as follows:
✦Threshold: The Threshold setting in an expander works the same way
as with the gate — anything below the threshold is affected, and any
signal above the threshold passes through unaffected.
✦Ratio: The ratio dictates how much the signal is attenuated by the
expander. When using a ratio of 2:1, for instance, the expander reduces
any signal below the threshold by 2 times. In this case, a signal that is
10dB below the threshold is reduced to 20dB below it; likewise, a signal
that’s 2dB below the threshold is reduced to 4dB below it.
✦Attack: As with the compressor and limiter, the Attack slider sets the rate
at which the expander opens (in milliseconds). Fast attacks work well for
instruments with, well, fast attacks, such as drums, whereas slow attacks
are better suited for instruments with slow attacks, like vocals.
✦Hold: The Hold setting controls the amount of time that the gate stays
open after the signal drops below the threshold. The hold time is listed
in milliseconds (ms).

✦Decay: The Decay setting dictates the rate at which the expander closes
after the signal hits the threshold (listed in milliseconds). Unlike the Hold
feature, the Decay setting doesn’t close abruptly; rather it slowly (accord-
ing to the Decay setting) closes, which produces a more natural sound. 
✦Range: The Range setting is similar to the Ratio setting on the compressor
except that you choose the dB amount by which you want the expander
to be attenuate (reduce) the signal. For example, a setting of 40dB drops
any signal below the threshold setting by 40 decibels.
Getting started using an expander
Because the expander works much like a gate, you can use the same basic
starting points. Choose between a gate or an expander based on the type of
overall attenuation that you want of the signal. For example, the expander is
a good choice if you have an instrument that contains sounds that are too
loud but you don’t want to get rid of them completely — you just want to
reduce them a little.
Adjusting for a vocalist’s breath is the perfect situation for using an expander
rather than a gate. In this case, you can set the expander’s threshold just
below the singer’s softest note and start with a low ratio (1.5:1 or 2:1, for
instance). See if the breathiness improves, and if it doesn’t, slowly move the
Ratio slider until you get the effect that you want. Be careful not to overdo it,
though. If the breath is too quiet compared to the vocal, the vocal sounds
unnatural.
If you use a high ratio in your expander (6:1 or above), the effect that you get
is similar in sound to the gate, but you end up having less control over the
sound because you don’t have the Hold or Release settings to adjust. So if
you find yourself using a high ratio on a signal, a gate may be a better choice
for that situation.
Keying into External Keys
Engaging the External Key option in the dynamics processors in Pro Tools
lets you set up a side-chain. Using a side-chain means that the signal from
another track (through one of the buses) or from one of your interface
inputs triggers your dynamics processor into action. The signal that you
choose to do the triggering is called the key input.
Side-chains are great for de-essing a vocal track (getting rid of “s” sounds),
making tracks fit together better in a sense mix, or letting a kick drum be
heard when it plays at the same time as the bass guitar. Not sure how to do
this? Don’t worry, I provide some examples later in this section.

Keying into External Keys

Setting up a side-chain
Setting up a side-chain in one of Pro Tool’s dynamics processors involves the
following steps:
1. Click to open the Key Input drop-down menu located next to the little
Key icon at the top of the plug-in window.
2. From the pop-up menu, choose the interface input or bus that has the
signal that you want to use to trigger the dynamics processor.
This routes the signal from that input or bus to the processor.
3. Click the External Key button to engage the side-chain.
The External Key button is located near the bottom-left of the various
plug-in windows. (Refer to Figure 4-5.)
4. Click the Key Listen button — located to the right of the External Key
button — to hear the signal coming through your selected key input.
5. Play your session and adjust the processor’s parameters until you get
the sound that you want.
Using a side-chain
The uses for side-chains are numerous, and only your creativity limits how
you end up using your side-chain. The most common use for side-chains is
creating more room for your instruments in the mix. This is done by EQing the
Key Input signal and letting that EQed signal trigger a compressor or limiter.
To make room for a vocal in a dense mix, follow these steps:
1. Route all your instruments in the mix (except the vocal) to Bus 15 
and 16.
2. Insert the compressor plug-in in this bus and set the Key Input to 
Bus 14.
3. Make a copy of your vocal tracks and assign their outputs to Bus 14.
4. Shift the copied vocal tracks ahead (to the right) a few milliseconds.
5. Adjust the settings on the compressor so that the volume of the instru-
ments drops slightly whenever the vocals come in.
For a starting point, use the smooth vocal compressor setting that I
mention in the “Vocals” section earlier in this chapter.

Book VI
Chapter 4

You can also use a special trick to make the bass guitar drop slightly in the
mix whenever the kick drum is played. Follow these steps:
1. Insert the compressor plug-in into the bass guitar track and set the
Key Input to Bus 16.
2. Make a copy of the kick drum track and set the output for the copied
track to Bus 16.
The kick signal will trigger the compressor that’s assigned to the bass
guitar track.
3. Use fast Attack and Release settings on the compressor.
You want the compressor to activate only when the initial strike of the
kick drum happens. The bass guitar drops in volume when the kick
drum plays. This means that the kick drum creates the attack and the
bass guitar produces the sustain.
This trick works really well for music that has a kick drum and bass guitar
that play similar patterns.

 Examining offline effects processing
U
nless you record your songs using a live band in a perfect acoustic
environment, your music will sound a little flat without the addition of
some type of effects. Effects allow you to make your music sound like you
recorded it in just about any environment possible. You can make your
drums sound as if they were recorded in a cathedral or your vocals sound
as if you were singing underwater. Effects also have the ability to make you
sound better than the real you. For example, you can add harmony parts to
your lead or backup vocals, or you can make your guitar sound like you
played it through any number of great amplifiers.
In this chapter, you discover many of the most-common effects processors
used in recording studios. (Signal processors are the neat software plug-ins
behind all the effects you can achieve in your Pro Tools studio.) You discern
the difference between insert (that is, line) effects and send/return effects.
You also get a chance to explore ways of using these processors, with rec-
ommendations for using reverb, delay, and chorus. To top it off, you get a
glimpse into offline effects processing such as pitch-shifting.
The best way to learn how to use effects on your music is to experiment.
The more you play around with the different settings, the more familiar you
become with how each effect operates. Then you can get creative and come
up with the best ways to use effects for your music.
The Bypass button in the Pro Tools effects-processor plug-in window is your
friend. With a click of the Bypass button, you can quickly turn off any effect
in use with your signal. Use this button to check your effect settings against
your original signal. Sometimes you’ll like the original sound better.

Routing Your Effects
564
Routing Your Effects
Effects processors can be used as either send/return or insert effects. In
both cases, you can work with the dry (unaffected) signal and the wet
(affected) signals separately. If you use the effect in a send/return routing,
you can adjust the wet and dry signals with two track faders: Aux Send
(opened by clicking the effect’s name in the Send list) and Auxiliary. If you
use the effect in a line configuration, the plug-in window displays a Mix
parameter where you can adjust the wet/dry balance. 
You choose whether to insert an effect in a track or to use the Send function
based upon what you intend to do. For example, if you insert the effect into a
track (as described in the next section), that effect only alters the signal that
exists on the track it’s inserted into. On the other hand, using an effect send
for your effect allows you to route more than one track through that effect.
(You can adjust the individual levels going to the send at each track so you
still have control over how much effect is applied to each track going to the
send.) In addition, inserting an effect always puts the effect before the fader
in the track (pre-fader); if you use a send, you can choose whether the effect
does its magic before (pre-fader) or after (post-fader) signal enters the fader
that controls the track’s output. If you use a send to apply the effect to more
than one track at a time, you also reduce the amount of processing power
the effect has to use. (Inserting the same effect into each track you want to
alter ends up using more processing power.)
Inserting effects
If you only want to use an effect on one specific track, you can insert it into
the track using the Insert function. To insert an effect in Pro Tools, follow
these steps:
1. Make sure that the Inserts section is showing in the Mix window by
choosing Display➪Mix Window Shows➪Inserts from the main menu. 
2. Click the top arrow on the left side of the Inserts section of the track’s
channel strip. 
The Insert pop-up menu appears, as shown in Figure 5-1.
3. If your track is a stereo track, select either the multi-channel or multi-
mono option. 
If your track is mono, you don’t have a choice here. You’re stuck using a
mono plug.
4. Select your desired plug-in — D-Verb, Slap Delay, Long Delay, what-
ever — from the menu.
The plug-in window opens. Here you can set your parameters. (My pro-
fessional advice on what settings to actually tweak comes later in this
chapter, when I cover the individual effects.)

Sending signals to effects
There are times when you want to route a bunch of tracks to a single effect
(in the case of reverbs, for instance). In this case, you follow these steps:
1. Select one of the buses from the Send selector in each track that you
want to route to the effect. 
The Send Output window appears, as shown in Figure 5-2. The window
contains a handy channel strip for controlling the signal being sent to
the selected bus.

Book 6, Chapter 2 further details plug-ins and how to route signals through
your system to them.
Rolling out the Reverb
Reverb is undoubtedly the most commonly used effects processor. Reverb is a
natural characteristic of any enclosed room and is the result of sound waves
bouncing off the walls, floor, and ceiling. A small room produces reflections
that start quickly and end soon; in larger rooms, halls, or cathedrals, the
sound has farther to travel, so you get slower start times and a longer-lasting
reverberation.
This room effect enables you to place your track closer to the imaginary “front”
or “back” of the mix. You do this by varying how much of the affected signal
you include with the unaffected one. For example, mixing a lot of reverb with
the dry (unaffected) signal gives the impression of being farther away, so your
instrument sounds like it’s farther back in the mix.
Seeing reverb settings
You can adjust several parameters when you use reverb, which gives you a
lot of flexibility. Figure 5-3, which shows the Reverb plug-in that comes with
Pro Tools, including a peek at the parameters you can play with.

Book VI
Chapter 5
Singling out Signal
Processors
Rolling out the Reverb
567
The following list explains how the parameters — most, but not all, visible in
Figure 5-3 — affect the sound of the reverb:
✦Algorithm: This setting lets you choose the type of room that the reverb
sounds like. You have the option of a hall, church, plate (a type of reverb
that uses a metal plate to create its sound), two different rooms, ambi-
ent (natural room sound), and nonlinear (less natural) sound. Each
choice also sets the other parameters for the reverb, but you can adjust
those as you like to give your reverb a distinct sound.
✦Size: This option refers to the “room” choices you have in the Algorithm
setting. You have three settings to choose from: Small, Medium, and
Large. Clicking one of these options adjusts the rest of parameters in the
window, except for the Algorithm setting.
✦Diffusion: Diffusion affects the density of the reflections in the “room”
you have chosen. A higher diffusion setting results in a thicker sound.
Think of the diffusion parameter as a way to simulate how reflective the
room is. More-reflective rooms produce a much higher diffusion. To sim-
ulate a less-reflective room, use lower-diffusion settings.
✦Decay: The decay is the length of time that the reverb lasts. Larger or
more-reflective rooms produce a longer decay.
✦Predelay: A sound reaches your ears before the sound’s reverb does,
and the predelay is the amount of time from the sound’s beginning and
the start of the reverb, which is described in milliseconds (ms). Because
reverb is made up of reflections of sound within a room, the sound takes
time to bounce around the room and reach your ears. By then, you’ve
already heard the sound because it came directly to you. Predelay helps
to define the initial sound signal by separating it from the reverb. This
parameter is essential in making your reverb sound natural.

568
A small room has a shorter predelay than a large room. 
✦HF Cut: This setting allows you to control the rate at which the high fre-
quencies decay. Most of the time the high frequencies decay faster, so
being able to control this effect can result in a more natural sounding
reverb.
✦Low Pass: This filter controls the level of the high frequencies within the
reverb. Setting this frequency gives the impression of a “darker” (lower-
frequency setting) or “brighter” (higher-frequency setting) room.
Getting started using reverb
Reverb is like garlic: The more you use, the less you can taste it. Just as the
new chef puts garlic in everything (and lots of it) many budding engineers
make the same mistake with reverb. Go easy. Remember: Less is more. 
Here are some other things to keep in mind:
✦Mixes often sound better when you use reverb on only a few instru-
ments instead of them all. For example, it’s not uncommon for just the
snare drum of the drumset to have reverb on it. The rest of the drums
and cymbals remain dry (unaffected). 
✦Try using reverb to “glue” instruments together. Routing all of your
drum tracks to the same reverb, for instance, can make them sound like
they were all recorded in the same room. When doing this, make sure
that you adjust the Send level for each instrument so that the effect
sounds natural. Also, use less reverb for all the instruments than you
would for just one. This keeps the sound from becoming muddy from
using too much reverb.
✦Think about how you want each instrument to sit in the mix when you
choose reverb. Make sure the type and amount of reverb fits the song
and the rest of the instruments. 
✦Try putting the dry (unaffected) sound on one side of the stereo field
and the reverb on the other. For example, if you have a rhythm guitar
part that you set at 30 degrees off to the right of the stereo field, set the
reverb 30 degrees off to the left. This can be a nice effect.
✦To keep the vocals up front in the mix, use a short reverb setting. A vocal
plate is a great choice because the decay is fast. This adds a fair amount
of the reverb to the vocal without making it sit way back in the mix.
✦Experiment with room types, sizes, and decay times. Sometimes a long
decay on a small room reverb sounds better than a short decay on a
large room or hall reverb.

Detailing Delay
569
Detailing Delay
Along with reverb, delay is a natural part of sound bouncing around a room.
When you speak (or sing or play) into a room, you often hear not only
reverb, but also a distinct echo. This echo may be short or long depending
on the size of the room. The original sound may bounce back to you as a
single echo or as multiple, progressively quieter delays.
Digging into delay settings
There are several types of delay effects, including a slap-back echo, tape
delay, and multiple delays, and each of them is designed to add dimension to
your instrument. To create these various effects, you adjust several parame-
ters, as the following list and Figure 5-4 make clear. The Delay plug-ins that
come with Pro Tools are pretty much the same. (Okay, the default setting for
each is different, but that’s a pretty minor thing.) The parameters that you
can adjust include the following: 
✦Gain: This lets you set the signal level going into the delay.
✦Mix: This parameter controls the output level of the effect. The higher
you set this parameter, the louder the delayed signal is relative to the
original signal.
✦LPF: The Low Pass filter (LPF) lets you filter out some of the high fre-
quencies from the delay. 
✦Delay: This parameter controls the amount of time between the initial
signal and the repeated sound. The time is listed in milliseconds (ms)
and can be as short as a few milliseconds or as long as several seconds.
✦Depth: This parameter lets you add modulation to the delay so that you
can create a chorus effect. (See the “Creating Chorus Effects” section,
later in this chapter, for more on chorus and flange effects.) The higher
the level on this setting, the greater the modulation.
Figure 5-4:

Detailing Delay
570
✦Rate: This setting lets you set the amount of time that the modulation
takes to cycle.
✦Feedback: The Feedback parameter controls how many times the echo
repeats. A low setting makes the echo happen just once while higher set-
tings produce more echoes. 
Some of the Delay plug-ins in Pro Tools also offer the ability to set the delay
to the tempo of your song. The following list covers these settings:
✦Tempo Match: This option allows you to set the delay to beat in time
with the music. The Tempo Match feature is referenced to the tempo
map that you set for the song. You can set this parameter to any note
division, from sixteenth notes to whole notes, if you want the delays to
keep time with your song. (Quarter- and eighth-note delays are the most
commonly used note divisions.) 
✦Meter: This lets you set the meter of the song and the subdivision that
you want the delay to follow. When you change this parameter, the Delay
parameter moves too.
✦Groove: Use this parameter to adjust the rate of the delay in relation to
the tempo and subdivision you chose. By changing this setting, you alter
the delay (by percentages) away from the strict tempo and subdivision
settings. This can be useful if you’re adjusting the exact delay that you
want. When you adjust this parameter, the Delay setting changes as well.
Getting started using delay
Delay is used a lot in contemporary music, and many times you don’t hear it
unless you listen carefully. Other times it is prominent in the mix (for exam-
ple, the snare drum in some reggae music). Here are ways you can use delay
in your music:
✦One of the most effective ways to use delay is as a slap-back echo on
vocals. A slap-back echo consists of one to three repeats spaced very
closely together, which fattens up the sound of the vocals. You generally
want to set your time parameter between 90 and 120 milliseconds. Set
the level so you barely hear the first echo when your vocal is in the mix
and adjust it from there until you like the sound. In pop music, a slap-
back echo and a vocal plate reverb are commonly used on lead vocals. 
(It was really common in the 1950s, and shows up a lot — less subtly —
in rockabilly.) The Slap Delay plug-in in Pro Tools is a good place to start,
although the default setting has a longer delay time than I recommend. 
✦Use the Tempo Match feature to have your delay echo in time with the
music. This can add some depth to the mix without creating a muddy or
cluttered sound. Be careful — if you use this too much, it can make your
music sound annoyingly repetitive.

Creating Chorus Effects
571
Creating Chorus Effects
Chorus takes the original sound and creates a copy that is very slightly out of
tune with the original and varies over time. This variance is called modula-
tion, and the result is an effect that can add interest and variety to an instru-
ment. Chorus is used quite extensively to add fullness to an instrument,
particularly guitars and vocals. Pro Tools doesn’t come with a Chorus plug-
in per se, but all of the Delay plug-ins can produce chorusing effects by
adjusting the Depth and Rate parameters. (Check out the “Detailing Delay”
section, earlier in this chapter, for more on delays.)
If reverb is like garlic, then chorus is cayenne pepper. You may get away with
a little too much garlic in your food without too much trouble, but if you add
too much cayenne, you run the risk of making your food inedible. Such is the
case with the chorus effect. Used sparingly, it can add a lot to your music;
overdone, it can wreak havoc on a good song.
✦To fill out a vocal track, try setting the rate at 2 Hz, the depth at about 20
to 30, and the delay at 10 to 20 ms. Keep the Feedback level low.
✦Use a chorus on backup vocals to make them much fuller and allow you
to use fewer tracks.
✦Pan the chorus to one side of the mix and the dry (unaffected) signal to
the other. This can be especially interesting on guitars and synthesizer
patches.

I
t’s unlikely to have a session that doesn’t have a single change in level,
pan, EQ, or plug-in parameters somewhere in the song. Unless you have
an external mixer or control surface, you’re stuck making these changes
with your mouse. The problem with all this mouse-intensive work is that
there is no way you can move more than one fader, panning knob, or plug-in
setting at a time. To be honest, the only way you can really mix within Pro
Tools is by using some kind of automation feature . . . which Pro Tools just
happens to have in spades. In fact, Pro Tools has a quite powerful automa-
tion engine that allows you to control a variety of mix parameters.
Don’t like the way the guitar in the second verse sits in the mix? No prob-
lem. Just fix your automation data and mix it again. You can even save multi-
ple versions of these settings so you can create as many mixes as you want.
(Be careful here. When asked, most mix engineers say that they only finally
finish a mix when they run out of time or money to keep trying things.)
This chapter gets you going on mixing the new-fangled way: automatically.
Well, not exactly automatically — you still need to program these mixing
settings, but I’ll show you how to do it. In this chapter, I lead you through
the process of automating the various aspects of your song — volume
levels, mute and panning placement, EQ, and plug-in settings are all covered.
In addition, you discover how to change your automation settings and how
to play the automation data back so you’re ready to do your final mix. 
Understanding Automation 
You can automate a variety of parameters in Pro Tools. Each of these param-
eters has a playlist that contains its automation data. You can write this data
one parameter (or more) at a time — and you can display and edit the data
even while playing the session. This section describes the parameters you
can automate in audio and MIDI tracks.

Accessing Automation Modes
574
Audio tracks
You can automate the following parameters in your audio tracks:
✦Volume: This parameter controls the overall volume of the track.
✦Pan: This lets you set the left/right balance of the track in the stereo field.
✦Mute: This allows you to turn the track on and off.
✦Send: This includes volume, mute, and panning settings for the send — the
routing section that lets you send part of your track’s signal to an effect.
✦Plug-in parameters: You adjust these parameters within the Plug-In
window.
Automation data for each of these parameters resides in a playlist that’s sep-
arate from the regions that contain your edits for that track. This allows you
to move the regions in and out of the track’s playlist without changing the
automation data for that track.
MIDI tracks
You can automate the following parameters when you’re working with MIDI
tracks:
✦Volume: This parameter sets the overall volume of the MIDI data.
✦Pan: You can place your tracks anywhere from left to right in the stereo
field.
✦Mute: This allows you to turn the track on and off.
✦Controller data: This includes a number of MIDI settings, including
options such as the modulation wheel, breath controller, and sustain.
Pro Tools stores the automation data for MIDI tracks — with the exception of
Mute settings — within the MIDI region for that track. So when you move a
region within a track’s playlist, the automation data (except for any mute set-
tings) moves along with the region.
Accessing Automation Modes
Pro Tools offers five automation modes: Auto Off, Auto Write, Auto Touch, Auto
Latch, and Auto Trim. You access these modes by clicking the Automation
Mode selector in the channel strip of each track in the Mix window or in the
Track Controls section of the Edit window, as shown in Figure 6-1. Each of these
modes affects how automation data for a track are written or played back.
These are covered in this section.

Now for the particulars. Here’s what each mode actually does:
✦Auto Off: This mode turns off all automation data for the selected track.
✦Auto Read: This mode plays back the automation data for the selected
track.
✦Auto Write: This mode writes automation data for the selected parame-
ter(s) while the session plays — overwriting any pre-existing automation
data in the process. When you stop playback after writing automation in
this mode, Pro Tools automatically switches the automation mode to
Auto Touch (see next bullet) so you don’t accidentally erase this data
next time you play back the session.
✦Auto Touch: Auto Touch mode writes automation data only when you
click a parameter with your mouse; it stops writing when you release the
mouse button. (See the upcoming Remember icon for control-surface
behavior in this mode.) At this point, your automated parameter returns
to any previously automated position, according to the time you’ve set
for AutoMatch in the Automation tab of the Preferences menu. (See the
“Setting Automation Preferences” section, later in this chapter, for more
on the Preferences dialog box.) Using Auto Touch, you can fix parts of
your previously recorded automation data without erasing the stuff you
want to keep.
Auto Touch will engage differently depending on the control surface you use. If
you have touch-sensitive faders (like those on the Digi 002), new automation
data is written as soon as you touch a fader. If your control surface doesn’t
sport touch-sensitive faders, Auto Touch mode won’t engage until you move a
fader past the position it occupied in the previously written automation data
(which is called the pass-through point). Once you hit that point, automation
data is written until you stop moving the fader.

✦Auto Latch: This mode works much like Auto Touch (see previous
bullet) — once you touch or move a parameter, new automation data is
written. The difference is that Latch mode continues to write new
automation data until you stop playback.
Setting Automation Preferences
Pro Tools writes and plays back automation data differently depending on
the preferences you have selected. You set these preferences by opening the
Preferences dialog box — choose Setups➪Preferences from the main menu
to get there — and then choosing the Automation tab (shown in Figure 6-2).
These preferences are where you specify how automation behaves in Pro
Tools:
✦Faders Move During Playback: With this box checked, your on-screen
faders move to match the volume changes you’ve automated. Useful for
double-checking your work with the faders, but turning off this option
can save processing power and speed up screen redraws.

✦Smooth and Thin Data After Pass: Checking this box lets Pro Tools
automatically smooth and thin automation data after you’ve recorded
your moves. (See the “Thinning Automation” section, later in this chap-
ter, for more on thinning.) This can make your automation curves more
manageable and free up memory for your automation data. (See the last
bullet item in this section.)
✦Mutes Follow Groups: Having this box checked means that any mutes
you apply to a track in a Mix group get applied to all tracks in that
group. If you want to mute your grouped tracks individually you can
simply leave this box unchecked, or you can right-click (on a PC) or
Ctrl+click (on a Mac) when you mute your track.
✦Solos Follow Groups: Checking this box makes all the tracks in a Mix
group solo whenever you hit the Solo button on one. To solo only one
track within a group, leave this box unchecked — or you can right-click
(on a PC) or Ctrl+click (on a Mac) the Solo button in your track’s chan-
nel strip.
✦Send Mutes Follow Groups: With this box checked, all tracks in a Mix
group respond whenever you mute the send of one of the track in that
group. To mute a send individually, uncheck this box or right-click (on a
PC) or Ctrl+click (on a Mac) on the Send Mute button in the channel
strip of the track you want to mute individually.
✦Send Levels Follow Groups: When this box is checked, altering the Send
level of one track within a Mix group changes all the Send levels for the
members of that group. To adjust the Send level of a single track in a
group, uncheck this box or Start/Windows+drag (on a Windows PC) or
Ctrl+drag (on a Mac) the Send level of that track.
✦Degree of Thinning: This box lets you determine the amount of thinning
that’s applied to automation data when you put a check in the Smooth
and Thin Data After Pass check box — or whenever you use the Thin
Automation command. (See the “Thinning Automation” section, later in
this chapter, for more about this command.)
✦Touch Timeout: When you’re using Auto Touch automation mode, this
setting controls how long your automation data continues to be written
after you stop moving a non-touch-sensitive control. (See the “Accessing
Automation Modes” section, earlier in this chapter, for more on Auto
Touch.)
✦AutoMatch Time: This setting controls the amount of time it takes for
Pro Tools to return to previously written automation data when you stop
recording new data in Auto Touch mode.
✦Amount of Memory To Reserve for Automation Recording: This setting
does what it says: You can reserve between 200 to 3000 KB of memory. If
your session needs a ton of automation data, choose a higher number;
for most mixes, I’ve found 500 to 1000 KB to be sufficient.

Enabling Automation
578
Enabling Automation
You can enable or suspend automation parameters on all tracks by using the
Automation Enable window (Choose Windows➪Show Automation Enable to
get the window on-screen.) or on individual or grouped tracks using the
automation drop-down menu (located in the Track Controls section of the
Edit window). Here you can play with all the parameters for audio tracks
that I list in “Understanding Automation” (earlier in this chapter) — except
for plug-ins, which are controlled in their respective windows.
Suspending or enabling automation across all tracks 
To enable or suspend the writing of automation data across all the tracks in
your session
1. Choose Windows➪Show Automation Enable from the main menu.
The Automation Enable window appears, as shown in Figure 6-3. The
default setting for this window is that all parameters are enabled — all
parameters highlighted. In the case of Figure 6-3, only the volume param-
eter is enabled, meaning that when you set your track to one of the
automation writing modes (Auto Write, Auto Latch, or Auto Touch) the
only automation that is written is volume data.
2. To suspend automation across all tracks, perform one of the following:
• To suspend a single control, click the name of an enabled parameter in
the Automation Enable window to deselect it. It’s no longer highlighted.
• To suspend all the available parameters, press the Auto Suspend
button.
3. To enable automation across all tracks, perform one of the following:
• To enable a single control, click the name of the parameter in the
Automation Enable window. It becomes highlighted. 
• To enable all the available parameters, press the Auto Suspend button
to deselect it.

Suspending automation for an individual track
You can suspend or enable reading or writing of automation without using
the Automation Enable window. In order to do this, though, you need to
make sure that you haven’t suspended automation using the Automation
Enable window (see previous section). You can suspend or enable automa-
tion for a single track or a group of tracks in a session by doing the following:
1. Click-hold the Automation selector in the Track Controls section of the
Edit window and drag to the Automation parameter (volume, mute,
pan, send level, or send mute) you want to suspend or enable.
2. Perform one of the following steps:
• To suspend automation writing or reading for the control selected in
the automation playlist, Ctrl+click (on a PC) or Command+click (on a
Mac) that control — Mute, Volume, Pan, whatever — in the Track
View Selector in the Track control section of the Edit window.
• To suspend automation writing and reading of a singe control across
all tracks, Ctrl+Alt+click (on a PC) or Command+Option+click (on a
Mac) the control in one Track View Selector in the Track control sec-
tion of the Edit window.
• To suspend automation writing and reading of all controls in a single
track, Ctrl+Shift+click (on a PC) or Command+Shift+click (on a Mac)
any control in the Track View Selector in the Track control section of
the Edit window.
To enable these parameters, repeat the steps above to toggle between
Suspend and Enable.

Writing Automation
580
Writing Automation
Writing automation is easy — simply enable the parameter that you want to
write automation data for, choose your automation mode, and adjust the
parameter as the session plays. This section details this process.
As automation is written, it appears in your track as breakpoints with lines
(ramps) between these points. The breakpoints are placed in the track’s
automation playlist — the playlist section of the track when you have the
Tracks view set to one of the Automation views using the Track View pop-up
menu. The number of breakpoints that appear is determined by the com-
plexity of the changes to the automation levels and by the setting you have
in the Degree of Thinning section of the Automation tab of the Preferences
dialog box. (Check out the “Setting Automation Preferences” section earlier
in this chapter.)
When the Smooth and Thin Data After Pass box is checked, a setting of None cre-
ates lots of breakpoints — you may not even notice any lines between them —
while a setting of Most creates many fewer breakpoints — with longer, more pro-
nounced lines between them. Pro Tools places lines between these breakpoints
to connect them. These lines follow the level from one breakpoint to another,
either going up, down, or staying the same. The combination of breakpoints and
connecting lines represent the automation curves for your track.
To keep from accidentally erasing or overwriting automation data, suspend
the writing of automation for the parameter by using one of the methods of
suspending automation listed in the previous section. 
Writing automation on a track
To write automation on a track, follow these steps:
1. Choose Windows➪Show Automation Enable from the main menu.
The Automation Enable window appears. (Refer to Figure 6-3.)
2. In the Automation Enable window, click the buttons of the parameters
you want to enable. 
3. Select Auto Write in each track you want to write to (choose Auto Touch
or Auto Latch for subsequent times) by clicking the Automation selector.
The Automation selector lives in the Edit menu (Book 2, Chapter 4).
4. Click Play in the Transport Window or press the Spacebar on your
keyboard to start your session.
5. Move the control for the parameters you want to automate. 
For example, move the track’s fader (located in the Channel strip of the
Mix window) up and down to record changes in the volume level of your
track.

6. Click Stop in the Transport window or press the Spacebar on your
keyboard to stop the session. 
Your automation shows up as a line with breakpoints (little dots) in the
track’s playlist, as long as you have the automation view visible. If it isn’t
visible, click on the Track View selector in the Track Controls section of
the Edit window to open the Track view pop-up menu and select the
automation parameter — volume, pan, mute, send level, send mute —
you want to view.
If this was your first pass writing automation and you had Auto Write mode
chosen, Pro Tools automatically switches the Automation mode to Touch
when you’re done.
To write over the first pass, you can start anywhere within the session by
clicking within the track or along the timeline where you want the automa-
tion data to start.
To overwrite switched controls, such as mute, solo, and plug-in bypasses,
you can simply press and hold the button down as the session plays. Pro
Tools writes new automation data as long as the switch is depressed based
upon the current state of the control (on or off).
Writing plug-in automation
To write automation data for plug-in parameters:
1. In the Mix window, click the name of the plug-in in the Insert section of
the track’s channel strip.
The particular Plug-In window appears.
2. Click the Auto Enable button in the upper-right of the Plug-In window. 
The Plug-In Automation dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 6-4.
Figure 6-4:
The Plug-In

3. Select the parameters you want to automate by clicking them in the
column on the left and then clicking Add. 
The selected parameters are added to the column on the right
4. Click OK.
The dialog box closes.
5. Click Play in the Transport Window (or press the Spacebar on your
keyboard) to start your session.
6. Carefully move the control for the parameters you want to automate.
7. Click Stop in the Transport window (or press the Spacebar on your
keyboard) to stop the session.
Your automation shows up as a line with breakpoints (little dots) in the
track’s playlist, as long as you have the automation view visible. If it’s 
not visible, click on the Track View selector in the Track Controls section
of the Edit window to open the Track view pop-up menu and select the
automation parameter — volume, pan, mute, send level, send mute —
you want to view.
Once you’re done writing the automation for the plug-in, you can make sure
that you don’t accidentally record over it by clicking the Safe button in the
upper-right part of the Plug-In window. 
Writing send automation
To write automation data for send level, mute, and pan settings, follow these
steps:
1. Choose Windows➪Show Automation Enable from the main menu.
The Automation Enable window appears. (Refer to Figure 6-3.)
2. In the Automation Enable window, click the buttons of the Send
parameters you want to enable. 
3. Choose Windows➪Mix Windows Shows➪Sends View from the main
menu.
Doing so displays the Send controls for the track(s) you want to automate.
4. Select the Auto Write (choose Auto Touch or Auto Latch for subsequent
times) in each track you want to write to by clicking the Automation
selector.
You can find the Automation selector in the Edit window (Book 2,
Chapter 4).
5. Click Play in the Transport Window (or press the Spacebar on your
keyboard) to start your session.

6. Carefully move the control for the parameters you want to automate.
7. Click Stop in the Transport window (or press the Spacebar on your

Your automation shows up as a line with breakpoints (little dots) in the
track’s playlist, as long as you have the automation view visible. If it’s 
not visible, click on the Track View selector in the Track Controls section
of the Edit window to open the Track view pop-up menu and select the

you want to view.
Viewing Automation
You can view automation data for a particular parameter by selecting the
parameter name in the Track View selector in the Edit window, as shown in
Figure 6-5. 
Drawing Automation
Aside from being able to record automation data by moving the parameter
as your session plays — as I covered in the chapter up to this point — you
can manually draw automation using the Pencil tool. This can be handy for
you visual people (you now who you are) who prefer to see what they’re
doing — just be sure you know what it’s going to sound like. It is music after
all. Seriously, using the Pencil tool to draw automation can make creating
fades or correcting previously drawn automation data quick and easy.
Select a parameter name here.

Drawing Automation
584
You can draw your automation using the Pencil tool in the Edit window.
The Pencil tool lets you draw five different shapes, as shown in Figure
6-6: you access the various pencil shapes by click-holding the Pencil Tool
✦Freehand: With this tool, you can freely draw automation curves — the
changes to the settings for your automation data. If you’re automating
an audio track, the shape of the curve you draw determines the number
of breakpoints (discrete levels) Pro Tools creates; MIDI tracks follow the
preferences you set in the MIDI tab of the Preferences dialog box.
Here’s how you specify that MIDI setting: Choose Setups➪Preferences from
the main menu, click the MIDI tab, and then enter a value in the Pencil Tools
Resolution When Drawing Controller Data box.
✦Line: This tool draws a straight line. For audio tracks you get two break-
points — one at the beginning and one at the end. MIDI tracks create
breakpoints based upon the resolution setting in the MIDI tab of the
Preferences dialog box.
✦Triangle: This tool creates a sawtooth pattern that follows the current
grid value. As was the case with the Line tool, audio tracks contain two
breakpoints — one at the beginning and one at the end of each line —
while MIDI tracks are stepped according to the resolution you set in the
MIDI tab of Preferences dialog box.
✦Square: This tool draws a square pattern that repeats according to the
current grid setting. 
✦Random: This tool creates random levels that change according to the
grid value.
So here’s where automation gets visual and, well, kind of magical. To use the
Pencil tool to draw automation, follow these steps:

1. In the Edit window, click the Track view selector in the Track Controls
section of the Edit window to access the Track View pop-up menu and
then select the automation parameter you want. 
The waveform fades in the track’s playlist and the automation line
appears.
2. Click and hold the Pencil Tool icon until the pop-up menu appears;
then drag your mouse through the menu to choose the tool you want.
3. Click and drag within the automation line on the track’s playlist, at
the place where you want the data drawn.
The new automation data replaces any existing data.
Thinning Automation
When you write, automation breakpoints are created at a maximum density.
Depending on the shape of the curve, you may not need all these breakpoints
to get an accurate playback of your moves. Since every breakpoint requires
at least some computer memory, removing unnecessary breakpoints can be
helpful. This is called thinning and can be done either automatically or with
the help of the Thin Command.
Automatically thinning data
Pro Tools can automatically thin your automation data for you — immediately
after you write it. You can make it all happen from the Automation tab of the
Preferences dialog box. Open this menu by choosing Setups➪Preferences form
the main menu and then selecting the Automations tab.
From the Automations tab, you enable automatic thinning by checking the
Smooth and Thin Data After Pass box and choosing how much thinning 
you want by specifying an amount in the Degree of Thinning box. (Refer to
Figure 6-2.) The default setting in Pro Tools is Some — is that sufficiently
vague, or what?
You can always thin your automation data further — at any time — by using
the Thin Command. To be safe, I always keep this setting at either Little or
Some.
Using the Thin command
If the need for thinning doesn’t become apparent until well into your creative
process, you can use the Thin command to thin a selection at any time. To
do so, follow these steps:

Editing Automation Data
586
1. Display the automation data you want to thin using the Track View
selector located in the Track Control’s section of the Edit window. 
2. Using the Selector tool, select the section in the playlist you want
to thin. 
3. Choose Edit➪Thin Automation from the main menu.
To thin all data for your selected parameter in a track, press Command+A (on
a Mac) or Ctrl+A (on a PC) to select all the data and then choose Edit➪Thin
Automation from the main menu.
You select the degree of thinning in the Degree of Thinning box in the Auto-
mation tab of the Preferences dialog box. (Choose SetupsÍPreferences to
access the dialog box.)
To check your thinning — basically to make sure that it still sounds good —
play the thinned section. If you don’t like what you hear, you can choose
Edit➪Undo from the main menu to undo the thinning.
Editing Automation Data
There are a lot of ways to edit automation data after it’s been written. You can
use one of the Edit tools (Grabber, Pencil, Trimmer), you can cut/copy/paste,
and (of you want to get drastic) you can delete your automation. These options
are covered in this section.
Using editing commands
You can use standard Edit commands such as Cut, Copy, Delete, and Paste to
edit your automation data. To edit using these commands, you first have to
select the data. Here’s how:
1. Using the Track View selector in either the Edit or Mix window, dis-
play the automation parameter you want to edit.
2. Using the Selector tool, highlight the section in the playlist you
want to edit.
If you’re looking at the track in Waveform or Block view (for audio
tracks) — or in Block, Region, or Notes view (for MIDI tracks), your edits
will affect all automation data for the selected section. To edit an individ-
ual parameter, display it in the Track View.
Grouped audio tracks are all edited (except when you’re editing panning
data) when you select data from one track in a group. To edit only the data
on the selected track, press Start/Windows (on a Windows PC) or Command
(on a Mac) when you perform your edit.

Book VI
Chapter 6
Automating 
Your Mix
Editing Automation Data
587
Grouped MIDI tracks are edited individually (except for panning data) unless
you press Start/Windows (on a PC) or Command (on a Mac) as you perform
your edit.
Panning data works in two opposite ways for groups of audio tracks and MIDI
tracks. If you want to edit the panning data for a group of audio tracks, you
have to press Start/Windows (on a PC) or Command (on a Mac) as you edit —
which affects the entire group. Using this keystroke command (pressing Start/
Windows on a PC or Command on a Mac) on a group of MIDI tracks, however,
edits panning data one track at a time.
Cut and Delete
You get rid of unwanted stuff when you cut and delete automation data, but
the Cut and Delete commands treat the unwanted stuff a bit differently: 
✦Cut: When you cut a selection of automation data, Pro Tools automati-
cally adds two new breakpoints to your remaining data and places the
cut material in the Clipboard. The two new breakpoints are placed at the
beginning and end of the cut section. Any slope in automation curves
that exist before and after the cut section remain, as shown in Figure 6-7.
In Pro Tools, you cut by choosing Edit➪Cut from the main menu or by
pressing Command+X (on a Mac) or Ctrl+X (on a PC)
✦Delete: When you delete selected automation data, the remaining auto-
mation data connects at the nearest breakpoints. Any curves between
the breakpoints and the beginning or end of the deleted selection are
removed, as shown in Figure 6-8.
In Pro Tools, you delete by choosing Edit➪Delete from the main menu or
by pressing Backspace (on a PC) or Delete (on a Mac).

Copy
Choose Edit➪Copy from the main menu to place copied data in the Clipboard
so you can paste it somewhere else.
Paste
When you use Edit➪Paste from the main menu to paste selected automation
data in a new location, breakpoints are created at the beginning and end
points of the selection. These breakpoints make sure that the automation
levels and slope (change in level) that exist before the beginning and end
points of the pasted material remain the same, as shown in Figure 6-9.
Editing with (surprise) edit tools
You can use the editing tools located in the Edit window to change automa-
tion data within a track. The three tools you can use are the Grabber tool,
the Trimmer tool, and the Pencil tool. These are detailed in this section.
Grabber
The Grabber tools lets you move, add, and delete breakpoints. To per-
form these operations, do the following:

as you click.
✦Moving breakpoints: To move a breakpoint, click and drag it to where
you want it.
Pencil
You can add or delete breakpoints with the Pencil tool by doing the 
following:
✦Adding breakpoints: To add a breakpoint with the Pencil tool, click in
the automation line at the place where you want the new breakpoint.
✦Deleting breakpoints: To delete a breakpoint, put the Pencil tool on it
and press Alt (on a PC) or Option (on a Mac) as you click.
Trimmer
The Trimmer tool lets you move selected breakpoints up or down by
clicking and dragging them, as shown in Figure 6-10.
To move breakpoints left or right, select them using the Selector tool and,
using the number pad on your keyboard, press the minus key (–) to move
left or the plus key (+) to move right.

Chapter 7: Making Your Mix
In This Chapter
 Submixing your tracks 
 Mixing within Pro Tools
 Mixing to an external recorder
T
he final step in mixing your music involves taking all your EQed, panned,
processed, and automated tracks and recording them into a stereo pair
of tracks. This is often called bouncing your mix. In the old analog days,
bouncing meant sending all your tracks to either two separate tracks on the
same tape deck or to a different tape deck. Nowadays, with Pro Tools, you
can create bounces several ways — all of which are covered in this chapter. 
In this chapter, I lead you through the process of making your mix either
within Pro Tools (a method called in-the-box) or by sending your tracks out
to ether a digital or analog two-track machine (usually a DAT or — yes, even
today — reel-to-reel tape deck).
Unless you have a seriously great analog deck and you want to add some of
that sought-after “warmth-of-analog” tape sound to your final mix, your best
bet is to go with the in-the-box approach — using the Pro Tools Bounce to
Disk feature and keeping your music in your computer.
Submixing by Recording to Tracks
Submixing is the process of mixing some of your tracks down to one or two
additional tracks within your session. When you record to tracks, the sub-
mixed material automatically shows up in your session. You can then turn
off the voices of the tracks you submixed and control the resulting track(s)
from one (or two) fader(s). This is handy if . . .
✦You have more than 32 tracks (or 24 if you have an older version of Pro
Tools) in your song that you want to mix. For example, you can reduce
your track count by submixing your drums or backup vocals to two
tracks and using only those two for the final mix.
✦You have MIDI tracks and want to record the audio output from your
MIDI devices to audio tracks before doing your final mix. Your MIDI
tracks are just instrument-control data; they contain no recorded sound.
At some point in the process of mixing, you need to record the actual
audio output from your sound source to your audio tracks. 

Submixing by Recording to Tracks
592
✦You want to record your final mix in real time and still be able to move
the faders and other controls while your session plays. Some recordists
get antsy when Bounce-to-Disk mode (see “Mixing in the Box,” later in
this chapter) creates the bounce offline; it prevents them from adjusting
any controls as the mix is created. (Hey, call it a control issue.)
To create a submix by recording to tracks, follow these steps:
1. Set your effects, panning, and EQ settings for the tracks you want to
submix.
2. Using the Output selector, assign the outputs for all tracks you want to
submix (including any auxiliary tracks that your Send effects are
routed to) to one of the stereo bus paths (buses 1 and 2 for instance).
3. Choose File➪New Track from the main menu.
The New Track dialog box appears.
4. Use the drop-down menus in the New Track dialog box to enter the
number of tracks you want (1), the type (Audio), and whether you
want your track in mono or stereo.
5. If you created a stereo track to submix to, set the panning of the right
track to hard right and that of the left track to hard left.
6. Set the Input selector for the new track you created in Step 4 to the
same bus path that you chose for the tracks you want to submix (buses
1 and 2, in this case).
7. Using the new track’s Output selector, select the main output for your
session as the output path for the track.
8. Make sure that your Edit and Timeline selections are linked by choos-
ing Operations➪Link Edit and Timeline Selections from the main
menu.
Linking Edit and Timeline selections means the Timeline selection range
follows the selection you make in a track’s playlist.
9. Using the Selector tool, select the section of the session that you want
to submix.
If you want to record the entire session, be sure to put your cursor at
the beginning of the session before you record it. If you want to record
only part of the session, select the part you want. (Book 4, Chapter 2
details this process.)
10. Click the Record Enable button on the new track. 
11. Click Record in the Transport window.
12. Click Play in the Transport window. 
The submix process begins.

13. Press Stop in the Transport window when you’re finished. (If you
selected part of the session to record, the session stops playing auto-
matically when it reaches the end of your selection.) 
Be sure to let the session play until the last bit of reverb or other effect
is finished playing.
Mixing in-the-Box
Mixing in-the-box refers to using the Bounce to Disk feature in Pro Tools to
create your final mix. The Bounce to Disk feature processes your audio
tracks in real time (you can hear the session as it plays) but offline (you
can’t manipulate any controls when the bounce is happening).
Pro Tools creates a new file with the settings you choose in the Bounce
dialog box. What you get is a file you can import back into your session so
you can play back your Bounced mix and evaluate how it sounds. The advan-
tage of using the Bounce to Disk feature over recording to tracks (described
earlier in “Submixing by Recording to Tracks”) is that you don’t need to have
any extra voices available to receive the bounced files.
Examining bounce options
You access the Bounce dialog box, shown in Figure 7-1, by choosing File➪
Bounce To Disk from the main menu. The dialog box lets you set the following
options:
✦Source: You can use the Bounce Source drop-down menu to select any
output or bus path as your source for the bounce. (Figure 7-2 gives you a
peek at some of the choices.) 
✦File Type: This drop-down menu sets the file type for the bounced file.
You have many choices — Book 2, Chapter 5 details them all — but for
your final mix, these common, Pro-Tools-supported file types are the
ones to choose from: 
BWF (WAV): This file type is the standard for older, PC-based Pro
Tools systems — and it’s currently the most commonly used file
type. (One reason: BWF files are compatible with both Macs and
PCs.) This is the type I generally choose.
AIFF: This stands for Audio Interchange File Format and used to be
native to Macs. AIFF files can be imported without converting into
any Pro Tools session — including those on a PC — but since BWF is
becoming the standard I skip this type. If you use a Mac and you plan
to do your mastering on your Mac using Pro Tools, this file type is a
fine choice.

✦Format: This drop-down menu determines whether your bounced file is
in Mono, Multiple Mono, or Stereo Interleaved. These formats do have
some differences that are good to know:
Mono (Summed): Choosing this option creates a single audio file that
contains all the material without any panning information.
Because any stereo information is summed, it’s easy to get too high of
a combined signal. This results in clipping (distortion). If you want to
record using this format, make sure that you reduce your levels so that
the left and right channels peak at no more than –3db, although –6dB
is better. (Book 6, Chapter 1 has more on setting levels.)
Multiple Mono: This format puts the left and right channels of your
stereo mix in separate files, labeling the files with (respectively) the
.L and .R filename extensions.
Multiple mono is the file format supported by Pro Tools — which
makes it the one to use if you intend to master your music yourself
within Pro Tools. If you plan to use a professional mastering engineer,
call him or her to see what file format works with the mastering
equipment. (It will either be multiple mono or stereo interleaved.)
Stereo Interleaved: This format contains all stereo information in a
single stereo file. Panning information is retained. Any tracks set to
even-numbered outputs end up on the right side of the stereo file;
tracks set to odd-numbered outputs go to the left side of the stereo
field.
✦Resolution: This setting lets you choose one of three bit rates for your
bounced files: 8, 16, or 24. (Book 1, Chapter 1 has more on resolution.)
For your final mix, choose 24 bit (maximum resolution). You can reduce
it as needed later on, when you master your music yourself or when you
have a professional do it for you.
✦Sample Rate: You can save your file with any of several sample rates,
but I recommend saving it with the same rate as the files in your session.
Check out Book 1, Chapter 2 for all the details about sample rates.
If you intend to have your music mastered by a professional, make sure to
ask her what she prefers. Some mastering engineers want the files at the
highest sample rate possible while others would rather have you not change
the rate. 
✦Conversion Quality: If you choose a sample rate different from the files
in your session — which I don’t recommend — you’re prompted to
choose a level of quality for the conversion. Choose the highest quality
possible for your mix material, but keep in mind that the higher the qual-
ity you choose, the longer it takes to do the conversion process.

Using an External Master Deck

Using an External Master Deck
You can mix to an external device instead of mixing within Pro Tools. This
section explains how to mix to both analog and digital recorders.
You can mix to an external digital device such as a DAT (Digital Audio Tape)
deck — or (for you “classic technology” fans) to an analog device such as a
reel-to-reel tape recorder — by following these steps:
1. Connect your device to your Digidesign interface. 
For digital recorders, run a cable from the digital outputs of the interface
to the digital inputs of your device. You’ll need to use either an optical
or coaxial connection, depending on the interface.
For analog recorders, run a cable from two of the analog outputs of the
interface to the inputs of your device.
2. If you want to be able to monitor this device as it records, connect the
device’s outputs to your monitors (speakers) or plug your headphones
into the headphone jack (if your device has one).
3. Using the Output selectors, set the output of your tracks, auxiliary
inputs, and master fader to the physical outputs of your interface.
These must correspond to the output you connected your device to.
4. Enable recording in your external device.
5. Click Play in the Transport window of your Pro Tools session.
6. Adjust your input levels on your external device.
7. Rewind the session.
8. Start recording on the external device and immediately press the
Spacebar on your computer keyboard or click Play in the Transport
window. 
The session plays and you record it into your external device.
9. Click Stop in the Transport window or press the Spacebar on your
keyboard when the music is done.
You now have a mix recorded into your external device. (Look out,
world, here it comes . . .)

Chapter 1: Mastering Basics
In This Chapter
 Understanding mastering
 Knowing when to master your music yourself
 Knowing when to send your music to a mastering house
You’ve spent a lot of time getting all your tracks recorded using the best
mics you can afford. (Mics you’ve carefully set up following the guide-
lines in Book 3, Chapter 2, I hope!) You adjusted your levels just right, EQed,
panned, and added effects to each instrument with great care so they fit per-
fectly in the mix. Now you have awesome-sounding music. So all that’s left is
to burn a CD, create cool cover artwork, make some copies, and you’re
ready to go platinum, right?
Well, you could do that, but you’d be missing one of the most important
steps in getting your music to sound its very best. This is the mastering
process. Mastering can turn your already-good music into a truly great CD.
The only problem is that most people have no idea what mastering is. It’s
been presented as some mysterious voodoo that only people who belong to
some secret society and have access to a magical pile of gear can do.
This isn’t the case. Mastering is, in fact, a pretty simple process, involving
some plug-ins in Pro Tools that you’ve already had a chance to use. Mastering
does require specialized skills, but you don’t need to go through any strange
initiation rites to learn them. All it takes is an idea of what to do, decent ears
(you’ve got a couple of those, right?), and a dose of patience while you work
your way through the process.
In this chapter, you get a chance to understand the “magic” that is master-
ing. You discover what’s involved in mastering your music. You explore
ways to make sure your music is ready to master and discern when it might
be best to find a professional to do the job for you.
Demystifying Mastering
The mastering process of recording involves preparing your music for dupli-
cation. Several steps are involved in taking your songs from individual,
mixed tunes to part of a whole album. First, you need to optimize the
dynamics and tonal balance of each song, and then process the songs so

Demystifying Mastering
600
they are matched in volume to each other. These steps usually involve put-
ting the songs through some EQing, compressing, limiting, and sometimes
expanding.
You also need to sequence your music — put your songs in the best order
possible, with an appropriate amount of time between songs. Your last step
is to put your mastered music into a format — and a medium — that enables
you to duplicate and distribute (hey, even sell!) it. This format and medium
is usually a CD. (I describe this process in detail in Book 8, Chapter 1.)
Processing
No matter how well you recorded and mixed your music, you still need to do
some processing during the mastering stage. This usually consists of adjust-
ing levels with compression, limiting, EQing, and (if needed) additional pro-
cessing. Luckily, all this can be done right in Pro Tools, using the plug-ins
that came with the software. The plug-ins you’ll use when mastering are cov-
ered in detail in Book 6, Chapters 3 and 4.
The purpose of the processing stage is to do the following:
✦Balance the overall tonal characteristics of each song.
✦Optimize the dynamics of each song so all the songs are at their best
overall volume.
You can achieve these goals by using the following tools:
✦Compression: Some music sounds best when it’s smooth, and other
music is much better when it has a punchy quality to it. Judicious use
of a Pro Tools Compressor plug-in can produce either of these effects.
A good mastering engineer knows when and how to make music punchy
or smooth. (Sorry, you can’t have both at the same time.)
✦Limiters: If any instruments are too high in comparison to the rest of the
mix, then a Pro Tools Limiter plug-in can tame them so you get the best
overall difference between the songs’ peak levels and average levels.
This difference varies depending on the style of music, but it should
never be less than 6dB and is usually between 12dB and 18dB. (For more
on limiter plug-ins, see Book 6, Chapter 4.)
✦EQ: Because you recorded and mixed each of your songs individually
over a period of time (often a long period of time), chances are that each
song sounds a little different. Some may be brighter than others, some
may be heavier on bass, but one thing’s for sure — each will have a dif-
ferent tonal quality.

Mastering Basics
Getting Ready to Master
601
Sequencing
Sequencing involves putting your songs in the order that you want and set-
ting the blank space between each song so that the CD flows well from one
song to another. Because a CD is supposed to represent a cohesive body of
work, this is one of the most important aspects of mastering.
Leveling
A crucial aspect of mastering a CD is getting the levels of all the songs to be
the same. After all, you don’t want your listener to adjust the volume of his
stereo from one song to another. Having consistent levels from song to song
helps with the cohesiveness and flow of a CD. This is done with simple gain
adjustments, compressors, and/or limiters — and by making those processes
consistent, Pro Tools gives us mere mortals a crack at doing it right. 
Getting Ready to Master
You can save yourself a ton of time and energy when mastering your music if
you keep a few things in mind during the mixing stage. When you’re wearing
your Mixing Master hat, the following reminders can make the mastering
process go a bit more smoothly:
✦Check your levels. Listen to your mix quietly and you can tell whether
one instrument sticks out too much in the mix. Also, burn a CD of your
mixed song to test on other systems (your car, a boom box, your friend’s
stereo system). Listen carefully. If the bass drum is even slightly too
loud, it eats up headroom that the rest of the instruments need — so
you can’t get the overall volume of the song very high.
✦Check your EQ. Even though the mastering engineer (you or a pro) EQs
the entire song, the time you spent getting each instrument EQed in the
mix is still a good investment. If you didn’t get your EQ just right during
the mixing process and (for example) a muddy bass guitar sound has to
be EQed during mastering, you lose some of the low end on all the
instruments. This makes your mix sound thin. If your bass is EQed prop-
erly in the first place, you don’t have to make that adjustment to the
entire mix.
✦Test your mix in mono (turn off the stereo panning on your master
bus). This helps you hear whether any instrument’s volume or tonal
characteristics are seriously out of balance with others. I never consider
a mix finished until I monitor it in mono.
✦Apply compression on your mix before you record the two-track mix
just to see what your music sounds like compressed. Don’t record the
compression, though. Leave that for the mastering stage. By testing your

Paying a Pro or Doing It Yourself
602
mix with some compression, you may hear whether certain instru-
ments are too loud in the mix — if so, they become more apparent
when compressed.
✦Listen for phase holes. Phase holes occur when you record an instru-
ment (piano, backup vocals) in stereo and the left and right tracks are
out of phase. To listen for phase holes, pay attention to how the instru-
ment sounds in the stereo field. You have a phase hole if you hear sound
coming only from the far right and far left and nothing seems to be
coming from the center of the stereo field. If you have this problem, all
you have to do is reverse the phase on one of the two channels for that
instrument.
Paying a Pro or Doing It Yourself
Whether to master your music yourself or to hire a professional may be one
of your toughest music-making decisions. If you master your music yourself,
you can have complete control from start to finish and save yourself some
bucks. On the other hand, if you hand your mixed music over to a skilled
professional, you can have the added benefit of another person’s ears and
advice, and you can end up with a finished product that far exceeds your
expectations.
So how do you choose?
Well, your first consideration is probably based upon economics — do you
have the money to spend on professional help (for your music, that is)?
Mastering can cost anywhere from a couple hundred to thousands of dollars.
A midline mastering engineer often charges around $500 to master your CD
(about ten songs). This may seem like a lot of money, but if you find the right
engineer for your music, it can make the difference between a decent CD and
a truly world-class one.
Another consideration for hiring out your mastering is how well you know
your equipment and how capable it is of performing the mastering proce-
dure. To do mastering, you need at least one good (well, preferably great)
multiband compressor, a limiter, and a great multiband parametric EQ. The
plug-ins that come with Pro Tools can get you most of the way to a great-
sounding master. If you really get into mastering in Pro Tools, you can add
some third-party plug-ins (such as the Waves or PSP Audioware brands) that
offer better sound and more flexibility. You also need to have a CD burner of
some sort and the software to create a Red Book CD master. (More about CD
burners and Red Book standards in Book 8, Chapter 1.)

Book VII
Chapter 1
Mastering Basics
Hiring a Professional Mastering Engineer
603
Before you decide, take a look at other benefits of hiring a skilled profes-
sional to do your mastering:
✦A meticulously tuned room and top-notch monitors so you can hear
what your music actually sounds like.
✦Equipment specifically designed to handle the process of mastering. The
EQs, compressors, and other gear that the mastering house uses can
tweak your music so it can sound its best.
✦A fresh set of professional ears that may be able to hear things in your
mix that need fixing. You may be so close to the project that you have a
hard time hearing your mix objectively.
Hiring a Professional Mastering Engineer
If you do decide to use a professional mastering engineer, the following tips
can help you choose one for your project:
✦Ask around for referrals. If you know local bands or musicians whose
music you like and whose CDs sound great, ask them who mastered
their music. Call local studios and find out whom they recommend for
mastering in your area. Also check out resources on the Internet. Two
great Internet forums are: www.musicplayer.com/cgi-bin/ultimate
bb.cgi recpit.prosoundweb.com/. In a forum, do a search for the
term mastering or post a new topic and ask your question. Try to get
referrals from people who work with your type of music.
✦Listen to other recordings that the mastering house has done in a style
of music similar to yours. If you’re entrusting your artistic vision to
someone else, make sure that this person is the right person for the job.
If you like what the prospective mastering engineer has done on other
people’s music, you’ll probably like what he or she does with yours.
✦Clarify what the fee for your project will be before you actually start
working together. Most mastering engineers charge by the hour and can
give you a pretty good estimate of how many hours they’ll need to do
the job. You’ll also be expected to pay for materials (reference CDs, for
example).
✦If you don’t like the way the engineer mastered your music, you’ll
probably be charged at the hourly rate to redo it. Some engineers may
redo your project for free, but don’t count on it. Be sure to discuss this
possibility before you start the project to avoid unwanted surprises.

Hiring a Professional Mastering Engineer
604
Many mastering engineers will do a demo for you, tooling up one or two
songs so you can hear what kind of job they can do for your music before
you hire them. Ask whether the mastering engineer you’re interested in
offers this service. This simple step can save both you and the engineer a lot
of time and energy if he or she isn’t right for the job. It can also help you
determine whether your mixed music is ready for mastering — if you need to
go back and make adjustments, now’s the time to find out.
After you choose the mastering engineer that you think will work well for
you and your music, you can make the process much easier and less stress-
ful (for both you and the engineer) if you follow a few guidelines:
✦Discuss your expectations and desires. This is the best way to ensure
that your mastered music turns out the way you want. People who are
unhappy with the job that the mastering engineer does usually aren’t
clear about what they want or don’t understand what is possible in the
mastering process.
✦Take a few CDs whose sound you like with you to the mastering ses-
sion. Talk with the engineer about how you can get your music to sound
similar. A skilled engineer can let you know right away whether the
sound you want is possible.
✦Try to be present at the mastering session. Many people send their
music to a mastering engineer and expect him or her to do the job 
without their presence in the studio. Try to go to the studio, but if you
can’t, be sure that the engineer clearly understands your desires and
expectations.
If you’re in the studio during the mastering process and things aren’t going
the way you want, talk with the engineer and try to get things on track again.
If you’re finding that you’re unable to communicate with the engineer, stop
the session, have him burn a ref (reference copy), pay for the time you’ve
used, and listen to the ref at home. If you don’t like what you hear at home,
then you may be best off going somewhere else with your music.
A right balance does exist between what you can achieve on your own with
your Pro Tools skills and the benefits that professional mastering can bring
to your finished product. The balance is well worth finding.

 Converting your song files
 Processing your production 
 Sequencing your songs
You’ve done everything else yourself, so why not master your music,
too? Well, I hear ya. Even though I’m a firm believer in the magic that a
professional mastering engineer can bring to a production — check out
Book 7, Chapter 1 for my take on that — I’m also a do-it-yourself kinda guy. If
you’re like me, then you at least need to give mastering a shot. After all,
there’s nothing to lose — only a little time — and everything to gain (or at
least learn from).
This chapter walks you through the process of mastering your music in Pro
Tools. I offer some general guidelines that you can keep in mind as you work
and get you up to speed on mastering your music yourself. I also show you
how to set up your mastering session in Pro Tools.
The Pro Tools mastering steps given here use the Bounce to Disk function.
You do not necessarily have to go this route. If you want, you can also send
your mastered tracks out to a digital device by following the steps in this
chapter — and then use the steps that describe mixing to an external digital
device (found in Book 6, Chapter 7).
Considering General Guidelines
In other chapters, I present some specific techniques and settings to get you
started. Unfortunately, I can’t do that when it comes to mastering — there
are just too many variables. That also means too many ways to mess up
your music when you’re trying to master it. What I can do (and actually do)
in the upcoming sections is walk you through the process of mastering and
show you the tools to use for each step. When you’re reading these sec-
tions, keep the following in mind:
✦Less is more when mastering. Do as little as possible to your music. All
you really should need to do when you’re mastering is optimize the
dynamics and tonal balance of each song, get the levels between the

Setting up a Mastering Session
606
songs even, and sequence your songs. If you find yourself doing more —
having to make a lot of adjustments, for example — you might want to
go back to the mixing process and try again.
✦Mastering is all about compromise. Each adjustment you make to your
mixed music affects all the instruments. If you use EQ to get rid of mud-
diness on the bass guitar, you affect not only the bass guitar, but also
every other instrument in the mix.
✦Don’t try to master a song right after you mix it. Give yourself time and
space away from that song before you do anything else to it. In fact, I
recommend that you take a few days away from any of the songs on your
album between the mixing and mastering stages. A little time to reflect
and rest your ears can do wonders for your ability to hear what your
music needs.
✦You can only really master music effectively if your monitors and
monitoring environment are great. Without a good reference for how
your music sounds, trying to EQ or dynamically process your music
does no good. The music may sound good through your speakers but if
they aren’t accurate, it probably doesn’t through others’. Before you
master, make your room sound as good as you can and get to know the
strengths and weaknesses of your monitoring environment by listening
to a ton of commercial CDs that have a sound like the one you’re trying
to get.
Setting up a Mastering Session
The first step in mastering your music in Pro Tools is to set up a mastering
session. This involves creating a new Pro Tools session and importing the
mixed tracks from each song you want on your CD. This section of the chap-
ter details that process.
Start by creating a new session for mastering:
1. Choose File➪New Session from the main menu.
The New Session dialog box appears.
2. Type in the name of the file in the Save As field. 
I usually call it mastering and include the name of the CD project that
I’m working on.
3. In the Where field, choose the folder you want to place the new 
session in. 
I usually create a new folder called mastered mixes so it’s easy to find
the files later when I burn them to CD.

Book VII
Chapter 2
Mastering 
Your Music

607
4. Choose the session parameters that match the mixed files for your
songs.
We’re talking audio file type, sample rate, I/O settings, and bit depth
here. Book 2, Chapter 3 has more on the basics of setting up a new 
session.
5. Click Save.
Your new session opens.
Okay, at this point you have a general “same place” to put the songs. Next,
create tracks to import the mixed song files into:
1. Choose File➪New Track from the main menu.
The New Track dialog box appears.
2. In the Create field, enter a number corresponding to the number of
songs you want on your CD. Then choose Stereo and Audio Track
from the drop-down menus.
3. Click Create.
Your session now has the necessary tracks for importing your audio.
With tracks created, you can now import your mixed tracks into this session:
1. Click-hold the Audio title bar from the top of the Audio Regions list
and choose Import Audio from the pop-up menu that appears.
If the Audio Regions list isn’t visible, click the double arrow at the
bottom-right corner of the Edit window or press Shift+Command+I 
(on a Mac) or Shift+Control+I (on a PC). 
The Import Audio dialog box opens.
2. Using the Look In field, navigate through your folder structure to find
and select the song file you want to import. 
3. Click Done. 
The file appears as a region in the Audio Regions list.
4. Repeat Steps 1-3 for each song you want to master in this session.
Finally, place your audio regions into the tracks in the session:
1. Click-drag the region from the Audio Regions list into the playlist of
the track you want the song in.
2. Repeat Step 1 for each of your songs, so that you end up with only one
song in each of the available tracks. 

Optimizing Dynamics
608
You now have a session that contains all the songs for your project. Having
them all in one session allows you to switch from one song to the next as
you master your tunes and makes it easy to check loudness levels and EQ
balancing as you work. (See the “Perfecting Tonal Balance” and “Balancing
Levels” sections, later in this chapter.)
Optimizing Dynamics
Okay, this is where the magic in mastering happens. This is where you can
make your music shine or where you can royally mess it up. (How’s that for
adding a little pressure?) Before you get tense (okay, breathe), remember
that you can always go back and try again. Oh, did I mention that you should
make backup copies of your individual tracks and your final mix? Well, if
you haven’t already done the backing-up business, now would be a good
time to do that. I’ll wait.
You done? Okay, now to the job at hand — getting your music to be as loud
as possible. (I’m just kidding; see the sidebar “Turn it up!” to see why.)
Seriously, optimizing the dynamics of your songs doesn’t mean getting it
loud enough to level a city block, but rather getting it to have life and emo-
tion. And, yes, this also means getting it to be loud enough to sound good.
The style of your music and the arrangements that you use determine how
you optimize the dynamics of your music. For example, classical music has a
much broader dynamic range than rock music, and the infamous “wall of
sound” type of arrangement has a narrower dynamic range than a song with
sparse verses and thicker choruses. 
When you’re optimizing the dynamics of your music, be sensitive to the song
and try not to get sucked into the idea that you need to get the most volume
out of your music. I know I’m beating this volume thing into the ground, but
you’d be surprised how seductive the lure of Big Volume can be. (“C’mon,
let’s get just a few more dBs out of the song . . .” trust me, you’ll soon find out.)
You have two main types of tools to use when you work on the dynamics
during mastering in Pro Tools — compressor plug-ins and a limiter plug-ins —
and each has its purpose. For the most part, if you’re trying to add punch or
smoothness to your music, a compressor plug-in does the job nicely. On the
other hand, if you’re trying to squeeze a little more volume out of a song and
you don’t want to change the song’s sound quality, a limiter plug-in is your
best choice.
Here are suggestions that might help you to use compression and limiting
most effectively during mastering:

Book VII
Chapter 2
Mastering 
Your Music
Optimizing Dynamics
609
✦Use a mild compression ratio (between 1.1:1 and 2:1) to keep from over-
compressing your music.
✦Apply only 1 or 2dB of compression or limiting at one time. If you need
more than that, chain more than one compressor together by inserting
more than one compressor plug-in in your track and use these small
amounts on each. If you compress or limit more than 1 or 2dB at a time,
you end up with artifacts (audible changes to your music caused by the
compressor or limiter). 
✦Work with your attack and release times. An attack that’s too short takes
the punch out of your music by cutting off the initial transients. Likewise,
a release time that’s too long doesn’t recover quickly enough, and the
dynamics of the vocal disappear. In contrast, if the release time is too
short, you hear distortion.
✦Set the threshold so your compressor’s meters dance (bounce) to the
rhythm of the music. The meter you want to watch in your Pro Tools
compressor plug-in is the one labeled “reduction,” located below the
input and output meters. Only the loudest notes (snare drum or lead
vocal accents, for example) should trigger the meters — and then only
by one or two dB. 
✦A multiband compressor allows you to bring out individual instruments
in the mix. For example, if the bass drum seems to be getting lost, you
can apply mild compression to the lower frequencies (around 80 to 
100 Hz). This brings the instrument forward in the mix slightly.
Pro Tools LE doesn’t come with a multiband compressor plug-in. If you
want to use one on your music, you need to get a third-party RTAS 
plug-in. Check out the Digidesign User’s Conference (DUC) at duc.digi
design.com/ for some options.
✦When you’re not sure if what you’re doing sounds better, don’t use the
processor. Any dynamics processing is going to affect the quality of your
song’s sound to some extent. If adding this processing doesn’t improve
the overall sound, you’re better off not using it.
You can find out more about compression and limiting in Book 6, Chapter 4.
When you’re testing your compressor plug-in or limiter plug-in settings (you
do this by comparing the processed and unprocessed versions), be sure to
have the volume of both versions exactly the same. Any difference in volume
defeats the purpose of side-by-side comparison because people almost
always prefer the louder version whether or not it sounds better.

Perfecting Tonal Balance

Perfecting Tonal Balance
The tonal balance of a song is how the various frequencies of the music
relate to one another. You’re not concerned with how each individual instru-
ment sounds in the mix (that’s the job for the mixing stage); instead, what
you’re looking for is an overall balance of frequencies within the hearing
spectrum.
For the most part, a tonal balance consists of an even distribution of fre-
quencies from 20 to 10 kHz with a slight drop-off (1 or 2dB) from 10 to 20 kHz
or higher. That’s great, you say, but what does that sound like? Well, listen to
any number of great CDs, and you’ll hear it.
When you master your music, you want to constantly compare what your
song sounds like to other CDs whose sound you like. In Book 6, Chapter 1, 
I list a variety of excellent reference CDs for mixing. These CDs work just as
well for mastering, so check them out.
When you work on adjusting the overall tonal balance of your songs, listen
carefully for any frequencies that seem too loud or too soft. You can find
these by listening to particular instruments in the mix or by using the para-
metric EQ plug-in and sweeping the frequency spectrum. To do this, set your
Turn it up!
Everyone wants his or her music to be as loud
as possible. Louder sounds better. In fact, test
after test has shown that when people listen to
two versions of a song, they nearly always
prefer the louder one (whether it actually
sounds better or not).
Musicians, producers, and engineers seem to
be in the middle of a competition to see who
can make the loudest CD. If you compare a CD
made about ten years ago with one made this
year, you’ll notice that the newer one is much
louder. Give them both a good listen, though.
Does the louder one really sound better?
You can test this by setting them both to play at
the same volume and switching back and forth.
(You need to turn the volume up a bit on the
older CD to match the volume of the newer
one.) One way to do this is to record both songs
into Pro Tools and set the levels of each so that
they’re the same. At the same volume, which
song sounds better to you? I’m willing to bet
that, nine out of ten times, you’ll prefer the older
song. This is because older recordings have
more dynamic range than newer ones. The
variety is pleasing to listen to, whereas the
song with only a small dynamic range quickly
becomes tiring. 
Do yourself and your listeners a favor and resist
the temptation to compress the dynamic vari-
ability out of your music. It will be much easier
to listen to and have a lot more life and excite-
ment. You can always turn the volume up on
your stereo if it’s not loud enough, but you can’t
add dynamic range after you’ve squashed 
it out.

Q fairly wide (0.6, for instance) and move the Gain slider all the way the
right. Start with the lowest frequency and slowly raise the frequency as the
song plays by moving the Freq slider from left to right. Adjust any annoying
frequencies by cutting them by a couple of dBs to see if your overall mix
improves.
As far as general EQ guidelines go, try these suggestions: 
✦If your mix sounds muddy, add high frequencies (above 10 kHz) or cut
low ones (200 to 400 Hz). Likewise, if your mix is too bright (common
with digital recording), try reducing the frequencies above 10 kHz by
using a shelf EQ or a Baxandall curve.
(To use a Baxandall curve, use a parametric EQ and set the threshold at
20 kHz with a Q setting around 1. This gradually cuts frequencies above
around 10 kHz. You can adjust the Q to reach as far down as you want.
Your EQ graph shows you what’s happening.)
✦Use the same EQ adjustments for both the right and left channels
because this keeps the stereo balance intact and doesn’t alter the rela-
tive phase between the channels. For example, if you add some bass fre-
quencies (100 Hz, for example) to the one channel and not the other, you
may hear a wavering or pulsating sound around this frequency go back
and forth between the speakers.
✦If you used a multiband compressor on any specific frequencies, you
may need to adjust the EQ for those frequencies; compression tends to
mess with frequency response.
Pro Tools LE doesn’t come with a multiband compressor plug-in. If you
want to use one on your music, you need to get a third-party RTAS plug-
in for Pro Tools. Check out the Digidesign Users’ Conference (DUC) at
duc.digidesign.com/ for some options.
✦If you need to adjust the EQ of certain instruments in the mix (the snare
drum is buried, for example), be careful and notice the overall effect of
your adjustments on the rest of the mix. If your adjustments aren’t fixing
the problem, go back to the mixing process and make your adjustments
there. You’ll be glad you took the time to do that.
Any adjustments you make to the EQ during mastering impact more
than just those frequencies. Such adjustments alter the entire frequency
spectrum — and the relationship between all the instruments. So listen
carefully as you make adjustments and back off on the additional EQ if
you don’t like what you hear.
For more specific information on EQ and inserting EQ in your tracks, go to
Book 6, Chapter 3.

Balancing Levels
612
Some people check the tonal balance of their songs against that of their
favorite CDs. You do this by recording a song into your mastering program
and taking a look at its frequency response by using a spectral analyzer.
(Pro Tools doesn’t come with a spectral analyzer, but you can buy one as a
third-party plug-in — look for an RTAS version to ensure that it works with
Pro Tools.) Then do an analysis of your song and compare it to the spectral
analysis of a CD you like. This technique seems to work for many people
(not me — I like using my ears instead — but alas, I’m old-fashioned).
Balancing Levels
For a truly professional-sounding CD, you want all your songs to be at nearly
the same relative level so your listeners (I hope you have more than one)
don’t have to adjust the volume on their stereos from song to song.
Balancing the levels of your songs to one another is pretty easy. In fact, in
most cases, you have very little to do after you EQ and optimize the dynam-
ics of each song. You balance the levels from one song to the next in Pro
Tools by putting each track’s fader up to 0dB — this puts them at the level
you mixed them to — and then soloing Track 1 and comparing the level to
Track 2 by soloing back and forth. 
If you use a mouse to mix, this can be kinda tricky because you can’t press
more than one button at a time. The best way I’ve found to deal with this
situation is to follow these steps:
1. In the Track Controls section of Track 1, click the Solo button to solo
the track.
You hear only Track 1 in your monitors.
2. In the Track Controls section of Track 1, click the Mute button so both
the Solo and Mute buttons for Track 1 are engaged.
Track 1 is silent.
3. In the Track Controls section of Track 2, quickly click the Solo button.
You now hear Track 2.
4. To switch back to hearing Track 1, click Track 2’s Solo button (disen-
gage it) and — as quickly as possible — click Track 1’s Mute button
(disengaging the Mute button and engaging the Solo button).
You hear Track 1 again.
You get a short bit of silence when following this procedure but you’ll still be
able to hear the relative volumes of the two.

Book VII
Chapter 2
Mastering 
Your Music
Mastering Your Mix
613
Do this procedure for each of the tracks (Track 1 to Track 2, Track 2 to Track 3,
and so on) until you’ve checked all the tracks in your mastering session.
If you miss one of the buttons while you’re doing this quick-switch proce-
dure, you may end up with both tracks playing at the same time. This will be
very loud because the tracks are summed together in the mix bus. To avoid
damaging your speakers — or ears — keep your monitoring (speaker) volume
down pretty low.
If you notice any differences, just raise (or better yet, lower) the levels until
they are all roughly the same. Don’t get too finicky. Some variation from song
to song is okay. In fact, minor differences can help to make your CD more
interesting to listen to. When you’re balancing levels, just make sure that any
differences aren’t enough to make the listener run to his or her stereo to
adjust the volume knob. If one or two songs seem much lower in volume
than the rest, you may want to go back to the volume-optimizing stage and
raise those songs up a bit to make them more consistent with the rest of the
songs on the CD. That way you don’t lower the volume of the entire CD
because one or two songs are too quiet.
Mastering Your Mix
Once you have all your songs dynamically optimized, EQed and level-bal-
anced (see previous sections) you’re ready to record your final master. This
process is essentially the same as making your final mix, so check out Book 6,
Chapter 7 for the steps to do this. There is one more thing you need to do
when mastering however — this involves getting your songs to the CD
format.
Most likely, your session’s songs are recorded at 24 bits, using any number
of possible sample rates (44.1, 48, 88.2, or 96 kHz) — and your final master
should be 16-bit at 44.1 kHz. Making this change can reduce the sound qual-
ity of your music if it’s not done right. This section details how to change the
sample rate and bit depth as you create a final master version of your music.
Making the most of your bits
Getting your music from 24-bit to 16-bit means either dithering or truncating
your files. This section explains how these processes differ, and gives you
pointers on which one to use so your music sounds as good as possible.
Dithering
Dithering is the process of adding random noise to your music when 8 bits
get cut from your pristine 24-bit files. This random noise helps keep the
quiet sections of your song (fades-outs, for instance) from sounding grainy

Mastering Your Mix
614
when those 8 bits are removed. There are several types of dithering — and
each produces a slightly different result in a piece of music.
Pro Tools comes with two dithering plug-ins — Dither and POWr Dither —
and each plug-in has different noise-shaping options (noise-shaping uses fil-
ters to move the random noise to inaudible frequencies). I’m confident that
you’ll find at least one of them works well for your music. Figure 2-1 shows
these plug-ins.
To dither your songs, simply insert one of the two dithering plug-ins into one
of the inserts in your master fader, and then follow the steps (detailed in
Book 6, Chapter 7) for mixing your music. The dithering happens automati-
cally as your song is mixed (or, in this case, mastered).
Truncation
Truncation involves simply cutting off the last 8 bits of information. This
option works well for material that doesn’t have quiet sections (for example,
hard rock with punchy endings that don’t fade out).
To master your music using truncation, follow the steps in Book 6, Chapter 7
for mixing your song and choose 16-bit as your Bounce to Disk resolution —
or use one of the digital outputs to send your signal out of Pro Tools. Either
technique cuts off the last 8 bits without otherwise processing the signal
(which makes this process different from dithering).
To dither or not to dither (and which dithering option to use)? That is the
question. No universal answer exists. The only way to know which sounds
better on your music is to try each of them. For the most part, songs with
quiet passages and fade-outs often sound better if you dither ’em.

ing plug-ins:

Mastering to 16 bits
When you master — regardless of whether you’re using the dithering
approach — make sure you select the 16-bit option under the Resolution
pop-up menu (located in the Bounce dialog box, as shown in Figure 2-2). If
you have a dithering plug-in inserted into your master fader, your music is
dithered while it’s being bounced; if you don’t use a dithering plug-in, your
music is truncated.
Settling on a sample rate
If you recorded at any sample rate other than 44.1kHz, you need to do a
sample-rate conversion (SRC) process. SRC can change the sound of your
song (and not for the better). Your best bet when bouncing from one sample
rate to another is to set the conversion quality as high as possible. The fol-
lowing steps show how:
1. Choose Setups➪Preferences from the main menu.
The Preferences dialog box appears.
2. Click on the Edit tab of the Preferences dialog box.
3. Click the Conversion Quality pop-up menu in the center of the Edit
tab, as shown in Figure 2-3, and choose TweakHead if you want the
highest quality possible. 
It takes a while to process (go get a cup of coffee or read your favorite
gear magazine while you wait) but I think it’s worth it.

You have several options for sample-rate conversion quality. Don’t take my
anal-retentive word for which works best for your music. Do some experi-
menting on your own. One of the lower-quality conversion settings may
work just fine (and you won’t have to wait so long while your song is being
processed).
When you actually bounce your song to disk, you need to choose 44.1kHz
from the Sample Rate pop-up menu located in the center of the Bounce
dialog box, as shown in Figure 2-4.

Sequencing Your Songs
617
Sequencing Your Songs
Sequencing your songs consists of choosing the order of the songs on the CD
as well as the amount of silence between songs. Chances are, when you
wrote and recorded your songs, you had an idea about the order in which
you wanted them to appear on your final CD. If you don’t know how you
want to arrange your songs, here are some things to consider:
✦Consider each song’s tempo in the sequencing equation. Some CDs work
well if songs with a similar tempo are grouped together, while others
work best when contrasting songs follow one another.
✦Think about a song’s lyrics and how they relate to the lyrics from the
other songs on your CD. If you want to tell your listener a story, consider
how the order of the songs can best tell that story.
✦Think about the chords that you used in each song and how they relate
to another song you might want to place before or after it in the
sequence. The ending chord of one song might conflict with the begin-
ning chord of another — or lead right in.
For most of us, sequencing has more to do with the actual process of placing
each song in its proper place on the CD than with trying to decide where that
proper place may actually be. I cover that process in detail in this section.
Most of the sequencing process involves deciding how much time to place
between the songs on your CD. No set amount of time has to be placed
between songs. Choose what seems right for the two songs you’re working
with. Sometimes you may want just a second or two; other times four or five
seconds is more appropriate. For example, if you have a mellow ballad fol-
lowed by an upbeat song, you may want to leave a little more time between
these two songs so the listener is prepared for the faster song (try leaving
a space that lasts about four to six beats at the slower song’s tempo, for
instance). On the other hand, if you want two tunes to flow together, you can
leave less time in between. Use your ears and think about how you want
your listener to respond when the music moves from one song to another.
You don’t sequence your songs in Pro Tools; instead, this is done within the
CD-burning program you use. Once you’ve bounced your mastered tracks in
Pro Tools to 16-bit files with a 44.1 kHz sampling rate, you can then import
them into your CD-burning software and arrange them the way you want
them. This includes both arranging the order of the songs and setting the
amount of silence between songs. Check out your CD-burning program for
specifics on how it handles these operations.

O
ne of the coolest things about audio recording nowadays is that you
can create music in your home and put it on the same medium that
the biggest record companies use. When I started as a recording engineer,
the best you could do was put your music on cassette for other people to
listen to. Pressing vinyl was expensive. But now anyone with a computer, a
CD burner, and a few inexpensive CD-Rs can put his or her music on the
same format as all the best albums in the record store. You gotta love it!
In this chapter, you explore how to make CDs of your music. You discover
the best CD-Rs to buy, and you get a chance to burn a CD. You also find out
how to submit your mastered CD to a company that can mass-produce your
music and make it ready to sell. All that’s left are some ideas for promoting
your packaged product, which you can find in this chapter as well.
Getting into CD Burning
Since you’re recording in your computer with Pro Tools, chances are you
have a computer with a CD-R or CR-RW drive. If so, then you also have soft-
ware that you can use to burn your CDs. Most CD-burning software works
fine for putting your mastered music onto CDs. If you don’t already have a
burner and want to add one to your existing computer, check the system
requirements for the burner that interests you to make sure that your
system is capable of using it. For audio CDs, you can use just about any CD
burner on the market (as long as it’s compatible with your system, of
course).

Purchasing CD-Rs
622
Regardless of the CD burner you get, make sure that it can create a Red Book
CD. I know that this sounds mysterious, but all the Red Book term means is
that the CD is an audio CD, not a CD-ROM. Red Book is a standard for the
data used to create an audio CD; a Red Book–capable burner follows that
standard. This ensures that your CD can play on all audio CD players. Your
CD burner clearly states whether it can burn audio, or Red Book, CDs.
Purchasing CD-Rs
A staggering variety of CD-Rs is available. You have green, blue, gold, even
black CDs, and you have data and music CDs. So which ones are best? Well,
that depends.
Unless you have a consumer CD recorder from a few years ago, you can
record your CD onto any data CD-R. You can find these discs just about any-
where, and they can cost as little as five to ten cents apiece if you buy in
quantity. If you have an older consumer CD recorder, you have to use music
CD-Rs. These CD-Rs have a code in them that allows older consumer recorders
to actually record. These CD-Rs cost a lot more, not because they capture
music any better, but because a royalty — which is about a dollar and goes
to the recording industry — is figured into the price of the CD (don’t get me
started).
So, if you have a recent CD-R recorder connected to your computer, or if you
have a professional-grade CD burner (such as the Alesis Masterlink), you can
get by just fine using run-of-the-mill data CD-Rs.
As far as which of the countless CD-R brands to use, well, they’re all pretty
much the same — as long as you go with a major manufacturer. Personally,
I always go with Taiyo Yuden if I can find them. (Do a search on the Internet
for some places that sell these.) Keep in mind, though, that some CD-Rs
work better on some recorders, and the only way to find out is to try them
and see. When you find a brand that works, try to stick with it.
Look for CD-Rs with a tough top surface. It’s the scratches in the top of the
disc that cause it not to play over time, not the scratches on the bottom. 
Recording Your Music to CD-R
Burning a CD is easy. All you generally have to do is open your CD-burning
software and follow the prompts. A few things, however, can be helpful to
know in order to get the best sound and to create a CD that you can duplicate.

Book VIII

Recording Your Music to CD-R
623
Dealing with diversity: Using different CD recorders
If you’re using a CD burner in your computer, burning a CD is as simple as
opening your software and following the program’s directions for making a
CD. If you use a standalone CD recorder (burner), you have to connect it to
your Digidesign interface (using a digital connection) and record to your CD
recorder. These options are presented in this section. 
If you have a newer CD burner (say, a 2000 or later model), it can probably
burn at pretty fast rates (8x, 16x, or more). Well, that’s cool, but you’re actu-
ally better off burning your master CD at a slower speed. In fact, tests have
shown that 2x burning produces the fewest errors. Even though this test was
performed a few years ago, I still burn at 2x just to be safe. If you’re intent on
burning at a higher rate, always double-check the CD by playing it in a regu-
lar CD player (a boom box or the one in your car, for instance).
Computer-based systems
If you have a CD burner program (such as Toast, Jam, or CD Creator), burn-
ing your CD is easy. One advantage of using one of these programs to burn a
CD is that you have quite a bit of flexibility to organize your songs and place
space between them.
In general, all you have to do is click the Add Track button on the main
screen and select the track you want to add. You’re also prompted to choose
any silence that you want to place before the track, as well as PQ-subcode
information. (A PQ subcode is “housekeeping” information added to the CD
data; it includes instructions for start and stop times for each track.)
When you have all your tracks assembled, you can go ahead and burn your
CD. Pretty simple, huh?
Standalone CD burners
A variety of standalone CD burners are available — and they all work differ-
ently. Some record the CD the same way a cassette player records tapes —
you connect the digital input of the CD recorder to the digital output of your
Digidesign interface and press Record on the CD recorder while clicking Play
in Pro Tools. The CD is then recorded in real time. Other standalone CD
burners, such as the Alesis Masterlink (the CD-burning standard for many
pro studios), work more like computer software programs than cassette
recorders.
With the Masterlink, you first record the music from Pro Tools to the
Masterlink’s hard drive (using the same procedures just listed). From there,
you can edit, sequence, and even dynamically process each song before you
burn all the songs to a CD-R. When you’re happy with the order of the songs
and the spacing between them, you can then burn your CD.

Recording Your Music to CD-R
624
If you want to do any dynamic processing to your music in the Masterlink,
be sure to send your files to the machine undithered and at 24-bit. You can
dither in the Masterlink after you make your changes. This improves the
sound of your final CD. If all you’re doing is sequencing your songs, then you
can send the files dithered if you want. (For more on dithering, see Book 7,
Chapter 2.)
Burning for mass production
If you intend to send your CD-R to a duplication or replication company to
have it mass-produced, you have a few ducks to get in a row first. Here are a
few things to keep in mind:
✦Check for physical defects to the CD-R before you try to burn to it.
Scratches, fingerprints, smudges, and other imperfections on the mirror
side (bottom) of the CD-R can cause errors in the data when burning the
CD-R. Be sure to use a clean and unblemished CD-R for burning your
master. After all, CD-Rs are cheap.
✦Always write your master CD by using Disc at Once mode. This allows
the CD to be read as a Red Book audio CD. Your other option when
recording a CD is Track at Once — which burns one song (track) at a
time. Unfortunately, Track at Once produces more errors than Disc at
Once, which burns the entire CD at one time. Because of the errors pres-
ent on CDs burned using Track at Once, a mass producer’s equipment
can’t read — and therefore summarily rejects — CDs that people pro-
duce using this method. (In fact, many older CD players for homes and
cars can’t read these CDs either.) So be sure that you use Disc at Once
whenever you make a CD of your mastered music.
✦If you can, use an error-detection software program to check for
errors in your recorded CD. If you don’t have access to an error-
detection program, check the back of the CD for any blemishes (just like
you did before recording onto it).
✦Listen carefully to your entire CD after it’s been recorded. Compare it
with your original file and make sure that the CD is perfect. Also, spend
time reevaluating the order of the songs. Make sure that they flow well
together.
✦Use a felt-tip marker approved for writing on CD-Rs when you label
your finished CD master. If the marker isn’t specifically labeled as
approved, the ink may leak through the top surface of the disc over
time, disrupting the data. Also, don’t use a ballpoint pen or an adhesive
label (paper or plastic) to identify your master. A ballpoint pen can
damage the surface of the CD. Adhesive labels can slow the rotation
speed of the CD (causing errors in the duplication or replication
process), and they’ve been known to come off inside a duplication
machine, clogging up the works.

Book VIII
Chapter 1

Recording Your Music to CD-R
625
✦Label the CD master with the name of your album and all your contact
info. Again, remember to use a CD-R-approved felt-tip marker, and write
only on the top surface of the disc (but you knew that). Your contact
information should include your name (or your band’s name), your
phone number, and the date the master was made.
✦Make three CD-Rs of your mastered music. Keep one safe in your
studio and send two to the duplication or replication company. Call it
good insurance: If one of the two CDs that you send off for mass produc-
tion has an error, you don’t waste any time sending the company a
replacement.
✦Prepare a PQ subcode log. PQ subcodes are additional information
written on the CD that provides time-code information, such as track
numbers and the start and stop times of the tracks. If your CD burner
software doesn’t support PQ subcodes, make a list of the start and stop
time of each track (referenced from the start of the CD) on a separate
piece of paper — as well as the track number and length of each track —
and send that info along with your CD masters. If your software program
can generate a PQ subcode log, print it — and remember to send it with
your CD master.
If you’re burning a CD for a major record label, first of all, congratulations!
Secondly, make sure you supply ISRC codes with your CD. ISRC stands for
International Standard Recording Code, and it contains information about the
CD, such as the owner of the song, the country of origin, year of release, and
serial number. You enter ISRC codes into a dialog box on most CD-burning
programs, and the information is placed within the PQ subcodes.
Before you put your music out into the world, get it copyrighted. Getting a
copyright on your music is easy and relatively inexpensive so there’s no
reason not to do it. All you have to do is fill out an SR (sound recording)
form and send it into the U.S. Copyright Office at the Library of Congress.
You can find the form at www.loc.gov/copyright/forms, or you can call
the Copyright Office at 202-707-9100 to have it mailed to you. Choose (or ask
for) the Form SR with Instructions. The current cost for filing the form is $30,
but double-check this fee before you send it in, because it’s been known to
go up (hey, it’s the government). You can fill out one form for each CD so the
cost per song isn’t very high.
The form is pretty easy to fill out, but if you run into difficulty, you can call
an information specialist to help you out. The number is 202-707-3000. Be
prepared to wait on hold for a little while (hey, it’s the government). 
Send your completed form, the fee, and a copy of your CD to the address
listed on the form. You’ll receive a certificate in the mail, but you can con-
sider your music copyrighted as soon as you mail it in (as long as you sent it

Making Multiple Copies
626
to the correct address). If you’re especially protective of your music (para-
noid? or is that paranoid enough?), you can wait until your check clears your
bank. At this point, you can be almost certain that your form is being
processed. If you can’t sleep at night unless your music is copyrighted,
you’re best off waiting until your certificate arrives in the mail before you
start selling or distributing your CD. (This is a good reason to file for your
copyright early.)
Making Multiple Copies
When you have a CD that you want to copy, you can either make the copies
yourself or hire someone to copy them for you. If you do them yourself, you
have to burn CDs one at a time just like the first one. This can cost little but
takes a lot of time (as you undoubtedly found out when you burned your
first CD).
Doing it yourself
Well, you’ve done everything else yourself, so why not add the copying
process to the list? If you have more time than money and only need a few
CDs, making them yourself might be a good option.
To make saleable CDs yourself, you’re going to need not only the CD burner,
but also a graphics design software program and a printer to print CD labels
and cover material (CD sleeve and tray card). Even with this equipment,
your package won’t look as professional as the package that a CD duplica-
tion or replication company can create, but what you create is probably
good enough for you to sell a few copies to friends, acquaintances, and
maybe open-mic-night audiences.
A work of art
Your cover artwork is an important part of your
CD. Take the time to create a visually appealing
CD cover and tray card. This is especially true
if you intend to sell your CD through record
stores or other retailers. Your package needs to
look professional because it’s going to be com-
peting with the big boys (and girls) who have
huge art budgets for their CDs.
If you can’t create a professional package
yourself (no shame there — not everybody
can), hire someone to do it. Most CD replicators
I discuss in this chapter provide design serv-
ices. Sometimes these services are even
included in the CD package price. I recommend
that you take advantage of these services —
sometimes you get best results by letting the
pros do what they do.

Having someone else do it
Depending on how many copies you want, you can either have them dupli-
cated or replicated. Either process can provide you with a professional-qual-
ity product that you can sell alongside major releases. Your choice between
duplication and replication depends on how many copies you plan to have
made.
Duplication
Duplication involves making copies of your master CD-R the same way you
made the CD-R in the first place. The only difference is that duplication com-
panies use CD burners that enable them to make more than one copy at a
time. Duplication is great if you want to make a small number of copies —
anywhere from 50 to 300. CD-duplication companies often provide one-color
printing on the CD and either a vinyl sleeve or jewel cases to hold the CD.
Some companies can prepare retail-ready packages, which look like other
commercial CDs and include the actual discs (with printing on them), jewel
cases with color-printed inserts, bar codes (see the “UPC bar codes” sidebar
in this chapter), and shrink-wrap. You can expect to pay around $3 to $5 for
each CD, depending on the quantity you order.
An advantage to having your CDs duplicated is that your CDs usually can be
done quickly. Many duplication companies can provide you with a finished
product in as little as a few days (although an average of seven days seems
more common). The disadvantage is that you usually pay considerably more
for each CD than you would if you did it yourself or went the replication
route.
To have your CDs duplicated, you need to provide a CD-R master — that is, a
CD-R recorded as a Red Book–compliant audio CD. If you want the duplica-
tion company to create retail-ready packages, you also have to provide art-
work laid out to the company’s specifications (get ’em beforehand).
If you’re interested in going the duplication route, here are a few resources
to get you started. You can also do a search on the Internet for more places
by using the search term CD duplication.

Most of the companies that I list in the following section also provide dupli-
cation services for smaller quantities.
Replication 
Replication is the process used for making commercial CDs — lots and lots
of them. Instead of making copies directly from your master CD-R, this
process involves burning a glass master — the master disc from which all
your CD copies will be made — from your master disc. The glass master is
then used to transfer the data onto CD media. Replication is designed for
larger runs — 500 or more copies. Quantities of fewer than 300 aren’t cost-
effective because the glass master often costs between $100 and $200 to
make — and the film needed for the printing of the CD and sleeve and tray
card can cost several hundred more.
CD replication usually comes with printing on the CD in one to four colors,
and a tray card and sleeve often printed in four colors. Most CD-replication
companies have retail-ready CD package deals that cover everything from
layout of your artwork (some do, some don’t, so be sure to ask first), printed
CDs, jewel boxes, bar codes (see the “UPC bar codes” sidebar in this chap-
ter), and shrink wrap. You can expect to pay between $1,000 and $1,500 for
500 to 1,000 retail-ready copies from most manufacturers.
If you’re interested in going the replication route, you need to provide the
replication company with a master audio CD, artwork set to its specifica-
tions, and a completed order form. Oh, and you’ll probably have to pay 
half the money for the job up front before they start work on your project
(bummer).
UPC bar codes
If you make a CD that you intend to sell through
major retailers, such as record stores or
Internet retailers, you need a UPC bar code. A
UPC bar code is a string of numbers that iden-
tify your product. Every CD has its own unique
bar code. You can go about a getting a bar code
in one of two ways: You can register and pay
$750 with the Universal Code Council (UCC) or
you can pay anywhere from nothing to $50 to
get one from a CD replicator or distributor.
Unless you intend to release more than 35
CDs, your best bet is to buy a bar code from a
replicator or distributor, who can provide bar
codes for a small (or no) fee with your CD order.
Here are additional places where you can get a
UPC bar code:

After people at the manufacturing company receive your order form, the CD,
and the artwork, they make a reference CD (which shows you what the fin-
ished product will sound like) and proofs of your finished printed material.
Be sure to look over the art proofs carefully — and listen to every second of
the reference CD. Any mistakes you don’t catch are your problem, so take
your time and compare the reference CD very closely with the master
recording (you did make a copy of your master CD before you sent it out,
right?). The master and the reference should be exactly the same.
Having your CD replicated is a stressful thing. You’re spending a ton of
money and getting quite a few copies; you’ll need to be proud enough of
them to go out in the world and sell them. So choosing a CD-replication com-
pany to work with is an important task. Quite a few companies are out there,
so you should choose the place that makes you feel the most comfortable
and makes a high-quality product. Following is a list of the larger CD-replica-
tion companies. For more possibilities, do a search on your favorite search
engine for the term CD replication or CD duplication.

This company has five locations in the United States.
Many CD-replication companies can provide you with great resources, infor-
mation, and even opportunities for promoting your work. Take advantage of
these opportunities if you can, but don’t choose a company based on its pro-
motional promises. Choose a company because of its customer service,
price, and the quality of its product.
Be sure to ask for referrals (or at least a list of satisfied clients) before you
go with a duplication or replication company. As always, your best bet when
you’re entrusting someone with your precious music to is to ask friends for
recommendations. Also, take timing estimates with a grain of salt — I’ve had
a couple of occasions when a company promised to finish my CDs by a cer-
tain date and the discs didn’t show up. So, leave plenty of time between
when you print your CDs and when you need them.

Promoting Your Music

Promoting Your Music
Congratulations, you have a CD to sell. The hard — oops, I’m sorry, actually
the easy — part is behind you. I’m sure you don’t want to be stuck with
boxes of expensive coasters, so now you have to work on getting people
interested in buying your music. You’ve just gone from being a musician-
composer-engineer-producer to being all those plus a record company-
owner-business-person (exactly how hyphenated can a person get,
anyway?).
Your friends and some acquaintances will probably buy a few copies, but
after you’ve sold a CD to all of them, you need to get your music to the
broader world. This can be tricky. After all, you’re now competing with the
big boys and, face it, you don’t have nearly the resources that they do.
Traditional channels of distribution and marketing are pretty much out of
the question for you (and for most of us). So, to succeed in selling your
music, you need to try some alternative approaches.
I’m no marketing guru, but I have managed to create a nice niche for myself
and my music. So trust me; you can do the same. All it takes is a little imagi-
nation and a lot of hard work. In the following list, I present a few ideas that
have worked for me and other enterprising, independent artists.
✦Take yourself seriously. No, don’t go buy a limo. At least not yet. 
What I mean here is take the job of promoting and selling your music 
seriously — treat it as a business. Getting people to notice and buy your
music is a lot of work, but it doesn’t have to be a drag. (If it is, you’re
better off getting someone else to do it for you.)
✦Get organized. Get your new business off on the right foot by develop-
ing a habit of keeping track of your sales and developing a contact list.
One of the best investments that you can make is to get a contact-
management database (Act! is a good one) to keep track of promotion
contacts (newspapers, radio stations, clubs), CD sales, and fans. Also,
do yourself a big favor and keep meticulous records of your income and
expenses; you’ll be grateful you did that when tax time comes.
✦Create a mailing list. This is one of the most cost-effective and powerful
ways that you can start to develop a following. Make a sign-up sheet for
your mailing list available at every public appearance. (Ask people to
include not only their postal mail address, but their e-mail address as
well.) Then enter those names into your database system. You can then
either send out snail-mailings or e-mail notices whenever you play or do
anything worth mentioning.

Book VIII
Chapter 1

✦Get out and be seen. This one is pretty straightforward. Get out in the
world and let people know about your music. This can mean not only
playing gigs but also talking about your music. I have a good friend who
releases an album each year. He prints a thousand copies, which he sells
at his gigs, and every year he sells out. (Hey, that’s an extra ten grand a
year after expenses, not bad.) He also uses them as his calling card in
order to get more gigs.
✦Look beyond the record store. It’s nearly impossible to compete with
the major labels in the record store. Unless you live in a small town or
know of a record shop that has a section devoted to local bands, ready
and willing to sell your CDs, you need to think of other places to put
your music. For example, another friend of mine has placed his CD at
quite a few of the local businesses in his neighborhood around the holi-
days. Everything — from the local pack-and-ship to the video store, has
a counter-top display with his CD. He creates a small poster that fits on
the counter, describing him and his music. He sells quite a few CDs and
gets a handful more gigs each year this way.
✦Capitalize on your style. Some nonrecord-store venues just happen to
fit what your music is saying. For example, another one of my friends
composes folksy, new-age music, and he managed to get his CDs into a
handful of new-age, gift-type shops. He often puts them in the stores on
consignment and checks each store once a week to refill the counter-top
display and collect any money that the store took in (minus the store’s
cut, of course). Going into the stores every week helps him to develop a
connection with the store owners, many of whom have arranged for him
to do performances in their stores, which increases his exposure and
sales.
✦Try something different. Years ago I teamed up with a local author and
played at her book signings. (This is before I wrote any books myself.)
She read a passage from her book, and then I played for a few minutes. 
I always ended up selling a few dozen CDs at these events.
✦Don’t be stingy. Give away your CD (within reason, of course). I usually
count on giving away anywhere from 10 to 15 percent of the CDs I print.
These can be for reviews, as a way to get gigs, or for any purpose that
may spread the word about the music. Giving out your CD as a promo-
tional tool is an inexpensive way to let people know what you’re doing.
If you’re interested in the possibilities for using the Internet to promote and
sell your music, I discuss these in Book 8, Chapter 2.
I’m sure there are dozens more ways to promote and sell your music. Think
outside the box and use your imagination. Remember: Don’t be shy. Do
whatever you can to get your music out into the world.

T
o make it as a musician, you have to get the word out that you and your
music exist. Traditionally, you played gigs, sold your CDs at these gigs,
and tried to get your music in local stores and on local radio. If you were
lucky, you’d sell a few CDs at each gig, move a handful of others through
local outlets, and maybe get some radio play on a college station. Forget get-
ting any national exposure unless you had developed a following and had a
busy touring schedule.
That’s the way it used to play, but now the Internet has made it possible for
any musician to get national — even international — exposure without going
on the road (as much). All you have to do is get your music on the Internet
and promote it well. You can then make money from your music while you
sleep (or at least make your music available while you sleep).
“How do I do this?” you may ask. Well, that’s the purpose of this chapter.
Here you explore the ways you can use the Internet to promote and sell
your music. You discover how to put up music files so that your potential
customers can either download your music or listen to it online. You find
out about some of the best ways to have your music hosted online, and you
take a look at promotional ideas to get you started.
Understanding MP3
I’m sure you’ve heard about MP3s. In fact I’m willing to bet that you’ve
already downloaded a few MP3s off the Internet and experienced first-hand
the immediacy that MP3s offer. You go to a Web site and choose a song to
download. After just a short while, you have a copy on your hard drive that
you can listen to anytime you want. You can even put that song on a CD or
portable player and take it with you.

Understanding MP3
634
With all this convenience and immediacy comes a downside. That MP3 song
doesn’t sound as good as one mastered to a CD. For most people, this is a
small price to pay for the ability to download a song for free (well, okay,
often for a buck a shot these days). After all, most people play their music
on less-then-stellar stereos (Walkmans and boom boxes come to mind). But
if you’re one of the lucky few with a stellar (or more-than-stellar) stereo
system, you’re going to hear the difference, which may prompt the following
question: Why doesn’t a song in MP3 format sound as good as one mastered to
a CD? The answer: data compression.
MP3 is a process that compresses your music so it takes up less hard-disk
space. Data compression is necessary or MP3s couldn’t work over the
Internet. Consider the numbers: A regular CD music file can take up 30 to
40MB (about 10MB per minute). That same song can take up only 3 to 4MB
in MP3 format. This is important because promoting music on the Internet is
totally dependent on speed. A 30 or 40MB file is way too big to download or
to stream on the Web. For example, dial-up users using a 28-Kbps modem
would have to wait over four hours to download a 40MB file! I don’t know
about you, but I don’t know anyone who is willing to wait that long to hear
a piece of music. And if you haven’t heard it before and aren’t yet sure you
like it . . . ? You get the idea.
Although compression causes your MP3 to lose fidelity as well as megabytes,
I think this loss of quality is an actual advantage. After all, it’s normal that
your MP3 won’t sound as good as your mastered CD in its multimeg bril-
liance. It doesn’t have to; you’re giving listeners just a taste of your music.
What do you mean “near-CD quality”?
You may have heard the term near-CD quality
used in reference to MP3 sound. This is a mar-
keting term, meaning: “It doesn’t sound as good
as a CD, but we’ll make it sound like it’s pretty
darn close and maybe the buyer won’t notice.”
If you sense a note of cynicism in my writing,
you’re right. Don’t delude yourself into believ-
ing that the song you start with is going to
sound quite the same after MP3 conversion.
The difference between a song on a CD and a
song that’s near CD quality is like the difference
between playing a CD in your car and then
hearing the same song on the radio. You lose
some high end and the bass is thinner. You may
even lose the stereo image, depending on the
conversion mode you choose, and you’ll prob-
ably lose some dynamic range. Overall, the
song will have a little less life to it.
This is not a huge difference for most people
but is noticeable nonetheless. The good news
is that most people don’t seem to care (or are
at least willing to accept it) — and that the song
is now slim enough to zip through the phone
wire to potential customers.

Chapter 2

635
By giving people this taste, along with the opportunity to purchase 
a CD, you help them to decide whether they want to buy the high-quality
version.
Engine
When you convert a song on your mastered CD to an MP3, the engine is the
encoding algorithm (technical term: number cruncher) that is used to con-
vert your file. Not all engines make your song sound the same. Some engines
give your song a much better online sound than others, and you may get a
better-quality sound from an engine if you adjust the bit rate and/or the
recording mode. Some MP3 encoders allow you to choose the engine you
want to use (as shown in Figure 2-1); others don’t.
The standard (and arguably best) encoding engine is the Franhofer algo-
rithm, although LAME is gaining in popularity (maybe in spite of its name).
The encoding engine you choose depends on the results you get. Try a few
to decide what works best for your music and your situation.
Bit rate
The bit rate essentially determines the quality of your encoded music. When
you encode your music, you have to choose what bit rate you want your file
to be in, as shown in Figure 2-2. Bit rates range anywhere from 20 kbps (kilo-
bauds per second) to 320 kbps. The higher the bit rate, the better the sound
quality. The downside is that higher bit rates create larger files. When you
convert your music to MP3, you’re constantly balancing quality with file size. 
Figure 2-1:
MP3
encoders
use a
variety of
engines to
convert your
music.

Understanding MP3
636
The bit rate that you ultimately choose depends on how you plan to use
your MP3 file. For example, if you want to put your music on an MP3 host site
(an Internet site that makes people’s MP3 music available for download),
you most likely need to choose the 128-kbps rate because this is what many
host sites require for Download or Hi-Fi mode. On the other hand, if you
want to stream audio on the Web (a process that plays the track as it’s down-
loading), you’re better off choosing a much-lower rate (between 20 and 24
kbps). Otherwise your song will pause abruptly while it’s playing — at least
for the mass of people who are still using dial-up modems.
Variable bit rate (VBR) is an option that many encoders offer. VBR allows the
encoder to change the bit rate as it compresses the file. The advantage to
this approach is that the sections with fewer instruments — in effect, less
data — can be compressed further than sections full of more critical infor-
mation. The result is often a better-sounding MP3 that takes up less space.
The only drawback — and it’s a big one — is that few MP3 players can read a
file created with VBR. So, you’re probably best off not using this approach
for your Web-based files.
If you’re making MP3s to listen to through your own player and it supports
VBR playback, then using VBR keeps your files smaller. If you do choose
VBR, you’re prompted to choose an average bit rate or a minimum and maxi-
mum bit rate. Try them both and choose the one that sounds best to you.
Mode
Modes essentially refer to whether your file is in stereo or mono, only your
choices include more than just plain stereo and mono. You can choose mono,
stereo, joint stereo, or (sometimes) forced stereo (also known as dual mono),
Figure 2-2:
MP3
encoders
allow you to
choose the
bit rate of
your MP3.

Book VIII
Chapter 2
Getting Your Music
on the Internet
Understanding MP3
637
as shown in Figure 2-3. Again, you choose the mode according to what your
music needs to sound its best, and you balance quality against file size.
Here’s a look at the various modes and how they relate to quality and file size:
✦Mono: Mono takes up little room because all the stereo data from your
CD is contained on one track. The sound quality can be good, depending
on the bit rate you choose, but you lose all stereo-imaging data. Choose
the mono mode if the loss of the stereo image won’t adversely affect
your song, or if the overall sound quality is more important to you than
the stereo information.
✦Stereo: The stereo mode consists of two mono tracks. With the stereo
mode, you retain all your stereo information. The drawback is that your
two tracks are at half the bit rate of a mono version using the same bit-
rate setting — so they don’t sound as good. For example, if you encode
at 128 kbps, each of your stereo tracks is actually only 64 kbps. If you
want each track to be at 128 kbps, you have to encode at 256 kbps. The
resulting file is twice as large as the mono file at 128 kbps, has no better
sound quality, and takes longer to download. 
Even so, it’s your call. Stereo mode is a good choice if you have a song
with complex stereo panning effects that you just can’t live without and
you don’t mind a sound quality that’s slightly lower.
✦Joint Stereo: This mode is a cross between mono and stereo: It creates
one track of audio information and one track of information that tells the
player to send certain sounds through one speaker or the other (a set of
instructions called steering data). You get most of the stereo information
with only a slightly larger file size than you’d get with the mono mode.
Figure 2-3:
MP3
encoders
have
several
modes from
which you
can choose. 

Creating MP3 Files
638
For most songs, the difference in stereo image between regular stereo
and joint stereo is indistinguishable — and you end up with a higher-
quality recording because the higher bit rate is used. You may find that
this option works better for you than the regular stereo mode. Experiment
and see whether you can hear a difference.
✦Force Stereo: Also known as dual mono, this mode is essentially the
same as the mono mode — one track of audio data is recorded and the
stereo panning information is lost. The only difference between mono
and force stereo is that force stereo makes sure that the mono data is
played through both speakers of the player. Choose Force Stereo mode
if you don’t mind your music being in mono but want to ensure that the
player plays it through both speakers.
Creating MP3 Files
To create MP3 files, all you need (well, besides the computer) is MP3 encod-
ing software and a CD or audio file of your music. To create an MP3 of your
music, just choose the song to convert and let the encoder do the rest.
There are some variables that can make your MP3s sound their best — such
as which encoder to use and what parameters to choose. I cover these vari-
ables in this section.
Choosing encoding software
You have a lot of MP3 encoding software choices. Some software encodes
from various file formats as well as from CD, whereas others don’t encode
directly from a CD. Not being able to encode directly from CD isn’t necessar-
ily a bad thing, however, because the process of lifting music off a CD (also
known as CD ripping) can cause audible artifacts (noise, clicks, and pops, and
so on). If you encode from a WAV or AIFF file, you can first make sure that
the sound going into the encoding process is as good as possible.
A couple of popular MP3 programs that both encode and rip are
✦Musicmatch Jukebox (www.musicmatch.com): You can download the
basic version for free, which allows you to play, rip, burn, and convert
MP3s and audio CDs.
✦N2MP3 (www.proteron.com): This is a Mac-only program, but Proteron
has a Windows version called EasyMP3. You can download trial versions
of these programs for free. The trial versions allow you to encode only
20 MP3s at full length (a maximum of one minute after that), and they
put a voice clip at the beginning that says, “Encoded by N2MP3” that

639
you can’t get rid of (of course, if you buy the program these limitations
disappear).
There are a lot of other MP3 encoders out there, so if you’re looking for a
little more variety, you can check out these sites:
✦www.cnet.shareware.com: This site contains shareware of all sorts,
from games to word-processing software to MP3 encoders. From the
main page just type MP3 into the keyword search function and choose
the computer platform that you use (Mac or PC). You’re sure to find a
bunch of matches for your search.
✦www.mp3software.com.ar: This site claims to have the most complete
list of MP3-related software products available for download. You can
find freeware and shareware versions in this site.
✦www.mp3-mac.com/Pages/Encoders.html: This site contains tons of
software programs (some free, some not) for Macintosh computer users.
You may find one or more programs that meet your needs.
Encoding your music 
You can use any number of different software programs to encode your
music, but since you already have Pro Tools — and you can get an MP3
option for it — you may as well use that to encode your music. The Pro
Tools MP3 encoding option comes with your Pro Tools software as a demo
(you get 30 days to try it out), but you’ll need to pay $20 if you want to keep
using it after the demo period is over. Purchasing the MP3 encoding option
involves the following steps:
1. Log onto the Internet and go to store.digidesign.com/.
The Avid/DigiStore page will take a moment to load.
2. From the options listed on the left side of the page, select MP3 Option
under the Software heading. 
The MP3 page will load.
After the MP3 page loads, you’ll find four MP3 types. The two versions
entitled MP3 Export are for Pro Tools version 5.0.1 and the two versions
called MP3 Option are for Pro Tools versions 5.1 and higher. 
3. Click the Buy Now button for the option that matches your computer
system and your software version. 
The shopping cart page appears.

4. Click Checkout and follow the prompts to buy the software. 
After you finish paying for your software, you’ll receive an authorization
code that you can enter when you get the “This Trial has Expired” alert
when you try to encode an MP3 using the Bounce To Disk function (see next
section). 
When this alert appears, click Authorize and enter the code when prompted.
The actual encoding process is pretty simple. To encode using the MP3
option, follow these steps:
1. Select File➪Bounce to Disk.
The Bounce dialog box makes an appearance.
2. From the File Type drop-down menu, choose the MPEG-1 layer 3
option. 
3. Using the other drop-down menus, enter the format, bounce source,
sample rate, and whether you want to convert during or after the
bounce. 
4. Click Bounce.

Hosting Your Music
When you have your music in MP3 format, it’s time to get it out into the
world. This involves either putting it on your own Web site or someone
else’s. This section explores the pros and cons of — as well as the process
involved in — both of these options. Chances are you’ll end up choosing a
combination approach if you’re serious about selling your music online.
Choosing a host site
An Internet host site is a Web site that allows you to add your music to its list
of available music downloads. Putting your MP3s on a host site can give you
exposure that you wouldn’t otherwise be able to get. Not only can you direct
people to the site to listen to your music, you can also benefit from the traf-
fic that the site itself, other musicians, and the site’s fans generate. For some
of the larger sites, that traffic can add up to a lot of potential listeners.
Although MP3 host sites are constantly changing, a few have managed to
hang around for a while.
Internet music host sites are always coming and going. To find out what sites
are currently available and what they offer check out compo10.com/Music
Hosts.htm. This site has a comprehensive list that’s updated regularly.
Be sure to read and understand the contracts (often called agreements) that
each of these sites requires you agree to. Make sure that you don’t sign away
your rights to your music. If you’re not sure you like a particular agreement,
don’t sign up for the service. You can find plenty of other places to put your
music on the Internet.

Ampcast
www.ampcast.com/artists/signup.php 
Ampcast has been around since 1998 and is, as its Web site duly states,
“dedicated to introducing and exposing new musicians and bands as well as
providing a forum for the promotion of more established musical artists.” To
join Ampcast, you pay a $95 per year fee. For this, you can put your music
and pictures on its site and get up to 50 cents for each MP3 that is sold of
your music. 
Ampcast also has a “one-off” CD program where it creates a CD of your
music for you and makes the CD available on its site. You can have them
create the CD from your uploaded music or you can send them a Red Book–
compatible CD (Book 8, Chapter 1) from which to burn the CD. The amount
you get from each CD sale depends on the price you set, but it can range
from $1 to $3 or more. The good thing is that you don’t have to have a CD to
sell one on this site — Ampcast creates it for you.
Iuma
www.iuma.com/ArtistsOnly/
Iuma is the oldest MP3 host site, having been around since 1993. Iuma’s
blurb on its Web site states that it is “the one place to post your music
where actual musicians are watching out for you — not weasels watching
the numbers. You have your own URL with your band name first. And a
custom Web page where you can post all your band info and MP3s, sell CDs,
create message boards, fan lists, and of course, get e-mail from your fans —
all Free.”
You don’t get paid for downloads on Iuma, but the fact that it doesn’t cost
you anything to join easily offsets that disadvantage. (Most bands don’t earn
their fees back from downloads anyway.) Iuma doesn’t actually sell CDs on
its site, but it enables you to put links from its site to the site(s) where you
sell your CDs. 
Vitaminic.com
www.vitaminic.com
Vitaminic is a European company that operates ten different sites. The
address listed here takes you to the English language site, where you can
join for free and get exposure through all the sites. Vitaminic claims to have
10 million hits per month from 2 million unique users. Vitaminic doesn’t pay
you for downloads, but it does offer to sell your music from its site. Vitaminic
creates CDs on demand and pays you half the proceeds from your sales.

Setting up your own site
Even if you put your music on an MP3 site, you should consider creating
your own Web site as well. With your own site, you can provide a lot more
information for visitors to read. You can also offer more products that might
make you more money than your CDs — T-shirts, for instance.
Having your own Web site is not without problems. For example, you have to
design and maintain the site, which can take a lot of time. You also have to
pay for things like hosting (granted, you can find places to host your site for
free — but remember that those are often thick with advertising for other
stuff). If you intend to sell products on your site, you need to provide online
ordering, which often involves setting up a merchant account with a credit
card company. In all, having a Web site can be time-consuming and expen-
sive, so be prepared to do a fair amount of work if you really plan to make
money from your Web site. 
If maintaining a full e-commerce Web site sounds like too much for you, you
can still make money from the Internet using your Web site to promote your
band, especially if you get creative. In fact, with just a few simple steps, you
can have a Web site without the expense or the hassle (well, at least less
hassle), and still provide your visitors with a great Web experience. Here are
a few suggestions:
✦Create links from your site to your MP3 host site. This keeps you from
having to put MP3s or streaming audio on your Web site and your visi-
tors can still hear your music.
✦Get your CD on Amazon.com or CD Baby and link your visitors to those
sites to buy your CD. You don’t get as much money in your pocket, but
these other sites take care of all the ordering hassle for you. (You find
out how to sell your music through CD Baby and Amazon.com in the
“Selling Your CDs” section later in this chapter.) 
Designing your site
Your first step in getting a Web site up and going is to design it. When you
design your Web site keep the following things in mind:
✦Make your site easy to navigate. Make sure that your visitors know
where they are in your site at all times. It’s often a good idea to have a
menu bar on each page so they can at least get back to the home page
without having to search for it.
✦Make sure your site loads quickly. Most people still use dial-up modems
(often as slow as 28 Kbps) — and sites with a ton of big graphics or
streaming videos take forever to download. Most people don’t have the
patience to wait. Think lean and mean. Your visitors will appreciate it
more than a fancy, slow-to-load page.

Hosting Your Music
644
✦Make ordering your CD (or other stuff) easy. Put a Buy My CD icon on
every page.
✦Double-check all your links. Nothing is worse to a Web surfer than a
bunch of links that lead nowhere. If you have links on your site, double-
check each one to be sure it works. And if you have links to other
people’s sites, check the links occasionally to make sure that the page
you’re linking to still exists.
✦Test your site. Before you sign off on your site design, check it from a
slow modem. You instantly get a sense of whether your site is dial-up-
friendly. If it’s slow to load or confusing, keep working on it until it
works. You may also want to check your site using different Internet
browsers and screen resolutions to make sure your site still looks good.
✦Make your site your home page in your browser. I had a site down 
for weeks because I didn’t have it set as my default site in my browser. 
I never got a chance to get there until I got a call from a friend who told
me it was down.
For more tips and tricks on creating a great Web site, check out the Creating
Web Pages All-in-One Desk Reference For Dummies, also published by Wiley.
Putting up your site 
After you design your site, you need to find an ISP (Internet Service Provider)
to host it. Most ISPs allow you to put up a personal Web page for free, but if
you want to do any business from it, you generally need to pay to have your
site hosted. The exception is Geocities (geocities.yahoo.com/home),
which lets you put up a site for free. Geocities also has an inexpensive
domain hosting option ($8.95 per month) where you can have your name as
your URL (www.jeffstrong.com, for instance).
This leads me to the whole domain-name thing. That is, a Web address that
has you or your band’s name as your address. If you want your own domain
name, you need to register it and pay a fee. It used to be that all domain
names were purchased through Internic (now Network Solutions), but now
you can get a domain name in a lot of places.
To find a place to buy and register your domain name, search for domain
registration on your favorite search engine. You’ll end up with a ton of
matches to get you started.
After you choose an ISP and register a domain name — if you choose to go
that route — then it’s just a matter of putting your site up and making sure it
works. Your ISP may either give you detailed instructions on how to do this
or do it for you.

Getting noticed
If you set up your own Web site, submit it to as many search engines as you
can. Otherwise people may not be able to find you. You can do this vital step
in one of three ways:
✦Submit your Web site information to each search engine site by hand.
This means going to each site (Yahoo!, for example) and filling out the
submission form you find there.
✦Hire a submission service to do this for you. These services enter your
Web-site information on hundreds (sometimes thousands) of search
sites for you. These businesses charge a fee that ranges from about $40
to $150, depending on the services and what other benefits they offer —
which can include one-time submission or repeated submission (some-
times as often as every 48 hours).
✦Buy software to automatically submit your Web site information for you.
The software can cost more than the submission service does, but you
can submit your information more than once and be sure that your sub-
mission goes through. Some software even tracks your ranking on the
various search engines.
The major search engines used to include any site for free. All you had to do
was complete a submission form describing your Web site and you were set.
This has changed dramatically over the last year or two. Now the larger
search engines (such as Yahoo) charge a fee if you’re a commercial site —
that is, if you intend to sell anything. These fees can be quite high ($299 on
Yahoo!, for instance).
If your site isn’t a commercial site, you can still list for free — but completing
the submission form may not get you into a search engine’s system. You may
have to submit more than once. Also keep in mind that it can take a month
or more for your site to show up after you’ve placed your submission.
Providing Your Music Online
If you have a Web site, you probably want your visitors to be able to hear
your music. You can make your music available for listening online in two
ways — by download or by streaming audio:
✦Music downloads are files that your visitors can download to their hard
drives and listen to anytime that they want. 
✦Streaming audio is a file that your visitor connects to that plays without
being copied to your visitor’s hard drive. 
Each of these options has its advantages, which I outline in the following
sections.

Providing Your Music Online
646
Offering downloads
Online promotion of your music almost requires you to make downloads
available to your potential fans. You can talk about your music all you want,
but what people want is to hear it. The purpose of the download is to get
your listener to buy your CD or to come see your show.
Put only a few of your best songs on your site (or on any site, for that
matter). If you make your entire CD available, visitors have no incentive to
buy it.
Streaming audio
Streaming audio is basically an MP3 file that plays without being down-
loaded. The advantage is that it greatly reduces the amount of time your lis-
tener has to wait to hear your music. The downside is that the quality of the
audio is lower.
You always want to make the process of navigating your site and listening to
your music as fast as possible. This provides a much better experience than
having to wait. The less time a person has to wait, the more likely he or she
is to return. The more repeat visitors that you get, the better chance you
have for selling CDs.
You can create streaming audio in two ways: You can use a RealAudio file 
(a file format developed by Real Networks) or an MP3 file. The process is the
same, except your file names are going to be different. (Note that you need
an encoder that can create a RealAudio file if you want to go that route.)
The following steps walk you through the process of getting your MP3 file to
stream on your site:
1. Create an MP3 file, using a bit rate between 20 kbps and 32 kbps.
This is a good range for streaming audio over dial-up modems.
2. Save the MP3 file so that you can identify it.
The easiest way to do this is to save your file as songname24.mp3
(the 24 stands for 24 kbps).
3. Create a pointer file and name it songname24.m3u.
A pointer file is a file that directs your visitor’s audio player to the song
so that it plays without waiting for the entire song to download. This file
contains directions to your MP3 file. For example, your file would con-
tain the following text: 
http://www.YourWebSiteAddress/songname24.mp3

Book VIII
Chapter 2
Getting Your Music
on the Internet
Selling Your CDs
647
Keep in mind that any visitor who doesn’t have an audio player can’t
listen to your music. It’s a good idea to put a link on your site to another
site where your listener can download an audio player.
4. Create a hyperlink in your Web page to the songname24.m3u file. 
For example, you can put it in some text saying something like this:
check out our new song, songname and link the text to the file. 
Or you can place the hyperlink in a picture or graphic (or both).
5. Upload your MP3 file, your pointer file, and the new page with your
hyperlink to your Web site.
6. Go to your Web site and see whether it works.
Make sure that your site-hosting service has its MIME types configured for
MP3. Otherwise, your audio files won’t work. (Don’t worry. The people who
work for your hosting service will know what you’re talking about when you
mention MIME types. That’s their job.)
If all this sounds like too much work, you can just create a link to the stream-
ing files on your MP3 host site. That way people can still hear your music,
even if it isn’t available on your site.
Selling Your CDs
Whether or not you have your own site, you can always sell your CDs on the
Internet through other outlets. One advantage to selling your music through
other online stores is that you can capitalize on the traffic that those stores
generate. A number of online retailers are out there, but the following list
sums up some of the major players:
✦CD Baby (www.cdbaby.com): CD Baby is an online record store that spe-
cializes in independent artists. It puts your CD on its site for a very small
set-up fee ($35). For this, you get a Web page (which the people at CD
Baby design) with pictures, bios, MP3s, and streaming audio. The site
sells your CD for whatever price you set, takes $4 from the sale, and
gives you the rest. You even receive an e-mail whenever someone buys
one of your CDs. Sign-up is easy; just direct your browser to www.cdbaby.
com and click the Sell Your CD icon. The instructions are clear, and a lot
of helpful articles on the site can help you to, well, sell your CD.
✦Garageband.com (www.garageband.com/musicians): Garageband.com
works in partnership with CD Baby. You just set up a membership with
CD Baby and list your music on Garageband.com. This gives you more
exposure without any extra expense. Garageband.com also has some
great information to help you sell more of your music and get gigs. 

Promoting Your Music
648
✦Amazon.com (www.amazon.com): Yes, you can get your music on
Amazon.com, which boasts that it’s the world’s largest online retailer.
Amazon.com has an Advantage program that allows you to put your CD
on its site and compete with major-label artists. All you need is a profes-
sional CD package (retail-ready) with a UPC code on it. To join, point
your browser to www.amazon.com and click the Join Advantage link at
the bottom of the page. Follow the directions, and you’ll have your
music on the most prominent online retailer in no time.
Because the Internet is constantly changing and growing, you may find other
sites that allow you to sell your music online. Use your favorite search
engine to search for the term, sell your CD. This gives a ton of other places to
consider selling your CD online.
Promoting Your Music
The whole point of making CDs and putting MP3s of your music on the
Internet is to promote and sell your music. To do this, you need exposure.
Like any promotion technique, there are no rules except to use your imagina-
tion. Experience will be your guide, but here are some ideas to get you
started:
✦Start an e-mail newsletter. An e-mail newsletter is an inexpensive way to
keep your music on people’s minds. Try to be somewhat consistent in
sending it out, but don’t just send out the same message on a regular
basis. Give your subscribers something. Provide new information in
your e-mail, such as a press release about where you’re playing next or a
link to a new song that you’ve just uploaded. Note: Don’t send your
newsletter to anyone who hasn’t asked to receive it. This is called spam-
ming, and it’s not nice. To build up a subscriber list, encourage people to
fill in your mailing list sign-up forms at your gigs and on your Web site.
Always provide a way for them to unsubscribe from your list — and
make it easy to do so. 
✦Put your Web site address on everything. People can’t come to you if
they don’t know that you exist. So print your Web site address on all
your promotional materials, including the CD itself. Also, include your
Web site address on all e-mails and Internet correspondence that you do
(as a signature on Internet forums if you belong to any, for example).
✦Network. Check out as many independent-musician sites as you can.
You not only learn a lot about marketing your music, but also have 
an opportunity to spread the word about your music. Check out
Garageband.com (www.garageband.com), Getsigned.com (www.get
signed.com), and indiecentre.com (www.indiecentre.com), for
starters.

649
✦Stay up to date. Keep track of where you put your music and check back
often to make sure everything is working properly. Web sites change and
go out of business often. Unless you check the site occasionally, you
may not know if your music suddenly disappears from there. Also, rou-
tinely search for new places to put your music.
✦Get linked. Try to get folks to link from their sites to your own. Likewise,
share the wealth and link to other sites that you like. Cross-promotion
can be a good thing and allow you to pool your fan base with another
band. This doesn’t take away from your sales (after all, you listen to
more than one band’s CDs, right?). Visitors to your site will appreciate
the link and will probably check back to see whether you’ve added any
new ones.
