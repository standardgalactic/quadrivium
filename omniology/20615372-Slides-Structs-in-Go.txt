Structs in Go
●
A struct is a sequence of named elements, called ﬁelds. Each of them has a name and a 
type. 
●
If you are familiar with OOP from other languages you can think of a struct as of a class. 
The struct ﬁelds are like the instance attributes we deﬁne in OOP. 
●
Unlike traditional Object-Oriented Programming, Go does not have a class-object 
architecture. Rather we have structs which hold complex data structures.
●
A structs is nothing more that a schema containing a blueprint of data a structure will 
hold. This blueprint is ﬁxed at compile time. It’s not allowed to change the name or the 
type of the ﬁelds at runtime. You can’t add or remove ﬁelds from a struct at runtime.
