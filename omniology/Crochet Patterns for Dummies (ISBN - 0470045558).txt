About the Author
Susan Brittain’s fascination with crochet began very early, when she was 4 or 5 years old.
She would watch her grandmother, who had lost her sight in midlife, spend hours crocheting
beautiful afghans for friends and family, counting the stitches with her fingers. By the age 
of 8, Susan was crocheting her own projects, starting with simple patterns such as scarves,
and then moving on to afghans, toys, and sweaters. Although her creative streak has led her
to learn many different crafts, crochet has been a steady thread throughout.
Susan finally had the opportunity to combine work with pleasure, and she held the position
of assistant editor for Crochet Fantasy magazine for a little more than two years, contributing
as a designer as well. She is also the coauthor of Crocheting For Dummies (Wiley) and con-
tinues to design new projects for various yarn companies, as well as friends and family.


Dedication
This book is first and foremost dedicated to my family, without whom I could never have
completed this book. They gave me the time and space I needed to crochet all the designs,
and then get them down on paper. My husband, Paul, and daughter, Angela, put up with
boxes and bags of yarn, late meals, and piles of laundry that never seemed to quite get fin-
ished. Also, to my stepdaughters, Ashley and Sarah, who provided me with insights about
what crochet projects the younger generation would like to see. Ashley even took a whole
box of yarn and hooks with her when she went off to college.
Again, my gratitude goes to my family, the most important people in my life.
Author’s Acknowledgments
First of all, I’d like to thank Lindsay Lefevere at Wiley Publishing for giving me the opportu-
nity to write another For Dummies book and, hopefully, expose more people to the craft of
crochet. Even though crochet is “in” these days, it’s a dying art, and I’d hate to see it go by
the wayside. I want to thank Elizabeth Kuball, my first project editor, and Alissa Schwipps,
my second and final PE, for attempting to keep me on track and for their wonderful insights,
even though I probably gave both of them some sleepless nights. Thanks also go to Vicki
Adang, my copy editor, for her creativity with words and making sense of my sometimes
mixed-up wording.
I have to thank my husband, Paul, and my daughter, Angela, for putting up with piles of yarn,
hooks, and notes scattered throughout the house and my distraction when designing a new
project.
Many thanks go to Lynn Carlisle of Caron Yarns, as well as Kathleen Sams and Terri Geck
at Coats & Clark for so willingly supplying me with some fabulous yarn for many of these
projects.
I also send many thanks to Elizabeth, Chelsea, Savannah, and Lu for helping me out when
this book was in its beginning stages.
And last but not least, thanks to the readers, who I hope get as much enjoyment from reading
this book as I did from writing it.

Crochet Patterns For Dummies 

Introduction
T
here’s nothing like being able to sit down in a favorite chair for a while to catch up on
some much needed down time, whether it’s in the evening after the dinner dishes are
done or on a rainy afternoon. If you’re anything like me, though, you find it hard to just sit.
This is when I like to get my crocheting out and sit and relax, but still be creative at the
same time.
As with any new skill, practice makes perfect. Even after 30-plus years of working with a hook
and yarn, I still learn new techniques and new ways to do old things. Mastering the basics is,
of course, essential, and even if you’ve been crocheting for a while, it never hurts to review
skills that may be a little rusty.
Crochet Patterns For Dummies was written so you can practice and enhance your skills in this
time-honored craft, while at the same time create designs that are both useful and fashionable.
About This Book
The craft of crochet has been around for hundreds of years, originally developed out of
necessity, and then continued throughout the ages because of the beautiful designs that can
be created. I can’t even begin to count the variations of stitches that can be crocheted, but
one thing I can tell you is that they all begin with the basics. For that reason, I give you proj-
ects in this book that allow you to develop a strong foundation of the most commonly used
stitches and stitch patterns.
Patterns’ skill levels are categorized as Beginner, Easy, Intermediate, or Advanced, and some
pattern books note the skill level using one of the following symbols:
I don’t include the symbols in this book because most of the patterns fall into the Beginner
and Easy categories. I note which patterns are more advanced in the pattern introductions.
Each chapter is organized so the patterns graduate from the least to the most complicated,
so you can pick and choose where you want to begin.
Each part of this book focuses on a different aspect of crochet, and the parts are further
broken down into chapters pertaining to specific information, such as
 Hook and yarn information, and how to choose the right materials
 Deciphering crochet lingo, reading a pattern, and understanding garment sizing
Beginner
Easy
Intermediate
Experienced

 A review of the basic stitches and stitch combinations, with a concise appendix
containing step-by-step instructions for working these stitches
 Loads of patterns separated into chapters for specific skills used
To give you an idea of what the projects look like when they’re finished, I include
photos:
 Each set of project instructions within the chapter includes a photo of the com-
pleted item.
 In the center of the book, you can find color photos of the projects. These
photos also give you a better idea about the yarn colors I chose. (Of course, if
you’re not crazy about the yarn I used, you can always branch out on your own
and choose colors that are more suited to your taste.)
Some instructions also include illustrations that show you stitch diagrams or project
dimensions. Some things are easier to visualize than read about, and these illustra-
tions are meant to show you how stitches or sizes relate.
Some projects include a “Variation” section after the basic instructions. This can be as
simple as how to substitute materials, or it can give you ideas about creating a whole
new project from the original pattern. Read these sections even if you don’t want to
employ them. They can expand your knowledge about crochet and how you can adapt
designs and patterns.
The best thing about this book is that you don’t have to read it cover to cover. You
choose where to start. If something looks interesting, go ahead and flip to that chapter.
If you need a refresher on a certain skill used, go ahead and flip back, make a practice
swatch, and then continue on with the project.
Conventions Used in This Book
The following conventions are used throughout the text to make the patterns consis-
tent and easy to understand:
 New terms appear in italic and are closely followed by an easy-to-understand 
definition.
 Bold is used to highlight the action parts of numbered steps and for keywords in
bulleted lists.
 When you see a set of bulleted (•) instructions in this book, work the stitches
through once, and then go back and repeat them the number of times indicated.
 If a new skill is introduced that is not included elsewhere in the book, you’ll find
it listed within that particular pattern under the heading “New skills.” In that sec-
tion, you’ll find step-by-step instructions on how to work that particular stitch.
 The specific part of an illustration that relates to the step you’re working on is
shaded dark gray. For example, if you’re inserting your hook into a certain stitch,
only that stitch is shaded so you can clearly see where to go.
 The patterns included in this book are all written in typical crochet fashion, as
you’d see in any publication. Crochet has a language all its own, most of it abbre-
viated. To brush up on the lingo, see Chapter 4.

Foolish Assumptions
My greatest hope is that, by picking up this book, you are looking to further develop
the crochet skills that you already possess. If you have a working knowledge of the
basics and are ready to take your skills to the next level, then you’ve come to the right
place. This book does contain a little bit of very basic, beginner-level information to
help jog your memory, but you should have at least some prior experience.
If you’re looking to learn to crochet from the start, then look around the bookshelves
for Crocheting For Dummies, the companion book to this one. In that book, you’ll find
in-depth information about crochet from start to finish. If you’re feeling really adven-
turous, pick up both books so you’ll have a complete set.
How This Book Is Organized
This book is divided into five easily identifiable parts, with a total of 17 chapters and
two appendixes. Any brand-new stitches that are introduced within a particular chap-
ter are illustrated in the “New skills” section. If at any point it seems that you need spe-
cific knowledge about a concept, I’ll point you in the right direction.
Part I: Reinforcing Your Crochet Foundation
This part contains all the reference material you need to crochet your way through the
rest of the book. It starts off with choosing the right hook and yarn, and then moves on
to figuring out gauge. Information about reading patterns, sizing garments, and under-
standing stitches and their relationships to each other is included in this section. And
last, but not least, you can refresh your memory about how to change colors correctly,
increasing and decreasing stitches, and crocheting in a circle.
Part II: Hook, Yarn, Action! 
Crocheting Simple Projects
Part II has five chapters packed full of patterns designed to get your fingers moving.
Each chapter focuses on a different aspect of the basic skills. You can choose a project
in which you concentrate on crocheting your stitches evenly, or one that has you
shaping the design through increases and decreases. You can make great accessories
while crocheting in the round, or you can crochet multicolored patterns designed to
get you into the color-changing mode.
Part III: Putting Your Skills to the Test
Ready to take your skills a step further? The patterns in this part of the book combine
all of the basics and more. I include a whole bunch of sweater designs, as well as more
home décor and accessories. You’ll use some slightly more advanced techniques, as
well as see what it’s like to work with unconventional materials such as hemp and
wire.

Introduction

Part IV: The Part of Tens
Not to be outdone, Part IV has loads of patterns as well. Included are quick ’n’ easy
designs that are great for when you need a creative fix. I also came up with a whole
bunch of designs with the younger set in mind. I hope these patterns get them crochet-
ing, but they’re great for you to make as gifts for tweens and teens as well. This part
also contains information on caring for your work after it’s done.
Part V: Appendixes
When you get stuck, turn to this part for a little help. Appendix A walks you through
how to do basic and not-so-basic crochet stitches. Appendix B provides yarn compa-
nies’ names and contact info that you can use when you can’t find the yarn you want in
your neighborhood craft store.
Icons Used in This Book
To make this book easier to read and simpler to use, I include some icons that can help
you find and fathom key ideas and information that are worth taking a second glance at.
This icon appears any time I provide information that can make your work a bit easier
or show you a trick that experienced crocheters have developed over the years.
Any time you see this icon, you should know that the information that follows is impor-
tant. It highlights different points in the skills or pattern that you should remember.
When you see this icon, be sure to read carefully the information that follows. It can
help you avoid common mistakes and pitfalls that can lead to a disastrous finished
design.
Where to Go from Here
The beauty of this book is that you can start anywhere you want. If it’s been a while
since you’ve crocheted, or if you’re still a relative beginner, then by all means start at
the beginning. If you’re ready to jump right in, browse through the project chapters or
take a look at the color insert and choose one that looks like fun. Chapter 12 is all about
sweaters. Chapter 15 has a bunch of patterns that you can make in an hour or so. And
I’ve scattered accessories and home décor items throughout the project chapters.
Remember, though, that you can always seek additional, in-depth information in the
companion book, Crocheting For Dummies. It provides detailed explanations on every-
thing provided in this book.

Reinforcing Your Crochet
Foundation

In this part . . .
T
aking another step into the world of crochet is excit-
ing. Gaining more experience will help you expand
your skills and knowledge of this time-honored craft. Even
the best of us, though, need some refresher information
now and then.
This part of the book provides some basic information
that will never be obsolete. First and foremost, I explain
how to choose the right materials, from hooks to yarn.
Moving on, you can refresh your knowledge of the all-
important concept of gauge, from how to calculate it to
the impact it can have on the final outcome of your fin-
ished piece. You’ll also find some invaluable information
about reading patterns and deciphering the lingo associ-
ated with crochet. And last but not least, I include a review
of the stitches you’ll find throughout the book.
Take some time to glance through this part, and know that
it’s here as a reference for you as you crochet.

Chapter 1
Gearing Up and Getting Started
In This Chapter
 Deciphering the difference between hooks
 Unraveling yarn mysteries
 Collecting other crochet accouterments
 Holding the yarn and hook
W
hen embarking on a new project, gathering the necessary supplies is a must before
you can even think about starting. To begin a new crochet design, you need a hook
and some yarn, and you’re all set to go.
Like most crafts, even those with the simplest needs, there are variations in the tools used.
This chapter covers the differences between the various types of hooks available and when
it’s appropriate to use each type. Additionally, yarns are now available in a huge array of
colors, textures, weights, and compositions. After you have a basic understanding of the
more common yarns available, you will have an easier time choosing which yarn is best for
your project.
And if you want to brush up on the best way to hold your hook and yarn, you’ll find that
information in this chapter, too.
Taking a Look at the Crochet Hook
A hook is one of two essentials for crocheting. (The other being yarn, of course. More on
yarn later.) Choosing the proper crochet hook is essential to your comfort and the outcome
of your design.
Crochet hooks are all basically the same in design. They each have a point, throat, shaft, and
handle, and most (except the largest sizes) have a thumb rest (see Figure 1-1).

Shaft
Point
Figure 1-1:
The
anatomy of

hook.

There are, however, subtle differences in the hook’s shape. Some hooks have rounded
points, which generally work easiest with thicker yarns, while others have sharper
points that are ideal for thin yarns, wire, and other detail work. Some hooks have 
distinct, cutout throats that help to keep the yarn in place on the hook. Others have 
a smoother, more rounded throat, which enables you to work through stitches very
quickly. As for which features to look for on your hook, it’s just a matter of preference.
Practice with every type to see which features you prefer. Sometimes it’s just a matter
of selecting the hook you like best for a particular yarn, stitch, or project.
Considering hook types and construction
Crochet hooks are typically divided into two primary categories, based on the diame-
ter of the hook shaft. You can find hooks ranging from a fraction of a millimeter in
diameter up to hooks larger than your finger. Depending on the size, a hook can be
sorted into two primary categories:
 Standard: These hooks are typically used when crocheting with yarn, and they
range from 2mm up to 20mm in diameter.
 Steel: These hooks are smaller and generally used when working with crochet
thread, size 10 and smaller.
Steel hooks are made of, well, steel. But standard hooks can be made of different mate-
rials including aluminum, plastic, and even wood. The following list helps you weigh
the pros and cons of each material:
 Aluminum: These hooks are lightweight and smooth, helping you work with the
yarn quickly and without catching. Aluminum hooks are some of the easiest to
find and are often coated in a spectrum of colors.
 Plastic: These hooks are also lightweight, but they can feel sticky to work 
with. While inexpensive, some crocheters feel the grippy plastic slows them
down.
 Wood: Crochet hooks can be made out of hard woods such as ebony, rosewood,
and oak with fine woodworking techniques. These hooks are beautiful to look at,
and, when made properly, can be as pleasant to use as your favorite aluminum
workhorse. You also can likely find inexpensive bamboo hooks, even in your
local megastore. These also have a bit more “grip” than aluminum, but many
crafters enjoy how they stay warm in your hands.
For most of your crochet projects, the hook you’ll require is generally 5 to 6 inches
long and falls into one of the above categories. Don’t be surprised to read about — or
see in the store — other hook-ended tools, including
 Afghan hooks: These hooks range from 12 to 16 inches in length, with a hook at
one end and a knob at the other. These hooks are used for afghan or Tunisian
stitches that require you to keep more than one loop on the hook shaft. For
examples of some of these projects, check out Chapter 13.
 Double ended crochet hooks: Also long like afghan hooks, these tools have a
hook at each end. They are used for something called double ended crochet,
which makes a thick and reversible fabric.

Part I: Reinforcing Your Crochet Foundation 

Selecting the right size
There are two separate sizing categories when it comes to hooks, one for standard
hooks and one for steel hooks. Knowing which is which is invaluable. The pattern that
you’re working from will give you the size hook used to crochet the original design.
This is especially important because not only is it the proper size for the type of yarn
used, but it also determines the size of the stitch it creates, which determines the
gauge (see Chapter 2 for detailed gauge info). The gauge, in turn, determines the final
size of the design.
Hooks come in a wide range of sizes (see Figure 1-2) and are labeled accordingly (most
standard hooks are labeled with both the U.S. and Continental sizes). The labels are
sometimes embossed on the side of the shaft. On other hooks, you may see a raised
letter or number on the round end of the shaft. Hooks with padded or “comfort” grips
may display this information on the grip.
In the U.S. and Canada, standard hooks are labeled using letters, with B on the small
end and S on the large end. In the U.S. and Canada, steel hooks are labeled using num-
bers. These hooks range from the smallest fraction of a millimeter to about 2 millime-
ters in diameter. Table 1-1 gives the most common sizes for steel crochet hooks and
standard crochet hooks. Take note that the U.S. and U.K. sizes for steel hooks are the
opposite of what you’d expect — the larger the number, the smaller the hook. And the
U.K. sizes for standard hooks are a bit backwards, too — the smaller the number, the
larger the hook.

Keeping your hooks in tiptop shape
Over time, you’ll build up quite a collection of hooks. And although hooks aren’t
expensive, you don’t want to have to run out and buy the same hook over and over
again because you damaged or lost the first one you bought in that size. Follow this
advice to keep your hooks like new and safe:
 Cleaning: You may not think this is too important or wonder how the hooks get
dirty. But if you stop to think about it, it becomes obvious. The hook is tucked in
your hand or between your fingers for each and every stitch you work, and your
hands have natural oils that protect the skin. Over time, these oils build up on
your hook and may rub off on your yarn.
• For your steel hooks, a good soaking in rubbing alcohol does the trick.
Follow the bath by rubbing down the hook with a clean, soft cloth.
• Aluminum and plastic hooks benefit from a thorough washing with a mild
detergent. Dry completely before storage.
• Wood hooks are a bit trickier to clean. Although most have been lacquered
or coated to resist splintering, it’s not advisable to soak or scrub the hook.
Instead, use a damp cloth to wipe clean. Be sure to dry it with a clean towel
almost immediately.
10
Part I: Reinforcing Your Crochet Foundation 

 Storing: Proper storage ensures that the hook you need for your next project 
is ready, willing, and able for work when you are. Invest in a case specially 
made to store hooks. They are readily available at craft and yarn shops. If you
can’t find one, or don’t want one, roll your hooks in a piece of felt, keeping them
separated.
Throwing your hooks in a bag or box can cause them to bang together, creating
pits, which in turn can cause snags in the yarn as you work. Plastic hooks can
bend and become warped as well as pit.
Comprehending Yarn Complexities
When I first started crocheting, choosing yarn wasn’t much more difficult than decid-
ing which color to use. Aside from crochet thread, there were only a couple different
sizes, and no interesting textures. Colors were either solid or variegated (meaning they
contain multiple colors). As I’m sure you’ve seen, that’s not the case today. Just walk
into the yarn aisle of your favorite craft store or any yarn shop, and you can literally
spend hours sorting through the variety of colors and textures available.
Most of the time, you’ll decide to make a particular project based on how the item
looks; you like the overall design and the material it’s made with. Although pictures
are nice, you can’t always see all the details, and understanding what type of yarn 
is used to craft the project can go a long way in determining if you’ll really like 
the finished design. The important points to note about the materials can be found 
on the yarn label. Pay close attention to yarn size or weight and yarn content, 
but don’t be afraid to mix it up. The “A ply for a ply: Swapping yarns” section tells 
you how.
A light discussion of yarn weights
When the word weight is used in relation to yarn, it generally means the thickness of
the yarn. The thicker the yarn, the larger the stitches you’ll be able to create.
Yarns are labeled with any of about a dozen names that all describe the weight of the
yarn. You may see the words “worsted,” “aran,” “double knitting,” “sport,” or “chunky.”
All of these words (and several more) roughly correspond to the thickness of the yarns.
So, if a pattern asks for a chunky yarn, you can’t really use a substantially thinner sport
weight and expect the same results. But you can expect all worsted-weight yarns to cro-
chet to more or less the same fabric. These yarn weights correspond to the gauge, or
number of stitches per inch, that you can expect to obtain while crocheting.
Figure 1-3 compares some of the more common weights and textures, but keep in mind
that the photo is far from inclusive.
Over the course of the last few years, the yarn industry has been making inroads into
standardizing yarn weights. This is really a wonderful effort because one particular
weight of yarn can be called several different names (for example, yarns categorized as
worsted, afghan, and aran all have the same weight). Figure 1-4 shows the new sym-
bols in use and the weights (or sizes) of yarn they represent.

So if you really love a project but don’t like the suggested yarn, you can use the yarn-
weight symbol to find another yarn of the same weight that will work just as well for
the item. If the yarn or the pattern you like doesn’t use a standard yarn-weight symbol,
you can still substitute effectively. Just look at the gauge information provided on the
ball band (or yarn label) and pattern and make sure they match. (Chapter 2 goes into
more detail on the concept of gauge.)

Part I: Reinforcing Your Crochet Foundation 

Understanding what your yarn is made of
Something to keep in mind when working with yarn is its composition. Do you prefer
manmade materials, or are you a natural person? Yarns are readily available in both,
and sometimes it comes down to your favorite choice. Garments are especially nice if
they’re made of natural fibers such as wool, silk, or cotton, while items such as afghans
lend themselves to synthetic fibers, such as acrylic, mainly because of the reasonable
cost and ease of care.
When beginning to crochet, most people find it easiest to learn on a smooth wool or
wool/acrylic blend. Although pure acrylic yarns are often the most inexpensive and eas-
iest to find, they don’t have much elasticity. When you’re just starting out, this means
your stitches may look more uneven than in a wool or wool-blend yarn. Slippery fibers,
such as cotton or silk, create beautiful fabric but can be tough for an inexperienced cro-
cheter to keep on the hook. After a little experience, you’ll be able to crochet wonder-
fully with any yarn.
As far as price is concerned, on the cheaper end of the scale are usually pure acrylic
and other manmade yarns. On the high end are cashmere, silk, and other luxury fibers.
Workhorse wools, cottons, and blends of more than one fiber type fall in the middle of
the spectrum.
When looking for yarns of different fiber types, be aware that every store carries a dif-
ferent range of products. Although you may have a great variety of budget acrylic yarns
at your local megastore, you may have to go to specialty yarn shops for pure silks and
wools. But this is changing. It’s now not uncommon to find great quality natural fibers in
some of the same stores that were long known for carrying only synthetics.
Most patterns, however, specify a particular yarn because it makes the design what 
it is, so keep that in mind if you substitute a different brand or type of yarn. No 
matter what you do, that fluffy wool yarn won’t look the same as a shiny cotton when
crocheted.
Unraveling a yarn label
Whether packaged in a neat little ball, a long, log-like pull-skein, or a twisted skein or
hank, all yarns come with a label that gives you invaluable information about it’s possi-
ble use with your project. As shown in Figure 1-5, all the information necessary to
choose the right yarn can be found in one small space.

information

Chapter 1: Gearing Up and Getting Started

Yarn labels typically include most, if not all of the following information:
1. Article number: This is a code that the manufacturer uses to keep track of differ-
ent products, and you won’t always find an article number on a ball of yarn.
2. Brand name: This is the name of the yarn. For example, “Silk Purse,” “Baby Soft,”
or “Regia 4ply.”
3. Care instructions: Is easy care important to the project? If so, look for yarns labeled
“Superwash” or that give care instructions that allow for machine wash and dry.
More delicate yarns will tell you to hand wash or dry clean to prevent shrinking.
4. Color name and number: A particular yarn color is given a name or a number
(or sometimes both) by the manufacturer.
5. Company name and logo: The manufacturer’s name and logo will be promi-
nently displayed on the label. Note that this should not be confused with the
brand name of the yarn.
6. Dye lot number: Yarns that have been machine or hand dyed will include an
identifying number that relates to the batch, or lot, in which the yarn was dyed.
When a project requires more than one skein or ball of yarn, be sure to purchase
yarn from the same dye lot if you want the colors to match perfectly. Yarns from
different dye lots can have subtle (or not-so-subtle) variations in color that could
have you seeing stripes.
7. Gauge: The suggested gauge, or number of stitches that fit in 4 inches, is often
given on the label. Sometimes only a gauge in knitting is provided. Knitted gauge is
given generically, such as “20 sts = 4 inches,” and does not relate to the crochet
gauge at all. More often than not, though, both knit and crochet gauges are given.
For crochet, look for any crochet stitch abbreviation, usually “sc” (single crochet),
or a small picture of a crochet hook next to a number. For example, “12 sc = 
4 inches” is an example of crochet gauge.
8. Manufacturer’s address: The yarn manufacturer’s location is sometimes pro-
vided. It can be helpful if you need to find another source for its yarns.
Increasingly, the manufacturer’s Web site is being added, which can be a great
resource for yarn information and sometimes free patterns.
9. Ply: Occasionally, a yarn label will provide ply information, such as 2 ply, 4 ply, or
12 ply, which means the number of strands that are twisted together to create
the yarn. The number of plies does not correspond to the crochet gauge or the
yarn weight. For example, it’s possible to have a super-thick 2-ply or a super-thin
12-ply yarn, or vice versa.
10. Recommended hook size: When a crocheted gauge is given, a recommended
hook size to obtain that gauge is also provided. You may need a different size
hook to obtain the same gauge as the ball band or for the gauge provided in the
pattern. (Read Chapter 2 for more details on gauge.)
11. Weight: The physical weight of the ball or skein of yarn will be listed. This may
be in grams or ounces or both, depending on the country of origin.
12. Yardage: The length of the yarn will be given in yards and/or meters depending 
on the country of origin. Be sure to buy enough yards for your project. Don’t be
tempted to buy by weight only. Different types of yarn, even at the same thickness,
contain vastly different yards per gram or ounce, and you don’t want to run short.
13. Fiber content: By law, every commercially available yarn must include a detailed
description of its fiber content. For example, you may see “100% merino wool” or
blends such as “65% acrylic, 15% nylon, 15% elasten, 5% cotton.”
14. Yarn-weight symbol: Many yarn companies are beginning to include this symbol,
handy for yarn substitution, provided your pattern also includes the symbol.
(See the earlier section, “A light discussion of yarn weights,” for more on these
symbols.)
14
Part I: Reinforcing Your Crochet Foundation 

A ply for a ply: Swapping yarns
Most patterns will tell you specifically which yarn to use for best results, but never
forget that you have the option to substitute another yarn. Let your imagination go.
With all the choices available, there’s no reason not to make some changes to suit your
own taste. (Appendix B contains a list of yarn companies and their Web addresses for
your browsing pleasure.)
Changing yarn can be as simple as choosing a different color of the same yarn used in
the original pattern, or much more complex by picking a different yarn altogether. If
you prefer wool and the pattern uses an acrylic yarn, you can look for a substitute.
Just be sure to keep the following in mind:
 Weight (or thickness): If the pattern calls for a worsted- (or medium-) weight
yarn, stick to that. Using a chunky-weight yarn (yarn that is heavier than
worsted-weight) or sport-weight yarn (yarn that is lighter) will alter your results
dramatically.
This is where the yarn-weight symbols come in handy. If your pattern and the
yarn you want both use the symbols, be sure they match. Otherwise, check the
gauge section of the yarn label and pattern to be sure the yarns crochet simi-
larly. If your pattern gives only crocheted gauge, and the yarn label only knitted
gauge, you may have to research the pattern yarn to determine its knitted gauge.
This way, you can compare knitted gauges of the pattern yarn and the yarn you
want to use. If the knitted gauges are the same, the new yarn you’ve chosen will
substitute nicely. (You can research knitted gauge on the Internet or by asking at
your local yarn store.)
 Yardage: Make sure to purchase enough yarn. Every type and brand of yarn
varies in terms of the yards per ball or skein. Even when buying a worsted-
weight skein from company X and one from Y, you may see a difference in 
yards per skein. For example, if your pattern calls for 5 balls of X at 100 yards 
a ball, and you buy 5 balls of Y at 80 yards a ball, you’ll be short by a full ball!
Buying enough yarn at the beginning of your project is important because most
yarns have dye lots (see the “Unraveling a yarn label” section). Although you
may not be able to see the subtle differences in color before the yarn is worked,
when your piece is crocheted, you probably won’t like the contrast. Better to be
safe than sorry. Most shops will let you exchange or return unused, unopened
skeins of yarn if you purchase too much.
Getting Your Fingers Moving
Whether you’re brand-new to crochet or you learned the stitches years ago, it’s well
worth a few minutes to get a refresher on how to hold the hook and yarn and get
started for your first few stitches.
To get started, you’ll need a ball of yarn and a hook. Many beginners choose to prac-
tice using a size H-8 U.S. hook and worsted- or aran-weight yarn. Smooth yarn is easiest
to work with at this point; too much texture makes it hard to see what you’re holding.
Most of the instructions in this book are from a right-hander’s perspective, but if
you’re a lefty, the same rules apply. You probably already have practice reversing 
directions, but here are a few tips to help you work from your point of view:

Chapter 1: Gearing Up and Getting Started

 Mirror it: Hold the picture up to a mirror to get a reverse view. It may feel a bit
clumsy, but it should work well enough to get you going.
 Flip it: If you have a computer with a scanner, scan the illustration, and then use
the photo software to flip the illustration horizontally. If you don’t have a scan-
ner, pull out some tracing paper and a pencil, trace the photo, and then view it
from the opposite side.
 Go righty: Try crocheting the right-handed way. You may be surprised to find
that you’re ambidextrous.
Holding the hook and yarn
Even though you use just one hook for crochet, both hands are involved in the action.
Your dominant hand, the one you write with, holds and moves the hook. Your other
hand is responsible for holding and tensioning the yarn.
You can hold the hook in one of two ways: over the hook, as in Figure 1-6, and under
the hook, as in Figure 1-7. Neither grip is better or worse than the other. It’s just a
matter of what feels best in your hand.
Now, you use your other hand to get a hold on the yarn. If you’re right-handed, you use
your left hand. If you’re a lefty, you use your right. Although you can work with the
yarn many different ways, here’s one of the more common methods (see Figure 1-8):
1. With the ball or skein positioned below your hand, bring the yarn up between
your ring and little fingers.
2. Wrap the yarn around your little finger to create a loop.
This keeps the yarn from moving too quickly through your fingers, causing loose
and sloppy stitches.
3. Bring the yarn under your ring and middle fingers, and up to the top of your
hand between your middle and forefinger.

When you close your little, ring, and middle fingers to hold the yarn, you can use your
forefinger to raise or lower the yarn. While you crochet, it’s important to pay attention
to the tension of the yarn. If it feels too loose, take time to readjust, working through
the above steps.
Working with the hook and yarn together
You’re comfortable holding your hook. You know how to control the yarn. Now you’re
ready to get the yarn on the hook and get crocheting. It all starts with a slipknot:
1. With about 6 inches of yarn, make a loop that looks like a pretzel (see 
Figure 1-9).
2. Insert your hook through the center of the loop, draw the yarn through the
loop, and pull on the tail to tighten.
The slipknot should be loose enough to slide easily along the hook, but tight
enough to avoid falling off. See Figure 1-10.
When you put everything together, your setup should look like Figure 1-11 or Fig-
ure 1-12, depending on which hand you use and whether you hold the hook underhand
or overhand.
If this feels awkward at first, don’t worry. With a little practice, you’ll be able to get set
up to crochet within seconds, without really thinking about it.

It’s in the Bag: Completing Your Crochet Kit
In addition to keeping the work off the couch and out of reach of pets, kids, and acci-
dental spills, the advantages of keeping your yarn, pattern, finished pieces, notions,
notes, and work-in-progress all together are numerous. With a dedicated crochet bag,
you can quickly grab your project as you head off for a weekend away, an afternoon at
a friend’s house, or to a needlework guild meeting.
As simple and inexpensive as a leftover tote bag, or as luxurious as a just-for-
crocheters designer bag, a dedicated place to store your project is a practical invest-
ment. If you’ve got multiple projects under way, consider placing each one inside a
large freezer storage bag or other clear pouch so you can easily identify which is
which.
It probably goes without saying that pets love yarn. It’s soft, it’s squishy, and it some-
times tastes like sheep. Although it may be cute to watch your kitten bat around a ball
of yarn, it sets you up for a lifetime of problems when you go to work on your crochet.
Much worse than that, even ingesting a few inches of yarn can cause a life-threatening
emergency or death. Be safe. Always keep an eye on your yarn, and put it well out of
reach in a closed crochet bag when you’re not around.
Few things are more frustrating than getting ready to finish a project late at night and
realizing that you’re missing the yarn needle to sew it all together. Putting together a
crochet kit, containing some inexpensive but often-used items, can help your projects
go a lot more smoothly. Consider purchasing a small, zippered cosmetics pouch or
other container to keep everything together and easily found in your crochet bag.
This list includes a few items that, although not always necessary, are great additions
to your crochet kit. You probably already have most of them around the house — just
gather them together and put them in a spot with your crochet hooks.

 Scissors: Try to find a small, blunt-nosed but sharp-bladed pair for snipping
ends.
 Hard ruler: A 6-inch (or smaller) inflexible ruler is helpful for measuring your
gauge.
 Fabric tape measure: Look for a retractable fabric tape measure for keeping
track of your progress as you crochet. You also can use this tape measure for
taking body measurements when crocheting a sweater, hat, or other garment.
 Pins: Straight pins, such as the type that sewers use, are handy when it comes
time to sew your project together.
 Removable stitch markers or coil-less safety pins: Your craft or yarn store 
sells pouches of plastic stitch markers with an opening on one side. These are
designed to go around the stitch itself and be removed easily later. Some cro-
cheters prefer safety pins without the coil on one end. (The coil tends to snag.)
Unless you’re also a knitter, don’t buy the solid stitch markers that are designed
to sit on a knitting needle. You’ll only have to cut them out of your work later.
 Yarn and tapestry needles: Consider purchasing a range of yarn needles in dif-
ferent sizes for different projects. Because these are small, they’ll get lost easily,
but you’ll need one for weaving your ends and stitching project pieces together.
 Pencil and paper: Keeping track of your pattern progress can be helpful. A small
notebook or pad of paper, plus a pencil or pen, makes life easier.

Gauge and Garments: 
Sizing Facts and Figures
In This Chapter
 Creating a gauge swatch
 Figuring out those measurements
 Selecting the proper size
E
veryone always talks about the importance of gauge, but what exactly is gauge? Why
should you be so careful about attaining the same gauge as the pattern specifies?
Simply put, gauge is the ratio of a given number of stitches and/or rows to inches (or other
given measurement). You’ll see it written like this:
Gauge: 12 sc and 8 rows = 4 in.
The reason gauge is so important is that the finished size of the pattern you’re crocheting is
based on this measurement. Now, if you’re making an afghan and the finished size is off by a
couple of inches, it’s not quite so critical. But on the other hand, if it’s a sweater you’re
making, being a few inches off could have a disastrous effect on the end result.
This chapter covers the basics of gauge — how to practice getting it right, how to measure it,
and how to correct your gauge if you’re off. I also talk about pattern sizes and how to make
sure you get the fit you want when you’re making sweaters, hats, skirts, and the like. Don’t let
the numbers scare you. They’re necessary for making everything turn out just right!
Practicing with a Gauge Swatch
The best way to ensure that you’re working to the proper gauge is to crochet a gauge swatch,
which is a reduced sample of the pattern. This allows you to work a small section of fabric to
see how close you are to the given measurements. It also gives you the opportunity to prac-
tice the stitch pattern, which is really nice if it’s a complicated one or is comprised of
stitches you haven’t worked before.
Working a gauge swatch is a very simple process and only takes a few minutes. If you’re like
me, you probably want to jump right in and start working on the project itself. But, again if
you’re like me, you’ve done this and cried over the finished design, wondering why it didn’t
come out right. Nine times out of ten the answer will be — the gauge was off.
Getting the gauge right is very important. Don’t skip this step.

Making a swatch
You need to make a gauge swatch whether you’re working in rows or rounds:
 Stitching a square: To get an accurate measurement, the swatch should be at
least 4 inches square, but it can be larger depending on the pattern. Read the
gauge specifications at the beginning of the pattern, and then work the stitches
for that pattern that accommodate those measurements.
 Working a round: The measurements given for a circular gauge will tell you what
the diameter is for a given number of rounds. Follow the instructions for the pat-
tern, being sure to crochet an extra few rounds above and beyond the number
given for the gauge. This ensures that you can take a measurement in the middle
of the piece, because the first and last round may be shorter or taller than a
normal round, depending on the stitches used.
Typically, simple patterns that use one or two stitches repeated will give the gauge
over 4 inches. For example, 12 sc and 8 rows measure 4 inches square. In this case,
you would chain a few more stitches than noted and work rows of single crochet, with-
out increasing or decreasing, until you’ve worked a few more rows than required.
To put this theory into practice, you can try your hand at making a quick gauge swatch
using the double crochet stitch. Grab some yarn and a hook — anything will do.
Gauge: 11 dc = 4 in.
1. Chain 20, turn, work one double crochet in the 4th chain from the hook, work
one double crochet in each chain across.
2. Continue to work in rows of double crochet until the square measures slightly
more than 4 inches square.
When you’ve finished your swatch, take a set of gauge measurements. Then you can
finish the swatch as you would the finished design, which typically involves blocking, a
process that evens out the stitches and allows you to shape the piece. Depending on
the type of yarn (don’t forget to read the label), you can usually just wet or steam the
swatch, shape it, and allow it to dry. Then take another set of measurements. This will
give you an accurate gauge.
Your measurements may change, so if necessary, you should adjust your hook size
based on the second set of measurements, which reflects a more accurate gauge. 
This is especially important when making garments: If your gauge shrinks (or grows)
after blocking, you’ll end up with a different size garment than you intended, which
wouldn’t do at all.
Determining whether you’re on the right track
Whether you’re measuring an unblocked or a blocked swatch, you want to obtain the
most accurate measurement possible, both in terms of stitches and rows. Specifically,
you measure the swatch from side to side, counting the stitches, and from bottom to
top, counting the rows.
When counting stitches and measuring rows, always use the center of the square
swatch, rather than going from edge to edge (see Figure 2-1). Compare your measure-
ment to those given in the pattern to determine the accuracy of your stitches. And
make sure to position your ruler or tape measure evenly across the stitches and rows.
22
Part I: Reinforcing Your Crochet Foundation 

To measure stitches:
1. Place the ruler at the left edge of a stitch and measure across to the left edge
of another stitch (see Figure 2-1a).
Make sure the ruler is level across the top of the row below.
2. Count the stitches that you have in the 4 inches.
The number of stitches you count should equal the gauge given for the pattern.
You can count half stitches too. If you’re even a half of a stitch off, your finished
piece may be several inches too big (or too small).
It’s essential to count accurately; don’t stretch or distort your crochet to get the
“right” number. If your gauge isn’t perfect the first time around, you can change hook
size later to get everything right.
To measure rows:
1. Align the ruler’s edge vertically to the side edge of the stitches, making sure
it’s evenly positioned (see Figure 2-1b).
2. Count rows, keeping track of any partial rows.
Because a crochet row can be quite tall, you need to measure as accurately as
possible. Again, in an ideal world, the number of rows will match the gauge given
in the pattern.
You can use these steps to measure the gauge of the practice swatch you made in the
last section to see how close your gauge is to the one given in the pattern. And if your
gauge is off (either in rows or stitches), don’t fret. The next section, “Making adjust-
ments,” helps you correct the problem.
When measuring gauge in the round, measure from the outside edges of the given
round through the center of the swatch (see Figure 2-2). Figure 2-2a shows three
rounds of double crochet stitches that equal 31⁄2 inches in diameter. Figure 2-2b shows
two rounds of a motif that equal 3 inches in diameter across the widest point.

Chapter 2: Gauge and Garments: Sizing Facts and Figures

If, after you measure your swatch, the gauge is right on, then you’re good to go, and
you can jump right in to the project. However, if you have too many stitches, then
you’re crocheting too tight and you have to loosen up a bit. If you have too few
stitches, then you’re too loose and need to tighten up. But don’t try to adjust your cro-
chet tension to correct the problem! The next section tells you what to do instead.
Making adjustments
The best way to achieve the correct gauge is to change hook size. If your stitches are
too tight, use the next larger hook size. If they’re too loose, use the next smaller size.
It’s okay to use a different hook size because the gauge of the finished piece is way
more important than what hook you use to create it. And when you change hook size,
make another swatch to make sure the gauge is correct.
Don’t try to adjust your crocheting! Everyone has a natural way to crochet, and if you
try to change your method, you’ll invariably end up right back where you started.
Sizing Your Garment
This section covers a subject that I dearly wish clothing manufacturers would pay
more attention to — sizing. I’m sure you’ve noticed that just because a label says a
sweater is a certain size, it doesn’t mean it really is that size. This makes me absolutely
crazy when I shop — the stuff I can wear spans three different sizes, and I don’t even
know which one is correct anymore. There are, however, standards in sizing, even if
many manufacturers don’t pay much attention to them.
The good news is that when you’re making your own clothing, you can pay attention to
sizing and get the fit just right. You can take basic measurements, decide how you want
the garment to fit, and then figure out which size to make to meet your particular needs.
Tale of the tape: Taking 
accurate measurements
To ensure that the finished garment you’re crocheting actually fits, you must first take
correct body measurements. This isn’t difficult or time consuming; you just have to
know where to measure. To take accurate measurements, make sure to have a fabric
tape measure on hand.

Part I: Reinforcing Your Crochet Foundation 

When taking your measurements, it’s easiest (and more accurate) to ask someone else
for help! Also, be sure to take your measurements often; don’t just rely on numbers
from a few years back.
Sweaters and vests
Most garment patterns give specific finished measurements for things such as bust,
waist, back length, and sleeve length. These finished measurements, in most cases, are
designed to be a few inches larger than your actual body measurements. This concept
is called ease. So, to select the right size, think about how you want the sweater or
vest to fit.
 Do you want it fairly close to your body? If so, selecting a size an inch or so
larger than your actual chest measurement is the way to go.
 If you’d like a bit more room, select a size 2–4 inches larger than your actual
measurement.
 Is the garment supposed to be quite oversized? Go for even more ease.
What you plan on wearing underneath impacts sizing too. If you’re wearing the top
over a close-fitting camisole, you’ll need less ease than if you plan to wear it over a
heavy turtleneck.
If you match up your measurements to the corresponding size in the pattern, your fin-
ished sweater or vest will fit just the way you want (assuming your gauge follows the
pattern specifications). Figure 2-3 shows how to measure various areas to ensure a
great outcome.
 Chest or bust (1): Measure around the fullest part of your model’s chest or bust.
Don’t draw the tape too tightly or measure while inhaling or exhaling.
 Center back, neck-to-cuff (2): With the model’s arm slightly bent, measure from
the back base of the neck, across the shoulder, and around the bend of the elbow
to the wrist.
 Back waist length (3): Measure from the most prominent bone at the base of the
neck to the model’s natural waistline.

Chapter 2: Gauge and Garments: Sizing Facts and Figures

 Cross back (4): Measure from shoulder to shoulder.
 Sleeve length (5): With your model’s arm slightly bent, measure from her armpit
to cuff.
 Back hip length (6): Measure from the top of the model’s shoulder to the top of
the hip.
Hats
For an accurate head measurement, place a tape measure across the forehead and
measure around the full circumference of the head. Keep the tape snug for accurate
results. Figure 2-4 shows you how.
Skirts
For skirts, a waist measurement is most helpful. Before measuring, think about where
the skirt should hang. Will it sit at the natural waist or lower on the hips? Wrap the
tape measure around the body at the position where you want the top edge of the
skirt’s waistband to hit and take the reading.
After you’ve determined the position of the skirt’s waistband, tie a string or length of
yarn loosely around the body at this position. Then, beginning at this line, let the
measuring tape hang straight down. Get a friend to help, or look in a mirror, to deter-
mine the hem length you’d like.
Fit to be sized: Adjusting the fit
After you’ve chosen the proper size for the project you want to crochet (see the previ-
ous section), you can think about some simple adjustments. The length of a garment is
generally the easiest to adjust.
Sweaters and vests
Whether you’re crocheting a top for a woman, child, or man, taking a few additional
measurements can help you adjust the length of the pattern.
Figure 2-4:
Measuring
head cir-
cumference.
26
Part I: Reinforcing Your Crochet Foundation 

 For a waist-length garment, take the measurement from the top of the model’s
shoulder down to the place where her pants sit.
 For a hip-length garment, measure past the top of the pants by 2 or 3 inches.
 For a tunic length, your measurement will be even longer, up to mid-thigh.
Now, compare the measurement for the length you want to the finished length listed in
the pattern. If the woman’s jacket you like has a finished length of 20 inches for your
size, but you’d like it to be more of a coat length, your desired finished measurement
may be 24 or 26 inches.
If you want to add additional length, do it before any waist shaping on a woman’s gar-
ment or any time after the hem on a child or man’s garment.
If the sweater you want to crochet isn’t sized large (or small) enough in the chest, it’s
generally too difficult to rewrite the pattern to allow for the change in width, unless
you’d like to take on a big project. Instead, consider using a thicker (or thinner) yarn
for slight adjustments. Or search for another pattern.
Hats
The easiest adjustment to make to a hat pattern is to alter the length of the hat. Want a
hat with a fold-up brim? Increase the length by enough inches to compensate for the
fold. How about adding a flared brim? If the hat is worked from the top down, add
some increases a few rows before finishing, and you’ll have a floppy, ruffled edge.
Skirts
If you want to change the length of a skirt, consider its shape. For a skirt with little or
no shaping, like a straight pencil skirt, you can shorten or lengthen at any point
between the hem and the waist.
For skirts with more shaping, such as flouncy or A-line shapes, think about where you
want the length to be altered. Adding length at the widest portion will make the skirt
seem fuller all around, while removing length here will make it slimmer. Making adjust-
ments to the slimmer portion of the skirt will have the opposite effect. You may
choose to add (or subtract) a little length in both places to keep the look proportional.
Picking the Right Pattern Size
The following charts will help when determining which pattern size is correct (see
Tables 2-1, 2-2, 2-3, 2-4, and 2-5). Take your measurements, or those for whom the
sweater will be made, and choose the size in the pattern you’re making that corre-
sponds the best. Don’t worry if your numbers don’t match the pattern exactly — a half
inch or an inch here and there won’t make a huge difference, but if in doubt, go to the
next larger size. Decide how much ease you’d like in the sweater (see the “Tale of the
tape: Taking accurate measurements” section earlier in the chapter), then pick the size
that comes closest to that measurement. If you can’t take measurements of the person
for whom the sweater is being made, the charts in this section should help you deter-
mine which size should fit best.
If you’re wondering where the chart is for skirt sizes, I’m sorry to say you won’t find
one. In the crochet world, skirt sizes haven’t been standardized because the fit
depends on whether the skirt is meant to hang from your hips or your waist. The Craft
Yarn Council, the group that works on standardizing measurements, hasn’t provided a
chart for skirt sizing yet.

Chapter 2: Gauge and Garments: Sizing Facts and Figures

Even though this book doesn’t include patterns for babies, children, or men, the size
charts for these folks are still useful to have. You never know when you’ll need to cro-
chet a garment for someone in this group.
The last thing to keep in mind is that patterns are far from standardized. The measure-
ments in the following charts have been in use for many years, and are pretty accu-
rate, but always check each pattern individually, and don’t assume the measurements
given will match the numbers below.

esides knowing how to make the stitches, the most important aspect of crocheting is
being able to read a pattern. At first glance, patterns may appear to be nothing more
than a lot of gibberish, but that’s simply not so. If you think about all the stitches that go into
a project, be it large or small, and realize that each stitch has to be written out in some form
or another, you realize why creating an abbreviated language was necessary. Imagine the
length of a crochet pattern if each stitch had to be written out — you’d have what amounts
to an epic novel for each one.
In an effort to keep instructions relatively short and uncluttered, crochet patterns and dia-
grams are created using abbreviations and symbols. The language has developed over the
years and is relatively simple and mostly common sense. The more patterns that you read,
the easier it becomes to recognize each abbreviation and symbol. Pretty soon it’ll become
just like a second language, and you won’t have to put much thought into it at all.
Interpreting the Written Instructions
A crochet pattern is more than just a set of abbreviations and symbols. In addition to line-by-
line directions, it includes everything you need to know to replicate the item as pictured.
From yarn quantities to hook sizes to any additional notes about the pattern construction,
you’ll find it all in a well-written crochet pattern.
Always read the section at the very beginning of the pattern. This is where you find all the
crucial information you need before you get started: yarn, hook size, gauge, garment sizes
(if applicable), and any special stitches used in the pattern. Be sure to pay attention to
special stitches because they vary from pattern to pattern, and practice any that you’re
unfamiliar with. (For hints on making a practice swatch, flip to Chapter 2.)
Always read through the pattern instructions before you get started. If you come across any
instructions that seem confusing or that you don’t quite understand, read through the pat-
tern again. Eventually, it’ll make sense, or you can ask someone to explain it to you. It’s better
to figure out complicated instructions before you get started than to have to rip out work
that’s not right.

Understanding the abbreviations
When it comes to the written instructions, it’s clearer and more efficient to use a series
of standardized abbreviations. For instance, instead of writing out single crochet stitch
each time it’s used in a pattern, the instruction will just say sc. You’ll notice that there
are generally no periods after an abbreviation, unless it comes at the end of a sentence.
This keeps the instructions from getting too cluttered. But when it comes to in, I put a
period after it to designate the abbreviation for inches (in.), so you don’t think I mean
the word in.
Table 3-1 lists the most commonly used abbreviations (there’s also a handy pocket ver-
sion of these abbreviations on the Cheat Sheet at the front of the book). Although the
list is by no means all-inclusive, all of the abbreviations in the patterns found in this
book are contained in the list. So if you get stuck while working one of the patterns, flip
to this table for a memory boost.

Taking note of common terms
In addition to stitch abbreviations, other phrases that you’ll frequently run across
refer to where to work stitches or how to proceed with the pattern without having to
actually write out each and every stitch, row, or round. The following list contains
some commonly used terms:
 Space: A space usually refers to the space that’s created by 1 or 2 chain stitches
worked between other stitches. To work in a ch-space, insert your hook into the
space underneath the chain stitches and complete the specified stitch.
 Loop: A loop is 3 or more chain stitches worked in a row. Ch-loops are quite often
seen in lacy patterns and threadwork. To work in a ch-loop, insert your hook
underneath the loop and not into any particular chain stitch.
 Work across: Crochet the designated stitches across the whole length of the row.
 Work around: Crochet the same stitch or pattern repeatedly until you come
back to where you started.
 Work to within last st: Crochet following the pattern until you have one stitch left
in the row or round. The instructions will tell you what to do with this last stitch.
You may also see this for 2, 3, or more stitches at the end of a row or round.
 Established pat: This phrase is most often seen when crocheting garments. The
stitch pattern will be written out in the first few lines of the instruction, then,
rather than keep writing out the same thing over and over, you’ll be told to work
in established pat, which means to repeat the stitch pattern over and over until
the instructions tell you to do something else.
 Work even: This means to continue crocheting on the same number of stitches
that you currently have on your work without making any increases or decreases.
Deciphering the symbols
When you read a crochet pattern, you’ll notice some punctuation and symbols that you
don’t encounter very often in everyday reading. Bullets, brackets, and parentheses
appear all over the place in written instructions, and each one has its own meaning (or
in some cases, more than one meaning). You must be able to interpret these symbols
correctly or you may be in for a big surprise when you get to the end of your design.
Whether working in rounds or rows, punctuation serves the same purpose.
33
Chapter 3: Sum and Substance: Reading a Pattern

Bouncing bullets
Because crochet patterns tend to have repeating sets of stitches that you work across an
entire row or round, it makes sense to write them only once, then instruct you to repeat
them a given number of times. Several different symbols are used to denote the repeats,
such as bullets (•), asterisks (*), plus signs (+), and crosses (†). Bullets and asterisks are
the most common, and throughout this book, I use bullets in the patterns.
Single bullets
Bullets are used basically two different ways:
 To enclose an entire phrase, with a bullet at each end
 At the beginning of a phrase, with repeat instructions immediately following
Either way is correct; it really just depends on the preference of the publication.
For a repeat that has only one bullet, you’ll see something like this:
• Sc in next st, ch 1, skip next st, rep from • 4 times.
In plain English, this means to work the stitches after the bullet once, then repeat
those same stitches 4 more times for a total of 5 times.
If you see a phrase that has bullets at both ends, enclosing the entire phrase, it may
look like this:
Ch 3, • dc in each of next 2 sts, ch 2, skip next 2 sts •, rep from • to • twice, dc in
each of next 5 sts, ch 2, skip next 2 sts, rep from • to • 3 times, dc in last 3 sts.
In this case, you would work the stitches between the bullets 3 times, then work the
stitches immediately following the phrase, then work the stitches between the bullets
another 3 times, then finish out the rest of the instructions.
Bullets are nice because they can be referred to more than once within a row without
having to rewrite the stitches. You won’t find, however, a phrase between bullets refer-
enced within another row. Each row or round has its own separate set of instructions.
Double bullets
Once in a while, you’ll come across double bullets (••) enclosing a phrase. These can
be used in one of two ways:
 To note a second section to be repeated in any line of instructions
 To note a group of instructions, including at least one single-bullet repeat, that
will be repeated
In general, double bullets denote a second section of instructions to repeat when
there’s already a single-bulleted section in the same row or round. When a particular
row or round has two sets of instructions that need repeating, you’ll see a set of
stitches enclosed in single bullets first, then a section later on enclosed by a set of
double bullets. For example:
• Dc in each of next 2 sts, ch 2, skip next 2 sts •, rep from • to • twice, •• dc in
each of next 3 sts, ch 2, skip next 2 sts ••, rep from •• to •• twice, dc in each of
last 2 sts.
34
Part I: Reinforcing Your Crochet Foundation 

Simply put, you would work the stitches between the single bullets for a total of 3
times, then work the stitches between the double bullets, which are different than the
phrase between the single bullets, a total of 3 times, then complete the rest of the row.
When a set of instructions enclosed in single bullets is part of a larger repeat, you’ll
find double bullets at either end of the larger repeat. For example:
•• 5 dc in loop, ch 2, skip next 2 dc, • dc in next dc, ch 2, skip next 2 dc •, rep from
• to • 5 times ••, rep from •• to •• 3 times.
In other words, you work the •• to •• phrase a total of 4 times, but within that phrase
is another • to • phrase that you work a total of 6 times within each •• to •• repeat.
Playing with parentheses
Parentheses are another way to denote repeats within an instruction; however, their
role is slightly different than that of bullets. Here’s a list of the parentheses’ purpose:
 To isolate a set of stitches that are worked all in 1 stitch. For example,
(dc, ch 1, dc) in next sc
This means that in the next single crochet stitch, you work 1 double crochet,
chain 1, then another double crochet in the same single crochet.
 To enclose a set of stitches that you repeat a number of times in succession,
in the same way that single or double bullets would be used. For example,
(3 dc in next st, ch 1, skip next st, sc in next st, ch 1, skip next st) 4 times
Simply put, this means that you work 3 double crochet in the next stitch, chain 1,
skip the next stitch, single crochet in the next stitch, chain 1, skip the next stitch,
then repeat the stitches within the parentheses 3 more times for a total of
4 times.
 To sum up a completed row or round. At the end of a row or round, you’ll see a
number enclosed in parentheses that tells you how many stitches you should
have (25 dc). Or, it could say (15 shells) or (6 ch-5 loops). These numbers help
keep you on track so you know if you’ve made the correct number of stitches
called for in the instructions.
 To distinguish different sizes in garment patterns. Most garment patterns are
written in a variety of sizes to accommodate all of our different sizes. In order to
distinguish the number of stitches needed for the different sizes, you’ll see some-
thing like this:
Sc in each of next 24 (26, 28, 30) sts
Now, the pattern will tell you at the beginning which sizes are which, but for the
sake of this example, if you were making a size Small you’d work 24 single cro-
chet stitches, a size Medium you’d work 26 single crochet stitches, a Large 28
single crochet stitches, and an X-Large 30 single crochet stitches.
To avoid confusion as you work, it’s helpful to highlight, circle, or underline the
numbers that pertain to your size throughout the pattern.
35
Chapter 3: Sum and Substance: Reading a Pattern

Embracing brackets
Brackets are used in similar fashion to parentheses, usually in conjunction with them.
Sometimes they are used interchangeably, but other times they are used like this:
 As a set or phrase within another phrase. For example:
(2 dc in center ring, [ch 3, sl st in 3rd ch from hook]) 3 times, 2 dc in center
ring, sl st in first dc to join.
In plain English, this means you would work 2 double crochet stitches in the
center ring, chain 3, then slip stitch in the 3rd chain from your hook, a total of
3 times, then work another 2 double crochet in the center ring before working
a slip stitch to the beginning double crochet to join the stitches into a round.
 To sum up the number of stitches at the end of a row for different sizes.
For example:
(85 [90, 95] sts)
For a size Small you’d have 85 stitches at the end of the row, 90 stitches for size
Medium, and 95 stitches for size Large.
Rows and rounds repeated
The other type of repeat that you’re likely to come across is one that instructs you to
repeat several identical rows or rounds in succession. You may see something like this:
Rows 2–10: Ch 1, sc in each sc across, turn.
This means that you chain 1, single crochet in each single crochet across, then turn at
the end of the row consecutively for 9 rows.
Sometimes the pattern will instruct you to repeat a number of rows, like this:
Row 2: Ch 1, sc in each st across, turn.
Row 3: Ch 2, hdc in each sc across, turn.
Row 4: Ch 3, dc in each hdc across, turn.
Rows 5–13: Rep Rows 2–4 (3 times).
For this type of repeat, you work Row 2 through Row 4 as written, then go back and
repeat them consecutively 3 more times for a total of 9 more rows.
Decoding the Diagram
Stitch diagrams are a wonderful tool to use in addition to written instructions. They
portray a picture of the design, which is especially helpful with more intricate patterns.
They lay out each individual stitch in relation to the others so you can see what the
design is supposed to look like when you’re finished. Additionally, if you happen to see
a pattern in a foreign publication that has a stitch diagram, you can still make the item
without hiring a translator.
The stitch symbols that are used to make up these stitch diagrams are called
International Crochet Symbols. These symbols aren’t quite standardized yet, and you’ll
most likely find slight variations from publication to publication, but they’ll be close
enough that you’ll recognize them. Figure 3-1, as well as the removable Cheat Sheet at
the front of the book, includes a list of the symbols for the most common crochet
stitches and stitch combinations. Keep this list handy as you crochet.

Part I: Reinforcing Your Crochet Foundation 

Keep these basics in mind when crocheting from a stitch diagram:
 Each row or round is numbered so you know where to begin.
• When working in rows, the right-side row number appears on the right-
hand side of the diagram, which means you work from right to left. The
wrong-side number is placed on the left-hand side of the diagram, and you
work following the diagram from left to right.
• When working in rounds, the number that appears in the center of the
center ring indicates the number of chain stitches used to form the ring.
Each subsequent round is then numbered at the beginning of each round.
 Because of the repetitive nature of crochet instructions and the space limitation
of most publications, a stitch diagram may show only a repeated set of stitches a
few times, but that will be all you need to crochet the entire piece.
 When working in rounds, work counterclockwise without turning between
rounds unless the written instructions specifically tell you to.
 Crochet is three-dimensional, while stitch diagrams are not. You may see some dis-
tortion of the stitches in the diagram that won’t be there in the actual crocheted
piece. Always check out the written instructions before working exclusively from a
diagram.

Figure 3-2 is an actual stitch diagram for a pillowcase edging that appears in Chapter 14.
Because the stitch pattern is repetitive, only a small portion of the pattern is repre-
sented. This is commonly called a reduced sample of the pattern. It includes at least
one repeat, plus any edge stitches so you can see how they join together. When work-
ing your actual piece, you start out with the specified number of chain stitches for
your foundation chain, then repeat the pattern across. Notice how the right-side row is
numbered on the right-hand side of the diagram and the wrong-side row is numbered
on the left-hand side.

T
his chapter is all about action — the stitches and stitch combinations, how to add a new
ball of yarn, changing colors, increasing and decreasing your stitches, and working in
circles. You need to know how to do all of these things because they’re what make crochet
interesting.
In this chapter, you find descriptions of stitches and their relationship to each other. I give
you a detailed explanation about how to add a new ball of yarn, whether it’s the same color
or a new one, and how to do it without color drag. When you want to shape your work, you
need to know all about increasing and decreasing your stitches, whether you’re working in
rows or rounds, and that how-to is here, too. So skim through these pages and refresh your
memory. Then you can jump into your first pattern.
Keeping You in Stitches
As I’m sure you know, crocheting is nothing more than a series of loops made with a hook
and yarn. You can work those loops back and forth, back and forth across the rows, or
around and around in circles. Appendix A goes into great detail on how to create each of
these stitches, but the following sections should give you a memory boost about the relation-
ship between the stitches and how they can be combined to create new stitches.
Refreshing the fundamentals
Even the most complex crochet stitch patterns do nothing more than build upon these basic
stitches. When you’re comfortable with these stitches, you’ll run into few unfamiliar tech-
niques down the road.
 Slip stitch: This is the flattest of all stitches and is quite utilitarian. Besides being used
as a regular stitch, the slip stitch is also used to join rounds, travel (when you need to
get from point A to point B without fastening off your yarn), sew seams, and create
combination stitches.
 Single crochet stitch: This is probably the most commonly used stitch and is the basis
for all other crochet stitches. The single crochet stitch is short and compact and works
just as well with a smooth yarn as with the new, textured fashion yarns.

 Half double crochet stitch: This stitch is a little bit fatter and a little bit taller
than a single crochet stitch. It creates a nice, dense fabric without being too stiff.
When working a half double crochet stitch, you start out like a double crochet
stitch and end like a single crochet stitch.
 Double crochet stitch: This is another really popular stitch and is used quite
often alone and in combinations to create other patterned and textured stitches.
The double crochet stitch is slightly taller than the half double crochet stitch
and creates a fairly loose fabric.
 Triple crochet stitch: This one builds on the double crochet stitch, and again, is
just a bit taller. When worked in rows, the triple crochet stitch creates a loose,
airy fabric and is often used in combination with other stitches to crochet lace-
like patterns.
 Double triple crochet stitch: This is most likely the tallest stitch you’ll see on a
fairly regular basis. It is taller than the triple crochet and is most used in thread-
work to create lace patterns.
All of the stitches listed above are about the same width, with the exception of the half
double crochet, which has the distinction of being fat. The big difference between the
rest of them is the height. You need to know how tall a stitch is so you know how long
to make your turning chain. When you get to the end of a row or round, you have to
bring your work to the next level, and this means working a turning chain. Figure 4-1
shows you how many chains to make as well as the height relationship between each
stitch. Table 4-1 tells you how many chains are needed for these frequently used
stitches.

Part I: Reinforcing Your Crochet Foundation 

When you start the next row or round, you have to bring your work up to the correct
height of the stitch you’ll be working next. Many patterns will tell you how many chains
to make for the turning chain, but some don’t. If the row starts out with a double cro-
chet (dc), be sure to chain 3 instead of working an actual double crochet stitch.
In addition to bringing the hook to the proper height before working the next row or
round, sometimes the turning chain counts for an actual stitch. In patterns, you may
see this written as, “Ch 3 (counts as 1 dc), dc in next and foll 3 sts . . .” If a turning
chain stands in for a “normal” stitch, you can expect to work the final stitch of the next
row into that turning chain. When working in single crochet, the chain 1 is never used
in place of a stitch; it simply isn’t big enough to work into later on. Throughout this
book, every turning chain larger than a chain 1 counts as a stitch.
Constructing combinations
One of the things that I absolutely love about crochet is that you can take the simplest
stitches and create wonderful patterns and textures without having to learn new tech-
niques. Pattern and texture stitches come in all shapes and sizes. The toughest part
about stitch combinations is deciding where to place your hook and how to many yarn
overs you need.
If a pattern includes a special stitch, it’ll give you the instructions on how to make that
stitch at the beginning of the pattern. However, you’ll see certain stitches on a fairly
regular basis. The list below names a few, and Appendix A gives you step-by-step
instructions for each of them. Although this list is by no means all-inclusive, these
stitches give you a good base for creating pattern and texture.
 Shell stitch: This is typically made by crocheting anywhere from three to five
double crochet stitches all in the same stitch. The resulting pattern looks like a
seashell.
 V-stitch: Like the name suggests, this stitch looks like a V. It’s usually made by
crocheting a double crochet stitch, chain 1, double crochet stitch all in the same
stitch.
 Crossed double crochet stitch: This one looks like an X when it’s complete. The
double crochet stitches are worked on an angle, where you skip a stitch for the
first double crochet, then work backward into the skipped stitch for the second
double crochet.
 Picot: These are most often used on edgings. They are pretty little round-shaped
stitches that add a decorative touch or fill an empty space. Picot stitches are
almost always made by crocheting three chain stitches and then a slip stitch into
the third chain from the hook.
 Cluster: The opposite of the shell stitch, the cluster looks like a triangle. It’s
formed by working a number of stitches across an equal number of stitches and
joining them together across the top. It’s similar to a decrease. Any of the basic
stitches can be used to make a cluster, although it’s most common to use half
double crochet, double crochet, and triple crochet.
 Reverse single crochet: Just as the name suggests, this is a single crochet stitch,
but instead of working it from right to left, you work it from left to right creating
a decorative twisted rounded edge.
 Puff stitch: As the name suggests, this stitch puffs up into a gently formed oval.
It’s created by crocheting several half-closed stitches all in the same stitch, then
joining them together at the top. Although you can use most of the basic stitches
to make a puff stitch, you get the best results from the taller stitches, such as
double crochet and triple crochet.
41
Chapter 4: Brushing Up on Stitch Basics

 Bobble: The bobble creates a similar look to the puff stitch, but instead of work-
ing actual stitches, you use a series of loops to make it stand out.
 Popcorn stitch: This one really pops! It’s a nicely rounded oval that stands out
from the fabric, and you can make it “pop” to the front or the back of the fabric.
It takes a bit more time but is well worth the effort. As with puff stitches and
clusters, the taller stitches make more of an impact.
In most patterns, you won’t use these stitches across every stitch and every row.
Textured stitches, such as the bobble and the popcorn stitch, need a plain background
for contrast. In other cases, because the stitch either increases or decreases the total
number of stitches, you’ll need to make up that difference elsewhere in the row to keep
your rows even. For example, with a shell stitch, you work multiple stitches in the same
stitch. To maintain your rows, you’ll need to skip a few stitches before working the next
shell stitch. With a cluster, the exact opposite is true. In fact, it’s not uncommon to see
stitch patterns made from equal numbers of shell stitches and clusters.
Change Is Good: Adding New Yarn
At one point or another, you’re going to have to add another skein of yarn. You will
simply run out of the one you’re working with, or you will need to change colors. Don’t
be tempted to tie a little knot between the two skeins and continue to crochet it into
the fabric. It may look secure, but the knot will find its way to the front of your lovely
project, and it may even unravel. Take some time to use the proper technique.
Making the switch at the beginning 
or end: It’s all the same
Many patterns call for you to change colors at the beginning of a row. In other cases,
you may get to the end of a row and realize you don’t have enough yarn left in the
skein to get a good start on the next row, so you decide to go ahead and start a new
skein. The beginning of one row or round is the end of the previous one, so we’re
pretty much talking about the same spot here. The following steps walk you through
the correct way to join a new color at the beginning of a row of double crochet.
1. Work the last double crochet stitch of the row to the point where there are 2
loops left on the hook.
2. Drop the first yarn color and pick up the second yarn color.
3. Wrap the end of the second yarn color around the hook as you would during
any double crochet stitch. Be sure to leave at least a 6-inch tail from the new
yarn.
4. Draw the second yarn color through the 2 loops of the first yarn color that are
on your hook (see Figure 4-2).
If you plan to pick up the first color in a later row, leave the yarn hanging and
continue with the second color.
5. Tug on the end of the first color to tighten up the stitch.
6. Continue crocheting across the row or round with the second color.
42
Part I: Reinforcing Your Crochet Foundation 

When you join a new color or skein of yarn and need to hide the end of the old color or
skein, lay the loose end across the tops of the stitches in the previous row and work
over it. This will save you time because you won’t have to weave in the ends when
you’re finished.
Midstream changes
At one time or another, you’ll invariably run out of yarn in the middle of a row or round
and have to add a new ball of yarn. Or maybe you’re working a charted pattern that
requires color changes in different places across the row. Either way, you need to be
able to effect this change without making it seem obvious.
If you’re just adding a new ball of the same color, you want to hide the ends and create
a smooth transition without any lumps or bumps. If you’re changing colors altogether,
the most important thing is to prevent color drag. This is when the first color sort of
bleeds into the second color, and you have a two-toned stitch. By changing yarns cor-
rectly, you can avoid this, and your pattern will move along smoothly.
The concept of changing colors midstream is basically the same as when you change
colors at the beginning of a row (see the previous section). To add a new color in the
middle of a row working in double crochet stitches, follow these steps:
1. Work the last stitch prior to the stitch where you’re going to make the color
change up to the point where there are only 2 loops left on the hook.
2. Drop the first color yarn to the wrong side of your work and pick up the
second color.
3. Wrap the end of the second color around the hook, getting set to complete the
stitch.
4. Draw the second yarn color through the 2 remaining loops of the first color on
your hook, completing the stitch with the second color (see Figure 4-3a).
5. Continue to work with the new color (see Figure 4-3b).
If you’re not going to need the first color yarn again, or at least not for a few more
rows, cut the yarn, leaving a tail several inches long. Draw the tail end through the cur-
rent stitch and work over the tail to hide it. You can also weave it in later with a yarn
needle if that’s your preference.

Hold on tight! Carrying your yarn
If you’ve done any crocheting at all, you know that one of the most tedious aspects of
crochet is weaving in a million little ends of yarn when you finally complete your
design. One technique crocheters use quite often when working with two or more
colors is to carry the yarn as they go. You can accomplish this through several differ-
ent methods, each appropriate for particular projects:
 Carry the yarn across the wrong side of your work: This is probably the easi-
est method when working with several colors, and it’s ideal for items that have a
hidden “wrong side,” such as a sweater, hat, or bag. To do this, simply work over
the strand every few stitches, making sure that the carried strand appears on the
wrong side of your work (see Figure 4-4).
If you’re working a vertical stripe pattern and will be switching back and forth
between colors frequently, carry the strand all the way across the row. However,
if you’re working a charted pattern and the picture is in the middle of the design,
when you’re done using the color in that row, drop the color to the wrong side
and pick it back up on the return trip. That way you don’t have to lug it with you
all the way across.
 Carry the yarn across the right side of your work: There’s really no reason to
do this unless the design specifically calls for it. For instance, if the project
includes adding a strand of tiny mirrors or sparkling sequins to your work, you
would carry the strand across the right side because these are almost impossi-
ble to crochet with. You’d carry the yarn the same way as you would on the
wrong side, but with the carried strand visible on the right side of the work.

 Working over the strand: This hides the carried strand of yarn completely and
is ideal for reversible items, such as shawls, scarves, and throws. Working over
the yarn is similar to hiding the tail end of your yarn when you fasten off. Lay the
unused strand of yarn across the tops of the stitches in the previous row and
work your stitches over it, encasing it completely (see Figure 4-5). When you’re
ready to use it again, simply bring it out of hiding.
 Carrying the yarn up the side of your work: This works great if you’re crochet-
ing a horizontal stripe pattern that changes colors on even-numbered rows (if it
changes on odd numbers, the color you need will be on the wrong end of the
row). For projects with seams up both sides, any visible strands of yarn will be
hidden in the seams. This is also a great technique when working with scarves or
blankets that will have an edging crocheted later, because the edging will hide
any stranding.
To carry the yarn up the side, follow these steps:
1. Work two rows in the first color of your choice, switching to the second
color in the last stitch of the second row.
2. Work two rows using the second color.
3. Draw up the first color from two rows below, completing the last stitch of
the second row with the first color. Drop the second color to be picked
up again two rows later (see Figure 4-6).

Chapter 4: Brushing Up on Stitch Basics

Don’t pull the side strand too tightly, or you’ll pull the rest of the work with it, and the
side will pucker.
Weave it to the end
At the very end of your project, you can handle any ends of yarn by sewing them into
the fabric securely. This is called weaving. You typically weave in ends after any seams
or edgings are completed but before you block the piece. Here’s how to weave an end:
1. Thread your yarn needle with an end.
2. Use your needle to weave the yarn through the center of the stitches for at
least 2 inches in one direction.
3. Double back and sew at least 2 inches in the opposite direction.
4. Snip the tail of the end close to the last woven part, so it’s hidden by the 
crochet.
When weaving ends, really consider the best place to hide those ends. If you’re work-
ing a lacey and open design, it’s easiest to try to sew all the ends close to the edge of
the work. Any additional bulk will become part of the edge and not disrupt the pattern.
For solid patterns, it’s sometimes easiest to sew the ends underneath the stitches on
the row above, similar to if you carried the yarn along the tops of those stitches.
There aren’t any hard and fast rules on the best places to weave ends. Use your judg-
ment, check both sides of the fabric to ensure ends aren’t showing, and weave in
longer lengths than you feel you need to. Worse case scenario: If the ends become
unwoven someday, you’ll have enough yarn to sew them in again.
I really urge you to work over yarn ends as you crochet (see the “Making the switch at
the beginning or end: It’s all the same” section). Doing so allows you to avoid spending
a lot of time weaving in yarn.
The Ins and Outs of Increasing 
and Decreasing Stitches
Crochet just wouldn’t be the same if you couldn’t add some shape to it, and to do this,
you simply add or subtract stitches across the row or around the round. Increasing or
decreasing stitches is easy, and there are a few different methods of each. Read on for
the specific how-to’s.
When increasing or decreasing your stitches, always count how many stitches you
have when you’re done. The pattern will specify how many you should have at the end
of the row.
Expanding rows by adding stitches
Increasing (adding more stitches to a row than the previous row had) can be done any-
where across the row or in the round. Depending on the shape you’re trying to achieve,
you can increase at the beginning and end of a row, in the middle, in every stitch across
the row or round, or in even increments. But, regardless of where the increase takes
place, it’s always accomplished by working two or more stitches into a single stitch.
46
Part I: Reinforcing Your Crochet Foundation 

The following steps walk you through a double crochet increase at the beginning of 
a row:
1. Chain 3 (turning chain and first dc) (see Figure 4-7a).
2. Work your next stitch into the first stitch of the row immediately below the
turning chain (see Figure 4-7b).
Typically, because the turning chain counts as the first double crochet, you
would skip this stitch and work into the next stitch.
3. Crochet across the rest of the row as you normally would, working one stitch
into each stitch across.
To increase any stitch at the beginning of a row, you follow the same steps, adjusting
the turning chain accordingly. For a single crochet increase, you would chain 1, then
work two complete single crochet stitches into the first stitch. For a triple crochet, you
would chain 4, then work a triple crochet stitch into the first stitch of the row.
To increase a stitch at the end of the row, simply work two of the same stitches into
the last stitch; to increase somewhere in the middle of a row, simply work two of the
same stitches in the designated stitch of the row. Increasing in a round is a little differ-
ent. I cover that technique in the “You’ll Come Around: Crocheting in Circles” section
later in this chapter.
Shortening your rows with dwindling numbers
Just as you can add stitches to a row or round, you can subtract, or decrease, the
number of stitches. Decreasing stitches can take place anywhere an increase can: at
the beginning and end of a row, or somewhere in the middle.
Decreasing stitches involves a few more steps than increasing, but it’s still easy. You
can do your decrease in one of two ways:
 Turning two stitches into one
 Eliminating stitches altogether

chet stitch

Chapter 4: Brushing Up on Stitch Basics

When two become one
When you decrease a stitch, you work 1 stitch over 2 stitches in the previous row. It’s a
two-step process in which you do only half the stitch before starting a new stitch in
the next stitch, and completing the decrease there. So you need to be ready to make a
decrease before the last stitch of the row. The following steps show you how to turn
two double crochet stitches into one:
1. Yarn over (yo), and insert your hook into the next stitch.
2. Yarn over, and draw the yarn through the stitch.
3. Yarn over, and draw the yarn through the first 2 loops on the hook (see 
Figure 4-8).
To begin the second half of the decrease, with the 2 loops still on your hook:
4. Yarn over, and insert your hook into the next stitch (see Figure 4-9).
5. Yarn over, and draw the yarn through the stitch.
6. Yarn over, and draw the yarn through the first 2 loops on the hook (3 loops
remain).
7. Yarn over, and draw the yarn through all 3 loops on the hook (see Figure 4-10a).
One double crochet decrease is now complete (see Figure 4-10b).
To decrease a stitch at the beginning of a row where a turning chain is involved, make
the turning chain 1 stitch shorter than is normally called for. For example, a triple cro-
chet stitch has a turning chain of 4 stitches; when you want to decrease it, chain 3 and
then continue across the row as normal. When you return in the next row, don’t work a
stitch into the shortened chain.

48
Part I: Reinforcing Your Crochet Foundation 

Decreasing other stitches is pretty much the same process. You work through the
stitches to the last step, and then join them together by drawing your last yarn over
through the remaining loops on your hook. Most patterns give you detailed steps on
how the decreases should be made, so you won’t feel like you’re left in a lurch.
Skipping stitches
The second and easiest way to decrease your stitches is, simply, not to make them. At
the beginning of a row, you slip stitch across the specified number of stitches to the
starting point, make your turning chain, and then proceed across the row. When
you’ve worked the indicated number of stitches, you just stop crocheting and leave
the specified number of stitches unworked. You then turn your work around and go
back the way you came.
You’ll Come Around: Crocheting in Circles
Round designs are just as much a part of crochet as squares or rectangles. You work
the stitches the same as if you were working in rows; how you begin the pattern dic-
tates what shape it will become. Working in rounds, as it’s called, has you going in cir-
cles instead of back and forth. The number of stitches increases with each round,
usually in standard increments to ensure an even shape. You keep increasing the
number of stitches in rounds until you reach the desired circumference. At this point,
you may be done, as in the case of a doily or motif. But in some cases, you’ll start
working the same number of stitches in each round, as you would when crocheting a
hat, or you’ll decrease your stitches to create a ball shape.
Crafting the center ring
To work in rounds, you must have a center ring. You typically make a center ring by
crocheting several chain stitches and then joining them together with a slip stitch to
form a circle. Sometimes you’ll start crocheting in the round by working into a single
chain stitch, but you won’t see that as often.
To create a center ring, follow these steps:
1. Chain 6.
2. Insert your hook into the first chain stitch made, forming a ring (see 
Figure 4-11a).
a.
b.
Figure 4-10:

a double

49
Chapter 4: Brushing Up on Stitch Basics

3. Yarn over (yo).
4. Draw the yarn through the stitch and through the loop on your hook, as
shown in Figure 4-11b. This makes a slip stitch to the beginning of the chain.
The number of chain stitches that make up the center ring determines how big the
hole will be and how many stitches you can fit into it. The pattern you’re working will
tell you how many chain stitches to make when creating the center ring.
Making the first round
After the center ring is complete, you can start working stitches into it. This is the first
round. As with rows, you have to make a turning chain to bring your work up to the
height of the stitches you’ll be crocheting. The great thing about working into a center
ring is this — you don’t have to actually work into the chain stitches, just slip your
hook through the hole in the center.
The following steps show you how to work your first round of single crochet stitches:
1. Chain 1 (turning chain for single crochet), and insert your hook into the
center ring (see Figure 4-12a).
2. Yarn over (yo), and draw the yarn through the center ring.
3. Yarn over, and draw the yarn through the 2 loops on your hook (see 
Figure 4-12b).
Continue working single crochet stitches into the center ring until you can’t fit any
more. You’ll be surprised at how many you can squeeze in there. When working a pat-
tern, though, it will specify how many stitches to make.

Part I: Reinforcing Your Crochet Foundation 

Joining ends
When you’ve crocheted the specified number of stitches into the center ring, it’s time
to move up and on, but you have to somehow bring the stitches together. To do this,
you once again bring into play that invaluable little stitch, the slip stitch. Insert your
hook into the top of the first stitch you made in the round and work a slip stitch (see
Figure 4-13). This joins the round, and you’re ready to move on to the next one.
Branching out
After joining the round, you need to chain the required number of turning chains for
the next stitch, and then proceed with the instructions provided. To make sure the
piece gets larger while staying flat, increases are typically worked in a regular
sequence, based more or less on the number of stitches in the first round. Table 4-2
shows this increase pattern. For example, if you start with 8 stitches, each subsequent
round needs to increase by 8 stitches so it stays flat and doesn’t ruffle at the edges.
However, be sure to read the instructions: Don’t assume you’ll always increase based
on the number of stitches in the first round.

Most times you won’t turn your piece after completing each round as you do with
rows. Not turning your work gives it a definite front and back. If you want a piece that’s
reversible, turn your work after each round. The instructions in the pattern you’re
working will tell you how and where to do this.

Chapter 4: Brushing Up on Stitch Basics

Just keep going: Spirals
Not all rounds are joined when you reach the end, and this method is called working 
in a spiral. You work in a spiral when you don’t want to have a visible seam anywhere,
usually with three-dimensional designs such as hats, bags, and toys. If you’ve mastered
the single crochet stitch and nothing more complicated, you can crochet in a spiral
because spirals typically use only the single crochet stitch. Taller stitches worked in
this fashion tend to look uneven and out of shape.
To work a spiral, instead of joining the round when you get to the end, you simply
work into the next stitch, which is the first stitch of the last round. Because the last
stitch of the last round worked in a spiral will be raised, you have to join it to the previ-
ous round to smooth out the edge. Slip stitch into the first stitch of the previous round
and fasten off.
Use a stitch marker and always mark the first stitch of each round. You’d be amazed at
how easy it is to lose track of where you are and how many stitches you’ve worked. It’s
always a shame to have to tear out your work.
Creating shapes
To make a round shape get bigger, you keep adding stitches. To shape it, you can
either stop increasing and/or decrease your stitches. Many items such as hats, bags,
socks, and mittens, start out by crocheting rounds. You shape them by changing the
number of stitches.
To make a hat, you start out by increasing rounds until you reach the desired circum-
ference, then you stop adding stitches and work even on the number of stitches that
you already have. This causes the flat round piece that you have to curve upward, and
there you have it — a new shape.
If you need to decrease your stitches, you work them the same way as you do when
working in rows (see the “Shortening your rows with dwindling numbers” section ear-
lier in this chapter). The instructions in the pattern will tell you where to make the
decreases. They’re typically made in a regular sequence the same as increases are.

You’ll find one chapter that focuses on the basic stitches
with little or no shaping or color changes. Another pro-
vides designs that all involve some sort of shaping,
whether it’s increasing, decreasing, or a combination of
both. Try the projects in the chapter that has you going in

eady, set, go! The projects I provide in this chapter are all designed to get your fingers
moving. There’s nothing quite like the satisfaction you feel when you complete a proj-
ect, and you can crochet all these projects relatively quickly.
The first three designs are made using mainly two stitches — the chain stitch and the single
crochet — with the occasional slip stitch thrown in, but as you’ll see, the results are very 
different. The last pattern uses most of the basic stitches — the chain stitch, single crochet,
half double crochet, double crochet, and triple crochet — combined to create a simple,
attractive pattern.
Whether you decide to make just one of these projects or you want to tackle all of them,
you’ll find that even with the most basic of stitches you can create fabulous designs.
Practical Potholders
You can never have too many potholders. Worked in 100% cotton, they’re easy to care for
(just throw them in the washer and dryer), and the generous size and tight single crochet
stitch pattern (see Figure 5-1) provides protection for your hands.
The “Materials and vital statistics” section provides yarn information for three different col-
ored potholders, but feel free to make just one or as many as you need. Potholders also make
wonderful housewarming or hostess gifts, and the yarn is available in dozens of colors to
match any décor.

Directions
Foundation chain: Ch 26.
Row 1 (right side): Sc in 2nd ch from hook, sc in each ch across (25 sc), turn.
Rows 2–29: Ch 1, sc in each sc across (25 sc), turn.
Row 30: Ch 1, sc in each sc across (25 sc), do not turn.
Edging: Working across side edge of potholder, work 1 sc in each row-end st across to
next corner, work 3 sc in corner st, sc in each ch across opposite side of foundation
chain to next corner, work 3 sc in corner st, working across next side edge, work 1 sc
in each row-end st across to next corner.
Finishing: To make the hanging loop, ch 10, sl st in next sc to join, forming a loop.
Fasten off.
Variation: Doubling the thickness
If you’d like to make a heavier-weight potholder, make two potholders, omitting the
edging. When both are complete, put the wrong sides together, matching stitches, and
crochet the edging through the double thickness of both potholders.
Variation: Pumping up the size
To make a larger potholder, increase the number of chain stitches in the foundation
row until it reaches the desired width. Then increase the numbers of rows worked
accordingly so the potholder forms a square.
Handy Headbands
Whether you’re young, old, or somewhere in between, and whether you wear your hair
long or short, invariably you find yourself rooting through the drawers for a headband
at one time or another. These days, they’re a popular fashion accessory, but they’re
also great for keeping your hair out of your face when you’re working out or cleaning
the house. Crocheted using single crochet stitches, the resulting fabric is slightly
stretchy, which allows for a little “head room” (see Figure 5-2).
The yarn information provided in the “Materials and vital statistics” section showcases
three different types of yarn — “Trellis,” “Incredible,” and “Microspun” — with one ball
or skein having enough yarn to make several headbands. After your family and friends
see them, you’re sure to get requests for more.

The yarns “Trellis” and “Incredible” are part of the hot new family of fashion yarns.
When crocheting with them, you may have difficulty at first because of the texture, but
don’t give up. Take your time, and you’ll soon get used to their look and feel. If you’re a
little uncomfortable with the textured yarns, start out with the “Microspun” and then
pick up the others and give it a whirl.
Foundation chain: Ch 9.
Row 1 (right side): Sc in 2nd ch from hook, sc in each ch across (8 sc), turn.
Row 2: Ch 1, sc in each sc across (8 sc), turn.
Repeat Row 2 until headband measures 18 in. or fits the circumference of your head
(or the recipient’s head if you’re giving it to someone else). Fasten off, leaving a sewing
length of about 10 in.
Finishing: With the right sides of the headband facing, line up the stitches across from
each other, and using the whipstitch (see Appendix A for directions on this stitch),
sew the last row to the foundation chain by using the tapestry needle and sewing
length.
A Smart Scarf
This scarf really pops — and no one will believe how simple it is to make! Crocheted
with loosely worked single crochet stitches (see Figure 5-3), the pattern is revealed as
the yarn rolls out. With the onslaught of new yarns available, creating spectacular-
looking designs without having to be an expert is easier than ever, as this project
shows. Grab your hook and yarn, and jump right in!

 Stitches used: Chain stitch (ch), single crochet (sc)
This pattern only requires you to work two different stitches: the chain stitch for the
foundation chain, then the single crochet stitch for the body of the scarf. You’ll work
the single crochet stitches back and forth until you reach the desired length, and at
certain points, you’ll run out of yarn and have to join a new skein. If you need a
memory boost on how to do this correctly, please see Chapter 4.

This yarn is an unconventional fashion yarn, but it really creates a fabulous fabric.
Make sure to keep your stitches loose, and the bumps and lumps will pull right
through.

Wooly Warmer Afghan
You can use this afghan on those really cold nights when you want to curl up with a
soft, warm blanket and forget about the outside temperature (see Figure 5-4). The pat-
tern uses most of the basic stitches and is worked vertically, or lengthwise, rather than
in the traditional side-to-side manner. The yarn is a super-bulky-weight wool blend,
which allows you to work it up faster than you could using a worsted-weight yarn (see
Chapter 1 for more on yarns). Throw this afghan over the back of the sofa, or fold it at
the foot of your bed, ready to provide an extra layer of warmth.

Because this afghan is worked in long rows, it’s a great project to work on when you
can sit yourself down in a comfortable chair or on the sofa. After you get a few rows
finished, you’ll find that the afghan gets somewhat awkward to shift around, and the
arms of the chair or seat cushions of the sofa make a great support tool. You’ll also
need to add new skeins of yarn regularly, so please refer to Chapter 4 for detailed
instructions.

Rows 6–57: Rep Rows 2–5 (13 times).
Rows 58–59: Rep Rows 2–3. Fasten off.
Variation: Supersize it!
To make the afghan bigger, add stitches to your foundation chain until you reach the
desired length. Just make sure you end with an odd number of stitches so the pattern
in Row 2 works. Adjust the width by repeating Rows 2–5 as many times as you want,
and be sure to buy extra skeins of yarn.
Variation: Trying a different yarn
This company also makes a super-bulky-weight chenille yarn that would work well
with this pattern. You can use the same size hook suggested in the original pattern.

I
f you try to imagine a world without shapes, it seems very boring, indeed. No shaping?
No fun! Shaping is involved in most crochet designs, and this chapter gives you the
opportunity to create some wonderful projects while getting used to both increasing and
decreasing stitches.
Adding stitches to your work, or increasing (inc) as it’s called, is really a simple process. You
just work more than one stitch in a given stitch. The pattern you’re crocheting will give you
specific details on how and where to place these stitches. On the opposite end of the spec-
trum is to subtract stitches, or decrease (dec) them. This process is slightly more involved
than increasing, but don’t let that frighten you off. Again, the pattern will give you specific
details on how to get rid of those unwanted stitches. For detailed info on both of these skills,
refer to Chapter 4.
This chapter’s projects range from using basic crochet stitches to working with a simple pat-
tern. You can practice not only working the stitches, but reading the patterns themselves,
which get more involved as the projects do. Look through the following patterns, grab your
hook and yarn, and create your favorite design. (Flip to Chapter 3 if you want a refresher on
how to read a pattern.)
Beaded-Fringe Belt
Belts are all the rage, and this one is no exception. From the easy-to-create design to the
color pink, this is one that you’ll reach for often (see Figure 6-1). A few rows of increasing, a
whole bunch of rows worked even, a few rows of decreasing, add some fringe and beads,
then you’re done! You’ll have a new fashion accessory that you’ll love to wear. (If you find it
missing, check with the younger set in your household!)

This design starts out with just a single stitch on the first end and increases stitches
until you have all the stitches you need for the width of the belt. The chain-1 turning
chain creates a pretty scalloped effect along the edge of the belt, which eliminates the
need for edging. When you get close to the end, you decrease your stitches until, once
again, you’re left with just a single stitch. You finish it off by adding some beaded fringe.

Chapter 6: Expanding and Diminishing Dimensions: Adding Shape

Finishing with fringe
To make the fringe, cut yarn into 22 20-in. lengths. Using 1 strand of yarn for each
fringe, starting at the bottom point of one end of the belt, single-knot one fringe in the
bottom point, then in every other row across the side edges of the belt 5 times (the
last fringe will be in the row where stitches are worked evenly and the shaping ends).
The fringe will be uneven — that is, it should be shaped like the point of the belt. If you
prefer to have it straight across, simply trim the ends even before threading the beads.
(See Appendix A for more on fringe.)
To attach the beads, thread one silver bead, one pink bead, then another silver bead
onto each fringe, leaving enough length free to tie the yarn in a knot. Tie the end in an
overhand knot to secure. The beads will then hang at the end of each fringe. Trim ends
even.
Variation: Adding some color or a jingle
For a change of pace, use a complementary shade of yarn for the fringe, or for a more
exotic look, replace the beads on the fringe with tiny bells.
Shades-of-Gray Shawl
This generously sized shawl gives you plenty of opportunity to hone your decreasing
skills while at the same time creating a fabric reminiscent of tweed (see Figure 6-2).
The simple black edging ties it all together, and when finished, you’ve created a versa-
tile piece that you’ll want to keep handy for whenever you’re heading out the door.

 Yarn: Bernat “Soft Bouclé” bulky-weight yarn (98% Gentle Soft acrylic/2% poly-
ester), Article #161026 (5 oz. [140 g], 255 yds [233 m] each skein):
• 3 skeins of #26928 Grey Shades (MC)

crochet (hdc). Dec 1 hdc: • Yo, (insert hook in next st, yo, draw yarn through st)
twice, yo, draw yarn through 4 loops on hook •.
Working a decrease with the half double stitch is almost identical to the single crochet
decrease. In fact, you only do one more step, and that’s the yarn over you do at the
very beginning of the decrease.
This shawl is made from the top edge down. You start off with a long foundation chain,
work a single row of half double crochet stitches to get started, then begin to decrease
the number of stitches in each row until you get to the very end and there’s only one
stitch left.
Directions
Take note that the decreasing is worked in the second and third stitches at the begin-
ning of a row and the second-to-last and third-to-last stitches at the end of the row, not
the first two and last two stitches as you usually see. This method creates a smoother
finish to the edge and doesn’t affect the way the decreasing looks.

Festive Diamond-Shaped Table Runner
This runner will certainly add some pizzazz to your table. The colors are bright, the
cotton yarn is easy to care for, and the shape is unique (see Figure 6-3). In addition to
all this, you get to practice increasing and decreasing while working a simple seed
stitch pattern.
This pattern is comprised of just the chain stitch and the single crochet. Don’t be
intimidated by the thought of working with a pattern — this one is really basic, and it’ll
get you in the groove.
Materials and vital statistics

This pattern is one that you’ll see fairly regularly and is relatively simple as far as
stitch patterns go. After you’ve got your foundation chain going, you work single cro-
chet stitches into the spaces created by the chain stitches, then work chain stitches
over the single crochet stitches to create the spaces for the next row. Be sure to work
a gauge swatch to get the hang of the pattern and your stitch sizes.

a holiday look). Or for some added fun, add a tassel to each end. (See Appendix A for
tassel how-to’s.)

Curlicue Scarf
Scarves are one of the must-have fashion accessories these days, not just something
you wear to keep your neck warm. You can make just about any type of scarf: big, fat,
fluffy scarves; really, really long scarves; skinny, silky scarves; and everything in
between. This pattern falls into the in-between category because it curls around and
around for its entire length (see Figure 6-4). You make the scarf curl just by increasing
stitches at regular intervals along the foundation chain’s length.
Materials and vital statistics
 Yarn: Muench Yarns “Oceana” worsted-weight yarn (55% viscose/30% nylon/15%
cotton), Article #M480 (1.75 oz. [50 g], 77 yds [70 m] each ball): 3 balls of #4808

 Hook: Crochet hook size K-101⁄2 U.S. or size needed to obtain gauge
 Measurements: 3 in. wide x 56 in. long

 Stitches used: Chain stitch (ch), slip stitch (sl st), single crochet (sc), half double
crochet (hdc), double crochet (dc)
This pattern showcases another type of increasing. Because you’re working across
both sides of the foundation chain as opposed to just one side, it becomes a round
instead of a row. By working two stitches into one, you make the piece curl, turning it
into a loose spiral.

any crocheted pieces are worked back and forth in rows, but you can also create
projects by working in the round. Crocheting in the round allows you to add shape to
your designs that working in rows doesn’t. You can use many different techniques, and this
chapter highlights several of them.
In the first design, the denim-look skirt, you start off by joining your foundation chain and
creating a large circle to work from. For the other three, you start with a more traditional
center ring, but where you go from there makes the difference. Each one of the designs fea-
tured in this chapter allows you to get in some practice time with important crochet skills. (If
you need a refresher on how crocheting in the round differs from crocheting in rows, turn 
to Chapter 4. And Chapter 2 contains a reminder of how to measure gauge in the round.)
Flirty Denim Skirt
The denim skirt has been around for years, and with good reason. As with any pair of jeans,
you can dress it up or dress it down and it still looks good. You use a denim-look yarn to
create this skirt, which is designed to sit at the hip, rather than up around your waist. The
drawstring at the waist allows you to adjust the fit, and the ruffles at the bottom give it a fem-
inine edge (see Figure 7-1). Pair the skirt with a T-shirt or throw some leggings on underneath
to get the look that’s so popular today.
This skirt includes a combination of different construction skills for which it falls into the
intermediate skill-level category, but don’t let this intimidate you. The stitches are basic, and
the instructions are easy to navigate. Many patterns are worked in this manner, and it’s a
great stepping stone to prepare you for more-advanced patterns.
The skirt is designed to be short, reaching to about mid-thigh, but if you prefer wearing
something a bit longer, go ahead and keep crocheting until the length reaches one you’re
comfortable with. Remember, though, that if you go longer, you’ll need extra yarn.

Part II: Hook, Yarn, Action! Crocheting Simple Projects 

The method used to start this skirt is somewhat different than you usually see,
although it’s not uncommon. Starting at the waist edge, you crochet a long foundation
chain, and then join the ends with a slip stitch to form a circle. The body of the skirt is
then worked in rounds from the waist down to the lower edge. The key here is not to
twist the chain when joining the ends — it will create a tangled mess.
When you get to the waistband, Row 3 is called a beading round. This doesn’t mean
you add beads — it’s a round worked with spaces between the stitches to allow you to
weave a drawstring through.
Building the skirt body
Foundation chain: Starting at waist edge, with A, ch 90 (102, 114, 126, 138) and without
twisting ch, close into a ring with one sl st in first ch.
Rnd 1: Ch 1, sc in each ch around (90 [102, 114, 126, 138] sc), sl st in first sc to join, turn.

Finishing with the drawstring tie
To make the drawstring tie, use C to make a chain approx 12 in. longer than the fin-
ished hip measurement. Thread two beads onto each end of the chain and tie the ends
into a knot to secure. Starting at the center front of the waistband, weave the draw-
string over then under the stitches in Round 3 (beading round) of the waistband, 
leaving equal lengths on each side. Fold the waistband down toward the right side.
Coffee Suede Beret
Okay, so how many years has this style of hat been around? Too long to remember, I’m
sure. But like most good fashion statements, the beret has made a comeback (see
Figure 7-3). You see them in all colors of the rainbow, from browns and blacks to bold,
bright colors, and even pastels. The yarn used in this project has a remarkable resem-
blance to real suede, although it’s much easier to care for.
This project is suitable for an intermediate-level crocheter because of the shaping
involved and the construction of the brim. By following the instructions step by step,
you’ll see how, by increasing and decreasing your stitches, the form takes shape and
realize that it’s not so difficult after all.

increasing your work, then decreasing back to the desired circumference. The brim, or
visor, is made of two layers of single crochet stitches, which are then crocheted
together along the edges to provide a firm front.

Use your stitch markers when crocheting this design. If you lose count during one of
your rounds, it’s almost impossible to figure out where you started. Pulling out work
and starting over is never fun.

Joining the visor as you craft it
The visor is created by first making the bottom half, then crocheting the top half in
exactly the same manner. The resulting look before you join the edges will be some-
what like a duck bill. The entire bottom edge of the hat is finished by working a round
of stitches beginning at the center back of the hat and working around, joining the two
loose edges of visor as you go.

Red Velvet Crusher Hat
This hat will make you stand out in a crowd! The resulting fabric resembles crushed
red velvet and is just as soft to the touch (see Figure 7-4). With hats featured so promi-
nently these days, this pattern is a must. You use basic stitches and techniques and
get ample opportunity to practice working in the round, but the results will make you
look like an expert. If red isn’t your color, go ahead and choose another color, but by
all means, grab your hook and yarn and work up a fabulous fashion accessory.
Materials and vital statistics
 Size: One size fits most adults
 Yarn: Caron “Jewel Box” medium-weight yarn (64% acrylic/20% rayon/16% poly-
ester), Article #JB1000 (2.5 oz. [70g], 100 yds [91 m] each skein): 2 skeins of
#0020 Ruby
 Hook: Crochet hook size H-8 U.S. or size needed to obtain gauge
 Stitch markers
 Measurement: 22 in. in circumference
 Gauge: First 4 rnds = 2 in. in diameter
 Stitches used: Chain stitch (ch), slip stitch (sl st), single crochet (sc)
When making the transition from the crown of the hat to the sides, then again from the
sides to the brim, you work your stitches into the back loops and front loops of the
stitches, respectively. Remember, the back loops are the ones farthest from you, and
the front loops are the ones closest to you.

Bella Drawstring Bag
Fun and funky is the only way to describe this bag (see Figure 7-5). Most people need
more than one carryall to cart around the various items that we can’t seem to do with-
out these days, and this pattern fits the purpose nicely. The yarn used is one of a hot
new family — self-striping — which allows you to use different colors without having
to actually change them. Beat that!
Materials and vital statistics
 Yarn: Plymouth Yarn “Bella Colour” worsted-weight yarn (55% cotton/45%
acrylic), (1.75 oz. [50 g], 104 yds [95 m] each ball): 5 balls of #19 greens
 Hook: Crochet hook size I-9 U.S. or size needed to obtain gauge
 Stitch markers
 Measurements: 81⁄2 in. in diameter x 10 in. tall
 Gauge: First 4 rnds = 4 in. in diameter
 Stitches used: Chain stitch (ch), slip stitch (sl st), single crochet (sc), double cro-
chet (dc). Shell: • 4 dc in same st •. Picot: • Ch 3, sl st in third ch from hook •.
To make the bag’s base, you use the more common technique of joining rounds when
you get to the end of each one, and you work the sides in a spiral to avoid having an
unseemly seam. Simple shells and picots make up the edging, and the cord is twisted
rather than crocheted to give it a slightly different look.

Finishing with the drawstring cord
To make the drawstring cord, cut yarn into three 4-yard lengths. With the lengths held
together as one, fold the lengths in half. Tie cut ends in an overhand knot to secure.
Holding the knotted end in your hand, place the folded end over a hook such as the
kind used to hold curtain tiebacks (or have a friend hold it for you), and pull taut.
Twist the cord until you can’t twist it any more and it begins to kink.
Carefully, keeping the twisted cord taut, place a finger in the center of the cord and
fold it in half. Remove the folded end from the hook and allow the two ends of the cord
to twist together. Pull gently on each end to even the twist, and tie each end in an over-
hand knot approximately 1 inch from the end to secure. Cut ends to form tassels.
To insert the cord into the bag, weave one end of cord under then over each of the
double crochet stitches in Round 61, leaving equal lengths on both sides.
Variation: Making a sturdier bag
To add support to the bottom of the bag, cut a circle from a piece of thick plastic to fit
inside.
If you’d like to take this bag to the beach, make the bag using a worsted-weight nylon
yarn, which will stand up to the abuse of sun and sand.

C
hanging colors is an integral part of crochet, and being able to change colors properly
is absolutely essential. The technique is not difficult, but if you do it incorrectly, you
can ruin the final look of your design.
Here are a couple things to remember before you get started:
 When joining a new yarn color, always finish the last stitch of the first color with the
second color, regardless of the type of stitch you’re working (see Chapter 4 for detailed
info on changing colors). Doing so gets you ready to start the first stitch of the second
color with the correct color loop on your hook. This also prevents color drag, which 
is what happens when part of a stitch is one color and the rest of a stitch is another
color. Starting the new color in the last stitch of the old color applies to all color
changes, regardless of whether you change yarn at the end of a row or round, or 
midstream.
 Hide the tail end of the yarn color by laying it across the tops of the stitches in the 
previous row and working over it, or weaving it in with a yarn needle when you finish
crocheting.
The patterns in this chapter give you the opportunity to practice changing colors. The color
changes all take place at the beginning (or end) of a row or round, but the concept is the
same no matter where the change takes place.
A Scarf of a Different Color
Crocheting this scarf is really fun, and it’ll certainly brighten up your wardrobe. Not only are
you changing colors with each row, but textures as well (see Figure 8-1). You work the scarf
completely with single crochet stitches, but you’d never know to look at it. Sometimes it’s
okay to mix and match yarns, and this design is a great example.

Materials and vital statistics
 Yarn:
• Bernat “Matrix” railroad yarn (62% nylon/38% polyester), Article #166102
(1.75 oz. [50 g], 140 yds [128 m] each ball): 1 ball of #02430 Web

You’ll have enough yarn to make several scarves.
 Hook: Crochet hook size H-8 U.S. or size needed to obtain gauge
 Measurements: 31⁄4 in. wide x 45 in. long
 Gauge: 8 sts = 2 in.; 6 rows = 1 in.
 Stitches used: Chain stitch (ch), slip stitch (sl st), single crochet (sc)
The beauty of this design reveals itself as you complete each row. You’ll get lots of
practice changing yarn colors, and the great thing is the textures will hide any slip-
ups if you don’t get it quite right the first time. Because the scarf is worked in single
crochet stitches, it’s also a great project to help you get used to working with novelty
yarns.

Denim Cloche
You’ve probably seen these little hats everywhere, and now you can make your own in
no time at all (see Figure 8-2). Denim never goes out of style, and the yarn used here is
probably as close to the real thing as I’ve ever seen. My guess is you’ll have to fight
your teens off to get to wear this hat.

You change colors when working in the round the same way as when you work in
rows: Complete the last stitch of the old color with the new color. You get a seamless
transition with no color drag.

The inherent characteristics of this yarn make it fade and shrink a bit, so be sure to
wash the cloche before you wear it the first time. After a while, it’ll look like your
favorite pair of jeans.
You create the pattern in the hat by varying the stitches in different rounds, from
double crochet stitches to single crochet stitches, and even creating spaces to work in
with a chain stitch thrown in.

Wavy Chevron Throw
Sometimes, there’s nothing like having a soft, warm blanket to throw over your legs or
wrap around your shoulders to keep the chill out (see Figure 8-3). The chevron pattern
(a fancy way to describe the repeated V shape) features shells at the peaks and clus-
ters at the valleys.
This pattern probably falls into the intermediate skill-level category because of the
stitch combination involved in creating the pattern. The pattern is commonly used,
and it’s a great way for you to become familiar with a design that you’ll see repeatedly
throughout your crochet experience.
The yarn used here is a wonderfully soft acrylic, which stands up to daily use and
repeated washings. You should be able to find the yarn in most craft stores, and it
comes in a multitude of colors if you decide on a different color palette.

 Yarn: Lion Brand Yarn “Homespun” bulky-weight yarn, (98% acrylic/
2% polyester), Article #790 (6 oz. [170 g], 185 yds [169 m] each skein):
• 5 skeins of #347 Mediterranean (A)
• 3 skeins of #318 Sierra (B)
• 3 skeins of #326 Ranch (C)
 Hook: Crochet hook size K-101⁄2 U.S. or size needed to obtain gauge
 Measurements: 36 in. wide x 58 in. long, excluding tassels
 Gauge: 11 sts in pat = 4 in.; 6 rows in pat = 4 in.
 Stitches used: Chain stitch (ch), double crochet (dc). Shell: • 3 dc in same stitch •.
Cluster: • 3 dc (half closed and joined tog) worked across 3 consecutive stitches •.
(See Appendix A for detailed instructions on shells and clusters.)
The stitch pattern used to make this throw is a simple chevron pattern, comprised of
shell stitches and clusters. The shells are made with three double crochet stitches
worked into one stitch, and the clusters are three double crochet stitches, half-closed
and joined together, worked across three separate stitches (see Figure 8-4). The shells
form the peaks, while the clusters draw the fabric together to form the valleys of the
pattern.
Directions
Foundation chain: With A, chain 101 + 2 (first dc).
Normally, the first dc in a row is made by working 3 chain stitches, not 2. However, for
the foundation row in this pattern, a chain of only 2 stitches is used. The rest of the
pattern uses a turning ch of 3 for the first dc in a row.
Row 1 (right side): Dc in 3rd ch from hook, • dc in each of next 3 ch, work one cluster
of 3 dc across next 3 ch, dc in each of next 3 ch, shell in next ch •, rep from • to •

Adding tassels: To make a tassel, cut two 8-inch lengths of colors A, B, and C. Holding
all lengths together as one, fold in half. Cut two more 6-inch lengths of color A. Using
one 6-inch length of yarn, tie the bundle securely together through the center fold,
leaving equal lengths on each side. With the bundle folded in half, wrap the second
length of yarn several times around the folded bundle approximately 3⁄4 in. below
folded end. Tie tightly to secure. Make 20 tassels.
To attach the tassels, use the ends of yarn from the first tie at the center top of the
tassel to tie one tassel to each point across each short edge of throw.
Variation: Highlight the stitches, not the colors
This stitch pattern also looks great worked in a solid color. The yarn used comes in a
multitude of shades, so choose your own solid or color combination.
Cozy Chenille Throw Rug
Your feet will absolutely love you every time they encounter this chenille throw rug.
Place it next to your bed or at the foot of your favorite chair and sink your feet into its
cozy warmth. The chenille yarn used is super bulky in weight, making this a quick proj-
ect to work up, and it also gives the rug depth (see Figure 8-5). Use the colors given, or
choose a palate that matches your décor.

The pattern for this rug is primarily made up of half double crochet stitches, with
some simple variations thrown in for interest. Half double crochet stitches are nice
and fat, especially when worked with a bulky yarn. The edging gets a feminine, ruffled
look by working chain stitches between the single crochet stitches.

Variation: Size it to fit just right
If you need a larger or smaller rug to fit your particular space, you can always change
the number of chain stitches in your foundation chain. When working your foundation
chain, make sure you have an odd number of stitches to accommodate the stitch 
pattern.
To figure out how many more (or fewer) stitches you need to adjust the size, use the
gauge given in the beginning of the instructions (6 sts and 6 rows = 4 in.). Decide in
inches what you want the finished dimensions to be, then divide by 4 (gauge) and mul-
tiply by 6 (sts). See Chapter 2 for detailed info on gauge.
Variation: Fringe it!
Omit the edging and add fringe to the short edges of the rug in colors to match the
stripes for a whole new look (see Appendix A for fringe how-to’s).

Mixing It Up: A Few Changes 
Make a Dramatic Difference
In This Chapter
 Crocheting a hip belt
 Increasing in size to create a fashion-forward scarf
 Working in the round to make the ever-popular rolled-brim hat for kids
 Moving up a size to crochet a rolled-brim hat for adults
T
he projects in this chapter illustrate the importance of gauge and of using the proper
materials listed with each pattern. The size of the hook you use dictates the size of the
stitches made, which in turn creates the stitch gauge, or number of stitches and rows per a
given measurement. Using a different weight yarn while keeping the hook size the same also
alters the outcome of your gauge and the appearance of your fabric. For instance, if you use
a lighter-weight yarn than the pattern calls for, but keep your hook size the same, the result-
ing fabric will have looser stitches and a more open look.
For a pattern to work consistently time after time, you have to use the same size materials,
both hook and yarn, each time. By changing the hook size and/or the yarn weight, your proj-
ect can turn out dramatically different (see Chapter 2 for detailed information on gauge and
Chapter 1 for materials).
The following list explains how using different materials affects the gauge:
 Larger hook with the same size yarn: Fewer stitches per given measurement with the
resulting project turning out larger than intended.
 Smaller hook with the same size yarn: More stitches per given measurement with
resulting project turning out smaller than intended.
 Same size hook with heavier-weight yarn: Fewer stitches per given measurement with
the resulting project turning out larger than intended with a tighter fabric.
 Same size hook with a lighter-weight yarn: More stitches per given measurement with
the resulting project turning out smaller than intended with a looser fabric.
 Larger hook with heavier-weight yarn: The finished design will increase in size pro-
portionally from the original size, provided that the hook size is the one recommended
for use with the yarn.
 Smaller hook with lighter-weight yarn: The finished design will decrease in size pro-
portionally from the original size, provided that the hook size is the one recommended
for use with the yarn.
This isn’t to say that you can’t substitute yarn — but if you want your project to turn out the
same as the pattern dimensions, the yarn has to be the same weight as the recommended
yarn in the materials list.

In the first pattern, you create a fanciful belt with a pattern that creates a series of
bows and ruffles running across its length. That belt turns into a feminine scarf in the
second pattern, simply by using a heavier weight of yarn and a larger hook.
In the third pattern, you make a child’s rolled-brim hat using a yarn that has the look of
many seed beads strung together. Using the identical pattern, you can create a softer
(and larger) version for an adult, simply by using different yarn and a larger hook.
Not all patterns can be adapted this way, but the ones in this chapter give you a sense
of how important it is to follow the directions given with an individual pattern, and
how even the smallest change can affect the final outcome.
Beads-’n’-Bows Belt
This design is an ultra-feminine belt with frills, beads, and bows (see Figure 9-1). Don’t
worry about finding beads — this new yarn incorporates the beads right into the
strands, which eliminates the necessity of stringing the beads before getting started.
Because this project introduces a new stitch pattern, it’s suitable for someone with
intermediate-level skills. To help you out, the instructions walk you through each step,
and you’ll find that you can work the new stitches with relative ease and add a new
skill to your repertoire.

 Measurements: 3 in. wide x 28 (32, 36, 40) in. long, excluding ties
 Gauge: 13 sts in pat = 21⁄2 in.; 8 rows in pat = 2 in.
 Stitches used: Chain stitch (ch), single crochet (sc). Long single crochet (lsc): •
Working over 3 ch-8 loops formed in previous 3 rows, work 1 sc, thus gathering
loops together •. (See Appendix A for exact details on how to work this stitch.)
Shell: • 5 sc in same st •.
The bows in this design are crocheted using a series of single crochet stitches and
chain loops, which are then drawn together in the center with a long single crochet
stitch. The edging is comprised of a variation of the shell stitch using single crochet
stitches rather than the more traditional double crochet shell.
And don’t worry about the beads in this yarn getting hung up — they’re small seed
beads and slide right through the loops that create the stitches.
Directions
If none of the sizes listed in the “Materials and vital statistics” section quite fit your
particular shape, work the pattern repeat to 1⁄2 in. less than the desired length, then
work the last two rows.

Ruffles-’n’-Bows Scarf
The basic pattern for this scarf is exactly the same as the one for the beads-’n’-bows
belt, with the exception of the ties (you really don’t need them for a scarf). You work
the stitches the same, but the outcome is quite different. When you change the weight
of the yarn and size of the hook, you create a different material (see Figure 9-3). Instead
of ruffles and bows around your waist, you can now wear them around your neck.
This project is for someone who has mastered the basic crochet stitches and is ready
to move on to new stitches. Make sure to work your gauge swatch to get the hang of
the long single crochet stitch, and you’ll be moving through each step just like a pro.

This pattern really uses only two different stitches, the chain stitch and the single cro-
chet stitch. The other two listed in the “Stitches used” line are just variations and com-
binations of the single crochet. Work your chains and gather them together to form the
bow-like design, then add some single crochet shells across the edges, and you’ve got
a feminine scarf to dress up your outerwear.

Child’s Rolled-Brim Hat
In most parts of the country, hats are an indispensable part of a child’s cool-weather
wardrobe. The best kind of hat is one that your child can just pull on with no fuss and
then pull off again and throw in the closet (or shove into a backpack). This design is
for a basic hat with a rolled brim, and the yarn has the look of many tiny beads strung
together, which gives it a really fun pattern, as shown in Figure 9-4.

Starting at the top of the hat, working in rounds, you increase the diameter using
double crochet stitches until the correct size is reached, and then you work the pat-

rolling the last two rounds up toward the outside, and then sewing the last round to
the hat itself. For a refresher on working in rounds, see Chapter 4.

24 in. of yarn, sew last round of stitches to third round from bottom edge.
Adult’s Rolled-Brim Hat
Just like kids, adults need to keep their heads warm, too, and this pattern, which is
identical to the child’s rolled-brim hat pattern (see the previous project), adapts well
to the increase in size. Simply by changing the materials, you can create a hat that not
only functions well, but looks good, too. The resulting fabric is a bit more open and
airy (see Figure 9-5), providing a finished designed that will keep you warm and look-
ing good.
As you create this project, you’ll see that by using different materials, you can change
the final outcome without a complete redesign.

To crochet this hat, you start off with a small center ring, and by adding stitches incre-
mentally in each round (increasing), you work until the desired diameter is reached.
You then work even on the stitches to create the shape of the hat, and continue until
the proper depth is reached. The brim is created by rolling the bottom few rolls up and
sewing them into place. For more info on crocheting in rounds, see Chapter 4.

re you feeling adventurous? Ready to try something
new? This part is just loaded with patterns that com-
bine all of the basics and more. I’ve tried to include a little
bit of everything here.
There’s a chapter dedicated just to sweaters (although
you’ll find wearables in other chapters, too), and one that
lets you practice stitch combinations while crocheting
great accessories. Take a look at the chapter that includes
filet crochet designs and projects using the afghan stitch.
And for a really fun chapter, check out what you can make
crocheting with nontraditional materials, such as wire and
hemp. This same chapter introduces felting, which is
really hot these days, and also offers a new take on the tra-
ditional granny square.
Browse through the projects and pick a few to try. All are
unique, and they’re not your grandmother’s crochet!

Seams Sew Easy: Joining 
Pieces Together
In This Chapter

 Joining as you go to add length to a floral belt
 Working up a warm winter vest
M
any crocheted items are comprised of several pieces joined together. The methods
used to join these pieces are varied, and the method that you choose is largely dic-
tated by the design and the type of yarn that you’re using. For instance, the first pattern, the
furry boa pillow, lends itself best to sewing, as does the third pattern, the southwest vest,
because these two projects use a novelty yarn that can create a somewhat bulky seam when
crocheted.
But the flower-power belt is created by joining each separate motif (a repeated figure in a
design) as you go. When crocheting a design that’s comprised of motifs, you generally have 
a lot of them. Joining them as you go saves time (you don’t have to go back and sew every-
thing together), and it also creates a neater seam. Many motifs lend themselves to a quick
slip stitch in corresponding stitches across the edges to join.
Sewing separate pieces together creates a neater seam and works best in designs where you
don’t want the seam to be visible. On the other hand, crocheting a seam can be used as part
of the design. For instance, when joining pieces of an afghan, you can use a crocheted seam
not only to join the separate pieces, but to add color and dimension to the finished design.
This chapter allows you to practice two methods for joining pieces together and become
familiar with why each is used. So pick a project, grab your hook and yarn, and get 
crocheting!
Furry Boa Pillow
Pillows are a must-have for home décor — and if you walk through any store that carries
home fashions, you’ll see proof of this. This project gives you practice sewing pieces
together (see Figure 10-1), and at the same time creates a pillow that rivals many that you
see for sale — and at a fraction of the price. The yarn used is a very short, thick eyelash 
yarn with a strong base thread so it will stand up well to wear and tear. It’s available in a 
variety of colors, so choose one that fits your color scheme.

Materials and vital statistics
 Yarn: Bernat “Boa” bulky-weight fur yarn (100% polyester), Article # 164081
(1.75 oz. [50 g], 71 yds [65 m] each ball): 6 balls of #81206 Toucan
 Hook: Crochet hook size K-101⁄2 U.S. or size needed to obtain gauge
 Yarn needle
 Pillow form: 16 in. x 16 in.
 Measurements: 16 in. wide x 16 in. long
 Gauge: 10 sc = 41⁄4 in.; 10 rows = 4 in.
 Stitches used: Chain stitch (ch), single crochet (sc)
This design couldn’t be much easier. Crochet your foundation chain, and then work
rows of single crochet stitches until your piece becomes a square. It may be slow going
for the first row or two because of the furry nature of the yarn (sometimes it’s hard to
see the stitches), but don’t give up. Count the stitches as you go so you don’t inadver-
tently drop any, and pretty soon you’ll be moving right along.
Directions
Repeat these directions twice, once for the front and once for the back.
Foundation chain: Ch 43.
Row 1 (right side): Sc in 2nd ch from hook, sc in each ch across (42 sc), turn.

Part III: Putting Your Skills to the Test 

Row 2: Ch 1, sc in each sc across (42 sc), turn.
Rep Row 2 until piece measures 16 in. from beg. Fasten off.
Assembly: With the right sides of the front and back facing, using yarn needle and a
length of yarn approximately 24 in. long, sew the pieces together using the whipstitch
(see Appendix A for details on how to do this stitch) around three sides, matching
stitches across each edge. Turn right side out. Insert pillow form between 2 pieces and
sew remaining side closed.
Flower-Power Belt
This floral design is popping up in all the stores (see Figure 10-2), so here it does
double duty. Not only do you create this hot new fashion item, but you also practice
the technique of joining motifs as you go. Although this pattern includes a new skill
and probably falls within the intermediate skill level, it’s really quick and easy to 
navigate. This project is a great stepping stone to prepare you for more-advanced 
patterns.
This joining method is used quite frequently and is accomplished by joining corre-
sponding stitches on the current motif with those on the last motif made. It can consist
of just a few stitches, such as this one, or it can be worked around four sides of a
square motif. It’s a great method if it can be used, and you save time because you don’t
have to sew a lot of pieces together when you’re finished crocheting.

 Gauge: First rnd = 11⁄4 in.
 Stitches used: Chain stitch (ch), slip stitch (sl st), single crochet (sc), half double
crochet (hdc), double crochet (dc)
The flower motifs that make up this belt illustrate a common method for creating flow-
ers. There are many variations on this, but the principle is the same: Crochet a chain
loop, and then fill it with stitches that graduate in height from shortest to tallest, then
back down again. Joining the motifs is as easy as working a slip stitch into the corre-
sponding stitch on the previous motif where designated.
Directions
Make 4 (5) motifs of colors A, B, C, and D, working in the foll color sequence: A, B, C, D.

Southwest Vest
This vest is made with a wonderfully soft fur yarn in an unusual color combination
(see Figure 10-5). The half double crochet stitch is nice and fat, so you don’t have
spaces between the stitches. There are no buttonholes, zippers, or belts to deal with,
so you can just throw it on over a turtleneck and a pair of jeans, and you’re ready for a
brisk fall day.

Part III: Putting Your Skills to the Test 

The construction of this vest couldn’t be much simpler: The whole thing is worked in
one piece from the bottom edge to the armholes. The work is then split into the two
sides of the front and the back by skipping stitches to create the armhole openings.
The only sewing required is to sew the shoulder seams.
The first couple of rows worked with this yarn can be slow going, but after you’ve
gotten three to four of them done, the work becomes much easier.
Directions
Foundation chain: Ch 63 (71, 79, 87) + 2 (first hdc).

Assembly
Turn the vest inside out so the right sides are facing each other, and using the yarn
needle and a 12-in. length of yarn, use the whipstitch to sew the fronts to the back
across the shoulders, beginning at the armhole edge, matching stitches across.
Variation: Belt it!
If you’d like to have a vest that you can cinch, the easiest way is to make a belt.
Make a foundation chain long enough to fit around your waist, then add about 18 in.
Work 3 rows of single crochet stitches to complete the belt, or more if you’d like it a
bit wider.

o you want to know why crocheting is unique when compared to the other needlework
arts? Because after you’ve gotten the hang of the basic stitches, you can combine
them in simple ways to create totally different looks. Using only the chain stitch, slip stitch,
single crochet stitch, and double crochet stitch, you can add a plethora of stitch patterns to
your skill library.
The patterns in this chapter give you a chance to practice these frequently used combina-
tions while creating designs you’ll be proud to show off.
Elegant Evening Wrap
Many of us love to have a wrap around because you can take it on and off easily and you can
wear it with countless outfits (see Figure 11-1). The yarn I suggest here is actually a combina-
tion of three strands of yarn wound together to create one, with rich browns, coppers, and
gold eyelash included.
When crocheting with some of these newer novelty yarns, you may have some difficulty
working into the stitches, so a design such as this one is especially well-suited to these
yarns. The spaces are easy to see, the pattern is light and airy, and the strands of fur and 
eyelashes fill in the spaces.

Materials and vital statistics
 Yarn: Ironstone Yarns “Showstopper” bulky-weight yarn (1 strand each of Paris
Nights, Eyelash, and Mohair), (4.3 oz. [123 g], 100 yds [91 m] each hank): 5 hanks
of #2 copper/rust/brown
 Hook: Crochet hook size L-11 U.S. or size needed to obtain gauge
 Measurements: 20 in. wide x 691⁄2 in. long, excluding fringe
 Gauge: 10 sts in pat = 4 in.; 5 rows in pat = 4 in.
 Stitches used: Chain stitch (ch), double crochet (dc)
This is a fairly common stitch pattern, using only the chain stitch and double crochet
stitch. The pattern is really nice when working with textured yarns because you don’t
necessarily have to see the tops of the stitches. The stitches in the current row are
worked into the chain spaces created in the previous row, which also makes it really
fast to crochet.
Directions
Sometimes it’s easier to “see” with your fingers. Let your fingers feel for the next space
to stick your hook into.

(see Appendix A for fringe how-to’s).
Double-Crossing Belt
Everyone is wearing belts these days, and you see them in all sorts of styles and mate-
rials. Based on the name, you may think that this belt can be wrapped around you
twice, but the name is actually based on the name of the stitch combination used. You
rely on the half double crochet stitch and throw in some crossed double crochet
stitches every couple of inches (see Figure 11-3).

Chapter 11: Finding the Loopholes and Creative Combinations

What’s a crossed double crochet stitch, you ask? It’s nothing more than double cro-
chet stitches worked out of order. By doing so, you create an X-shaped pattern that is
slightly raised. The crochet thread used in this project is available in a wide range of
colors, so if your wardrobe doesn’t call for a white belt, choose your own color.
Materials and vital statistics
 Size: Directions are for size X-Small. Changes for Small, Medium, Large, X-Large,
and XX-Large are in parentheses. Finished waist: 34 (36, 38, 40, 42, 44) in.

 Hook: Crochet hook size E-4 U.S. or size needed to obtain gauge
 Belt buckle: Dritz Glamour Rings, 21⁄8 in., gold
 Tapestry needle
 Measurements: 2 in. wide x 34 (36, 38, 40, 42, 44) in. long
 Gauge: 5 sts and 4 rows hdc = 1 in.
 Stitches used: Chain stitch (ch), single crochet (sc), half double crochet (hdc),
double crochet (dc), triple crochet (tr). Crossed dc: Skip next st, dc in next st,
working behind dc just made, dc in last skipped st.
When determining which size to make, measure your waist (or hips, depending on
where you’ll wear the belt), and add approximately 3 inches to get your finished size.
To work the crossed double crochet stitch, you simply jump around a bit when you
stitch the double crochet stitches. Instead of working them straight across a row, you
simply skip a stitch, work your double crochet stitch, and then go back and work a
double crochet stitch in the skipped stitch. The stitch diagram in Figure 11-4 gives you
an idea of what stitches to make where. If you want more-detailed instructions on
making the crossed double crochet stitch, flip to Appendix A.

Love Those Loops Scarf
Throw a loop into your wearable accessories with this design. The loop stitch used to
create the texture in this standout scarf is actually a variation of the single crochet.
The loops appear on the “wrong” side of the fabric, but because you work the stitch in
consecutive rows, the loops show up on both sides of the scarf (see Figure 11-5).
121
Chapter 11: Finding the Loopholes and Creative Combinations

New skill: The loop stitch
When working the loop stitch, the most important thing is to try to get your loops uni-
form in size. There really is no standard size, but they should be somewhere around an
inch long. If your loops vary in size across each row, it can tend to look a little messy.
When working your gauge swatch, which is a great way to practice this stitch as well,
you’ll probably find that you tend to create the loops at a certain length. Don’t try to
change this, just concentrate on making them all the same. If you find that your loops
are disappearing as you crochet subsequent rows, don’t worry about it. When you’re
finished, just go back and give them a gentle tug, and they’ll reappear as good as new.
To make a loop stitch:
1. Using the index finger of your yarn hand to control the loop size, wrap the
yarn from front to back over your index finger, and insert your hook in the
next stitch (see Figure 11-6a).
2. Pick up both threads of the loop and draw through stitch (3 loops on hook)
(see Figure 11-6b).
3. Yarn over, and draw yarn through the 3 loops on your hook.
Figure 11-6c shows a completed loop stitch.

Part III: Putting Your Skills to the Test 

Make sure to work a practice swatch so you can get the hang of the stitch. It may take
a little time to get the loops uniform in size, but the end result is well worth it.
Materials and vital statistics
 Yarn: Caron “Simply Soft Brites” worsted-weight yarn (100% acrylic), Article
#H9700B (6 oz. [170 g], 330 yds [302 m] each skein): 1 skein of #9605 Mango
 Hook: Crochet hook size J-10 U.S. or size needed to obtain gauge
 11⁄2 in. pompom maker (optional)
 Measurements: 4 in. wide x 49 in. long, excluding pompoms
 Gauge: 10 loop sts and 10 rows = 3 in.
 Stitches used: Chain stitch (ch), single crochet (sc), loop stitch (see the “New
skill: The loop stitch” section)
Crocheting the loop stitch may seem intimidating, but it’s not hard. The stitch is
simply a version of the single crochet. Instead of pulling your yarn tight as you draw it
through the stitch, you leave a loop hanging on the wrong side. This design is worked
by crocheting rows of the loops stitch, separated by several rows of single crochet,
and finishing it off with fun pompoms on each corner.
Directions
Foundation chain: Ch 13.
Row 1 (right side): Sc in 2nd ch from hook, sc in each ch across (12 sc), turn.
Rows 2–11: Ch 1, work one loop st in each st across (12 loop sts), turn.

Rep Row 2–19 ten times or until scarf measures 3 in. less than desired length.
Rep Rows 2–11 one time.
Last Row: Ch 1, sc in each st across (12 sc). Do not turn.
Edging: Working in row-end sts across long edge of scarf, sc evenly across long edge to
next corner, 3 sc in corner st, sc in each st across short edge to next corner, 3 sc in
corner st, working in row-end sts across next long edge, sc evenly across long edge to

Chapter 11: Finding the Loopholes and Creative Combinations

Variation: Adding more loops
If you’re looking for more loops, then you’ve come to the right place. In the main pat-
tern, each section of loops is separated with sections of single crochet stitches. Here,
you omit the single crochet sections and just keep going with the loops. To be on the
safe side, pick up an extra skein of yarn so you can be sure not to run out.
Foundation chain: Ch 13.
Row 1 (right side): Sc in 2nd ch from hook, sc in each ch across (12 scs), turn.
Row 2: Ch 1, work one loop st in each st across (12 loop sts), turn.
Rep Row 2 until scarf reaches 49 in. or desired length.
Last row: Ch 1, sc in each st across (12 sc). Do not turn.
Edging: Working in row-end sts across long edge of scarf, sc evenly across long edge to
next corner, 3 sc in corner st, sc in each st across short edge to next corner, 3 sc in
corner st, working in row-end sts across next long edge, sc evenly across long edge to
next corner, sl st to join. Fasten off.
Optional finishing: Make four 11⁄2-in. pompoms with pompom maker. Loosely tie one
pompom to each corner on each short edge of scarf.
Variation: Fashioning a furry look
Turn your loops into fur! When you’re finished crocheting, cut the loops in two to
create a fur-like fabric. Don’t worry about the stitches falling apart. Each stitch is
secured as it’s made, so you won’t end up with a bunch of short pieces of yarn.
Variation: Swapping yarns
This scarf would also look wonderful made with a softly textured yarn such as a
mohair blend. You can also tone it down by using a more subtle color.
Geometric Wrap
If you take a look around you when you go to the mall, or almost any clothing store for
that matter, you’re bound to see a design such as the one in this wrap (see Figure 11-7).
Worked in the shape of a triangle, the V-stitch, which is comprised of two double cro-
chet stitches joined by a chain stitch, creates an open and lacy pattern that makes this
wrap ideal for when there’s a touch of chill in the air. The yarn adds a slight shimmer
and is available in several colors. If you don’t want to wear it as a wrap, go for the
modern look and wrap it around your waist (sideways, of course) as a great accent to
a pair of jeans.

 Size: One size fits most adults
 Yarn: Aunt Lydia’s “Shimmer Fashion” fine sport-weight yarn (64% cotton/36%
rayon), Article #188 (2 oz. [57 g], 124 yds [113 m] each ball): 5 balls of #2242

 Hook: Crochet hook size I-9 U.S. or size needed to obtain gauge
 Measurements: 311⁄2 in. from bottom point to top edge; 45 in. across top edge
 Gauge: 7 V-sts = 5 in.; 10 rows in pat = 5 in.
 Stitches used: Chain stitch (ch), double crochet (dc). V-stitch: (Dc, ch 1, dc) in
same st or space. (For a quick reminder on how to create a V-stitch, refer to
Appendix A.)
Because the V-stitch creates an open fabric, watch where you put your hook. Make
sure to work your next row of stitches in the space created by the chain-one stitch 
of the V-stitch directly below it, and not between the V-stitches themselves (see Fig-
ure 11-8). The triangle shape of this pattern is created by starting with a single V-stitch,
then increasing them as you go along. The increases take place across two rows, in
this case Rows 4 and 5, until you reach the desired width.

Fringe: Cut yarn into 130 9-in. lengths. Using 2 strands of yarn held together as one for
each fringe, starting at the bottom point of wrap, single-knot one fringe in bottom
point, then in every even-numbered row across sides of wrap. Trim ends even. (See
Appendix A for more info on fringe.)
When cutting yarn for fringe, try to find something to wrap the yarn around that will
produce the lengths you need. You might try a book, a sturdy piece of cardboard, a CD
case, and so on.
Variation: Why knot add beads?
For a different twist, add some beads to the fringe. Just keep them small and light so
they don’t add too much weight.

F
or as long as I can remember, whenever I would mention crochet to people, they 
would get a funny look on their face, and I could almost see them thinking about all the
doilies, afghans, tablecloths, and other yarn stuff scattered around their grandmother’s
house. Fortunately, people now realize that crochet projects go way beyond home décor
items. Crochet is hot, especially when it comes to garments. You can see crocheted
sweaters, jackets, and tops on the runways at all the major fashion shows, and you can’t 
go into a clothing store without seeing clothes either entirely crocheted or at least embel-
lished with it. And then, of course, you have all sorts of crocheted accessories.
This chapter provides you with five patterns to crochet your own sweaters, from warm
winter pullovers to lacy tops. Just think how great you’ll feel when someone asks you where
you bought your top and you can tell them, “I made it!”
Vertical Stripes Tunic
Everyone knows that vertical stripes are flattering. Combine this concept with dark tones,
and you’ve got a sweater that’s not only pretty and warm, but one that makes you look great
as well (see Figure 12-1). When the cold weather comes in, this is definitely a sweater to
reach for.
Instead of working in rows from bottom to top as is typically done, you crochet this sweater
vertically. Because this method is different from normal crocheting, this tunic is best tackled
after you’ve mastered the basic crochet skills and are ready to move on to intermediate-level
projects. That doesn’t make the method any more difficult; it’s just different. You’ll come
across sweaters worked this way from time to time, and after crocheting this one, you’ll
know just what to expect.

Materials and vital statistics
 Size: Directions are for size Small (4–6). Changes for Medium (8–10) and Large
(12–14) are in parentheses. Note: This is an oversized garment.
 Yarn: Caron “Bliss” bulky-weight yarn (60% acrylic/40% nylon), Article #BL1000
(1.75 oz. [50 g], 82 yds [75 m] each ball):
• 13 (14, 15) balls of #0013 Black (MC)
• 2 balls of #0015 Fiesta (CC)
 Hook: Crochet hook size K-101⁄2 U.S. or size needed to obtain gauge
 Tapestry needle
 Measurements: Finished bust: 45 (47, 561⁄2) in. Back length: 221⁄4 in. Sleeve length:
151⁄4 in. Figure 12-2 shows finished measurements.
 Gauge: 10 hdc = 3 in.; 10 rows = 53⁄4 in.
 Stitches used: Chain stitch (ch), slip stitch (sl st), half double crochet (hdc)
The design of this sweater is atypical, although not uncommon. Sweaters are usually
worked in horizontal rows starting at the bottom edge and working up to the neck
edge, but not this one. Instead, you work in vertical rows starting at one side edge and
working across the front, shaping the armholes and neck as you go. There’s really only
one stitch involved, the half double crochet, and a couple of color-changing rows, so
you can concentrate on the design without having to worry about complicated stitch
patterns. (If you need a refresher on changing colors, head to Chapter 4.)

Putting the pieces together
When sewing the pieces of this sweater together, use the whipstitch (see Appendix A
for detailed instructions). With right sides facing, using yarn needle and MC, sew front
to back across shoulders. With right sides of sleeves facing in, fold sleeves in half
lengthwise. Matching the center fold to the shoulder seam, sew each sleeve in place.
Beginning at the lower edge of each side seam, leaving first 3 inches free, matching
stitches, sew side seams from lower edge to underarm. Sew underarm and sleeve
seams.
Lacy Bolero
This top is really fun. With its open, lacy design, you can wear this bolero anywhere
and any time (see Figure 12-3). Layer it over your favorite top — long or short sleeve, it
doesn’t matter — and you’ll have an eye-catching look.
The stitch pattern and shaping involved make this a more intermediate-level pattern,
but it’s nothing that you can’t tackle. After you’re done with this, take a look at the
designs displayed in the stores, and you’ll realize that it’s not so hard after all. Then
you can make your own instead of buying them. This design is fun, so go ahead and
make a few. Use different colors to match your wardrobe, or whip up a couple for
those teens in your life!

Because of the design, the fit of this garment is very forgiving. The front ties allow you
to adjust the front fit.
This fun little top is a great way to practice working a lacy stitch pattern. You start out
with a long foundation chain that sets the width for the top including the front ties
(don’t worry — the top isn’t this big across!). You then skip a bunch of stitches from
the end and begin to work the body of the top. This is then split to separate the fronts
from the back. The only assembly required is to sew the fronts to the back to create
the shoulder seams.

Chapter 12: Sensational Sweaters

Springtime Pullover
This lightweight, V-neck pullover is great for that layered look that never goes out of
style (see Figure 12-5). Made with a light-weight cotton flake yarn (that means the yarn
has thick and thin spots), the sweater is ideal for days when the weather is just start-
ing to warm up, but isn’t quite there yet.
The stitch pattern is used quite often for garments: single crochet and chain stitches.
You work in the chain spaces which makes the work move right along. Beads finish off
the bottom edge and sleeves, giving it a special flair. Because you work the sleeves
right onto the garment instead of working them separately, and then work some bead
crochet, the pattern is suitable when you’re ready for an intermediate-level project. I
know you’ll be just fine and will add new skills to your crochet library in the process.
Materials and vital statistics
 Size: Directions are for size Small (2–4). Changes for Medium (6–8), Large
(10–12), and X-Large (14–16) are in parentheses.
 Yarn: Ironstone Warehouse “Flake Cotton” light-weight cotton flake yarn (100%
mercerized cotton), (3.5 oz. [100 g], 328 yds [300 m] each skein): 3 (4, 4, 5) skeins
of #8702
 Hook: Crochet hook size H-8 U.S. or size needed to obtain gauge
 Tapestry needle
 Approximately 100 8mm clear blue glass or plastic beads
 Measurements: Finished bust: 30 (34, 38, 42) in. Back length: 20 (20, 21, 21) in.
Sleeve length: 91⁄4 in. Figure 12-6 shows finished measurements.

Part III: Putting Your Skills to the Test 

 Gauge: 15 sts and 15 rows in pat = 3 in.
 Stitches used: Chain stitch (ch), slip stitch (sl st), single crochet (sc). Dec 1 sc: •
(Insert hook in next st, yo, draw yarn through st) twice, yo, draw yarn through 3
loops on hook •.
The stitch pattern used to create the fabric for this sweater is really wonderful. It cre-
ates a fabric tight enough so you can’t see through it, yet is still flexible so you don’t
end up with a stiff garment. The layered look works perfectly with this design — throw
on one of those lacy little tanks to finish off the look. Creating the V-neck shape for
both the front and back is accomplished by decreasing your stitches in the designated
rows only at the neck edge of the sweater until you reach the correct number of
stitches. Then you work even until the length of the sweater is reached.
Fashioning the front and back
Note: You need to follow these directions twice — once for the front, once for the back.

Work even across 20 (25, 28, 32) sts until second neck measures 8 (8, 9, 9) in. from beg
of armhole shaping. Fasten off.
Attaching the front and back
With right sides facing, using tapestry needle and yarn, sew front to back across shoul-
ders using the whipstitch. You’ll sew the side seams when the sleeves are complete.
Checking out what’s up with your sleeves
Don’t worry if you end up with more stitches in the sleeve than you worked across the
body of the sweater. Sleeves can be deceptive in size and are often wider than the front
or back of the sweater itself, though they don’t appear so.
Row 1: With right side facing, join yarn in first st at beg of armhole shaping, working in
row-end sts across armhole, ch 1, sc in first row-end st, • ch 1, skip next st, sc in next
st •, rep from • to • across to beg of armhole shaping on opposite side of armhole,
ending with an odd number of sts, turn.
Row 2: Sl st in next st of armhole, ch 1, sc in first st in Row 1 of sleeve, work in estab-
lished pat across, turn.

1 st in last 2 sts, turn.
Work even in established pat for 4 more rows, then dec 1 st at each end of next row
and every 5th row thereafter 4 more times. Fasten off.
Rep sleeve across other armhole.
Completing the sweater assembly
With right sides facing, using tapestry needle and yarn, sew side seams and underarm
seams using the whipstitch. Leave sweater with wrong side facing out.
Adding the finishing touches
When crocheting with beads, the bead pops to the opposite side of the fabric that’s
facing you, so to get the beads to show up on the right side, you have to work from the
wrong side.
Bottom edging
String 45 beads onto yarn. With wrong side facing, join yarn in one side seam, working
across opposite side of foundation ch, ch 1, • sc in each of next 3 sts, draw 1 bead up
close to hook, sc in next st •, rep from • to • evenly around bottom edge, sl st in first
sc to join. Fasten off.
Sleeve edging
String 25 beads onto yarn. With wrong side facing, join yarn in underarm seam, ch 1, •
sc in each of next 3 sts, draw 1 bead up close to hook, sc in next st •, rep from • to •
evenly around lower edge of sleeve, sl st in first sc to join. Fasten off.
Rep sleeve edging across lower edge of other sleeve.
Neck edging
Turn sweater right side out. With right side facing, join yarn in one shoulder seam, 
ch 1, • sc in next st, ch 1, skip next st •, rep from • to • evenly around entire neck edge,
sl st in first sc to join. Fasten off.
Shell Stitch Tank Top
When warmer weather comes around, many of us put down our crochet hooks think-
ing that it’s too hot to work with yarn. But with this pretty tank top, you can continue
crocheting without having a lot of bulky yarn on your lap. Even better, you’ll have a
comfortable, cool, and fashionable top that you can pair with jeans, shorts, or a skirt
(see Figure 12-7).
141
Chapter 12: Sensational Sweaters

This design features the very versatile shell stitch, made with five double crochet
stitches. As with many stitch patterns, variations on both the stitch itself and the pat-
tern exist, but this pattern produces a fabric with stitches that are tight enough that
you don’t have to worry about anything underneath peeking through.
Materials and vital statistics
 Size: Directions are for size X-Small (4). Changes for Small (6), Medium (8–10),
Large (12–14), and X-Large (16) are in parentheses.
 Yarn: Artful Yarns “Fable” worsted-weight yarn (85% pima cotton/15% silk), 
(3.5 oz. [100 g], 184 yds [168 m] each hank): 4 (4, 5, 5, 5) hanks of #93 Little Red
Riding Hood
 Hook: Crochet hook size G-6 U.S. or size needed to obtain gauge
 Tapestry needle
 Measurements: Finished bust: 251⁄2 (28, 301⁄2, 321⁄2, 35) in. Back length: 201⁄2 (201⁄2,
201⁄2, 211⁄4, 211⁄4) in. Figure 12-8 shows finished measurements.
 Gauge: 3 shells in pat = 31⁄2 in.; 7 rows in pat = 3 in.
 Stitches used: Chain stitch (ch), slip stitch (sl st), single crochet (sc), double
crochet (dc). Shell: • 5 dc in same stitch •.
This design will definitely give you some practice with the shell stitch. The pattern
here calls for a 5-double crochet shell, which is pretty common. You’ll see how to
adjust the pattern so that the shells nestle upon each other in subsequent rows.
There’s very little neck shaping and no sleeves, so you can complete this project in 
no time.

Fur-Trimmed Jacket
If you’re looking for something with a bit of class, you’ve come to the right place. The
design of this jacket is slightly fitted, sits on the hip, and is trimmed with a “fur” collar
and cuffs. The striped pattern is easy to work (see Figure 12-9). Carry the yarn up the
sides and you won’t have to worry about weaving in a zillion little ends (see Chapter 4
for details on carrying the yarn).

Part III: Putting Your Skills to the Test 

The construction of this jacket is pretty typical of garments in general. Each piece is
made separately and then sewn together. You start with the back, then make each of
the fronts. When these pieces are finished, you sew them together, and your project
starts to look like something. Then you crochet each of the sleeves and sew them into
place. Last but not least, you add the fur collar and cuffs to complete the design.

Timeless Techniques: Using the 
Afghan Stitch and Filet Crochet
In This Chapter
 Creating an adorable baby blanket in basic afghan stitch
 Making a tote bag using the Tunisian knit stitch
 Showing your love of reading with a filet crochet bookmark
 Dressing up your windows with a lacy valance
T
he two techniques outlined in this chapter are quite different than those shown in other
chapters. They aren’t any more difficult, they just enable you to create designs with a
look that is set apart from traditional crochet. The afghan stitch, worked with a special
afghan hook, creates a pattern similar to knitting; filet crochet uses blocks and spaces to 
give you a lacy look. It’s also perfect for “writing out” words and creating pictures, as you
discover in the bookmark project.
Don’t be intimidated by something new — I think you’ll find these techniques a welcome
addition to your crochet skills. Pick a project, grab a hook and some yarn, and start 
creating!
Afghan Stitch Baby Blanket
Baby items are among the most popular designs to crochet. While I was waiting, rather impa-
tiently, for the arrival of my daughter, I would crochet for her in my spare time. Not only did I
create beautiful blankets, booties, and other cute accessories, but keeping my hands busy
also helped take my mind off the fact that I couldn’t see my feet anymore. Whether for you, a
family member, or a friend, crocheted baby items are not only useful, but they also quite
often become heirlooms to be passed down through generations.
The afghan stitch lends itself wonderfully to baby blankets because of the tight stitch pat-
tern. It creates a warm fabric without any loose holes for tiny fingers and toes to get caught
in. The size of this blanket (see Figure 13-1) was designed with a bassinet or stroller in mind,
so it’s large enough to cover a baby without the risk of getting tangled up.

New skill: The afghan stitch
The afghan stitch differs from other crochet stitches in the way you create each stitch.
Instead of working off all loops and ending up with just one loop on your hook after each
stitch, here the stitches are created across two rows. In the first row, you draw up loops
for each stitch, and they all stay on your hook (you have a special hook with an end sim-
ilar to that of a knitting needle). On the second pass through, you work the loops off the
hook. The added benefit to this method is that you don’t have to turn your work.
Working the first half of the foundation row
Chain the required number of chain stitches just like you would for any other pattern.
Then:
1. Insert your hook in the second chain from the hook, yarn over, and draw the
yarn through the stitch (see Figure 13-2a).
2. Insert your hook in the next chain, yarn over, and draw the yarn through the
stitch.
You should now have 3 loops on your hook.
3. Repeat Step 2 across the chain, as shown in Figure 13-2b.
This action of adding the loops to your hook is known as drawing up the loops.
You should have one loop for each chain stitch.

Part III: Putting Your Skills to the Test 

Working the second half of the foundation row
When you work the second half of the foundation row, you work the loops off the hook:
1. Yarn over hook, draw the yarn through 1 loop on the hook (see Figure 13-3a).
2. Yarn over hook, draw the yarn through the next 2 loops on your hook (see
Figure 13-3b).
3. Repeat Step 2 across the row until 1 loop remains on your hook (see Fig-
ure 13-4).
Working the next row and beyond
To begin the second row:
1. Insert your hook in the next vertical bar in the row below.
Don’t use the vertical bar directly beneath your hook.
2. Yarn over and draw the yarn through the stitch (see Figure 13-5a).
3. Repeat Steps 1 and 2 across the row until you reach the last stitch.
4. Insert your hook under the last two vertical bars at the end of the row (refer
to Figure 13-5b), yarn over, and draw the yarn through both vertical bars.
To finish the second row, repeat Steps 1 through 3 from “Working the second half of
the foundation row.” Each successive row will be worked in the same way as the
second row.

As the saying goes, practice makes perfect. Be sure to work a gauge swatch so you can
get the hang of the stitch and make sure your gauge is accurate. Swatches should be
about 4 inches square, so if you’re using the yarn for this project, start with a founda-
tion chain of 17 stitches, and work 16 rows to make a square. You’ll know you’ve got it
right if the vertical bars line up one on top of another.

No one will realize how easy it is to make this design when you show them the finished
product. The afghan consists of three separate panels worked in the basic afghan
stitch with no increasing or decreasing necessary. After the panels are complete, you
crochet a simple edging consisting of single crochet stitches, then join those together
with slip stitches. This is a perfect example of how the joining seam becomes part of
the design. Add a pretty border with the shell stitch, and you’re done.
Creating a couple of panels
This afghan is made up of 3 panels, one each in colors A, B, and C.
Foundation row: With afghan hook and first color, ch 25. Insert hook in second ch from
hook, yo, draw yarn through st, • insert hook in next st, yo, draw yarn through st •, rep
from • to • across, keeping all loops on hook (25 loops — first half of foundation row
complete), beg 2nd half of row, yo, draw yarn through 1 loop on hook, •• yo, draw yarn
through 2 loops on hook ••, rep from •• to •• across (1 loop remains and counts as
first st of next row).

sc, sc in next ch-1 space, skip next sc •, rep from • to • across to next corner, shell in
corner ch-1 space ••, rep from •• to •• around, sl st in first sc to join. Fasten off.
Variation: Making a bigger blankie
If you want to make this afghan for a toddler, increase the size of each panel by making
a longer foundation chain. For instance, to make it twice the size, double the number
of stitches in the foundation chain, then keep working rows until the panel reaches the
desired length. Follow the directions for the edging and border as written above. Don’t
forget to buy extra yarn.
Variation: Picking a new color palette
This afghan would look really great worked in different colors. Make it solid pink for a
little girl or blue for a little boy. Primary colors would look great as well.
Tunisian Stitch Tote Bag
What woman will ever say she has enough, or too many, bags? For some reason, most
of us seem to carry all kinds of stuff around, not including those items we carry in our
purses. This bag will serve a multitude of purposes — it’s neither too large nor too
small. The colorations in the yarn cause it to resemble a denim tweed when it’s
worked up, and the Tunisian stitch used (which is a variation of the basic afghan
stitch) closely resembles knitting (see Figure 13-6). You get a nice tight fabric with an
interesting pattern, and best of all, this yarn is user friendly. When the bag gets dirty,
you can throw it in the washer and dryer.
155
Chapter 13: Timeless Techniques: Using the Afghan Stitch and Filet Crochet

New skill: The Tunisian knit stitch
The Tunisian knit stitch, or stockinette stitch as it’s sometimes called, is a variation of
the basic afghan stitch. The foundation row is worked exactly the same. You’ll see the
pattern variation when you get to the second row and beyond. Instead of vertical bars
appearing as you work, you’ll see V’s marching across the row, one stacked upon
another. The difference comes in the placement of the hook when you draw up your
loops. Instead of inserting it under the front vertical bar, you insert it from front to
back between the front and back vertical bars.
To start the Tunisian stitch, work a foundation row just as you would for the basic
afghan stitch (see the “New skill: The afghan stitch” section in the preceding baby
blanket project).
For the first row of Tunisian knit stitch:
1. Insert your hook, from front to back, between the front and back strands of
the next vertical stitch, yarn over, and draw the yarn through the stitch (see
Figure 13-7a).
2. Repeat Step 1 across the row until you reach the last stitch.
3. Insert your hook under the last 2 vertical bars at the end of the row (see
Figure 13-7b), yarn over, and draw the yarn through the stitch.

Part III: Putting Your Skills to the Test 

Work the loops off the hook in the same way as described for the basic Afghan stitch
in the “New skill: The Afghan stitch” section in the baby blanket project. Now you’ve
completed one row of Tunisian knit stitch (see Figure 13-8).
Work a practice swatch using the yarn suggested in this pattern not only to ensure that
your gauge is correct, but to get a handle on the stitch. Your swatch should be about 4
inches square, so start with a foundation chain of 15 stitches, then work the Tunisian
stitch for 16 rows. The resulting pattern will remind you of a knitted fabric, with a
whole bunch of V’s lined up side by side, one on top of another.

The construction of this bag couldn’t be easier. You crochet a big rectangle using the
Tunisian stitch, fold it in half to form the bag, and then sew the side edges together.
The handles are added afterward by crocheting several rows of single crochet stitches.
Making the body of the bag
Foundation row: With afghan hook and first color, ch 50. Insert hook in second ch from
hook, yo, draw yarn through st, • insert hook in next st, yo, draw yarn through st •, rep

complete), beg 2nd half of row, yo, draw yarn through 1 loop on hook, •• yo, draw yarn
through 2 loops on hook ••, rep from •• to •• across (1 loop remains and counts as first
st of next row).

Rows 3–4: Ch 1, sc in each sc across, sl st in next sc on edge of bag, turn. Fasten off.
Rep handle on opposite side of bag.
Love-to-Read Bookmark
This design is for the readers in your life. Anyone who spends a lot of time with books
knows how valuable a good bookmark is. The pattern uses the filet crochet stitches of
blocks and spaces to spell out a special message (see Figure 13-9), with some basic
decreasing at the top.
You’ll work from a chart to create this project. Make a copy of the chart and work from
that. You can then mark the rows you’ve completed or highlight the current row, and
you’ll still have the original for future use. To make the chart even easier to read,
enlarge it so you can see where you are and where you’re going without having to
search for the right row.
New skill: Basic filet crochet stitches
Not only is filet crochet easy to work, but it’s easy to read as well. Because filet pat-
terns are charted, you don’t have to worry about reading rows and rows of written
instructions. The reason they are charted is this: Each square on the chart represents
either a space or a block. Each space or block is made up of a certain number of
stitches, which are given to you in a key. Typically, each square is 3 stitches, although
as with anything, there are variations. The rows on the chart are numbered, and you
work from the bottom up.
158
Part III: Putting Your Skills to the Test 

Making spaces
Spaces form the mesh, or background, upon which the design is created. They are also
used within the design itself to separate the blocks, allowing the picture or words to
appear. To work the first row of spaces, chain the designated number of stitches for
your foundation chain. Then:
1. Chain 2 (top of first space), and then double crochet in the 8th chain from the
hook to create the first space.
2. Chain 2, skip the next 2 chain stitches, and double crochet in the next chain
stitch.
You’ve just completed the second space.
3. Repeat Step 2 across the row (see Figure 13-10).
To work the second row of spaces:
1. Chain 3 for the first double crochet.
2. Chain 2 more for the top of the first space.
3. Skip the next 2 chain stitches, and double crochet in the next double crochet.
4. Repeat Steps 2 and 3 across the row.

Building blocks
Blocks are the solid squares that are used to create the main design, whether it’s a pic-
ture or a saying. They’re also used quite frequently to make a border that frames the
main design. To work the first row of blocks, chain the designated number of stitches
for your foundation chain, and then:
1. Double crochet in the 4th chain from the hook.
2. Double crochet in the next 2 chain stitches to complete the first block.
3. Double crochet in each of next 3 chain stitches to complete the second block.
4. Repeat Step 3 across the row (See Figure 13-11).
Practicing with a swatch
Figure 13-12 shows a chart that you can use to make a swatch and practice filet cro-
chet spaces and blocks. To make a swatch that is 5 squares wide by 5 rows high and
uses both spaces and blocks, follow these steps:
1. Chain 18 for your foundation chain.
2. Chain 2 to create the top of the first space.
3. Double crochet in the 8th chain from the hook to create the first space.
4. Chain 2.
5. Skip the next 2 chain stitches.
6. Double crochet in the next chain stitch.
Two spaces are now complete, and you’ve completed the first two squares on

Part III: Putting Your Skills to the Test 

When working a filet crochet design, it’s really easy to see when you’ve got it right or if
you’ve made a mistake. Squares will line up on top of each other, so whether the
squares contain spaces or blocks, every three stitches that make up a square will be in
alignment.
Decreasing spaces and blocks
Sometimes filet crochet designs require you to decrease spaces or blocks, usually to
create an interesting border or edge shape. Decreasing is always done at the beginning
or end of a row, never in the middle.
To decrease one space or block at the beginning of a row:
1. Slip stitch in each of the first 3 stitches.
2. Chain 3 for the first double crochet of the next space or block.
3. Continue following the chart across the row.
To decrease more than one space or block at the beginning of the row, simply slip
stitch in each stitch across for the number of spaces or blocks that you’re decreasing.
To decrease one space or block at the end of a row:
1. Work the chart across the row until you reach the last 3 stitches (the begin-
ning of the last space or block).
2. Turn your work, leaving the remaining stitches unworked.
To decrease more than one space or block at the end of a row, work the row according
to the chart, then stop crocheting when you’ve completed all the spaces or blocks.
Turn your work and begin the next row.

Finishing: Using liquid starch, block the finished piece as follows:
1. Hand wash the design gently in cold water with mild soap, rinsing several
times to remove all soap residue.
2. In a separate clean tub, prepare liquid starch solution according to the direc-
tions on the bottle.
3. Immerse the crocheted piece in the solution and allow the solution to com-
pletely penetrate the fabric.
4. Prepare a blocking surface large enough to accommodate the design, such as
a piece of cardboard or foam board wrapped in plastic.
5. Remove the item from the solution and blot it with a clean towel to remove
any extra solution.
6. Using rustproof straight pins, pin the design onto the blocking board to the
required dimensions, taking care to shape any stitch patterns.
7. Blot the design again to remove any excess solution that may still remain.
8. Allow the piece to dry completely before removing the pins.
Heartland Window Valance
The design of this window valance is a variation of one that has been around for many,
many years. The pattern incorporates all the basic filet stitches: spaces, blocks, bars,
and lacets (see Figure 13-14). Using a heavier-weight yarn increases the size of the
design, making it suitable to hang at the top of a window.
New skill: Fancy filet crochet stitches
Filet crochet includes stitches called bars and lacets, in addition to spaces and blocks
(see the “New skill: Basic filet crochet stitches” section under the bookmark project).
Both lacets and bars are worked across two spaces or blocks in the previous row, as
opposed to just one. They aren’t any harder to make; they just lend a decorative
touch.

163
Chapter 13: Timeless Techniques: Using the Afghan Stitch and Filet Crochet

Creating lacets
Lacets resemble V’s, and it is the only filet crochet stitch to use a stitch other than the
chain stitch and double crochet. The center of the V is formed with a single crochet
stitch as follows:
1. Work the first double crochet as you would to begin a regular space or block.
2. Chain 3.
3. Skip the next 2 stitches.
4. Single crochet in the next stitch.
5. Chain 3.
6. Skip the next 2 stitches.
7. Double crochet in the next double crochet to complete 1 lacet (see Fig-
ure 13-15).
Putting in bars
Bars are really nothing more than double spaces that cross over two spaces or blocks
in the row below them. They are typically worked over a lacet, although not always. To
make a bar:
1. Work the first double crochet as you would to begin a regular space or block.
2. Chain 5.
3. Skip the next 5 stitches or 2 spaces.
4. Double crochet in the next double crochet to complete 1 bar (see Figure 13-16).

ning a lacet.

Practicing with a swatch
To get the hang of making lacets and bars, work this practice swatch using the chart
and key in Figure 13-17 before jumping into the next project.
1. Chain 27 for the foundation chain.
2. Chain 2 to create the top of the first space.
3. Double crochet in the 8th chain stitch from the hook to create the first space.
4. Chain 2.
5. Skip the next 2 chain stitches.
6. Double crochet in the next chain stitch.
Two spaces are now complete, and you’ve completed the first 2 squares on the
chart.
7. Repeat Steps 4 through 6 for each square in Row 1.
Row 1 of the chart is now complete.
8. To continue working the swatch, work the blocks, spaces, lacets, and bars fol-
lowing the chart. 
Read all odd-numbered rows from right to left and all even-numbered rows from
left to right. Fasten off at end of last row.
Increasing spaces and blocks
This design has a shaped lower edge, so to create this detail, you need to increase and
decrease spaces at the beginning of specified rows. Many filet crochet pieces are sym-
metrical, so you need to be able to increase spaces and blocks at both ends, but for
the sake of clarity, the instructions below only show you how to increase spaces at the
beginning of a row, which is all you need to complete this design. (Turn to the “New
skill: Basic filet crochet stitches” section in the bookmark project to find out how to
make spaces and blocks.)
To increase a space at the beginning of a row:
1. When you reach the end of the row that precedes the row you’re going to
increase, turn your work, then chain 2 for the base of the first increase space.
2. Chain 3 more for the turning chain of the row’s first double crochet.
3. Chain 2 more for the top of the first space.
4. Double crochet in the 8th chain from the hook (see Figure 13-18a).
Now you’ve completed one space increase, as shown in Figure 13-18b.

To increase a block at the beginning of a row:
1. When you reach the end of the row that precedes the row you’re going to
increase, turn your work, then chain 2 for the base of the first increase block.
2. Chain 3 more for the turning chain of the row’s first double crochet.
3. Double crochet in the 4th chain from the hook to complete the block’s 2nd
double crochet (see Figure 13-19a).
4. Double crochet in each of next 2 chain stitches to complete the first block, as
shown in Figure 13-19b.

Variation: Using the pattern to create edging
This design lends itself to adjustment. You can use a size 10 thread and a size 6 or 7
steel crochet hook to create shelf edging. Keep crocheting the pattern repeat until the
edging is as wide as you want it.
To make a pillowcase edging, use size 20 crochet thread and a size 12 steel crochet
hook. Work the pattern repeat until it reaches the desired width.

all sorts of fancy yarns to let your creativity shine. This chapter has a bunch of fun projects
that incorporate old-time traditions with new ideas and materials. The granny square is
showcased in a new light, while the pillowcase edging shows how you can create beautiful
bedding on your own without having to rely on department stores.
This chapter also covers felting, a hot new craze in crochet. And finally, you can check 
out two projects that show how to use nontraditional materials to crochet. Browse 
through the projects, then give one a try. You just may discover a whole new side to your
creativity!
Not Your Granny’s Scarf
Granny squares have made a comeback in a big way, but they certainly don’t resemble
those from when your granny may have worked the pattern. New advances in yarn affect
how the granny square is crafted and viewed today, and this scarf is no exception (see
Figure 14-1). Although the pattern itself remains the same, the colors and textures are
strictly modern.
This is a great project if you’re on the go, too, because you don’t have to cart around a big
unwieldy piece. Each square is made separately, and then sewn together in a strip to form 
a wear-everywhere scarf.

Materials and vital statistics
 Yarn: Coats and Clark “Moda Dea Metro” bulky-weight yarn (94% acrylic/
6% nylon), Article #R143 (3.52 oz. [100 g], 124 yds [113 m] each skein): 1 skein 
each of
• #9317 Vanilla (A)
• #9863 Mocha Latte (B)
• #9321 Wheat (C)
• #9340 Chocolate (D)
 Hook: Crochet hook size J-10 U.S. or size needed to obtain gauge
 Yarn needle
 Measurements: Motif = 51⁄4 in. wide x 51⁄4 in. long; scarf = 51⁄4 in. wide x 821⁄2 in. long
 Gauge: First 2 rnds of motif = 31⁄2 in. in diameter
 Stitches used: Chain stitch (ch), slip stitch (sl st), single crochet (sc), double
crochet (dc)
These granny square motifs work up quickly — each one is comprised of only four
rounds. See Figure 14-2 for the stitch diagram. When changing the colors between each
round, be sure to work over the yarn tails, that way you won’t be left with a lot of little
ends to weave in when you’re done. Sew the motifs together end to end to form a long
strip, and your scarf is complete.

Shells and Lace Pillowcase Edging
The design of this pillowcase edging (see Figure 14-3) was popular years ago, espe-
cially when women were still putting together hope chests for their daughters. A beau-
tifully made bed is something that has never gone out of style, though, and the
pillowcase edging here allows you to create a look that you won’t see in any store.
When you decide to add edging to something, you can choose from literally hundreds
of different edging designs. This one incorporates a variation of the shell stitch and
works up into a narrow band that you sew across the front of the pillow. Make it in the
beige color I use here, or go for a brighter look to add some pizzazz. This project is
good for an intermediate-level crocheter, mainly because you use crochet thread, which
is much finer and can be harder to work with. Don’t let that put you off, though. Thread
crochet makes some really beautiful designs.

Materials and vital statistics
 Yarn: DMC “Cebelia” size 10 crochet thread (100% double mercerized cotton),
Article #167G (1.75 oz. [50 g], 284 yds [260 m] each ball): 1 ball of #712 ecru

 Hook: Steel crochet hook size 4 U.S. or size needed to obtain gauge
 Sewing needle and matching sewing thread
 Measurements: 11⁄2 in. wide x 191⁄2 in. long

together) worked across 2 designated sts •. Picot: • Ch 6, sl st in 3rd ch 
from hook •. (For refreshers on the shell, cluster, and picot stitches, turn to
Appendix A.)
This is a great pattern to crochet for someone who’s relatively new to thread crochet.
It’s not too complicated, yet the results look like you’ve been crocheting for years. The
design is actually an expanded shell pattern (see Figure 14-4), one that you’ll likely see
if you do any amount of thread crochet. You may find that the edges curl a bit as you
work, but once you’re finished, wet the edging, shape it, lay it flat to dry, and it’ll be
just fine.
Directions
The length of this edging is long enough to cover the edge of one side of a standard pil-
lowcase. If you’d like to make your edging go all the way around the pillow, or if you
want to make a matching edging for your sheets, make a foundation chain that is long
enough for your needs and is a multiple of 9 sts + 5 to accommodate the pattern.
Foundation chain: Ch 122.
Row 1: Sc in 2nd ch from hook, sc in each ch across (121 sc), turn.

Finishing: To sew this edging to the pillowcase, pin the first row of the edging, close to
the foundation chain, to the right side of the pillowcase in the desired location. Using a
sewing needle and matching thread (or a sewing machine and matching thread), sew
the edging to the pillowcase across the entire front edge.
Honey, I Shrunk My Bag
Creating this felted carry-all is really fun! You start with one design and end up with
another. Felting is the hot new craze among crocheters, and with good reason. The
resulting fabric is soft, warm, and extremely durable (see Figure 14-5).
What is felting? You’ve probably done it and not even realized it. Remember when you
were learning how to do laundry, and you inadvertently put that wool sweater into the
washer and dryer and ended up with a sweater that would fit a child? Well, that’s what
felting is all about. Felting is what happens to wool fibers when they’re exposed to hot
water and friction. The stitches fuse into a densely woven fabric that is strong, but still
soft to the touch. Using wool yarn, you crochet your item several sizes larger than you
want the finished design to be. Then you throw the project into the washer and dryer
to fuse the strands of wool together. No two bags come out exactly the same, so you
always end up with a one-of-a-kind design.

 Hook: Crochet hook size K-101⁄2 U.S. or size needed to obtain gauge
 Measurements: 22 in. wide x 121⁄2 in. deep, excluding handles, and before felting
• Note: The finished measurements after felting will vary, but the carry-all
will be considerably smaller. The bag shown here measured 17 in. wide x 
9 in. deep, excluding the handles, after felting.
 Gauge: First 2 rnds of base = 13⁄4 in.
 Stitches used: Chain stitch (ch), slip stitch (sl st), single crochet (sc), half double
crochet (hdc)
The beauty of this design is that the stitches are basic, and when you get done, you
don’t really see them at all. Whether you tend to crochet on the loose side or make
your stitches tight, the final outcome will be unique. The felting process blends the
stitches together, so the look you get is one of a solid fabric.
Crafting the tote
You create the base and sides of the bag as you crochet by working in rounds, instead
of making the pieces individually and putting everything together at the end.

When felting an item, it’s just like washing any other article of clothing. Set the washer
to the hot or warm/cool rinse cycle and the appropriate load size. If you’re felting the
piece by itself, a small or medium wash setting will do the trick. Start the washer, and
add the recommended amount of detergent for the size load you’re going to run. If you
want, you can throw some like-colored items in with the piece to help increase the agi-
tation (however, check the yarn label to see if it tells you whether the yarn is colorfast).
It’s a good idea to check your piece periodically, once at least halfway through the
cycle, then again every few minutes or so to make sure it’s not felting (or shrinking)
too much. (To check the piece, stop the washer and wait for everything to stop moving
before you reach into the machine.) Take the bag out of the washer when it’s felted to
your satisfaction, or if, at the end of the cycle, you want a more felted look, just run the
piece through again.
You can also felt the bag even more in the dryer. Put the item in the dryer on the regu-
lar setting, and run the dryer until the piece is almost dry. Don’t worry if the shape is
skewed — while the bag is still damp, lay it flat, adjust into the proper shape, and
allow the piece to finish air drying. If your piece is felted to your satisfaction when it
comes out of the washing machine, you can let it air dry completely. Lay the piece on a
flat surface and shape to dry.
Don’t forget to check the piece during the felting process. After the fibers are fused,
you can’t undo it.
Variation: Felting? Fuhgeddaboudit!
If you really like the way the bag looks before the felting process, go ahead and use it
that way. If it gets wet or dirty, don’t worry — it won’t automatically felt. Just hand
wash the bag in cool water and lay flat to dry.
Hemp Basket
Baskets have a multitude of purposes, from displaying dried flowers in the living room
to holding pretty soaps in the bathroom. Large or small, square or round, they’re 
one of the most useful items to have around the house. Now you can create your own
baskets. This project uses hemp cord instead of yarn (see Figure 14-6), and one ball
176
Part III: Putting Your Skills to the Test 

will make enough baskets so you can have several to place around the house or share
with friends. It also proves that you don’t always have to crochet with yarn. Almost
any flexible material will work. Just use your imagination!
Materials and vital statistics
 Yarn: Hemp jewelry cord (worsted-weight) (73 yds [67 m] each ball): 1 ball
 Hook: Crochet hook size J-10 U.S. or size needed to obtain gauge
 Stitch marker
 Measurements: 51⁄2 in. in diameter across top x 21⁄2 in. tall
 Gauge: First 4 rnds of base = 23⁄4 in. in diameter
 Stitches used: Chain stitch (ch), slip stitch (sl st), single crochet (sc)
The pattern for this basket is typical of any round item you may come across, such as
hats. The difference is in the material. Hemp cord is a little stiffer than yarn, so you
may have to work a little harder to create each stitch.
Building the base
Center ring: Ch 4 and close into a ring with one sl st in first ch.
Rnd 1: Ch 1, work 4 sc in ring (4 sc), sl st in first sc to join.
Rnd 2: Ch 1, 2 sc in each sc around (8 sc), sl st in first sc to join.

Rnd 3: Ch 1, 2 sc in each sc around (16 sc), sl st in first sc to join.
Rnd 4: Ch 1, sc in each of first 3 sc, 2 sc in next sc, • sc in each of next 3 sc, 2 sc in next
sc •, rep from • to • around (20 sc), sl st in first sc to join.
Working your way up the sides
Rnd 1: Ch 1, working in blps of sts only, sc in each sc around (20 sc), do not join.
Continue working in a spiral, marking beg of each rnd and moving marker up as work
progresses.
Rnd 2: Working in both loops of sts, • sc in each of next 4 sc, 2 sc in next sc •, rep 
from • to • around (24 sc).
Rnd 3: Sc in each sc around (24 sc).
Rnd 4: • Sc in each of next 5 sc, 2 sc in next sc •, rep from • to • around (28 sc).
Rnd 5: Sc in each sc around (28 sc), sl st in first sc to join. Fasten off.
Variation: Making the basket just the right size
You can make bigger or smaller baskets. Increase or decrease the size of your base,
then the sides accordingly. If you want to make a taller basket, keep going up, up, and
around until the basket is the height you want.
Variation: Using different sizes of hemp cord
Hemp cord comes in different sizes. You can use a finer-weight cord and smaller hook,
or a heavier-weight cord and a larger hook.
If you use a finer-weight cord, your basket will be smaller in size. You can compensate
for this by making the base larger, then the sides taller to arrive at the same dimen-
sions as above.
If you use a heavier-weight cord, the basket will be larger. If that’s what you’re looking
for, then that’s just fine, but if you want to keep it the same size, decrease the size of
your base, and work the sides until they reach the desired height.
Wire-’n’-Beads Necklace
The wire-’n’-beads necklace is another example of using a nontraditional material to
crochet with. Wire is ideal and is readily available. If you look in the beading section of
your local craft store, you’ll find lots of it. Use wire that is 28 to 30 gauge (this is the
most flexible). It also comes in lots of different colors. The design shown here is really
simple (see Figure 14-7), and you can make the necklace in just a few hours. The
stitches are worked loosely, and as is done here, you can add beads or a charm or two
to give it an up-to-date look.

Who ever would have thought of crocheting with wire? Well, wait until you try this
one. Wire is really easy to work with. The only thing to remember is not to pull the
stitches too tight because they’re rather hard to undo. Leave them on the loose side,
and don’t worry if each one is not exactly the same size as the one before. This adds to
the charm of the design.

Make 6 strands: 2 each in pink, green, and blue.
Foundation chain: Thread 30 beads onto wire. Leaving a 3-in. tail, ch 2, • work one

Assembly: Lay strands side by side so that ends are even. Fasten ends to clasp accord-
ing to directions for your type of clasp.
Variation: Dressing up the look
Use gold or silver wire and clear or matching gold or silver beads for a more elegant
look.
Variation: Complementing the necklace
You can make a bracelet or anklet to wear when you wear the necklace. Reduce the
number of beads you use (you’d probably need about 10 beads for each strand, so
plan accordingly), and shorten the length of wire you chain. Assemble as above, and
wrap the piece around your wrist or ankle.

L
ooking for a quick crochet fix? Then you’ve turned to the right place. This chapter pro-
vides a bunch of quick and easy designs that are guaranteed to satisfy you when your
creative side needs a pick-me-up. If you’re anything like me (and lots of others out there),
sometimes you absolutely need to make something, but don’t want to get involved in a
lengthy project.
In this chapter, you’ll find an array of projects ranging from home décor to fashion acces-
sories and more. Many of them are great for gift-giving, or you can make a bunch to use as
party favors. You use size 10 crochet thread to make several of the designs, so you can make
more than one project using materials already at hand. And, as always, feel free to choose
colors to suit your own wardrobe or color scheme.
Lacy Bookmark
These bookmarks (see Figure 15-1) are for those who love to read and know the value of a
good book. No more dog-earred pages to mark the spot where you left off. This design is
quick enough, so you can make several in an evening. Then you’ll have plenty to use for your
reading and crochet books.
Materials and vital statistics
 Yarn: Coats & Clark “South Maid” size 10 crochet thread (100% mercerized cotton),
Article #D54 (350 yds [320 m] each ball): 1 ball of #458 Purple
 Hook: Steel crochet hook size 4 U.S. or size needed to obtain gauge
 Measurements: 3⁄4 in. wide x 63⁄4 in. long, excluding tassel
 Gauge: First rnd = 1⁄4 in.
 Stitches used: Chain stitch (ch), slip stitch (sl st), single crochet (sc), double crochet
(dc). Shell: • 5 dc in same st •.

These bookmarks work up really quickly — they’re only two rounds (see Figure 15-2
for the stitch diagram). They also give you a great opportunity to work with thread
without having to delve into a large project.
Directions
Foundation chain: Ch 50.
Rnd 1: Sc in 2nd ch from hook, sc in each ch across to within last ch, 3 sc in last ch,
working across opposite side of foundation ch, sc in each sc across to within last ch, 
2 sc in last ch (100 sc), sl st in first sc to join.

Finishing: To make the tassel, wrap thread 20 times around a 21⁄4-inch piece of card-
board (I used a credit card). Slide the thread off the cardboard and cut one end. Tie a
6-inch length of thread securely around the center of the bundle, leaving equal length
on each side. Fold the bundle in half, with the tie at the center top.
Wrap a second 6-inch length of yarn several times around the folded bundle approxi-
mately 1⁄4 inch below the folded end. Tie tightly to secure and trim extra length. Using
the remaining ends of thread from the first tie at the center top of the tassel, tie the
tassel securely to one end of the bookmark. Weave in the extra lengths and trim ends
even.

Geometric Coaster Set
No more boring, round things to protect your tabletop. These coasters use bold colors
and strong geometric shapes to help you serve drinks in style (see Figure 15-3). To
create the designs, each coaster’s unique design is depicted on a chart, instead of writ-
ing out each row. After you get used to following a chart, you’ll find that the chart is
much easier to “read” than if the instructions were written out row by row. The color
changes involved and the charted pattern make this a good project for you if you’ve
mastered crochet basics.

 Measurements: 4 in. wide x 4 in. long
 Gauge: 11 sc and 11 rows = 2 in.
 Stitches used: Chain stitch (ch), slip stitch (sl st), single crochet (sc)
When working from a chart, it’s a good idea to make a copy of the chart before you get
started. If necessary, you can enlarge it so it’s easier to read, and you can also mark 
it up to keep track of where you are. Doing so leaves the original chart intact for 
future use.
Only one skein of each color is needed to complete the set of four coasters. However,
because of the color changes in coasters 1 and 3, you need two skeins of white so you
don’t have to carry the yarn across too many stitches (see Chapter 4 for color-change
information).
Directions
Each coaster is made following a chart (see Figures 15-4, 15-5, 15-6, and 15-7). Read all
odd-numbered rows from right to left, all even-numbered rows from left to right. When
you begin this project, you’ll see that the first couple or rows are written out in normal
crochet fashion. This is typical when working from a chart, simply to get you going on
the right track. After these rows are completed, you then “read” the chart for the bal-
ance of the pattern.
To change color, complete the last single crochet of the first color with the next color.
Drop the first color to the wrong side to be picked up later. Attach separate balls of
color as needed. Fasten off colors when they’re not needed in the following row.

Part IV: The Part of Tens 

Variation: Creating coordinating 
table accessories
To make matching placemats that measure approximately 12 in. x 16 in., crochet 12
individual coasters for each placemat and omit the edging. Instead of making them all
the same pattern (that might get a little busy), try making half of them in solid colors,
and alternate them with the patterned ones, or use the patterned squares as a border
with a solid-colored center. When all are completed, lay out the squares 4 wide by 3
high in the desired pattern. Using a tapestry needle and matching yarn, sew the
squares together. Crochet the edging around the entire placemat the same way you
would for an individual coaster.
You can make a table runner in the same manner as the placemat. To figure out how
many coasters you need, decide how wide (in inches) you want the runner to be, then
divide by 4 inches (that’s the size of each coaster). Then decide how long (in inches)
you’d like it to be, and again divide by 4 inches. Obviously, the length and width have
to be numbers that divide equally by 4 so you get an even number. For that reason,
you may have to compromise a bit on the size.
Fun Fur Scrunchies
Everyone uses these indispensable hair ties these days, young and old alike.
Scrunchies are an easy way to dress up a ponytail or braids without a lot of fuss 
(see Figure 15-8). Each one of these patterns can be made in a short amount of time,
and you can choose colors to match everything in your wardrobe.
These three scrunchies use a fun fur yarn with little bobbles of color throughout.
Whether you make just one or all three, you’re sure to be pleased with the outcome.

Materials and vital statistics
 Yarn: Lion Brand “Fancy Fur” eyelash yarn (55% polyamide/45% polyester),
Article #220 (1.75 oz. [50 g], 39 yds [36 m] each skein): 1 skein each of
• #295 Party Pink
• #200 Wild White
• #254 Stained Glass
Each skein makes several scrunchies.
 Hook: Crochet hook size I-9 U.S. or size needed to obtain gauge
 Elastic: 8 in. of 1⁄4-in. wide elastic for each scrunchy
 Sewing needle and sewing thread
 Measurements: 31⁄4 in. in diameter
 Gauge: 4 sts = 1 in.
 Stitches used: Chain stitch (ch), slip stitch (sl st), single crochet (sc)
This is one of a very few designs that you’ll see where you don’t crochet a foundation
chain or center ring. The elastic acts as the center ring, and you work your first round
of stitches over the elastic in the same way that you would a crocheted center ring.
Crochet the second round as you normally would and you’re done!
Directions
With sewing needle and thread, sew ends of one 8-in. length of elastic together to form
a circle.
Rnd 1: Working over elastic ring, sl st yarn onto elastic, ch 1, work 50 sc in ring (50 sc),
sl st in first sc to join.
Rnd 2: Ch 1, 2 sc in each sc around (100 sc), sl st in first sc to join. Fasten off.
Friendship Bracelet
These bracelets (see Figure 15-9) are reminiscent of the ones I used to make as a kid,
though those weren’t crocheted. Of course, one was never enough, and we had to make
several in different colors to wear at the same time. Although this design is worked in a
pastel palette, bold-colored stripes or even solid colors would work just as well.
The bracelet is designed to fit loosely around the average adult wrist, but it’s easy
enough to adjust the length. If you’re making these for the younger set, use the gauge
to calculate how long to make your foundation chain for a smaller version.

The fit of the bracelet can be adjusted at this point. If you’d prefer it to be looser, sew
the snaps closer to the edge. If it needs to be tightened, sew the snaps farther from the
edge.
Variation: Dressing the bracelet up with ribbon
Instead of using snaps, you can fasten the bracelet with a pretty tie. Thread an 8-in.
length of matching ribbon through each short end, and tie the ribbons together in a
bow to secure the bracelet to your wrist.
Variation: Adding some width
If you’d like a wider version of the bracelet, rep Row 2 above for 4 more rows in the fol-
lowing color sequence: 1 row D; 1 row C; 1 row B; 1 row A. This will give you a bracelet
that is a little more than an inch wide.
Velvet Roses
While these roses don’t look exactly like the ones you’d pick out of your garden, they
come pretty darn close (see Figure 15-10). The nice thing is you can choose the colors,
and can even adjust their size. This is one of those designs where, by changing yarn
and hook size, you can adjust the size of the finished design. And the finished project
is 3-D, rather than flat, which makes it an intermediate-level project. Don’t let this
dimensional stuff throw you off, though. Flowers such as these are really fun to make,
and after you get the hang of it, you’ll see that they’re no trouble at all.
You can use the roses to embellish hats, scarves, even jackets — add a pin back to
them and you can attach them almost anywhere. Use your imagination and grow a
whole bouquet!

When you make crocheted flowers, the petals are created in rounds as you go. For
three-dimensional flowers such as these, it’s a two-step process. You start with the
petals in the center of the flower, then crochet chain loops behind these petals in the
second round. On the third pass around, you crochet the actual petals in the chain
loops from the previous row. You just keep working in this fashion until all petal
rounds are complete. Refer to the stitch diagram (Figure 15-11) for placement of the
stitches.

Pocket Patches
Have you seen those jeans in the store that cost an arm and a leg? Many of them have
simple embellishments on the back pockets that allow the stores to raise the prices
through the roof. A friend of mine had on a pair of those jeans, and it inspired me to
create this design (see Figure 15-12). You can now have those jeans at a fraction of the
price. This design falls in the intermediate category for two main reasons — you’re
crocheting with thread and the construction. You make three small motifs, sew them
together, then work a section off of the joined motifs. Take your time and you’ll find it’s
not that difficult.

To create these pocket patches, you’ll need to crochet three motifs for each pocket,
and then sew them together. After the motifs are joined, you work a pattern of coordi-
nating stitches off the bottom edge to finish the design. Finally, you sew the patch onto
the back pocket of your favorite pair of jeans. Refer to Figure 15-13 for the stitch and
assembly diagram.

Stemmed-Glass Markers
These little wine glass doodads (see Figure 15-14) have soared in popularity over the
past few years, and with good reason. What better way to always know which glass is
yours, instead of wondering if you’re drinking someone else’s drink.
Made with earring hoops, size 10 crochet thread, and a charm, you can whip one of
these up in about 10 minutes. In an evening, you can have a whole bunch made to
show off and use at your next gathering. They’d also make a wonderful hostess gift the
next time you need one.

 Stitches used: Chain stitch (ch) slip stitch (sl st), single crochet (sc). Picot: Sc in
3rd ch from hook (see Appendix A for detailed how-to’s).
The earring hoops used in this design generally come in packages with quite a few
included, so you’ll have enough hoops to make as many of these markers as you need.
When picking out the charms, don’t forget to vary the design so everyone has his or
her own. If all the charms are the same, it kind of defeats the purpose!
This is one of those designs where you don’t actually crochet a foundation chain or
center ring. The first row is worked directly around the hoop of the earring, then you
work back to finish the second row, adding the charm as you go (see Figure 15-15 for
the stitch diagram).
Directions
Thread charm onto crochet thread before beginning.
Row 1: Starting at loop end of hoop, join yarn to earring hoop with sl st, ch 1, work 31

These markers would make great additions to holiday parties as well as for the differ-

Christmas. The size 10 thread comes in every color of the rainbow, and the variety of
charms available is endless. Use your imagination and create a set for all occasions.
Must-See Fur Frame
Some pictures deserve to be shown off in a special frame, and this one does the trick
(see Figure 15-16). Made with a long eyelash yarn, it’s especially pleasing for tweens and
teens to show off pictures of themselves and their friends. This project is suitable for
you if your skills have advanced to an intermediate level. The yarn itself can be hard to
work with (sometimes it’s hard to see the stitches through the fur). And the large center
ring can be a challenge. Just make sure not to twist it when you join the ends, and count
your stitches as you go so you get the corners right on the first go-round.

This frame begins with a large center ring, which you have to be sure not to twist when
you join the ends. In the first row, you create the corners, turning the ring into a
square. Each successive row builds on the first, making it wider, so you’ll have plenty
of material to attach to the frame when you’re finished.

Standout Luggage Tags
When traveling by plane these days, it seems that almost everyone has the same lug-
gage, or at least bags that are similar enough to make it hard to tell yours apart from
the hundreds of others that come spinning out into the baggage-claim area. These lug-
gage tags (see Figure 15-17) make it easy for you to customize your bags so you don’t
have to spend time watching the carousel go round and round, grabbing for bags that
aren’t yours. And because these tags only use a small amount of yarn, they’re also a
great way to use up leftover scrap yarn.

making buttonholes without having to crochet a whole sweater. But don’t worry — 
buttonholes are a piece of cake to create. In this case, all you do is crochet a small
chain where specified, skip a few stitches, then join the yarn back to the row, and
you’re on your way again.

Ten-Plus Tips for Caring 
for Your Crochet
In This Chapter
 What to do when the work is done
 Maintaining the look of your crocheted pieces
 How to properly store your pieces of art
N
ow that you’ve completed your design, the final step is making it look its best and
making sure that it stays looking its best. Because of all the time you’ve invested, it
would be a shame to have your project fall apart on the first wash, shrink to a baby-doll
size, stretch so far out of proportion it’s unrecognizable, or discolor by being improperly
stored.
It’s not difficult to preserve the beauty of the original finished piece, but you do need to take
a few extra steps. Follow the appropriate tips given in this chapter to ensure that your work
will stick around for a long time.
Be a Pack Rat: Save the Labels
Don’t throw out those yarn labels! Every yarn label has care instructions on it. Keep them
organized in a binder, or keep a notebook of your projects with the yarn label attached. 
Write a note underneath the label with the name or description of the crocheted item so
you’ll have a handy reference when you need to launder that item. Figure 16-1 provides a
complete list of care symbols and information about each one.

Show You Care: Attach 
Your Own Care Labels
Another way to know how to care for an item is to sew a care label (if appropriate)
onto the item itself. These are available at craft stores and some yarn shops. Use a per-
manent ink pen to write care instructions on the label (before you attach the label to
the item! You don’t want to ruin all of your hard work by getting permanent ink on it).
Attaching a care label works best for items such as garments and afghans. You can also
include your name and the date you made the item, too.
The best way to attach the label is to sew it on with a sewing needle and matching
sewing thread. Don’t iron the label on — you can ruin all your work with one blast of
heat.
It’s especially important to include care information if you’re giving the piece to some-
one as a gift. Even though you may know how to care for it, the recipient probably
doesn’t have a clue. If it’s not practical to attach a label directly to the item, then a dec-
orative card with the instructions would work just as well. You don’t have to go into
great detail, just a simple phrase would do. Here are some ideas to help you word the
instructions:
 “I’m delicate. Please hand wash me and lay me flat to dry.”
 “I can be washed and dried.”
 “Take me to the cleaners — I need it.”

Forget Dishpan Hands. Get Afghan Hands!
Hand washing your crocheted items is the safest bet. Unless the yarn specifically
states “dry clean only,” this is what I recommend. Here’s how:
1. Grab a bottle of mild detergent and make sure your sink or bathtub is clean.
The best soap to use is a mild laundry detergent formulated for delicate items or
baby clothes, such as Woolite or Ivory Soap. For small items, the kitchen sink is
the perfect size. For larger items such as afghans, the bathtub or washtub works
better.
2. Fill the sink or tub with enough cool to warm water so the item can be
submerged.
3. Swish the item around gently.
By keeping the agitation to a minimum, you preserve the integrity of the stitches.
4. After washing, rinse thoroughly and squeeze out excess moisture.
Rinse the item under cool water until it runs clear.
Never wring a crocheted item because the twisting motion can stretch the
stitches and ultimately ruin the item’s shape.
5. Wrap the item in towels to absorb the extra moisture and lay flat to dry, block-
ing as necessary (see the next section for blocking info).
Never hang a crocheted piece to dry (it will stretch out of shape beyond recogni-
tion), and please, keep items out of the sun, which can cause fading.
Blocking for a Better Shape
If you’re an experienced seamstress or crafter, when you see the word blocking, you
probably want to run the other direction. If you’re new to the term, I’m not talking
about defensive sports moves or the movements of actors on stage. Blocking often
involves lots of starch, straight pins, and room to lay out your design, and this is true
when blocking thread crochet. Although blocking can be a complicated process in
some cases, items you craft with yarn can be whipped into shape rather easily.
Blocking can be as simple as the following four steps:
1. Wet the item until it is saturated, squeezing out excess moisture if necessary.
2. Lay it flat, using an absorbent towel underneath to soak up moisture.
Make sure to lay the piece away from sunlight and direct sources of heat.
3. Shape it.
4. Leave it to dry.
If your item looks a bit out of whack and isn’t really dirty, check the yarn care instruc-
tions, then go ahead and block it. Items that may require blocking include any gar-
ments, including hats that sometimes need to be reshaped, and thread crochet items
such as doilies and table runners. But keep in mind that any crocheted piece that
looks a bit out of shape can usually, but not always, be fixed by blocking.
205
Chapter 16: Ten-Plus Tips for Caring for Your Crochet

Blocking a piece made of thread crochet involves a few more steps:
1. Hand wash the design gently in cold water with mild soap, rinsing several
times to remove all the soap residue.
2. In a separate clean tub, prepare a liquid starch solution according to the
directions on the bottle based on the desired amount of stiffness for the fin-
ished piece.
3. Immerse the crocheted piece in the solution and allow the solution to com-
pletely penetrate the fabric.
4. Prepare a blocking surface large enough to accommodate the design, such as
a plastic-wrapped piece of cardboard or foam board.
5. Remove the item from the solution and blot it dry with a clean towel to
remove any extra solution.
6. Using rustproof straight pins, pin the design onto the blocking board to the
required dimensions, taking care to shape any stitch patterns.
7. Blot the design again to remove any excess solution that may still remain.
8. Allow the piece to dry completely before removing the pins.
Take It to the Cleaners
This may be the easiest way of all to clean your crochet (but it may not be the cheap-
est). If the yarn label says “Dry clean only,” then by all means, take the item to the
cleaners. A word of advice, though: Bring the label (or a copy of the label) to the clean-
ers with you. That way they’ll know what material they’re working with and can use
the appropriate chemicals.
Get a Load of This: Machine Washing
In some cases, it’s perfectly fine to throw your crocheted masterpieces in the washing
machine. This holds true for items made from synthetic yarns, such as acrylic, which
won’t sustain so much damage from the washing machine. Use the delicate cycle and,
if size permits, throw the item into a mesh laundry bag. Be sure to check the yarn label
for the correct water temperature settings.
It’s always a safe bet to wash these items alone the first time around, just to make sure
the colors won’t bleed into the rest of your laundry. If you’re not sure what the correct
water temperature should be, opt for the safe route and use the cool water setting.
Let It Go for a Spin: Machine Drying
Sometimes tossing your afghan, scarf, or other piece of handiwork in the dryer is just
fine. Again, check the yarn label to make sure it’s okay. Most synthetic yarns will take a
low heat setting unless it’s got some funky stuff attached like sequins or mirrors. Add
some smooth-textured items like pillowcases to the dryer to help absorb moisture.
206
Part IV: The Part of Tens 

Don’t machine dry wool — it will shrink! Find a spot large enough to accommodate the
piece and lay it out flat, shape it if necessary, and allow to dry, preferably in a place
that is out of direct sunlight and won’t be disturbed by playful pets.
Iron It — but Only If You Must
If you feel that you need to add some heat to an item to get all the wrinkles out, set the
iron on the lowest heat setting suggested for the yarn. Place a slightly damp cloth,
such as a clean cotton dish towel, on top of your crocheted piece before ironing.
Never allow the iron to come into direct contact with the yarn. Excessive heat can ruin
the integrity of the yarn fibers, and even cotton thread can flatten out too much and
ruin the original look of the design.
Put Those Hangers Away!
By all means, use and enjoy your crochet. That’s why you made it. But when you’re not
using the item, whether it’s a sweater or tablecloth or anything in between, never, ever,
ever hang crocheted items. Hanging stretches out the stitches, and the damage can’t
be reversed.
 For garments, find a spot to lay them flat with as few folds as possible. If this
means you have to rearrange your closet or drawers, go ahead and do it.
 For items such as tablecloths, doilies, runners, and even afghans, roll them up
and store them that way to minimize creases and folds.
You’ve put in a lot of crochet time, so take the time to care for your pieces properly.
Dazzling Displays and Safe Storage
Home décor items are meant to be shown off, so go ahead and use them. If it’s a table
runner, then lay it out on the table. Afghans can be draped over the back of your
favorite chair or sofa, but be sure to keep them out of direct sunlight or extreme 
temperatures.
If items are to be stored for any length of time, such as holiday designs or winter
sweaters, invest in some acid-free tissue paper. Place the paper between the folds and
around the outside of the piece. This ensures that the piece stays clean and dust free,
and helps preserve the yarn fibers until you bring it out again.
Always put your items away clean. Time in storage allows stains to set, and you may
not be able to get them out a year later.
To avoid pulling out pieces that the moths have dined on (especially wool items),
place these items in a plastic storage bin with a couple of cedar blocks and store the
bin in a cool, dry place.

Chapter 16: Ten-Plus Tips for Caring for Your Crochet

Get Rid of Those Pesky Pills
It’s inevitable — where there’s yarn there’s pills, those unsightly little balls that pop up
on fabric after laundering or from normal wear and tear. Removing the pills can revital-
ize your crocheted pieces and make them look like new again.
You can get rid of pills two ways:
 By using a sweater stone: This is the recommended preference because it is gen-
tler on the fabric and you have more control over it.
 By using a sweater shaver: These devices are typically battery operated or elec-
tric, and if you don’t use them properly, you can put holes in your item.
To use a sweater stone properly:
1. Lay the item on a flat surface.
2. Hold the stone in the palm of your hand and gently brush the fabric in smooth
short strokes.
The stone will crumble a bit, but don’t worry, this is normal and won’t damage your
piece. Gently shake the item or use a lint roller to remove these tiny pieces.
Never, ever try to remove pilling with scissors! Remember that crochet is a series of
interlocking loops, and if you inadvertently slip and cut even one of the strands of
yarn, your whole piece can unravel.

T
his chapter is all about getting the younger set involved. Crochet is hot, and if you can
get the kids involved, you just may be starting them on the road to a lifelong affair with
a hook and some yarn. If they show an interest, and their motor skills are fairly well devel-
oped, no age is too young to start. I started at about 8 years old and got my daughter cro-
cheting when she was about 9. Your kids should be able to read so they can follow a pattern
themselves.
The designs featured here are all about giving novice crocheters the opportunity to create
something fairly quickly, using basic stitches and techniques. I collaborated with my daugh-
ter (who’s 11 going on 21!) to come up with many of these designs, from the idea itself to
color and stitch choices. You can use this chapter to teach crocheting basics to anyone you
know who’s old enough to handle a hook and yarn. Browse through the pages, pick a project,
and get crocheting.
Blue Note Scarf
Accessories are in, and scarves are no exception. This one is really long and skinny, so you can
wrap it around and around your neck or style it any way you choose. It’s a perfect design to
practice making single crochet stitches. The yarn used is lightly textured and self-striping,
which means you end up with a cool, funky design without changing colors. Because of the
nature of the yarn, each scarf has a slightly different pattern, each one unique (see Figure 17-1).

striping blue

be wide, but
it’s long —

Materials and vital statistics
 Yarn: Bernat “Super Stripes” bulky-weight yarn (97% acrylic/3% polyester), Article
#161069 (3.5 oz. [100 g], 182 yds [166 m] each skein): 1 skein of #69742 B & Blue
 Hook: Crochet hook size H-8 U.S. or size needed to obtain gauge
 Measurements: 3 in. wide x 83 in. long
 Gauge: 12 sc = 4 in.; 3 rows = 1 in.
 Stitches used: Chain stitch (ch), single crochet (sc)
This scarf is worked lengthwise in long rows, instead of side to side in shorter rows. You
crochet a really long foundation chain, then work just nine more rows, and you’re done.
Directions
Foundation chain: Ch 251.
Row 1: Sc in 2nd ch from hook, sc in each ch across (250 sc), turn.
Rows 2–9: Ch 1, sc in each sc across (250 sc), turn. Fasten off.
Wear Your Heart Pin
This pin is super-easy and fast to make (see Figure 17-2). It’s one of those designs that
you can sit down and make several of them in an evening — then hand out to your
friends the next day. The heart is made using wool yarn and some simple increasing
and decreasing to get the shape. Throw it in the washer and dryer to felt (make the
yarn fibers mat together and shrink), then sew on the pin back. Pin it to a jacket, hat,
or even your backpack. It’s a fun and versatile accessory.

 Hook: Crochet hook size H-8 U.S. or size needed to obtain gauge
 Pin back
 Sewing needle and matching sewing thread
 Measurements: 4 in. wide x 41⁄2 in. long before felting. Heart will shrink during
felting process. The one shown here measured 31⁄4 in. wide x about 4 in. long after
felting.
 Gauge: 14 sts = 4 in; 16 rows = 4 in.
 Stitches used: Chain stitch (ch), single crochet (sc). Dec 1 sc: • (Insert hook 
in next st, yo, draw yarn through st) twice, yo, draw yarn through 3 loops on
hook •. Dec 2 sc: • (Insert hook in next st, yo, draw yarn through st) 3 times, yo,
draw yarn through 4 loops on hook •.
This is a great project to crochet to get comfortable with shaping a piece using both
increasing and decreasing. You start off with just one single crochet stitch at the base
of the heart, then gradually increase your stitches until the project reaches the desired
width. Each side of the top of the heart is crocheted separately, and they are created
by decreasing the stitches to form the rounded tops.

Fusing the stitches and finishing
Felting is what happens to wool fibers when they’re exposed to hot water and friction.
The stitches fuse into a densely woven fabric that is extremely durable but still soft to
the touch. Additionally, the fabric shrinks during this process. The amount of shrink-
age that occurs varies according to the amount of agitation and the heat of the water,
so no two pieces come out exactly the same.
Start by putting the piece in the washing machine with the appropriate amount of
detergent for the size of the load you are running, and use the hot or warm wash/cool
rinse cycle. Because this piece is so small, you can throw it in with other items. Just
make sure they can be washed in hot water and are of like colors (a few towels work
well) because the dye in the yarn may run. The yarn shouldn’t shed, but you never
know, so don’t throw any good items in with this at first.
It’s a good idea to check your piece periodically (about half way through, then again
before the end of the cycle) to make sure it’s not felting too much. (To check the piece,
stop the washer and wait for everything to stop moving before you reach into the
machine.) If, at the end of the complete wash cycle, you want a more felted look, just
run the piece through again.
You can also felt it even more in the dryer. Put the item in the dryer on the regular set-
ting, and run the dryer until the piece is almost dry. While it’s still damp, lay it flat,
adjust into the proper shape, and allow the piece to finish air drying. If your piece is
felted to your satisfaction when it comes out of the washing machine, you can let it air
dry completely. Lay the piece on a flat surface and shape to dry.
Don’t forget to check the piece during the felting process. After the fibers are fused,
you can’t undo it.
Assembly
When the piece is dry, using the sewing needle and thread, sew the pin back to the
center back of the heart.

MP3 Player Cover
Everyone seems to have an MP3 player today, and I have to say, it sure makes it easy
to take your music with you. To reduce the risk of scratching the player, it’s a good
idea to protect it with a cover. Why buy one when you can make your own? This
design gives you a stylish way to protect your music and show off your skills (see
Figure 17-3). Plus, there’s a pocket built right in where you can store your earphones
when you’re not using them.
Materials and vital statistics
 Yarn: Bernat “Cool Crochet” light-weight yarn (70% cotton/30% nylon), Article

Neopolitan Shades
 Hook: Crochet hook size G-6 U.S. or size needed to obtain gauge
 3⁄16 in. hole punch
 21⁄2 x 4 in. piece of 16-gauge clear vinyl

 Tapestry needle
 Measurements: 3 in. wide x 4 in. long
 Gauge: 11 sts and 11 rows = 2 in.
 Stitches used: Slip stitch (sl st), single crochet (sc)
To crochet this cover, you start by working your initial round of stitches right into the
holes you punch in the vinyl cover, instead of creating a foundation chain. You work
several rounds to create a border around the front, then begin to work in rows to cro-
chet the back and the pocket. When you’ve completed all the crocheting, you then sew
the back to the front to finish the cover.

With right sides facing, fold the back up toward the top of the front. With tapestry
needle and 18-in. length of yarn, matching sts across sides, working through sides and
pocket, sew sides of body together. Turn right side out.
Beadies Can-Cozy
Use this neat little beadies can-cozy (see Figure 17-5) to keep those sweating soft-drink
cans from slipping out of your hand and to help keep them cold. Yarn may seem like an
odd choice to use for a can-cozy, but it works. The yarn used in this project makes it
look like you’ve got your own designer, beaded cozy. If you don’t want to use the cozy
to slip onto a can, it also makes a great pencil holder!

To make this can-cozy, you start with a flat base, then work in a spiral to create a tube
to slip your can into. Working in a spiral is easy — all you do is work in rounds, but
instead of joining each round, you start the next round when you reach the end of the
current round, thus eliminating seams.
Directions
The bottom of the can cozy is flat. To crochet this, you start with a small circle, then
increase your stitches in each subsequent round until the proper dimension is reached.

Page Runner
Okay, so “page runner” is just a fancy name for a bookmark, but this project looks like
a runner you’d see on the floor in the hallway (see Figure 17-6). Simple stitches with
some fringe added at the ends make for a unique look. These quick designs would be
great projects for the school book fair or to sell at a fund-raiser.

This project is a great example of a repeating pattern. Four rows are worked over and
over again to create the pattern, which is shown in the stitch diagram, Figure 17-7. It’s
a basic repeat as far as stitch patterns go, and this project is a wonderful opportunity
to introduce stitch diagrams to a beginning crocheter.
Directions
Foundation chain: Ch 9.
Row 1 (wrong side): Sc in 2nd ch from hook, sc in each ch across (8 sc), turn.
Row 2: Ch 5 (first dtr), dtr in each sc across (8 dtr), turn.
Rows 3–5: Ch 1, sc in each st across (8 sc), turn.
Rows 6–25: Rep Rows 2-5 (5 times).
Row 26: Rep Row 2.
Row 27: Ch 1, sc in each dtr across (8 sc). Fasten off.
Finishing: To make the fringe, cut yarn into 16 4-in. lengths. Using 1 strand of yarn for
each fringe, single-knot one fringe in each stitch across each short edge of bookmark.
Trim ends even.
Camouflage Belt
I dare you to try and find a preteen, tween, or teen who doesn’t have at least one cam-
ouflage item in her wardrobe. Even adults are wearing it. This belt (see Figure 17-8) is
perfect for adding a touch of camouflage to your outfit. If your favorite camouflage
pants or that great camo T-shirt is still in the laundry, throw this belt on with a pair of
jeans. Simple stitches and a D-ring belt buckle are all it takes to create this great fashion
accessory.

Crocheting doesn’t get a whole lot easier than this. This project uses a basic stitch pat-
tern that’s really versatile, and it creates a flexible fabric without being too bulky —
ideal for around your waist. The single crochet stitches are worked into the chain
spaces of the previous row, and the chain spaces are created over the single crochet
stitches, which alternate in each row.

Chocolate Lace Headband
The design for this lace headband (see Figure 17-9) not only provides a great hair
accessory, but also gives you the opportunity to practice a simple yet common stitch
pattern. Brown seems to be the color of choice these days, but as always, you can
choose another color (or several others) to suit your taste.

Chain-Link Bracelet
A girl can never have enough accessories, and with this easy pattern, you can make as
many bracelets as you can fit on your arms. This design can be crocheted in less than
an hour, so you can make dozens in no time at all. This bracelet features three wire
chains held together with a jump ring and spring ring clasp (see Figure 17-10), but feel
free to branch out on your own. It would look equally as good with just one chain or
several, whatever suits your taste.

This bracelet is just a bunch of chains, but what makes it unique is the material it’s
crocheted from. Wire crocheted jewelry is everywhere. But don’t be intimidated by the
wire — it’s almost easier to use than yarn. It tends to be a bit slippery, so you may
have to work a little slower, and be sure not to pull your stitches too tight. You want to
leave them loose so you can see the individual stitches.

Variation: Making matching pieces
To make a matching necklace, follow the instructions above, but make your chains
longer, anywhere from 16 in. to 20 in. or more, whatever length you desire.
To crochet matching earrings, follow the instructions above, but make your chains
much shorter, about 10 chain stitches for a small hoop, 12–15 stitches for larger
hoops. Attach the wire ends to the earring post of your choice.

Beaded Anklet
Here’s a piece of jewelry that’s been around for many years. Anklets can be rather
formal, made with gold or silver and jewels, or casual, as this one is. The yarn used is
studded with beads, and the color reminds me of the always popular hemp jewelry (see
Figure 17-12). Crochet a couple rows, attach a clasp, and fasten around your ankle.

Appendix A
Crochet Stitches
E
ven if you’re familiar with how to make most crochet stitches, it never hurts to have a
reference. Almost all of the stitches that you’ll come across in your day-to-day crochet-
ing can be found here, along with illustrations and step-by-step instructions. The stitches
are in relative order beginning with the easiest and moving forward from there. After the
basic stitches, you’ll find some of the more common stitch combinations, as well as a few
miscellaneous items such as sewing techniques and embellishments.
I include a few of the unique or more complex stitches as new skills in the chapters in which
they are used. So if you’re looking for instructions on how to do one of the following stitches,
you need to flip to the chapter indicated:
 The loop stitch: Chapter 11
 The afghan stitch: Chapter 13
 The Tunisian knit stitch: Chapter 13
 Filet crochet stitches (spaces, blocks, lacets, and bars): Chapter 13
Slipknot
Before you can do anything, you first have to join the yarn to the hook. This is accomplished
by making a slipknot.
1. Starting about 6 inches from the end of the yarn, make a loop that looks somewhat
like a pretzel.
2. Insert your hook through the center of the loop (see Figure A-1) and draw the work-
ing end of the yarn through.
3. Gently tug on both ends of the yarn to tighten the loop around your hook (see
Figure A-2).
Figure A-1:
Drawing
the yarn
through
the loop.

Chain Stitch (ch)
I can’t think of a single crocheted piece that doesn’t start with at least one chain stitch.
This stitch forms the base that you work all your stitches off of, whether it’s a founda-
tion chain or a center ring.
1. Slide a slipknot onto the shaft of your hook.
2. Yarn over (yo) your hook.
3. Draw the yarn through the loop on your hook to make the first chain stitch
(see Figure A-3).
4. Repeat Steps 2 and 3 for the required number of stitches (see Figure A-4),
holding the chain close to your hook as it grows for better control.

Slip Stitch (sl st)
This is a handy little stitch that you can use for lots of reasons. It’s used for fastening
off, traveling from one place to the next when you don’t want your stitches visible,
joining seams, or creating a nice smooth edge, just to name a few. It has next to no
height and lays relatively flat. It’s easier to work the slip stitch on an established row,
so to practice this stitch, make a swatch using double crochet stitches 16 stitches long
and several rows deep.
1. Insert your hook in the next stitch (see Figure A-5).
2. Yarn over (yo) your hook.
3. Draw the yarn through the stitch and through the loop on your hook (see
Figure A-6).
4. Repeat Steps 1 through 3 for the required number of stitches (see Figure A-7).

Appendix A: Crochet Stitches

Single Crochet Stitch (sc)
This stitch is the most elementary of all stitches, and you’ll use it a lot. It’s compact
and creates a nice tight fabric. It’s often used alone, but in many cases it works well in
combination with other stitches.
1. Insert your hook in the 2nd chain stitch from your hook (see Figure A-8).
2. Yarn over (yo) your hook, and draw the yarn through the stitch (see Figure A-9).
3. Yarn over, and draw the yarn through the 2 loops on your hook (see
Figure A-10).
4. Insert your hook in the next stitch, then repeat from Step 2 for the required
number of stitches.
Double Crochet Stitch (dc)
The double crochet stitch is another stitch that you’ll use all the time. It’s about twice
as tall as the single crochet stitch and creates a fairly solid — but not stiff — fabric. It’s
used alone and in combination with other stitches.

1. Yarn over (yo) your hook, and insert your hook in the 4th chain from your
hook (see Figure A-11a).
2. Yarn over, and draw the yarn through the stitch (see Figure A-11b).
3. Yarn over, and draw the yarn through 2 loops on your hook (see 
Figure A-12a).
4. Yarn over, and draw the yarn through the remaining 2 loops on your hook 
(A-12b).
5. Yarn over, and insert your hook in the next stitch, repeating from Step 2 for
the required number of stitches.
Triple Crochet Stitch (tr)
The triple crochet stitch is similar to the double crochet but is slightly taller. It creates
a loose, open fabric with longer openings between each stitch. You often use the triple
crochet in combination with other stitches to create interesting textures and patterns.
1. Yarn over (yo) twice, and insert your hook in the 5th chain from your hook
(see Figure A-13a).

3. Yarn over, and draw the yarn through 2 loops on your hook (see Figure A-14a).
4. Yarn over, and draw the yarn through 2 loops on your hook (see 
Figure A-14b).
5. Yarn over, and draw the yarn through the last 2 loops on your hook
(see Figure A-15a).
One triple crochet stitch is now complete (see Figure A-15b).
6. Yarn over twice, and insert your hook in the next stitch, repeating from Step 2
for the required number of stitches.
Double Triple Crochet (dtr)
This stitch is yet again a little bit taller than the triple crochet, and is often used in
combinations with other stitches to create a lacy pattern. The fabric itself is loose and
holey, and you commonly see it used in thread crochet designs.
1. Yarn over (yo) 3 times, and insert your hook in the next stitch (see 
Figure A-16).

2. Yarn over, and draw the yarn through the stitch.
You should now have 5 loops on your hook.
3. Yarn over, and draw your yarn through the first 2 loops on your hook (4 loops
remain).
4. Repeat Step 3 three more times until you have only 1 loop on your hook.
One double triple crochet stitch is complete (see Figure A-17).
Half Double Crochet Stitch (hdc)
The half double crochet stitch is a funny kind of in-between stitch. You start out as you
would for a double crochet stitch and finish like a single crochet stitch. It’s like a fatter
version of the single crochet, with a height somewhere between the single and double
crochet.
1. Yarn over (yo), and insert your hook in the 3rd chain from your hook (see
Figure A-18a).
2. Yarn over, and draw the yarn through the stitch (see Figure A-18b).
3. Yarn over, and draw the yarn through the 3 loops on your hook (see 
Figure A-19a).

Decrease 1 Single Crochet Stitch (dec 1 sc)
Decreasing stitches is an integral part of crochet. It’s not difficult; you just have a few
simple steps to follow. To shape any design, whether working in rows or rounds, you
need to know how to work this two-part process of turning two stitches into one.
1. Insert your hook into the next stitch.
2. Yarn over (yo), and draw the yarn through the stitch, leaving 2 loops on
your hook.
3. With the 2 loops still on your hook, insert your hook into the next stitch
(see Figure A-20).
4. Yarn over, and draw the yarn through the stitch.
5. Yarn over, and draw the yarn through all 3 loops on your hook (see Figure 
A-21a).
You’ve made one single crochet decrease, as shown in Figure A-21b.

Decrease 1 Double Crochet Stitch (dec 1 dc)
Making a double crochet decrease is second only in frequency of use to the single cro-
chet decrease. It’s worked in a similar manner, but because of the extra loops you have
an extra step.
1. Yarn over (yo), and insert your hook into the next stitch.
2. Yarn over, and draw the yarn through the stitch.
3. Yarn over, and draw the yarn through the first 2 loops on the hook (see 
Figure A-22).
4. With 2 loops still on your hook, yarn over, and insert your hook into the next
stitch (see Figure A-23).
5. Yarn over, and draw the yarn through the stitch.
6. Yarn over, and draw the yarn through the first 2 loops on the hook (3 loops
remain).
7. Yarn over, and draw the yarn through all 3 loops on the hook (see 
Figure A-24a).
One double crochet decrease is now complete (see Figure A-24b).

Appendix A: Crochet Stitches

V-stitch
The V-stitch is an extremely easy and versatile stitch combination. It’s typically com-
prised of two double crochet stitches and a chain stitch worked together all in the
same stitch with the results forming a V.
Work 1 double crochet stitch, chain 1, then work another double crochet
stitch (dc, ch1, dc) all in the same stitch (see Figure A-25).
Crossed Double Crochet Stitch
To create this pattern that looks like a bunch of X’s marching across your fabric, you
work two double crochet stitches on an angle. That’s not as hard as it may sound —
you simply skip stitches so you’re not working in the stitch directly below.
1. Skip the next stitch in the row.
2. Work 1 double crochet in the next stitch.
3. Working behind the double crochet stitch you just made, work 1 double cro-
chet into the skipped stitch (see Figure A-26a).
Figure A-26b shows the completed crossed double crochet stitch.
4. Repeat Steps 1 through 3 for the required number of stitches.

Shell Stitch
This is another one of those stitch combinations that you’ll see everywhere. The
shape of the shell stitch resembles a clam shell, and the stitch can be used to create
either a very tight fabric, or when worked in combination with other stitches, a loose
and airy pattern. The illustration here shows a shell made with four double crochet
stitches, but variations of the stitch can use any number.
Work 4 double crochet stitches all in the same stitch, as shown in Figure A-27.
Picot
These pretty little knobs add a decorative touch to edgings and are often used to fill in
an empty space. The picot stitch is most often seen in thread crochet, but there’s no
reason why it can’t be worked with yarn as well.
1. Chain 3.
2. Insert your hook into the third chain from the hook (see Figure A-28a).

3. Yarn over (yo), and draw the yarn through the stitch and through the loop on
the hook (see Figure A-28b).
One picot stitch is now complete, as shown in Figure A-29.
Cluster Stitch
The cluster stitch is the opposite of the shell stitch, forming a shape that resembles an
upside-down shell stitch or a triangle. To create a cluster, you work a set of stitches
across an equal number stitches, then join them all together at the top. The technique
is the same as a decrease; you’re just working a few more stitches than two. When join-
ing several stitches together at the top like this, and you don’t complete each stitch
until you’re done, the stitches are referred to as half-closed because you haven’t com-
pleted them yet. The following example details how to make a cluster of four double
crochet stitches.
1. Yarn over (yo), insert the hook into the next stitch, yarn over, draw the yarn
through the stitch, yarn over, and draw the yarn through 2 loops on the hook
(2 loops remain on the hook).
2. Repeat Step 1 three times (see Figure A-30a).
3. Yarn over, and draw the yarn through all 5 loops on the hook (see 
Figure A-30b).
One 4–double crochet cluster stitch is complete, as shown in Figure A-31.

Reverse Single Crochet Stitch (reverse sc)
The reverse single crochet stitch, sometimes referred to as the crab stitch, creates a
rounded twisted edge and is used only to make a finished edging for your piece. You’ll
never see it in the middle of your work. The mechanics are the same as for a single cro-
chet stitch, except you work in reverse. Instead of working from right to left, you work
from left to right.
1. With the right side of your work facing, insert the hook, from the front to the
back, in the next stitch to the right (see Figure A-32a).
2. Yarn over (yo), and draw the yarn through the stitch (see Figure A-32b).
3. Yarn over, and draw the yarn through the 2 loops on the hook (see 
Figure A-33a).
4. Repeat Steps 1 through 3 for the required number of stitches.

Appendix A: Crochet Stitches

Puff Stitch
This is one of the stitches in the family of oval combination stitches that gently puffs
to create texture. The puff stitch is similar to the cluster stitch in construction — you
combine several half-closed stitches together. The difference here is that the stitches
are all worked in the same stitch as opposed to being worked across several stitches.
To create a 3–double crochet puff stitch, follow these steps:
1. Yarn over (yo), insert the hook in the designated stitch, yarn over, draw the
yarn through the stitch, yarn over, and draw the yarn through the 2 loops on
the hook (see Figure A-34a).
2. In the same stitch, repeat Step 1 twice.
You should now have 4 loops on your hook.
3. Yarn over, and draw the yarn through all 4 loops on your hook, as shown in
Figure A-34b.
Figure A-35 shows the completed 3–double crochet puff stitch.
Popcorn Stitch (pop or pc)
The popcorn stitch is the second stitch in the family of ovals. This one really stands
out from the fabric — it’s a rounded, compact oval that you can make so it “pops”
either to the front of your work or the back. It takes a little more time to make this
stitch, but the results are well worth it.
To make a popcorn stitch that pops to the front of your work, follow these steps:
1. Work 5 double crochet stitches in the same stitch.
2. Drop the loop from your hook.

crochet of the group.
4. Grab the dropped loop with your hook and pull it through the stitch (refer to
Figure A-36a).
Figure A-36b shows the finished popcorn stitch popping to the front.
To make a popcorn stitch “pop” to the back of your work:
1. Work 5 double crochet stitches in the same stitch.
2. Drop the loop from your hook.
3. Insert your hook from back to front under the top 2 loops of the first double
crochet of the group.

Appendix A: Crochet Stitches

Bobble Stitch
This is the last in the family of oval stitches. The bobble stitch is worked a bit differ-
ently from the others in that it’s made using a series of loops rather than stitches. It
creates a smoother surface and is best worked with heavier-weight yarns. These steps
show you how to make a bobble stitch that ends up with 11 loops on the hook, but as
always, there are variations, so be sure to read the special stitch instructions given at
the beginning of each pattern.
1. Yarn over (yo), and insert the hook into the designated stitch (see 
Figure A-38a).
2. Yarn over, and draw the yarn through the stitch, bringing the loop up to the
height of the previous stitch (3 loops on hook — see Figure A-38b).
3. Working in the same stitch, repeat Steps 1 and 2 four times (11 loops on hook).
4. Yarn over, and draw the yarn through all 11 loops on hook as shown in 
Figure A-39a.
One bobble stitch is complete (see Figure A-39b).
Front Post Double Crochet (FPdc)
Sometimes you don’t work stitches into the tops of the stitches in the previous row,
but rather you find another place to stick your hook. The front post double crochet
stitch is one of those instances. The stitch itself is a plain old double crochet stitch,

but instead of working it in the top of a stitch, you work it around the post (or body) of
the stitch in the previous row. This causes the stitch to stand out and is used to create
cable patterns, ribbing, and others relief designs.
1. Yarn over (yo), and insert your hook from front to back between the posts of the
first and second double crochet of the row below and then from back to front
again between the posts of the second and third stitches (see Figure A-40a).
Figure A-40b shows the correct positioning of the hook.
2. Yarn over, and draw the yarn around the post of the stitch.
3. Yarn over, and draw the yarn through the 2 loops on the hook, twice, as
shown in Figure A-41a.

Back Post Double Crochet Stitch (BPdc)
The back post double crochet stitch looks exactly the same as the front post double
crochet, but it’s raised to the back side of the fabric. When looking at it from the right
side, it appears to recede.
1. Yarn over (yo), and insert your hook from back to front between the posts of the
first and second double crochet of the row below and then from front to back
again between the posts of the second and third stitches (see Figure A-42a).
Figure A-42b shows the correct positioning of the hook.
2. Yarn over, and draw the yarn around the post of the stitch.

Long (Spike) Stitch
Long stitches, or spikes as they’re sometimes called, are stitches that you work into
spaces or stitches two or more rows below the current row you’re working on.
Typically, they’re single crochet stitches, and they create a long vertical spike of yarn
on both sides of the fabric. This is especially nice if you’re working on a project that’s
reversible. When done in a contrasting color, they really stand out.
1. Insert the hook from front to back under the top 2 loops of the designated
stitch one or more rows below (see Figure A-44).
2. Draw the yarn through the stitch and up to the current level of work, keeping
the stitch loose enough so it doesn’t pucker the fabric.
3. Yarn over (yo), and draw the yarn through the 2 loops on your hook.
One long stitch is complete, as shown in Figure A-45.

Fringe
There are times when a pattern just doesn’t look complete without the addition of a
little extra something across the edges. A nice full fringe usually does the trick, and it
also hides row ends, which aren’t always so pretty.
1. Cut the yarn into the required number of equal lengths.
2. Fold the strands of yarn for one fringe in half, forming a loop at one end and
matching the cut ends of the yarn on the other end.
3. Working from the right side of the fabric, take your hook and draw the loop
through the stitch that you’re attaching the fringe to (see Figure A-46a).
4. Draw the loose ends of the yarn through the loop (see Figure A-46b).
5. Holding the top of the fringe in one hand, gently pull on the fringe ends with

Tassels
Tassels add a decorative touch to particular spots on a design, such as the top of a hat
or the points of a shawl. Instead of working them directly onto the crocheted piece,
you make tassels separately and then attach them to the specified points.
1. Cut a piece of cardboard the same width as your desired tassel length.
2. Wrap the yarn several times around the cardboard.
3. Slip a separate length of yarn between the cardboard and the wrapped yarn,
and tie the yarn bundle together at one end (see Figure A-48).
4. Slide the bundle of yarn off the cardboard.
5. Wrap another length of yarn 2 or 3 times around the bundle below the tied
end and tie in a knot to secure (see Figure A-49).
6. Cut the loops on the opposite end of the bundle from the tied end.
7. Trim the ends of the tassel so they’re even.
8. Using the top tie’s remaining yarn length, attach the tassel to the
designated spot.

Appendix A: Crochet Stitches

Whipstitch
Whipstitch is the all-purpose stitch that’s used when sewing project pieces together,
such as side seams, shoulder seams, and motifs. It works best with the shorter crochet
stitches — single crochet, half double crochet, and double crochet. Sometimes you
sew the row-end stitches together, and sometimes you join the tops of stitches. Either
way, the key to sewing a successful seam is to match up the stitches on each side of
the seam, making sure not to pull too tightly.
1. Position the pieces with the right sides (or wrong sides, depending on what
the pattern says) facing each other. Match the stitches across each side edge.
2. Using a yarn needle and matching yarn, weave the yarn back and forth
through several stitches on one of the pieces to secure the end.
3. Insert the needle and pull the yarn through the inside loops of the first 2 cor-
responding stitches of the 2 pieces to be joined.
4. Draw the needle up and over the 2 loops of the first stitch.
5. Repeat Steps 3 and 4 across the edges to be joined (see Figure A-50).
6. At the end of the seam, weave the yarn back through several stitches to
secure.
Blanket Stitch
This is another stitch used to join seams, particularly longer stitches like the triple
crochet and taller. When sewing seams with this stitch, you always join the row-end
stitches at the top and the base, which adds stability and helps to prevent gaping.
1. With the correct sides facing each other (right side/wrong side, depending
on the pattern), lay the pieces of fabric on a flat, smooth surface and align the
edges and stitches.
2. Using a yarn needle and matching yarn, thread the yarn through the base of
the first few corresponding stitches, leaving a yarn length to weave in later to
secure the seam.
3. Lay the working end of the yarn against the fabric in the direction of the
stitches, as shown in Figure A-51.

a seam
using the
whipstitch.

Part V: Appendixes 

4. Thread your yarn through the base of the next 2 corresponding stitches,
making sure that the working end of the yarn is underneath the needle.
5. Repeat Steps 3 and 4 across the edges to be joined.
6. At the end of the seam, weave the yarn back through several stitches to
secure.

This flirty denim-like skirt can go from school to a night out at the movies. 
Chapter 7 has all the details. The felted heart pin, crocheted separately, 
can be attached to a jacket, sweater, or even your backpack, while the 
beaded anklet is a fast and fun accessory to stitch. Find the designs for 
both in Chapter 17. The luggage tag will make your bag stand out from 
everyone else’s. Find the directions in Chapter 15.
Bags are something a woman can never have enough of, and these three fulfill every need. Learn new techniques, 
such as felting, by crocheting the pink-striped tote, featured in Chapter 14, and the Tunisian afghan stitch as shown 
in the blue tweed bag in Chapter 13. The small pink suede pocket purse works up in an evening; you can find the 
pattern in Chapter 17.
The springtime pullover, found in Chapter 12, is just what you need for cooler days. It’s crocheted 
using a simple stitch pattern that creates a flexible but non-see-through fabric. You embellish the 
sweater with beads along the bottom edge and sleeves. Grab this self-striping drawstring bag, 
featured in Chapter 7, to hold your belongings, and off you go (pin optional).
Pick a scarf, any scarf. The curlicue scarf is made by increasing stitches, which causes the length to curl, 
as the pattern in Chapter 6 describes. For a bold splash of black and white, crochet this textured scarf 
using only single crochet stitches; the yarn does the work for you. See Chapter 5 for the pattern. Set the 
mood with this unique black-and-blue scarf. It’s really long, and no two will come out exactly the same
due to the self-striping yarn used. Flip to Chapter 17 for instructions.

A belt for every reason: Wear the beads-’n’-bows belt (top) around your waist or on 
your hips for a feminine touch; the pattern is in Chapter 9. Pair the beaded-fringe 
belt (middle) with your favorite jeans and T-shirt; it’s featured in Chapter 6. The 
white belt, made from crossed double crochet stitches, goes with everything; whip 
this up from the pattern in Chapter 11.
This casual open-front vest is great for when it’s a little cool outside but you don’t 
need a full coat. The stitches and the shaping are easy; check out the pattern in 
Chapter 10.
 
Casual warmth describes this oversized shawl crocheted with a soft bouclé yarn. 
Start with a single stitch and increase your way up to the final width, and then add 
the edging with a contrasting color. Find this pattern in Chapter 6.

Fun and funky describes this wire-’n’-beads necklace. Pair it with the 
wire chain-link bracelet, and you’ve got a set no one else will be wearing. 
Find the necklace pattern in Chapter 14 and the wire bracelet pattern in 
Chapter 17.
Expand your stitch pattern knowledge while crocheting this stylish lacy bolero. 
You can find the pattern in Chapter 12.
Dress up a plain pair of jeans with this pocket patch for a fraction of the cost that you’d see in the stores. 
Crocheted with size 10 thread and basic square motifs, you can have a pair finished in no time. Turn to 
Chapter 15 for the instructions.
This unique scarf really brightens up a gloomy day. Crochet large loops to create the 
texture, and then add some pompoms for more fun. This pattern can be found in 
Chapter 11.

You can crochet countless items to use around the house. Some pictures 
deserve an extra-special frame, and this one made with fun fur yarn will 
do the trick, as found in Chapter 15. For the readers in your life, use filet 
crochet to create this one-of-a-kind bookmark. The instructions and chart 
are found in Chapter 13. So you know which drink is yours, mark your glass 
with this stemmed glass marker made from an earring hoop and crochet 
thread; see Chapter 15 for the instructions. The ever-useful basket is made 
with the untraditional crochet material, hemp cord; the instructions are 
in Chapter 14. Underneath it all is the diamond-shaped table runner. 
This design lets you hone your increasing and decreasing skills, so flip to 
Chapter 6 for instructions.
Add a bold splash of color and design to cocktail time. Each coaster in this set is worked 
from a chart, carrying the yarn as you go. Turn to Chapter 15 for the pattern.
With good music, your favorite book, and a cold drink, you’re set for a relaxing afternoon. Crochet 
this unique can-cozy by making a flat base and then working even in a spiral until the desired 
height is reached. The MP3 cover combines materials and stitch techniques to create a one-of-a-
kind cover that will stand out. Lavender yarn and long stitches make for a bookmark reminiscent of 
a floor runner. All three of these projects can be found in Chapter 17. The purple bookmark is made 
using size 10 crochet thread and a simple shell stitch pattern. Turn to Chapter 15 for the details.
These practical potholders are something you can never have too many 
of. Worked in single crochet to create a tight, sturdy fabric, they’re great 
for when you need to make something but don’t have a lot of time. See 
Chapter 5 for the pattern.

Show your love for baby by using filet crochet to make this 
heart valance to hang across the nursery windows. The pastel-
colored blanket, worked in basic afghan stitch, will keep baby 
warm. You can find both patterns in Chapter 13.
Throw this super-soft pillow on your bed or sofa to add a splash of color or texture; turn to Chapter 10 
for instructions. While resting your head, wrap yourself in this generously sized afghan for an extra 
dose of warmth; find the pattern in Chapter 5. And, not to leave out your feet, sink your toes into the 
softness of this striped throw rug made with chenille yarn; see Chapter 8 for the pattern.
Create your own crocheted bedding with this simple pillowcase edging 
using size 10 crochet thread. You can find the pattern along with the stitch 
diagram in Chapter 14. The chevron throw is made using a common wave 
stitch pattern and ultra-soft yarn. Find this pattern in Chapter 8.

Hats are a great way to practice crocheting in the round and shaping your designs. The two hats on the left are created from the identical pattern. A simple change in material and hook size creates 
different looks and sizes. You can find the instructions in Chapter 9. Adorn the hat with a crocheted rose, and you’ve got a whole new look. The pattern is in Chapter 15. The red velvet crusher hat 
involves increasing stitches and some more advanced shaping techniques, so turn to Chapter 7 for details. The denim cloche combines increasing stitches, shaping, color changes, and varying stitch 
patterns; find this design in Chapter 8. The striped scarf, also found in Chapter 8, uses a variety of textured yarns that makes the scarf look more complicated to stitch than it actually is. Crochet 
individual flowers with just two rounds to create the fun and funky flower-power belt; flip to Chapter 10 for the pattern.
You’ll find all the colors of the rainbow in this easy-to-crochet headband. Turn to 
Chapter 5 for this pattern, as well as instructions to create two additional headbands 
using different materials.
This classically styled newsboy beret is created by crocheting in the round, 
increasing and decreasing your stitches to create the shape; the pattern is 
in Chapter 7. Pair the beret with this nontraditional granny square scarf, 
and you’ve got a great combination. Turn to Chapter 14 for the pattern.

Dress it up or dress it down, this great little tank top goes anywhere. You crochet it with a basic 
shell stitch pattern and little shaping, so it’s a perfect choice for a starter garment. See Chapter 12 
for the pattern.
Wrap yourself in elegance with this sparkly, soft eve-
ning wrap. The yarn does all the work as you follow
