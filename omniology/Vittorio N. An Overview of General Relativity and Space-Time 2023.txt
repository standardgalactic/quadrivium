An Overview of 
General Relativity and 
Space-Time
This textbook equips Masters’ students studying Physics and Astronomy with the 
necessary mathematical tools to understand the basics of General Relativity and 
its applications. It begins by reviewing classical mechanics with a more geometri-
cally oriented language, continues with Special Relativity and, then onto a discus-
sion on the pseudo-Riemannian space-times. Applications span from the inner 
and outer Schwarzschild solutions to gravitational wave, black holes, spherical 
relativistic hydrodynamics, and Cosmology. The goal is to limit the abstract for-
malization of the problems, to favor a hands-on approach with a number of exer-
cises, without renouncing to a pedagogical derivation of the main mathematical 
tools and findings.

1 Space and Time: The
Classical View
1.1
INTRODUCTION
As it is well known, in Classical Mechanics space and time are two distinct cate-
gories. However, they share the same properties of homogeneity and isotropy. A pri-
ori, there are no special places where to be or special directions along which to move.
Likewise, there is no preferred time for an event to occur; if a system evolves through
a number of intermediate equilibrium states, it is always possible to go through the
same intermediate states, but in a reversed order. The goal of this chapter is to start
introducing some of the geometrical formalism used in the rest of the book, remain-
ing for the moment within the framework of Classical Mechanics.
1.2
METRIC SPACE
The position in space of a point P is completely deﬁned by its position vector, ⃗ℓ,
bound to the origin O of the chosen coordinate system.
⃗ℓ= ξ 1 ˆe1 +ξ 2 ˆe2 +ξ 3 ˆe3 =
3
∑
k=1
ξ k ˆek = ξ k ˆek
(1.1)
Here ξ k are the contravariant components of ⃗ℓ, whereas ˆek are the corresponding
covariant components of the basis vectors. By convention, the indexes of contravari-
ant and covariant components are shown as superscripts and subscripts, respectively.
The Einstein summation convention implies summing over any couple of repeated
(or dummy) indexes, provided that one of the two is contravariant and the other co-
variant [see Exercise A.1]. The last equality in Eq.(1.1) exploits this convention: we
omit the summation symbol and will assume hereafter that Latin indexes always run
from 1 to 3.
Now, consider two points, P and Q, of coordinates ξ k and ξ k +dξ k, respectively.
The inﬁnitesimal displacement vector d⃗ℓ, connecting Q to P, can be written in terms
of its contravariant components dξ k:
d⃗ℓ= dξ k ˆek
(1.2)
The distance between these two points is given by the magnitude of the displacement
vector. The corresponding squared quantity writes
dℓ2 = d⃗ℓ·d⃗ℓ= (dξ i ˆei)·(dξ j ˆej) = (ˆei · ˆej)dξ idξ j
(1.3)
where the symbol “·” indicates the dot or inner product of vectors. Eq.(1.3) can be
written in a more compact and elegant way:
dℓ2 = γijdξ idξ j

An Overview of General Relativity and Space-Time
after deﬁning the matrix
γij ≡ˆei · ˆej
(1.5)
Eq.(1.4) is a very important one. It deﬁnes the metric of the space. Once we know the
metric coefﬁcients [c.f. Eq.(1.5)], the line element dℓyields the relative distance of
two given points as a non-negative, real number. Remember that the vectors have an
absolute meaning, their magnitude and direction being independent from the chosen
coordinate system. On the contrary, the vector components do depend on the speciﬁc
coordinate system we are using. So, the lhs of Eq.(1.4) is an invariant, while the
explicit form of the rhs depends on the chosen coordinate system. Using orthonormal
(Cartesian) coordinates [ξ i ≡{x,y,z}] simpliﬁes things. In fact, in this case γi j = δi j,
and the line element can be written in its standard, well-known Euclidean form.
dℓ2 = dx2 +dy2 +dz2
(1.6)
If we had chosen cylindrical coordinates [ξ i ≡{r,θ,z}], we would have obtained
a different expression for the rhs of Eq.(1.6) [see Exercise A.2]. Hereafter, unless
otherwise speciﬁed, we will use a Cartesian coordinate system.
1.3
HOMOGENEITY AND ISOTROPY OF SPACE
Homogeneity
The space is homogeneous: according to the Copernican Principle, all positions must
be equivalent. This means that the choice of the origin of the coordinate system
shouldn’t matter. Consider two coordinate systems, K and K ′. The latter is ob-
tained by translating K
while keeping the orthonormal basis vectors parallel to
themselves. Given a point in space, its position vectors in K and K ′ are then re-
lated:⃗ℓ=⃗ℓ′ + ⃗d, where ⃗d is the (constant) position vector of O′ w.r.t. K [see Figure
1.1a]. Clearly, the metric remains unchanged by such a translation. In fact, the ba-
sis vectors in K and K ′ have the same orientation. It follows that dξ i = dξ ′i [c.f.
Eq.(1.2)] and γi j = γ ′i j [c.f. Eq.(1.5)]. Thus,
dℓ2 = γijdξ idξ j = γ′
mndξ ′mdξ ′n
(1.7)
As expected, the metric is invariant under a translation of the reference frame.
Isotropy
The space is also isotropic: there is no preferred direction in which to move, and
all the directions must be equivalent. This implies that the orientation in space of
the basis vectors shouldn’t matter. To see this point, consider again two different
coordinate systems, K
and K ′, the latter being obtained by rotating K
by an
angle φ around one of its basis vector. In this way K and K ′ have the same origin,
but different orientation of the coordinate axes [see Figure 1.1b]. In general terms,
we can write the orthogonal transformation that relates the new and old coordinates
as follows:
ξ k = Lk
m ξ ′m;
ξ ′m = Mmn ξ n;
(1.8)

Space and Time: The Classical View

Figure 1.1
Space homogeneity: the line element dℓis unaffected by a rigid translation of the
reference frame (left panel). Space isotropy: the line element dℓis unaffected by the orientation
of the coordinate axes (right panel).
Here ξ k and ξ ′m are the contravariant components of the position vector in K and
K ′, while
Lkm = ∂ξ k
∂ξ ′m ;
Mmn = ∂ξ ′m
∂ξ n
(1.9)
are the orthogonal rotation matrixes. It is important to realize that the transformations
of Eq.(1.8) are linear transformations, as both the rotation matrixes, M and L = M−1,
can be expressed in terms of a (constant) rotation angle, φ. If K ′ is obtained by a
rotation of K around its ξ 3-axis, then we can write
L ≡

(1.10)
describing clock-(L) and counterclock-(M) rotations, respectively [see Figure 1.1b].
Using Eq.(1.8), we can easily ﬁnd how the metric coefﬁcients transform under such
a rotation
dℓ2 = γi jdξ idξ j = γijLimdξ ′mL jndξ ′n = γ′
mndξ ′mdξ ′n
(1.11)
where
γ′
mn = γijLimL jn
(1.12)
This equation can be written in a compact way: γ′ = LTγγγ L. In the case of an or-
thonormal vector basis, γi j = δi j = γ′
ij as L is an orthogonal matrix. Eq.(1.11) shows
that, as expected, the metric is invariant under a rotation of the reference frame.

CONTRAVARIANT COMPONENTS: A FORMAL DEFINITION
A set of three quantities, V k (k = 1,3), are the contravariant components of a 3D vector
if they transform on a change of coordinates as in Eq.(1.8):
V k = LkmV ′m
V ′k = MkmV m
(1.13)
Let’s make a step further along the same line, by writing the displacement vector in
K and K ′, and by using the same notation of Eq.(1.8)
d⃗ℓ=

(1.14)
where, in the last equalities, we have found the transformation law of the basis vec-
tors.
ˆei = M ji ˆe′
j;
ˆe′
m = Lim ˆei;
(1.15)
We can use Eq.(1.15) to go beyond the simple case of the basis vectors and state the
following:
COVARIANT COMPONENTS: A FORMAL DEFINITION
A set of three quantities, Vk (k = 1,3), are the covariant components of a 3D vector if
they transform on a change of coordinates as in Eq.(1.15):
Vm = MkmV ′
k
V ′
m = LkmVk
(1.16)
In conclusion, we have to use the rotation matrix M (L) or its inverse L (M) for
ﬁnding the new (old) contravariant and covariant vector components, respectively.
Note that the sum of two vectors is still a vector [see Exercise A.3].
1.4
COVARIANT OR CONTRAVARIANT VECTOR COMPONENTS
To clarify the difference between covariant and contravariant components of a vec-
tor, let’s ﬁrst deﬁne the procedure of lowering a contravariant index by using the
metric coefﬁcients:
dξi ≡γijdξ j
(1.17)
As usual, we are summing over the repeated (Latin) dummy index j that goes from
1 to 3. The quantities dξi (i = 1,3) deﬁne the covariant components of the displace-
ment vector d⃗ℓ[see Exercise A.4].
Covariant and contravariant components of a vector can be different even if they
refer to the same geometrical object. Consider the simple case of a 2D Euclidean
space. If we choose an orthonormal basis, the metric coefﬁcients are γi j = δi j [c.f.
Eq.(1.5)]. It follows from Eq.(1.17) that the covariant and contravariant components
of the displacement vector are the same and that
dℓ2 = (dξ 1)2 +(dξ 2)2 = (dξ1)2 +(dξ2)2
(1.18)

Then, according to Eq.(1.17)
dξ1 = γ1jdξ j = dξ 1 +cosθdξ 2
dξ2 = γ2jdξ j = cosθdξ 1 +dξ 2
(1.20)
Figure 1.2 shows that the contravariant components of d⃗ℓare those obtained by
projecting the tip of the position vector,⃗ℓ, using parallels to the coordinate axes (par-
allelogram rule). On the contrary, the covariant components of the same vector are
those obtained by the intercepts of the normals to the coordinate axes. So, the same
vectors can be described equally well in terms of its covariant or contravariant com-
ponents, which differ in the general case of a non-orthonormal coordinate system.
Note that Eq.(1.17) allows to write Eq.(1.4) in an even more compact form.
dℓ2 = dξidξ i
(1.21)
Remember that the line element dℓhas been deﬁned as the magnitude of the dis-
placement vector [c.f. Eq.(1.3)]. This allows us to formalize the deﬁnition of the dot
or inner product of two vectors.

An Overview of General Relativity and Space-Time
INNER PRODUCT OF VECTORS: DEFINITION
The inner product of two vectors, A and B, is given by the sum of the product of their
covariant and contravariant components:
A·B = AiBi = A jBj
(1.22)
Note that the inner product of two vectors is an invariant [see Exercise A.5]. On the
basis of this deﬁnition, Eq.(1.21) together with Eq.(1.20) provides
dℓ2 = (dξ 1)2 +(dξ 2)2 +2cosθ dξ 1dξ 2
(1.23)
This is different from the familiar expression of Eq.(1.18) if θ ̸= π/2, but it is per-
fectly consistent with the well-known trigonometric Law of Cosines. Again, with
reference to Eq.(1.4), remember that the lhs is an invariant, whereas the explicit form
of the rhs depends on the chosen coordinate system.
1.5
MOTION OF A FREE TEST-PARTICLE
In Classical Mechanics, the action of a test-particle is deﬁned as the integral of a
Lagrangian, L, between two times, t1 and t2, say
S =
 t2
t1
L(⃗ℓ,⃗v,t)dt
(1.24)
The Lagrangian depends in general on the position and the velocity of the test par-
ticle, and on the time as well. The trajectory followed by the particle to go from
position A (at time t1) to position B (at time t2) renders the action stationary: δS = 0.
This leads to the Euler-Lagrangian equations.
d
dt
∂L
∂˙ξ i = ∂L
∂ξ i
(1.25)
where ξ i and ˙ξ i are the contravariant components of the test-particle position (⃗ℓ) and
velocity (⃗v = d⃗ℓ/dt) vectors, respectively. Let’s assume here a Cartesian coordinate
system.
The homogeneity and isotropy of both space and time put constraints on the mo-
tion of a free-test particle. In fact, the Lagrangian cannot explicitly depend on time
(there is no speciﬁc time for a free particle to be observed in a particular status of
motion) nor on the position (there is no special place for a free-particle to be at a
given time). Then, the Lagrangian of a free-particle can depend only on its velocity.
But the velocity is a vector, and for the isotropy of space, the Lagrangian cannot
depend on the direction of⃗v, but only on its magnitude:
L = 1
2m|⃗v|2 ≡T
(1.26)

GEODESICS
From a geometrical point of view, we can state that a free particle moves from point
A to point B following the portion of a geodesic that connects the two points. A
geodesic is a curve characterized by a length, which has a stationary value w.r.t.

terms of a variational principle by requiring δ

dℓ= ci
(B1.1.d)
where we have chosen a Cartesian coordinate system (i.e. γij = δij) and the constants
of integration, ci, are given by the direction cosines of the unit vector tangent to the
geodesic. Since dℓ= |⃗v|dt, Eq.(B1.1.d) is perfectly consistent with Eq.(1.27). Thus,
a free particle moves along a portion of a geodesic, which in our case is a straight
line. This illustrates another property of a geodesic: it is the straightest line that one
can draw in a given space to join two arbitrary points.
where m is the mass of the test-particle, |⃗v| =

and T its kinetic energy. Thus, Eq.(1.25) yields
d2ξ i
dt2 = 0
⇒
dξ i

(1.27)
Here the integration constants have been written in terms of the direction cosines,
ci, and of the constant magnitude of the velocity vector, |⃗v|. All this brings to the
well-known First Newton’s Law: a free-particle maintains constant its velocity in
magnitude and direction. If a free-particle is at rest, it will remain at rest.
Let’s conclude this section by noting that Eq.(1.27) has a very simple and impor-
tant, geometrical interpretation: a test-particle not subjected to external forces moves
along geodesics of the space [see Box 1.1 and Eq.(B1.1.d)].

INERTIAL FRAMES AND GALILEO’S RELATIVITY PRINCIPLE
We can clearly revert the argument given in the last section and say that the First
Newton’s Law is valid only in those reference frames where the space appears to
be homogeneous and isotropic. These reference frames are called inertial reference
frames and slide one w.r.t. the others with constant velocities. Let’s consider two of
these inertial reference frames, K and K ′. Both of them have a Cartesian coordi-
nate system, with each of the basis vectors of K parallel to the corresponding ones
of K ′. So, we can write ξ i = ξ ′i +ξ i
O′(t) (see Figure 1.3), where ξ i and ξ i
O′ are the
contravariant components of two position vectors, those of the particle and of the ori-
gin O′ in K . Likewise, ξ ′i are the contravariant components of the particle position
in K ′. Note that unlike the case of Eq.(1.3), here ξ i
O′ changes with time. This brings
us to the velocity composition law by Galileo: the velocity of a test-particle in K is
given by its velocity in K ′ plus the dragging speed of K ′ w.r.t. K . In formulae,
dξ i
dt = dξ ′i
dt + dξ i
O′
dt
(1.28)
There are two assumptions behind Eq.(1.28). First, most important, the time ﬂows
at the same rate both in K and in K ′. Secondly, K and K ′ are uniformly sliding
one w.r.t. to the other: d2ξ i
O′/dt2 = 0. Then,
d2ξ i
dt2 = d2ξ ′i
dt2 = 0
(1.29)
As expected, the accelerations of a free test-particle vanish both in K and in K ′.
This leads to the Galileo’s Relativity Principle: the classical laws of motion are valid
in all the inertial frames, as accelerations are unaffected by the uniform, relative
motion of these frames.
1.7
THE DERIVATIVE OF A VECTOR
In the previous section, we have evaluated the velocity of a test-particle by taking
the derivative of its position vector. As we will see later in the book, the derivative

of a vector is a very delicate operation that must be performed in a very careful way.
For the sake of simplicity, let’s restrict ourselves to a 2D vector ﬁeld in a plane:
⃗V = V i(ρk)ˆei, ρk being the components of the position vector. Now, let’s ask how
this vector changes from P(ρk) to Q(ρk + dρk). To assess the vector variation, we
have ﬁrst to parallel transport the vector ⃗V(ρk) from P to Q to obtain ⃗V ′(ρk +dρk).
This is done by keeping constant the angle between the vector and the tangent to
the geodesic connecting P to Q. In our case, the geodesic is a straight line and its
unit tangent vector, dξ k/dℓ, points always in the same direction [see Box 1.1 and
Eq.(B1.1.d); see also Figure 1.4a]. The inﬁnitesimal variation of the vector can then
be deﬁned as D⃗V = ⃗V(ρk + dρk) −⃗V ′(ρk + dρk), the two vectors being now both
bound to Q. From a more formal point of view, we can write
D⃗V =

(1.31)
where in the last equality we used the Christoffel symbols deﬁned in Box 1.2 [c.f.
Eq.(B1.2.d)]. This equation has a simple interpretation if we rewrite it as follows:
DV i = dV i −δV i
(1.32)

BOX 1.2
THE CHRISTOFFEL SYMBOLS
Depending on the particular problem we are dealing with, it could sometimes be
better to use polar rather than Cartesian coordinates, the two being connected by
well-known, standard relations: x = rcosφ; y = rsinφ. An infinitesimal 2D displace-
ment vector can then be written by using either Cartesian or polar basis vectors.
d⃗ℓ= dx ˆex +dy ˆey =

∂r dr + ∂y
∂φ dφ

ˆy
(B1.2.aa)
= dr ˆer +dφ ˆeφ
(B1.2.ab)
By comparing the terms proportional to dr and dφ, we can write
ˆer =

ˆeφ =

∂φ ˆy

(B1.2.b)
Note that ˆer is a unit vector, whereas ˆeφ is not. When we move from a point P(r,φ) to
a point Q(r+dr,φ +dφ), the polar basis vectors are expected to change in directions.
∂ˆer
∂r = 0;
∂ˆer
∂φ = ∂ˆeφ
∂r = ˆeφ
r ;
∂ˆeφ
∂φ = −r ˆer
(B1.2.c)
The derivatives of the basis vectors can then be expressed in terms of the basis
vectors themselves. In general, we can write
∂ˆej
∂ρk = Γi
jk ˆei
(B1.2.d)
where dρk ≡{dr,dφ} and the coefficients Γi
jk are the so-called affine connections
or Christoffel symbols. We will come back to them later in the book. By comparing
Eq.(B1.2.c ) and Eq.(B1.2.d) it is straightforward to show that there are only two
non-vanishing Christoffel symbols.
Γ1
22 = −r;
Γ2
12 = 1
r
(B1.2.e)
A more formal definition of the Christoffel symbols can be given in terms of the
coordinate transformation:
Γi
jk = ∂xi
∂ξ l
∂ξ l
∂x j∂xk
(B1.2.f)
where ξ l ≡{x,y} and xi ≡{r,φ} are in this case Cartesian and polar coordinates,
respectively. It is easy to show that the definition given in Eq.(B1.2.f) provides the
results given in Eq.(B1.2.e) [see Exercise A.6]]
We can then state that the intrinsic variation of the i-th component of a vector,
DV i, is obtained by subtracting to its total variation, dV i = (∂V i/∂ρk)dρk, the

Space and Time: The Classical View
13
spurious variation, δV i = −V jΓi
jkdρk, introduced by the parallel transport. The spu-
rious variation clearly depends on the chosen coordinate system. For Cartesian coor-
dinates, the Christoffel symbols vanish, as the basis vectors remain unchanged when
moving from P to Q [c.f. Eq.(B1.2.d)]. This is not the case for polar coordinates [see
Figure 1.4b]. In this case, ρk ≡{r,φ} and we can use Eq.(B1.2.e) to write
DV (1) = ∂V (1)
∂ρk dρk −rV (2)dφ
DV (2) = ∂V (2)
∂ρk dρk + V (1)
r dφ + V (2)
r dr (1.33)
where the superscripts (1) and (2) identify the contravariant components of ⃗V and
D⃗V along ˆer and ˆeφ, respectively.
1.8
VELOCITY OF INTERACTIONS AND SECOND NEWTON’S LAW
Let’s consider an isolated system composed by N interacting particles. In this case,
the Lagrangian writes
L =

2m(n) ˙ξ(n)i ˙ξ i
(n) −U


(1.34)
where the ﬁrst term gives the kinetic energy of the system, while U is its potential
energy. As it is well known, in Classical Mechanics U depends only on the particle
positions. This implies that their interactions are instantaneous and, then, that they
propagate at an inﬁnity velocity. This assumption is intimately related to the exis-
tence of an absolute time (time ﬂows at the same rate in all reference frames, and all
the watches can always be synchronized) and to the Galilean Principle of Relativity.
In fact, if the velocity of interaction was not inﬁnite, then it should vary from one
inertial reference frame to another one, implying that the physical evolution of the
system would depend on the chosen reference frame. This would be in clear contra-
diction with the Galilean Principle of Relativity. The Euler-Lagrange equations for
the n-th particle

Here p(n)i = m(n) ˙ξ(n)i and F(n)i = −∂U/∂ξ(n)i are the covariant components of the n-
th particle momentum and of the force exerted on that particle by all the other ones.
Clearly, changing the potential energy by a constant does not affect the dynamics
of the system. Eq.(1.36) gives the Second Newton’s Law: the rate of change of
momentum of a test-particle is directly proportional to the force applied on it, and it
takes place in the direction of the applied force.

HOMOGENEITY OF TIME: ENERGY CONSERVATION

In fact, for an isolated system, L = T −U and we recover the well-known expression
for the energy of the system: E = T +U. Thus, the conservation of energy for an
isolated system directly derives from the homogeneity of time.
1.10
HOMOGENEITY OF SPACE: THE THIRD NEWTON’S LAW
As a consequence of the assumed homogeneity of space, the properties of an isolated
system cannot change for a translation of the reference frame [c.f. Section 1.3]. Thus,
if ξ i
(n) →ξ i
(n) +δξ, then L →L+δL. To ﬁrst order,
δL =

Because of the arbitrariness of δξ the condition δL = 0 implies that for an isolated

where, again, F(n)i are the covariant components of the force exerted by the system on
the n-th particle. This yields the Third Newton’s Law: to every action, there is always
opposed an equal reaction. The mutual actions of two bodies upon each other are
always equal in magnitude, but oriented in opposite directions: F(1)i = −F(2)i. Thus,
the Third Newton’s Law directly derives from the homogeneity of space.

PLANETARY MOTIONS
One of the great achievement of Classical Mechanics is the successful description of
the planetary motions. As we will see in Chapter 10, General Relativity challenges
this result. Because of this, we want here to brieﬂy remind the reader about the basic
results of Classical Mechanics, as they will be later used as a benchmark in compar-
ing the General Relativity predictions with the astronomical observations.
Let’s write the Lagrangian of a test-particle subjected to a central gravitational
ﬁeld, in polar coordinates (ξ 1 = r, ξ 2 = θ and ξ 3 = φ):
L = 1

of our chosen polar reference frame. The equation for k = 3 (and θ = π/2)

provides the conservation of the angular momentum per unit mass:
r2 ˙φ = H
(1.45)
consistent with Second Kepler’s Law: a line segment joining a planet and the Sun
sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time.
The energy per unit mass of the test-particle can be written as follows:
E = 1

(1.46)
Here v2
∥= ˙r2 and v2
⊥= H2/r2 are the radial and transverse velocity components,
whereas M is the mass of the central body, the Sun in our case. Since v2
∥≥0,
Eq.(1.46) yields
E ≥1

(1.47)
where Ve f f (r) is the effective potential shown in Figure 1.5a. The condition given in
Eq.(1.47) is not fulﬁlled in the shaded area of Figure 1.5a, the forbidden region of our
parameter space. The motion of a test-particle occurs at constant E . Note that if the
angular momentum is different from zero, Ve f f has one minimum at rmin = H2/GM.
So, we might have circular orbits (for r = rmin); closed, elliptical orbits for E < 0;
and open, hyperbolic orbits for E > 0. As long as H ̸= 0, the test-particle cannot be
gravitationally captured by the central body because of the potential barrier at small

central body will be always captured (see Figure 1.5b).
To ﬁnd an explicit solution for the radial motion, we could use Eq.(1.42) with k =

This is a non-linear differential equation for u. Instead of directly solving it, let’s
derive it w.r.t. φ to get
u′u′′H2 +uu′H2 = GMu′
(1.49)
This equation clearly admits as a solution u′ = 0, that is, a circular orbit with r =
rmin [c.f. Figure 1.5a]. Since we want to deal with planetary motion, we are more
interested to elliptical rather than circular orbits. So, let’s discard the solution u′ = 0.
Eq.(1.49) then provides
u′′ +u = GM

(1.50)
This equation admits the following solution
u = GM
H2 +Bcosφ
(1.51)
where B is an integration constant to be determined in terms of the initial conditions.

NON-INERTIAL REFERENCE FRAMES
Let’s conclude this chapter by discussing non-inertial reference frames. These frames
play an important conceptual role in passing from Special to General Relativity. In
view of this important step, let’s brieﬂy review how inertial forces are described in
Classical Mechanics. Consider ﬁrst the lab. reference frame, K , with Cartesian co-
ordinates ξ k. In this frame, the Lagrangian of a free test-particle is given by Eq.(1.26)
and the Euler-Lagrangian equations provide d2ξ k/dt2 = 0, as it should be for a free
particle [c.f. Eq.(1.27)]. Consider now a new reference frame, X, and choose again
an orthonormal coordinate system. The X frame rotates counterclockwise with a
constant angular velocity ω around the ξ 3-axis in the lab frame K . In this case, is
as follows:
ξ 1 = xcos(ωt)−ysin(ωt)
ξ 2 = xsin(ωt)+ycos(ωt)
ξ 3 = z
(1.53)
where x, y and z are the coordinates of the test-particle in X . Note that Eq.(1.53) de-
scribes a non-linear coordinate transformation, unlike that described by Eq.(1.8). In
fact, the Jacobian matrix, ∂ξ i/∂xk, is not a constant anymore, and it is now a function
of the coordinates. Thus, we can conclude that non-linear coordinate transformations

allow to pass from an inertial to a non-inertial frame. Let’s verify this statement by
substituting Eq.(1.53) in Eq.(1.26) to get the Lagrangian of the test-particle in the
rotating frame X.

Note that in the X frame the space is neither homogeneous (the Lagrangian depends
on the position) nor isotropic (the Lagrangian depends on the single components of
the velocity vector). This is not unexpected, as an observer in X sees a preferred
direction, around which X rotates. The Euler-Lagrangian equations

inertial forces. We will discuss again non-inertial reference frames in Chapter 3, in
the framework of four-dimensional space-times.

2 From Space and Time to
Space-Time
2.1
INTRODUCTION
In Classical Mechanics, the interactions among particles propagate at an inﬁnity ve-
locity. As discussed in Chapter 1, this conclusion rests on two assumptions: the ab-
soluteness of time and the validity of the Galileo’s Relativity Principle. The theory of
Special Relativity, proposed in 1905 by Einstein [18], combines the Relativity Prin-
ciple with the existence of a limiting speed for the propagation of the interactions.
To obtain this goal, it is necessary to reconsider in depth the concept of time, aban-
doning the classical idea of its “absoluteness.” This is the only way to have the same
limiting speed in every inertial frame. The goal of this chapter is to review these
concepts, together with the basic notions and formalism of Special Relativity.
2.2
A METRIC SPACE-TIME
To see why the idea of an absolute time has to be abandoned, consider two inertial
frames, K and K ′, uniformly sliding one w.r.t. to the other. If the speed of light in
the vacuum c has to be an invariant, then
c = dl
dt = dl′
dt′
(2.1)
where dl (dl′) is the (inﬁnitesimal) coordinate spatial interval travelled by a light
signal in a time interval dt (dt′) in K (K ′). There are no reasons to assume a priori
that dl is equal to dl′. Thus, there can’t be any reason to infer that dt is equal to dt′.
In other words, we have now to take into account a constraint on the ratio between
space and time, rather than on space and time separately. It follows that time has to
be downgraded from its absolute role in Classical Mechanics to the level of all the
other coordinates. Thus, the time coordinate, as the spatial ones, must depend on the
chosen reference frame.
All this can be formalized by using the idea of event, but in a deeply different way
w.r.t. Classical Mechanics. In fact, now an event is deﬁned not in space and time,
but rather in space-time. It follows that the event E is still characterized by a when
(one time coordinate, ξ o = ct) and by a where (three spatial coordinates, ξ k with
k = 1, 2, and3). Then, an event can now be conveniently represented geometrically
as a point of a ﬁctitious four-dimensional space, the space-time. Then, in analogy
with Eq.(1.1), we can indicate with ξ α the contravariant components of the posi-
tion vector of the event E (ξ α). So far, we have done nothing but replace the Latin
indexes (running from 1 to 3) with Greek indexes (running from 0 to 3). This is the

convention we will adopt hereafter. Note that this extension, by itself, is necessary,
but not sufﬁcient for our task. We clearly need a particular space-time where the
invariance of the speed of light can be easily enforced for all the inertial observers.
This is done by using a hyperbolic geometry that combines the familiar 3D Euclidean
space with 1D time dimension. As a result, we have the four-dimensional Minkowski
space-time, fully described by the so-called Minkowski metric:
ds2 = dξ 02 −dξkdξ k = ηαβdξ αdξ β
(2.2)
where the matrix
ηαβ = diag(+1,−1,−1,−1)
(2.3)
identiﬁes the Minkowski metric coefﬁcients. Let’s make two comments. First, the
writing of Eq.(2.3) implies choosing an orthogonal coordinate system1. Secondly,
unlike what was done in Eq.(1.6), we now algebraically sum in quadrature the dif-
ferential of the coordinates. For this reason, we refer to the Minkowski space-time
as to a pseudo-Euclidean, four-dimensional ﬂat space. Let’s anticipate here what we
mean by ﬂat space.
FLAT SPACE
Deﬁnition 2.1. An N-dimensional space is said to be ﬂat if it is possible to ﬁnd a
coordinate system, covering all the space, where the metric can be written in a diagonal
form.
ds2 = εαdxα 2
(2.4)
The coefﬁcients εα can be either positive or negative, although of norm one. According
to the Einstein convention, in Eq.(2.4), α runs from 1 (or 0) to N (or N −1).
Thus, because of its signature2 [c.f. Eq.(2.3)], the line element of a Minkowski space-
time is not necessarily associated to a positive deﬁned “distance” between two nearby
events, E1(ξ α) and E2(ξ α +dξ α). In fact, the Minkowski metric can return positive
(ds2 > 0), as well as null (ds2 = 0) or negative (ds2 < 0) values, depending on dξ 02
being larger, equal or smaller than dξkdξ k. In these cases, we talk about time-, light-
or space-like intervals, respectively. For light-like intervals, we can write
(dξ 0)
2 −dξkdξ k = 0
(2.5)
in the K and
(dξ ′0)
2 −dξ ′
kdξ ′k = 0
(2.6)
1 The standard basis for the Minkowski space-time is provided by a set of four mutually orthogonal vectors
{ˆe0, ˆe1, ˆe2, ˆe3} such that ˆe0 · ˆe0 = 1 = −ˆe1 · ˆe1 = −ˆe2 · ˆe2 = −ˆe3 · ˆe3 and ˆeα · ˆeβ = 0 for α ̸= /β. This is
the convention that we will be using hereafter in this and the next Chapters.
2 The signature of a quadratic form is deﬁned in terms of the numbers of vanishing, positive and negative
eigenvalues of the quadratic form. Thus, sign(ηµν) = {0,1,3}.

From Space and Time to Space-Time
21
in the K ′ inertial frames. This is fully consistent with the requirement of Eq.(2.1).
Note that this is still an ansatz, as we have not yet discussed which coordinate trans-
formations links the writing of Eq.(2.5) in K with the writing of Eq.(2.6) in K ′.
For the moment, let’s stress here that the geometrical formulation of the invariance
of the speed of light in the vacuum is structurally embedded in the functional form of
the Minkowski metric of Eq.(2.2) and stands on the invariance of line element, ds. It
follows that the classiﬁcation of time-, light- and space-like intervals is an absolute
one, regardless of the speciﬁc choice of the reference frame we want to use.
2.3
HOMOGENEITY AND ISOTROPY OF THE MINKOWSKI
SPACE-TIME
In Classical Mechanics, there is a particular class of reference frames, the inertial
ones, from where space and time share the same properties of being homogeneous
and isotropic [c.f. Section 1.3]. Here we want to extend these considerations to the
Minkowski space-time, showing that there exists a class of reference frames, the in-
ertial ones, from where the Minkowski space-time appears to be both homogeneous
and isotropic.
Homogeneity
For the Minkowski space-time to be homogeneous, all positions in space-time must
be equivalent. This means that the choice of the origin of the coordinate system
shouldn’t really matter. Then, imagine to displace, without rotating, an inertial refer-
ence frame where the metric form is given by Eq.(2.2). As a result, the coordinates of
all the points of the Minkowski space-time will change accordingly: ξ α = ξ ′α +dα,
where dα are the (constant) contravariant components of the displacement vector. It
is immediate to verify that the metric of Eq.(2.2) remains unchanged under such a
rigid displacement as ηαβ = η′
αβ and dξ α = dξ ′α.
Isotropy
For the Minkowski space-time to be isotropic, all directions must be equivalent and
the orientation of the coordinate axes shouldn’t matter. Thus, the metric given in
Eq.(2.2) should remain unchanged under a rotation of the coordinate system. In anal-
ogy with Eq.(1.8) and Eq.(1.9), let’s write this coordinate transformation as follows:
ξ α = Lα µ ξ ′µ;
ξ ′µ = Mµα ξ α
(2.7)
where
Lα µ ≡∂ξ α
∂ξ ′µ ;
Mµ α ≡∂ξ ′µ
∂ξ α
(2.8)
can be interpreted as “rotation” matrixes in the four-dimensional Minkowski space-
time. As such, they must depend only on a single constant parameter, the “rota-
tion” angle. If so, Eq.(2.7) still describes linear transformations, where neither Lα µ
nor Mµ α can depend on the space-time coordinates. The four-by-four matrixes of
Eq.(2.8) are one the inverse of the other (M = L−1), like the are three-by-three ma-
trixes of Eq.(1.9). Then, on the basis of Eq.(2.7) and Eq.(2.8), we can write
ds2 = ηαβdξ αdξ β = ηαβLα µdξ ′µLβ νdξ ′ν = η′
µνdξ ′µdξ ′ν
(2.9)

BOX 2.1
VECTORS IN THE MINKOWSKI SPACE-TIME
As done in Section 1.3, we can use Eq.(2.7) to extend its use beyond the class of
position vectors. We can then state the following:
• Contravariant components of a four-vector
A set of four quantities V α (α = 0,3) are the contravariant components of a
four-vector if they transform, on a change of coordinates, as in Eq.(2.7).
V α = Lα µV ′µ;
V ′µ = Mµ νV ′ν
(B2.1.a)
The lowering of contravariant indexes writes as follows [c.f. Eq.(1.17)]
dξα = ηαβ dξ β
(B2.1.b)
With this definition, Eq.(2.2) becomes [c.f. Eq.(1.21)].
ds2 =



dξαdξ α = dξαLα µdξ ′µ
dξ ′µdξ ′µ = dξ ′µMµ αdξ α
(B2.1.c)
We must then conclude that the covariant components of the infinitesimal displace-
ment vector transform as follows:
dξα = Mµ αdξ ′
µ;
dξ ′
µ = Lα µdξα
(B2.1.d)
Going beyond the class of position vectors, we can state the following:
• Covariant components of a four-vector
A set of four quantities Vα (α = 0,3) are the covariant components of a four-
vector if they transform, on a change of coordinates, as in Eq.(B2.1.d).
Vα = Mµ αV ′
µ;
V ′
µ = Lα µVα
(B2.1.e)
Finally, we can extend what was done in Section 1.4, by defining the dot (or inner)
product of four-vectors and by stating the following:
• The inner product of the two four-vectors
Consistently with Eq.(B2.1.c), the inner product of two four-vectors is given by
the sum of the product of their covariant and contravariant components:
A·B = AαBα = Aβ Bβ
(B2.1.f)
The dot product is of course an invariant [see Exercise A.7].

The space-time is isotropic if and only if

(2.11)
This is the condition that allows us to specify the form of the “rotation” matrixes
given in Eq.(2.8). This is what we want to discuss in the next section.
2.4
ORDINARY VS. HYPERBOLIC ROTATIONS
When we talk about “rotations” in space-time, we have to be more speciﬁc. Let’s
underline two important differences w.r.t. to the familiar rotations in a 3D Euclidean
space. First, since we are dealing with a four-dimensional space-time, there are now
six different possible “rotations,” in six different coordinate planes: the (three) space
planes, ξ i −ξ j (with i > j and i ̸= j), and the (three) space-time planes, ξ i −ξ 0. The
ﬁrst three are standard rotations around each of the three ξ i-axes. Thus, a rotation
around the ξ 3-axis is described by the following matrixes:
Lα µ ≡









(2.12)
with the rotation angle bound to be in the interval 0 ≤φ ≤2π, as in Eq.(1.10) 3.
The second, and more important, difference has to do with the signature of the
Minkowski metric [c.f. Eq.(2.3)], proper of a hyperbolic geometry. It follows that
in order to fulﬁll the condition given in Eq.(2.11), we have to consider hyperbolic
rotations in the ξ 1−ξ 0, ξ 2−ξ 0 and ξ 3−ξ 0 planes. For example, a hyperbolic rotation
in the ξ 1 −ξ 0 plane is described by the following rotation matrixes:
Lα µ ≡



where now −∞≤ψ ≤∞4.
Let’s conclude this section with a ﬁnal comment to visualize the difference be-
tween standard and hyperbolic rotations. In the standard case, a rotation by an angle
3 We will leave as an exercise to ﬁnd the equivalent of Eq.(2.12) for rotations around the ξ 2- and ξ 3-axes
and to verify that these rotations leave unaltered the metric form of Eq.(2.2) [see Exercises A.8].
4 We will leave as an exercise to ﬁnd the equivalent of Eq.(2.13) for hyperbolic rotations in the ξ 2−ξ 0
and ξ 3−ξ 0 planes and to show that these rotations leave unaltered the metric given in Eq.(2.2) [see
Exercise (A.9)].

φ moves a point along a circumference (see Figure 2.1a). On the contrary, a hyper-
bolic rotation by an angle ψ moves a point along the branches of a hyperbola (see
Figure 2.1b). Note that the result of the two consecutive hyperbolic rotations gener-
ally depends upon the order with which they are performed [see Exercise (A.10)].
2.5
HYPERBOLIC ROTATIONS VS. DRAG VELOCITIES
There is another important difference between ordinary and hyperbolic rotations.
Let’s discuss this point by considering, as an example, the case of a hyperbolic ro-
tation in the x −ct plane. Then, by using Eq.(2.7) and Eq.(2.13), we can write the
coordinate transformation in a more explicit form



ct′ = coshψct −sinhψx;
x′ = −sinhψct +coshψx;
y′ = y;
z′ = z
(2.14)
We want to stress again that Eq.(2.14) provides linear coordinate transformations
that preserve the metric form of a homogeneous and isotropic space-time [c.f.
Eq.(2.2)]. But the space-time is observed to be homogeneous and isotropic only from
inertial frames. We can then conclude that Eq.(2.14) allows us to move from one in-
ertial reference frame to another (still inertial) one. Then, consider two inertial refer-
ence frames, K and K ′, sliding uniformly one w.r.t. the other along their common
x-axes. The spatial origin O′ of K ′ moves w.r.t. to K with a velocity of constant
magnitude, V = x/t, oriented as the x-axis of K . We can synchronize the watches
of K and K ′ by imposing t = t′ = 0 when the spatial origins O and O′ coincide.
A given event E has coordinates ξ α ≡{ct,x,y,z} in K and ξ ′α ≡{ct′,x′,y′,z′} in

25
K ′. For the spatial origin O′ of K ′, we obviously have x′ = y′ = z′ = 0. Thus,
Eq.(2.14) yields
tanhψ = x
ct ≡V
c ≡β
(2.15)
This shows how a geometrical quantity, the hyperbolic rotation angle ψ, is related
to a physical quantity, the uniform drag velocity V of K ′ w.r.t. K [see Exercise
A.11]. Let’s stress the important physical difference between ordinary and hyperbolic
rotations. In the former the spatial coordinate axes of K ′ are rotated w.r.t. K , but
without any relative motion of the two frames5. Conversely, in the latter, there is not
a rotation of the spatial coordinated axes, while there is a uniform, relative motion of
the two frames6. From Eq.(2.15), it follows that coshψ = γ and sinhψ = βγ, where
γ ≡(1−β 2)−1/2 is the Lorentz factor and β = V/c. Thus,

These are the so-called Lorentz’s transformations, connecting—we stress it again—
two inertial reference frames. Coordinate transformations describing the relative uni-
form motion of the frames K and K ′ without any rotation of the spatial coordinate
axes are called boosts. The matrixes in Eq.(2.16) are then called boosts (or Lorentz)
matrixes. As expected, these transformations mix space and time coordinates. As al-
ready discussed (see Exercise A.10), Lorentz transformations commute if and only
if they describe hyperbolic rotations around the same axis. Equivalently, two con-
secutive boosts commute if and only if they occur along the same direction. This is
not the case for the two successive Galileo transformations, which always commute
independently in the direction of the drag velocity ⃗V [see Exercise A.12]. Note also
that the Lorentz transformations reduce to the classical Galileo transformations for
β →0 (or c →∞) : t = t′; x = x′ +Vt′ (or x′ = x−Vt); y = y′; z = z′.

LORENTZ TRANSFORMATIONS: A GRAPHICAL APPROACH
In order to visualize hyperbolic rotations in a Minkowski space-time, consider the x−
ct plane of the lab. reference frame, K . A world line is a series of events experienced
5 If the ﬁrst frame is inertial, it will be so also the second one, as no relative motion is present.
6 Again, if the ﬁrst frame is inertial, it will be so also the second one, as their relative motion is uniform.

by a speciﬁc observer, and it is described by a sequential path in space-time. For
example, the world line of an inertial observer at rest in the spatial origin O of K
coincides by deﬁnition with the time axis, ct, of K . In an analogous way, the world
line of another inertial observer at rest in the spatial origin O′ of K ′ coincides by
deﬁnition with the time axis, ct′, of K ′. It follows that Eq (2.12) with x′ = y′ = z′ = 0
provides the position of the ct′ axis in the x−ct plane:
ct
x = 1
β
(2.18)
This equation describes a straight line with angular coefﬁcient 1/β (see Figure 2.2a).
Following a similar line of reasoning, we conclude that the x-axis of K is constituted
by all the events that in K are simultaneous with O, that is, those with t = 0.
Likewise, the x′-axis is constituted by all the events that in K ′ are simultaneous with
O′, that is, those with t′ = 0. Thus, we can use Eq (2.17) with t′ = 0 to identify the
position of the x′-axis in the x−ct plane.
ct
x = β
(2.19)
This equation still describes a straight line in the x −ct plane, but now with an an-
gular coefﬁcient β (see Figure 2.2b). In conclusion, in a Minkowski space-time, a
hyperbolic rotation “squeezes” the K ′ coordinate axes, ct′ and x′, toward the bisec-
tor of the ﬁrst (and third) quadrants of the x−ct plane (see Figure 2.2c). If β →−β,
K ′ moves in the opposite direction to that of the x-axis: the ct′- and x′-axes are
squeezed now toward the bisector of the second (and fourth) quadrants of the x−ct
plane.
Let’s conclude this section with few consideration that immediately follows from
what we have just discussed. First, the two bisectors (ct = x or ct = −x) are deﬁned
by light-like events with ds2 = 0 and constitute the so-called light cone. Light sig-
nal propagates along these bisectors in every reference frame, as a consequence of
the invariance of the speed of light. Secondly, the portion of space-time inside the
light cone is constituted by time-like events, with ds2 > 0. It is always possible to
ﬁnd an inertial frame in which a time-like event occurs at the spatial origin of the
chosen reference frame (see Figures 2.3a and 2.3b). It is however impossible to ﬁnd

where this event, B′1 (B′2), is seen to occur at t′ = 0, but not at the origin O′, see text.
a reference frame where time-like events are simultaneous to the one occurring in O
(O′) at t = 0 (t′ = 0). This is why the upper (lower) part of the light cone is called
the absolute future (past) of an observer at the origin O of K (see Figure 2.3c).
Finally, the portion of space-time outside the light cone contains space-like events,
with ds2 < 0. It is always possible to ﬁnd an inertial frame in which a space-like
event is simultaneous to the one occurring in O (O′) at t = 0 (t′ = 0) (see Fig-
ures 2.4a and 2.4b). It is however impossible to ﬁnd a reference frame where space-
like events are seen to occur at the same position in space. This is why the portion
of the space-time outside the light-cone is often called the absolute elsewhere (see
Figure 2.4c).

PROPER TIME AND PROPER LENGTH
Proper time
As discussed in Section 2.2, the when and the where of an event are deﬁned by
its space-time coordinates, ξ α (α = 0,3). As such, they depend upon the chosen

reference frame [c.f. Eq.(2.13)]. In Section 2.6, we have seen that it is always possible
to ﬁnd an inertial frame, K ′, where a time-like event occurs at the spatial origin
of that frame, O′, but at t′ ̸= 0 [see Figures 2.3a and 2.3b]. Thus, in K ′, the line
element connecting two time-like, copunctual events reduces to ds = cdt′. But ds
is an invariant. Then, also this partiuclar dt′ must be so. This allows us to deﬁne a
particular time, the proper time.
PROPER TIME
Deﬁnition 2.2. The proper time τ is deﬁned as the time elapsed between two time-like
events that occur at the same position in space
dτ = ds
c
(2.20)
The proper time, let’s stress it again, is an invariant and, as such, is independent
of the choice of the reference frame. On the basis of Eq.(2.20), we can write [c.f.
Eq.(2.2)]
c2dτ2 = c2dt2 +ηijdξ idξ j = c2dt2

1−δij
dξ i

(2.21)
It follows that in the lab. reference frame, K , the relation between proper time and
coordinate time is given by the following relation:
dτ = dt

1−β 2
(2.22)
where β = V/c and V =

δi j ˙ξ i ˙ξ j is the magnitude of the dragging speed of K ′
w.r.t. K 7. In Special Relativity, Eq.(2.22) describes the well-known time dilation
phenomenon. In fact, since 0 ≤β ≤1, then dτ ≤dt: the time of a moving observer,
its proper time, ﬂows more slowly than inferred by an observer at rest w.r.t. the lab.
Proper length
Since time and space coordinates are alike in Minkowski space-time, we do expect
that Lorenz transformations affect not only time—but also space—intervals, that is
lengths. Just on the basis of the Lorentz transformation, it is possible to deﬁne a
particular length, the proper length.
PROPER LENGTH
Deﬁnition 2.3. The proper length is the distance between two space-like events that
occur at the same time.
7 Eq.(2.22) can also be derived by the Lorentz transformations [c.f. Eq.(2.17)]. In fact, for an observer in
the spatial origin O′ of K ′, we have cdt = γcdt′ = γcdτ.

From Space and Time to Space-Time
29
Consider once again the inertial reference frame K ′ uniformly sliding along the
x-axis of the lab. frame K . Consider a ruler at rest w.r.t. K ′ and aligned with the x′
axis. The proper length of the ruler is then given by Lp ≡x′
2 −x′
1. An observer at rest
w.r.t. K measures the coordinates of the ruler’s extrema (i.e., x1 and x2) at the same
time t. By using Eq.(2.17), one immediately gets
Lp ≡x′
2 −x′
1 = γ(x2 −x1) = γL
(2.23)
implying
L = Lp

1−β 2
(2.24)
Thus, the maximum length of a ruler is Lp, the one measured in the reference frame
where the ruler is at rest. The length of the same ruler will be shorter than Lp in those
reference frames w.r.t. which the ruler is moving, e.g., in the lab. frame K . This is
the length contraction phenomenon of Special Relativity.
2.8
MOTION OF A FREE TEST-PARTICLE
In Section 1.5 we have discussed the variational approach to the study of a free test-
particle in Classical Mechanics. Let’s extend a similar approach to the case of Special
Relativity. Since for the Relativity Principle the motion of a free-particle has to be
the same for all the inertial observers, it makes sense to deﬁne the action of a free
test-particle in terms of an invariant. The obvious invariant to take in consideration
is the line element, ds. Remember that for a massive particle, ds is, by deﬁnition,
time-like and positively deﬁned in any reference frame. Then, let’s deﬁne the action
of a free-particle as follows:
S = −mc
 E2
E1
ds
(2.25)
Here m is the rest mass of the test-particle, c is the speed of light, while E1 and E2
identify the initial and ﬁnal “positions” of the free-particle in space-time. Because of
Eq.(2.22), the action can always be written as follows:
S = −mc
 E2
E1
cdt

1−β 2 =
 E2
E1
L(v2)dt
(2.26)
where β 2 = v2/c2 and v2 = δi j ˙ξ i ˙ξ j is the square magnitude of the particle 3D ve-
locity in the chosen inertial reference frame. It follows that for a free test-particle the
Lagrangian is given by
L = −mc2

1−v2/c2
(2.27)
Note that this Lagrangian depends only on the magnitude of the particle velocity, as
in Eq.(1.26), because of the homogeneity and the isotropy of the Minkowski space-
time. These properties are embedded in the functional form of the line element [see
Section 2.3]. By imposing that the action is stationary, we arrive to write the Euler-
Lagrangian equations [c.f. Eq.(1.25)]

(2.29)
where the integration constants have again been expressed in terms of the direction
cosines, ci, and of the constant magnitude of the test-particle 3D velocity, |⃗v|.
2.9
FOUR-VELOCITY AND FOUR-ACCELERATION VECTORS
It is convenient to fully exploit the four-dimensional formalism of the Minkowski
space-time to deﬁne the contravariant components of the test-particle four-velocity
uα ≡dξ α
ds
(2.30)
and four-acceleration.
aα ≡d2ξ α
ds2
(2.31)
These are clearly contravariant components of four-vectors. In fact, under a linear
Lorentz transformation [c.f. Eq.(2.7)],
dξ α
ds = Lα µ
dξ ′µ
ds ;
d2ξ α
ds2 = Lα µ
d2ξ ′µ
ds2
(2.32)
consistently with the deﬁnition given in Eq.(2.8). Being ds = cdt/γp, the test-particle
four-velocity has the following contravariant and covariant components:
uα = γp

1,⃗vp
c

;
uβ = ηβµuµ = γp

1,−⃗vp
c

(2.33)
where the 3D velocity vector, ⃗vp, has contravariant components v(k)
p
≡˙ξ k, and
magnitude |⃗vp| = δi j ˙ξ i ˙ξ j. The Lorentz factor writes in the usual form: 1/γp =

1−|⃗vp|2/c2. Note that, by construction, the components of the particle four-
velocity are adimensional. Note also that they are not independent. In fact8,
uαuα = 1
(2.34)
Being an inner product [c.f. Eq.(B2.1.f)], Eq.(2.34) is valid in any reference frame.
Let’s conclude this section by noting that the four-acceleration is always orthogonal
to the four-velocity. In fact, by deriving Eq.(2.34) w.r.t. ds, one gets
2uα
duα
ds = 0
(2.35)
implying that the inner product of four-velocity and four-acceleration vanishes in any
reference frame.
8 Eq.(2.34) can be veriﬁed either by remembering that ds2 = dξαdξ α [c.f. Eq.(B2.1.c) and Eq.(2.30)] or
by direct substitution: u′
αu′α = ηαβ u′αu′β [c.f. Eq.(B2.1.b) and Eq.(2.33)].

GEODESICS IN MINKOWSKI SPACE-TIME
As discussed in Box 1.1, a free-particle moves along the geodesic that connects the
initial with the ﬁnal particle positions. So, let’s substitute the line element dℓof Box
1.1 with the line element ds, proper of a Minkowski space-time9.

(2.36)
As in Box 1.1, λ is a parameter deﬁned along the trajectory of the particle, whereas,
as usual, δξ α(E1) = δξ α(E2) = 0. Eq.(2.2) allows us to write
ds
dλ =

Then, Eq.(2.36) provides

Because of the arbitrariness of δξα = ηαβδξ β, we have to conclude that the four-
acceleration of a free test-particle must vanish
d2ξ α
ds2 = 0
(2.39)
The four-acceleration is a vector [c.f. Eq.(2.32)]. Because of the linearity of the
Lorentz transformations [c.f. Eq.(2.7)], the vanishing of the four-acceleration must
be veriﬁed in any inertial frame [c.f. Eq.(2.32)]. Eq.(2.39) clearly implies that
dξ α
ds = const
(2.40)
Therefore, in geometrical terms, the vector tangent to the particle trajectory, dξ α/ds,
identiﬁes always the same direction. So, we can state the following:
THE MOTION OF A FREE TEST- PARTICLE
A free test-particle moves along a geodesic, a curve of stationary length [c.f. Eq.(2.36)],
the straightest line one can draw between two events in the Minkowski space-time [c.f.
Eq.(2.40)].
Let’s conclude this section with two comments. First, note that the straightness of
the Minkowski geodesics reﬂects the ﬂatness of the space-time [c.f. Eq.(2.4)]. Sec-
ondly, remember that ds = cdt

1−(|⃗vp|/c)2 and that |⃗vp| = const: it follows that
the spatial components of Eq. (2.39) and Eq.(2.40) are completely consistent with
those given in Eq.(2.29).
9 Remember that for a massive test-particle the line element ds is time-like and positive deﬁned.

FOUR-MOMENTUM
Let’s use Eq.(2.28) to deﬁne the covariant components of the 3D test-particle mo-
mentum [c.f. Eq.(1.36)]
pk ≡∂L
∂˙ξ k = −γm ˙ξk
(2.41)
where L is given by Eq.(2.27). On a similar line, we can write the energy of the
test-particle as follows [c.f. Eq.(1.39) and Eq.(2.27)]:
E = ∂L

(2.42)
where, again, β 2 = δi j ˙ξ i ˙ξ j/c2. This is a well-known result of Special Relativity,
stating the following.
THE REST- MASS ENERGY
When a particle is at rest, its energy does not vanish, but it is instead equal to its rest-mass
energy: E = mc2. As a consequence, mass can be converted into energy and energy can
be converted into mass.
The energy and the momentum of a test-particle can be conveniently written as the
components of a single four-vector, the test-particle four-momentum
pα ≡mcuα =
E
c ,⃗p

(2.43)
The squared magnitude of the four-momentum is given by
pα pα = p0p0 + pkpk = E2
c2 −|⃗p|2 = m2c2
(2.44)
Thus, the relativistic relation between energy and momentum of a free test-particle
can be written as follows:
E2
c2 = m2c2 +|⃗p|2
(2.45)
For ultra-relativistic particles, with either m = 0 or m ≪E/c2, Eq.(2.45) provides
the well-known result for relativistic particles: |⃗p| = E/c.
Let’s use Eq.(B2.1.a) to ﬁnd how energy and momentum transform from one in-
ertial to another (still inertial) frame: pα = Lα β p′β. By using Eq.(2.13), we ﬁnd
p0 = γ

, that is,
E =
E′ +V p′1

1−V 2/c2
(2.46)
where V is the magnitude of the drag velocity of K ′, oriented along the x-axis of
K . In a similar way, using again Eq.(2.13), we ﬁnd pk = γ

β p′0 + p′1
, leading to
p1 = E′V/c2 + p′1

1−V 2/c2 ;
p2 = p′2;
p3 = p′3

RELATIVISTIC VELOCITY COMPOSITION LAW
Let’s conclude this chapter by discussing the relativistic velocity composition law.
To do so, consider an inertial frame, K ′, uniformly sliding along the x-axis of the
lab. frame, K . The corresponding Lorentz transformations are described by the hy-
perbolic rotation matrix of Eq.(2.12):

(2.48)
where the subscripts “K ′” indicate that both the Lorentz, γK ′, and the βK ′ factors
depend on the dragging velocity V of K ′ w.r.t. K . The contravariant components
of the particle four-velocity in K
are then given by uα = Lα βu′β, where u′β =

To have a more direct link with the Galilean velocity composition law, let’s derive
the transformation law of the spatial components of the particle four-velocity. First,
note that

ds

dξ 0 = u0 dξ i
cdt = u0 v(i)

(2.51)
Note that for c →∞, Eq.(2.51) is perfectly consistent with Eq.(1.28), the Galileo’s
velocity composition law. If the test-particle moves also along the x′-axis of K ′ with
velocity v′(x)
p

v(x)

(2.52)
Note that for a massive test-particle v′

to K has to be less than the speed of light. Then, Eq.(2.52) implies the wanted
condition for a massive test-particle in K : vp < c. In fact, limV→c vp = c and
limv′p→c vp = c. This (re-)states the invariance of the velocity of light in vacuum.


3 From Inertial to
Non-Inertial Reference
Frames
3.1
INTRODUCTION
Inertial reference frames are key elements of the logical structure of Classical Me-
chanics and Special Relativity. However, non-inertial reference frames play a key
role in the path from Special to General Relativity. The purpose of this chapter is
to use these frames to further discuss the physical meaning of the metric of the
space-time and, most of all, to further highlight the connection between geometry
and dynamics that we started to discuss both in Chapters 1 and 2.
3.2
LINEAR VS. NON-LINEAR COORDINATE TRANSFORMATIONS
Inertial reference frames share the properties of being in uniform motion one w.r.t.
all the others. The Minkowski space-time observed from any of these frames appears
to be always homogeneous and isotropic. This is enforced by the Lorentz transfor-
mations [c.f. Eq.(2.17)] that connect them all. Let’s stress again that these transfor-
mations are linear, as they depend only on the constant drag velocity of one inertial
frame w.r.t. another (still inertial) one.
For the sake of generality, let’s ask what happens if we consider a non-linear
coordinate transformation. The line of reasoning is as follows. If linear coordinate
transformations connect among themselves inertial frames, it is conceivable to pre-
sume that a non-linear coordinate transformation should allow one to move from an
inertial to a non-inertial frame. To discuss a concrete example, consider the (iner-
tial) lab. reference frame K , of coordinates ξ α, where the metric has its standard
Minkowski form [c.f. Eq.(2.2)]. Consider also a new reference frame X , of coor-
dinates xτ ≡{x0,x,y,z}, rotating counterclockwise around the ξ 3-axis of K with
a constant angular velocity ω. Thus, we can write the coordinate transformation as
follows:
ξ 0 = x0
(3.1a)
ξ 1 = x cos( ˜ωx0)−y sin( ˜ωx0)
(3.1b)
ξ 2 = x sin( ˜ωx0)+y cos( ˜ωx0)
(3.1c)
ξ 3 = z
(3.1d)
where x0 = ct and ˜ω = ω/c. This is very similar to what was done in Chapter 1:
Eq.(3.1b-d) are exactly those given in Eq.(1.53). Working within a space-time, we

An Overview of General Relativity and Space-Time
have also to prescribe how the time coordinate changes under a given transforma-
tion. Note that Eq.(3.1a) leaves unchanged the time coordinate. At ﬁrst sight, this
seems odd given the discussion we had in the previous chapter [see, e.g., Eq.(2.17)].
However, since time is just one of the four coordinates, it is up to us to decide what
kind of coordinate transformation to consider. In the case of Eq.(3.1a), we choose as
a new time coordinate, x0, the central time: this is the time measured by an observer
on the rotation axis z, at rest w.r.t. the lab. The transformation given by Eq.(3.1) is
clearly non-linear, with the Jacobian matrix given by
∂ξ α
∂xµ (xτ) =



(3.2)
Note that this matrix depends explicitly on the coordinates, xτ, unlike the case of the
linear Lorentz transformations of Eq.(2.12). Given this matrix, we can then evaluate
the metric in the rotating frame X
ds2 = ηαβdξ αdξ β = ηαβ
∂ξ α
∂xµ dxµ ∂ξ β
∂xν dxν = gµν(xτ)dxµdxν
(3.3)
where the metric coefﬁcients are now given by
gµν(xτ) ≡ηαβ
∂ξ α
∂xµ (xτ)∂ξ β
∂xν (xτ)
(3.4)
Note the similarity of the transformation law of the metric coefﬁcients [c.f. Eq.(1.12)
and Eq.(2.10) with Eq.(3.4)]. We will discuss this point in the next chapter from a
more formal point of view. Note also that now the metric coefﬁcients, gµν, depend on
the position in space-time because the Jacobian matrix does. Then, by using Eq.(3.2)
and Eq.(3.4), we ﬁnd [see Exercise A.13]
g00 = 1−ω2(x2 +y2)/c2
g11 = g22 = g33 = −1
g01 = ωy/c
g02 = −ωx/c
(3.5)
Thus, in the rotating frame X, the metric of the space-time becomes
ds2 =

1−ω2(x2 +y2)
c2

dx02 −dx2 −dy2 −dz2 +2ωy
c dx0dx−2ωx
c dx0dy
(3.6)
This expression appears to be more complicated than the Minkowski one [c.f.
Eq.(2.2)]: i) the metric coefﬁcients are functions of the coordinates; ii) the matrix
of the metric coefﬁcients is not diagonal anymore. This is not unexpected, as the
space-time observed from X is neither homogeneous (being on the rotation axes

or not does indeed matter) nor isotropic (there is a preferred direction given by the
rotation axis z).
The transformation given in Eq.(3.1), as the one given in Eq.(1.53) in the frame-
work of Classical Mechanics, describes what happens when an observer jumps from
the lab. on a merry-go-round. Clearly, we must always be able to jump off from the
merry-go-round to go back to the lab. So, we want that the transformation of Eq.(3.1)
admits its inverse. This is the case, as the Jacobian of Eq.(3.2) is not vanishing.
J ≡

∂ξ α
∂xµ

(3.7)
Thus, the inverse transformation exists and it is described by the following Jacobian

(3.9)
To verify that we actually can jump off the merry-go-round, let’s evaluate how
the metric coefﬁcients transform when the observer moves from the rotating to the
lab.frame. Now we have to use the Jacobian matrix given in Eq.(3.8)
ds2 = gµν(xτ)dxµdxν = gµν
∂xµ
∂ξ α dξ α ∂xν
∂ξ β dξ β = ˜gαβdξ αdξ β
(3.10)
where
˜gαβ = gµν(xτ) ∂xµ
∂ξ α (ξ γ) ∂xν
∂ξ β (ξ γ)
(3.11)
By using Eq.(3.5) and Eq.(3.8), it is easy to verify that
˜gαβ = ηαβ = diag{1,−1,−1,−1}
(3.12)
as it should be in the inertial reference frame of the lab [see Exercise A.14].

differential equations. Their solutions are uniquely determined by the boundary con-
ditions on the position, xτ, and the direction of the test-particle (i.e., its four-velocity
dxτ/ds) at some initial time. As it is obvious from Eq.(3.15), the Christoffel symbols
contribute to deﬁne the four-acceleration of a free-particle in the rotating frame.
Finding the Christoffel symbols by using Eq.(3.16) implies knowing where we
came from (the lab. reference frame) and where we ended up (the merry-go-round).
This is clearly not very satisfactory. Fortunately, once we have chosen a reference
frame, it is possible to express the Christoffel symbols directly in terms of the metric
coefﬁcients and of their derivatives in that frame. This can be done by exploiting the
transformation law of the metric coefﬁcients. In fact, deriving Eq.(3.4) yields
gµν,λ = ηαβ
∂2ξ α
∂xµ∂xλ
∂ξ β
∂xν +ηαβ
∂ξ α
∂xµ
∂2ξ β
∂xν∂xλ
(3.17)
whereas multiplying Eq.(3.16) by ∂ξ σ/∂xτ yields
∂2ξ σ
∂xµ∂xν = ∂ξ σ
∂xτ Γτ
µν
(3.18)
Thus, given Eq.(3.4) and Eq.(3.18), we can rewrite Eq.(3.17) in a more compact way.
gµν,λ = gτνΓτ
µλ +gτµΓτ
νλ
(3.19)
Now let’s perform a cyclic permutation of the three free indexes (the last becomes
the ﬁrst and pushes the others on the right). We can then write
gµν,λ = gτνΓτ
µλ +gτµΓτ
νλ
gλµ,ν = gτµΓτ
λν +gτλΓτ
µν
gνλ,µ = gτλΓτ
νµ +gτνΓτ

(3.20)

After algebraically summing these equation (the ﬁrst with a minus sign and the last
two with a plus sign), we get
−gµν,λ +gλµ,ν +gνλ,µ = 2gτλΓτ
νµ
(3.21)
We can extend the operation of lowering a contravariant index given in Eq.(1.17) and
Eq.(B2.1.b) by writing
dxα = gαβ(xτ)dxβ
(3.22)
The identity matrix, δµ
ν, can be formally given by the following expression: δµ
ν =
gµσδ σν. The matrix δ σν must necessarily be the inverse of gµσ, and it is indicated
with the symbol gσν, where both the indexes are contravariant. Thus, we can write
that
gµσgσν = gνρgρµ = δ µν
(3.23)
Having this in mind, we can multiply Eq.(3.21) by gαλ to obtain a self-consistent
expression. We can then state the following.
THE CHRISTOFFEL SYMBOLS
Deﬁnition 3.1. Given a reference frame and a coordinate system, the Christoffel sym-
bols can be written in terms of the metric coefﬁcients and of their derivatives consistently
evaluated in that frame

(3.24)
We leave as an exercise to use this deﬁnition to derive the Christoffel symbols given
in Eq.(B1.2.e) [see Exercise A.15]. Then, Eq.(3.15) together with Eq.(3.24) fully
deﬁnes the trajectory followed by a free-particle in the rotating frame of Section 3.2,
without knowing anything about the lab. reference frame from where we actually
came. Let’s note that the metric coefﬁcients, gµν, describe the geometry of the space-
time as observed from the chosen reference frame. On the other hand, the Christoffel
symbols are deﬁned in terms of the metric coefﬁcients and of their derivatives. Thus,
also the Christoffel symbols know the geometry of the space-time seen from a given
reference frame. So, we can state the following:
THE FOUR- ACCELERATION OF A FREE TEST- PARTICLE
The geometry of space-time, as observed in a given reference frame, deﬁnes the four-
acceleration of a free-particle in that reference frame [c.f. Eq.(3.15)].
3.4
GEODESICS IN A GENERIC SPACE-TIME
The trajectory followed by a free test-particle has a very precise geometrical mean-
ing: it is a geodesic of the space [c.f. Box 2.1] or space-time [c.f. Section 2.10] within

40

which the particle moves. A geodesic is a line of stationary length. Then, in analogy
with Eq.(2.36), we can write

Lds = 0
(3.25)
where the quadratic form
L = gµν(xγ)˙xµ ˙xν
(3.26)
is by construction equal to unity and formally plays the role of a Lagrangian. Here
and below, the dot indicates a derivative w.r.t. ds. Note that for sake of generality, we
assume that the metric coefﬁcients could depend on the position in space-time. The

After multiplying Eq.(3.29) by gτα and making use of the Christoffel symbols’ def-

in Section 2.10, we can state the following:

GEODESIC MOTION IN THE ROTATING REFERENCE FRAME
We are now in the position of evaluating the trajectory of a free test-particle in the
rotating frame X . Given the metric of Eq.(3.6), the Lagrangian of the problem is
given by Eq.(3.26):
L =

1−ω2(x2 +y2)

(˙x0)2 −˙x2 −˙y2 −˙z2 +2ωy
c ˙x0 ˙x−2ωx
c ˙x0 ˙y
(3.31)

The Euler-Lagrange equations [c.f. Eq.(3.27)] provide [see Exercise A.16]
¨x0 = 0
(3.32a)
¨x−ω2
c2 x(˙x0)2 −2ω

¨y−ω2
c2 y(˙x0)2 +2ω
c ˙x0 ˙x = 0
(3.32c)
¨z0 = 0
(3.32d)
We can easily identify the non-vanishing Christoffel symbols by comparing
Eq.(3.32) with Eq.(3.30) . The prefactors of (˙x0)2 in Eq.(3.32b) and Eq.(3.32c) then
provide
Γ1
00 = −ω2
c2 x
Γ2
00 = −ω2
c2 y
(3.33)
The prefactors of ˙x0 ˙y in Eq.(3.32b) and of ˙x0 ˙x in Eq.(3.32c) provide (Γ1
02 +Γ1
20) and
(Γ2
01 +Γ2
10). Given the symmetry of the Christoffel symbols, it follows that
Γ1
02 = −ω

01 = ω

(3.34)
In the non-relativistic limit (ds ≃cdt, ˙x0 ≃1), Eq.(3.32) reduces to
d2x
dt2 = ω2x+2ω dy
dt
d2y
dt2 = ω2y−2ω dx
dt
(3.35)
These are the classical equations of motion of a particle subjected only to inertial
forces [c.f. Eq.(1.56)].
At this point, we can draw two important conclusions. First, as expected, a non-
linear transformation can allow one to pass from an inertial to a non-inertial reference
frame. Secondly, the formalism developed up to now proves to correctly contain the
non-relativistic limit. Note that the classical inertial forces, centrifugal and Coriolis
forces, are now described in geometrical terms as they are embedded in the Christof-
fel symbols. So, let’s stress again what already stated at the end of Section 3.3.
GEOMETRY AND DYNAMICS
It is the geometry of the space-time as seen from the rotating reference frame that deﬁnes
the four-acceleration of a free-particle observed in that frame.
3.6
SOMETHING MORE ON PROPER TIME
We can generalize the deﬁnition of proper time taking into account that the metric co-
efﬁcients can depend on the coordinates. According to its deﬁnition [c.f. Eq.(2.15)],
we can then state the following.

42
An Overview of General Relativity and Space-Time
THE PROPER TIME
Deﬁnition 3.2. The proper time τ is deﬁned as the time elapsed between two time-like
events that occur at the same position in space. The proper time of an observe in xα
writes then as follows
dτ ≡ds
c =

g00(xα)dt
(3.36)
In the case of the rotating frame, we can write the metric given in Eq.(3.6) using
cylindrical (rather than Cartesian) coordinates to get [see Exercise A.17]
ds2 =

1−ω2r2
c2

dx02 −dr2 −dz2 −r2dφ 2 −2ωr2
c dx0dφ
(3.37)
Then, in the rotating frame, the proper and coordinate times are related by the fol-
lowing relation:
dτ =

1−ω2r2
c2 dt
(3.38)
Since ωr is the rotational velocity of a point at distance r from the rotational axis,
Eq.(3.38) is consistent with the time dilation formula of Special Relativity [c.f.
Eq.(2.22); see also Exercise A.18]. Note that if r = 0, then dτ = dt: proper time
and central time coincide, as expected, given that an observer at r = 0 is at rest w.r.t.
the lab. On the contrary, if r = c/ω, then g00 = 0 and dτ = 0. This singularity in the
time-time metric coefﬁcient reﬂects the impossibility of building a physical reference
frame, realized with clocks and rods, when rotation velocities become larger than the
speed of light. So, the chosen set of coordinates cannot cover all the space-time, but
only the region with r < c/ω.
Let’s conclude this section by noting that it is always possible to write a ﬁnite
proper time interval by integrating Eq. (2.20):
τ = 1
c
 E 2
E 1
ds
(3.39)
However, it must be stressed that this integral clearly depends on the integration path.
Therefore, it is not possible to univocally deﬁne a ﬁnite proper time interval: only
inﬁnitesimal proper time intervals, dτ = ds/c, have the property of being invariants.
3.7
CLOCK SYNCHRONIZATION
Let’s consider two observers, A and B, with spatial coordinates xk and xk + dxk in
a generic reference frame. The observer A sends a light signal to B, who receives
it at time x0 and, with a mirror, immediately reﬂects it to A. According to A, the
coordinate time interval elapsed from the emission and the receiving of the light
signal can be calculated as follows. Write the metric of Eq.(3.3) separating the time-
time and space-time from the space-space components.
ds2 = g00dx02 +2g0idx0dxi +gikdxidxk

The world lines of observer A at position xk and observer B at position xk +dxk
is shown for the sake of simplicity in a Minkowski space-time.
For light signals, ds2 = 0. Thus, given for known the metric coefﬁcients, Eq.(3.40)
becomes a second-order algebraic equation for dx0. The two solutions identify the
times of the signal emission x0 + dx0
em (with dx0

signal observation, x0 +dx0

that is, at half of the way between the signal emission and receiving times. So, in
general, x0
∗̸= x0, unless g0i = 0. However, even if this is not the case, we can use the
previous expression to synchronize the clocks along any open path. Unfortunately, if
g0i ̸= 0, the synchronization around a closed path is in general impossible, unless
 g0i
g00
dxi = 0

Thus, at the end of a closed path, the A’s watch can’t be synchronized with itself.

PROPER SPATIAL DISTANCES
Consider again the observers A and B of Section 3.7. According to A, the coordinate
time interval between the emission and the receiving of the light signal is given by

obs)−(x0 +dx0
em) =


−gik + g0ig0k

dxidxk
(3.46)
Then, it is natural for A to deﬁne its proper spatial distance from B as follows:
dℓ= c∆τ
2
(3.47)
Squaring this quantity provides the three-dimensional metric of the purely spatial
sector (or spatial hypersurface) of the space-time:
dℓ2 = γik(xτ)dxidxk
(3.48)
where the 3D metric coefﬁcients
γik(xτ) = −gik(xτ)+ g0i(xτ)g0k(xτ)
g00(xτ)
(3.49)
depend on the space-time coodinates, xτ. If g0k = 0, then the γik is the space-
space minor of the four dimensional metric, with an obvious change of sign. For
the Minkowski metric, Eq.(3.49) provides γik = diag(+1,+1,+1), implying dℓ2 =
dx2 + dy2 + dz2. So, we have now formally derived something we have anticipated
in Section 2.2: the spatial, 3D hypersurface of a Minkowski space-time has an Eu-
clidean geometry. When using cylindrical coordinate,
ds2 = c2d¯t2 −d¯r2 −d¯z2 −¯r2d ¯ϕ2
(3.50)
and
d ¯ℓ2 = d¯r2 +d¯z2 + ¯r2d ¯ϕ2
(3.51)
are the Minkowski and 3D spatial metrics. As expected in an Euclidean geometry,
the length of a circumference of radius ¯r = R at ¯z = const is
¯ℓ=
 2π
0
Rd ¯ϕ = 2πR
(3.52)
On the other hand, in the rotating reference frame [c.f. Eq.(3.37)], the spatial metric
writes
dℓ2 = dr2 +dz2 +
r2dφ 2
1−ω2r2/c2
(3.53)

From Inertial to Non-Inertial Reference Frames

and the proper length of a circumference of radius R at z = const will be
ℓ=
 2π
0
Rdφ

1−ω2R2/c2 =
2πR

1−ω2R2/c2 > 2πR
(3.54)
The interpretation of this result is simple, and it is basically due to the Lorentz con-
traction phenomenon. Consider a measuring rod at rest in lab. reference frame and
tangent to the circumference whose length we want to measure. In the lab, we have
the result given in Eq.(3.52). In the rotating frame, the same rod will be shorter,
and this justiﬁes the result of Eq.(3.54). Remember that verifying only one of the
Euclidean relations is a necessary but not sufﬁcient condition to state that the geom-
etry is Euclidean. On the contrary, if only one of the Euclidean relations is violated,
then this is a necessary and sufﬁcient condition for stating that the geometry is non-
Euclidean. We can then conclude that a spatial 3D hypersurface as observed from
the rotating frame is not-Euclidean.
These results are clearly unsatisfactory. The apparent geometry of the 3D space
clearly depends upon the chosen reference frame [c.f. Eq.(2.2) with Eq.(3.6)]. How-
ever, the space-time is the space-time: can we assess the intrinsic geometrical prop-
erties of our space-time independently of the chosen frame and coordinate system?
To properly answer to this question, we have ﬁrst to discuss in a more systematic
way some elements of tensor calculus that we have anticipated here and there in the
previous chapters. This is the goal of the next two chapters.


4 Pseudo-Riemannian Spaces
4.1
INTRODUCTION
When the dimensionality of a space exceeds the familiar three dimensions of the
Euclidean space, a proper visualization is far from being either obvious or intuitive.
Nonetheless, it is still possible to work by abstractions and analogies, using in fact a
uniﬁed geometrical language. The tool necessary for reaching this goal is the tensor
calculus1. It turns out that the formalism necessary to study the geometry of a space
is indeed independent of the space dimensionality. Also, tensor calculus allows us to
formulate relations that are indeed independent of the choice of the coordinate sys-
tem. The goal of this chapter is to present the basics of tensor calculus by reviewing
in a more systematic way some of the concepts already introduced here and there in
the previous chapters.
4.2
MANIFOLDS
In Chapter 3, we extended the concepts of proper time and proper length of Special
Relativity to the case of space-times where, unlike the Minkowski case, the metric
coefﬁcients do depend on the space-time coordinates:
ds2 = gµν(xτ)dxµdxν
(4.1)
When evaluated at a speciﬁc point P = P(xτ), Eq.(4.1) can be seen as a quadratic
form with constant coefﬁcients. This form can always be diagonalized with a suit-
able coordinate transformation. This implies that the matrix of the metric coefﬁcients
can be written in a diagonal form, with its elements given by the eigenvalues of gµν
evaluated at P. These eigenvalues deﬁne the signature of the metric. We are of course
interested in working with metrics that have the same signature as Minkowski’s met-
ric: sign(ηαβ) = {0,1,3}2. This suggests to extend our investigation to a wider class
of space-times described by pseudo-Riemannian geometries.
PSEUDO- RIEMANNIAN SPACE- TIMES
Deﬁnition 4.1. A space-time is said to be pseudo-Riemannian if its metric is
described by a second-order, symmetric metric tensor, gµν, that locally (that
is, around but very near to any of its points) can be expressed in terms of the
Minkowski metric tensor, ηαβ.
1 Tensor calculus was developed by Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro and his student Tullio Levi-Civita [74] at
the very beginning of the last century.
2 The signature of a quadratic form is deﬁned in terms of the numbers of vanishing (N0), positive (N+)
and negative (N−) eigenvalues of the quadratic form. Thus, in general, sign(gµν) = {N0,N+,N−}.

An Overview of General Relativity and Space-Time
Thus, a pseudo-Riemannian space-time has in general a non-vanishing curvature.
However, locally, it can be very well approximated by a ﬂat, Minkowski space-time.
Curved spaces
The simpler way of visualizing a curved N-dimensional space is to embed it in a ﬂat
space of dimension N + 1. For example, the 2D curved surface of a sphere can be
easily visualized by embedding it in a 3D ﬂat Euclidean space. Consider a point P on
the surface of the sphere, for example, the North Pole. In a sufﬁciently small neigh-
borhood of P—that is, locally—the surface of the sphere can be well approximated
by the ﬂat plane tangent in P [see Figure 4.1a]. This is why we are able to locally
use a very accurate ﬂat map: let’s call it a chart. We can then locally use Cartesian
coordinates, such that the distance between two points on the chart, P and Q say,
is correctly described by the Euclidean relation: ∆ℓ=

∆x2 +∆y2. Clearly, there is
a chart for each point of the sphere [see Figure 4.1b for a point at latitude 45◦and
Figure 4.1c for a point on the equator]. As it is well known, it is not possible to cover
all the surface of the 2D sphere with just a single (ﬂat) chart. So, we are forced to
“tesselate” the surface of the sphere with a large number of ﬂat charts [see Figure
4.2]. Since different charts have their own independent coordinate system, we have
to ﬁnd a way to connect (inﬁnitesimally) nearby ones. This can be done in different
ways. For example, one can imagine to rigidly slide one chart into the nearby one.
We can generalize these considerations to an N-dimensional surface, which is
locally very similar to a ﬂat N-dimensional hyperplane, but globally very different
from it. The mathematical object that formalizes this intuitive picture is the manifold.
MANIFOLDS AND CHARTS
Deﬁnition 4.2. An N-dimensional manifold is constituted by a set of points,
each identiﬁed by a N-tuple of numbers (i.e., their “coordinates”). The points
of an N-dimensional manifold can be locally mapped one-to-one with the point
belonging to a portion of a ﬂat N-dimensional space, where a local coordinate
system has been used. This one-to-one mapping is called a chart.
Pseudo-Riemannian manifolds
By construction, a manifold can be “visualized” as a smooth surface without any
discontinuity. On the basis of the Deﬁnition 4.1, a pseudo-Riemannian space-time is
a (curved) manifold. Given a point P of this manifold, it is possible to ﬁnd a chart—
that is, a ﬂat Minkowski space-time tangent to the manifold at that point. Because of
this, we can easily extend to the manifolds concepts like time-, light- and space-like
intervals discussed in the framework of Special Relativity. In particular, the condition
ds2 = 0 enforces also in pseudo-Riemannian space-times the invariance of the speed
of light.

A 2D spherical surface (a manifold) is embedded in a ﬂat 3D Euclidean space.
The chosen coordinate system is Cartesian, with axes ξ 1, ξ 2 and ξ 3. The ﬂat (dark gray) 2D
plane is tangent to the sphere at the North Pole (top-left panel) at a point of latitude θ = 45◦
(center-left panel), and at a point on the equator (bottom-left panel). Locally, it is possible
to perform a “one-to-one” mapping of the points of the sphere into the points of the tangent
ﬂat planes, obtaining charts of the polar cap (top-right panel), of the center of Turin, Italy
(middle-right panel), or Quito, Ecuador (bottom-right panel).

HOW TO MOVE TO THE TANGENT PLANE?
In Eq.(3.16), we deﬁned the Christoffel symbols in terms of the ξ α and xµ coordi-
nates of an inertial (K ) and a generic (X ) frame. Let’s now ask how the Christoffel
symbols change under a coordinate transformation from frame X to a new frame
X of coordinates xτ = xτ(xµ). It is straightforward to derive [see Exercise A.19]

where Γλ
µν = (∂2ξ α/∂xµ∂xν)(∂xλ/∂ξ α). If the transformation is single valued,
continuous and differentiable, it will have its inverse: xµ = xµ(xτ). It follows that
(∂xλ/∂xσ)×(∂xσ/∂xν) = δ λ ν. Deriving this relation yields

Let’s assume, for the sake of simplicity, that the two frames –X and X – share the
same origins, O ≡O. Then, let’s consider a non-linear transformation to move from

We want to claim that the transformation given in Eq.(4.5) is the one needed to move
from a point O of a pseudo-Riemannian space-time to the point O of the tangent
Minkowski space-time. If this is the case, we should ﬁnd that the Christoffel symbols
evaluated at the origin O of the X frame are identically equal to zero. This would
be consistent with Eq.(3.24): if the metric is Minkowskian, the Christoffel symbols
vanish. It would also be consistent with the geodesic equation [c.f. Eq.(3.30)]: in a
Minkowskian frame, the four-acceleration of a free-particle vanishes [c.f. Eq.(2.39)].

as indeed expected in a tangent Minkowski space-time. We will be back on this
important point in Chapter 6.

VECTOR FIELDS
Let’s consider a pseudo-Riemannian space-time, and let’s choose two different
frames, X and X ′ say. These frames are completely arbitrary, in no way connected
neither with the lab. nor with the merry-go-round frame of Chapter 3. A generic event
in space-time is identiﬁed by a set of four coordinates: xτ in X and x′τ in X ′. The
two sets of coordinates are linked together by a single-valued, continuous and dif-
ferentiable function: x′µ(xτ). When the Jacobian of transformation, J = |∂x′µ/∂xτ|,
does not vanish, it is possible to ﬁnd the inverse transformation, mapping the new
coordinates to the old ones: xα(x′ν). Both these transformations can in principle be
non-linear and arbitrarily complex. However, if we limit ourselves to the coordinate
differentials, these transformations simplify in a very signiﬁcant way.
dx′µ = Jµ ν(xβ)dxν;
dxµ = Kµ ν(x′γ)dx′ν
(4.8)
Here Jµ ν(xβ) ≡∂x′µ/∂xν|xβ and Kµ ν ≡∂xµ/∂x′ν|x′γ are the corresponding Jaco-
bian matrixes, satisfying the obvious conditions Kµ αJα ν = δ µν and Jα µKµβ = δ α β.
Eq.(4.8) highlights an important point: the differentials of the coordinates undergo
linear and homogeneous transformations, whose coefﬁcients [either Jα µ(xβ) or
Kα µ(x′γ)] are evaluated at a speciﬁc position in space-time [either xβ or x′γ]. On the
other hand, the coordinate differentials can be interpreted as the contravariant com-
ponents of an inﬁnitesimal displacement vector [c.f. Eq.(1.2) and Eq.(2.2)]. Then, we
can extend the deﬁnitions already given in Eq.(1.13) and Eq.(B2.1.a) to the case of
an arbitrary coordinate transformation [see Exercise A.20] .

CONTRAVARIANT COMPONENTS OF A FOUR- VECTOR
Deﬁnition 4.3. A set of four quantities V α (α = 0,3) are the contravariant components
of a vector if they transform, on a change of coordinates, as in Eq.(4.8).
V ′µ = ∂x′µ
∂xα V α;
V α = ∂xα
∂x′ν V ′ν;
(4.9)
Consider a scalar, invariant quantity φ. Its gradients in X and in X ′ are related.

∂x′µ = Kν µ
∂φ
∂xα ;
∂φ
∂xµ = Jν µ

(4.10)
Note that in Eq.(4.9) we used the Jacobian matrixes J to pass from X to X ′, whereas
in Eq.(4.11) we used its inverse, K = J−1. The components of the gradient of an in-
variant are an example of covariant components of a vector. So, we can generalize
the deﬁnitions given in in Eq.(1.16) and Eq.(B2.1.e) to the case of an arbitrary coor-
dinate transformation.
COVARIANT COMPONENTS OF A FOUR- VECTOR
Deﬁnition 4.4. A set of four quantities, Vα (α = 0,3), are the covariant components of
a vector if they transform, on a change of coordinates, as in Eq.(4.10)
V ′
µ = ∂xα
∂x′µ Vα;
Vα = ∂x′ν
∂xα V ′
ν
(4.11)
As discussed in the previous chapters, covariant and contravariant components of a
vector can be different, even if they refer to the same geometrical object. As already
seen [c.f. Eq.(1.17) and Eq.(B2.1.b)], they are connected by the operation of lowering
and raising of indices. Thus, we can write
Vα = gαβ(xτ)V β;
V α = gαβ(xτ)Vβ;
(4.12)
These relations allow us to extend the deﬁnitions given in Eq.(1.22) and Eq.(B2.1.f)
for the inner product of vectors [see Exercise A.21].
INNER PRODUCT OF FOUR- VECTORS
Deﬁnition 4.5. The inner product of two vectors is an invariant, obtained from
the saturated product of the contravariant components of one vector with the
covariant components of the other one (or vice versa):
A′µB′
µ = AαBα
(4.13)

Pseudo-Riemannian Spaces
53
Note that because of Eq.(4.12), A′µB′
µ = A′
σB′σ and AαBα = AτBτ. Another inter-
esting operation among vectors is the outer product. It is obtained by writing one
vector after the other, while keeping different indices. Thus, the outer product of two
four-vectors, Aµ and Bν say, will be given by AµBν, a 4×4 matrix. More in general,
we can state the following:
OUTER PRODUCT OF FOUR- VECTORS
Deﬁnition 4.6. The outer product of N vectors will be a multidimensional matrix
with 4 × N components: AµBν..CτDσ. On a change of coordinates, the outer
product of vectors transforms as follows:
A′µB′ν ×..×C′
τD′
σ = ∂x′µ
∂xα
∂x′ν
∂xβ ×..× ∂xγ
∂x′τ
∂xδ
∂x′σ AαBβCγDδ
(4.14)
4.5
TENSORS
Eq.(4.14) allows us to generalize the previous considerations to a wider class of ge-
ometrical objects, the tensors. In very general terms, a tensor is an object with m
indices that transforms as suggested by Eq.(4.14): each index (either covariant or
contravariant) follows the same transformation rule of the corresponding (either co-
variant or contravariant) vector component [c.f. Eq. (4.9) and Eq.(4.11)]. The number
of tensor indices deﬁnes its order or rank. We can then state the following:
TENSORS
Deﬁnition 4.7. A set of quantities T ′µν......ρσ are the components of a tensor if
under a change of coordinates they transform as follows:
T ′µν......ρσ = ∂x′µ
∂xα
∂x′ν
∂xβ ×......× ∂xγ
∂x′ρ
∂xδ
∂x′σ T αβ...
...γδ
(4.15)
Clearly a vector is a tensor of rank 1, whereas an invariant is a tensor of rank 0.
Note that the outer product of two or more vectors is a tensor [c.f. Eq.(4.14)], while
the reverse is not necessarily true [see Exercise A.22]. On the basis of Eq.(4.15),
it is immediate to demonstrate that the sum of two tensors of the same order and
type is a tensor Cαβ µν = Aαβ µν +Bαβ µν. A tensor is said to be symmetrical w.r.t. a
pair of indices (both contravariant or both covariant) if the value of its components
does not depend on the order of the indices in the pair. Vice versa, the tensor is
skew symmetric or antisymmetric w.r.t. a pair of indices (again, both contravariant or
both covariant) if the sign of its components depends on the order of the indices in
the pair. The properties of symmetry or skew symmetry are clearly conserved under
coordinate transformations [see Exercise A.23]. As a consequence, a second-order
tensor can always be expressed as the sum of its symmetric and skew-symmetric

components:
Aαβ = 1
2

Aαβ +Aβα

Aαβ −Aβα
(4.16)
As an extension of Eq.(4.14), we can deﬁne the outer product of tensors.
OUTER PRODUCT OF TENSORS
Deﬁnition 4.8. The outer product of tensors is obtained simply by writing the
tensors one after the other, while keeping different their indexes.
AαβBµν = Cαβ µν
Uρ τV σ γ = Zρσ τγ
(4.17)
The outer product of tensors is a tensor of higher order.
There is another important operation with tensor that needs to be mentioned, the
tensor contraction. Lets’ consider the fourth-order tensor Aµβ γλ. The contraction of
a tensor is obtained in two steps: ﬁrst, by setting equal to each other a covariant
index and a contravariant index; then, by summing over those indices, according to
Einstein’s summation convention. Thus, writing Aαν νλ implies summing over the
dummy index ν that appears both in a contravariant and in a covariant position. The
contraction reduces the tensor rank by 2. In fact, under a coordinate transformation,
we have
A′µν
νλ = ∂x′µ
∂xα
∂x′ν
∂xβ
∂xγ
∂x′ν
∂xδ
∂x′λ Aαβ
γδ = ∂x′µ
∂xα
∂xδ
∂x′λ Aαβ
βδ
(4.18)
Indeed, we started with a fourth-order tensor, and, after contracting over the two
dummy indices, we end with a transformation law proper of a tensor of order two
[c.f. Eq.(4.15]. This leads to the following deﬁnition [see Exercise A.24]
INNER PRODUCT OF TENSORS
Deﬁnition 4.9. The inner product of two tensors is the saturated product ob-
tained by summing over two dummy indices, one covariant and the other con-
travariant.
AαµBµν = Cα ν;
V ρ σZσ γ = Zρ γ;
(4.19)
4.6
HOW TO RECOGNIZE TENSORS
The tensorial properties of a multi-index object can be veriﬁed by explicitly studying
its transformation under a change of coordinates [c.f. Eq.(4.15)]. Consider, for ex-
ample, the Christoffel symbols. We have already seen how they transform from the
X to the X reference frame. Looking at Eq.(4.4), it is immediate to note that the
ﬁrst term transforms in line with the Deﬁnition 4.7. On the contrary, the second term
doesn’t. Note that this second term would vanish if and only if the considered trans-
formation xµ(xτ) were linear. This is not what happens in the more general case of
non-linear transformations. Thus, we have to conclude that the Christoffel symbols

Pseudo-Riemannian Spaces
55
are not tensors. However, it is considerably easier (and faster) to test the tensorial
properties of a multi-indexed object by exploiting the following theorem:
Theorem 4.1
If the inner product of a multi-index object of order n with n arbitrary vec-
tors is an invariant, then the multi-index object is a tensor.
Proof. Consider the simple case with n = 3. By hypothesis,
T ′µν
λD′
µE′
νF′λ = T αβ γDαEβFγ
(4.20)
The vectors Dα, Eβ and Fγ transform according to Eq.(4.9) and Eq.(4.11). Then,
Eq.(4.20) can be written as follows:

T ′µν
λ −T αβ γ
∂x′µ
∂xα
∂x′ν
∂xβ
∂xγ
∂x′λ

D′
µE′
νF′λ = 0
(4.21)
The three vectors are, by hypothesis, arbitrary ones. Then, Eq.(4.21) is satisﬁed
if and only if
T ′µν
λ = ∂x′µ
∂xα
∂x′ν
∂xβ
∂xγ
∂x′λ T αβ γ
(4.22)
QED [c.f. Eq.(4.15)].
On the basis of the Theorem 4.1 [see Exercise A.25], we can immediately conclude
that the metric coefﬁcients are the components of a tensor, the metric tensor. In fact,
if we multiply the second-order tensor, gµν, by two (arbitrary) displacement vectors,
dxµ and dxν, we obtain an invariant, ds2 [c.f. Eq.(4.1 )].
It is also useful, and sometimes even faster, to use a corollary of the Theorem 4.1
COROLLARY 4.1
If the inner product of a multi-index object of order n with a tensor of order
m < n is a tensor, then the multi-index object is a tensor.
Proof. Consider the inner product of a multi-index object, T ′µν ρσ, with an arbi-
trary vector D′
µ. Assume that S′ν ρσ = T ′µν ρσD′
µ is a tensor. Then, the quantity
S′ν ρσ A′
νB′ρC′σ = Sα
βγ AαBβCγ
(4.23)
is an invariant [c.f. Eq.(4.20)], QED.

56
An Overview of General Relativity and Space-Time
On the basis of the Corollary 4.1, we can immediately conclude that the Kronecker
symbol is a tensor: multiplying δ α β by a generic vector, V β say, generates a vec-
tor: V α = δ α βV β. Also, the inverse of the metric tensor is a tensor. In fact, when
multiplying it with the metric tensor, we still have a tensor: gαµgµβ = δ α β.
4.7
GENERAL COVARIANCE
It must be stressed that the importance of tensors rests on their transformations [c.f.
Eq.(4.15)]. If a tensor vanishes in one reference frame, it will vanish in all the other
ones. If two tensors are equal in one reference frame, they will be equal in all the
other ones. Thus, if we write equations in tensorial form, we can use these equations
in any reference frame, without being restricted to the inertial ones. This is clearly
important, but also quite reasonable. In fact, coordinates do not exist by themselves.
It is up to us to choose one reference frame, rather than another one. It follows that
coordinates and frames cannot explicitly enter into the deﬁnition of physical laws.
This leads us to state the following principle.
PRINCIPLE OF GENERAL COVARIANCE
Physical laws must be invariant under any arbitrary, invertible and differentiable
coordinate transformation. So, they must be written in terms of tensor ﬁelds.

5 The Riemann-Christoffel
Curvature Tensor
5.1
INTRODUCTION
In the last chapter, we introduced the concepts of curved manifolds and charts. Cur-
vature is an intrinsic property of a manifold, and any observer should be able to mea-
sure it, independently of the chosen coordinate system. This implies the existence of
a tensor able to describe a manifold curvature. This tensor is the Riemann-Christoffel
curvature tensor.1 The goal of the present chapter is to discuss the main properties of
the derivatives of a vector ﬁeld in curved space-times to arrive at a formal deﬁnition
of the Riemann-Christoffel curvature tensor.
5.2
PARALLEL TRANSPORT IN CURVED SPACE: THE 2D CASE
Calculating the derivative of a vector is an operation to be treated with great care. We
already discussed some of these issues in Section 1.7 and in Box 1.2. Let’s extend
that discussion to the case of a 3D Euclidean space. An inﬁnitesimal 3D displacement
vector can then be written in terms of its components in either the Cartesian or the
polar basis vectors.
d⃗ℓ=dx,ex +dyey +dzez =
∂x
∂r dr + ∂x
∂θ dθ + ∂x

∂rdr + ∂z
∂θ dθ + ∂z
∂φ dφ

ez
=dr er +dθ eθ +dφ eφ
(5.1)
By considering the terms proportional to dr, dθ and dφ, we can write the polar basis
vectors in terms of the Cartesian ones
er = +sinθ cosφex +sinθ sinφey +cosθez
(5.2a)
eθ = +rcosθ cosφex +rcosθ sinφey −rsinθez
(5.2b)
eφ = −rsinθ sinφex +rsinθ cosφey
(5.2c)
since x = rcosφ sinθ, y = rsinφ sinθ and z = rcosθ. As already mentioned in Box
1.2, er is a unit vector, whereas eθ and eφ are not.
Consider the case of a (unitary radius) 2D sphere as an example of curved space.
Points on the surface of the sphere are naturally identiﬁed by their spherical coor-
dinates. So, the position vector of a point P is given by the curvilinear coordinate

Parallel transport in a 2D curved space. The vector ⃗Vin is parallel transported
along an equilateral spherical triangle: ﬁrst, from the Equator to the North Pole; then, from the
North Pole back to the Equator; ﬁnally, along the Equator, back to its initial position. The two
meridians are 90◦away. So, at the end of its journey, the vector rotates by 90◦w.r.t. to initial
orientation.
⃗ρ = θeθ +φeφ. In an analogous way, we can write a 2D vector ﬁeld on the sphere in
terms of its components in the chosen vector basis.
⃗V = V θ(θ,φ) eθ +V φ(θ,φ) eφ
(5.3)
Let’s evaluate the change of these components when the vector is moved from one
point of application to another on the 2D spherical surface. This is done, as in Section
1.7, by keeping constant the angle between the vector and the tangent to the arc of
geodesic connecting the two points. In our case, we deal with arcs of great circles
(the shortest and straightest path connecting two points on a sphere). In particular,
let’s parallel transport a (constant) vector along a closed path taken, for the sake of
simplicity, to be an equilateral, spherical triangle. It is easy to see that, in this case,
the parallel transport introduces a rotation of 90◦of the vector, in spite of the fact
that the vector is intrinsically constant [see Figure 5.1 and Exercise A.26].
From a more formal point of view, the change of a vector ⃗V(θ,φ) when moving
from P(θ,φ) to Q(θ +dθ,φ +dφ) is given by
D⃗V =
∂V θ
∂θ dθ + ∂V θ

(5.5)
We can now use these relations to re-express the derivative of some polar basis vec-
tors in terms of other polar basis vectors. We will of course neglect any term aligned
with the radial direction, as it is orthogonal to the surface of the sphere where we are
bound to be. Regrouping the various terms, we ﬁnally get

MORE ABOUT THE CHRISTOFFEL SYMBOLS
The metric of our 2D (unitary radius) spherical surface is given by dℓ2 = dθ 2 +
sin2 θdφ 2. The Lagrangian associated to this metric is L = ˙θ 2 + sin2 θ ˙φ 2 [c.f.
Eq.(3.26)]. The corresponding Euler-Lagrangian equations [c.f. Eq.(3.27)] provide
¨θ −sinθ cosθ ˙φ 2 = 0
¨φ +2cotθ ˙θ ˙φ = 0
(5.7)
Note that here the dot symbol denotes a derivative w.r.t. ℓ. It follows that the only
non-vanishing Christoffel symbols are2 Γ233 = −sinθ cosθ; Γ323 = Γ332 = cotθ,
where the indexes 2 and 3 correspond to θ and φ, respectively. Now, having in mind
Eq.(5.5), we can write
∂eφ
∂φ = −sinθ cosθeθ = Γ233eθ
∂eθ
∂φ = cotθeφ = Γ323eφ
∂eφ
∂θ = cotθeφ = Γ332eφ
(5.8)
These relations can be summarized in a single expression
∂ei
∂ρ j = Γkijek
(5.9)
Consider now the vector ﬁeld deﬁned in Eq.(5.3) and write it in a more compact
form: ⃗V = V mem. Here m = 1,2, e1 = eθ and e2 = eφ. Eq.(5.4) can then be written
2 See what was done in Section 3.5 to derive, for example, Eq.(3.33)

as follows:
D⃗V = ∂V m
∂ρk dρkem +V m ∂em
∂ρk dρk =
∂V m
∂ρk +V jΓm
jk

dρkem = DV mem
(5.10)
So, we can discuss the derivative of a vector in terms of the derivatives of its compo-
nents, without explicitly referring to the chosen basis vector.
Let’s write the components of D⃗V in the following form:
DV m = dV m −δV m
(5.11)
Thus, we can state that the intrinsic variation of the k-th component of a vector,
DV k, is obtained by subtracting to its total variation, dV k = (∂V k/∂ρ j)dρ j, the
spurious variation, δV k = −Γk
i jV jdρi, the latter being introduced by the “parallel
transport.” The spurious variation clearly depends on the chosen coordinate system,
as the Christoffel symbols do.
5.4
PARALLEL TRANSPORT IN CURVED MANIFOLDS
The extension of the previous discussion to curved, pseudo- Riemannian manifold
is quite straightforward. Let’s consider a vector ﬁeld V and let’s express it in terms
of its components in the chosen coordinate system: V = V αeα, where the Greek
indexes are now running from 0 to 3. The differential of the vector is then given by
[c.f. Eq.(5.10)]
D⃗V =
∂V α
∂xβ dxβ

eα +V α
∂eα
∂xβ dxβ

(5.12)
The derivative of one basis vector can be expressed in terms of the other basis vectors
[c.f. Eq.(5.9)].
∂eα
∂xβ = Γγ
αβ eγ
(5.13)
After substituting this in Eq.(5.12), it is immediate to write [c.f. Eq.(5.10)]
DV α =
∂V α
∂xβ +Γα
τβV τ

dxβ
(5.14)
Remembering the deﬁnitions of manifolds and charts given in Section 4.2, it should
be clear that the extra-term proportional to the Christoffel symbols is due to the
change of the basis vectors when passing from one chart, tangent in P, to the nearby
one tangent in Q: the parallel transport keeps the vector in the tangent planes, but it
changes the vector components. By writing Eq.(5.14) as follows:
DV α = dV α −δV α
(5.15)
we can generalize the statement: the intrinsic variation of the α-component of a four-
vector, DV α, is obtained by subtracting to its total variation, dV α = (∂V α/∂xβ)dxβ,
the spurious variation,
δV α = −Γα
τβV τdxβ
(5.16)
introduced by the “parallel transport.”

COVARIANT DERIVATIVE AND COVARIANT DIFFERENTIAL
Let’s consider a vector of contravariant componentsV ′α in a given inertial frame, K ′
say, of coordinates ξ β. The same vector has contravariant components V µ in another
arbitrary (not necessarily inertial) reference frame, X , of coordinates xν. So, let’s
ask how the ordinary derivative of a vector transforms in passing from K ′ to X .
By exploiting how vectors transform under a change of coordinates [c.f. Eq.(4.11)],
it is immediate to verify the following3:
V µ ,ν =
∂
∂xν
 ∂xµ
∂ξ α V ′α

= ∂ξ β
∂xν
∂2xµ
∂ξ α∂ξ β V ′α + ∂xµ
∂ξ α
∂ξ γ
∂xν V ′α ,γ
(5.17)
The previous equation clearly shows that in general the ordinary derivative of a co-
variant vector is not a tensor of higher order [c.f. Eq.(4.15)]. It would be so if and
only if ∂2xµ/∂ξ α∂ξ β = 0—that is, only in the case of linear transformations. Now,
let’s assume that the magnitude of V ′α is intrinsically constant, so that in the K ′
reference frame V ′α ,γ = 0. Because of Eq.(5.17), the vanishing quantity in X is not
the ordinary derivative, but rather the combination.
V µ ,ν −∂ξ β
∂xν
∂2xµ
∂ξ αξ β
∂ξ α
∂xτ V τ = 0

∂xν
∂ξ α
∂xτ = −∂xµ

(5.19)
So, we have to conclude that the vanishing of V ′α ,γ in K ′ corresponds to the van-
ishing of the so-called covariant derivative.4
COVARIANT DERIVATIVE OF CONTRAVARIANT VECTOR COMPONENTS
Deﬁnition 5.1. The covariant derivative of the contravariant components of a vector
ﬁeld w.r.t. to the coordinate xν is deﬁned as follows:
V µ ;ν ≡V µ ,ν +Γµ
ντV τ
(5.20)
5.6
COVARIANT DERIVATIVES ARE TENSORS
The importance of the covariant derivative stands on its behavior under a transfor-
mation of coordinates. Let’s move from the X reference frame of coordinate xµ to
3 Hereafter we will indicate the partial derivative w.r.t. the coordinate xτ with a comma followed by the
index τ: V µ ,τ ≡∂V µ/∂xτ.
4 Here and in the following, we will indicate the covariant derivative w.r.t. the coordinate xν with a semi-
colon followed by the index ν: V µ ;ν.

Eq.(4.4), we obtain [see Exercise A.27].

This clearly shows the tensorial properties of the covariant derivative. In fact, we can
write Eq.(5.21) in a more compact way:
V µ;ν = ∂xβ
∂xν
∂xµ
∂xα V α
;β
(5.22)
This is indeed in line with Eq.(4.15). Thus, if the covariant derivative of a contravari-
ant vector vanishes in one reference frame, it must vanish in any other reference
frame. If two covariant derivatives are equal in one reference frame, they will be
equal in all frames. After comparing Eq.(5.14) and Eq.(5.20), we can arrive at the
following deﬁnition:
COVARIANT (OR ABSOLUTE) DIFFERENTIAL OPERATOR
Deﬁnition 5.2. The covariant (or absolute) differential of the contravariant components
of a vector is deﬁned as follows:
DV α = V α

The absolute differential of a vector is obtained as the saturated product of the covari-
ant derivative of a vector (which is a tensor) with the differential of the coordinates
(the components of an inﬁnitesimal displacement vector). It is indeed a ﬁrst-order
tensor because of the Corollary 4.1.
5.7
MORE ON GEODESICS
We have derived the geodesic equations in Section 3.3 (by performing a non-linear
coordinate transformation) and in Section 3.4 (by using a variational principle). The
question that we can now ask is the following: why do we have the Christoffel
symbols in Eq.(3.30), if they are related to the variation of the basis vectors [c.f.
Eq.(5.13)]? We already implicitly discussed the point, but let’s render it more ex-
plicit here. Consider a curve xµ = xµ(s), where s is a parameter along the curve. The
unit tangent vector to this curve is V α ≡dxα/ds. By construction, the magnitude
of this vector is constant in every point of the curve: VαV α = 1. So, if we “paral-
lel transport” the tangent vector along the curve (this means parallel transporting the
vector “parallel to itself”), we do expect its intrinsic variation to be null. This implies
writing [c.f. Eq.(5.23)]

(5.26)
This is indeed the geodesic equation already derived in Eq.(3.30). We can now give
a formal deﬁnition of a geodesic in an arbitrarily curved manifold.
GEODESICS IN CURVED MANIFOLDS
Deﬁnition 5.3. A geodesic is a line connecting two points on a manifold. It has two
properties: i) it is a line of stationary length [c.f. Eq.(3.25)]; ii) it is the straightest line
one can draw in a manifold of arbitrarily complex geometry [c.f. Eq.(5.26)].
5.8
MORE ON COVARIANT DERIVATIVE
In Section 5.5, we have discussed the covariant derivative of the contravariant com-
ponents of a vector. We clearly have to extend our discussion to consider also the
covariant derivative of the covariant components of a vector. To see this, in a slight
different and faster way, consider an intrinsically constant vector, initially bound to
xβ and then transported in xβ + dxβ. Because of its scalar nature, the squared mag-
nitude of the vector is unaffected by the “parallel transport”. So, we can write
δ(V αVα) = δV τVτ +V αδVα = −Γτ
αβV αVτdxβ +V αδVα = 0
(5.27)
Due to the arbitrariness of V α, we can conclude that the spurious variation of the
covariant components of a vector at the end of its “parallel transport” is given by
δVα ≡Γτ
αβVτdxβ
(5.28)
After lowering its contravariant indices, Eq.(5.15) yields DVα = dVα −δVα. We can
then conclude the following:
COVARIANT DERIVATIVE OF COVARIANT VECTOR COMPONENTS
Deﬁnition 5.4. The covariant derivative of the covariant components of a vector ﬁeld,
Vα, w.r.t. to the coordinate xβ is deﬁned as follows:
Vα ;β = Vα ,β −Γτ
αβVτ
(5.29)

64
An Overview of General Relativity and Space-Time
Note that after lowering its contravariant indices, Eq.(5.23) yields DVα = Vα;βdxβ.
This deﬁnes the covariant (or absolute) differential of the covariant components of a
vector.
5.9
COVARIANT DERIVATIVE OF A TENSOR
Let’s extend the concept of covariant derivative to tensors. Consider ﬁrst two arbi-
trary vectors, Aα and Bβ say. We want to deﬁne the covariant derivative of the outer
product, (AαBβ);γ = D(AαBβ)/dxγ, by enforcing the requirement that in the tangent
hyperplane (AαBβ);γ →(AαBβ),γ = Aα,γBβ + AαBβ,γ. On the other hand, the met-
ric of the tangent hyperplane is Minkowskian and the Christoffel symbols vanish [c.f.
Section 4.3]. Then, in the tangent plane, Aα ,γ = Aα ;γ and Bβ,γ = Bβ;γ. So, we can
write the following tensorial equation:
(AαBβ);γ = Aα ;γ Bβ +AαBβ;γ
(5.30)
On the basis of the deﬁnitions given in Eq.(5.20) and Eq.(5.29), we can expand
Eq.(5.30) and write
(AαBβ);γ =

As already discussed [see Section 4.5], the outer product of m vectors can always be
written as a tensor of rank m. This allows us to arrive at the following deﬁnition:
COVARIANT DERIVATIVE OF A TENSOR
Deﬁnition 5.5. The covariant derivative of a tensor w.r.t. to the coordinate xµ is obtained
by adding to the ordinary derivative a number of terms equal to its rank, proportional
to the Christoffel symbol and consistent with either Eq.(5.20) or Eq.(5.29), depending on
whether the considered tensor index is contravariant or covariant.

It is easy to show that the covariant derivative of the metric tensor vanishes. In other
words, the metric tensor is covariantly constant. In fact, following Eq.(5.32), one has
gαβ;γ = gαβ,γ −Γτ
αγgτβ −Γτ
βγgατ. Remembering Eq.(3.19), it is immediate to show
that
gαβ;γ = 0
(5.33)
This is not surprising. In fact, in the tangent (Minkowskian) plane [c.f. Deﬁnition
4.1], the ﬁrst derivatives of the metric tensor locally vanish, and with them, all the
Christoffel symbols [c.f. Eq.(3.24)]. On the other hand, the covariant derivative of a

The vectorV α is parallel transported from A toC, ﬁrst passing through B and then
through D. If the space is curved, the vectors in C obtained by parallel transporting the same
vector through two different paths are not the same, because the spurious variation introduced
by the operation of parallel transport depends on the followed path.
tensor is a tensor. So, if the covariant derivative of the metric tensor vanishes in the
tangent plane, it must vanish in all the other reference frames. This is the important
meaning of Eq.(5.33).
5.10
THE RIEMANN-CHRISTOFFEL CURVATURE TENSOR
Consider an arbitrary manifold and choose a reference frame X of coordinates xτ.
In this frame, the metric tensor will be a function of the position in space-time:
gµν(xτ). Now, let’s address a very speciﬁc question: is this manifold intrinsically
ﬂat or curved? To answer this question, consider the vector ⃗V, originally bound to
point A, and “parallel transport” it ﬁrst in B, along the geodesic arc  
AB, and then in
C, along the geodesic arc  
BC (see Figure 5.2). The result of this operation provides
a vector of contravariant components V α(C). Alternatively, “parallel transport” ⃗V
ﬁrst in D, along the geodesic arc  
AD, and then in C, along the geodesic arc  
DC.
The result of this second operation still provides a vector, also bounded in C, but of
contravariant components ˜V α(C) (see Figure 5.2). For the sake of simplicity, let’s
assume the following symmetry:  
AB =  
DC = d(1)xµ and  
AD =  
BC = d(2)xν. Here
the subscripts (1) and (2) are not covariant indexes; they are meant to identify the
different geodesic arcs of Figure 5.2.
On the basis of the considerations given in Section 5.4, the vectorV α(C)—applied
in C—is the vector V α(B)—applied in B—plus its spurious variation δ(2)V α(B) due
to its “parallel transport” from B to C. Similarly, the vector V α(B)—applied in
B—is the vector V α(A)—applied in A—plus its spurious variation δ(1)V α(A) due
to its “parallel transport” from A to B. We can therefore write, with an obvious
meaning of the symbols:
V α(C) = V α(B)+δ(2)V α(B)
=

V α(A)+δ(1)V α(A)

+δ(2)

V α(A)+δ(1)V α(A)

(5.34)

66
An Overview of General Relativity and Space-Time
A similar relation can be written for the “parallel transport” of V α from A to C
passing through D:
˜V α(C) = V α(D)+δ(1)V α(D)
=

V α(A)+δ(2)V α(A)

(5.35)
At this point, V α(C) and ˜V α(C) are two vectors, both bounded to C, obtained by
parallel transporting the same, intrinsically constant vector along two different paths.
Their difference is, by construction, a vector. By using Eq.(5.16), we ﬁrst get

a vector, ∆V α (c.f. Corollary 4.1). It follows that the squared parenthesis deﬁnes a
tensor, the so-called Riemann-Christoffel curvature tensor.
THE RIEMANN- CHRISTOFFEL CURVATURE TENSOR

as the sum of two determinants.

where ,ν ≡∂/∂xν and ,ρ ≡∂/∂xρ.
Note that the Riemann-Christoffel curvature tensor depends on the Christoffel sym-
bols and on their derivatives. This of course implies a dependence on the metric
tensor and in particular: i) a linear dependence on the second derivatives (ﬁrst deter-
minant); ii) a non-linear dependence on the ﬁrst derivatives (second determinant).
So, to recap, we considered an arbitrary, intrinsically constant, vector and “paral-
lel transport” it along two different paths, from point A to point C. Then, we evalu-
ate the difference ∆V α between the two resulting vectors, both bounded in C. Now,

The Riemann-Christoffel Curvature Tensor
67
if ∆V α = 0, then the manifold is ﬂat: the “parallel transport” does not introduce
any spurious variation. But if ∆V α = 0, also Rα βµν = 0. Vice versa, if ∆V α ̸= 0,
then the manifold is intrinsically curved: the “parallel transport” does indeed in-
troduce spurious variations. But if ∆V α ̸= 0, also Rα βµν ̸= 0. It follows that the
Riemann-Christoffel curvature tensor indeed enables us to assess the intrinsic curva-
ture of space-time in a covariant way, that is, independently of the chosen coordinate
system.

We can then conclude that

(5.42)
So, in curved manifolds, covariant derivatives do not commute. This happens only
in ﬂat space-times—that is, for Rα τνµ = 0. In these cases, we ﬁnd the familiar rule:
∂2V α/∂xµ∂xν = ∂2V α/∂xν∂xµ.
5.12
SYMMETRIES OF THE RIEMANN-CHRISTOFFEL TENSOR
In a four-dimensional space-time, the Riemann-Christoffel curvature tensor has 256
components. Fortunately, due to its numerous symmetries, the number of indepen-
dent components decreases by a bit more than an order of magnitude. Let’s see why.
From Eq.(5.39), it is immediate to show that the Riemann-Christoffel curvature ten-
sor is antisymmetric in the second pair of (covariant) indices.

βµν = −Rα

It is quite convenient to evaluate the curvature tensor in the ﬂat tangent hyperplane,
where the Christoffel symbols vanish whereas their derivatives do not. So, the writing
of the Riemann-Christoffel curvature tensor in this (hat) frame reduces to the ﬁrst
determinant of Eq.(5.39).

Although evaluated in the tangent hyperplane, this is a tensorial equation and, as
such, it must be valid in any reference frame. So, let’s rewrite it ignoring the hat
symbol.

This equation provides a relation among the components of the curvature tensor: we
will be back to the implications of this equation just below.
The Riemann-Christoffel curvature tensor can also be written in a fully covariant
form by lowering the ﬁrst contravariant index: Rαβµν = gασRσ
βµν. Let’s work again
in the tangent plane. Then,

where gβν,αµ ≡∂2gβν/(∂xα∂xν). Eq.(5.47) shows that the Riemann-Christoffel
curvature tensor is antisymmetric in the ﬁrst pair of (covariant) indices, whereas
it is symmetric if we invert the ﬁrst with the second pairs of indexes. Eq.(5.47) is
a tensorial equation, and it is valid in any reference frame. Then, we can re-write it
ignoring the hat symbol.
Rβαµν = −Rαβµν
(5.48)
R(µν)(αβ) = R(αβ)(µν)
(5.49)
Thus, the number of independent pairs is M(M + 1)/2 [because of the symmetry
shown in Eq.(5.49)], where M is the number of independent combination of indexes
in a pair. Because of the asymmetry shown in Eq.(5.43) and Eq.(5.48), M = N(N −
1)/2, where N = 4 is the dimension of our space-time. Moreover, Eq.(5.46) provides
an independent constraint on the Riemann-Christoffel curvature tensor components if
and only if the four indexes are all different. This means that Eq.(5.46) provides only
one independent relation, the others being trivial identities, as it easy to verify. So,
in conclusion, the number of independent components of the Riemann-Christoffel
curvature tensor is

6 From Non-inertial Frames
to Gravity: The Equivalence
Principle
6.1
INTRODUCTION
The geometry of pseudo-Riemannian space-times and the physics of gravitation
are linked together by the local equivalence between inertial forces and gravita-
tion ﬁelds. It is this equivalence, known as the Equivalence Principle, that allows
to exploit all the formalism developed in Chapter 3 to describe also gravitational
phenomena. The goal of this chapter is to discuss this equivalence together with its
theoretical consequences.
6.2
THE EQUIVALENCE PRINCIPLE
The classical description of gravitational phenomena rests on the equality of iner-
tial and gravitational masses. The inertial mass describes the inertia of a test-particle
to change its status of motion. The gravitational mass describes the response of the
same particle to an external gravitational ﬁeld. The equality of these two masses
explains why in a uniform gravitational ﬁeld any test-particle falls with the same
acceleration. This equality has one important consequence: it is always possible to
locally cancel the effects of a non-uniform, gravitational ﬁeld by choosing a suitable
non-inertial reference frame. Let us consider the reference frame X bound to the In-
ternational Space Station. X is clearly non-inertial, as it is centripetally accelerated
by the Earth’s gravitational ﬁeld. Nonetheless, astronauts and objects move w.r.t. X
as they are expected to move w.r.t. an inertial frame in the absence of gravity [see
Figure 6.1]. At the same time, it is possible to locally mimic a uniform gravitational
ﬁeld by choosing a suitable non-inertial frame. This is the case of centrifuges used to
separate particles of different masses in suspension. The separating power of a cen-
trifuge is indeed expressed by the ratio of the centrifugal force to the gravitational
one. Thus, we can state the following:
THE EQUIVALENCE PRINCIPLE
“The effects of inertial forces and of gravitational ﬁelds are locally indistinguishable.”
or
“A frame located in a uniform gravitational ﬁeld is mechanically equivalent to a frame
which is uniformly accelerating w.r.t. inertial ones.”

6.3
SWITCHING OFF GRAVITY: THE FREE-FALL
From a geometrical point of view, we have seen that the Minkowski space-time de-
scribes the geometry of a hyperplane tangent to any of the points of a curved four-
dimensional manifold [c.f. Deﬁnition 4.1]. Moreover, we have shown that it is pos-
sible to move to this tangent hyperplane by means of a local, non-linear coordinate
transformation [c.f. Eq.(4.5)]:
xα = xα + 1
2Γα
στ(O)xσxτ
(6.1)
Let’s remind here that X (with coordinates xτ) and X (with coordinates xρ) are
two reference frames that share the same origin, O = O, assumed to be the point of
tangency between the curved manifold and the Minkowski space-time. The transfor-
mation of Eq.(6.1) allows to locally set to zero the Christoffel symbols, so that in O
the metric is locally Minkowskian.
It could be not unreasonable to presume that, in agreement with the Principle
of Equivalence, the same transformation of Eq.(6.1) allows us to move from the
reference frame X —bound to the source of the gravitational ﬁeld—to the frame
X —in free-fall w.r.t. X . To see if this is actually the case, remember that a test-
particle moves along geodesics of the space-time. So, in the X frame, we have

From Non-inertial Frames to Gravity: The Equivalence Principle
73
Figure 6.2
The frame X (dashed black lines) is bound to the source M of a uniform grav-
itational ﬁeld. Its z-axis deﬁnes the vertical directions. The frame X (gray lines) is bound
to a test-particle in free-fall w.r.t. M. The origins, O and O, coincide with the position of the
test-particle at a given initial time, tin. See text.
In fact, the round parenthesis vanishes: the ﬁrst two terms because of Eq.(6.2); the
last term because it is evaluated at the origin O. It follows that in O = O the four-
acceleration of the test-particle actually vanishes as expected in an inertial frame.
To see the problem from another perspective, let’s refer to Figure 6.2, where the
z axis identiﬁes the vertical w.r.t. the mass generating the gravitational ﬁeld. The
origins, O and O, are chosen to coincide with the position of the test-particle at a
given initial time, tin. In the weak ﬁeld approximation, t ≃t, ds ≃cdt, ˙x0 ≃1 and
˙xk ≃vk/c ≪1. In these limits, Eq.(6.2) provides ¨z + c2Γ3
00 = 0. On the other hand,
in Classical Mechanics we have ¨z+g = 0, with solution z = −gt2/2. By comparing
the previous two equations for ¨z, we conclude that in the weak ﬁeld limit Γ3
00 = g/c2.
Thus, the coordination transformation given in Eq.(6.1) yields
z = z+ 1
2Γ3
00x0x0 ≃−1
2gt2 + 1
2gt2 = 0
(6.4)
The test-particle, initially at the origin of X , remains in O even at later times, show-
ing that X is indeed in free-fall with the test-particle [c.f. Figure 6.2].
To conclude, from a geometrical point of view, Eq.(6.1) allows to approximate
a pseudo-Riemannian manifold with its tangent (in O) Minkowski space-time [c.f.
Section 4.3]. From a physical point of view, Eq.(6.1) allows to identify a local inertial
frame, X , in free-fall in a given gravitational ﬁeld.
6.4
“CREATING GRAVITY”: NON-INERTIAL FRAMES
On the basis of the Equivalence Principle, we can also “create” gravity by using a
non-inertial frame, for example, in rotation w.r.t. inertial ones. This is why in famous
science ﬁction movies spaceships are often represented as “big wheels.” The most
striking example is that of the Stanley Kubrick’s movie 2001: A Space Odyssey [see

effects of gravity. It is easy to see that this is indeed the case by considering again
the rotating frame of Section 3.2, with the metric written in cylindrical coordinates

Consider an astronaut standing and still (dr/dt = 0, dφ/dt = 0) as in Figure 6.4.
He/she feels a G-force1 equal to ω2R, where R is the radius of the spaceship. By
tuning its angular rotation velocity ω, it is possible to have a G-force equal to 1—
that is, it is possible to locally reproduce the Earth’s gravity. However, be aware of the
Coriolis forces. They deﬂect any object that varies its distance from the rotation axis.
This is not good for the astronaut. In fact, when he/she stood up or lowered inside a
rotating spaceship, the inner ear ﬂuids would be deﬂected w.r.t. the local “vertical,”
sending continuous contradictory signals to the brain. However, this shouldn’t be a
problem as long as dφ/dt << ω. In Stanley Kubrick’s movie, the spaceship had a
radius of about 150 m and the rotation period is of about 60 s, to simulate the Moon
gravity. With these numbers ω ≃0.1s−1, while a normal walking velocity would
yield dφ/dt ≃7×10−3s−1.

THE GRAVITY CASE: A METRIC SPACE
On the basis of the Equivalence Principle, inertial forces and gravitational ﬁelds can
be locally “confused.” Then, it is conceivable to describe gravitational phenomena
by exploiting all the formalism used, e.g., in Section 3.5 to study inertial forces.
So, let’s proceed as follows. Consider a Minkowski space-time. Imagine to put by
1 The so-called G-force is a measure of an acceleration in units of the gravitational acceleration on Earth.
Thus, a G-force equal to 1 corresponds to an acceleration of ≃981 cm/s2.

An Overview of General Relativity and Space-Time
hand at the origin of a chosen spatial reference frame K a point particle of mass
M. Given the symmetry of the problem, let’s choose a spherical coordinate system:
xτ ≡{x0,r,θ,φ}. It is reasonable to assume that asymptotically—that is, inﬁnitely far
from M the space-time preserves its Minkowski geometry. This will be progressively
lost as we are getting nearer and nearer to M. However, if we are sufﬁciently far from
M, we should be allowed to write the metric tensor in a perturbative way.
gµν(r) = ηµν +hµν(r)
(6.10)
Here ηµν is the Minkowski metric tensor, hµν are its ﬁrst-order perturbations due
to M, |hµν| ≪|ηµν|, and gµν is then assumed to be diagonal. Also, a point mass is
expected to produce a static, hµν,0 = 0, and isotropic, hµν = hµν(r), metric pertur-
bations. Since the metric tensor given in Eq.(6.10) is assumed to be diagonal, we can
write the metric in the following form:
ds2 = g00(r)dx02 +g11(r)dr2 +g22(r)dθ 2 +g33(r)sin2 θdφ 2
(6.11)
Consider now another frame, K ′, bound to a test-particle free-falling in the gravi-
tational ﬁeld generated by M. Let’s also assume, for the sake of simplicity, that the
meridian and equatorial planes of K and K ′ coincide. On the basis of the Equiva-
lence Principle and of the discussion of Section 6.3, the metric seen by K ′ must be
Minkowskian
ds2 = c2dt′2 −dℓ2
∥−dℓ2
⊥,φ −dℓ2
⊥,θ
(6.12)
where the symbols dℓ∥, dℓ⊥,φ and dℓ⊥,θ refer to the proper lengths along the radial
direction, along meridians (φ = const) and along the equator (θ = π/2), respectively.
Due to Eq.(3.48), we can write
dℓ∥=

−g11(r)dr
(6.13a)
dℓ⊥,φ =

−g22(r)dθ
(6.13b)
dℓ⊥,θ =

−g33(r,θ)dφ
(6.13c)
Following the intuition of Special Relativity, we don’t expect changes in the direction
perpendicular to the radial motion of the test-particle. So, we can conclude that in
K the angular part of the metric remains Minkowskian.
g22 = −r2
g33 = −r2 sin2 θ
(6.14a)
(6.14b)
On the contrary, because of the length contraction [c.f. Eq.(2.24)], we expect that
w.r.t. K the proper radial distances writes

For the sake of simplicity, let’s assume that the test-particle started its motion toward
M with an initially vanishing velocity: v(∞) ≃0. Then, v2(r) = 2GM/r. It follows
from Eq.(6.15) that we can write

In conclusion, by exploiting only the Equivalence Principle, we were able to write—
to ﬁrst order—the metric of a pseudo-Riemannian space-time with a point particle of
mass M at the origin.

Let’s stress again that Eq.(6.17) rests only on the assumed validity of the Equivalence
Principle and on the assumption of Eq.(6.10): |hµν| ≪|ηµν|, that is 2GM/c2 ≪r. A
more formal derivation of Eq.(6.20) will be given in Section 8.8.
6.6
THE MOTION OF A TEST-PARTICLE IN A GRAVITATIONAL FIELD
A free test-particle subjected only to inertial forces follows a geodesic of a pseudo-
Riemannian space-time [c.f. Section 3.5]. Because of the Equivalence Principle, let’s
assume that a test-particle subjected only to gravitational ﬁelds should also move
along geodesics of the pseudo- Riemannian space-time described by the metric given
in Eq.(6.20). Let’s see if this makes sense at all. To evaluate the radial trajectory of a
test-particle subjected only to the gravitational ﬁeld of M, let’s write the Lagrangian
of the problem [c.f. Eq.(3.25)]

vide the geodesic equations [c.f. Eq.(3.30)], we can conclude the following:
GEODESIC MOTION
A test-particle subjected only to gravitational ﬁelds moves along the geodesics of a
pseudo-Riemannian space-time.
This is an important result, as it shows how the Equivalence Principle links together
the geometry of pseudo-Riemannian space-times with the physics of gravity.
6.7
GEODESIC DEVIATION
Let’s consider two non-interacting test-particles, A and B say, subjected only to an
external gravitational ﬁeld. Each of them is in free-fall, and each of them follows its
own geodesic [c.f. Section 6.4]. To simplify the calculations, let’s study the motion of
these particles in the local inertial reference frame, X ′ say, bound to the A particle.
In this frame, the coordinates of A and B are x′α and x′α + δx′α, δx′α being the
displacement vector which takes us from A to B. The geodesic equations for the A
and B particles can then be written as follows:
d2x′α

(6.24b)
In Eq.(6.24a), we set to zero the terms proportional to the Christoffel symbols, as in
the local inertial reference frame they are all vanishing [c.f. Eq.(4.7)]. This is not the
case of Eq.(6.24b), where we have to consider the displacement four-vector δx′α of B
w.r.t. A. However, if we consider δx′α as a ﬁrst-order quantity, we can Taylor expand
the Christoffel symbols around the A position: Γ′α
µν (x′τ +δx′τ) = Γ′α
µν,ρ (x′τ)δx′ρ.
Then, after eliminating the zeroth order solution, Eq.(6.24b) becomes

79
Note that the ﬁrst term of Eq.(6.25) is not a tensor. In fact, the second term of the
same equation contains the ordinary derivative of the Christoffel symbols—that do
not have tensorial properties. So, in order to write Eq.(6.25) in a covariant form, let’s
use the deﬁnition of covariant differential operator we introduced in Eq.(5.23). In the
X ′ frame, in free-fall with A, we have
D
dsδx′α ≡δx′α ;µ
dx′µ
ds = d
dsδx′α +Γ′α

It follows that the second absolute derivative writes as follows:

symbols to get
D2

ds2 δx′α +Γ′α
µρ,λ δx′ρ dx′λ

Now we can use Eq.(6.25) to substitute d2δxα/ds2 in Eq.(6.28). We then obtain

On the basis of the Corollary 4.1 of Section 4.6, we can conclude that the quantity
in parenthesis has tensorial properties: the saturated product with three arbitrary vec-
tors on the rhs provides a the vector on the lhs . Indeed, by comparing it with the
Riemann-Christoffel tensor deﬁnition, we can verify that the round parenthesis in
Eq.(6.29) is given by the ﬁrst of the two determinants of Eq.(5.39), the second being
zero in K ′. Eq.(6.29) is a tensorial equation that can be written in a generic frame
in terms of the Riemann-Christoffel tensor.

LINK BETWEEN GEOMETRY AND DYNAMICS
As seen in Section 6.3, gravity can be locally eliminated in the (non-inertial) frame
bound to a test-particle free-falling in a given gravitational ﬁeld. The adverb locally
really matters here. But what does it mean locally? How much local is locally? The
geodesic deviation [c.f. Eq.(6.30)] allows us to answer this question.

Figure 6.5
The motion of two, non-interacting particles in two different frames: a non-
inertial one (left panel) with a constant acceleration along the z axis; a frame bound to the
mass M (right panel). The trajectories of the two test-particles are parallel in the ﬁrst case, but
not in the second one.
Let’s consider the case of the A and B particles that at some initial time have a
coordinate distance δxα and zero relative velocity. If δxα remains constant at later
times—that is, D2δxα/ds2 = 0—then the Riemann-Christoffel tensor has to be iden-
tically equal to zero. But if the Riemann-Christoffel tensor vanishes, the space-time
is ﬂat, as both the Christoffel symbols and their derivatives would be zero. On the
basis of the Deﬁnition 4.1, this means that it is possible to ﬁnd an inertial reference
frame K of coordinates ξ α covering the entire space-time with a Minkowski metric
[c.f. Eq.(2.2)]. In this reference frame the non-interacting A and B particles are either
at rest one w.r.t. the other, or in a uniform motion along straight, parallel geodesics.
On the other hand, the relation D2δxα/ds2 = 0 has covariant properties, so it has to
be veriﬁed in all frames, in particular in the non-inertial ones. For the sake of sim-
plicity, consider the A and B particles at rest in the lab. frame. In a non-inertial frame,
uniformly accelerating in one direction, the two particles would be seen accelerat-
ing in the opposite direction, but always under the condition D2δxα/ds2 = 0. This
implies that they still move along straight, parallel geodesics (see Fg. 6.5a). The con-
clusion of all this reasoning is that in ﬂat space-time the Riemann-Christoffel tensor
has to be always identically equal to zero, no matter what the frame of reference is
and how complicated the space-time metric in that frame is.
Consider now a different situation. At some initial time, two non-interacting par-
ticles A and B, subjected only to an external gravitational ﬁeld, are at a distance
δxα and zero relative velocity. If the gravitational ﬁeld is generated by a point mass
[c.f. Eq.(6.20)], we do expect the A and B trajectories to converge toward the cen-
ter of mass (see Figure 6.5b). But this implies having D2δxα/ds2 ̸= 0—that is, a
non-vanishing Riemann-Christoffel tensor. It follows that the space-time is not ﬂat.
So, we have to conclude that the point mass produces a curvature of the space-time.

From Non-inertial Frames to Gravity: The Equivalence Principle
81
In the light of these considerations, we can now better grasp the meaning of
the adverb locally in the statement of the Equivalent Principle: locally means that
the unavoidable tidal effects of gravity described by the geodesic deviation can be
safely neglected only for small regions of space and short interval of times that is, for
δxα →0. From a geometrical point of view, locally means that we have to remain
very near to the point of tangency between the pseudo-Riemannian manifold and its
tangent Minkowski space-time.
6.9
RIEMANN-CHRISTOFFEL TENSOR IN THE ROTATING FRAME
On the basis of what has been discussed in the last Section, we expect that the
Riemann-Christoffel tensor evaluated in the rotating reference frame of Section 3.2
must vanish. Let’s see if this is actually the case. Given the metric of Eq.(3.6), the
non-vanishing Christoffel symbols are those given by Eq.(3.33) and Eq.(3.34). Thus,
given Eq.(5.39), we should consider only the components R1βµν and R2βµν, all the
others being identically zero as Γ0βγ = Γ3βγ = 0. Given its symmetries [c.f. Eq.(5.9)],
the Riemann-Christoffel tensor has only two independent components
R1010 = Γ100,1 −Γ101,0 +Γ1σ1Γσ 00 −Γ1σ0Γσ 01
R2020 = Γ200,2 −Γ202,0 +Γ2σ2Γσ 00 −Γ2σ0Γσ 02
(6.31)
that are indeed both equal to zero, as it is immediate to verify.
To conclude, we are now in the position of answering the question asked at the
end of Section 3.8. Eq.(6.31) tells us that the space-time observed from the merry-go-
round is intrinsically ﬂat, even if the explicit form of the metric is not Minkowskian
[c.f. Eq.(3.6)]. This result should have been expected: we can always step down from
a merry-go-round to ﬁnd ourselves in the inertial lab. frame—that is, in a homoge-
neous and isotropic space-time fully described by a Minkowski metric.
6.10
RIEMANN-CHRISTOFFEL TENSOR AND GRAVITY
Let’s consider the case of space-time with a point mass M at the origin of the spatial
reference frame. In this case, the components of the Riemann-Christoffel tensor are
not expected to be identically equal to zero. Clearly, we don’t need to evaluate all the
20 independent components of the Riemann-Christoffel tensor [c.f. Section 5.9]. It
would be enough to show that at least one of its components is different from zero.
To facilitate the calculations, let’s write the metric given in Eq.(6.20) in terms of
the Schwarzschild radius RS ≡2GM/c2 and of a new variable x ≡RS/r. Assuming
to be far enough from the point mass (x ≪1) would help in keeping our treatment
to ﬁrst order and to neglect higher order terms. With these deﬁnitions, the metric
becomes

Now, let’s limit ourselves to the spatial components of the Riemann-Christoffel ten-

given by the following expression [see Exercise A.28].

where the Latin indexes j and k go, as usual, from 1 to 3. In order to evaluate the
Riemann-Christoffel tensor, we also need the ﬁrst derivatives of the Christoffel sym-
bols. Given the symmetry of the problem, we restrict to the derivatives w.r.t. x. Then,
we have

The spatial components of the Riemann-Christoffel tensor, Ri jkl, are 81. Because
of its symmetry [see Section 5.9], only six components are independent. However,
given the isotropy of the problem, the number reduces to 3 [51]. To ﬁrst order in x,
we get

It follows that the components of the Riemann-Christoffel tensor are not identically
equal to zero. As expected, the presence of a point mass induces a curvature in space-
time, whose geometry is described by Eq.(6.20).

Part II
From Curvature to Observations


7 Observational Test of the
Equivalence Principle
7.1
INTRODUCTION
In the last chapter, we have shown how the Equivalence Principle naturally connects
the physics of gravity with the curvature of space-time. However, the conclusions of
the last chapter were mostly based on plausibility arguments. The goal of this chapter
is to discuss the observational implications of the Equivalence Principle, as well as
the experimental tests that proved it over the years.
7.2
INERTIAL VS. GRAVITATIONAL MASSES
Testing the equality of inertial and gravitational masses has a long history. The ﬁrst
breakthrough occurred with the classical experiment by E¨otv¨os with a torsion bal-
ance. E¨otv¨os reported his results at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences in January
1889, concluding: “I herewith assert that, if there is any difference between gravity
of bodies of equal mass but of different composition, it is less than one part in twenty
millionth in the case of brass, glass, antimonite and corkwood and it is undoubtedly
less than one part in one hundred thousandth in the case of air” [28]1. E¨otv¨os’s con-
clusion shows the equivalence between inertial and gravitational masses of objects
of different chemical composition. This implies that nuclear and electromagnetic in-
teractions contribute equally to the two masses. Thus, we can say that the motion of
a test-particle subjected only to gravitational forces does not depend on its composi-
tion. New results were reported by E¨otv¨os in 1909 at the 16th International Geodesic
Conference in London, where E¨otv¨os quoted the result with an increased precision:
1 part in 108 [29].
This precision has been improved over the years by several ground-based experi-
ments: in 1935, by Renner, a former students of E¨otv¨os, down to ∼3 part in 109; in
1964, by Roll, Krotkov and Dicke down to one part in 1011 [79]. Very recently, the
CNES MicroSCOPE satellite was able to improve this precision even further. This
space-borne experiment consisted of two differential accelerometers. In the ﬁrst one,
the test masses are made by different materials (one in titanium and the other in a
platinum–rhodium alloy). In the second one, the two test masses are of the same ma-
terial (platinum–rhodium alloy). The second accelerometer provided a measurement
reference for the experiment. The test masses remained motionless with respect to the
satellite inside the two accelerometers. So, they were subjected to the same control
acceleration, as expected from the Equivalence Principle. The MicroSCOPE satellite

7.3
GRAVITATIONAL TIME DILATION
The assumed validity of the Equivalence Principle led us to write the ﬁrst-order met-
ric of a space-time containing a single point particle of mass M. Eq.(6.20) has an
important and peculiar implication: in the presence of the point mass, time doesn’t
ﬂow uniformly over the space-time. Indeed, the relation between proper and coordi-
nate times depends now from where we are [c.f. Eq.(6.17)]
dτ ≡

1−RS
r dt
(7.1)
where RS = 2GM/c2 is the Schwarzschild radius. Note the for r →∞, we have
dτ = dt. Then, the coordinate time used in Eq.(6.20) is nothing else than the proper
time of an observer at an inﬁnite distance from M. However, for an observer that gets
nearer and nearer to M, time ﬂows slower and slower. This is the so-called gravita-
tional time dilation phenomenon, and it has several observable consequences. Many
experiments were designed to measure this effect, with the speciﬁc goal of testing
the Equivalence Principle. Let’s mention here the space-borne Gravity Probe A (GP-
A) experiment. The idea was to compare the proper time of two hydrogen maser
clocks, stable to one part in 1015, one on Earth and the other on the probe. GP-A
was launched in 1976 and reached an altitude h = 10,000 km. According to Eq.(7.1),
the ratio of the proper times measured by the two clocks, one on the probe at its
maximum height and that other on Earth, is given by
∆τ|probe

1−2GM⊕/c2

R⊕

(7.2)
where M⊕= 6 × 1027g and R⊕≃6373km are the mass and the mean radius of the
Earth. As expected, the clock on the probe runs faster than that on the Earth, gaining
≃4·10−10s per Earth second. The results of the GP-A experiment were published in
1980, probing the predictions based on Eq.(7.1) and, then, the Equivalence Principle
with an accuracy of 0.007% [93].
7.4
THE GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM – GPS
In daily life, taking into proper account the gravitational time dilation is crucial for
obtaining a good and useful functioning of the Global Positioning System-GPS.
The GPS is constituted by 24 satellites orbiting around the Earth with a velocity
of v = 3.8 km/s, at a height of 20,000km and with a revolution period of ≃12h.

Observational Test of the Equivalence Principle
87
Each satellite is provided with high-precision atomic clocks that accumulate an error
of 0.86ns per day. At least four satellites are always visible from any point on the
terrestrial globe. Each of them sends a signal with two crucial information: the exact
time when the signal is sent; the satellite position at that time. To ﬁnd a position on
the Earth’s surface, we then need to resolve a system of four equations

where the index i now identiﬁes the position {xi,yi,zi} of the i-th satellite at the time
ti when the signal was sent to Earth, whereas the coordinates {x,y,z} are associated
to a speciﬁc geographical location on the globe.
The positions of the four satellites are known to high accuracy. So, we have to
have the same accuracy in evaluating the lhs of Eq.(7.3)—that is, the difference t −ti
between the emission and receiving times of the satellite signals. To do this, we
need to take into account two effects, each of them affecting the t −ti estimates far
beyond the clock sensitivity. The ﬁrst one has to do with the orbital velocity of a GPS
satellite. On the basis of Special Relativity [c.f. Eq.(2.22)], we have to conclude that
the clock on the satellite is slower than the one on Earth. Since

(7.4)
a clock on the GPS satellite indeed loses 8.17 · 10−11 s per Earth second, yielding
a lag of 7.07µs per Earth day. The second effect has to do with the Equivalence
Principle. The satellite orbits at a height of 20,000 km. Because of the gravitational
time dilation [c.f. Eq.(7.1)], we have to conclude that [c.f. Eq.(7.2), but with h =
20,000km]

Indeed, a clock on the GPS satellite gains ≃5·10−10 s per Earth second, correspond-
ing to 45.65µs per Earth day (larger than both the orbital velocity effect and the
intrinsic clock precision). Both these relativistic effects are actually taken into ac-
count, among others, for resolving the system given in Eq.(7.3) and for locating a
point on the Earth surface with the required accuracy. In conclusion, whenever we
use a GPS navigator we are verifying (and, most of all, exploiting) the Equivalence
Principle.

GRAVITATIONAL REDSHIFT
Consider two observers, A and B, at distance rA and rB from M. Suppose that A sends
a series of N light pulses to B with a frequency νA in a given proper time interval ∆τA.
B receives these light pulses at a frequency νB in a proper time interval ∆τB. Since
the number of light pulses is conserved, we can write that
νA∆τA = νB∆τB
(7.6)

An Overview of General Relativity and Space-Time
Note that here we use proper time intervals and not coordinate time intervals, because
the measurement of the frequency νA (νB) is done in the same spatial position of A

where ∆U ≡U(A) −U(B). So, light climbing out of a gravitational well (rB ≫rA)
is redshifted; light falling into a potential well (rB ≪rA) is blueshifted. This is a nice
and simple theoretical prediction based only, let’s stress it again, on the assumed
validity of the Equivalence Principle and, then, on Eq.(6.17).
7.6
THE LONG GRAVITATIONAL REDSHIFT HUNT
Einstein predicted the gravitational redshift of light in 1907 [19]. Soon after, the idea
was developed to measure such an effect in white dwarf stars, because of their intense
gravitational ﬁeld. These stars are indeed very dense and compact, with roughly a
solar mass in a volume comparable to that of the Earth. The nearest white dwarf is
Sirius B, only 8.6 light years away. The initial attempts to measure the gravitational
redshift of the spectral lines of Sirius B go back to the 20s of the last century [5],
but a reliable measurement of this effect arrived only in 1971, when Greenstein et al.
[41] found a value perfectly consistent with the Equivalence Principle. These results
have been conﬁrmed in 2005 by accurate measurements done with the Hubble Space

Observational Test of the Equivalence Principle

Telescope [8]. A nice review of the experimental efforts to measure the gravitational
redshift of Sirius B can be found in [43].
It is interesting to note that a clever method for the detection of the gravitational
redshift in a lab. was proposed in 1959 by Pound and Rebka [73]. The idea was to
use the total usable height (h = 22,6m) of the Jefferson Physical Laboratory tower at
Harvard University. An emitter and a receiver were positioned at the top (remitter =
R⊕+ h) and at the bottom (rreceiver = R⊕) of the tower. Photons sent downwards
experienced a gravitational blueshift. According to Eq.(7.10), the effect amounts to

By changing the setting, with the emitter at the bottom and the receiver at the top of
the tower, we expect a gravitational redshift: ∆ν/ν|upwards = −2.5·10−15. Combin-
ing the two different conﬁgurations yields a cumulative effect of

Detecting such tiny frequency shifts is not easy. The idea was to exploit the Moss-

resolution. Pound and Rebka reported the following result

in agreement with the prediction of the Equivalence Principle at the 10% level [71].
This result was further conﬁrmed with an improved precision (at the 0.76% level) in
1965 by Pound and Snider [72]. It is worth mentioning that the ﬁrst paper reporting a
terrestrial measurement of the gravitational redshift (although at the 50% level) was
the one by Cranshaw, Shiffer and Whitehead [15], published one month and a half
before the one by Pound and Rebka. An interesting review of the measurements of
gravitational redshift between 1959 and 1971 is given in [42].
To conclude, let’s stress that all these measurements constitute the experimental
conﬁrmation of the correctness of the Equivalence Principle and, then, of Eq.(6.17).
7.7
THE NORDTVEDT RFFECT
Let’s conclude this chapter by further extending our discussion on the Equivalence
Principle. As seen in Section 7.2, we can conclude that nuclear and electromagnetic
interactions contribute equally well to the inertial and gravitational masses. We have
just discussed a number of experimental tests that support this formulation. However,
we didn’t make any reference to the gravitational binding energy W of a body. So,
it is worth asking what happens if such an energy doesn’t contribute equally to the
inertial and to the gravitational masses. Let’s then write the fractional difference

90
An Overview of General Relativity and Space-Time
between the two masses as follows:
Mg −Mi
Mi
≡ε = η |W|
Mic2
(7.14)
This fractional difference, ε, is usually expressed in terms of the so-called Nordtvedt
parameter, η, and of the gravitational binding energy, W = −G
 Mg
0
m(r)dm(r)/r.
Assuming a uniform density distribution, we recover the standard result W =
−3GM2
g/(5R). It is common to take into account non-uniform density distribution
by writing |W|/(Mic2) = αGM/(c2R), where α is a parameter and to the lowest or-
der we assume M = Mg = Mi. In any case, the binding energy is a growing function
of the mass. Unfortunately, for laboratory-sized objects, we are dealing with van-
ishingly small numbers. Just for having an order of magnitude, 100 g of water in a
dimension of 5 cm (a typical water goblet) would provide ε ≃9 × 10−28 (η = 1).
So, to test Eq.(7.14), we have to consider very large masses with a non-negligible
binding energy. We have then to move to planetary scale.
Consider the system composed by the Sun and Jupiter, of mass M⊙and MJ, or-
biting around the common center of mass at distances r⊙and rJ, respectively. If
gravitational and inertial masses are not alike, then
ω2r⊙=
GMJ
(r⊙+rJ)2 (1+ε⊙)
(7.15a)
ω2rJ =
GM⊙
(r⊙+rJ)2 (1+εJ)
(7.15b)
where ε⊙and εJ are the Sun and Jupiter epsilon values [c.f. Eq.(7.14)]. The previous
equation leads to the following relations:
ω2 =

Consider now a test-particle in L, at distances r1 from the Sun, r2 from Jupiter and
r from the center of mass of the system [see Figure 7.1]. We can ask under which
conditions the test-particle can be in equilibrium in L. To answer to this question,
let’s project the gravitational forces exerted by M⊙and MJ along two directions: one
orthogonal to and the other aligned with the r direction [see Figure 7.1]. We then
have

r2 = (r⊙+rJ)(1+ε⊙)−1/3 ≃(r⊙+rJ)(1−1

If η = 0, then the epsilons are zero [c.f. Eq.(7.14)], and we reproduce the classical
result of Lagrange, r1 = r2 = r⊙+rJ: the test-particle is in stable equilibrium in the
Lagrangian point L at the vertex of an equilateral triangle, the other two vertexes
being occupied by M⊙and MJ, respectively. This triangle rigidly rotates around the

L “precede” Jupiter in its orbital motion2.
If η ̸= 0, the triangle will not be equilateral anymore [c.f. Eq.(7.22)] and the po-
sition of the stable Lagrangian point changes [see Figure 7.2]. In particular, we have
ˆr1 sinβ = ˆrsin(θ +δθ)
ˆr1 cosβ = r⊙−ˆrcos(θ +δθ)
(7.23)

On the basis of Eq.(7.22), we can write ˆr1 = R(1 −δr1/R) and ˆr2 = R(1 −δr2/R),
where R ≡r⊙+rJ. Then, to ﬁrst order, Eq.( 7.25) provides

At this point, we can exploit the fact that r⊙≪rJ, as the center of mass of the Sun–

δr1/rJ = εJ/3 and δr2/rj = ε⊙/3. Under the further assumption of having ε⊙>>

For the Sun, α = 15/2 and ε⊙= 1.59×10−5η. So, for η = 1, we expect a value of
δθ ≃1′′, a large value for astrometric standards. A systematic analysis of the Trojan
asteroid’s motion—occurring around the Lagrangian point—provides an estimate of
the Nordtvedt parameter: η = 0.0±0.5 [62] and η = −0.56±0.48 [63]. Both these
estimates are consistent with zero. For completeness, let’s mention other estimates
of the Nordtvedt parameter: one is coming from the NASA MESSENGER mission,
providing η = (−6.6±7.2)×10−5 [39]; few others are coming from the Lunar Laser
Ranging, providing η = 0.00±0.03 (see, e.g., [99]).
In conclusion, we can safely state that binding energy equally contributes to the
inertial and gravitational masses. The term Strong Equivalence Principle is often
used to underline that it applies to all laws of nature, including all the form of ener-
gies.


8 Field Equations in the
“vacuum”
8.1
INTRODUCTION
In Chapter 6, we derived at ﬁrst-order, the metric of a space-time containing a single
point mass. This was done heuristically, on the basis of the Equivalence Principle
alone, rather than using rigorous solutions of well-established ﬁeld equations. Ein-
stein introduced his General Theory of Gravity in 1915, publishing in that year four
papers [20–23]. In the last of them, he proposed the ﬁeld equations of his theory of
gravitation. The purpose of this chapter is to discuss the equations needed to derive
the geometry of the space-time produced by a point mass or, as it is often said, in the
“vacuum”.1
8.2
FIELD EQUATIONS IN THE “VACUUM”: REQUIREMENTS
The ﬁeld equations needed to ﬁnd the metric tensor components have to fulﬁll a
number of requirements. First, accordingly to the Principle of General Covariance,
using tensors, for them to be valid in any arbitrarily chosen reference frame [c.f.
Section 4.7]. Secondly, in the weak ﬁeld limit, they should be consistent with the
Laplace equation, ∇2U = 0. Since g00 = 1+2U/c2 [c.f. Eq.(6.18)], this would imply
∑3
i=1 g00,ii = 0. As a consequence, and this is the third and ﬁnal requirement, they
should be second-order differential equations that are linear in the second derivatives
of the metric coefﬁcients.
All these criteria seem to suggest to adopt ﬁeld equations based on the vanishing
of the Riemann tensor: Rα βµν = 0. This would immediately satisfy the ﬁrst and third
requirements: we have covariant expressions and second-order differential equations,
linear in the second derivatives of the metric tensor components. There are, however,
two obvious drawbacks. First, we would have 20 differential equations [the number
of the independent components of the Riemann’s tensor, c.f. Eq.(5.39)], whereas we
have only ten unknowns [the independent components of the symmetric metric ten-
sor, gαβ]. Secondly, and most importantly, requiring the Riemann tensor to be zero
forces the space-time to be ﬂat, and this is incompatible with the presence of gravi-
tational ﬁelds [see Section 6.9 and Eq.(6.30)]. Given the strong link between gravity
1 In this context, the term “vacuum” refers to the spatial regions outside the matter distribution responsible
for the curvature of the space-time. In this chapter, we will use the point mass approximation.

and curvature, we should still work with the Riemann tensor, but using somehow less
stringent conditions.
8.3
THE RICCI TENSOR
Instead of imposing Rα βµν = 0, let’s require the vanishing not of each of the Rie-
mann tensor components, but rather of a linear combination of them. The only way
of combining tensor components in a covariant way consists in contracting the tensor
indexes [see e.g. Eq.(4.18)]. If we do this with the Riemann tensor, we obtain a tensor
of rank two, the Ricci tensor: Rβν ≡Rµ βµν [74, 75]. On the basis of Eq.(5.39), the
Ricci tensor can be written as follows:
Rβν = Γµ
βν,µ −Γµ
βµ,ν +Γµ
σµΓσ
βν −Γµ
σνΓσ
βµ
(8.1)
The symmetry properties of the Ricci tensor can be highlighted by rewriting Eq.(8.1)
in a slightly simpler way. To do so, let’s ﬁrst note that ∂g/∂xβ = adj(gµν)gµν,β
where g and adj(gµν) ≡∂g/∂gµν are the determinant and adjugate of the metric ten-
sor. On the other hand, the inverse of the metric tensor is given by gµν = adj(gµν)/g.
Then,
gµνgµν,β = ∂ln(−g)
∂xβ
(8.2)
By using this result and Eq.(3.24), we get
Γµ
βµ = 1
2gµρgµρ,β = ∂ln√−g
∂xβ
(8.3)
Thus, the Ricci tensor can more conveniently be written in the following form.

Eq.(8.4) clearly shows that the Ricci tensor is symmetric. So, in a four-dimensional
space-time, it has only ten independent components, as the metric tensor does. The
writing of Eq.(8.4) can be further simpliﬁed when the metric tensor does not depend
explicitly on a given coordinate. Consider, for example, the metric of Eq.(6.17): the
metric tensor depends neither on time nor on the equatorial angle, φ. So, let’s assume,
for sake of generality, that the metric tensor doesn’t depend on the coordinate xβ –
that is, gµν,β = 0. Under these circumstances, the Ricci tensor can be written either
in a fully covariant

The covariant derivative of the metric tensor vanishes [c.f. Eq.(5.33)]. Since,

the metric tensor [c.f. Eq.(5.30)]. Then, gαµ

Eq.(8.8) is valid, let’s repeat it again, if and only if the metric does not explicitly

GRAVITATIONAL FIELD EQUATIONS IN THE “VACUUM”
Let’s consider again the simple case of the point mass considered in Section 6.4. The
metric of Eq.(6.17) does not depend on time: gµν,0 = 0. Then, we can write the Ricci

ds ≃cdt, ˙x0 ≃1 and ˙xk ≪1. Now, consider a test-particle subjected only to the ac-
tion of the gravitational ﬁeld of the point mass. From what we have discussed in
Section 6.4, the test-particle will move along geodesic of the space-time. In the non-

Indeed, these ﬁeld equations fulﬁll all the requirements we have discussed in Section
8.2: they are written in a tensorial form; in the weak ﬁeld limit, they admit the New-
tonian solution [c.f. Eq.(8.12)]; they provide ten, second-order differential equations
that are linear in the second derivative of the metric coefﬁcients.
The ﬁeld equations in the “vacuum” can be modiﬁed by introducing a Cosmolog-
ical Constant, Λ. A positive value of the Cosmological Constant is needed to account
for the present acceleration phase of our universe [see Section 15.18]. To consistently
take into account Λ, we should consider modiﬁed ﬁeld equations in the “vacuum”.
FIELD EQUATIONS USING THE RICCI TENSOR WITH ΛΛΛ̸= 0
Rαβ +Λgαβ = 0
(8.14)
Note that by introducing a non-vanishing Cosmological Constant, we are in princi-
ple loosing the weak ﬁeld limit of Eq.(8.12). However, the values of Λ needed in
Cosmology are of the order of ≃10−56cm−2 [see Section 15.18]. So, the effect of
a non-vanishing Cosmological Constant is relevant only on scales ≳Λ−1/2, much
larger than any planetary scale. Nonetheless, for didactical purposes, in this chapter
we will use the modiﬁed ﬁeld equations of Eq.(8.14).

THE EINSTEIN TENSOR
The “vacuum” ﬁeld equations, Rαβ = 0, may be written in an alternative way by
means of the Einstein tensor:
Gαβ ≡Rαβ −1
2gαβR
(8.15)
where
R ≡gµνRµν
(8.16)
is the Ricci scalar, the trace of the Ricci tensor. Such a scalar provides, point by
point, the simplest curvature invariant of a pseudo-Riemannian space-time. Let’s
write Eq.(8.15) in a mixed form: Gα β = Rα β −δ α βR/2. The index contraction pro-
vides G = −R where G ≡Gµ µ is the trace of the Einstein tensor. Then, by using
Eq.(8.15), we can write the Ricci tensor in terms of the Einstein tensor:
Rαβ = Gαβ −1
2gαβG
(8.17)
If Rαβ = 0, then R = 0 and Gαβ = 0 [c.f. Eq.(8.15)]. Vice versa, if Gαβ = 0, then
G = 0 and Rαβ = 0 [c.f. Eq.(8.17)]. So, in the “vacuum”, both Rαβ = 0 and Gαβ = 0
are completely equivalent ﬁeld equations. If we want to take into account a non-
vanishing Cosmological Constant, we have to use either Eq.(8.14) or the following
expression.
FIELD EQUATIONS USING THE EINSTEIN TENSOR WITH ΛΛΛ̸= 0
Gαβ −Λgαβ = 0
(8.18)
Let’s conclude this section, by showing a useful property of the Einstein tensor. Con-
sider the Bianchi identity given in Eq.(5.52). Contracting over the co- and contra-
variant indexes yield
Rβν;λ −Rβλ;ν +Rµ
βνλ;µ = 0
(8.19)
Raise the β index and contract again to obtain R;λ −Rν λ;ν −Rµ λ;µ = 0 or, equiva-
lently
R;λ = 2Rν

(8.20)
It follows that the covariant divergence of the Einstein tensor
Gαβ
;β = Rαβ
;β −1
2gαβR;β = 0
(8.21)
vanishes because of Eq.(8.20) in all the frames. This is an important result that we
will use later in the book, in Section 13.7.

HILBERT’S ACTION
It is useful to derive the ﬁeld equations also from another perspective. Let’s deﬁne the
action of the gravitational ﬁeld as an integral over the proper volume of an invariant
Lagrangian density, L . The inﬁnitesimal element of the four-dimensional proper
volume, d4Vp, can be written in the locally Minkowskian frame  
K of coordinates
ξ α. The transformation from  
K to a generic frame X of curvilinear coordinates xα
is given by the Jacobian matrix, Jα µ ≡(∂ξ α/∂xµ), so that
d4Vp ≡dξ 0dξ 1dξ 2dξ 3 = J dx0dx1dx2dx3
(8.22)
where J ≡det(Jα µ). On the other hand, the metric tensor transforms as a tensor
of rank two: gµν = ηαβJα µJα ν [c.f. Eq.(3.4)]. The determinant of the product of
matrixes is equal to the product of the determinants of each of the matrixes. Thus,
g = −J2, where g = det(gµν) and det(ηαβ) = −1. It follows that d4Vp = √−gd4x.
We can then write the action as follows:
SH =

L √−gd4x
(8.23)
where the subscript H stands for Hilbert [45]. The Lagrangian density should be a
function of the metric coefﬁcients, so that the variation of the action can provide
second-order differential equations. This would actually be the case if L contained
only the ﬁrst derivatives of the metric tensor. Unfortunately, these derivatives are
associated with the Christoffel symbols that are not invariant quantities. Thus, the
most obvious invariant to use is the Ricci scalar [c.f. Eq.(8.16)]. However, R contains
already second derivatives of metric tensor. It follows that the variational principle
associated with the action SH provides second-order differential equations if and only
if the higher order derivatives of metric tensor cancel out. Let’s see if this is really
the case. If L = −c4/(16πG)R, then,
SH = −

gαβRαβ

The ﬁeld equations should then be derived by a variation principle

The variation of the round parenthesis provides three terms
δ(√−ggαβRαβ) = δ(√−g)gαβRαβ +√−gδgαβRαβ +√−ggαβδRαβ
(8.26)
The variation of the metric determinant results to be δg = ggαβδgαβ [c.f. Eq.(8.2)].
Then,
δ√−g = −1

On the other hand, gαβgαβ = δ α α and δgαβgαβ +gαβδgαβ = 0. Then
δ√−g = −1

√−ggαβδgαβ
(8.28)
Eq.(8.26) can then be rewritten as follows:

(8.30)
where we used Eq.(8.15). The second term on the rhs of the previous equation could
in principle produce third-order derivatives of the metric tensor. However, this term
can actually be written as the divergence of a vector. To see this point, remember
that in the local inertial reference frame, the Christoffel symbols can locally be set to
zero. Then, in  
K , the variation of the Ricci tensor [c.f. Eq.(8.1)] provides
δ Rαβ =
∂
∂xµ δΓµ
αβ −∂

ηαβδΓµ
αβ −ηαµδΓτ

(8.32)
When we move to a generic frame, we have to use the covariant derivative:
gαβδRαβ = δV µ ;µ. Because of Eq.(8.3), the covariant four-divergence of δV µ [c.f.
Eq.(5.20)] can be written in a very compact way
δV µ ;µ =

√−g

The second integral can be transformed into an integral over the hypersurface con-
taining the integration volume V . But, on the frontier of the integration region, the
boundary conditions constrain δV µ to be zero. This implies that the second inte-
gral in Eq.(8.34) vanishes and that the variational principle of Eq.(8.25) yields [c.f.
Eq.(8.30)]
Gαβ = 0
(8.35)
consistently with Eq.(8.18) derived for a vanishing Cosmological Constant.

8.7
THE ACTION FOR A COSMOLOGICAL CONSTANT
To take into account the presence of a non-vanishing Cosmological Constant, we
have to add a new contribution, Sφ say, to the action of the gravitational ﬁeld. In line
with Eq.(8.23), let’s write the action of a scalar ﬁeld as follows:
Sφ =

Lφ
√−gd4x
(8.36)
The new invariant Lagrangian density, Lφ, can be written in terms of an another
invariant, the Cosmological Constant: Lφ = −c4Λ/(8πG). Then,
Sφ = −c4Λ
8πG

(8.37)
The variation of Sφ w.r.t. the metric coefﬁcients yields
δSφ = c4Λ
16πG

δgµνgµν
√−gd4x = 0
(8.38)
where we have used Eq.(8.28). It follows that the variation of the total action Stot =
SH +Sφ provides [c.f. Eq.(8.34) and Eq.(8.38)]:
δStot = δSEH +δSφ = −
c4
16πG

δgαβ 
Gαβ −Λgαβ
√−gd4x = 0
(8.39)
that is,
Gαβ −Λgαβ = 0
(8.40)
in line with Eq.(8.18).
It is interesting to note that the action Sφ can be associated with a scalar ﬁeld φ that
evolves under the potential V(φ). The invariant Lagrangian density of a minimally
coupled scalar ﬁeld is given by the following expression
Lφ ≡
1
2gρσ ∂φ
∂xρ
∂φ
∂xσ −V(φ)

(8.41)
Note that Lφ depends only on the metric and not on the metric derivatives. We can
then use ordinary derivatives instead of the functional derivatives. It follows that the
variation of Sφ [c.f. Eq.(8.36)] provides
δSφ =

δgµν ∂(√−gLφ)

where we have used again Eq.(8.28). The evolution of the scalar ﬁeld φ is described
by the Klein-Gordon equation
□φ +V ′(φ) = 0
(8.44)
where the covariant expression of the D’Alambertian operator is given by the fol-
lowing expression [c.f. Eq.(8.3)]

(8.45)
Now, let’s consider the very simple case of a scalar ﬁeld, trapped at the minimum
φ0 of the potential: V ′(φ)|φ0 = 0. In this condition, the equation of motion [c.f.
Eq.(8.44)] is clearly satisﬁed and Eq.(8.43) simpliﬁes in
∂(√−gLφ)

(8.47)
Comparing Eq.(8.47) with Eq.(8.38) yields
g V(φ0) = Λc4
8πG
(8.48)
This suggests to interpret the Cosmological Constant as an average vacuum energy
density. This energy is not associated with any existing physical system, but it is
rather a form of energy that uniformly permeates all the space. Understanding the
origin of the Cosmological Constant and its role within the theories of elementary
particles is one of the most pressing challenges of modern theoretical physics. This
is particularly so, because the “vacuum” energy density needed to explain state-of-
the-art cosmological observations is very low, ≲6·10−9erg/cm3 [97].
8.8
THE GEOMETRY OF SPACE-TIME IN THE “VACUUM"
Finding analytical solutions of Einstein’s equation is in general a very difﬁcult task.
In fact, even in the “vacuum”, the ﬁeld equations are differential equations linear
in the second derivatives, but non-linear in the ﬁrst derivatives of the metric tensor.
Because of this, they are in general not easy to solve. To simplify the job, it would
be advisable to follow four different logical steps. We have to:
1. Simplify as much as possible the expression of the metric, by exploiting all
the symmetries of the problem and by choosing an appropriate reference
frame;

104
An Overview of General Relativity and Space-Time
2. Write the Lagrangian of the problem [c.f. Eq.(3.25)] and use Euler-
Lagrangian equations to ﬁnd the non-vanishing Christoffel symbols [see
e.g. Section 3.5];
3. Use Eq.(8.4) or Eq.(8.8) to write the Ricci tensor;
4. Use Eq.(8.13) or Eq.(8.14) to ﬁnd the geometry of the space-geometry in
the “vacuum”—that is, the ten independent components of the metric ten-
sor.
• STEP 1: A METRIC SIMPLIFIED EXPRESSION
The metric of the space-time can be written in very general terms as follows:
ds2 = g00(xτ
⋆)dx0
⋆
2 +2g0i(xτ
⋆)dx0
⋆dxi
⋆+gik(xτ
⋆)dxi
⋆dxk
⋆
(8.49)
where the metric tensor depends in principle both on the time and space coordinates,
xτ
⋆. However, it is always possible to redeﬁne the time coordinate by writing
dx0 = dx0
⋆+ g0i(xτ
⋆)
g00(xτ⋆)dxi
⋆
(8.50)
In terms of this new time coordinate, x0, the metric can be written in a very conve-
nient way
ds2 = g00(x0,xm
⋆)dx02 −dℓ2
(8.51)
where
dℓ2 =

−gik(x0,xm
⋆)+ g0i(x0,xm
⋆)g0k(x0,xm
⋆)
g00(x0,xm⋆)

dxi
⋆dxk
⋆
(8.52)
is the spatial metric deﬁned in Eq.(3.43). Let’s use polar coordinates. If we assume
an isotropic mass distribution, we do expect the spatial line element dℓto be invariant
under inversion of the angular coordinates: dθ⋆→−dθ⋆and/or dφ⋆→−dφ⋆. Thus,
dℓ2 = A⋆(t,r⋆)dr2
⋆+B⋆(t,r⋆)dθ 2
⋆+C⋆(t,r⋆)sin2 θ⋆dφ 2
⋆
(8.53)
Without loss of generality, we can also consider B⋆= C⋆. In fact, due to the isotropy,
a displacement of an angle dθ⋆along a meridian (e.g. at ﬁxed r⋆and φ⋆) must
be indistinguishable by an equal displacement dφ⋆along the equator (e.g. at ﬁxed
r⋆and θ⋆= π/2). In fact, in terms of proper lengths, dℓ= √B⋆dθ⋆
φ⋆=const =
√C⋆dφ⋆
θ⋆=π/2 . In the light of these considerations, we can write
dℓ2 = A⋆(t,r⋆)dr2
⋆+B⋆(t,r⋆)

dθ 2
⋆+sin2 θ⋆dφ 2
⋆

(8.54)
We can now take advantage of the freedom we have in choosing the coordinate sys-
tem. In particular, we can choose a new radial coordinate by imposing that the angu-
lar part of the space metric is the same as in an Euclidean space: r =

B⋆(t,r⋆). It
follows that
dr = B1/2
⋆
d lnB1/2

A⋆(t,r⋆)dr2


d lnB1/2
⋆
dr⋆
−2
dr2 = A (t,r)dr2
(8.55)

Field Equations in the “vacuum”
105
Thus, we can ﬁnally write the spatial metric in the following form
dℓ2 = A (t,r)dr2 +r2 
dθ 2 +sin2 θdφ 2
(8.56)
where we dropped the subscript ⋆from all the coordinates. Thus, at the end, the
metric of the space-time can be written in a diagonal form with only two unknowns
ds2 = eν(x0,r)c2dt2 −eλ(x0,r)dr2 −r2 
dθ 2 +sin2 θdϕ2
(8.57)
where eν(x0,r) ≡g00(r,t) and eλ(x0,r) ≡A (t,r).
• STEP 2: THE CHRISTOFFEL SYMBOLS
To evaluate the non-vanishing Christoffel symbols, we follow the same method out-
lined in Section 3.4. So, let’s write the Lagrangian of the problem [c.f. Eq.(3.25)]
L = eν(r,t) 
˙x02 −eλ(r,t)˙r2 −r2 ˙θ 2 −r2 sin2 θ ˙ϕ2
(8.58)
The Euler-Lagrangian equations [c.f. Eq.(3.27)] provide the four components of the
geodesic equations

¨φ +2cotθ ˙θ ˙φ + 2

(8.59)
Here the subscripts r and t indicate partial derivatives w.r.t. to the radial and time
coordinates, whereas the dot sign indicates a derivative w.r.t. to the line element ds.
From these, we can immediately recognize the non-vanishing Christoffel symbols:

• STEP 3: THE RICCI TENSOR COMPONENTS
The metric given in Eq.(8.57) depends on both the time and the radial coordinates.
So, we have to use Eq.(8.4) to evaluate the non-vanishing Ricci tensor components:

• STEP 4: FIELD EQUATIONS
Consider the ﬁeld equations given in Eq.(8.14). Since the metric is diagonal, the
Cosmological Constant must be added only to the diagonal terms of the Ricci tensor.
Then the time-space component of the ﬁeld equations provides
R01 = λt
cr = 0
(8.62)
showing that the unknown function λ cannot be a function of time: λ = λ(r). This
simpliﬁes the writing of Eq.(8.61a) and Eq.(8.61c). The corresponding ﬁeld equa-
tions become

By subtracting Eq.(8.63b) from Eq.(8.63a), one gets
νr(r,t)+λr(r) = 0
(8.64)
with solution
eν(r,t) = f(t)e−λ(r)
(8.65)
Here f(t) is an arbitrary function of time that can actually be eliminated by deﬁning
a new time coordinate, x0′, such that dx0′ = f(t)dx0. With this new time coordinate,
the metric of Eq.(8.57) can be written in a stationary form that does not explicitly
depend on time:
ds2 = e−λ(r)dx′02 −eλ(r)dr2 −r2 
dθ 2 +sin2 θdϕ2
(8.66)

Field Equations in the “vacuum”
107
Now, let’s substitute Eq.(8.64) in Eq.(8.63b) to eliminate νr, and to get a single dif-
ferential equation for λ(r)
−λrre−λ +λ 2
r e−λ −2λr

(8.69)
Here C1 and C2 are two integration constants to be determined by our boundary
conditions. Now, for sufﬁciently small values of r, we do expect Λr2/3 ≪C2/r.
Then, to recover the Newtonian limit [c.f. Eq.(6.18)], we need C1 = 1 and C2 =
−RS ≡−2GM/c2. Thus, in the end, we can state the following.
THE POINT- MASS SOLUTION IN THE “VACUUM”

Λ = 0, the weak ﬁeld limit of Eq.(8.70) leads to Eq.(6.20), derived on the basis of
the Equivalence Principle alone, as in this case RS/r ≪1.

INTRODUCTION
In the previous chapters, we derived a simple and analytical solution of the ﬁeld
equations in the ”vacuum”, under two assumptions: i) the curvature of the space-time
is generated by a single point mass and ii) the Cosmological Constant is not zero. The
ﬁrst to derive the metric of the space-time around a point mass was Schwarzschild
in 1916 [81].1 Schwarzschild didn’t take into account the Cosmological Constant,
introduced by Einstein only one year later, in 1917, in his famous cosmological paper
[1]. The Schwarzschild solution is indeed an exact, analytical solution of the ﬁeld
equations of General Relativity in the ”vacuum”, and it represents one of the main
achievements of General Relativity in the framework of celestial mechanics. The
goal of this and of the forthcoming chapters is to discuss both the impact and the
consequences of this solution.
9.2
THE SCHWARZSCHILD SOLUTION FOR A POINT MASS
The Sun is the dominant body of the solar system, with a radius R@ ≃7·105km and a
mass M@ ≃2·1033g. In geometric units (G = 1 and c = 1), the mass has the dimen-
sion of a length2. For the Sun, m@ ≡GM@/c2 ≃1.5km, implying a Schwarzschild
radius RS@ ≡2m@ ≃3km. Let’s consider as a typical size of the Solar System the
distance of Pluto from the Sun: rI ≃6 × 109 km. So, on a planetary scale, we have
RS@/rI ≃5 × 10−10. On the other hand, observations of Supernovae Ia [66, 76]
and of the Cosmic Microwave Background [70] highlight that, at the present, the
Universe is going through an accelerated expansion phase, described by a non-
vanishing Cosmological Constant. However, the observed amount of acceleration
requires Λ ≃1.2 × 10−46km−2 [see Section 15.18]. So, if we restrict to planetary
scales, Λr2
I/3 ≃1.4·10−27 ≪RS@/rI and the Λ term can be safely neglected. This
leads to the Schwarzschild solution of the ﬁeld equations in the ”vacuum” [c.f. in
Eq.(8.70)]

Proper (continuous black line) and coordinate (continuous gray line) radial dis-
tance from the Schwarzschild radius of the central point mass
Note that this metric becomes singular at r = RS. So the region where r ≲RS has
to be handle with care. This is what we will do in Chapter 12. Until then, we will
restrict our discussion to the case r > RS.
We arrived to write the metric given in Eq.(8.50) by making a judicious choice of
the time and radial coordinates. The coordinate time is the proper time of an observer
at inﬁnity [c.f. Eq.(7.1)]. The radial coordinate is chosen to have the proper length
of great circles of coordinate radius R equal to 2πR, as expected in the Euclidean
geometry.3 However, this choice has a clear impact on the proper radial distance
from RS: ℓ∥(r) =
 r

where d(p)(x) ≡ℓ∥/RS and x = r/RS are the proper distance and the radial coordi-
nate, both in units of RS. Note that d(p)(x) →0 when x →1, that is when r = RS. Just
for comparison, the coordinate distance from the Schwarzschild radius in units of RS
is given by d(c) = x−1. As shown in Figure 9.1, d(p)(x) ≳d(c)(x) for 1 ≲x ≲10. We
can say that in a Schwarzschild space-time proper lengths are “stretched” along the
radial direction. However, at large distances, proper and coordinate radial distances
must become more and more alike, as expected in a ﬂat space-time.

THE “EMBEDDING” PROCEDURE

written as follows [c.f. Eq.(9.1)]:

case.

The 2D surface z(r,φ) embedded in a 3D Euclidean space with cylindrical coor-
dinates [c.f. Eq.(9.7)].
Let’s visualize this surface by “embedding” it into a 3D Euclidean space, whose
metric
dℓ2 = dr2 +r2dφ 2 +dz2
(9.4)
can be written in terms of cylindrical coordinates: r, φ and z. After comparing the
angular part of Eq.(9.3) and Eq.(9.4), we can conclude that r = r and φ = φ. Then,
Eq.(9.4) becomes

The 2D surface described by Eq.(9.7) is shown in Figure 9.2. Thus, the embedding
procedure allows us to show the geometry of the 2D equatorial (θ = π/2) slice of the
3D Schwarzschild hypersurface at an arbitrary coordinate time t. Note that z(RS) = 0
and that we restric our analysis to values r > RS.

THE JEBSEN-BIRKHOFF THEOREM
The Schwarzschild solution [81, 82] was derived for a single point mass—that is,
under the assumption of a static and isotropic gravitational ﬁeld. However, in the
derivation of Eq.(8.70), we didn’t make any assumption neither on the actual size
of the central object (we used the point mass approximation) nor on its status of
motion (e.g. hydrostatic equilibrium). We only assumed spherically symmetry and,
as discussed above, we did a speciﬁc choice for the time and radial coordinates.
From these assumptions followed that the metrics given in Eq.(8.70) and Eq.(9.1)
do not depend on time. We have then to conclude that the Schwarzschild solution

should hold even if the central mass distribution is in a dynamical state. However,
for this to be true, three conditions must be fulﬁlled: i) the central body is spherically
symmetric; ii) it can collapse or expand, but always in an isotropic way; and iii) we
are probing the geometry of the space-time in the “vacuum”—that is, outside the
isotropic mass distribution.
The ﬁrst to demonstrate that this is indeed the case was Jebsen in 1921 [49].4 In
1923, Birkhoff, independently, arrived to the same result.
THE JEBSEN- BIRKHOFF THEOREM
.
The space-time geometry outside a spherical body does not know neither its actual di-
mension nor its internal dynamical status.
There is a corollary to the Birkhoff’s theorem. Consider a spherical cavity sur-
rounded by a shell of matter [see Figure 9.3]. Outside the shell, the geometry is still
given by Eq.(9.1), as if the mass was concentrated at the origin of our reference
frame. Inside the cavity, no matter is present. Then, the Schwarzschild metric should
hold, but with RS = 0: in this case the integration constant C2 [c.f. Eq.(8.69)] must
vanish in order to avoid divergences at the origin. We can, therefore, conclude that
the metric within a spherical cavity surrounded by a spherical distribution of matter
is strictly Minkowskian [see Figure 9.3].

FIRST INTEGRALS IN THE SCHWARZSCHILD SPACE-TIME
According to the Equivalence Principle, a test-particle subjected only to a grav-
itational ﬁeld moves along geodesics of the space-time. So, let’s start from the

These equations show the emergence of some conserved quantities, very useful for

vant factor -1/2) to the angular part of Eq.(1.42). Then, it shouldn’t be a surprise that,
also in the relativistic case, the motion of the test-particle: i) occurs on the equatorial
plan plane, e.g. θ = π/2; ii) exhibits a conserved quantity

ENERGY CONSERVATION IN GR
From what has been just discussed, we can draw a very general conclusion: whenever
the metric, and then the Lagrangian, does not depends on one coordinate, xα say, the
corresponding covariant component of the particle four-velocity is conserved. This
is an immediate consequence of the structure of the Euler-Lagrangian equations, that
in this case provide d

the previous equation reduces to the well-known expression of Special Relativity,
E = mpc2/

1−β 2 [c.f. Eq.(2.42)]. In the weak ﬁeld approximation, RS/r ≪1
and β 2 ≪1, Eq.(9.15)] reduce to the classical expression of the energy, E = mpc2 +
mpv2/2−GMmp/R, modiﬁed to take into account the rest energy of the test-particle.
9.7
THE RADIAL INFALL
Eq.(9.15) has an interesting application. Consider the radial infall of a test-particle
in the Schwarzschild space-time. Let’s assume that at some initial time, tin = 0 say,
the particle is at a coordinate distance rin ≫RS with velocity v(tin) ≃0. According
to Eq.(9.15), we have

1−v2(r)/c2 ≃1
(9.16)
which leads to
v(r) ≃−c

Here we have chosen the minus sign because the test-particle is moving inwards,
while the radial axis is oriented outwards. Remember that in Eq.(9.16), v(r) is a
proper velocity. Then,

Remember that in the Schwarzschild solution, the coordinate time, t, is the proper

particle never reaches x = 1, as the particle would need an inﬁnite coordinate time to
reach the Schwarzschild radius [see Figure 9.4].
The situation is completely different for the observer in free-fall with the test-
particle: for her/him the proper time necessary to cross r = RS is indeed ﬁnite. In
fact, we can write (always in the limit xin >> 1)

a qualitative study of the motion of a test-particle. In the Schwarzschild space-time,
the test-particle radial and transverse proper velocities are given by v∥≡dℓ∥/dτ and

we get

Here the superscript (N) stands for Newtonian. Thus, it is the last term in Eq.(9.28)
that provides the contribution due to General Relativity. Since this term is propor-
tional to x−3 and negative, we do expect quite different and new constraints on the
motion of a test-particle. In order to attack the problem, let’s ﬁrst study the behavior
of f(x). This function has a maximum at xmax and a minimum at xmin given by the

Eq.(9.31) doesn’t have real solutions. The function f(x) has neither maxima nor

9.4a]. Unlike the classical case, there is not any “effective potential” even if
α ̸= 0. In this case, a test-particle coming from inﬁnity is always gravitationally
captured by the central body.

Eq.(9.31) has two real, but coincident solutions: xmax = xmin = 3, where the

Eq.(9.31) has two distinct and real solutions. The function f(x) has a maxi-

librium positions, one unstable in xmax and the other stable in xmin. Note that
dxmin/dα > 0: increasing α moves xmin to arbitrarily larger values. On the con-
trary, dxmax/dα < 0: increasing α moves xmax to lower values. Note, however,
that limα→∞xmax = 3/2 (see Figure 9.6).

on circular orbits that can occur with a radius r = xminRS. The smaller, among the

THE CASE OF A NON-RADIAL INFALL: α >
√

Consider a test-particle moving toward the point mass with an impact parameter b,
an energy E, and a constant h = bv∞/c, where v∞is the velocity of the test-particle at
inﬁnity. For a given value of α >
√
3, the function f(x) has a maximum in xmax. If the
energy of the test-particle is larger than E(xmax) = mpc2
f(xmax), then the particle
will be captured, in spite of having an h value different from zero. In the opposite
case, E < E(xmax), the particle will return back to inﬁnity. This is what expected in
the Newtonian case for a particle with a non-vanishing angular momentum.
In the parabolic case, E ≃mpc2, as v∞≃0 and limr→∞g00(r) ≃1 [c.f. Eq.(9.15)].
Consider now, for sake of simplicity, the case of a test-particle with α = 2. The
maximum of the function f(x) occurs in this case at xmax = 2, where f(xmax) = 1
and, then, E(xmax) = mpc2 [c.f. Eq.(9.28)]. It follows that a particle in a parabolic
motion toward M will return to inﬁnity if α > 2. In this case, in fact, f(xmax) > 1 and
E(xmax) > mpc2. On the contrary, the same parabolic particle will be captured by the
central mass if α < 2, as in this case f(xmax) < 1 and E(xmax) < mpc2 [see Figure
9.7].
To conclude, let’s deﬁne a cross section σ ≡πb2 for the capture of particles by
the central point mass. From the deﬁnition of α, it follows that for α ≤2 we have
bv∞/c ≤2RS. Then,

PHOTONS IN THE SCHWARZSCHILD SPACE-TIME
We can extend the considerations of the previous section to study photons traveling
in a Schwarzschild space-time. Of course we don’t have a Newtonian analogous.

120
An Overview of General Relativity and Space-Time
However, we can still use the same formalism of the previous sections, after substi-
tuting the energy of the test-particle, mpc2/

1−β 2, with the energy of the photon,
hν. Consider the angular momentum of a test particle: L = mpch, which reduces to

can write Eq.(9.15) as follows:

The rhs of the previous equation plays the role of an “effective potential” [see Figure

3RS/2. It
is interesting to note that the photon radial velocity vanishes for r = rmin and b = bmin
[c.f. Eq.(9.41)]. Thus, a photon can be in a circular, although unstable, orbit of radius
rmin, a result similar to the one obtained in Section 9.9 for a massive test-particle.
Note that bmin constitutes an important threshold, for the incoming photon to be
captured and for outgoing photon to escape to inﬁnity.
Let’s discuss the case of outgoing photons, emitted in the region RS < r < 3RS/2.
Such photons can escape to inﬁnity only if b ≤bmin [see Figure 9.8]. To be more

10 The Classical Tests of
General Relativity
10.1
INTRODUCTION
The importance of the Schwarzschild solution stands on two pillars. From the theo-
retical side, it has been the ﬁrst analytical solution of the ﬁeld equations for the point
mass approximation. From the experimental side, it was crucial to verify the predic-
tions of General Relativity against the extremely precise, astronomical observations
of our Solar system. The goal of this chapter is to present and discuss three classical
tests of General Relativity. The other ones, based on the gravitational time dilation
and the gravitational redshift, can indeed be considered tests of the Equivalence Prin-
ciple and, as such, they were presented and discussed in Chapter 6.
10.2
PLANETARY MOTION
As discussed in the last chapter, the motion of a test-particle in a Schwarzschild
space-time can be qualitatively understood in terms of three constraints: i) the pla-
nar nature of the orbit; ii) the energy conservation; and iii) the conservation of the
relativistic angular momentum per unit mass. Stable orbits can occur around the
minima of the effective potential [see Figure 9.5c]. They can be either circular [see
Section 9.9] or “elliptical”. In order to better understand why the term “elliptical”
is between quote marks, we have to fully resolve the problem of the orbital motion
of a test-particle in a Schwarzschild geometry. We could do it by using the results
of Section 9.5 and by resolving the Euler-Lagrangian equations also for the radial
component of the geodesic equation. However, for the sake of simplicity, let’s ex-
ploit the Lagrangian of the test-particle, which is by deﬁnition normalized to unity
[c.f. Eq.(3.25) and Eq.(9.1)]

This is somehow equivalent to what was done in Chapter 1, where we used the energy
conservation to ﬁnd the solution for the radial coordinate [c.f. Section 1.11]. As done
in the classical case, let’s deﬁne a new variable u[ϕ(t)] = r−1(ϕ,t) and its partial
derivative u′ ≡∂u/∂φ. Then,

This is very similar to Eq.(1.11), a part from the obvious substitutions; ds →cdt and
h →H/c. Thus, Eq.(10.1) becomes

(10.3)
where we used Eq.(9.12). Unfortunately, this is a non-linear differential equation in
our unknown u(φ), that is not easy to handle analytically. Then, instead of explic-
itly resolving this equation, let’s derive it w.r.t. ϕ. Each term will be proportional to
u′, that we can eliminate as we are not interested to circular solutions in the con-
text of planetary orbits. So, at the end, Eq.(10.3) yields the following second-order
differential equation.
u′′ +u = GM
c2h2 +3GM
c2 u2
(10.4)
Note that the ﬁrst term on the rhs contains the classical solution: in fact, in the weak-
ﬁeld limit, ch ≃H [c.f. Eq.(9.11)]. So, the novelty introduced by General Relativity
is all included in the second term on the rhs of Eq.(10.4). In the case under study,
this term is small w.r.t. the classical one. In fact, in the case of our planetary system,

makes sense to resolve Eq.(10.4) following a perturbative approach. So, after deﬁn-

we can rewrite Eq.(10.4) as follows:
u′′ +u = A+ ε

(10.7)
We want to ﬁnd perturbative solutions to ﬁrst order in ε:
u = u0 +εv
(10.8)
So let’s use the last equation in Eq.(10.7) to write (u0+εv)′′+(u0+εv) = A+εu2
0/A.
Note that, to keep the ﬁrst order in ε, we have to consider the zeroth order solution
for u in the last term on the rhs of Eq.(10.7). Now, for ε →0, we recover the classical
result [c.f. Eq.(1.51)]:
u0 = A+Bcosϕ
(10.9)
After eliminating the zeroth order solution, we are left with the following differential
equation:

A particular solution of this equation is given by [see Exercise A.29]

As in the classical case [c.f. Eq.(1.51)], there is a constant term, now given by the
Newtonian solution plus a small relativistic correction, proportional to ε: K = A +
ε(A + B2/2A). The second term, also provided by General Relativity, is periodic in

cos2ϕ. The third term is the classical one, while the fourth
provides another relativistic correction. These two terms can be combined together
to provide Bcos[(1−ε)ϕ] –that is, a non-periodic function of ϕ. At last, we can write
u(ϕ) = K +εP(ϕ)+Bcos[(1−ε)ϕ]
(10.13)
The point of least distance from the Sun, the perihelion, is obtained by minimizing
r—that is, by maximizing u. This requires cos[(1−ε)ϕ] = 1, (1−ε)ϕ = 2πn or, to
ﬁrst order, ϕ ≃2πn(1 + ε). Now, choose ϕ = 0 to identify the perihelion at some
given initial time. After the completion of one orbit, ϕ = 2π: note that we are not
yet back to the perihelion. The perihelion is indeed reached when ϕ = 2π + ∆ϕ. In
other words, at each round of the planet around the Sun, the angular position of the
perihelion moves by an angle
∆ϕ = 2πε
(10.14)
This is the so-called perihelion shift. Note that because of this effect, the orbit of the
planet is not a closed ellipse, as in the classical case, but rather an open, “elliptical”
trajectory that never closes on itself. This is what produce the so-called Rosette orbit
[see Figure 10.1].
10.3
THE PERIHELION SHIFT OF MERCURY
In order to maximize the relativistic effects, it would be advisable to study the planet
with the larger orbital velocity [c.f. Eq.(10.5)]. Because of the Second Kepler’s law,
this requirement is obtained by studying the orbit of the inner planet, Mercury. It
must be stressed that from an observational point of view, studying Mercury is not
an easy task. The best time to observe it is either at the sunset or at the sunrise. In spite
of these difﬁculties, the orbit of Mercury is known to great accuracy: the position of
maximum approach to the Sun moves by 574′′ every century [14]. A perihelion shift
is naturally expected, even in a Newtonian framework, once one takes into account
the presence, and the relative gravitational effects, of all the other planets. Celestial
mechanics, fully based on Newtonian theory of gravity, was able to enucleate these

contributions: 278′′/century due to Venus; 153′′/century due to Jupiter; 90′′/century
due to the Earth; 10′′/century due to all the other planets. Summing up, the total
shift that celestial mechanics could explain considering the effects of all the planets
is of 531′′/century, still far from what observed. The difference is measured with
extremely high precision: (42.980±0.001)′′/century (see e.g. [67]). Let’s calculate
what Eq.(10.14) provides in the case of Mercury

where rM = 5.8×107 km, vM = 47.36 km/s, and TM = 88 days are the radius of the
orbit, the orbital velocity, and the revolution period of Mercury. Using Eq.(10.15)
with the orbital parameters of Mercury and with RS⊙≃3 km for the Sun, one ﬁnds
that General Relativity predicts a shift of the perihelion of Mercury of 43′′ per cen-
tury, in spectacular agreement with the observations [14]. It is interesting to note
that the ﬁrst to report on the slow precession of Mercury’s orbit around the Sun was
Urbain Le Verrier, known for having predicted the existence of Neptune. Le Ver-
rier clearly presented, back in 1859, the difﬁculty to explain the perihelion shift of
Mercury in terms of the perturbations induced by the known planets [55].
10.4
LIGHT RAY’S DEFLECTION
In Section 10.2, we derived the equation of motion of a massive test-particle in
a Schwarzschild space-time. We didn’t consider circular orbits and we landed to
Eq.(10.4) to describe the planetary motions. We may now ask what happens if we
consider photons instead of test-particles. In Section 9.7, we have already discussed,

The Classical Tests of General Relativity
127
although qualitatively, how photons can move in a Schwarzschild space-time. Here
we want to discuss a more speciﬁc conﬁguration that was studied and used to provide
another classical test of General Relativity, the deﬂection of light. So, let’s go back
to Eq.(10.4) to note that the classical term, the ﬁrst one on the rhs, can be rewritten
in the following form

2
(10.16)
Now, if we follow a light ray along its trajectory, dϕ ̸= 0. However, since photons
move along null geodesics, ds = 0. So, it is reasonable to assume that the equation
describing a light ray propagation in a Schwarzschild space-time is given by:
u′′ +u = 3
2RSu2
(10.17)
as the ﬁrst term on the rhs of Eq.(10.4) vanishes. A more formal derivation of
Eq.(10.17) is given in Box 10.1 Note that Eq.(10.17), as already discussed in Section
9.7, shows the possibility for a photon to be in circular orbit at a distance r = 3RS/2
from the point mass. Note also that it is the rhs term in Eq.(10.17) that contains the
relativistic correction. Then, neglecting this term, we should recover the classical
result. Indeed, in this limit, Eq.(10.17) reduces to u′′
0 +u0 = 0, with solution
u0 = 1
b cosϕ
(10.18)
Here b is the classical impact parameter, and we set ϕ = 0 at the point of maximum
approach to the central body (see Figure 10.2). Eq.(10.18) states that, in the classical
limit, light rays propagate along straight lines. We can rephrase this statement saying
that free-streaming photons propagate along geodesics of the Minkowski space-time
that are indeed straight lines. At great distances from the central body, limr→∞u0 = 0.
This implies that incoming and outgoing light rays have ϕ−∞= −π/2 and ϕ+∞=
+π/2, respectively (see Figure 10.2).
Before resolving the relativistic case, note that on planetary scales the term on the
rhs of Eq.(10.17) is expected to be small w.r.t. u. In fact, the ratio of these two terms
provides

For the Sun, RS@ ≃3 km. Even if the light travels passing on the verge of Sun’s
photosphere, RS@/R@ ≃10−6, as the Sun’s radius is R@ ≃700,000 km. This allows
us to look for a solution of Eq.(10.17) in a perturbative way. Let’s write again u =

(10.22)
which is satisﬁed if α +2β = 0 and −3β = 1/b. This implies α = 2/(3b) and β =

Light moves along geodesic of the Schwarzschild space-time, which is curved.
Light is then deﬂected by an angle δφ = RS/rmin. Because of this effect, the apparent position
of a source in the sky changes by an angle ∆φ = 2δφ, see text.
The closest approach to the Sun, rmin, is no longer given by the classical impact
parameter b, since we have to take into account the relativistic correction, even if it
is small. Indeed, when ϕ = 0, rmin = b(1−ε/3) [see Figure 10.2]. Now, by deﬁnition,
limr→∞u = 0. In this limit, Eq.(10.23) provides a second-order algebraic equation in

The ﬁrst conclusion is that light rays do not propagate along straight lines. This
result is expected on the basis of the Equivalence Principle: free test-particles and
free-streaming photons move along geodesic of a curved, pseudo-Riemannian space-
time, that are not straight lines. This is indeed the case of the Schwarzschild space-
time. The second point is that if we are inﬁnitely far from the central body and we
see the light coming from direction ϕ+∞, we associate this virtual angular position

ϕ+∞−ϕ−∞, is therefore given by (see Figure 10.2)
∆ϕ ≡= 2 RS

Inserting the appropriate values for the Sun, RS@ = 2.96 km and rmin ≃R@ =

(10.29)
again perfectly consistent with the observations. These started in 1919, just after the
ﬁrst World War, with the work by Eddington and collaborators [95], providing the
correct result but with an uncertainty of about 30%. This was taken as an experi-
mental test of Einstein new theory of gravity. More recently, VLBI light deﬂection
measurements provide consistency with the General Relativity prediction with a pre-
cision of ﬁve parts in 1000 [78].
10.5
GRAVITATIONAL LENSING
The deﬂection of light is not just one of the classic tests of General Relativity. In fact,
it has become a very useful tool to study very distant objects. Before discussing this
point, let’s introduce the concept of angular diameter distance. Consider a ruler in
the equatorial plane (θ = π/2), disposed perpendicularly to the line of sight. If φ is
the angle subtended by the ruler, then the angular diameter distance is deﬁned to be:
D = ℓ⊥/φ, where ℓ⊥is the transverse proper length of the ruler. In the Schwarzschild
space-time ℓ⊥= rφ. So, the angular diameter distance coincide with the coordinate
distance r. This is in general not true for space-times characterized by different met-
rics, as in the case of a Friedman metric [see Section 15.16]. So, for sake of general-
ity, let’s then indicate D as the angular diameter distances.
Consider now the conﬁguration of Figure 10.3. There is a background source S, a
foreground spherical mass distribution M, and an observer O. The source, the mass
M, and the observer are all on the same equatorial plane θ = π/2. The observer is
at the origin of the chosen polar coordinate system. The foreground mass M is at
an angular diameter distance DM on the polar axis φ = 0. The background source
is at an angular diameter distance DSM and DS from the mass M and from the ob-
server, respectively. In the absence of any deﬂection, we should observe the source
where it actually is, in the angular direction φ = σ. However, we know that in the
Schwarzschild space-time light is deﬂected. The foreground object M acts then as a
gravitational lens: let’s call it the lens. As derived in the previous section, the lens
induces a deﬂection angle ∆φ = 2RS/b, where b is the impact parameter [see Fig-
ure 10.3]. Let’s assume, as it is often the case, that the background source is very
far away from the lens, and that the latter is very far away from the observer. Then,
both DSM and DM are much larger than the impact parameter b. In this situation,
the light emitted by the source spends most of its time to go from the source to the
lens, and from the lens to the observer, but very little time to be deﬂected. Let’s

A background source S, a point mass M, and the observer O are in the equatorial
plane of the chosen polar coordinate system (i.e. θ = π/2). The point mass is on the polar axis,
whereas σ and φobs are the angular positions in the sky of the source S and of its lensed image.
The deﬂection of light is shown by the gray line SB and BO. The quantity b = MB deﬁnes the
impact parameter, see text.
then consider that the deﬂection occurs instantaneously at the time of maximum ap-
proach to the lens, that is, at the point B of Figure 10.3. This is the so-called thin lens
approximation.
Because of the deﬂection, the observer will see the source in the position S′, an
angle φobs away from the lens. Clearly, φobs and the deﬂection angle ∆φ are related.
In our thin lens approximation, SB ≃DSM and BO ≃DM, as γ →π/2 and σ →0
[see Figure 10.3]. Then, DSδσ ≃DSM∆φ. Being φobs = σ +δσ, we have
σ = φobs −∆φ DSM
DS
(10.30)
The deﬂection angle can be written as ∆φ = 2RS/(DMφobs), as, in the thin lens
approximation, b ≃DMφobs. Then, the scalar lens equation can be written as follows:
σ = φobs −2RS

There is a particular interesting conﬁguration, the one with σ = 0. In this case, S, M
and O are completely aligned, and Eq.(10.31) reduces to an algebraic equation for
φobs. We get two solutions, φobs = ±φE, where the angular Einstein radius is deﬁned
as follows:

These solutions are shown in Figure 10.4a: the same source is seen at two different
symmetric positions in the sky, at an angle +φE and −φE from the lens [see Figure
10.4a]. Given the axial symmetry of the problem, we can rotate the plane of Figure
10.4a around the S-M-O polar axis by an angle α, repeating in the new plane exactly
the same considerations: the same source is seen again at two different symmetric

position in the sky, an angle α away from the previous ones. It is easy to convince
ourselves that a continuous rotation around the polar angle implies that the apparent
positions of the same source move along a circle, forming the so-called Einstein
Ring [see Figure 10.4b]. The occurrence of such a ring requires form one hand a
very good alignment of S, M and O, and, on the other hand, a speciﬁc arrangement
in their relative distances (DSM, DS and DM) as shown in Eq.10.30. Discovered for
the ﬁrst time in 1988 [44], many other Einstein rings have been discovered since
then. Figure 10.5 shows the lensed image of the SDP81 galaxy, at redshift z = 3.042,
obtained with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array-ALMA [6].
Let’s conclude this section by stressing two characteristics of the gravitational
lensing phenomenon. First, the deﬂection angle derived in Eq.(10.28) doesn’t know
anything about the frequency of the light that has been deﬂected. It follows that the
gravitational lensing is frequency independent, i.e. it is achromatic. Secondly, as it
is apparent from Figure 10.4b, the angular size of the lensed image is larger than
that of the source itself. This affects the luminosity of the lensed image. In fact, the
energy ﬂux received from a source of uniform brightness1 is given by Fν = IνΩS,
where ΩS is the solid angle subtended by the source. If the background source is
lensed, the energy ﬂux will be given by F(L)
ν
= IνΩ(L)
S , where Ω(L)
S
is the angular size
of the lensed image. If Ω(L)
S
= µΩS, the energy ﬂux received from the lensed image
will be greater than that received by the source itself: F(L)
ν
= µFν. The prefactor µ
is the so-called magniﬁcation factor. All this line of reasoning is based on the fact
that the brightness of the background source and that of the lensed image are the
same. This is indeed the case if photons are able to free-stream from the source up to

angle, and unit frequency: Iν = dE/(dAdtdΩdν).

Relative position of Earth and Mercury in an almost superior conjunction with
the Sun. Radio pulses move back and forth from Earth to Mercury, experiencing the curvature
of the space-time induced by the Sun. As a result, the radio pulses’ travel time will be longer
than the one we would have observed in a ﬂat, Minkowski space-time, see text.
Thus, the coordinate speed of light depends on the curvature of the space-time. Let’s
stress that Eq.(10.45) provides the speed of light as measured by an observer at in-
ﬁnity that uses his/her proper (Minkowskian) intervals of space and time.2 All this to
say that the light travel time in a (curved) Schwarzschild space-time is expected to be
different w.r.t. the case of a (ﬂat) Minkowski space-time. It would then be interesting
to evaluate the magnitude of the effect and to provide an experimental evidence for
it. This effect was discussed for the ﬁrst time by Shapiro in 1964 in a paper entitled
The fourth test of General Relativity [85].
The idea is the following. Imagine to send radio-pulses to Mercury and to measure
the time interval necessary to receive their echos—that is, their reﬂected signals. We
can then compare this measured time interval with the ratio between the distance
traveled by the signal and the velocity of light.
For sake of clarity, let’s refer to Figure 10.6. The radio pulses take 22′ to go back
and forth from Earth and Mercury. Since this time is much less than their orbital
periods, we can safely assume that both the Earth and Mercury are at rest during
the radio pulses travel. Given the distances involved, we can again consider that
the deﬂection occurs instantaneously at the time of maximum approach to the lens,
that is, at the point B of Figure 10.6. Because of the light rays’ deﬂection, a radio
pulses from Earth to Mercury cover a distance dE + dM. However, xE = dE cosδ ≃
dE(1−δ 2/2), where δ ≃2m@/b is the deﬂection angle and b the impact parameter.
So, to ﬁrst order, dE ≃xE and dM ≃xM. Thus, to ﬁrst order—let’s stress it again—
we can approximate the actual light path with the straight, dashed line parallel to the
x-axis connecting the Earth with Mercury [see Figure 10.6].
2 Note that the observer at inﬁnity can evaluate the speed of light only by collecting data from locally
inertial observers. For these observers, the speed of light is by construction always equal to c.

M +b2 are the Earth and Mercury radial distances
from the Sun, at the origin of our coordinate system. Eq.(10.48) tells us that in ﬂat
space-time (e.g. m = 0), the time elapsed for the radio pulse to go back and forth is
given by the distance the radio pulses travel (twice the distance of Mercury from the
Earth) divided by the velocity of light. In the presence of the central body, the Sun
in our case, the situation changes. In fact, the second term on the rhs of Eq.(10.48)
describes the delay expected in the presence of a non-vanishing curvature of space-
time. To maximize this delay, let’s minimize the difference ρE −|xE|. This can be
done when Mercury is almost in superior conjunction with the Sun and the radio
pulse approache the Sun photosphere (see Figure 10.6). To zeroth order ρE ≃|xE| and
ρM ≃|xM|. However, to properly evaluate the difference ρE −|xE|, we have to go to

last century. Time-delay measurements of radio pulses traveling between Earth and
Mercury or Venus were made when either planet was on the other side of the Sun
from the Earth, in the so-called superior-conjunction alignment. We show in Figure
10.7 the data reported by Shapiro and coworkers [86]. The agreement with the Gen-
eral Relativity predictions was reported to be of the order of ±20%. The Shapiro
time-delay effect was later measured exploiting the passage of the Cassini probe
close to the Sun. This measurement conﬁrms the predictions of General Relativity
with a precision of few part in 105 [11]. So, in conclusion, we can truly count the
Shapiro time delay as the fourth classic test of General Relativity.4

4 The other three classical tests are the gravitational redshift, the precession of the perihelion and the
bending of the light. In this book, however, we prefer to present and discuss the gravitational redshift as
a test of the Equivalence Principle, rather than of the ﬁeld equations of General Relativity.


11 Gravitational Waves in the
“Vacuum”
11.1
INTRODUCTION
General Relativity describes gravitational phenomena in geometrical terms, using
curved, pseudo-Riemannian space-times. Still, consistently with Special Relativity,
gravitational interactions must propagate no faster than the speed of light. This leads
to consider the idea of gravitational waves, ﬁrst predicted and discussed by Einstein
in 1916 and 1918 [24,25], and then detected, indirectly by Hulse and Taylor in 1975
[46] and directly by the LIGO and Virgo collaborations in 2015 [3]. The goal of this
chapter is to show that the linearized ﬁeld equations of General Relativity indeed
admit wave solutions and to discuss their main properties in the vacuum.
11.2
LINEARIZED GRAVITY
In Section 6.4, we used the Equivalence Principle to justify the use of the formalism
developed in Chapter 3 in the wider context of gravitational phenomena. We argued
that quite far away from a given mass distribution, the geometry of space-time should
be described by a perturbed Minkowski metric tensor:
gµν(xτ) = ηµν +hµν(xτ)
(11.1)
where |hµν| ≪|ηµν|. We then heuristically derive the metric form at large distances
from a point mass [c.f. Eq.(6.20)]. Here, we want to reverse the argument, and to
use the ﬁeld equations in the “vacuum” [c.f. Eq.(8.13) or Eq.(8.35)] to ﬁnd exact
solutions for the components of the perturbed metric tensor, hµν.
It is worth noting again that the Einstein ﬁeld, equations are differential equa-
tions, linear in the second derivative of the metric tensor, but non-linear in its ﬁrst
derivatives. This renders the solution of the ﬁeld equations extremely challenging.
However, in the linearized gravity regime described by Eq.(11.1), we can make a
number of simpliﬁcations quite helpful in making the ﬁeld equations more manage-
able. For example, we can write the Christoffel symbols [c.f. Eq.(3.24)] to ﬁrst order
in the metric perturbation tensor.

It follows that—again, to ﬁrst order in the metric perturbation tensor—we can write
the Riemann tensor neglecting the second determinant in Eq.(5.39): the products of
the Christoffel symbols are clearly of second order in hµν. In this approximation, the

GAUGE TRANSFORMATIONS
Eq.(11.7) can be further simpliﬁed by choosing a proper gauge. Let’s consider the
following coordinate transformations
x′µ = xµ +dµ(xτ);
xµ = x′µ −dµ(x′τ)
(11.8)
where dµ is an inﬁnitesimal displacement four-vector. According to Eq.(4.15), we
have
g′
µν(x′τ) ≡gµν(xτ +dτ) = gαβ(xτ) ∂xα
∂x′µ
∂xβ
∂x′ν
(11.9)
Now, let’s translate the coordinate system, xτ →xτ −dτ, so that Eq.(11.9) becomes
g′
µν(xτ) = gαβ(xτ −dτ) ∂xα
∂x′µ
∂xβ
∂x′ν
(11.10)
Note that gαβ(xτ −dτ) ≃gαβ(xτ), as the next term in the Taylor expansion,
gαβ,σ(xτ)dσ, is a second order quantity. Moreover, ∂xα/∂x′µ = δ α
µ −dα ,µ [c.f.
Eq.(11.8)]. Thus, we get
g′
µν(xρ) = gµν(xτ)−dν,µ −dµ,ν
(11.11)

Gravitational Waves in the “Vacuum”

This expression, of ﬁrst order in the displacement four-vector, allows us to com-
pare the metric tensor in the same physical point of the space-time. The analogous
transformation for the metric perturbation tensor is obtained by using Eq.(11.1) in
Eq.(11.11). To ﬁrst order in dµ, we get
h′
µν ≃hµν −dµ,ν −dν,µ
(11.12)
or, in mixed form,
h′µ ν ≃hµ ν −dµ ,ν −dν ,µ
(11.13)
The contraction of the indexes in Eq.(11.13) provides the relation between the traces
of the metric perturbation tensors in the primed and unprimed coordinate systems
h′ ≃h−2dσ ,σ
(11.14)
Then, the transformation of the trace-reversed perturbation tensor becomes [see Ex-
ercise A.35],

We can now use Eq.(11.15) in Eq.(11.7) to write the Einstein tensor in terms of the
trace-reversed perturbation tensor in the primed reference frame. After some straight-
forward calculations [see Exercise A.36], we get

THE LORENTZ GAUGE
Until now, we have not speciﬁed in any way the choice of the gauge. There is indeed
a class of coordinate systems that are of particular interest for the problem under
study. They obey to the Lorentz gauge condition
h
′µ
ν,µ = 0
(11.18)
So, the question to be asked is the following: given a generic reference frame where
h
µ
ν,µ ̸= 0, how can we constrain the transformation of Eq.(11.8) to ﬁnd a frame
where Eq.(11.18) is satisﬁed? To answer to this question, let’s ﬁrst write the transfor-
mation law for the four divergence of the metric perturbation tensor. From Eq.(11.16)
we have
h
′µ
ν,µ = h

ν,µ −□dν
(11.19)

142
An Overview of General Relativity and Space-Time
where we have used the identity dν ,µ
µ = ηµσdν,σµ = □dν. So, we can always satisfy
the Lorentz gauge condition in the primed reference frame, provided that the chosen
coordinate transformation satisﬁes the following constraint
□dν = h
µ
ν,µ
(11.20)
The advantage of using the Lorentz gauge stands on the fact that all the last three
terms in Eq.(11.17) vanishes, as it is immediate to verify. Thus, in the Lorentz gauge,
the Einstein tensor reduces to Gµν = −□h
′
µν/2, and the ﬁeld equations in the “vac-
uum” can be conveniently be written in the form of a wave equation
□h
′
µν = 0
(11.21)
11.5
GRAVITATIONAL WAVES
On the basis of Eq.(11.21), we do expect “ripples” in the otherwise ﬂat geometry of
the space-time. This “ripples”, described by the metric perturbation tensor, can be
seen as the superposition of plane waves traveling at the speed of light. These are
indeed gravitational waves, ﬁrst discussed by Einstein in 1916 [24]. Let’s consider,
for sake of simplicity, a monochromatic case
h
′
µν = Aµνeikµxµ
(11.22)
where kµ is the wavenumber four-vector, Aµν is the (constant) wave amplitude,
whereas the wavefront is identiﬁed by the hyper-surface kµxµ = const. By deﬁni-
tion, □h
′
µν = ηαβh
′
µν,αβ. It follows that Eq.(11.22) in Eq.(11.21) provides
ηαβkαkβh
′
µν = 0
(11.23)
that is,
kαkα = 0
(11.24)
consistently with the fact that kµ is a light-like vector. Moreover, the Lorentz gauge
condition given in Eq.(11.18) provides
ηµα ∂h
′
αν
∂xµ = ηµαAανikµeikσ xσ = 0
(11.25)
that is,
Aανkα = 0
(11.26)
So, the metric perturbation tensor is a double-transverse tensor, as the amplitude of
the wave is orthogonal to the wavenumber four-vector [see Box 11.1].

BOX 11.1
THE HELMHOLTZ’S THEOREM
Any continuous vector ﬁeld, with continuous ﬁrst partial derivatives, can be de-
composed in two components: the longitudinal/irrotational component, given
by the gradient of a scalar quantity; the transverse and divergence-less compo-
nent, that cannot be obtained from a scalar.
A demonstration of this theorem can be found in many textbooks (see e.g. [7]). Here
we want just to clarify the meaning of the terms longitudinal and transverse. Let’s
exploit the case of a monochromatic plane wave of unitary amplitude, described by
the scalar quantity Q(xτ) = exp(ikµxµ). By taking the gradient of this function, we
can form a longitudinal vector, by definition parallel to the wavenumber four-vector:
V (ℓ)
α
≡(∂Q(xτ)/∂xα) = ikαQ. Such a vector is by construction irrotational, as it is
easy to verify. A transverse vector can be written by imposing its orthogonality to
kα: V(t)α ≡nαQ, with the constraint nαkα = 0. Then, by construction, such a vector
is divergenceless. Similar considerations apply to tensors. We can form a doubly
longitudinal (ℓℓ) tensor by taking the gradient of a longitudinal vector: T (ℓℓ)αβ =
(∂V (ℓ)β /∂xα) = kαkβ Q. We can also form a singly-longitudinal (ℓt) tensor by taking
the gradient of a transverse vector S(ℓt)β α = (∂V β
(t)/∂xα) ≡kαnβ Q. Finally, we can
form a doubly-transverse tensor, F(tt)α β = f α β Q, with the constraint f α β kα = 0.
For a monochromatic plane wave propagating along the z-axis, Eq.(11.21) can be
written as follows:

where Cν (ν = 0,3) are four integration constants. Note that if we are interested only
to the time behavior of the components of the metric perturbation tensor—that is,
at a ﬁxed spatial position z⋆—these constants can be set equal to zero, as the time
average of both h0
ν and h3
ν at z⋆vanishes. On the other hand, if we are interested

only to the spatial behavior of the components of the metric perturbation tensor—
that is, at a given time t⋆—then these constants can equally well be set equal to zero:
if at a given time and at a given position⃗x the metric perturbation tensor is different
from zero, then lim|⃗y−⃗x|→∞h

µν(⃗y,t) = 0, because the space-time is asymptotically

We can further simplify the situation by changing again reference frame, with a new
inﬁnitesimal transformation: x′′τ = x′τ +d′τ, where d′τ are the contravariant compo-
nents of a new (inﬁnitesimal) displacement vector. Since in the “primed” reference
frame we already enforced the Lorentz gauge condition, the analogous of Eq.(11.19)
reads now h
′′µ
ν,µ = −□d′
ν. So, the Lorentz gauge condition holds also in the “double
primed” reference frame, provided that □d′τ = 0. Thus, from one hand, we still have

time-space components
h

1 = h

(11.33)
and for the combination

The gauge that satisﬁes all these conditions is the so-called Transverse-Traceless
or, simply, TT-gauge: it is transverse because the only non-vanishing components of
the metric perturbation tensor are in the plane orthogonal to the direction of propaga-
tion of the wave; it is traceless because of the chosen gauge. Under these conditions,
the perturbed metric tensor is equal to the trace-reversed metric perturbation tensor,
and we can forget about the overline. Also, if we agree to work in a TT-gauge, we
can also forget about the “double prime” superscript and explicitly quote the gauge
we are working with: h(TT)µν. Note that the Lorentz gauge condition now provides
h(TT)i j,i = 0, showing that the spatial metric perturbation tensor is double- transverse.

GAUGE INVARIANT APPROACH
Before discussing the observational implications of Eq.(11.35), let’s clarify few is-
sues that can arise from the previous discussion. First, it could seem that the metric
perturbation tensor deﬁned in Eq.(11.1) always obeys to a wave equation. We know
that this is not the case: in fact, the same perturbative approach of Eq.(6.10) led us
to write the Schwarzschild metric in a linearized regime [c.f. Eq.(6.20)]. Secondly,
it could seem that the writing given in Eq.(11.35) depends on a very speciﬁc choice
of the TT-gauge, and this would contradict the Principle of General Covariance of
General Relativity.
To clarify all these issues, it is convenient to attack the problem in a gauge-
independent way. To do so, let’s ﬁrst SVT decompose the metric perturbation tensor,
hµν, to separate the contributions coming from scalars (S), vectors (V), and tensors
(T). Since ds2 = (ηµν + hµν)dxµdxν, it is clear that h00 has to be a scalar, h0i a
vector, and hi j a tensor. This is the only way for having ds2 invariant. Then,
h00 = 2ϕ

Note that the combination (C(t) j,i +C(t)i, j)/2 is a necessary one to render hij sym-
metric. The previous relations clearly show that scalars, vectors, and tensors con-
tribute differently to the ten independent degrees of freedom-dof’s of hµν.
•
The scalar h00 contributes with one scalar dof, ϕ;
•
The vector h0i has been decomposed according to the Helmholtz’ the-
orem [see Box 11.1]: it contributes with one scalar dof, A, and with
two vector dof’s, provided by the transverse and divergenceless vector
V (t)

;
•
The tensor hi j contributes with: two scalar dof’s, H and B; two vector
dof’s, provided by the transverse and divergenceless vector C(t)

tensor dof’s, provided by the doubly-transverse, divergenceless, and
traceless tensor h(TT)

An Overview of General Relativity and Space-Time
The components of the metric perturbation tensor change under a generic coordinate
transformation according to Eq.(11.12)
ˆh00 = h00 −2d0,0
(11.37a)
ˆh0i = h0i −d0,i −di,0
(11.37b)
ˆhij = hij −di, j −dj,i
(11.37c)
Let’s apply again the Helmholtz’s theorem to express the spatial, covariant compo-
nents of the displacement four-vector in terms of a transverse vector, ε(t)
k , and of the
gradient of a scalar, ξ,
dk = ε(t)
k −ξ,k
(11.38)
Then, after substituting Eq.(11.36a) and Eq.(11.36b) in Eq.(11.37a) and Eq.(11.37b),
we get

The last result is very important, as it shows that the doubly transverse, traceless
tensor h(TT)
i j
is indeed gauge-invariant. Eq.(11.42a) clearly shows that there is another
gauge-invariant quantity, given by the combination of two scalars
Ψ = H −∇2B
(11.44)
We can now use Eq.(11.40b) and Eq.(11.42b) to eliminate ξ and to express d0 di-
rectly in terms of A and B,0

Let’s conclude this section by writing also the vector dof’s in a gauge-invariant
form. After using Eq.(11.40a) and Eq.(11.42c) to eliminate ε(t)
j,0, we can rewrite

So, at the end, we are left with four gauge-invariant physical quantities (Φ, Ψ, Θi,

associated with the choice of the displacement vector: two scalar dof’s, d0 and ξ,
and two vector dof’s, provided by the divergenceless vector ε(t)
i .
11.8
FIELD EQUATIONS
The advantage of the SVT decomposition is that scalar, vector, and tensor dof’s obey
to independent, uncoupled ﬁeld equations. Then, it makes sense to discuss them sep-
arately.

148
An Overview of General Relativity and Space-Time
• Scalar dof’s
If we restrict to scalar dof’s , we have to deal with four scalar quantities: φ, A,
H, and B. Let’s chose the longitudinal gauge, with A = B = 0. In this case both
H = Ψ and φ = Φ are gauge invariant quantities [c.f. Eq.(11.44) and Eq.(11.47)].
The components of the metric perturbation tensor can then be written as follows
h00 = 2Φ;
hij = 1
3Ψδij
(11.50)
If we neglect the contribution of the Cosmological Constant, the ﬁeld equations
in the vacuum are given by Gα β = 0 [c.f. Eq.(8.18)]. It can be shown [see Exer-
cise A.37] that
G00 = ∇2Ψ = 0
(11.51)
For i ̸= j, it can also be shown that
Gi j =
∂2
∂xi∂x j

Φ−1
6Ψ

= 0
(11.52)
consistent with having Φ = Ψ/6. Then, because of Eq.(11.51)
∇2Φ = 0
(11.53)
In addition, we get
G0i =
∂2
∂xi∂x0 Ψ = 0
(11.54)
and
Tr[Gi j] = −∂2
∂x02 Ψ+2∇2Φ−1
3∇2Ψ = 0
(11.55)
This indicates, together with Eq.(11.51) and Eq.(11.53), that the gauge-invariant
quantity Ψ is time independent.
• Vector dof’s
In this case, we have to deal with two transverse vectors, V (t)
i
and C(t)
i . The
components of the metric perturbation tensor are given by [c.f. Eq.(11.36)]
h0i = V (t)

The only non-vanishing Einstein tensor components are found to be

i = ∇2Θi = 0
(11.57)

Gravitational Waves in the “Vacuum”
149
• Tensor dof’s
Let’s now consider only the tensor dof’s. These are given by the components of
the double transverse, traceless tensor h(TT)
ij
. If we keep the same notation of
Eq.(11.35), the resulting components of the ﬁeld equations are found to be
G1
1 = G2
2 = −□h+ = 0 ;
G1
2 = G2
1 = −□h× = 0
(11.58)
From the above discussion, we can conclude that only the doubly transverse tensor,
h(TT)
i j
, describes gravitational waves, as only tensor dofs obey to a wave equation. It
must also be stressed that the results given here generalize those given in Section
11.6. In fact, the transverse and traceless tensor of Eq.(11.35), initially derived in the
TT- gauge, it is indeed a gauge-invariant quantity, as shown in Eq.(11.43).
Note that only gauge-invariant quantities related to scalar and vector dofs obey
to Laplace-like equations. Thus, Eq.(11.53) reduces, in the weak ﬁeld limit, to the
classical Laplace equation in the “vacuum”: ∇2U = 0 [c.f. Eq.(6.20)]. It follows that
only scalar dofs contribute to the overall curvature of the space-time which has been
tested observationally in Chapter 10.
11.9
EFFECTS OF A GRAVITATIONAL WAVE
To study the effects of gravitational waves, let’s rewrite the metric of the space-time
under the assumption that only tensor dofs are present [c.f. Eq.(11.1) and Eq.(11.35)]
ds2 = c2dt2 −

δij −h(TT)
ij

(11.59)
Consider now a test particle, A say, at rest w.r.t. the chosen reference frame. The
geodesic equations [c.f. Eq.(5.26)] provide in this case
d2xα
dt2 = 0
(11.60)
as Γα
00 = 0 [c.f. Eq.(11.35) and Eq.(11.59)]. This result is perfectly understandable if
h(TT)
i j
= 0. However, Eq.(11.60) is deﬁnitely valid before, during and after the transit
of a gravitational wave. So, we might wrongly conclude that a test particle is unaf-
fected by the wave. This is not the case. In fact, the writing of Eq.(11.59) implicitly
implies using a synchronous gauge and comoving coordinates [see Box 11.2]. In
this gauge, the test particle keeps its Lagrangian, comoving label even if h(TT)
ij
̸= 0.
In other words, the test-particle is simply “free-falling” into the gravitational ﬁeld
produced by the gravitational wave.

150
An Overview of General Relativity and Space-Time
BOX 11.2
THE SYNCHRONOUS GAUGE
In the synchronous gauge, fundamental observers share the same (universal) time
marker. This can happen if two conditions are fulfilled: g00 = 1 (proper time flows
at the same rate for all the observers)[c.f. Eq.(2.20)]; g0k = 0 (clocks can be fully
synchronized even along closed paths)[c.f. Eq.(3.43)]. It follows that at a given time,
the spatial positions of fundamental observers define a space-like hypersurface. In a
sense, we are “slicing" the abstract space-time in spatial hypersurfaces of constant
time, recovering the intuitive point of view that events occur somewhere in space
at a given time.
In this gauge, spatial coordinates are comoving (Lagrangian) coordinates: funda-
mental observers are at rest, with four velocities uµ ≡{1,0,0,0}. Note that this
statement in strictly related to the g00 = 1 and g0k = 0 requirements. In fact, the
geodesic equation reduces to duµ/ds = 0 [c.f. Eq.(11.60)], as in this gauge Γµ
00 = 0.
The situation clearly changes if we consider another particle, B say, at a comoving
distance Dα from A. Both particles move in space-time along their geodesics. How-
ever, in the presence of a gravitational wave, we don’t expect these geodesics to be
parallel. So, it make sense to evaluate their geodesic deviation as we did in Section
6.9. Let’s ﬁrst rewrite Eq.(6.30)
D2Dα
Ds2
= Rα
µνλuµuνDλ
(11.61)
There are several simpliﬁcations that we can do here. First, in the synchronous gauge
uµ = {1,0,0,0}. Secondly, the coordinate distance Dλ between the A and B particles
can be written in a perturbative way
Dα = Lα +∆Lα
(11.62)
where the zeroth order term, Lα, represents the (constant) comoving coordinate dis-
tance of B from A in the absence of the gravitational wave. Also, the second absolute
derivative can be reduced in this context to an ordinary second derivative. In fact,

INTERFEROMETERS
We can apply Eq.(11.65) to the case of interferometric detectors of gravitational
waves. Such detectors consist of two orthogonal arms with mirrors at their ends. A
laser (almost monochromatic) signal is sent toward a beam splitter and from it to
the two mirrors. The reﬂected signals are then recombined at the beam splitter and
received by a photodetector at the readout point [see Figure 11.1]. The interference
pattern is used to measure the relative phase of one beam w.r.t. the other.
For the sake of simplicity, let’s choose a coordinate system with the x- and y-axis
aligned with the arms’ directions. So, for a gravitational wave propagating along the
z-axis, we can still consider valid Eq.(11.35). Consider a particle A at the origin of
the reference frame, where the beam splitter is located, and a particle B (C) at the
position of Mirror 1 (2) [see Figure 11.1]. Eq.(11.65) shows that a gravitational wave
affects the optical path lengths of the arms. So, the interference pattern at the readout
point should change when a gravitational wave is passing through the detector. With
this conﬁguration, Eq.(11.35) yields2

Test particles are initially disposed around a (dashed) circle. Because of the
transit of a “+” polarized GW, particles move parallel to the coordinate axis. The continuous

T being the period of the wave.

Let’s assume that the gravitational wave has only a “+” polarization status. On the
interferometer plane, we can write h+ = A+ cos(ωt +π/2), implying that the transit
of the wave starts at t = 0. Then, the fractional change in the comoving distance
between the A and B particles is given by

(11.69)
To show the overall effect of a “+” polarized gravitational wave, let’s imagine to
have a number of test particles at the same distance from the origin, disposed along
a circumference. Then, by using Eq.(11.67), we can see what happens at different
times. As shown in Figure 12.2, the effect of a “+” polarized gravitational wave is
to force each of the particle to move parallel to the coordinate axes. Thus, the effect
of a h+ polarized wave is to modulate the lengths of the interferometer arms around
their zeroth order value, L. Note that an elongation along the x-axis corresponds to a
contraction along the y-axis, and vice versa. These fractional changes in the length
of the interferometer arms induce a variation in the interferometric pattern at the
readout point. This in turn allows to accurately measure ∆L/L and, then, h(TT)
ij
.
If the wave is “cross” polarized, then h× = A× cos(ωt + π/2). In this case,
Eq.(11.67) provides

As shown in Figure 11.3, the effect of the “×” polarized gravitational wave forces
the points on the circumference to move not parallel to the coordinate axes, but rather
orthogonally to them. So, the evolution of the polarization pattern is the same as for
the + polarized wave, but rotated by 45◦. In real life, the interferometers are sensitive
to a weighted combination of both the “+” and “×” polarization, the weights being
deﬁned by the direction of the wave w.r.t. the interferometer plane and orientation.
11.11
THE DIRECT DETECTION OF GRAVITATIONAL WAVES
The direct detection of gravitational waves requires to build ground-based facilities
able to exploit what was discussed in the previous Section. The suggestion of us-
ing interferometers to detect gravitational waves dates back to the 60s of the last
century [37, 40], but it is only in the ﬁrst decade of this century that a number of
interferometers became operational. The effort to push, year after year, the cur-
rent technologies to their limits led in 2015 to the Advanced Laser Interferometer
Gravitational-Wave Observatory-LIGO [2]. Advanced-LIGO is a very sophisticated,
high sensitivity experiment. It is composed by two identical laser interferometers
with 4km long arms. They are both US based, one in Hanford (Washington) and the
other in Livingston (Lousiana). They are 3000km away to be sure that the detected
signals are not of local origin, and to identify only those signal that are identical
in the two interferometers. Working with two interferometers is essential to conﬁrm
each other’s detections of non-local signals—that is, of gravitational waves. There is
another plus in using two or even more interferometers. The study of the difference
in the signal arrival time at each detector allows (and will allow) to (better) identify
the direction on the sky from which a gravitational wave arrives.
In 2015, immediately after they were turned on, the two detectors of Advanced-
LIGO observed a transient gravitational-wave signal. The strength of a gravitational

wave is quantiﬁed by a dimensionless number, h = ∆Lx/LX −∆Ly/Ly, the so-called
gravitational-wave strain. The peak of the gravitational-wave strain observed by
Advance-LIGO was h ≃10−21. It is worth noting that such a strain corresponds
to ∆L ≃10−16cm, almost three orders of magnitude smaller that the diameter of the
proton. The form of the detected signal matches the waveform predicted by General
Relativity for the inspiral and merger of a pair of black holes. The analysis of the
Advanced-LIGO data provided the masses of the two black-holes, M1 = (36±5)M@
and M2 = (29±4)M@, their distance, (410±180 Mpc, and the energy radiated in the
form of gravitational wave, (3±0.5)M@c2 [3]. This has been the ﬁrst direct detection
of gravitational waves and the ﬁrst evidence of binary black-hole merger.
Direct observation of gravitational waves has open a new ﬁled, the gravitational
wave astronomy. Now the network of interferometers comprises also the Advanced-
Virgo interferometer. This is based in Italy and has two perpendicular, 3km long
arms. LIGO and Virgo detected 35 new events in their latest observation run, bring
to 90 the gravitational waves detected by the global three-interferometer network. In
addition to LIGO and Virgo, there will also be the Japanese KAGRA detector. The
LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA scientiﬁc collaborations are closely coordinating in order
to start their common run of observations in mid-December, 2022.
11.12
THE INDIRECT EVIDENCE FOR GRAVITATIONAL WAVES
Let’s conclude this chapter by discussing the indirect evidence for the existence of
gravitational obtained through astronomical observations. This starts in 1975 with
the discovery by Hulse and Taylor of the binary pulsar PSR B1913+16 [46]. The

This is Figure 3 of the paper by J. M. Weisberg and Y. Huang [98], showing
the rate of period decrease of PSR B1913+16 in 30 years of observations. The observational
data points indicate the observed period change at periastron. The parabola shows the GR
predictions for the rate of period decrease of a binary system emitting gravitational radiation.
pulsation period of this source, ≃59 ms, was observed to vary systematically by
39µs over a cycle of roughly 8 hours. This periodic variation is consistent with
having PSR B1913+16 in a binary orbit around a compact object of similar size. In
the abstract of their paper, Hulse and Taylor state that their discovery “makes feasible
a number of studies involving the physics of compact objects, the astrophysics of
close binary systems, and special- and general-relativistic effects”. In 1993, Hulse
and Taylor were awarded by Nobel Prize in Physics “for the discovery of a new
type of pulsar, a discovery that has opened up new possibilities for the study of
gravitation”. In fact, according to General Relativity, we do expect that a binary
system emits energy in the form of gravitational waves. As a result, the orbit shrink
and the period decreases. Such an evidence was indeed supported by the observations
[89], and further conﬁrmed on the basis of more data. In particular, the excellent
agreement between the theoretical predictions for the rate of period decreases [ ˙TGR =
(−2.403±0.005)10−12] and the observations [ ˙TGR = (−2.30±0.22)10−12] provides
compelling evidence for the existence of gravitational radiation [89,90]. Thirty years
of observations and analysis of the relativistic binary pulsar B1913+16 provide the
plot shown in Figure 11.5 [98].

INTRODUCTION
The Schwarzschild solution proved to be extremely effective in providing observa-
tional tests that conﬁrmed the validity of the ﬁeld equations of General Relativity.
These classical tests were done on planetary scales—that is, on scales much larger
than the Schwarzschild radius of the Sun. A complete new phenomenology arises
if we explore, still in the “vacuum”, scales comparable or even smaller than the
Schwarzschild radius of the considered structure [30,53]. The goal of this chapter is
to develop the tools needed for discussing speciﬁc predictions of General Relativity
in this regime.

describes the geometry of the space-time in the presence of a point-mass at the ori-
gin of the chosen coordinate system. The curvature of the Schwarzschild space-
time cannot be described in terms of the Ricci scalar [c.f. Eq.(8.16)]. In fact,
the Schwarzschild solution has been derived in the “vacuum”, using ﬁeld equa-
tions that require the Ricci tensor (and then its trace) to be identically equal to
zero [c.f. Eq.(8.13]. For this reason, we have to describe the curvature of the
Schwarzschild space-time by considering the scale-invariant, Kretschmann scalar
K ≡RαβµνRαβµν. In the Schwarzschild case, we have
K = 12R2
S
r6
(12.2)
The Schwarzschild metric clearly shows two pathological points, at r = 0 and r = RS.
In these points, the relation between proper and coordinate time is lost [c.f. Eq.(7.1)],
as well as the relation between proper and coordinate radial lengths [c.f. Eq.(3.48)].
However, the Kretschmann scalar conﬁrms the pathological behavior at r = 0, but
not at r = RS. This is an important point. In fact, being a tensor with rank 0, K has
values that, point by point, are independent on the choice of the coordinate system.
All this opens up the discussion on whether r = RS is a physical singularity, or
rather an artifact of the chosen coordinate system, a so-called coordinate singularity.
On very general grounds, the latter highlights the fact that a given coordinate system
is unable to properly describe the geometry of a space or space-time in some speciﬁc
regions. For example, the geometry of a 2D sphere is usually described in terms of

polar coordinates. In this representation, the North and South poles are clear coor-
dinate singularities. In fact, each of the two poles is identiﬁed by a single value of
the latitude (θ = 0 or θ = π), but by any arbitrary value of the longitudinal angle:
0 ≤φ ≤2π. Just to give another example, the metric given in Eq.(3.37) shows a sin-
gularity at r = c/ω. In Section 3.6, we concluded that this singularity reﬂected the
impossibility of building a physical reference frame, with rods and clocks, when ro-
tation velocities become larger than c. In other words, the chosen coordinate system
can’t be used to cover the entire space-time.
It is worth remembering that the Schwarzschild geometry was derived with very
speciﬁc assumptions about the time and radial coordinates: the coordinate time is
the proper time of an observer at inﬁnity, whereas the radial coordinate is chosen
to render the angular part of the metric equal (apart from the minus sign) to the
Euclidean one. Since t and r are just space-time coordinates, the interpretation of
their physical role always requires great attention.
Note that forcing r < RS in the Schwarzschild solution results in a change of sign
in both g00 and g11 [c.f. Eq.(12.1)]. This is an interesting clue. Consider, for example,
a free-falling test-particle that in a given dt changes its position by dr:
ds2 = (1−RS/r)dx02 −(1−RS/r)−1dr2
(12.3)
If r > RS, ds2 > 0: as expected, the considered interval is time-like. However, if r <
RS, for the same dt and dr, ds2 < 0: the interval becomes now space-like. This has
an interesting consequence on the orientation of the light-cones in a Schwarzschild
space-time. The condition ds = 0 provides [c.f. Eq.(12.1)]

where τ = ct/(2RS), ρ = r/RS, and τ = 0 for ρ = ρ0.
Null geodesics are shown in Figure 12.1. For ρ >> 1, the light-cones have an
opening angle of ≃90◦, as expected in an almost Minkowski space-time. However,
when ρ tends to 1 from the right, the opening angle decreases, keeping the light-cone
axes still parallel to the τ-axis. Consider a source of pulsed light in free-fall toward
the central mass. The narrowing of the light cones implies that an observer at inﬁnity
receives these pulses at a decreasing rate. This is consistent with the discussion done
in Section 9.7: for an observer at inﬁnity, the time required for a test particle to reach
the Schwarzschild radius is inﬁnite. On the other hand, as discussed above, when
ρ < 1 time-like intervals become space-like. This forces the light-cones to rotate by

ρ < 1 (the light-gray area on the left of the Figure).
90◦: now the axes of the light-cones are parallel to the ρ-axis [see Figure 12.1]. This
has two important consequences: i) there is no way to communicate with an observer
at inﬁnity and ii) there is no way of avoiding the singularity at r = 0.
Let’s refer to the Schwarzschild sphere as to the sphere of radius RS. Figure 12.1
shows that the Schwarzschild sphere acts as a “boundary” between the outer and
the inner worlds: once one passed it, there is no way to communicate with the outer
world, nor to be back to it. The Schwarzschild sphere is then called the event horizon:
it separates events that can be seen by an observer at inﬁnity, from those that cannot
be seen. The region inside the Schwarzschild sphere is called black hole: it is a hole
because matter is falling into it; it is black because even light is unable to escape
from it. Whatever is in the inner world, it accretes mass without emitting any signal
to the outer world. It is worth remembering that the Schwarzschild solution describes
the geometry of the space-time produced by a point mass—that is, in the “vacuum”.
In reality, a black hole can exist only if the mass responsible for the curvature of
the space-time is entirely contained inside the Schwarzschild sphere. This can occur
only for very massive, but extremely compact astrophysical objects.

CONFORMALLY-FLAT COORDINATES
As discussed in the previous Section, intervals that are time-like (when ρ >
1) become space-like when ρ turns to be smaller than unity. Thus, inside the
Schwarzschild sphere the “radial” and “time” coordinates must be reinterpreted as

CONFORMALLY FLAT SPACE-TIME
A pseudo-Riemannian space-time is said to be conformally flat if its metric can be
written in the following way
gµν(xτ) = H2(xτ)ηµν
(B12.1.a)
where H(xτ) is the so-called conformal-factor and ηµν is the Minkowski metric.
Note that a conformallly-flat space-time has indeed a non-vanishing curvature. In
fact, being a function of the coordinates, the conformal factor forces the Christoffel
symbols and the Riemann tensor to be different from zero [c.f. Eq.(5.39)]. Any
2D pseudo-Riemannian space-time is conformally flat. The terrestrial globe is an
example of a conformally flat space. In fact, it is possible to use a stereographic
projection and to map the globe in a flat x−y space. In this case, the metric can be
written as follows
dℓ2 = dθ2 +sin2 θdφ2 =
4
(1+r2)2 (dx2 +dy2)
(B12.1.b)
Here θ e φ are the colatitude and longitude angles, where r =

x2 +y2 is the
distance from the origin of the (flat) x −y coordinate system. The conformal-factor
results then to be 2/(1+r2).
“time” and “space” markers, respectively. This strongly suggests to use conformally
ﬂat coordinates, to write the Schwarzschild metric given in Eq.(12.4) in a somehow
more abstract way
ds2 = f 2(u,v)

dv2 −du2
(12.6)
Note that we can write the Schwarzschild 2D metric of Eq.(12.4) in this form because
any 2D pseudo-Riemannian space-time is conformally ﬂat [see Box 12.1].
There are two clear advantages in writing the metric in the form given in
Eq.(12.6). First, we don’t need to assign a priori neither to u nor to v the role of
“time” or “space” coordinates. So, they can play the role of a “time” or “space”
markers depending on the physical situation we want to investigate—that is, scales
larger or smaller than RS. Secondly, the conformal factor does not affect the shape
of the light cones that will be equal to those of a Minkowski space-time. As a
consequence, the coordinate speed of light is unity, as du/dv = dv/du = 1. This
is clearly not the case in the Schwarzschild metric, where the coordinate speed of
light becomes smaller and smaller when r is approaching the Schwarzschild radius:
dr/dt = c(1−RS/r) [c.f. Eq.(9.1)].
The coordinates v and u used in Eq.(12.6) are known as the Kruskal-Szekeres
coordinates [53,88]. We have now to connect them to the Schwarzschild coordinates,
t and r. To do so, let’s start from the Jacobian of the transformation

We can eliminate the still unknown function F by adding Eq.(12.11a) and
Eq.(12.11b). Then, let’s use the resulting expression two times: the ﬁrst to add and
the second to subtract twice Eq.(12.11c). We then obtain

minus sign for the lhs and rhs, respectively. This is a necessary choice if we want
the determinant of the Jacobian matrix different from zero. In fact, by adding and
subtracting Eq.(12.13a) Eq.(12.13b), we get

write two wave equations for both v and u

with solutions
v = h(ξ +x0)+g(ξ −x0);
u = h(ξ +x0)−g(ξ −x0)
(12.16)
In order to ﬁnd the unknown h and g functions, let’s substitute Eq.(12.16) back in
Eq.(12.11a). Indicating with a prime (’) a derivative w.r.t. the whole argument of the
h and g functions, we obtain

Note that we would have obtained exactly the same results if we had substituted
Eq.(12.16) in Eq.(12.11b). Note also that Eq.(12.11c) is automatically satisﬁed by
Eq.(12.16). Let’s now differentiate Eq.(12.18) w.r.t. ξ and divide by the same equa-

h′(ξ +x0) + g′′(ξ −x0)
g′(ξ −x0) = F ′(ξ)

KRUSKAL-SZEKERES VS. SCHWARZSCHILD COORDINATES
Eq.(12.18) and Eq.(12.21) allow us to ﬁnd the explicit dependence of the Kruskal-
Szekeres coordinates from the Schwarzschild ones. To do so, let’s discuss separately
what happens on scales larger and smaller than the Schwarzschild radius, RS.
• OUTSIDE THE SCHWARZSCHILD SPHERE
For r > RS, the function F is positive deﬁnite [c.f. Eq.(12.9)]. Then, because of
Eq.(12.18), h′ and g′ must have opposite sign. The ’ (prime) sign indicates a deriva-
tive w.r.t. the whole argument of the unknown functions h, g, and F. So, we can
consider ξ and ξ + x0 (or ξ −x0) as two independent variables. If this the case,

Schwarzschild Black Holes
165
Eq.(12.21) is satisﬁed if and only if the lhs and the rhs are equal to the same con-
stant, η say. Moreover, Eq.(12.21) suggests to look for exponential solutions. This is
indeed the case, as the solutions of Eq.(12.18) can be written in the following way
h(ξ +x0) = ±eη(ξ+x0)
2
;
g(ξ −x0) = ∓eη(ξ−x0)
2
;
F(ξ) = η2e2ηξ;
(12.22)
The notation of Eq.(12.22) highlights that the h and g functions have opposite
signs. It is easy to verify that Eq.(12.22) provides solutions also for Eq.(12.20) and
Eq.(12.21). For r > RS, Eq.(12.10) yields eξ = (r/RS −1)RS er. Then, by using
Eq.(12.9) and Eq.(12.16), we can now write
v = ±

u = ±

This shows that both the v and u functions must be chosen with the same sign, either
positive or negative. Also, the last of Eq.(12.22) provides
f 2(r) = RS
η2r

e−2ηr
(12.24)
The constant η is chosen to ensure the regularity of the conformal-factor f [c.f.
Eq.(12.24)] in r = RS. This clearly requires η = (2RS)−1. Given this, we can ﬁnally
write
v = ±

ρ −1eρ/2 sinhτ;
u = ±

ρ −1eρ/2 coshτ;
f 2 = 4R2
S

(12.25)
where let’s repeat it again, ρ = r/RS and τ = ct/(2RS). These equations provide the
explicit dependence of the v, u, and f functions on the Schwarzschild coordinates x0
and r. Note that the conformal-factor is divergent for ρ = 0, consistently with what
already found with the Kretschmann scalar [c.f. Eq.(12.2)].
• INSIDE THE SCHWARZSCHILD SPHERE
For r < RS, the function F is negative deﬁned [c.f. Eq.(12.9)]. Then, h′ and g′ must
have the same sign and be either both positive or both negative [c.f. Eq.(12.18)].
Again, we can consider ξ and ξ + x0 (or ξ −x0) as independent variables. Then,
Eq.(12.21) is satisﬁed if and only if its lhs and rhs are equal to the same constant,
call it η again. Eq.(12.21) suggests to look again for exponential solutions. Then, it
is easy to verify that the following expressions
h(ξ +x0) = ±eη(ξ+x0)
2
;
g(ξ −x0) = ±eη(ξ−x0)
2
;
F(ξ) = −η2e2ηξ;
(12.26)
are solutions of Eq.(12.19), Eq.(12.20), and Eq.(12.21). The notation of Eq.(12.26)
requires to take for both the h and g functions either the plus or the minus sign. When

r < RS, Eq.(12.10) yields eξ = (1−r/RS)RS er. Then,

(12.27c)
Let’s stress once more that the v and u functions must have the same sign, either
positive or negative. Again, the constant η must be chosen by requiring the regularity
of the conformal factor at r = RS. Note that this yields the same value used in Section
12.4, η = (2RS)−1. Then, for r < RS, the Schwarzschild coordinates map into the
Kruskal-Szekeres coordinates as indicated in the following expressions
v = ±

u = ±

1−ρeρ/2 sinhτ;
f 2 = 4R2

(12.28)
where again, ρ = r/RS and τ = ct/(2RS).
• CONCLUSION
Eq.(12.25) and Eq.(12.28) show that the conformal factor has the same expression for
both ρ > 1 and ρ < 1. Thus, on the basis of the above consideration and discussion,
we can now write Eq.(12.6) in its ﬁnal form
ds2 = 4R2
S

dθ 2 +sin2 θdφ 2
(12.29)
This clearly shows that the singularity of the Schwarzschild metric at r = RS is
just a coordinate singularity. Thus, the Kruskal-Szekeres coordinate system has the
advantage of providing a metric that well-behaves everywhere except for the only
physical singularity of the Schwarzschild solution at r = 0.
12.5
THE KRUSKAL-SZEKERES PLANE
Consider now the Kruskal-Szekeres u −v plane and write both Eq.(12.25) and
Eq.(12.28) in the following form:
ρ > 1
⇒
u2 −v2 = (ρ −1)eρ;
v = u tanhτ
(12.30a)
ρ < 1
⇒
v2 −u2 = (1−ρ)eρ;
u = v tanhτ
(12.30b)
This clearly shows the consistency of these two equations once the roles of v and u
have been swapped. As we will see, this will ensure continuity in passing from the
exterior to the interior of the Schwarzschild sphere.

The Kruskal-Szekeres plane. For ρ > 1, the gray (B and D) regions are forbid-
den. Events with the same Schwarzschild radial and time coordinate, ρ and τ, are hyperbolae
(continuous lines) and straight (dashed) lines, see text.
• OUTSIDE THE SCHWARZSCHILD SPHERE
In this regime, ρ > 1, Eq.(12.30a)] holds. Then, we must have either u > |v| or
u < −|v|. These two regions of the Kruskal-Szekeres plane are labeled A and C in
Figure 12.2. The two gray areas, labeled B and D in the same Figure, do not fulﬁll
the previous requirements and then are forbidden regions when ρ > 1.
Eq.(12.30a)] also shows that events with the same Schwarzschild radial coordi-
nate ρ are mapped into hyperbolae that intersect the u-axis. As shown in Figure
12.2, decreasing ρ pushes the hyperbolae toward their asymptotes, the bisectors
of the u −v plane, while their vertexes get nearer and nearer to the origin of the
Kruskal-Szekeres coordinate system. Thus, events with ρ ≃1 are mapped into the
two branches of the bisectors, v = ±u, delimiting the A and C regions. Note that for
ρ = 1, the hyperbola degenerates to the origin of the u−v plane [c.f. Eq.(12.25)]
Events with the same value of the Schwarzschild time coordinate τ are mapped
into straight lines, with angular coefﬁcient tanhτ [c.f. Eq.(12.30a)]. It follows that the
u-axis contains all the events with a Schwarzschild time coordinate τ = 0. For pos-
itive (negative) t values, the angular coefﬁcient increases (decreases) progressively
[c.f. Figure 12.2]. Note that for t →∞(t →−∞), v = u (v = −u). Thus, the two bi-
sectors delimiting the A and C regions of the u −v plane are lines corresponding to
ρ = 1 and τ = ∞.
A single event of Schwarzschild coordinates τ and ρ is then mapped in the A or
C region of the u −v plane at the intersection point between the hyperbola of given
ρ and the straight line of given τ [c.f. Figure 12.2].
• THE “EMBEDDING” PROCEDURE
It is worth stressing that in spite of their obvious symmetry, the A and C regions are
different in an intrinsic and fundamental sense. To discuss this point, let’s consider

168
An Overview of General Relativity and Space-Time
two events that occur at v = 0 in −|u| and |u|. By construction, v = 0 corresponds
to the Schwarzschild coordinate τ = 0, whereas both the events at −|u| and |u| are
characterized by being at the same distance from the Schwarzschild radius. Now,
we can imagine to keep v = 0 and to progressively increase |u|. In doing this, we
are identifying events further and further away from the Schwarzschild sphere. In
particular, for u →−∞, we are far enough from the black hole to be in a (almost)
Minkowski space-time. The same occurs when u →∞as, also in this case, the black
hole is at an inﬁnite distance. Now the question to be answered is the following: is
the Minkowski space-time of an observer with v = 0 and u = ∞the same Minkowsky
space-time of an observer with v = 0 but u = −∞? To answer to this question, let’s
follow the same “embedding” procedure used in Section 9.3. So, let’s ﬁrst write the
2D surface (t = const and θ = π/2) of the Schwarzschild space-time [c.f. Eq.(9.3)]
dσ2 =

dr2 +r2dφ 2
(12.31)
and “embed” it into a 3D Euclidean space with cylindrical coordinates
dℓ2 = dr2 +r2dφ 2 +dz2
(12.32)
As done in Section 9.3, we equate Eq.(12.31) and Eq.(12.32) to conclude that r = r
and φ = φ. Then, by using again Eq.(9.5), we get

(12.33)
Integrating Eq.(12.34) leads to explicitly write the function z(r)
z(r) = ±

4RS(r −RS)
(12.34)
Note that we are considering here both the positive and negative values of z(r), un-
like what was done in Eq.(9.7). The 2D surface described by the metric given in
Eq.(12.31) is shown in Figure 12.3. The embedding procedure shows that the geom-
etry of the 2D equatorial (θ = π/2) slice of the 3D Schwarzschild hypersurface at
t = 0 consists of two, distinct, aymptotically ﬂat universes connected by a bridge or
wormhole. Such a bridge is the so-called Einstein-Rosen bridge.
So, the condition of being outside the Schwarzschild sphere provides two differ-
ent solutions for the Kruskal-Szekeres coordinates, one with the plus and the other
with the minus sign [c.f. Eq.(12.34)], corresponding, e.g., to the A and C portions of
the u −v plane [see Figure 12.2]. This is an important point: the Kruskal-Szekeres
coordinates provide the maximal analytical extension of the Schwarzschild solution,
the latter covering only one half of a broader domain.
It must also be stressed that the surface shown Figure 12.3 is a sort of snap-
shot at Schwarzschild coordinate τ = const. However, on the basis of the Jebsen-
Birkhoff theorem, we can say that the geometry outside the Schwarzschild radius

is independent on time. On the other hand, the existence and the dimension of the
Einstein-Rosen bridge is subjected on how this surface evolve on scales less than the
Schwarzschild radius.

For ρ < 1, Eq.(12.30b) requires v > |u| and v < −|u|. This excludes the A and C re-
gions discussed above [see Figure 12.4]. In the allowed regions, B and D, events with
a given ρ are still mapped into hyperbolae that now intersect the v-axis. Note that
Schwarzschild singularity at ρ = 0 is mapped into two hyperbolae, v =
√
u2 +1 and
v = −
√
u2 +1. It follows that the two dark gray regions of Figure 12.4—those above
and below these two (dashed) hyperbolae—are forbidden region of the Kruskal-
Szekeres plane. Then, when ρ < 1, the only allowed regions of the Kruskal-Szekeres
space-time are the white portion of the B and D regions [c.f. Figure 12.4]. In spite
of their symmetry, the B and D regions are again profoundly different. First, the D
region is equivalent to the B region but with the time inverted. So, the singularity in
the D region, v = −
√
u2 +1 occurred in the past. This is the so-called white hole.
The main difference between a white and a black hole is that matter escape from the
former, without being trapped as in the latter. Also, the event horizon of a white hole
forbid the entry rather than the exit of matter (we cannot enter into something the
existed in the past), while for a black hole is exactly the contrary.
As ρ increases from 0 to unity, the hyperbolae get nearer and nearer to their
asymptotes, while the vertexes progressively approach the origin of the u−v plane.
As a result, events with ρ ≃1 are again mapped into the two bisectors, v = ±u, de-
limiting the B and D regions. Note that the functional form of the hyperbolae given
in Eq.(12.30) is the same for ρ greater or smaller than unity. This is an important fea-
ture of the Kruskal-Szekeres coordinate system. In fact, it is this feature that ensures
consistency and, most of all, continuity in the treatment of the two regimes: ρ < 1
and ρ > 1. Indeed, as ρ →1, the bisectors v = u and v = −u are approached by both
the solutions given in Eq.(12.30), although from opposite sides.

For ρ < 1, the light gray, A and C, regions are forbidden. The hyperbolae (con-
tinuous lines) identify events with the same radial coordinate ρ < 1. The straight (dotted) lines
identify events with the same time coordinate τ. The dark gray region, above and below the
two (dashed) hyperbolae representing ρ = 0, is also forbidden regions. The white portion is
only allowed for ρ < 1.
A given value of the Schwarzschild time coordinate τ identiﬁes straight lines of
the u −v plane with angular coefﬁcient 1/tanhτ. For positive (negative) values of
τ, the angular coefﬁcient of the corresponding straight lines decreases (increases)
progressively. Note that for t →±∞, these straight lines become bisectors of the
u−v plane. In particular, the bisector corresponding to τ = +∞separates the A and
B regions, as well as the C and D ones. Likewise, the bisector corresponding to
τ = −∞separates the B and C regions, as well as the D and A ones [see Figure 12.4]
12.6
THE SCHWARZSCHILD BLACK HOLE
It is important to stress that the metric given in Eq.(12.29) is an exact mathemat-
ical solution of the Einstein ﬁeld equations. The question about the physical rele-
vance of white holes and wormholes remain open. In any case, remember that the
Schwarzschild solution is valid in the “vacuum”. So, in real life, the world line of
a point on the surface of a collapsing star can give the boundary of the meaning-
ful portion of the Kruskal-Szekeres plane. The region on the right of this world line
identiﬁes the “vacuum”, whereas the region on the left of the worldline requires the
solution of the ﬁeld equation in the presence of matter. This point, addressed by
Schwarzschild in 1916, will be discussed later in the book, in Section 14.2. So, it
turns out that the A and B regions are of more direct physical interest to discuss the
Schwarzschild black hole.
Note that, by construction, the bisectors of the u−v plane describe the light cone.
Using conformally ﬂat coordinates allows to draw a strict analogy with Special Rel-
ativity. In particular, it makes sense to assign to the Kruskal-Szekeres u and v coordi-

Light traveling inwards moves along the dashed line, a bisector of the Kruskal-
Szekeres plane. The black dot is at the intersection of the hyperbola (continuous black
line) identifying the position, ρ, with the straight (dot-dashed line) identifying the time, τ.
Then, light ray reaches ρ = 1, the (dotted) bisector of the Kruskal-Szekeres plane, enters the

nates the role of “radial” and “time” markers. Note that because of Eq.(12.29), both
g00 and g11 maintain their sign when we cross the horizon. So, the v and u directions
are always time- and space-like. This is in contrast with the case of Schwarzschild
coordinates, where ρ and τ are space- and time-like (time- and space-like) outside
(inside) the horizon.
There is another point that must be stressed. The metric given in Eq.(12.6) is
conformally ﬂat. It follows that the light cones have an opening of 90o with their
axes always parallel to the v-axis. It follows that the world-line of test particles must
necessarily be inside these cones. In other words, free-falling test-particles in the A
regions are forced to move vertically and not horizontally. In so doing, they cannot
miss the singularity in the B region. Let’s consider light traveling inward toward the
center of symmetry of the Schwarzschild geometry. As seen in Section 9.7, light is
captured by the central body if the impact parameter b is less than 3
√
3RS/2. This
result was derived on the basis of the Schwarzschild solution and, then, for radial dis-
tances larger than RS. However, the use of Kruskal-Szekeres coordinates allows us to
extend the considerations of Section 9.7 to the case ρ < 1. Light coming from inﬁn-
ity and approaching the central body is described, for example, by the dashed line of
Figure 12.5. In this speciﬁc case, light ray arrives in r = 1.3RS at a coordinate time
t = 1.29RS/c: this event is marked with a black bullet point (see Figure 12.5). When
the light ray intersect the bisector v = u, the Schwarzschild coordinate time is t = ∞
(see the gray bullet point in Figure 12.5). Note that when we move further along the
dashed line (toward r = 0), both the Schwarzschild radial and the time coordinates
decrease [see Section 12.5]. This underlines the inadequacy of the Schwarzschild
time coordinate to play the role of time marker inside the Schwarzschild sphere.

172
An Overview of General Relativity and Space-Time
In a very analogous way, we can study the complementary situation of light mov-
ing radially outwards w.r.t. to central body. As light moves outwards, both ρ and τ
increase. When light intersects the bisector v = u (the gray bullet point of Figure
12.5), the Schwarzschild coordinate time is formally t = ∞. On the basis of the dis-
cussion of Section 7.5, we know that an observer at inﬁnity measures a gravitational
redshift of the emitted radiation. Since g00(RS) = 0 and g00(∞) = 1, a photon emit-
ted from the Schwarzschild sphere will be observed at inﬁnity at zero frequency [c.f.
Eq.(7.9)]—that is, the photon cannot be observed. So, the Schwarzschild sphere ab-
sorbs the radially incoming radiation without emitting none: this is why, as already
anticipated, a black hole is black.

13 Field Equations in
Non-“Empty” Space-Times
13.1
INTRODUCTION
The ﬁeld equations used up to now have provided the tool for studying the geometry
of the space-time in the “vacuum”. It was possible to resolve them analytically, to
ﬁnd the Schwarzschild solution, and, most importantly, to observationally test the
General Relativity predictions on planetary scales. We want now to extend this line
of reasoning to ﬁnd the geometry of space-time not outside, but rather within a given
matter/energy distribution. The goal of this chapter is then to write the ﬁeld equations
of General Relativity not in the “vacuum”, but rather in non-empty region of the
space.
13.2
FIELD EQUATIONS: REQUIREMENTS
As discussed in Section 8.4, the ﬁeld equations in the “vacuum” are provided by the
vanishing of the Einstein tensor. In the weak ﬁeld limit, these equations contain the
Laplace equation. In the same limit, but in the presence of matter, we have rather to
deal with the Poisson equation, ∆U = 4πGρ. This suggests that the ﬁeld equations
should be obtained by equating the Einstein tensor, describing the geometry of space-
time, to a rank-two tensor, describing the properties of the matter/radiation energy.
To ﬁnd how to covariantly describe these properties, consider the simple case of a
Minkowski space-time, and let’s choose two inertial reference frames: the lab. frame
K , and a frame K ′ uniformly sliding w.r.t. K along its x-axis at constant velocity
V. Consider now a cloud of particles at rest in K ′. If m0 and n0 are their mass and
number density, then the cloud proper mass density is given by ρ0 = m0n0. However,
an observer in the lab. frame would measure a mass density
ρ = ρ0γ2
(13.1)
The γ2 appears because in the lab. frame: i) the mass of the particles increases (m0 →
m0γ); ii) the volume containing the cloud decreases because of the length contraction
along the x-axis (V = V0/γ). Thus, Eq.(13.1) clearly shows that the mass density is
neither an invariant nor the component of a four-vector. In the last case, Eq.(B2.1.a)
and Eq.(2.16) would only yield a linear dependence on γ. So, to have a quadratic
dependence on the Lorentz factor, we have to conclude that the mass density must
necessarily be the component of a rank-two tensor. Let’s restrict to the case of a
perfect ﬂuid, with no viscosity or heat conduction. It follows that the quantities useful
to construct a rank-two tensor are i) the ﬂuid proper density and pressure, ρ0 and p0;
ii) the ﬂuid four-velocity, uµ; iii) the metric tensor, ηαβ. Let’s then consider the

174

following combination, which clearly provides a rank two, symmetric tensor
T µν = ρ0c2uµuν + p0 [uµuν −ηµν]
(13.2)
For a ﬂuid with a vanishing pressure, Eq.(13.2) yields
T 00 = ρ0c2γ2 = ρc2
(13.3)
Thus, the time-time component of the T µν tensor provides the relativistic energy
density of the ﬂuid, containing the contributions coming from both the rest energy
and the motion of the ﬂuid, in full agreement with Eq.(13.1).
13.3
CONSERVATION LAWS FOR A RELATIVISTIC FLUID
To verify that the whole combination given in Eq.(13.2) makes sense at all, let’s
consider its non-relativistic limit: p0 ≪ρ0c2; uµ ≃{1,vk/c}; (vk/c)2 ≪1. In this
limit,
T 00 ≃ρ0c2;
T 0i ≃ρ0cvi;
T ik ≃ρ0vivk + p0δ ik
(13.4)
where δ ik is the Kronecker symbol. Let’s now impose the vanishing of the four-
divergence of the energy-momentum tensor: T µν ,ν = 0. The time-component of this
equation provides

∂x0 (ρ0c2)+ ∂

THE MATTER ENERGY-MOMENTUM TENSOR
Let’s now extend the discussion of the previous section to the more general case of
pseudo-Riemannian, curved space-times. On the basis of the Principle of General

Field Equations in Non-“Empty” Space-Times
175
Covariance [c.f. Section 4.7], all the physical laws must have the same form in all
reference frames. This is why we want to write them in terms of tensor equations.
Reversing the order of reasoning, we can state that if a tensor equation is valid in the
absence of gravity, e.g. in the local inertial reference frame, then it must also be valid
in the presence of any arbitrary gravitational ﬁeld. Now, Eq.(13.7) and Eq.(13.8)
were derived in the framework of Special Relativity or, equivalently, in the local in-
ertial reference frame where the metric reduces to the Minkowski one and the covari-
ant derivatives are just ordinary ones. However, in a generic frame, ηµν →gµν(xτ)
and ordinary derivatives become covariant derivatives. So, on the basis of general
covariance principle, it is natural to generalize Eq.(13.7) and Eq.(13.8) as follows.
THE MATTER ENERGY- MOMENTUM TENSOR
The covariant expression of the energy-momentum tensor is given by
T µν =

ρ0c2 + p

uµuν −pgµν
(13.9)
The covariant expression of its four-divergence must be written as follows
T µν ;ν = 0
(13.10)
Eq.(13.10) can be conveniently rewritten in the following way [see Exercise A.38],
1
√−g
∂
∂xσ
√−gT µσ
+Γµ
σνT νσ = 0
(13.11)
Because of the last term, Eq.(13.11) cannot be technically called a conservation equa-
tion. So, it could be more appropriate to refer to Eq.(13.11) as to the equations de-
scribing the properties and the motion of matter that moves in a curved space-time.
To better see this point, let’s consider a “cold” cloud of particles that in the interval
t1 < t < t2 remain conﬁned inside a four-box of proper volume V (4)
p
[see Figure 13.1].
By construction, there is not a net ﬂux of particles through the “lateral” hypersurfaces
of the four-box. Thus, on those hypersurfaces, the energy-momentum tensor can be
safely be set to zero.
The inﬁnitesimal proper and coordinate four-volume elements are related:
dV (4)
p
= √−gdV (4) [c.f. Eq.(8.22)]. It follows that the integral of Eq.(13.11) over
an arbitrary proper four-volume can be written as follows:

(13.12)
The ﬁrst integral can be easily evaluated by applying the divergence theorem. In fact,
the only non-vanishing ﬂux of particles has to do with the entrance and exit from
“below” and from “above”, i.e. through the lower and upper spatial hypersurface of
the four-box at t1 and t2 [see Figure 13.1]. Then,

The motion of a “cold” cloud of particles in space-time. The density of the
cloud is shown as contour plots in the hyperplanes at constant t: from white (highest density)
to dark gray (zero density). For t1 < t < t2, the cloud is always inside the chosen four-box.
Note that for a cold cloud (p ≃0) T µ0 = ρ0c2(dxµ/ds)(dx0/ds). Also, proper and
coordinate four-volumes are related: dV (4)

p

where dτ and dV (3)

For a “cold” cloud, the individual particle four-velocities basically coincide with the
bulk four-velocity of the cloud itself. Then, they are not expected to vary on the two
spatial hypersurfaces at t1 and t2. If this is the case, the integral over dV (3)
p
involves
only the proper density and not the four-velocities. If we deﬁne the proper mass of
the cloud in the standard way, M =

This is not unexpected: a ﬂuid element subjected only to an external gravitational
ﬁeld moves along geodesics of the space-time.
13.5
THE EM ENERGY-MOMENTUM TENSOR
It is of interest to extend the considerations done in Section 13.3 to ﬁnd an explicit
expression for the energy-momentum tensor of an electromagnetic ﬁeld. To do so,
let’s consider a charged ﬂuid element moving in an electric and/or magnetic ﬁeld. As
it is well known, that element will move according to the following equation

(13.18)
Here ρ0 and σ0 are the matter and electric charge proper densities, whereas⃗v is the
velocity of the ﬂuid element. The term on the lhs can be interpreted as the four-
divergence of the energy-momentum tensor of a perfect, pressure-less ﬂuid [c.f.
Eq.(13.6)]. The term on the rhs can be conveniently written in terms of the elec-
tromagnetic tensor, Fkβ, and of the four-current density Jβ [see Box 13.1]. In fact,
Eq.(13.18) can be written in a very compact way:
T kβ
,β = −1
cFkβJβ
(13.19)
To keep contact with the formalism of Section 13.3, let’s introduce a radiation
energy-momentum tensor, Sαβ say, and write

diagonal: T αβ = diag{ε, p, p, p}. By comparing T αβ with Sαβ, we concude that
an isotropic radiation ﬁeld can be described by a photon gas with equation of state

FIELD EQUATIONS INSIDE A MATTER/ENERGY DISTRIBUTION
Having now the Poisson equation in the back of our mind [c.f. Section 13.2], it is
quite natural to ask what happens if we equate, unless of a constant, the Einstein and
the energy-momentum tensors.
Gαβ = χT αβ

This seems reasonable also because the covariant four-divergence of both these ten-
sors vanishes [c.f. Eq.(8.21) and Eq.(13.5)]. Now, in force of Eq.(8.15), we can

Now, we know that in the weak ﬁeld limit R00 = ∇2U/c2 [c.f. Eq.(8.12)]. In the same
limit, p0 ≪ρ0c2 ≃ρc2 and uµuµ = 1 ≃u0u0. It follows that T 00 = T = ρc2. Thus,
the time-time component of Eq.(13.31) provides

So, the weak ﬁeld limit of Eq.(13.32) contains the Poisson equation, provided that
χ = 8πG/c4. We can then generalize the results of Section 8.5 to the case of non-
empty space, including, for sake of generality, the contribution of a non-vanishing
Cosmological Constant.

THE REISSNER-NORDSTROM SOLUTION
The ﬁeld equations given in Eq.(13.34) allow us to extend the Schwarzschild solution
to the case of a point mass with a net electric charge. This leads to the so-called
Reissner-Nordstrom solution. We will again assume spherical symmetry and a polar
coordinate system. As a consequence, the metric can be still written in a stationary
form and in terms of only two unknown functions [c.f. Eq.(8.57]:

An Overview of General Relativity and Space-Time
We are interested in the geometry of the space-time outside the central body—that
is, in the “vacuum”. So, by ignoring the current density in Eq.(B13.1.cb), we have
∂(√−gF01)/∂r = 0. This yields
r2e−(ν+λ)/2E(r) = C
(13.42)
where C is an integration constant we have to determine. To do so, remember
that at large distance from the point mass, the space-time must be (almost) ﬂat:
limr→∞ν(r) = λ(r) = 0. So, limr→∞E(r) = C /r2. This Coulomb’s inverse-square
law behavior suggests to identify the constant C with the net electric charge of the
central body, Q say. As a result,
E(r) = e(ν+λ)/2 Q

(13.43)

2: We have three different real solutions [see Figure 13.4]. f(x) has a
maximum at x2 and two minima at x1 and x3 [see Figure 13.5]. So, as in the
Schwarzschild case, stable orbits occur outside the horizon at radii ≃x3. For
α > 2, there are unstable circular orbits at a radius x2.

FREE-FALL ON THE REISSNER-NORDSTROM BLACK HOLE
Following what was done in Section 9.7, let’s study the radial infall of a neutral test-
particle into a Reissner-Nordstrom black hole. For the sake of simplicity, let’s assume
that the particle is initially at rest at inﬁnity. Then, Eq.(9.16) provides

13.11
THE KERR SOLUTION
In Section 9.2 we discussed the Schwarzschild solution for a point mass. This solu-
tion is fully characterized by a single parameter, the geometrical mass of the central
body m = GM/c2. Then, in Section 13.8 we consider the case of a charged point
mass and discussed the Reissner-Nordstrom solution. This solution is fully charac-
terized by two parameters, the geometrical mass of the central body, m, and its geo-
metrical charge q = GQ2/c4. However, real astronomical objects show very often a
non-vanishing angular momentum. So, it makes sense to generalize our previous dis-
cussions to include a third physical quantity, the angular momentum J of the central
body. It is then convenient to deﬁne the parameter a = GJ/(c3M) that measures the
angular momentum per unit mass of the source. We can refer to the quantity Ma as to
the geometric angular momentum, setting G = c = 1. To simplify the discussion and
to make a better contact with the Reissner-Nordstrom solution, we will limit here to
the case q = 0, so to have again only two parameters, m and a. The metric describing
the geometry of the space-time outside a body with mass and angular momentum
was derived in 1963 by Kerr [52]. It can be written as follows
ds2 =dx02 −dx2 −dy2 −dz2

dx0 + r(xdx+ydy)
a2 +r2

2
(13.70)
Note that the coordinates used in Eq.(13.70), the so-called Kerr-Schild coordinates,
are not Cartesian coordinates. Indeed, they are related to polar coordinates by the
following transformations
x =

r2 +a2 sinθ cosφ
y =

r2 +a2 sinθ sinφ
z = rcosθ
(13.71)
which imply
x2 +y2
r2 +a2 + z2
r2 = 1
(13.72)
This clearly shows that the correct Cartesian relation is recovered only if a = 0. Note
also that the metric given in Eq.(13.70) shows a physical singularity at r = 0 and

Field Equations in Non-“Empty” Space-Times
189
z = 0, that is at [c.f. Eq.(13.72)]
x2 +y2 = a2
(13.73)
We can then conclude that Kerr black hole exhibit, independently on the values of
m and a, a physical singularity which, unlike what happens for Schwarzschild solu-
tion, is not point-like: it is a ring of radius a in the equatorial plane [remember that
z = 0 implies θ = π/2,c.f. Eq.(13.71)]. For a →0, the ring collapse to a point in the
origin and we recover the physical, point-like singularity of the Schwarzschild met-
ric. We can use Eq.(13.71) to re-express Eq.(13.70) in terms of the Boyer-Linquist
coordinates {x0,r,θ,φ}. After some algebra, we get

Here, we deﬁned
ρ2 = r2 +a2 cos2 θ
(13.75)
and
∆= r2 −2mr +a2
(13.76)
Note that for r →∞, both ρ and ∆tend to r. It turns out that in this limit Eq.(13.74)
reduces to the Minkowski metric, as we should have expected: the Kerr space-time
is asymptotically ﬂat. Also, the metric is stationary, as the metric coefﬁcient does not
explicitly depend on time. However, because of the off diagonal term proportional to
dx0dφ, the metric is not invariant under time inversion, t →−t. So, we don’t expect
the metric to be static. Last, but not least, the metric coefﬁcients don’t depend on φ
as required by the axial symmetry of the problem.
The metric given in Eq.(13.74) becomes singular when ρ = 0, that is when r = 0
and θ = π/2 (corresponding to z = 0). This is the same physical singularity given
by Eq.(13.73): a ring of radius a in the equatorial plane. There are, however, other
coordinate singularities that didn’t appear in Eq.(13.70), but that it is important to
discuss. Let’s consider ﬁrst the g11 metric coefﬁcient. It doesn’t well behave if ∆= 0.
This might happen depending on the a/m ratio. If a/m < 1, we have two distinct
horizons
r± = m±

m2 −a2
(13.77)
These horizons coincide if a/m = 1, but disappear if a/m > 1: in this case, the equa-
tion ∆= 0 doesn’t admit real solutions. Note that when a →0, as it could have been
expected, r−→0 and r+ →2m = RS, the event horizon of the Schwarzschild space-
time. The outer and inner horizons are plotted in Figure 13.7. Note the similarity
with the Reissner-Nordstrom results shown in Figure 13.2. The solutions given in
Eq.(13.77) actually identify two closed surfaces, Σ+ and Σ−, the latter being always
contained inside the former. So, it turns out that Σ+ is the relevant surface dividing
the region accessible from the external region (that is, from r much larger than m and

a), playing the same role of the Schwarzschild surface or of the external horizon in
the Reissner-Nordstrom solution.
In the Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstrom solutions, the Schwarzschild sur-
face and the external Reissner-Nordstrom horizon represent also the surfaces of in-
ﬁnity redshift, because of the simultaneous vanishing of g00 and g11. This is not the
case for the Kerr black hole. In fact, the condition g00 = 0 implies 2mr = ρ2 [c.f.
Eq.(13.74)]. For a < m, we get the following solutions
s± = m±

m2 −a2 cos2 θ
(13.78)
corresponding to two closed surfaces, S+ and S−. Now it turns out that the surface S+
always contains the surface Σ+, while the reverse is true for S−and Σ−[see Figure
13.8].
The nature of S+ and Σ+ is very different indeed. The inﬁnite redshift surface,
S+, does not represent a “barrier”: both massive test-particles and photons can cross
it in either directions, with the only exception of the poles (θ = 0 and θ = π) where
r+ = s+. On the contrary, Σ+ must be regarded as the critical surface below which
a body becomes a black hole, analogous to the Schwarzschild or to the Reissner-
Nordstrom black hole. The region between S+ and Σ+ is called ergosphere. There are
several interesting effects due to the not-coincidence of the inﬁnite redshift surface
with the external horizon. For example, in the ergosphere the motion of test-particles
is skewed in the same direction as the black hole rotation, even if they were initially
in free-fall with zero angular momentum. Another interesting consequence of the
existence of an ergosphere is the so-called Penrose effect [64]. Imagine a particle
entering the ergosphere and, while there, decaying in two particles. If one of the
decay product crosses the event horizon, the other can get out of the ergosphere. The
point is that, under appropriate circumstances, the latter can leave the ergosphere
with a greater energy than the initial particle had when it entered. So, the Penrose
effects predict the possibility of extracting energy from a black hole, at the expense of

14 Further Applications of the
Field Equations
14.1
INTRODUCTION
We discussed the ﬁeld equations needed to study the geometry of the space-time
within a given matter/energy distribution, fully described by a suitable energy-
momentum tensor. In that framework, we derived the Reissner-Nordstrom solution,
generalizing the Schwarzschild solution to the case of a charged point mass. The
goal of this chapter is to apply the ﬁeld equations to different matter/energy conﬁgu-
rations, relaxing the point mass approximation used up to now.
14.2
THE INNER SCHWARZSCHILD SPACE-TIME
Consider an isotropic and incompressible mass distribution. Let’s assume that the
gravitational attraction is completely counterbalanced by the pressure gradients, i.e.,
the considered structure is in hydrostatic equilibrium. The question to be asked is the
following: which is the geometry of the space-time inside this matter distribution?
This problem was addressed for the ﬁrst time by Karl Schwarzschild in 1916 [80,83],
who found an analytical solution of the ﬁeld equations. We refer to this solution as
to the inner Schwarzschild solution.
Note that the symmetries of the problem are the same as those discussed in Section
8.8. In addition, because of the assumed equilibrium conﬁguration, we don’t expect
the metric to be time dependent. Thus, we can write the square of the line element as
in Eq.(8.57), but ignoring the time dependence of the ν and λ unknown functions:
ds2 = eν(r)

It follows that the components of the Einstein tensor are those given in Eq.(13.40).
The subscript int indicates that the values of the radial coordinate are less or equal
to the coordinate radius of the considered structure: r ≤R. To ﬁnd the two unknown
functions, ν(r) and λ(r), we will use the equations of motion [c.f. Eq.(13.10)] and
the ﬁeld equations with a vanishing Cosmological Constant [c.f. Eq.(13.34)].
• HYDROSTATIC EQUILIBRIUM
Since we want to deal with an incompressible ﬂuid, we can safely assume that the
mass density is a constant: ρ = const. Also, hydrostatic equilibrium implies that
the four-velocities of the ﬂuid elements have vanishing spatial components: uα(r) ≡
{e−ν(r)/2,0,0,0}. Thus, the energy momentum tensor results to be [c.f. Eq.(13.9)]

yields [see Exercise A.41]

2(ρc2 + p)dν
dr = 0
(14.4)
In the weak ﬁeld limit, p ≪ρc2, eν ≃1 + ν and ν ≃2U/c2 [see, e.g., Eq.(6.18)].
Then, Eq.(14.4) reduces to the classical hydrostatic equilibrium condition
dp
dr = ρ dU
dr
(14.5)
where gravity is completely counterbalanced by the pressure gradients. Eq.(14.4)
shows that similar concepts are also found in General Relativity, provided that we
add to the classical term a new term, proportional to the pressure. It follows that in
General Relativity pressure not only ﬁghts against gravity, but it also contributes to it.
This is why the resolution of the hydrostatic equilibrium problem requires to know,
besides the geometry of the space-time, also the behavior of the matter density and
pressure as a function of the radial coordinate. Under the hypothesis of a uniform
density distribution, the integration of Eq.(14.4) provides
(ρc2 + p) =

where, just for the sake of convenience, we wrote the exponential of the integration
constant as c4C3/(8πG). The constant C3 will be determined below.

not unexpected. In a way, it shows an extension to non-“empty” space of the Jebsen-
Birkhoff theorem [c.f. Section 9.4]: the space-time geometry at a coordinate distance
r from the center of symmetry is determined only by Mint(r), the mass inside a sphere
of radius r [see Figure 14.1]. We will discuss this point again in Section 14.5.

ter 10 to test the predictions of General Relativity on planetary scales. We can also

0.89 (dashed line) and 0.83 (dotted line), respectively.

where dΩ2 = dθ 2 + sin2 θdφ 2. The constraints given in Eq.(14.23) and Eq.(14.24)
force us to conclude that a homogeneous and isotropic mass distribution in hydro-
static equilibrium can exist if and only if its radius is larger than the Schwarzschild
radius by at least a factor of 9/8.1 Because of this constraint, the metric does not
show any pathology. The g00 and g11 metric coefﬁcients are shown in Figure 14.3.
Note that g11 remain ﬁnite, although discontinuous at the border of the structure.
This is not unexpected, as there both ρ and p(R) vanish.
1 Note that a slighter looser condition can also be derived by noting that e−λ(r)

is positive deﬁned. Thus,
Eq.(14.8) yields R < r0 or R > RS.

where the constant C is ﬁxed by requiring that at the boundary, r = R, the internal

Figure 14.4b this solution is shown together with what was obtained for the external
Schwarzschild solution [see, e.g., Eq.(9.7)]. It is clear the smooth transition from the
inside (r ≤R) and the outside (r ≥R) of the considered structure, as long as R > RS.

PROPER VS. OBSERVABLE MASS
Joining the inner and outer Schwarzschild solutions led us to Eq.(14.16), where M is
the total, observable mass of the central body. As already mentioned, it is this mass
that can be measured at large distances with a number of tests, like those discussed
in Chapter 10. The observable mass M can then be interpreted as the body active
mass, the one responsible for the curvature of the space-time at the exterior of the

central body [c.f. Eq.(9.1)]. To the observable mass, contribute the rest mass, as well
as the equivalent mass due to any other form of energies, including the gravitational
energy. To see this, let’s use Eq.(14.10) and write Mint(R) in a slightly different form

An Overview of General Relativity and Space-Time
If Mp(R) > Mint(R), then to break apart a bound structure it is necessary to do some
work on it. Thus, we can rewrite Eq.(14.33) to deﬁne the binding energy as follows:
|W| = ∆Mc2
(14.34)
where ∆M = Mp(R) −Mint(R) is the difference between the proper and observable
masses. Eq.(14.34) should sound more than plausible, showing how in General Rel-
ativity the mass-energy equivalence can be extended also to the case of the gravita-
tional binding energy.
14.4
SPHERICAL RELATIVISTIC HYDRODYNAMICS
We want to extend the considerations of Section 14.2 by relaxing two assumptions:
the uniform density distribution and the hydrostatic equilibrium. We will still con-
sider an isotropic mass distribution, as this greatly helps in simplifying the writing
of the metric. Without loss of generality, we can choose comoving Lagrangian rather
than Eulerian coordinates. Thus, r,θ and φ must be considered as (constant) ﬂags
that identify a given ﬂuid element. In this case, the metric can be written as follows:
ds2 = eν(r,t)dt2 −eλ(r,t)dr2 −R2(r,t)

dθ 2 +sin2 θdφ 2
(14.35)
Note that unlike what has been done in Eq.(8.57) and Eq.(14.1), we have now to
consider a new function R(r,t). From a geometrical point of view, R(r,t) acts as
a scale factor. From a physical point of view, R(r,t) plays the role of an angular
diameter distance2 of a shell of comoving radius r at a given time t. The surface
and the volume of a sphere of coordinate radius r are then given by 4πR2(r,t) and
4πR3(r,t)/3, respectively.
For what follows, it is useful to deﬁne two new operators, Dt and Dr. The ﬁrst
indicates a partial derivative w.r.t. proper time, Dt ≡e−ν/2(∂/∂t), while the second
a partial derivative w.r.t. the proper radial length, Dr ≡e−λ/2(∂/∂r). Since R is the
(proper) angular distance of a shell of comoving coordinate r, it is reasonable to
interpret the quantity
V(r,t) ≡DtR(r,t)
(14.36)
as the proper (expansion or collapsing) velocity of that shell. To ﬁnd the unknowns
of our problems, the functions ν(r,t), λ(r,t) and R(r,t), we will use the equations
of motion [c.f. Eq.(13.10)] and the ﬁeld equations with a vanishing Cosmological
Constant [c.f. Eq.(13.34)].
• EQUATION OF MOTION
For comoving coordinates, the spatial components of the four-velocity are zero, even
in the absence of hydrostatic equilibrium. Then, u0u0 = 1. It follows that the energy
momentum tensor of a perfect ﬂuid can be written in a very simple form
T α
β = diag{ε,−p,−p,−p}

The proper volume of a shell of (comoving) coordinate r and thickness ∆r is given
by 4πR2eλ/2∆r. Then, Eq.(14.39) is nothing else that the First Principle of Thermo-
dynamics written for an adiabatic transformation: it describes how the energy of a
shell changes due to the work done by pressure forces.

This seems a contradictory result, as we are now studying a conﬁguration out of the
hydrostatic equilibrium. The point is that we are using a coordinate system comoving
with the ﬂuid. In this frame, the ﬂuid elements are and remain at rest.

Given Eq.(14.49),we can write
E = 1
2π
∂(2πR)
eλ/2∂r
(B14.2.a)
Thus, E is proportional to the derivative of the proper circumference length w.r.t. to
its proper radius.
• In Euclidean spaces, this ratio has to be 2π and, then, E has to be unity.
• In Special Relativity, we expect a Lorentz contraction in the radial direction. So, we
have E = γ =

1+ p2/(mpc)2. This shows that V ≡DtR is a momentum per unit
mass [c.f. Eq.(14.50) with M(r,t) = 0].
• For the internal Schwarzschild solution [c.f. Eq.(14.25)], R →r and Rr →1. Then,
E =

1−2GM/(c2r), showing that now curvature comes into play.
• In the weak field limit, Eq.(14.50) yields E = 1+V 2/(2c2)−GM(r,t)/(c2R).
In the absence of pressure gradients, E depends only on the radial coordinate. To see
this point, let’s ﬁrst derive Eq.(14.49) w.r.t. to proper time and, then, divide the result
by E . We get

Thus, the derivative w.r.t. the proper time of the proper velocity of a shell of (co-
moving) coordinate radius r is given by the sum of two terms: the ﬁrst is propor-
tional to the pressure gradient; the second generalizes the Newtonian gravitational
term, ∝M(r,t), by adding the general relativistic effect associated to the “self-
regeneration” of the pressure [see the discussion following, e.g., Eq.(14.4)].
• THE ν FUNCTION
With the introduction of the operator Dt = e−ν/2(∂/∂t), the element g00 of the metric
tensor formally disappeared from all the equations we have derived so far. To provide
its explicit expression, let’s consider the particle number density, n(r,t), of a shell of
comoving radius r and width ∆r. The number of particles in the shell is conserved if
∂(nR2eλ/2)/∂t = 0, that is, if

The function F(t) = eC (t) can be eliminated by a change of the time coordinate. In
fact, if mp is the mass of the ﬂuid particles, we can write F(t) = mpc2 f(t). Now,

THE GRAVITATIONAL COLLAPSE
We want to use the results of the previous section to discuss the case of a spheri-
cal, gravitational collapse. For the sake of simplicity, we will limit ourselves to the
case of a pressureless collapse. This approximation is certainly better suited to study
the earlier phases of the collapse. Also, neglecting pressure in General Relativity is
more critical than in the Newtonian case, because of the “regeneration” of pressure
[c.f. Eq.(14.4)]. However, a proper treatment of the collapse with a non-vanishing
pressure would require attacking the problem numerically, and this is beyond the
scope of the present discussion. On the other hand, imposing a pressureless collapse
allows us to derive simple, semi-analytical solutions, whose formalism can be very
easily compared with the Newtonian one. In fact, if pressure vanishes, we have a
number of interesting simpliﬁcations to discuss:
• g00 = 1 [c.f. Eq.(14.64)]
Proper and coordinate time coincide; Dt →∂t; the metric writes [c.f. Eq.(14.54)]
ds2 = dx02 −R2
r(r,t)
E 2(r,t)dr2 −R2(r,t)[dθ 2 +sin2 θdφ 2]
(14.65)
• M = M(r) [c.f. Eq.(B14.1.c)]
The mass contained in each shell doesn’t change with time and can be used as a
convenient (Lagrangian) comoving coordinate
ds2 = dx02 −(∂R/∂M)2

Note that the Eq.(14.67) provides a quite strict analogy with the Newtonian for-
malism, where R(M,t) is the radius of a sphere containing a mass M and Rt(M,t)

parabolic or hyperbolic depending on whether E 2(M) −1 is less, equal or larger
than zero. Note also that the dynamics of a shell enclosing a given mass M depends
only on that mass. This is true for all the shells of the considered structure3. This
sort of “onion” structure [see Figure 14.1] rests, in fact, on the following theorem:
the motions of particles inside any comoving sphere of symmetry are entirely deter-
mined by the matter inside the sphere. This theorem was discussed by Bondi [12],
it is a generalization of the Jebsen-Birkhoff theorem [see Section 9.4] and it is here
formally stated by Eq.(14.67). Given these premises, it is not a surprise that for a
bound structure, the solution of Eq.(14.67) can be written in a parametric form as
follows [c.f. Exercise A.42]:
R(M,t) =

now assume that at some initial time, tin, Rt(M,tin) = 0 for any value of M. Then,
from Eq.( 14.67), E 2
−(M) = 2GM/(c2Rin). As the mass is conserved, this also implies

in/(3c2). According to Eq.(14.68), the collapse starts at
η = π and formally ends at η = 2π (see Figure 14.5). Then, we can conclude that
the collapse (proper) time for an observer comoving (that is, in free-fall) with the

inner shell overtakes an outer shell, or an outer shell collapses faster than an inner one), this is not true

If the mass distribution of the structure under study is initially uniform, and initially
at rest, the collapse time will be the same for all the shells, as Eq.(14.69) does not
depend on the mass. The entire structure will then collapse to a singularity.
It is of interest to note that Eq.(9.23) and Eq.(14.69) yield very similar result. In

case the collapsing shell is bound (E 2 ≡1−E 2

15 Theoretical Cosmology
15.1
INTRODUCTION
The formalism provided by General Relativity can be used to study the global evolu-
tion of the universe. This task seems to be very complex, if not impossible. However,
the problem substantially simpliﬁes by assuming the Cosmological Principle: when
observed on sufﬁciently large scales, the universe is homogeneous and isotropic. The
goal of this chapter is to discuss those cosmological models that, based on the Cos-
mological Principle, are solutions of the ﬁeld equations of General Relativity.
15.2
AN ISOTROPIC AND HOMOGENEOUS MATTER DISTRIBUTION
Let’s start from the simplest case of a universe composed by an ideal, pressureless
ﬂuid. We can take advantage from the discussion of Section 14.5 and write the metric
of the space-time ﬁlled by an isotropic matter distribution in the following form:
ds2 = dx02 −R2
r(r,t)
E 2(r) dr2 −R2(r,t)[dθ 2 +sin2 θdφ 2];
(15.1)
where r, θ and φ are comoving coordinates. Note that the scale-factor R(r,t) has the
dimension of a length, whereas r is an adimensional ﬂag associated with a given ﬂuid
element. To be consistent with the Cosmological Principle, we have now to enforce
homogeneity. To do so, let’s consider two observers, A and B, say. The proper radial
distances of B (A) from A (B) are given by the following expression:
∆ℓ∥
B
A = Rr(rA,t)
E 2(rA) ∆r
B
A ;
∆ℓ∥
A
B = Rr(rB,t)
E 2(rB) ∆r
A
B
(15.2)
These relations imply

= Rrt(rA,t)
Rr(rA,t) ∆ℓ∥

A ;
∂∆ℓ∥
A
B
∂t
= Rrt(rB,t)
Rr(rB,t) ∆ℓ∥
A
B
(15.3)
As usual, the subscript r and t indicate a partial derivative w.r.t. r or t, respectively.
Now, if the universe has to be homogeneous, the relative motion of A and B cannot
depend on the position of the observer. So, in order to enforce homogeneity, we have
to factorize the time and space dependence of the scale-factor given in Eq.(15.1), and
write
R(r,t) = R(t)r
(15.4)
where the new scale-factor R(t) has still the dimension of a length. Under this con-
dition, Eq.(15.3) yields

dt = H(t)ℓ

An Overview of General Relativity and Space-Time
This states that in a homogeneous universe, the rate of change of the proper distance
between two, randomly chosen, cosmic observers is given by the rate of change of
the scale-factor, the so-called Hubble parameter:
H(t) = Rt(t)

tribution writes as follows:

THE FLRW METRIC
The function E (r) was deﬁned as the energy of a ﬂuid element in units of its rest mass
[c.f. Box 11.2]. Let’s now use the ﬁeld equations of General Relativity to simplify
the writing of E (r) on the light of the Cosmological Principle.
For a pressureless ﬂuid of energy density ε, we can write the energy momentum
tensor and its trace as follows: T α β = diag(ε,0,0,0); T = ε. Then, the ﬁeld equations

This is the so-called Friedmann-Lemaˆıtre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric de-
scribing the geometry of space-times with a matter distribution compliant with the
requirements of the Cosmological Principle.
15.4
THE SPATIAL SECTOR OF THE FLRW SPACE-TIME
To have a better grasp on what Eq.(15.14) is telling us about the geometry of our
universe—that is, the spatial sector of the space-time—let’s use again the embed-
ding technique. Consider ﬁrst a 3D-hypersphere embedded in a 4D Euclidean space,
whose metric is given by
dΞ2 = dρ2 +ρ2dθ 2 +ρ2 sin2 θdφ 2 +dw2
(15.15)
An hypersphere has a radius R = ρ2 +w2. It follows that dw2 = ρ2dρ2/(R2 −ρ2).
Then, Eq.(15.15) can be rewritten as follows:
dΣ2
+ = R2
 dν2
1−ν2 +ν2 
dθ 2 +sin2 θdφ 2
(15.16)
Here ν = ρ/R is an a dimensional (comoving) radial coordinate, whereas the sub-
script “+” indicates that the hypersphere has in every point a constant, positive-
deﬁned curvature [see Exercise A.45]. Embedding a 3D hyperplane, w = const, im-
mediately provides
dΣ2
0 = R2 
dν2 +ν2 
dθ 2 +sin2 θdφ 2
(15.17)
where now R is a suitable normalization constant, ν2 = ρ/R and the subscript “0”
indicates that the hyperplane has in every point zero curvature. We might want to
consider also the case of a 3D pseudosphere. Since its equation is given by ρ2 +w2 =
−R2, it follows that dw2 = ρ2dρ2/(R2 +ρ2). So, the metric of a 3D pseudosphere
can be written as follows:
dΣ2
−= R2
 dν2
1+ν2 +ν2 
dθ 2 +sin2 θdφ 2
(15.18)
Here, again, ν = ρ/R is an adimensional (comoving) radial coordinate, whereas the
subscript “−” indicates that the hypersphere has in every point the same, negative-
deﬁned curvature. We can conveniently write Eq.(15.16), Eq.(15.17) and Eq.(15.18)
in a parametric form

where k is the sign of the curvature: +1 for the hypersphere and 0 for the hyperplane
and −1 for the 3D pseudosphere [see Figure 15.1]. On the basis of Eq.(3.48), the 3D
metric of the purely spatial section (or spatial hypersurface) of the space-time can be
written as dℓ2 = γikdxidxk. In the case of Eq.(15.14), we have γik = −gik and then

This is exactly the same expression of Eq.(15.19), a part from the time dependence
of the “radius” R. This should not be a surprise. In fact, from one hand, Eq.(15.19)
describes the geometry of the only 3D hypersurfaces that are both isotropic and ho-
mogeneous—that is, with not preferred directions and with the same value of the
curvature at any point. On the other hand, Eq.(15.20) is the outcome of the ﬁeld
equations [c.f. Eq.(15.10)], once we assume the homogeneity and isotropy of the
space-time [c.f. Eq.(15.14)].
15.5
THE FRIEDMANN EQUATIONS
In the absence of pressure gradients, the function E (r) does not depend on time
[c.f. Eq.(14.53)]. Also, if g00 = 1, then V = Rt [c.f. Eq.(14.36)]. Moreover, for a
homogenous matter distribution, M = 4πρR3/3. It follows that Eq.(14.50) can be
rewritten as follows:

R = Rr [c.f. Eq.(15.4)] and eλ/2 = R/(1 −kr2) [c.f. Eq.(14.54) and Eq.(15.13)].
Thus, Eq.(15.27) can be written as follows:

So, the variation of the energy content of this spherical region is determined by the

adiabatic transformation. On the other hand, adiabaticity is a necessary condition to

maintain over time both the homogeneity and the isotropy of space, as required by
the Cosmological Principle. In fact, a net ﬂux of energy would falsify the isotropy (if
there is a preferential energy ﬂow direction) or homogeneity (if the outward/inward
ﬂux is isotropic).
Note that the spatial components of Eq.(13.10) provide now an identity. In fact,
for g00 = 1 and in the absence of pressure gradients, both νr and pr vanish [c.f.
Eq.(14.41)].
15.7
COSMOLOGICAL PARAMETERS
The ﬁrst Friedmann equation given in Eq.(15.23) shows that R(t) varies with time
at a rate that is determined by the three key ingredients: i) the matter/energy density;
ii) the space curvature; iii) the Cosmological Constant. To simplify the notation, let’s
work in terms of a normalized (or reduced) scale-factor
a(t) ≡R(t)/R0
(15.30)
where R0 = R(t0) and t0 is the present time. So, by construction, a(t0) = 1 today. For
a dust-ﬁlled universe, Eq.(15.28) implies mass conservation: ρ(t) = ρ0/a3, where ρ0
is the matter density at the present time. Thus, Eq.(15.23) becomes

Consider the case of a ﬂat, Ωk = 0, and empty Ω0 = 0 universe, with a non-vanishing,
positive Cosmological Constant, ΩΛ > 0. In this case, Eq.(15.36a) provides an expo-

Λc4/(8πG) [c.f. Eq.(13.38)], and a constant expansion rate, Rt/R =

Λc2/3. This
model satisﬁes the so-called Perfect Cosmological Principle: the universe is homo-
geneous and isotropic both in space and in time. Note that it is possible to transform
Eq.(15.38) in a static metric form, `a la Schwarzschild [see Exercises A.46]

THE CLOSED FRIEDMANN UNIVERSE
In 1922, Friedmann discussed a model with Ω0 > 1, Ωk = 1−Ω0 < 0 and a vanishing
Cosmological Constant ΩΛ = 0 [35]. The spatial sector of this model has a positive
curvature, k = +1. Note that in this case, the rhs of Eq.(15.36a) vanishes when the
density, Ω0/a3, and the curvature, (1 −Ω0)/a2, terms are equal. This happens for
a speciﬁc value of the scale-factor amax = Ω0/(Ω0 −1) that deﬁnes the epoch tmax
when ˙a(tmax) = 0. After deﬁning two new variables, ξ = a/amax and τ = H0t(Ω0 −

This solution [see Figure 15.2], highlights the dynamical behavior of the scale-factor,
unlike what happens in the Einstein static model [1] [see Exercise A.47]. The metric
shows a singularity at t = 0, when ξ = 0. Afterwards, there is a decelerate expansion
phase that ends when ξ = 1 or a = amax. Since amax > 1, this expansion phase will
end in the future. At the present, η0 = 2sin−1 p

THE OPEN FRIEDMANN UNIVERSE
In 1924, Friedmann discussed an open, low-density universe with a vanishing Cos-
mological Constant: Ω0 < 1 and Ωk = 1 −Ω0 [36]. For this model, the rhs of
Eq.(15.36a) is positive deﬁned. However, the relative importance of the density,
Ω0/a(t)3, and curvature, Ωk/a(t)2, terms changes with time. There is an epoch
when these two terms are equal. This happens for a speciﬁc value of the re-
duced scale-factor ac ≡Ω0/(1−Ω0). Let’s deﬁne two new variables: ξ = a/ac and
τ = H0t(1−Ω0)3/2/Ω0. Then, Eq.(15.36a) becomes

dτ =

After posing ξ ≡sinh2(η/2), we get a hyperbolic solution
ξ = 1
2 (coshη −1);
τ = 1
2 (sinhη −η)
(15.44)
As for the closed Friedmann model, the metric shows a singularity at t = 0, when
ξ = 0. Then, there is a decelerate expansion phase that ends when ξ ≃1—that is,
when a(t) = ac. For η ≫1, ξ = τ—that is, a(t) = H0Ω1/2

diluted that the curvature term dominates, providing a constant expansion velocity
[see Figure 15.2 and Exercise A.49].

THE EINSTEIN-DE SITTER UNIVERSE
Consider now the case of a ﬂat universe, Ωk = 0, with a present matter density equal
to the critical one, Ω0 = 1, and a vanishing Cosmological Constant, ΩΛ = 0. The
dynamical behavior of this model was discussed in 1932 by Einstein and de Sitter
[26]. For such a model, Eq.(15.36a) reduces to ( ˙a/a)2 = H2

The rhs of Eq.(15.48) is positive deﬁned. However, the relative weight of the den-
sity, Ω0/a3, and Cosmological Constant, ΩΛ = 1−Ω0, terms varies with time. They
become equal when the scale-factor is equal to aΛ = (Ω0/ΩΛ)1/3. So, let’s introduce

The history of the H0 determination largely coincides with the history of cosmology.
The precision on the H0 measurements continuously improved over the years [see,

e.g., [31]]. This was/is due from one hand to an increasingly competitive technology
and, on the other hand, to an increasingly in-depth knowledge of possible systematic
errors.
We report recent H0 determinations in Figure 15.4. We are still far from a “con-
cordance” value, and there could be a tension between values derived by different
groups with different experimental methods and techniques. However, for the goal
of this book, we think it is sufﬁcient to take “blindly” the best ﬁt to the data points in
Figure 15.4: H0 = (68.5±3.3)kms−1/Mpc. With this value of H0, we can evaluate
the age of different cosmological models.
The universe has to be older than their constituents, for example, old globular clus-
ters. The age of these systems is well determined and constitutes a clear benchmark.
Observations of Galactic globular cluster result in a lower limit on the age of the
universe of 11.2 billion years (at the 95% c.l.) and in a best ﬁt value of 13.5Gyr [54].
So, let’s consider the predicted age of the universe in the Ω0 −ΩΛ parameter space.
This is done in Figure 15.5 where we ﬁx the reduced Hubble constant to h = 0.68.
Note that, for ΩΛ = 0, a lower limit of 11.2Gyr to the age of the universe implies an
upper limit to the density parameter of an open universe: Ω0 ≲0.3. Increasing ΩΛ at
ﬁxed Ω0 = 0.3 increases the age of the universe quite considerably. Note that for a
ﬂat model with Ω0 = 0.3 and ΩΛ = 0.7 (and a reduced Hubble constant h = 0.68),
the universe has an age t0 ≃13.5Gyr [c.f. Eq.(15.51)].
15.14
THE COSMOLOGICAL REDSHIFT
The ﬁeld equations of General Relativity call for an expanding universe. It is then
important to be able to evaluate/constrain abstract quantities as curvature and scale-
factor with some observables. To do this, it is convenient to rewrite the FLRW metric

The proper distances along the radial and transverse directions write

dℓ⊥= a(t)×L⊥dθ.

Note that, for the sake of simplicity, the transverse length is measured along a
meridian—that is, at φ = const. Note also that in the comoving frame, cosmic ob-
servers are at rest, whereas their proper distances change with time because of the
cosmic expansion.
Consider a cosmic observer that sends us a light signal of frequency νem in the
interval ∆tem. We observe the signal with a frequency νobs in the interval ∆tobs. The
ﬁrst wavefront, emitted at tem, is observed at tobs, whereas the last one (emitted at
tem +∆tem) is observed at tobs +∆tobs. The condition ds = 0 [c.f. Eq.(15.30)] yields

since a ≃const in both the time intervals ∆tem and ∆tobs, and a(tobs) = 1. The last
equality implies that the proper wavelength of the light is stretched because of the
cosmic expansion, as all the other proper lengths [c.f. Eq.(15.54)]
λem = a(tem)λobs
(15.57)
This equation can be rewritten as follows:
1
a(t) = 1+z
(15.58)
where the cosmological redshift, z, is deﬁned as the fractional variation in wave-
length experienced by the radiation during its travel from a source up to us: z =
(λobs −λem)/λem. This allows us to connect the abstract concept of a reduced scale-
factor at a given time, a(t), with the observed cosmological redshift of the light
emitted at that time.
15.15
COMOVING DISTANCES
Observing far in space implies looking back in time: the light we receive today, here
and now, was emitted there and then, at time t and redshift z. Light moves along null
geodesics. So, Eq.(15.52) with the condition ds = 0 provides

where the last equality comes ﬁrst from changing integration variable (dt = da/ ˙a)
and then from using Eq.(15.36a). Because of Eq.(15.58), we can associate a speciﬁc
line-of-sight comoving distance L∥(z) to a source observed at redshift z. The actual
value of L∥(z) will obviously depend on the model, since the reduced scale-factor
does. Let’s see few examples.

performed by deﬁning ξ = sin2(η/2) (for Ωk < 0) or ξ = sinh2(η/2) (for Ωk > 0).

L⊥= R0Σ(χ);
(15.65)
Let’s now consider a ruler disposed perpendicular w.r.t. the line of sight at a given
line-of-sight comoving distance, L∥(z). We can now extend the consideration given
in Section 10.5 to the case of a FLRW metric. So, let’s deﬁne the proper angular
diameter distance as DA(z) = ℓ⊥/θ, were θ is the angle subtended by the ruler and
ℓ⊥= L⊥θ/(1+z) is its proper length. Given Eq.(15.65), we can ﬁnally write
DA(z) = R0Σ[χ(z)]
1+z
(15.66)
where χ (z) = L∥(z)/R0 [c.f. Eq.(15.65)]. We can now derive explicit analytical ex-
pressions for DA(z) in a number of cosmological models.

Theoretical Cosmology
223
Consider ﬁrst a closed Friedmann universe with Ω0 > 1, Ωk = Ω0 −1 and
ΩΛ = 0. Let’s use again the deﬁnitions given in Section 15.9: sin2 η/2 = a/amax
and sin2(η0/2) = 1/amax = (Ω0 −1)/Ω0. We can then write
1+z = sin2(η0/2)
sin2(η/2)
(15.67)
Then, (1−cosη)(1+z) = 1−cosη0—that is, cosη = z+cosη0/(1+z). It follows
that [see Exercise A.51]
sinη =

(15.68)
Along the light cone, χ = η0 −η with dη = cdt/R(t) [see Exercises A.52 and
A.53], implying sinχ = sin(η0 −η). Thus, by using Eq.(15.66), we can ﬁnally ob-
tain the wanted expression for the angular diameter distance [see Exercise A.54].
Interestingly enough we get the same expression also for an open Friedmann model

Eq.(15.70) when Ω0 →1. Finally, for the ﬂat, Λ-dominated universe, we still have
Σ(χ) = χ and
DA(z) = L(concordance)

(15.71)
However, we have to face again a numerical integration to ﬁnd L∥[c.f. Eq.(15.63].
The angular diameter distance is plotted in Figure 15.6. Note that, for redshift
z ≲2, the DA values of the concordance model are larger than those predicted by an
open model (with the same Ω0) and by the Einstein-de Sitter model.

THE PROPER LUMINOSITY DISTANCE
Let’s consider a source of intrinsic (bolometric) luminosity L at a given comoving
distance, L∥(z) = R0χ(z). For convenience, imagine the source at the center of a
comoving shell with us on the border. The energy ﬂux is given by the inverse square

0Σ(χ)2 is the surface of the comoving shell. Note,
however, that this simple relation neglects two important cosmological effects. First,
in an expanding universe, light is redshifted. Thus, the energy emitted by a source at
redshift z is degraded by a factor 1+z. Secondly, both luminosity and ﬂux are given
per unit time. The rates of emission and observation of photons result to be different.
In fact, the number of photons, Nγ, received by the observer per unit time decreases,
again by a factor 1 + z, w.r.t. the number of photons emitted per unit of time [c.f.

Thus, the relation between observed energy ﬂux and intrinsic luminosity must be

In analogy with the classical case, the proper luminosity distance DL is deﬁned as
the proper radial distance at which a source of given intrinsic luminosity and given

Angular and luminosity distances are not independent [c.f. Eq.(15.66) and
Eq.(15.75)]. Indeed,
DL = DA ×(1+z)2

So, we can immediately write the luminosity distance for cosmological models with

This is the well-known Hubble law, relating the cosmological redshift of a source
with its (luminosity) distance. Note also that because of Eq.(15.77), at variance with
DA, DL doesn’t have a maximum and it grows asymptotically as 2cz/(H0Ω0). For ﬂat
cosmologies with ΩΛ = 1−Ω0, the luminosity distance is given by DL = L∥(1+z),
where L∥has to be numerically evaluated through Eq.(15.63). In Figure 15.7 we
show the proper luminosity distance predicted by different cosmological models.

SNe La AND DARK ENERGY
Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) have proved to be reliable “standardizable” candles,
providing quite a power tool for constraining cosmological parameters. A break-
through result was indeed obtained by two different collaborations: the more distant

226
An Overview of General Relativity and Space-Time
SNe Ia are dimmer (and therefore further away) than expected in a matter-dominated
universe with a vanishing Cosmological Constant [66, 76]. This was the ﬁrst obser-
vational evidence in favor of a universe characterized by a late accelerated expansion
driven by dark energy, able to make DL larger than, e.g., in an Einstein- de Sitter
universe [c.f. Figure 15.7]. Although different theoretical scenarios have been pro-
posed to explain this dark component, it must be stressed that the simplest case of a
positive Cosmological Constant ﬁts remarkably well the high-redshift SNe Ia data.
The standard relation between the apparent and absolute magnitudes for a single
SN Ia in the B-band writes
m(z) = MB +5log10 DL(Mpc)+25
(15.79)
Here DL(Mpc) is the proper luminosity distance in Mpc. Since DL(Mpc) is propor-
tional to the Hubble radius dH = c/H0, it is convenient to deﬁne a Hubble constant-
free luminosity distance dL ≡DL/dH. Then, Eq.(15.79) becomes
mB −MB = 5log10 dL(Ω0,ΩΛ)
(15.80)
where MB = MB + 5log10 dH + 25. The dependence of dL on Ωk is not shown ex-
plicitly, as the latter is constrained by Eq. (15.34).
Consider the simple case of the two supernovae: one at low (z1) and the other at
high (z2) redshift. Note that limz→0 dL ≃z [c.f. Eq.(15.78)]. It follows that
d(2)
L
= z110(m2−m1)/5
(15.81)
So, given the apparent magnitude of the two supernovae (m2 and m1) one can ob-
servationally evaluate dL(z2) and compare it with the values predicted by different
cosmological models. Note that this result is “Hubble constant-free” [see Exercise
A.56].
In the real case, the quantity MB in Eq.(15.80) can be ﬁtted to the SNe Ia data
together with the cosmological parameter Ω0 and ΩΛ. After marginalizing over MB,
it is possible to deﬁne conﬁdence level regions in the Ω0 −ΩΛ plane. The best ﬁt
values indicate a low density (Ω0 = 0.3), ﬂat (Ωk = 0) universe with a positive Cos-
mological Constant, ΩΛ = 0.7 [66, 76]. Being ΩΛ = Λc2/(3H2
0) [c.f. Eq.(15.33)],
it is straightforward to verify that for H0 = 68kms−1/Mpc the wanted value of the
Cosmological Constant is Λ ≃1.2×10−56cm−2. This is the so-called Concordance
Model that also emerges from CMB anisotropy observations [see, e.g., [70]].

16 The Hot Big-Bang
16.1
INTRODUCTION
The dust-ﬁlled cosmological models discussed in the previous chapter are mathemat-
ical solutions of the ﬁeld equations of General Relativity that successfully confront
with the observations of the late time universe. This can be deﬁnitely considered
as a further test of General Relativity on cosmological scales. However, we have to
understand how much we can trust and, possibly, test the theoretical predictions of
these models at early times. The goal of this chapter is to discuss the experimental
evidence that supports the General Relativity predictions of the early universe.
16.2
THE CMB
The discovery of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) [65] constitutes a mile-
stone in the study of the early universe. The CMB appeared soon to be a diffuse,
highly isotropic radiation ﬁeld. This corroborated the hypothesis of its cosmologi-
cal origin [16]. However, more than isotropy, the key clue for the study of the early
universe is the Planckian nature of the CMB. Its spectral properties were progres-
sively tested over the years, and ﬁnally measured with an outstanding precision by
the experiment FIRAS on board of the satellite COBE. The COBE/FIRAS exper-
iment proved the CMB to be a blackbody of temperature T0 = (2.726 ± 0.010) K,
with deviations lower than 0.03% of the peak brightness over a wavelength range
that goes from 0.5 to 5 mm [58,59].
The energy density of an isotropic radiation ﬁeld goes as ε ∝a−4 if the cosmic
expansion is adiabatic [c.f. Eq.(15.28) with p = ε/3]. This must be the case to pre-
serve the universe homogeneity and isotropy [see Section 15.6]. It follows that the
entropy of an isotropic, blackbody radiation ﬁeld is conserved
S = 4
3A VT 3 ∝a3(t)T 3(t)
(16.1)
where A = π2k4/[15(¯hc)3] is the radiation density constant. All this leads to con-
clude that the CMB temperature varies with time
T(t) = T0
a(t) = T0(1+z)
(16.2)
Thus, the more we go back in time, the higher is the CMB temperature. It is worth
noting that the predictions of Eq.(16.2) have been tested observationally, although
only “locally”—that is, for redshifts z ≈1. The CMB excites the rotational lines
of carbon monoxide molecule. Thus, by studying the CO absorption lines in quasar
spectra we can constrain T(z) up to z ∼3. Indeed, it is found that T(z) = (2.725 ±

[61].
To underline why the Planckian nature of the CMB is so important, let’s look to
its brightness


(16.3)
Here the pre-factor, ∝a−3(t), indicates that the CMB brightness increases going back
on time. In addition to this, note that the quantity x = 2π¯hν/kT is time-independent:
because of the cosmic expansion, both ν(t) and T(t) vary with time as a−1(t). It fol-
lows that the Planckian shape of the CMB spectrum—deﬁned by the square paren-
thesis in Eq.(16.3)—is preserved during the cosmic expansion. In other words, the
spectral properties of the CMB witness the period in the early universe when matter
and radiation were in thermal contact, even if today they are clearly decoupled. This
is a distinctive feature of the cosmological models expanding from a singularity, and
this is why one can refer to the class of Friedmann models as to the hot Big-Bang
models.
16.3
A RADIATION-DOMINATED UNIVERSE
A diffuse background of relativistic particles must have an impact on the cosmic ex-
pansion. We can still use Eq.(15.23), but we have now to interpret the mass density as
the sum of the relativistic and non-relativistic components: ρ(t) = ρER(t)+ρNR(t),
where ρER(t) = ρER(t0)/a4 and ρNR(t) = ρNR(t0)/a3. Following what was done in
Section 15.7, we can then write Eq.(15.36a) as follows:
H2(t)

a4 + Ω0
a3 + Ωk


(16.4)
where ΩER ≡ρER(t0)/ρcrit and Ω0 = ρNR(t0)/ρcrit are the density parameters of the
relativistic and non-relativistic components, respectively. These two components are
equally contributing to the cosmic expansion rate at the so-called equivalence epoch
[see Exercise A.57]

(16.5)
For a ≳aeq the universe is matter-dominated, the relativistic component is not dy-
namically important, and in this regime all the considerations done in Chapter 15
remain valid. For a ≲aeq the reverse is true: the universe is radiation-dominated, the
rhs of Eq.(16.4) is dominated by the ﬁrst, relativistic term and the non-relativistic
component can be ignored together with the curvature and the Cosmological Con-
stant terms. In this regime, Eq.(16.4) simpliﬁes in

ER H0 ×t1/2 [see Exercise A.58]. This allows to derive a very
useful time-energy relation. In fact, remembering the deﬁnition of ΩER, we can write
t =

3c2
32πGεER (t)
(16.7)
where εER(t) ≡ρER(t)c2 is the total energy density due to all the relativistic compo-
nents.
Let’s restrict our discussion to the energy range between 1 and 100MeV. In this
phase, relativistic particles such as photons, electrons and positrons, neutrinos and
antineutrinos all contribute to εER. There are of course also non-relativistic particles
such as neutron and protons, but they do not contribute to the expansion rate of a
radiation-dominated universe. In this energy range, relativistic particles are kept in
equilibrium by weak
n+e+ ⇐⇒p+ ¯νe;
n+νe ⇐⇒p+e−;
n ⇐⇒p+e−+ ¯νe
(16.8)
and electromagnetic e+ + e−⇐⇒γγ interactions. So, for 1 ≲E(MeV) ≲100, we
can write εER = g∗(π2/30)k4T 4/(¯h3c3). The effective statistical weight is deﬁned as
follows:

where the gi is the statistical weight of the i−th component: gγ = 2, ge−= 2, ge+ = 2,
gν = 2 for photons, electrons, positrons, neutrino, and antineutrino, respectively. In
Eq.(16.9) Ne f f is the effective number of neutrino families, taken to be equal to
three [91]. The contributions of fermions and bosons to the total energy density are
different because of the different statistics they obey to. In the range 1 ≲E(MeV) ≲
100, Eq.(16.7) provides
t =
0.74s
T 2(MeV)
(16.10)
Clearly, this relation is valid for a radiation-dominated universe and for a very spe-
ciﬁc energy interval, 1 ≲E(MeV) ≲100.
16.4
THE NEUTRON-TO-BARYON RATIO
In the energy range between 1 and 100MeV, neutron and protons are not relativistic,
their mass being ≈1GeV. However, they continuously transform the ones in the
others due to the weak reactions of Eq.(16.8). In equilibrium conditions, the neutron-
to-baryon ratio would be given by the Boltzmann factor n(0)
n /n(0)
p
= e−∆m/T where
∆m = mn −mp = 1.293MeV is the difference between the neutron and the proton
masses. It would then seem that the neutron-to-proton ratio decreases exponentially.

230
An Overview of General Relativity and Space-Time
If this were the case, today we shouldn’t expect any survived neutron to be around.
The point is that, in general, the reactions given in Eq.(16.8) can occur also in non-
equilibrium conditions. In this case, there are two competing rates to be taken into
account. From one hand, we have the total neutron-to-proton conversion rate that
takes into account all the three reactions of Eq.(16.8). For the temperature of interest
here, there is a good ﬁt to this rate [17,47,96]: λn→p(x) ≃255

12+6x+x2
/(τnx5),
where x ≡∆m/T and τn = (885.7±0.8)s is free-neutron decay time scale [100]. The
other competing effect is provided by the cosmic expansion rate, H(x) = 1.13s−1/x2
[see Exercise A.59].
These two rates, λn→p and H, are equal for x = 1.9, which corresponds to T ≃
0.7MeV. It follows that for T ≳0.7MeV, λn→p(x) > H(x), the neutron-to-proton
conversion is quite efﬁcient, and it occurs on time scales much shorter than those of
the cosmic expansion. For T ≲0.7MeV, λn→p(x) < H(x), the conversion becomes
less and less effective and the neutron-to-baryon ratio progressively freezes out to
the value
Xn = 0.15
(16.11)
where Xn = nn/(nn +np) is the neutron-to-baryon ratio.
16.5
A ν’S COSMIC BACKGROUND
After the freezing out of the weak interactions, neutrinos decoupled from the rest of
the other cosmological constituents. We are then left with a homogeneous Cosmic
Neutrinos Background-CνB, homogeneously distributed over the space, with an en-
ergy density εν = gν/(2π2)(kTν)4 (¯hc)−3 7π4/120. The CνB temperature decreases
as a−1, because of the adiabatic nature of the cosmic expansion. Before decoupling
(T ≳0.7MeV), neutrinos share the same temperature with all the other relativistic
particles. However, at T ≲0.5MeV this is not true anymore. In fact, at that tem-
perature, electrons and positrons annihilate. Being already decoupled, neutrinos are
basically unaffected by this process that instead produces a heating of the photon
gas. Let’s evaluate the relevance of such a process. Note that before the freezing
of the weak reactions photons, electrons, positrons, and Nef f families of neutrinos
contribute to the entropy of the relativistic gas

temperatures are different. Since the cosmic expansion is adiabatic, entropy is con-

again the adiabatic nature of the cosmic expansion, we can also conclude that

PRIMORDIAL NUCLEOSYNTHESIS
For an appropriate energy range, we do expect that the synthesis of light nuclei could
occur in the early universe The neutron-to-proton ratio is the key ingredient to pro-
vide reliable predictions. Let’s stress that the value Xn given at the end of Section
16.4 [c.f. Eq.(16.11)] doesn’t take into account two important and competing phys-
ical processes. From one hand, free-neutrons decay on a time scale τn in protons,
electrons, and electron anti-neutrinos [see Eq.(16.8)]. On the other hand, the syn-
thesis of light elements stabilizes neutrons in atomic nuclei. To evaluate the relative
importance of these two processes, we must ﬁrst know when primordial nucleosyn-
thesis actually starts. Deuterium (D) is clearly the ﬁrst isotope to be synthesized via
the reaction
p+n ⇐⇒D+γ
(16.18)
The binding energy of D nucleus is BD ≡mn + mp −mD = 2.22MeV. For temper-
atures higher than this, Deuterons can form at high rate, but they are immediately

232
An Overview of General Relativity and Space-Time
photo-dissociated by the high energy CMB photons. This is an important point. How
many CMB photons do we have in the universe? To answer to this question, let’s
evaluate their number density nγ(t) = 2ζ(3)[kT(t)]3 [¯hc]−3 /π2, where ζ is the Rie-
mann function. At the present T(t0) = 2.726K and, then, nγ(t0) ≃410cm−3. Note
that today the baryonic number density is much lower: nb(t0) ≃1.1·10−5Ωbh2 cm−3,
Ωb = ρb0/ρcrit being the baryonic density parameter [c.f. Eq.(15.35)]. As a result, the
baryon-to-photon ratio, which is constant in time, results to be
ηb ≡nb
nγ
= 6×10−10
 Ωbh2

(16.19)
Because of their large abundance, the number of CMB photons with an energy ≳BD
equals the number of baryons only when the universe cooled down to a temperature
of 82keV, almost a factor 3 smaller than BD [94]. It follows that the reaction n+ p ⇒
D+γ becomes effective in forming Deuterons only when T ≲82keV [see Exercise
A.60]. This occurs when the universe had an age of [c.f. Eq.(16.17)]
tnuc = 5.3s

0.082MeV
2
≃196s
(16.20)
So, at the onset of the primordial nucleosynthesis—roughly 3′ after the Big-Bang–
free-neutron decay lowered the abundance of free-neutrons by a factor e−tnuc/τn ≃
0.80 Thus, a more reliableat estimate of the neutron-to-baryon ratio is given by
Xn(Tnuc) ≈0.123
(16.21)
16.7
PRIMORDIAL ABUNDANCE OF LIGHT NUCLEI
Once Deuterons formed at T ∼82keV, other light nuclei—such as 3H, 3He, 4He, 7Li,
and 7Be—can be synthesized on a very short time scale, accordingly to the scheme
shown in Figure 16.6.
It is worth remembering two facts: i) the 4He nuclei have the largest binding
energy among the light elements; ii) there are not tightly bound isotopes with mass
number between 5 and 8. Hence, starting with neutrons and protons, it is impossible
to build elements heavier than 4He. This occurs in stars, via the triple-α reaction
4He+4 He+4 He →12 C. However, this reaction requires high temperatures and high
densities. It is interesting to note that the last condition is not satisﬁed at the onset
of primordial nucleosynthesis. Indeed, at T ≃82keV ≃109K the baryonic density
is ρb(tnuc) ≃10−3Ωbh2gcm−3, lower by at least three order of magnitudes w.r.t. the
water density.
On the basis of this consideration, it is not unreasonable to assume that, to zeroth
order, all neutrons are captured in 4He nuclei. Under this hypothesis, the neutron
abundance is simply twice the abundance of 4He nuclei: nn = 2n4He. By convention,

Yp ≡

nn +np

(16.22)
For Xn = 0.123 [c.f. Eq.(16.21)], we can predict that Yp ≃0.246. This is consistent
with the conservative upper limit Yp ⩽0.251±0.002 [38].
If all available neutrons end up in 4He nuclei, we don’t expect any surviving
Deuterons from the early universe. This is clearly an oversimpliﬁcation. In fact,
proper and detailed calculations of primordial nucleosynthesis show that Deuteron
abundance ﬁrst decreases and then freezes out to a non-vanishing value [38]. Interest-
ingly enough, the surviving Deuterium abundance—measured in terms of Deuteron-
to-proton ratio, D/H—is very sensitive to the baryon abundance or, equivalently,
to the baryon-to-photon ratio, ηb. This is not unexpected: the higher the value of
ηb, the more efﬁcient the burning of D in heavier nuclei and, then, the lower its
residual abundance. An accurate numerical ﬁt for 5.7 × 10−10 ≲ηb ≲6.7 × 10−10

with a quite steep dependence on ηb. This allows the D/H abundance to be a very
effective “baryometer”: indeed, any measure of the primordial D/H ratio constrains
ηb and, then, Ωbh2 [c.f. Eq.(16.19)]. Clearly, the residual fraction of primordial Deu-
terium will be destroyed by the nuclear reactions occurring in stars. Therefore, any

measure of the D/H ratio represents only a lower limit to the primordial Deuterium
abundance. However, observations of either low-metallicity or high redshift systems
could provide reasonable estimates of the primordial D/H ratio. A conservative mea-
sure of the D/H ratio is provided by [38]:

This value is consistent with ηb ≃6 × 10−10 and, then, with Ωbh2 ≃0.022 [c.f.
Eq(16.19), Eq.(16.23), and Eq.(16.24)]. It is very important to stress that this re-
sult is fully consistent with the results obtained by the Planck collaboration: ηb =
(6.01±0.06)×10−10, corresponding to Ωbh2 = 0.02205±0.00028 [69].
Let’s conclude this Section by reminding that the SNe Ia data constrain the non-
relativistic content of the universe to have a density parameter Ω0 ≃0.3. For h =
0.68, the primordial D/H ratio constrains the baryonic component to be Ωb ≃0.04.
This is one of the strongest arguments for requiring that, beside baryons, a non-
relativistic dark matter component actually contribute to the non-relativistic mass
density of the universe. What is dark matter is an open question, a forefront research
in astrophysics and particle physics.
16.8
THE RECOMBINATION OF THE PRIMORDIAL PLASMA
After primordial nucleosynthesis ended, baryons and photons remain thermally cou-
pled together via Compton and Coulomb scattering processes. Both these physical
mechanisms act over a quite large period of time, from about 200s up to roughly
400,000y after the Big-Bang. During this period, there is a sufﬁciently large num-
ber of photons with energies larger than the binding energy of hydrogen atoms,
BH = 13.6eV. As for the Deuterium bottle-neck, we have to wait for the universe
to cool until the number of photons with energy 2π¯hν > BH is equal to the number
of protons. When this happens, there is the transition from the primordial plasma
phase to a neutral one, which leads to the formation of hydrogen
p+e−⇒H +γ
(16.25)
This process is referred to as the recombination of the primordial plasma. Helium
atoms formed earlier and, for sake of simplicity, we neglect their contribution to the
overall recombination process.
Let’s deﬁne the free-electron fraction as the fractional abundance of the free elec-
trons w.r.t. electrons and hydrogen atoms:
Xe ≡
ne
ne +nH
=
np
np +nH
(16.26)
the last equality following from the requirement that the universe has not a net elec-
tric charge. To zeroth order, we could study how Xe(t) changes with time by using
the Saha approximation. However, there are two reasons for the Saha solution not to

The Hot Big-Bang
235
work properly. First, the Saha equation assumes direct ground state recombination.
Secondly, the 13.6eV photon released during an hydrogen atom formation immedi-
ately reionize another hydrogen atom already formed. Therefore, recombination to
the ground state is ineffective. Thirdly, and more important, when Xe decreases, the
rate of hydrogen formation drops and the reaction of Eq.(16.25) progressively gets
out of equilibrium. Then, we have to be back to proper, non-equilibrium calculations.
The most important outcome of these calculations is to identify which redshift
layer(s) is (are) directly observable via the CMB. In order to answer this question,
let’s ﬁrst evaluate the optical depth for Thomson scattering

imation for the period of interest. In terms of redshift,

Given the optical depth, we can evaluate the probability density for a CMB photon
to be last-scattered by a free electron. This is given by the visibility function
g(z) = e−τ(z) dτ
dz
(16.29)
Proper calculations show that the visibility function has a peak at z = 1064, weakly
dependent on the considered cosmological model [13, 50]. It is then common to
talk about the last scattering surface, as the surface where most of the CMB pho-
tons experience their last scatter [see Figure 16.2]. It must be noted, however,
that the visibility function has a non-negligible width around its maximum and it
is quit skew. The half width half maximum (HWHM) of the visibility function
for the concordance model is about 110, corresponding to a Gaussian dispersion
σ = HWHM/(
√
2ln2) ≈80. This means that the last scattering surface samples a
redshift shell centered on 1+zrec ≃1064 (corresponding to arec ≈10−3) with a width
∆z ≈80 [see Exercise A.61].
To conclude, the importance of the recombination process stands on the fact that
all free electrons disappear to form neutral hydrogen atoms. It follows that photons
can’t Compton scatter against free-electrons, as it happened before recombination in
the so-called plasma phase. This exactly why photons can free-stream from the last
scattering surface up to now, bringing with them a wealth of information about the
universe at roughly 400,000yr after the Big-Bang.
16.9
THE PUZZLES OF THE STANDARD MODEL
The Friedmann models are nowadays supported by quite a number of independent
observations. The universe is, on the average, very homogeneous and isotropic, and

observer and from which the CMB photons can free-stream freely toward the observer, here
and now, see text.
it expands at a rate which has only recently become constant. However, beyond all
its successes, the hot Big Bang model leaves a number of open questions, such as the
nature of dark matter and dark energy, and, at an even more basic level, a couple of
very known “puzzles”.
Let’s start from the so-called horizon problem. On the last scattering surface,
an angle θ subtends a comoving length ℓ(c)
⊥= ℓ⊥(1 + z). The high redshift limit
of Eq.(15.69), written for a vanishing Cosmological Constant, provides DA =
(2c/H0)Ω−1(1+z)−1. Then, limz→∞θ = Ω0ℓ(c)
⊥/(2c/H0). After substituting the nu-
merical values, we can write
θ(deg) ≃Ω0

(16.30)
It follows that in an Einstein- de Sitter universe ≈1◦subtends on the last scattering
surface a comoving scale of ≈100h−1Mpc. On the other hand, the comoving size of
the region casually connected at the epoch of last scattering is instead given by

H (arec) ≃
210Ω−0.28
0
Mpc. Then, the angle subtended by the causally connected region on the
last scattering surface is [c.f. Eq.(16.30)]
θH ≈1.5Ω0.72
0
deg
(16.33)
So, if we observe the CMB sky in two different directions, more than ≈1.5Ω0.72
0
deg
apart, we probe regions that were not in causal contact at the last scattering epoch.
On the other hand, the CMB is observed to have the same intensity all over the
sky, by one part over 105. So, how did two unconnected regions manage to reach
the same physical properties? This seems to be an obvious paradox, the so-called
horizon problem.
The other puzzle is known as the curvature problem. We can obviously use the
deﬁnition given in Eq.(15.33) at an arbitrary time. Then, in terms of the today curva-
ture parameter we can write
Ωk(t) ≡−
kc2
H2(t)R2(t) ≃Ωk(t0) a2
ΩER
(16.34)
where in the Friedmann equation we consider only the contribution of the relativistic
backgrounds [c.f. Eq.(16.4)]. Note that the sign of the curvature is conserved, as we
should have expected from the derivation of the Friedmann metric [c.f. Eq.(15.14)]: if
the universe is ﬂat, it is ﬂat forever. If k ̸= 0, the magnitude of the curvature parameter
tends to zero as a(t) →0, irrespectively of the value of Ωk(t0) at the present time. So,
having in the very early universe Ωk(t) = ε (with ε arbitrarily small) produces either
a universe which expands forever (ε > 0) or a universe which recollapses on itself
(ε < 0). In other words, we need to ﬁne tune the initial conditions to an incredible
precision to obtain today something that resembles the universe we observe. This is
the so-called curvature problem.
16.10
AN EARLY ACCELERATED PHASE?
Both the horizon and the curvature problems arise because of an implicit assumption.
By neglecting the contribution of the Cosmological Constant term at early times, we
forced the universe to expand in a decelerated way. Indeed, if Λ = 0, Eq.(15.26)
provides
1
H2
0
¨a
a ≃−ΩER
a4 −1

Ω0

(16.35)
Let’s instead assume that in the very early phases the cosmic expansion was accel-
erated, rather than decelerated. Let’s also assume that this accelerated phase started
when a(ti) = ai and ended when a(t f ) = a f . Consider, for sake of simplicity, a sim-
ple exponential accelerated expansion `a la de Sitter [c.f. Section 15.8]. In this case

238
An Overview of General Relativity and Space-Time
H = const and, at the end of the exponential expansion, the size of the comoving
horizon writes
L(c)
H (af ) = c
H

−1
af
+ 1
ai

(16.36)
Now, let’s assume that this primordial accelerated expansion started very early, and
it ends when a f ≫ai. Then, for ai →0, all the presently observable Universe was
once in causal contact, and there is no need of invoking ad hoc initial conditions.
Under the same assumption of an early accelerated expansion phase, also the
curvature problem disappears. The de Sitter model provides a constant expansion
rate, H = H(tin) = H(tf ), and a scale factor R(t) = R(tin)exp[H(t −tin)]. Under
this conditions, we can write Eq.(16.34) as follows:
Ωk(t) ≡Ωk(tin)exp[−2H(t −tin)]
(16.37)
Thus, we get exactly the opposite behavior of Eq.(16.34): Ωk(t) is now decreasing
with increasing time. If this exponential expansion is lasting long enough, we get
limt→t f ≫tin Ωk(t) = 0, from “above” (“below”) for Ωk(tin) > 0 (Ωk(tin) < 0), inde-
pendently on the actual value of Ωk(tin). So, it is possible to have a smooth transition
between the early, accelerated phase, and the standard Friedman decelerated expan-
sion without any ﬁne-tuning of the initial conditions.
16.11
COSMIC INFLATION
Let’s assume that the early universe evolution has been driven, for a period of time,
by a scalar ﬁeld φ. Field equations and equations of motion can be written consider-
ing the Einstein-Hilbert action plus the scalar ﬁeld contribution: S = SEH + Sφ [c.f.
Sections 8.6 and 8.7].
For sake of simplicity, consider the case of a constant scalar ﬁeld, φ0 say, which
corresponds to a minimum of the potential: V ′(φ)|φ0 = 0. In this case V(φ0) =
Λc4/(8πG) [c.f. Eq.(8.48)] So, we recover an exponential accelerated expansion `a
la de Sitter. However, we also need an exponential expansion lasting long enough to
ensure that a(t f ) ≫a(tin). Let’s then measure the duration and the effectiveness of
such primordial exponential expansion in terms of the number of e-foldings
eN ≡a(tf )
a(tin)
(16.38)
Note that this deﬁnition is quite general. For the de Sitter solution, N = H(t f −ti).
For other models, as the Friedmann models, N =
 t f
ti H(t)dt.
To estimate how long the inﬂationary phase should last to be effective, let’s con-
sider again the curvature problem. To resolve it, we want the present value of the
curvature parameter much less than the corresponding value at the onset of inﬂation
[see Exercise A.62]:
Ωk(t0)
Ωk(tin) ≡H2(tin)R2(tin)
H2(t0)R2(t0) = e−2NΩ0

The Hot Big-Bang
239
Neglecting Ω0 ≈1, this provides
N ≫ln Tf
Teq
+ 1
2 ln Teq
T0
(16.40)
Now, considering Tf ≃1016GeV, Teq ≃1eV and T0 ≃10−4eV one gets
N ≫60
(16.41)
So, 60 is, so to speak, the minimum number of e-foldings necessary for resolving
the standard problems of the Big-Bang. It is interesting to note that this implies an
incredibly huge ampliﬁcation of the scale factor, in a very tiny time interval
∆t ≳

Many models have been considered for explaining such an early accelerated expan-
sion phase [9]. Inﬂation is nowadays a paradigm of modern cosmology. However,
there is a way to test observationally this paradigm. Indeed, the discovery of B-modes
in the CMB polarization pattern would reveal the existence of a primordial, stochastic
background of gravitational waves. These are expected to be generataed by tensorial
ﬂuctuations of the FLRW space-time. LiteBIRD is a satellite designed to hunt for
this elusive signal, and it is expected to ﬂy at the end of this decade [56].
