Introduction
More than ever, tens of millions of people rely on iOS to perform many of their daily tasks. 
These include not only typical mobile phone tasks such as calling and texting, but also 
smartphone/tablet tasks such as surfing the Web, sending and receiving email, taking 
photos and videos, getting directions, scheduling appointments, and using apps. Our iOS 
devices also contain crucial information that we need to access regularly, including our 
contacts, bookmarks, notes, and calendars. Increasingly, each of us sees our device as an 
extension of our self, making this the most crucial tool in our day-to-day lives and, so, the 
one indispensable device.
So it is no wonder that our lives are upset, possibly even derailed temporarily, when 
our iOS device doesn’t work the way it should (or the way we think it should). If an email 
doesn’t go through, web page text is difficult to read, or an app freezes, our productivity 
(and possibly our sanity) suffers. In such situations, all we want is for things to return to 
normal so our lives can get back on track.
But how do we get our iOS device to act normally again? After all, the iPhone and the 
iPad are the devices that are supposed to “just work.” Glitches and hiccups and crashes 
just aren’t supposed to happen with iOS. Alas, they happen all too often and most of the 
time it isn’t obvious not only why the problem occurred, but what can be done to fix it 
(and prevent it from happening again in the future).
Welcome
Welcome, therefore, to Troubleshooting iOS. In this book, you learn how to prevent iOS 
problems from occurring and (just in case your preventative measures are for naught) 
how to fix many common problems yourself. It is those nonobvious fixes, workarounds, 
and preventative measures that form the core of this book. In clear, straightforward, 
easy-to-understand prose, this book takes you through dozens of iOS problems, in each 
case giving you both some background about why the problem occurred and one or more 
ways to solve the problem and get the device (and you) back in business.

﻿ ■ Introduction
xvi
Who Should Read This Book?
When an iOS problem occurs, there are a number of troubleshooting resources available. 
These include contacting Apple Support, searching Apple discussion forums, taking 
the device to the Genius Bar, or self-diagnosing the problem. You should read this 
book if you’re an iOS user who has some experience with the device, but who, due to 
a lack of time, interest, or inclination, isn’t willing or able to perform these standard 
troubleshooting steps. For people like you, this book is an efficient and handy resource 
that enables you to resolve a problem quickly and without recourse to complicated,  
time-consuming, or expensive solutions.
How This Book Is Organized
This book isn’t meant to be read from cover to cover (although, of course, you’re free to 
do so if you wish). Instead, most of the book divides iOS troubleshooting into a number 
of targeted categories, which I hope will make it easy for you to locate the particular 
problem you want to prevent, solve, or work around.
To help you find your way around, here’s a summary of the book’s dozen chapters:
• 
Chapter 1, “Learning Some General Troubleshooting 
Techniques” — This chapter takes you through a few useful 
techniques for troubleshooting most problems. If you don’t see 
a specific fix for a problem you’re having, try one or more of the 
general solutions in this chapter.
• 
Chapter 2, “Fixing Networking and Cellular Woes” — This 
chapter focuses on connectivity problems, especially those 
related to the cellular network and to Wi-Fi networks.
• 
Chapter 3, “Solving App Problems” — This chapter looks at 
troubles related to apps, such as having an app freeze on you.
• 
Chapter 4, “Resolving Web Issues” — This chapter concentrates 
on problems related to use the Safari app to surf the Web and to 
search for information.
• 
Chapter 5, “Overcoming Email Glitches” — This chapter tackles 
the Mail app and takes you through a number of problems related 
to sending and receiving email.
• 
Chapter 6, “Fixing Phone Troubles” — If you have an iPhone, 
this chapter looks at issues that might arise when receiving or 
making phone calls, as well as other problems related to the 
Phone app.
• 
Chapter 7, “Solving Problems Related to Cameras and Photos” —  
This chapter focuses (pun intended) on problems related to using 
both the Camera app to capture images, and the Photos app to 
process those images.

﻿ ■ Introduction
xvii
• 
Chapter 8, “Protecting Your Device” — This chapter shows 
you how to keep your iOS device safe by running through a few 
preventative maintenance tasks such as locking your device, 
backing up your data, and finding and protecting a lost device.
• 
Chapter 9, “Solving Privacy Problems” — This chapter takes a 
detailed look at how you can maintain privacy when you use iOS, 
including both general privacy issues and concerns related to web 
browsing privacy.
• 
Chapter 10, “Repairing Battery and Charging Problems” — 
This chapter looks at problems related to the device battery, 
including tracking battery use and extending battery life.
• 
Chapter 11, “Getting Around Accessibility Issues” — This 
chapter concentrates on configuring iOS to work around 
challenges related to visual, physical, and aural impairments or 
disabilities.
• 
Chapter 12, “Troubleshooting Other iOS Problems” — This 
chapter completes the book with a miscellany of troubleshooting 
tools, techniques, and workarounds for a variety of problems that 
didn’t fit into any of the other chapters.
Features of This Book
To help you get the most of the book and to make your troubleshooting chores more 
efficient, this book includes the following features:
• 
Throughout the book, I’ve broken many of the troubleshooting 
procedures and workarounds into easy-to-follow, step-by-step 
procedures.
• 
Jargon-free explanations of key concepts
• 
Extensive use of screenshots to illustrate many of the book’s 
procedures
• 
Tips, tricks, and shortcuts to make troubleshooting your iOS 
device easier and faster
• 
A friendly and lightly humorous tone that I hope will help you feel 
at home with the subject and keep boredom at bay

﻿ ■ Introduction
xviii
This book also uses the following boxes to draw your attention to important (or 
merely interesting) information:
■
■Note   The Note box presents asides that give you more information about the current 
troubleshooting topic. These tidbits provide extra insights that offer a better understanding 
of the task.
■
■Tip   The Tip box tells you about methods that are easier, faster, or more efficient than 
the standard methods.
■
■Caution   The all-important Caution box tells you about potential accidents waiting to 
happen. There are always ways to mess things up when you’re working with iOS. These 
boxes help you avoid those traps and pitfalls.

CHAPTER 1
Learning Some General 
Troubleshooting Techniques
When you’re using a computer — particularly a Windows PC, but also a Mac — there’s 
a weird nervousness that operates just below the surface of your awareness. That 
trepidation comes from experience: your computer almost certainly has crashed not only 
many times in the past, but also some time recently. So in a sense you’re just waiting for 
things to go south because you know they eventually will.
When you’re using your iPhone, iPad, or other iOS device, that underlying unease 
is nowhere to be found. This blissfully anxiety-free state also comes from experience: 
your iOS device almost never crashes, so you’re not expecting it to. Notice, however, that 
I said almost never. The reality is that, although they occur far less frequently than with 
Windows or macOS, iOS problems do occur. That shouldn’t come as a surprise because 
the iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch are extremely sophisticated devices — they’re full-
blown computers, really. And any sophisticated device will always have problems, thanks 
to its sheer complexity. Fortunately, iOS devices have fewer moving parts than regular 
computers, so overall there’s less to go wrong with the hardware. You also see fewer 
problems on the software side because app developers only have to build their products 
to work with a relatively small collection of devices, all of which are manufactured by a 
single company. This really simplifies things, and the result is fewer problems. Again, 
however, not zero problems.
To help you troubleshoot any hardware or software glitches that come up, this 
chapter offers you some general troubleshooting techniques that apply to all iOS devices: 
the iPhone, the iPad, and the iPod touch.
Restarting and Rebooting
If your iOS device is behaving oddly or erratically, it’s possible that a specific component 
inside the device is the cause. In that case, you don’t have much choice but to leave your 
device at the Genius Bar, or ship it back to Apple for repairs. Fortunately, however, most 
glitches are temporary and can often be fixed by employing a few standard techniques, 
particularly restarting or rebooting your device.

Chapter 1 ■ Learning Some General Troubleshooting Techniques

If your iPhone is behaving oddly or erratically, it’s possible that a specific component 
inside the phone is the cause. In that case, you don’t have much choice but to ship your 
iPhone back to Apple for repairs. Fortunately, however, most glitches are temporary and 
can often be fixed by using one or more of the following techniques:
Restarting Your Device
By far the most common solution to an iOS device problem is to shut it down and then 
restart it. By rebooting the device, you reset the entire system, which is often enough to 
solve many problems.
You restart an iOS device using the Sleep/Wake button, the location of which 
depends on your device:
• 
For the iPhone 6 and later, the button appears on the right edge of 
the phone, near the top.
• 
For all other iOS devices, the button appears on the top edge of 
the device, toward the right side.
Press and hold the Sleep/Wake button for a few seconds until you see the Slide to 
Power Off screen (at which point you can release the button). Drag the Slide to Power Off 
slider to the right to start the shutdown. When the screen goes completely black, your 
device is off. To restart, press and hold the Sleep/Wake button until you see the Apple 
logo and then release the button.
Rebooting Your Device Hardware 
When you restart your iOS device by pressing and holding Sleep/Wake for a few seconds, 
what you’re really doing is rebooting the system software. If that still doesn’t solve the 
problem, you might need to reboot the device hardware as well. To do that, press and 
hold down the Sleep/Wake and Home buttons at the same time. Keep them pressed 
until you see the Apple logo (it takes about 8 seconds or so), which indicates a successful 
restart.
■
■Note   A hardware reboot is also the way to go if your iOS device is really stuck and 
holding down just the Sleep/Wake button doesn’t do anything. It happens.

Updating Software
iOS checks for available updates from time to time when it’s connected to the Internet. If 
an update is available, you see a badge on the Settings app icon, as shown in Figure 1-1. 
You might also see a Software Update notification telling you that a new version of iOS is 
ready to install.
To proceed with the update, follow these steps:
	
1.	
If the Software Update alert is displayed, tap Install Now. 
Otherwise, on the Home screen, tap Settings. The Settings app 
appears.
	
2.	
Tap General. iOS displays the General screen. As you can see 
in Figure 1-2, when an update is available, you also see badges 
on the General tab and the Software Update command.

Settings app icon

3.	
Tap Download and Install. iOS downloads the update and 
then proceeds with the installation, which takes a few 
minutes.
Caution
■
■Note   Your iOS device only goes through with the update if it will have more than 
50-percent battery life through the entire update operation. To ensure the update is a 
success, either plug your device into an AC outlet or only run the update when the battery is 
fully charged.
Restoring Your Device from a Backup
It’s often the case that simply changing a setting or adding an app or some data can cause 
your iOS device to act wonky. Ideally the fix would be to return the setting to its previous 
state or remove the app or data, but it’s not always obvious which setting or bit of content 
is the culprit.
One solution is to return your device to an earlier state by restoring a recent backup. 
If you go back far enough, you should restore to a state in which the problem doesn’t 
exist. (Ideally, you shouldn’t go back any further than necessary because then you run too 
great a risk of losing other settings, apps, and data.)
Follow these steps to restore a recent backup:
	
1.	
On your device, turn off Find My iPhone, if it’s turned on. You 
do this by opening Settings, tapping iCloud, tapping Find My 
Device (where Device is iPhone, iPad or iPod), tapping the 
Find My Device switch to Off, and then entering your Apple 
password.
	
2.	
Connect your device to your computer.
	
3.	
In iTunes, click the device icon.
	
4.	
Click the Summary tab.
Figure 1-2.  When an update is ready for you, iOS displays badges on the Settings app’s 
General tab and Software Update command

5
	
5.	
Click Restore Backup. iTunes asks you to select a backup to 
restore, as shown in Figure 1-3.
	
6.	
Select the older backup that you want to restore. This should 
be the most recent backup that was made before the problem 
first occurred.
	
7.	
Click Restore. iTunes restores the backup and restarts the device.
Restoring Factory Settings
Sometimes your iOS device goes down for the count because its settings have become 
corrupted. In that case, you can fix the problem by restoring the device to its default 
factory settings.
Restoring Factory Defaults Via iTunes
The best way to restore factory settings is to use the Restore feature in iTunes because that 
enables you to back up and restore any settings you’ve changed on the device. There are a 
couple of things to think about here:
• 
If the corrupted setting is an iOS default that you never changed, 
then the restore operation will overwrite that corrupted setting 
and your problem should be solved. In that case, you should back 
up and restore your own settings.
• 
If the corrupted setting is one that you changed, then backing up 
and restoring your settings will likely re-create the problem. In 
that case, you should not back up and restore your settings.
Figure 1-3.  Select an earlier backup that was made before you began experiencing 
problems on your device

Chapter 1 ■ Learning Some General Troubleshooting Techniques
6
So what route should you take? First, try running the restore procedure by backing 
up and restoring your settings. If the problem goes away, you’re set; if the problem recurs, 
then it means one of your changed settings is the culprit, so you should repeat the restore, 
but this time don’t back up your settings.
Before proceeding, note that these steps require that your device be able to connect 
to your computer and be visible in iTunes. If that’s not the case, see the instructions for 
resetting the device in the next section. Otherwise, follow these steps to restore your 
device:
	
1.	
On your device, turn off Find My iPhone, if it’s turned on. You 
do this by opening Settings, tapping iCloud, tapping Find My 
Device (where Device is iPhone, iPad, or iPod), tapping the 
Find My Device switch to Off, and then entering your Apple 
password.
	
2.	
Connect your device to your computer.
	
3.	
In iTunes, click the device icon.
	
4.	
Click the Summary tab.
	
5.	
Click Back Up Now. This ensures that iTunes has a backup 
copy of your device data and settings.
■
■Caution   By default, iTunes doesn’t back up sensitive information such as saved 
passwords, web site history, and health data. To back up that data, select the Encrypt device 
backup check box (where device is iPhone, iPad, or iPod) and then run the backup.
	
6.	
Click Restore Device (where Device is iPhone, iPad, or iPod). 
iTunes asks you to confirm you want to restore.
	
7.	
Click Restore and then follow the prompts on the screen. 
iTunes downloads iOS and restores the original settings. 
When your device restarts, iTunes connects to it and might 
ask you to enter your Apple ID credentials. After you've done 
that, iTunes displays the Welcome to Your New device screen, 
as shown in Figure 1-4.

Chapter 1 ■ Learning Some General Troubleshooting Techniques
7
	
8.	
Select the Restore from this backup option.
	
9.	
If you happen to have more than one device backed up, use 
the list to choose yours.
	
10.	
Click Continue. iTunes restores your backed-up data, restarts 
your device, and syncs it.
	
11.	
Go through the tabs and check the sync settings to make sure 
they’re set up the way you want.
	
12.	
If you made any changes to the settings, click Apply. This 
ensures that your device has all its data restored.
Restoring Factory Settings on the Device
If your device is having problems that prevent it from connecting to your computer or 
being recognized by iTunes, you can still restore the factory default settings directly on 
the device. Here are the steps to follow:
	
1.	
Tap Settings in the Home screen.
	
2.	
Tap General.
	
3.	
Tap Reset.
Figure 1-4.  When your factory-fresh device restarts, iTunes offers to restore your backed-up 
settings and data

4.	
Tap Reset All Settings.
	
5.	
If your device is protected by a passcode, enter the passcode 
to continue.
	
6.	
When iOS asks you to confirm, tap Reset All Settings.
Troubleshooting Connected Accessories
There are only a few ways that you can connect accessories to your iOS device: using the 
headset jack, the Lightning connector, or Bluetooth. Although the number of accessories 
you can connect is relatively limited, that doesn’t mean you might never have problems 
with those accessories .
If you’re having trouble with an accessory attached to your iOS device, the good 
news is that a fair chunk of those problems have a relatively limited set of causes. You may 
be able to get the accessory back on its feet by attempting a few tried-and-true remedies. 
If it’s not immediately obvious what the problem is, then your hardware troubleshooting 
routine should always start with these very basic techniques:
• 
Check connections, power switches, and so on. Some of the 
most common (and most embarrassing) causes of hardware 
problems are the simple physical things, so make sure that the 
connected accessory is turned on and check that the cables 
(if any) are seated properly. For example, if you can’t access 
the Internet through the Wi-Fi connection on your iOS device, 
make sure your network’s router is turned on. Also make sure 
that the cable between your router and the ISP’s modem (if they 
aren’t a single device, as is often the case these days) is properly 
connected.
• 
Replace the batteries. Wireless devices such as headsets 
really chew through batteries, so if such a device is working 
intermittently (or not at all), always try replacing the batteries to 
see if that solves the problem.
• 
Turn the accessory off and then on again. You power cycle a 
device by turning it off, waiting a few seconds for its innards to 
stop spinning, and then turning it back on. You’d be amazed how 
often this simple procedure can get a device back up and running. 
For a device that doesn’t have an On/Off switch, try either 
unplugging it from the power outlet or removing and replacing 
the batteries.
• 
Reset the accessory's default settings. If you can configure the 
accessory, then perhaps some new setting is causing the problem. 
If you recently made a change, try returning the setting back to 
its original value. If that doesn’t do the trick, most configurable 
devices have some kind of Restore Default Settings option that 
enables you to quickly return them to their factory settings.

Chapter 1 ■ Learning Some General Troubleshooting Techniques
9
• 
Upgrade the accessory’s firmware. Some devices come with 
firmware — a small program that runs inside the device and 
controls its internal functions. For example, all routers have 
firmware. Check with the manufacturer to see if a new version 
exists. If it does, download the new version and then see the 
device’s manual to learn how to upgrade the firmware.
Advanced Troubleshooting Techniques
The techniques you’ve seen so far will in many cases get your iOS device back up and 
running. If not, there are still a couple of other techniques you can try.
Restoring Factory Settings When You Can’t Launch iOS
In some rare cases, your iOS device goes utterly haywire, where not only does iTunes not 
recognize the device, but you can’t even launch iOS. If this happens, you can still recover 
everything, but you have to do it using a special hardware mode called Device Firmware 
Upgrade (DFU). This mode essentially bypasses the current OS installed on the phone 
(which is good because in this scenario your current OS is toast) and tells iTunes to install 
a factory-fresh version of iOS. You can then restore your stuff as described earlier in this 
chapter (see “Restoring Your Device from a Backup”).
Follow these steps to put your device into DFU mode:
	
1.	
Turn off your device.
	
2.	
Connect your device to your Mac or your Windows PC.
	
3.	
Launch iTunes.
	
4.	
Press and hold down the Sleep/Wake and Home buttons for 
exactly 10 seconds.
	
5.	
After 10 seconds, release the Sleep/Wake button, but continue 
to hold down the Home button for another 10 seconds.

Chapter 1 ■ Learning Some General Troubleshooting Techniques
10
	
6.	
After 10 seconds, release the Home button. iTunes now recognizes 
your device and displays the dialog shown in Figure 1-5.
	
7.	
Click OK.
	
8.	
Click Restore Device (where device is iPhone, iPad, or iPod). 
iTunes asks you to confirm you want to restore.
	
9.	
Click Restore and Update. iTunes downloads and installs iOS 
and then restores your device to the factory defaults.
Erasing Your Device
If restoring the factory settings doesn’t get the job done, it could be some recalcitrant bit 
of content that’s causing the problem. In that case, you need to reset not only all your iOS 
settings, but all your content, as well. Here’s how it’s done:
	
1.	
Tap Settings.
	
2.	
Tap General.
	
3.	
Tap Reset.
	
4.	
Tap Reset All Content and Settings.
	
5.	
Enter your device passcode, if it’s set.
	
6.	
When iOS asks you to confirm, tap Erase Device (where Device 
is iPhone, iPad, or iPod).
■
■Caution   Unless you really do want to start over with original settings and no content, 
only run the Erase All Content and Settings command if you have your device backed up. 
See Chapter 8, “Protecting Your Device.”

CHAPTER 2
Fixing Networking and 
Cellular Woes
Your iOS device lets you perform a satisfyingly large range of fun and interesting tasks 
while you’re offline. You can play games, read saved articles, listen to downloaded music 
or podcasts, crack open an e-book, update your contacts, and much more. But iOS and 
the iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch really shine when they have access to the outside world, 
either via a Wi-Fi network or a cellular signal. With a link established, you can surf, 
e-mail, message, post, upload, download, and perform all the other online verbs that are 
the watchwords of today’s connected lifestyle.
Alas, you might find yourself having to revert to the satisfying-but-limited world of 
offline pastimes if you have trouble connecting your iOS device to a network. Even if you 
can get online, iOS might still cause you grief with the way it handles network or cellular 
connections. This chapter takes you through quite a few connectivity problems and offers 
solutions that will help you get iOS and your network working smoothly again.
Troubleshooting Wi-Fi Issues
If your network has become a “notwork” (some wags also refer to a downed network as 
a nyetwork), this chapter offers a few solutions that might help. I don’t make any claim 
to completeness here, however; after all, most network ills are a combination of several 
factors and therefore are relatively obscure and difficult to reproduce. Instead, I just go 
through a few general strategies for tracking down problems and pose solutions for some 
of the most common network afflictions.
You Have Trouble Accessing a Wi-Fi Network: Part I
If you’re having trouble connecting to a local Wi-Fi network, the problem might be with 
your device or it might be with the network itself. (I’m assuming here that you have a 
password for the network, if it requires one.) Let’s begin here in Part I by assuming that 
the problem rests with your device.

Chapter 2 ■ Fixing Networking and Cellular Woes
12
Solution: Turn the Wi-Fi antenna off and then on again. This resets the antenna, which is 
often enough to make the connection go through. To toggle the antenna, open Settings, 
tap Wi-Fi, tap the Wi-Fi switch (see Figure 2-1) to Off, and then tap the same switch back 
to On.
■
■Tip   You can also toggle the Wi-Fi antenna off and on by swiping up from the bottom of 
the screen to open the Control Center and then tapping the Wi-Fi icon twice. Tap outside the 
Control Center to close it.
You Have Trouble Accessing a Wi-Fi Network: Part II
If your iOS device still won’t connect to the Wi-Fi hotspot, then it’s possible the problem 
lies with the network itself. Unfortunately, wireless networking adds a whole new set of 
potential snags to your troubleshooting chores because of problems such as interference, 
compatibility, and device ranges.
Solution: Here’s a list of a few troubleshooting items that you should check to solve any 
wireless connectivity problems you’re having:
• 
Reboot devices. Reset your hardware by turning off the Wi-
Fi network’s router and then turning it back on again. If your 
network has a separate broadband modem, you should reboot 
that as well.
• 
Look for interference. Devices such as baby monitors and 
cordless phones that use the 2.4GHz radio frequency (RF) band 
can play havoc with wireless signals. Try either moving or turning 
off such devices if they’re near your wireless router.
■
■Caution   You should also keep your wireless router well away from a microwave oven; 
microwaves can jam wireless signals.
 
Figure 2-1.  Toggling the W-Fi switch off and then on again can often solve Wi-Fi woes

Chapter 2 ■ Fixing Networking and Cellular Woes
13
• 
Check your range. If you’re getting no signal or a weak signal, it 
could be that your iOS device is too far away from the Wi-Fi router. 
You usually can’t get much farther than about 115 feet away from 
any Wi-Fi access point before the signal begins to degrade (230 
feet if you’re using 802.11n devices). Either move closer to the 
router, or turn on the router’s range booster feature, if it has one. 
You could also install a wireless range extender.
• 
Change the channel. You can configure your wireless router to 
broadcast signals on a specific channel. Sometimes one channel 
gives a stronger signal than another, so try changing the channel. 
You do this by logging on to the router’s configuration pages and 
looking for a setting that determines the broadcast channel.
• 
Upgrade the router’s firmware. Some network problems are 
caused by router bugs. If the manufacturer has corrected these 
bugs, the fixes will appear in the latest version of the router 
firmware, so you should upgrade to the new version. See your 
router documentation to learn how to perform an upgrade.
• 
Reset the router. As a last resort, reset the router to its default 
factory settings (see the device documentation to learn how to do 
this). Note if you do this you’ll need to set up your network from 
scratch.
iOS Automatically Connects to a Network You No Longer 
Want to Use
When you join a Wi-Fi network, iOS remembers your connection details and joins 
that network automatically the next time it comes within range. This is convenient for 
networks you want to use, but it’s a pain for networks you no longer need. A common 
dilemma is having multiple networks available, one of which is more desirable (because, 
say, it’s faster or cheaper). If you’ve previously connected to some or all of the other 
networks, then there’s a good chance iOS will choose one of them for its automatic 
connection, leaving you with the hassle of connecting to the network you want manually.
Solution: Tell iOS to forget the network (or networks) you don’t want to use:
	
1.	
Run the Settings app and then tap Wi-Fi to open the Wi-Fi 
Networks screen.
	
2.	
Tap the blue More Info icon to the right of the network you 
want to forget. iOS displays the network’s settings screen.
	
3.	
Tap Forget this Network, shown in Figure 2-2. iOS asks you to 
confirm.
	
4.	
Tap Forget. iOS discards the login data for the network and no 
longer connects to the network automatically.

Chapter 2 ■ Fixing Networking and Cellular Woes
14
You’re Getting Frequent Prompts to Join  
Nearby Wi-Fi Networks
By default, when your device requires a network connection and you’re not already 
connected to a Wi-Fi network, iOS displays the Select a Wireless Network dialog to show 
you nearby networks. However, as you move around town, you may find that dialog 
popping up all too frequently as new Wi-Fi networks come within range (although iOS 
is smart enough not to prompt when you’re moving quickly — such as when you’re 
driving). These constant prompts are both annoying and inconvenient.
Solution: Tell iOS to stop prompting you to join nearby networks. Open the Settings app, 
tap Wi-Fi, and then tap the Ask to Join Networks switch to Off, as shown in Figure 2-3.
You Want to Connect to a Hidden Wi-Fi Network
Each Wi-Fi network has a network name — often called the Service Set Identifier, or SSID 
— which identifies the network to Wi-Fi devices. By default, Wi-Fi networks broadcast 
the network name so that you can see it in the Select a Wireless Network dialog or the 
Wi-Fi screen in the Settings app. However, some Wi-Fi networks disable network name 
broadcasting as a security precaution. Why? The thinking is that if an unauthorized user 
can’t see the network, he or she can’t attempt to connect to it. (However, some devices 
can still pick up the network name when authorized computers connect to it, so this is 
not a foolproof security measure.) If you’re an authorized user, however, how do you 
connect to a network you can’t see?
Figure 2-2.  If you no longer want to connect to a particular network, tap the Forget This 
Network button
Figure 2-3.  To turn off the constant prompts to join nearby Wi-Fi networks, tap the Ask to 
Join Networks switch to Off

Chapter 2 ■ Fixing Networking and Cellular Woes
15
Solution: You can connect to a hidden Wi-Fi network by entering the connection settings 
by hand. You need to know the network name, its security and encryption types, and the 
network password. Here’s how it’s done:
	
1.	
Open the Settings app and then tap Wi-Fi.
	
2.	
In the list of nearby networks, tap Other. iOS displays the 
Other Network screen.
	
3.	
Type the network name in the Name text box.
	
4.	
Tap Security to open the Security screen and then tap the type 
of security the Wi-Fi network uses: None, WEP, WPA, WPA2, 
WPA Enterprise, or WPA2 Enterprise. If you’re not sure, most 
secure networks use WPA2.
	
5.	
Tap Other Network to return to the Other Network screen. 
If you chose WEP, WPA, WPA2, WPA Enterprise, or WPA2 
Enterprise, iOS prompts you to enter the network password.
	
6.	
Type the password in the Password text box, as shown in 
Figure 2-4.
	
7.	
Tap Join. iOS connects to the network.
You’re Having Trouble Sending a File via AirDrop
You can transfer files between your Mac and your iOS device by syncing via iTunes. 
However, if you just want to pass along a single file from your device to the other, the sync 
procedure is overkill. Instead, if your Mac is running OS X Yosemite or later and your 
iPhone is running iOS 8 or later, and your Mac and iPhone are connected to the same 
Wi-Fi network, you can use a tool called AirDrop to send a file directly between your Mac 
and your device.
However, you might find that the two devices don’t see each other or that the file 
does not transfer.
Figure 2-4.  To join a hidden network, type the network name, select the security type, and 
then enter the password

Chapter 2 ■ Fixing Networking and Cellular Woes
16
Solution: If you don’t see your iOS device from your Mac, or if you don’t see your Mac 
from your iOS device, here are some things to check:
• 
Make sure that both your Mac and your iOS device are connected 
to the same Wi-Fi network.
• 
AirDrop requires Bluetooth as well as Wi-Fi, so make sure both 
your Mac and your iOS device have Bluetooth enabled:
• 
In iOS, swipe up from the bottom of the screen to display the 
Control Center, and then tap to activate the Bluetooth icon. 
Tap outside the Control Center to close it.
• 
In macOS (or OS X), open System Preferences, click 
Bluetooth, and then make sure the Bluetooth setting is On. 
(If it says Off, click Turn Bluetooth On.)
■
■Tip   If you have Wi-Fi and/or Bluetooth turned off in iOS, a quick way to turn them both 
on is to open any share sheet and tap the AirDrop icon. You can also swipe up from the 
bottom of the screen to display the Control Center, tap AirDrop, and then tap Contacts Only. 
Tap outside the Control Center to close it. 
• 
Make sure your iOS device and your Mac are within 33 feet of 
each other so that they can discover each other via Bluetooth.
• 
Make sure the iOS device has AirDrop turned on. Swipe up 
from the bottom of the screen to display the Control Center, tap 
AirDrop, and then tap Contacts Only (see Figure 2-5). If you still 
don’t see your device on your Mac, tap Everyone, instead.
Figure 2-5.  In the iOS Control Center, tap AirDrop and then tap either Contacts Only or 
Everyone

Chapter 2 ■ Fixing Networking and Cellular Woes
17
• 
Make sure your Mac is discoverable. Open the AirDrop 
window (in Finder, click Go and then click AirDrop, or press 
Shift+Cmd+R). In the Allow me to be discovered by list, select 
Contacts Only. If you still don’t see your Mac from iOS, select 
Everyone, instead.
• 
If you’ve set AirDrop to Contacts Only, make sure both your iOS 
device and your Mac are signed in to the same iCloud account.
• 
Make sure neither your iOS device nor your Mac are in sleep 
mode.
If an AirDrop file transfer fails, try these solutions:
• 
Make sure neither your iOS device nor your Mac are in Do Not 
Disturb mode:
• 
In iOS, swipe up from the bottom of the screen to display 
the Control Center, and then tap to deactivate the Do Not 
Disturb icon.
• 
In OS X or macOS, click the Notifications icon to display the 
Notification Center, click the Notifications tab, scroll to the 
top of the tab, and then click to set the Do Not Disturb switch 
to Off.
• 
Make sure your iOS device doesn’t have the Personal Hotspot 
feature activated. Open the Settings app, tap Personal Hotspot, 
and then tap the Personal Hotspot switch to Off.
• 
Do not try to send multiple files of different file types. For 
example, while it’s okay to send two or more image files, you can’t 
send, say, an image file and a PDF at the same time.
• 
Make sure your Mac isn’t in legacy mode, where it’s configured 
to only send files to Macs issued in 2012 or earlier. On the Mac, 
open the AirDrop window. If you see the text “Searching for older 
Macs…,” click Cancel to exit legacy mode.
• 
Make sure the Mac Firewall isn’t configured to block all incoming 
connections. Open System Preferences, click Security & Privacy, 
click Firewall, click the lock icon, and then enter your Mac’s 
administrative password. Click to deactivate the Block all 
incoming connections check box, if necessary, and then click OK.
If all else fails, reset your iOS network settings. In the Settings app, tap General, tap 
Reset, tap Reset Network Settings, and then when iOS asks you to confirm, tap Reset 
Network Settings.

Troubleshooting Cellular Issues
If you have an iPhone or an iPad with a cellular antenna, you know the freedom and 
efficiency of having an always-on data connection as long as there’s a cellular network 
within range. That convenience doesn’t come cheap, unfortunately, so most cellular 
problems center around keeping your data and roaming charges in check. This section 
takes you through these and other cellular-related problems.
You Can Send E-Mail over Wi-Fi but Not over Cellular
You might find that you can send e-mail messages just fine at home or at work, but 
e-mails sent while you’re walking around town or in transit just sit in the Mail app’s 
Outbox. This feels like a bug, but it’s actually a feature because many cellular providers 
don’t allow mail to be sent through third-party servers. That’s not a problem when you’re 
on Wi-Fi because your messages don’t get sent via the cellular network, but as soon as 
you’re off Wi-Fi, the cellular network kicks in and your provider prevents third-party 
messages from being sent.
Solution: Your cellular provider will have set up an outgoing server to handle sent 
messages, so you need to set up that server as a secondary SMTP server for your e-mail 
account. iOS will try sending messages using the account’s default server, but if that fails 
(when you’re on the cellular network instead of a Wi-Fi network, for example), it will fall 
back to the secondary server and your message will get sent.
To set up a secondary SMTP server, follow these steps:
	
1.	
Open the Settings app and then tap Mail, Contacts, Calendars.
	
2.	
Tap your e-mail account.
	
3.	
Tap your outgoing mail server.
	
4.	
Tap Add Server.
	
5.	
Enter your cellular provider’s SMTP host name, as well as your 
user name and password.
	
6.	
Tap Save.
You Are Not Sure How Much Data You Are Using
If you’re using your iOS device with a plan that comes with a maximum amount of 
monthly data and you exceed that monthly cap, you’ll almost certainly pay big bucks 
for the privilege. To avoid that, most cellular providers are kind enough to send you a 
message when you approach your cap. However, if you don’t trust that process, or if 
you’re just paranoid about these things (justly, in my view), then you might prefer to keep 
an eye on your data usage yourself.

Chapter 2 ■ Fixing Networking and Cellular Woes
19
Solution: iOS keeps track of the cellular network data it has sent or received, as well as the 
roaming data it has sent or received if you’ve used your iPhone out of your coverage area. 
First, take a look at your most recent bill from your cellular provider and, in particular, 
look for the dates the bill covers. For example, the bill might run from the 24th of one 
month to the 23rd of the next month. This is important because it tells you when you 
need to reset the usage data on your device.
Now follow these steps to check your cellular data usage:
	
1.	
Open the Settings app and then tap Cellular to display the 
Cellular screen.
	
2.	
In the Cellular Data Usage section, read the Current Period 
and Current Period Roaming values (see Figure 2-6).
	
3.	
If you’re at the end of your data period, tap Reset Statistics at 
the bottom of the screen to start with fresh values for the new 
period.
You Want to Prevent Your iOS Device from  
Using Cellular Data
If you’ve reached the limit of your cellular data plan, you almost certainly want to avoid 
going over the cap because the charges are usually prohibitively expensive. As long as 
you have a Wi-Fi network in range, or you’re disciplined enough not to surf the Web or 
cruise YouTube when there’s no Wi-Fi in sight, you’ll be okay. Still, accidents can happen. 
For example, you might accidentally tap a link in an e-mail message or text message, 
or someone in your household might use your phone without knowing about your 
restrictions.
Solution: To prevent these sorts of accidents (or if you simply don’t trust yourself 
when it comes to YouTube), you can turn off cellular data altogether, which means 
your device accesses Internet data only if it has a Wi-Fi signal. To turn off cellular data 
on your iOS device, open the Settings app, tap Cellular, and then tap the Cellular Data 
switch to Off.
Figure 2-6.  Read the values in the Cellular Data Usage section

Chapter 2 ■ Fixing Networking and Cellular Woes
20
You Want More Control over How Your iOS Device Uses 
Cellular Data
Rather than turning off cellular data completely, as I described in the previous section, 
you can take a more targeted approach. For example, if you’re a bit worried about going 
over your cellular plan’s data ceiling, it makes sense to avoid relatively high-bandwidth 
items, such as FaceTime and iTunes, but not relatively low-bandwidth content, such as 
iCloud documents and the Safari reading list.
Solution: You could just police this yourself but, hey, you’re a busy person and you might 
forget the next time a FaceTime call comes in and you’re in a cellular-only neighborhood. 
I say leave the details to iOS by configuring it to not allow certain content types over a 
cellular connection. To do that, open the Settings app and tap Cellular. In the Use Cellular 
Data For section, shown in Figure 2-7, tap the switch to Off for each type of content you 
want to ban from cellular.
You Want to Prevent iOS from Using Data Roaming
Data roaming is an often-convenient feature that enables you to make calls — and, with 
your iOS device, surf the Web, check and send e-mail, and exchange text messages — 
when you’re outside of your normal coverage area. The downside is that, unless you’ve 
got a fixed-rate roaming package from your cellular provider, roaming charges are almost 
always eye-poppingly expensive. You’re often talking several dollars per minute or 
megabyte, depending on where you are and what type of service you’re using. Not good!
Unfortunately, if you have the iOS Data Roaming feature turned on, you may incur 
massive roaming charges even if you never use your device! That’s because iOS still performs 
background checks for things like incoming e-mail messages and text messages, so a week in 
some far-off land could cost you hundreds of dollars without even using your phone.
Solution: To avoid this, turn off the Data Roaming feature on your device when you don’t 
need it. To do this, open the Settings app, tap Cellular, tap Cellular Data Options, and then 
tap the Data Roaming switch to Off.

connection

Troubleshooting Bluetooth Issues
iOS supports a wireless technology called Bluetooth, which enables you to make wireless 
connections to other Bluetooth-friendly devices, such as headsets, keyboards, and game 
controllers. In theory, connecting Bluetooth devices is supposed be criminally easy, but 
in practice that’s often not the case, so this section provides you with a few common 
troubleshooting techniques.
You Don’t See a Bluetooth Device
Not surprisingly, you can’t make a Bluetooth connection if you can’t see the device in the 
Settings app’s Bluetooth window.
Solution: If you don’t see a Bluetooth device in the Settings app, try the following:
• 
Make sure the device is turned on and fully charged.
• 
Make sure the device is discoverable. Unlike Wi-Fi devices that 
broadcast their signals constantly, most Bluetooth devices 
broadcast their availability — that is, they make themselves 
discoverable — only when you say so. Most Bluetooth devices 
have a switch you can turn on or a button you can press to make 
them discoverable.
• 
Make sure the Bluetooth device is well within 33 feet of your 
iOS device, since that’s the maximum range for most Bluetooth 
devices. (Some so-called Class 1 Bluetooth devices have a 
maximum range 10 times as long.)
• 
Make sure iOS has Bluetooth enabled. In the Settings app, tap 
Bluetooth, and then tap the Bluetooth switch to On, as shown in 
Figure 2-8.
Figure 2-8.  In the Settings app, make sure the Bluetooth switch is set to On
• 
If possible, reboot the Bluetooth device. If you can’t reboot the 
device, or the reboot doesn’t solve the problem, reboot your iOS 
device.
• 
Check with the Bluetooth device manufacturer to ensure the 
device is capable of being paired with iOS devices.

Chapter 2 ■ Fixing Networking and Cellular Woes
22
You Can’t Pair with a Bluetooth Device
As a security precaution, many Bluetooth devices need to be paired with another device 
before the connection is established. In some cases, the pairing is accomplished by 
entering a multidigit passkey — iOS calls it a PIN — that you must then enter into the 
Bluetooth device (assuming, of course, that it has some kind of keypad). For all other 
Bluetooth devices, you initiate the pairing by tapping the device in the Settings app’s 
Bluetooth screen. Either way, you might find that even though the device shows up fine in 
the Bluetooth screen, you cannot pair it with your iOS device.
Solution: First try the solutions in the previous section. If you still can’t get the pairing to 
work, tell iOS to start over by forgetting what it knows about the device:
	
1.	
Open the Settings app, and then tap Bluetooth.
	
2.	
Tap the blue More Info icon to the right of the Bluetooth 
device name.
	
3.	
Tap Forget this Device. iOS asks you to confirm.
	
4.	
Tap OK.
	
5.	
When the device reappears in the Bluetooth window, trying 
pairing with it again.
You Don’t Hear Audio through a Paired Headset
After you pair a Bluetooth headset, iOS is usually smart enough to start blasting your 
tunes through the headset instead of the device’s built-in speaker. The operative word 
here is “usually,” since every so often iOS fails to do this.
Solution: You need to manually specify your paired headset as the output device. Swipe 
up from the bottom of the screen to open the Control Center, tap the AirPlay icon that 
appears below the playback controls (to the right of the AirDrop section), and then tap 
your paired Bluetooth headset (see Figure 2-9). iOS now plays your device audio through 
the headset.

CHAPTER 3
Solving App Problems
Your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch is an impressive piece of industrial design. From the 
responsive touchscreen to the powerful cameras to the overall sleek design, an iOS device 
is a work of art as much as it’s a work of engineering. But all that hardware is useless 
without some software to make it come alive, and in the iOS world, that software comes 
in the form of the app. This includes not only the various apps that are installed by default 
with iOS, but also those Apple and third-party apps that are available for download using 
the App Store.
In short, world-class hardware notwithstanding, your iOS device is both defined 
and constrained by the apps that are installed on it. Why constrained? Because it’s the 
stark truth that if your apps don’t work properly, then neither does your iOS device. 
If you can’t find an app, if an app crashes, or if an app behaves in a way the developer 
didn’t intend, then your iOS experience will be compromised. To help you avoid that 
situation — or to help you get out of it — this chapter presents a few problems and 
solutions related to apps.
General App Troubleshooting
App problems can run the gamut from not being able to locate an app or its data 
(bothersome), to an app behaving strangely (annoying), or to an app not working at all 
(aggravating). The good news is that, unless the app was created by a truly incompetent 
developer, most app problems can be solved quickly or, at least, straightforwardly.
You Find Searching Difficult Because  
iOS Returns Items from Too Many Apps
When you run a Spotlight search on your iOS device, you might see results from a wide 
variety of apps, depending on the search text. For a more general search, you can easily 
see results from a couple of dozen or more apps.

Chapter 3 ■ Solving App Problems
24
Solution: Configure Spotlight search to not show results from apps you use only rarely 
or from apps you never search. To configure Spotlight search, open the Settings app, tap 
General, and then tap Spotlight Search. In the Search Results section, tap the switch to Off 
beside each app you want to exclude from the search (see Figure 3-1).
You Find It Difficult to Locate an App
If you get a bit carried away at the App Store, you can easily end up with a couple of 
hundred icons scattered over a dozen or more pages (the max is 15 pages). Since the 
apps were most likely installed in no particular order, finding a single app icon can be 
frustratingly time consuming.
Solution: You can reset your Home screen layout, which does two things:
• 
It restores the main Home screen and possibly part of the second 
Home screen (depending on the device and iOS version) to the 
factory default icon arrangement.
• 
It displays all your third-party app icons in alphabetical order.
Figure 3-1.  In Settings, use the Spotlight Search screen to tell iOS which apps to exclude 
from the search results

Chapter 3 ■ Solving App Problems
25
■
■Caution   Resetting the Home screen layout also deletes any custom app folders that 
you created.
To reset your Home screen layout, open Settings, tap General, tap Reset, tap Reset 
Home Screen Layout, and then when iOS asks for confirmation, tap Reset Home Screen.
An App Is Displaying Too Many Notifications
Like a noisy or rude houseguest, some apps respond to being invited into your iOS home 
by displaying notifications that are too frequent or too insistent.
Solution: Take control of the app’s notifications by configuring them to your liking. Open 
the Settings app, tap Notifications, and then tap the app you want to work with. iOS 
displays the app’s notification options, as shown in Figure 3-2. Note that some apps — 
such as Calendar — divide their notifications into categories, so you might need to tap a 
category before you see options such as those shown in Figure 3-2.
Figure 3-2.  Use an app's notification settings to control how often and where you see its 
notifications

Chapter 3 ■ Solving App Problems
26
You now have the following choices for configuring the app’s notifications:
• 
To stop the app’s notifications altogether, tap the Allow 
Notifications switch to Off.
• 
To not see the app’s notification in the Notification Center, tap the 
Show in Notification Center switch to Off.
• 
To not hear the app’s notification sounds, tap the Sounds switch 
to Off. For some apps, you turn off notification sounds by tapping 
Sounds to see a list of sounds, then tapping None.
• 
To not see the app’s badge icon, tap the Badge App Icon switch to Off.
• 
To not see the app’s notifications on the Lock screen, tap the Show 
on Lock Screen switch to Off.
• 
Use the Alert Style When Unlocked section to choose the style 
you prefer for the app’s notifications. Tap None to turn off 
alerts, or tap the style you want: Banners (which disappear 
automatically after a few seconds) or Alerts (which don’t 
disappear until you dismiss them).
Your Facebook Data Doesn’t Appear in the Contacts or 
Calendar App
iOS comes with Facebook support built right in to the system. You can easily post links, 
photos, and other content to your Facebook Timeline, and even send simple status 
updates without having to load the Facebook app. However, this baked-in Facebook 
support is far less of a convenience if you can’t see your Facebook friends in the Contacts 
app or your Facebook events in the Calendar app.
Solution: If you’re not seeing your Facebook friends in the Contacts app, here are two 
things to try:
• 
In the Settings app, tap Facebook and then tap the Contacts 
switch to On.
• 
In the Contacts app, tap Groups and then tap to activate the All 
Facebook group.
If you’re not seeing your Facebook events in the Calendar app, try the following:
• 
In the Settings app, tap Facebook and then tap the Calendar 
switch to On.
• 
In the Calendar app, tap Calendars and then tap to activate the 
Facebook Events calendar.

Chapter 3 ■ Solving App Problems
27
An App is Frozen
If your iOS device screen freezes, the cause could be an app that has crashed.
Solution: You can usually get your device back in the saddle by forcing the app to quit. 
There are two techniques you can try:
• 
Press and hold the Sleep/Wake button until you see the Slide to 
Power Off screen; then press and hold the Home button for about 
6 seconds. iOS shuts down the app and returns you to the Home 
screen.
• 
If an app is frozen but your device still works fine otherwise, 
double-press the Home button to display the multitasking screen, 
scroll right or left as needed to bring the app’s thumbnail screen 
into view, then drag the app thumbnail up to the top of the screen. 
Your iPhone sends the thumbnail off the screen and shuts down 
the app.
Your Screen Won’t Respond to Taps
Every now and then, your iOS device might freeze and no amount of tapping, swiping, 
or threatening will get the phone to respond. The most likely problem is that the 
touchscreen has become temporarily stuck. To fix that, press the Sleep/Wake button to 
put the device to sleep, press Sleep/Wake again to wake the device, and then drag Slide to 
Unlock. In most cases, you should now be able to resume normal iOS operations.
If that doesn’t work, then it’s possible that the app you’re using has crashed, so you 
need to shut it down as I described in the “An app is frozen” section.
An App Is Taking up a Large Amount of Space
Your iOS device is so useful and so much fun, it’s easy to forget that it has limitations, 
especially when it comes to storage. This is particularly true if you have a 16GB device, 
but even a device with greater capacity can fill up in a hurry if you stuff it with movies, TV 
shows, and tons of magazine subscriptions.
You can tell how much free space your device has left either by connecting it to 
iTunes or by tapping Settings, then General, and then Storage & iCloud Usage. The 
Storage & iCloud Usage screen not only shows you how much storage space you have 
available but also lets you tap Manage Storage to see how much space each app is using.
If you see that your device is running low on space, check the apps to see if any of 
them are taking up more than their fair share of hard drive real estate.

Chapter 3 ■ Solving App Problems
28
Solution: If you see a hard drive hog, you have two ways to delete its data and give your 
device some room to breathe:
• 
Third-party apps. For an app you picked up via the App Store, 
tap the app, tap Delete App, and then tap Delete App when your 
iPhone asks you to confirm.
• 
Built-in apps. For an app that came with iOS (such as Music 
or Video), tap the app to display a list of the data it’s storing on 
your device, and then tap Edit. This puts the list in Edit mode. To 
remove an item, tap the red Delete button to the left of the item, 
and then tap the Delete button that appears (see Figure 3-3).
You Want to Control Third-Party Usage of Your Apps
Every so often an app will request access to another app on your device, such as Contacts, 
Calendars, or Photos. If you’ve installed a lot of apps, you might have lost track which of 
these third-party programs have access to your other apps.
Solution: You can allow or revoke third-party app permission to specific apps by 
following these steps:
	
1.	
Open the Settings app and then tap Privacy.
	
2.	
Tap the app for which you want to control access. iOS displays 
a list of apps that have requested access to the app, as shown 
in Figure 3-4.
	
3.	
Beside each app, tap the switch to Off to revoke access, or On 
to allow access.
Figure 3-3.  To remove data from a built-in app, tap the red Delete button and then tap the 
Delete button that appears

You’re Having Trouble Using the Handoff Feature
You can use the Handoff feature to start a task on your iOS device and then continue that 
task using a nearby Mac. (Handoff works the other way, as well: You can start a task on 
your Mac and then continue the task on your iOS device.) You might find, however, that 
Handoff doesn’t work and you can’t continue a task.
Solution: First, make sure that your devices meet the following guidelines to use Handoff:
• 
Your Mac must be running OS X Yosemite or later, or any version 
of macOS.
• 
Your Mac must support Bluetooth 4.0. To check, click the Apple 
icon, click About This Mac, click System Report, click Bluetooth, 
then read the LMP Version. If it says 0x6, then your Mac supports 
Bluetooth 4.0.
■
■Tip   If your Mac doesn’t support Bluetooth 4.0, you might still be able to use Continuity 
if you install the third-party Continuity Activation Tool, available from https://github.com/
dokterdok/Continuity-Activation-Tool. 
• 
Your iOS device must be running iOS 8 or later.
• 
Both your Mac and your device must be signed in to the same 
iCloud account.
• 
Your iOS device must be within about 33 feet of your Mac.
Figure 3-4.  You can allow or revoke third-party access to your apps

Chapter 3 ■ Solving App Problems
30
If that all checks out, make sure your Mac is configured to accept Handoff 
connections:
	
1.	
Open System Preferences.
	
2.	
Click General.
	
3.	
Click to select the Allow Handoff between this Mac and your 
iCloud devices check box.
Finally, make sure iOS is configured to accept Handoff connections:
	
1.	
Open the Settings app.
	
2.	
Tap General.
	
3.	
Tap Handoff.
	
4.	
Tap the Handoff switch to On.
Advanced App Troubleshooting
As a general rule, you never have to worry about opening “too many” iOS apps, because 
the system takes care of managing your apps and the resources they consume. However, 
I’ve included the following “problem” to give you a more advanced look at how iOS 
handles app opening and closing.
You Have Too Many Apps Open 
On a Mac or PC, having too many programs open can cause problems with system 
resources, particularly memory. However, even though iOS supports multitasking, it 
doesn’t suffer from the same too-many-apps troubles that plague desktop machines.
To understand why, first know that, at its most basic, multitasking on iOS means 
that whenever you run an app and then switch to another app, your device keeps the first 
app available in the background. In most cases, the first app does nothing while it’s in 
the background — it doesn’t take any processor time away from your current app and it 
doesn’t use battery power. This means that you’re free to open as many apps as you like. 
However, if the first app is performing some task and you switch to another app, the first 
app continues to perform the task in the background.
To get a firm grip on how iOS multitasking works, you need to understand the four 
modes an app can have on iOS:
• 
Running State. The app is open and has the focus of the system.
• 
Closed State. This mode means the app is completely shut down. 
If you reboot your device (by turning it off and then back on), all 
your apps are then in the Closed State.
• 
Suspended State. If you launch an app, then press the Home 
button to return to the Home screen, usually iOS places the 
running app into the Suspended State. This means the app 

Chapter 3 ■ Solving App Problems
31
remains loaded into memory, but it’s not running, it’s not using 
up processor time, and it’s not draining the battery. However, the 
app still maintains its current conditions, so that when you return 
to it, the app resumes where you left off.
• 
Background State. If you launch an app, start some process such 
as playing music, and then press the Home button to return to 
the Home screen, your iPhone puts the app into the Background 
State, which means it keeps the app’s process running in the 
background. When you return to the app, either you see the 
process still running or it has been completed.
It’s important to note that the vast majority of apps go into the Suspended State when 
you switch to another app. However, if you launch an app and your device doesn’t have 
enough free memory available, iOS starts putting suspended apps into the Closed State to 
free up memory.
This built-in resource management is why having a lot of apps “open” in the 
multitasking screen (that is, the screen that appears when you double-tap the Home 
button; see Figure 3-5). Almost all of those apps are in the Closed State, so they’re not 
affecting system performance in the least. (For this reason, you should really think of the 
multitasking screen as the “most recently used apps” screen.)
Figure 3-5.  The iPhone multitasking screen can be quite busy with “open” apps, but few of 
them are using any system resources

CHAPTER 4
Resolving Web Issues
We live in a world where the promise of “information at your fingertips” (IAYF, to  
those in the know) has gone from a pie-in-the-sky daydream just 10 or 15 years ago to 
let-­me-look-that-up-for-you reality now. That’s because our fingertips are never far 
from a device – particularly an iPhone or cellular-enabled iPad – that’s connected to the 
Internet and its vast supply of information. Whether you need to resolve an argument, 
get directions to the nearest café, or remember the name of the actress who starred in 
Blossom, your iOS device is right there to help.
It helps that the Safari app that comes with iOS is a solid web browser that has all 
the features you’re likely to need. It’s a great browser, but unfortunately it’s not a perfect 
one, so you might encounter frustrations both small and large that can get in the way of 
your web surfing. This chapter tackles many of the most common Safari irritations and 
annoyances and shows you how to either work around them or fix them once and for all. 
So the next time you’re at a dinner party and someone claims that Dustin Hoffman was in 
Star Wars, you’ll be able to set the record straight in record time.
Troubleshooting Web Surfing Problems
You Have Trouble Viewing the Page Text or Other 
Information
We’re quite a number of years into the mobile web revolution, so it’s surprising how many 
websites are still not optimized for mobile viewing. This means you’ll often visit a site 
that was built with a desktop browser in mind, so the text, images and other data appear 
unreadably tiny, especially on a smaller iPhone or iPod touch screen.
Solution: Many websites enable you to zoom in on the page by placing two fingers on 
the screen and spreading them apart. A quick way to zoom in on a page that has various 
sections is to double-tap on the specific section – it could be an image, a paragraph, a 
table, or a column of text – that you want magnified. Safari zooms the section to fill the 
width of the screen. Double-tap again to return the page to the regular view.

Chapter 4 ■ Resolving Web Issues
34
■
■Note   The double-tap-to-zoom trick doesn’t work on all pages. If the web page 
developer has set the page’s maximum-scale property to 1, it means you can’t zoom the 
page to anything larger than its original size.
It Takes a Long Time to Scroll Back to  
the Top of a Long Web Page
Although most web pages contain only a screenful or two of text and images, some pages 
are quite lengthy and consist of many screens. If you’re reading a particularly long-
winded web page and you’re near the bottom, you may have quite a long way to scroll if 
you need to head back to the top to get to the address/search bar.
Solution: Save the wear and tear on your flicking finger! Instead, tap the status bar at the 
top of the screen once to display the address/search bar, then tap the status bar a second 
time; Safari immediately transports you to the top of the page.
■
■Tip   If you’re using any model of the iPhone 6 or later, you might find it hard to reach 
the top of the screen if you’re surfing one-handed. Remember that you can lightly ­ 
double-tap the Home button to drop the Safari screen down halfway and bring its top bar 
within easy reach.
You Want to View a Website’s Desktop Version
Many websites recognize that you’re surfing with an iOS device and display a “mobile” 
version of the site. This version is usually easier to read and navigate, but that ease almost 
always comes at the cost of having access to fewer site features.
Solution: If a site isn’t displaying the feature you want, you can request the site’s 
“desktop” version (that is, the full version that you’d see if you were using a desktop 
browser). Follow these steps:
	
1.	
Swipe down on the screen to reveal the menu bar.
	
2.	
Tap the Share button.
	
3.	
In the bottom list of share actions, tap Request Desktop Site, 
as shown in Figure 4-1.

You Find a Web Page’s Extra Features Too Distracting
Reading an article or essay online is no picnic. The problem is the sheer amount of 
distraction on almost any page: background colors or images that clash with the text; ads 
above, to the side of, and within the text; site features such as search boxes, feed links, 
and content lists; and those ubiquitous icons for sharing the article with your friends on 
Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, and on and on. Even worse, many of these features blink or 
change, so reading the page content is a real challenge.
Solution: Safari can help you solve this problem by offering the Reader feature for pages 
that support it. Reader removes all those extraneous page distractions that just get in the 
way of your reading pleasure. So, instead of a cacophony of text, icons, and images, you 
see pure, simple, large-enough-to-be-easily-read text. How do you arrive at this blissful 
state? By tapping the title bar at the top of the Safari screen and then tapping the Reader 
Figure 4-1.  To switch a site from mobile to desktop, tap Share, then tap Request Desktop Site

You Want to Open New Tabs in the Background
Depending on your iOS device and your version of iOS, when you tap and hold a link and 
then tap Open in New Tab, you might find that Safari immediately switches to the new tab 
and loads the link while you wait. That’s often the behavior you want because it lets you 
view the new web page as soon as it loads. However, you might find that most of the time 
you prefer to stay on the current web page and check out the new tab later.
Figure 4-2.  Today’s web pages are all too 
often festooned with ads, icons, and other  
bric-a-brac
Figure 4-3.  The Reader version of a web 
page is a simple and easy-to-read text affair
button, which appears on the left side of the address bar, as pointed out in Figure 4-2. 
Safari instantly transforms the page, and you see something similar to the page shown in 
Figure 4-3 (which is the Reader version of the page shown in Figure 4-2).

Chapter 4 ■ Resolving Web Issues
37
Solution: Having to perform the extra tap to get back to the current tab gets old in a hurry. 
The solution is to configure Safari to always open new tabs in the background. (This 
setting is off by default on the iPhone and iPod touch, but on by default on the iPad.) 
Follow these steps:
	
1.	
On the Home screen, tap Settings. The Settings app slides in.
	
2.	
Tap Safari. iOS displays the Safari screen.
	
3.	
On the iPhone or iPod touch, tap Open Links and then tap 
In Background, as shown in Figure 4-4. On the iPad, tap the 
Open New Tabs in Background switch to On.
You Want to Read One or More Pages While You’re 
Offline
In your web travels, you’ll often come upon a page with fascinating content that you can’t 
wait to read. Unfortunately, a quick look at the length of the article tells you that you’re 
going to need more time than you currently have available. You have a long flight or other 
stretch of offline time coming up, so that would be perfect, but how do you save web 
content for offline reading?
Solution: You can take advantage of a Safari feature called the Reading List. As the name 
implies, this is a simple list of things to read. When you don’t have time to read something 
now, add it to your Reading List and you can read it at your leisure, even when you’re not 
connected to the Internet.
There are a couple of techniques you can use to add a page to your Reading List:
• 
Use Safari to navigate to the page that you want to read later, tap 
the Share button, and then tap Add to Reading List.
• 
Tap and hold a link for the page that you want to read later and 
then tap Add to Reading List.
When you’re ready to read, open Safari, tap the Bookmarks button, and then tap the 
Reading List tab, shown in Figure 4-5. Safari displays all the items you’ve added to the list 
and you just tap the article you want to read. To make the list a bit easier to manage, tap 
Show Unread to see just the pages you haven’t yet perused.
Figure 4-4.  On the iPhone or iPod touch, tap In Background in the Open Links screen

Safari Does Not Offer to Save Website Passwords
A quintessential modern skill is remembering the dozens of usernames and passwords 
that give us entry into our favorite websites. Safari can help here by offering to store a 
website’s account data and then enter it automatically each subsequent time. That’s a 
major timesaver, but sometimes Safari doesn’t offer to save a site’s login data.
Solution: There are three main reasons why Safari might not be offering to save a site’s 
username and password:
• 
Some websites request that browsers not save passwords, and 
Safari honors those requests. In this case, you can add the 
password manually, as shown below.
• 
Safari might be configured to not save usernames and passwords. 
To check, open Settings, tap Safari, tap AutoFill, and then tap the 
Names and Passwords switch to On.
Figure 4-5.  Safari’s Reading List tab contains the web pages you’ve saved for later

Chapter 4 ■ Resolving Web Issues
39
• 
Safari might be in Private Browsing mode, in which case it does 
not save any data, including website login data. To check, open 
Safari and examine the menu bar. If the menu bar appears 
black or dark gray (see Figure 4-6) instead of white or light gray, 
then Safari is in Private Browsing mode. To fix this, exit Private 
Browsing mode by tapping the Tabs icon and then tapping the 
Private button to deactivate it.
Here are the steps to follow to enter a website’s username and password manually:
	
1.	
Tap Settings to display the Settings app.

Tap Safari. The Safari screen appears.

4.	
Enter your passcode or Touch ID. The Passwords screen 
appears.
	
5.	
Tap Add Password. The Add Password screen appears.
	
6.	
Fill in the website’s address, your username, and your 
password. The password appears in regular text instead of the 
usual dots, so make sure no one’s peeking over your shoulder 
as you do this.

Tap Done. iOS saves the login data for the site.
You Want to Save Your Credit Card Data
Shopping is a favorite online pastime, and it’s one where, if you do it often enough, 
entering your credit card’s number and expiration data by hand get can tiresome.
Solution: You can save your credit card data in Safari so you don’t have to constantly 
enter your card’s particulars. Follow these steps to configure Safari to save your credit 
card data when you make online purchases:
	
1.	
In the Home screen, tap Settings to open the Settings app.
	
2.	
Tap Safari. The Safari screen appears.
	
3.	
Tap AutoFill to open the AutoFill screen.
	
4.	
Tap the Credit Cards switch to On.
■
■Tip   Instead of adding your credit card data by hand, Safari enables you to enter the 
data automatically using the camera. In the AutoFill screen, tap Saved Credit Cards, enter 
your passcode (you really should use a passcode or Touch ID if you’re adding credit cards 
to your iOS device; see Chapter 9), then tap Add Credit Card. Tap Use Camera, position the 
credit card within the camera field, and then wait until the card info is recognized.
You Want to View a Site’s Pop-up Window
Pop-up ads have been a scourge on the web for almost as long as there has been a web. 
The frustration caused by these irritants was so great that, for a while now, all modern 
browsers have included a pop-up blocker that is activated by default, and iOS Safari is no 
exception.
However, not all pop-up windows are annoyances. Some might show useful 
information or a key feature of a website’s interface. With pop-ups blocked, however, you 
miss out on this information or feature.

Chapter 4 ■ Resolving Web Issues
41
Solution: You can temporarily turn off Safari’s pop-up blocker when you visit a site that 
has a pop-up window you want to see. Here are the steps to follow:
	
1.	
In the Home screen, tap Settings to display the Settings app.
	
2.	
Tap Safari. The Safari screen appears.
	
3.	
Tap the Block Pop-ups switch to Off, as shown in Figure 4-7.
You can now use Safari to visit the site, and its pop-up window will appear in a new 
tab. When you’re done with that site, follow the above steps once again to tap the Block 
Pop-ups switch back to On.
You Want to View a Link’s Address Before Tapping It
As you know, in iOS Safari you “click” a link in a web page by tapping it. These days, 
however, a savvy surfer always checks a link’s address before clicking it because you just 
never know where you might end up. The address doesn’t always indicate a nefarious or 
shady site, but it doesn’t hurt to check.
In a regular web browser, you can see where a link takes you (that is, you can see the 
link’s URL) by hovering the mouse pointer over the link and checking out the link address 
in the status bar. That doesn’t work in iOS Safari, so how can you find out the address of a 
link before tapping it?
Solution: Tap and hold the link for a few seconds. Safari then displays a pop-up screen 
showing the link text and, more importantly, the URL, as shown in Figure 4-8. If the link 
looks legit, either tap Open to surf there in the current browser page or tap Open in New 
Page to start a fresh page. If you decide not to follow the link, tap outside the menu.
Figure 4-7.  To temporarily allow a site’s pop-up windows, tap the Block Pop-ups switch to 
Off, then visit the site

Troubleshooting Searching Problems
You Want to Use a Different Search Engine
Google is the default search engine on iOS. Almost everyone uses Google, of course, but 
if you have something against it, you might want to switch and use a different search 
engine. For example, many people dislike Google’s add-tracking, so they switch to 
DuckDuckGo, which doesn’t track its users.
Solution: You can use Safari to navigate to another search engine’s URL and search from 
there. However, Safari’s default search engine is more convenient because it means you 
can search directly from the address box. Although Google is the default search engine 
for iOS, it’s not the only one it supports. Here are the steps to follow to set up a different 
search engine as the Safari default:
	
1.	
Open the Settings app.
	
2.	
Tap Safari. The Safari screen appears.
	
3.	
Tap Search Engine. iOS opens the Search Engine screen.
	
4.	
Tap the search engine you want to use. As shown in Figure 4-9, 
you have four choices: Google, Yahoo, Bing, or DuckDuckGo.

It Is Difficult to Find Specific Information within a Web 
Page
When you’re perusing a page on the web, it’s not unusual to be looking for specific 
information. In those situations, rather than reading through the entire page to find the 
info you seek, it would be a lot easier to search for the data. You can easily do this in the 
desktop version of Safari or any other computer browser, but, at first glance, the Safari 
app doesn’t seem to have a “Find” feature anywhere.
Solution: Safari does offer such a feature, but you need to know where to look:
	
1.	
Use the Safari app to navigate to the web page that contains 
the information you seek.
	
2.	
Tap the web page title bar (or swipe down on the screen) to 
display the menu bar, and then tap inside the address/search 
box at the top of the Safari window.
	
3.	
Type the search text you want to use. Safari displays the web 
page matches, but at the bottom of those matches it also 
displays “On This Page (X matches),” where X is the number of 
times your search text appears on the web page.
	
4.	
Flick the search results up to hide the keyboard.
	
5.	
Tap Find “search” (where search is the search text you 
entered). Safari highlights the first instance of the search term. 
The On This Page message now appears at the bottom of the 
results screen, as shown in Figure 4-10.
Figure 4-9.  In the Search Engine screen, tap the search engine you want to use as the 
default in Safari

Chapter 4 ■ Resolving Web Issues
44
	
6.	
Tap the down-pointing arrow to cycle forward through the 
instances of the search term that appear on the page. Note that 
you can also cycle backward through the results by tapping the 
up-pointing arrow. Also, when you tap the down-pointing arrow 
after the last result appears, Safari returns you to the first result.
	
7.	
When you’re finished with the search, tap Done.
You Want to Search the Web Using Voice Commands
You can use Safari to type search queries either directly into the search box or by 
navigating to a search engine site. However, these days typing suddenly seems like such 
a quaint pastime thanks to the voice-recognition prowess of the Siri app. So why type a 
search query when you can just tell Siri what you’re looking for?
Solution: Launch Siri by pressing and holding the Home button (or pressing and holding 
the Mic button of the device headphones, or the equivalent button on a Bluetooth 
headset). Here are some general tips for web searching with Siri:
• 
Searching the entire web. Say “Search the web for topic,” where 
topic is your search criteria.
• 
Searching Wikipedia. Say “Search Wikipedia for topic,” where 
topic is the subject you want to look up.
• 
Searching with a particular search engine. Say “Engine topic,” 
where Engine is the name of the search engine, such as Google or 
Bing (although not DuckDuckGo, for some reason), and topic is 
your search criteria.
Figure 4-10.  The On This Page message tells you the number of matches that appear on 
the current web page

Chapter 4 ■ Resolving Web Issues
45
Siri also understands commands related to searching for businesses and restaurants 
through its partnership with Yelp. To look for businesses and restaurants using Siri, the 
general syntax to use is the following (although, as usual with Siri, you don’t have to be 
too rigid about this):
“Find (or Look for) something somewhere.”
Here, the something part can be the name of a business (such as “Starbucks”), a type 
of business (such as “gas station”), a type of restaurant (such as “Thai restaurants”), or 
a generic product (such as “coffee”). The somewhere part can be something relative to 
your current location (such as “around here” or “near me” or “within walking distance”) 
or a specific location (such as “in Indianapolis” or “in Broad Ripple”). Here are some 
examples:
• 
“Find a gas station within walking distance.”
• 
“Look for pizza restaurants in Indianapolis.”
• 
“Find coffee around here.”
• 
“Look for a grocery store near me.”
Note, too, that if you add a qualifier such as “good” or “best” before the something 
portion of the command, Siri returns the results organized by their Yelp ratings.

CHAPTER 5
Overcoming Email Glitches
These days, we have an impressive number of ways to communicate with each other: 
texting, SnapChatting, video calling, Facebook messaging, Twitter direct messaging, and 
so many more. These newfangled (more or less) communications technologies get all 
the press and all the glory, not surprisingly. But when it comes to day-to-day, bread-
and-butter communications, most of us fall back on good old email. It’s not sexy, it 
hasn’t changed all that much in a couple of decades, and whatever bells and whistles a 
developer adds to an email client are usually ignored. Email just gets the job done.
Or, I should say, email usually gets the job done. Like any technology, email suffers 
from its share of glitches and bugs, so you might find that you have trouble sending or 
receiving email messages using the iOS Mail app. The good news is that most of these 
problems are readily fixable and you get usually get Mail back on its feet in short order. To 
help you do that, this chapter offers a collection of the most common email complaints, 
as well as their solutions.
Troubleshooting Sending Email
Mail Uses the Wrong Account When Sending
When you add more than one email account, how does Mail decide which of those to use 
when you send a new message? It designates one of those accounts – specifically, the first 
account you added to the Mail app – as the default, and it then automatically uses that 
address as the sending account each time you compose a new message. It also uses that 
address as the default sending account when you when you share content such as a link, 
photo, or map via email.
■
■Note   Mail does not use the default account automatically when you reply to or forward 
a message. In those cases, Mail configures the reply or forward to be sent from the account 
to which the original message was addressed.

Chapter 5 ■ Overcoming Email Glitches
48
If the default account is the one you want to use to send a message, then this 
behavior isn’t a problem, but you might prefer to use one of your other accounts.
Solution: First, note that you’re not restricted to using the default account for every 
message. If you need to use a different account when sending a message, follow these 
steps:
	
1.	
In the Mail app, start a new message.
	
2.	
Tap the Cc/Bcc, From line in the New Message screen.
	
3.	
Tap the From line. Mail displays a list of the available email 
addresses, as shown in Figure 5-1.
	
4.	
Tap the address you want to use to send the message.
Changing the sending account as needed works well if you only have to use that 
technique occasionally, but it’s not something you’ll want to run through each time you 
send a message. If there’s a particular account that you prefer to use for sending all or 
most of the time, then you need to set up that account as the default. Here are the steps to 
follow:
	
1.	
On the Home screen, tap Settings. The Settings app appears.
	
2.	
Tap Mail to open the Mail screen. iOS displays the Mail 
screen.
Figure 5-1.  You can use the From list to select a different sending address

Chapter 5 ■ Overcoming Email Glitches
49
	
3.	
Near the bottom of the Mail section, tap Default Account. This 
opens the Default Account screen, which displays a list of your 
accounts. The current default account is shown with a check 
mark beside it.
	
4.	
Tap the account you want to use as the default. iOS places a 
check mark beside the account, as shown in Figure 5-2.
You Want to Prevent an Account from Receiving Email
There are many reasons why you might want Mail to prevent a particular account from 
receiving email temporarily:
• 
The Mail app checks for new messages at a regular interval, so 
if you have several accounts configured in Mail, this incessant 
checking can put quite a strain on your device battery. By 
preventing one or more accounts from receiving messages, you 
reduce that strain.
• 
An account might receive a large number of messages in a short 
time. Rather than wasting time and resources receiving all those 
messages on your device, you might prefer to prevent them from 
being received in iOS and then handle them in your regular email 
client.
• 
An account might receive one or more very large messages. 
Rather than subjecting your device to these behemoths, you 
might want to prevent them from being downloaded so you can 
process the messages more easily using your desktop or web 
email client.
Alternatively, you might want to never receive email on a particular account, but you 
still might want to work with that account’s other data, such as its calendars or contacts.
Figure 5-2.  In the Default Account screen, tap the account you want Mail to use as the 
default for sending messages

Chapter 5 ■ Overcoming Email Glitches
50
■
■Note   Turning off email while still retaining other types of data such as calendars and 
contacts only works for the following account types: iCloud, Exchange, Google, Yahoo!, AOL, 
and Outlook.com. You can’t do this with POP (Post Office Protocol) or IMAP (Internet Message 
Access Protocol) accounts.
Solution: First, I assume you still want to keep the account. That is, you either want 
to stop receiving messages on a particularly account temporarily, or you want to stop 
receiving email permanently but still want to receive other data. If neither of these 
is the case, then you probably want to delete the account, as described in the next 
section. Otherwise, you want to disable the account’s email receiving capability. Here’s 
how you do it:
	
1.	
On the Home screen, tap Settings to open the Settings app.
	
2.	
Tap Mail to open the Mail screen.
	
3.	
Tap the account you want to disable. iOS displays the 
account’s settings.
	
4.	
Depending on the type of account, use one of the following 
techniques to temporarily disable the account:
• 
For an iCloud, Exchange, Google, Yahoo!, AOL, or Outlook.com 
account, tap the Mail switch to Off, as shown in Figure 5-3.
• 
For a POP or IMAP account, tap the Account switch to Off.
When you’re ready to work with the account again, repeat these steps to tap the Mail 
switch or the Account switch back to On.
Figure 5-3.  For an iCloud, Exchange, Google, Yahoo!, AOL, or Outlook.com account, tap 
the Mail switch to Off

Chapter 5 ■ Overcoming Email Glitches
51
You No Longer Need an Account
An email account you no longer use is cluttering your Mail Inbox, taking up storage space, 
and wasting battery power with constant checks for new messages.
Solution: If don’t use an email account any longer, you should delete it. This will remove 
the account and its messages from Mail, free up some storage space, speed up sync times, 
and save battery power.
■
■Note   If you find that you can’t send email using a particular account, even after trying 
the troubleshooting steps found throughout this chapter, then one technique that often 
works is to delete the account and then add it back again.
Follow these steps to delete an account:
	
1.	
Open the Settings app.
	
2.	
Tap Mail to open the Mail screen.
	
3.	
Tap the account you want to delete. This opens the account’s 
settings.
	
4.	
At the bottom of the screen, tap Delete Account. iOS asks you 
to confirm.
	
5.	
Tap Delete, as shown in Figure 5-4. iOS removes the account.
You Want to Save an Unfinished Email Message
If you’re composing a message on your computer and decide to work on it later, your mail 
program stores the message as a draft that you can reopen any time. The Mail app doesn’t 
appear to have that option, so how can you save an unfinished message?
Figure 5-4.  Tap the account and then tap Delete Account to remove it from Mail

Chapter 5 ■ Overcoming Email Glitches
52
Solution: The Mail app doesn’t appear to offer the option of saving a draft of a message, 
but it does, albeit in a very unintuitive way. In the message window, tap Cancel and then 
tap Save Draft (see Figure 5-5). When you’re ready to resume editing, open the account in 
the Mailboxes screen, tap Drafts, and then tap your saved message.
Troubleshooting Outgoing Email Problems When Using a 
Third-Party Account
For security reasons, some Internet service providers (ISPs) insist that all their customers’ 
outgoing mail must be routed through the ISP’s SMTP (Simple Mail Transport Protocol) 
server. This usually isn’t a big deal if you’re using an email account maintained by the ISP, 
but it can lead to the following problems if you are using an account provided by a third 
party (such as your website host):
• 
Your ISP might block messages sent using the third-party account 
because it thinks you’re trying to relay the message through the 
ISP’s server (a technique often used by spammers).
• 
You might incur extra charges if your ISP allows only a certain 
amount of SMTP bandwidth per month or a certain number of 
sent messages, whereas the third-party account offers higher 
limits or no restrictions at all.
• 
You might have performance problems, with the ISP taking much 
longer to route messages than the third-party host.
Solution: To work around these problems, many third-party hosts offer access to their 
SMTP server via a port other than the standard port 25. For example, the iCloud SMTP 
server (smtp.icloud.com) also accepts connections on ports 465 and 587. Ask your mail 
hosting provider which port (or ports) they support.
Here’s how to configure an email account to use a nonstandard SMTP port:
	
1.	
On the Home screen, tap Settings. You see the Settings app.
	
2.	
Tap Mail. The Mail settings screen appears.
	
3.	
Tap the POP account you want to configure. The account’s 
settings screen appears.
	
4.	
Near the bottom of the screen, tap SMTP. iOS displays the SMTP screen.
Figure 5-5.  To save an unfinished message, tap Cancel and then tap Save Draft

5.	
In the Primary Server section, tap the server. iOS displays the 
server settings.
	
6.	
In the Outgoing Mail Server section, tap Server Port and then 
type the port number.
	
7.	
Tap Done.
■
■Note   You might also find you have trouble sending email over a cellular connection. To 
learn how to troubleshoot that problem, see Chapter 2’s “You Can send Email Over Wi-Fi But 
Not Over Cellular” section.
Mail Cannot Send POP Messages Using a Particular 
Account
When you send a POP message using Mail, you might find that the message either stays 
in the Outbox folder (meaning it never gets sent) or is never delivered (in which case, you 
might or might not receive a bounce message). There are many reasons why a message 
doesn’t get sent, but it usually boils down to one or more of the following misconfigured 
POP account settings.
• 
Using an incorrect SMTP host name.
• 
Using an incorrect user name or password.
• 
Not using SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encryption if your email 
host requires it (or, conversely, using SLL when your host does not 
require it).
• 
Not using authentication. To reduce spam, many ISPs now 
require SMTP authentication for outgoing mail, which means that 
you must log on to the SMTP server to confirm that you’re the 
person sending the mail (as opposed to some spammer spoofing 
your address). If your ISP requires authentication on outgoing 
messages, you need to configure your email account to provide 
the proper credentials.
• 
Using a server port that is not supported by the email host.
If you’re not too sure about any of this, check with your email host.

Chapter 5 ■ Overcoming Email Glitches
54
Solution: Follow these steps to configure your email account with the correct settings:
	
1.	
On the Home screen, tap Settings. iOS displays the Settings 
app.
	
2.	
Tap Mail. The Mail settings screen appears.
	
3.	
Tap the POP account you want to configure. The account’s 
settings screen appears.
	
4.	
Near the bottom of the screen, tap SMTP. iOS displays the 
SMTP screen.
	
5.	
In the Primary Server section, tap the server. iOS displays the 
server’s settings screen.
	
6.	
Check the values in the Host Name and User Name fields to 
ensure they’re correct.
	
7.	
Retype the correct password.
	
8.	
Tap the SSL switch to On if your host requires SSL; otherwise, 
tap this switch to Off.
	
9.	
Tap Authentication to open the Authentication screen, tap 
the type of authentication required by your host (usually 
Password), and then tap Back to return to the server settings 
screen.
	
10.	
Check that the Server Port setting is a port value supported by 
your host.
	
11.	
Tap Done.
You’re Having Trouble Sending Email Using Siri Voice 
Commands
You can use the Siri voice recognition app to check, compose, send, and reply to 
messages, all with simple voice commands. Tap and hold the Home button (or press and 
hold the Mic button of the device headphones, or the equivalent button on a Bluetooth 
headset) until Siri appears. Siri is handy, but you might have trouble getting it to do what 
you want.
Solution: Make sure you’re using commands that Siri recognizes.
To check for new email messages on your iCloud account, you need only say “Check 
email” (or just “Check mail”). You can also view a list of iCloud messages as follows:
• 
To display unread messages, say “Show new email.”
• 
To display messages from a particular person, say “Show email 
from name,” where name is the name of the sender.

Chapter 5 ■ Overcoming Email Glitches
55
To start a new email message, Siri gives you several options:
• 
To create a new message addressed to a particular person, say 
“Email name,” where name is the name of the recipient. This 
name can be a name from your Contacts list or someone with a 
defined relationship, such as “Mom” or “my brother.”
• 
To create a new message with a particular subject line, say “Email 
name about subject,” where name defines the recipient, and 
subject is the subject line text.
• 
To create a new message and also specify the body text, say “Email 
name about subject and say text,” where name is the recipient, 
subject is the subject line, and text is the message body text.
In each case, Siri creates the new message, displays it, and then asks if you want to 
send it. If you do, you can either say “Send” or tap the Send button.
If you have a message displayed, you can send back a response by saying “Reply.” If 
you want to add some text to the response, say “Reply text,” where text is your response.
You can also use Siri within Mail to dictate a message. When you tap inside the body 
of a new message, the keyboard that appears shows a Mic icon beside the spacebar. Tap 
the Mic icon and then start dictating. Here are some notes:
• 
For punctuation, you can say the name of the mark you need, 
such as “comma” (,), “semicolon” (;), “colon” (:), “period” or “full 
stop” (.), “question mark” (?), “exclamation point” (!), “dash” (-), 
or “at sign” (@).
• 
You can enclose text in parentheses by saying “open parenthesis,” 
then the text, and then “close parenthesis.”
• 
To surround text with quotation marks, say “open quote,” then the 
text, then “close quote.”
• 
To render a word in all uppercase letters, say “all caps” and then 
say the word.
• 
To start a new paragraph, say “new line.”
• 
You can have some fun by saying “smiley face” for :-), “wink face” 
for ;-), and “frown face” for :-(.
When you’re finished, tap Done.

Troubleshooting Receiving Email
You Receive Email on Your Device, but Not on Your 
Computer
If you need to check email on multiple devices, you first need to understand how POP 
email messages are delivered over the Internet. (This does not apply to iCloud, Gmail, 
and other services that use IMAP.) When someone sends you a message, it doesn’t come 
directly to your iOS device or computer. Instead, it goes to the server that your Internet 
service provider (or your company) has set up to handle incoming messages. When you 
ask Mail to check for new messages, it communicates with the POP server to see if any 
messages are waiting in your account. If so, Mail downloads those messages and then 
instructs the server to delete the copies of the messages stored on the server. So if you 
retrieve messages on your iOS device, they will no longer by available to download to 
your computer.
Solution: You need to configure Mail so that it leaves a copy of the messages on the 
POP server after you download them. That way, the messages are still available when 
you check messages using another device. Note that this is the default behavior for POP 
accounts that you add to iOS. Therefore, if you find that you’re receiving messages on 
your iOS device but not elsewhere, then you need to follow these steps to prevent iOS 
from deleting messages from the server:
	
1.	
On the Home screen, tap Settings.
	
2.	
Tap Mail to open the Mail screen to display the Mail screen.
	
3.	
Tap the POP account you want to configure. The account’s 
settings screen appears.
	
4.	
Near the bottom of the screen, tap Advanced. iOS displays the 
Advanced screen.
	
5.	
Tap Delete from server. The Delete from server screen 
appears.
	
6.	
Tap Never, as shown in Figure 5-6.
Figure 5-6.  To ensure that Mail leaves a copy of downloaded messages on the POP server, 
tap Never in the Delete from server screen

You Receive a Great Deal of Spam
It’s sad to say that there are no longer any spam-free zones. If you have an Internet-
based email account, you get spam. End of story. In fact, you most likely don’t get only 
one or two spams a day, but more like one or two dozen. That’s not surprising because 
spam now accounts for the majority of the billions of messages sent every day, and on 
some days it even accounts for 90 percent of all sent messages! ISPs and email hosting 
companies are getting better at filtering out spam before it gets to you, but these defenses 
remain sadly incomplete.
Solution: It’s no longer possible to avoid spam, but there are some things you can do to 
minimize how much of it you have to wade through each day:
• 
Never type your actual email address in a forum or blog post 
comment. The most common method that spammers use to 
gather addresses is to harvest them from online posts. One 
common tactic you can use is to alter your email address by 
adding text that invalidates the address, but is still obvious for 
other people to figure out. Here’s an example: yourname@
yourisp.remove-this-to-email-me.com.
• 
Consider creating an email address to use exclusively for logins, 
mailing lists, newsletters, and other online uses. That address will 
likely attract spam eventually, but it’s better than compromising 
your main email address.
• 
If you see a message in your Inbox that you’re sure is spam, 
don’t tap it. Doing so can sometimes notify the spammer that 
you’ve opened the message, which confirms that your address is 
legitimate. You can prevent this by disabling remote images, as 
described in the next section.
■
■Tip   If you see a definite spam message in your Inbox, you can delete it without tapping 
it. Either perform a short swipe left on the message and then tap Trash, or perform a long 
swipe left on the message until it disappears from the Inbox. 
• 
Never respond to spam. Don’t respond, even to an address within 
the spam that claims to be a “removal” address. By responding 
to the spam, you prove that your address is legitimate, so you just 
end up getting more spam.
• 
If you have an email address that gets a ton of spam, consider 
declaring “spam bankruptcy” and deleting the account, not only 
from your iOS device, but also from your ISP or mail host.

You Want to Disable Remote Images in Messages
A web bug is an image that resides on a remote server and is added to a HTML-formatted 
email message by referencing an address on the remote server. When you open the 
message, Mail uses the address to download the image for display within the message. 
That sounds harmless enough, but if the message is junk email, it’s likely that the address 
also contains either your email address or a code that points to your email address. So 
when the remote server gets a request to load the image, it knows not only that you’ve 
opened the message but also that your email address is legitimate. So, not surprisingly, 
spammers use web bugs all the time because, for them, valid email addresses are a form 
of gold.
Solution: The iOS Mail app displays remote images by default. To disable remote images, 
follow these steps:
	
1.	
On the Home screen, tap Settings. iOS opens the Settings app.
	
2.	
Tap Mail to open the Mail settings screen.
	
3.	
Tap the Load Remote Images switch to Off, as shown in 
Figure 5-7. Mail saves the setting and no longer displays 
remote images – particularly web bugs – in your email 
messages.
■
■Tip   To display remote images in a non-spam message, tap the message and then tap 
Load All Images.
You No Longer Want Mail to Organize  
Your Messages by Thread
In the Mail app, your messages get grouped by thread, which means the original message 
and all the replies you’ve received are grouped together in the account’s Inbox folder.
Organizing messages by thread is usually convenient, but not always. For example,  
if your using an iPhone or iPod touch, sometimes you might view your messages and 
scroll through them by tapping the Next (right-pointing arrow) and Previous  
Figure 5-7.  To squash web bugs, tap the Load Remote Images switch to Off

Chapter 5 ■ Overcoming Email Glitches
59
(left-pointing arrow) buttons. When you come to a thread, Mail jumps into the thread 
and you then scroll through each message in the thread, which can be a real hassle if the 
thread contains a large number of replies.
Solution: If you find that threads are more hassle than they’re worth, you can follow these 
steps to configure Mail to no longer organize messages by thread:
	
1.	
On the Home screen, tap Settings. iOS opens the Settings app.
	
2.	
Tap Mail to open the Mail settings screen.
	
3.	
Tap the Organize By Thread switch to Off.
Deleted Messages Are Being Removed  
from the Trash Folder
When you delete a message, Mail doesn’t remove the message completely, but only 
transfers it to the account’s Trash folder. This is useful because if you delete a message 
by accident, you can recover the message by locating it in the Trash folder and moving 
it back to the Inbox (or its original folder). That is, you can recover the message if it still 
exists in the Trash folder. Unfortunately, Mail configures each account to automatically 
delete items from the Trash folder after one week.
Solution: Follow these steps to control when Mail deletes messages from the Trash folder:
	
1.	
On the Home screen, tap Settings to display the Settings app.
	
2.	
Tap Mail to display the Mail settings screen.
	
3.	
Tap the account you want to configure.
	
4.	
Display the account’s advanced mail options:
• 
For an iCloud account, tap Mail and then tap Advanced.
• 
For a POP account, tap Advanced.
• 
For most other account types, tap Account and then tap 
Advanced.
	
5.	
Tap Remove to open the Remove screen.
	
6.	
Tap Never to prevent Mail from removing messages 
automatically from the account’s Trash folder, as shown in 
Figure 5-8.

Chapter 5 ■ Overcoming Email Glitches
60
You Do Not See the All Inboxes Folder
If you have multiple accounts set up in iOS, Mail includes a folder named All Inboxes that 
shows a combined list of all the messages you’ve received on your accounts. This folder 
sometimes disappears after upgrading iOS.
Solution: Follow these steps to restore the All Inboxes folder to the Mail interface:
	
1.	
In the Mail app, display the Mailboxes screen.
	
2.	
Tap Edit.
	
3.	
Tap the All Inboxes item to activate it, as shown in Figure 5-9.
	
4.	
Tap Done.

CHAPTER 6
Fixing Phone Troubles
Most of the chapters in this book focus on the data-related features of iOS and its devices: 
Wi-Fi, apps, the Web, email, photos, and so on. That’s apt because our iOS devices are 
computers, after all, so it makes sense to concentrate on troubleshooting computing 
tasks. But the iPhone is different. Sure, it makes an excellent mobile computer, but at 
its heart it’s also a mobile phone. And while it’s true that the phone call is beginning to 
feel more than a little like an anachronism, the “phone” part of this smartphone is still 
used by almost every iPhone owner, even those in their twenties. (A recent Pew Research 
poll found that 93 percent of smartphone owners aged 18 to 29 had used either voice or 
video calling.) The phone call’s enduring appeal comes from a number of factors: it’s 
immediate (assuming the other person picks up!), intimate, and efficient. But all this only 
applies if the iPhone’s calling features are working properly and you know how to get the 
most out of them. This chapter looks at a few common calling concerns and shows you 
how to fix them or work around them.
Troubleshooting Incoming Calls
You Need to Silence an Incoming Call
When a call comes in, there might be times when you can’t answer the phone right away. 
For example, if you’re in a meeting, you might prefer to leave the room before answering 
the call to disturb the other meeting participants as little as possible. Of course, if the 
phone keeps ringing while you’re making your way to the door, then you’re still disturbing 
everyone.
Solution: As soon as you hear the incoming call, press the Sleep/Wake button once. This 
temporarily turns off the ringer, meaning that you still have the standard number of rings 
to answer, should you decide to. If you don’t answer, your iPhone sends the call to your 
voicemail.

Chapter 6 ■ Fixing Phone Troubles
62
You Can’t Adjust the Volume of the Ringer Using the 
Volume Buttons
Rather than silencing an incoming call you might prefer just to turn the volume down 
a bit. However, when you press the Volume Down button on the side of the device, the 
ringer stays at the same volume.
Solution: If you can't turn the volume of the ringer up or down using the volume buttons, 
it means this feature has been disabled. To turn it back on, follow these steps:
	
1.	
Open the Settings app.
	
2.	
Tap Sounds.
	
3.	
Tap the Change with Buttons switch to On, as shown in 
Figure 6-1.
Figure 6-1.  Tap the Change with Buttons switch to On to control the ringer volume using 
the iPhone's volume buttons
■
■Caution   On the other hand, locking the ringer volume is a good idea because it 
prevents one of the major iPhone frustrations: missing a call because the ringer volume has 
been muted accidentally (for example, by your iPhone getting jostled in a purse or pocket).

Chapter 6 ■ Fixing Phone Troubles
63
You Want to Send an Incoming Call Directly to Voicemail
You receive a phone call on your iPhone, but you can't answer it right now. However, you 
also don’t want to disturb your neighbors by letting the phone ring until voicemail kicks in.
Solution: Use any of the following techniques:
• 
If the phone isn’t locked, tap the red Decline button on the 
touchscreen.
• 
If you’re using the EarPods, squeeze and hold the center button 
for two seconds.
• 
Press the Sleep/Wake button twice in quick succession.
Whichever method you use, iOS sends the call directly to voicemail. Note, however, 
that if you change your mind, you won’t be able to answer the call.
You want to Be Able to Answer a Call Using  
Another Device
It has happened to all of us: you’re in one room when you hear your iPhone ring in 
another room, and a mad dash ensues to try and answer the call before it goes to 
voicemail. It would be nice if that mad dash didn’t have to take place and you could 
just answer the call using a handy iPad or Mac that’s on the same Wi-Fi network as your 
iPhone.
Solution: iOS supports a feature that enables you to answer incoming calls on your other 
devices, including iPads, iPhones, and even Macs. To ensure this feature is activated and 
to control which devices you can use to answer calls, follow these steps:
	
1.	
Open the Settings app, and then tap Phone to display the 
Phone settings.
	
2.	
Tap Calls on Other Devices. If you don’t see this setting, see 
the next problem.
	
3.	
Make sure the Allow Calls on Other Devices switch is set to 
On, as shown in Figure 6-2.
	
4.	
In the list of devices, tap the switch to On for each device that 
you want to use to answer calls.

Chapter 6 ■ Fixing Phone Troubles
64
You Can’t Access the Calls on Other Devices Setting
If you want to configure your iPhone to allow calls to appear on other iOS devices, you 
might find that the setting doesn’t appear when you tap Phone in the Settings app.
Solution: You must be signed in to both iCloud and FaceTime using the same Apple ID before 
the Calls on Other Devices setting will appear. Follow these steps to sign in to these services:
	
1.	
Open the Settings app.
	
2.	
Tap iCloud.
	
3.	
If you are not already signed in to iCloud, type your Apple ID 
email address and password, then tap Sign In.
	
4.	
Tap Settings to return to the main Settings screen.
	
5.	
Tap FaceTime to open the FaceTime settings.
	
6.	
Tap the FaceTime switch to On.
	
7.	
If you are not signed in, tap Use your Apple ID for FaceTime, type 
your Apple ID email address and password, then tap Sign In.
You Want to Respond to a Call without Answering It
Earlier in this chapter you learned how to send an unwanted call directly to voicemail. 
That’s great for calls you want to ignore, but there are plenty of situations where you can’t 
answer the phone, but you also don’t want to ignore the caller. For example, if you’re 
expecting a call but get dragged into a meeting in the meantime, it would be rude to still 
answer the call when it comes in, but if you just send the call to voicemail your caller 
might wonder what’s going on. Similarly, you might be a bit late for an appointment, and 
on your way there you see a call come in from the person you’re meeting. Again, it might 
not be convenient to answer the call, but letting voicemail handle it might lead your caller 
to wonder if you’re going to show up for the meeting.
Figure 6-2.  Tap the Allow Calls on Other Devices switch to On, then tap the switch to On 
beside each device you want to use to answer calls

Chapter 6 ■ Fixing Phone Troubles
65
Solution: iOS offers a feature that gives you an easy way to handle these sticky phone 
situations. It’s called Respond with Text and it enables you to simultaneously decline a 
call and send the caller a prefab text message. That way, you avoid a voice conversation 
(which, depending on your current situation, might be rude or inconvenient), but you 
give the caller some feedback.
By default, Respond with Text comes with three ready-to-send messages:
Sorry, I can’t talk right now.
I’m on my way.
Can l call you later?
There’s also an option to send a custom message if none of these is quite right. Here’s 
how to decline an incoming call and send the caller a text message:
	
1.	
When the call comes in, tap Message, shown in Figure 6-3. Your 
iPhone displays a button for each of the prefab text messages.
■
■Note   You must have call display on your phone plan to see the Message button.
Figure 6-3.  Tap Message to reply to the caller with a text message

Chapter 6 ■ Fixing Phone Troubles
66
	
2.	
Tap the reply you want to send. If you want to send a different 
message, tap Custom, type your message, and then tap Send.
The caller sees User Busy in the Phone app and then receives a text message.
■
■Note   If you’re not all that fond of the default replies, you can forge your own. Tap 
Settings, tap Phone, tap Respond with Text, and then use the three text boxes to type your 
own messages.
You Want to Set a Reminder to Return a Phone Call
The Respond with Text feature is a handy trick to have up your iPhone sleeve, but it 
suffers from the same problem that plagues straight-up declining a call: if you want to talk 
to that person later, you have to remember to call back.
Solution: You could use the Reminders app to nudge yourself in an hour (or whenever) 
to make the return call. Fortunately, however, you don’t need to perform that extra step 
because you can get the Phone app to do it for you. The Phone app has a feature that 
lets you decline a call and automatically create a callback reminder. You can set up the 
reminder to fire in one hour or when you leave your current location.
Here’s how to decline an incoming call and set a callback reminder:
	
1.	
When the call comes in, tap Remind Me (see Figure 6-3, 
earlier). Your iPhone displays the callback reminder options 
shown in Figure 6-4.
Figure 6-4.  When a call comes in, tap Remind Me to see the reminder options shown here

Chapter 6 ■ Fixing Phone Troubles
67
	
2.	
Tap the type of reminder you want to set:
• 
When I leave. Tap this option to set a location-based 
reminder that triggers when you leave your current location.
• 
In 1 hour. Tap this option to set a time-based reminder.
■
■Tip   If you don’t see the When I leave reminder option, you need to turn on Location 
Services.
You Only Want to Allow Calls from Certain People
Rather than declining all incoming calls, you might be in a situation where you want to 
decline all calls except for those from a particular person or group.
Solution: You can do this by activating the Do Not Disturb feature and configuring it to 
allow calls from only the people you want to talk with.
This part of Do Not Disturb works with groups of people, not individuals. So your 
first task is to create or configure a group that consists of the people you want to allow to 
call you. You have two choices:
• 
In the Phone app, add each person to the Favorites list. Tap 
Contacts and then, for each person, tap the contact, tap Add to 
Favorites, and then tap Call. If the person has multiple numbers, 
tap the number you want to use as a favorite.
• 
Create a Contacts app group for the people you want to allow. 
Note, however, that the Contacts app doesn’t offer a feature for 
creating groups. Instead, you need to sign into icloud.com, open 
Contacts, and then click the Add (+) button at the bottom of the 
Groups pane.
With your group set up, follow these steps to configure Do Not Disturb to allow calls 
only from the group:
	
1.	
Tap Settings to open the Settings app.
	
2.	
Tap Do Not Disturb. The Do Not Disturb screen appears.
	
3.	
Tap the Manual switch to On to activate Do Not Disturb.

Chapter 6 ■ Fixing Phone Troubles
68
	
4.	
Tap Allow Calls From to open the Allow Calls From screen, 
shown in Figure 6-5.
	
5.	
Either tap Favorites or tap a contact group.
iOS will now allow a call through only if the caller is in the group you chose. When 
you want to accept all calls again, follow steps 1 to 3 to set the Manual switch to Off and 
deactivate Do Not Disturb. (Alternatively, if you want to keep the other Do Not Disturb 
features in place, follow steps 1 to 4 and then tap Everyone.)
You Don’t Want to See Info about Other Calls While 
You’re on a Call
If you’re already on a call and another one comes in, your iPhone springs into action 
and displays the person’s name or number, as well as three options: Decline Incoming 
Call, Answer & Hold Current Call, and Answer & End Current Call. This is part of the call 
waiting feature on your iPhone, and it’s great if you’re expecting an important call or if 
you want to add the caller to a conference call that you’ve set up. (Note that you only see 
the call waiting info if you have this feature as part of your cellular plan.)
However, the rest of the time you might just find it annoying and intrusive (and 
anyone you put on hold or hang up on to take the new call probably finds it rude and 
insulting).
Figure 6-5.  Use the Allow Calls From screen to choose the group that is allowed to call you 
while Do Not Disturb is activated

Chapter 6 ■ Fixing Phone Troubles
69
Solution: You can turn off call waiting by following these steps:
	
1.	
On the Home screen, tap Settings. The Settings app appears.
	
2.	
Tap Phone. The Phone screen appears.
	
3.	
Tap Call Waiting. The Call Waiting screen appears.
	
4.	
Tap the Call Waiting switch to Off, as shown in Figure 6-6. 
Your iPhone disables call waiting.
You are Receiving Unwelcome Calls
Using your iPhone is a blast until you get your first call from a telemarketer, cold-calling 
salesperson, or someone similarly annoying. You might also find that you’re getting 
unwanted calls from an old flame, an old schoolmate, or anyone else you used to know 
but no longer want to. One-time calls you can handle, but if you receive unwelcome calls 
from a person or company regularly, your iPhone becomes a lot less fun.
Solution: iOS offers a call-blocking feature that prevents specified phone numbers from 
calling you. Follow these steps to block a number that has recently called you:
	
1.	
Open the Phone app.
	
2.	
Tap the Recents icon in the menu bar.
	
3.	
Tap the blue Info button to the right of the phone number or 
person you want to block.
	
4.	
Tap Block this Caller. The Phone app asks you to confirm.
	
5.	
Tap Block Contact.
If the person you want to block isn’t in the Phone app’s Recents list, but they are in 
your Contacts list, follow these steps to block that person:
	
1.	
Open the Phone app.
	
2.	
Tap the Contacts icon in the menu bar.
	
3.	
Tap the contact you want to block.
	
4.	
Tap Block this Caller. The Phone app asks you to confirm.
	
5.	
Tap Block Contact.

■
■Note   To remove a person or number from the blocked list, open Settings, tap Phone, 
tap Call Blocking and Identification, and then tap Edit. Tap the red Delete icon to the left of 
the name or number, then tap Delete.
You Prefer to Answer iPhone Calls on Another Number
What do you do about incoming calls if you can’t use your iPhone for a while? For 
example, if you’re going on a flight, you must either turn off your iPhone or put it in 
Airplane mode so incoming calls won’t go through. Similarly, if you have to return your 
iPhone to Apple for repairs or battery replacement, the phone won’t be available if 
anyone tries to call you, so everything goes to voicemail.
Solution: For these and other situations where your iPhone can’t accept incoming calls, 
you can work around the problem by having your calls forwarded to another number, 
such as your work or home number. Note that the availability of this feature depends on 
whether your cellular provider supports it.
Here’s how it’s done:
	
1.	
On the Home screen, tap Settings. The Settings app appears.
	
2.	
Tap Phone. The Phone screen appears.
	
3.	
Tap Call Forwarding. The Call Forwarding screen appears.
	
4.	
Tap the Call Forwarding switch to On. Your iPhone displays 
the Forward To screen.
	
5.	
Tap the phone number to use for the forwarded calls.
	
6.	
Tap Back to return to the Call Forwarding screen. Figure 6-7 
shows the Call Forwarding screen set up to forward calls. In 
the status bar at the top of the screen, note the little Phone 
icon with an arrow that appears to the left of the time to let 
you know that call forwarding is on.
Figure 6-7.  Activate call forwarding to have your iPhone calls forwarded to another 
number

Troubleshooting Outgoing Calls
You Want to Make a Call, but You Have Only a Few 
Minutes Left on Your Plan
If you’re getting low on minutes with your cellular plan, the last thing you want to do is go 
beyond your time because those extra minutes are usually quite expensive.
Solution: You might still be able to make a call without using up what little time you have 
left. That’s because iOS supports Wi-Fi calling, which enables you to place a call using 
a Wi-Fi Internet connection instead of a cellular connection. Check with your cellular 
provider to see if it supports Wi-Fi calling. If so, then you should be able to follow these 
steps to enable Wi-Fi calling on your iPhone:
	
1.	
On the Home screen, tap Settings. The Settings app appears.
	
2.	
Tap Phone. The Phone screen appears.
	
3.	
Tap Wi-Fi Calling. The Wi-Fi Calling screen appears.
	
4.	
Tap the Wi-Fi Calling on This iPhone switch to On, as shown 
in Figure 6-8. iOS asks you to confirm.
	
5.	
Tap Enable.
You Want to Include Extensions or Menu Options in 
Phone Numbers
If you’re calling a family member or friend at work, or if you’re phoning a particular 
department or person in a company, chances are you have to dial an extension after the 
main number connects. Similarly, many businesses require you to negotiate a series of 
menus to get information or connect with a particular employee or section (“Press 1 for 
Sales; press 2 for Customer Service,” and so on). This normally requires you to display the 
keyboard, listen for the prompts, enter the numbers, and repeat as necessary, which is 
inefficient.
Figure 6-8.  Tap the Enable Wi-Fi Calling on This iPhone switch to On to make calls over Wi-Fi

Chapter 6 ■ Fixing Phone Troubles
72
Solution: If you know the extension or phone menu sequence, you can program it into 
the number and have the Phone app do all the hard work for you. The Phone app can do 
either of the following:
• 
Pause. This option, which is represented by a comma (,) in 
the phone number, means that the Phone app dials the main 
number, waits for two seconds, then dials whatever extension or 
menu value that appears after the comma. You can add multiple 
commas to the number if you need a longer delay.
• 
Wait. This option, which is represented by a semicolon (;) in the 
phone number, means that the Phone app dials just the main 
number and also displays a button labeled Dial “extension,” where 
extension is whatever digits appear after the semicolon. When the 
phone system prompts you to enter the extension, you tap the 
Dial button.
You can set these up in two ways:
• 
Contacts list. When you’re entering a phone number using the 
Contacts list, type the full number and then tap the +*# key that 
appears in the lower left corner of the onscreen keyboard. This 
temporarily adds two new keys: pause and wait. Tap pause to add 
a comma, then tap the extension or menu value, and repeat as 
needed; tap wait to add a semicolon, and then tap the extension.
• 
Keypad. Using the keypad in the Phone app, type the full number. 
To add a comma to tell the Phone app to pause, tap and hold the * 
key until a comma appears, then tap the extension or menu value; 
to add a semicolon to tell the Phone app to wait, tap and hold the 
# key until a semicolon appears, then tap the extension.
You Don’t Want to Be Identified When Making a Call
Although people often think that hiding one’s calling identity is a feature only needed by 
miscreants and others up to no good, there are many legitimate reasons why someone 
might not want her identity to be revealed when making a call. Connecting with a crisis 
hotline, acting as a whistleblower, revealing or seeking sensitive information are all 
scenarios where privacy is valued, even required.
Solution: You can configure your device not to show your caller ID, assuming that feature 
is supported by your cellular provider. Here are the steps to follow:
	
1.	
Open the Settings app.
	
2.	
Tap Phone.
	
3.	
Tap Show My Caller ID.
	
4.	
Tap the Show My Caller ID switch to Off, as shown in Figure 6-9.

Chapter 6 ■ Fixing Phone Troubles
73
■
■Caution   You might have good reasons to hide your caller ID when making a call, but 
just beware that many people automatically ignore incoming calls that don’t specify the 
caller’s name.
You Want to Put a Phone Call on Hold
When you’re on a call, you might want to put the caller on hold while you do something 
else. That’s a standard phone feature, but the Phone app doesn’t appear to offer it.
Solution: For reasons that remain mysterious, iOS hides this useful feature. To see it, 
press and hold the mute button. After several seconds, your iPhone replaces this icon 
with a hold icon and puts the caller on hold, as shown in Figure 6-10. To take the caller off 
hold, tap that icon.

CHAPTER 7
Solving Problems Related  
to Cameras and Photos
There’s a photography revolution underway, and the leader of this revolution isn’t a 
traditional camera company such as Canon or Nikon, but a computer company. I speak, 
of course, of Apple and its iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad. These devices have long had 
cameras, but in the last generation or two those cameras have become extremely good. 
Add the fact that we also carry these devices with us wherever we go, and you now 
have hundreds of millions of people walking around with high-quality photographic 
equipment at hand. That is revolutionary, to say the least. And while using the camera 
on an iOS device doesn’t come with the learning curve of, say, a digital single-lens reflex 
camera, it does require knowledge of how the camera works and some behind-the-scenes 
settings to get the most out of it and to overcome some pesky problems.
Troubleshooting Camera Problems
Many of Your Photos Are Blurry
The iOS device camera hardware is gradually getting better and the iPhone, iPad, and 
iPod touch generally take pretty good shots. However, probably the biggest problem most 
people have with iOS photos is blurry images, which are caused by not holding the device 
steady while taking the shot.
Solution: The iPhone 6 and later do offer optical image stabilization, which means the 
camera automatically compensates for subtle hand shaking and other small movements. 
But even if you have an earlier iPhone or some other iOS device, there are a few things 
you can do to minimize or hopefully eliminate blurred shots:
• 
Widen your stance to stabilize your body.
• 
Lean your shoulder (at least) or your entire side (at best) against 
any nearby object, such as a wall, doorframe, or car.

Chapter 7 ■ Solving Problems Related to Cameras and Photos 
76
• 
Place your free arm across your torso with your forearm parallel 
to the ground, then rest the elbow of your “shooting” arm (that is, 
the one holding the device) on the free arm, which should help 
steady your shooting arm.
• 
Hold your breath while taking the shot.
• 
Remember that your device takes the shot when you release 
the Shutter button, not when you press it. Therefore, keep your 
subject composed and yourself steadied as best you can until you 
lift your finger off the Shutter button.
■
■Note   You might be tempted to press and hold the Shutter button and release it only 
when you’re steady. Unfortunately, that technique no longer works because pressing and 
holding the Shutter button initiates burst mode, which takes photos at a rate of 10 per 
second. 
• 
After you release the Shutter button, keep the phone steady 
until the photo thumbnail appears in the lower-left corner of the 
screen. If you move while the device is finalizing the photo, you’ll 
blur the shot.
Keep some or all of these pointers in mind while shooting with your iOS device, and 
you’ll soon find that blurry photos are a thing of the past.
Your Low-Light Photos Are Often Too Dark,  
Grainy, or Blurry
Photos taken in low-light conditions are difficult because any camera requires light, and 
the less light the camera has to work with, the more likely the photos will turn out too 
dark, too grainy, or too blurry.
The iPhone 7 Plus comes with two cameras, one of which offers a lens with an 
aperture of f/1.8, compared to the f/2.2 lens in the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus. In the topsy-
turvy world of camera specs, a lower aperture number translates to a larger lens area – in 
this case, an f/1.8 lens offers 50 percent greater area than an f/2.2 lens. The greater the 
available lens area, the more light the camera can collect, so the better the low-light 
photos it can take.

Solution: If you don’t have an iPhone 7 Plus, you can still take steps to improve your low-
light photos. Here are some tips:
• 
Take advantage of any light source that’s available. If you’re 
outdoors, look for street lamps, brightly lit signs, or even a bright 
moon. If you’re indoors and it’s daytime, take your shots near a 
window. At night, turn on lamps and other light sources.
• 
Hold the device as steady as possible while shooting, particularly 
by using many of the same techniques I mentioned in the 
previous section. When the Camera app senses that there is low 
light available, it slows down the shutter speed – that is, keeps the 
shutter open longer – to allow more light to hit the lens. However, 
that slower shutter speed means it takes longer to expose the 
photo, so you’re more likely to get camera shake.
■
■Tip   For very dark conditions, consider investing in a tripod for your iOS device. This is 
the best way to ensure that the camera remains steady during long exposures. 
• 
Adjust the exposure level, which controls the overall brightness of 
the photo. In dark conditions, the Camera app will often set the 
exposure to compensate, which means increasing the exposure. 
Unfortunately, this usually means that brighter areas of the scene 
get overexposed and appear washed out. Similarly, a single bright 
object in the scene can cause the Camera app to reduce the 
exposure, which can cause shadows and other dark areas to be 
underexposed. To adjust the exposure, compose your shot and 
then tap the screen to set the focus. You can now drag up on the 
screen to increase exposure (make the image brighter), or drag 
down to decrease exposure (make the image darker).
• 
Take advantage of the flash. Many people don’t like to use the 
built-in camera flash because it can make subjects look washed 
out. But in very low-light conditions, you might not have any 
choice since the flash might be the only useful light source you 
have. The Camera app’s Flash feature is set on Auto by default, 
meaning that the app determines whether or not it needs to use 
the flash. You can leave it at that, or you can set the Flash to On 
so that the Camera app always uses it. In the Camera app, tap the 
Flash icon (the lightning bolt; see Figure 7-1) and then tap either 
Auto or On.
Figure 7-1.  Tap Flash and then tap the setting you want to use

Chapter 7 ■ Solving Problems Related to Cameras and Photos

• 
Shoot in black and white. Shadows and other darker parts of 
a low-light image will usually look grainy, but that grain really 
stands out when the photo is in color. You can improve the 
look of grainy parts of the photo by shooting in black and white 
instead of color. In the Camera app, tap the Filters icon (the three 
overlapping circles), and then tap one of the following filters (see 
Figure 7-2):
• 
Mono — This filter converts all the colors to shades of black 
and white, but does no other processing. This is a good all-
around filter for most low-light conditions.
• 
Tonal — This filter is the same as Mono, except that it also 
increases the brightness and contrast. This is a good filter to 
use when it’s quite dark or when there isn’t much contrast in 
the scene.
• 
Noir — This filter is the same as Mono, except that it also 
boosts a number of other levels, including the contrast, 
brilliance, and intensity. This can make some very 
dramatic photos, but you might find that some images look 
overprocessed.
When you’re done with your low-light shooting, be sure to remove the filter by 
tapping the Filters icon once again, and then tapping None.
■
■Tip   You can also apply one of the black and white filters to a photo you have already 
shot. Open the Photo using the Photos app; tap Edit (it’s the icon that looks like a set of 
three equalizer bars); tap Filters; and then tap Mono, Tonal, or Noir.
Figure 7-2.  To shoot your low-light photo in black and white, tap Filters and then tap 
either Mono, Tonal, or Noir

You Have Trouble Keeping the Focus or Exposure Set
The Camera app offers a feature called AutoFocus, which enables the camera to 
automatically focus on whatever subject is in the middle of the frame.
Alternatively, you can do this yourself by tapping the screen to set the focus and 
exposure. If the subject you want to focus on is not in the middle of the frame, you can 
tap the subject and the iOS device automatically moves the focus to that object. It also 
automatically adjusts the white balance and exposure. If the exposure seems off, you 
can drag up or down anywhere on the screen to increase or decrease, respectively, the 
brightness.
Most people rely on AutoFocus, which is certainly a handy feature, except when 
you’ve got the perfect shot lined up and AutoFocus kicks in and wrecks the focus or 
exposure (or both!).
Solution: To prevent this, compose your shot and then tap and hold on the person or 
object you want to focus on for about three seconds (or until the focus rectangle pulses). 
When you release your finger, you see AE/AF Lock (short for AutoExposure/AutoFocus) at 
the top of the screen, as shown in Figure 7-3. Your current focus and exposure settings are 
now locked, meaning they won’t change if you move the camera. To release the exposure 
and focus, tap the screen.
You Want to Include Yourself in a Photo Taken with the 
Rear Camera
The term selfie (that is, a photo that you take of yourself, possibly with a friend or two 
included) was named Oxford Dictionaries’ Word of the Year for 2013, which I’m sure 
isn’t even remotely shocking news to you. You only have to look around at any event or 
occasion to realize that each of us has become our favorite photo subject. To make selfies 
even easier to shoot, just switch to the front camera, which seems nearly tailor-made for 
taking selfies.
Figure 7-3.  To lock the exposure and focus, tap and hold the screen until you see AE/AF Lock

Chapter 7 ■ Solving Problems Related to Cameras and Photos 
80
I say “nearly” because the front camera method for taking selfies does come with a 
couple of drawbacks:
• 
The front camera is low resolution compared to the rear camera, 
and it doesn’t support flash.
• 
All shots must be taken more or less at arm’s length, which gives 
every such photo a characteristic “This is me taking a selfie” look.
Creative selfie-takers have worked around these limitations by using mirrors and 
other tricks, but iOS offers a simpler alternative: time delay. This feature tells the Camera 
to wait for several seconds after you tap the Shutter button before taking the photo. This 
means your photo-taking steps change as follows:
	
1.	
In the Camera app, use the Switch Camera icon (shown in 
Figure 7-4) to select the rear camera.
	
2.	
Tap the Time Delay button (shown in Figure 7-5) and then 
tap the number of seconds you want to use for the delay: 3 
seconds or 10 seconds.
	
3.	
Position your iOS device (on, say, a desk or chair) so that it’s 
pointing toward the background that you want to use in your 
selfie.
	
4.	
Tap Shutter.
	
5.	
Move into the frame before the shot is taken.
Note that the Camera app takes not one photo, but a burst of 11 photos. To choose 
which photo you want to keep, tap the photo thumbnail in the bottom left corner, tap the 
photo burst, tap Select, tap the photo you want to keep, tap Done, and then tap Keep Only 
1 Favorite.
Figure 7-4.  Use the Camera app's Switch Camera button to choose the rear camera
Figure 7-5.  In the Camera app's menu bar, tap the Time Delay icon

Chapter 7 ■ Solving Problems Related to Cameras and Photos 
81
■
■Tip   Burst mode isn’t only available when you’re taking time-delayed photos. You can 
snap a burst of photos any time you want by tapping and holding the Shutter button.
You Have Trouble Taking a Straight Photo
Although you’ll occasionally want to take a photo at a fun or interesting angle, most of 
the time our photos look their best when they’re straight. However, when you’re taking 
quick or casual shots, getting them straight can be a challenge. You can always straighten 
photos after you take them (see “A photo is not straight,” later in this chapter), but it’s 
better to get them straight right from the beginning.
Solution: A useful way to ensure your photos are straight is to display the Camera app’s 
grid, which divides the frame into nine rectangles (that is, a 3x3 grid) by displaying two 
horizontal and two vertical lines. These lines don’t show up in your photo, but you can 
use them to make sure your subject is aligned both horizontally and vertically. Follow 
these steps to activate the grid:
	
1.	
Open the Settings app.
	
2.	
Tap Photos & Camera.
	
3.	
Tap the Grid switch to On.
■
■Tip   The grid is also useful for composing pictures using the Rule of Thirds, where you 
place your subject on one of the grid lines (or on the intersection of two grid lines) instead of 
in the middle of the screen.
Troubleshooting Photo Problems
A Photo Has the Wrong Exposure or Similar Light 
Problems
Even if you take quite a bit of care setting up and taking your shot, you might still end up 
with a photo that is under- or overexposed, has shadows that are too dark or too light, 
or has poor overall contrast. Of course, most of our shots are taken quickly to capture a 
moment, so these on-the-fly photos are even more likely to suffer from light problems.

Chapter 7 ■ Solving Problems Related to Cameras and Photos 
82
Solution: The Photos app comes with an Enhance feature that can analyze a photo and 
apply several fixes automatically. Here’s how to use it:
	
1.	
In the Photos app, open the photo you want to fix.
	
2.	
Tap the photo to display the controls, if you don’t see them 
already.
	
3.	
Tap Edit, shown in Figure 7-6. The Photos app displays its 
editing tools.
	
4.	
Tap Enhance (the magic wand icon in the upper-right 
corner; see Figure 7-7). The Photos app adjusts the color and 
brightness.
	
5.	
Tap Done. The Photos app saves your changes.
■
■Note   If your photo edits have made the image worse, you can restore the original. 
Tap to display the controls (if needed), tap Edit, tap Revert, and when Photos asks you to 
confirm, tap Revert to Original.
If the Enhance feature didn’t improve your photo, or if you prefer a more detailed 
approach, the Photos app also offers editing tools that can help you solve specific 
problems related to light. It offers seven sliders that you can use to adjust the lighting in a 
photo:
• 
Brilliance. Use this slider to adjust the lighting of some parts of 
the photo, particularly by adjusting the lighting of the darker parts 
of the photo. If your photo is well exposed except for the darker 
parts, increase the brilliance.
• 
Exposure. Use this slider to set the overall lighting of the photo. 
If your entire photo is washed out because it’s too light, decrease 
the exposure to get a darker image; if your entire photo is muddy 
because it’s too dark, increase the exposure to get a lighter image.
Figure 7-7.  To apply automatic fixes to your photo, tap the Enhance icon
Figure 7-6.  In the Photos app’s menu bar, tap Edit to load the photo editing tools

Chapter 7 ■ Solving Problems Related to Cameras and Photos 
83
• 
Highlights. Use this slider to adjust how intense the brightest 
parts of the image appear. If your photo has one or more areas 
that are washed out because they’re too bright, reduce the 
Highlights value to counter that effect.
• 
Shadows. Use this slider to adjust how intense the darkest parts of 
the image appear. If your photo has one or more areas that show 
no detail because they’re too dark, reduce the Shadows value to 
try and bring back some of that detail.
• 
Brightness. Use this slider to adjust all the photo’s tones toward 
white or black. Unlike Brilliance, which mostly affects the darker 
parts of the photo, Brightness affects all the photo’s tones. If your 
photo is too dark, increase the brightness; if your photo is too 
light, decrease the brightness.
• 
Contrast. Use this slider to adjust the distribution of the photo’s 
tones. If the tones in your photo are starkly different, lower the 
contrast to make them more alike; if your photo is bland because 
the tones are all alike, increase the contrast to make the tones 
stand out.
• 
Black Point. Use this slider to set the limit for the blackest part 
of the image. A lower value means even the darkest parts of the 
image will appear gray, while a higher value means more of the 
photo’s dark patches will appear black.
■
■Note   Depending on your iOS device and the version of iOS on that device, you might 
not see all of these photo editing tools.
To adjust a photo’s lighting using these tools, follow these steps:

A Photo’s Colors Look Wrong
Your photo’s colors might end up looking off somehow. For example, they might lack 
intensity, they might look too similar, or the photo overall might look too blue or too red.
Solution: The Photos app offers several tools you can use to improve your photo’s colors. 
The easiest of these tools is the Enhance feature, which can adjust the photo’s colors 
automatically. To apply the Enhance tool, use the Photos app to open the photo you want 
to fix, tap the photo to display the controls (if you don’t see them), tap Edit (shown earlier 
in Figure 7-6), tap Enhance (shown earlier in Figure 7-7), and then tap Done.
If the Enhance feature didn’t improve your photo’s colors, or if you prefer a more detailed 
edit, the Photos app also offers editing tools that can help you solve specific problems related 
to color. There are three sliders that you can use to adjust the colors in a photo:
• 
Saturation. Use this slider to adjust the intensity of the photo’s 
colors. If your photo lacks dynamism, try increasing the 
saturation.
• 
Contrast. Use this slider to adjust the distribution of the photo’s 
color tones. If the colors all kind of blend together, increase the 
contrast to make the colors stand apart.
• 
Cast. Use this slider to adjust a photo that has too much red or too 
much blue.
To adjust a photo’s colors using these tools, follow these steps:
	
1.	
In the Photos app, open the photo you want to fix.
	
2.	
Tap the photo to display the controls, if you don’t see them 
already.
	
3.	
Tap Edit (pointed out earlier in Figure 7-6). The Photos app

You Think Your Black and White Photos  
Could Look Better
Earlier you learned that applying one of the iOS black and white photo filters — Mono, 
Tonal, or Noir — could improve you low-light images. Of course, you can also apply 
a black and white filter to any photo when you’re looking for that certain starkness, 
simplicity, or intensity that comes with black and white. Unfortunately, it’s sometimes 
just as likely that your black and white efforts will end up looking uninspired, bland, or 
messy.
Solution: It’s possible that you simply picked the wrong subject, since not all scenes 
are suitable for the black and white treatment. Assuming that’s not the case, however, 
you might be able to enhance your black and white photos by taking advantage of four 
settings in the Photos app’s B&W category:
• 
Intensity. Use this slider to adjust the intensity of those parts 
of the photo that were converted from color to black and white. 
If your black and white photo lacks punch, try increasing the 
intensity.
• 
Neutrals. Use this slider to adjust the intensity of those parts 
of the photo that were converted from white or a shade of gray. 
If those parts of your black and white aren’t prominent, try 
increasing the neutral value.
• 
Tone. Use this slider to adjust the overall intensity of the photo. If 
your black and white photo looks washed out, try increasing the 
tone.
• 
Grain. Use this slider to add graininess to your photo. If you want 
your photo to have a vintage look, try increasing the grain.

A Photo Contains One or More Instances of Red-Eye
When you use a flash to take a picture of one or more people or animals, in some cases 
the flash may reflect off the subjects’ retinas. The result is the common phenomenon of 
red-eye, where the subject’s pupils appear red instead of black.
Solution: If you have a photo on your iOS device where one or more people or animals 
have red-eye due to the camera flash, you can use the Photos app to remove it and give 
your subjects a more natural look. Here’s how:
	
1.	
In the Photos app, open the photo that contains the red-eye 
you want to remove.
	
2.	
Tap the photo to display the controls, if you don’t see them 
already.
	
3.	
Tap Edit (pointed out earlier in Figure 7-6). The Photos app 
displays its editing tools.
	
4.	
Tap Red-Eye, shown in Figure 7-13.
	
5.	
Tap the red-eye that you want to remove. The Photos app 
removes the red-eye.
	
6.	
Repeat Step 5 until you’ve removed all the red-eye in the 
photo.
	
7.	
Tap Done. The Photos app applies the changes to the photo.
A Photo Contains Elements You Want to Remove
When you frame a scene before taking a photo, you likely try to avoid certain elements 
that could detract from the final image, such as a light pole or the top of the fence over 
which you’re shooting. Despite your best efforts, you’ll find that it’s not uncommon to see 
unwanted parts of the scene in your photo.
Solution: When you have a photo containing elements that you do not want or need to 
see, you can often cut them out. This is called cropping and you can use the Photos app 
to do it. When you crop a photo, you specify a rectangular area of the image that you want 
to keep. The Photos app then discards everything outside of the rectangle. Cropping is a 
useful skill for removing extraneous elements that appear on or near the edges of a photo, 
but you can also use it to help you give prominence to the true subject of a photo.
Figure 7-13.  Tap the Red-Eye icon to display the Photos app's red-eye removal tool

Follow these steps to crop a photo:
	
1.	
In the Photos app, open the photo that you want to crop.
	
2.	
Tap the photo to display the controls, if you don’t see them 
already.
	
3.	
Tap Edit (pointed out earlier in Figure 7-6). The Photos app 
displays its editing tools.
	
4.	
Tap Crop & Straighten (shown in Figure 7-14). The Photos app 
displays a grid for cropping, as shown in Figure 7-15.
	
5.	
Tap and drag a corner of the grid to set the area you want to 
keep.
	
6.	
Tap Done. The Photos app applies the changes to the photo.

Chapter 7 ■ Solving Problems Related to Cameras and Photos 
90
■
■Tip   The fastest way to crop some photos is to tell the Photos app the dimensions you 
want to use for the resulting photo. Tap Aspect (pointed out in Figure 7-14), and then tap 
either a specific shape (Original or Square) or a specific ratio, such as 5:7 or 4:5. You then 
drag the photo (not the grid!) so the portion you want to keep is within the grid.
A Photo Is Not Straight
As you probably know from hard-won experience, getting an iPhone camera perfectly 
level when you take a shot is very difficult. It requires a lot of practice and a steady hand. 
(You can also activate the Camera app’s grid feature; see the section “You Have Trouble 
Taking a Straight Photo.”) Despite your best efforts, you might still end up with a photo 
that is not quite level.
Solution: To fix this problem, you can use the Photos app to rotate the photo clockwise 
or counterclockwise so that the subject appears straight. Follow these steps to crop and 
straighten a photo:
	
1.	
In the Photos app, open the photo that you want to straighten.
	
2.	
Tap the photo to display the controls, if you don’t see them 
already.
	
3.	
Tap Edit (pointed out earlier in Figure 7-6). The Photos app 
displays its editing tools.
	
4.	
Tap Crop & Straighten (see Figure 7-14). The Photos app 
displays the Straightening tool (the arc with the degree 
markings; see Figure 7-15).
	
5.	
Drag the Straightening tool left or right until the photo is level.
	
6.	
Tap Done. The Photos app applies the changes to the photo.
■
■Note   The Crop & Straighten feature also enables you to rotate a photo 90 degrees, say, 
from portrait to landscape. To do this, tap the Rotate icon (see Figure 7-14) until the photo is 
in the orientation you want.

CHAPTER 8
Protecting Your Device
The iPhone has only been around since 2007, and the iPad since 2010, but already these 
devices have become indispensable parts of many people's lives. That indispensability 
comes from the sheer versatility of these devices. In a typical day, you probably use your 
iOS device to surf the Web, exchange emails and text messages, make calls, manage 
your contacts and calendar, listen to music, play games, check the weather or the stock 
market, and a dozen other tasks large and small. However, that insanely great power 
and convenience come with a price: your iOS device is loaded with information about 
you. To be sure, most of that data is likely trivial or ephemeral, but much of it is private 
and sensitive. Losing your iOS device would be a major inconvenience, but someone 
else getting access to your information could lead to big problems. So, yes, the notion 
of protecting your iOS device might not sound like a troubleshooting topic. But taking 
steps to ensure that you can find your device if it gets lost, and that while your device 
is lost no one else can see or mess with your information, can be viewed as a form of 
preventative maintenance. And preventing trouble before it happens is the best type of 
troubleshooting.
Locking Your Device
When your iOS device is asleep, it's locked in the sense that tapping the touchscreen 
or pressing the volume controls does nothing. This sensible arrangement prevents 
accidental taps when the phone is in your pocket, or rattling around in your backpack 
or handbag. To unlock the device, you either press the Home button twice, or press the 
Sleep/Wake button and then the Home button. Just like that, you're back in business.
Unfortunately, this simple technique means that anyone else who gets his or her 
hands on your iOS device can also be quickly back in business – your business! If you 
have sensitive or confidential information on your device, or if you want to avoid digital 
joyrides that run up massive roaming or data charges, you need to truly lock your iOS 
device.

Chapter 8 ■ Protecting Your Device
92
You Want to Lock Your Device with a Passcode
In the same way that you "lock" your user account and your many online accounts with a 
password, you might prefer to lock your iOS device with something similar.
Solution: You can do that by specifying a passcode that must be entered before anyone 
can use the device. The default in iOS is a six-digit passcode, but you can change that to 
either a simple four-digit passcode, or to a custom code that is longer and more complex 
and uses any combination of numbers, letters, and symbols.
Follow these steps to set up your passcode:
	
1.	
On the Home screen, tap Settings. The Settings app appears.
	
2.	
Tap Touch ID & Passcode to open the Touch ID & Passcode 
screen. If your iOS device doesn't support Touch ID, tap 
Passcode, instead, to open the Passcode Lock screen.
	
3.	
Tap Turn Passcode On. The Set Passcode screen appears.
	
4.	
If you prefer to use something other than a six-digit passcode, 
tap Passcode Options and then tap the type of passcode you 
want to use (see Figure 8-1).
	
5.	
Tap your passcode. For security, the characters appear in the 
passcode box as dots.
	
6.	
If you're entering a custom passcode, tap Next. Your iOS 
device prompts you to reenter the passcode.
	
7.	
Tap your passcode again.
	
8.	
If you're entering a custom passcode, tap Done.
■
■Caution   You really, really need to remember your iOS device passcode. If you forget it, 
you're locked out of your own device. The only way to get back in is to use iTunes to restore 
the data and settings to your iOS device from an existing backup (as described in Chapter 1).
Figure 8-1.  iOS gives you several options for the type of passcode you want to use

Chapter 8 ■ Protecting Your Device
93
You Want to Guarantee That Your Data Won't Fall into 
Malicious Hands
If your iOS device falls into another person's hands, your passcode will prevent that 
person from accessing your data and apps. You might be wondering what happens when 
that person tries guessing the password:
• 
After six failed passcodes, iOS locks the device — that is, prevents 
any further passcode attempts — for one minute, as shown in

If your device contains extremely sensitive or private data, you might be concerned 
that someone could still somehow access the data.
Solution: You can configure your iOS device to not only lock completely after the tenth 
failed passcode attempt, but also to erase all of its data. Here's how to set this up:
	
1.	
On the Home screen, tap Settings. The Settings app appears.
	
2.	
Tap Touch ID & Passcode. If your iOS device doesn't support 
Touch ID, tap Passcode, instead. iOS prompts you to enter 
your passcode.
	
3.	
Type your passcode and, if you're using a custom passcode, 
tap Done.
	
4.	
Tap the Erase Data switch to On. iOS asks you to confirm that 
you want to enable this feature.
	
5.	
Tap Enable. iOS enables Erase Data, as shown in Figure 8-3.
You Need to Make an Emergency Call While Your iPhone 
Is Locked
If an emergency arises and you need to make a call for help, you probably don't want to 
mess around with entering a passcode. Similarly, if something happens to you, another 
person who doesn't know your passcode may need to use your iPhone device to call for 
assistance.
Solution: In both cases, you can temporarily bypass the passcode by tapping the 
Emergency button on the Enter Passcode screen, shown in Figure 8-4.
Figure 8-3.  With Erase Data enabled, your iOS device automatically erases all of its data 
after it detects ten consecutive failed passcodes

Chapter 8 ■ Protecting Your Device

You Are Using a Passcode, but It Does Not Always Appear 
When You Unlock Your Device
By default, iOS puts the passcode into effect as soon as you lock your device, or as soon as 
the device locks itself after a period of inactivity. This is a sensible default because your 
passcode cannot protect your device if your device is unlocked. However, you might find 
that you can lock your device and iOS does not request the passcode when you unlock it.
Solution: This problem means that your iOS device has been configured to not require 
a passcode immediately after it has been locked. Some people set up the passcode to 
not kick in until the device has been locked for at least one minute to avoid having to 
constantly retype the passcode each the device locks itself due to inactivity. However, any 
delay in requiring the passcode makes your device that much less secure.
Figure 8-4.  In the Enter Passcode screen, you can tap Emergency to make an emergency 
phone call without unlocking the iPhone

Chapter 8 ■ Protecting Your Device
96
To ensure that the passcode is required as soon as your iOS device is locked, follow 
these steps:
	
1.	
On the Home screen, tap Settings. The Settings app appears.
	
2.	
Tap Touch ID & Passcode. If your iOS device doesn't support 
Touch ID, tap Passcode, instead. iOS prompts you to enter 
your passcode.
	
3.	
Type your passcode and, if you're using a custom passcode, 
tap Done.
	
4.	
Tap the Require Passcode to open the Require Passcode 
screen.
	
5.	
Tap Immediately, as shown in Figure 8-5.
You Want to Be Able to Unlock Your Device with Your 
Fingerprint
Protecting your iOS device with a passcode is just good sense in this age of so-called 
iCrime, where thieves routinely go "Apple picking" by snatching iPhones and other Apple 
devices from the unwary. With a passcode acting as a digital barrier between the crook 
and your iOS device, at least your personal data is safe from prying eyes. Yes, a passcode 
is a smart safety precaution, but it's not always a convenient one. First, having to tap that 
four (or more) character code many times during the day adds a small but nevertheless 
unwelcome annoyance to using the device. Second, because iOS, perhaps unwisely, 
highlights each character as you type your passcode, it's at least theoretically possible that 
some shoulder-surfing snoop could discern your code.
Figure 8-5.  To ensure that your passcode is always protecting your locked device, set the 
Require Passcode setting to Immediately

Chapter 8 ■ Protecting Your Device
97
Solution: If you have an iOS device that supports Touch ID — that is, if you have an 
iPhone 5s or later, an iPad Pro, an iPad Air 2, or an iPad mini 3 or later — you can take 
advantage of Touch ID, the fingerprint sensor built into the Home button of these iOS 
devices. By teaching the device your unique fingerprint, you can unlock your device 
merely by pressing the Home button. That's right: No more passcode tapping to get to 
your Home screen. As an added bonus, you can use the same fingerprint to approve 
purchases you make in the iTunes Store, the App Store, the iBooks Store, Apple Pay, and 
even some third-party apps, so you no longer have to enter your Apple ID password.
Here's how to set up Touch ID:
	
1.	
On the Home screen, tap Settings. The Settings app appears.
	
2.	
Tap Touch ID & Passcode and then type your passcode (if you 
have one) to open the Touch ID & Passcode screen.
	
3.	
Tap Add a Fingerprint. The Touch ID screen appears.
	
4.	
Lightly rest your thumb – or whatever finger you most often 
use to press the Home button when you're unlocking your iOS 
device – on the Home button.
	
5.	
Repeatedly lift and place your finger as Touch ID learns your 
fingerprint pattern.
	
6.	
When you see the Adjust Your Grip screen, tap Continue.
	
7.	
Once again, repeatedly lift and place your finger, this time 
emphasizing the edges of the finger.
	
8.	
When you see the Complete screen, tap Continue. If you 
haven't yet specified a passcode, your iOS device prompts you 
to do so now.
	
9.	
Tap your passcode and then tap it again when you're asked 
to confirm. Settings returns you to the Touch ID & Passcode 
screen.
	
10.	
To specify another fingerprint, repeat Steps 3 to 8.
You Can't Unlock Your iOS Device Using Your Fingerprint
Using Touch ID to unlock your iOS device is a major convenience, particularly if you'd 
otherwise have to enter a custom numeric or alphanumeric passcode that's fairly long. 
However, that convenience goes out the window if your iOS devices refuses to unlock 
when you apply your finger to the Home button.

Chapter 8 ■ Protecting Your Device
98
Solution: There are a number of reasons why you can't unlock your iOS device using your 
fingerprint:
• 
If your device is running iOS 10, remember that you might have 
to unlock the device by pressing the Home button with the digit 
that you saved as a fingerprint. On some devices, and in earlier 
versions of iOS, you unlocked the device by resting that finger on 
the Home button.
• 
Touch ID does not work if you've just restarted your device or 
if you haven't unlocked the device in the last 48 hours. In these 
cases, iOS forces you to use your passcode to unlock the device. 
iOS also insists on a passcode if your fingerprint isn't recognized 
after five consecutive tries.
• 
Make sure you're using a digit that has been added to iOS as a 
Touch ID fingerprint. It's not unusual for people to add, say, a 
right thumb or forefinger and then try to unlock the device using 
the left thumb or forefinger.
• 
Make sure your finger completely covers the Home button.
• 
Do not move your finger while it's on the Home button.
• 
Make sure your finger is clean and dry.
• 
Touch ID will sometimes fail if your finger is very cold, so try 
warming up the finger.
• 
Make sure your finger doesn't have any cuts or swelling.
• 
If you have recently been swimming or in the shower, your finger 
might have absorbed enough water to change its print (resulting 
in so-called raisin fingers). In this case, you have no choice but to 
wait until the fingerprint returns to its normal state.
• 
Use a soft cloth to clean the Home button.
• 
Make sure a case or other protective covering isn't obscuring part 
of the Home button.
• 
Make sure iOS is configured to unlock the device using a 
fingerprint. Run the Settings app, tap Touch ID & Passcode, then 
type your passcode to open the Touch ID & Passcode screen. 
Make sure the Device Unlock switch (where Device is iPhone or 
iPad) is set to On, as shown in Figure 8-6.

Chapter 8 ■ Protecting Your Device
99
If none of these solutions work for you, then you should delete all your fingerprints 
and add them again. Follow these steps to delete fingerprints:
	
1.	
On the Home screen, tap Settings. The Settings app appears.
	
2.	
Tap Touch ID & Passcode and then type your passcode to 
open the Touch ID & Passcode screen.
	
3.	
Tap the fingerprint you want to remove.
	
4.	
Tap Delete Fingerprint. iOS deletes the fingerprint and returns 
you to the Touch ID & Passcode screen.
	
5.	
Repeat steps 3 and 4 to remove all your fingerprints.
■
■Tip   An easier way to delete a fingerprint is to follow steps 1 and 2, swipe left on the 
fingerprint, and then tap the Delete button that appears.
You Don't Want to Forget Which Fingerprint You've 
Configured for Touch ID
If you don't use Touch ID that often, it's possible that you might forget which finger or 
fingers you've added as fingerprints in iOS.
Solution: To help you remember, you can provide a descriptive name for each fingerprint 
(such as "Right thumb" or "Left forefinger"). Here's how you do this:
	
1.	
On the Home screen, tap Settings. The Settings app appears.
	
2.	
Tap Touch ID & Passcode and then type your passcode to 
open the Touch ID & Passcode screen.
	
3.	
Tap a saved fingerprint (which will have a generic name such 
as "Finger 1").
Figure 8-6.  To unlock your device using a saved fingerprint, make sure the Device Unlock 
switch is On

Chapter 8 ■ Protecting Your Device
100
■
■Tip   If iOS has given your fingerprints generic names such as "Finger 1" and "Finger 
2," how do you know which is which? With the Touch ID & Passcode screen displayed, rest 
a finger on the Home button. If iOS recognizes that finger, it highlights the corresponding 
fingerprint name.
	
4.	
Type a new name for the fingerprint, as shown in Figure 8-7 
and then tap Done.
	
5.	
Repeat steps 3 and 4 for each saved fingerprint.
You Want to Configure Your Device to Lock Automatically
You can lock your iOS device at any time by pressing the Sleep/Wake button once. 
However, if your iOS device is on but you're not using it, it automatically goes into standby 
mode after two minutes. This is called Auto-Lock and it's a handy feature because it saves 
battery power (and prevents accidental taps) when your iOS device is just sitting there. 
It's also a crucial feature if you've protected your iOS device with a passcode or fingerprint 
lock, as I describe earlier, because if your iOS device is never locked, then these security 
features are useless. You might find, however, that your iOS device does not lock itself 
automatically after a period of inactivity.
Solution: To make sure your iOS device locks automatically, you must configure the 
Auto-Lock feature to shut of the device after a specified period of inactivity. Here are the 
steps to follow:
	
1.	
On the Home screen, tap Settings. The Settings app appears.
	
2.	
In iOS 10, tap Display & Brightness. In earlier versions of iOS, 
tap General.
	
3.	
Tap Auto-Lock. The Auto-Lock screen appears.
	
4.	
Tap the interval you want to use. Note that the available 
options depend on your device. Figure 8-8 shows the options 
available for the iPhone: 30 seconds, 1 Minute, 2 Minutes, 3 
Minutes, 4 Minutes, or 5 Minutes.
Figure 8-7.  To help you remember which digits you've added as fingerprints, supply each 
fingerprint with a descriptive name

Chapter 8 ■ Protecting Your Device
101
Backing Up Your Device
If something bad happens to your iOS device – for example, it crashes and will no longer 
start normally, it gets damaged or lost, or you forget your passcode – you can get back on 
your feet by restoring the device's default settings (as described in Chapter 1). What about 
all that data you've stored on your device? To restore that, you need to have a backup 
available, either on your computer or on iCloud.
You Want to Back Up Your Device without Syncing
When you sync your iOS device with your computer, iTunes automatically creates a 
backup of your current iOS device data before performing the sync. Note, however, that 
iTunes doesn't back up your entire iOS device, which makes sense because most of what's 
on your device @@md music, photos, videos, apps, and so on @@md is already on your 
computer. Instead, iTunes backs up only data unique to the iOS device, including your 
call history, text messages, web clips, network settings, app settings and data, and Safari 
history and cookies.
However, if you've configured iTunes not to sync your iOS device automatically, you 
might want to back up your iOS device without performing a sync.
Figure 8-8.  To ensure your passcode and/or fingerprint lock can do their jobs, use Auto-
Lock to automatically lock your device after it has been inactive for the specified time

Chapter 8 ■ Protecting Your Device
102
Solution: Follow these steps to back up your iOS device using iTunes:
	
1.	
Connect your iOS device to your computer.
	
2.	
Open iTunes, if it doesn't launch automatically.
	
3.	
If your iOS device asks whether you trust this computer, tap 
Trust and, on your computer, click Continue.
	
4.	
In the Devices list, click your iOS device.
	
5.	
Click the Summary tab.
	
6.	
Click Back Up Now, as shown in Figure 8-9. iTunes backs up 
the iOS device data.
You Want iOS to Back Up your Device Automatically
Using iTunes to back up your iOS device is handy, but it requires that you connect your 
device to your computer, open iTunes, and run the backup. These are not onerous steps, 
but they present enough of a hurdle that you might not back up your device regularly. 
That's a problem because they key to restoring your data successfully should it come to 
that is to have a recent backup available.
To make sure this happens, it would be nice to have a way to automatically back up 
your iOS device on a regular schedule.
Solution: If you have an iCloud account, you can configure your iOS device to use iCloud 
as the backup location.
If you regularly use iTunes to sync your iOS device, you can tell iTunes to use iCloud 
as the backup location. To configure this, follow these steps:
	
1.	
Connect your iOS device to your computer.
	
2.	
In iTunes, click your iOS device when it appears in the Devices 
list.
	
3.	
Click the Summary tab.
	
4.	
In the Automatically Back Up section, select iCloud, as shown 
in Figure 8-10.
Figure 8-9.  In iTunes, click your connected iOS device, click the Summary tab, and then 
click Back Up Now

Chapter 8 ■ Protecting Your Device
103
If you never use iTunes, you can still configure iOS to back up your data to iCloud 
directly from your iOS device:
	
1.	
On the Home screen, tap Settings to launch the Settings app.
	
2.	
Tap iCloud.
	
3.	
Tap Backup.
	
4.	
Tap the iCloud Backup switch to On, as shown in Figure 8-11,  
and then tap OK when iCloud confirms the setting. This 
tells iOS to make automatic backups whenever the device is 
locked, connected to a Wi-Fi network, and plugged in to a 
power source.
	
5.	
To run a backup right away, tap Back Up Now. Your iOS device 
backs up its data to your iCloud account.
Figure 8-10.  In iTunes, click your connected iOS device, click the Summary tab, and then 
click iCloud in the Automatically Back Up section
Figure 8-11.  Tap iCloud Backup to On to set up automatic iCloud backups

Chapter 8 ■ Protecting Your Device
104
You're Having iCloud Backup Problems
After you've set up iCloud backups, you might find that the backups don't complete or 
don't run at all.
Solution: There are a number of possible reasons why iCloud backups won't run. Here 
are some things to look for:
• 
Make sure that iCloud backups are activated. Open the Settings app, 
tap iCloud, tap Backup, and then tap the iCloud Backup switch to On.
• 
Make sure your iOS device is connected to a Wi-Fi network. 
iCloud backups do not work if there is no Internet connection, nor 
do they work over a cellular connection.
• 
Make sure your iOS device is plugged in to a power source.
• 
Make sure your device is locked.
• 
Check that you have free space on your iCloud account. To check this, 
open the Settings app, tap iCloud, and then examine the Available 
value beside the Storage command, as shown in Figure 8-12.
■
■Note   How do you know whether you have enough free space on iCloud? Backup size 
varies according to device and capacity, but expect your backup to require anywhere from 
400 MB to 1 GB.
If your iCloud backup is failing because storage space is low, you can free up some 
space by deleting one or more backups from devices you no long own or use:
	
1.	
On the Home screen, tap Settings to launch the Settings app.
	
2.	
Tap iCloud.
	
3.	
Tap Storage.
	
4.	
Tap Manage Storage.
	
5.	
In the Backups section, tap the device whose backups you 
want to delete.
	
6.	
Tap Delete Backup. iOS asks you to confirm that you want to 
turn off backups for this device and delete its backup data.
	
7.	
Tap Turn Off & Delete.
Figure 8-12.  In the Settings app's iCloud screen, the Storage command shows you how 
much free space is left in your iCloud account

Chapter 8 ■ Protecting Your Device
105
Protecting a Lost Device
If there's a downside to using an iOS device, it's that you end up with a pretty large chunk 
of your life on that device. Initially, that may sound like a good thing, but if you happen 
to lose your device, you've also lost that chunk of your life. Plus, assuming you haven't 
configured your iOS device with a passcode lock, as described earlier, you've opened a 
gaping privacy hole because anyone can now delve into your data.
If you've been backing up your iOS device regularly, then you can probably recover 
most, or even all, of that data. However, I'm sure you'd probably rather find your device 
because it's expensive and there's just something creepy about the thought of some 
stranger flicking through your stuff.
The old way of finding your missing iOS device consisted of scouring every nook 
and cranny that you visited before losing it, and calling up various lost-and-found 
departments to see if anyone turned it in. The new way to find your iOS device is via a 
feature called Find My iPhone. (You can use this feature through your iCloud account, if 
you have one, or through the Find My iPhone app.) Find My iPhone uses the GPS sensor 
embedded inside your iOS device to locate the device. You can also use Find My iPhone 
to play a sound on your iOS device, remotely lock it and send a message, or, in a real 
pinch, remotely delete your data.
■
■Note   You might think that a fatal flaw with Find My iPhone is that someone who has 
your iOS device can easily turn off the feature and disable it. Fortunately, that's not the case 
because iOS comes with a feature called Activation Lock, which means that a person can 
turn off Find My iPhone only by entering your Apple ID password.
You Want to Ensure That You Can Find a Lost Device
Find My iPhone works by looking for a particular signal that your iOS device beams out 
into the ether. This signal is turned off by default, so you need to turn it on if you ever plan 
to use Find My iPhone.
Solution: Follow these steps to activate Find My iPhone:
	
1.	
On the Home screen, tap Settings. The Settings app appears.
	
2.	
Tap iCloud. Your iCloud account settings appear.
	
3.	
Tap Find My Device (where Device is iPhone, iPad, or iPod).
	
4.	
Tap the Find My Device switch to On. iOS asks you to confirm.
	
5.	
Tap Allow.

Chapter 8 ■ Protecting Your Device
106
■
■Tip   Your lost iOS device might just be lying somewhere where no one can find it. In 
that case, the danger is that the iOS device battery will die before you have a chance to 
locate it using Find My iPhone. To make this less likely, be sure to activate the Send Last 
Location switch. This configures iOS to send you the device's last known location as soon as 
it detects that its battery is nearly done.
You Want to Locate a Lost Device on a Map
To get a general idea of where your lost device is located, you might prefer to see its 
location visually, by using a map.
Solution: You can use the Find My iPhone feature of icloud.com to locate your device. 
Here are the steps to follow:
	
1.	
Use a web browser to navigate to www.icloud.com.
■
■Note   Rather than using icloud.com, you can also use the Find My iPhone app to locate 
your lost iOS device.
	
2.	
Sign in to your iCloud account.
	
3.	
Click Find My iPhone. The iCloud Find My iPhone application 
appears.
	
4.	
Click All Devices. iCloud displays a list of your iOS devices.
	
5.	
Click your lost iOS device in the list. iCloud locates your iOS 
device on a map, as shown in Figure 8-13.

Chapter 8 ■ Protecting Your Device
107
■
■Tip   To see if the device's location has changed, click the Refresh Location button 
(pointed out in Figure 8-13).
You Want to Locate a Lost Device by Playing a Sound
Locating your lost device on a map is often handy (for example, it might show you that 
your device is in your house or your workplace), but most of the time it's not specific 
enough to tell you exactly where your device can be found.
If you misplace your iPhone, the first thing you should try is calling your number 
using another device so you can hear it ringing.
The solution won't work if, for example, your phone has Ring/Silent switched to 
silent mode, if it's in Airplane mode, or if you don't have another device handy. It would 
be nice to be able to hear a sound on your iPhone anyway, and it would be nice to be able 
to hear a sound on a lost iPad or iPod touch.
Figure 8-13.  You can use iCloud's Find My iPhone application to locate your lost iOS 
device on a map

Chapter 8 ■ Protecting Your Device
108
Solution: You can use Find My iPhone to play a sound on your device. This sound plays 
even if your iOS device is in silent mode or Airplane mode, and it plays loudly even if your 
iOS device has its volume turned down or muted. Here's how it works:
	
1.	
Sign in to iCloud and open the Find My iPhone application.
	
2.	
Display the My Devices list.
	
3.	
Click your lost iOS device in the list. Find My iPhone locates 
your iOS device on a map.
	
4.	
Click Play Sound. Find My iPhone begins playing the sound 
on your iOS device and displays an alert message.
	
5.	
When you find your iOS device, tap OK in the alert message 
(and, if needed, enter your passcode or Touch ID) to silence 
the sound.
You Want to Lock the Data on a Lost Device
If you can't find your iOS device right away by playing a sound, your next step should 
be to ensure that some other person who finds the device can't rummage around in 
your stuff.
Solution: You do that by putting your iOS device into lost mode, which remotely locks 
the iOS device using the passcode that you set earlier. (If you didn't protect your iOS 
device with a passcode, you can't remotely lock the device.) You can also provide a phone 
number where you can be reached and send a message for whoever finds your iOS 
device.
Follow these steps to put your iOS device into lost mode:
	
1.	
Sign in to iCloud and open the Find My iPhone application.
	
2.	
Display the My Devices list.
	
3.	
Click your lost iOS device in the list. Find My iPhone locates 
the device on a map.
	
4.	
Click Lost Mode. Find My iPhone displays the Lost Mode 
dialog, which prompts you for a phone number where you can 
be reached.
	
5.	
Type your phone number and then click Next. Find My 
iPhone prompts you to type a message that will appear on the 
iOS device along with the phone number.
	
6.	
Type the message and then tap or click Done. Find My iPhone 
remotely locks the iOS device and displays the message.

Chapter 8 ■ Protecting Your Device
109
■
■Caution   If you do not locate your device after it has been locked, keep an eye out for 
an email or text message telling you that your device has been found. When you click the 
link, you're asked to provide your Apple sign-in credentials. This will look like a legitimate 
Apple message, but it's really a scam set up to obtain your Apple ID sign-in data, so that the 
scammer can unlock your device.
You Want to Erase the Data on a Lost Device
If you can't get the other person to return your iOS device and it contains sensitive or 
confidential data, you might want to take further steps to ensure that the other person 
cannot access your data.
Solution: You can use Find My iPhone to take the drastic step of remotely wiping all the 
data from your iOS device. Here are the steps to follow:
	
1.	
Sign in to iCloud and open the Find My iPhone application.
	
2.	
Display the My Devices list.
	
3.	
Click your lost iOS device in the list. Find My iPhone locates 
the device on a map.
	
4.	
Click Erase Device (where Device is iPhone, iPad, or iPod). 
Find My iPhone prompts you for your Apple ID password.
	
5.	
Type your password and then click Next. Find My iPhone asks 
you to enter an optional phone number where you can be 
reached, which will appear on the iOS device after it has been 
erased.
	
6.	
Type your phone number, and then click Next. Find My 
iPhone prompts you to type a message that will appear on the 
iOS device along with the phone number, after it has been 
erased.
	
7.	
Type the message, and then click Done. Find My iPhone 
remotely wipes all data from the iOS device.
■
■Note   If you locate your device after you have erased it, you can restore your settings, 
apps, and data by connecting the device to your computer and then using iTunes to restore 
your most recent backup.

CHAPTER 9
Solving Privacy Problems
One of the unforeseen consequences of the mobile device revolution is that we now often 
do our computing in public. Yes, there have long been people tapping on laptops in coffee 
shops, but these days we're more likely to also be tapping on our phones and tablets on 
buses, in parks, before movies, and after classes. This means that privacy is a potential 
problem because now people can see our screens as we work. Another unforeseen 
consequence of the mobile device revolution is that we now carry with us a great deal of 
personal or confidential information. This opens up another potential privacy problem 
because if someone gained access to your device, that person would be free to view your 
apps, your oft-visited locations, your browsing history, and much more. In Chapter 8 
you learned how to lock your iOS device, but it isn't difficult to imagine scenarios where 
someone could still access your device while it is unlocked. All this means that it's 
important to take privacy seriously and to embrace a prudent paranoia: Assume someone 
is watching your screen when you're in public; assume someone could gain unlocked 
access to your device. This chapter shows you how to take steps to solve these and similar 
privacy problems.
Troubleshooting General Privacy Issues
Let's begin by troubleshooting a few issues related to general privacy concerns,
As You Type, Each Character Pops Up on the Screen, 
Creating a Privacy Risk
The iPhone onscreen keyboard comes with a feature called character preview, which 
displays a pop-up version of each character as you tap it. (This doesn't happen on the 
iPad.) This is great for iOS keyboard rookies because it helps them be sure they're typing 
accurately, but veterans often find it distracting. Either way, it's a potential privacy risk 
to have each character pop up when you're typing where anyone nearby can see your 
screen.

Chapter 9 ■ Solving Privacy Problems
112
Solution: Apple chose to turn off character preview by default in iOS 9, but if you're 
seeing characters as you type on your iPhone, then you need to turn it off yourself by 
following these steps:
	
1.	
Open the Settings app.
	
2.	
Tap General.
	
3.	
Tap Keyboard.
	
4.	
Tap the Character Preview switch to Off, as shown in Figure 9-1.

■Caution   Even with Character Preview set to On, iOS no longer shows pop-up versions 
of password characters. That's nice, but it still shows your most recently tapped password 
character for as long as three seconds! There's no way to turn that off, so try to cover your 
password typing when you're in a public place.
You Want to Stop an App from Using Another App's Data
Third-party apps occasionally request permission to use the data from another app. For 
example, an app might need access to your contacts, your calendars, your photos, or your 
Twitter and Facebook accounts. You can always deny these requests, of course, but if 
you've allowed access to an app in the past, you might later change your mind and decide 
you'd prefer to revoke that access.
Figure 9-1.  To prevent characters from popping up as your type them, turn off the 
Character Preview setting

Chapter 9 ■ Solving Privacy Problems
113
Solution: iOS offers a privacy feature that enables you to control which apps have access 
to your data. Here's how it works:
	
1.	
Open the Settings app.
	
2.	
Tap Privacy. The Privacy screen appears.
	
3.	
Tap the app or feature for which you want to control access. 
iOS displays a list of third-party apps that have requested 
access to the app or feature. Figure 9-2 shows an example for 
the Photos app.
	
4.	
To revoke a third-party app's access to the app or feature, tap 
its switch to Off.
You Do Not Want Your Location Tracked
In iOS, location services refers to the features and technologies that provide apps and 
system tools with access to the current geographical coordinates of the device. This is a 
handy thing, but it's also something that you need to keep under your control because 
your location data, particularly your current location, is fundamentally private and 
shouldn't be given out willy-nilly. Fortunately, iOS comes with a few tools for controlling 
and configuring location services.
The next couple of sections show you how to turn off location services for individual 
apps as well as individual system services. That fine-grained control is the best way to 
handle location services, but there may be times when you prefer a broader approach 
that turns off location services altogether. For example, if you're heading to a secret 
rendezvous (how exciting!) and you're bringing your iOS device with you, you might 
feel more comfortable knowing that no app or service on your device is tracking your 
whereabouts.
Figure 9-2.  In Settings, tap Privacy and then tap an app or feature to see the third-party 
apps that have requested access to that item

Chapter 9 ■ Solving Privacy Problems
114
■
■Note   On a more mundane level, location services use up battery power, so if your 
iOS device is getting low or if you just want to maximize the battery (for a long bus ride, for 
example), then turning off location services completely will help.
Solution: Follow these steps to turn off all location services on your iOS device:
	
1.	
Open the Settings app.
	
2.	
Tap Privacy. The Privacy settings appear.
	
3.	
Tap Location Services. The Location Services settings appear.
	
4.	
Tap the Location Services switch to the Off position. iOS asks 
you to confirm.
	
5.	
Tap Turn Off. iOS shuts off all location services (see Figure 9-3).
You Want to Stop an App from Using Your Location
When you open an app that comes with a GPS component, the app displays a dialog 
like the one shown in Figure 9-4 to ask your permission to use the GPS hardware in your 
device to determine your current location. Notice that iOS only allows apps to access 
your location while you use the app. Once you exit the app, it can no longer access your 
location. Tap Don't Allow if you think that your current location is none of the app's 
business, or tap Allow if that's just fine with you.
Figure 9-3.  To prevent your location from being used by any app or service, set the 
Location Services switch to Off

Chapter 9 ■ Solving Privacy Problems
115
A slightly different scenario is when an app must use your location to function. A 
good example is Foursquare, which requires your location to show you nearby businesses 
and to let you "check in" to those places. In this case, iOS automatically gives the app 
access to your location while you're using the app, but the app might request access to 
your location even when you're not using it, as shown in Figure 9-5. Again, tap Don't 
Allow if you think the app is overstepping its bounds, or tap Allow if it's all good.
Figure 9-4.  When you first launch a GPS-aware app, it asks your permission to access your 
current location while you use the app
Figure 9-5.  An app that must access your location while you use the app might also seek 
permission to access your location when you're not using it
Whatever type of permission you choose, after you make your decision, you might 
change your mind. For example, if you deny your location to an app, that app might lack 
some crucial functionality. Similarly, if you allow an app to use your location, you might 
have second thoughts about compromising your privacy.

Chapter 9 ■ Solving Privacy Problems
116
Solution: Whatever the reason, you can control an app's access to your location by 
following these steps:
	
1.	
Open the Settings app.
	
2.	
Tap Privacy. The Privacy settings appear.
	
3.	
Tap Location Services. The Location Services screen appears.
	
4.	
Tap the app for which you want to configure access to GPS. 
The app's location access options appear. Figure 9-6 shows 
the options for the Foursquare app.
	
5.	
Tap one of the following options to configure the app's access 
to your location:
• 
Never. Tap this option if you want to deny your current 
location to the app.
• 
While Using the App. Tap this option if you want to allow a 
specific app to access your current location only when you 
are actively using the app.
• 
Always. Tap this option if the app requires your location to 
function even when you're not using it. (Note that this option 
is only available for apps that require full-time access to GPS.)
You Want to Stop One or More System Services from 
Using Your Location
iOS also provides location services to various internal system services that perform tasks, 
such as calibrating the compass, setting the time zone, and serving up Apple Ads that 
change depending on location data. You might prefer that iOS not provide your location 
to one or more of these services.
Figure 9-6.  Use these options to configure an app's access to your location

Chapter 9 ■ Solving Privacy Problems
117
Solution: If you don't want iOS providing your location to some of these services, you can 
prevent this by following these steps:
	
1.	
Open the Settings app.
	
2.	
Tap Privacy. The Privacy screen appears.
	
3.	
Tap Location Services. The Location Services screen appears.
	
4.	
Tap System Services. iOS displays the System Services screen. 
The iPhone version of this screen is shown in Figure 9-7.
	
5.	
For any system service to which you don't want to provide 
access to location data, tap its switch to Off.
Figure 9-7.  Tap the switch to Off beside any system service that you want to deny access to 
your location

Chapter 9 ■ Solving Privacy Problems
118
■
■Tip   It's also important to know when a system service is using your location. To set 
this up, scroll to the bottom of the System Services screen and tap the Status Bar Icon 
switch to On. iOS will now use the status bar to display one of the icons shown above this 
switch whenever a system service is using your location.
You Want to Prevent iOS from Storing a List of Your 
Frequent Locations
iOS keeps track of the physical locations you visit most frequently, and it offers this data 
to apps such as Maps and Calendar. This enables these apps to make suggestions based 
on your location history, but you might prefer that iOS not keep track of your frequent 
locations for privacy reasons.
Solution: You can enhance your privacy not only by clearing the list of frequent locations, 
but also by preventing iOS from maintaining this list at all. Here are the steps to follow:
	
1.	
Open the Settings app.
	
2.	
Tap Privacy. The Privacy screen appears.
	
3.	
Tap Location Services. The Location Services screen appears.
	
4.	
Tap System Services. iOS displays the System Services screen.
	
5.	
Tap Frequent Locations to open the Frequent Locations 
screen.
	
6.	
To remove the current list of frequent locations, tap Clear 
History, and then when asked to confirm, tap Clear History 
once again.
	
7.	
To prevent iOS from storing your oft-used location, tap the 
Frequent Locations switch to Off, as shown in Figure 9-8.

You Do Not Want to Share Your Location with your 
Family and Friends
When you set up Family Sharing on your iCloud account, one of the setup screens asks if 
you want to share your location with your family using the Messages and Find My Friends 
apps. If you initially decided to share your location, you might later decide to change your 
mind and keep your location private.
Solution: You can disable this feature by following these steps:
	
1.	
Open the Settings app.
	
2.	
Tap Privacy. The Privacy screen appears.
	
3.	
Tap Location Services. The Location Services screen appears.
	
4.	
Tap Share My Location to open the Share My Location screen.
	
5.	
Tap the Share My Location switch to Off, as shown in Figure 9-9.
You Do Not Want Uour Device Usage Information Being 
Sent to Apple
iOS constantly monitors your device resources to watch out for adverse events. Then can 
include memory getting too low, processor usage getting too high, an app crashing, or 
the system spontaneously rebooting. When it detects such events, iOS records the current 
system state and writes this data to a diagnostics file. Figure 9-10 shows a typical entry.
Figure 9-9.  To no longer allow family and friends to see your location, tap the Share My 
Location switch to Off

Chapter 9 ■ Solving Privacy Problems

As you can see, the data is for the most part highly technical. That's because it's 
meant to be used by Apple engineers when diagnosing a problem with your device or 
an app.
■
■Note   To view your diagnostics and usage entries, open Settings, tap Privacy, tap 
Diagnostics and Usage, and then tap Diagnostics & Usage Data.
However, iOS also periodically creates diagnostic logs and sends them to Apple for 
analysis. These logs are useful to Apple for fixing bugs and improving their products, but 
they are anonymous and generally do not contain any personal data. I say "generally" 
here because Apple does include location data in these logs.
Despite this, you might feel uncomfortable sending your usage and diagnostics data 
to Apple, particularly your location.
Figure 9-10.  A typical diagnostics entry

Chapter 9 ■ Solving Privacy Problems

You Do Not Want to Receive Targeted Ads
In much the same way that online advertisers can track you across the Web using 
cookies (small text files that the advertisers store on your computer), app advertisers 
can track your interests using a piece of data called the Advertising Identifier. This is an 
anonymous device identifier that iOS uses when you perform certain actions, such as 
searching the App Store. Advertisers have access to the Advertising Identifier and can 
use it to serve you ads that are selected based on your usage. You might prefer not to 
receive these targeted ads.
Solution: You can configure your privacy settings to tell advertisers not to use the 
Advertising Identifier to track your interests and actions. You can also reset the 
Advertising Identifier value, which is similar to deleting the tracking cookies on your 
computer.
Follow these steps:
	
1.	
Open the Settings app.
	
2.	
Tap Privacy. The Privacy screen appears.
	
3.	
Tap Advertising. The Advertising screen appears.
	
4.	
Tap the Limit Add Tracking switch to On, as shown in 
Figure 9-13.
	
5.	
Tap Reset Advertising Identifier and, when iOS asks you to 
confirm, tap Reset Identifier.
Another way that iOS serves you targeted ads is via your location. Here are the steps 
to follow to turn off this privacy breach:
	
1.	
Open the Settings app.
	
2.	
Tap Privacy. The Privacy screen appears.
	
3.	
Tap Location Services. The Location Services screen appears.

Troubleshooting Web Browsing Privacy Issues
The rest of this chapter takes you through a few troubleshooting techniques related to 
enhancing the privacy of your web browsing sessions.
You Want to Delete the List of Websites You've Visited
Safari's History list – the collection of sites you've recently surfed – is a great feature when 
you need it, and it's an innocuous feature when you don't. However, there are times 
when the History list is just plain uncool. For example, if you visit a private corporate site, 
a financial site, or any other site you wouldn't want others to see, the History list might 
betray you.
And sometimes unsavory sites can end up in your History list by accident. For 
example, you might tap a legitimate-looking link in a web page or email message, only 
to end up in some dark, unpleasant web neighborhood. Of course, you high-tail it out of 
there right away with a quick tap of the Back button, but that nasty site is now lurking in 
your history.
■
■Caution   As of iOS 9, clearing your Safari history also clears your cookies and website 
data. Clearing cookies might present problems since many of them store site login data or 
site customizations. Therefore, when clearing your history, consider only clearing recent data 
(such as data from the previous hour).
Solution: Whether you've got sites on the History list that you wouldn't want anyone to 
see, or you just find the idea of Safari tracking your movements on the Web to be a bit 
sinister, follow these steps to wipe out the History list:
	
1.	
In Safari, tap the Bookmarks button. Safari opens the 
Bookmarks list.
	
2.	
Tap Back until you get to the Bookmarks screen.
	
3.	
Tap History. Safari opens the History screen.
	
4.	
Tap Clear. Safari asks how much of your history you want to 
clear, as shown in Figure 9-16.

Chapter 9 ■ Solving Privacy Problems
125
	
5.	
Tap a time period: The Last Hour, Today, Today and Yesterday, 
or All Time. Safari deletes every site from the History list for 
that time period.
■
■Note   Safari uses your history (as well as your bookmarks) to analyze each page 
you view and determine the most likely link you'll tap — the so-called top hit — and 
preloads that link. If you do tap that link, the page loads lickety-split. However, if you're 
not comfortable having Safari send your history and bookmarks to Apple, you can turn 
this feature off. Tap Settings, tap Safari, and then tap the Preload Top Hit switch to Off (see 
Figure 9-17).
You Do Not Want Safari to Show Suggestions When You 
Search
Another way Safari might compromise your online privacy is by displaying suggestions 
as you enter search text into the address bar. If someone is looking over your shoulder or 
simply borrows your device for a quick search, she might see these suggestions.
Figure 9-16.  Tap Clear and then tap how much of your web browsing history you want to 
delete

Chapter 9 ■ Solving Privacy Problems
126
Solution: To turn these suggestions off, follow these steps:
	
1.	
Open the Settings app.
	
2.	
Tap Safari to open the Safari screen.
	
3.	
Tap both the Search Engine Suggestions switch and the Safari 
Suggestions switch to Off, as shown in Figure 9-17.
You Want to Browse the Web without Storing Data About 
the Sites You Visit
If you find yourself constantly deleting your browsing history or website data, you 
can save yourself a bit of time by configuring Safari to do this automatically. This is 
called private browsing and it means that Safari doesn't save any data as you browse. 
Specifically, it doesn't save the following:
• 
Sites aren't added to the history (although the Back and Forward 
buttons still work for navigating sites that you've visited in the 
current session).
• 
Web page text and images aren't saved.
• 
Search text isn't saved with the search box.
• 
AutoFill passwords aren't saved.
Figure 9-17.  You can prevent Safari from making suggestions that other people might be 
able to see

Chapter 9 ■ Solving Privacy Problems
127
Solution: To activate private browsing, follow these steps:
	
1.	
In Safari, tap the Tabs button.
	
2.	
Tap Private. Safari creates a separate set of tabs for private 
browsing.
	
3.	
Tap Add Tab (+). Safari creates a new private tab.
When you're done browsing privately, tap the Tabs icon and then tap the Private 
button to turn off Private Browsing.
You Want to Ensure You're Not Being Tracked by Online 
Advertisers
Under the guise of providing you with the "benefit" of targeted ads, online advertisers use 
cookies to track the websites you visit, the searches you conduct, and so on. This data isn't 
linked to you personally, but no one likes to be tracked in this way. Fortunately, iOS Safari 
is configured by default to minimize this kind of tracking, but you might want to confirm – 
or even strengthen – these settings.
Solution: Preventing online tracking involves two things. First, make sure Safari's Do Not 
Track setting is activated, which tells advertisers not to track you online. Note, however, 
that it does not force advertisers not to track you. Compliance is voluntary, but you 
should activate the setting anyway for the few advertisers who do honor it.
Second, you need to decide the level at which you want to block cookies. You have 
four choices:
• 
Always Block. This level tells Safari not to accept any cookies. I 
don't recommend this level because it disables functionality on 
many websites (for example, a site's ability to save your login data 
and customizations).
• 
Allow from Current Website Only. This level tells Safari to only 
accept cookies that are set by whatever website you are currently 
visiting. No other website – in particular, no online advertising site 
– can set a cookie. If you want to strengthen Safari's ad-blocking, 
this is the setting to use, although there's a chance you might lose 
some functionality (see the next item).
• 
Allow from Websites I Visit. This level tells Safari to only accept 
cookies not only from the current website, but also from any 
website you've visited in the past. For example, suppose you 
have earlier visited the YouTube site. If the current site wants 
to set a YouTube cookie, then this setting will allow it. If you've 
never visited a site in the past – which will be the case for the 
vast majority of online advertising sites – then Safari blocks 
cookies from that site. This is the default setting, and it's a good 
compromise because sites you've previously visited might need to 
access a cookie to implement some functionality on your current 
site (such as account data).

Chapter 9 ■ Solving Privacy Problems
128
• 
Always Allow. This level tells Safari to accept any cookie from any 
site. Avoid this setting because it means that any online advertiser 
who does not honor the Do Not Track setting (which is, alas, the 
vast majority of them) will use cookies to track you.
Follow these steps to configure Safari to ensure you're not being tracked by online 
advertisers:
	
1.	
Open the Settings app.
	
2.	
Tap Safari to open the Safari screen.
	
3.	
If needed, tap the Do Not Track switch to On.
	
4.	
Tap Block Cookies to open the Block Cookies screen, shown in 
Figure 9-18.
	
5.	
Tap the cookie-blocking setting you prefer to use.
You Want to Remove Your Saved Credit Card Data
In Chapter 4, "Resolving Web Issues," you learned how to save time and effort by storing 
your credit card data inside Safari. That's convenient, but it's also dangerous if you lend 
your device or if someone obtain your device while it's unlocked.
Solution: You can follow these steps to remove a saved credit card:
	
1.	
Open the Settings app.
	
2.	
Tap Safari to open the Safari screen.
	
3.	
Tap AutoFill to open the AutoFill screen.
	
4.	
Tap Saved Credit Cards. iOS prompts you to enter your 
passcode or Touch ID, if either is set up.
Figure 9-18.  Safari's cookie-blocking settings

Chapter 9 ■ Solving Privacy Problems
129
	
5.	
Type your passcode or apply your fingerprint to open the 
Credit Cards screen.
	
6.	
Tap Edit.
	
7.	
Tap the credit card you want to remove, then tap Delete.
You Want to Remove Your Saved Website Passwords
You can configure Safari's AutoFill feature to save website usernames and passwords. 
That's a real convenience, but it means that anyone who has access to your unlocked 
device will be able to log in to any of those sites.
Solution: To avoid this problem, you can delete one or more of your saved website 
passwords. Here are the steps to follow:
	
1.	
Open the Settings app.
	
2.	
Tap Safari to open the Safari screen.
	
3.	
Tap Passwords. iOS prompts you to enter your passcode or 
Touch ID, if either is set up.
	
4.	
Type your passcode or apply your fingerprint to open the 
Passwords screen.
	
5.	
Tap Edit.
	
6.	
Tap each password you want to remove, then tap Delete.

CHAPTER 10
Repairing Battery and 
Charging Problems
One of the oddities of the modern digital world is that while our devices have undergone 
mind-blowing increases in performance, miniaturization, and overall technical 
sophistication over the past decade or so, the battery life of those devices has increased 
comparatively slowly. For example, from the iPhone 4s to the iPhone 6 – four generations – 
battery life for using the Internet over Wi-Fi increased from 9 hours to 11 hours. Apple 
claims the iPhone 7 Plus will get 15 hours, but even a 67 percent increase over six 
generations is nothing to brag about. Given the importance we place on our iOS devices, 
it's no wonder that the number one gripe by far among users is poor battery life and 
the number one request by far for each new generation is better – much better – battery 
performance. Unfortunately, there are many technical reasons why we won't see a radical 
increase in battery life for our iOS devices any time soon. That means we need to take 
steps now to monitor and maximize the batteries that we have.
Tracking Battery Use
iOS doesn't give a ton of battery data, but you can monitor both the total usage time 
(this includes all activities: calling, surfing, playing media, and so on) and standby time 
(time when your iOS device was in sleep mode). Also, one of the nice features in iOS is 
a breakdown of recent (the last three hours) battery usage by app, so you can see which 
apps have been draining your battery.
You Want to Know Exactly How Much Battery Power You 
Have Left
By default, iOS displays a battery icon in the status bar (see Figure 10-1). As the battery 
drains, the amount of white inside the icon gets smaller, and the level turns red when the 
amount of battery power gets low enough that you need to start paying attention. This is 
useful information, to be sure, but it's all a bit vague and imprecise.

Chapter 10 ■ Repairing Battery and Charging Problems
132
Figure 10-1.  The iOS battery icon appears in the status bar
Solution: To keep closer tabs on your device battery life, you need to tell iOS to also 
display the percentage of battery power remaining. Here are the steps to follow:
	
1.	
On the Home screen, tap Settings to open the Settings app.
	
2.	
Tap Battery to open the Battery screen.
	
3.	
Tap the Battery Percentage switch to On, as shown in 
Figure 10-2.
You Want to Know How Much You're Using Your Device 
on Battery Power
Apple puts out lots of battery life numbers that include both usage mode (that is, when 
your device is on) and standby mode (when your device is asleep). But if you need to 
know whether your device will have enough battery power for, say, a long plane ride 
or some similar extended time away from a power outlet, can you really trust Apple 
numbers?
Figure 10-2.  Tap the Battery Percentage switch to On to add the percentage of battery 
power remaining to the status bar icon

Chapter 10 ■ Repairing Battery and Charging Problems
133
Solution: Fortunately, you don't have to trust Apple on this because iOS keeps track of 
your devices overall battery use. Specifically, it tracks the amount of time since the last 
full charge that your device has been in usage mode and in standby mode. By tracking 
these numbers over time and over several charging cycles, you'll get to know how much 
battery life your iOS device gets when you use it.
Follow these steps to view these numbers:
	
1.	
On the Home screen, tap Settings to open the Settings app.
	
2.	
Tap Battery to open the Battery screen.
	
3.	
Scroll to the bottom of the screen and read the Usage and 
Standby values, as shown in Figure 10-3.
You Suspect an App Has Been Using Too Much Battery 
Power
One of the benefits of adding the percentage value to the status bar's battery icon and 
monitoring the Usage time in the Battery screen of the Settings app is that you get to know 
how your apps use battery power. In particular, you might notice that your battery seems 
to drain a little faster than normal when you use a particular app. That's useful to know, 
but how can you be sure?
Solution: iOS can help by breaking down your device's battery usage by app. For both the 
last 24 hours and the last 7 days, you see the percentage of total battery power that each 
app has used. You can also display the total amount of time each app has used the battery 
both when the app was onscreen and when it was running in the background.
If you see that a particular app has been using far more battery life than you think 
it should – particularly if you don't use the app much more than your other apps – it 
might indicate a problem. For example, the app might have a memory leak, or it might be 
running tasks in the background.
Follow these steps to view battery usage by app:
	
1.	
On the Home screen, tap Settings to open the Settings app.
	
2.	
Tap Battery to open the Battery screen.
	
3.	
In the Battery Usage section (see Figure 10-4), tap to switch 
between seeing usage for the Last 24 Hours and the Last 7 Days.
Figure 10-3.  Scroll to the bottom of the Battery screen to read the total time since the last 
full charge that your iOS device has been in usage and standby modes

Chapter 10 ■ Repairing Battery and Charging Problems
134
	
4.	
Tap the Time icon (pointed out in Figure 10-4) to toggle the 
total onscreen and background usage times for each app.
Extending Battery Life
Reducing battery consumption as much as possible on your iOS device not only extends 
the time between charges but also extends the overall life of your battery. The Battery 
Usage screen usually offers a suggestion or two for extending battery life, but there are 
many other steps you can take.
You Want to Prevent All Your Apps from Running in the 
Background
One of the best battery usage tools that iOS has to offer is the Time icon in the Battery 
screen (see Figure 10-4, earlier). When activated, this feature tells you not only how much 
time each app has been using the battery while onscreen but, more importantly, how 
much time each app has been draining battery power in the background. The capability 
of an app to perform tasks in the background is called Background App Refresh and it's 
important because although you know when an app is active onscreen, you don't always 
know when it's active in the background, since iOS usually gives you no indication.
In practical terms, this means that if your battery is running low, you can stop using 
certain apps, but you won't know if those or other apps are still working – and therefore 
using up precious battery power – in the background.
Figure 10-4.  In the Battery screen, the Battery Usage section breaks down battery 
percentage and, optionally, battery usage times, by app

Solution: You can deactivate Background App Refresh for all apps by following these steps:
	
1.	
On the Home screen, tap Settings to open the Settings app.
	
2.	
Tap General to open the General screen.
	
3.	
Tap Background App Refresh to open the Background App 
Refresh screen.
	
4.	
Tap the Background App Refresh switch to Off, as shown in 
Figure 10-5).
You Want to Prevent a Specific App from Running in the 
Background
By regularly examining the battery usage of your apps – both as an overall percentage 
and as total time onscreen and in the background – you will eventually come to recognize 
any battery hogs. In particular, you'll come to know which apps are using up your 
device battery by running background tasks. Turning off Background App Refresh for all 
apps seems like overkill in this case, particularly if it's just a single app that's causing a 
problem.
Solution: If you see that a particular app is using up a higher than average amount of 
battery power in background tasks, and if you don't feel it's necessary for the app to run in 
the background, you can deactivate Background App Refresh for just that app.
Here are the steps to follow:
	
1.	
On the Home screen, tap Settings to open the Settings app.
	
2.	
Tap General to open the General screen.
	
3.	
Tap Background App Refresh to open the Background App 
Refresh screen.
	
4.	
In the list of apps, tap the switch to Off beside the app you 
no longer want to operate in the background, as shown in 
Figure 10-6.

You Want Your iOS Device to Use Less Battery Power
When your iOS device battery is running low, or if you still have plenty of battery power 
but you know you'll need to use the device for a long stretch, it would be advantageous to 
configure the device to use less battery power on other tasks.
Solution: You learn quite a few techniques for preserving battery power in the next 
section. However, iOS offers an easy method for reducing the overall power consumption 
of your device. It's called Low Power Mode and it saves battery life by doing the following:
• 
Turning off Background App Refresh
• 
Disabling the Mail app's push feature (where the app checks for 
new mail automatically)
• 
Deactivating all automatic content downloads
• 
Preventing all automatic app upgrade
• 
Disabling a few visual effects
• 
Dimming the screen
iOS asks if you want to switch to Lower Power mode when the battery level falls to 20 
percent, as shown in Figure 10-7. (This message appears again when the level falls to 10 
percent.) Tap Low Power Mode to activate this feature.
Figure 10-6.  You can disable Background App Refresh for an individual app that's been 
using up too much battery power while running in the background

Chapter 10 ■ Repairing Battery and Charging Problems
137
To activate Low Power Mode manually, follow these steps:
	
1.	
On the Home screen, tap Settings to open the Settings app.
	
2.	
Tap Battery to open the Battery screen.
	
3.	
Tap the Low Power Mode switch to On, as shown in Figure 10-8.  
Note that you can tell when this feature is active by looking at 
the battery icon, which turns yellow during Low Power Mode.
■
■Note   With Low Power mode on, iOS automatically configures your device to auto-lock 
in 30 seconds and it disables the Auto-Lock setting.

You Want to Use as Little Battery Power as Possible
If battery power is scarce, there's no power outlet in sight, but you really need to use your 
iOS device, then you need to minimize the amount of battery power the device uses.
Solution: Here are a few suggestions to try that should help you to reduce your device's 
battery consumption to a minimal, while still retaining some functionality:
• 
Deactivate Background App Refresh. When you're desperate 
for juice, you probably don't need your apps working in the 
background. See the section "You want to prevent all your 
apps from running in the background," to learn how to turn off 
Background App Refresh. As an alternative, consider leaving that 
switch on but turning off Background App Refresh for individual 
apps (particularly active apps such as Facebook and Gmail); see 
the section "You want to prevent a specific app from running in 
the background."
• 
Turn on Low Power Mode. Don't wait until your battery level falls 
to 20 percent, which is when iOS automatically offers to turn on 
Low Power Mode for you. Turn it on manually earlier to increase 
battery life. I showed you how to activate Low Power Mode by 
hand in the section "You want your iOS device to use less battery 
power."
• 
Dim the screen. The touchscreen drains a lot of battery power, 
so dimming it reduces the amount of power used. On the Home 
screen, tap Settings, tap Display & Brightness, and then drag the 
Brightness slider to the left to dim the screen. Also, tap the Auto-
Brightness switch to Off, as shown in Figure 10-9.
• 
Slow the auto-check on your email. Having your email 
frequently poll the server for new messages eats up your battery. 
Set it to check every hour or, ideally, set it to Manual check if you 
can. To do this, tap Settings, tap Mail, tap Accounts, and then 
tap Fetch New Data. In the Fetch section, tap either Hourly or 
Manually.
Figure 10-9.  Dim the screen to the lowest brightness that lets you still read the screen, and 
turn off the Auto-Brightness feature

Chapter 10 ■ Repairing Battery and Charging Problems
139
• 
Turn off push. If you're not using Low Power Mode and if you 
have an iCloud or Exchange account, consider turning off the 
push feature to save battery power. Tap Settings, tap Mail, tap 
Accounts, and then tap Fetch New Data. In the Fetch New Data 
screen, tap the Push switch to Off, and in the Fetch section, tap 
Manually. See Figure 10-10.
• 
Minimize the number of apps you run. If you won't be able to 
charge your iOS device for a while, avoid background chores, such 
as playing music; or secondary chores, such as organizing your 
contacts. If your only goal is to read all your email, stick to that 
until it's done because you don't know how much time you have.
• 
Make sure Auto-Lock is working. You don't want your iOS device 
using up battery power while it's idle, so make sure Auto-Lock is 
on the job. Open Settings, tap Display & Brightness, tap Auto-
Lock, and then tap a short time interval (such as 1 Minute on the 
iPhone or 2 Minutes on the iPad).
• 
Put your iOS device into sleep mode manually, if necessary. If 
you are interrupted – for example, the pizza delivery guy shows 
up on time – don't wait for your iOS device to put itself to sleep 
because those few seconds or minutes use precious battery time. 
Instead, put your device to sleep manually right away by pressing 
the Sleep/Wake button.
• 
Turn off Wi-Fi if you don't need it. When Wi-Fi is on, it regularly 
checks for available wireless networks, which drains the battery. If 
you don't need to connect to a wireless network, turn off Wi-Fi to 
conserve energy. Open Settings, tap Wi-Fi, and then tap the Wi-Fi 
switch to Off.
• 
Turn off cellular data if you don't need it. Your iPhone or 
cellular-enabled iPad constantly looks for nearby cellular towers 
to maintain the signal, which can use up battery power in a hurry. 
If you're surfing on a Wi-Fi network, you don't need cellular data, 
so turn it off. Open Settings, tap Cellular, and then tap the Cellular 
Data switch to Off.
Figure 10-10.  Turn off Push to ensure that this background task doesn't eat up your 
battery

Chapter 10 ■ Repairing Battery and Charging Problems
140
• 
Turn off GPS if you don't need it. When GPS is on, the receiver 
exchanges data with the GPS system regularly, which uses up 
battery power. If you don't need the GPS feature for the time 
being, turn off the GPS antenna. Open Settings, tap Privacy, tap 
Location Services, and then tap the Location Services switch to 
Off.
• 
Turn off Bluetooth if you don't need it. When Bluetooth is 
running, it constantly checks for nearby Bluetooth devices, and 
this drains the battery. If you aren't using any Bluetooth devices, 
turn off Bluetooth to save energy. Open Settings, tap Bluetooth, 
and then tap the Bluetooth switch to Off.
■
■Note   If you don't need all four of the device antennae — Wi-Fi, cellular, GPS, and 
Bluetooth — for a while, a faster way to turn them off is to switch your iOS device to 
airplane mode. Either open Settings and then tap the Airplane Mode switch to On, or swipe 
up from the bottom to reveal the Control Center and then tap the Airplane Mode icon.
Troubleshooting Other Battery Problems
I'll close this chapter with a quick look at two more solutions to battery-related problems.
You Want to Maximize your Battery's Lifespan
It's important to maximize battery life on days when you don't have nearby power, but it's 
also important to ensure that you maximize your battery's entire lifespan.
Solution: The lithium-ion (li-on) battery in your iOS device is much more forgiving 
than older battery technologies such as nickel-cadmium (NiCad). With just a few simple 
techniques and precautions, you can ensure that your battery gives good performance 
throughout the life of your iOS device:
• 
Minimize the number of cycles the battery has to charge. Your 
iOS device battery is designed to maintain up to 80 percent of 
its original capacity after 500 complete discharge and charge 
cycles. Discharging down to zero percent and recharging counts 
as one cycle, discharging to 50 percent and recharging counts as 
half a cycle, and so on. Your iOS device will reach that 500-cycle 
mark slower if you plug it into a power source as often as it’s 
convenient.
• 
Use the battery. Don't think, however, that you'll keep the battery 
pristine by never using it. Li-on batteries require regular use or 
they'll refuse to charge.

Chapter 10 ■ Repairing Battery and Charging Problems
141
• 
Don't cycle the battery. Cycling – also called reconditioning or 
recalibrating – a battery means letting it completely discharge 
and then fully recharging it again. This was important in earlier 
battery technologies, but not with the Li-on battery in your iOS 
device. Letting the battery percentage drop to around 50 percent 
before recharging seems to be the sweet spot for maximizing 
battery life.
• 
Avoid temperature extremes. Exposing your iOS device to 
extremely hot or cold temperatures reduces the long-term 
effectiveness of the battery. Try to keep your iOS device at a 
reasonable temperature.
• 
Try not to drop your iOS device. Dropping the device can 
damage the battery, resulting in poor battery performance or 
even eventual failure.
• 
Use a high-quality charger. Cheap chargers can damage 
batteries beyond repair. Either use the charger that came with 
your iOS device, or use a third-party charger that was designed to 
work with your specific make and model of iOS device.
• 
Don't store your iOS device at full charge. If you won't be using 
your iOS device for a few weeks, or even longer, you'll likely 
be tempted to give it a full charge before putting it in storage. 
However, for longer life, it's better to store the device with the 
battery partially discharged – to, say, between 40 and 60 percent.
■
■Caution   It's even more important not to store your iOS device with its battery fully 
discharged. This can damage the battery to the point where it won't charge at all when you 
plug the device back in.
Your Battery Won't Charge
When you plug your iOS device into a power outlet, you might find that it does not charge.
Solution: If you find that your battery won't charge, here are some possible solutions:
• 
If the iOS device is plugged in to a computer to charge via the USB 
port, it may be that the computer has gone into standby. Waking 
the computer should solve the problem.
• 
The USB port might not be transferring enough power. For 
example, the USB ports on most keyboards and hubs don't offer 
much in the way of power. If you have your iOS device plugged 
in to a USB port on a keyboard or hub, plug it in to a USB port on 
your Mac or PC.

Chapter 10 ■ Repairing Battery and Charging Problems
142
• 
Attach the USB cable to the USB power adapter, and then plug the 
adapter in to a power outlet.
• 
Double-check all connections to make sure everything is plugged 
in properly.
• 
Try another Lightning cable if you have one.
• 
If the iOS device hasn't been charged in a long time, its battery 
might have gone into sleep mode to protect itself from long-term 
damage. In this case, it will take a few minutes – perhaps as long 
as ten minutes – before the battery wakes up and starts charging 
in the normal manner.
If none of these suggestions solves the problem, you may need to send your iOS 
device in for service.

CHAPTER 11
Getting Around  
Accessibility Issues
The promise of an iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch is information at your fingertips. But what 
if mobility challenges make it difficult to control your hands, much less your fingertips? 
What if visual challenges make it hard to even see the information? Whether you’ve had 
to overcome physical disabilities since you were young or you’re discovering new physical 
limitations almost daily as you get older, that doesn’t mean you have to be shut out of 
the digital device revolution. True, iOS devices can be difficult or impossible to use if 
you have visual, aural, or physical challenges. But that’s only because the default settings 
seem to have been chosen to benefit twenty-somethings in perfect health. The good 
news is that you don’t have to settle for these defaults. iOS is chock full of useful settings, 
options, and techniques that can turn any device from being a pain (literally, in some 
cases) to use, to a pleasure (at least relatively speaking). In this chapter, I take you through 
various problems related to using an iOS device while dealing with visual, hearing, and 
physical limitations, and you learn how to configure iOS to enable you to work around 
those limitations and get the most out of your device.
Working Around Visual Challenges
Those of you who are no longer spring chickens (or even summer chickens, for that 
matter) know one thing for certain: the older you get, the worse your eyesight becomes. 
Sure, you can ramp up your eyeglass prescription or invest in extra-strength reading 
glasses, but even that may not be enough when it comes to reading text and deciphering 
icons on your iOS device screen. And, of course, if your eyesight problems go beyond 
simple afflictions such as farsightedness or astigmatism, then a change of eyewear isn’t 
going to help you make sense of what’s happening on your screen.
Whatever the source of your visual challenges, you can’t work with iOS if you can’t 
see what iOS is trying to show you onscreen. Fortunately, you can put iOS to work, 
making it easier to see text, icons, and images. As you learn in this section, iOS offers a 
number of tools for enlarging screen items, making things easier to see, reducing visual 
distractions, and even hearing audio translations of what’s on the screen.

Chapter 11 ■ Getting Around Accessibility Issues 
144
You Want to Make Text Easier to Read
If your [20/20] vision is available only in hindsight, you may be asking yourself a simple 
question: Why does everything on my device screen look so tiny? The icons are miniature, 
the buttons are minute, and the text is miniscule.
Solution: I’m happy to report that these things are not set in stone (electronically 
speaking). iOS offers several settings that can enlarge what you see on your screen, or 
make it clearer. Follow these steps to modify some or all of these settings:
	
1.	
On the Home screen, tap Settings to open the Settings app.
	
2.	
Tap General to display the General screen.
	
3.	
Tap Accessibility to display the Accessibility screen.
	
4.	
Tap Display Accommodations and then tap Reduce White 
Point to On to make whites less intense.
	
5.	
Tap Larger Text, then use the slider to set the text size 
you’d prefer (see Figure 11-1). You can also tap the Larger 
Accessibility Sizes switch to On to take advantage of apps that 
support a feature called Dynamic Type, which enables the 
apps to resize text according to the slider value you set.
	
6.	
Tap Bold Text to On to render all screen text in an easier-to-
see bold font.
Figure 11-1.  You can use the Larger Text settings to increase the text size used by iOS and 
some apps

Chapter 11 ■ Getting Around Accessibility Issues 
145
Note iOS requires you to restart your device to put the Bold Text setting into effect.
	
7.	
Tap Button Shapes to On to apply a fill color to all buttons (for 
example, see the General button in Figure 11-2), which make 
them easier to see and tap.
	
8.	
Tap Increase Contrast to improve overall screen contrast. 
Tap Reduce Transparency On to minimize transparency and 
blur effects; tap Darken Colors on to make non-white colors 
darker.
	
9.	
Tap Reduce Motion and then tap the Reduce Motion switch to 
On to tell iOS to use fewer user interface motion effects, which 
can make it easier to follow what’s happening onscreen.
	
10.	
Tap the On/Off Labels switch to On to supplement each On/
Off switch with a 1 that appears when the switch is on, or a 0 
that appears when the switch is Off, as shown in Figure 11-3. 
This is useful if you have trouble distinguishing between the 
On and Off states of an iOS switch.
Figure 11-2.  Activate the Button Shapes setting to apply a fill that shows the shape of 
buttons, such as the General button shown here
Figure 11-3.  When the On/Off Labels setting is activated, you see a 1 in a switch that’s set 
to On, and a 0 in a switch that’s set to Off

You Want a Quick Way to Zoom in on the Screen
You may find that although you can make out most of the items on the screen, the 
occasional icon or bit of text is just too diminutive to decipher. Some of the settings 
mentioned in the previous section might help, but they affect all of iOS, which might be 
overkill.
Solution: You could always grab a nearby magnifying glass to get a closer look at the 
section you can’t make out, but iOS offers an electronic version of the same thing. It’s 
called Zoom, and it enables you to see a magnified portion of the screen. Here’s how you 
enable it:
	
1.	
On the Home screen, tap Settings to open the Settings app.
	
2.	
Tap General to display the General screen.
	
3.	
Tap Accessibility to display the Accessibility screen.
	
4.	
Tap Zoom to display the Zoom screen.
	
5.	
Tap the Zoom switch to On, as shown in Figure 11-4. iOS adds 
the Zoom window, within which the underlying screen text 
and elements are magnified.
Here are some pointers for using the Zoom window:
• 
To toggle the Zoom window off and on, double-tap the screen 
with three fingers.
• 
To move the Zoom window, drag the oval handle that appears in 
the middle of its bottom border.
• 
To move the screen within the Zoom window, drag three fingers 
inside the window.
• 
To adjust the magnification, double-tap the screen with three 
fingers and then drag on the screen with three fingers.
• 
To zoom the entire screen instead of just a portion of it, return to 
the Accessibility settings, tap Zoom, tap Zoom Region, and then 
tap Full Screen Zoom.
Figure 11-4.  Tap the Zoom switch to On to see the Zoom window, which magnifies a 
portion of the screen

Chapter 11 ■ Getting Around Accessibility Issues 
147
■
■Note   By default, Zoom automatically magnifies that portion of the screen that has the 
focus (that is, the portion of the screen with whatever control you’re currently working with). 
If you find this jarring, you can disable it by displaying the Zoom screen and tapping the 
Follow Focus switch to Off.
You Want to Hear What’s Shown on the Screen
If you find that you’re really having trouble making out what’s on the screen, you might 
prefer to have the screen text read to you.
Solution: iOS comes with an assistive technology called VoiceOver that can help. 
VoiceOver’s job is to read aloud whatever text appears in the current screen or dialog. 
VoiceOver also does many other things, including the following:
• 
Tells you the name of the current app, as well as the name of the 
app’s current screen or dialog.
• 
Tells you the name of the control that currently has the focus, the 
type of control (for example, a switch), and the control’s current 
state (for example, On).
• 
Echoes your most recent keystroke. For example, if you press 
Delete to delete a character, VoiceOver says "Delete."
• 
Tells you the text of the current item, such as a text message.
Follow these steps to activate VoiceOver:
	
1.	
On the Home screen, tap Settings to open the Settings app.
	
2.	
Tap General to display the General screen.
	
3.	
Tap Accessibility to display the Accessibility screen.
	
4.	
Tap VoiceOver to display the VoiceOver screen.
	
5.	
Tap the VoiceOver switch to On, as shown in Figure 11-5. 
VoiceOver describes the current screen, including the alert 
button that Settings displays to ask you to confirm.
	
6.	
Tap OK twice.

Chapter 11 ■ Getting Around Accessibility Issues 
148
■
■Note   VoiceOver overs an extensive collection of customization settings that enable you 
to control how verbose VoiceOver is; whether you want to hear sound effects; whether you 
want to hear characters, words, or both when typing; and more. You’ll find all these settings 
on the VoiceOver screen.
Note that activating VoiceOver changes how you use the iOS interface as follows:
• 
Tap a screen item to select it and have VoiceOver tell you its name 
and optionally its state or text. iOS places a black border around 
the item to show you that it’s selected. For an example, see the 
Accessibility button in Figure 11-5.
• 
To run, activate, or choose a screen item that you’ve already 
selected, double-tap it.
• 
To scroll, slide three fingers on the screen.
You Want to Use your iOS Device to Magnify Real-World 
Items
The Camera app comes with a zoom feature that, by spreading your fingers on the screen, 
lets you see a magnified version of the current frame. Besides being a useful photography 
feature, the zoom is handy for getting a closer look at items in the real world, such as tiny 
text or far-off signs. Unfortunately, the spread gesture isn’t easy to use if you also have 
mobility challenges.
Solution: iOS offers a Magnifier tool that automatically launches the Camera app and 
activates its zoom feature. Here are the steps to follow to enable Magnifier:
	
1.	
On the Home screen, tap Settings to open the Settings app.
	
2.	
Tap General to display the General screen.
	
3.	
Tap Accessibility to display the Accessibility screen.
	
4.	
Tap Magnifier to display the Magnifier screen.
	
5.	
Tap the Magnifier switch to On, as shown in Figure 11-6.
Figure 11-5.  Tap the VoiceOver switch to On to hear what’s displayed on the screen

Chapter 11 ■ Getting Around Accessibility Issues 
149
■
■Tip   If you find the zoomed screen too dark or too light at times, you can configure iOS 
to adjust automatically. In the Magnifier screen, tap the Auto-Brightness switch to On.
With Magnifier activated, you invoke it by triple-pressing the Home button.
Overcoming Physical Challenges
Using your iOS device may seem at first blush to be more of a mental exercise. After all, 
you spend lots of time in front of the screen reading things, looking at things, and thinking 
about things.
However, if you mapped out your device time, you’d almost certainly find that you 
spend great chunks of time on physical tasks: typing, tapping, double-tapping, and all the 
gestures – swiping, sliding, pinching, spreading, and so on – that are needed to make your 
device do your bidding.
This surprisingly physical side of iOS means that if you have physical challenges of 
your own, you may find it hard to perform certain tasks (and a few may be pretty much 
impossible). Fortunately, it doesn’t have to be that way. iOS has quite a few settings 
and tools that either make using your device less of a burden or that enable you to work 
around any problems you might encounter.
Double-Clicking the Home Button Doesn’t Display the 
Multitasking Screen
You switch between apps in iOS by double-clicking the Home button to open the 
multitasking screen, swiping until the app you want to switch to comes into view, and 
then tapping the app. Switching between apps is much more difficult if you can’t access 
the multitasking screen.
Figure 11-6.  Tap the Magnifier switch to On to easily use the Camera app’s zoom feature 
to get a closer look at real-world items

Chapter 11 ■ Getting Around Accessibility Issues 
150
Solution: If double-clicking the Home button doesn’t display the multitasking screen, 
you might be taking too long between each press, so try a faster double-click.
If that’s a persistent problem for you, you can slow down the Home-click speed. Here 
are the steps to follow:
	
1.	
On the Home screen, tap Settings to open the Settings app.
	
2.	
Tap General to display the General screen.
	
3.	
Tap Accessibility to display the Accessibility screen.
	
4.	
Tap Home Button to display the Home Button screen.
	
5.	
Tap Slow, as shown in Figure 11-7. iOS flashes the Slow option 
and vibrates the device at the new Home-click speed.
	
6.	
If you find that speed still causes problems, try using the 
Slowest speed, instead.
■
■Tip   Once you get your Home button clicking problem solved, you can make your 
favorite accessibility tool easier to use by configuring iOS to launch it when you triple-click 
the Home button. Open Settings, tap General, tap Accessibility, and then tap Accessibility 
Shortcut (it’s at the bottom of the screen). Tap one of the assistive technologies — such as 
VoiceOver or Zoom — in the list that appears. You can now invoke that tool by triple-clicking 
Home.
Figure 11-7.  If you’re having trouble getting iOS to recognize Home button double-clicks, 
try the Slow speed

151
You Find It Difficult to Unlock Your Device Using Touch ID
You learned in Chapter 8, "Protecting Your Device," that you can use Touch ID to unlock 
your iOS device (see "You Want to Unlock Your Device with Your Fingerprint"). In iOS 
9 and earlier, you unlocked the device by resting a digit with a saved fingerprint on 
the Home button. In iOS 10, however, you now have to press the Home button with 
that finger. You might find that a physical limitation makes it difficult to perform this 
technique.
Solution: You can tell iOS to allow a finger resting on the Home button to unlock your 
device. Here are the steps to follow:
	
1.	
On the Home screen, tap Settings to open the Settings app.
	
2.	
Tap General to display the General screen.
	
3.	
Tap Accessibility to display the Accessibility screen.
	
4.	
Scroll down and tap Home Button to display the Home Button 
screen.
	
5.	
Tap the Rest Finger to Open switch to On, as shown in 
Figure 11-8.
You’re Getting Unwanted Keystrokes When You Type
If you want to enter a key multiple times, you can tap the key as many times as you need. 
However, when you press and hold a key, iOS assumes you want to enter that key multiple 
times. iOS first accepts the initial keystroke and then waits briefly (about half a second) to 
see whether you leave the key held down. If you do, iOS accepts multiple versions of the 
key until you release it.
These are useful techniques if, say, you’re using the arrow keys to navigate a 
document or the Backspace key to delete a number of characters. They’re decidedly not 
useful if you have mobility challenges that cause you to frequently bounce your finger on 
a key or hold down a key that you meant to press only once.

Solution: If you tend to press keys multiple times or hold keys down too long, the Key 
Repeat feature lets you filter out the extra characters that appear in these situations.
To use this feature, follow these steps to activate and configure it:
	
1.	
On the Home screen, tap Settings to open the Settings app.
	
2.	
Tap General to display the General screen.
	
3.	
Tap Accessibility to display the Accessibility screen.
	
4.	
Tap Keyboard to display the Keyboard screen.
	
5.	
Tap Key Repeat to display the Key Repeat screen.
	
6.	
If you don’t want iOS to repeat characters when you press and 
hold a key, tap the Key Repeat switch to Off. Otherwise, tap 
this switch to On, as shown in Figure 11-9.
	
7.	
If Key Repeat is On, use the Key Repeat Interval setting to 
set the amount of time that iOS waits between repeated 
keystrokes.
	
8.	
If Key Repeat is On, use the Delay Until Repeat setting to set 
the amount of time that iOS waits after the initial keystroke to 
begin repeating the keystroke.

iOS Sometimes Misinterprets or Does Not Recognize 
Your Taps
The touchscreen on your iOS device is a marvel of modern electronics: sensitive, 
versatile, and powerful. It’s hard to imagine using iOS without it, so perhaps that’s why 
touchscreen problems are so frustrating. If you find it difficult to control your hands, or if 
your dexterity isn’t what it used to be, then you might run up against one or more of the 
following touchscreen troubles:
• 
If you tend to keep your tapping finger on the screen a bit too 
long, iOS interprets the gesture as a tap-and-hold rather than a 
simple tap.
• 
If you tend to bounce your tapping finger on the screen, iOS 
interprets the gesture as multiple taps rather than a single tap.
• 
If you tend to move your tapping finger along the screen, iOS 
interprets the gesture as a slide or swipe rather than a tap.
Solution: iOS comes with several so-called touch accommodations that you can activate 
and adjust as needed to get your taps recognized and/or interpreted correctly. Follow 
these steps:
	
1.	
On the Home screen, tap Settings to open the Settings app.
	
2.	
Tap General to display the General screen.
	
3.	
Tap Accessibility to display the Accessibility screen.
	
4.	
Tap Touch Accommodations Keys to display the Touch 
Accommodations screen.
	
5.	
If you tend to keep your tapping finger on the screen too long, 
tap the Hold Duration switch to On, as shown in Figure 11-10,  
and then use the Seconds setting to specify how long iOS 
should allow you to hold the screen before it assumes you’re 
performing a tap-and-hold gesture.
Figure 11-10.  Tap Hold Duration to On to prevent long presses from being interpreted as 
tap-and-holds

Chapter 11 ■ Getting Around Accessibility Issues 
154
	
6.	
If you tend to bounce your tapping finger on the screen, tap 
the Ignore Repeat switch to On, and then use the Seconds 
setting to specify how long iOS should wait before it interprets 
the gesture as multiple taps rather than a single tap.
	
7.	
If you tend to move your tapping finger along the screen, 
tell iOS to interpret the gesture as a tap rather than a slide by 
tapping one of the following in the Tap Assistance section:
• 
Use Initial Touch Location. Tap this setting to use the 
position where your tapping finger first touches the screen as 
the tap location.
• 
Use Final Touch Location. Tap this setting to use the 
position where your tapping finger stops or leaves the screen 
as the tap location.
Surmounting Hearing Challenges
If your hearing has deteriorated over the years, or if you have a hearing impairment in one 
or both ears, detecting device sounds and enjoying music and movies can be a challenge. 
Fortunately, help is at hand. iOS has a few settings and tools that you can configure to 
help or work around your hearing issues.
Headphone Sounds Are Unbalanced
Sometimes, hearing troubles in one ear are particularly bad. Adjusting the device volume 
is problematic in these cases, because turning up the sound enough to hear things in your 
bad ear can make those sounds too loud in your other ear.
Solution: iOS can help by enabling you to balance the sound in each ear. That is, you can 
turn up the sound for your bad ear and/or turn down the sound for your good ear.
Here are the steps to follow:
	
1.	
On the Home screen, tap Settings to open the Settings app.
	
2.	
Tap General to display the General screen.
	
3.	
Tap Accessibility to display the Accessibility screen.
	
4.	
Under the Hearing section, use the slider shown in Figure 11-11 
to adjust the balance between the left and right channels.
Figure 11-11.  To compensate for poor hearing in one ear, use this slider to adjust the audio 
balance between the left and right channels

Chapter 11 ■ Getting Around Accessibility Issues 
155
You Can’t Hear Alerts
When iOS displays a notification for a text message or incoming email message, it often 
displays a banner for a few seconds and plays a sound. If you’re not near your device to 
see the banner, and if your hearing is impaired, then you might easily miss the alert.
Solution: On your iPhone (this feature isn’t available on other iOS devices), you can tell 
iOS to flash the camera’s LED light a few times, which gives you a visual signal that an 
alert has occurred.
Follow these steps to set this up:
	
1.	
On the Home screen, tap Settings to open the Settings app.
	
2.	
Tap General to display the General screen.
	
3.	
Tap Accessibility to display the Accessibility screen.
	
4.	
In the Hearing section, tap LED Flash for Alerts.
	
5.	
Tap the LED Flash for Alerts switch to On, as shown in 
Figure 11-12.
	
6.	
If you also want iOS to flash the LED even when you have the 
Ring/Silent switch set to Silent, tap the Flash on Silent switch 
to On.

CHAPTER 12
Troubleshooting Other  
iOS Problems
So far in this book you have learned not only a number of general problem-solving 
techniques, but also how to troubleshoot and work around a wide variety of issues. To 
make it easier to find these problems (or, in many cases, to prevent problems before they 
happen), these issues have been focused and grouped according to specific topic areas. 
These have included cellular, Wi-Fi, apps, web browsing, email, phone calls, cameras, 
photos, device protection, privacy, the battery, and accessibility. That's a wide-ranging 
list, but there are plenty of iOS troubles that don't it fit into any of these categories.
The purpose of this chapter is to gather together a selection of the most common of 
these miscellaneous problems, annoyances, and head-scratchers, and to provide solution 
and workarounds to complete your iOS troubleshooting education.
Troubleshooting Miscellaneous Problems
I'll begin this chapter with a look at a few miscellaneous problems that can make your iOS 
device easier to use and more efficient.
You Find It Difficult to Reach Items at the Top of the iP-
hone Screen
The large height of the iPhone 6, 6s, and 7 (not to mention their even bigger Plus versions) 
means that even people with average-size hands can find it quite a stretch to reach items 
at or near the top of the screen when they're using the device one-handed.
Solution: Double-tap the Home button, by which I mean you lightly tap the button 
rather than firmly pressing it. This slides the current screen's contents down about half 
way, making it much easier to access those items at top, especially when you're using the 
phone one-handed. To push the screen back up, either double-tap the Home button once 
again or tap in the blank area above the screen contents (you can also wait about eight 
seconds and the screen will restore itself automatically).

Chapter 12 ■ Troubleshooting Other iOS Problems 
158
Double-Tapping the Home Button Doesn't Do Anything
In the previous section you learned that you can reach items at the top of the big iPhone 6 
(and later) screen by double-tapping the Home button. However, you might find that this 
technique doesn't work for you.
Solution: Here are a few troubleshooting techniques to try:
• 
Remember that this feature is only available on the iPhone, not 
the iPad or iPod touch. And, as of this writing, the only iPhone 
models that support this feature are the 6, 6 Plus, 6s, 6s Plus, 7, 
and 7 Plus.
• 
If you see the multitasking screen (that is, the screen that shows 
all your running or recently run apps), it means you're double-
clicking the Home button rather than double-tapping it. Two light 
taps are all you need.
• 
This feature is called Reachability and it's an accessibility setting. 
If it doesn't work for you, it might mean that the setting has been 
turned off. To check, follow these steps:
	
1.	
On the Home screen, tap Settings to open the Settings app.
	
2.	
Tap General to open the General screen.
	
3.	
Tap Accessibility to open the Accessibility screen.
	
4.	
Tap the Reachability switch to On, as shown in Figure 12-1.
Figure 12-1.  Make sure the Reachability setting is On to enable Home button double-
tapping

Your iOS Device Disturbs You at Inconvenient Times
If you're in a meeting, at a movie, or going to sleep, you don't want your iOS device 
disturbing the peace with incoming phone calls or alerts. Most people handle this by 
activating Airplane mode, which turns off all the antennas on the device. That ensures 
you're distraction free for a while, but it suffers from a major drawback: Without any 
working antennas, your device can't communicate with the world, so it doesn't download 
messages or perform any other online activities. That might be what you want, but it's less 
than optimum if you're expecting something important. Plus, you have to remember to 
activate Airplane mode, something you can't always do when you're busy.
Solution: Configure Do Not Disturb mode, which silences all device distractions – 
including Notification Center alerts and phone calls – but keeps your device online so that it 
can continue to receive data. That way, when you're ready to get back to the action, all your 
new data is already on your device, so you can get back up to speed quickly. To activate Do 
Not Disturb, open Settings, tap Do Not Disturb, and then tap the Manual switch to On.
You can get the most out of Do Not Disturb by configuring it to suit the way you work. 
Here are the steps to follow:
	
1.	
On the Home screen, tap Settings to open the Settings app.
	
2.	
Tap Do Not Disturb to display the Do Not Disturb screen.
	
3.	
To set a time to automatically activate and deactivate Do 
Not Disturb, tap the Scheduled switch to On, as shown in 
Figure 12-2. You then tap the From/To control; use From to set 
the start time and use To to set the end time, then tap Back to 
return to the Do Not Disturb screen.
■
■Note   Rather than scheduling Do Not Disturb mode, you can invoke it at any time by 
following steps 1 and 2 to display the Do Not Disturb screen, then tapping the Manual 
switch to On.
Figure 12-2.  Tap the Scheduled switch to On and then set a start and end time for Do Not 
Disturb

Chapter 12 ■ Troubleshooting Other iOS Problems 
160
	
4.	
If you want to allow certain calls even when Do Not Disturb is 
activated, tap Allow Calls From and then tap who you want to 
get through: Everyone, No One, Favorites (that is, anyone in 
the Phone app's Favorites list), or a particular contact group.
	
5.	
If you want Do Not Disturb to allow a call through when 
the same person calls twice within three minutes, leave the 
Repeated Calls switch in the On position. If you don't want to 
allow this exception, tap the Repeated Calls switch to Off.
	
6.	
If you want Do Not Disturb to handle calls and notifications 
normally (that is, non-silently) when your device is unlocked, 
tap the Only While Device is Locked option (where Device is 
iPhone, iPad, or iPod).
The Onscreen Keyboard Clicks Are Driving You (and 
Everyone Near You) Crazy
By default, the iOS onscreen keyboard makes a clicking noise each time you tap a key. 
Apple must think this aural feedback is useful since the clicks are on by default, but I 
don't know anyone who doesn't find them annoying and purposeless. Even if you don't 
mind the incessant clicking, I guarantee that every person within earshot of your device is 
cursing you silently (or perhaps not so silently).
Solution: Turn off the keyboard clicks by following these steps:
	
1.	
On the Home screen, tap Settings to open the Settings app.
	
2.	
Tap Sounds to display the Sounds screen.
	
3.	
Tap the Keyboard Clicks switch to Off, as shown in Figure 12-3.
When You Type Two or More Spaces, iOS Always Adds a 
Period (.) Before the Spaces
This is actually, as the programmers say, a feature, not a bug. It's a built-in shortcut that 
enables you to end most sentences efficiently with a quick double-tap on the space key.
Figure 12-3.  To type blissfully noise free, tap the Keyboard Clicks switch to Off

Chapter 12 ■ Troubleshooting Other iOS Problems 
161
Solution: If you'd rather be able to enter multiple spaces without the period showing up, 
you can turn off the shortcut. Here are the steps to follow:
	
1.	
On the Home screen, tap Settings to open the Settings app.
	
2.	
Tap General to display the General screen.
	
3.	
Tap Keyboard to display the Keyboards screen.
	
4.	
Tap the "." Shortcut switch to Off, as shown in Figure 12-4.
You Can't Type in Another Language
Your iOS device is set up with a default keyboard appropriate to your location, and it also 
comes with a keyboard of Emoji symbols. If you want to type in another language such as 
Arabic, Greek, or Russian, there is no direct way to do it using the default keyboard.
Solution: You need to install a new keyboard layout for the language (or languages) you 
want to use. Here are the steps to follow:
	
1.	
On the Home screen, tap Settings to open the Settings app.
	
2.	
Tap General to display the General screen.
	
3.	
Tap Keyboard to display the Keyboards screen.
	
4.	
Tap Keyboards to open the Keyboards screen, which displays 
a list of installed keyboards.
	
5.	
Tap Add New Keyboard to display the Add New Keyboard 
screen.
	
6.	
Tap the keyboard layout you want to use.
Figure 12-4.  To type two spaces without getting a period (.), tap the "." Shortcut switch to Off

Chapter 12 ■ Troubleshooting Other iOS Problems 
162
To switch from one layout to another, display the onscreen keyboard and then tap 
and hold the Keyboard button (which is to the right of the 123 or ?123 button). This 
displays a list of the installed keyboards, as shown in Figure 12-5, and you then tap the 
layout you want to use.
Your Device Display Is Too Harsh for Night Use
Many of us keep our iOS device at our bedside to use as a clock or alarm. Dimming the 
display is a must for nighttime use, but for many people the screen colors are still too 
harsh and they can make it hard to get to sleep.
Solution: You can use the Night Shift feature to shift the screen colors toward the red end 
of the spectrum. This gives the screen a "warmer" feel overall, which makes it less harsh 
for night viewing and is more conducive to sleep.
Follow these steps to activate and configure Night Shift:
	
1.	
On the Home screen, tap Settings to open the Settings app.
	
2.	
Tap Display & Brightness to display the Display & Brightness 
screen.
	
3.	
Tap Night Shift to display the Night Shift screen.
	
4.	
To set a time to automatically activate and deactivate Night 
Shift, tap the Scheduled switch to On, as shown in Figure 12-6. 
You then tap the From/To control; use From to set the start 
time and use To to set the end time, then tap Back to return to 
the Night Shift screen.
Figure 12-5.  Tap and hold the Keyboard button to see a list of your installed keyboard 
layouts

163
■
■Note   Rather than scheduling Night Shift, you can invoke it at any time by following 
steps 1 to 3 to display the Night Shift screen, then tapping the Manually Enable Until 
Tomorrow switch to On.
	
5.	
Use the Color Temperature slider to adjust the screen colors to 
make them more warm (slide to the right) or less warm (slide 
to the left).
You Want to Control What Your Children See and Do on 
an iOS Device
If your children have access to your iOS device, or if they have devices of their own, then 
you might be a bit worried about some of the content they might be exposed to on the 
Web, on YouTube, or in iTunes. Similarly, you might not want them installing apps or 
giving away their current location.
Solution: For all those and similar parental worries, you can sleep better at night by 
activating the iOS parental controls. These controls restrict the content and activities that 
kids can see and do. Here's how to set them up:
	
1.	
On the Home screen, tap Settings. The Settings app appears.
	
2.	
Tap General. The General screen appears.
	
3.	
Tap Restrictions. The Restrictions screen appears.
	
4.	
Tap Enable Restrictions. iOS displays the Enable Restrictions 
screen, which you use to specify a four-digit code that you can 
use to make changes to the parental controls. (Note that this 
code is not the same as the passcode lock that I discuss earlier 
in this book; see Chapter 8, "Protecting Your Device.")
Figure 12-6.  Tap the Scheduled switch to On and then set a start and end time for Night Shift

Chapter 12 ■ Troubleshooting Other iOS Problems 
164
	
5.	
Tap the four-digit restrictions passcode and then retype the 
code. iOS returns you to the Restrictions screen and makes the 
controls available, as shown in Figure 12-7.
	
6.	
In the Allow section, for each app or task, tap the On/Off 
switch to allow or disallow your child to use the app or task.
	
7.	
Under Allowed Content, tap Ratings For and then tap the 
country with the ratings you want to use.
	
8.	
For each of the content controls – Music, Podcasts & News, 
Movies, TV Shows, Books, Apps, Siri, and Websites – tap the 
control and then tap the highest rating for the content you 
want your children to use.
	
9.	
If you don't want your children to make changes to certain 
settings, such as Location Services and Contacts, tap the 
corresponding setting types in the Privacy section and then 
tap Don't Allow Changes.
Figure 12-7.  Use the Restrictions screen to configure the parental controls you want to use

Chapter 12 ■ Troubleshooting Other iOS Problems 
165
	
10.	
If you don't want your children to make changes to the current 
Mail, Calendar, or Contacts account settings, tap Accounts 
under Allow Changes, and then tap Don't Allow Changes.
	
11.	
If you don't want your children to adjust the maximum 
volume limit you've set, tap Volume Limit, and then tap Don't 
Allow Changes.
■
■Tip   To set the maximum volume on the iOS device, open the Settings app, tap Music, 
tap Volume Limit, and then use the Max Volume slider to set the limit.
	
12.	
In the Game Center section, tap the On/Off switches to enable 
or disable multiplayer games, adding friends, and recording 
the screen.
Troubleshooting Connection and Syncing 
Problems
With most syncing running through iCloud these days, many people find they rarely 
have to connect their iOS device to their computer. However, if you don't have an iCloud 
account, then connecting to your computer and syncing through iTunes is required, so all 
the more reason to make sure things are working properly.
iTunes Doesn't See Your Device
When you connect your iOS device to your computer, iTunes should start and you should 
see the device in the Devices list. If iTunes doesn't start when you connect your device, or 
if iTunes is already running but the device doesn't appear in the Devices list, it means that 
iTunes doesn't recognize your device.
Solution: Here are some possible fixes:
• 
Trust the computer. You can't connect to iTunes until you've told 
iOS that you trust the computer that's running iTunes. On your 
device, tap Trust.
• 
Check the connections. Make sure the USB connector and the 
Lightning connector are fully seated.
• 
Try a different USB port. The port you're using might not work, 
so try another one. If you're using a port on a USB hub, try using 
one of the computer's built-in USB ports.
• 
Try a different cable. It's possible that the USB cable is defective, 
so try a different cable if you have one.

Chapter 12 ■ Troubleshooting Other iOS Problems 
166
• 
Restart your device. Press and hold the Sleep/Wake button for a 
few seconds until the device shuts down. Press and hold Sleep/
Wake again until you see the Apple logo.
• 
Restart your computer. This should reset the computer's USB 
ports, which might solve the problem.
• 
Check your iTunes version. You need at least iTunes version 
12.5.1 to work with iOS 10.
• 
Check your operating system version. On a Mac, your iOS 
device running iOS 10 requires OS X Mavericks (10.9) or later. On 
a Windows PC, your iOS device requires Windows 7.
iTunes Won't Sync Your Device
iTunes might see your iOS device, but it might refuse to sync the device.
Solution: It could be a couple of things. First, connect your device, switch to iTunes on 
your computer, and then click your device in the Devices list. On the Summary tab (see 
Figure 12-8), make sure the Automatically sync when this device is connected check box is 
selected (where device is iPhone, iPad, or iPod).
If that check box was already selected, then you need to delve a bit deeper to solve 
the mystery. Follow these steps:
	
1.	
Open the iTunes preferences:
• 
Mac. Click iTunes and then click Preferences.
• 
Windows. Click Edit and then click Preferences.
	
2.	
Click the Devices tab.
	
3.	
Deselect the Prevent iPods, iPhones, and iPads from syncing 
automatically check box.
	
4.	
Click OK to put the new setting into effect and enable 
automatic syncing once again.
Another possibility is that your iOS device is currently locked. That's not usually a 
problem for iTunes, but it sometimes gets confused by a locked device. The easy remedy 
is to disconnect the device, unlock it, and then connect it in again.
Figure 12-8.  Select the Automatically sync when this device is connected check box

Chapter 12 ■ Troubleshooting Other iOS Problems 
167
You Have Trouble Syncing Music or Videos
You may run into a problem syncing your music or videos to your iOS device.
Solution: The most likely culprit here is that your files are in a format that iOS can't read, 
such as WMA, MPEG-1, or MPEG-2. First, convert the files to a format that iOS does 
understand using converter software (such as Format Factory; see www.pcfreetime.com/). 
Then put them back on iTunes and try to sync again. This should solve the problem.
iOS-supported audio formats include AAC, Protected AAC, HE-AAC, MP3, MP3 VBR, 
Audible (formats 2, 3, and 4; Audible Enhanced Audio; AAX; and AAX+), Apple Lossless, 
AIFF, and WAV. iOS-supported video formats include H.264, MPEG-4, and Motion JPEG.
An App Opens Each Time You Connect Your Device
Each time you connect your iOS device to your computer, you might see the Photos app 
(on your Mac) or the AutoPlay dialog box (in Windows). This is certainly convenient if you 
actually want to send photos to your computer, but you might find that you do that only 
once in a blue moon. In that case, having to deal with iPhoto or a dialog box every time is 
frustrating and time consuming.
Solution: You can configure your computer not to pester you about getting photos from 
your iOS device.
■
■Note   Configuring your computer not to download photos from your iOS device means that 
in the future, you'll either need to reverse the setting to get photos or manually import them.
Here's how you set this up on your Mac:
	
1.	
Click Spotlight, type image, and then click Image Capture. The 
Image Capture application opens.
	
2.	
In the Devices list, click your iOS device.
	
3.	
At the bottom of the Devices pane, click the Connecting this 
camera opens menu, and then choose No application, as 
shown in Figure 12-9.
Figure 12-9.  In the Mac's Image Capture program, choose No application to prevent 
Photos from starting when you connect your iOS device

Chapter 12 ■ Troubleshooting Other iOS Problems 
168
	
4.	
Click Image Capture and then click Quit Image Capture. 
Image Capture saves the new setting and then shuts down. 
The next time you connect your iOS device, Photos ignores it.
Follow these steps to convince Windows not to open the AutoPlay dialog box each 
time you connect your iOS device:
	
1.	
Open the Default Programs window:
• 
Windows 10. In the taskbar's Search box, type default and 
then click Default Programs.
• 
Windows 8. In the Start screen, type default and then click 
Default Programs.
• 
Windows 7. Click Start and then click Default Programs to 
open the Default Programs window.
	
2.	
Click Change AutoPlay settings. The AutoPlay dialog box 
appears.
	
3.	
In the Devices section, open the list for your iOS device and 
choose Take no action, as shown in Figure 12-10.
	
4.	
Click Save. Windows saves the new setting. The next time 
you connect your iOS device, you won't be bothered by the 
AutoPlay dialog box.
Figure 12-10.  In the list for your iOS device, choose Take no action to prevent the AutoPlay 
dialog box from appearing when you connect your iOS device
