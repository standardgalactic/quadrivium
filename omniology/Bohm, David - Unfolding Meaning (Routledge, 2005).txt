Unfolding Meaning 
' ... to think diITerently - this thought must enter deeply into our 
intentions, actions, and so on - our whole being.' 
David Bohm in 'The Implicate Order: 
a new approach to reality' 
In Unfolding Meaning, David Bohm, one of the most provocative 
and original thinkers of our time, argues that there arc other ways of 
thinking to bring about a different, more harmonious reality. Our 
fragmented, mechanistic notion of order derives from the modem 
conception that our earth is only part, not - as it was with the Greeks 
- the centre, of the immense universe of material bodies. The 
implications of this idea permeate modem science and technology 
today and also our gcnernl attitude to life. 
The dialogue develops as an attempt to find another way of 
thinking; it is an exercise in unfolding some of the vagaries of 
thought, by forty-four peolc who gathered to meet with Professor 
Bohm to consider with him some of his ideas on a number of 
subjects: from implicate order to soma-significance, from fragmen ta­
t ion to wholeness. 
The late David Bohm was Emeritus Professor at Birkbeck 
College and a fellow of the Royal Society. His work in physics had 
led him to propose the idea of quantum potential, a means by which 
the view of universal, unbroken wholeness, implicit in relativity 
theory, might be understood in the context of the more abstract, 
fragmentary approach of quantum mechanics. Moreover. he was 
interested in the philosophical implications of quantum and relativity 
physics. He wrote many books including Wholenes.s and the 
Implicate Order and Thought as a Sy.stem (both published by 
Routledge).

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 
Teachers often comment that they learn as much from 
their students as they actually impart, but seldom does this 
sems to be the case from the point of view of the student. 
Occasionally though, a flow of increased understanding does 
take place between teacher and student. This tends to 
happen when the separation between those roles breaks 
down and a flow of dialogue imbued with mutual respect 
takes place. Then a true collaboration ocurs, and the result 
is something greater than might have come from the more 
usual, simple transference of information. 
Profesor David Bohm is one of those rare men who 
recognizes and enjoys this way of working- or, as he would 
put it, participating in a dance of the mind. It has ben a 
great privilege to have had the opportunity of sharing his 
thoughts and his company. 
I would like to take this opportunity to thank his wife 
Sarah Bohm whose enthusiastic encouragement helped to 
make the event upon which this book is based, such an 
enriching experience. I would also like to thank Peter 
Garett, the European co-ordinator of The Foundation of 
Universal 
Unity, 
{now 
the 
Emisary 
Foundation 
International) for organizing the event; 
the staff and 
management of the Three Ways Hotel for their remarkable 
care and skil in providing a setting that facilitated the 
smooth flow of our deliberations; Cliff Penwell, Mynda 
ltzigsohn, and especialy Lesley Wilson and Tuli Corbyn for 
their effom in helping to transcribe the very complicated 
conversations 
on 
the 
taped 
recordings, 
and 
Lindsay 
Rawlings for his contribution of the cover design and

Also David Bohm wishes to acknowledge the immense 
value of earlier discusions with J. Krishnamurti and with 
Dr. P. de Mare among others.

INTRODUCTION 
by 
Donald Factor 
Ideas, concepts and theories are the stuff of thought , and 
thought affects the world in pervasive ways. What we think 
about reality can alter our relationship to it, just as what we 
perceive in the world around us can alter our thoughts. 
Thought is the ground upon which our understanding rests. 
With thought we se the world and in a continuing proces 
learn to interact with that world. We can look beyond our 
raw perceptions and alter the course of our actions. We can 
solve problems; we can create new products, technologies, 
ways of dealing with our environment and with one another . 
But much of what we think remains hidden from our 
conscious awareneso;. Within our minds we cary a record of 
past experience, of lesoru learned, of incidents and details 
long forgotten. Our thoughts are coloured and conditioned 
by such limits as our language and our culture. We interpret 
our 
experience 
through 
a 
mixture 
of 
conscious 
and 
unconscious memories, imaginings and desires, and with 
these we organize our world. Often our thoughts, when 
acted upon, lead to une.xpected and sometimes unimagined 
results. They sem to contain unrecognized implications of 
meaning of which we knew nothing, and that appear in spite 
of what 
we 
might have thought was our 
complete 
understanding. How then might we evaluate our thought? 
How might we discover whether or not our mast cherished 
ideas are in fact valid and relevant to the circumstance 
before us? ·What do our thoughts mean? 
This bok is a record of an experiment in unfolding some 
of the vagaries of thought - an experiment conceived and 
developed during the course of a weekend of conversation 
between forty four people who gathered to meet with 
Pro/r David Bohm and to consider with him some of his 
ideas on a far-ranging list of subjects . 
Al had some 
familiarity with his work and an interest in looking further 

into 
iu 
implications. 
Many 
had 
attended 
various 
conferences, seminars and workshops where a leader, or an 
invited expert, either taught or guided the participanu 
toward an increased understanding of his or her area of 
expertise. Thi.s weekend turned out to be very different. 
David Bohm is Emeritus Profesor of Theoretical Physics 
at Birkbeck College, The University of London. His work in 
physics has ben predominantly concerned with the problem 
of motion and prŃ which relativity physics deals with but 
quantum theory does not. Out of this interest he proposed 
the idea of a quantum potential, a means by which the view 
of universal, unbroken wholenes.s, implicit in relativity 
theory, might be understood in the context of the more 
abstract, 
fragmentary approach of much of quantum 
mechanics. Hi.s theory of the implicate order, an approach 
whereby implicit potentials can be sen to unfold out of a 
universal, unbroken field into explicit phenomena before 
being re-enfolded, 
has provided a new and valuable 
interpretation of quantum mechanics, and has provided a 
basis not only for new insighu in physics but also for a whole 
range of other subjecu. 
For many years Profńr Bohm has ben especialy 
interested in the philosophical implications of quantum and 
relativity physics, and with discovering a metaphor that 
might make their meanings accesible to a general public 
unfamiliar with the mysteries of higher mathematics. His 
feeling 
has ben that this 
is important because the 
mechanistic 
world-view 
that 
sems 
to 
dominate 
contemporary science and society has led to a state of 
increasing fragmentation, both within the experience of 
individual human beings and in society as a whole. The fact 
that this world-view is incomplete, and that it has not ben 
widely recognized as such, has caused it to become bound up 
within a broad area of misunderstanding deriving largely 
from a misunderstanding of science in general, but alscJ -
and more importantly - from a general confwion regarding 
the nature of thought and of its relationship to reality. 
He has suggested that thought is, by nature, incomplete. 
Any thought, any idea, any theory, is simply a way of seing, 

a way of viewing an object from a particular vantage point. 
It may be useful, but that usefulnes.s is dependent upon 
particular 
circumstances -
the 
time, 
the 
place, 
the 
conditions to which it is applied. If our thoughts are taken to 
be 
final, 
to 
include 
all 
pibilities, 
to 
be 
exact 
representations of reality, then eventually we run up against 
conditions where they become irrelevant. If we hold to them 
in spite of their irrelevance, we are forı either to ignore the 
facts or to apply some sort of force to make them fit. In either 
case fragmentation is the result. 
Profes.sor Bohm's writings on universal wholenes, and his 
proposals concerning the implicate order have begun to have 
an influence on diverse disciplines. His ideas are central to 
what has become known as 'the holographic paradigm'. 
These ideas, which are explained and discused in the main 
text of this bok, have provided a new way of understanding 
a great many phenomena ranging from some of the problems 
of quantum physics to health care, social organization, 
religion, and the workings of the human mind itself. 
In order to provide an opportunity to inquire more deeply 
into some of his thoughts, The Foundation of Universal 
Unity invited Profesor Bohm to spend a weekend discusing 
these thoughts with a group of people of varying ages, 
nationalities and profesional background. The intention 
was to discover if, by careful attention, a new and more 
fruitful vision of the pibilities for a greater harmony in the 
individual and in society might arise. 
On the 11th of May, 1984, the group gathered at a small, 
country hotel 
in 
the 
Cotswold 
village of 
Mickleton, 
Gloucestershire, England. Profes.sor Bohm, accompanied by 
his wife Sarah, arived seeming tired and preocupied. This 
was to be his first experience of such a gathering. He had 
come prepared to give three talks, and to then develop his 
ideas with the group through question and answer semons. 
As 
the 
weekend 
unfolded, 
though, 
a 
very 
different 
experience began to emerge both for Profesor Bohm and for 
al the participants. 
The sesions developed an atmosphere of contained, 
mutual concern for the revelation of deeper insights. A spirit 

of friendship and respect between all those present emerged, 
and this quickly grew into a harmonious field where 
proposals of many sorts could be collectively investigated in 
safety 
and 
allowed 
to 
expand 
into 
new 
levels 
of 
understanding . 
A 
dialogue 
developed 
in 
which 
each 
participant was able to put aside his own views and listen to 
those of others. It became increasingly clear that no point of 
view was in itself complete, and that a collective proces of 
thought was the means by which understanding could be 
enriched. This fact be.came the focus of the group's attention. 
No conclusions were reached nor were any programs 
initiated; rather the appreciation of a continual unfoldment 
of new insights revealed through friendly conversation was 
sen to be the means by which an increase of harmony might 
appear. 
When such a pr is translated into print it tends to take 
on the appearance of a finished product. The atmosphere out 
of which it emerged disappears, leaving only the arguments 
by which the various speakers hope to win agreement. 
Abstracted from the context of their creation the ideas stand 
naked , vulnerable to judgement, to criticism, to mere 
acceptance or reje.ction. This of course, is one reason for 
preserving ideas in print. A5 Profesor Bohm suggests in the 
course of these discions, 'Ideas must be vulnerable.' 
The ideas considered in these pages should be sen as part 
of a work in progres. They represent a slice of a creative 
pr and they are presented not as conclusions but as an 
example of one way that new ideas might be raised, inquired 
into, and alowed to unfold further. They al.so introduce a 
new phase of Profesor Bohm's work, one in which the 
interactions between a group of individuals provide the focus 
of energy in which new meanings might be perceived, and 
where in his terms both the content and context of thought 
enfold each other, and unfold into new meanings and 
insights. 
In a conversation between forty five people there is much 
apparent clumsines. People do not share their thoughts 
aloud in perfect sentences of a sort that the reader of a book 
might ordinarily demand. There are many false starts, many 

incomplete proposals. Often in the course of these sesions, 
questions were raised, or statements made, that semed 
irrelevant; but just as often, these opened the way to new 
and deeper levels of understanding. 
In attempting to 
document the procedings I have tried to preserve as much as 
posible the flavour of the event. I have opted for a balance 
that might make the ideas inteligible, while preserving 
something of the flow of interaction between the participants 
that was central to the experience. I have used the term 
'Question' to mark the contributions by participants other 
than David Bohm, although only in the early stages of the 
dialogues did they particularly tend to take the form of 
questions. As the conversations progrd they became, 
simply, parts of the emerging whole. 
I have only ben able to include here the dialogues in 
which the entire group was present. In addition to these 
main discusions there were other sesions in which the larger 
group split into three smaller group.!i, and of course there 
were numerous more intimate conversations over meals, and 
so on. 


THE IMPLICATE ORDER 
A NEW APPROACH TO REALITY 
Profesor Bohm: Throughout history there has been a 
succesion of world views; that is, general notions of cosmic 
order, and of the nature of reality as a whole. Each of these 
views has exprÌ the esential spirit of its time, and each of 
them in its turn, has had profound efects on the individual, 
and on society as a whole, not only physically, but also 
psychologicaly and ethicaly . Thec;e effects were multiple in 
nature, but among them, one of the most significant is 
notions of universal order. 
ru begin by giving two examples of world views that are 
of key importance in this discusion. The first of these is the 
ancient Greek notion of the earth at the centre of the 
universe, and the seven concentric sphe.rÍ in the heavens in 
an order of the increasing perfection of their natures. 
Together with the earth, they comprised a totality that was 
regarded as an integral organism , 
with activitiec; they 
regarded as meaningful. 
As suggested, especialy by Aristotle, each part had its 
proper place in this organism, and its activity was sen as an 
efort to move toward that proper place and to carry out its 
appropriate function. Man was thought to be of central 
importance in this whole system, and this implied that his 
proper behaviour was to be regarded as correspondingly 
ne for the over-all harmony of the univenoe. 
Now in contrast, in the modern view the earth is a mere 
grain of dust in an immense universe of material bodie -
stars, galaxiÍ, and so on - and thetoe, in tum, are also 
constituted of atoms, molecules, and structures built out of 
them, as if they were parts of a universal machine. This 
machine, evidently, does not constitute a whole with 
meaning - at least, as far as can now be ascertained. Its 
basic order is that of independently existent parts interacting 
1 

TM implicate order: a new approach to reality 
blindly through forces that they exert on each other. 
The ultimate implications of this view of universal order 
are, of course, that man is basicaly insignificant. What he 
does has meaning only in so far as he can give it meaning in 
his own eyes, while the universe as a whole is basically 
indifferent to his aspirations, goals, moral and aesthetic 
values, and, indeed, to his ultimate fate. It is clear that these 
two views wil, in the long run, have very different 
implications for our general attitude to life, which can be 
profound and far reaching. For example, man tends to feel 
much more at home with an organic point of view -
organismic. 
Toward the end of this talk I'll discđ some of these 
implications in more detail. But for the present I'll merely 
cal attention to the fact that a mechanistic notion of order 
has come to permeate most 
of modem science and 
technology, and for this reason has begun to affect the whole 
of life. 
Now it's in physics that the mechanistic world-view 
obtained its most complete development, especially during 
the nineteenth century when its triumph seemed almost 
complete. From physics, mechanism has spread into other 
sciences and into almost al fields of human endeavor - that 
is, the mechanistic attitude. So some examination of the form 
that mechanism has taken in physics is caled for if we are to 
understand 
what has by now become 
a more.or-les 
dominant world view which deeply affects al of us. In this 
examination the correctnes and neces,gty of mechanism has 
to be evaluated and criticized, especialy with regard to 
whether or not the actual state of knowledge in physics 
continues to sustain and support this view, as well as to 
whether or not alternative views are pĒible. 
I'll 
begin by listing the principal characteristics of 
mechanism to make this idea more clear, and contrast its 
main features with those of an organismic type. Now firstly, 
the world is reduced as far as pcmible to a set of basic 
elements. Typicaly, these have ben taken as particles, such 
as atoms, electrons, protons, quarē, and so on. But you can 
also add various kinds of fields that extend continuously 
2 

The implicate order: a new approach to reality 
through space, such as electromagnetic and gravitational. 
Secondly, these elements are basically external to each other, 
not only in being separate in space but, more important, in 
the sense that the fundamental nature of each is independent 
of that of the other. Therefore the elements don't grow 
organically as parts of a whole, but rather, as I suggested 
earlier, they may be compared to parts of a machine. The 
forms are determined externally to the structure of the 
machine in which they're working. Now finaly, as I also 
pointed out earlier, the elements interact mechanically, and 
are therefore related only by influencing each· other 
externally - for e.xample, by forces of interaction that do not 
deeply affect their inner natures. 
In contrs, in an organism, the very nature of any part 
may be profoundly afected by changes of activity in other 
parts, and by the general state of the whole, and so the parts 
are basicaly internaly related to each other as well as to the 
whole. Of course in a mechanistic view the existence of 
organism is admitted since it is obvious. But it is asumed, in 
the way I just described, that ultimately you can reduce it al 
to molecules such as DNA and proteins, and so on. So 
eventually the organism is a convenient way of talking about 
a lot of molecules. They may even say that some new 
properties and qualities have emerged, but they are always 
implicit in the molecules . In addition, it's admitted that this 
goal of a complete mechanistic description is yet to be fuly 
achieved, as there is much that is stil unknown . So it's 
e&ential for the mechanistic-reductionist program to asume 
that there is nothing that cannot eventualy be treated in this 
way. 
Of course, there is no way to prove this imumption. So to 
suppose that this asumption holds without limit is bascialy 
an article of faith which permeates the motivation of most of 
modem science and gives energy to the scientific enterprise. 
This is a modern counterpart of earlier faith in religious 
belief based on more organismic types of view, which also in 
their time gave energy to vs social enterprises. That is, we 
have not lost the age of faith; we have realy changed from 
one faith to another. And faith is, according to Teilhard de 
3 

The implk:ate order: a new approach to reality 
Chardin, jwt holding the intelligence to a certain world view 
- that's his definition of faith. 
Now how far can this modern faith in mechanism be 
justified? Of course, there is no question that it works in a 
very important domain. It has brought about a revolution in 
our mode of life. Indeed, during the nineteenth century, as I 
said, there semed to be little reason to doubt this faith, 
because of what appeared to be several centuries of suõul 
application leading to vast vistas in the future. Therefore it's 
hardly surprising that physicists of the time commonly had 
an unshakable confidence in the correctne:M of this whole 
thing. And I may ilustrate this by referring to Lord Kelvin, 
one of the leading theoretical physicists of the time, who 
exprö the opinion that physics was more-or-le:M complete 
in its development. He therefore advisro young people not to 
go into the field, because further work in it would only be a 
matter of refinements in the next decimal points. 
He did however mention two smal clouds on the horizon. 
These were the negative results of the Michaelson-Morley 
experiment, and the difficulty i:n understanding black-body 
radiation. Now we have to admit that Lord Kelvin was at 
least able to choose his clouds properly, because these were 
precisely the points of departure for the radical revolution in 
physiC!'i brought about by relativity and quantum mechanics, 
which overturned this whole conceptual structure. Now this 
clearly illustrates the danger of complacency about our 
world views, and makes it evident how nary it is to 
constantly have a provisional, inquiring attitude toward 
them. That is, in some sense, we have to have enough faith in 
our world-view to work from it, but not that much faith that 
we think it's the final answer, right? 
I couldn't here go into a detailed e.xplanation of how all 
this took place - this change in view - but I'll give now, 
beginning with relativity, a brief, non-technical sketch. 
I can start by saying that relativity introduced a number of 
fundamentally new concepts regarding space, time and 
matter, which are quite subtle. The main point for our 
pu÷ here is that the notion of separate and independent 
particles as ha.sic constituents of the universe had to be given 
4 

The implicate order: a new approach to reality 
up. The basic notion instead was the idea of the field that 
spread continuously through space. Out of this you had to 
construct: the notion of a particle. I could illustrate these 
ideas in terms of the analogy of a flow of fluid such as a 
vortex. Now within this fluid there is a recurrent, stable 
pattern. You may abstract it in your mind as a vortex, 
though there is no vortex. There is nothing but a flowing 
pattern of water. But a vortex is a convenient word to 
describe that pattern . 
Now if you take two vortices close together, they modify 
each other producing a different pattern, and eventually, if 
you bring them together, they merge into one vortex. So you 
can se, there is an inherent interaction of these patterns, but 
the 
basic 
reality 
is 
unbroken 
wholenes 
in 
flowing 
movement. Separate entities such as vortices, are relatively 
constant and independently behaving forms abstracted by 
the mind from the whole in perception and in thought. 
This was of course, well known to nineteenth century 
physicists, but it was generally thought that real fluids such 
as water were constituted of myriad elementary particles 
which flowed only in an approximately C()Otinuow way, like 
grains of sand in the hour-glas. The reality underlying the 
microscopically observed fluid was considered to be a 
structure of discrete, mechanical elements in the form of 
particles. But on the basis of the theory of relativity Einstein 
gave arguments showing that such elementary particles 
would not be consistent with the laws of physics as developed 
in his theory. So instead, he proposed a set of con ti nous fields 
pervading all space, in which particles would be treated as 
relatively stable and independent structures in limited 
regions in which the field was strong. Therefore each particle 
is explained as an abstraction of a relatively independent and 
stable form, as with the vortex, spread out through space 
with no breaks anywhere. The universe is sen as unbroken 
wholenes in flowing movement. 
This approach contradicted in an important way the 
Ïumption of separate, elementary particles as constituents 
of the 
universe, 
that had ben 
characteristic 
of the 
mechanistic view. But still, this theory retained some of the 
5 

The implicate order: a new aproach to reality 
ùntial features of mechanism, because the fields at 
diferent points were regarded as separately existent, and not 
internally related in their basic nature, and not related to the 
whole. It was stil not anything like the organismic view. 
The asumption was that these fields are connected only 
locally - only by infinitesimal steps. The over-all field was 
viewed as a type of mechanical system that was more subtle 
than a set of particles, but the field approach was stil an 
important step away from the mechanistic world view, even 
though it stil remained within its general framework. 
The quantum theory, however , 
actually overturned 
mechanism in a much more thorough way than the theory of 
relativity. I'll give here its three main features. First of all, all 
action was in the form of what is called discrete quanta. For 
example, one found that the orbits of electrons around the 
nucleus would have to be discrete, as there were no allowed 
orbits in between, and yet, somehow, the electron jumped 
from one to the other without pasing in between -
according to this view. And the light shown on these thinú 
was also shown in the form of quanta, and in fact, every 
form of connection of energy was in the form of quanta. 
Therefore you could think. of it as an interconnecting 
network of quanta weaving. the whole universe into one, 
because these quanta were indivisible. So this led to some 
sort of indivisibility of the universe - though it doesn't show 
up in the large scale because the quanta are very small and, 
once again, it loolcs continuous, like the ûains of sand in the 
hour-gl1m. 
Secondly, all matter and energy were found to have what 
appears to be a dual nature, in the serue that they can behave 
either like a particle or like a field - or a wave - according 
to how they are treated by the experiment. The fact that 
everything can show either a wave-like or a particle-like 
character according to the context of the environment which 
is, in this case, the observing apparatus, is clearly not 
compatible with mechanism, because in mechanism the 
nature of each thing should be quite independent of its 
context. But it is quite like an organism, because organisms 
are ve.ry dependent on their context. 
6 

The implicate Qf'der: a new approach to reality 
The third point is that one finds a peculiar new property 
which I cal non-locality of connection. In other words, the 
connection can be between particles at considerable 
distances 
in 
some 
cases. 
This violates 
the clasical 
requirement of locality - that only things very close to each 
other can influence one another. 
There is another point we can bring out in this connection, 
which is that the state of the whole may actually organize the 
parts, not merely through the strong connection of very 
distant elements, but also because the state of the whole is 
such that it organizes the parts. It has a certain reality which 
is indifferent to exactly where the parts are. These are some 
new features. And all of this shows up in understanding 
chemistry for example. So when the chemists are wing their 
laws, what underlies them is this peculiar quantum 
mechanical feature. 
Now I want to show how this contradicts the basic 
mechanistic asumption. Firstly, the action is through 
indivisible quanta, so as I said, everything is woven together 
in indivisble links. The universe is one whole, as it were, and 
is in some serae unbroken. Of course, only under very refined 
observation does this show up. Now the socond point was the 
wave-particle nature, and the third was non-locality. So, 
•ou can se that ell these things deny mechanism. 
The people who founded quantum mechani. such as 
_,cnroedinger, Dirac and Pauli, and so on, all understood 
this; but since that time this understanding has gradually 
faded out as people have more and more concentrated on 
using quantum mechani as a system of calculation for 
experimental results, and each time a new text book is 
written, some of the philosophical meaning gets lost. So we 
now have a situation where I don't think the majority of 
physicists realizes how radical the implications of quantum 
mechanics are. 
Now quantum mechanics also says that we don't have 
complete determinism. That is, the laws are only determined 
statisticaly. You cannot tell exactly what is going to happen 
from these laws. Now this is important too, but perhaps it's 
les radical than some of these other things, because even 
7 

The implicate order: a new approach to reality 
from a clical point of view, you can think of laws that are 
not completely deterministic, such as what's called Brownian 
motion. So the lack of complete determinism is les radical a 
change than these others that I've mentioned. 
Now how do quantum mechanics and relativity bear on 
each other? The first point is that the basic physical concepts 
Bl'e quite contradictory. Relativity requires strict continuity, 
strict 
determinism, 
and 
strict 
locality. 
In 
quantum 
mechanics, you have to say the opposite - discontinuity, 
non-determinism, and non-locality. The physical concepts of 
these two theoriä have not ben brought together, although 
people are working out equations and methods of doing it 
mathematically. But the physical meaning has never ben 
made clear. 
If you want to look at relativity and quantum theory as 
being together coherently, we may ask a new kind of 
question. Instead of focusing on how the theori differ, let's 
ask what they have in common. What is common to both is 
unbroken wholenes of the universe. Each has this wholenes 
in a diferent way, yet if wholenes is their common factor, 
that's perhaps the best place to start. 
We've sen that each world view holds within itself its 
own basic notions of order. So we're led naturally to the 
question: Is it possible to develop a new order that is suitable 
for thinking about the basic nature of the universe of 
unbroken wholenes? This would perhaps be as different 
from the order of mechanism as the latter is from the ancient 
Greek order of increasing perfection. 
Now we won't 
necesarily return to ancient Greek or organismic theoriä. 
but to something new, perhaps different from both. 
This brings us to the further question though: What is 
order? Now we do presupå that there is some kind of 
order - so a general and explicit definition of order is not 
actually æble. You se, to begin you must already 
understand something about order, because just to talk, you 
must have some understanding of what order is and what 
meaning is. You can take a few examples to ilustrate this -
the order of numbers, 1,2,3,4; the order of points on a line; 
the order of functioning of a machine; the subtle order of 
8 

The implicate order: a new approach to reality 
functioning of an organism; the many orders of tones in 
music; of time; the order of a language; the order of 
thinking, and so on. You se, there are al sorts of orders that 
are more and more subtle. The notion of order covers a vast 
and urnpecifiable range. So I'll take it for granted that we 
already know, tacitly, something of the notion of order. And 
then our whole point is to bring it out. 
Most of this tacit notion of order is based upon perceptual 
experience, as you see from the examples. One could ask if 
there is not an analogy in our experience that would discus 
the order of unbroken wholenes.s. Here I could point out that 
the operation of scientific instruments has often played a key 
part in helping to make certain notions of order clear. The 
lens, for example is a device that makes an image. 
LENS 
p 
Q 
Point Pis imaged by the lens into point Q, roughly - it's 
not exact. Now, in this way you can consider together al the 
image points Q, and you'll have a photograph of the object. 
This constitutes a kind of knowledge of the object in which 
we are stresing the point-to-point correspondence between 
the image and the object. Therefore, you are stressing the 
concept of points. With the a.id of telescopes, microscopes, 
very fast or slow cameras, and so on, this kind of knowledge 
through correspondence of points, could be extended to 
things that are too far away, too smal, too fast, too slow, 
and so on, to be sen with the naked eye. Eventualy in this 
way you would be led to think that everything could 
ultimately be known in the form of separate elements. This 
shows that imtruments based on the lens have given a great 
impetl to the mechanistic way of thinking, not only in 
science, but in every phase of life. 
9 

The implicate order: a new approach to reality 
I could ask: Have any instruments been developed that 
would similarly help point vividly to the way of thinking that 
is compatible with unbroken wholenes? Now it turns out 
that there are several. I'll begin by describing the holograph 
which was invented by Dennis Gabor. This name is based on 
two Greek words 
-
halo meaning whole, and graph 
meaning to write. The holograph writes the whole. From 
this point of view a lens could be called a 'merograph', which 
writes the parts, and a telegraph, I suppose, writes far 
acrô. This instrument depends on another device called a 
laser, which produces a beam of light in which the waves of 
light are highly ordered and regular, in contrast to those of 
ordinary light where they are rather chaotic. Light from a 
laser falli on a half-silvered mirror. Part of the waves refleet 
and part of them come straight through and fall on the 
object. The waves that strike the object are scattered off it, 
and they eventually reach the original beam that was 
reflected in the mirror and start to interfere, producing a 
pattern of the two waves superimposed. It's a very complex 
pattern, and it can be photographed. Now the photograph 
doesn't look like the object at al. It may be invisible, or it 
may look like a vague indescribable pattern. But if you send 
similar l<U"er light through it, it will produce waves that are 
similar to the waves that were coming off the object, and if 
you place your eye in the right spot you will get an image of 
the object which will apparently be behind the holograph, 
and be three dimensional. You can move around and see it 
from different angles, as if through a window the sire of the 
beam. 
The point is that each part of the holograph is an image of 
the whole object. It is a kind of knowledge which is not a 
point-to-point correspondence, but a different kind. By the 
way, if you use only a part of the holograph, you'll still get an 
image of the whole object, but you'll get a les detailed 
image, and you'll see it from a more limited set of angles. 
The more of the holograph you use, the more of the object 
you can se, and the more accurately you can se it. 
Therefore every part contains information about the whole 
object. In this new form of knowledge information about the 
10 

The implicate order: a new approach to reality 
whole is enfolded in each part of the image . I can give an 
idea of enfoldment in a preliminary way by thinking of 
taking a sheet of paper, folding it up many times and, say, 
sticking pins in it, cutting it, and unfolding it, and you've 
made a whole pattern. So the pattern is enfolded, then it 
unfolds. In some sense the holograph does that. 
Of course, in this example the photograph is only a static 
record of the light , which is a movement of waves. The 
actuality that is directly recorded is the movement itself in 
which information about the whole object is dynamically 
enfolded in each part of space, while this information is then 
unfolded in the image. A similar principle of enfoldment and 
unfoldment can be seen to run through a wide range of 
experience. For example, the light from all parts of the room 
contains information about the whole room and, in a way, 
enfolds it in this tiny region going through the pupil of your 
eye, and it is unfolded by the lens, and the nervous system -
the brain - and somehow, consciousnes produces a sense of 
the whole room unfolded in a way which we don't really 
understand. But the entire room is enfolded in each part. 
This is crucial, because otherwise we wouldn't be able to 
understand what the room was - the fact is that there is a 
whole room, and we se the whole room from each part. The 
light entering a telescope, similarly enfolds information 
about the whole universe of space and time. And more 
generally', movements of waves of all sorts enfold the whole 
in each part of the universe. 
This principle of enfoldment and unfoldment may be 
observed 
in 
a 
more 
familiar 
context. 
For 
example, 
information out of which a television image is formed is 
enfolded in a radio wave which carries it as a signal. The 
function of the televison set is just to unfold this information 
and display it on the screen. The word 'display' also means to 
unfold, but for the purpose of showing something, rather 
than for its own sake. This is especially clear in the older 
televison sets that had an adjustment for synchronism, so 
when they went out of adjustment you could se the image 
folding up, and as you readjusted it, it unfolded. 
In the mechanistic world view all these examples are well 
11 

The implicate order: a new awroach to reality 
known, but they are explained by saying that the primary 
reality is ultimately the basic set of independently existent 
elements - particles and fields - while the enfoldment and 
unfoldment is only a secondary aspect. They say it's not very 
important. What I'm suggesting here is that the movement 
of enfolding and unfolding is ultimately the primary reality, 
and that the objects, entities, forms, and so on, which appear 
in this movement are secondary. 
Now how is this pos.sible? As I've already pointed out, 
quantum 
theory 
shows 
that 
the 
so-caled 
particles 
constituting matter are also waves similar to those of light. 
One can, in principle, make holographs using beams of 
electrons, protons, and so on, as well as sound waves -
which has ben done. The key point is that the mathematical 
laws of the quantum theory that apply to these waves, and 
therefore to all matter, can be sen to describe just such a 
movement in which there is a continual enfoldment of the 
whole into each region, along with the unfoldment of each 
region into the whole again. Although this may take many 
particular forms - some known and others not yet known 
- this movement is universal as far as we know. I'll call this 
universal movement of enfoldment and unfoldment 'the 
holomovement'. 
The proposal is that the holomovement is the basic reality, 
at least as far as we are able to go, and that al entities, 
objects, forms, as ordinarily sen, are relatively stable, 
independent and autonomous features of the holomovement, 
much as the vortex is such a feature of the flowing movement 
of a fluid. The basic order of this movement is therefore 
enfoldment and unfoldment. So we're looking at the universe 
in terms of a new order, which I'll cal the enfolded order, or 
the implicate order. 
The word 'implicate' means to enfold - in Latin, to fold 
inward. In the implicate order, everything is folded into 
everything. But it's important to note here that the whole 
universe is in principle enfolded into each part actively 
through the holomovment as well as al the parts. Now this 
means that the dynamic activity - internal and external -
which is fundamental to what each part is, is based on its 
12 

TM implicate order: a new approach to reality 
enfoldment of all the rest, including the whole universe. But 
of course, each part may unfold others in different de 
and ways. That is, they are not all enfolded equally in each 
part. But the basic principle of enfoldment in the whole is 
not thereby denied. 
Therefore enfoldment is not merely superficial or pasive 
but, I emphasize again, that each part is in a fundamental 
sense internaly related in its basic activities to the whole and 
to all the other parts. The me.chanistic idea of external 
relation as fundamental is therefore denied. Of course, such 
relationships are stil considered to be real but of secondary 
significance. That is, we can get approximations to a 
mechanistic behaviour out of this. That is to say, the order of 
the world as a structure of things that are basically external 
to each other comes out as secondary and emerges from the 
deeper implicate order. The order of elements external to 
each other would then be called the unfolded order, or the 
explicate order. 
The usual way of loolcing at things is, therefore, turned 
upside-down, and that's how we arrive at the notion of the 
implicate order. The holograph is, of course, 
only a 
particular example of an implicate order. Its value in the 
present context is that it provides a good analogy as to how 
the implicate order is relevant to the quantum behaviour of 
matter. The analogy is particularly good because, as I've 
said, the laws of the propagation of the kinds of waves that 
are as.sociated with basic quantum laws are also capable of 
being compatible with the theory of relativity, and therefore 
we se that the implicate order is able to have a significant 
bearing on both of the two most fundamental theories of 
modem physics . 
But of course, analogies are ny limited, since by 
their very nature they are similar only in some ways to what 
they are representing and are diferent in other ways. One of 
the principal limits of the analogy of the holograph, at least 
as ifs usualy analysed, is that it does not adequately take 
into account al of the quantum properties of the waves that 
are involved. In particular, what it fails to consider is that 
the energy of these waves is in discrete units, or quanta, 
13 

The implicate order: a new awroach to reality 
called photons. Now usually there are so many of them that 
this is not important. But if we wanted to be very accurate, 
this would be important. The holographic analogy still 
mises some of the esential features of quantum mechanics. 
To make an accurate analogy one would have to also use 
modern, relativistic quantum theory, and this would lead to 
questions that are much too abstract and complex to be 
treated here. But the point about analogies is that they are 
always limited, and if they were not limited, they would not 
be distinguishable from the thing itself. So we can keep on 
u.s.ing analogies which are almost like metaphors to help get 
across what is meant. 
Now as another analogy, I think you've all sen computer 
games. You have a television screen which you could call an 
implicate order because, as I've just explained, out of this can 
be unfolded all sorts of forms according to what goes in. But 
if this screen is connected to a computer, then the computer 
will unfold forms, for example, spaceships and so on, 
according to its program, and you can se now that the 
computer enfolds the information needed to determine the 
spaceships. So there are two implicate orders - one, the 
implicate order of the screen, and two, the way in which the 
information is enfolded in the computer. Thirdly, there are 
the buttons that the player preses, and then we have the 
person who plays it - that's the third implicate order. He 
enfolds further, and he of course, is affected by what's on the 
screen, and so it goes around. So the three together make a 
kind of unit. And it becomes so absorbing that in some cases 
they realy are a unit. Now this is a good analogy as to how 
the quantum mechanical field theory works, because the first 
implicate order is like the field, and there is a super-implicate 
orde.r which organizes the field into discrete units which are 
particle-like. Without that super-implicate order however, 
the field would just spread out without showing any particle­
like qualities. 
Ifs posible to produce an indefinite number of additional 
analogies, but what I want to do instead is to discus.s the 
more general significance of the implicate order beyond 
physics. What I want to say is that if you look beyond physics 
14 

The implicate order: a new awrooch to reality 
you wil find that orders similar to this implicate order are 
realy quite common in experience. In fact, this idea of 
enfoldment is an ancient idea. It was known in the Eest a 
long time ago. 
If you take the example of a living being such as a plant 
grown from a sed, the sed makes a very smal contribution 
to the substance of the fuly grown plant and to the energy 
needed to malce it grow. These come from the air, the water, 
the soil and the sunlight . According to modem ideas of 
genetics, the sed has information, if you like, in the form of 
DNA which is traru:mitted to the matter out of which the 
plant is eventualy formed. Now we have already ben led to 
use the notion of the implicate order for matter in general. 
We se how it is constantly enfolding again into the 
background. You may think of an electron as unfolding from 
this background at a particular position, then it folds back in 
again, and another unfolds nearby, and it enfolds again, and 
another one, and another one, and gradualy it looks like a 
track of a single electron. You can se the discontinuity here 
because the places of unfoldment need not be continuous. 
And you can understand why there can be discontinuity and 
also continuity - wave-like qualities - coming from the 
unfoldment. So we se that inanimate matter is constantly 
recreating itself through enfoldment and unfoldment -
replicating itself, if you wil 
- in the form of inanimate 
matter. 
That's 
the 
proposal. 
Now 
with 
the further 
information from the sed, it unfolds to make a plant 
instead, which can then malce seds for new plants. You can 
look at it as a continuous proces of unfoldment that can be 
modified by new orders coming from the genetic structure, 
so that it wil unfold into a considerably diferent being. · 
Let's go on to discus consciousnes, which we take to 
include thought, feeling, desire, wil, impulse to act and an 
unspecified set of further features, such as awarenes, some 
of which we may discus. The question is: Do we find an 
impllcate order in consciousnU? To answer this question I 
wil first consider the proces of thought. In describing this 
proces we may refer to thoughts that are implicit . The word 
'implicit' has the same root as implicate, and this suggests 
15 

The implicate order: a new approach ta reality 
that a given thought may somehow contain other thoughts 
that it implies - that is, that it enfolds. Such implication 
may be, in some cases, equivalent to entailment or inference 
if it obeys the rules of logic. But this is only a special case of 
implication, like that of a regular track. There may be 
implications which produce very regular tracks, or more 
irregular tracks, so that there could be leaps in thought, and 
so on. So implication has a much wider range of meanings, 
going from mere asociation to a sense that one thing goes 
with another, and to a tacit, or unstated, ground of reason 
supporting the thought that is implied. All of these may be 
regarded as enfolded within the thought in question and are 
capable of emerging from it through unfoldment. 
Here I could add that language, which is esential to the 
communication of thought and to its precise determination, 
may also be sen as an implicate order. After all, the word is 
only a sign or a symbol of very little significance in itself. 
What is more important is its meaning. Generally this is 
determined only by a much larger over-all context. For 
example, the meaning of a given word may be affected by 
other sets of words, not only near to it but even quite far 
away, and this suggests that the meaning of each word, and 
indeed each combination of words, such as a sentence or a 
paragraph, is ultimately unfolded into the whole content 
that is communicated. Such a notion is suggested even more 
strongly by the fact that often one can sense that the whole 
sequence of words sems to flow out of single momentary 
intention without the need for comcious choice for their 
order, esentially as if they had unfolded from something 
that was already there in the intention. 
As a further interesting example, there is the fact that 
without the need for a search in memory we can sense 
whether a word is in common usage in the language or not. 
Thus nouns formed out of verbs, such as 'alternation', 
generally have in common usage verbs that correspond with 
them, such as to alternate. We know immediately though, 
that in certain cases they do not. For example, 'alteration" 
does not have the corresponding form, 'to alterate'. You 
don't have to search to find that out. So it suggests that some 
16 

The implicate order: a new approach to reality 
features of this language are, 
as it were, enfolded in the 
whole, although that doesn't necesarily explain all of them. 
The immediate availability of this knowledge, then, 
suggests that you can think of the totality of a given language 
a.s an undivided whole from which the various words and 
their potential meanings all unfold . A reasonable case can 
therefore be made for the proposal that thought and 
language form an implicate order. But these also enfold 
feelings and, vice versa, feelings enfold thought. Language, 
you see, is implicit in feelings and thoughts and words. The 
thought of danger unfolds into a feeling of fear, which 
unfolds into words communicating the feeling, 
and to 
further thoughts, and you se all of this mutual enfoldment. 
Thoughts and feelings also enfold intentions. These are 
sharpened up into a determinate will and the urge to do 
something. Intention, will and urge unfold into more action, 
which will include more thought if necesary. So all the 
aspects of the mind show themselves as enfolding each other, 
and transforming into each other through enfoldment and 
unfoldment. And therefore we have a view in which the 
mind is not regarded a.s broken up dualistically or multiply 
into independently existent functions or elements like 
thought and feeling, because in enfoldment each aspect is 
internally related to the other rather than externally. 
If you're attentive you can se quite a few other things that 
indicate this enfoldment . I would like to suggest we consider 
listening to music. Your attention shows that while any given 
note is being played several preceding notes are still present 
in awarenes 
a.s 
a kind of immediate after-echo, or 
reverberation. This is to be distinguished from memory, 
which is recalled or re-collected from a more permanent 
repository. Remembering notes a minute apart is not 
perceived a.s music, and most of the music is then lost. The 
notes must somehow be present together. One can sense that 
each note, as it starts to fade and turn into a diminishing 
sequence of after-echos, is in some way enfolding into 
various 
aspects 
of 
consciousnÛ 
including 
emotions, 
asociations of various kinds, impulses to move, and so on. 
I'm suggesting here that this may be sen as a kind of 
17 

The implicate order: a new approach to reality 
enfolded order. That is to say, one can sense the co-prgnce 
of afteN!lchoes and other derivatives of several notes in 
different degrees of enfoldment. This is similar to the 
structure of the enfoldment of many waves into one in a 
holograph. The esential point is that the simultaneous co­
prgnce of several notes, and po.sibly in some sense even 
some distant ones, has its origin in the sense of flowing 
movement of the theme, along with the preservation of its 
es.sential identity, which explains why notes that follow each 
other only after long intervals generally convey neither a 
sense of flowing movement nor a prgrvation of identity. 
Now there is another example, brought up by Michael 
Polanyi, of bicycle riding. In order to remain stably upright, 
one must turn into the direction in which one is faling. 
Polanyi has pointed out that a simple calculation based on 
the laws of physics shows that, if the bicycle is being ridden 
properly, its angle of tilt and the angle at which the whe.el is 
turned are related by a certain formula. But of course, any 
attempt to follow this formula would get in the way of 
actually riding the bicycle. What is of key significance is that 
the over-al 
movement that 
results and 
brings about 
approximately following the formula is the outcome of an 
entirely different level of activity involving muscles, nerves 
and brain. It is extremely complex and subtle, and evidently 
you cannot .describe it in any explicit way. Polanyi called this 
'tacit knowing', rather than explicit knowing. I would like to 
propose that this may be regarded as a kind of implicate 
order which unfolds into an explicate order of the motion of 
the bicycle as described by a formula. The law of the 
explicate order therefore emerges as an abstraction of what is 
actualy a certain feature of a much larger implicate order. 
Evidently this kind of tacit knowledge is very important in 
every phase of life. In fact, without tacit knowledge ordinary 
knowledge would have no meaning. In fact, when we talk, 
most of the meaning is implicit or tacit. And also the action 
which flows from it is implicit or tacit. In fact, even to talk or 
to think - although thinking may be explicit as it forms 
images - the actual activity of thinking is tacit. You cannot 
say how you do it. If you want to walk across the room, you 
18 

The implicate order: a new approach to reality 
cannot say how it comes about, right? It unfolds tacitly. 
On the basis of all of this I would then propose for further 
discus.sion the notion that both 
mind and matter are 
ultimately in implicate orders, and that in al cases explicate 
orders 
emerge 
as 
relatively 
autonomous, distinct and 
independent objects, entities and forms, which unfold from 
the implicate orders. This means that the way is opened up 
for a world view in which mind and matter may comistently 
be related without adopting a reductionist position. 
Here we are going to say that mind and matter both have 
reality, or perhaps that they both arise from some greater 
common ground, or perhaps they are not realy different. 
Perhaps they interweave. The main point, though, is: 
because they have the implicate order in common it is 
pĊible to have a rationally comprehensible relatiomhip 
between them. In this way we can leave open the poMibility 
of acknowledging the differences that may be found between 
the mental and material sides without faling into dualism. 
This question of how mind and matter are related has long 
ben one that has perplexed those who have seriously 
enquired into it. Descartes gave an especially clear and sharp 
formulation of the difficulties. He considered matter as 
extended substance - that is, existing spread out in space in 
the form of separate objects. Mind he discussed in terms of 
thinking substance which is not separate and extended -
that is, thoughts of distinct objects are not themselves spread 
out. You se, we can make clear and aistinct thoughts, yet 
they don't exist as separate and extended elements in any 
kind of space. 
Descartes felt that the two substances were so different 
that there was no way to formulate their relationship clearly. 
The problem of how they are related was to be solved by 
bringing in God who created both, and who is thus the 
ground of their connection - that is, God puts clear and 
distinct thoughts into our minds which may correspond 
correctly to the separate objects of space. He also thought 
that maybe the pineal gland would connect mind and 
matter, but that's not very comistent because he only puts 
the problem into the pineal gland and doesn't say how it can 
19 

The implicate order: a new approach to reality 
do that - connect such different things. 
Since the time of Descartes the idea that problems of this 
kind can be solved by an appeal to the action of God has been 
dropped. But it has not generally ben noticed by those who 
go on with Cartesian mind-matter duality that this leaves the 
whole problem of how the two are related unsolved. Or 
perhaps it has been noticed, but it has ben more or les put 
aside. 
The implicate order suggests a pos.sible solution of this 
Cartesian duality which has pervaded much of human 
thinking over the ages. Instead of saying that there are two 
orders - the explicate order of extended structure, and 
something like an implicate order of thinking - we are 
proposing, to a large extent, on the basis of an understanding 
of recent developments in physics, that matter also is that 
way. And if we were to extend it to say that brain matter and 
nerve matter are that way, then in some way perhaps, mind 
and matter interweave. And perhaps something analogous to 
mind might exist in inanimate matter, at least implicitly, just 
as life is implicit in inanimate matter. Given a sed it forms 
animate matter instead. 
And somehow mind is implicit in inanimate matter. Given 
the proper conditions it unfolds and forms living beings who 
might even be conscious. And that might suggest - this is 
something we'll go into - that the mental and the material 
are two sides of one reality. 
The division between mind and matter, or the observer 
and the observed, has produced very serious consequencei; in 
attempting to see that the world is a whole, because even if 
you are thinking of wholenes, you are thinking of an 
observer who is looking at this wholenes, and this creates a 
division. This starts to break up the whole, because you 
identify with one part of it, and then there is another part 
you are not identified with, and therefore the whole is 
broken up in two. And then it breaks up further, because 
there are many observers, and each observer is an external 
object for al the others. The many parts obtained in this way 
are related, and you have to break things up even more in 
order to understand their relationships. So the implicate 
20 

The implicate order: a new approach to reality 
order can be important as a way of seing how this particular 
problem might be dealt with. 
But let me emphasize that to have an approach of 
wholenes doesn't mean that we are going to be able to 
capture the whole of e.i:istence within our concepts and 
knowledge. Rather it means firstly that we understand this 
totality as an unbroken and seamles whole in which 
relatively autonomous objects and 
forms emerge. 
And 
secondly 
it 
means 
that, 
in 
so 
far 
as 
wholenes 
is 
comprehended with the aid of the implicate order, the 
relationships between the various parts or sub-wholes are 
ultimately internal. This notion is suggested also by an 
organismic point-of-view; but as I've said, there is no way to 
exclude the possibility that organisms have a mechanistic 
base in their supposed constituent particles. But if we say 
that the particles themselves haven't got a mechanistic basis, 
then why should the organisms have it? It would be peculiar 
to say that the particles of physics are not mechanistic, but as 
son as they make organisms they are mechanistic. 
It is important to keep in mind here that the whole and its 
parts are correlative categories - that each implies the 
other. Something can be a part only if there is a whole of 
which it can be a part. To understand this correlation of 
whole and parts, I want to return to the notion of the 
holomovement. Within the holomovement, as I've said, each 
part emerges as being a relatively independent, autonomous 
and stable sub-whole, and it does so by virtue of the 
particular way in which it actively enfolds the whole and 
therefore all the other parts. Its fundamental qualities and 
activities both internal and external are ñntial to what it is 
and are thus understood as determined basically in an 
internal relation, rather than in isolation and external 
relation. 
This internal relationship is most directly experienced in 
consciousnes. The content of consciousnes of each human 
being is, evidently, an enfoldment of the totality of existence, 
physical and mental, internal and external. This enfoldment 
is active in the sense that it enters in a fundamental way into 
the activities that are esential to what a human being is. 
21 

The implicate order: a new approach to reality 
According to the content of his consciousnes he acts, 
whether it's right or wrong. Each human being is therefore 
related to the totality, including nature and the whole of 
mankind . He is also therefore internally related to other 
human beings. How close that relation is, has to be explored. 
What I am further saying is that the quantum theory implies 
that ultimately the relationship of parts and whole - of 
matter in general - is understood in a similar way. 
And perhaps I should also add here that in each sub-whole 
there is a certain quality that does not come from the parts, 
but helps organize the parts. So·the implicate order does not 
deny the significance of parts or sub-wholes, but rather it 
treats them in its own way as relatively stable, indepenc;lent 
and autonomous. Wholenes is sen as primary while the 
parts are secondary in the sense that what they are and what 
they do can be understood only in the light of the whole. 
I could summarize this in the principle: The wholenes of 
the whole and the parts. 
And the opposite principle: The partiality of the parts and 
the whole. 
Both principles have their place. But I will make an 
asertion: The need to accentuate the wholenes of the whole 
and the parts. 
This asertion is needed, becawe we have to be careful not 
to asert wholenes too strongly, or else we will just simply 
create opposition to something that is perfectly valid, namely 
mechanism in a limited area. The difference is not whether 
the parts are included, but what is given primary emphasis. 
This is rather as in a mwical composition, where the entire 
meaning depends upon which theme has a major or 
dominant role, and which is minor or secondary. This is a 
basic feature of communication at the metaphsyical level. To 
some extent it's an art form. You cannot get a precise 
communication, but it is implicit or tacit, what is being 
communicated. And therefore the form in which it is put is 
crucial. The form must be appropriate to the content. 
There is a danger in seeing mechanism 
as totaly 
destructive and saying that we must only discus the whole. 
For that also is a partial view and, in fact, it is almost 
22 

The implicate order: a new approach to reality 
another form of mechanism. So we are just asking: Where do 
we put the ultimate emphasis? But of course, if you don't 
want to do metaphysics, which is a view of the nature of 
reality as a whole, then you don't have to accentuate either 
principle. You'll say, you're just going to take these two 
principlD as practical principlD to apply wherever you think 
they're appropriate. Then they become maxims, which may 
apply here or there. You choose your maxim according to 
where it worb. However, we'll see as we go along that this 
attitude cannot be maintained indefinitely, 
and 
that 
ultimately we must regard one of these two principlD as the 
major theme and the other as the minor theme. 
This approach of wholenes could help to end the far­
reaching and pervasive fragmentation that arises out of the 
mechanistic 
world 
view. 
One 
can 
obtain 
a 
further 
understanding of the nature of such fragmentation by 
asking, what is the difference in the meaning of the word 
'part' and 'fragment'. A 
part, as I said -
whether 
mechanical or organic - is intrinsically related to a whole, 
but this is not so for a fragment. As the Latin root of the 
word indicates, and as the related English word 'fragile' 
shows, to fragment is to break up or smash. To hit a watch 
with a hammer would not produce parts, but fragments that 
are separated in ways that are not significantly related to the 
structure of the watch. If you cut up the caređ of an animal 
as in a butcher shop , this produces not parts of the animal 
but fragments again. So what I'm trying to say is that we 
have a way of thinking that produces irrelevant breab and 
fragments, rather than seing the proper parts in relation to 
the whole. 
Of course there are areas where it is appropriate to 
produce fragments. If you can crush stonD in order to make 
concrete, that's perfectly alright. There are things that 
should be broken down into fragments. But what I'm 
discĒing here, quite generally, is an inappropriate kind of 
fragmentation that arises when we regard 
the parts 
appearing in our thought as primary and independently 
existent constituents of al reality including ourselv) - that 
is, that corresponding to our thoughts there is something in 
23 

The implicate order: a new approach to reality 
reality. Then a world view such as mechanism, in which the 
whole of existence is considered as made up of such 
elementary parts, wil give strong support to this 
&agmentary way of thinking. And this in turn expreses itself 
in further thought that sustains and develops such a world 
view. As a result of this general approach, man ultimately 
ceases to give the divisions the significance of merely 
convenient 
ways 
of 
thinking, 
indicating 
relative 
independence or autonomy of things, and in.stead he begins 
to se and experience himself as made up of nothing but 
separately and independently existing components. 
Being guided by this view, man then acts in such a way as 
to try and break himself and the world up so that all sems to 
correspond to this way of thinking. He therefore obtains an 
apparent proof of his fragmentary self-world-view, but he 
doesn't notice that it is he himself, acting according to his 
mode of thought, who has brought about the fragmentation 
which now sems to have an autonomous existence 
independent of his will and desire. 
Fragmentation is therefore an attitude of mind which 
disposes the mind to regard divisions between things as 
absolute and final, rather than as ways of thinking that have 
only a relative and limited range of usefulnes and vaj.idity. It 
leads therefore to a general tendency to break up things in an 
irrelevant and inappropriate way according to how we 
think. And so it is evidently and inherently destructive. For 
example, though all parts of mankind are fundamentally 
interdependent and interrelated, the primary and overriding 
kind of significance given to the distinctions between people, 
family, profesion, nation, race, religion, ideology, and so 
on, is preventing human beings from working together for 
the common good, or even for survival. 
When man thinks of himself in this fragmentary way, he 
wil inevitably tend to se himself first - his own person, his 
own group - he can't seriously think of himself as internally 
related to the whole of mankind and therefore to all other 
people. Even if he does try to put mankind first, he wil 
perhaps think of nature as something different to be 
exploited to satisfy whatever desires he may have at the 
24 

The implicate order: a new approach to reality 
moment. Similarly he will think body and mind are 
independent actualities, thought and feeling, and so on, and 
he begins to think to divide these up, each to be treated 
separately. Physically this is not conducive to over-all health, 
which means wholenİ. and mentally, not to sanity which 
also has a similar meaning. This is shown, I think, by this 
ever growing tendency to break up the psyche in neuroses, 
psychosis, and so on. 
Well, to sum up, fragmentary thinking is giving rise to a 
reality that is constantly breaking up into disorderly, 
disharmonious and destructive partial activities. It therefore 
sems reasonable to explore the suggestion that a mode of 
thinking that starts from the most encompasing posible 
whole and goes down to the parts as sub-wholes in a way 
appropriate to the actual nature of thinw;, would help to 
bring 
about 
a 
different 
reality, 
one 
that 
was more 
harmonious and orderly and creative. And in this discusion 
here, I have tried to show that physics provides some 
justification for doing this. And in fact it is more justified 
than the mechanistic view if you go into physics deeply. But 
of course before it realy changes thinw; -
to think 
differently -
this thought must enter deeply into our 
intentions, actions, and so on - our whole being. That is, 
we will actualy have to mean what we are saying. To bring 
this about requires an action going beyond what we have just 
discused. The main point then is that your world views -
ifs really a self-world-view because it includes yourself -
have a tremendous effect on you. Even people who don't 
think they have self-world-views have them tacitly. And the 
general prevalence of mechanism has helped to give rise to 
fragmentation. The fact is however that even when people 
held an organic point of view in ancient Greece they also 
fragmented, so there's more to it than that. The self-world­
view has to be pursued carefuly into the whole question of 
the division of mind and matter to se how fragmentation 
comes about. Such fragmentation doesn't come only from 
philosophical views, but philosophical views can either 
contribute to it or contribute the other way . But of course, to 
understand this whole question, much more is required. 
25 

Questioning world views 
Question: Have you heard of the work of Mary Douglas 
the social anthropologist? She has done a lot of work about 
how hard it is for us to get out of our own categories. She 
claims that whenever we transcend the categories, it 
unleashe:s pollution. A kind of an alarm, as when you 
break down the system itself. She claims that whenever we 
make these forms that constitute our clas.5i.£ications they 
are quick with energy, and whenever we try to go against 
them something terrible will ensue. 
ProfeS&Or Bohm: Yes, well that could be so. You see, the 
forms that we have in our world view are charged with 
tremendous energy, and presumably when that world view 
is chalenged, say by a scientific world view or a religious 
world view, a tremendous explosion may take place and 
people fight over it to the death, right? Nevertheles it may 
be necesary to chalenge these world views if they are 
wrong. There is a risk in doing so, but there is also 
perhaps a greater risk in not doing so, because if we go on 
with a fixed, rigid world view it will lead us to the edge of 
the abyss, right? ക we are now approaching. 
Q: My impre&ion is that to a great extent what you are 
talking about is a pervasive confusion - that we mix up 
the fragments and think that they are wholes, then behave 
as if they are wholes. 
Botun: Yes, well that's because we are thinking that the 
parts in our thought each corresponds to a sub,whole; but 
more deeply , because we are taking this thought as an 
exact representation of reality, we are imposing it on 
reality where in general it won't hold. So in attempting to 
impose this thought on reality rigidly, we start to try to 
break reality up. 
Now if I thought that this (piece of chalk) was made of 
two parts and I moved it, of course the parts would move 
together; but if I continued to iruist that it's made of two 
parts rd have to break it, so it would then be two parts. 
26 

Parts, wholes and fragments 
Now you see, if we say there are two nations, that's the 
same kind of problem . You see, the people in the two 
nations may not be very different, like France and 
Germany, right? Nevertheles.s they insist they are 
absolutely different. One says, 'Deutschland uber Alles', 
and the other says, 'Vive la France', and then they say, 
'We must establish rigid boundaries; we must set up 
tremendous big fences acros.s these boundaries; we must 
dùroy anything to protect them,' and you had the First 
World War. Of course, each part had its commercial 
interests, and so on, despite the fact that they were 
interdependent, and probably they would have prospered 
much more if they had allowed free flow, as for example 
happened with the states of the United States. So if you 
think that there are two parts, then you will impose it. 
Though if you cross the boundary no division is visible; the 
people are not very different, and if it had happened 
historically, by accident, that the two had been one, there 
would have ben no such thing. 
Q: Could the whole be one without being broken into 
parts? 
Bohrn: That's not broken. You see, I'm trying to say that 
the whole divides into parts, and they are natural. The 
whole and the parts are correlative categories - the parts 
are sub-wholes. Now there's a difference between breaking 
and natural division. The cells may divide naturaly, but if 
they are smashed it's quite different. The attempt to 
impose a line of thought too hard will tend to lead to 
arbitrary division . Even the parts are not absolutely 
divided from each other, be.cause you can see that 
underneath they come out of a common whole -
unfolding - but only relatively so. If you think of a table, 
it looks quite divided from the people . It's made of atoms; 
but actualy there's no place where the table ends. If you 
try to think of it at the atomic scale it would look very 
vague, and it goes into the air and into the people, and 
also, if you were to think of the quantum mechanical 
27 

Our world view as part of the world 
nature, all would be unfolding. We could say that this 
notion of division into para is an abstraction which we 
can apply up to a certain limit. Thw for example, we 
divide land into fields for different purposes, and we call 
them different parts. That is convenient and useful and 
correct up to a point; but if we take it too seriously it's 
wrong, because every part depends on every other part. 
You se, the enfolded relation of the whole eventually has 
to prevail. 
Now the same thing holds, let's say, in ecology. You 
divide the world into parts, but you find the division 
doesn't hold - that pollution ocurs in one place and goes 
to another, and problems created in one place spread out, 
and little things happening here and there all add up all 
over. Therefore this idea of dividing things into para is of 
limited value. We are not discarding it, but we are saying 
it's got to be used inteligently. Otherwise, you will start 
smashing things up - that is fragmentation. I want to 
make a sharp distinction between a part and a fragment. 
There are some things which should be smashed up, so I'm 
not totally against smashing up. 
Q: I find my mind tending to want to separate cause and 
effect. Sometimes it's fair, but probably there's a tendency 
often to want to find - to se the effect - like to se our 
world view having an effect on the nature of the world. 
Bohm: That's a very subtle question. We have to discus in 
what sense is our world view a part of the world, and I 
think it's probably a bit late for that tonight. (laughter) 
Roughly, I would say that we have to see our world view 
as an active part of the world. But what is the real 
relation of parts and whole - or cause and effect - is 
there a division? 
Q: Would the answer to that include something of Rupert 
Sheldrake's morphogenic ideas? 
Bohm: Wel, that could be part of the answer; but I think 
28 

Why enjoldment and unfoldment 
it's a more general question about the nature of our 
thought, the nature of how it participates in reality . Is it 
part of reality? And also the nature of cause and effect, is 
there a division? 
Q: I don't know how long you want to speak, but I got 
bogged down in the first ten minutes of your talk, and 
reading the first chapter of your book (Wholen; and the 
Implicate Order) , I suddenly found it getting beyond me. 
What I really can't sem to do is to actually grasp what 
we are really talking about with this basic theme of 
enfoldment and unfoldment. Can I just take two examples 
that you brought up? One is the holograph. Now as far as 
I know, and I don't really know the details, I believe that 
if you get a holograph, which is a photograph, it is 
posible to analyse exactly what it is a holograph of, and if 
you pas laser beams through it, what it is will actually 
appear. In other words, you know that there is a simple 
explanation for that in purely mechanistic terms. So this is 
the first question: What actually are we gaining by saying, 
well now, this is an example of unfoldment? Can I just 
move on to plants? Because when you have a plant 
growing, I think you have to admit that you can't actualy 
predict in mechanistic terms how exactly that plant is 
going to grow. There are some arbitrary factors too 
complicated to pin down. What are we gaining when we 
say don't explain it in those terms but see it as an 
unfoldment of something that was previously enfolded? I 
think I realy mean that to talk anything about wholenai;, 
I would like to feel I can actually grasp in my mind what 
that operation is. 
Bohm: Yes. Now with the holograph , you se, it's true you 
can give a mechanistic explanation. I was merely using the 
holograph as an analogy of enfoldment to get a picture. 
You can give a mechanistic explanation if you don't go too 
deeply, but if you look at the quantum nature of the 
waves that you use in explaining them, you'll find that 
there is no mechanistic explanation . It's only when you 
29 

Prediction and understanding 
treat the waves as a clasical wave that you have a 
mechanistic explanation, and I was merely using this as an 
analogy to help get across what the meaning of enfoldment 
is. Now the reason for this enfoldment is that the laws of 
quantum mechanics have no mechanistic explanation 
finally. And since everything else is supposed to be based 
on that, it means that we cannot actually give a 
mechanistic explanation that holds all the way. There only 
is an approximation. Now if we are trying to see the thing 
deeply - the nature of what is - we have got to look 
differently, and I am proposing that if you begin with 
enfoldment you get a feeling of what is most basic, and 
you can then explain mechanism as an approximation to 
unfoldment . 
Q: Can unfoldment be sen as predictive? 
Bohm: It's not only a question of predicting but 
understanding. This is an important point. In earlier 
science the idea was to understand the universe, and to 
predict it also. Now if you emphasize prediction, we are in 
the fragmentary point of view again . You are saying that 
understanding is not important; the important point is to 
predict . Now that's important for technology and for 
various purposes, but I'm trying to say that if we adopt 
that world view al the way, we are going to take a 
mechanistic attitude to each other and to everything, and 
we are going to have some difficult consequences. 
Q: I'm not exactly wanting to predict, but on the other 
hand if your prediction comes out correct, that give<> you 
some reasurance that you are on the right track. 
Bohm: This holomovement point of view is in principle 
capable of treating a wider range of problems. For the 
moment it is merely another way of looking at what is 
treated by quantum mechanics. Now quantum mechanics 
enable<> you to predict certain things - the probability of 
them - but it does not enable you to understand what it 
30 

Understanding science intuitively 
means. That is, it's merely a set of rules like a cok bok. 
If you tum the crank you'll come out with the answer. 
There's no real way of intuitively understanding what 
underlies it. So, I'm trying to say that if you try to 
understand intuitively what underlies quantum mechanics, 
this image of a holograph will give you a feeling for it. 
I think it's important that people understand scientific 
ideas intuitively for many reasons. One of them is that the 
only way of conveying it to the general public is intuitive; 
otherwio>e we must treat scientists as super witch-doctors 
who work out al the;e formulae and produce magical 
results, and you'll have faith in them. I think it's 
important that the general public should have some 
understanding, and in the past they did. The second point 
is that it's part of your world view that by applying this 
mechanistic philosophy and saying that the fundamental 
particles are mechanical when in fact one shows they 
cannot be, we are afecting our whole way of approaching 
the world and ourselves. And this has a profound effect on 
the way science is done, and the way society is organized, 
and the way people are related. Therefore it is important 
to get an intuitive notion, which is the notion by which 
you wil be moved. You se, the fact that you can predict 
certain things has very little . . .  oh, except say, maybe we 
can gain something by predicting - but the intuitive 
feling that is now gotten acrĭ by science is that 
mechanism is the nature of reality. So that gives the notion 
that science back.§ up mechanism. But in fact it's just a 
philosophical idea and not backed up by the whole of 
science; the most fundamental features of science don't 
back it up. 
Q: I'll s1eep on that! 
Bohm: Yes. One more question because its very late. 
Q: Something I've ben most drawn to when we've ben 
talking about cause and effect is an idea that I came aeroĮ 
in a bok which I found very exciting, which was the idea 
31 

Grasping the implicate order 
that the explicate cause and effect - the explicitly, 
semingly mechanistically related events - may refer to 
an implicate, higher dimemional going-on - some 
implicate happening, some implicate presence, happening. 
Bohm: Yeo;, well, that wil require some explanation, go 
ahead. 
Q: That idea and the intuitive ramification-. of that idea I 
find very exciting. And just to open the thing up - maybe 
it wil develop in the time we spend together - one aspect 
of that I'd just like to bring up is the p٬ibility of seing 
all the diferent things that people do in, say, 
tramformational consciousnes, as perhaps not causally 
related, but referring to something of a larger happening 
that maybe we can't have a grasp of, but that we do have, 
as many parts of the hologram - taking the thing as a 
whole we get an imight into whafs going on. 
Bohm: Yeo;. If you would raise that que<ition 
tomorrow . .  , . (laughter) 
Peter Garrett: N. David Bohm was encouraging there, 
maybe you could take a sheet of paper and write a specific 
question or questions that we could then feed back and 
have a look at tomorrow. Another thing just to add is that 
you may feel the que<ition you have is a little bit irrelevant 
to the ideas that are being talked about. We were talking 
at lunch time about a leter that had ben mislaid for two 
yean which turned out to have one thought in it which 
was very helpful to the development of some ideas that 
you (David Bohm) were working with - the person in 
Australia who had a comment which was very useful - so 
your ideas might sem a little off the side, or simple, or 
something, but it may be extremely useful. So why don't 
you v.rite it down anyway, and se what happem. Thank 
you very much. 
32 

DISCUSSING THE IMPLICATE ORDER 
Following the first sesion the organize1'$ were informed 
that some of the participants had jound it very difficult to see 
or hear Profesor Bohm from their seats at the back of the 
room. Late that night, with the excellent cooperation of the 
Three Ways Hotel management, a maall platform was 
devised and the lighting and seating rearranged. 
Bohm: Well, it's strange to be elevated and illuminated. I 
received a very big list of questions. Some of them are 
quite long, and they're al very good questions actualy. I 
appreciate them. I've read them, and I think that it's good 
that you wrote them . However I think if I were to answer 
them in that way this would not be a dialogue; I would be 
teaching you, or I would be trying to give my views one 
after another. So perhaps ifs a good idea for you to write 
the questions so that I know what's on your mind. but that 
we shouldn't actualy proced from the written questions. 
I want to thank you again for al the trouble you took 
writing these questioru. 
Now I'll begin by asking: What is inquiry? We want to 
inquire today. And I don't know the answer to most of 
your questions. (laughter) We are sort of pushing far 
beyond where I have gone. Perhaps together we can go 
forward a little. 
To begin with, why do we inquire? Does anybody have 
an idea? (pause) Because there is something that we do not 
understand; something is not working out right. As long as 
things are working out right there is no reason for a 
question. Then you raise a question. Where does the 
question come from? It must come from the same general 
mind which produced the situation that needed the 
inquiry - that is, we've been doing something wrong 
somewhere; our thoughts are wrong or our actions are 
wrong, and out of that mind we have made a question. 
That question will contain presuppositions. and we all 
know what presuppositions are. I can se this from the 
level of questions. These presuppositions are largely 
33 

Inquiry and the stre.am of dtalogue 
unaware. By the time we become aware of them we can 
call them iwumptions. We presuppose all soru of things. 
You se, when I'm going to walk on the floor I presuppose 
that it will support me, but it might not. I presuppose that 
the road is going to be OK, and that the car will work, 
and so on. Then, as son as you find it's not so, you must 
look again, and begin to se where your presuppruitions 
are wrong, and change them. So in an inquiry we are 
looking into our presuppositions. 
Now the questions will, in the beginning, reflect the 
presuppruitions that we have already. Very often we ask 
what we might cal a wrong question. I'm not meaning a 
personal insult to you or anything, but rather that part of 
the inquiry is to look at the question - to question the 
question - is it an appropriate question, or does it already 
contain presuppositions - the same ones which are 
causing us to question in the first place. So in the inquiry 
we wil go back and forth, to look into our questions and 
proced deeper. Now you can se how inappropriate it 
would be for me just to try to take these questions and 
answer them . 
. We are going to have, I hope, a dialogue. A dialogue 
doesn't mean just between two people; but rather the root 
meaning of 'dia' in Greek means 'through'. And the 
general picture it suggests is a stream running between two 
banks. It's the stream that counts. The two banks merely 
give form to the stream - the stream is common to the 
two banks. So there'll be a stream of thought or 
perception, or some sort of energy flowing between us, 
unfolding, and that would be the meaning of the dialogue. 
So I think with that introduction somebody could begin. 
Can we begin the dialogue by raising your question. 
Q: With great trepidation I'd like to suggest that perhaps 
we don't only make an inquiry on the understanding that 
something is going wrong. When you said that, I looked at 
it, and I thought very much about how children ask 
questions, and I don't know to what extent we can keep 
that in the adult state; but it sems to me that children ask 
34 

Quesioning questions 
questions out of the serue that there is a connection, and 
they want the connections made articulate. 
Bohm: Yes. I think that's a good point - that out of the 
natural curiosity which children have they simply want to 
understand, and they ask questions spontaneously. Now 
these spontaneous questions will probably have fewer 
presuppositions in them than the kind of question that we 
might ask, but I think that generally people, by the time 
they are adults, are asking questions from the point of 
view of what has gone wrong as something chalenges 
them to ask a question. If your mind is very lively, then 
you ask questions anyway. 
Q: I was also thinking of that, because my immediate 
response was, well, I don't always ask questions if 
something is wrong. However if I look at it on a wider 
scale than just the search for knowledge, or the idea that 
there is a gap there where I don't know something that I 
want to know, then there's a non-perfection indicated 
there. So it's not necesarily that something's wrong, but 
that something's not whole. 
Bohm: Something is incomplete. Yes, that would be more 
accurate; to say that you may sense something is mising, 
something is incomplete, and you're asking a question, 
how to complete it, right? 
Q: Maybe. Also I was thinking of the way inventions are 
discovered, like the steam engine was thought out from 
someone noticing the way steam behaved, and when it's 
that kind of questioning or pursuing of thought, it's like a 
means of what is implicate becoming explicate through us. 
I mean we are conductors perhaps of a creative 
intelligence. 
Bohm: Yes. That is a view that we may feel there is 
something in us, and we may ask quemons to bring it out. 
I think that gets us into something deeper then, doesn't it? 
35 

Time and thinking 
Q: Or something more shallow? 
Bohm: Well, it depends on whether it's really something in 
us. You se, we may want to just bring out some 
superficial ideas that we have; but if you have a deeply 
felt impulse you may want to bring it out - What does it 
mean? 
Q: In terms of dialogue, what cropped up for me 
immediately when you said that, is I'm going to think, 
think, think, and you have said what we need to do is go 
beyond thinking in order that things should flow through 
us more naturally. So in this context, here and now - this 
dialogue - what would be the conditions we could create 
within us for that to happen? 
Bohm: I think that we have to create them . You se, if we 
try to state these conditions we're going to get into 
difficulty. I think that there is a question of time involved 
here. If we take time in ordinary experience we have the 
present, the past and the future. Now the past is gone; it 
no longer exists except in memory. The future is just 
expecte.d. Now if you draw a line and put the present as 
the dividing point between past and future, it divides what 
doesn't exist from what doesn't exist. And that also doesn't 
exist. You se, that also raises a question. We se an 
inconsistency in our thought; that's really what I meant. 
Then we are led to raise a question; so somewhere there is 
a presupposition that's wrong. 
This linear view of time is an abstraction. It's like a 
map. You can use this map to guide you, but the map is 
not the same as the territory. The map may correspond to 
some features of the territory, but it is never complete, and 
also it may be distorted . Now actually we can say that 
thought is of the past - that it takes time to think. By the 
time you've thought anything it's over. I would like to 
make a distinction between thinking and thought. 
Th.inking, clearly, takes a lot of time because you've got to 
work it all out. And if you're dealing with something as 
36 

Thought and thinking 
fast as the mind, you can't really think it out because it's 
going faster than you can think. If we were to put 
conditions on how to establish dialogue, that would have 
to be by thinking, right? Now these conditions are 
expresed through thinking and thought. 
Certainly we could put some general conditions, like we 
should be quiet and have the right atmosphere, and so on, 
but that won't be enough. The point is that after you have 
ben thinking, this turns into thought - that is, what has 
ben thought. Now thought operates very rapidly. If you 
have ben thinking that this fellow is your enemy, then the 
minute you see him, you see him as an enemy. That is, 
whatever you have ben thinking enters your experience. 
So therefore, when we experience things, we experienet 
them filtered through thought which is too fast for 
thinking. 
One of the difficulties is that the thoughts contain all 
sorts of presuppositions which limit us and hold us in rigid 
grooves. What we have to do is to discover these 
presuppositions and get rid of them - get free of them. I 
don't think that we can establish conditions for a dialogue, 
except to say that we both want to make a dialogue. You 
se, what would it mean to try to set up conditions? 
Suppose we said that certain conditions are needed for a 
dialogue. You could say the condition is to put yourself 
aside, to be interested in the dialogue - a few things 
could be said like that, but . . .  
Q :  I'm remembering in your book, you were talking about 
relevance and irrelevance, and saying that what it takes to 
cease irrelevant thought - thought out of context - is the 
act of paying attention to that, and maybe what it takes to 
have a dialogue is the act of paying attention to having a 
dialogue. 
Bohm: Yes, I think that's the way to put it. But if we give 
attention to this dialogue, giving attention also to what is 
maybe getting in the way, then we should have the 
dialogue. 
37 

Unfolding Ithas 
Q: Does that then go beyond thought in that it becomes a 
motivation? 
Bohm: Yes, well, motivation is not nei.ìarily beyond 
thought. For example, in a detective story there's the 
motive for the crime, and usually that can be sen as a 
form of thought - the person thinb, I would like to have 
something, I need money, I feel iruecure, this person has 
made me envious, or jealous, I have to kil him now he's 
done this or that. So motivation does not necesarily go 
beyond thought; but there is a deep intention that goes 
beyond thought. 
Q: I would like to hear you say how you se the nature of 
an idea. Because an idea may arise as a result of directive 
thought, or it may come out of nowhere, as it famously 
does when you're having a bath or something - sitting in 
a bath. Suddenly an idea which is important for what you 
have ben thinking about, or indeed as a general problem 
facing mankind at that moment, or facing you at that 
moment - suddenly, whoomph, the idea is there. I 
wondered how in the enfolding, unfolding pattern, you 
would se an idea. 
Bohm: Wel, an idea I would se as a kind of sed that 
unfolds. The word 'idea' has a Greek root, meaning 
basically, to se; the same, ultimately as eidos, image. And 
it sems to have the same sort of root as the Latin, videre. 
An idea is a way of seing, just as a thought may be a way 
of seing, and I think that a new idea appears as a sort of 
sed deep in the implicate order from which unfolds all 
som of thought. As you apply the idea to your previous 
thoughts and to experience, then you find the idea 
unfolding. 
Q: How do you se thinking? Are you connecting that in 
terms of perceiving and aligning perceptions, or . . .  What 
do you think about thinking? 
38 

Elementary thinking 
Bohm: The way I se thinking is that thinking may arise 
first of al from sense perception. I think Piaget follows it. 
He shows that there is a sensorimotor thought. That is, a 
child learns to handle objects and look at them, and a kind 
of thought develops which is pre-verbal. For example, he 
may learn to handle an object, and he turns it around, 
and he turns it around again, and gets the same object 
back. Now he gets the idea of the group of two, that two 
operations bring you back to the same thing. Or he may 
walk to one place, and then around, and come back, and 
he gets the idea that there is a certain place in the room to 
which he can always return, And later he gets more 
complex ideas. For example, if an object disappears behind 
a screen and reappears later, he may treat it in the 
beginning as a new object, but later he gets the idea that 
it's the same object. Now all of this is before he has words. 
The point is that elementary thought already develops at 
the level of senses and images; he begins to form images of 
the world and space and time, and later he abstracts this 
to verbal thought and builds it up into higher and higher 
logical structures. Thinking will arise first of all from 
perception, but clearly it's affected at each stage by past 
thought. Whatever you have thought is going to affect the 
next thought, so in thinking, present perception and past 
thought are fused, as in fact it is in ordinary experience as 
well. 
One of the purposes of thinking is, as I've said, to solve 
a problem or to raise a question, to answer a question, 
whatever the source of that question may be. A person 
comes out with new thoughts, he finds his old thoughts do 
not cover the situation, and then in thinking he'll begin to 
work out new thoughts, and that takes time. We may 
form new images, new combinations of words, new ideas, 
and so on. 
Q: Then do you se ideas as being generated by the 
individual, or is there such a thing as an idea from the 
outside being transmitted horn, shal we say, some super­
mind? 
39 

Evolving ideas 
Bohm: Well, that would be difficult to answer; but 
certainly ideas pas from people to people, and very 
seldom does anybody get, actually, a totally new idea. But 
he may get a considerable change, or put old ideas 
together, or he may make a considerable change in ideas 
which have already ben present. So you can already see 
that ideas are in constant flow between people in ordinary 
ways. Now whether there is some idea coming from 
something beyond this, is difficult to say. In most cases 
you can se that the foundation of the idea was already 
laid in what came before. 
For example, if you take Newton"s idea on gravitation; 
there was a long period of development. If you go back to 
ancient times, you have the idea that celestial matter was 
very different &om earthly matter, and it was perfect -
earthly matter was imperfect - and there were al sorts of 
differences. Now, this began to be questioned as people 
came out of the middle-ages; and people found al sorts of 
ways that this was not so. They said that celestial matter 
should move in perfect circles, and when it didn't do so, 
they said, circles on top of circles - epicyclei;. They tried 
to save the idea, right? (laughter) That, by the way, 
ilustrates that you have to be ready - an idea must be 
vulnerable - you have to be ready to drop it, just as the 
person who holds the idea must be vulnerable, I think. He 
should not identify with it. 
Now Copernicus proposed that the earth was not the 
centre of al this, where8.'f the old idea was that the earth 
was the centre going up toward the heavens. And then, 
later, Kepler said that the orbits were elipses; they were 
not circleo;; they were highly imperfect, and you found 
much evidence, you se. You found that the other planets 
had sateliteo; just like the earth, and that the moon had 
very irregular mountains on it like the earth. A great deal 
of evidence accumulated suggesting that celeo;tial matter is 
not very different from earthly matter. But still there was 
a question that nobody asked. You se, I think this is a 
major inquiry. Why doesn't an object like the moon fal? 
If it's the same as earthly matter - earthly objects fall -
40 

Pre.ruppo.ritions 
why isn't the moon falling? 
You se, the mind establishes two compartments. It has 
a presupposition. You say the answer's natural, the moon 
belongs up in the sky because it's a celestial object, and 
celestial objects don't fall, right? (laughter) I mean, every 
child would feel that way. and therefore he doesn't ask the 
question. Very few children would ask the question, why 
doesn't the moon fall. Perhaps they would, but they take it 
for granted the moon is not falling because it's a different 
sort of thing. But of course, here you had these scientists 
with two different views. One was that all matter is 
similar, and the other was that it is all different. And these 
two were kept in separate compartments. Now Newton 
was supposed to have been sitting under the apple tree, 
and he saw the apple falling, and you could gues that 
what he asked himself was that if the apple is falling why 
isn't the moon falling. So that was a new question. You 
se, he noticed a discrepancy somewhere. That's what I 
meant - that somewhere something was inconsistent or 
incomplete or however you want to put it. And then he 
said, the answer is, the moon is faling. There is universal 
gravitation attracting all bodies to each other. Now that 
was a sort of flash - an implicit answer. And then he 
only had to ask why doesn't it reach the ground? Now the 
reason it doesn't reach the ground is that it is moving in a 
tangential orbit so that as it fals it also moves away from 
the earth at the same time, and it stays going around the 
circle. 
So that's probably the way in which Newton came to 
the idea of universal gravitation. Now you can see the 
ground was la.id in the whole development of a question, 
and then by simply becoming aware of the question the 
answer was already there. You se, the new idea was 
already in the question, right? So you can ask, where does 
the facility to be aware of the questions come from, and 
perhaps that's the nature of awarenes. I think a lot of this 
we may discഓ after my next talk this afternoon on 
meaning and the mind, where I am going to go into a 
view of the implicate order and the mind, and relating 
41 

The force of necesity 
mind and matter, where perhaps we could go further into 
these questions. 
Q: So does that tie in with what you call the force of 
necഒity? I was wondering, how do I get things to be 
explicate from the implicate order, in the sense of the 
previous question - where do ideas come from? How 
powerful are we to explicate from the implicate - and all 
I could find was this term 'force of necesity', and I didn't 
understand . Could you explain that? 
Bohm: This force of neces<>ity is of course a somewhat vague 
idea in my mind too. If I se an implicate becoming 
explicate, then I think of explaining it by saying that there is 
a still a deeper implicate from which arose the force which 
made it move from the implicate to the explicate - that is, 
somewhere in your mind there is implicit a question let's say. 
In the case of Newton there was a question implicit: Why 
isn't the moon falling? Now nobody asked that question. 
There was a lack of force to break through the 
compartments, right? Now from some deeper source came 
the attention needed to see that that was a question, and I 
think that force had to break through the barriers of our 
conditioning - something new. 
Normally most of what we do is the result of thought, 
which is almost like a program of a computer. We need that, 
because we need all sorts of thought. When you learn to 
drive a car ifs basicaly through thinking about it that your 
action really becomes thought , so that you don't have to 
continue to think about it. It acts rapidly. So you must have 
thought running a large part of your life, and the hope is that 
it wil be correct thought . If it's not correct thought, then you 
have to be ready to pay attention and se when it is not 
correct. The trouble is that this thought tends to run in 
grooves - perhaps we'll discus that further - in which it 
gets stuck. Why it does so is a complex question. It takes 
something to break through that. Now in an extreme case we 
would call that power genius - you se, a pasion. 
For ordinary afairs the force of necesity is largely quasi-
42 

Absolute necesity as an idea 
mechanical. That's the nature of thought; it isn't exactly 
mechanical, but it's something like a computer of a very 
subtle nature. So a great deal of our life is run that way. 
But somehow there is the power to break through that. 
Now the word 'necesary' means it cannot be otherwise. 
The root of the word is necesse, meaning it doesn't yield. 
Now there are two kinds of necesity. First of al, this 
mechanical thought has a necesity in it which doesn't 
yield; it gets stuck. But also some greater force diolves 
that so it has to yield . We used to have, when I was a 
child, the question: What happens when the irresistible 
force meets the immovable object? The point is there is an 
object that doesn't yield, and eventually it has to yield to a 
force which however may not be a force of great power in 
the ordinary serue, but a force which has great subtlety 
and depth. 
Q: It sort of digs out the object from underneath. 
Bohm : It sort of dissolves it from underneath, yes. 
Q: And makes the idea that it's a solid and spatial object 
irrelevant . 
Bohm: Yes. It brings out the irrelevance of that idea. You 
see, every idea is limited. Now we don't accept that usually, 
at least for certain ideas. For example, as we discused last 
night , the idea of nationalism is not accepted as limited 
because it takes precedence over everything else, as you can 
se in songs like Deutschland, Deutschland, uber Alles, 
which means absolutely unlimited, right? Now that idea was 
the power which drove w to the First and Second World 
Wars. It was part of the power, anyway; similar ideas 
prevailed. Hitler brought out many more ideas of this nature 
- one nation , one people, and so on. Therefore if you take 
an idea which is absolutely necesary it will generate behind 
it the force of absolute necesity ¸ the false force of absolute 
necesity. I think it's wrong for absolute necemty to come 
from an idea. Every idea mwt be vulnerable. 
43 

Contingency and necesity 
Now is there an absolute necity? Perhaps there is. We 
have to enquire. But that ahsolute necesity cannot take the 
form of any particular idea. 
A question which was implicit in all the questiow you 
raised was: What is freedom, right? And: What is the 
relation of that freedom to ahsolute necesity? My own 
feeling is that ahsolute necesity is the same as freedom. The 
true absolute nity is the same as freedom. Now if you 
don't accept that . . .  
Q :  I think it was Spinoza who said that freedom is the 
understanding of necesity. 
Bohm: Yes. It's also creativity. I think that creativity is an 
absolute necesity - in some sense. But there's also the 
mechanical necesity which blocks it. Now necesity is a very 
interesting question. You raised this question in what you 
sent me. The opposite of necesity is contingency. It comes 
from the root contingere, meaning to be touched - tangent. 
Abwlute necesity cannot be touched. It doesn't yield. What 
is contingent can yield to prure from the outside. If we 
take this chair, it has a certain kind of nity that it hold 
to¢her; but it's contingent on certain conditions. If you 
were to rlWe the temperature it would start to burn, and it 
would go to pieces. If you hit it too hard it would break. So 
it's subject to external contingencies - this necesity. Now 
normaly necesity in science should be limited by 
contingency, and this contingency in turn is another form of 
necesity, which in turn has another context in which it's 
contingent. That is, the ordinary mode of analysis by 
thought weaves between necesity and contingency. It 
cannot do otherwise; and that's a necesity. 
Now you mustn't accept this or reject this. I'm trying to 
say, you se, this is part of a dialogue. Don't accept what I 
say, but consider it, and if you have a question, please rlWe it. 
Q: I was interested in what you were saying when you were 
talking about Deut.schland,Deutschland, IJber Alles, and the 
idea that one can have a hierarchy, if you like, a hierarchy of 
44 

Freedom and necesity 
necesity and contingency, or contingency and necesity. 
Something that I don't find pleasing aesthetically is the way 
that in this world of form, movements which I might find 
unpleasant can take on a seeming nÆty. Now I wru; just 
hearing, and I don't know if I was hearing it from you, a 
posibility of creating a necesity at a lower level which is 
smaler than, or contained in, a larger necem.ity, but al the 
same, manages to sweep around with a force. What would 
you say about that? 
Bohm : Yes, well we haven't gone far enough yet. You se, I 
think in science, or in ordinary thought, we can work only in 
the realm of necesity and contingency, and in so far ru; 
scientists would set up laws which they say are absolutely 
necesary, then I think that that would tend to lead to the 
same problems that you had before with taking the order of 
an increru;ing perfection ru; absolutely necesary; or taking 
the views of the church that certain orders are absolutely 
necesary , or the state, or whatever. So a5 far a5 thinking and 
thought are concerned, it seems that we mwt have this 
interweaving of necesity and contingency. Now this is what 
allows room for freedom because whatever necesity there is, 
it is contingent . Any of these rigid necesities defined by 
thought are contingent - provided you can discover the 
contingencies. Now this is one of the ways we make progres, 
you se. We may say it's an absolute necesity that man walks 
on the ground, but actually it's contingent because he can 
also fly given different conditions, and so on. The point then 
is that most of our necesities as far as society is concerned -
with the things we don't like - arise from thought. The 
product of thinking is thought. Deutschumd, Deutschland, 
ilber Alles is thought; it's the thought of absolute n{ty. So 
most of the things we don't like are the result of the thought 
of absolute n٭ity; which however we also do like, or we 
wouldn't think of it, right? I think you get a terific feeling 
by singing that song, or the 'Horst W0el' song - any of 
these sonÇ wil give you a tremendous feeling. And that 
creates absolute necesity. But it's not true absolute necesity. 
This kind of thought is unfolding, you se; it's unfolded, it's 
45 

Thought, progra) and the brain 
constantly unfolding in our perception and action. If you 
think Deutschland, Deutschland, uber Alles, then that's the 
way you see it, and feel it. It unfolds. 
Obviously the thought is enfolded almost like a kind of 
program. This program, we're not aware of, right? The 
brain was never set up to be aware of its programs. You se, 
this is one of the difficulties of human evolution. You see, 
some people have made a theory. They say that there are 
really three brains in us: The reptilian brain, the mammalian 
brain and then the more modern cortex or intellectual brain. 
And the reptilian and mammalian brains have come to 
equilibrium and harmony so that, as far as the animal is 
concerned , it i.s more or les suited to survival. And when the 
brain suddenly expanded for some unknown reason in 
evolution, it was able to think - to produce thought - but 
it did not have the capacity to see that thought made a 
program, and that its subsequent actions were determined 
largely by that program. It did not se the program. It 
attributed the actions of the progam to the 'self. You see, if 
you sing that song long enough, you will say, 'That's me,' 
right? 'That's what I want.' You can easily se it's a program; 
but children don't have this idea at all; they sing it every day 
at school, and after a little while they've got it. 
Q: I'm just wondering where emotion comes into all this. Is 
emotion a něary product or program of thinking? 
Bohm: Emotion and thinking are almost inseparable. They 
are just different levels of the same thing. It's known that 
between the intellectual part of the brain and the emotional 
part there is a tremendous bundle of nerves going up and 
down. Every thought affects the emotions, and every 
emotion comes up to affect the thought. No thinking would 
take place without the emotion of wishing to think. And 
according to the way that desire is, thought will go in that 
dire.ction. And emotion is profoundly affected by thought 
because thought produces images, you se - not the abstract 
thought but the image and the feeling. Every thought 
unfolds into images and feelings which operate the same way 
46 

Thought and feeling 
a.o; perception would. The thought of danger will produce the 
same emotions as the perception of actual danger. And the 
same chemical behaviour. 
Q: But one can se feelinß more easily than one can se 
thoughts. I mean, anger; it's very easy to se anger coming 
up. 
Bohm: Well, it's often disguised. People often disguise anger 
a.o; something else; or else they distinguish righteous anger 
from not . . . .  
Q: But you said at the start that one can't analyse thought 
with thought. 
Bohm :  That's what I'm trying to say - that we don't se 
thought because it's a program. 
Q: But certainly I have experienced seing foelinß arise. 
Bohm: But have you ever experienced the connection 
between thought and feeling? 
Q: I'm working on it. (laughter) 
Bohm: You se, the point is that you can go back over some 
previous experience and se that by thinking in a certain way 
you became angry or afraid, and saying, 'This fellow's 
behaviour is outrageous; he can't do this to me and push me 
around,' and so on. You can se that between people; the 
thought is pasing, and the anger is building up. 
Q: You can also see it in yourself. 
Bohm: You se it in yourself, the same as every body else. 
Q: What's happening then is that we have thought running 
in a grom:e. We've just been sort of programmed. 
47 

Subtle thinking and intelligence 
Bohm: Programmed to absolute neoes.sity. 
Q: Now we've got to challenge that. We've got to come in 
and change that into something new. We've got to make 
some sort of a creative act to break out of this groove. Now 
where does that creative act come from, and how do we 
nurture it? 
Bohm: Where it comes from would be hard to say; but let me 
propose - and I'm going to go further into it when I discº 
meaning - that there are deeper and deeper levels - more 
subtle levels of implicate order - and that thought is on a 
level that is not very subtle on the whole; but thinking may 
be subtle because thinking may respond to the deeper levels 
as well as to the thought. So thinking may be a part of 
perception, if done right; or else ifs done mechanically , and 
then it gives false perception - illusion. 
Now I want to suggest, just for inquiry, that somehow in 
these deeper, subtler levels, thinking is not conditioned by 
thought. This mind is largely unconscious to us; it's stil a 
part of us, and that's still, I would say, the individual mind 
at a deeper level. You raised the question of whether there's 
something beyond the individual mind, but perhaps we 
could defer that question . 
Q: Do you mean that there is some sort of archetypal pool 
that we can dip our toes in? 
Bohm: Well, it's more of a deeper level of enfolded activity 
- very subtle - which is intelligent , and has energy and 
pasion . 
Q: And which is not motivated by the grooves of thought. 
Bohm: Yes. The grooves of thought are rather on the surface, 
you se. 
Q: And it filters through them? 
48 

Thought and reality 
Bohm: It doesn't only filter through them, it's got to dissolve 
them. The reason we're not conscious of this is that these 
grooves produce such tremendous effects. If you go to a place 
like Reno, Nevada, or Las Vegas, and we turn on all these 
electric lights, then you don't see the stars, and you say that 
al these electric light'S are the main thing, and there is no 
universe. (l.aughter) Thafs the way people obviously feel at 
that place, right? (laughter) And they blot out the universe. 
So when you turn off the electric lights, then the universe 
comes through. At first it sems something very faint, but 
that faint thing may represent something immense, whereas 
the very powerful bright thing may represent nothing much. 
Q: What we sem to be talking about is a whole proces of 
invisible thought-forms, and somewhere I feel the need of 
reality. Somehow we can't actually get to reality because we 
are stuck behind this screen of thoughts. 
Bohm: Well, when it comes to ordinary experience, you se 
how to get to reality. We say the world here is real; it exists 
independently of thought. Evidently, this chair - I can have 
enough experience to se, enough intelligence to se that this 
chair does not depend very significantly on how I think 
about it, or how you think about it. What I do with it may 
depend on how I think about it, and that could be changed; 
but if I don't do anything with the chair, it will go its own 
way, and my thoughts will go their way. Now that's OK for 
objects which are fairly separate from us, and which don't 
change too fast because, you see, our thoughts are behind the 
reality. This chair is actually changing but in a subtle way all 
the time. In a hundred or two hundred or five hundred years 
it would slowly disintegrate . Now that change is 
unimportant. So for certain categories of proces the thought 
captures enough of the reality so it's a good guide. So we say 
here that we've got objective reality; we've got a firm grip on 
it. Our technology has produced tremendous results out of 
this thinking which takes a firm grip on reality through 
experiment, through calculation and through reason, and so 
on. 
49 

Objective reality 
Now when we come to the mind and the sphere of morals 
and ethi, and so on, and emotions, al that we've done that 
way, it sems, hasn't got us anywhere. What is the objective 
reality of myself? Am I an object at all, or what's the 
difference between subject and object? What is the nature of 
the reality of myself and my thoughts? The problem arises 
there. You'll se yourself, or else the civilization, or that the 
whole of society is in the same situation - that I suppose you 
are there, and all of us are here, and I may have some 
presuppositions about al of us. Is there an objective reality 
which corresponds? If I presuppose the floor will hold me 
up, the objective reality would support it; but I may 
presuppose all sorts of thinh about you or society which have 
nothing to do with objective reality. Now that is the thing we 
have to inquire into. How do we prģ into this area? 
Even in the sphere of objective reality, if you consider 
subtle proceses like quantum mechani. similar problems 
arise. We don't have that sharp separation between thinh -
observer and observed. And also thinh are in flux, enfolding 
and unfolding. Also if you consider long intervals of time, 
your thoughts become inadequate; things change in ways 
you didn't know about. So the notion of thought grasping an 
objective reality is limited. Now I think that science tends to 
proced from the asumption that that is potentially 
unlimited; that that's all there is; that it can be grasped that 
way. But it's clear that if you look at the mind, that notion 
just hasn't got anywhere. 
Q: rm looking at this example: There is a bed of hot coals in 
the middle of this room, and I walk across them barefoot. 
My objective reality would be that I would bum myself 
badly, but then there are people who can walk acros them. 
Bolun: But that's not a difficult question, you se. Similarly, 
if I tried to run ten miles, I couldn't do it. I would probably 
collapse and end up with a heart attack. But if somebody else 
does it, they might do it quite easily. You have different 
people with different capacities, and you may suppose that 
some people have the capacity to bring their bodies into a 
50 

The wholene.s oj the whole and the parts 
different state so they don't bum. I don't want to say yes or 
no about that. But that creates no serious problem. You se, 
the question is: Do you have a complete idea about objective 
reality? The answer is no. 
Q: The question then is: What is the connection between the 
subtler levels of the implicate order and objective reality? I 
think we've taken these grooves, or these surface ripples, to 
be objective reality and tried to measure them and se how 
concrete they are. Well, two things: If they weren't there, 
and the habit of getting into grooves weren't there, then 
perhaps it would be a completely different world. 
Bohm: The objective reality is there. You se this room is 
here, and so on. Like I said last night, there are two 
principles - the wholenes of the whole and the pa£, and 
the partiality of the parts and the whole, Now we must adopt 
both principles but say which one is ultimate. That's where 
the choice takes place. 
Q: Why do you have to say which one is ultimate? 
Bohrn: Well, if you say neither is ultimate then I think you're 
going to say that we just have maxims that we apply. It's a 
sort of indeterminate thing depending entirely on whatever 
happens. Now you have to say that your world view, the 
way you look at things, is part of you, just as any other 
thought is a part of you. It will determine the way you 
approach the world. One way is to approach the world 
neutrally and say, I'm not going to adopt either principle 
finally . What kind of world will that produce? The other 
way is to say that I'm going to propose that either the major 
theme is wholen®, or that it is partiality . Now if I don't 
decide either , if I think pĬively , I'm deciding that the 
major theme is partiality, because then I have the two 
opposing basic principles. 
Q: Then there is nothing above just thought-store; and you 
said that there are things which are likely to be beyond 
51 

The act of faith 
thought . Therefore you don't have to make a choice; you 
aren't forced into a choice. I still don't se how one is forced 
into a choice there . 
Bohm: Well , I don't say we are absolutely forced into a 
choice. I'm saying that there may be a good reason for a 
choice, in the serue that I'm proposing that if you say 
wholenes is ultimate, you always leave room for the 
partiality where it is called for. Then your attitude is going to 
be one of bringing about wholenD ultimately. Whereas if 
you don't make the choice, then you are saying that there is 
no reason to choose betwe.en partiality and wholeni. 
Q: But making a choice is then an act of faith. 
Bohm: Yes. I think at some stage everybody makes some kind 
of an act of faith in the serue faith was define.cl by Teilhard 
de Chardin, as just simply that the intelligence holds to 
certain things - finally to a certain world view. You se, 
even to take your suggestion woqld still be an act of faith, 
that that would be a better approach, right? That is, you 
cannot avoid making this act of faith. Therefore the question 
is: Which one should we suggest? 
Q: Is it n٪ary to make a choice between wholenes and 
partiality? Coudn't we say, wholenes and partiality together 
as the ultimate? 
Bohm: But then you 've chosen wholenes, you se - tacitly. 
Tacitly, that is the choice , that the two together make the 
whole. You see, I think that's tacitly a choice of w holenj 
because then we say, w holenj and partiality. As I said, the 
wholenes of the whole and the parts is your choice . 
Q: I'd like to pursue that . Suppose we say 'isnes' is ultimate, 
which includes wholenj and partiality . 
Bohm: Yes, then what is 'isnes'? 
52 

Accentuating Wholenes 
Q: Yes, you can ask further questions, but you don't have to 
choose between wholen) and partiality. 
Q: You could say 'void' imtead of 'isn)· if you prefer. 
Q: I think there is a presupposition in 'isnes', actually. I 
mean there is a presuppo.sition of wholen) in that, at least 
that's my impr)ion. 
Q: I appreciate that, but you see, everything has a 
presu ppo.sition. 
Bohm: The question is then: Which presupposition are we 
choosing? 
Q: Yes. I really feel that you have to choo.se between 
wholenes and partiality, but I do not feel that it's necesary. 
You can transcend the two, and go to the next level, and 
include the two. You don't have to choose. 
Q: Isn't there also a danger in choo.sing - that once you've 
made a choice between these two you are stuck with an 
invulnerable necesity? 
Bohm: Well, not really, becawe in any concrete situation we 
say that the partiality may prevail. You see, it's merely a sort 
of general attitude to favour wholen). 
Q: Isn't it a question of trying on a new mind-set? It demeans 
it to call it a mind-set; but isn't it a question of not saying that 
the scope of that insight, or the scope of that elevation of 
wholen) as opposed to partiality, is absolute and 
irrevocable and will continue forever, but just to bring that 
up for a moment to see where that takes us? Because we can't 
know until we've done that where it might take us. 
Bohm: Yes. I'm taking as a proposal to inquire into talcing 
the accentuation of wholenes as our approach. All of my 
thought is in the nature of proposals here, and we could also 
53 

The value of metaphysical discusion 
propose 'isnes.s'; we could try to explore the relative 
advantages or disadvantages of these. Now if I propose to 
emphasize wholenes, then in any concrete irutance you're 
always free to discus partiality. But there is a sort of general 
attitude that we are disposed toward wholenes. 
Q: Isn't the conclusion - well, obviowly there isn't a 
conclusion - but if we followed the concept of wholenes 
through, would it not come to the Eastern idea that 
everything is there, and nothing exists, and in order to keep 
our sanity or purpose, or recognize things connected with 
order in the world, we then have to take up dualism? This 
may be where our friend says, can we accept wholism and 
partiality, so that the partiality aspect is the dualism that we 
need to learn lesons which lead us towards wholism -
towards onenes. If we could ever get there, then there 
would be nothing that we could imagine that existed 
separately. 
Bohm: Well, we have in that way a duali.sm between 
wholenes and partiality. That is what I wanted to get 
beyond. You could say that 'isnes' transcends dualism. 
One would then want to say that 'isnes' is ultimately of 
the nature of wholenes, though it contains partiality as a 
real contribution. 
Let me try to put it differently. I think that if we try to 
look at this as a description of reality it will make no 
sense. We cannot discus metaphysics in this way - that 
our metaphysical ideas are corresponding to some object 
that they are describing. Rather, we may ask: What is the 
use of metaphysical ideas altogether? We don't know the 
nature of reality ultimately. What is the point of 
describing it or talking about it? Well, one view is to say 
there is no point, and a lot of modern philosophers and 
scientists say we shouldn't do it. And that's a reasonable 
approach up to a point. But everybody has tacit 
metaphysical ideas even though he has explicitly 
disavowed them . And therefore ultimately that way of 
doing it is only going to put you under the control of 
54 

The dance of the mind 
whatever metaphysical ideas you happen to have adopted 
as presuppositons, perhaps in early childhood. So I think it 
is valuable to explore your metaphysical ideas, to question 
them , and to propose new metaphysical ideas , and so on. 
When we discuss metaphysics - the nature of reality as 
a whole - we cannot say we are making a picture of this 
ultimate reality, but rather we have to say that thought is 
a movement. That is, thinking and thought are a dance of 
the mind. The question is, what order of dance? Like the 
dance of the bes which indicates the direction of the 
honey in the distance. Now in this dance of the mind, I 
think all of us want to bring about the greatest possible 
harmony, realizing that a certain amount of disorder and 
fragmentation is inevitably part of that harmony. The 
question is, which one will tend to do that? If we say that 
truth - the pragmatists have said that truth is that which 
works, but they usually have a rather narrow idea of what 
they mean by work, in some narrow domain - but if we 
say that truth is that which brings about an overÐall action 
toward harmony and order, and which we cannot define, 
as I said last night. . .  
Q :  Going on from that harmony, if we ever achieve that 
perfect harmony, then there will be no movement of 
thinking. 
Bohm: No. I'm not saying we are ever going to achieve it, 
but it will move in that direction. There is no final 
metaphysics. I'm trying to say that there are merely 
proposals. You se, if we say 'isnd· is the fundamental, 
that would also not be a final metaphysics, but it would 
be open to still more proposals. 
Q: I would fear that that too is an asumption, that if we 
achieve harmony there wouldn't be any more movement. 
Q: Well, there are two p٫ible analogies here. 
Q: Could you describe what you mean before the 
55 

Harmony and movement 
analogies. 
Q: That every thing has a purpose - to achieve peace and 
harmony. That is a belief system, or perhaps what I might 
think is necesary. Then that leads to stillna<i and 
nothingnê and the Indian idea of the Cunas, the three 
aspects of life, perhaps being the movement from one to . . .  
Q :  We are getting away from the a<iential point. I can say 
that I experience harmony when I run, when I hurdle, 
and I know I'm experiencing a lot of harmony, but I'm 
moving. 
Q: Like harmony in an orchestra or something? 
Somethings moving, but it doesn't mean that the 
orchestra's stopped. 
Q: The concept of harmony doesn't exist except also in the 
presence of disharmony. 
Bohm: Yes. I would agree with that. What I'm saying is, 
the movement is - given disharmony - there's a 
tendency to move to a harmony. That is really what I 
want to emphasize. And I agree with what you said, that 
harmony is movement. But the question really is deeper 
than that because it's a question of whether movement is 
repetitive or creative. And harmony requires creativity, 
but that requires some disharmony. 
Q: The electron and proton. If we say that electrons are 
going around a nucleus, they are in disharmony in fact, 
because they in themselves, if they were being selfish, 
would be actually trying to get somewhere. I mean, there 
is a force there. If they ever said, ·Ah, now we've got 
peace and harmony,' and sat down and rested, there 
would be no electron. So this is what I understand by 
disharmony needing harmony. 
Q: Harmony doesn't mean there is no tension between the 
56 

Creative movement 
parts. Tension is almost esential for harmony. It is not 
stillnes; it is more of an active stillnes. 
Bohm : Of course. Yes. You see, if you take a musical 
composition, harmony is the harmony of movement, and 
movement of various themes which have tension between 
them. 
Q: Not if it is a John Cage. (laughter) 
Bohm : Yes. Well, he's been trying something else; but in 
general that is the nature of harmony, that its very nature 
is harmony in movement. However if any pattern of 
movement is established and starts to become repetitive, 
then that is a kind of disharmony. At least in certain areas 
it may be disharmonious; it's part of the harmony of the 
universe that the pattern of the electron is repetitive; but 
it's not part of the harmony of human beings to 
continually repeat a pattern. 
Q: I wanted to hark back to a point you made earlier, 
that we aren't able to pin down the ultimate, and that we 
have got to have a model of it as a way of looking at it. 
We make models of the ultimate reality, and I think what 
we are trying to get at is that we should know we are 
making models. 
Bohm : Yes. We should know we are making models and 
realize they are not models of ultimate reality, but 
proposals. They are part of the dance of the mind. They 
are not models of anything at all really. Rather we are 
proposing that if we carry out this dance in this way, that 
the general result will be more harmonious - not in the 
nature of something static - but rather in the nature of a 
creative movement. 
Q: But that then begs the question of how do we carry out 
the dance to produce these harmonies. 
57 

Kicking the cat 
Bolun: Well, you can't answer that question any more 
than you can answer the question of how anybody carries 
out any dance precisely , 
Q: The nature of the dance is spontaneous . 
Q: But at the end of the day you have got to live in the 
world, and how do these ideas of wholenes help you live 
more usefuly in the world? 
Q: Ahl (laughter) I've ben tremendously excited and 
illumined by this so far because for the last five or six years 
I have ben involved in something called The Hunger 
Project, and the whole point of that is to say that what 
kee« death by starvation in place is not what we usually 
identify, but is a mind-set, or a thought pattern - some 
tacit metaphysical li'iumption that hunger is inevitable. 
And the breakthrough, if we can use that expr¬ion, is to 
addres that thought pattern - that hunger is inevitable 
- to breal through that, to create the possibility of people 
thinking - having the thought - that hunger can end. 
There isn't space in the world at the moment for the 
thought that hunger can end, although the physical 
evidence that it could end before the year two thousand is 
in the . . .  
Q :  I was working at a much more down to earth level. 
Bohm: Well, it's the same question in everyday life, you 
se. 
Q: You can get al excited about things like this, and then 
go home and still kick the cat - go home and still kick the 
cat after becoming inspired. 
Bohm: Yes. Well in that case there is still disharmony, and 
you have to find out what is causing you to kick the cat. 
You se, there are certain fixed ideas about the cat or 
something else (laughter). Obviously the cat is representing 
58 

Choosing wholenes or partiality 
something else that you would like to kick, right? You see 
that everyday life is just the place where this question 
arises. There are all sorts of fixed thoughts which give rise 
to disharmony, which is not of the creative kind of tension 
but rather just generally fragmentary and destructive. 
Q: We can't rule out pathological sources of disharmony. 
You needn't look for a metaphysical explanation. People 
may have disharmony due to emotional problems. We 
don't need to look for a metaphysical explanation. 
Bohm: But the emotional problems may be connected with 
metaphysics. You see, there is their view of themselves in 
the world. 
Q: It could be pragmatic; it might be infantile. 
Bohm: Yes, but thafs metaphysical too. The infant has a 
very strong metaphysics in which he puts himself at the 
centre of the universe. 
Q: If you think that they"re separate from the whole, you 
are going to have problems. 
Bohm: Yes. Now say we want to eliminate hunger, and 
we se that certain metaphysical attitudes are in the way. 
So we ask a question here: Why do we want to eliminate 
hunger? In fact many people would say that since I am a 
separate being, it's of no interest to me - of no great 
interest to eliminate hunger. So the attitude that people 
have to each other, as to whether mankind is a whole ӫ 
whether the ultimate wholenù is primary, or the 
partiality - is crucial. Now you could say, 'Well, I'll 
decide on each case according to my convenience whether 
it's going to be partiality or wholenes.' You oould say, 
'Well, at this moment. ifs more convenient for me to 
decide on partiality.' So I feel that some sort of choice -
not actualy choice but perception - that the ultimate 
wholen is the primary feature that wil lead to greater 
59 

Kicking the cat again 
harmony in the sense of creative harmony , than would the 
other one. Or I think, even the neutral one. Then you've 
opened up the question: When will it be? And I think you 
are saying tacitly - in so far as you are thinking of the 
good, and so on - you are already saying wholenes is 
primary because the good, the same as health, is wholenes 
- sanity is wholenes, holy is whole, and the very word 
'good' means whole as well. It has the same root as 
'gathering'. There is a tacit notion in all of this that 
wholenes is in some sense what has ultimately to prevail. 
Even its 'isnes'. Even if you say you are kicking the cat, 
well, why shouldn't you kick the cat? 
Q: Because it produces suffering for the cat and yourself. 
Bolun: Yes, but that suffering is a manifestation of 
fragmentation in your thoughts and feeling. You see, if 
somebody was really very cruel, he would say, 'I don't 
care if the cat suffers - this is one of those instances 
where partiality must prevail,' and he says, Tm one thing 
and the cat is another, so what does it matter what 
happens to the cat?' You se, somewhere, tacitly, there is a 
notion of wholenes behind your whole problem. 
Q: So basically, kicking the cat is also hurting you because 
you are not really separate from the cat. 
Bolun: Yes, and because ultimately you want wholenes 
between you and the cat, and not separation. 
Q: I can se that, but how to realize that in my everyday 
life? 
Bolun: Well, that I think is a long question. That requires 
attention to your thoughts. That is, if you feel the impulse 
to kick the cat, the point is you suspend that impulse . You 
begin to se that there are thoughts behind it. I don't 
know what they would be - the thought of frustration, or 
the thought that something is in your way, or something 
60 

Harmo11y a11d ethics 
- and you have to begin to follow those thoughts. 
Q: That is part of my earlier question about anger. I 
mean, the difference between the feeling and the thought. 
Bolun: I'd say fundamentally they flow into each other; 
they enfold each other. Feeling is implicitly a thought 
because if you have a feeling this gives rue to a thought, 
and a thought is implicitly a feeling. We are going to 
discus.s that this afternoon. So the thought that this cat is 
in the way, or the thought that somebody has done 
something nasty to me and I need to release - I should do 
something - will give rise to the feeling. You se, the 
thought that a shadow is an àailant will give rise to the 
feeling of fear. So you cannot separate your thoughts and 
feelings. They are two sides of the same proces. 
Q: But if you want to actually put these ideas into 
everyday life, you've got to stop the fault - wanting to 
kick the cat - actually going into kicking the cat. 
Bolun: Well, the first thing is you are not aware of the 
thought of wanting to kick the cat. You just become aware 
of the feeling of wanting to kick the cat. We are not 
generally aware of the thought that is behind it. I'm trying 
to say that the thought was like a program, and I come 
back to the notion that when man evolved, he began to 
think - produce thought - and he didn't realize he was 
making programs which would have a profound effect on 
him. The real question is, how to be aware of these 
programs. That would greatly change everyday life. 
Q: We sem to have come to the point where we as.sume 
that the universe is ultimately ethical and harmonious. 
You know that if you kick the cat you have done 
something wrong by present day standards. But 
neverthele:M, looking at the universe as a whole, is there 
any particular reason to think that there is that ultimate 
harmony which we have somehow lost and have to regain? 
61 

The urge toward harmony 
Bohm: Well , this is a difficult question. One can se 
harmony and order in the laws of the universe at a rertain 
time, in certain areas. Of course, there is also disruption . 
Now I don't think we can find this in the universe. You 
se, the question is: Do we find it in us? Because the 
. 
universe which we se is sen from the outside; it's only an 
abstraction which scientists make, and science has made it 
according to the way we happen to think , and according 
to the amount of information we happen to have gathered, 
and so on. The views of the universe have changed all the 
time , even in the past 20 or 30 years, and might change 
again. Now one view is to say that we, in some sense, are 
a manifestation of something deeper in the universe than 
the things that scienre is able to show explicitly . And do 
we find this in ourselves, is the question. This may have 
more significance than what can be found scientifically . 
Q: You se, what our friend there implies is that you only 
kick the cat if you are pathological . Whereas perhaps 
kicking the cat is just a natural thing to do, although it 
may be wrong by our standards. You se, if you hurt the 
cat , and you hurt yourself, then there is a lot of hurt in 
you, and perhaps it belongs there, you know. Who says it 
doesn't? 
Bohm: Well, it's a complicated question. You se, when 
the cat jumps on another animal then that's just getting its 
meal, but when you kick the cat you cannot se any reason 
of that nature why you would do it. You are simply 
inventing something, a conflict in yourself, trying to get 
rid of it. That is usualy what happens. Therefore you are 
fragmented and you sense that's not a right state, you se. 
Ifs also not right to kick the cat because you feel a certain 
relationship to the cat, and so on. I think it goes deeper 
than just the thoughts people happen to have on the 
subject, but the thoughts have a profound efect in making 
you kick the cat. 
But, I think we discover in ourselves a movement or an 
urge toward harmony, toward the good as we say, which 
62 

Good and bad. sin and repentance 
people have almost lost sight of today because everybody is 
so cynical; everybody is just for himself, number one 
comes first, and we are just moving on toward 
catastrophe, and so on. In the past people did accept the 
notion that there was the good, right? Now I still think it's 
so, that there is something in us which is the good. It may 
be hidden by all these thoughts which we get in the 
newspapers, and so on. There is this flow of bad news. 
But I think it's important that we have to hold to that 
good. That's what I meant by faith. I'm not saying that I 
know that it's true, but it's the approach - the only 
approach I can se that will make serue and give us any 
possibility at all. If we don't take this approach then I 
think we are finished. 
Q: I'd like to see your definition of good. 
Bohm: Well, that I can't define. 
Q: I feel that what is good is what is corutructive and 
facilitating to the whole. 
Bohm: Yes. I would agree with that. I mean, if we define 
it too far it's going to get in the way. We get a feeling for 
the good, and we can try to expres what we mean in a 
rough way, but if we don't have that feeling for the good 
then I think we have nowhere to begin. That is, in this 
case, feeling is deeper than thought, and the thoughts are 
coming out of the feelings - out of that feeling comes the 
thought of the ultimate wholenes.c1 of the whole and the 
parts. That is, the thought tends to expres that feeling. 
Q: From what you've just said, do you mean that we can 
develop a sort of self-reference to what's good without 
recognizing the bad? 
Bohm: I don't think there is the bad, except we would say 
that - you se, there is the word 'sin', and apparently 
there was a Creek word in the bible meaning . . . .  
63 

Mising the mark 
Q: Hamartia, mising the point. 
Bohm: Missing the point. Yes, hamartia which meant 
mising the point, missing the mark. Now that got 
translated as sin. And repentance was mdanoia, meaning 
a transformation of the mind. and got tramlated as pain, 
right? Penitence, repentance. The point is that repentance 
is merely to understand that you misst--d the mark, you se? 
(1.aughter) Therefore evil is missing the mark, basically. It 
is confusion, right? Its ultimate source is the kind of 
confusion I described about thought. 
Q: The correct idea in that context is metanoia which 
means not only recognizing that you have mised the 
mark, but a change in attitude. 
Bohm: Yes. I meant to say that. You would understand, 
not just missing the mark, but you would really 
understand what it means. 
Q: So, what is the idea of guilt? 
Bohm : I think guilt is a very destructive idea. There is 
responsibility, which is correct, but guilt is a very 
destructive notion. That programs you in a very bad way. 
Q: You've just got to know that you have mmed the 
mark? 
Bohm: Yes, and not only know it, but understand it 
deeply, and feel it so that you don't do it again. So if we 
say there is no guilt then evil arises in human afairs 
because man did not understand that when thinking he 
produced thought, which was a program. He is 
programmed by that, and he mis.ses the mark. You se, 
that is my suggestion. Man became confwed, and gave it a 
substantial meaning by the word 'evil', and that made it 
far worse. Because then he said, there is something called 
evil, which I must overcome. But the brain that mises the 
64 

Changing the program 
mark is trying to overcome the result of what it itself is 
doing. it's still missing the mark by calling it something 
else. 
Q: By putting it outside. 
Bohm: Yes. Putting it outside its real source. The real 
source is that I'm mis.sing the mark. Suppose I'm an 
archer, and I mi{ the mark, and I say some evil spirit 
made me mw the mark. That would never get me 
anywhere. So man's misunderstanding of good and evil 
was one of the principal reasons - that's a metaphysical 
notion, good and evil - that metaphysical notion was one 
of the principal reasons for the propagation of evil. It got 
in the way of people seeing the real source of the trouble. 
And even created tremendous pasion and violence, and 
added to the evil . 
Q: I think it's very important to find out why we keep on 
doing this. Because I find in my life that when I do 
something which is like this kicking the cat, it doesn't sort 
it out. I kick some other cats. It doesn't stop the pattern of 
doing nasty things; just goes around me like - boom, 
bom, boom, bom - as well as when I do something 
that feels realy good. 
Bohm: Yes. Well, the pattern - the bad pattern - goes 
that way because it's a program. You se, once the 
computer has been programmed it repeats the operation in 
every context, and the question is: Is it pÍible to change 
the program? Thinking cannot change it because it's much 
too fast. Thought cannot change it because it doesn't 
understand it. Is there something faster still that can touch 
the program and really change the brain cells which cany 
the program - iron it out, you se? Now, I think that is 
crucial; that is the source of what we've been calling evil 
and sin and so on, and we can se that this was an 
inevitable problem that mankind would face in evolution 
once the brain got bigger and able to produce thought , but 
65 

A٩ming evil 
not knowing what thought does. That is crucial. Now I 
think that what I say this afternoon will perhaps be 
relevant to that. Now it's getting a little late unles 
somebody has a very important question. 
Q: I have two. (laughter) 
Bohm: Make it one. (laughter) 
Q: Well, maybe you have answered it, but why, if we do 
sense an ultimate good or whole, and that this is in the 
proces of unfolding, why was there something in us that 
caused thĒ polluted thought forms? 
Bohm : You se, we shouldn't use the word 'polluted'. That 
is almost the same as the word 'evil', you see. It creates an 
emotional overtone that is destructive. We mu.st look at 
evil neutraly and factually. Don't call it evil because the 
word 'evil' is already loaded; the word 'polluted' is already 
loaded; so the word is mis.sing the mark. The brain was 
going to mis the mark because it did not know that it was 
producing thought which programs you. The programs are 
not intelligent, and they wil inevitably, sooner or later, 
mi.s.s the mark. I mean no machine can be programmed to 
anticipate al eventualities. Somewhere it is going to do 
something wrong. And then the attempt to correct it 
makes it worse because the brain attempts to correct it 
under the ഑umption that it is due to some external cause. 
Its action is wrong, and it gets worse, so evil multiplies if 
you as.sume evil. That is, the asumption of evil produces 
the indefinite multiplication of evil. Therefore a great deal 
of what has gone on in the world's religions and morality 
is really mising the mark. 
Q: We have a choice all the time about whether we 
choase to live in a universe in which there is evil. Or we 
appear to make a choice; I mean our choice is that we 
want to have evil in it. 
66 

The selj image and mUsin.g the mark 
Bohm: It's not clear. People don't understand that they are 
mising the mark, you se. If an archer mises the mark he 
has no choice; his muscles are conditioned. and his eye, in 
such a way that he doesn't do it right. Now the choice is 
not in the matter of whether you mis the mark or not 
because you can't choose that; but whether you - wel, 
it's realy a question of metanoia - repentance - you not 
only acknowledge. but you deeply understand and feel 
how you are mising the mark; so you stop it. Now the 
choice is therefore to look in that direction. You cannot 
choose to stop mising the mark. If you are a bad archer, 
or a bad whatever. you cannot choose to become a gocxl 
one. 
Q: But you can practice. 
Bolun: But then you have to be attentive as you practice to 
how you are mising the mark. If you don't do that. then 
you won't learn. 
Q: Actualy try it again. Perhaps people try, and have to 
be aware of why . . . what's going on. 
Bohm: Yes. That's it. But the thing that prevents that is 
that this may interfere with your self-image. You se, you 
don't like to be aware of it because you have an image of 
yourself as perfect, or something. You se, that is also 
another problem that comes in. We al have it, right? 
Q: It's interesting to se how in talking about observing by 
how far we mis the mark, we perceive evil as opĐ to 
our mising the mark. We don't actualy look at the target 
that we are firing the arrow at; we look out into the evil 
universe for the cause of whatever has come along. 
Bohm: Yes. And we also don't notice what we have done 
to produce this mising the mark. This is the crucial point. 
We attribute the thing, as you say, to something outside or 
inside, some mysterious force. We don't notice that some 
67 

Language 
perfectly simple thing we are doing is mising the mark. 
Q: Then fighting evil doesn't achieve - doesn't make any 
good. 
Bohm: It adds to the evil, you se. Fighting evil - the 
very umption of evil - multiplies evil. That's how 
metaphysics comes in. Evil is a metaphysical notion and, 
you se, the smallest: child gets the notion of good and evil; 
he's got a lot of metaphysics. 
Q: Would the umption of fragmentation add to 
fragmentation? The structure of our discourse is very 
paradoxical isn't it? We asume wholenes, but we are 
always talking about fragmentation, and good and evil. 
Bohm: Well, we are calling attention to that 
fragmentation of good and evil which is the source of what 
we have ben calling evil. We have got to call attention to 
how we are missing the mark. That's why it looks like a 
paradox. We cannot call attention to how to hit the mark. 
That happens in a way that you cannot describe. But what 
you can call attention to is how you are mising the mark, 
right? Do you se the point? 
Q: Well, I feel it's very problematic that you are trying to 
bring something about and in doing that you have to 
repeat old habits of talking. The structure of your 
discourse is fragmentary. 
Bohm: How would you say that? 
Q: Well, for instance, you introduced a new mode of 
using language, a philosophical reinterpretation of 
language, a 'rheomode'. Well, if you would be actually 
using that, I suppose you would be out performing what 
you're pointing at, but you can't do that because no one 
could talk to you on those terms. 
68 

Communication and mising the mark 
Bohm: Agreed. But therefore we have to do the í we 
can . You see. the present language is highly fragmentary, 
but it has poîibilitie<1 for being used correctly - skillfully 
and correctly. You se, as we we the language we may 
mw the mark or we may not, right? The present language 
is not a hopelï confwion, because you have used it to tell 
me that it is fragmentary. You have some confidence in 
the language, right? Well, I'm telling you the way in 
which I have some confidence in the language. Confidence 
is the same as faith, right? The same root. So the point is 
that the necesity of this moment forces us to use this 
language. I hope that eventually we will - human beings 
wil - have a better language. But we've got to start here 
where we are. 
Now this language is a mixture of all sorts of things, and 
it can be used skillfully and creatively and artistically to 
say things which cannot be said in the ordinary way, like, 
take Shake<1peare as compared to an ordinary detective 
story. So the thing is, we have got to work to use this 
language to communicate properly. And each time that we 
have not communicated, then we have missed the mark. 
You cOUld call that a sin if you like; failure of 
communication is a sin if you like. This is just a word -
not that I advocate that - but just to show the meaning 
of the whole situation . You see, it's tough to communicate 
in this language, but that is the challenge we face. There 
is no other way that I can se . 
Q: It would be intelligent to analyze why you mw the 
mark wouldn't it? And wouldn't the answer always be that 
you had departed from the principle of whatever it 
actually is? So you are lacking the correct idea of the 
principle. 
Bohm: Well, no. I think it's different from that - that the 
principle you are given is abstract; it is not part of you. 
What is part of you is your habits of moving your mwcle<1, 
which is partly the result of your way of thinking pre­
verball y from early childhood. Your nerve<1 and m uscle<1 
69 

The problem of conditioning 
are set in a certain way so that you cannot do other than 
to mw the mark the way you are conditioned, the way 
you are programmed. I think that is the way you 
experience it. You try it, and you mw the mark, right? 
You try it again, and you mw the mark. Now perhaps 
with the aid of a slcillful teacher, or quite careful 
attention, you begin to se some of the movements you are 
making that are causing you to mw the mark. You 
gradually feel out how you can change those movements, 
and slowly you come toward the mark. The same is true 
in communication, or in any other sphere. Therefore you 
don't condemn yourself for rowing the mark and call it a 
sin, because that will already throw you off, you Î? But 
rather you say, well that is all that happened, and it has 
some reason which is in me, my conditioning, you se. 
Everybody is conditioned according to his history. The 
conditioning is as much muscular as it is ideas and 
emotions. If you have not ben trained in a certain way 
you will find it quite imÏble to do these movements -
or if you have never paid attention to it. 
Q: That, of course, is the whole movement behind the 
Alexander and Feldenkreis approach to body work. 
Bohm: Yes. For example, in the Alexander method they 
train you not by words but by actually pushing on you to 
get you to do the movements. You se, the words could 
never tell you how to do it. 
Q: Isn't there a danger here that every time I kick the cat 
I say, 'Oh, that is not sin, I have just mmed the mark and 
kicked the cat?' (laughter) 
Bohm: If you don't mind that you have kicked the cat, 
there is no problem, you se. 
Q: You have diminished the problem because it is no 
longer evil? 
70 

Displaced emotions 
Bohm: No. Look. Do you mind it because it is evil, or do 
you mind it for some deeper reason? You se, generally 
people call kicking the cat evil, and therefore they say, 'I 
feel bad because I kicked the cat. If they didn't call it evil, 
then it wouldn't bother me.' You se, I don't think that's 
the attitude. There is a deeper feeling that kicking the cat 
is the result of mising the mark - that I have some 
emotional disturbance really directed in some other way, 
and instead I turned it toward the cat, which is mng 
the mark, right? I mean, that is the thing that is wrong 
with it. Now if you said, 'I enjoy kicking cats.' (laughter) 
A tiger can say, 'I pounce on the deer and this is my life 
and there is nothing wrong with it, it's jw:t getting my 
meal.' 
Q: I fel I ought to point out that I do not have a cat. 
(laughter) You see why. (More laughter) 
Bohm: There's not much time left. I appreciated you 
writing these questions, and if you want to write them to 
me again, I would like to see them for tomorrow. But 
again we will follow the same procedure. 
71 

SOMA·SIGNIF1CANCE : 
A NEW NOTION OF THE RELATIONSHIP 
BE1WEEN THE PHYSICAL AND THE MENTAL 
After a walk through the Cotswold Hill.T the group 
gathered again for Profesor Bohm 's second talk, which 
introduced some oj the most recent extensions of his work. 
Profe.w>r Bohm: Today I want to intrcxluce a new notion of 
meaning which I call se>ma·significance, and also a notion of 
the relationship between the physical and the mental. This 
relationship has ben widely considered under the name 
psycho.se>matic. 'Psyche' comes from a Greek word meaning 
mind or soul, and 'soma' means the bcxly. If we generalize 
soma to mean the physical, the term psycho.se>matic s1,1ggests 
two different kind of entities each existent in itself, but both 
in mutual interaction. In my view such a notion intrcxluces a 
split, a fragmentation, between the physical and the mental 
that doesn't properly correspond to the actual state of affairs. 
Instead I want to suggest the introduction of a new term 
which I call 'soma.significance'. This emphasi7.es the unity of 
the two, and more generally, with meaning in al its 
implications and aspects. That is, 'significance' goes on to 
'meaning' which is a more general word. 
In this approach meaning is clearly being given a key role 
in the whole of existence. However any attempt at this _point 
to define the 
meaning of meaning would evidently 
presuppose that we already know at least something of what 
meaning 
is, 
even 
if 
perhaps 
only 
non.verbally 
or 
subliminally. That is, when we talk we know what meaning 
is, we could not talk if we didn't. So I won't attempt to begin 
with an explicit definition of meaning, but rather, as it were, 
unfold the meaning of meaning as we go along, taking for 
granted that everyone has se>me intuitive sense of what 
meaning is. 
72 

Soma-significance 
The notion of soma-significance implies that soma (or the 
physical) and its significance (which is mental) are not in any 
sense separately existent, but rather that they are two aspects 
of one over-all reality. By an aspect we mean a view or a way 
of looking. That is to say, it is a form in which the whole of 
reality appears - it displays or unfolds - either in our 
perception or in our thinking. Clearly each aspect reflects 
and implies the other, so that the other shows in it. We 
describe these aspects using different words; neverthelesc; we 
imply that they are revealing the unknown whole of reality, 
as it were, from two different sides. 
You can obtain a good illustration in physics for the 
unbroken 
wholenes 
underlying the 
aspects that 
are, 
nevertheles, distinguished, by contrasting the relationship of 
electrical poles or charges and magnetic poles. Electrical 
charges are regarded as separately existent and connected by 
a field; but magnetic poles are not that way. They are really 
one unbroken magnetic field. That is, if you take a magnet 
with a north and south pole, you may consider that there is a 
field going around the magnet from the north to the south 
pole. You may have sen this illustrated with iron filings. 
Now the point is that if you take this magnet and break it, 
you get two magnets, each of which has a north and a south 
pole. 
73 

Soma-significance 
s 
So you can se that there is actually no separate magnetic 
pole. In fact you may consider that even when it is not 
broken, every part is a superposition of north and south 
polä, and you may then understand the relationship as 
flowmg. 
With the aid of this concept of opposing pairs of magnetic 
poles, we can contribute in a significant way to expresing 
and understanding the basic relationships in the overall 
magnetic field. I propose to look at soma-significance in a 
similar way. That is to say, I regard them as two aspects 
distinguished only in thought, which will help us to expres 
and understand relationships in the 'field' of reality as a 
whole. 
To bring out how soma and significance are related, I 
might note that each particular kind of significance is based 
on some somatic order, 
arrangement, connection and 
organization of distinguishable elements - that is to say, 
structure. For example the printed marks on this piece of 
paper cary a meaning which is apprehended by a reader. In 
a 
television set 
the 
movement 
of 
electrical 
signals 
communicated to an electron beam caries meaning to a 
viewer. 
Modern 
scientific 
studies 
indicate 
that such 
meanings are caried somatically by further physical, 
chemical and electrical prã into the brain and the rest 
of the nervous system where they are apprehended by ever 
higher intellectual and emotional levels of meaning. 
As this takes place these meaninå, along with their 
14 

Soma-significance 
somatic concomitants, become ever more subtle. The word 
'subtle' is derived from the Latin sub-te:r.ere, meaning woven 
from underneath, finely woven. The meaning is: rarified, 
delicate, highly refined, elusive, indefinable, intangible. The 
subtle may be contrasted with the manifest, which means 
literally, what can be held in the hand. My proposal then is 
that reality has two further key aspects, the subtle and the 
manifest, which are closely related to soma and significance. 
As I pointed out, each somatic form, such as a printed page, 
has a significance . This is clearly more subtle than the form 
itself. But in turn such a significance can be held in yet 
another somatic form -
electrical, chemical and other 
activity in the brain and the rest of the nervous system -
that is more subtle than the original form that gave rise to it. 
This distinction of subtle and manifest is only relative , 
since what is manifest on one level may be subtle on another. 
Thus the relatively subtle somatic form of thought may have 
a meaning that can be grasped in still higher and more subtle 
somatic prഔ. And this may lead on further to a grasp of 
a vast totality of meanings in a flash of insight. 
This sort of action may be described as the apprehension of 
the meaning of meanings, which may in principle go on to 
indefinitely deep and subtle levels of significance . For 
example in physics, reflection on the meanings of a wide 
range of experimental facts and theoretical problems and 
paradoxes eventually led Einstein to new insights concerning 
the meaning of space, time and matter, which are at the 
foundation of the theory of relativity . Meanings are thus seen 
to be capable of being organized into ever more subtle and 
comprehensive over-al structures that imply, contain and 
enfold each other in ways that are capable of indefinite 
extension - that is, one meaning enfolds another, and so on. 
So you can se that the meaning of the implicate order must 
be closely related. The implicate order is a way of illustrating 
the way meaning is organized. 
In terms of the notion of soma-significance there is no 
point to the attempt to reduce one level of subtlety in any 
structure completely to another. For example , if you meet a 
certain content on one level and then on another, the 
75 

Soma.significance 
relationship between these levels is the esential content of 
yet another level. So it is clear that no ultimate reduction is 
Ĝble. Al> the level under consideration is changed, the 
particular content of what is somatic (or manifest) and what 
is significant (or subtle) has always therefore to be changing. 
Nonetheles it is clear that it is necesary for both roles to be 
pre<>ent in each ooncrete instance of experience. You see, it is 
like the magnetic poles. Wherever you cut the magnet you 
have a North and a South pole, and wherever you make a cut 
in experience and abstract something, and say, 'This is the 
experience,' (which is a bigger context) you have soma­
significance. It would be impcmible to have all the content 
on the side of soma or on that of significance. 
I have emphasized so far, the significance of soma - that 
is, that each somatic configuration has a meaning - and 
that it is such meaning that is grasped at more subtle levels of 
soma. I call this the soma-signifcant relation which is one 
side of the over-al proces. I would now call attention to the 
inverse, signa-somatic relation. This is the other side of the 
same proces in which every meaning at a given level is sen 
actively to affect the soma at a more manifest level. Consider 
for example, a shadow seen in a dark night. Now if it 
happens, because of the person's past experience, that this 
means an ĝailant, the adrenalin will flow, the heart will 
beat faster, the blood presure will rise and he will be ready 
to fight, to run or to freeze. However if it means only a 
shadow, the response of the soma is very different. So quite 
generally the total physical response of the human being is 
profoundly affected by what physical forms mean to him. A 
change of meaning can totally change your response. This 
meaning will vary according to all sorts of things, such as 
your ability or background, conditioning, and so on. 
This is different 
from 
psychosomatic, 
because with 
psychosomatic you say that mind affects matter as if they 
were two different substances -
mind substance affects 
material substance. Now I am saying there is only one flow, 
and a change of meaning is a change in that flow. Therefore 
any change of meaning is a change of soma, and any change 
of soma is a change of meaning. So we don't have this 
76 

Soma-significance 
distinction. 
& a given meaning is carried into the somatic side, you 
can se that it continues to develop the original significance. 
If something means danger, then not only adrenalin, but a 
whole range of chemical substances wil travel through the 
blood, and according to modern scientific discoveries, these 
act like 'mesengers' (carriers of meaning) from the brain to 
various parts of the body. That is, these chemicals imtruct 
various parts of the body to act in certain ways. In addition 
there are electrical 'signals' - they are not really signals -
carried by the nerves, which function in a similar way. And 
this is a further unfoldment of the original significance into 
forms that are suitable for 'imtructing' the body to carry out 
the implications of what is meant. 
From each level of somatic unfoldment of meaning there is 
then a further movement leading to activity on a yet more 
manifestly somatic level, until the action finally emerges as a 
physical movement of the body that affects the environment. 
So one can say that there is a two-way movement of energy 
in which each level of significance acts on the next more 
manifestly somatic level, and so on, while perception carries 
the meaning of the action back in the other direction.

As in cutting a magnet it does not mean that these lines 
represent distinct levels; they are merely abstracted in our 
mind. 
77 

Soma-significance 
I want to emphasize here that nothing exists in this proces 
except as a two-way movement, a flow of energy, in which 
meaning is carried inward and outward between the aspects 
of soma and significance as well as between levels that are 
relatively subtle and those that are relatively manifest. It is 
this over-all structure of meaning (a part of which I've 
drawn in this diagram) that is grasped in every experience. 
We can se this by following the proces in the two opposing 
directions. For example, as light strikes the retina of the eye, 
carrying meaning in the form of an image, the meaning is 
transformed into a chemical form by the rods and the cones. 
They 
in 
turn 
are 
transformed 
into 
electro-chemical 
movements in the nerves, and so on into the brain at higher 
and higher levels. Then in the other direction, higher 
meanings are carried electrically and chemicaly into the 
structures of reflexes and thus onward toward ever more 
manifestly somatic levels. 
I have been discŒing what you might call the normal 
soma-significant 
and 
signa-somatic 
pr±. 
Usualy 
psychosomatic pr±es are discuK in terms of some 
disorder, and you can see here that you can also get signa­
somatic disorder. For example, normally the heart will beat 
faster when something means danger. One realizes that that 
is the signa-somatic resporue to the meaning of danger. But it 
could also mean that something is wrong with the heart, in 
which case the danger will be indicated by the rate of the 
beating of the heart. In that case everytime the heart beats 
faster it fills the person with more of the meaning of danger 
and cause<i the heart to beat faster still. So you get a runaway 
loop, and that could be an important component of neurotic 
disorders - the normal proces gets caught in a loop that 
goes too far. 
You can se that ultimately the soma-significant and signa­
somatic proces extends even into the environment. Meaning 
thus can be conveyed from one person to another and back 
through sound waves, through gestures carried by light, 
through books and newspapers, through telephone, radio, 
television and so on, linking up the whole society in one vast 
web of soma-significant and signa-somatic activity. You can 
78 

Soma-significance 
say society is this thing; this activity is what makes society. 
Without 
it 
there 
would 
be 
no 
society. 
Therefore 
communication is this activity. 
Similarly even simple physical action may be said to 
'communicate motion and form' to inanimate objects. Most 
of the material environment in which we live 
- houses, 
cities, factories, farms, highways, and so on - can be 
describe.cl as the somatic result of the meaning that material 
objects have had for human beings over the ages. Going on 
from there, even relationships with nature and with the 
cosmos flow out of what they mean to us. These meanings 
fundamentally afect our actions toward nature, and thus 
indirectly, the action of nature back on us is affected. Indeed 
as far as we know it and are aware of it and can act on it , the 
whole of nature, including our civilization which has 
evolve.cl from nature and is still a part of nature, is one 
movement that is both soma-significant and signa-somatic. 
Some of the simpler kinds of soma-significant and signa­
somatic activity are just reflexes that are built into the 
nervous system, or instincts that expres the accumulated 
experience of the species. But these go on to ever finer and 
more variable responses. Even the behaviour of creatures as 
simple a.s bees can be sen to be so organized in a very subtle 
way by a kind of meaning, in this case through a dance 
indicating the direction and distance of sources of nectar . 
Though they might not be conscious of it, there is a meaning 
going on. With the higher animals this operation of meaning 
is more evident, and in man it is possible to develop conscious 
awarenes , and meaning is then most central and vital. 
In these higher leveJ.. this soma-significant and signa­
somatic activity shows up most directly. In fact the word 
'meaning' indicates not only the significance of something to 
us, but aha our intention toward it. Thw 'I mean to do 
something' means 'I intend to do it' .  This double meaning of 
the word 'meaning' is not just an accident of our language, 
but rather it implicitly contains an important insight into the 
structure of meaning. 
To bring this out I would first note that an intention 
generally arises out of a previous perception of the meaning 
79 

Soma-significance 
or significance of a certain total situation. This gives all of 
the relevant pÍibilities and implies reasons for choosing 
which of these is better. Ultimately this choice is determine.cl 
by the totality of significance at that moment. The source of 
this activity includes not only perception and abstract or 
explicit knowledge, but what Polanyi cals tacit knowledge 
- that is, knowledge containing concrete skills and reactions 
that are not specifiable in language, such as riding a bicycle. 
Ultimately it is the whole significance that gives rise to 
intention, which we sense as a feeling of being ready to act in 
a certain way. For example, if we se a situation meaning 
'the door is open,' we can form the intention to walk through 
it, but if it means 'the door is close.cl,' we don't. But even the 
intention not to act is still an 
intention. 
The whole 
significance helps to determine it. The important point is 
that the intention is a kind of implicate order; the intention 
unfolds from the whole meaning. It doesn't just come out of 
nothing. Therefore a person cannot form intentions except 
on the basis of what the situation means to him, and if he 
mises the mark on what it means, he wil form the wrong 
intentions. 
Of course, most of the meaning is implicit. Indeed, 
whatever we say or do, we cannot possibly de.scribe in detail 
more than a very small part of the total significance that we 
sense 
in 
any 
given 
moment. 
Moreover, 
when such 
significance give.s rise to an intention, it too will be almost 
entirely implicit, at least at the beginning. For example, as I 
said, I have an intention to speak at this moment, and it is 
implicit what I am going to say; I don't know what I'm going 
to say exactly, but it comes out. Now the words are not 
chosen one by one, but rather are unfolde.d in some way. 
Meaning and intention are therefore inseparably related as 
two sides or aspects of one activity. This is the same as we 
disc with soma and significance, and the subtle and the 
manifest. We are saying that there is one whole of activity 
abstracted at a certain point conceptually - we make a cut 
in it - and we say it always has two sides. One of the two 
sides is meaning, and the other would be intention. But they 
don't exist separately. 
BO 

Soma--signijicance 
Intentions are commonly thought to be conscious and 
deliberate. But you really have very little ability to choose 
your intentions. Deeper intentions generally arise out of the 
total significance in ways of which one is not aware, and 
over which one has little or no control. So you usually 
discover your intentions by observing your actions. These in 
fact 
often 
contain 
what 
are 
felt 
to 
be 
unintended 
consequences leading one to say, 'I didn't mean to do that.' 'I 
mised the mark'. In action, what is actually implicit in what 
one mearu is thus more fully revealed. That is the 
importance of giving attention. 
To learn the full meaning of our intentioru in this way can 
very often be costly and destructive. What we can do instead 
is 
to display 
the 
intention 
along 
with 
its 
expected 
consequences through imagination, and in other ways. The 
word 'display' means 'unfold', but for the sake of revealing 
something other than the display itself. A!> such a display is 
perceived one can then find out whether or not one still 
intends going on with the original intention. If not, the 
intention is modified, and the modification is in turn 
displayed in a similar way. Thus to a certain e.xtent, by 
mearu of trying it out in the imagination, you can avoid 
having to carry it out in reality and having to suffer the 
consequences, although that is rather limited. 
So intention constantly changes in the act of perception of 
the fuller meaning. Even perception is included within this 
over-all activity. What one perceives is not the thing in itself, 
which is unknown or unknowable, but however deep or 
shallow one's perceptions, all one perceives is what it means 
at that moment, and then intention and action develop in 
accordance with this meaning. 
The point is that as you act according to your intention, 
and as the perception comes in, there can arise an indefinite 
exteruion of inward signa-somatic and soma-significant 
activity. That is, you go to more and more subtle levels and 
the thing is, as it were, looking at itself at different levels ever 
more deeply. 
Such activity is roughly what is meant by the mental side 
of experience. When something is going on that is not 
Bl 

Soma-significance 
mongly coupled with the outer physical manifestation of 
some soma-significant and signa-somatic activity in which it 
is looking at itself, then we call that the mental side of 
experience. Now this is only a side. Once again I want to 
repeat that there is no separation between the mental and the 
physical. When it gets to the other side where it is primarily 
concerned with actions it just gets more physical. 
Now we can look at this in terms of the implicate or 
enfolded order, for al the'§e levels of meaning enfold each 
other and may have a significant bearing on each other. 
Within this context, meaning is a constantly extending and 
actualizing mucture - it is never complete and fixed. At the 
limits of what has at any moment ben comprehended there 
are always unclarities, unsatisfactory features, failures of 
intention to fit what is actually displayed or what is actually 
done. And the yet deeper intention is to be aware of the'§e 
discrepancies and to alow the whole mucture to change if 
núary. This will lead to a movement in which there is the 
constant unfoldment of stil more comprehensive meanings. 
But of course each new meaning has some limited domain 
in which the actions flowing out of it may be expected to fit 
what actually happens. The'§e limits may in principle be 
extended indefinitely through further perceptions of new 
mean.in. But no matter how far this proces goes there will 
stil be limits of some kind, which will be indicated by the 
discovery of yet further discrepancies and disharmonies 
between our intentions, as based on these meanin. and the 
actual consequences that flow out of the'§e intentions. At any 
stage the perception of new meanings may disolve these 
discrepancies, but there will still continue to be a limit, so 
that the resulting knowledge is stil incomplete. 
What this implies is that meaning is capable of an 
indefinite extension to ever greater levels of subtlety as well 
as of comprehensivenes - in which there is a movement 
from the explicate toward the implicate. This can only take 
place however when new meanings are being perceived 
freshly from moment to moment. But if significance comes 
solely from memory and not from fresh perceptions it will be 
limited to some finite depth of subtlety and inwardnes. 
82 

Soma-significance 
Memory, being some kind of recording, neca<>arily has a 
certain stable quality which cannot transform its structure in 
any fundamental way, and has only a limited capacity to 
adapt to new situations - for example, by forming new 
combinations of known principles, either through chance or 
through rules already established in memory. Memory is thus 
neca<>arily bounded both in scope and in the subtlety of its 
content. Any structure arising solely out of memory will be 
finite, and will be able to deal with some finite limited 
domain; but of course, to go beyond this, a fresh perception 
of new meanings is needed . And in fact, when you have a 
fresh perception you may also se new meanings of your 
memories. In other words memory may cease to be so limited 
when there is fresh perception. To go on in this way to new 
meanings that 
are 
not 
arbitrarily limited 
requires a 
potentially infinite degre.e of inwardnes and subtlety in our 
mental proceses. And I am suggesting that these proca-;es 
have acces to an, in principle, unlimited depth in the 
implicate order . 
Thus far I have suggested reasons why meaning is capable 
of infinite extension to ever greater levels of subtlety and 
refinement. However, it might sem at first sight that in the 
other dire.ction - of the manifest and the somatic - there is 
a clear pcmibility of a limit in the sense that one might arrive 
at a 'bottom level' of reality. This could be, for example, 
some set of elementary particles out of which everything 
would be constituted such as quarks, or perhaps yet smaller 
particles. Or in accordance with currently accepted views of 
modern physics it might be a fundamental field, or set of 
fields, that was the 'bottom level'. What is of crucial 
importance is that its meaning would be in principle 
unambiguous. In contrast, al higher order forms in this 
supposedly basic structure of matter are ambiguons - that 
is, their meaning is incomplete. 
There is an inherent 
ambiguity in any concrete meaning. That is to say, how the 
meanings arise and what they signify depends to a large 
extent on what a given situation means to us, and this may 
vary according to our interests and motivations, 
our 
background of knowledge, and so on. But if for example, 
83 

Soma-significance 
there were a 'bottom level' of reality. these meanings would 
be exactly what they were, and anybody who looked 
correctly could find them . They would be a reality that was 
just simply there. independent of what it meant to us. 
Of course you also have to keep in mind that all scientific 
knowledge is limited and provisional so that we cannot be 
certain that what we think is the 'bottom level' is actually so. 
For example, possibly something other than the present 
theories will come to reveal a 'bottom level'. But this 
uncertainty of knowledge cannot of itself prevent us from 
believing in the existence of some kind of 'bottom level' if we 
wish to do so. It is not commonly realized however that the 
quantum theory implies that no such 'bottom level' of 
unambiguous reality is possible. 
Now this is a bit difficult to make clear in this short time, 
but Niels Bohr, one of the founders of modern physics, has 
made one of the most consistent interpretations of the 
quantum theory given thus far. and which has been accepted 
by most physicists (though few probably have studied it 
deeply 
enough 
to 
appreciate 
fully 
the 
revolutionary 
implications of what he has done). To understand this point, 
first we have to say that while the quantum theory 
contradicts the previous! y existent clasical theory. it does not 
explain this theory's basic concepts as an approximation or a 
simplification of itself, but it has to presuppose the clasical 
concepts at the same time that it has to contradict them. The 
paradox is resolved in Bohr's point of view by saying that the 
quantum theory introduces no new basic concepts at all. 
Rather what it does is to require that concepts such as 
position 
and 
momentum, 
which 
are 
in 
principle 
unarn biguous in clasical physics. must become ambiguous in 
quantum mechanics. But ambiguity is just a lack of well­
defined meaning. So Bohr, at least tacitly, brings in the 
notion of meaning as crucial to the understanding of the 
content of the theory. 
Now this is a radically new step, and he is doing this not 
just for its own sake. but he is forced to do something like this 
by the very form of the mathematics which so succesfully 
predict the quantum properties of matter. This mathematics 
84 

Soma-significance 
gives only statistical predictioru. It not only fails to predict 
what will happen in a single measurement, it cannot even 
provide an unambiguous concept or picture of what sort of 
pr is supposed to take place. So for Bohr the concepts are 
ambiguous, and the meaning of the concepts depends on the 
whole context of the experimental 
arrangement. 
The 
meaning of the result depends on the large scale behaviour 
which was supposed to be explained by the particles 
themselves. So in some sense you do not have a 'bottom level' 
but rather you find that, to a certain extent, the meaning of 
these particles has the same sort of ambiguity that we find in 
mental phenomena when we are looking at meaning. 
This kind of situation is what is pervasively characteristic 
of mind and meaning. Indeed the whole field of meaning can 
be described as subject to a distinction between content and 
context 
which 
is similar to that 
between 
soma 
and 
significance, and between subtle and manifest. Content and 
context are two aspects that are inevitably present in any 
attempt to discuss the meaning of a given situation. 
According to the dictionary, the content is the ntial 
meaning - for example, the content of a book. But any 
specifiable content is abstracted from a wider context which 
is so closely connected with the content that the meaning of 
the former is not properly defined without the latter. 
However, the wider context may in turn be treated as a 
content in a yet broader context, and so on. The significance 
of any particular level of content is therefore critically 
dependent on its appropriate context, which may include 
indefinitely higher and more subtle levels of meaning - such 
as whether a given form sen in the night means a shadow or 
an as.sailant depends on what one has heard about prowlers, 
what one has had to eat and drink, and so on. So you se, this 
sort of context-dependence is just what is found in physics 
with regard to matter, as well as in consideratforu of mind or 
meaning. 
Now I believe Bohr's interpretation of quantum theory is 
consistent, and he has produred a very deep insight at this 
point; but it is stil not clear why matter should have this 
context-dependence. He just says that the quantum theory 
85 

Soma-significance 
gives rise to it. 
However, in terms of the implicate order, an alternative 
interpretation is pos.sible in which one can ascribe to 
phenomena a deeper reality unfolding, which gives rise to 
them. This reality is not mechanical, rather its basic action 
and structure are understood through enfoldment and 
unfoldment. What is important here is that the law of the 
total implicate order determines certain sub-wholes which 
may be abstracted from it as having relative independence. 
The crucial point is that the activity of these sub-wholes is 
context-dependent, so that the larger content can organize 
the smaller context into one greater whole. The sub-wholes 
will then cease to be properly abstractable as independent 
and autonomous. The implicate order makes it possible to 
discus the notion of reality in a way that does not require us 
to bring in the measuring apparatus, which Bohr does. He 
makes the context very much dependent on the apparatus; 
but he does so 
by 
making nature generally context­
dependent. That is to say, the situation of any part of nature 
is context-dependent in a way that is similar to the way that 
meaning is dependent on its context - that is, as far as the 
laws of physics are concerned. 
That would suggest that in a natural way one might 
extend some notion similar to meaning to the whole universe. 
It is implied that each feature of the universe is not only 
context-dependent fundamentally, but also that the grosser, 
manifest features depend on the subtler aspects in a way that 
is very analagous to soma-significant and signa-somatic 
activity. So something similar to meaning is to be found even 
in the somatic or physical side. 
Now as I said, this holds for us both mentally and 
physically. It would suggest that everything, including 
ourselves, is a generalized kind of meaning. Now I am not 
thereby attributing consciousnes to nature. You se, the 
meaning of the word 'consciousnes' is not terribly clear. In 
fact, without meaning I think that there would be no 
consciousnes. The most esential feature of consciownes.s is 
consciousnes of meaning. Consciousnes is its content; its 
content is the meaning. Therefore it might be better to focus 
86 

Soma-significance 
on meaning rather than consciousnes. So I 
am 
not 
attributing coruciousnes as we know it to nature , but you 
might say that everything has a kind of mental side, rather 
like the magnetic pole.. In inanimate matter the mental side 
is very small, but as we go deeper into things the mental side 
becomes more and more significant . 
Al of this implies that one can coruistently understand the 
whole of nature in terms of a generalized kind of soma­
significant and signa-somatic activity that is es.sentially 
independent of man, and that indeed it is more coruistent to 
do this than to suppose that there is an unambignous 'bottom 
level' at which the.e considerations have no place. I would 
say that the crucial difference between this and a machine is 
that nature is infinite in its potential depths of subtlety and 
inwardnes, while a machine is not. Although to a certain 
extent a machine such as a computer has something similar. 
So it is in principle possible in this view to encompas both 
the outward universe of matter and the inward universe of 
mind. 
In this approach, the three basic aspects arise: 
Soma 
Significance 
Energy 
Q: Could you just repeat the meaning of soma-significant 
and signa-somatic again? 
Bohm: Yes. Now soma-significance means that the soma is 
significant to the higher or more subtle level. Signa-somatic 
mearu that that significance acts somaticaly toward a more 
manifest level . 
Now I'm going to look at physical action in a similar way 
- to say that in the unfoldment of matter there is a kind of 
soma-significance; that the soma may be significant to a 
deeper level. So let's say that something unfolds and has a 
significance, and as a result something else unfolds. 
In explaining this I should first discus.s the work of the 
well-known psychologist Piaget, who has carefully ohserved 
87 

Soma-significance 
and studied the growth of intelligent perception in infants 
and in young children. This led him to say that this 
perception flows- out of what is in effect a deep initial 
intention to act toward the object. You can se the soma­
significance coming in here. This action may initially be 
based partly on a kind of significance that objects have, 
which is grounded in the whole accumulated instinctive 
response to the experience of the species, and partly on a kind 
of significance that is grounded in his own past experience. 
Whatever its origin may be, Piaget says, what this action 
does is to incorporate or assimilate its object into a cycle of 
inward and outward activity. He moves out, he sees it, he 
acts on it and that changes his perception, and he acts again. 
His intention is implicitly in at least some conformity with 
what he expects the object to be, but it might be vague. The 
action comes back to the extent to which the object fits or 
doesn't fit his intention. Then this brings about a modified 
intention with correspondingly modified outward action. 
This proĞ is continued until a satisfactory fit is obtained 
between intentions and their consequences, after which it 
may remain very stable until further discrepancies appear. 
Piaget points out however that the initial intention need 
not be directed primarily toward incorporating the object 
into a cycle of activity in order to produce a desired result 
such as enjoyment or satisfaction. Instead it might be 
directed mainly at perception of the object. For example, the 
child may initiate movements aimed at exploring and 
observing the object, such as turning it around, bringing it 
closer to look at it, and so on. From such an intention it is 
poğible for him to begin with all sorts of provisional feelings 
as to what the object might be, and to allow these to unfold 
into actions which come back as perceptions of fitting or 
non-fitting. This leads to a corresponding modification of the 
detailed content of the intention behind these movements 
until the outgoing actions and incoming perceptions are in 
accord. This is a very important development of intentional 
activity which makes possible an unending movement of 
learning and discovering what has not ben known before. 
So we want to say that this soma-significant and signa-
88 

Soma-significance 
somatic activity, constantly going back and forth, is what is 
involved in learning. And we can say that this is going on, 
not only in regard to outward objects, but inwardly - that 
is, for example, with regard to thought. And there may be 
another level which picks up the meaning of the thought and 
takes an action toward that thought while thinking another 
thought to see if it is consistent. If it is not, then the intention 
changes until we get a consistent relatio]hip between the 
thought which arises from the deeper intention and the 
thought that was first being looked at. You see, you may 
have a thought that you want to look at, and there may be a 
deeper intelligence which is able to grasp the meaning of that 
thought in a broader context and take an action toward it by, 
C it were, thinking again and seeing whether the thought 
which comes out is coherent with the thought with which 
you started. And if it's not, then you can start to change that 
action until it is. Or you can change the thought. Change can 
ocur at various levels. 
So all of these Levels of meaning enfold each other and 
have a certain bearing on each other. This whole prä is 
always soma-significant and signa-somatic going to ever 
deeper levels. When I talk of these proceses I don't only 
mean going outward into the manifest world, but also the 
deeper mental proces.ses being explored by still more subtle 
mental prã. So you could say that the mind hC 
available in principle an unlimited depth of subtlety, and 
Learning can take place at all these levels. 
Now what is important is not only what to think but how 
to think. But if we ask how we think, it may be just C 
difficult to answer as how do you ride a bicycle? It is at the 
tacit level of knowing, or at the subtle Level, that how to 
think takes place. You cannot say how to think but you can 
learn, C I have just been de.scribing, through signa-somatic 
and soma-significant activity. 
To sum up what I've just been saying, a somewhat similar 
view can be applied within matter in general . So one may 
think of the whole thing as one prö - as an ex.tended idea 
of meaning and an extended idea of soma. That is, meaning 
and matter may not have the same sort of consciousnes.s that 
89 

Soma-significance 
we have, but there is still a mental pole at every level of 
matter, and there is some kind of soma-significance. And 
eventually. if you go to infinite depths of matter. we may 
reach something very close to what you reach in the depths of 
mind. So if you consider it, we no longer have this division 
between mind and matter. 
Now we have in this whole proces these three aspects: 
soma and significance and an energy which carries the 
significance of soma to a subtler level and gives rise to a 
backward movement in which the significance acts on the 
soma. Modern physics has already shown that matter and 
energy are two aspects of one reality. Energy acts within 
matter, 
and even further, energy and matter can be 
converted into each other, as we all know. 
From the point of view of the implicate order, energy and 
matter are imbued with a certain kind of significance which 
gives form to their over-all activity and to the matter which 
arises in that activity. The energy of mind and of the 
material substance of the brain are also imbued with a kind 
of significance which gives form to their over-all activity. So 
quite generally, energy enfolds matter and meaning, while 
matter enfolds energy and meaning. 
You can se here how the middle term enfolds the other 
two: 
MATIER

But also meaning enfolds both matter and energy. The 
way we find out about matter and energy is by seing what it 
means.

So each of these basic notions enfolds the other two. It is 
through this mutual enfoldment that the whole notion 
obtains unity. So we can put all these relationships together: 
MEANIഎG 
ENERGY 
However in some sense the enfoldment by meaning seems 
to be more fundamental than the enfoldment of the other 
types, because we can discuss the meanings of meaning. In 
some sense meanings enfold meanin. But we cannot have 
the matter of matter, or the energy of energy. There sems to 
be no intrinsic enfoldment relation in matter-energy. Matter 
enfolds energy, and energy enfolds matter, according to this 
view, by way of significance . But meaning refers to itself 
directly, and this is in fact the basis of the possibility of that 
intelligence which can comprehend the whole, including 
itself. On the other hand, matter and energy obtain their 
self-reference only indirectly, firstly through meaning. That 
is, we can refer matter back to itself by first seing what it 
mean.s to us, and then going back. Or we can refer matter to 
energy, or energy to matter, by seing what they mean. We 
refer them to each other reflexively, but only through their 
91 

Soma-si.gnijicance 
meaning. 
Generally we have this problem of thought referring to 
something else, thus creating division and dualism. Even the 
thought that the universe is one unbroken whole in flowing 
movement refers to a universe which is one whole unbroken 
movement, and beside that there is the thought. So we 
therefore have two nevertheles. What we would like is a 
view in which the thought itself is part of the reality. 
Usually we think of thought in correspondence with some 
object; the features of the thought correspond to some object. 
But as son as you say a thought corresponds to an object, 
you immediately have, tacitly, a division between the object 
and the thought. In reali.ty, we are saying that the thought is 
a part of the soma-significance and cannot be absolutely 
distinct from the object. Only in certain limite.d areas is the 
distinction useful or correct - that is, where the thought has 
a negligible effect on the object. This is the area of all 
practical activity, technology, and so on. 
The modern mechanistic approach says that this area 
covers everything; but what I am saying is that it is a small 
area within a much vaster field. So we are not denying that 
kind of thought; we are saying it is only valid in a limite.d 
area. 
The problem of conceiving of a univer.ie that can refer 
consistently to itself has long been a difficult one that has not 
ben resolved in a really adequate way. But the field of 
meaning can refer to itself, and of course, it also presupposes 
the context of the universe to which it also refers. Meaning, 
though, has nevertheles ben regarde.d as peculiar to our 
own minds and not as a proper part or aspect of the objective 
univer.ie. However if there is a generalized kind of meaning 
intrinsic to the univer.ie, including our own bodies and 
minds, then the way may be opene.d to understanding the 
whole as self-referential through its 'meaning for itself - in 
other words, by whatever reality is. And the universe as we 
now conceive it may not be the whole thing. 
The Ēect of soma cannot be divide.d from the ēt of 
significance. Whatever meanings there may be 'in our 
minds', these are, as we have sen, inseparable from the 
92 

Soma-significance 
totality of our somatic structures and therefore from what we 
are. So what we are depends crucially on the total set of 
meanings that operates 'within us'. Any fundamental change 
in meaning is a change in being for us. Therefore any 
transformation of consciousnes must be a transformation of 
meaning. Consciousnes is its content - that is its meaning. 
In a way, we could say that we are the totality of our 
meanings. 
If we trace some of these meanings to their origins, we find 
that most of them have come from society as a whole. Each 
person takes up his own particular combination of the 
general mixture that is available in a society. And so at least 
in this way, every person is different. Yet the underlying 
basis is characterized mainly by the fundamental similarity 
over the whole of mankind, while the differences are 
relatively secondary. And insofar as man has the capacity to 
get beyond that, that also is common. 
These meanings change as human beings live, work, 
communicate and interact. These changes are based for the 
most part on adaptation of existent meanings. But it has also 
ben pÓible from time to time for new meanings to be 
perceived and realized -
in other words, 
made real. 
Perceptions of this kind have generally ocurred when 
someone became aware that certain sets of older meanings 
no longer made any sense. This may be understood as a vast 
extension of what happens in the development of intelligence 
in young children. That is, as they se something about 
which they are puzled, they have to se its meaning in a 
new way. 
Now we can say that we are puzzled about the whole of 
life, and we have to se it with a new meaning. If you look at 
life as a whole it doesn't sem to make that much sense - the 
way we live, and so on. The childlike attitude would ask, 
'Well, what does it mean?' And some as yet incompletely 
formed notion of 
a 
new 
meaning that 
removes the 
contradictions in the older meanings may begin to penetrate 
a person's intentions. A5 I explained , the actions unfolding 
from the intentions would be displayed, for example, in the 
imagination, 
and 
the 
disCTepancies 
between 
what 
is 
93 

Soma-significance 
displayed and what is intended would lead to a change of 
intention aimed at decreasing this discrepancy, and so on. In 
this way a greater clarification of the meaning would ocur 
along with a possibility of realizing it through a change in 
intention, because it is only when one's purpose or intention 
changes that a new meaning can be realized. Then, often in 
a flash that sems to take no time at all, a coherent new 
whole of meaning is formed, within which the older 
meanings may be comprehended as having a limited validity 
within their proper context. 
Now if meaning is an intrinsic part of not only our reality 
but reality in general, then I would say that a perception of a 
new meaning constitutes a creative act. As their implications 
are unfolded, when people take them up, work with them, 
and so on, the new meanings that have been created make 
their corresponding contributions to this reality. And these 
are not only in the aspect of significance but also in the aspect 
of soma. That is, the situation changes physically as well as 
mentally. 
Therefore each perception of a new meaning by human 
beings actually changes the over-all reality in which we live 
and have our existence - sometimes in a far-reaching way. 
This implies that this reality is never complete. In the older 
view, however, meaning and reality were sharply separated. 
Reality was not supposed to 
be changed directly by 
perception of a new meaning. Rather it was thought that to 
do this was merely to obtain a better 'view' of reality that 
was independent of what it meant to us, and then to do 
something about it. But once you actually se the new 
meaning and take hold of your intention, reality has 
changed. No further act is needed. 
Seeing something intellectually or abstractly, though, will 
not change your intention. You may say that you need an act 
of will to change it, but I think that when you really se 
something deeply with great energy, no further act of wil is 
needed. If you really se a new meaning to be true, then your 
intention will change - unlä there is something blocking 
it, such as your conditioning, or the 'program'. And if 
something is blocking it, then the will is not going to help, 
94 

Soma-significance 
because you don't know what the block is. Therefore you 
have to see the meaning of the block. So choice and will are 
of limited significance - valid in certain areas. But I think 
something deeper is needed if you are discusing the 
transformation of mind or consciousnes or matter - they 
really all change together. 
You see, the deep change of meaning is a change in the 
deep material structure of the brain as well, and this unfolds 
into further change.. Every time you think, the blood 
distribution all over the brain change.; every emotion 
change. it. Between thinking and the somatic activity there is 
also a tremendous connection with the heartbeat and the 
chemical constitution of the blood , and so on. The new 
meaning will produce different thought 
and therefore 
ìibly an entirely different functioning of the brain. 
We already know that certain meanings can greatly 
disturb the brain, but other meanings may organize it in new 
ways. And when the brain comes to a new state, new ideas 
become possible. But the new meaning is what organizes the 
new state. If the brain holds the old meanings, then it cannot 
change its state. The mental and the physical are one. A 
change in the mental is a change in the physical, and a 
change in the physical is a change in the mental. (In fact, 
there has ben some discussion of what is caled subtle brain 
damage in animals in which no physical abnormality can be 
found; but some disturbance of function take. place when 
the animals are put under stres. So you see, we could say 
that living as we do, we probably have a great deal of subtle 
brain damage. In other words, the brain is damaged at a 
subtle level that might not show up at the cellular level but 
deep in the implicate order. Eventually of course, it shows 
up in the cellular level too.) So instead of saying that when 
we se a new meaning we make a choice and then act, we 
say that the perception and realization of the new meaning 
in our intention is already the change. 
This point is crucie.lly significant for understanding 
psychological and social change. For if meaning is something 
separate from human reality, then any change must be 
produced by an act of will or choice, guided perhaps by our 
95 

Soma-significance 
new perception of meaning. But if meaning itself is a key 
part of reality, then, once society, the individual and their 
relationships are sen to mean something different from 
what they did before, a fundamental change has already 
taken place. So social change requires a different, socially 
accepted meaning, such as in the change from feudalism to 
the forms that followed it, or from autocracy to democracy, 
or to communism, and so on. According to the meanings 
accepted, the entire society went. 
These meanings may have been correct or incorrect. But 
once the meanings become fixed, the whole thing must 
gradually go wrong. Or to put it differently, what man does 
is an inevitable signa-somatic consequence of what the whole 
of his experience, inward and outward, means to him. For 
example, once the world came to mean a set of disjointed 
mechanical fragments one of which was himself, people 
could not do other than begin to act accordingly and engage 
in the kind of ceasel] conflict that this meaning implies. 
The meaning of fragmentation includes conflict and self­
centrednes -
in other words, not creative tension but 
meaningles conflict. 
However if mankind could sustain a perception and 
realize this perception signifying that the world is an 
unbroken whole with a multiplicity of meanings, some of 
which are fitting and harmonious and some of which are 
not, a very different state of affairs could unfold. For then 
there could be an unending creative perception of new 
meanings that encomp the older ones in broader and more 
harmonious wholes which would unfold in a corresponding 
transformation 
of 
the over-all 
reality that 
was thus 
encomped. 
Here it is worth noting that our civilization has ben 
suffering from what may be called a failure of meaning. 
Indeed from earliest times people have felt this as a kind of 
'meaningl]n]· of life. Whether this is more prevalent 
today, I don't know, but people say it is. But in this sense, 
meaning also signifies value. That is to say, a meaningles life 
has no value; it is not worth living. But of course it is 
imbible for anything to be totally free of meaning. For as 
96 

Soma-significance 
we have explained earlier, the notion of generalized soma­
significance regarded as valid for the whole of life, implies 
that each thing is its total meaning - which of course must 
include all of its relevant context. What I intend by 
'meaning!ï' therefore is that there is a meaning, but that it 
is inadequate, because it is mechanical and constraining and 
hence of little value and not creative. A change in this is 
possible only if new meaning is perceived that is not 
mechanical. Such a new meaning, sensed to have a high 
value, wil arouse the energy needed to bring a whole new 
way of life into being. You se, only meaning can arouse 
energy. 
At yresent people don't seem to have the energy to face this 
sea o troubles that threatens to overwhelm us, generally 
speaking. If we take a mechanical meaning, it tends to 
deaden the energy so that people remain indefinitely as they 
have ben, or at best allows change in limited directions such 
as the continuation of the development of technology, and so 
on. So I am saying that meaning is fundamental to what life 
actually is. 
Now you can extend this to the cosmos as a whole. We can 
say that human meanings make a contribution to the cosmos, 
but we can also say that the cosmos may be ordered 
according to a kind of 'objective' meaning. New meanings 
may emerge in this over-all order. That is, we may say that 
meaning penetrates the cosmos, or even what is beyond the 
cosmos. For example, there are current theories in physics 
and cosmology that imply that the universe emerged from 
the 'big bang'. In the earliest phase there were no electrons, 
protons, neutrons, or other basic structures. None of the laws 
that we know would have had any meaning. Even space and 
time in their present, well-defined forms would have had no 
meaning. All of this emerged from a very different state of 
affairs. The proposal is that, as happens with human beings, 
this 
emergence 
included 
a 
creative 
unfoldment 
of 
generalized meaning. Later, with the evolution of new forms 
of life, fundamentally new steps may have evolved in the 
creative unfoldment of further meanings. That is, we may 
say that some evolutionary proceses ocur which could be 
97 

Soma-significance 
traced physically, but we cannot really understand them 
without looking 
at some deeper 
meaning which was 
responsible for the changes. The present view of the changes 
is that they were random, with selection of those traits that 
were suited for survival, but that does not explain the 
complex, subtle structures that actually ocurred. 
The question is how our own meanings are related to those 
of the universe as a whole. We could say that our action 
toward the whole universe is a result of what it means to us. 
Now since we are saying that everything acts according to a 
similar principle, we can say that the rest of the universe acts 
signa-somatically to us according to what we mean to it. 
These meanings do not al fit harmoniously, but if we are 
perceptive of the disharmony, we may continually be 
bringing about an increase in harmony. That is to say, there 
is no final meaning or no final harmony, but a continual 
movement of creativity - or of destruction. In the long run, 
only those meanings which allow changes that tend to bring 
about accord between us and the rest of the universe will be 
possible. We can say that that is true for the universe as a 
whole, and that nature is experimenting with all sorts of 
meanings. Some of them will not be consistent, and they will 
not survive. So anything that has survived for quite a long 
time is bound to have a tremendous degree of coherence with 
the rest of the universe. 
We are proposing that this holds for both living beings and 
for matter in general. We may say then that the harmony is 
never complete and cannot be so. Even now a further 
creation of meaning is going on in a proces.s that includes 
mankind as part of itself. Not merely manús physical 
development but a constant creation of new meanings that is 
esential for the unfoldment of society and human nature 
itself. Even time and space are part of the total meaning and 
are subject to a continual evolution. & I indicated, at the 
beginning of the 'big bang', time and space did not mean 
what they now mean. In this evolution, extended meaning as 
'intention' is the ultimate source of cause and effect, and 
more generally, of neces.sity -
that which cannot be 
otherwise. 
98 

Sotna-signijicance 
Rather than to ask what is the meaning of this universe, 
we would have to say that the universe is its meaning . As this 
changes, the universe changes along with al that is in it. 
What I mean by 'the universe' is 'the whole of reality' and 
what is beyond. And of course, we are referring not just to 
the meaning of the universe for us, but its meaning 'for 
itself, or the meaning of the whole for itself. 
Similarly there is no point in asking the meaning of life, as 
life too is its meaning, which is self-referential and capable of 
changing, basicaly, when this meaning changes through a 
creative perception of a new and more encompas.sing 
meaning . 
You could also ask another question: What is the meaning 
of creativity itself? But as with al other fundamental 
questiom we cannot give a final answer, but we have to 
constantly se afresh. For the present we can say that 
creativity is not only the fresh perception of new meanings, 
and the ultimate unfoldment of this perception within the 
manifest and the somatic, but I would say that it is 
ultimately the action of the infinite in the sphere of the finite 
- that is, this meaning goes to infinite deptm. 
What is finite is, of course, limited. These limits may be 
extended in any number of ways but, however far you go, 
they are stil limited . What is limited in this way is not true 
creativity. At most it leads to a kind of mechanical 
rearangement of the kinds of elements and constituents that 
are pos.sible within those limits . One may think of anything 
finite as being suspended in a kind of deeper infinite context 
or background. Therefore the finite must ultimately be 
dependent on the infinite. And if it is open to the infinite 
then creativity can take place within it. So the infinite does 
not exclude the finite, but enfolds within it and includes and 
overlaps it. Every finite form is somewhat ambiguous 
because it depends on its context. This context goes on 
beyond al limits, and that is why creativity is óible. 
Things are never exactly what they mean; there is always 
some ambiguity. 
I think maybe that's where we'll end this and open it up 
for discusion. 
99 

Order and chaos 
Q: Are you saying that the ultimate, deep meaning of 
something is not subject to the soma-significant or signa­
somatic prooes.s? That it just is? 
Bohm: Well, that's one way you can think of it - that 
the signa-somatic and soma-significant prooes.s is the 
unfoldment of the deep meaning. 
Q: I think that the implicate order is intrinsically self· 
referential. I think it's the result of chaos theory, for 
example, where you have functions where xi + l would 
be a function of xi. We can't equate them, and you get 
either stable patterns which recur, which will be kind of 
stable patteros of stable particles; or at certain parameter 
values you get chaotic behaviour. This very much would 
sem to me to be one model which you could use to 
explain relatively stable patterns in this over-all movement 
or field, and relatively chaotic things - unexplainable 
things to our minds. Because chance events, or so-called 
random events, and strictly deterministic events sem to be 
coming from the same source. 
Bohm: I would say that there is no disorder, but that 
chaos is an order of infinitely complex nature. One form of 
chaos is entropy but, you see, there may be chaotic forms 
that are not in equilibrium. 
Q: Some method in madnes.s. 
Bohm: ... and there's sometimes madnes.s in method, right? 
(laughter) 
Q: If the form of things - thi5 planet with its mental 
substance and its physical substance - .i.!i entirely 
dependent on what's happening, what meanings it . . .  
Bohm: I would say ·ultimately', not 'entirely'. 
Q: That puts man in an interesting position. It would sem 
100 

Man unexplained 
that human consciousnª has the ability to contain meaning, 
and to transform meaning in a way that . . .  
Bohm: To be meaning - in a much more ful way than, say, 
ordinary, inanimate matter. 
Q: The qu5ion is: Is the physical and mental realm which 
we consider to have an existence of itself, is it in fact 
dependent on man for its existence, because man provides 
the meaning? 
Bohm: Well, I propose that it isn't. There may be something 
of a signa-somatic and soma-significant nature going on that 
has meaning for itself, or for the deeper levels - the ever 
more subtle levels. Nevertheless man may reveal something. 
You se, there's an argument given by Teilhard de Chardin 
saying that if you take the present views of science, they 
explain everything except man - his consciousness and what 
goes wrong with it, and so on. Now one view is to say that's a 
minor aberration, and eventually perhaps we'll overcome 
that. But the other view is to say that the thing unexplained is 
the sign of something much deeper. It often happens in 
science that something that cannot be explained, however 
small it is, shows up or reveals something much more 
fundamental. Like a few uranium atoms breaking up 
revealed a tremendous posibility. You could say, well it's 
just a few uranium atoms, what does it matter? So therefore 
man may be revealing something much deeper in the 
meaning of reality, because his brain is capable of a much 
greater unfoldment of meaning. 
Q: It sems we have to asume the possibility of that to 
actually reveal that po.5Sibility. 
Bohm: Yes. Well that is a thing we sometimes have to do, to 
presuppose something in order to realize it. That is, you can 
se its p<mibility and presuppose its reality, in order to bring 
about its reality. Now that is a propmal which we are going 
to explore. We are saying that everything that we're doing 
101 

Consciousnes as meaning 
here is a proposal that we are exploring. We are not starting 
out and saying this is the way it is. 
Q: The proposal that you are offering, if I'm understanding 
you correctly, is that your thinking is part of my 
consciousness, and then bemmes part of my thinking which 
changes my thinking, or modifies it. 
Bohm: And vice versa. 
Q: ... and vice versa. So we establish a dialogue here in 
comciousn%. And you are su ggert:ing that matter is 
behaving similarly, in diferent levels, according to the range 
of its conscious awaren%, whatever that might be. 
Bohm: Yes. But I would say aoording to the range of 
meaning. I think conscious awareness, its ñntial feature, is 
meaning. The content that one is conscioudy aware of, is 
meaning. And that meaning is active. The activity of 
consciousn% is determined by the meaning. Therefore you 
could say that consciousness, both in the features that we 
experience and in its activity, is meaning. Without meaning 
there is no comciousn%. And the greater the development of 
meaning, the greater the consciousnes. 
Q: And vice versa. 
Bohm: Yes. 
Q: So we have to find what meaning is. 
Bohm: Well, I don't think we can because that stil would 
presuppose meaning. You se, meaning is capable of 
iridefinite extension. And regarding this as a proposal that is 
to be explored - that is, if meaning is what life is - then a 
change of view of meaning is a change of life - a change of 
our lives - if we could really realize it. 
Q: When you say that our consciousn% is meaning, then we 
102 

Unfolding meaning 
have got to have some understanding as to what we mean 
by meaning, or else we can't actually go on talking. 
Bohm: Well, I've sort of unfolded some of the things I 
mean by meaning - that there is a perception of meaning 
going from one level to another, and a signa-somatic 
activity backward. But meaning is this whole activity in 
which the meaning of the soma comes into the next level 
of subtlety, and action goes back out. Those are some of 
the esential aspects of meaning - that meaning pervades 
being. I think that you cannot get the whole meaning of 
meaning because our ideas of meaning are never fully 
defined, and we can only sort of develop this meaning. 
Q: Can you distinguish between meaning and purpose 
here, because meaning is having to carry the burden of the 
meaning of purpose. 
Bohm: Well, I think purpose is part of the meaning -
that is, our purpose, our intention - I mean to do it. I 
want to say that the purpose flows out of the meaning, 
and through the action carried out, the meaning further 
changes, and we are back in this cycle. So meaning and 
purpose flow together. 
Q: Still, they should be different, otherwise there wouldn't 
be these two words. 
Bohm: Well, I was about to say that the difference is like 
the difference between the north and south pole.s of a 
magnet. They are introduced for the sake of thought but 
there is not actualy a sharp distinction between them. 
They are two sides of one flow. 
Q: As an absolute minimum, can I suggest as a proposal for 
us to work on, to define meaning as an appreciation of a 
connection between the points involved, which we are now 
talking about as meaning. The connection between these 
which makes sense - a connection in terms of which we can 
103 

Unfolding the meaning of meaning 
correlate those things we are feeling. It might be a minimum 
requirement. 
Bohm: Yes. We have, let's say, a connection between soma 
and significance, and the two directions of flow. 
Q: But then that is p.ming the things onto the word 'sense'. 
Bohm: Sense is meaning, right? It's another level of meaning. 
You se, I'm trying to say that you cannot get out of the field 
of meaning. We're unfolding the meaning of meaning that 
way, but it is stil in the field of meaning because its empham 
is meaning. & you say, it's a coherent meaning. But I think 
the most fundamental things cannot be defined; we can 
unfold them, but we can't define them. 
Q: Would the word 'relation.ship' come in here? Because it 
only makes a .sensible meaning if al the aspects are related. 
Bohm: Yes, if they are related consistently , right? That is, we 
find that things have no meaning when they are not 
consi!tent with each other. 
Q: I'm interested in knowing where the word 'energy' 
belongs in this proces, if 'proces' is the right word. You're 
suggesting that in order to move to deeper levels of meaning, 
or to become aware of al meaning, requires an increase of 
energy. But presumably 'energy', if we are looking at 
meaning as being fundamental, is a product of the meaning. 
Bohm: Yes. They work together. You se, again, these are 
three aspects of one whole flow. We distinguish them for the 
sake of thought in order to show relationships, but we do not 
start by .muming that they exist distinctly and separately. 
We have to say something which I didn't say before, that the 
question we could raise here is between appearance and 
reality. 
Now we usualy say that we have the appearance of things 
which shows up in the senses, and then we have our deeper 
104 

Creating reality 
thoughts which give the nee. That's one view. But if 
you look at it carefully, you will see that these thoughts are 
also appearances. They are limited, and so on. So you could 
say that the relationship between these two appearances 
gives a deeper reflection of reality than the one alone. The 
same, you se, as with all these meanings, right? 
Q: What I'm looking at is how one, in fact, conjures the 
energy - the direct experience to move from one level of 
meaning to the other. 
Bohm: Well, I think it either happens or it doesn't - that if 
somebody ses something of great meaning, the energy will 
arise. 
Q: In your triangle, where would you se man? I mean, do 
you se our function being to reveal meaning? Where do we 
stand, is it that we asume the place of revealing meaning? 
Bohm: Well, we reveal meaning in a way which the rest of 
matter does not . But we are meanings. You se, I think that 
if you say 'reveal meaning', it suggests that meaning is 
something different from being. 
Q: When I think about the alienation that people feel -
sympathizing with al that you have ben saying - the 
mesage to me is that we can create our own reality. 
Bohm: Well, there are some limits to it, but you se, we can 
do so to a large extent. We don't really know what reality is. 
Q: We can define its meaning. 
Bohm: Yes, well, then the question is whether it's a coherent 
reality or not. You se, in previous periods people created a 
reality according to mythological meanings which had a 
certain coherence; the action flowing from it produced a 
certain coherent society, up to a point, and therefore people 
lived in that reality, you se. We have now created a 
105 

The flow t"hat creates the universe 
different reality, and we could stil create a yet different 
reality. 
Q: And the other pieces are there when we say we determine 
a value - a meaning that is important to w. So we set about 
creating that as part of our life, and then it gets blocked, and 
then we look within to what it is about w and our meaning 
that is blocking us, and we change that. 
Bohm: Yes. You se, we are stuck with the old meanings 
which are in a rut - the old thought, the old program. Now 
iruofar as we look into them, then that may change; the 
block being removed, new meanings can be perceived. 
Q: . . .  and then exchanged. But we are doing it, and that's an 
important . . .  
Bohm: Yes. We are doing it. We are the doing of it as well. 
Q: Then in the picture - the triangle itself - is that a 
description of the physical universe? And as Graham asb, 
'Where does man fit in there?' It made me think, well, is that 
a description of man and of the physical universe? And what 
I started to mention earlier is that the flow in the three 
Gunas - the flow between the three aspects of life - will 
actually create the physical universe? 
Bohm: Well, one could say that this was actually a way of 
looking at the flow that creates the universe and creates us. It 
is a way of thinking about it. 
Q: Would it be right to say that you would define evolution 
as the movement of the universe towards its own coherence, 
in terms of what it is or can be? 
Bohm: Yes. Evolution is the unfoldment of these meanings. 
Q: In terms of greater and greater coherence? 
106 

Planning and creative action 
Bohrn: Yes. 
Q: And subtlety? 
Bohm: Subtlety, yE$. (long pause) Now what this suggeru 
then, is that we have open to us a trem endous pos.sibility. 
And in fact, it's the present meanings that are 
programmed, that are leading us to all these troublE$. 
Now you see, the fact is that the world means a place 
where everybody must scramble for himself, and where 
each nation must defend itself, and so on. And that makes 
inevitable all the consequencE$ that are building up. Now 
that's the result of history. A change of meaning is 
necesary to change this world politically and economically 
and socially. But that change must begin with the 
individual; it must change for him, right? 
Q: The question is finally: Do we have any choice in the 
way that change goes? 
Bohrn: Well, can Newton choose to perceive the law of 
gravitation? You se, I think we can have this pas.sionate 
intensity to look at it, to explore it, to find out where it 
isn't making sense, and why, right? Then it will change 
creatively. You se, we can't produce the change that is 
really needed to change the future of mankind. 
Q: Inherent in that whole proces is the fact that meaning 
will unfold as meaning unfolds. I mean, you can't know 
ahead. 
Bohrn: No. And that is true in every creative act. I think 
therefore the attempt to make a plan to change society is not 
going to work, because society is the result of what it means 
to us, and the plan wil not change what it means. You may 
plan the perfect socialist society in which there is complete 
justice and equality, but what the world mearn to these 
people is more or les the same as before you made the plan, 
and it will produce the same sort of society as we see now. 
107 

Revealing programs 
Q: So what's stopping this? Blockage, you said. If it is, 
how do we unblock the blockage? 
Bohm: Yes, well, that's a difficult one . . . .  (laughter). You see, 
to begin with, it requires some attention to reveal this 
blockage, and to feel it, and to se the thought that is behind 
it -:-:- the fixed thought. Now you se that thought acts like a 
program which is very fast, and it hides itself. That is the 
whole problem - that thought tends to conceal itself - as 
you may have noticed. It's a program which is programmed 
to conceal itself. Any attack on the program wil sem to be 
an attack on what I am, right? And therefore, automaticaly, 
I will prevent any move to make that attack. And 
concealment is one way of preventing attack. 
Q: But there can be other clues - the body, and then the 
emotions. 
Bohm: Yes. The thiní show up in the body and the 
emotions, but the connection between that and thought 
tends to be concealed. 
Q: There is an indication that there is a way of removing 
these blocb, and that that can be a very natural 
experience. Are we saying that? That by just seing - the 
act of seing our programs - if we can bring ourselves to 
that state, and consistently, there is an evolution of the 
universe and the meaning of which we are a part. 
Bohm: Yes. If we can se these programs, then they will 
change - if we se the meaning of these programs as 
programs. At present they don't mean programs to us; they 
mean something much more fundamental. They mean me, 
right? 
Q: The act of seing reveals them as programs and defuses 
them, or disempowers them . 
Bohm: Yes. Now the point is to realî that perception. 
108 

Education and concealment 
Q: You might say the blocks are ignorance. and the solution 
is the light of education. 
Bohm: But the difficulty there, is that the education is being 
provided by people who are still blocked. You se, we need a 
creative act. 
Q: It's more than jwt seing it; it takes replacement. 
Bohm: It takes realizing it. It's really sticking to that 
perception and carrying it out. Now that may be very 
difficult becawe the thought is very elusive, and it 
continually creeps in by the back door. But I'm just pointing 
out the nature of the difficulty that we are facing. Now you 
could say that you mwt start with right relationships in your 
ordinary life and se the blocks to that. But if you start out 
establishing those relations, you will find difficulties. They 
are not merely to be overcome, but one has got to se the 
source of these in the program of thought which includes the 
emotions and the body. And you se, one can stick to it. 
There's room for both a flash of insight, and also for the hard 
work required for continual development. To realize that 
insight may require quite hard work. 
Q: In other words, actually the clue about the thought 
proceses is quite obvious if you look at the interactions in our 
world. I mean. it's not that difficult, even though thought is 
programmed to conceal itself. Unles we are gros.sly 
dishonest, we can't avoid the fact that we are having a row 
with someone. or that there is nuclear war. 
Bohm: Yes. Now one interesting thing to do is, as the impulse 
to anger, or to do something develops. if you suspend it then 
it becomes clear that you have got an impulse to do 
something that doesn't make sense. You se, if you don't 
suspend it, but cary it out, then you are caried away, right? 
Now instead, you could act out the impulse. rather than 
cary it out - act it out within. That's realy what 
imagination is, right? You se, imagination is not just making 
109 

Acting out and holding back 
a photographic image or a television image, but it's acting 
out the meaning. 
Q: So if you hold baclc on intention, that will reveal . . .  
Bohm: It helps to. It helps reveal the meaning behind it -
the thought behind it with its meaning. Now the intention 
to strike out verbally or physically when somebody does 
something outrageous, or insults you, and so on, if you 
hold it back, then you'll begin to get a feeling in your 
body of that action flowing out from some deep intention. 
But behind that intention is the thought, 'He can't do this 
to me; he's pushing me around; he's acting outrageously; 
he's violating my rights,' and so on. That is, somewhere 
you'll find a thought . 
Q: If you follow through with the intention, you'll never 
notice. 
Bohrn: Yes. If you cary it out, the thought must ordinarily 
act itself out in order to reveal what it means inside. At a 
certain stage it's like an actor carried away by his role, and 
he starts to carry it out rather than act it out. That is, an 
actor plunging a dagger into you doesn't actually go al the 
way, right? If he got too engrosed, it might go all the way. 
Q: There seems to be a great push for us to want to be 
spontaneous, which is actually going along with intention. 
Bohm: With the program. You se, spontaneity - true 
spontaneity - is dificult to distinguish from the program, 
right? 
Q: In this area, between the program and this act of 
spontaneity , is there anything that we can do other than 
educating in terms of the programs, to train ourselves as 
an organism , to be able to see further and further, deeper 
and deeper, to find platforms for ourselves from which we 
can see? 
110 

Friendship, criticism and meditation 
Bohm: Well, I think that we can first of all try to observe our 
own habits and programs, and suspend them sufficiently to 
get some insight; and secondly, in relationship, we can 
observe this happening. Also, I think, in dialogue it could 
perhaps begin to be revealed because different people can 
se different aspects of this whole thing. Now that would 
require howeverī as Peter was saying, that people be really 
friends with e.ach other, so that they can take criticisms from 
each other - things that will appear to be criticisms. You 
se, the minute that somebody is pointing out that you are 
doing something wrong, or silly, or something, then there is 
a reaction, and you say no it's not. You defend yourself. That 
is part of the concealment. It's very hard to be able to take 
this. But in this dialogue it must be possible for it to go both 
ways, you se? Now say, in the family, the parents will do 
this with their children, but the children are not allowed to 
do it with the parents. Usually they say that the children 
really do not understand enough. But that often conceals the 
fact that the parents don't understand - don't want 
themselves criticized or anything. So the question is whether 
we can establish a relationship truly between two friends, so 
that this dialogue is really ¯ible? 
Q: In addition, there is one's dialogue with on഍f. Would 
meditative and reflective techniques short out the program? 
Bohm: Well, we would have to say what they were to se 
how they get at the programs. The word 'meditation' has so 
many meanings, and I would say that the attempt to watch 
one's own programs is the beginning of a kind of meditation, 
right? But then we could say the attempt to do this in a 
dialogue would be a kind of social meditation. Now here the 
notion of the implicate order would be relevant, because we 
could say there is a flow back and forth - what I am is 
enfolded in you, and what you are is enfolded in me. And 
that comes back to me through you, right? Therefore instead 
of reflecting it within myself, I reflect it in the dialogue; we 
reflect it in the dialogue. Now that may bring out many 
things more clearly. So we could say that there is also a social 
111 

Programs and spontaneity 
meditation p¶ible; the dialogue could be regarded as that. 
Q: Sometimes we are inclined to look for a program that 
would help us to be aware of our programs. It might be 
one hour of a certain meditation every morning, or from 
now on I contact my friend every evening - and this 
would not be sufficient. 
Bohm: No. I think that we can't lay down a program. We 
have to be creative. The same trick doesn't always work 
twice. It may work a few times but not neces.sarily 
indefinitely . 
Q: At best it would set up another level of mechanism. 
Bohm : Yes. 
Q: And the energy would be reduced as you suggested, 
because it becomes increasingly mechanical - I meditate 
every day at 10 am, and so on. 
Bohrn: Now you see, meditation can take place in any 
context. 
Q: What I find very important about this, right now, is 
that, although I have come across the thought of creativity 
coming from nothing, I have never been so aware of it as 
right now. Because I think I always thought creativity 
came from spontaneity. And I have just got the point that 
you were making about spontaneity, and that makes me 
realize how by standing back and not being spontaneous 
necesarily, in a difficult situation, you get into a state of 
knowing what the thought was, and then by ridding 
yourself of the thought, you are into nothing, like you 
don't know about anything, and you then can be creative. 
Bohm : Yes. That is, true spontaneity may be the suspension 
of what appears to be spontaneity, but is not truly. You se, 
the concealment of the program is that it conceals this 
112 

Climate for change 
activity as the appearance of spontaneity, which is not 
true, right? There are all sorts of clever ways in which the 
programs conceal themselves as the non-program. 
Q: Isn't a very important requirement for change, beyond 
self-examination, beyond dialogue, that there is a climate, 
a climate that one finds oneself in? 
Bohm: Well, that's true, yes. 
Q: Isn't it posible to at least suggest that perhaps the 
evidence of us here, is that there's a change of climate 
going on; that perhaps there is a situation where it's 
maybe created by us, where the climate on earth can 
become more and more suitable for the sort of change we 
see as being necßary. 
Bohm: Yes. We need a certain environment, a certain 
place in which we can do this. And peo;ile who have the 
intention, the serious intention to do it, are coming 
together and creating the opportunity to do so. 
Q: There is something here, touching back to what we 
were saying about the whole being more than the sum of 
its parts, that in dialogue one can se things if one is 
willing to be seen, and to take somebody else's 
perceptions. One can see more with another than one can 
see oneself. And that we together, collectively, can see 
more individually. And that works more broadly, in that 
perhaps, as we are a part of a culture, we can have some 
sense of where we are going, and get perceptions that 
aren't available to the individual, or the individual 
organization, or the individual set, or group, or whatever. 
Bolun: Yes, well, we have to explore . You see, I am not 
telling you that I know how to do it. I've merely said that 
these are some of the things I've sen, and we've got to take it 
from there , right? Now the difficulty with our culture is its 
terrible confusion, right? I mean, I shouldn't use these loaded 
113 

Culture, chaos and order 
war, but I think that we hardly even have a culture 
now. If you take ancient Greece, and, say, a place like 
Athens, with a small number of people who were not 
wealthy, and take what they produced.; and then take 
what has ben produced by us who are enormously greater 
in number and far wealthier; even then, most of our good 
culture, our really good culture, has ben done in the past, 
and that's not a lot. Conditions are not favourable now, 
because of the general deterioration going on. I think those 
who feel differently have got to somehow get together, as 
we are doing now, and create an environment, an 
ambience, in which we seriously have the intention of 
exploring being creative in this new way. 
Q: You know, there is a funny thing happening, that 
because of this confusion it sems that there might be some 
mechanism that culture can use to repair itself and jump 
to a higher level. There is a German writer who has talked 
much about this change in social character, that when 
young people are around 20 years old they don't have this 
fixed set of norms that we had a generation ago, because 
they are culturally liberated, and they have to start afresh 
when they are grown up; they have to build up themselves 
what we got from our parents. So it sems that the whole 
thing generates this situation. It might further the proces. 
Bohm: It could. You see, Prigogine has said that in certain 
situations a new order can develop out of chaos. What is 
required there, is not merely the equilibrium chaos of a 
certain thing at an equilibrium temperature, but rather a 
situation where there is chaos with a certain order in it. 
Namely, let's say, a temperature difference from one place 
to another. And in that temperature difference the chaos 
develops new forms of order. You se, we need some 
ordered field in which this chaos could develop, hence the 
new forms of order. I don't know what that would be, but 
as you say, the fact that the whole culture is being 
disolved leaves people's min not strongly set. But on the 
other hand, it gives no impetus there to do very much. 
114 

Fear 
Q: But maybe even the terrifying threat from the bomb, 
the fear of all the chaos, might be the thing that could 
provide it. 
Bohm: Well, I don't think fear can do it. You se, I think 
only love can do it. Creativity is not påble out of fear. 
Q: No, but you se, although there has not been so much 
focusing on the Christian mæage of love, very many 
people have begun to realize that you have to develop this 
quality in yourself. And I think, actually, that the terrible 
threats we are living under are sort of making people 
realize that this is the way. 
Bohm: Yes, well, I hope so. I mean, I don't know. You 
se, I'm suspicious of fear as a motive for anything because 
I think fear distorts. 
Q: Since fear came up, can you tell me what you think 
fear is? 
Bohm: What does it mean, right? That's the same question 
- what is it, and what does it mean, right? Well, first of 
al I think we'll begin at the primitive, animal level where 
there is a reaction of fear to a perceived danger, and this 
may often be a reflex. For example, I read somewhere that 
there were certain birds who have to be afraid of hawks, 
and when they take a hawk-like shape made of paper, the 
bird sort of freezes. That is, any shape of that form means 
danger, and danger means fear. That is, danger means 
that al the chemical mçngers to alert the body must 
move out and make the body do whatever would be 
appropriate, right? Now that is the beginning of fear, 
where it makes sense. 
Q: So fear is like a runaway loop with no block. 
Bohm: Yes. The fear made sense at a certain level and still 
does. But the difficulty is this: that when the brain 
115 

Fear, pleasure and rage 
developed this large cortex which could then create out of 
thought all sorts of forms in the imagination, then this 
could also liberate fear. And that fear also works the same 
way; the fear disturbs the thought proces. You se, 
thought does not work properly when the brain is 
disturbed by fear. All the chemistry is wrong. 
Q: Maybe fear was very useful, as you say. 
Bohm: For a primitive animal. 
Q: Right. But now perhaps we have something else that is 
more useful than fear that we can put in its place - what 
we're developing - and that's that instantaneous 
knowing, or sensitivity to whatever. That inclination exists 
so that if there were a snake coming through the door, we 
could know it instantaneously before it gets here, so we 
can respond or act appropriately before it actually gets 
here. 
Bohm: I think that is pùible if you have not ben heavily 
programmed about snakes. You se, I saw a program on 
television where someone was heavily programmed about, 
what was it? Spiders. And it took a terrific amount of 
work to get rid of that fear, you see. They were terrified 
of spiders. Now we have all sorts of fears, individual and 
collective. There is the fear of the stranger, the fear of the 
enemy. Now once fear takes hold, all the chemistry of the 
brain is altered. All sorts of chemicals change, the 
electrical distribution changes, the blood changes, and the 
thought proces does not proced with clarity. Now I think 
that our education often tends to foster fear, because a 
great deal of education is through fear. I mean, a child is 
threatened if he doesn't do right, and he's reYJarded if he 
does. These are two sides of the same thing. That is, fear 
and pleasure and rage are really related. I saw some 
research into the structure of the brain. There are certain 
pleasure centres which when stimulated - they did it in a 
cat, and the cat looked very happy - and then by 
116 

Fear, love and attention 
increasing the stimulation of those centres you could see 
the cat terrified, and with still further increase he went 
into a kind of rage which was pleasure again. And 
therefore every one of those emotions will affect the whole 
chemistry. 
We have to face the nature of fear. You asked what was 
the meaning of fear, and what is its nature. So, fear is a 
reaction which started at the animal level and became 
entangled with the intellect and the imagination. And 
now, that fear disturbs the thought proceses so that the 
greater it is, the more the imagination projects images that 
feed the fear. 
Q: Can we go into what sems to be the opposite of fear? 
The opposite of fear is love. Would you se this as having 
a closenes.s or kiruhip to this flow of meaning, energy and 
matter? 
Bohm: Yes. I mean ifs very hard to say much about it, 
but the true creativity in this flow would only be possible 
with love. 
Q: Perhaps love is that flow. 
Bohm: Yes. It may be. 
Q: Would you say something, David, about attention, 
because all the time you have been speaking, we have 
ben moving our attention around into different areas, and 
does attention relate to meaning? 
Bohm: Well, I think we have to give attention to the 
meaning. We give our attention to whether the thing 
makes sense , or doesn't make serue, for example. We give 
attention, first of all, to what is actualy happening, and 
at higher levels we give attention to whether something is 
making sense or not. 
Q: So it may be that by the movement of attention, which 
117 

Attention and intention 
we sem to have some ability to handle, we can allow 
meaning to have greater unfoldment, if you like, placing 
the attention on the meaning rather than the energy or the 
matter. 
Bohm: Yes. And in order to do that, to some extent the 
action must be suspended, right? Now it's very hard to 
give attention to the meaning while you're actually doing 
it, though perhaps it is possible. 
Q: Well, doesn't it happen at the point where, as you 
were saying, we are meaning? 
Bohm: Yes. 
Q: That's where the attention and the meaning become 
one - I am meaning. 
Bohm: Yes. You see, what is attention? These words are 
very vague; their meanings are not clear. Now attention, 
aCX-'Ording to the dictionary - its root is to stretch the 
mind, tension, at-tention, to stretch the mind toward 
something. That is it. In other words, you stretch the 
mind to come into contact with that something. 
Q: What relation does attention have to intention, 
etymologically? 
Bohm: Well, it's the same root . Intention means, I 
suppose, the tension within. The tension to do something, 
that state of tension out of which you act, right? Also the 
word 'tendency' is in there as well; the meaning of 
tendency, as the tendency within the intention . . .  
Q: Attention sems to suggest the person alerts himself 
fuly to what's on. He is fully with it . That is what 
attention is. We say for example, you ought to pay 
attention . Attention is giving yourself fully to what is on at 
any one time - giving yourself, in that sense. 
118 

An experience of unfoldment 
Bohm: And that pich up the meaning, right? 
Q: I was very interested in your soma-significant and 
signa-somatic relationship between body and the unfolding 
of deeper and deeper levels as you go on. Can you give us 
an example of an experience of your own? 
Bohm: Well, I can't at this moment give an example. 
Q: Would you like me to give one? 
Bohm: If you like. 
Q: You se, something happened in several levels, in 
working with a particular patient. This patient was given 
to meditation, the practice of meditation. In my work, I 
don't use meditation; it is simply standard psychoanalytic 
treatment of patients. At the end of a sesion, the third 
ses.sion or so after the patient started, she asked that when 
there was five minutes to spare, could we spend five 
minutes in meditation . I've never done that before. I 
myself meditate, but I'm inexperienced in this sort of 
thing. So the way she asked, I agreed. Now I had a 
question as to whether I should have done it, because my 
profesional terms of reference would not be to mix the 
two things . So I left the question in my mind. Till then, 
my mental activity was with the psychoanalytic treatment 
of dealing with her material at the surface level perhaps, 
or the interaction level. After that, I closed my eyes as she 
did. I meditated; she meditated. And my meditation was, 
simply, to empty my mind, not with any thoughts, but 
ju.st being. And it emerged , after I had closed my eyes, I 
suddenly saw, but with my eyes closed, a person rising 
about six feet away from me at my desk, symbolizing a 
soldier sort of figure. He walked forward, and there was a 
cushion in his hand. He went to the patient and put it at 
her feet. He walked backward, and then came forward 
towards me with a cushion and put it at my feet. My eye.s 
were closed, and I immediately understood that this was 
119 

Recognizing soma-significance 
an answer from somewhere deep within myself that it was 
OK to let the meditation take place. I recognized him as a 
minor incarnation of the great Shiva. I did not know at 
that time what he did or why he came. 
The next day, Saturday, I went to the library and 
looked up all about him . His mission was to restore the 
right relationship between the spiritual order and the 
secular order. There are more amazing things about this, 
but if we just say that in terms of these levels of 
unfoldment, first, I was concerned about leaving my 
ordinary, mental activity in my profӪional work, and 
second, I stood outside of it and asked a que5ton about the 
technique - mixing the technique - and there was no 
active, mental operation. Simply from somewhere within, 
this mental image just came up, possibly from some 
collective unconscious in which this image lay, and it just 
rose. From al of the literature that I know, this would be 
nearer to the answer to this question of how, in the body, 
some of these deeper mental activities are projected. 
Peter Garrett: I think we are going to have to finish off 
son. We have ben going for nearly two and a quarter 
hours. 
Bohm: Yes. It's ben a long time. (laughter) 
Q: Ifs ben a marvellous one though. 
120 

MORE ON SOMA-SIGNIFICANCE 
MEANING, SPACE, TIME, MATTER, 
AND MEMORY 
Bohm: We ended up on soma-significance yesterday with 
this diagram (triangle - page 91). Now I'm di.scuďing its 
meaning. We have meaning, energy and matter. One can 
say that matter is a kind of conderuation of energy that 
according to modern physics is interconvertible with energy. 
You can take matter, and it will dis.integrate into energy. For 
example, an electron and a proton combine to give rise to 
light energy, or gamma ray energy; or vice versa, gamma 
rays can give rise to electrons and positrons. Now you can 
create matter out of energy or energy out of matter. They 
can tum into each other. And there is an interesting way of 
looking at that. 
One view of matter is that we have a fundamental 
movement at the speed of light. The speed of light is, 
according to relativity, the same no matter what your sped 
is. You se, ordinarily you would think that the speed ot 
sound is something you could catch up with and overtake in 
a supersonic airplane; but light cannot be overtaken. It's like 
the horizon, no matter how fast you go it is stil the same 
distance away. That is the content of the theory of relativity. 
Space and time are relative to sped. We discover that we 
could ask the question: Suppose you moved with the light 
ray? As you move faster and faster and approach the speed of 
light, the amount of time between the begining and theend 
which is in your own frame, gets 1. and so dĐ the amount 
of space. At the speed of light, the beginning and the end of 
the ray are separated by neither time nor space. Not that we 
can actualy reach that, but for the sake of imagination you 
can suppose it, and therefore you could say that something 
timel sems to be involved. And spacelao; - a 
fundamental relatioruhip which is beyond time and space. 
121 

Light, time and space 
We will diagram it like this: 
TIME 
If you put two light rays together this way, they build up 
into time: 
TIME 
122 

Light, time and space 
And if you put them together like this, they make space: 
TIME 
Eventualy then you could put more in, to obtain structures 
of time and space out of structures of light rays, each of 
which are beyond time and space. That is, the fundamental 
interval would not be time and space, but time and space 
would emerge out of this - out of the structure of 
connection of these light rays, right? 
Now current modern physics thinks of the electron as 
moving back and forth, approaching the sped of light, so its 
average speed 15, whatever it will be leM than the sped of 
light, right? Now in a way, the energy is being reflected. 
That is, instead of going straight on as with light, it gets 
reflected somehow back and forth. Now that reflection is 
what turm energy into matter. You se, the energy is 
condensed. And if the reflection ceases, the matter turns into 
energy. But it always was energy. So matter arises when 
there arises a pattern which reflects back and forth and 
becomes stable. 
Q: What is it that is causing the reflection, then? 
Bohm: Well, you see, we don't know. (laughter) That requires 
a deeper theory in physics, which we don't really have. But we 
123 

Meaning, energy and matter 
could say that, in so far as there is reflection, then energy 
turns into matter. If the energy does not flow freely, it 
becomes a kind of matter; and that energy can be released by 
ceasing that reflection and making it go straight, right? 
Q: And we say the same thing, don't we? 'What's the 
matter?' (laughter) When somebody is bouncing around, 
and it's not flowing freely, we say, 'What's the matter?' 
Q: So matter is the interference of the flow of light energy? 
Bohm: Well, that is one way of looking at it, yes - to say 
that matter is one development out of energy, which is light 
or anything similar which moves at the speed of light. Now 
therefore matter brings in time and space. But pure energy 
would not have time and space, according to that view. 
Q: So that's why thought-forms deflect, to a great degree, 
the pure energy? 
Bohm: Yes. Now we could say that it may be meaning that 
turns energy into matter, or matter into energy. 
Q: You have used the image of energy as being a huge ocean 
with lots of swells, and matter like lots of little icebergs or 
lumps that congeal on the surface. I find that a lovely image 
because it enables me to get hold of a lot of things. But could 
you say something about where it's misleading? 
Bohm: Well, the ocean is not actually a substance, you 
know, but it's an ocean of energy. When you come to empty 
space, this energy . . .  It's hard to describe. That is, it's in the 
implicate order. It is not localized. And then you raise the 
energy a little bit above that of empty space - the energy of 
empty space is enormous - and make a ripple on top, then 
you get matter, You can raise it and get light , a form of wave 
which just goes straight on, or you can raise it in a way that 
makes reflection take place, and it'll become matter, right? 
Now matter is then a sort of ripple on top of the sea of energy 
124 

Perceiving the universe 
which sort of involves reflection back and forth. 
Q: Like a standing wave? 
Bohm: Yes. 
Q: Is that in empty space? 
Bohm: Well, space may appear to be empty because matter 
and light, which are excitations of the vacuum, pass through it 
without deflection. So all we see is through matter and light. 
And light just goes straight through, as if it were empty. 
Q: Would you say that matter and light are phenomena of 
nature, or are they things that only become manifest when 
one bit of nature, you might cal it the sea of energy, interacts 
with another bit, which you might cal the nervous system? In 
other words , do they exist independently of a perceiver? 
Bohm: Well, that's a deep question. You see, I think that we 
are supposing, in some sense, that the universe exists 
independently of particular perceivers. The question you 
could raise is whether the universe perceives itself in some 
way through soma-significance. 
Q: Someone said that matter is like thoughts crossing in 
space, and where they meet, it forms matter; and that sort of 
equates with this doesn't it? 
Bohm: There may be a relationship. I merely brought that 
up to help explain the diagrams a little bit. But really, I was 
wondering whether people want to go on discusing what we 
said yesterday? 
Q: You could say a few wor<k on time. This word has come 
up many times, (laughter) and I haven't ben able to realy 
get a grasp on what time is. 
Bohm: Yes, well, time is a very difficult subject . Let me, first 
125 

Time 
of all, begin in ordinary experience. Now time has two 
aspects, you se. Man began to notice time as recurrence, the 
recurrence of the seasoru, the recurrence of the days, the 
recurrence of the heartbeats, the proces which recurs 
regularly and enables you to measure time, right? But then, 
there must also be something non-recurrent. Growth and 
decay, right? So you can say that certain things grow and 
decay during or after a certain number of the cycles of the 
recurrent proces of the days and nights, or of the seasons of 
the year, right? So time, our concept of time, involves the 
interweaving of what is recurrent and what is non-recurrent. 
Now the suggestion is that time may be a way of thinking in 
abstraction from the whole proces.s - from the order of 
proces.s. This time order has a certain irreversibility in the 
sense that you cannot go back to what came before. It does 
not return, right? There is something recurrent, but there is 
also that which does not return, and nothing recurs perfectly, 
at least some things may seem to, like the atomic vibrations, 
but even then the state of the universe has changed since the 
beginning in such a way that even they have changed. 
Now the question is about our experience of time. On the 
one hand, we experience time by being in synchronism with 
al this proces.s going on in nature, and all around us. And we 
learn to think of it in terms of periods of time, breaking them 
up, and so on. Now time also contains duration - that is, 
these periods - certain thinĔ endure, while others change, 
right? Now if some things lest a very long time, this would 
suggest, eventualy, something which would be eternal, 
therefore beyond time, in the sense that it would cover all of 
time, right? Now also we can make d uratioru that are shorter 
and shorter and eventually try to think of an instant of time. 
But everything that we actually experience has some 
duration, right? Now I think most religions have raised the 
idea that there is something beyond time. And this analogy 
in physics suggests that there may be something beyond time 
- that this light ray, in some way, is a structure that does 
not involve time in itself; but that time arises in relatiomhip 
to these structures. 
Now ordinarily we experience through time, and there are 
126 

Time and thought 
many paradoxes in that because we think of past, present 
and future. But you se, the past is gone, and the future is not 
yet, and the present, taken as the dividing point between 
past and future, divides what doesn't exist from what doesn't 
exist. So that would suggest that there is no present. Another 
view though is to say that the actual moment of existence -
this present - is in some sense beyond time. That is, 
everything that we se, and everything that we can 
recognize, depends on thought, on the past, on knowledge. 
This enters into our perception. We see all the forms and 
shapes, and so on. Without thought we would not be able to 
say what we se, or even se anything very definite. 
But thought takes time, and thinking takes a lot of time, as 
I said. And thought, although it's very fast, still takes some 
time. Now ordinarily, when we look at this chair, for 
example, we say we can think about it and say we know it; 
but we only know its past. But for practical purposes, its 
present is not very different from its pa.st. So that we really 
have a practical knowledge of this chair from its past, right? 
Now mã of science and technology is based on that kind of 
knowledge; but when we come to pө that are 
extremely fast and subtle, then that kind of knowledge no 
longer holds. So if we try to look into our own consciousnas 
and, say, look at what we are, what we will se is what we 
have ben, right? The thought takes time. Therefore 
whatever thought presents us, the content of consciousnas is 
a little behind the actual present. Now as I said, for the chair 
that's not important; but consciousnas may - soma· 
significance may - reach into depths that are very subtle 
and fast. Therefore we may be mising the äntial point. 
Now many religions have raised the question of the timeless 
- whether there is not something beyond time - rather like 
this light ray, which would be the more elementary basis of 
experience or perception . Now time would be contained 
enfolded within this timeless state. For example, we can see 
already that present memory enfolds the past of the previous 
memory, and that enfolds the previous memory, and so on. 
There's a kind of order, like a set of Chinese boxes. So in any 
moment - in soma·significance - there is a kind of memory 
127 

Now 
which gives the meaning of time, and this memory may not be 
entirely accurate. And of course, there's a kind of projection 
toward the future which has been even less accurate . 
Q: Are you saying that there is definitely a direction, as in 
the nesting of the Chinese boxes? 
Bohm: Yes. And then the next moment comes, and it enfolds 
the memory of this moment, right? 
Q: That would bring out whe.t we were looking e.t a little bit 
yesterday - the need to dwell in the present moment -
talking about something timeles or beyond the dimension of 
time. To dwell in the present moment requires not dwellling 
in thought, because thought takes duration and is a slow 
proces. We start to find a need, maybe, not to deny thought 
but to find the part of the experience which is before 
thought. Then thought moves on afterwards. 
Bohm: Yes. That is really what is implied. 
Q: How far can feeling be immediate? 
Bohm: Well, in so far as it is affected by thought of course, it 
is not. Now there is a kind of perception which is immediate, 
but I think that the minute you distinguish it in some way ­
that is, through thought, right? - it must be a little behind. 
Q: Is this suggesting that the transcendent state may be one 
thing that is now? 
Bohm: Yes. And that now is also eternal in the sense that 
each moment - now - is al we.ys now, right? Now if you 
were to remove all the details, then there would be no 
fundamental difference of all the nows. On the other hand, 
al these details may be very important for other reasons. 
Q: I didn't understand what you meant by each moment 
now is always now. 
128 

Thought and perception 
Bohm: Well, whenever we have this moment now, we have 
various details that thought provides which are in the past, 
but in the next moment that situation will prevail again, and 
so on . 
Q: Could one have something here, like with music? You 
have various notes, some of which are falling away, and 
others are being sounded. You get patterns on those notes. 
You could have what is the present moment in fact, overlaid 
with thoughts and feeling which come later. And as long as 
you have a clear chord sounded by one of these, you say, 'I 
hit the mark.' In other words, they al correlate with a 
certain harmony. If they don't, the present moment overlaid 
with the thoughts and feeling that are coming through out of 
the past, don't give the feeling of hitting the mark. There's 
some relationship there. 
Bohm: Yes. Our confusion is that we generally see the effect 
of thought fused with perception. The shape of things 
depends on the past thoughts and the way we react or respond 
to them. Therefore we do not see that that is the past. Now 
that past is important in a certain area. But in another area it 
might not be so important, or it might even get in the way. 
Q: I was thinking that the problem is when you lose the 
sensation of the flow - I can't think of a better description. I 
mean that seeing the shape of things as being dependent on 
past thought is alright, as long as it doesn't get stuck - for 
instance, in judgement, or in assuming your assessments are 
the way things really are, and continuing to act on the basis of 
that assessment which was from the past, and so wasn't even 
accurate really when you saw it. So you need to just keep on 
moving without the past being the cause of your next action. 
Bohm: Yes. One can say that psychologically the next 
moment need not be determined by the past, because it 
comes from meaning, right? 
Q: Does al this amount to saying that the only direct 
129 

Sensory e7:perience, creativity and meaning 
e.xperience in the instant is the sensory experience, but that 
we use the word 'sensory' metaphoricaly? As Peter was 
saying, there's the thought in the pv which makes the 
experience, but prior to thought there was the experience 
itself. Say for e.xample, seing - I se the thing; the seing 
itself is immediate and direct; it's not in the pa.st. It's the 
thought about what I have sen, and the memory of it that is 
in the pv. And this applies to touching - al the senses. 
And this may apply to intuition, say, where you simply 
e.xperience directly. It's direct in fact - prior to - and when 
it comes to awarenes it's probably a question of 
illumination, or coming nearer to the light, as another 
metaphor. You are there, ilumined, or your sensitivity is 
there, just to be picked up; you don't do anything more with 
it. That moment is present time. 
Bohm: The problem is that thought works very fast. We 
have the program, and the program affects the seing. Now 
the question is, can we se the program as the program, 
rather than seing it in terms of its meaning? You se, the 
program has a meaning that is created mechanicaly, and 
that meaning is fused with the meaning of direct perception. 
Q: I'm always coming across this statement in the literature 
which says something like, events exist prior to us in time. 
That being so, we cannot create anything, since al things 
exist already, and we can perhaps only discover. Does that 
mean that when it comes into the explicate order from the 
implicate, that is what you mean by creation? 
Bohm: I think that if we said that we only discover things, 
that would say that the whole of time and space are already 
determined, and we merely find out what's there, right'? And 
then we would raise the question: What about us? Who are 
we? Are we part of time and space? So are we determined too 
in that way? Now I think that it would be better to say that 
time and space are not determined, but rather 1 that they are 
like meaning, they are part of meaning. Now we said that 
meaning is ambiguous, and that leaves room for creativity. 
130 

The meaning of meaning 
New meanings emerge, and there.fore something new 
emerges . 
Q: Where do those new meaning emerge from? 
Bolun: Yes. Now if we raise that question, you say we have 
meaning, energy and matter. Now they might emerge from 
energy, or from matter - that's one way of looking at it. But 
then energy and matter are also forms of meaning; so I think 
that we finaly have to say that perhaps that is not a right 
question. It makes some asumption. You se, I'm only 
exploring now. 
Q: It could also be an inherent aspect of meaning. In other 
words, meaning may inherently change in itself, and the 
programs may be a denial of that. 
Bolun: Yes. You se, meaning has the character of being able 
to go into the meaning of meaning . Now where that comes 
from, I don't know. You se, at some stage when we are 
disciming something, we have to say this is our starting 
point, which we might question later. 
Q: We are continualy adding perception, and when we add 
a perception we expand the context, and as we expand the 
context, the meaning and the context wil both change for us. 
And therefore it's a continuum in that serue. 
Bolun: Yes. The change of meaning is also a change of 
being, right? Now one of the suggestions I made yesterday 
was that something similar to meaning may ocur without 
us. So we could say that meaning is not just meaning for 
us, you know, but rather, meaning is already a dynamic 
activity. 
Q: In these terms, do you have an explanation of a psychic 
who ses the future? How does that fit into this model? 
Bolun: Well, I think that a psychic would not se the 
131 

Meaning and the freeing of energy 
future, but se what is a likely future. There are cases where 
they say they've sen the future, and the person behaved 
diferently - he didn't take the airplane which was going to 
crash - and therefore the future was changed, right? So 
therefore a great deal of the future may be enfolded in the 
present as a potentiality, or a likely posibility, but still be 
changeable. 
Q: rd like you to talk about meaning - the meaning of 
meaning - a little bit. There was something I found quite 
interesting that happened in our smaJI discUS!iion group 
yesterday. We were talking about the meaning of meaning, 
and actually getting rather bogged down with fragmentary 
thought. Then someone suggested that we pause and have a 
few moments of silence, which we did, and what I would 
deo;cribe as a communion occured between us, and a remng 
of thought. Well, something else began to happen when 
someone spoke spontaneously. It was as if there was a rise in 
the energy level, and a clarity of perception arose, and some 
more true creative thin1cing began to happen. It semed to 
me that this would have something to do with the energy 
that flows between people, of the nature of friendship one 
might call it, or some space to allow some intuition, some 
perception, to come into the picture to dmolve old programs 
perhaps. I wondered if there was more you could say about 
the meaning of meaning, and the relation of these points on 
your triangle - how they afect each other, and how they 
work together, and how they, in our relationships with each 
other, how they might be applicable. 
Bohm: Wel, as I said, meaning organizes energy and may 
organize energy into matter, and meaning may arouse 
energy, right? I think you have to say that these are like three 
diferent aspects of one whole, that they're merely abstracted 
in thought. When we are caught in thought then we have 
something like a kind of matter going on which has to be 
disolved into energy. So seing the meaning of that may help 
disolve it. 
132 

Friendship, definitions and energy 
Q: In our discusion yesterday evening we acknowledged 
that friendship had a place that somehow was beyond time, 
so that next time you meet, the friendship still exists. And 
that that had a part to play in the dialogue and with 
meaning. Friendship doe5n't seem a very scientific term to be 
dealing with. I wonder if you could place that in 
a . . . (laughter) 
Bohm: Well, it's hard to put that . . .  I mean, if people are 
working together and have a sense of trust and get to know 
each other, something emerges in their whole relationship so 
that they can enter this friendship. It can come into activity 
when they meet, right? But it is always there as a kind of 
enfolded potential. 
Q: Would you define energy for me, please? 
Bohm: Well, you se, I think these are very basic terms, 
like meaning, that are very difficult to define. You see, in 
physics, energy is defined as the capacity to do work; but 
then, what is work? If you look in a dictionary you will 
always find words defined in terms of other words, and 
those in terms of other words, and eventually some of the 
original words will come back if you follow it, so that you 
don't really get a definition in the dictionary, right? But 
what happens is, as you explore and unfold these 
meanings, you begin to perceive what it means. Energy is 
this power, this movement, which acts, right? Now it has 
to be given a direction, and meaning does that - a form 
- but meaning may also arouse energy. You se, energy 
may be in a dormant state, or in this state of moving back 
and forth and being trapped, and a new meaning, the 
perception of a new meaning, may allow that energy to be 
liberated. 
Q: That's just what I wanted, thank you. 
Q: I just felt that we haven't really finished sufficiently, if 
you can finish, with the previous two questioru of Anna 
133 

Communion, communication and community 
and Graham . Could we explore a little bit further into 
that - that friendship or communion, as Anna said. 
Could we go into how it leads on into this notion of 
community, which I feel is very relevant. 
Bohm: Well, based on a certain llinOunt of trust in 
working together, you establish a relatioruhip in which 
each person enfolds the other. There's a flow back and 
forth. And now what's crucial for community is free 
communication. That is, whatever happens has to be 
communicated. Through communication people come to 
one mind; that is, to one meaning, right? You se, if we 
all have different meanings, if the situation means 
something different to each of us, then we are not going to 
be able to work together. So even with the bes, they have 
a common meaning to the dance. So to establish a 
community, we mwt have easy and &ee communication 
without blocks. These blocks come from the program . 
Q: One thing that we did bring out that could probably 
bear further consideration, was the fact that we avoid the 
experience of mental pain by not being in the present 
moment. And that being in the present moment is the only 
place in which this creative act of change can happen; it 
can't happen in an imaginary past or an imaginary future. 
But to avoid that, to avoid facing that, we kind of fudge 
the isue a little bit. And we were linking this in with the 
necesity for this safer atmosphere where there is 
friendship, for this to be able to happen. 
Bohm: Yes. We were disct.Wing in one of the groups 
yesterday that we find that certain questions are very 
painful to face. Now thought is constantly trying to find 
ways of escaping, of avoiding the question. Thought is 
programmmed to try to do this and to conceal what it is 
doing, right? 
Q: Do you se it as p<mible to get out of those grooves, 
and actualy program one's thought to be a partner in 
134 

Programs 
que.stioning relevant questioru? 
Bohm: Would it be ×ible to have this come from a 
program? 
Q: Probably not. The program become.s increasingly 
irrelevant if there's a new meaning constantly emerging in 
each moment. I'm not even sure what the point of a program 
would be, if everyone shared that meaning. 
Q: A self-de.structive program . 
Q: Wel, it just wouldn't be needed, because there wouldn't 
be a past. 
Q: But some programs, like knowing how to drive a car, 
or the sub-conscious program that keeps the heart 
beating . . .  
Q :  Right, right. There are some subconscious proceses. 
Q: We wouldn't want to throw that out. 
Q: No. I mean, those are vital. It's just the one.s that take 
over the role of corucious creativity, that conceal themselve.s 
as creativity or spontaneity, when in fact . . .  
Q :  How in fact do we know which is which? 
Q: Well, this is why friendship is here. 
Bohm: Now we were discusing last night that people 
talking together might discover that a person had some 
problem, a block which might be painful, right? Now in 
the pre.sence of pain, thought is programmed to constantly 
bring in thoughts that would be more comforting or 
pleasant; but they may be illusory; they usualy are. Now 
the.se usualy concern thoughts of the future when there 
will be les pain, or else the past when there was les pain, 
135 

The relevance of blocks 
or what might be. Therefore we were constantly slipping 
into the past or the future. but both were really the past. 
right? And therefore we were not looking at the actual 
present. 
Q: I would have thought too, that blocking - this 
blocking proces - may appear to disrupt progrĀ, but 
may alow progres to be made. In other words, you have 
a recovery time given to you, perhaps where you recognize 
it. which enables the brain to sort out the thinking proces. 
Probably the blockage is important, provided you are 
determined to solve the problem. I'm thinking of 
negotiations in industry, where you know there is 
something very serious going on and your task is to solve 
it. Provided you know that, and the blockages ocur, and 
you know they are bound to ocur, this could be a very 
good way that the brain has of giving you a recovery 
period. 
Bohm : In some cases that could be so. But you se. many 
blocks continue indefinitely; we are not conscious of them. 
You se, in general there is an attempt to avoid 
consciousnes of the block which is painful. right? 
Q: Yes, but in real negotiations you have got to own that. 
otherwise you don't make ,progres.s. It may take a long 
time, but the mere fact that the problems are posed, in the 
end gives people a chance to find solutions. 
Bohm: Yes. Wel, I think if it comes to negotiations over 
actual problems that thought can handle, then that is 
alright. Now the question is whether thought can handle 
the kind of blocks that ocurs in psychological problems. 
Q: I would say in that situation, the lengthier time just 
indicates that there i'i more time being spent trying to 
avoid the blocb; the blocb try to hide themselves, and 
you're trying to get them out again. If you go straight to 
the heart of the problem then the block has no function. 
136 

or the block is bypased completely. 
Bolun: How do you do that? 
Blocks and friendship 
Q: I don't know. But I'm contesting the idea that a block 
can be useful as a resting period. Ideally, it should be just 
simply bypæ. 
Bolun: Yes, well I think that if you are doing something 
practical, you may hold back to give time to sort thinç 
out. That's what the gentleman was saying. 
Q: That's right. Yes. Because what we could say, David, 
was if somehow you've established a rapport, there is this 
kind of friendship which will protect you as you go along. 
And therefore hopefully the solutions wil emerge in spite 
of the blockages. Thus in time you can go back to the 
blockage and approach it from a more intelligent angle. 
Q: Isn't the problem here though. that the roots of the 
blockages are not at a level which can be discerned by 
conscious thought - that they are in subtler levels? And 
this is where the friendship that Graham brought out starts 
to penetrate into the implicate order where it's subtler 
than something that can be discerned and discUMed by 
saying, 'Well, I think your block is around this area, and 
my block is here.' Because actualy it's at a much subtler 
level that there may be some freeing of those blocks. 
Bolun: Yes. I think that friendship can do that. 
Q: This is important. That relationship is important. 
Bolun: Now the question arises that sometimes you have to 
stand alone and deal with this. 
Q: Would it be the truth, if one is having to stand alone, 
which I suppose ultimately we need to do, that the block, 
the awarenes of a program, becomes clear when we 
137 

Dealing with blocks 
bump into the wall, when reality kicb us back? That says, 
'Ah, yes. Change is required.' So in a way, aren't we 
talking about the need for changes - the shifts - the 
changeo; in meaning which you say involve changes in 
being, or changeo; in being which involve changeo; in 
meaning? That in a way, there is a need for constant 
change in meaning, or constant availability to change? 
The image that keeps sticking in my mind is a clear image 
that fadeo; into fuzzines around its edgeo;, 3."i opposed to 
the needs of a program which demand very precise frameo; 
within which to work. And I don't know quite where 
that's leading me, other than that it's an image of flow 
and flexibility, as it were, in one's state of consciousnes. 
Bohm: Yes. Well, what we were suggesting last night was 
that when it comeo; to some really deep problems, there is 
this continual tendency to ýape. You see, there may be 
fear behind it, right? Now any intense pain or fear distorts 
the reaction of thought. 
Q: You spoke about our wanting to liberate this deo;ire to 
avoid the is.sue, and you suþed that in sticking with it 
and not doing whatever the program suggested we might 
do to avoid the given wue, that there might be a 
liberation, or a build-up of energy sufficient to penetrate 
to the lower, more implicate levels, and actualy free up 
what was realy there. And I just wanted to pul in what 
we were saying about communication, because we were 
talking about standing alone - that when something 
comes, I won't be deflected by my familiar thought 
patterns, and I will stand alone, and se what comes out 
of that. And sometimes a way of not standing alone is to 
communicate. And yet we were talking about 
communication and friendship. 
Q: Standing alone lets something clarify . . .  
Q :  Or alows something to intensify through 
communication, which is actualy what we are doing in 
138 

Presure, pasion and the force of necesity 
this moment. It obviously requires a certain willingnes on 
the part of each one, so the pres.sure builds. And the extent 
that the pres.sure will build is in direct proportion to the 
willingnes of each one to basically stay with it through 
whatever. And as we were saying last night, it takes 
honesty, and kind of old-fashione<l values, right? And a bit 
of pÞion. Because one begins to see that the program isn't 
simply something that has affecte<l us individually, in our 
own actions, but is basically affecting the whole. And to 
the extent that we allow ourselves to let this program that 
has ben running us disolve, we have an impact on the 
whole. 
Q: I think those two things don't really conflict for me -
that of standing alone, standing back, or the ability to get 
rid of a block by communicating with a friend or 
somebody. It's really useful to have both things available. 
Bohm: Yes. I think that whether you are alone or with a 
friend, there has to be this willingnes.s to face the pain and 
the fear, and to stay with it. Now this is where time comes 
in. The thoughts are constantly bringing in the past and 
the future, or what might have been, or what is pos.sible, 
and we se that each time that happens, we are off the 
mark, right? Now if you keep on seing that , then this 
generates the energy and pÞion neede<l to reach the 
deeper levels. 
Q: So is that the force of nӨity that you were tallcing 
about, where you get so fragile that you may fragment, or 
you get that desperate need of the creative urge to either rise 
above it or beyond it, or you just disintegrate? It's like one 
way or the other. Is that the force of nӧity? 
Bohm: Yes. Well you se, necesity is a meaning. It means 
it cannot be otherwise, right? It doesn't yield. Now the 
force of necesity is in the block. It doesn't yield. And 
there's a force of neces.sity in the meaning of understanding 
what's happening, which starts to dWolve it. Now you se, 
139 

Humanity and healing 
that's the power of meaning. 
Q: So meaning might be something which creates a force of 
necesity, and the depth of meaning might be iwociated with 
the depth of necesity - a depth of unstoppable force to 
counter the lower depth of immovable object. (laughter) 
Q: The question I have here is: At a denser level we might 
se a program to be a program, and it might cease to have 
the sort of meaning it had because of that, and so we may 
release it. But at a finer level, into something more 
implicate, we may have a pattern of friendship which may 
be effective in the same way - may create the climate for 
that change or release to ocur. It may be that, rather 
than me seing the patterns in myself, I might se the 
patterns in others, or they might se them in me, and it 
may simply be the understanding of them that releases 
them, rather than it having to be done individually within 
oneself. This brings out this interrelationship we were 
talking about yesterday, right through humanity. It may 
be sufficient simply to realize the patterns somewhere in 
the consciousnes of humanity, rather than each person 
working through their own complexities, if you know what 
I mean. 
Bohm: Yes. Well, that's an interesting approach. If it's 
realized with sufficient energy and pasion then it may be 
able to work on somebody else, and spread. 
Q: It's the technique of healing, isn't it? 
Bohm: Is it? 
Q: In healing, one person attempts to help another, so it 
must come in the pattern that was just described, I should 
imagine. 
Q: If the holographic analogy is accurate, then each part 
contains some of the whole, and so presumably whatever 
140 

Interaction, pain and trust 
takes place in myself - a clarification - has an effect on 
the whole. And a corollary of the.t is that often I find in 
working in interaction with the world in which I dwell, I 
often can't tell if it's that person over there who is a pain, 
or something in me that is a pain. And I really don't know 
sometimes which it is. And all I can do is to allow the 
change in here. I don't really know about that person, so I 
don't know that there's any difference between them and 
me. 
Bohm: Yes. But not fundamentally though. 
Q: As a whole, in the system there is pain, and who it is, 
one doesn't know. 
Q: That's where one can get to work. 
Bohm: It's like asking is the pain in the finger or in the 
brain? 
Q: You mentioned a word a little while ago, David, which 
was 'trust' which sems to me, whatever it may precisely 
mean, is a potent word here, in industrial disputes, in 
blockages. If there isn't trust, change seems to me to be 
almost impossible. Sometimes you find with a social­
worker, when a social-worker is kind of generating care al 
around her, but she doesn't, or he doesn't somehow 
manage to generate trust, that whatever he or she has to 
offer is rejected because there is no trust. And on the 
political front, the coal-mining position at the moment, 
nothing can ever resolve it because there's no trust on 
either side. So I think this word 'trust' is a very important 
one in this matter of friendship, relationship, changing, 
accepting one another's patterns, the whole thing. Nothing 
realy happens unles there is this curious relationship that 
we cal trust. 
Q! Non-trust is an energy as well, but it doesn't work very 
well. 
141 

Trost as meaning 
Q: Destructive energy. 
Bohm: Yes. 
Q: When you've got trust, you se, you've got to give trust 
a framework to work in. If you find yourself with 
strangers, there are tactical things that go on between the 
people concerned, and if you've got a format that you 
know is going to work, or usually does work, then you've 
got a start. Very frequently we found that in the midst of 
all the turmoil, the social life was important, the going 
together to tea afterwards, the sitting down and really 
getting together as people outside the framework of the 
previous discussion, informally over the tea table, you 
know, high tea or a bottle of beer, and just talking, so that 
they understood you and you understood them. It's 
another step toward this understanding, this wholenes , 
based on trust and friendship, and in the end you got 
there. 
Q: I would like to bring in another program at this stage, 
which is the genetic program. And what excites me over 
the past ten years or so - what we have learned about the 
genetic program - is that there are lots of rearrangements 
going on even within the individual lifetime, within this 
program. So I think that comes in in connection with 
changing thought programs and changing even our genes 
in the lifetime of one individual. 
Bohm: Yes. Well, I think there are two questions. This 
question of trust should be addred. and then we'll come 
to this other one. Now I think this question of trust is a 
question also of meaning. This is seing the meaning of the 
other person as basically the same, that we all have the 
same deep intention. And this new meaning begins to 
afect the whole structure, and begins to change it. It 
changes the thought prÌ. 
Now about the genetic thing: You've celed attention to 
the fact that something similar may be going on. You are 
142 

Genes and meaning 
saying that the genetic proces changes even within the 
lifetime of an individual, right? Genes actualy change, 
whereas before it was said that they changed only at 
random, right? Now therefore the whole way of life may 
affect the genetic structure. In fact, you could say that 
thoughts are like the genes of meaning. You se, the genes 
are said to contain information, but information without 
meaning is pointles. Now meaning depends on context, 
the meaning of the gene's information, and which proteins 
are around it, and so on. But the genes may have 
indefinite potential for meaning according to the context . 
So not only does a rearranged gene have a different 
meaning in the same context, but in a change of context 
the same gene has a different meaning. Now that would 
suggest something about evolution, that something 
analogous to meaning is going on at the biological level. I 
developed this further in the part of the paper that I didn't 
give, that in terms of the computer one could get a similar 
notion that the information in the computer has a meaning 
in terms of the activities which flow out of it, or in the 
way it would sort out information coming in. If that's so, 
then even our biological evolution is going to be affected 
by what we do, right? 
Q: Is it illusory to imagine that when all the programs 
have ben disolved, there is underneath this, what is 
called the Ēnee of our being? Or is it that deep, deep 
down we are very shallow? (laughter) 
Bohm: I think that in the next hour we are going to 
discq the ego, but you are raising the question which also 
is the question raised by religicn - What is the esential 
nature of being, right? And is the ego, or what we usually 
call the ego, very shalow, or is it something deeper? Or 
are we part of this whole? 
Q: When we talk about dis<;olving the programs, there are 
just more programs to kep disolving. 
143 

Dreaming 
Bohm : But also they are continually being made. 
Q: Perhaps we pay too much attention to them , and we're 
giving them power; we're putting the power in. The better 
thing would be the aspirations, the inspiration, it's perhaps 
not manifest within us, but if we hold to that, that will be 
the better life, rather than keep on empowering our 
blocks. We don't necesarily always dissolve them. But I 
mean there are more way of dealing with a brick wall 
than knocking it down . 
Q: I would like to suggest that the intentionality to get rid 
of the block is crucial. And once we have committed 
ourself to that intent, then we can use vehicles that are 
close to us or that we have some familiarity with. For 
instance, we have all kept talking about the recognition of 
a higher intelligence within us, that is part of us. And 
many people consider that our minds continue to work at 
night, or while we're busy with tasks, so it's not far­
fetched to ask ourselves about our blocks, and ask ourselves 
to dream about our blocks. Because dreaming frequently 
comes in symbols we can tolerate, that have many levels, 
and in the proces if you can remember your dream and 
write it down literally so that you don't get into any 
judgement about your dream. At that point a trusting 
friendship is really helpful because a trusting friend can 
go over the information with you and stand off from that 
information and be able to see the context in a way that 
you may be still fearful of. And that proces can go to 
various levels, but you begin to get the skeins of 
information starting to come through to you, of what your 
block really involves. 
Bohm: Well, I think that's very valid, that as you say, the 
dream is put in terms of images or symbols, and in the 
dream these are les alarming than to state in words what 
they mean. Now the question arises: What does the dream 
mean? Now to see the meaning of the dream would then 
constitute a change in the block . I think there are various 
144 

Levels of friendship 
ways of trying to approach these blocks. They may take very 
many subtle forms, and we can't give any final version of 
how to do it. 
Q: No. Not on any of these problems. 
Q: One small point: There sems to be this view that it takes 
two to trust. What about the idea of trusting one;elf? 
Bohm : Yes. I think it is necesary to trwt yourself. And out of 
this can come the trust in other people. 
Q: I think that regarding trwt and friend.ship, that it exists at 
many levels, and our understanding of it is probably limited. 
I think we have all experienced friend.ship which is actually 
part of the block - like having cronies. I think that there are 
levels other than that, which I haven't experienced yet. But 
it's an article of faith that they exist, as it's an article of faith 
that there are shades of meaning beyond the meanings I 
already know, and more meaning which I cannot find but 
that I inherently know something about. I suppose it must lie 
as a belief that friend.ship lies at very deep levels and is 
accesible, and that this is the way ahead. It's more precise 
than what we currently know, yet there is something there 
that is perhaps going to work. But my concern is to know, to 
be available myself to those deeper levels, whatever they 
might be. 
Peter Garrett: It's close to eleven o'clock, David, to remind 
you. 
Bohm: Yes. Well, I think that if you have a feeling of 
complete opennes between each other then the meaning can 
flow, and the whole thing can work. Now I think that would 
be spontaneow generally starting with young children; but 
we have had a lot of experiences through life which have led 
to thE5e blocks - these programs - which get in the way. 
The question is: Can friendship begin to dissolve even those 
blocks? 
145 

Erploration 
Q: I'd suggest that something has ben ocurring in this room 
where I felt a kind of struggle initially for comprehension, 
and then an increasing willingnes to move from our 
habitual linear way of getting things ordered to leting a 
number of almost random thoughts unfold together to find 
out what happened, and for me anyway, that takes a lot of 
trust. I rather like to appear that I know what I'm talking 
about. (laughter) 
Bohm: We all do, right? (more laughter) Yes. I think we 
must acknowledge that we are in a domain where we don't 
really know what we are talking about. We're exploring, 
right? 
Q: Yes. 
146 

RELIGION, WHOLENESS AND THE PROBLEM 
OF FRAGMENTATION 
Bohm: Welcome. I originally pla11ned to give a talk 
entitled 'Religion as Wholenĺ and the Problem of 
Fragmentation' which I gave originally at St. James' 
Church in Piccadily, London; but when I looked at it 
again this morning I realized that my views had ben 
changing, and it was partly as a result of our discusioru 
together. I hadn't realy fully understood the implicatioru 
of my soma-significance paper in connection with this 
paper. It's rather like Newton - people hadn't understcx:l 
the significance of al the evidence showing that the 
heavenly motioru are not different from the earthly 
motioru - and suddenly Newton saw it. I don't think we 
can compare this with that, (laughter) but I began to 
wonder. It semed a certain part of it - on the ego -
would still be worth discĻing, The idea ocurred to me, 
so I went into Peter and Don when we met this morning, 
and we discഌ it and they suggested the same thing, 
that they themselve5 felt that the latter part was more 
interesting than the part on religion. 
I think this shows how friendship is working; that we 
have similar feelinļ and we are communicating them to 
each other in this situation. Another thing I would say is 
that, ei;pecially in this la.st hour, I'm not trying to be here 
as your teacher or as your authority but, rather, I too have 
blocks and fears, and so on. Therefore we are all together 
in this, and the fact that I'm on this elevated platform 
doesn't mean anything. 
I think we were di.scus.sing earlier the problem of 
fragmentation. That's one of the thinĽ in this paper. And 
we discussed the general fragmentation which has been 
going on in mankind, and building up. Now it had many 
causes that we went into. One of them was science, which 
is taking a fragmentary form and helping to produce 
fragmentation. The basic cause there, being that the 
147 

Religion as a source of fragmentation 
content of thought took itself to be in correspondence with 
a reality other than thought. Therefore the divisions in 
thought were taken to mean objective divmons in external 
reality, or in reality other than thought, and with that 
meaning, we would act accordingly and start to break 
things up into things like nations and groups, and in al 
sort'i of ways. 
Now science enouraged that greatly in its mechanistic 
development; and now religion, although its aim is 
wholenÕ . The basic feeling of religion is the yearning to 
wholenÕ. The very word 'religion' is based on religare, 
meaning to bind up, or it could be religere, which would 
mean to gather together, and the word 'holy' means 
whole, and so on. There is man's urge toward wholenes 
which expresed itself both in religion and in science. If 
you wanted to get a whole view of the universe, you could 
do it through science and philosophy, and also a whole 
view of being, through religion and philosophy. The East 
specialized in religion and philosophy, and the West was 
more science and philosophy. 
Nevertheles, religions became a major source of 
fragmentation. The reason for that is very simple, because 
you se, in the beginning - I'm not sure if al the 
primitive religions would have agreed, but more modern 
religions have agreed - that the ground of al being is 
somehow permeated with a supreme intelligence that is 
creative, and evidence for that is the tremendous order in 
the universe and in ourselves and the brain. And then, 
probably with les evidence, but it's there, this ground is 
permeated with love and compasion, although sometimes 
it doesn't sem so, seeing all the suffering in the world and 
the destruction that goes on . Now I think that if people 
would stop there, then they would say God has that 
nature, or the mystics would say that the Godhead, the 
ground of God, has that nature . Now if we would stop 
there, probably people who have religious feelings would 
not disagree. 
But now to go further, and say that God or the 
Godhead has such and such a nature creates divmons 
148 

Ego and the ground of being 
because one person, or one group, says one thing, and 
another group says another. These divisions are very 
serious, particularly serious because we are dealing with 
the nature of the absolute. Therefore there is no way to 
bridge theioe divisions, you see. It's either so or not so. 
Therefore when it comes to religion - religious differences 
- it must result in extreme fragmentation. 
Now that was some of the content of what I was going 
to say. But you can raise the question now about this 
ground in view of soma-significance, and so on, and se if 
there is an ultimate ground, and we could discus that. 
Religion, in its modern form, and probably even in the 
earlier forms, does presuppose this ultimate ground of 
being out of which all emerges or unfolds. 
Now although science and religion are self-world-views, 
they have ben important sources of fragmentation; but I 
don't think that they are the major ones. Something much 
more powerful and pervasive is the identification of self or 
ego as absolutely separate and distinct from others. What 
is relevant here is not only the individual ego, but also the 
collective ego in the form of the family, the profes.Uon, the 
nation, the political, religious ideology, and so on. 
When I talk about the ego, I want to say that the ego is 
not necesarily the whole of the self. The ego is a certain 
feature of the self which we could call the self-image. In 
the way we have ben discusing it, it get<o taken for the 
self. The word 'self has as one of its deep meaninĕ, the 
quintes.5ence, the thing itself. Fundamentally al human 
conflict<i arise out of the attempt to protect such ego 
interests, which are generally regarded as supreme, over­
riding everything else, and not open to discusion or 
rational criticism. Indeed, even the fragmentation due to 
the scientific and religious self-world-views, arises 
ultimately, because the ego, individ uallly or collectively, 
takes theioe views as the secure basis for absolute certain 
knowledge about itself. We could ask why people, in this 
absolutely unyielding way, would insist on their religious 
views, unles somehow it has to do with the security of the 
ego. On the other hand, perhaps these religious views 
149 

I am that I am 
contribute to the be.ing - to what the ego is at the time. 
Now it has ben the aim , tacit or explicit, of all religiom 
to change the ego so as to end fragmentation. Ideally, this 
would be accomplished, for example, by healing the 'sin­
sick soul', but failing this, there is an attempt, generally at 
least, to control the ego and limit its destructive effects by 
various moralities and other restrictiom. Science in the 
form of psychology is also trying to accomplish similar 
ends with psychotherapeutic techniques and with druĚ 
produced by modern chemical technology, and various 
other ways. But it's clear that neither of these ways has 
gotten very far - even in such an evident and obvious 
problem as the p<>Wbllity of the e.xt:inction of mankind that 
is implicit in our general fragmentary way of life. 
It sems to me that neither science nor religion has 
produced an answer. So it sems important then to inquire 
more deeply into why the ego is such a hard nut to crack, 
you se. (laughter) And in such an inquiry several 
questiom arue immediately: Why is the ego, individual or 
collective, so important? Why must it be comidered to be 
e.sentially correct, and always right? Why do people 
explode into violence and anger when they are insulted 
personally, or even more, when family, religion, nation, or 
ideology are treated in what they regard as an outrageous 
way? 
Well, to disct.L'i.S this adequately will require more time. 
Perhaps we can go into it. But I would like to suggest 
something relevant, drawn from the story of Moses in the 
Old Testament. In doing this I don't want to discus 
theology, or discus any knowledge, scientific or otherwise. 
Rather I hope that what I say about Moses can be 
regarded as nothing more than a story that helps give rue 
to a certain kind of insight into the ego. 
& you may recall, Moses spoke with a voice in the 
burning bush. You see, when the voice spoke to Moses, it 
said, 'I am that I am,' and when Moses asked who he 
should say sent him unto the children of Israel, the voice 
said, 'You shall say, "I am", sent you.' From this it is clear 
that the voice was saying 'I am' is the name of God. Now 
150 

Predicting I am 
you can se what this means by considering that in Moses' 
time there was still a fairly strong survival of man's 
primitive animism - a tendency to see everything as a 
manifestation of a living soul or spirit - and this view 
implies that all life is one. The spirit of each thing is 
enfolded in that of the other, as each person enfolds 
something of the spirit of others in his consciousnes. So in 
a way, everything would call itself 'I am' if it could talk. 
(laughter) 
Now a particular thing is characterized by attributing 
predicates to 'I am'. Qualities: I am here, I am a human 
being, I am strong, weak, rich, poor, and so on. If no 
predicate is attributed to 'I wn', this can only mean the 
universal spirit creating and underlying everything. And 
this is also most deeply what is meant by the word 'God'. 
So you could say that the insight of Moses is that 'I am' is 
the natural name of God, or the Godhead, becawe of its 
meaning. It points to whatever is meant. Now this implies 
that no image can be made of the universal 'I wn', as this 
would attribute predicates, you see. The ancient Hebrews, 
in fact, had strong injunctions against such images , and 
went further, saying that even the name of God was too 
sacred to be used except poS"Sibly for the most holy of 
purposes. But unfortunately as time went on, they 
attached to this name a vast range of attributes such as 
great, wonderful, magnificent, powerful, merciful. They 
began to characterize Hitn verbally, creating verbally­
based images. 
Now why is it dangerous to attribute specific qualities to 
'I am'? This is because 'I am' without predicates, already 
means the universal intelligence and energy on which all 
depends. That is, the meaning, energy, intelligence, all the 
things that we've been talking about. That is, the nwne of 
this triangle is 'I wn'. 
Q: It's intrinsic. 
Bohm: Well, we don't want to start on theology. 
(laughter) It's something that I just saw at this moment. 
151 

Limiting the unlimited 
This energy - everything - depends on it; it sweeps al 
before it. Now if you attribute this energy to any kind of 
predicate, you put a limit on what the original 'I am' 
means; it limits the meaning. The meaning, remember, is 
power; it is energy. We're putting a limit on it, but 
implicitly it still means the whole energy at the same time. 
And so we·re trying to pour the whole energy into these 
limits. It must give this limited thing tremendous 
significance and power. 
Now this is a contradicton. It bears on what is of 
supreme significance, and will have a powerful, disruptive 
effect on the mind - hence, on the brain. Disorder, and 
eventually subtle brain damage may result from this. You 
se the power of these meanings . The word 'God' is a 
rather arbitrarily chosen word. It might as well have ben 
something else; it could have been turned around the other 
way. (laughter) Well, 'dog' could have meant 'God', and 
'God' could have meant 'dog'. They are arbitrary symbols, 
right? You se, the name, 'I am', is the natural name of 
God because of its meaning. 
Now the natural name of whatever you would mean by 
whatever is fundamental. That sort of gets us across this 
little bit - this notion - that we are not looking at 
something other than ourselves on this diagram - we are 
part of it. 
Now, as I said , it's not io religion or in science that this 
disorder is most acute, but it's in man's attempt to identify 
himself. He does this by saying, 'I am X,' whatever X is. 
But as I stated earlier, whether he likes it or not, 'I am' 
signifies the universal energy, and X signifies something 
particular and limited. One can se the esence of egotism, 
individual and collective - to give the significance of the 
unlimited to the limited - and therefore you say 'number 
one comes first,' and so on. There are other sources of 
egotism, and so on, other ways of explaining it; but this 
might be regarded as a very fundamental way of looking 
at it. 
It often semed very puzling why the immediate 
interests of the ego so often sem to over-ride everything, 
152 

Egotism and the real self 
even things people indirectly regard as very precious, such 
as life, love, happines, and so on. The explanation 
implicit here is that we generally behave as if the ego 
regarded itself as the universal 'I am' beyond all limits of 
time, space and conditions. For example, if the honour of 
your nation is attacked, you may be ready to respond 
ultimately with nuclear bombs, risking the destruction of 
the planet and even the nation itself, but somehow what is 
eternally right will have ben vindicated. In other words, 
this eternal rightnes will still prevail, even though 
everything else i.s gone. (laughter) I think that's implicit in 
the thought, right? 
Now this behaviour is implied to be absolutely necesary 
when any particular predicate is identified with 'I am'. 
The meaning of absolute necesity is to sweep al before it. 
'Necesity' means don't yield; it means the object that 
doesn't yield, and it also means the force that sweeps all 
before it. So it either leads to a blockage, a rigid blockage, 
or to a force driving everything in front of it. Now it's not 
easy to change all this because it's deeply imprinted in the 
brains of four thou.sand five hundred million human 
beings. Merely to exhort people to think otherwise would 
have very little meaning. To do this would ju.st be to 
superimpose a contradictory meaning on one that is 
ancient, subtle, pervasive and deeply held. So you would 
now have several meanings fighting each other; and this 
means that the most powerful was going to prevail. This 
would therefore tend to increase fragmentary egotism 
rather than ending it . 
The chalenge is to disolve this old pattern of thought 
and perception rather than to try to contradict it, to 
control it, or to destroy it by force, or by will. Now again 
we could say that dissolving thi.s pattern is the healing of 
whatever the real self ഊ- One must say that there is a self 
Ã an individual self - but it's not the whole thing, and it 
has to be sen properly within its limits, although it may 
be far greater than we know. But still, it mu.st be limited. 
Q: I don't follow that. 
153 

Limits of the self 
Bolun: Wel you se, our real self is nothing but 'I am'. Or 
if we have an individual self and that is real, then that 
must be limited to the extent that it is real. You se, this is 
an unknown question. 
Q: Limited but not bounded, would you say? 
Bolun: Well, there are no definite bounds to it. It could 
always, you know, unfold. And it has an infinite potential, 
but in some way this is stil not the total. 
Q: But vortex-like? 
Bolun: Yes. It's enfolded in the whole perhaps. 
Q: So there are two things in parallel there - two thint 
together. One is the self - the level of 'I am' - and 
then . . . finding words is quite hard here . . .  and in the context 
of that, there is a self which isn't unbounded. And when 
one mis# that point, one applies infinite . . .  
Bohm: It may not have any boundaries but in some way it 
is limited, in the sense that it isn't the whole. Llke the 
surface of the earth has no boundari#. 
Q: It's dimensionally lഋ localized. 
Q: It's unbounded. 
Bohm: Y#. It has unbounded, infinite potential, but it's a 
different order of infinity from the whole. 
Q: But if it is reflective of the macrocosm and the 
micrOC'O.Sm, then it would not be limited the way you 
suggest. 
Bolun: It may enfold the whole. But you se, it's like the 
hologram, which enfolds the whole but in an incomplete 
way, right? So stil, the danger is to identify this with the 
154 

The problem of translation 
total 'I am' - the total meaning of the word 'I am'. 
Q: Which is something very empty. 
Bohm: Yes, but it may also be very full. You see, when we 
apply a predicate to 'I am', it limits it, right? Now in some 
way this thing is not limited; even this description will in 
some way limit it probably. Now you could say a little bit 
more. You se, this word 'I am' has an interesting 
character in Hebrew, or in the Aramaic language which 
has the same grammar and was used by Christ. In Hebrew 
it is not possible, really, to say 'I am' in any proper way. 
That is, you could say 'I here', 'this table. ' The present 
tense of the verb 'to be' is not used, right? Now in fact, in 
order to say this, the voice in the burning bush said 
'ehyeh', which means 'I will be whatever I will be', or 
'that I will be that I will be'. So 'I will be' was taken as 
the name, right? But it was translated into English as 'I 
am'. 
Now you can look at some of the statements attributed 
to Christ, like 'I am the way, the truth, and the life.' Now 
it's hard to see how they could be stated within that 
grammar. You se, if he had been stating it personally he 
would have had to say, 'I the way, the truth, the life.' 
Now if he had said 'I am', he would have had to say, 
ehyeh, and he would have been using the name of God, 
right? There is no verb 'is'. So that could equally well 
mean 'God is the way, the truth, and the life'. And 
similarly 'Before Adam was, I am,' doesn't sem to make 
serue as a personal individual, but 'Before all worlds 
ehyeh, which means God, is.' 'Before Adam was, God is.' 
The point is, that was translated into Greek as 'I am', a 
mistrarulation , probably. It could be. The same as we 
discused the mistranslation that ocurred from Greek to 
Latin of metanoia, repentance, and hamartia, which is 
mising the mark, sin. That illustrates the responsibility we 
have in doing a simple job even, like trarulation. That can 
have very great consequences in some cases - to 
mistrarulate. 
155 

The fruit of the tree of knowledge 
Q: When we talk about 'I am', I am self, the level of 'I 
am', or 'the I am', this has brought us back to our being 
on the mark or off the mark; and I have an experience of 
there being a self which is on the mark or in that 
direction, and there being something which I identify as 
the posiblility of myself, which I am filling out on­
goingly, and it seems to me . . .  What you are saying . . .  It's 
on the edge for me. 
Bohm : Yes. These two things come together in a sense that 
when we are on the mark then we are taking part in thi.!i 
whole thing, and when we're off the mark, we're 
introducing some confusion in it. It sems that being on 
the mark about 'I am' is very important in some symbolic 
way, you se. That i.!i where the trouble, perhaps of 
egotism, starts - that we go off the mark with regard to 
'I am' - we don't give it attention. 
The other day we were di5công the legend of Adam 
and Eve and saying that Adam ate of the fruit of the tree 
of knowledge, which included the knowledge of good and 
evil; and we were saying that something must be wrong 
with that. Out of knowledge came al that technical 
knowledge, and so on, but it included the knowledge of 
good and evil. Now we're saying that evil is merely the 
result of being off the mark. Therefore any distinction of 
good and evil is itself off the mark, right? And eating of 
the tre of knowledge which made such distinctions 
pmsible - applied to good and evil - was pmsibly the 
meaning of that legend. 
Q: Distinguishing without judgement doesn't necesarily 
mean fragmentation. 
Bohm: No. But in this there may be an irrelevant or 
wrong distinction, you se. It would say that good and evil 
are opposites and therefore related. Now, are being on the 
mark and off the mark opposites? 
Q: One asks for an answer which is either yes or no. So 
156 

Forgetting I am 
maybe one doesn't want an answer to that question. 
Bolun : No. But there i.s something wrong with the notion 
that they are opposites. You see, opposites imply each 
other, like hot and cold, East and West, and so on. Now 
being off the mark is not the opposite of being on the 
mark. This way of putting it with evil is somehow wrong 
structure, or wrong meaning. 
Q: It's more like a direction, or a course correction. 
Bolun: Yes. You see, we would rather say, not that there 
are two things, good and evil, but rather there is the 
question of attention which keeps you on the mark, or 
failure of attention which makes you go off. The failure of 
attention is not the opposite of attention but ifs due to the 
program. Does that seem clearr It's not intrinsically 
related to attention but it's entirely different. It's not like 
East is related to West. Now it's clearly a question here of 
meaning. You see, at this level wrong meanings can have 
tremendous consequences because meaning arouses the 
energy, or it contains the energy, gives it form and shape, 
and so on. And this wrong meaning is a very big factor in 
building, in making posible, thi.s egotism . Now we can 
ask what can be done with this egotism. We have made 
various suggestions here, such as friendship will help to 
dissolve some of it, or you can look at some of the blocks. 
The major block is looking to the past and the future. You 
see, one of the points is that this structure not only blocks 
but it conceals its origin by moving to something else like 
the past and the future, or what may be, or might be. 
Q: We have something in our language which might 
describe this. When one behaves badly, one says one 
forgets oneself; I forget who I am. And I think that 
perhaps one of the blocks is forgetfuln¼ of who I am. 
Bohm: Yes. That's important . I forget who I am, and also 
forgetting 'I am ·. (laughter) If you forget who you are then 
157 

Saying God is a bank manager 
I think you're mistaking yourself for 'I am'. But I am this 
per.;on who is a limited being, insofar as I'm being here; 
although that may be infinite. But by forgetting 
that, we're tacitly giving a value of unlimited. 
Q: The feeling that I have is that any predication of 'I am' 
is going to be false. 
Bohm: Say, even love and inteligence, right? 
Q: Right. So one has in 'I am' the indication of meaning as 
something which is implicate, and as soon as you predicate 
it, you've made it explicate, and it's false. So we have that 
problem at a very coarse level when we say, 'I am a bank 
manager'. When I'm not a bank manager anymore, I fade 
out, or whatever. (laughter) We start to attribute qualities 
beyond the natural sense of them - absolute qualities -
thinó which are unfolding and enfolding, which are 
continually changing, and therefore we get these programs 
which try to continue inappropriately. 
Bohm: Yes. 
Q: Why is that false, rather than incomplete? If I am a bank 
manager, that's not all that I am; but at least it's part of what 
I am, or it's part of the way I'm acting, let's say. Why is that 
false? 
Q: Only because the term 'I am' signifies an everlasting 
absolutenô of the entire implicate which is beyond 
conception. And to identify that as a bank 
manager . . .  (laughter) 
Bohm: One of the things we fail to notice - or forget -
which the story of Moses implies, is that 'I am' already has a 
meaning which is deep and pervasive, and we can't control 
it. And therefore when you add 'bank manager', then that 
meaning of 'I am' is attached to 'bank manager'. You se, it 
gives power; it says the same as to say God is a bank 
158 

Something about God 
manager. (laughter) 
Q: It be.comes reasonable if we keep repeating it, of 
course. 
Q: There is also a point - 'I am not a bank manager', is also 
equally wrong. 
Bohm: Well, you could say 'Cod is not a bank manager,' 
which is sort of irrelevant. Cod is not chocolate, He is not 
cheese, and so on. (laughter) 
Q: You know, in Italy there is the Bank of the Holy Spirit. 
Bohm: Yes. I once made a joke to a fellow that you put your 
money in down here, and you draw it out up there. 
(laughter) He was a fairly devout Christian, and it took him 
some time to appreciate it. 
Q: Nevertheles, in trying to raise some understanding of our 
relationship with God and some understanding of God, can 
it be useful to try and get some ideas of Cod within our own 
frame of consciousnes and our own frame of reference, so 
that perhaps we can get a perspective of energy, or 
whatever, recognizing that it's terribly limited, but telling us 
something about Cod, and perhaps more than we knew 
before? 
Bohm: Well, that's just the question we're raising. I don't 
want to give an answer to that because I don't know. But you 
se, we're exploring this question. Now it was implicit in 
what Mose> said that any qualities attributed to 'I am' would 
be superfluous, right? Although they did do it. And it's also 
implicit in the notion of meaning. You se, the question is: 
Can we do this consistently , and say Cod is this, that or the 
other? Peter has just objected to my proposal that God is 
permeated with intelligence and love. Do you want to come 
in on that? 
159 

The problem of description 
Q: Saying He's permeated with . . .  
Bolun: Or He is that, whatever you like. 
Q: . . .  is different from saying, He is that. 
Bolun: I'm trying to get the language so as to avoid this 
problem, but still let's ask, is there any objection to that? 
Q: This is not quite an answer to that question, but it's an 
offshoot of it. It ocurs to me that in that ground of being, 
permeated with these attributes - at this stage I'm not even 
addresing whether they're predicated or not - we may 
experience love and compasion and intelligence, but when 
we think about them we think about our thoughts of what 
love and compasion and intelligence are, and we expect that 
all·pervasive love and compasion and intelligence to look 
like my personal picture of what they are. 
Bohm: Y e.s. That's one of the problems, I think, of giving 
attributes to the unlimited. 
Q: You se, if your proposal that God is intelligence and love 
somehow implie.s that therefore He will act this way, that 
way and the other way then, I think that's a mistake. 
Bohm: Yes. But if it implies nothing then ifs not realy doing 
anything. (laughter) It's a red herring. It's confusing the is.sue 
to give names as if you are implying something, and it turns 
out that you are implying nothing. 
Q: And yet friendship implies nothing and opens things up. 
Bohm: Yes, Alright. But then that implies something - it 
implie.s that these qualities will help open thing1 up. 
Q: But if you look at God in terms of love - being pure love, 
or complete love - and we are les.s than pure love, and les.s 
than complete love, then we can get some sort of notions of 
160 

Exploring the difjiculty 
relationships. And perhaps even behaviour. 
Bohm: Yes. I would like pople to answer that, because I 
don't want to make this just between the two of us. 
Q: Haven't you got to do that? Because you can't just not 
say anything about God. Otherwise, al you're saying is, 
God is 'I am' and 'I am' is God, and you haven't said 
anything. 
Q: You always sem to be attributing God as a person, 
separately. The Christ mêage is that He is the totality -
al its manifestations and infinite variety of phenomena 
that we kep talking about. But this trying to pin it down 
is the wrong question; it's just the acceptance, and we are 
part of it. 
Q: There's a paradox, or a tautology, I suppose. We say 
God is love, and what we mean by love is what we mean 
by God, and so actualy we're not saying anything. So 
realizjng that, we then feel compeled to start predicating 
this idea of whatever the ultimate ground of being is, and 
in the prӦ losing it, and that sems to lead us to the 
point of. . .  well, relying on, or looking to, the authority of 
personal experience as the only way out, which then starts 
equating personal experience with al that is, and can't 
help but cause a kind of fragmentation because it doesn't 
sem to be in the realm of available thought or anything 
else to griup on to. 
Q: It just ocured to me that we've talked together a lot 
about using these words to predicate - or as attributes -
but we've talked about words being used as metaphor. 
Bohm: Yes. 
Q: But perhaps that would be another way of looking at 
it. 
161 

Looking for language 
Bohm: But then every metaphor is limited in some way, 
rightr 
Q: Yes, I agree with that and I think what we are doing 
is looking for language. We have really not a very good 
language for metaphysics here. And I think perhaps we've 
two different things we could be looking at - the 
structure of the universe in, I suppose, scientific terms, and 
then I think perhaps what I'm doing right now is looking 
at the meaning of the meaning. In other words, the 
language that I would use when I'm trying to find my 
meaning in whatever I do is saying 'Right, God is a useful 
meaning for me, a useful concept,' and I put that in terms 
of love as being the wholenð - a word for the 
wholenes. So when I get into these states of confusion or 
depresion or whatever, instead of thinking that the 
depresion, the unhappines, the fear, is actually all there 
is - and it often sems like that in a fragmented moment 
- I can then trust that my meaning in life is what I 
would term love; and that soner or later that meaning 
would come through and I would haul myself out of the 
depresion, or whatever it was. That anchor of God, the 
meaning of that, would be love, and that would be the 
language I'd be using. 
Q: I se a danger. It's not an absolute nñity, but I do 
se danger in the idea of God being love. Then my limited 
concept of love asociates it with such things as happines, 
joy, no pain, this kind of thing. Now I run a danger of 
going straight back into duality by saying 'Well look, 
there are places and experiences which are painful, which 
are torturous, which are hurtful, therefore there is evil as 
well as God.' 
Q: Going back to the idea of language that John was 
putting forward, suppose hypothetically that you have two 
people who have had some experience in direct intuition of 
the supreme spirit, the supreme name of God; so they're 
talking and one says, 'Ah, it's beautiful.' The other says, 
162 

Exploring communication 
'Yeah, it's beautiful.' Now somebody e1se hean them 
speaking who hasn't had that experience, and he'll say 
they're limiting Cod; but actually because they both have 
a common experience, they trust each other. They "have to 
e.xpres.s because it's natural. If you have a very profound 
experience or realization you have to expres it; and here 
you have two people who have a mutual trust that there is 
a real experience behind the expresion, and they know 
that they're e.ach only giving a minute fragment, but stil 
it's a meaningful exchange. But to somebody who doesn't 
have that experience it's going to sem completely 
inadequate. 
Bohm: Yes. That's where the trouble is. The communication 
is limited to people who share certain experiences. If you 
want to establish and bring about wholenes, we must 
communicate in some other way. You se, the community is 
communication, and we must be accurate in our 
communication, and not miss the mark, right? This mising 
the mark in the translation of the Bible has probably 
introduced tremendous confusion and error and 
destructivenes in our lives. 
Q: Excuse me. You are also allowing yourself some 
latitude. For example, you say we don't want to talk about 
meaning; we're going to let it unfold; so similarly, if we 
are talking about the total qualities of the whole, we could 
equally say let's not try to define precisely but let it 
unfold. 
Bohm: Yes, but when we want to talk about it we have got to 
say something. Now when the voice in the burning bush said 
'I am that I am; it did not say 'I a.m love, I am truth.' 
Al though later, Chrut perhaps said that - that is, to start 
developing the meaning. But the primary meaning is, 'That I 
am, is what I am.' Or it could be translated as 'I a.m 
whatever I a.m; but that's probably not quite so good as to 
say 'What I am is that I am' - in other worm 'That I am is 
al.' 
163 

God or reality 
Q: This is really why I was looking at the meaning of the 
words and saying, well OK, if I accepted that as the 
meaning - 'I am that I am' - I may be confused with my 
depresive states or fearful states but I believe reality is love, 
unification and all that sort of stuff. 
Q: You see, this emphasis on love still worries me because I 
would have thought that love came into planetary existence 
with man. If you go back two million years, or maybe two 
and a half million years, when you looked around the planet 
as we imagine it was - and it may be approximately 
something like the scientific picture - I think you would 
find it hard to say that this creation is the outcome of love 
and compasion. Blake said that love came with man. He 
said it poetically, but I would have thought that there was a 
case to suggest that love did, as it were, unfold with man and 
self-consciousnes. Before then it's a creation all right; it's a 
fizing, bubbling creation but I can't se much sign of love 
and compòion in it. 
Q: Love has been defined as the urge in separated parts to re­
unite. So the electron that has split off &om the atom wants 
to come back. It's the same proces at that level of 
cordination as would appear in the form of love between 
human beings at the human level of development. The 
inference is the flow of affinity which is the useful element at 
the heart of reality, which I think is very safe for 
development. It looks like love; that's one thing. But why are 
we speaking about God at all now, if we are speaking about 
reality? Because the God concept is only one way of pointing 
to reality. So why don't we talk about reality, and work our 
way &om there? 
Q: I second that motion . 
Bohm: Yes. The reason we are talking about God is that 
people have talked about Him. It's part of the meaning of 'I 
am'. 'I am' has now ben attached to the particular, and that 
is really the reality. 
164 

God as a program 
Q: We can discô it as a program . We must become free 
from that. 
Bohm : Yes. The difficulty is, does everybody regard it as a 
program? 
Q: Probably most people would take the idea, the concept, 
as a program, as opposed to God as the complete self. That's 
not the right words, but what I'm trying to do is separate the 
concept of God from the idea of God itself. Does that make 
sense? 
Q: Is the question you are asking: Does everyone see God as a 
program? 
Bohm: Yes, You se, if we are going to communicate we have 
got to look at it together, right? You se, I'm not trying to 
propose answers here, but rather we have got to have 
communion. 
Q: I feel that a predicated God, in some way a 
particularized form , must be a program. That's the way I 
perceive it. But I feel that the impulse behind it is 
something which isn't of the nature of a program. 
Whether one uses the phrase 'I am', or the word 'Goo', it 
sems to be the emergence of something into explicate 
form. It sems to be something of a much finer and subtler 
nature emerging, which we interfere with by making it 
into a program and defining it. It still symbolizes 
something else to me. 
Bohm: It symbolizes a kind of creative explosion of energy, 
almost. 
Q: Even the activation of energy in some way. 
Q: I think the Jews had the right idea when the forbade the 
use of the name of God. (laughter) 
165 

The ground of all being 
Bohm: But they stil did it indirectly. 
Q: Could I come back ju.st for a second to something we 
disctLഉ yesterday, which was the idea that, at least from 
the point of view of quantum thoory, there is no bottom 
line to reality. That would imply to me - I don't know 
whether this is a correct asumption or not - but that 
there is also no ceiling. Which means that the idea of a 
ground of al being as something that we can grasp or sink 
our teeth into, or use as a limiting concept, really is a 
mistaken notion. 
Bohm: Yes. You se, this is what made me change this 
paper, because I di.scus.sed it originally in terms of mind 
and matter emerging from that kind of ground. Then I 
saw that yesterday we had discqed the soma-significance 
in which mind and matter just interpenetrate. So you can 
raise this question: Do we need this ground of all being? 
And that would be a very radical question, because it puts 
a very hard test on friendship, you see. (laughter) Which is 
more powerful, the friendship or the belief? We have to 
entertain this question. 
Q: We have to di.scus.s this because there is so much we 
don't know. And it's really nice to be able to trust this not 
knowing. 
Bohm: Yes. I would say that we don't really know what's 
behind this, but what I want to call attention to is that 
these words with their meanings produce knowable effects. 
You se, we call attention to that. That is signa-somatic. 
Q: We can have an insight into our intention in what we 
are doing, from what we are actualy doing. 
Bohm: And you can se that it shows the power of the ego 
being defined in that way. In a way, you could say that the 
ego tends to be identified with anything that is called or 
regarded as absolute. You se, the minute you think of the 
1 66 

The absolute and the ego'$ limits 
absolute, which has an unlimited signa-somatic power - the 
me.aning of the absolute is unlimited, nothing stands before 
it, right? - the proces of mind and body enacts this 
unlimited power within as the meaning. Acts it out. That 
power going on inside is then recognized by further thought 
as something extremely powerful but is not recognized as 
thought. You se there has ben a failure of attention. Any 
power of that kind wil interfere with attention. To release 
that much energy overloads the system; the blood pres.sure 
goes wrong, the chemicals go wrong, and so on. Therefore, in 
that inattention, the thought proces attributes that enacted 
power of the unlimited to a being inside caled 'me'. Becawe 
that would be the natural place where you would think that 
I am, right? Therefore you could say that the thought of the 
absolute wil tend to create the thought of the ego if there is 
not absolute attention, whatever that would be. But whether 
such attention is even possible, is a question. 
Q: I was thinking of an analogy. It's a little bit like living in a 
round room. Living in a round room is quite disturbing, 
becawe it doesn't have lines and corners that we usualy have 
to limit our thoughts. And maybe the ego is something like 
that, in that we have to put down boundaries to identify 
ourself, and to stop ourselves from just spreading out into the 
universe, and leting our mind . . .  
Bohm: Well, if the ego were acknowledged to be limited 
then it might serve a weful function. You se, we identify 
our self with the body and we say that our boundary is at 
the skin; but there's the well known example of a blind man 
tapping with a stick. If he holds the stick tightly, he feels that 
he ends at the end of the stick. If he holds it loosely, he ends 
at his fingers. You may regard the ego as in the head, or it 
may be that looking at your arm you don't se it as part of the 
ego, or you might identify the ego with a larger group and 
extend the boundaries. So the ego is a very ambiguous thing. 
It depends on what it means. 
Q: Yes. Outside of that, if you cut off your leg, then 
167 

Defining ego 
extend that further and further, and cut off your arm as 
wel, and so on, would you stil be here? 
Bohm: Yes. Well, at some stage . . .  (laughter) That 
emphasizes that the ego is defined by the meaning, which 
is ambiguous. Now it can be weful to identify the ego, up 
to a point, becawe every person has his own interests. 
Q: What about James' definition, yesterday. He said it was 
really the spearhead. James, do you want to give your 
definition? 
Q: I was giving the psychological description of the ego, 
which is the system which is built up by the mind to de.al 
with the immediate environment. It's the sort of thrusting 
forward point that Jung pointed out. Ego is really one of the 
functions of mind, and the important thing is the self, which 
is the totality of the functions of mind - if we dare use such 
a word. But the ego is the instrument by which the unique 
individual, with his own bundle of eventualities, establishes 
him or herself within the environment. 
Q: Can I enter in this? In any communication, a person, 
any person, could speak using the 'I' as coming from their 
archetypal self or their true es5ence, Or they could be 
coming from their limited self or ego. So every time any of 
us communicates to any other person using T, it leaves a 
sort of question mark about where they are coming from. 
In true communication it would always come from their 
true es5ence. But forgetfulnes is continually ocuring, and 
most of us, or some of us, speaking for myself, come from 
the ego, and that is mising the mark. So in a sense al 
egoic communication i.s les than real, les than true. 
Q: I find there is some distinction between communion 
and communication, because in a deeper level there isn't 
the need for communication as much as there is the 
awarenes of communion. 
168 

The particular and tM universal 
Bohm: Yes. That is a more fundamental . . .  
Q :  Are we not just as much defined by saying what we are 
not, as by saying what we are? One of the things we are 
programmed to say is we are not God, or we are not 'I 
am'. Therefore that in itself is a restriction. Therefore 
because we say we are not something, we have to say we 
are something else, and that causes . . .  
Bohm: That complicates. But you se, also the very language 
says I am this. The meaning is there without our saying it, 
because it has ben there so long in the human condition. 
Now you attempt to oppose that by saying 'I am not God.' 
But the notion that 'I am' is God is also implicit. 
Q: But man as God on earth is particularly important in 
realizing what our lives on this planet are about. If we 
discard the ego, universali.ring man to the extent that he is 
becoming a dimension of 'I am that I am', which is the force 
that we are representing, we deny the particular and then 
the very reason for our being here would cease to be. 
Bohm: Yes. Well, we don't want to deny the particular, 
but we want to se that in some way there sems to be a 
danger in giving the value of the universal to the 
particular. In some way it may be correct. In some way 
the particular is an expresion of the universal - an 
unfoldment - but the function of the program tends to 
malce the particular the centre of everything, as if it were 
the universal 'I am'. You se, I think that's the danger. 
That is what I say is the source of egotism. Now it's a very 
delicate question because we don't want to wipe out the 
particular in trying to deal with this. 
Q: The distinction between ego and egotism, I suppose, is 
quite clear to everyone. I think it is very important for this 
discusion. Ego is along the lines that Jam es described it, 
which is the functional organization of the conscious part of 
one's world. Egotism is the identification of one's consciously 
169 

Disolving rat"her than resolving 
accepted images and interests with the whole - that this is 
the paramount thing, and everything else should be 
subordinated to it. That distinction should be perfectly clear, 
so we can have this particular form of ego without giving 
in to the inflation and identification that oomes through 
egotism. 
Q: The ego says 'I am here.' Egotism says 'I am right.' 
(laughter) 
Q: And incidentally, speaking of Moses, idolatry was the 
greatest sin. Idolatry, sen as a principle, sems crazy. 
Identification of the whole with a particular part - you 
take a bull or an object and you worship it as if it is God 
- but it isn't the whole. This is the greatest sin. This is 
fragmentation. 
Q: PO&"libly the central problem of religion as a means of 
enoompasnng the whole, and the urge of the ego to be 
egotistical, oomes &om a pure perceptual fact. That is, I sit 
here in the centre of the universe of my perception. 
Everything surounds me and therefore I come to think of 
everything as relating to me in the centre of my perceptual 
field. And religion somehow was contrived to 
counterbalance that. And so in fact, what's happened is that 
there is a temion that is never quite resolved between these 
two. But what strikes me is this word 'communion' which 
keeps coming up. Because once there is a communion, a real 
blending I suppose between two people, or a fusion of 
consciousnes, the centre of that ego, the centre of that 
univeDe, moves &om somewhere imide my skin to a new 
space between me and thme who I'm in communion with. 
And the problem begins to soften, posnbly. 
Bohm: Yes. I think that what I was trying to say here is 
that we have got to se if we can disolve this problem 
rather than resolve it. 
Q: I'm just remembering that you spoke about everything 
1 70 

Creating sub-wholes 
having meaning - the table, for instance - but that we've 
identified ourselves as the only objec which have this 
proces of folding down from deeper levels of meaning, and 
folding back with soma-significant and signa-somatic, and 
in being conscious. It's almost as though the table has no 
problem with that - with having meaning. And in our 
consciousnes, in my consciousnes, I've become self­
conscious; I mean self-conscious in the small sense of my 
meaning. And we've got this tool of thought - I don't 
know what we're meant to use it for - but this tool of 
thought which I apply in the wrong place. So I try with 
my though to delve down into the depths of this well of 
meaning where it's perhaps inappropriate. 
Q: Shouldn't one trust the meaning of the whole to move 
through a part and trust in being in the present moment? I 
don't know; I can't see it any other way. 
Q: It's like I'm a predicating creature in some ways. It's a 
question of which way the attention is. If I'm going to 
predicate 'I am', then my attention is the wrong way. But the 
'I am' wil be predicated through me. It means I'm creating; 
there's nothing I can do to stop creating sub-wholes, and that 
is OK as long as my identification isn't in those sub-wholes. I 
have a responsibility for them, for the thing$ I make 
manifest. But the 'I am' is not something I am trying to 
predicate. It will be predicated through me, and that then 
becomes my friend, my home, and so ifs a question of where 
I'm looking. I accept that the way I think and act, in some 
way is meaning, and I wil be either at a coarse or a subtle 
level depending on my relationship with the 'I am'. And as 
long as I accept that, I am going to create sub-wholes, but I 
don't want to treat that as me. 
Q: In a way it's very simple. Our perspective should be 
wholenes. 
Bohm : Yes. 
1 71 

Inquiring further 
Q: The intention is wholenes but we have to live as 
particulars. 
Bohm: Yes. Well, we have to bring this al together. Now I 
think we could say that we are me.nifest:ations of the 
universal - each one of us - and we have to come in 
contact with this so that we can raise the question of 
whether we can combine the scientific and religious attitudes 
by beginning to inquire, not on the ham of knowledge, but 
by raising the question: Can wholenes be the subject of a 
free and unbiù inquiry? Right? Which is both the interest 
of religion and science. We have to inquire. For example, we 
discused that there may be a universal energy pervaded with 
inteligence and love which is the ground of everything -
without belief and without disbelief. What I suggested was 
that saying the nB.Ile of 'I am· signified this universal energy. 
Now is it p<>.mble for a human being, or a group of human 
beings, to actualy come in contact with this universal energy, 
or be aware of that contact? Now this realy is the question. 
If this is realy pamble then the egotism should go, right? I 
think this is realy what religions are aiming for, and we have 
ben discus.sing whether particular ways of putting religion 
would help or not. But I think that this is a very serious 
inquiry, and that we can't really settle the wues like that. 
But it's part of the evolution of human consciousnes. That is, 
for example, the notion of God was originaly rather limited, 
then came the notion of this universal God; but perhaps this 
notion has to develop or evolve further by inquiry. 
Q: But the problem of inquiry into the whole is that you 
cannot conceptualize it. 
Bohm: No. You can't. 
Q: That would lead into paradox, and it does lead into 
paradox. 
Bohm: Yes. The inquiry is whether it wil lead to the 
dance of the soma-significance . . . 
1 72 

Friendship beyond concept 
Q: That is critical, yes. 
Bohm: . . .  which bring.s it to the whole. 
Q: I'd like to add here that conceptue.lization might be only 
a means for us to get in touch with the whole, the 
universality. We can experience it with the whole of our 
being and not simply with our brain. And es we yield to our 
own nature more fuly, we become aware of sensitivities 
which can make diroct experience with the w hole energy and 
proces that is working through us. And through that we 
have more and more experience of the whole which 
encompa.ses. So conceptualization is a very por, small part. 
Bohm: Yes. I would only say that conceptue.lization has had 
a very big efect, which we have to give our attention to. 
Now you se, I think it's important that we should not in this 
inquiry define the situation so much as to disrupt the 
friendship. We have got to say that different people are 
approaching this in different ways, and each of us has got to 
respect the way that the other is approaching it, you se, 
because one may say that it's helpful to attribute qualities to 
God, which are limited, and that it helps as a metaphor, and 
others may say that it's not. Now I think that we begin by 
respecting each other's approach. In the spirit of friendship, 
we can then tum to the basic question - somehow we have 
got to come in contact with this beyond concept - of this 
universal energy, with our whole being. 
You se, I have the feeling that when we started to de.fine 
thin9 too much, it was already beginning to disrupt, right? 
So in other words, that very proces.s that I was talking about 
was beginning to happen. (laughter) Now that's not what we 
want, right? We don't realy know the answer. There may 
be no answer. But it's realy how this exprESES itself in life. 
The question of the nature of ·1 am' is really a crucial 
question, what it means in the whole of life. That's really the 
point to keep in mind. 
Now we have this distinction of egotism and self, and the 
danger that this universal energy will be attached to the ego 
1 73 

Something more important 
and give it that meaning. I think that that really is the only 
final point that I would want to make. People, in different 
ways, are trying to approach this differently, and we have 
got to respect each other. There are those who don't want 
to give qualities to God, or those who don't even want to 
say there is God, and there are those who do. Now this 
would be an example of working together despite those 
differences, because we realize that there is something 
more important than that. 
Q: Hurrah! (laughter) 
Bohm: But we want to notice that this question has had a 
powerful effect on human development, and how delicate 
it is. 
Q: I would like to realy exprĄ my deep appreciation for 
what you offered in these three days. There really has ben a 
deepening friendship, not only with you, but between al of 
us. So I know that I'm beginning to appreciate even more 
the unique qualities in each person, and how their proceses 
have ben quite dominant in certain aspects, and how they 
brought to point certain things that in me weren't as 
dominant. I could say it complemented and enriched my 
own experience because of that. And I think it's ben a 
beautiful unfolding of life. (applause) 
Bohm: I wanted to say more or les the same thing. 
(laughter) I've really learned a great deal here. A5 you see, 
I had to give up my talk. (laughter) And I can see that 
putting it in certain ways can have a disruptive effect, you 
se, and I think we can learn from that, and that really 
there is something much more real than all these questions, 
and that is the actual way we are related, and what pąes 
between us. And we must not alow such questions to 
break things up; but we've got to realize how they do 
because that's part of the state of the world, right?

REMARKS ON THE PROCESS OF DIALOGUE 
As mentioned in the introduction, the weekend began with 
the expectation that there would be a series of lectures and 
informative 
discćioru 
with 
emphasis 
on content. 
It 
gradualy emerged that something more important was 
actually involved - the awakening of the prÌ of dialogue 
itself as a free flow of meaning among all the participants. In 
the beginning, people were exprĈing fixed positioru, which 
they were tending to defend, but later it became clear that to 
maintain the feeling of frienwhip in the group was much 
more important than to hold any position. Such friendship 
has an impersonal quality in the serue that its establishment 
does not depend on a close personal relationship between 
participants. A new kind of mind thus begiru to come into 
being which is based on the development of a common 
meaning that is constantly transforming in the prĉ of the 
dialogue. People are no longer primarily in opposition, nor 
can they 
be 
said 
to be interacting, 
rather they are 
participating in this pool of common meaning which is 
capable of constant development and change. In this 
development the group has no pre-established purpose, 
though at each moment a purpose that is free to change may 
reveal itself. The group thus begins to engage in a new 
dynamic relationship in which no speaker is excluded, and in 
which no particular content is excluded. Thus far we have 
only begun to explore the possibilities of dialogue in the sense 
indicated here, but going further along these lines would 
open up the possibility of transforming not only the 
relatioruhip between people, but even more, the very nature 
of consciousnes in which these relationships arise.
