About the Author
Owen Dell got his fi rst serious exposure to landscaping in San Francisco’s 
Golden Gate Park, where he spent his childhood afternoons gamboling about 
instead of doing his homework. After a brief career in electronics, which 
taught him where his affections really lay, he turned to horticulture. Two 
charismatic college botany professors opened his eyes to the wonders of 
nature. Class fi eld trips made it clear that the gap between the way nature 
handled landscaping and the way people did was huge — and that it was the 
people who needed help.
In 1971, Owen went on to start his own landscaping business, which was 
devoted to developing native-plant gardens for California homeowners. After 
a brief period of hauling rubbish and landscaping mobile homes, he found a 
niche for himself. As his career developed, his vision expanded, aided by a series 
of natural disasters that illuminated the need to make landscaping smarter, 
safer, and more environmentally friendly. Wildfi res led Owen to become an 
expert in fi rescaping (a term he coined). Droughts taught him the value of 
water conservation. The impacts of fossil-fuel use led him to found the Fossil-
Free Landscaping Group. Each catastrophe led to a wider vision of what land-
scaping could and should be.
Today, Owen is an internationally recognized and widely admired expert 
in sustainable landscaping. He has written numerous articles for Sunset 
Magazine, National Gardening Magazine, Southern California Gardener, Paciﬁ c 
Horticulture, and many others. He’s an international speaker who has pre-
sented hundreds of truly rousing lectures, classes, and workshops to hom-
eowners and professionals. Owen is also the co-writer and co-host of the 
popular Santa Barbara, California, television series Garden Wise Guys (www.
citytv18.com), a sustainable-landscaping sitcom. His other book, How to 
Start a Home-Based Landscaping Business (Globe Pequot), has helped thou-
sands of budding professionals get a healthy start on their careers.
Owen’s work has been featured on HGTV, Peak Moment Television, and NBC 
and in The Wall Street Journal, Fortune magazine, Landscape Architecture 
Magazine, the Los Angeles Times, and many other publications. He has won 
numerous awards for his work.
In his spare time, Owen putters in his own garden, hangs out with his cats, 
spends quality time in wild places, cooks a mean meal from homegrown pro-
duce, and dabbles in political and social activism.

Dedication
I dedicate this book to those who strive to make the world a better place by 
starting in their own backyards. What you do matters very much.
Acknowledgments
Let me tell you about my neighbor. I don’t want to assume he’s eager to see 
his name in a book, so I’ll call him Jack. He’s lived in his house for nearly 40 
years. He has the same furniture as when he moved in. The same Harvest Gold 
appliances. The same dial phone. The same 1967 car. And yes, the same land-
scaping. Far as I can tell, Jack buys food and occasionally some clothing. He’s 
not poor; he just likes to live simply. When I think about how much stuff I’ve 
gone through in that time, I’m truly humbled. True, his stuff is not environmen-
tally cool. His car pollutes more than my Prius, and his appliances don’t have 
Energy Star labels. But when you look at the overall impact of our lives, I bet 
his footprint is way smaller than mine. Jack is the most sustainable person I 
know, but he doesn’t see himself that way. He’s my hero, but he doesn’t know 
it. He’s just a guy living his life, but he has inspired me to do better, and that 
inspiration led, in part, to this book. Thanks, Jack, for keeping me honest. 
You’re the best neighbor a person could have.
Many people have helped me become (I hope) worthy of the task of spread-
ing the word about sustainable landscaping. Lacking the space to name 
them all, I tip my hat to those who have devoted their careers to this worthy 
work and who have inspired me and taught me so much. My esteemed col-
leagues — Ken Foster, Misty Gonzales, Billy Goodnick, Alison Jordan, Mark 
Wisniewski, and many others — provided feedback, information, resources, 
and encouragement while this book came into being. My staff was consis-
tently supportive as I neglected them to fi nd time to write. Kudos to Bonnie 
Barabas for keeping the offi ce in one piece and to Octavio Toscano for keep-
ing things together out in the fi eld. Your good work ensured that I have a 
business to go back to now that the writing is done.
Thanks to my friends for tolerating my reclusive behavior. Special thanks to my 
sweetie, Jan, for her encouragement, patience, and loving kindness as I subjected 
her to regular episodes of distraction, inattention, and anxiety.
The staff of the For Dummies series was a delight to work with. More than 
that, they consistently encouraged me not to hold anything back, to create 
a fi rst-class book fi lled with substance and solid information. Thanks, Alissa 
Schwipps and Mike Baker of Wiley. You guys ain’t half bad. And I’m grateful 
to the illustrators, Kathryn Born and Stacey Isaac, for their lovely contribu-
tions to the book. What a team!

Introduction
I
t’s a lovely fall day. I’m looking out the French doors that separate my 
office from the food forest outside. I see lemons, oranges, and tangerines 
ripening on (what an amazing coincidence!) my lemon, orange, and tangerine 
trees. A tall stalk of amaranth, a welcome volunteer, is topped by an outra-
geous pompom of red flowers swaying in the gentle afternoon breeze. Leeks, 
onions, fava beans, several kinds of basil, sage, bell peppers, hot chilies, blue-
berries, and a couple dozen other edibles are within my view. There’s even a 
water chestnut plant growing happily in a tiny water garden.
All in all I have more than 130 kinds of edible plants in my very compact yard, 
along with four water features; what must be hundreds of kinds of ornamen-
tal plants; lots of beneficial insects, butterflies, and hummingbirds; and a 
couple of cats snoozing in the shade on my little meadow of native sedges. I 
have half a dozen inviting outdoor rooms for entertaining and quiet contem-
plation, plus a welcoming entry area, a street-side native garden, and plenty 
of intimate views and surprises. I feel so fortunate to be able to enjoy this 
place every day.
I guess you could say I’m in love with my garden. I’d do just about anything 
for it, but the truth is that I hardly work on it at all. A couple of hours of 
work a week is sufficient to keep it in beautiful condition. It requires very 
little water, almost no fertilizer, and never, ever any pesticides. It generates 
almost no waste or bad karma. It feeds me, shelters me, entertains me and 
the others who experience it, delights all my senses, and provides habitat for 
many wild things — and it does all this with very little negative impact on the 
environment. It’s an efficient living system that really works.
This amazing spot didn’t happen by chance, of course. I spent 28 years creat-
ing a sustainable, beautiful garden. And landscaping is my profession, so I 
do have a leg up on the ordinary Joe. But having spent my adult life creating 
similar gardens for thousands of clients, I know such a place is within your 
reach — and you don’t have to wait a quarter century to have it.
This book shows you how to develop your property for maximum enjoyment, 
at minimal cost, and with a net positive impact on your surroundings. That 
outcome may sound like magic, but then, gardens are full of magic. You just 
have to know the tricks of the trade, and that’s what Sustainable Landscaping 
For Dummies is all about.

Sustainable Landscaping For Dummies 
About This Book
You may have already struggled and felt overwhelmed with the complexities 
of creating a landscape, especially if you yearn for something that’s good for 
the environment as well as for you. Admittedly, landscaping is complex — a 
lot more complex than most people realize. Yet when taken step by step, 
creating a sustainable landscape isn’t difficult. This book does a thorough job 
of filling you in on the principles of sustainable landscaping and on the all-
important details that make the difference between a garden that’s just okay 
and one that will blow everybody away with its beauty and usefulness.
Now, I happen to believe that anything worth doing is worth having fun with. 
Gardens should be fun, and so should reading about them. You can expect 
to find some silliness here, the occasional bad pun, and a light touch. But 
the fun doesn’t come at the expense of substance. You’ll find all you need to 
know here — perhaps more than has ever been compiled in one place on this 
subject. This book isn’t fluffy. But I like to believe it isn’t tedious, either.
Like all For Dummies books, you can dip into the book anywhere to get what 
you need. You don’t need to start at the beginning unless you want to. Go for 
what attracts you, and move around as you want. You’ll always get what you 
need, quickly and easily (the table of contents and index can help). When I 
just don’t have the space to cover everything, I refer you to handy Web sites 
or to some of the other gardening and landscaping books in the For Dummies 
series. I don’t want to leave you hanging.
Conventions Used in This Book
The following conventions are used throughout the text to make things 
consistent and easy to understand:
 
✓ New terms appear in italics and are closely followed by an easy-to-
understand definition.
 
✓ Bold highlights the key words in bulleted lists and the action parts of 
numbered steps.
 
✓ All Web addresses appear in monofont.
One thing you should know is that I use the terms landscape and garden 
interchangeably. It’s easy to argue about semantics, but for most people, 
the space around their home is their garden or their landscaping. To some 
degree, the term you prefer to use depends on how you manage things, with 
garden having a more active flavor than landscape. But hey, there’s really 

3
 Introduction
little or no difference, and frankly, I figure that reading the words landscape 
and landscaping over and over would be a little irritating after a while.
What You’re Not to Read
Every now and then, a special situation comes up in this book: I tell you 
something that’s interesting but not necessarily important to everyone. For 
instance, the fine details of how to make a handsome retaining wall out of 
chewed-up dog toys are quite fascinating. But surprisingly, most people prob-
ably don’t care much about this matter, despite the fact that our very way of 
life is dependent on it. Unfortunately, I think the dog-toy info ended up on the 
cutting room floor. But those are the type of fun but unnecessary facts that 
are placed in sidebars, which are boxes with gray backgrounds to separate 
them from the regular text. I don’t take points off for skipping these, and hey, 
don’t mind my feelings. I’ll be okay. Really.
Foolish Assumptions
I’ve been thinking about you. I think I may have your number when it comes 
to your gardening interests. See whether I’m right:
 
✓ You own a single-family home or hope to. It has some land around it, a 
little or a lot, and you’re wondering what the heck to do with it. You’re 
intrigued by the idea of messing around with land but don’t have a lot of 
background in gardening or landscaping.
 
✓ You care a lot about the environment, and you realize that this is your 
chance to do something really good — or to really mess things up. You 
realize that your yard is part of the real world and that what you do 
there isn’t just about your needs and your family’s needs. You take your 
responsibilities seriously.
 
✓ You like tackling do-it-yourself projects, not just to save money but 
because they’re fun. You’re no all-star landscaper, but you can dig a hole 
without ending up in traction, and you like physical work.
 
✓ You may have some gardening experience, but you’re facing a project 
that’s bigger than anything you’ve tackled before. You’re maybe just a 
teeny bit intimidated. You need a friend in the business.
 
✓ Then again, you may be a pro — a landscape contractor, gardener, or 
builder who’s looking for cutting-edge information on sustainable land-
scaping. You’ve come to the right place! Pull up a wheelbarrow and have 
a seat.

Sustainable Landscaping For Dummies 
How This Book Is Organized
Each part of this book covers a particular major chunk of information. Take 
a minute to look them over before you dive into the wonderful world of sus-
tainable landscaping.
Part I: Sustainable Landscaping: 
The Basics
That word sustainable is everywhere these days. It has a warm-’n’-fuzzy feel-
ing, but you may not really understand what it means when applied to land-
scaping. Part I is the place to find out. It helps you understand what makes a 
landscape sustainable, what a sustainable landscape looks like, why it mat-
ters, and what it’s going to cost you. It also introduces you to the sustainable 
materials, practices, and principles that go into a landscape system. Finally, 
Part I helps you decide what you can do yourself and when to call a pro.
Part II: Good Design: The Key 
to Sustainable Landscaping
Part II gives you in-depth details on designing a landscape. You discover site 
analysis (a fancy term for looking at stuff with your brain in gear); screening 
for sustainable features; and basic principles of landscape design, including 
some of the tricks the pros use to create those killer gardens in the fancy 
magazines. This part provides information on how to handle special situa-
tions and how to stay safe and out of trouble. It also provides you with plenty 
of information on creating a great landscape plan.
Part III: Water, Water, Everywhere: 
Water-Conserving Irrigation and Drainage
Most landscapes require some kind of watering system, if only to get new 
plantings established. Even native plantings need a little water at times. A 
watering system can be as simple as a hose or as complex as a fully automated 
irrigation system with a smart controller that gets its programming from outer 
space (no kidding). Here’s where you find out how it all works. In Part III, you 
see how to manage watering for maximum conservation and how to maintain 
your irrigation system. You also get up to speed on the all-important, ultra-
sustainable topic of water harvesting. Finally, I provide a bit of info about 
drainage systems. Wear your swim fins while reading this part.

 Introduction
Part IV: Hardscaping Made Easy: Creating 
Awesome Features without Wrecking the 
Environment
Even though sustainable landscapes rely primarily on plants and other elements 
of the biological world, you inevitably need some of the hard stuff: concrete 
patios, stone retaining walls, fences, arbors, steps, and lighting systems. 
Here, you find out how to assemble sustainable hardscape elements into 
outdoor rooms to serve your family’s needs as well as how to construct 
and maintain them. Just to show you that I’m not all business, this part also 
addresses fun stuff, such as art, water features, outdoor kitchens, and facili-
ties for animals — all done with minimal nasty impacts.
Part V: Great Greenery for a Green Garden
When most people hear the word landscaping or garden, they think of plants. 
Plants are the heart of the garden, and with the underpinnings out of the way, 
the fun of populating your property with trees, shrubs, perennials, and other 
plants begins in this part. Here you see how to design gorgeous plantings that 
also really work, demanding little care and few resources. You get the dirt on 
soil, composting, and mulching. You find out how to buy, install, and care for 
plants. And of course, you read all about lawns — but not just any old lawns; 
you find out about alternatives to conventional lawns and lawn care.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
Mere mortals with nongreen thumbs will love the list of ten easy, quick, and 
inexpensive (or free) projects that can almost instantly hurtle your existing 
landscaping into the world of sustainability. And everyone should have a look 
at the ten big mistakes to avoid.
Don’t stop there! If you have special interests or needs — such as making 
your home safer in a wildfire, developing an edible landscape, or making the 
most of rainfall — check out the appendix, which includes detailed drawings 
of realistic projects you can create. You also find sections on attracting wild-
life to your property, developing a drought-tolerant landscape, and creating 
a landscape that saves energy by keeping your house cooler in summer and 
warmer in winter.

Sustainable Landscaping For Dummies 
Icons Used in This Book
To make this book easier to read and simpler to use, I include some icons 
that can help you find and fathom key ideas and information.
 
I know a few landscaping pointers, and I’m not holding any of them back. 
Paragraphs with this icon next to them are places to get the inside scoop on 
doing things right.
 
Some stuff is more important than other stuff. This icon signals you to listen 
up, because if you blow this topic, you’ll regret it. So don’t skip any paragraphs 
marked with this icon.
 
Sustainable landscaping isn’t for sissies. You can get smacked down in lots of 
ways. Heed the warnings, and nobody gets hurt.
Where to Go from Here
Many sustainable processes don’t just make things less bad; they make 
them a lot better than how they started out. If you really take this advice far 
enough, your landscaping will go beyond sustainability to become a net pro-
ducer of great stuff — food, fresh air, cooler homes, more wildlife, happier 
people, and more.
And now you’re on your way. Maybe you feel like you’re stepping off the 
plane in an exotic foreign land: a bit excited and a bit disoriented. If you’re 
the linear type, like me, just keep reading. I think it’s important to at least 
absorb the basic principles in Chapters 1 and 2. But you may have a particu-
larly urgent need, such as getting an existing irrigation system back on its 
feet (Chapter 10), building a sustainable water feature (Chapter 13), or grow-
ing more food on your land (Chapter 18 and the appendix). Go for it.
To make navigation as easy as possible, the table of contents comes in two 
flavors: Contents at a Glance, which covers the major headings, and a full Table 
of Contents that spreads everything out. Don’t forget the yellow Cheat Sheet in 
the front of the book and the appendix in the back, which provide some neat 
special projects. Something for everybody — that’s my philosophy.
All kidding aside, I consider it an honor to share my lifetime of experience in — 
and passion for — sustainable landscaping with you. I wish you the most fun 
ever in making your dreams come true. Best of luck!

Sustainable 
Landscaping: 
The Basics

In this part . . .
W
hat the heck is a sustainable landscape, anyway? 
What does it look like, and what makes it tick? You 
may wonder how to get one (and how much it will cost). If 
you’re unfamiliar with this kind of landscape, you may 
also wonder whether it really makes any difference to the 
environment or to you. Finally, you may not know whether 
you can create a sustainable landscape yourself or have to 
hire a professional.
Start with this part to make sense of all these concerns 
and more. It’s a great jumping-off point for the rest of the 
book, because it gives you the core ideas behind sustain-
 able landscaping. It’s kind of like a road map for what’s to 
come. You’ll feel a lot better after you read these chapters.

Chapter 1
Landscaping the Sustainable Way
In This Chapter
▶ Going through a sustainability overview
▶ Creating a sustainable landscape
▶ Good design: The key to success
▶ Working out your plan
▶ Making maintenance easy and safe
L
ook at nature. Nobody gardens nature. Nature quietly thrives, while 
down in town, everyone takes up arms every Saturday morning — hack-
ing, decapitating, shearing, poisoning, ripping, and tearing their yards, not to 
mention sweating and swearing. Lucky for you, this book is all about how to 
develop your landscaping along natural models so you can enjoy lovely, envi-
ronmentally friendly surroundings and get a break from the battle.
This chapter gives you an overview of what sustainable landscaping is, why it 
matters, how it works, and how you can transform your property into a beauti-
ful, functional sustainable landscape. If you start with this chapter, you’ll have 
a good grasp of the basics, and then you can move on to whatever sections of 
the book apply to your current situation or whatever you’re curious about.
Getting Up to Speed on Sustainability
At one time, all gardens were simple. They were made up of plants, soil, 
and natural building materials. They didn’t cost much to create or care for. 
Their effect on the environment was positive, because they didn’t cause strip 
mining, release poisons into the atmosphere, or consume huge quantities of 
fossil fuel. They were sustainable before the word was popular because they 
could go on essentially forever.

10
Par t I: Sustainable Landscaping: The Basics 
That’s what sustainability is all about. Gardens can be that way again. All 
over the world, people are getting wise to the fact that they have an alterna-
tive to the dysfunctional industrial/commercial landscaping model that’s 
been jammed down our throats by advertising and ignorance.
 
Sustainability is a better way. It’s not perfect, but by doing things right, you’ll 
make a huge and important difference. Your land is your opportunity to help 
create a better future.
What the heck is sustainable 
landscaping, anyway?
Sustainable landscaping isn’t about a look. A Japanese garden can be sustain-
able. So can an English garden or a desert garden or a woodland garden. A 
sustainable landscape can be formal or informal, geometric or naturalistic, 
simple or complex. Other than planting vast swards of mowed lawn in a dry 
climate, you’re pretty much free to choose whatever look you want as long as 
you follow the principles of sustainability, setting up a smoothly functioning 
ecosystem that makes minimal demands and creates minimal problems.
The key ideas that make sustainable landscaping work are simple and easy to 
put into practice:
 
✓ Living system: Nature is a system of interrelated subsystems that work 
together to form a smoothly operating whole — a living, functioning eco-
system. There are many examples of living systems, such as your body 
(made up of various organs), a forest (filled with many kinds of plants 
and animals), and the ocean (teeming with millions of interdependent 
life forms). If you make your landscape a highly functioning system pat-
terned after the ways of nature, it will operate like nature — without the 
need for much control or intervention and without harming any other 
living system.
 
✓ Homeostasis: Homeostasis is a fancy word for stability. It’s the balance 
of forces in a living system, with no force getting out of control to cause 
harm. Consider your body, which more or less functions automatically. 
You don’t need to will your heart to beat or your eyes to see; those 
things just happen. With a little care from you, all is groovy. The land-
scape system can work this way, too, if you set it up right.
 
✓ Deep design: Homeostasis doesn’t happen by accident; it’s a product 
of good design. I’m not talking about the too-common superficial design 
that creates pretty but dysfunctional gardens. Instead, I mean design 
that looks beneath appearances to develop a beautiful landscape that 
also really works. Deep design takes special skills — skills that you 
discover in this book.

11
 Chapter 1: Landscaping the Sustainable Way
 
✓ Cyclical design: Nature recycles everything. As the Buddhist master 
Thich Nhat Hanh once said, “When I look at a rose I see compost; when 
I look at compost I see a rose.” Conventional manmade systems are 
linear. Consider the process:
 
1. Get a virgin material from nature (usually with disastrous effects at 
the source).
 
2. Use toxic and energy-intensive processes to alter it so much that it 
can never go back to nature.
 
3. Use it one time.
 
4. When the material’s too-short useful life comes to an end, dispose 
of it in a landfill, where it plugs up the works of yet another for-
merly living system.
 
 Nature has been very patient with us, but this linear game is just about 
up. Mother Nature hates it, and besides, she’s running out of merchan-
dise. Going back to the infinite and ancient cyclical way of life makes 
your garden one with nature, less troublesome, and more enduring.
 
✓ Harmony with the local environment: There are no nonlocal condi-
tions. Your property is unique, with a particular soil type, microclimate, 
exposure, vegetation, and other factors. By choosing plants and other 
elements that are well suited to these particulars, you set up a robust 
ecosystem that will be happy with its lot in life. (Conventional gardens 
rely on ill-adapted plants and other elements and then depend on con-
tinual input of resources to keep from failing.)
 
✓ Careful management of inputs and outputs: The sustainable landscape 
thrives on what nature offers. It makes efficient use of resources such 
as building materials, water, and fertilizer. What goes in and out of the 
landscape is minimized, so as many effects as possible are beneficial.
 
✓ Consideration of on-site effects: What happens on-site is carefully con-
sidered at the design stage. Natural features such as soil, native plants, 
and animal habitat are preserved. All improvements must meet the test 
of being good players. Each element of the newly formed ecosystem 
must play a beneficial role: making oxygen, sequestering carbon, provid-
ing food, improving the climate inside dwellings, preventing erosion, or 
protecting against wildfire, to name a few. To minimize negative effects, 
toxic materials aren’t used; neither are energy-intensive processes, 
noise-generating machinery, or thirsty plantings.
 
✓ Consideration of off-site effects: What happens off-site is important too. 
By that, I mean that there should be no damage at the source of materials. 
Your landscape won’t be truly sustainable unless it leaves forests intact, 
mountains unmined, oil unburned, and workers safe and happy.

Par t I: Sustainable Landscaping: The Basics 
 
✓ Benefits beyond sustainability: Finally, a sustainable landscape should 
seek to go beyond mere sustainability. As visionary architect William 
McDonough observed, we shouldn’t just be less bad; we should be good. 
Landscapes offer so many benefits to users and to nature that it’s easy 
to use the power of the sun, the rain, and the soil to create a paradise 
for all living beings. You can do that — and you have no reason not to.
Why sustainable landscaping 
matters to the environment
Where do I start? The traditional landscape is an environmental train wreck:
 
✓ It fragments and destroys native habitat.
 
✓ It consumes natural resources.
 
✓ It causes strip mining, clear cutting of forests, and other negative effects 
at the source of materials.
 
✓ It introduces nonnative plants that invade and devastate wild ecosystems.
 
✓ It wrecks waterways and groundwater through the leaching of pesticides, 
herbicides and fertilizers. (Of the nitrogen applied to lawns, 40 percent to 
60 percent ends up in the water.)
 
✓ It increases runoff, which results in urban flooding and further damage 
to waterways.
 
✓ It fills canyons and landfills with waste.
 
✓ It increases global warming through the use of fossil fuels.
 
✓ It wastes precious water to keep useless ornamental plants and lawns alive.
 
✓ Outdoor power equipment creates noise in every neighborhood.
 
✓ Pesticides kill 60 million to 70 million birds each year, not to mention 
their negative effects on beneficial insects and other wildlife.
 
✓ Pesticide use in the United States is ten times greater for landscaping 
than for agriculture.
Cowabunga! What a mess! Added to these effects are those on human
well-being:
 
✓ The health of one in every seven people is affected by pesticides.
 
✓ Air pollution caused by pesticides and fossil-fuel use damages 
everyone’s health.
 
✓ Each year, 60,000 to 70,000 severe accidents and fatalities are caused 
just from lawn mowing.

 Chapter 1: Landscaping the Sustainable Way
 
This has got to stop. Sustainable landscaping addresses all these issues by 
cleaning up the system, making these effects unnecessary, and respecting the 
environment. Simply put, sustainable landscaping is good for the environment 
because it does things the right way.
What’s in it for you
Suppose that you don’t even care about the environment. Fine. You still 
should have a sustainable landscape because it’s cheaper, easier to care for, 
more satisfying to live with, and much more interesting.
You’ll save money because all your inputs are significantly reduced. You’ll 
spend less on materials, water, fertilizer, gasoline, labor, dump fees — the 
works. Sustainable landscaping is a penny-pincher’s delight.
Because sustainable landscaping makes so few demands on you, you spend 
less time keeping it from falling apart and more time enjoying it (or enjoying 
something else you love). If you’ve busted your chops on a conventional land-
scape for a while, you know how much work it can be. Imagine that work not 
happening. That’s what converting to a sustainable landscape can do for you.
Finally, when you see how beautifully everything works, you’ll come to 
admire the elegance of a finely tuned system. It’s soothing to know that 
things are working smoothly without much help from you.
Doing Your Part: What It Takes to 
Make a Sustainable Landscape
I assume that you’ll be fairly involved with your project, even if you hire 
someone to do some of the work. That’s why you bought this book, right? 
Well, here’s an overview of what it takes to make your landscape sustainable, 
including tips on how to make the most of your relationship to the job.
Taking the time to do things right
Slow down. Whether your project is small or massive, the practice of deep 
design (refer to “What the heck is sustainable landscaping, anyway?” earlier 
in this chapter) demands careful observation and attention to detail. I’ve been 
told that in ancient times, Japanese garden designers sat on the site every day, 
all day, for a year, carefully noticing the way the sun moved; how the trees 
responded to wind; what animals visited; and many more subtleties that can 

14
Par t I: Sustainable Landscaping: The Basics 
be grasped only through quiet, intense scrutiny. As the seasons changed, the 
designers learned in summer what they could never learn in spring, and so on 
through the full annual cycle. Only after that apprenticeship did they dare to 
begin the design process. Whether you opt to follow the ancient ways or not, 
do give yourself time to understand what you’re working with. Attention to 
detail pays off in many ways.
Using your skills to lower your bills
If you’re planning to do the work of building a whole new landscape, you can 
look forward to a lot of physical effort. Even a smaller project can be hard 
work. Landscaping isn’t crocheting doilies. On the other hand, it can be a 
wonderful opportunity to get outside and get some exercise, and it can be a 
lot of fun too.
Busting some sustainability myths
As with anything new, concerns come up. You’ll 
be making a big, expensive, long-term com-
mitment to your landscaping, and you need to 
know that this isn’t some goofy New Age idea 
that doesn’t really deliver the goods. Here are 
some facts to set your mind at ease:
 ✓ Myth: Sustainable landscapes are ugly.
 
 Truth: Plants in a sustainable landscape 
are healthy and vigorous, and have room 
to grow into their beautiful natural forms. 
Structures are made from natural materials, 
with their inherent beauty showing through. 
Sustainable landscapes are green, flowery, 
fresh, and lovely — not parched gravel beds 
with thorny, nasty-looking plants (unless 
that’s what you want, of course).
 ✓ Myth: Sustainable landscapes are expensive.
 ✓ Truth: All landscaping is expensive, but 
sustainable landscaping is less expensive 
for a couple of reasons:
 ✓ Because the sustainable approach 
emphasizes plants over hardscape, you 
save money on the installation. Plants are 
cheaper than concrete.
 ✓ Even more important, the ongoing care of 
the landscape will be much less because it 
is undemanding of resources and labor.
 ✓ Myth: Sustainable landscapes don’t work.
 
 Truth: The whole point of developing a land-
scape sustainably is to create an ecosys-
tem that functions smoothly without much 
effort on your part. When you look at what’s 
needed to keep a conventional landscape 
in one piece — the mowing, watering, pest 
control, pruning, and all the rest — you 
see that conventional landscaping is what 
doesn’t work.

15
 Chapter 1: Landscaping the Sustainable Way
First, take stock of your ability to dig ditches, lift heavy stuff, and generally 
grunt out (weekend after weekend for a really big project). Balance that effort 
against the cost of paying someone else to do some or all of the work. If you 
do want to tackle it, be sure you know how to work safely, and check with 
your doctor if you have any qualms about your fitness level. Stay safe, okay?
 
Doing the work yourself can save up to half the total cost of the project. But 
before you leap in, it’s helpful to assess your abilities. You may know how to 
run a tractor or sweat copper pipe or program an irrigation controller. But you 
can also get into things you don’t know how to handle. This book, and its com-
panion volume Landscaping For Dummies (by Phillip Giroux, Bob Beckstrom, 
Lance Walheim, and The Editors of the National Gardening Association), will 
help you to develop skills you may not have. If there’s some part of the project 
that you can’t or don’t want to tackle, hire an expert. Paying someone else 
to do the work is cheaper than having to do it over. See Chapter 3 for some 
guidelines on when to do it yourself and when to hire a professional.
Getting a grip on costs
You have lots of variables to consider, and costs vary wildly depending on 
the kinds of improvements you’ll be making. A flagstone patio can cost 20 or 
30 times what a ground cover would for the same area, for example, and gen-
erally speaking, landscaping an entire yard front and rear can set you back 
the price of a new car or two. But many smaller projects and improvements 
won’t break the bank.
 
No matter the size of your project, you can save tons of money by doing the 
work yourself and by tapping the waste stream for materials whenever you 
can. See Chapter 2 for some inspiring waste stream resources.
Developing a good tight budget is difficult when you aren’t sure what you’ll 
be doing, so develop your design first. Then do your homework. Talk to 
contractors, shop for materials, and also consider the value of your own 
time. Don’t get too detailed at this stage. When you know exactly what you’ll 
be doing, you can crunch the numbers to determine the total expense and 
adjust your plan as needed.
If you’ll be doing an entire property, this number will be big. If the number is 
too big, consider how you could lower costs without compromising quality 
(smaller plants, less hardscape, and a manual irrigation system, for example). 

16
Par t I: Sustainable Landscaping: The Basics 
Or break the project into phases spread out over a few months or even years. 
For instance, you may tackle just the front yard during the first phase, and 
then follow up later with paths, patios, lighting, and other features. You have 
lots of options that help keep the money end of things on track.
 
Keep track of expenses with a spreadsheet. Log all the elements of the project 
and what they cost: the tractor used for demolition, tree trimming, topsoil, 
irrigation equipment, contracted labor (which may be the whole job), inciden-
tal expenses like a portable toilet for the workers, and so on. The handy thing 
about having costs set up this way is that you can keep updating your costs as 
your design goes through its inevitable changes. You can also use it to track 
actual costs as the project progresses. Check out Chapter 3 for more help 
keeping cost in mind.
Scheduling your project
Consider the scope of the work and how much time it will take you to do it 
or have it done. It’s amazing what you can accomplish in a weekend or two, if 
you’ve planned things out thoroughly in advance. Not every sustainable land-
scaping project has to take months out of your life. Looking at the sidebar 
on the sequence of landscaping operations, you’ll see a lot of tasks. Evaluate 
how many of those tasks are part of your project. A smaller job may involve 
only a little demolition, some planting, and a layer of mulch. A full-yard 
remodel could require work in every category and therefore call for some 
serious advance choreography.
Whatever the scope of your project, keep in mind that many landscaping 
tasks are dependent on the time of year. If you’ll be getting professional help 
with some or all of the job, talk to your contractor about the timing from his 
or her perspective. Think about your cash flow, too, if that’s a consideration.
 
For a large project, develop a project calendar, using the sequencing informa-
tion in the sidebar. Schedules can get off track, of course, but at least you’ll 
have an action plan to work from.
Planning and Design: The Keys 
to a Sustainable Landscape
When it comes to making your landscaping work properly, good design is 
everything; it determines once and for all how the system will work. Design is 
especially important when you have big plans in mind. It’s detailed, but it’s a 
lot of fun too.

17
 Chapter 1: Landscaping the Sustainable Way
Sequence of landscaping operations, start to finish
Here’s an overview of this whole big monster 
of a process of turning your nasty ol’ yard into 
a sustainable landscape. Every project has its 
own particular aspects, quirks, and special 
needs, but some universals apply to all proj-
ects. Landscaping isn’t an exact science, and 
many things can alter the passage from ugly 
to lovely. You may already have guessed that 
some of these steps are done concurrently 
with others. You may still be designing certain 
aspects of the project while you’re building 
others, for example. (In fact, you probably will 
be.) Whatever the particulars of your project, 
the following table will help give you an idea of 
how things usually go.
Certain sequences are pretty hard to argue 
with. You have to do your demolition before you 
build anything new, and it’s a whole lot easier to 
do the grading before the plants are planted and 
the irrigation is in. Other sequences are more 
flexible. You may install a patio in one corner of 
the yard before you even touch another corner. 
As for design, it can be a continuing process of 
thinking, learning, and reconsidering throughout 
the course of the entire project. Overall, though, 
if you follow this chain of events, you’ll be fine.

Par t I: Sustainable Landscaping: The Basics 
Getting to know the site — 
and your needs
Responding appropriately to conditions is essential to developing the kind of 
finely tuned landscape that’s easy to live with. The first step is making friends 
with the site so you understand what you’re dealing with. Start by spending 
some quality time with your yard. (It’s been a while, hasn’t it?) Go outside 
when you have the time to just hang out and quietly observe the many char-
acteristics of your property: the path of the sun, the condition of the soil, 
the health of existing plants, and good and bad views, to name a few aspects. 
Take photos, make notes, and move around to see things from as many per-
spectives as possible. Get professional advice if you have special concerns, 
such as an unstable hillside or soil problems. See Chapter 4 for an in-depth 
discussion of site analysis.
 
But understanding the site isn’t enough; you also have to learn what you want 
and need. Rushing into the design phase without going through this process 
leaves you without the information you need to make good decisions. Think 
about your needs and desires. What do you want from the finished landscape? 
Make a simple list. Do this outdoors so you can imagine the possibilities 
better. If you stand in your backyard and dream about what you need, for 
example, you might list privacy, a shady place with a hammock or a patio, a 
play space for the kids, a vegetable garden, a few fruit trees, secure fencing, 
and a water feature. Take the time to get everything down on paper. Include 
your family in the process, and make sure that everybody gets heard.
Scoping out sustainable 
avenues of research
I’ll be the first to admit that this book is almost all you need to create and 
maintain a sustainable landscape. Nonetheless, there are some other great 
resources out there that you should know about. Local government agen-
cies, such as the public works department, often have community-specific 
resources and tips on water conservation, waste reduction, and other 
aspects of sustainable landscaping. Visit the gardening section of your local 
bookstore. Talk to local nurseries and landscape supply stores.
 
And of course there’s the Internet, which is rich with timely information on 
all aspects of sustainable landscaping (but also rife with unreliable and inac-
curate information). I refer you to reliable Web sites throughout this book. But 
you can also search on a particular topic, such as integrated pest management 
or water harvesting, and turn up more information than you could ever even 
read. To cull out the junk and find the best information, focus on university 

19
 Chapter 1: Landscaping the Sustainable Way
Web sites (those with the suffix “.edu”), nonprofit sites (with the suffix “.org”), 
and some government agency sites, such as the Environmental Protection 
Agency (these sites use the suffix “.gov”). Commercial sites can be great too, 
but watch out for sales pitches disguised as information.
Developing a design
Design deserves your best thinking because it determines the outcome of 
the project and how it will function over time. The design phase is a time to 
slow down and pay attention. Design goes from the general (“I think I want a 
vegetable garden”) to the specific (“I want four 4 x 10 raised stone beds in the 
northeast corner of the back yard with six kohlrabi plants, a dozen rutaba-
gas, and five Bad Boy tomatoes”).
 
Designing a sustainable landscape is rigorous, but anyone can do it. I discuss 
design in detail in Part II of this book. For now, here’s an overview of the process:
 
✓ Creating the conceptual design: When you understand the site and 
your own needs, you’re ready to take a first stab at putting everything 
together. This draft is called the conceptual design. You create it in steps, 
starting with a bubble diagram and moving through field measuring, a 
base sheet, and ending with a concept plan.
 
✓ Refining your design: When you have a good understanding of how the 
elements fit together, you can begin to work on all the little details. What 
will that patio be made of, and precisely what will its shape and location 
be? Which tree will go on the east side of the house, and what size will it 
be at planting time? What species of perennials will go in the front border, 
how many of each kind, and what container size? You can even develop 
a series of individual plans that detail the construction, planting, irriga-
tion, and other phases of the work. These plans will help you refine your 
ideas and guide you through the long process of constructing the land-
scape, and they’ll help you share your vision with a contractor if you 
decide to hire a pro.
Putting Your Plan into Play
It’s time to get hot and dirty! Are you really ready for this? Okay. You can 
do it. Put on those work boots and a good hat, grab your gear, and get out 
in the hot sun (don’t forget sunscreen!). The work won’t be easy, but it won’t 
kill you either. Keep the dream of a beautiful new garden alive while you 
work. And if you poop out, you can always hire eager professionals to pick up 
where you left off.

20
Par t I: Sustainable Landscaping: The Basics 
Gathering the tools and 
materials you need
A landscaping project really is many projects rolled into one. Depending on 
the scope of your project, you may be doing demolition, moving and grading 
soil, installing irrigation and drainage systems, building all sorts of struc-
tures, planting plants, mulching, and doing a lot more. Some tools, such as 
shovels and rakes, are common to many of these tasks, and you’ll get to know 
them quite well indeed. Other jobs — particularly hardscape construction 
(see Chapter 14) — require special and sometimes costly tools. You probably 
already have the basic tools; others can be rented or borrowed. (Buying tools 
that you only use once or twice isn’t very sustainable, is it?)
 
The right tools make the job easier and safer, and the outcome will be more 
like what a pro would do. As for materials, you’ll be getting these from a vari-
ety of sources: lumberyards, concrete plants, nurseries, landscape supply 
stores, stone and masonry dealers, irrigation supply stores, and others. Scout 
local resources, looking for places that have a commitment to supplying 
sustainable materials whenever possible. Try to buy locally, but if a more sus-
tainable material is available elsewhere, it may be a better choice environmen-
tally. Don’t forget to tap the waste stream for as many materials as you can 
(see Chapter 2). Sustainable means buying as little as possible.
Ensuring success along the way
If you’re tackling a small project, a day or two may be enough to get the job 
done. Some projects require more time to get ready than it takes to do the 
actual work. Plan ahead, gathering up all the materials and tools you need in 
advance of the big day. Keep in mind that some materials, especially plants, 
may not be available exactly when you need them, so call around at least a 
week in advance to be sure you’ll have what you need.
If you’re taking on an entire landscape remodel, pace yourself. It isn’t a one-
weekend project. Many people burn out partway through. But you have to 
be sustainable too. If you aren’t accustomed to physical work, build up to it 
slowly, and give yourself lots of breaks.
 
The best outcome is the result of ongoing design decisions made as the 
project unfolds. Just because you turn your body on to do the physical work 
doesn’t mean that you turn your mind off.

21
 Chapter 1: Landscaping the Sustainable Way
 
As you go, don’t be afraid to rethink the details as new aspects of the work 
unfold. Details matter, and they aren’t all evident in the design stage. Stay 
open to new ideas.
Maintaining the Land Nature’s Way
You don’t have to be a great gardener to have a great garden. Caring for a 
sustainable landscape should be much easier than caring for a conventional 
one. It’s been designed with low maintenance in mind, remember?
The first year will be somewhat demanding as you nurture your new baby 
along to maturity, but maintenance will get much easier after that. By con-
trast, a conventional garden — with its many oversize plants, susceptibility 
to pests and diseases, and generally entropic nature — can get harder and 
harder to live with over time.
Even sustainable landscapes require some maintenance, but it’s along the 
lines of removing dead flowers, picking fruit, tidying up a bit, and gently 
nudging things in the right direction now and then. The work is nonviolent, 
quiet, and fun. For more information on maintaining your sustainable land-
scape, flip to Chapter 20.
Minimizing the effects of maintenance, 
on- and off-site
Conventional maintenance does huge damage to the environment. Every year 
in the United States alone, we use 800 million gallons of gasoline just to mow 
lawns — and lots more to power other equipment, such as trimmers, blowers, 
and chain saws. Power equipment also generates significant air and noise 
pollution.
The 67 million pounds of pesticides used annually on American lawns 
destroy native and beneficial insects, cause air pollution, and sicken people 
and pets. Herbicides and fertilizers also harm the environment.
The result is a mess, but things don’t need to be this way. By building a land-
scape that needs little care, adopting organic methods that don’t use harsh 
chemicals, and using hand tools instead of power equipment, the sustain-
able landscape becomes a place of peace, purity, and productivity, not a war 
zone. You find tips for how to do this in Chapters 20, 21, and 22.

22
Par t I: Sustainable Landscaping: The Basics 
Cutting out the chemicals
The reason that conventional gardens depend on chemicals is that they 
aren’t set up to be durable and naturally resistant to pests and diseases. 
Gardeners often use chemicals because they don’t know about natural alter-
natives or don’t believe that natural solutions could possibly work as well. 
Actually, the opposite is true. Follow the tips on natural weed control and 
integrated pest management in Chapter 21, and stick with organic fertilizers 
(see Chapter 22). You’ll be safer; so will your family and the environment.
Keeping costs down
Because so much less care is involved, costs drop dramatically in sustainable 
landscapes. It’s easy to prove that around 80 percent of the total cost of a con-
ventional garden is for maintenance over a 20-year life span. That adds up to a 
huge number — one that most homeowners are shocked to see, realizing that 
their property is eating up their life savings month by month. In a sustainable 
system, the cost of everything is less because you have less to do and fewer 
inputs to provide. Even small savings can add up to make a huge difference in 
the overall cost of the project.

O
ne of the coolest things about landscaping your property sustainably 
is that you, personally, benefit from it. Heck, even if you don’t give a 
hoot about the environment, you’re going to save big bucks and avoid having 
to do a whole lot of hard work that you didn’t really want to do anyway. 
Sustainable landscaping is good for your selfish side and for the planet.
In this chapter, I tell you how to make good decisions about what to include 
in your landscape. I help you select materials and features that make 
sense for you and the environment, and I show you how to create a dream 
landscape that’s beautiful and easy to live with.
 
The whole idea of sustainable landscaping is creating a practical, well-thought-
out landscape system that works for everybody — including the environment. 
The total impact of your landscape, both on- and off-site, should be positive. 
In other words, sustainable landscaping is about considering the life cycle of 
everything that you bring into your landscape. When you take the life cycle 
into account, you’re well on your way to creating a landscape that’s truly 
sustainable.
Using Materials and Resources Wisely
Putting resources to good (and efficient) use not only reduces the impact of 
your landscaping project, but it also saves you money. After all, you’re 

24
Part I: Sustainable Landscaping: The Basics 
buying cheaper materials and using less of them. Creating a conventional 
landscape requires lots of materials, and over time it requires more and more 
resources to keep it going. Why? Because most landscapes aren’t designed 
along the lines of nature and its life cycles and systems.
Nature is really good at fostering ecosystems that are self-regulating and 
able to live on locally available resources. Think about it: Nobody waters, 
fertilizes, or sprays wild areas with pesticides, and yet they continue growing 
for millions of years. By making your landscape more in keeping with the 
rules of nature, you’ll enjoy the same benefits found in a natural system.
 
So an important principle to apply when you’re designing your landscape is 
simply to use fewer materials and resources. For instance, a landscape that’s 
dominated by hardscape (constructed features, like a concrete patio or a 
wrought iron fence) creates enormous impacts off-site where the materials are 
obtained and processed.
The production of concrete, for instance, requires strip mining of rock, sand, 
and the other minerals that go into making cement. Manufacturing cement 
also generates a lot of carbon dioxide — over a billion metric tons per year 
worldwide. Concrete is just one example of how much damage is done by our 
addiction to high-tech landscaping materials. And you know what? Concrete 
is expensive, too!
After a conventional landscape made with lots of materials is completed, its 
appetite for water, fertilizer, and other resources — not to mention the labor 
and money that all this requires — will vary depending on how skillfully the 
landscape was initially designed. On the other hand, a landscape that’s an 
internally stable, highly-functioning ecosystem won’t need much help from 
you or require many materials to keep it going. The remaining sections in 
this chapter provide you with tons of specific ways to reduce your use of 
materials and resources.
Getting the Most Out of What 
You Put Into Your Landscape
If you want to create a highly tuned, efficient landscaping system that 
rewards you with decades of pleasure and beauty, you need to create a 
landscape that minimizes the need for inputs (the things you bring in) and 
uses the most efficient and earth-friendly materials when you do need them. 
It should also generate few (or no) outputs (things that leave the system; 
erroneously called “waste”).

25
 Chapter 2: Making Good Decisions about What to Include in Your Landscape
In this section, I focus on the inputs. Check out the later section “Generating 
Few (or No) Outputs” for more on minimizing outputs. Landscaping inputs 
fall into two categories:
 
✓ Building materials that are used to initially create the landscape
 
✓ Maintenance materials that are required to keep your landscape going
 
You have to build your landscape out of something, but there are huge differ-
ences among the materials, and many really great sustainable options are 
available. The more efficient your landscape is, the fewer maintenance 
materials you’ll need.
Building materials: Turning one person’s 
trash into your landscaping treasure
Your first step when trying to minimize your building material inputs is to 
consider how much hardscape you really need. It isn’t necessary to pour a 
patio big enough to accommodate a wedding reception when you really just 
need someplace for the family to have dinner. Get into the habit of self-
restraint. After deciding how much hardscape you need, determine what you 
already have that you can use to build it. The first place you should look for 
materials is in your own backyard. What you have there is free, doesn’t need 
to be transported from elsewhere (burning up fossil fuels in the process), 
and isn’t doing much other than just sitting around.
At first you may think that you don’t have anything useful, but I’m willing to 
bet you do. As you look around your property, make a list of anything that 
you could possibly transform into a landscape feature. For instance, here are 
some ideas:
 
✓ Use native stones to build walls, paths, and dry streambeds
 
✓ Harvest undesirable trees for lumber
 
✓ Break up an old patio and turn the pieces into stepping stones
If nothing else, there’s always soil, which you can turn into handsome 
earthen walls, benches, and even toolsheds. Visit Chapter 13 for details.
 
Don’t overlook the neighbors’ yards. Their so-called trash may be just what 
you need for your hardscape (and won’t they be happy if you clean up their 
yards for them!). Also, consider reusing things that come from the communi-
ty’s waste stream, such as broken concrete (now called urbanite, a brand-new 
mineral!), which you can easily turn into a lovely patio or a handsome

dry-stacked low retaining wall. Similarly, old timbers on their way to the land-
fill can be used to build a raised bed or handsome footbridge. There are many 
ways to hunt down usable waste materials. Develop an eye for what might be 
salvaged from neighborhood remodels, cleanups, and construction projects. 
Tap local businesses for surplus materials. Scour craigslist, local classifieds, 
and bulletin boards. Dumpster dive.
Everything old is new again: Salvaged and reclaimed materials
Salvaged and reclaimed materials are resources that could have been wasted 
but are instead carefully saved and sold to willing buyers. In certain places, 
for example, you can buy wood that has been taken out of old barns (with the 
barn owner’s permission, of course). You can also purchase logs dredged up 
from underwater where they sank a century ago. This lumber isn’t cheap, but 
it’s sold at a fraction of what you’d pay for similarly gorgeous old-growth 
wood (if you could even find it).
If you can’t get your hands on used wood, note that modern portable lumber 
mills are circulating around some communities making usable lumber out of 
urban trees that have to be cut down for one reason or another. This lumber 
is sold at retail outlets and is usually advertised locally. Similarly, used bricks 
can be found in nearly any community; you’ll find them advertised in the 
classified section of the newspaper or online.
 
A search of the Web can often turn up amazingly cool things for sale that you 
can use to create a one-of-a-kind refuse-chic landscape feature. There are 
even stores around the country that sell used building materials of all kinds. 
Most of these are small mom-and-pop operations, but you can also check out 
the chain of ReStores, which is operated by the nonprofit group Habitat for 
Humanity. Purchases made at a ReStore benefit good works around the world. 
Visit www.habitat.org/env/restores.aspx to find a ReStore near you.
Reincarnation: Recycled content materials
The difference between waste-stream or reclaimed materials and recycled 
ones is the degree of processing involved. You can use a waste-stream mate-
rial, such as urbanite, as is, with no special work to make it into something 
else. It’s still just concrete when you’re done with it. But a recycled material, 
such as plastic lumber, goes into a factory as a big load of sticky pop bottles 
and comes out looking like a 2 x 6. You’d have a hard time guessing what it 
was made from.
Some people refer to recycling as downcycling or remanufacturing because the 
end product is so different from the ingredients that went into it. These folks 
also use this terminology because in most cases you can never take it in the 
other direction. For example, you couldn’t make soda bottles out of old plas-
tic lumber. A few materials, such as aluminum and steel, are truly recyclable.

27
 Chapter 2: Making Good Decisions about What to Include in Your Landscape
By using recycled materials, you’re having a positive impact on the environ-
ment. You’re making use of what had once been considered trash, and that 
reduces the need to cut down trees, strip mine raw materials, and do other 
environmentally irresponsible things.
Some recycled-content materials, such as plastic lumber, may cost somewhat 
more than conventional products. Others, like wood chips, are free or 
available at a very low cost. Refer to Table 2-1 for a list of recycled materials 
commonly available in most communities.
Table 2-1

Some recycled materials are controversial. For example, there’s concern 
about crumb rubber that’s made of ground up tires and used as mulch, as a 
base under artificial turf, and in playground mats. Zinc and other chemicals 
leaching from the rubber can kill plants and permanently toxify soil. The 
rubber also may be a fire hazard. And of course it stinks to high heaven on a 
hot day. Similarly, biosolids (treated sewage in common parlance) that are 
used as fertilizer come from uncontrolled sources that may contain contami-
nants or toxins. Even wood chips can contain weed seeds and contaminants. 
Some years ago many areas had a problem with persistent herbicides in 
municipal compost. The moral of this story? Investigate all claims made for 
recycled materials.
Taking it easy with low-impact materials
Low-impact materials are those that have been produced using practices that 
create a minimum of harmful effects on the environment. For instance, you 
can look for lumber that’s been certified by an independent organization as 

28
Part I: Sustainable Landscaping: The Basics 
having been sustainably grown and harvested. Such organizations include 
the Forest Stewardship Council in the United States (www.fscus.com) or the 
Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (www.pefc.org).
Here are a few other low-impact considerations:
 
✓ Use straw bale or earthen construction instead of lumber.
 
✓ Grow your own wood or bamboo for a low-impact, ultra-local resource.
 
✓ Substitute high-density polyethylene (HDPE) or galvanized piping for 
PVC (polyvinyl chloride). Also avoid copper, because it’s strip mined.
 
✓ If you must use paints and finishes, choose those that are low in volatile 
organic compounds (VOCs). Low-VOC paints don’t emit as many pollut-
ants into the atmosphere.
Protecting the future with renewable materials
Simply put, a renewable resource is one that you can continually get more of. 
Trees are a renewable resource — you can simply plant more trees. Oil, on 
the other hand, is not a renewable resource. The amount of oil on the planet 
today is as much as there will ever be.
 
By choosing renewable materials, you can ensure that future generations will 
be able to enjoy them too. Renewable materials are those that come from 
living sources, because they’re the only things that can replicate themselves. 
Examples include lumber and other wood products, bamboo, straw, animal 
manures, and organic fertilizers, such as bone meal, fish emulsion, and kelp.
Creating things that last: Heritage materials
A special category of materials includes what I call heritage materials. These 
materials are produced so they can be reused over and over again as circum-
stances change. An example is the interlocking concrete paver block systems 
that are beginning to pop up in driveways all over.
For a long time, I truly hated these systems, mainly because of their lack of 
aesthetic merits. Then one day I realized that the most important thing about 
these pavers was the fact that they could be taken up and reused. Your 
driveway, 40 years from now, could become a neighbor’s driveway, and then 
in a few more decades it could end up in the next block as a patio in the 
backyard of somebody who hasn’t even been born yet.
 
When you create things that last and make them modular so they can be 
used again or repurposed, you’re doing something very sustainable indeed, 
because the initial environmental impact can be spread over many decades 
of use.

29
 Chapter 2: Making Good Decisions about What to Include in Your Landscape
Any durable and movable item — bricks, stones, paving blocks, and segmen-
tal retaining walls, for example — could fall into the category of heritage 
material. The key is understanding the long-term potential of these materials 
and setting them onto a bed of compacted sand rather than cementing them 
into place so they can’t be reused.
Maintenance materials: Planning 
ahead to reduce upkeep later
After you’ve completed your landscaping, it will still require maintenance. 
After all, there’s no such thing as no-maintenance landscaping. But by 
designing for sustainability and building things so they last, you’ll be reduc-
ing the materials, effort, and money that go into keeping the place in shape.
In the following sections, I cover the materials commonly needed to maintain 
a landscape, and I also tell you which chapters help you minimize your need 
for these materials.
Water
Most folks think of water as being abundant, but out of the 326 million cubic 
miles of water on the planet, only about three-tenths of a percent of it is 
fresh, relatively unpolluted potable (drinkable) water that’s usable by 
humans. Overall, that’s not much.
The totally cool art of junkscaping
Living off the fat of the land is easy in our world, 
and it’s so satisfying to know that you helped 
clean up a waste problem, got a material for 
nothing (or next to nothing), and reduced your 
demands for new materials — all in one fell 
swoop. That kind of synergy can really make 
you grin. The idea of junkscaping is simple: Find 
something that’s headed to the landfill, and then 
take it home and make it a really cool part of 
your yard.
The possibilities for junkscaping your yard are 
endless. In fact, you have so much waste going 
by your door every day that you simply have no 
excuse for not building something out of it. 
Heck, I’ve seen planter beds edged with bowl-
ing balls bought for a dollar or two at the thrift 
store, a planter made out of old car headlights, 
lovely bonsai pots made from old truck brake 
drums, furniture crafted from fallen trees, old 
patios beautified with artfully inlaid scraps of 
tile and waste wood, and gorgeous wrought 
iron work made from old oilfield piping. Used 
materials often have that funky glow that only 
old things can provide. Think of them as outdoor 
antiques.
Where do you find this stuff? On craigslist, free-
stuff listservs, and Web sites; in classified ads; 
sitting by the side of the road; at junkyards and 
used materials stores; in the backs of shopping 
centers; in dumpsters; and in your neighbor’s 
backyard. Junk is everywhere!

Part I: Sustainable Landscaping: The Basics 
Water is a renewable resource, of course. (Refer to the earlier section 
“Protecting the future with renewable materials” for more on renewable 
resources.) In fact, the water that falls from the sky in the form of rain and 
snow is about as renewable as you can get. Plus it’s free. Rain even picks 
up nitrogen on its way down, delivering nice organic fertilizer right to your 
plants, and then watering it in — all at no charge. You gotta love that.
 
Water is in short supply in most places now, and it just isn’t right to use pota-
ble water to irrigate lawns and decorative plants when people in other parts of 
the world are going thirsty. Fortunately you can greatly reduce your landscape 
water use without compromising the appearance and function of your garden. 
Check out the Cheat Sheet as well as the chapters in Part III for everything you 
need to know about the big subject of water conservation.
Fertilizer
Have you ever wondered why we need to fertilize? Nobody fertilizes the 
mountains or the forests, yet they grow perfectly well century after century. 
If you suspect something strange about the constant need to feed garden 
plants, you’re right.
 
If a plant is well-adapted to local conditions because it’s native to your area 
or comes from a similar environment somewhere else in the world, it’ll be 
satisfied with the nutrients that are naturally available in the soil. And if you 
can manage to resist raking up all those tree leaves in the fall (they call them 
leaves because you’re supposed to leave them there), you’ll be allowing 
valuable nutrients to remain in place. That means you don’t have to replace 
them with expensive, imported fertilizer. If you just can’t stand to see the 
leaves lying on the ground, compost them and return them to the soil.
Of course there are times to fertilize. Many food-bearing crops need regular 
fertilizing, and any plant will need a little snack now and then. How do you 
know? Get a soil test, and watch the plants for signs of nutrient deficiencies 
(yellowing leaves and slowing growth, for example).
When you do fertilize, be sure to use organic fertilizers, which come from 
natural, renewable, non-petroleum sources. These types are less likely to 
burn plants, and they’re a lot kinder to the soil. See Chapters 16 and 20 for 
more on fertilizers.
Pesticides
Pesticides kill — you guessed it — pests, such as bugs. As with fertilizers, it’s 
tempting to ask why we even need this stuff. Plants in nature get pests and 
diseases just the same as the ones in your garden. In nature, however, there’s 
a better balance of pests and predators, and because the system is in a state 
of equilibrium things are less likely to go wildly out of control.

31
 Chapter 2: Making Good Decisions about What to Include in Your Landscape
You can control most pests pretty easily without resorting to wicked chemi-
cals and war-like ways. First, choose plants that are naturally pest-resistant, 
and then give them proper growing conditions so they thrive (healthy plants 
are much less susceptible to pests and diseases). Then wait out any infesta-
tions, because beneficial insects often move in to kill pests. If that doesn’t 
work, use the least-toxic control method that you can, such as releasing 
beneficial insects that you buy at the nursery, washing pests off of plants, or 
using an insecticidal soap that’s not toxic (unless, of course, you’re a pest). 
Refer to Chapter 21 for complete details on pest management.
Herbicides
Herbicides kill weeds (plants that are both undesired and inclined to self-
replicate to a troublesome degree). Most weeds are nonnative. Despite 
decades of herbicide use, you may have noticed that we still have tons of 
weeds. If these herbicides work so well, how come the planet has more 
weeds than ever? It’s time to take a different track.
 
Weeds occur most densely in disturbed areas, where bare ground creates 
a favorable habitat for them. The bare ground in a flowerbed is a perfect 
example. And though you’ll never entirely get rid of weeds, you have some 
simple, sustainable strategies available to you that work at least as well as the 
harmful chemicals. For example, you can plant densely. If you don’t have 
much free space in your landscape, the weeds won’t have any room to grow, 
and the plants you do want will keep weeds from cropping up. Flip to Chapter 
20 for more highly effective — and environmentally safe — weed management 
techniques.
Fossil fuels
Petroleum products (oil, gasoline, natural gas) are used everywhere in the 
garden. They’re made from crude oil, which is basically made from rotten 
old dinosaurs and primitive plants that have been festering underground for 
millions of years — hence the term fossil fuels. Gas-powered lawn mowers 
and other power garden equipment are major consumers of gas and oil. In 
fact, according to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Americans 
use over 800 million gallons of gas a year just mowing their lawns!
But there’s a whole lot more oil in those gardens. Check out the nearby 
sidebar for the grim details.
 
By using hand tools (check out the list on the Cheat Sheet), organic fertilizers, 
natural materials, and other low-impact inputs, you can significantly reduce 
your garden’s dependence on fossil fuels. And if you use some of your prop-
erty to grow food, you’ll reduce your own dependence on fossil fuels for food 
production and shipment.

32
Part I: Sustainable Landscaping: The Basics 
Time
Sustainable landscaping is stable landscaping, which means it doesn’t turn 
into a jungle of weeds and overgrown or dying plants when you leave it alone 
for a couple of weeks. With its own elegant system of checks and balances, 
sustainable landscaping doesn’t really need much from you. A little benevo-
lent nudging now and then is sufficient for the routine care of the landscape. 
That means you probably need a long day in the garden only once or twice a 
year. So, you have time to enjoy the garden instead of working in it every 
weekend! Sustainable gardens save you time.
Money
When you design, construct, and maintain your landscape sustainably, you 
spend far less money on it over time. The landscaping may or may not cost 
you less to put in, but for sure it will cost less to care for because it makes 
Fossil fuelishness
Have a look at some of the sneaky ways that oil 
consumption creeps into your gardening and 
landscaping:
 ✓ Transportation of imported materials: Every 
time you buy materials that have to be deliv-
ered to your home (either by your own car 
or by a delivery truck), you’re using oil.
 ✓ Manufacturing of nearly everything used in 
the landscape: Many landscape materials 
and products are made from oil, and fossil 
fuel energy is used in the manufacturing 
process.
 ✓ Pumping water: Unless gravity does the 
job, water is pumped out of wells or over 
mountains to get to you. Energy to run the 
pumps comes primarily from fossil fuels.
 ✓ Chemically-based fertilizers and pesti-
cides: The main ingredient in chemically-
based nitrogen fertilizer is natural gas, 
which is a fossil fuel. Some pesticides are 
made from oil.
 ✓ Plastics of all kinds, including irrigation 
pipe and materials, garden structures, 
furniture, and plant containers: With a few 
exceptions, plastics are made directly 
from oil.
 ✓ Construction processes that require power 
tools and heavy equipment: Tractors, tren-
chers, tillers, and similar pieces of equip-
ment all operate on fossil fuels. Even 
electrically-powered equipment depends 
on fossil fuels. How? They’re burned to gen-
erate electricity.
 ✓ Maintenance, including the use of power 
equipment: Obviously, mowers, blowers, 
and the like run on gas, but so do the trucks 
that bring the workers.
 ✓ Disposal, including trash hauling, green 
waste processing, and landfill manage-
ment: Hauling, grinding green waste, and 
filling and capping landfills all depend 
on fuel.
 ✓ Equipment to melt snow and ice: Increased 
use of heating equipment to keep walk-
ways, driveways, and pools free of snow 
and ice uses energy.

33
 Chapter 2: Making Good Decisions about What to Include in Your Landscape
fewer ongoing demands. The maintenance cost of a conventionally cared-for 
landscape can run three times that of a sustainably-maintained one, and 
there’s a huge difference in the environmental impacts too.
Generating Few (or No) Outputs
Outputs, the so-called waste products of landscaping, occur because of ineffi-
ciencies in the design of the system. When a landscape is designed as a linear 
system (where materials are taken from nature, used once, and then thrown 
away), it’s inevitable that a lot of waste will occur. On the other hand, nature 
itself is a cyclical system. Each element in a cyclical system stays within that 
system, eliminating the need for both inputs and waste. The goal of sustain-
able landscaping is to develop a minimum-waste, minimum-output system.
You can eliminate (or at least minimize) negative outputs by optimizing your 
inputs. This kind of efficiency is the synergy of a finely-tuned system at work. 
(Check out the earlier section, “Getting the Most Out of What You Put Into 
Your Landscape” for more details on optimizing your inputs.)
 
The following sections focus on less-desirable outputs, but keep in mind that 
some outputs are good — the oxygen given off by living plants, for instance, or 
the food you grow in your garden.
Green waste
Green waste is a fancy term for the plant parts we cut off and send to that 
magical place called “away.” Sometimes green waste ends up in landfills, and 
sometimes it comes back to us as mulch. But the truth is that, in most cases, 
green waste doesn’t need to exist in the first place. It’s caused by poor design 
that puts plants in spaces that are too small for their eventual size, requiring 
the gardener to trim or prune the plant to fit the size the gardener wants it it 
be (instead of the size the plant has evolved to be). Plants all have genetic 
destinies to develop in certain time-honored ways. They grow to fulfill their 
destinies, often to the detriment of the garden and the gardener. Want proof? 
I once saw a hedge made of young redwood trees (you know, the ones that 
grow 30-foot trunks?). Fifty-four of these trees were placed a foot apart in a 
tiny planter space only 8 inches wide. What do you suppose the people who 
created this landscaping nightmare were thinking?
Placing the wrong plant in the wrong place is just one example of the com-
monest of garden afflictions. Other examples include planting invasive vines, 
choosing spreading junipers for 5-foot-wide parkways, using trees as hedges, 
picking tall shrubs as ground covers, and planting any plant that has an 
indeterminate growth habit (no reasonable limits to its ultimate size).

34
Part I: Sustainable Landscaping: The Basics 
The existence of green waste is caused by other factors as well. Consider, for 
example, over-watering and over-fertilizing. Both make plants grow faster and 
bigger. Sometimes that’s a good thing, but excess growth that just needs to 
be cut off and thrown away creates problems (without any benefits).
 
When you design your garden, carefully check the ultimate size of the plants 
you select, and then locate them so they have enough room to grow. If the 
plant will grow too large for the space you’re considering, choose another 
plant — one that will fit — instead. This is one of the truly essential ideas of 
the sustainable landscape. Imagine how much time you’ll save by maintaining 
a garden that requires little or no pruning to control size.
Polluted runoff
Polluted runoff is caused by rainfall or irrigation water moving pesticides, 
herbicides, fertilizers, dog feces, and other nasty stuff into streets, storm 
drains, and eventually into bodies of water. Polluted runoff is a major 
problem all over the world. You can become part of the solution simply by 
not using pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers in the first place — and 
by cleaning up after your dog. Nothing in, nothing out.
The other problem is that when water from your property hits the street, it 
washes curbside pollution into those same bodies of water. Use water 
harvesting strategies such as underground percolation chambers and careful 
watering to keep rainwater on site (see Part III). By inviting water into your 
soil, it remains on site. And beneficial microorganisms in the soil will break 
pollutants down so they can’t cause environmental problems.
Air pollution
When Ronald Reagan was governor of California, he said, “Trees cause more 
pollution than automobiles do.” I was never Reagan’s biggest fan, but it 
turns out that his statement has some basis in fact. Here’s the fact: Some 
tree species produce what scientists call biogenic emissions (volatile organic 
compounds that can worsen pollution problems). Because of the emissions, 
these trees shouldn’t be planted in large quantities in urban areas. The worst 
offenders include some species of Eucalyptus, Ficus, sweet gum, spruce, 
sycamore, cottonwood, oak, and willow, to name a few. Visit selectree.
calpoly.edu for information on the emissions of particular tree species. 
And remember that most trees reduce air pollution and are a significant net 
benefit to the environment.

35
 Chapter 2: Making Good Decisions about What to Include in Your Landscape
Despite what the Gipper said, far more significant than the pollution caused 
by trees are the emissions produced by humans engaged in destructive gar-
dening activities, such as operating power lawn and garden equipment, 
spraying pesticides and herbicides, and driving back and forth to the garden-
ing center for another load of feed-and-weed. In fact, the small engines used 
in powered outdoor gear emit enough hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and 
nitrogen oxides to qualify as the largest single contributor to non-vehicle 
hydrocarbon emissions.
 
The solution is simple; it starts with reducing lawn areas and oversized plants 
so that you don’t have to trim and mow as much, using hand tools whenever 
you can, and avoiding pesticides and herbicides. Check out Chapter 20 for 
more tips on eliminating power equipment and Chapter 21 for info on cutting 
out the chemicals.
Noise pollution
Isn’t a garden supposed to be a peaceful sanctuary — a place to escape from 
the racket and hubbub of the outside world? Of course. But gas-powered 
garden equipment destroys that lovely calm.
In most neighborhoods you hear the incessant din of blowers, mowers, 
edgers, weed whackers, and all the other gas-powered weapons of horticul-
ture that we need because our properties are filled with lawns and overfed, 
oversized plants.
 
The bottom line: By making the garden a more stable system, and by eliminat-
ing the power tools for the little work there is, you not only eliminate fossil 
fuel use and pollution, you also help to make the neighborhood quieter. On 
top of that, performing gardening tasks manually is better exercise for you. 
See Chapter 20 for alternatives to power garden equipment.
Paying Attention to What’s 
in the Materials You Buy
One of the best ways to mess up your sustainable game plan is to mindlessly 
drive over to your local garden-supply store and get a bunch of the same old 
stuff without asking yourself or the clerks where it came from and what the 
impacts of the purchase will be, both in your landscape and at the source of 
the materials. You need to ensure that you’re keeping your impact on the 
environment to a minimum.

36
Part I: Sustainable Landscaping: The Basics 
Additionally, some of the building materials common to landscaping projects 
present toxicity problems such as offgassing of chemicals into the atmo-
sphere, leaching them into the soils, and in some cases presenting significant 
risks to people and animals through direct contact. And don’t forget toxicity 
to the workers who make and use the materials. Table 2-2 shows some toxic 
and harmful landscape materials and their nontoxic alternatives.
Table 2-2 
Toxic Materials and Alternatives
Toxic (or Suspected Toxic) Material
Safer Alternative
Arsenic-treated wood
ACQ-treated wood, black locust, white 
oak, cedar, redwood, steel
Glues
Alternative glues, mechanical fasteners 
like nails, screws, and bolts
Paints, finishes, and solvents
Low VOC finishes, or best of all, materials 
that don’t need finishing
PVC
High-density polyethylene or other plas-
tics, non-plastic alternatives
Railroad ties
Recycled plastic landscape ties, sal-
vaged timbers
 
Toxic materials are rarely, if ever, necessary. Folks created beautiful gardens 
long before the invention of PVC, solvents, and other harmful materials. 
By choosing natural materials, you end the problem before it begins. 
Environmentally friendlier materials are showing up everywhere these days. 
You’ll often find them at good prices in major chains as well as at local 
suppliers. You also can find more and more specialty stores that carry only 
materials that have been carefully screened for sustainability. And, of course, 
you can always shop online. Visit www.healthybuilding.net and www.
pollutioninpeople.org for even more information. I talk more about 
hardscaping materials in Chapter 12.
Opting for Biological Solutions 
before Technical Ones
As the permaculturists always say: Use biological approaches to landscaping 
before technological ones. (Not sure what a permaculturist is? Check out the 
nearby sidebar, “What’s permaculture?”) In other words, use plants to do the 
job that hardscaping might. For instance, a $50 tree will shade your house 
more effectively than a $5,000 aluminum patio cover. Besides, it also uses no 
energy, absorbs pollution, creates oxygen, provides a home for birds, and 
creates a couple dozen other benefits.

37
 Chapter 2: Making Good Decisions about What to Include in Your Landscape
Plants are naturally solar-powered. The sun, the soil, the atmosphere, and 
the rain provide everything the living landscape needs. In other words, 
long-lived plants don’t need painting, resurfacing, repairs, or replacement. 
And hey, if you plant a hedge instead of installing a wall or fence, the 
neighborhood taggers won’t be able to paint on it.
 
I don’t mean you have to develop a zero-hardscape garden. That’s pretty 
difficult to pull off. But by choosing as many living (biological) elements as 
you can, you optimize the system and save yourself trouble.
What Does It Do? Bringing Purpose 
to Each Element of the Garden
Every element in your landscape should fulfill some purpose. Nothing should 
be there just because some clever advertising made you buy it or because 
you’re trying to impress the neighbors. For example, a ground cover planting 
may help control erosion on a slope, a patio can offer a place for you and 
your family to hang out, and landscape lighting makes your property safer 
at night.
What’s permaculture?
Choosing biological solutions before techno-
logical ones and stacking functions (making 
each element serve multiple purposes) are 
ideas that come from the rich and fascinating 
world of permaculture. Developed in the 1970s 
in Australia, permaculture is a design system 
much like sustainable landscaping. The term is 
difficult to define, but many practitioners have 
taken a shot. For example, here’s one definition 
by Graham Bell in the book The Permaculture 
Way (Permanent Publications, 2005):
 
 “Permaculture is the conscious design and 
maintenance of agriculturally productive 
systems which have the diversity, stability, 
and resilience of natural ecosystems. It is 
the harmonious integration of the land-
scape with people providing their food, 
energy, shelter, and other material and 
non-material needs in a sustainable way.”
It sounds a lot like sustainable landscaping, 
doesn’t it? Well, it is — with an added emphasis 
on using our gardens to provide food and fulfill 
other needs. After all, is there any good reason 
not to use your property to grow food and offer 
up other tangible benefits? (For resources on 
permaculture, see the appendix.)

38
Part I: Sustainable Landscaping: The Basics 
Many landscape elements serve more than one purpose. That ground cover 
isn’t only holding the slope. It’s also providing nectar for the bees, producing 
oxygen, and perhaps adding fragrance to be enjoyed by people. In the 
permaculture world (see the nearby sidebar “What’s permaculture?”), getting 
multiple benefits out of one action or element is called stacking functions.
When your entire landscape is composed of things that serve one or more 
purposes, and when all the elements are skillfully combined into a single, 
highly-functioning whole, you’ll have a landscape system that offers maxi-
mum benefit to you and to the environment. So when you’re making choices 
of what to put in your new landscape, run things through the “What does it 
do?” filter. You’ll be glad you did.
 
Sometimes the answer to the “What does it do?” question can be, “It makes me 
really happy” or “It’s beautiful.” Don’t feel bad about that. Your happiness is 
important.

 landscaping project calls up numerous resources. This is less true of 
the sustainable landscape, of course, but you still have major demands 
on your time, money, and abilities. If you’re considering doing all or part of 
the work as a do-it-yourself project, you need to get an idea of how much 
time and energy you have. You also need to examine your ability to do the 
work. And if you plan to work with professionals in the design and construc-
tion of the project, it really helps to know who the players are and how to 
work with them. In this chapter, I fill you in on all this and more.
Assessing Your Skill Set: 
Are You Ready for This?
You may come to your landscaping project as a seasoned landscaper or 
maybe even as a professional. On the other hand, you may not know what a 
rake is used for. Whatever your skill level, you need to inventory what you 
bring to the project and then decide how much to do yourself and how much 
to hire out. In this section, you do a little self-evaluation.
 
You may find some aspects of your latest project pleasant (or even fun), but you 
may dread others. Tackle the ones you’re enthusiastic about and hire out 
the rest.

Part I: Sustainable Landscaping: The Basics 
What are your design skills?
 
Sustainable landscape design differs from ordinary landscape design in that 
you have to carefully plan for functionality, and you have to have a deep sensi-
tivity to the site to make that functionality happen. In other words, you have 
to be more aware and think differently to achieve sustainability. You don’t 
have to be a genius, though; you just have to consider a lot of things that you 
may never have thought of. I get to that in Part II. For now, think in terms of 
doing what I like to call deep design — applying your best thinking to planning 
your new landscape on many levels.
You won’t just be decorating your yard; you’ll be developing a complex 
ecosystem that’s finely tuned to operate smoothly with minimal effort or 
resources, an ecosystem that’s productive as well as beautiful and is also 
good for the larger environment. Deep design is trickier than simply figuring 
out which plants look pretty together and whether to buy the blue or the 
mauve cushions for the patio furniture. This concept may seem overwhelm-
ing at first, but you can get the hang of it quickly.
In the following list, I introduce some of the talents and resources you may 
bring to the design phase of your landscaping project. You need these design 
chops if you’re going to figure out the whole project on your own, but they’re 
handy even if you plan to hire a professional landscape architect or designer. 
It never hurts to be well informed. You can read all about these skills in Part 
II of the book.
 
✓ An eye for detail: The small things seem to make the difference between 
an average job and a great one. Details are also what make a project sus-
tainable. Choosing a shrub that’s the right size, for instance, eliminates 
the need to prune constantly.
 
✓ The willingness to spend time really understanding your property: 
To achieve sustainability in your landscape, you need to know what 
you’re working with. Moving around your land, observing with a high 
level of awareness, and researching the environmental conditions 
present on your property all inform your design work and help you 
create a landscape that’s tuned to your actual circumstances.
 
✓ A feeling for the laws of natural systems: By understanding how a 
natural ecosystem works — the interactions among soil, climate, plants, 
microorganisms, insects, and animals — you’re better prepared to 
create your own ecosystem.
 
✓ A basic knowledge of the universal principles of design: Certain 
rules are fundamental to all kinds of design, not just landscaping. 
Following these rules helps you create a landscape that looks as if it 
were professionally done.

 Chapter 3: Deciding Whether to Do It Yourself or Call in the Pros
 
✓ Good taste: Taste is subjective, of course. And I suppose most people 
think they have good taste (even the ones with the paisley golf slacks or 
the plastic flowers tied to their shrubbery). But an artist’s eye helps you 
take the design principles to a higher level.
 
✓ A love of plants and living things: Passion may not be a design skill, 
strictly speaking, but without it your work suffers from mediocrity. It’s 
safe to say you bought this book because you love gardens, so use your 
enthusiasm to push your design to its highest and best level.
 
✓ Some basic drafting skills (optional): You don’t need to be an artist — 
you’re going to be making a beautiful garden, not pictures of a beautiful 
garden — but it helps to be able to draw a plot plan of your project and 
lay out your ideas on paper before committing to them in the real world.
What are your construction skills?
If you’re planning to do some or all of a project’s construction work yourself, 
it certainly helps to know how. Many basic tasks of landscaping may seem 
like menial work to you — shoveling, digging holes and trenches, and grading 
soil, for example — but even they must be done properly to achieve success. 
Other landscape elements, such as constructing arbors, patios, and walls or 
installing irrigation and lighting, require different skills: carpentry, electrical, 
plumbing, and others.
I give you tips along the way, but no book can provide hands-on experience. 
Be realistic about your ability level, and don’t let your ego get in the way of 
calling in professional help when you’re really not up to a task. Or consider 
trading skills with a friend who really knows how to do the work you need. 
Working side-by-side with an experienced person is much more fun than 
struggling through it alone.
 
Without a professional level of construction skill and talent, you’re better off 
limiting yourself to things that don’t take years to learn, such as planting, 
doing some kinds of irrigation work, mulching, and the like. You still save a 
heap of money, and you make a meaningful contribution to the job without 
compromising its quality.
How hard can you work?
 
I’m not going to be coy about this: Landscaping is hard work. Working smart 
can save you a lot of energy and body aches. Be sure to work safely, and take 
a look at some ways to make the work easier and to save money on chiroprac-
tor bills:

42
Part I: Sustainable Landscaping: The Basics 
 
✓ Lift with your legs, not your back. In other words, squat down to lift 
heavy things; don’t bend over at the waist.
 
✓ Don’t overestimate your strength. This advice especially rings true 
for you guys. Men — myself included — tend to think that they’re all 
weightlifting champions. Dude, you’re not that buff, okay? Get help if 
you need it. Some things are just too heavy to lift alone.
 
✓ Use the right tool for the job. Shovels are made for digging, not for 
prying out tree stumps. Why bust a perfectly good tool or a perfectly 
good back when you could have picked up the digging bar and let its 
weight and strength do the work for you?
If for some reason you aren’t able to do heavy labor, you’re better off hiring 
someone.
Determining the Time and Money 
You Can Devote to a Project
Quality landscaping can be a substantial investment. If you landscape your 
entire property, assuming you live on a typical suburban lot, you’ll spend 
between $10,000 and $30,000 on materials and that much again in labor if 
you hire the work out to licensed professionals. However, you can spend 
much less on materials if you use what’s on site and tap the waste stream for 
materials such as broken concrete and salvaged timbers. The trick is to have 
a satisfying, durable end result that justifies what you’ve put into it — in 
terms of both time and money. In the following sections, I help you get an 
idea of how much time and money you can expect to devote to a sustainable 
landscaping project.
Considering the amount of time you have
If you hire a landscaping company to do a major landscaping project, that 
company will send a crew of maybe four or five people who, depending on 
the scope of the work, will put in perhaps 1,200 hours of time. Divide that by 
the 10 hours you’ll realistically have on the weekends, and you’re in for a 
rude awakening. That comes out to 120 weekends, which is about 3 to 5 years 
of work time, depending on how much rain or snow you get where you live. Is 
that what you had in mind?
How much of this project are you really going to do? You may want to put in 
some plants, spread some mulch, and maybe do a brick walkway yourself. 
But unless you’re qualified, hire a landscaping company to take care of the 
complicated or labor-intensive tasks — heavy grading, woodwork, and 
masonry structures to name a few.

43
 Chapter 3: Deciding Whether to Do It Yourself or Call in the Pros
Keeping cost in mind
The amount of money you need to spend depends on a number of factors. 
Check out Chapter 1 for some more budgeting advice, and keep these 
elements in mind as you tabulate costs:
 
✓ Location: Prices are generally higher in big cities and where property 
values are high. Regional prices vary considerably.
 
✓ Size: Naturally, the larger your property, the more you’ll spend.
 
✓ Who does the work: Doing the job yourself can save you 30 to 80 
percent.
 
✓ The company you hire: Bids from landscape professionals can vary by 
100 percent or more, depending on the company’s experience, size, 
overhead, distance from the job, and yes, your attitude.
 
✓ The amount of hardscape you want: Hardscape (the stuff made with 
concrete and rebar and lumber) is way more expensive per square foot 
of landscaped area than plants are.
As a rule of thumb, count on spending anywhere from $20,000 to $70,000 on 
the average complete landscaping job for a typical property. Landscaping is a 
major investment.
 
Sustainable landscaping can cost less — sometimes much less — than conven-
tional landscaping, especially if you stick with a primarily plant-based project. 
But the best news of all is that by landscaping sustainably, you save a huge 
amount in maintenance costs for the life of the project, which is where the real 
expenses are.
Looking into Your Toolbox: 
Stuff You Need
Landscaping tools are fairly basic, and chances are that you already have a 
lot of what you need in your garage just waiting to be put to work. In this 
section, I go through some main landscaping tools. If you don’t know what 
some of this stuff is, take the list to your local hardware store, and the 
workers there can help you out.
 
You don’t need to go out and buy all the tools you don’t have — many of them 
can be rented. Renting makes more sense, especially when tools are used 
for one project and then left to sit in the garage for years. Such a waste of 
resources! (However, do invest in a few good maintenance tools, which you’ll 
be using over and over again.)

44
Part I: Sustainable Landscaping: The Basics 
 
Whenever you’re working outdoors, be sure to include the most important 
tools of all: plenty of sunscreen and a hat. Sunburns aren’t limited to the 
beach — and they make landscape work even tougher.
Creating a plan with some design tools
Landscape architects have cool drafting equipment, including computer-
based drafting software, but you don’t need that much to develop a good 
landscape design. In fact, good design is about thinking, not about drawing 
pretty pictures. And all you need to think is your brain.
But if you’re willing and able, drawing plans does help for a variety of reasons 
that I get into in Chapter 6. You can draw a reasonably effective plan on a 
piece of paper taped to the kitchen table, using a yardstick and an old 
chewed-up number 2 pencil. But frankly, planning is a lot easier if you’re 
equipped with a few decent drafting tools. Here’s what you need:
 
✓ An architect’s scale (one that’s divided into quarters and halves, not the 
engineer’s scale that’s divided into tenths)
 
✓ A circle template that goes up to about 2 inches in diameter
 
✓ A compass
 
✓ Drafting paper (vellum with a grid of eight light blue lines per inch)
 
✓ A drawing board (at least 24 x 36 inches, but bigger is better)
 
✓ A medium-hard pencil (number 2 is fine) and an eraser
 
✓ Two tape measures (a 20-foot-long one and a 100-foot-long one)
 
✓ A roll of inexpensive tissue paper, which we dignified professionals call 
bumwad, for sketching over your base sheet
 
✓ A T-square
 
✓ Two drafting triangles (a 45-degree triangle and a 30-60-90-degree 
triangle)
 
The truly sustainable thing to do is borrow the stuff you need from this list. 
You may know someone who has a drafting set or at least some of the items 
you need. Buy him a six-pack and take his tools home for a while. If that 
doesn’t work, you can find all these items at a drafting or artist supply store.
To arms! Grading, earthmoving, 
and planting tools
When you need to move large amounts of soil or other earthen matter, do 
not — I repeat — do not go buy a tractor. If you really need one, you can rent 

45
 Chapter 3: Deciding Whether to Do It Yourself or Call in the Pros
a tractor. But think long and hard about even doing that. Tractors burn nasty 
fossil fuels and belch pollution, and they keep you from having the deeply 
meaningful experience of shoveling soil into a wheelbarrow day after day. 
Sustainable landscaping means minimal dependence on powered equipment. 
You don’t have to become a fossil-free zealot, but use human power when 
you can. Sure, shoveling isn’t as much fun as driving a tractor, but just think 
how fit you’ll be!
The following list shows some basic muscle-powered tools that can get you 
through the majority of your earth-related tasks:
 
✓ Round-point shovel for planting and general digging
 
✓ Square-point shovel for scooping things up
 
✓ Small hand trowel with an ergonomically curved handle
 
✓ Digging bar (a long, heavy steel bar with a wide blade on one end and a 
tamper on the other) to make breaking up hard soil a lot easier
 
✓ Mattock or pulaski (these are different versions of a combination axe 
and wide digging blade) for chopping, trenching, and loosening
 
✓ Iron rake to move and smooth soil
 
✓ Wide landscaping rake to really smooth soil
 
✓ Wheelbarrow (the heavy-duty contractor kind) or, for some uses, a 
two-wheeled garden cart
 
✓ Four-tine pitchfork for moving mulch
 
✓ Push broom
 
✓ Gloves and a pair of good, sturdy boots
Old, ugly tools work just as well as new ones, so getting them at a garage 
sale — or borrowing them from a friend — is fine.
 
Long-handled tools are much easier on the back than short-handled ones. If 
you have to buy tools, be sure you buy ones that are of high quality — they do 
a better job and last longer (which is very sustainable).
Handling hardscape: Construction gear
If you’re building a hardscape, you need some construction equipment. What 
you need depends on the type of work you’re doing. I break it down for you 
in Table 3-1.

Consider having skill- and tool-intensive projects like concrete pouring and 
finishing done by a qualified professional. A professional job may not cost any 
more when you consider the investment in tools that’s required to do it your-
self. Plus, the pros will likely do a better job, and they guarantee their work.
Water workhorses: Getting the irrigation 
tools you need
 
The truly sustainable landscape doesn’t need an irrigation system, and 
depending on your climate, this ideal may be easily attainable for you. In 
drier climates, though, it’s difficult to have a nice garden without some supple-
mental watering, which is best accomplished with a well-designed, water-
conserving irrigation system. The following tools can get you through a typical 
irrigation system installation:
 
✓ Pipe shears: These special cutters do a bang-up job on plastic pipe.
 
✓ Pressure gauge: You use this tool only once, so borrow one from your 
supplier if possible.

47
 Chapter 3: Deciding Whether to Do It Yourself or Call in the Pros
 
✓ Small screwdriver or proprietary tool: Use these for adjusting sprinkler 
heads.
 
✓ Trenching shovel: A special narrow shovel for digging trenches.
 
✓ Two pairs of tongue-and-groove pliers: These are handy for tightening 
threaded connections. (You need two pairs because you have to twist 
the two pieces you’re fitting together in opposite directions.)
For more on irrigation, see Part III.
Gathering tools for sustainable 
maintenance
When I look at garden catalogs, I have to marvel at how little of the stuff 
they sell is really necessary to manage a well-designed garden. After all, 
by developing a stable, sustainable landscape, you eliminate most of the 
maintenance and most of the tools that go with it.
For routine maintenance, you really need just a few key tools:
 
✓ Hoses: Black ones disappear into the shadows of your garden better 
than green ones. Rubber ones last longer and are somewhat less harmful 
to the environment than vinyl ones. You can pick up a good hose for 
around $25.
 
✓ Hose nozzle: Get a high-quality one with multiple settings, which allow 
you to wash off insects, water plants, fill your pond, mist your ferns, 
wash the pooch, and squirt the kids all with one tool. A nice nozzle sets 
you back $10.
 
✓ Pair of high-quality loppers or a folding pruning saw: These tools 
come in handy for occasionally cutting a branch bigger than your 
pruners can handle. You can get a quality lopper for $30 and a folding 
pruning saw for about $20.
 
✓ Pair of quality pruning shears: A good pair costs you around $50.
 
✓ Push broom and a leaf rake: You need these only if you’re the tidy sort, 
and at most they cost $30 or so.
 
✓ Push mower: If you do have a lawn, consider a push mower instead of a 
gas- or electric-powered one. An old-fashioned scythe works, too (after 
you get the hang of it). Or get a goat, for that matter.
 
✓ Weeding tool of some kind: I like to use an asparagus knife, which costs 
$7 or less.
That’s it. Take the money you would have spent on power gadgets and go 
have a nice vacation somewhere.

Part I: Sustainable Landscaping: The Basics 
You don’t need anything else if you’ve successfully created a sustainable 
landscape that’s easy to care for. You won’t be pruning to control size (your 
plants are the right size already), you won’t be trimming hedges (you don’t 
have trimmed hedges), you won’t be mowing the lawn (you have a meadow 
instead), you won’t be spraying for pests (your plants are pest-resistant), and 
you won’t be doing much weed control (the mulch and tall plants smother 
the weeds). If your trees need pruning, stay safely on the ground and let a 
professional care for them. The bottom line? You’ve set up a system that’s 
easy to live with, so now’s the time to start enjoying it!
Turning to Landscape Professionals
If you’re a die-hard do-it-yourselfer, don’t be afraid to tackle your whole land-
scaping project by yourself. This book won’t make a seasoned landscape 
architect or contractor out of you, but it gives you the information you 
need to be successful. It also warns you about doing anything that’s really 
dangerous.
There’s a time and place to turn to professionals for help with the design or 
construction of your landscape. Noticing your weak spots and getting help 
is key. A good landscape architect or garden designer can turn out a better 
landscape design than you probably can, and the fees can be a good invest-
ment in creating a project that costs much less to maintain over time. 
Similarly, a qualified landscape contractor can get the job done better, faster, 
and sometimes cheaper.
 
Be sure to hire professionals who have expertise in truly sustainable landscap-
ing; everyone claims to be “green,” but actual skill levels vary tremendously. 
Ask for references and look at completed projects to be sure your candidates 
do things the sustainable way.
In the following sections, I fill you in on who the various landscape profes-
sionals are and how you can find the ones you need.
Identifying the players
When you’ve decided that you want to hire professionals to help with all or 
some part of your landscaping project, you have plenty of choices. There are 
lots of players on a landscaping team. Here’s a quick primer (in the order you 
may hire them, from design through construction and maintenance):
 
✓ Landscape architect: A landscape architect is trained to understand and 
practice design on a sophisticated level. That said, not all landscape 
architects are familiar with — or care about — sustainability issues; be 
sure to find one who is. Remember that the landscape architect can 
design your project, but she can’t build it.

49
 Chapter 3: Deciding Whether to Do It Yourself or Call in the Pros
 
✓ Landscape contractor: Most landscape contractors are capable of carry-
ing out a wide range of construction tasks, from grading and planting 
to irrigation, hardscape, lighting, and more. Some contractors have 
good design ideas; others are mainly hired to install what the landscape 
architects design.
 
✓ Gardener: Even sustainable landscapes require some maintenance. 
After your landscaping project is done, you may want to hire a gardener 
to maintain it. Most gardeners aren’t capable of doing much landscaping 
work beyond putting in some plants. Finding qualified gardeners is 
difficult — most have no formal training and are more outdoor house-
keepers than horticulturists. And few of them pay attention to sustain-
able-landscape maintenance.
 
 You may be able to find a reputable gardener by asking your green-
leaning friends about who takes care of their gardens. Some communi-
ties offer sustainability training for gardeners and can provide a list of 
certified graduates; these folks are a better bet than simply picking 
somebody out of the phone book.
 
 Because your new landscape is much easier to care for than a nonsus-
tainable one, you may be able to do most of the maintenance yourself. 
You may need only occasional help for heavy work.
 
✓ Arborist: Specially trained to care for trees, the arborist is a certified 
professional; look for certification by the International Society of 
Arboriculture (ISA).
 
✓ Tree trimmer: Tree trimmers may or may not be certified. Quality of 
care varies widely. A good interview question is whether the tree 
trimmer does tree topping. If the answer is yes, look elsewhere. Topping 
trees is a discredited practice, and no qualified professional does it.
 
 The best approach is to hire a company that sends at least one ISA-
certified person on each job. This way you know you’re getting a 
real pro.
 
✓ Others you may need: In some states, irrigation work must be done by a 
licensed plumber or irrigation contractor. And if you suspect that your 
property has unstable soil or other geological problems, call a consult-
ing geologist. A civil engineer may help you design retaining walls and 
other structures. Pest control problems are best handled by a licensed 
pest control advisor or operator. Be aware that licensure and the exact 
details of these professions vary from place to place.
You may also want to turn to your local nursery for help. Aside from selling 
plants and supplies, nurseries can offer advice on planting design. Another 
possible resource is landscape supply stores, which sell tools, equipment, 
and landscape materials such as gravel, tile, stone, brick, irrigation materials, 
and so on. They can often recommend landscape professionals, too.

50
Part I: Sustainable Landscaping: The Basics 
Finding green professionals
Don’t sabotage yourself by hiring someone who doesn’t share (and work by) 
your sustainable commitment. Instead, find a green (as in environmentally 
friendly) professional.
 
By far the best way to find the right professional is to ask around. Generally 
speaking, the good ones don’t advertise; and the heavy advertisers do so 
because they can’t get referrals. So check with your friends, knock on the door 
of a house with beautiful landscaping, or inquire at your favorite nursery.
When you’re considering working with a landscaper, pay attention to the 
following:
 
✓ Check for commitment to sustainability. Not all professionals under-
stand this stuff. Some will tell you they do things sustainably, but get 
specifics and compare them to the information in this book.
 
✓ Look at their work. Get a list of recent jobs that you can drive by and 
look at. View them in terms of overall quality as well as sustainability.
 
✓ Get references. Ask a couple of current or former clients about prompt-
ness, professionalism, prices, quality of workmanship, and reliability.
 
✓ Get detailed estimates. A proper estimate should have a line item for 
each aspect of the work, and it should differentiate between firm bid 
prices and estimates (sometimes called allowances).
 
✓ Get, and carefully read, specifications for the work. Specifications 
detail precisely what will be done, what materials will be used, and the 
outcome of the work. Get drawings where necessary.
 
✓ Check licenses. Most professionals are required to be licensed. Be sure 
licenses are current and in effect.
 
✓ Get a detailed written contract. Make sure everything is spelled out. 
That way you’re somewhat protected if the professional reneges on his 
or her end of the bargain.
 
✓ Set firm starting and ending dates. But do keep in mind that these dates 
may change for legitimate reasons as the work progresses.

Good Design: The 
Key to Sustainable 
Landscaping

In this part . . .
S
ustainable landscaping begins with careful design. A 
sustainable landscape is a highly tuned system, and it 
doesn’t just happen overnight. It’s the product of really 
getting to know your property and applying some basic 
principles to all the elements of your new landscape. Your 
best thinking during the design portion of the project 
means years of smooth sailing later on because good 
design results in a smoothly functioning landscape that 
demands less of you and the environment than a poorly-
thought-out one would.
In this part, you find out how to analyze your property so 
you understand what it needs. I coach you through the 
design process, showing you how professional landscape 
architects go about turning a nasty-looking yard into a 
sustainable masterpiece. I walk you through the whole 
process step by step, and warn you about pitfalls and 
problems that you may not foresee on your own.

W
hat if I told you I know a technique that can help you design a garden 
that’s more sustainable, more beautiful, and more fun than any you’ve 
ever had? You’d be pretty excited, wouldn’t you? Well, you’re in luck! I’ve got 
the goods: The wonder-cure that can help you create sustainable, beautiful, fun 
gardens is what I call deep design, and it’s simply the practice of combining the 
art of making your landscaping look good with the science of making it work 
properly; it’s design that considers more than just appearance.
Most of what passes for landscape design is about exterior decorating: the 
art of putting pretty plants around in color-appropriate combinations and 
accenting them with attractive lawn furniture and accessories, much as one 
decorates a living room. Skillfully done, exterior decorating can make for 
some lovely effects.
 
There’s nothing wrong with beauty; sustainable landscaping isn’t about creat-
ing ugly gardens. But there’s much more to a sustainable landscape than how 
it looks. How it works is equally important because if the landscape functions 
well, it requires fewer resources and less work, and it has a positive effect on 
the environment instead of harming it as conventional landscapes do.
To build a truly sustainable landscape, you need to have a solid understand-
ing of where you are and what you have to work with — the focus of this 
chapter. Then you can design a landscape system that responds to the many 
conditions of the site and to the laws that govern natural systems.

54
Par t II: Good Design: The Key to Sustainable Landscaping 
Meeting Your Yard: Site Analysis
Site analysis is the first stage of deep design; it’s nothing more than look-
ing critically at your property from many different viewpoints in order to 
develop a list of conditions, problems, needs, and possible design responses 
that govern what you eventually build. Site analysis is more than just rushing 
around making lists, though. You also want to experience subtler aspects of 
the site, such as how you feel in different areas.
Imagine yourself on vacation sitting under some palm trees on a tropical 
beach with your favorite beverage in hand. You’re totally relaxed, and you 
feel a sense of connection with the place. You’re experiencing it with all your 
senses. Doing site analysis is a lot like sitting on that beach. First, you have 
to understand the place itself, which means perceiving it on a deep level. You 
have to slow down enough to see the details, such as how the sun moves 
across the land, how neighboring houses impact your site, and which areas 
feel good to hang out in. You give yourself time to ask and answer important 
questions about your site that will later inform your design decisions. I refer 
to this process as “making friends with the site,” and I consider it one of the 
most important steps on the path to a beautiful, sustainable landscape.
Using a lawn chair, the 
world’s best design tool
If you really want to get to know your site, get yourself a comfortable, light-
weight lawn chair. (No hammocks, please — I want you to be awake for this.) 
Put the chair anywhere in the yard. Then sit down in it and be quiet. Notice 
things. The whole point of this exercise is to stop doing and start perceiving. 
You see, this stage isn’t about design or coming up with answers. For now, 
you want to just absorb as much as possible.
 
As you sit and observe your site, don’t take any paper, drawing boards, cam-
eras, cellphones, laptops, or other technology with you. The goal is to bond 
with your yard, so it should be just you and the yard without distractions.
After a few minutes of quiet contemplation, perceptions of all kinds start to 
pour in. For instance, you may suddenly see the distant tree that could be a 
lovely part of what landscape architects call a borrowed view (a view of some-
thing distant, off your property, that’s good enough to incorporate into what 
you see from key points in your own landscape). Or you may notice the way 
the neighbor’s trees cast a shadow on your lawn at this time of day.
As perceptions come to you, don’t write down anything, and don’t try too 
hard. Just enjoy the process of hanging out, and trust that your perceptions 

55
 Chapter 4: Get ting Bet ter Acquainted with Your Property
will still be in your memory when you’re making design decisions later. After 
you’ve spent some time in your initial spot, move the chair someplace else. 
Move it to somewhere you never thought you’d sit, such as one of the cor-
ners of your yard. Plop down and notice what you perceive from there. Keep 
moving your chair around the yard, staying in each spot for at least 10 min-
utes or until impressions start pouring in.
 
Pay attention to how you feel as you sit in different locations throughout your 
yard. The goal is to find power spots (places where you feel really good and 
want to stay for a while). Finding these spots can help you make design deci-
sions about the major-use areas in your yard. This exercise also helps you 
notice factors that you’ll have to deal with if you want to enjoy that part of 
your property (such as noise from the neighbor’s garage).
Repeat the entire process a few times: at different times of the day, when 
you’re in different moods, and during different kinds of weather. If you really 
want to do this right, take several months or even a whole year for this stage 
of the design process. I suggest spending at least three or four weeks on this 
part of the process, with a minimum of three or four sessions.
Making a record of your impressions
After you’ve had a chance to take it all in from your favorite lawn chair (see 
the preceding section), it’s time to start putting your impressions in some 
physical form, whether you’re making notes, sketching, or taking pictures. 
Put all this information in a folder or binder, which will become Design 
Central for your project. Keep it close at hand because you’ll find yourself 
referring to it and making additions on a regular basis.
The exact content of the binder varies from person to person and from site to 
site, but it should include some or all of the following elements:
 
✓ A bubble diagram showing the basic functions of each area: This dia-
gram helps you through the early design process. For an example and a 
complete explanation of what a bubble diagram is, check out Chapter 6.
 
✓ A list of your favorite plants: Even though choosing plants is one of the 
last steps in designing a landscape, it’s good to begin thinking about it 
now. What plants do you like most? Even if some of them won’t work in 
your yard, thinking about them develops your awareness of the qualities 
of plants and of your own taste. Also note which plants are already in 
your yard and think about whether you want to keep them.
 
✓ Any problems you’ve identified: For example, maybe your neighbors’ 
garage is really close to one of your property lines and their teenager’s 
band practice is annoying. You may not be able to convert the kid to 
your style of music, but you can put up a wall to block the sound a bit.

56
Par t II: Good Design: The Key to Sustainable Landscaping 
 
✓ A list of things you like and dislike about your yard: For instance, has 
it always bothered you that there’s no privacy in your backyard or that 
the kids don’t have a place to play? Bring those issues to the surface. 
Talk to the family about them. Also inventory the good things: that cozy 
place under the elm tree, the handsome Camellia outside the front door, 
your funky-but-productive veggie patch.
 
✓ Articles and pictures that appeal to you in garden books and magazines: 
Seeing how others handle garden design always helps. Gather up as 
many images as you can, especially of situations similar to yours. Read 
the articles so you understand the considerations that went into the 
designs.
 
✓ A list of possible elements to be used in your design (paving materials, 
patio furniture, and so on): Later in the process, you’ll choose specific 
elements. At this stage, shop for prospective materials, keeping sustain-
ability in mind, to develop a palette of possible choices.
 
✓ Photos of your property to look at when you’re developing your ideas: 
Take pictures from the house looking out, from the corners of the prop-
erty looking toward the house, from the street, and from every other 
possible angle. You can even get on the roof. Later you’ll study these 
and sketch over them with tracing paper to see how your ideas play out 
in three dimensions.
 
✓ Photos of gardens in the neighborhood that you like: Walk around the 
’hood to see what your neighbors have been up to. Photos of their yards 
(discreetly taken) can help you think about what you want.
Taking a Closer Look at Your Land
In the following sections, I walk you through some of the many details you 
begin to examine as you take a closer look at your yard. I show you how to deal 
with these details in order to create an effective sustainable design. As you 
gather information, add it to the binder I discuss in the preceding section.
Don’t call it dirt: Soils and 
geological features
As a gardener, you’re concerned with two key aspects of soil: how well the 
soil grows plants and whether the soil is going anywhere anytime soon. You 
may think of these two aspects as fertility and stability, respectively.
A large part of sustainability is developing a thriving, low-care plant commu-
nity, and the basis of this is understanding your soil. For now, just know that 

57
 Chapter 4: Get ting Bet ter Acquainted with Your Property
the qualities of your soil — whether it’s clay or sand, acid or alkaline — in part 
determine your ultimate plant palette. Because you match plants to soil and 
not the other way around, the appearance of your plantings depends on this 
element. In Chapter 16, you find out how to make sustainable plant choices.
Soil is also a base for whatever hardscape you construct. Its ability to sup-
port heavy structures is a factor in the design of those structures. You also 
need to know whether the soil is prone to erosion and other structural prob-
lems. Chapter 14 covers this in detail.
Despite soil’s complexity, you need to focus on only a few simple techniques 
to examine your soil:
 
✓ Look at how plants are growing on the site and in the neighborhood. 
Doing so tells you a lot about the potential of your property. If you notice 
leaves that are stunted or discolored, or if you see plants that are smaller 
than normal or that display unusual growth habits, your soil may be 
poorly drained, its chemistry may be unbalanced, or the living organisms 
in the soil may be compromised. If the existing plants look happy, how-
ever, new plants will probably be happy, too. See Chapter 16 for details.
 
✓ Do a soil test. A soil test is like a blood test; you send a sample to a lab 
for analysis. Conducting this test is especially important if you suspect 
problems or see that plants perform poorly in certain areas. For info on 
the benefits and limitations of soil testing, turn to Chapter 16.
 
✓ Check your internal soil drainage. If you’ve ever had a plant drown 
because water built up in the soil, you already know about internal soil 
drainage (or the lack of it). Most plants like to grow in soil that drains 
away excess water. After the soil pores are filled, the plant really has 
no need for any more water. In normal soils, water simply leaks down 
into the lower soil horizons due to the force of gravity. But some soils 
have an impervious layer of clay or rock present below the surface. This 
layer creates a perched water table, a zone of floating water. Check out 
Chapter 16 for a simple way to test your internal soil drainage as well as 
sustainable (and easy) approaches to handling poor drainage.
 
✓ Check the stability of your soil. Are the trees and telephone poles in 
your area leaning over at crazy angles? Are there parallel cracks in the 
soil? Is there a history of earth movement in the neighborhood? If so, 
call your local consulting geologist for an evaluation of the stability of 
your property. A consultation can cost you $200 to $400, but it just may 
save you the price of an uninsured mudslide.
 
 Adding plants and water to an unstable site can cause a catastrophic 
landslide, which won’t be covered by your insurance policy. Causing 
a landslide isn’t very sustainable, is it?

58
Par t II: Good Design: The Key to Sustainable Landscaping 
 
✓ Pay attention to surface erosion. If runoff water is concentrated so that 
it runs across your land, there’s a good chance that the soil will begin to 
wash away. This process, called surface erosion, can be difficult to stop 
after it starts. You can use various strategies to prevent surface erosion. 
I explain these in Chapter 14. For now, just know that you need to look 
for signs of erosion — soil washing away and gullies of any size — and 
make repairing them a high priority.
Over the river and through the 
woods: Terrain and landform
Is your property level or sloping? Hilly or smooth? Rocky? Steep? Are the 
human-made landforms appealing and functional, or do they need to be 
changed? Where does the water go? When you’re planning your landscape, 
you need to consider all these questions.
 
Making conscious changes to landform can give you a major environmental 
payoff: being able to use your land to harvest rainwater, which I cover in 
Chapter 8. Bad decisions about landform can result in flooding of your house 
or neighboring properties, poor plant performance, or even landslides. If 
you’re planning to make major changes in your terrain, work with a landscape 
architect, landscape contractor, or grading contractor so you get it right.
If your land is hilly, pay particular attention to the following:
 
✓ The aspect of the slope (that is, the direction it faces): In the Northern 
Hemisphere, an east-facing slope gets only morning sun, so you’ll have 
a cool place for plants and people. A west-facing slope, however, will be 
quite hot on summer afternoons. South-facing slopes get all-day sun, and 
north-facing ones are shady and cool.
 
✓ The location of your low and high spots: Cold air drains to low spots, 
which can make for especially chilly areas in winter.
Steep properties may need special help, such as erosion protection and par-
ticular kinds of irrigation. You really need to contact a landscape architect, 
landscape contractor, or a civil engineer to find out how to proceed.
Considering the path of the sun
Landscapers in the Northern Hemisphere always want to know where north 
is because it tells them a lot about the path of the sun during the day and at 
different seasons of the year. The path of the sun affects nearly everything 

59
 Chapter 4: Get ting Bet ter Acquainted with Your Property
about the landscape and is therefore important to consider when you’re 
designing your landscape.
As you know, the sun rises in the east and sets in the west. It travels across 
the sky at a lower arc in winter and a higher arc in summer. The days are 
longer in summer and shorter in winter. This basic information is critical 
because the sun’s path affects not only the growth of plants but also where 
you should place your patios and other areas. For instance, you should posi-
tion your sitting area on the east side of the house if you want to hang out 
there and be warmed by the morning sun. Put it on the north side if you love 
to sit in the shade on hot afternoons.
 
Keeping the sun’s movement in mind, visualize when and where you’ll enjoy 
your home and landscape throughout the day (see Figure 4-1). Go out in your 
yard at different times of the day and make note of where the sun is. Imagine 
where trees, buildings, and so on will cast shade at different times. If you can, 
do this throughout the year so you can get a sense of how the path of the sun 
changes with the seasons.

Assessing your water situation
Water comes in many forms: natural water, applied water, harvested water, 
problem water, and lack of water. Water is obviously important to your land-
scaping. It supplies plants with one of their basic needs, and it can also cause 
damage if you don’t deal with drainage issues. By harvesting rainwater, you 
solve both problems at once. You’re moving water safely away from trouble 
spots like your living room and into parts of your property where it can grow 
plants and reduce your dependence on city water.

60
Par t II: Good Design: The Key to Sustainable Landscaping 
Here are some questions to ask about the water on your property:
 
✓ What’s the annual rainfall in your area, and during what season(s) 
does it rain? This information helps you select plants that are adapted 
to your conditions. It also plays a role in creating outdoor rooms that 
work with your weather patterns.
 
✓ How much snow and ice accumulate in winter, and do the snow and 
ice protect plants or damage them? Snow can insulate plants and 
protect them from damaging winter winds. But too much snow and ice 
can damage your plants, so choose plants that can tolerate whatever 
your winter throws at them.
 
✓ What’s the source of your irrigation water — a municipal water supply 
or a private well? And what’s the quality of that water? Get a water 
report from your water purveyor; it can tip you off to some bad water 
chemistry that may affect plants or damage your irrigation system.
 
✓ Where on the property are the existing plumbing features, such as 
water mains, backflow prevention devices, control valves, and hose 
bibs? When you plan your irrigation system, you need to know what’s 
existing, whether it’s in the right place, and what condition it’s in.
 
 If your water mains are old, your best bet is to replace them before you 
put in your landscaping. Otherwise, you may have to tear the landscaping 
up a year from now when the old galvanized water main finally bursts.
 
✓ During a rain, how does the water move on the site, and how could 
you redirect it to more useful and less damaging locations? Managing 
rainwater helps the environment by reducing flooding and pollution. 
Take a look at Chapter 8 to discover how to make rainwater an asset by 
reducing your need for municipal water.
 
✓ Are there natural water features such as creeks, streams, ponds, and 
springs on the property? If so, lucky you! But do be aware that they can 
also be sources of flooding.
 
✓ Where are the site drains, catch basins, and drainage swales (long, 
shallow ditches)? These carry rainwater safely away from vulnerable 
areas. Make sure they’re working right. Visit Chapter 8 for details of 
drainage systems and a more thorough explanation of these terms.
 
✓ Is runoff from your property causing problems for your neighbors, or 
vice versa? Avoid channeling rainwater onto neighboring properties. 
Determine whether water will be coming onto your land from off-site and 
whether it’ll be an asset or a liability.
 
✓ Is there standing water anywhere you don’t want it on your property? 
If so, consider how you can capture that water where it’ll be of service 
to the system instead of creating problems.

61
 Chapter 4: Get ting Bet ter Acquainted with Your Property
 
Everything on your property is a potential resource. Think of your property as 
one big water catchment device, and then plan out what you can do with all 
that lovely, free water. Putting it to use is more sustainable than treating it as 
a waste product.
Greenery and flowers: Examining 
existing plants
Plants that currently live on your property are important. They’re either an 
asset (they provide shade, protect a slope against erosion, attract butterflies, 
or have any of a hundred good qualities, including that you just like them) or 
a liability (they’re in poor condition, poisonous, unstable, or just ugly). You 
need to make some decisions about what gets to stay and what gets the axe.
Start by considering the location, size, and condition of trees and whether 
they’re native to the area or have been planted by someone. Be sure you 
know the mature size of any young trees on your site and find out whether 
they pose any potential problems, such as instability, greedy or lifting roots, 
brittle limbs, or messy foliage or fruits. Also consider the cost of tree care, 
which can be expensive.
 
Call a certified arborist to give you a report on the condition of your trees and 
to do any major pruning or removals before you put in the rest of the land-
scaping. (See Chapter 17 for more information on trees.)
 
Look beyond the boundaries of your property and identify potential problem 
trees in neighboring yards. Your neighbors’ tree roots may be poised to visit 
your garden. If they do, the tree may suck away the water and nutrients that 
your plants need, and they may even crack that nice, new patio you’re plan-
ning to build.
If a tree is in a bad location, decide whether to take it out or make adjust-
ments to your design. It’s easy to believe that keeping a tree is always better 
for the environment than removing it, but that’s not necessarily the case. 
It depends on whether the whole system is better off with it in place. For 
instance, if a tree will cause problems for the entire property by sucking all 
the water out of the soil so that nothing else can grow there, you may be 
better off taking it out. (Unless it’s a native tree; those are generally sacred.)
After examining the trees on your lot, look at the existing shrubs and other 
plants in the same way, assessing each for condition, suitability, and proper 
placement. Then make decisions about their fates. I recommend keeping 
desirable plants, especially natives, that have a clean bill of health, are in the 

62
Par t II: Good Design: The Key to Sustainable Landscaping 
right place, and pass the adorableness test. Consider removing invasive and 
problematic plants, plants in poor health, and poisonous plants (use garden-
ing books and online resources to identify common poisonous plants and 
eliminate this hazard). Part V provides more advice for selecting and main-
taining plants.
You may find a whole section of your yard where nothing seems to grow. It 
may be a sort of Bermuda Triangle for plants. Find out whether the perfor-
mance problems are due to soil issues, pathogens, heavy competition from 
neighboring trees, or other factors. Correct the problems or find plant variet-
ies that are tough enough to survive the trying conditions.
Room with a view: Making the 
most of your surroundings
Take a look outside from in your house, especially from those rooms you use 
the most. What are the pleasant and unpleasant views, and what’s the poten-
tial for creating focal points that are attractive from inside?
Most people spend 80 percent of their lives indoors, so the views of your 
garden from inside are at least as important as how it looks when you’re out 
in it. Look at your surroundings from outside too. Choose vantage points that 
may end up being use areas. If you have an unpleasant view, you can screen 
it with structures or plants. You can “borrow” attractive views by preserving 
or creating openings that frame a distant mountain, lake, or stately tree.
Eyeing existing structures 
and development
Unless you’re starting with an empty lot, you need to consider how your 
house and other existing structures fit into the big design picture, and then 
you have to decide whether to keep, modify, or eliminate them. Each struc-
ture affects the project, even if only because its mass creates small areas that 
provide welcome shelter for plants or make an otherwise usable area dank 
and unpleasant. Additionally, new landscape plantings and structures can 
affect the climate and light levels inside your house.

63
 Chapter 4: Get ting Bet ter Acquainted with Your Property
Here are some things to observe about your house and other buildings on 
the property, utilities, and other human-made features. Make a list of answers 
to these questions:
 
✓ Where are the house and other buildings located? Evaluate how your 
house will affect the landscaping and vice versa. Determine whether 
buildings will provide opportunities, such as leaving a sunny area for 
a patio, or create problems, such as becoming a fire hazard because of 
placement at the top of a slope.
 
✓ What’s the orientation of the house with respect to the compass? The 
sun moves in a specific and predictable way each day, and each room of 
your house is exposed to the sunlight in a unique way. Your landscape 
can work to make the house more comfortable. You may want to shade 
the east and west sides to protect against hot morning and evening sun, 
for instance.
 
✓ How tall are the buildings and other structures, and how will they 
shade the property at various seasons and times of day? The sun’s path 
is low in the sky in winter, expanding the shadow that the house casts on 
the north side of the landscape. And the pool of shade moves throughout 
the day. Remember that a two-story house casts more shade than a single-
story one. Place use areas where they’ll get sun in cool seasons and shade 
in summer, and site other features for optimum performance.
 
✓ What do each of the house’s rooms look out on? What you do in the 
landscape has to relate to how the house works. Putting a patio outside 
the garage is silly, but it makes sense to have a patio outside the living 
room. High-use areas should be away from bedrooms.
 
✓ What’s the condition of the structures on your property? If they need 
work, get it done before you put in the new landscaping.
 
✓ What’s the architectural style of your house? Match the style of your 
landscaping to that of your house. A Japanese garden plopped down in 
front of a Southern colonial mansion looks quite silly.
 
✓ Where are the doors, and how will people move from inside to out-
side? Place landings, patios, and paths in good relationship to the traffic 
patterns inside the house.
 
✓ How wide are overhangs, and will they leave some planters dry when 
it rains? This means you’ll have to water those areas even during the 
rainy season.
 
✓ Are there gutters, or does rain fall directly on the beds? Gutters carry 
water away from the house (good) but usually deposit it where it goes 
to waste (bad). Rain sluicing off the roof and crashing onto planter beds 
can damage plants and soil, and it can damage the house by saturating 
the soil around it.

64
Par t II: Good Design: The Key to Sustainable Landscaping 
 
✓ Where are the gas, water, and power sources? Locate gas mains, drilled 
wells or town water mains, overhead or underground electric lines, tele-
phone lines, and power outlets. You obviously want to avoid hitting these 
during construction, and you also want to avoid planting trees directly 
over them. If you have overhead electric, telephone, and cable wires, you 
may want to put them underground before you landscape.
 
✓ Where are existing site improvements — such as patios, decks, and 
paths — and are they desirable? If you have a poorly situated patio or 
a path that nobody walks on, consider making changes. You can often 
reuse the salvaged material.
 
✓ Where are landscape lights, and do they illuminate effectively? Are 
there hot spots where light fixtures blind you rather than illuminate the 
property? Is the safety and security lighting adequate and in good work-
ing condition? Where are there dark zones that need to be lit?
 
✓ Where do vehicles park? Cars may be unsustainable, but they’re every-
where, and you need to accommodate them. Make sure parking areas 
are safe, out-of-sight (if possible), and reasonably close to the house. 
Connect the parking areas to the house via smooth, well-lit paths with as 
few stairs as possible.
 
✓ Which existing features can be repaired or repurposed? It’s definitely 
more sustainable to save anything that’s useful. Figure out how you can 
transform a shabby but basically sound element into something really cool.
 
✓ What’s on your site that you could use to make new improvements? 
Every site at least has soil to work with, which you can use to make cob 
or adobe walls, seats, and other structures. You may also have beautiful 
stones or boulders, you can turn into dry streambeds or garden walls. 
If you’re planning to remove a tree, it may be possible to mill it into 
lumber that you can use for garden structures. Reusing, repurposing, 
and recycling are at the very heart of sustainability. (See Chapter 2 for 
more details on scouring your yard for reusable materials.)
Designing around nice 
and not-so-nice neighbors
Recognize that your yard is part of the neighborhood. Identify its place in local 
traffic patterns, in neighborhood land use patterns, and in the overall context 
of your community. For example, are you in a historical neighborhood that 
requires special landscape treatment? Do adjacent buildings create problems 
such as shading or heavy vehicle traffic? Are there trouble spots nearby that 
may hamper your enjoyment of your own property? Even though these factors 
don’t relate to sustainability, you need to take them into account.

65
 Chapter 4: Get ting Bet ter Acquainted with Your Property
Don’t forget about the people who live around you. I have a theory about neigh-
bors. Consider this: The typical suburban lot has five immediate neighbors — 
one on each side, one directly behind, and two in the back corners. Now I 
figure that about 20 percent of the people in this world are — how can I say 
this? — jerks. So the odds are that you’re going to have one troublesome 
neighbor who has family spats out on the deck, keeps wildebeests in the 
backyard, or rebuilds antique construction cranes in the driveway. Or you 
may have one who’s contentious, contrary, litigious, nosy, noisy, messy, con-
stantly drunk, or otherwise offensive in some way. And because jerks don’t 
realize that they’re jerks, they hardly ever change.
 
Be careful where you place that patio. You may regret your decision (and 
ripping up concrete and throwing it in the dumpster isn’t very sustainable). 
Consider a solid block wall where needed to hide the distractions, and prac-
tice sustainable patience and loving kindness as best you can.
Paying attention to privacy
Some properties naturally lend themselves to taking in their surroundings — 
it’s hard to turn your back on a splendid view. Other sites may lack views or 
be surrounded by undesirable elements; these sites can be developed inward 
to create a private world.
Regionally, attitudes about the privacy of people’s yards vary a lot. In many 
places, it’s considered uncool to put a fence around your property. In others, 
it’s just the opposite. Neighborhoods that are denser and more urban tend 
toward privacy, whereas rural areas are more open. If your house and your 
neighbor’s house are too close for comfort, you may want to plant trees 
between the buildings in an attempt to develop a buffer.
How’s the weather? Closing in on climate
Climate affects nearly every aspect of the sustainable landscape. Choose 
strategies that are best adapted to your climate so that not only is the end 
result more useful, but it also makes fewer demands on resources. Tuning 
your design in to the local climate can even make your house more comfort-
able and save energy inside. For example, you can determine where the pre-
vailing winds come from and use that information to locate outdoor rooms 
in calmer areas, develop windbreak plantings to improve overall conditions 
on the property, and perhaps even funnel summer winds onto your land for 
natural cooling.

66
Par t II: Good Design: The Key to Sustainable Landscaping 
 
An important application for climate data is in selecting plants that will 
survive and thrive. This consideration is so critical that all gardening and 
landscaping literature, sustainably oriented or not, addresses it in detail. 
One of the most important pieces of information about any given plant is its 
hardiness, which is how well it tolerates cold. (Despite the connotations of 
the term, it isn’t about overall toughness.) Every plant used in horticulture is 
ranked for its hardiness, using hardiness zone maps to indicate what degree of 
cold it tolerates. You can locate your community on the map, see which zone 
you’re in, and then pick plants that work for you.
The most common hardiness zone map in the U.S. comes from the United 
States Department of Agriculture (USDA); you can find it find online at www.
usna.usda.gov/Hardzone/ushzmap.html. Canadians can use the one at 
nlwis-snite1.agr.gc.ca/plant00/index.phtml. You can find similar 
maps for many other parts of the world.
 
One special map system is the Sunset zone system. It’s more sophisticated 
than the USDA map because it incorporates data on rainfall, high and low 
temperatures, humidity, and growing seasons. Many gardeners in the U.S. 
and parts of Canada depend on it. To find a map for your area, go to www.
sunset.com and search for “zone map.”
Deciding What You Want 
from Your Property
After you’ve surveyed your property and its surroundings, it’s time to look 
inward to the needs and desires of yourself and your family. If your design 
takes the environment into account but ignores your personal needs, it’s a 
failure. In this section, you get to be selfish (in an altruistic and sustainable 
way, of course).
Don’t forget to involve the other family members, including kids. Assuming 
they’re willing, everyone will probably enjoy the process, you’ll like the com-
pany, and the eventual outcome will be better suited to everyone because 
they’ve played a role in it. Besides, you won’t have to take all the blame when 
something goes haywire.
It’s all about you: Identifying your needs
To get a design that suits you, you simply have to ask what you want from it. 
For example, maybe you want your landscape to include gardens for growing 
food, a wildlife viewing area, compost areas, nap zones, and so on.

67
 Chapter 4: Get ting Bet ter Acquainted with Your Property
 
Make a list that’s just right for you. If you don’t know what you want, you’ll 
probably never get it, and you’ll be missing out on some great experiences. To 
make your list, draw a line down the center of a piece of paper and write your 
needs and desires on the left side of the page. Then to the right of each entry, 
write down the kind of physical features you think could meet them and indi-
cate where they may go on the property.
Don’t worry if you don’t have all the answers. You’re in the midst of going 
from the general to the specific, and it’s okay not to know everything yet. The 
design process takes time. Allow yourself to think freely and dream big, as if 
you had all the money and resources in the world. You can pare things down 
at a later stage. Whatever you do, don’t cripple your imagination by assuming 
you could never do or afford some particular element.

After you’ve had a chance to get to know your property, you’ll probably have 
a list of problems as well as a list of dreams. For example, you may have 
found that the chickens next door make too much noise. This is a problem 
because you were planning to put a patio nearby, and there’s something 
about all that clucking that just drives you nuts. You know you won’t be 
happy with the noise, but you don’t see another place in your yard where the 
patio will work. Limitations like this one crop up on every project.
Solving project problems and limitations can be tricky and often involves 
tradeoffs, such as living with the chicken clucking or tolerating a patio in 
a less-than-ideal location. However, a little outside-the-box thinking can 
sometimes provide you with a solution that offers unexpected benefits, so 
inventory your possible workarounds. For instance, you may put in a foun-
tain that’s pleasantly loud enough to mask the chicken noise, with the added 
benefits of cooling off the otherwise warm patio, being a lovely focal point, 
and providing habitat for dragonflies, fish, and birds. Another approach may 
be to build a solid, noise-blocking masonry wall on that side of the yard. 
Combine the wall with the fountain and the patio, and you have a very fine 
outdoor room that’s better than your original design thanks to those darn 
chickens. Whatever the source of your problem, see whether you can find a 
solution that leaves you with more than just an end to the problem.

Par t II: Good Design: The Key to Sustainable Landscaping 
Determining how much maintenance 
work to create with your design
A sustainable garden is by definition undemanding. But any living system 
requires some care, and you need to consider this important fact now, not 
later, when poor design decisions have left you with a mess that forces you 
to spend way more time and money on maintenance than you ever intended. 
I talk more about the specifics of maintenance in Chapter 20, but for now it’s 
important to realize that the amount of care that your landscaping requires is 
a direct result of design.
Plants that are too big for their allotted space attempt to grow to their geneti-
cally programmed height and width forever. They don’t stop just because 
their roots are growing into your foundation. Plants don’t know what you 
think they’re supposed to do, and they don’t give a hoot about you and your 
silly little landscaping problems. This is just one example of the many ways 
poor design can give you grief.
 
By designing your landscape properly, you short-circuit many of the most 
common problems that go disguised as normal garden care. So during the site 
analysis phase, be sure to answer the following questions:
 
✓ Are you a gardener? What role do you want to play in the ongoing care 
of your garden? Do you love to get out and work in the yard? Are you at 
home when planting things and then nurturing, pruning, and watching 
them grow? Or are you a lazybones who loves to enjoy her garden from 
the hammock or from the recliner in the living room?
 
 There’s no right answer, but if you like to garden, you’ll be unhappy if 
you end up with a static, severely low-maintenance landscape that offers 
no place to putter. On the other hand, there’s nothing worse than a long 
to-do list if you can’t stand working in the yard. Answer this question at 
the site analysis phase so you can tune your design to your anticipated 
role in future stewardship.
 
✓ Will you hire a gardener? Perhaps you have too many things on your 
calendar, and the last thing you need is a set of repetitive tasks to fur-
ther overload you. That’s okay. More and more people are hiring garden-
ing services to care for their yards. Gardeners can be a great way to take 
some of the pressure off. Decide now whether you want to have help 
with garden care, and then approach your design accordingly. (Turn to 
Chapter 3 for more on gardeners.)

▶ Examining the elements of design
▶ Picking up design secrets from the pros
▶ Considering special design situations
▶ Designing a safe landscape
S
ustainable or otherwise, a proper landscape has to look beautiful. And 
to make it look beautiful, you have to rely on the elements of design. You 
may be intimidated by the design aspect of your landscaping project, think-
ing that artsy stuff isn’t your thing. But not only is design easy; it’s also a lot 
of fun. After you get the hang of it, you may find yourself looking for design 
projects everywhere.
In this chapter, I show you some of the age-old principles of design that apply 
to all gardens, and I also provide you with the inside story on some tricks 
that landscape architects use to bring magic to the places they design. (Keep 
in mind that this is a very basic introduction to the complex world of design.)
You’d be correct to ask what all this design info has to do with sustainabil-
ity. Just remember that this chapter is about the visual and aesthetic side of 
design, not so much about how the landscape functions. When you partner 
the principles of sustainable design covered elsewhere in the book with the 
techniques of making beautiful spaces that I discuss here, you’ll end up with 
the beautiful, functional, sustainable landscape that’s the ideal.
Getting an Introduction to Design
Every landscape designer has a “toolbox” of sorts. Inside that toolbox are 
things like color and texture and balance. Each item in the toolbox is a way of 
looking at the arrangement and character of a landscape. These items are the 
elements of design, and if you take them into consideration, your project will 
be that much better for it.

70
Par t II: Good Design: The Key to Sustainable Landscaping 
Chances are that you already understand good design on some level. For 
instance, if you’ve ever arranged furniture in a room, you were using design 
principles to make everything look and work right. You may not have been 
able to state the principles, but you knew them instinctively and acted on 
them. It’s not that large a leap from appreciating a well-designed landscape to 
creating one. Apply the principles that I introduce in the following sections to 
your project, and you can soon see a wonderful garden emerge.
 
Making your landscape safe is a part of good design that you shouldn’t over-
look. You can avoid, eliminate, or prepare for common problems such as killer 
plants and slick sidewalks caused by a poorly-designed irrigation system. Be 
sure to ponder the potential for mayhem when you design, and keep an eye 
out for developing problems as the landscape matures.
 
Be sure to plan for any special accessibility needs. By eliminating steps and 
creating wide and gently sloping paths made of smooth, solid material, people 
at many ability levels can get around easily. Specially designed raised beds 
and planters and unique enabling tools and equipment can make gardening 
possible for folks with all sorts of disabilities, even for those in a wheelchair.
Unity: All the pieces working together
Nothing is more disconcerting than a garden that’s a chaotic mishmash of 
all sorts of plants, ten different paving materials, and too many colors. These 
types of gardens look as if the nursery truck tipped over on its way some-
where else and the plants took root wherever they fell.
A space with unity — one that’s composed of harmonious elements and a 
consistent and comprehensible color scheme — is pleasing to both the eye 
and the mind, and it makes for a place where you want to linger.
How do you create unity? First refer to Figure 5-1 to compare a garden plan 
with good unity to a garden plan with bad unity. Then follow these steps:
 
1. Decide on a style for your garden.
 
 Will your garden be formal, natural, geometric, curvy, rectilinear? You 
can choose whatever style you like and whatever is appropriate to the 
surroundings. I discuss shape and formality in some of the upcoming 
sections, and you can find out more about style in the later section titled 
“Considering style.”
 
2. Choose harmonious plants and hardscape elements.
 
 Make sure the plants and hardscape elements all look good together. 
Then use them repeatedly throughout the design — in the foreground 
and the background to create a sense of depth.

71
 Chapter 5: Brushing Up On Design Basics
 
3. Choose a suitable color scheme.
 
 You wouldn’t wear a hot pink shirt with bright orange pants unless you 
were headed to a Halloween party, right? Well, similarly, being careful to 
coordinate the colors of your plantings, hardscape elements, and house 
helps everything to look attractively harmonious. That’s unity in action. 
(For more on color, turn to the section titled “Color: Letting your land-
scape’s true colors shine through,” later in this chapter).
 
Unless you’re a master of design, keep the number of elements in your plan 
fairly minimal — a few kinds of plants, one or two hardscape materials, and 
not too many precious geegaws. Having too many elements in one composi-
tion drives the mind to distraction, blowing unity to bits.
Balance: Formal versus informal
Balance means maintaining a sense of proportion in your design. In a formal 
garden, you achieve balance through right-left symmetry arranged along 
a central axis. In other words, if you plant one lilac on the left, you have to 
plant an identical lilac on the right. In an informal garden, balance is asym-
metrical, with differing elements arranged without a formal axis. Instead, this 
type of garden relies on a more subtle equilibrium of their overall mass. Have 
a look at the two plans in Figure 5-2 to see the difference between formal and 
informal gardens.

Par t II: Good Design: The Key to Sustainable Landscaping 
 
A sustainable landscape can be formal or informal — you don’t have to give 
up your design aesthetic to go the sustainable route.
Repetition: Following nature’s lead
Don’t be afraid to repeat design elements in your garden; repetition makes 
the design that much stronger. Think of a forest with thousands of the same 
kind of tree, each with the same vegetation underneath. A forest like this 
beautiful, yet most people seem timid about using repetition in their land-
scaping.
 
Repetition carried too far creates a tedious scene, but a lack of repetition 
works hard against unity. One daylily gets lost in a planting that’s made up of 
100 varieties of plants, but an acre of daylilies is boring. If you strew clusters 
of daylilies throughout your garden, repeating them like a musical refrain, 
they gain energy and contribute to the continuity of the planting. If you do 
that with many elements, both plants and hardscape features, your design 
will be strong and good-looking. Check out Figure 5-3 to see examples of poor 
repetition and strong repetition.

Contrast and variety: The spice of life
The dance between repetition and variety in landscape design is a delicate 
one. After all, repetition is important for unity, but including elements that 
contrast with one another in color, form, shape, and overall character can 
add a lot of life to the composition. For instance, if you want to create a lively 
scene, plant light-colored foliage against a dark background, place rough 
natural stones against refined smooth concrete, and use trees or overhead 
structures to produce patterns of sun and shade. These are just a few ways 
to add variety to your design.
Shape and form: One big happy family
I think of shape as being the two-dimensional arrangement of the elements 
of the landscape when viewed from above, whereas form is the three-dimen-
sional space that things occupy when viewed from ground level. Both are 
important elements of garden design.
Getting into shape
Decide on a shape family for your landscape layout. You can choose among 
the many different families, including rectilinear, curvilinear, angular, or free-
form. A landscape made up of strongly geometric shapes can be very formal 
(if it’s symmetrical) or elegantly restful (such as a Japanese garden).

74
Par t II: Good Design: The Key to Sustainable Landscaping 
On the other end of the spectrum, a free-form approach is best suited to the 
naturalistic garden. But even the free-form is not free of form; the form is just 
more subtle. Study wild natural areas to see how trees, rocks, and streams 
are arranged very beautifully yet without apparent geometry — they’re 
products of the natural forces in the system. If you can do that in your yard, 
you’ll really achieve something great.
 
Whatever you do, make your shape family consistent and relate it to other 
shapes that may be present on the site. Pair round shapes with rolling hills 
and rectangles with a boxy modern house, or contrast them for a different 
look. Figure 5-4 shows bad and good uses of shape.

bad uses of 
shape.

In good form
Closely related to shape is the form, or 3D outline, of plants and other fea-
tures. A sheared boxwood hedge has a strict rectilinear form, whereas an 
Italian cypress or poplar tree has an upright, column-like form. And a spread-
ing oak tree grows in the form of a broad canopy. Each form has a particular 
role to play. The boxwood leads you along a path, the upright cypress is 
like a giant exclamation point, and the oak embraces and shelters the area 
beneath it.
 
Include some plants with strap-shaped leaves such as Iris or some boldly-
shaped succulents like Agaves in your plantings. They act as points of empha-
sis in the design, and the contrast they make with the leafier textures and 
shrubbier forms pleases the eye and is enlivening.

75
 Chapter 5: Brushing Up On Design Basics
Line of sight: Getting all 
your ducks in a row
Plantings, hardscape, and other landscaping features create lines of sight. 
Lines of sight can be explicit, such as elements arranged strictly along an 
imaginary central line called an axis or perhaps an allée (a long double row) 
of trees, or it can be subtle, such as a gently curving path. Lines lead the eye 
through the scene and help make sense of the elements it contains. Have a 
look at Figure 5-5 to see what works and what doesn’t.
 
Lines can run parallel to or at right angles to buildings and other exist-
ing structural elements, or you can place them at 30-degree, 45-degree, or 
60-degree angles. The angular approach usually has more visual energy and 
creates a feeling of movement and depth in the overall composition. It’s espe-
cially useful in making small spaces seem bigger. Curves are also quite lively 
and can make for a delightful sense of movement.

Focal points and vantage points: 
Grabbing people’s attention
Imagine sitting out in your backyard on a balmy summer’s evening, watching 
the water dance in your fountain. Or picture yourself coming around a corner 
and seeing a gorgeous persimmon tree laden with fruit, the leaves starting 
to turn color. Those attention-grabbing elements are called focal points. Any 
strong and striking visual element, such as a piece of sculpture or a particu-
larly stunning plant, can be a focal point in your composition.
Focal points are often placed on axes (long, straight lines of sight) with 
other features. You may, for example, put a bold fountain in line with a set of 
French doors. Focal points are also effective when placed in corners, where 
they provide an endpoint for the view and give the area a feeling of depth and 
energy. Without good focal points, your eye searches in vain for a place to 
rest, which leads you to feel a sense of incompleteness.
Every focal point has at least one vantage point (a place from which it is 
viewed). This can be your patio, the living room sofa, or a bench. Sometimes 
it works to have several vantage points. For instance, you may have a foun-
tain that’s visible from several places in the garden. When you put together 
your landscape design, the creation of focal points and vantage points should 
be one of the first things you consider. Refer to Figure 5-6 to see how vantage 
points work in landscape plans.
 
Don’t have too many focal points. If you have more than three in any given 
area, you weaken the design and create the same confusion as having none at 
all — the eye has no place to land.

 Chapter 5: Brushing Up On Design Basics
Texture: Feeling your way around
Designers contrast plant textures for appealing combinations. They play coarse 
against fine and then repeat the play of textures using different plants. When 
skillfully combined with nicely-partnered colors, textures are a key element 
in what makes plantings work well. A tropical Philodendron with leaves 6 
feet across is said to have a coarse texture. A tiny-leaved thyme plant, on the 
other hand, has a fine texture.
This rule of texture also applies to hardscape. For instance, sometimes a 
surface made of large tiles looks great in a small space because the texture 
is unexpected and it makes the area seem roomier than it is. The texture of 
paving, walls, woodwork, and other man-made elements contributes greatly 
to the overall effect of the landscape.
 
You can use texture to create a sense of depth by placing finer textures in 
the background, or you can create drama by purposefully placing a coarse-
textured plant in an unexpected location.
Color: Letting your landscape’s 
true colors shine through
The color of your plantings as well as your hardscape features works to 
create many different effects. Use color to generate a look and mood that’s 
appropriate to your particular situation. For instance, I like to use plantings 
in bright yellows, oranges, and reds in front yards to create a cheerful and 
welcoming atmosphere. A single bold red plant can really liven up a portion 
of your landscape. And something variegated (with multicolored leaves), 
such as a spider plant, can brighten a shady area under a tree where it’s dif-
ficult to get flowers to grow. You can use these simple strategies in many 
contexts with many kinds of plants.
 
Foliage colors other than green play a strong role in design, too, adding lively, 
year-round interest. Don’t overlook seasonal changes in leaf color — they can 
be incredibly rewarding. Match the fresh green leaves of spring with brightly 
colored flowers, and then later in the year, match the autumn foliage to more 
somber autumn colors by using fall-blooming plants. The tricks you can play 
are endless.
Use the plant lists in gardening books such as Gardening All-in-One For 
Dummies (Wiley) to plan out your color schemes by season. Looking at 
images of the plants and putting them together into a collage helps you see 
how the planting will look. Visit nurseries and gardens to see real plants in 
bloom, and don’t overlook seeing mature plants growing in real places.

78
Par t II: Good Design: The Key to Sustainable Landscaping 
Your hardscape needs to have a color scheme, too. Hardscape colors are 
usually more subtle than those of flowers, but sometimes it’s really fun to use 
an outrageous bright red, purple, or yellow piece of art in a focal point where 
it will have a stunning impact amid the more demure colors of the plantings. 
(See the earlier section “Focal points and vantage points: Grabbing people’s 
attention” for details.)
 
From a sustainability perspective, the color of pavement can affect the liv-
ability of the area you’re landscaping. The relative reflectivity (or albedo as we 
fancy-pants landscape architects like to call it) of a surface can make it liter-
ally hot or cool. And very few people enjoy having to sit or walk on a surface 
that’s too hot.
Picking Up On the Design 
Secrets of the Pros
We landscape designers have all kinds of design secrets up our sleeves, and 
in this section, I spill a few of them. Read on for some pretty cool tricks of 
the trade that you may not think of on your own — tricks that can help you 
achieve a really striking landscape design. Why settle for an ordinary land-
scape? By being innovative and by asking new questions about the possibili-
ties, you give yourself a chance to come up with something special that fits 
your needs.
Controlling people’s feelings and 
behaviors with your design
I always say that designers are the dictators of feelings and behavior. They 
can make people experience certain emotions and even act in predictable 
ways simply through design choices. Of course, the benevolent dictator uses 
this power only to do good.
For an idea of how design can affect your emotions and behaviors, picture 
yourself sitting on a bench in a public park. The bench is out in the open, 
and behind you is a large expanse of lawn. If you’re like most people, you’ll 
soon notice a certain discomfort setting in. It’s because we’re genetically 
programmed to watch our backs. (Thank our ancestors, who were constantly 
getting eaten by saber-toothed tigers, for this built-in surveillance system.) 
However, if you move that bench up against a sun-warmed wall, you’ll likely 
have created a situation that makes you want to linger because you feel safe 
(and toasty warm).

79
 Chapter 5: Brushing Up On Design Basics
 
The bottom line is that people respond strongly to design and to how it’s 
carried out in the actual landscape. So if you make a place that’s unsettling, 
nobody will want to use it. No doubt you’ve seen and visited places like this. 
In fact, your backyard may be one of them. On the other hand, you can use 
design to create a place that evokes positive feelings, such as safety, calm, 
curiosity, peace, or delight. As a designer, you have incredible control over 
how people feel and behave. Use your power wisely, and your landscape will 
be a source of joy for years to come.
Designing outside the box
Fresh ideas can be difficult to come up with. Even seasoned landscape pro-
fessionals can fall into the trap of plugging in the same old ideas: living space 
in the back, patio directly outside the house, and so on. A key part of the 
design process is asking the right questions to get inspiration. What if you 
put the living space in the front of your house? Suppose you place the patio 
farther back in the yard — how would that look? Ask questions that help 
break your mind out of what it thinks are limits.
A little unconventional thinking can lead to stunning results. For example, 
you may decide to mix vegetable plants with ornamental plants in a more 
gardenesque arrangement, or you may devote your front yard to an orchard 
or native garden instead of a less useful lawn, or you may even lower your 
lighting to illuminate the paths only, removing the hot spots and urban light 
pollution generated by bright light fixtures traditionally located on the porch 
next to the door. Designers know they need to think beyond normal prac-
tices, particularly when they’re stumped. If you aren’t sure what to do with 
your design, turn everything you know on its head and approach things from 
a totally different perspective.
 
Keep in mind that unconventional thinking can go too far when it violates 
design principles. And remember that someday, you may want or need to 
sell your house. Consider the effect of your landscaping on marketability and 
property value; don’t make things so weird that you can’t sell the place.
Don’t just design for the eye. Use all your senses. Take into account sound, 
fragrance, and the tactile qualities of plants and surfaces. You can even con-
sider the taste of things (like the succulent blueberries I just grazed off the 
bush — yum!).

80
Par t II: Good Design: The Key to Sustainable Landscaping 
Paying attention to the sequential 
experience of the landscape
One of my very favorite design principles is what I call the sequential experi-
ence of the landscape. It may sound complicated, but believe me, it’s easy to 
understand and put into practice. First, think of a garden setting where you 
can see everything in the whole place at the same time. In this type of setting, 
you can stand and scan from one end of the place to the other in 30 seconds. 
Then it’s time to go back inside because you’ve seen all there is to see. The 
landscape offers no excitement and no sense of depth, and nothing very 
intriguing is going on.
But if you were to create some subtle divisions within that space — such as 
a shrub that partially conceals a portion of the garden — your mind would 
start to work on it and you’d become curious about what’s going on behind 
the shrub. So take on the role of the benevolent design dictator and run a 
curvy pathway around that shrub, creating the possibility of access. (See the 
earlier section “Controlling people’s feelings and behaviors with your design” 
for more on becoming a design dictator.) Put something really cool behind 
that shrub, such as a secluded bench or a pond full of rubber duckies, and 
you’ve created a feeling of mystery — of being invited into a special, secret 
world. By doing so, you’ve made the process of moving through the land-
scape an adventure. Check out Figure 5-7 for a sample landscaping plan that 
shows this design principle.

 Chapter 5: Brushing Up On Design Basics
When you create this type of subtle separation in your yard, you’ve also cre-
ated what some people call an away place. Imagine the difference between 
having a cool drink at the end of the day on the patio just outside the kitchen 
door and taking it back to that secret spot to visit your rubber duckies. One 
location makes you feel like you’re still on the hamster wheel, and the other 
feels like a mini-vacation because you’ve disappeared for a little while. You 
can create away places for one person or for a whole crowd. When you get to 
your away place, you literally see the world, and your garden, from a totally 
different perspective. How refreshing is that?
 
Landscape design is about creating places that not only look good and work 
right but also make you feel good. You might say that’s the winning combination: 
beautiful, sustainable, and emotionally satisfying.
Considering style
Most garden design literature is about style. In fact, you can find entire books 
on just about any style: Southwest Style, Thai Style, Kankakee Style, and so 
on. These books generally don’t address sustainability issues, but they do 
offer an important lesson: Every place has a certain indigenous quality. This 
lesson is less true as the world becomes more homogenous, but elemental 
factors, such as climate, can give rise to certain architectural responses. For 
example, depending on the weather in your area, you may need a peaked or 
flat roof, and you’ll likely have different types of plants than someone in an 
opposite clime. Climate also impacts whether you have a rack for surfboards 
or snowshoes on the back porch.
Here’s a fancy landscape architect’s word that will really impress your 
friends: genius loci. It means the “spirit of place.” When you capture the 
genius loci of your property, you’ll be better able to come up with a fit-
ting design. For example, suppose you live in a desert climate. The proper 
response to that environment is to plant desert plants, not tuberous bego-
nias. That response matters from a sustainability perspective, of course, but 
it also matters because the genius loci demands it. Responding to genius loci 
is what style is on a deep level.
Styles can be derived from culture (formal, modern, Victorian, urban), from 
regional sources (Thai, Mexican, English), or from the natural world (desert, 
tropical, alpine).
 
Take local style into account during your design adventure. After all, your 
region, your town or neighborhood, and of course your house all have a style, 
and the landscape you create will make a lot more sense if you fit it carefully 
into its surroundings. Remember that traditional styles arose as a sustainable 
response to the realities of the environment, so by respecting that ancient 
wisdom you also bring environmental sensibility to your design.

82
Par t II: Good Design: The Key to Sustainable Landscaping 
Sticking with your garden over time
It’s easy to forget that gardens aren’t static like furniture or pictures hanging 
on the wall. A garden is a living ecosystem, and even the most stable, sustain-
able landscape is changing all the time. Your garden will look very different 
1 month, 1 year, 10 years, and 50 years after you create it. By planning for 
those stages, you develop a landscape that endures, and there’s nothing 
more sustainable than that.
For example, in your plantings, the annual plants will be around for the first 
year; the perennials and groundcovers, for the first 10 years; and the trees, 
for 50 years or longer. Over time, the trees will alter the environment, and 
the plants beneath the trees will change. The wise designer looks ahead and 
plans for the inevitable and desirable transitions so the project keeps work-
ing over the long haul.

esigning a landscape that looks great and also works well (that’s the 
sustainable part) can seem intimidating and mysterious if you haven’t 
done it before. But if you follow the steps in this chapter, you shouldn’t have 
any trouble putting together a beautiful, sustainable landscape.
 
If you get stuck, remember that there’s no shame in running your ideas by a 
landscape architect for feedback. The price of a consultation (usually $100 to 
$300) is a tiny fraction of the overall cost of the project, and it can save you 
much grief later.
Deciding What Plans You Need
You wouldn’t think of building a house by gathering up some lumber, con-
crete, and roofing materials and then making the house up as you went along. 
First you need a plan to direct the course of the work and ensure a satisfac-
tory outcome. Landscaping is no different. In fact, the landscape, especially 
the sustainable landscape, is complex, and it demands a great deal of thought 
if you want to end up with something that works well and looks good.
When most people think of a landscape design, they imagine a set of plan 
drawings showing where everything is going to be located — the trees and 
shrubs, the patio, the paths, and all the rest. When you hire someone to 
design your landscaping for you, this is one of the things you get for your 

84
Par t II: Good Design: The Key to Sustainable Landscaping 
money. Plan drawings are handy to have, and they can be a great tool if 
you’re doing your own design. But it’s entirely possible to develop a great 
design without ever drawing a plan. Take a minute to consider two equally 
valid approaches to design:
 
✓ Sticking to the bubble diagram/field design approach: If you have a 
small-scale plan in mind (for instance, you want to change some plant-
ings in the back flower beds and switch your lawn to a more sustain-
able meadow) or if you have a fairly clear vision for some more major 
changes, drawing detailed plans may not be necessary. You may need 
only to sketch a bubble diagram and spend some time outside marking 
off the edges of beds with a garden hose or rope or staking out the loca-
tion of a new patio with wood stakes and builder’s twine. This marking 
and staking is referred to as field design. (Check out the next section 
to find out more about bubble diagrams and field design.) This hands-
on approach helps you experiment with designs until you find the one 
that’s best.
 
✓ Drawing full-blown landscape plans: If you’ll be laying out an entirely 
new landscape, with paving, retaining walls, outdoor rooms of various 
kinds, and lots of details, draw it all to scale using the techniques and 
plans I describe throughout this chapter. Include the concept plan, a 
simpler version of the detailed landscape plan a professional landscape 
architect might develop for you. A detailed concept plan helps you make 
sure everything in your new landscape fits and works well together, and 
it provides a clear roadmap for installing your own landscaping.
 
Be sure you do all the designing you need to in order to have a well-planned 
landscape that takes all the issues of function, appearance, cost, legality, and 
environmental suitability into account. What counts in the end is not the 
quality of the pretty pictures you draw but the quality of your thinking and 
planning.
Making the Fundamental Decisions
Design goes from the general to the specific. Whether you end up with a 
formal set of plan drawings or not, the first step in the design process is to 
write down, in a very informal way, the general ideas you’ve had during your 
site analysis and initial design work, which I cover in Chapters 4 and 5. The 
second step is to take your design outside, where you mark it all out on the 
ground to get a feeling for how it’ll look when you do it for real. In this sec-
tion, I introduce you to bubble diagrams and field design.

85
 Chapter 6: Plot ting Your Sustainable Landscape
Creating a bubble diagram
When you’re ready to write down your landscape design ideas, make a rough 
sketch of your property on a sheet of paper. This rough sketch, or bubble 
diagram, doesn’t have to be to scale at this point, but try to make it reason-
ably accurate. Then start writing words and phrases in appropriate locations: 
“new patio,” “remove tree,” “dog run,” “vegetable garden,” and so on. The 
ideas you write down can include anything from problems, opportunities, 
and needs to desires and specific features you know you like. Encircle each 
feature with a simple oval. Now isn’t the time for fancy graphics — your 
bubble diagram just needs to be useful, much like the simple diagram in 
Figure 6-1.
 
Figure 6-1: 
An example 
bubble 
diagram.
 

86
Par t II: Good Design: The Key to Sustainable Landscaping 
After you finish your bubble diagram, take it outside and sit with it. You 
want to be sure it all makes sense. You may even want to make two or more 
bubble diagrams to explore different approaches (for example, with the patio 
here versus the patio there). This step opens your mind to all the possibili-
ties; right now you’re still exploring, and you don’t want to miss a thing.
Move around your property and imagine how it’ll look when it’s done. 
Picture the shade of the new trees, the size and shape of the flower beds, the 
changed landforms, and everything else. Visualize everything as best you 
can before you act on your decisions. After all, landscaping your yard two or 
three times isn’t sustainable.
Laying it out on the ground: Field design
If you have a difficult time visualizing the changes you wrote down in your 
bubble diagram (see the preceding section), mocking up the landscape can 
be a wonderful way to make them more realistic. Here are a number of handy 
techniques you can use to accomplish this mock-up, which is referred to as 
field design:
 
✓ Mark out the boundaries of planter beds, patios, pathways, and so on 
with lines of powdered gypsum or lime. These materials are available 
in bulk at nurseries, and you can apply them by hand. Colored spray 
paint is great for color-coding the different features, but it isn’t very 
good for the environment. And isn’t sustainability the whole point of this 
project?
 
 Use a garden hose or a flexible nylon rope to temporarily delineate 
curves; then apply the gypsum or lime along the lines you’ve created.
 
✓ Stake the corners of structures with 1"-x-2" wooden stakes and then 
use builder’s twine to connect them. This reveals the footprint of the 
completed work.
 
✓ Map out your trees and other tall features. Use pin flags (small flags 
available at building supply places), or even long pipes stood on end, to 
indicate tall site features, such as tree trunks or light posts.
 
✓ Place big wads of crumpled newspaper where boulders or shrubs will 
be. The wads of paper should be close to the realistic size of the feature; 
that way you can get a good idea of how everything will look when fin-
ished.
 
✓ Construct fake fences and walls with corrugated cardboard or sheets 
of plywood. Stake the temporary structures in place with steel T-posts.
 
Materials from your mock-up can come from the waste stream, of course. 
Buying them new and using them once would be the antithesis of what sus-
tainable landscaping is all about, so use what you have or look to neighbors or 

87
 Chapter 6: Plot ting Your Sustainable Landscape
local businesses. Dumpster diving is no shame. Oh, and that gypsum or lime is 
good for the soil, so no harm done there.
Observe the “finished” landscape from every angle. Walk the “paths” and 
sit on the “patio” with a cool drink. See how you like it. Live with it for a few 
days (or longer), and make changes as necessary. Give this decisive moment 
your best thought before you proceed to the next level of commitment.
Making a bubble diagram and testing it through field design doesn’t answer 
all your questions. Whether you go to the trouble of making a formal land-
scape plan or simply get on with the process of constructing your new land-
scaping, be aware that you have plenty more details to resolve. Even if you 
won’t be drawing a concept plan, be sure to read the rest of this chapter to 
understand how to go from the general ideas you have at this stage to the 
specifics of exactly what you’ll be doing. You definitely don’t want to miss 
the “Remaining within the Law: Considering Legal Issues” section!
Taking Your Plan Drawing 
to the Next Level
Sometimes a project is just too big or complex to design on the ground. That’s 
when it’s time to do some detailed planning on paper, just like the pros. This 
planning involves measuring the site and developing what’s called a base sheet 
(a drawing of your property with all the existing features on it, such as the 
house, trees, and property lines), and then developing a concept plan on top of 
that base. The following sections guide you through this process.
Measuring your site the easy way
To design a more complex landscape, you have to draw plans to scale. And 
to do that, you need reasonably accurate measurements of your site. After 
you’ve gathered your measurements, you transfer them to paper. Assuming 
your property is relatively flat, not too big, and fairly limited in complexity, 
you can easily measure the site yourself.
 
If your property is complex or if you need more-detailed information (for your 
own use or to fulfill requirements of agencies that you may be submitting your 
plans to), hire a licensed land surveyor. These professionals aren’t cheap, but 
they work to a much higher degree of accuracy than you (or I) ever will.

88
Par t II: Good Design: The Key to Sustainable Landscaping 
Follow these steps, and in just an hour or so, you’ll have a fairly accurate set 
of measurements:
 
1. Gather your tools.
 
 You need a 20-foot tape measure (the 1-inch wide ones are nicely rigid 
and easy to work with), a 100-foot tape measure, a clipboard, paper, 
pencil, and the usual Indiana Jones hat, chaps, rattlesnake boots, and 
machete.
 
2. Start by measuring your house.
 
 Begin at an easy point, such as one of the front corners. Measure from the 
corner of the house to the first window. Stop there and measure the width 
of the window. Then measure from the window to the door, and so forth, 
working around the house until you come back to your starting point.
 
3. Measure from the house out to the property lines.
 
 Run your tape from all the house corners perpendicularly out to the 
fences or other assumed property lines. On an ordinary suburban lot, 
this step is no big deal; on larger or thickly-vegetated properties, this 
measurement can get a little gnarly. (That’s why you’re wearing the 
Indiana Jones gear.)
 
 If you plan to install any fencing or make any other changes along 
your property lines, be sure you know where the legal boundaries are, 
because you’ll be responsible for any encroachments. A professional 
boundary survey is well worth the price.
 
4. Measure any other buildings on your property and any hardscape 
features.
 
 Use the same simple linear technique here that you used on the house. 
Leave no detail unmeasured. This includes seemingly unimportant 
things like downspouts, light fixtures, drains, and so forth. Be nitpicky.
 
5. Measure planter beds and major plants.
 
 Include the length and width of the beds, the approximate canopy spread 
of the trees, the depth of the hedges, and the locations of tree trunks.
 
6. Measure the spaces between features.
 
 Measuring how far apart things are will enable you to place features in 
accurate relationship to one another.
 
Engineers use triangles to brace things like bridges and buildings because 
the triangle is rigid. That rigidity works in measuring, too; it helps you place 
seemingly random site features — such as tree trunks, sheds, and kiddie 
pools — on your map with a high degree of precision. To use the secret art of 
triangulation, simply measure to, say, a tree trunk, from at least two points on 
a fixed feature, such as two corners of your house. When you transfer these 
measurements to paper, your tree will be in exactly the right location. Figure 
6-2 shows how all this looks on your field notes.

89
 Chapter 6: Plot ting Your Sustainable Landscape
 
Figure 6-2:

surements 
with trian-
gulation.
 
 
Triangulation goes much more smoothly with a helper, but if you don’t have 
one, no problem. Just add one more tool to your kit: a screwdriver. Use it to 
pin the end of the 100-foot tape to the ground (such as by a corner of your 
house) when you take your long measurements. Pivot to all the distant points 
you’ll be measuring before you move to the next location.
Using your measurements 
to create a base sheet
After you take all the measurements of your property, you get to go inside 
where it’s cool and comfortable. There you can settle down to the task of 
transferring your measurements to paper. To tackle this task, you need the 
following tools: gridded drafting paper, an architect’s scale, a T-square, a tri-
angle, a compass, and a drawing board. Chapter 3 describes these tools and 
where to get them.
After gathering your tools, tape a sheet of drafting paper onto your drawing 
board and follow these steps to transfer your measurements to paper and 
create your base sheet:
 
1. Add up your measurements to determine the overall length and width 
of your property.
 
 Total all the measurements in each direction: the length of the property 
lines if you measured them or the sum of the width of the house plus the 
spaces between the house and the boundaries.
 
2. Using the architect’s scale, transfer the overall dimensions to your 
paper, arranging the lot so that it fits comfortably on the paper.

90
Par t II: Good Design: The Key to Sustainable Landscaping 
 
 First lay out the shape of the lot so that it’s reasonably centered on the 
page. Start with one corner and measure out in both directions to the 
farthest extent of the property boundaries. Make adjustments as needed 
to provide adequate margins around the drawing.
 
 When drawing the lot, it’s great if you can use an existing survey or 
house plot plan that you have on hand from when the house was built 
or remodeled. Then you can simply trace this onto your base sheet and 
you’re done with this step. If it’s not drawn at the right scale, take it to 
a blueprint or copy shop and have them use their fancy equipment to 
blow it up to the scale you need.
 
 When transferring, choose the scale that produces the largest drawing 
possible so you have room to include all the details without crowding. 
For an ordinary-size suburban lot, usually a scale of 1/4 inch to 1 foot is 
fine. In other words, each 1/4 inch on paper represents 1 foot in the real 
world. If the lot is too big to fit comfortably on the paper at that scale, go 
to 1/8 inch to 1 foot, which cuts your drawing size in half.
 
 Don’t forget to locate north and mark it with an arrow on your base 
sheet; this tells you where the sun goes every day, which is essential to 
designing plantings and virtually every other sustainable landscape fea-
ture so that it’s all well-adapted to the sun and shade patterns on your 
property.
 
3. Using your property line and triangulation measurements, accurately 
locate and place the major features on your drafting paper.
 
 Here’s how to place the triangulations, which you measure in the pre-
ceding section:
 
1. Set a compass to one of the distances you measured.
 
 Place the needle point of the compass on the zero mark of the 
architect’s scale and then adjust the compass so that the draw-
ing end lines up with the distance you want to strike off on the 
paper (this matches the measurement you took outside in the real 
world).
 
2. Draw an arc on your paper.
 
 Place the needle of the compass on the paper at the point where 
you took the measurement in the field, such as at the corner of 
your house. Being careful not to adjust the compass, draw an arc 
on the paper.
 
3. Repeat the first two steps for your other triangulation 
measurement and mark where the two arcs cross.
 
 Where the arcs meet is the point you measured. Make a pencil 
mark there and identify it as “oak tree” or whatever.
 
 Accuracy is important because if, for instance, the oak tree is a couple 
feet away from where you show it on the plans, whatever you put in that 

91
 Chapter 6: Plot ting Your Sustainable Landscape
area will have to be changed later when you start your construction 
work. Inaccuracies can also affect how many materials you order and 
the overall cost of the job.
 
4. Gradually add in the little details, such as doors, windows, gates, and 
so on.
 
 Make little tick marks for each measurement; you can go back later and 
draw them in more detail so that your finished drawing is clear and 
readable.
 
 Include setback lines (internal boundaries on your property that deter-
mine where you can and can’t put certain kinds of improvements, such 
as overhead structures that aren’t allowed to be right next to a property 
line), easements, overhead and underground utilities, and any other 
critical elements. Show the tops and toes (a fancy word for bottoms) of 
any slopes. Mark drainage patterns with arrows pointing to the downhill 
flow of water.
 
5. Turn your rough layout into a tidy finished base sheet.
 
 Trace over the base sheet onto another sheet of paper (drafting paper 
is semi-transparent). Use Figure 6-3 as a base sheet model. You use this 
base sheet as a template for the actual plans: concept plan, planting 
plan, irrigation plan, and so on.
 
If drawing a base sheet is a bit much for you, you do have other options. You 
can hire a surveyor or landscape architect to create your base sheet. You may 
also look into landscape design software (check out www.landscaping-
software-review.toptenreviews.com for software recommendations). 
You’ll still have to go through all the measuring and plotting, though, so those 
programs don’t really keep you from having to do that work.
Creating a concept plan
After you measure your site, use a bubble diagram and your best thinking 
to explore the options, and create a base sheet (see the preceding section), 
you’re ready to create a concept plan like the one in Figure 6-4.
Creating a concept plan for any major changes you’re planning is a good idea 
because it makes you think about the details of what you’re doing. A concept 
plan is a way of showing the general elements that make up your project, 
such as patios, walks, trees, and water features. You don’t know precisely 
what material the patios and walks will be made of or what kind of trees 
you’ll use, but at this stage, you’ll understand the placement, size, and pur-
pose of each element of the finished landscape.
 
Creating a concept plan is an important stage of the design process because 
you make overall decisions about how the landscape will look and function. 

92
Par t II: Good Design: The Key to Sustainable Landscaping 
 
Figure 6-3: 
A base 
sheet.
 
The details that you fill in later will be built on the strong foundation you 
create at the concept plan stage.
When creating a concept plan, ask yourself questions like the following:
 
✓ How wide will the front walk be?
 
✓ Where will the raised veggie beds be located?
 
✓ Is there really space for a small patio outside the master bedroom?
 
✓ Will the hardscape be rectilinear, curvilinear, angular, or free-form?
These questions aren’t specific to your situation, but they give you an idea 
of the types of questions to ask. You need to ask such questions to flush out 
hidden problems, to develop the overall function of the elements of the proj-
ect, and to make sure everything that needs to be there is present and in the 
proper place.

Fine-tuning the site: Space planning
One aspect of planning at this conceptual stage is making sure everything 
fits. Have you ever rearranged your living room furniture and found that it 
fit better in one arrangement than it did in another? In addition to injuring 
your back, you were doing space planning — the art and science of making 
everything go together in a way that not only fits but also looks like it really 
belongs there and meets your needs.

94
Par t II: Good Design: The Key to Sustainable Landscaping 
From a sustainability perspective, the better things work, the fewer resources 
you’ll use to create and maintain them. Space planning can highlight areas 
where you can downsize lawns or reshape flower beds to make maintenance 
easier, for instance.
Space planning is a process where a scale drawing really pays off. Place a 
sheet of clean tracing paper over the base sheet that you create in the earlier 
section “Using your measurements to create a base sheet.” Begin drawing in 
the elements of your design as precisely as you can. For instance, you may 
have decided that your patio will be 12 x 18 feet, will be rectilinear and paral-
lel with the house, and will be located in the far left corner of the back yard. 
Draw that on the tracing paper. Continue drawing in paths, turf or meadow 
areas, raised beds, planter beds and borders, major trees and shrubs, and 
whatever else is on your bubble diagram and in your mind (see the earlier 
section “Creating a bubble diagram”). At this stage, don’t worry about what 
materials or plants you’ll use in your landscape.
 
Cut out pieces of paper to scale for major features and physically move them 
around on the base sheet so you can see how the different placements will 
work.
You can do space planning electronically, too, using one of the many land-
scape design programs that help you visualize your future landscape. These 
programs can even go into 3-D mode and zoom around your property, show-
ing you how the completed project will look from different angles. Check out 
www.landscaping-software-review.toptenreviews.com for software 
recommendations.
As you’re adding features, be prepared to make a lot of changes. Work in 
pencil at first, and try different approaches. Head outside to check your ideas 
often. Don’t get discouraged when your favorite idea doesn’t work the way you 
dreamed it would. Just keep trying things until it all seems to lock into place.
 
Color in your final concept plan to better separate elements and to get a better 
idea of how the landscape may really look.
Pondering your plant and materials palettes
The next step in developing your concept plan is to begin to explore what 
materials are available for you to use. You make final decisions later in the 
process when you have a clearer picture of precisely how things will go 
together, but now is when you see what’s out there. Think of it as window-
shopping. (In fact, you get to go window-shopping for real at this point.)
Visit building materials suppliers, nurseries, and other vendors. And consider 
scouring the waste stream by checking out Craigslist (www.craigslist.
com), eBay (www.ebay.com), and other sources of used stuff. Check your 
local dumpsters and garage sales, too. Oh, and don’t forget to inventory what 

95
 Chapter 6: Plot ting Your Sustainable Landscape
you already have on site, including soil, boulders, or even the opportunity to 
grow something like bamboo to be used in your construction projects. That’s 
about as sustainable as it gets.
Start off with the plants and develop a plant palette, a list of candidate plants 
to fill the roles you’ve already defined in your concept plan. For example, you 
may have decided to plant a 20-foot-tall deciduous tree with a broad canopy 
to shade the driveway. The tree’s shade will keep your car cool and reduce 
the evaporative losses from the fuel tank. Now you’re thinking sustainably!
If you don’t know what types of plants thrive in your area, do some research. 
Chapters 16, 17, and 18 provide advice on selecting plants, trees, and shrubs 
that are appropriate for your climate and yard space. Gardening books and 
the Internet can help you become familiar with your plant choices as well. 
Also, if you have the time, visit real plants in real places — see how they 
behave, how big they get, how they smell, and everything else about them.
Now develop a menu of paving materials, lighting fixtures, furniture, and any 
other materials you think you may need for your project. This list serves as 
your materials palette. See Chapters 2, 12, and 13 for details on choosing sus-
tainable materials.
Narrowing down the possibilities
After you create your concept plan and plant and materials palettes, you 
may feel overwhelmed by the possibilities. Congratulations! This is a sign that 
you’ve done a great job of gathering information. It’s time to shift gears and 
begin eliminating the landscape features that don’t really fit. You’ve developed 
an extensive list of possibilities, and you’ll never be able to use them all. This 
narrowing process may seem intimidating, but don’t worry. Here’s how to 
whittle your way to a cohesive set of appropriate materials and wise choices:
 
✓ Screen your choices for availability. Check to be sure your preferred 
materials are available, preferably from local sources. Drop anything 
that’s difficult to find from your materials and plant palettes.
 
✓ Check each item for sustainability. Be sure that the materials and plants 
you choose meet reasonable sustainability standards. Check all your 
materials, plants, and other inputs for their impacts on the environment 
(both on your property and off-site as well).
 
✓ Be sure your choices will work the way you want them to. Ask yourself 
a few questions: Will those plants really thrive in my yard? Will the patio 
materials stand up to my cold winters? Will that drip system work with 
my sandy soils?
 
✓ Check costs. Eliminate anything that will take the project over budget. 
You did create a budget before you started, didn’t you? See Chapters 1 
and 3 for details.

96
Par t II: Good Design: The Key to Sustainable Landscaping 
 
✓ Make sure the feature fits style you already have. A formal fountain 
looks great with a traditional style house, but I doubt you’ll be happy 
if you pair one with Japanese architecture. Cut anything that doesn’t 
match the style of existing features.
 
✓ Dump what you don’t like. Your personal preferences count here, too. 
Drop stuff that you haven’t really warmed up to.
If you heeded my advice from the preceding list, you probably narrowed 
your choices down pretty well. Do you have a compatible set of elements? If 
so, you’re well on your way to a lovely, coherent design. If you’re still feeling 
uneasy, you may want to get an expert opinion by running your design past a 
professional landscape architect.
Polishing off the concept plan
By now you should be pretty clear about what elements will go into your new 
landscape and how they’ll be arranged. You can modify things on the fly at 
any point in the process — even during construction — but the more you 
figure out now, the easier the rest of the job will be.
 
Consider drawing a fresh version of your concept plan. By doing so, you give 
yourself an opportunity to rethink everything and fine tune your layout. Plus 
you’ll have a new, clean copy that’s easier to read.
Generally speaking, for a residential job, you don’t need to develop working 
drawings, which show every last detail in the exact form it will be in after it’s 
built. However, under certain circumstances, developing an exact landscape 
plan is best. You may need a landscape architect for this. Find out about 
working drawings in the next section.
Planning for Particular Needs
If you’re required to submit formal landscape plans (also known as working 
drawings) to the city or other agencies in order to get a building permit, if 
you’re planning to put your project out to contractors to bid, or if you just 
want to take the design process to the next level of detail for your own use, 
the following sections provide a summary of what’s involved.
 
Working drawings include tons more detail than a concept plan, and they 
may even run to several pages, with separate pages for planting, grading and 
drainage, irrigation, hardscape, and other aspects of the job. Considering 
the intricacies involved, a full set of working drawings suitable for submit-
ting to agencies or contractors is really a job for a landscape architect. But if 
you’re ambitious, you can tackle a simplified version. Just be sure to include 
adequate detail to spell out exactly what’s to be done. The following sections 
provide some example plans.

97
 Chapter 6: Plot ting Your Sustainable Landscape
Grading and drainage plans
A grading and drainage plan shows where the water goes. A simplified plan 
shows where to put swales (long, shallow ditches) and drainage systems to 
move, capture, and disburse the water on your property (see Chapter 7 for 
examples of some water-harvesting systems). At the other end of the spec-
trum is a full-blown engineering plan that’s highly detailed and that will be of 
considerable use to your contractor should you choose to hire one.
 
A good contractor often can get the grading right without a drawn plan. Invest 
in a plan if you need this level of detail or if an agency requires it; otherwise, 
just be sure you’re in the hands of experienced professionals if your drainage 
situation is in any way tricky. See Part III of this book for complete information 
on sustainable grading and drainage.
Planting plans
A planting plan is simple. After you know exactly which plants you want to 
use (check out Chapters 16, 17, and 18 for ideas), you draw them to scale.
The planting plan accomplishes three things. First, it helps you to see how 
many plants you’ll need to purchase. Second, it helps you visualize the final 
planting design. And third, it becomes a reference that you can use at planting 
time to remember exactly what you had in mind. Oh, and if you’re getting a 
permit for your landscaping, you need a planting plan to submit to the agency.
To draw a planting plan, get out a piece of tissue paper, place it over your 
base sheet, and draw a final planting plan like the one shown in Figure 6-5. (If 
you haven’t created a base sheet, check out the earlier section “Using your 
measurements to create a base sheet.”) Use a circle template or a compass to 
draw each plant to scale at its mature size.
For example, say you want to put three Philadelphus ‘Buckley’s Quill’ in the 
back corner of the backyard. Your gardening book says they grow to 5 feet 
tall and 5 feet wide. If you’re working at a 1/4-inch scale, 5 feet in diameter 
would equal 5 quarters on your scale, which is 11/4 inches. Choose that size 
opening on the circle template, place it where the plants will go, and pencil in 
the three circles. Repeat for all the plants you’ll be using, layering as neces-
sary for low-growing plants that are placed under taller ones.
With a little practice and a bit of creativity, you can turn these circles into 
lovely symbols like the ones in Figure 6-5. Or you can just leave them plain, 
with labels showing the name of the plant and the quantity in that grouping.

Irrigation plans
The most sustainable irrigation approach of all is a water-harvesting system. 
You don’t really need to draw plans for that part of the project. However, you 
do need to understand how it all works and how to create a system on your 
property. I cover that thoroughly in Chapter 8.
If you decide to install a permanent irrigation system, there are a couple 
of ways to determine how it all goes together. For most small systems, an 
understanding of basic irrigation design principles and a little time out in the 
yard can be adequate. If your system is large or complex, or if you’ll be hiring 
someone to install it, you may want to draw a detailed irrigation plan or hire 
a pro to do it for you.
 
I don’t have room in this book to coach you through a short course in irriga-
tion design, but fortunately there’s an alternative. All the major irrigation 
manufacturers have handy design and installation tutorials on their Web sites, 
and some of them can even create a design for you at a very modest cost. How 
cool is that? So if you were worried you’d have to become an instant engineer, 
chill. But just to get your bearings, look at Figure 6-6, which shows you what a 
finished irrigation plan looks like.

Getting Down to the Nitty-Gritty 
with Construction Details
Construction detail drawings are images of the guts of a piece of work, laid out 
like an X-ray so you can see exactly what to do. Nearly anything from tree 
staking to electric valves to patios can be the subject of construction details. 
See Figure 6-7 for two examples.

Details are partnered with specifications, which are written instructions that 
cover what can’t be drawn, such as how soon to water plants after installa-
tion, the type of tile to be used on the patio, how much fertilizer to use on the 
plants, and so forth.
As with formal plan drawings, you don’t need formally drawn details and care-
fully written specifications unless you need them for permitting reasons or if 
you’ll be putting the project out to bid. This is really the work of the landscape 
architect, and you may want to hire one if you need this level of detail. But it’s 
good to know how all this works if you’re in a position to need it.
As with everything in landscaping, the little things matter. How much rebar 
goes into a concrete footing influences how strong it is. The kind of wood in a 
deck helps determine its longevity. Details are everything; they drive the out-
come of the project in so many ways. They determine how a project looks, 
how safe it is, and how durable and sustainable it is.
Landscaping For Dummies, by Phillip Giroux, Bob Beckstrom, Lance Wallheim, 
and the Editors of the National Gardening Association (Wiley), has basic 
details for many common construction projects, such as steps, walls, fences, 
and others. You can also find details in many homeowner-oriented how-to 

101
 Chapter 6: Plot ting Your Sustainable Landscape
books on landscaping. These books can give you an idea of how to build 
common landscape structures.
 
When using other books, remember to substitute sustainable materials and 
practices using the information in this book.
For details of truly sustainable landscape construction projects, look for 
books on specific topics such as cob building, water harvesting, or other sub-
jects. There’s plenty to pick from these days. Green Building & Remodeling 
For Dummies, by Eric Corey Freed (Wiley), is a great place to start. And 
don’t forget the Internet, which is crawling with information on how to build 
sustainable landscape features. Even though there’s no one-stop source of 
sustainable landscaping help, you can search on a particular subject, such as 
“cob walls” or “rain gardens” and get lots of good information.
Remaining within the Law: 
Considering Legal Issues
The long arm of the law doesn’t reach as far into landscaping as is does into 
other aspects of modern life. But you certainly need to consider specific legal 
issues when planning your sustainable landscape. Here are a few of the most 
important issues to keep in mind:
 
✓ Architectural review boards: A major landscaping project may require 
community approval to be sure its appearance is consistent with neigh-
boring features. Check with your community’s building or zoning depart-
ment for specifics.
 
✓ Building permits: Permit requirements vary from place to place, of 
course. But generally speaking, you need a building permit — and per-
haps other approvals — to do any kind of major construction, such as 
working on decks, retaining walls, fences, electrical work (other than 
low-voltage lighting), certain portions of your irrigation system, and 
most anything else that affects public safety. In most areas, you don’t 
need a building permit to do planting, minor grading, or other horticul-
turally oriented projects.
 
 The best strategy is to call your city building department and ask which 
permits are required.
 
✓ Covenants, conditions, and restrictions (CC&Rs): These are the legal 
constraints describing what you may and may not do on your property. 
Check your title documents to see how CC&Rs work on your property.
 
✓ Easements: An easement is a legal right of others to enter or work on 
your property. For instance, a utility company, a government entity, or 
another public interest may have access to your property to run power 

102
Par t II: Good Design: The Key to Sustainable Landscaping 
lines, grant beach access, or work on a sewer main. Construction in 
these areas may be restricted if it would get in the way of that access. 
You may find easements in your community as well. The introduction of 
tall trees and other view-blocking features may be controlled on these 
pieces of land. Start by checking the title documents to your property 
and follow up with a call to the county records office and possibly the 
utility companies that serve your area.
 
✓ Legal liability: Take care not to create trip hazards, slippery surfaces, 
and other nuisances for which you could be sued if someone hurts him-
self. Similarly, don’t plant poisonous, treacherously thorny, or highly 
fire-prone plants.
 
✓ Neighbors: Many bitter conflicts over landscaping have destroyed rela-
tionships between neighbors. To avoid such a situation, inform your 
neighbors about your project and apologize in advance for the noise and 
hubbub that will accompany it. Respect your neighbors’ rights to the 
preservation of views, privacy, and sunshine. In other words, don’t plant 
invasive plants or tall trees that will affect the environment of others 
without getting permission first. Similarly, don’t direct storm water onto 
neighboring property (that’s illegal) and don’t destabilize soil on slopes.
 
 If you’re part of a homeowner’s association or other neighborhood 
group, your project may have to be approved by that group. However, 
even if you have a great deal of freedom to do what you want in your 
community, it often isn’t good politics to exercise that freedom to its 
fullest extent.
 
 Work with your neighbors to create a sustainable neighborhood. 
Coordinate food production, develop local water-harvesting systems 
that span property boundaries, and cooperate on safety issues, such fire 
protection. Why let sustainability stop at your property lines? Get the 
whole community involved!
 
✓ Property lines: Have all property lines surveyed before doing any con-
struction. That way you’ll be sure that you aren’t encroaching on your 
neighbor’s property. Otherwise, you may be faced with costly repairs or 
legal bills. Call a licensed land surveyor for help.
 
✓ Zoning and setbacks: Nearly every community has zoning restrictions 
that govern how you can and can’t use your property. This restriction 
controls the presence of livestock, the use of land for commercial pur-
poses, and many other things. Setbacks are invisible, internal boundaries 
within your property in which your freedom to build certain types of 
structures is limited. For example, you probably aren’t allowed to build 
a tall arbor right on your property line where it could affect neighbors. 
Similarly, many communities restrict the height of fences in the front 
yard. Regulations vary from community to community, so check with 
the zoning department at city hall.

Conserving Irrigation 
and Drainage

In this part . . .
U
nless you live in a very wet climate, you probably 
need to water your landscaping. Yes, even sustainable 
plantings need some irrigation now and then. Landscape 
water use has a huge effect on the environment, especially 
in arid zones. But it doesn’t have to be that way.
In this part, you see how to minimize your need for 
imported water by harvesting the rain that falls on your 
property and allowing it to soak into the land or by stor-
ing it for use during the dry season. You also see how to 
design, build, and maintain an efficient irrigation system 
that makes the most of the water you do buy, with mini-
mum waste. You even discover fancy gadgets, such as con-
trollers, that manage water from outer space — amazing 
but true. Finally, you find out about some simple ways to 
manage your watering, with or without a fancy irrigation 
system. That way you apply only the water the landscape 
really needs.

T
he science of sustainable landscaping isn’t a closed book. We’re still 
learning, and some problems are harder to solve than others. Irrigation 
is a tough one, because unless you live in a wet climate or want to carry 
water up from the river in your hat, you may have to depend on some kind 
of technology. Even sustainable landscapes need some supplemental irriga-
tion, if only to get plants established. Most plants, even native ones, perform 
better with optimal watering, and if nature doesn’t provide it, it’s your job to 
take up the slack.
As always, the first step is to build a landscape that follows the rules of 
nature. Choose low water–use plants where possible so that irrigation 
becomes a minor task. Use mulch to help conserve water. Make your garden 
more like a wild system, and you won’t need much water.
Second, develop your land so that it holds as much rainwater as possible. 
Water harvesting is the most sustainable way to get water to your plants with 
a minimum of consumption and fuss. This chapter gets you up to speed on 
these systems.
Finally, if you have to purchase and distribute municipal water, I show you 
how to do it as efficiently as possible. You have to weigh the benefits and 
drawbacks to decide whether a conventional high-tech plastic irrigation 
system is right for your sustainable landscape — and, if so, what kind.
This chapter introduces watering systems and and helps you weigh your 
options. When you’re ready to get your hands dirty (or wet), check out 
Chapter 8 for info on harvesting water and installing irrigation systems.

106
Par t III: Water, Water, Everywhere: Water-Conserving Irrigation and Drainage 
Relying on Mother Nature: The Fully 
Adapted Landscape
The most sustainable option is the landscape that’s so well adapted to your 
conditions that it requires no irrigation system at all. The fully sustainable 
landscape, like wild natural systems, thrives on natural rainfall only. A com-
pletely sustainable landscape certainly is possible anywhere on this planet. 
Lovely native plants grow pretty much everywhere, and nobody waters wil-
derness; rainfall is sufficient for the most beautiful places on earth. Check out 
Chapter 9 and Part V for advice on creating a no-water native landscape.
 
Even native landscapes require supplemental irrigation to get them established. 
This may be as simple as hand-watering if there aren’t too many plants 
involved and you’re careful to apply enough water to irrigate the entire root 
zone. For larger plantings, consider a temporary drip system with an emitter 
or two at each plant (see “Drip irrigation: A smarter way to water”). You can 
use this temporary system during the first year or two and then remove it. Be 
sure to save it to use another time or pass it along to others.
Some people opt for a permanent irrigation system in case of drought — even 
native plants suffer when faced with inadequate rainfall. It’s your choice, but 
remember that an irrigation system comes with unavoidable environmental 
impacts (see “Deciding Whether to Use a Permanent Irrigation System”). If 
you can get by without one, so much the better.
Saving Your Own Rainwater: 
Harvested Water Systems
One of the key strategies in a sustainable landscape is making use of what 
you have to work with on the site. Irrigation is no exception. Harvesting the 
rainwater that falls onto your land is the primary means of ensuring that 
your plantings have the water they need. Using water from the sky has sev-
eral benefits: It’s relatively pure, it picks up nitrogen from the atmosphere 
on the way down, and it’s free. Instead of developing a drainage system that 
efficiently throws all the rain away, as most landscapes do (see Figure 7-1), 
develop your landscape to conserve that water.
In the following sections, I discuss several water-harvesting methods: non-
storage, storage, and graywater. Visit Chapter 8 for information on develop-
ing your own harvesting system.

107
 Chapter 7: Surveying Your Watering Options

resources to

Nonstorage systems
The conventional landscape is often flat or mounded in shape, which causes 
it to spill water rather than absorb it. A water-harvesting landscape is con-
cave (bowl-shaped), with plenty of low points to hold valuable rainwater on 
the site and keep it out of the streets, where it can cause flooding and wash 
pollution into nearby bodies of water. This type of landscape is well suited to 
a nonstorage water-harvesting system. Nonstorage water harvesting involves 
making your landscape as absorbent as possible so that water soaks into the 
ground instead of running off. Figure 7-2 shows a system that uses gutters 
and downspouts to direct water toward plants and a concave terrain that 
holds water naturally.

108
Par t III: Water, Water, Everywhere: Water-Conserving Irrigation and Drainage 
 
A nonstorage system is the cheapest and easiest way to make use of rainfall, 
and therefore it should be your first choice if you’re looking to use rainwater 
without investing in a costly cistern or other storage system. You may even be 
able to develop a zero-runoff landscape, which sheds water only during the 
biggest storms.
A nonstorage water-harvesting landscape can include the following features:
 
✓ Swales, dry streambeds, and bioswales: A swale is a shallow ditch 
with gently sloping sides that runs very gradually downhill in the direc-
tion in which you want water to flow. It allows rainwater to soak in as it 
goes. You can incorporate rounded boulders to create a naturalistic dry 
streambed or plan the swale so that the plants and soil purify the runoff 
water using natural biological processes (this is called a bioswale; see 
Figure 7-3).
 
✓ Percolation chamber: Underneath your swale or at any appropriate, 
stable low point on your property, you can dig a percolation chamber 
(see Figure 7-4). Water drops into the chamber and continues to percolate 
down into the soil, recharging the groundwater. The water goes below the 
roots of most plants but stays out of the street — and out of trouble.

Even when water isn’t running, dry streambeds and bioswales in particular 
are lovely additions to any landscape. But doing water harvesting the wrong 
way involves risks, so be sure to read more about these systems in Chapter 8.
Storage systems
Storing harvested water for use during dry periods is a sustainable way 
to water. Storage systems capture rainwater from the roof and pipe it to a 
nearby tank; when it’s needed, the water is pumped out of the tank into an 
irrigation system. (Better yet, you can allow gravity to do the job, which elim-
inates electricity use and a layer of technology.)
 
The advantage of storing rainwater is that you can use it during the dry 
season, when the plants need it most. Because of the cost of the tank and 
related equipment, the storage method is costlier than the nonstorage method 
in the preceding section. Water storage isn’t for everyone. Choose to store 
water if you can afford to, if you have the space for a tank, and if you’re willing 
to do a bit of maintenance to keep the system operating (see Chapter 10).
The storage method centers on a cistern, an aboveground or underground 
tank made of brick, concrete, or plastic (see Figure 7-5). A cistern is 

110
Par t III: Water, Water, Everywhere: Water-Conserving Irrigation and Drainage 
connected to the roof drains of the house and other buildings. It incorporates 
screens to keep the vermin out, an overflow line for excess water, and some-
times a first-flush system to divert the dirty water from the first rains away from 
the cistern. Water is then gravity fed or pumped into a drip or other 
distribution system.
You can store a bit of rainwater in salvaged 55-gallon drums placed beneath 
your downspouts, of course, but that quantity of water doesn’t go very far 
when you’re irrigating an entire landscape. Similarly, you can store water in 
open ponds, an old swimming pool, or your kid’s red wagon — but shoot, I’m 
talking about a real system here, one that will serve your needs and last a 
long time.
 
I strongly recommend that you do a lot of research on cisterns before you 
jump in (figuratively, I mean). Any number of things can contaminate stored 
water, so the type of cistern system I describe in this section is not meant 
to supply water for personal use such as drinking, cooking, and bathing; the 
water is intended for the landscape only. Other wicked little hazards include 
people drowning because the lid wasn’t locked, poorly made or incorrectly 
installed tanks collapsing, and flooding due to tank or component failure.
Graywater systems
Graywater is the wastewater from washing machines, showers, and sinks (not 
toilets). You can use graywater to irrigate ornamental plants and fruit trees 
as long as (for health reasons) the water doesn’t come to the surface of the 
ground.
Graywater systems range from simple gravity-fed pipelines that drain into 
porous soak zones at the base of plants to complex high-tech contraptions. 
Figure 7-6 gives you an idea of how a simple graywater system works.

Develop a graywater system if you have plants that can use frequent watering 
and if your household generates enough graywater to have an impact on your 
water use. Also be sure your house plumbing is suited to the task of sending 
graywater into the garden. See Chapter 8 for details.
Considering Other Sustainable 
Ways to Water
You don’t necessarily need to invest in a permanent irrigation system. 
Consider two classic methods: watering with a hose and using portable 
sprinklers. Relying on bare-bones watering technology has many benefits: 
it’s simple, it’s cheap, it has a much lower environmental impact than a full-
blown irrigation system, and it’s adequate for a small or low water–use land-
scape. (For details on when and how to water, turn to Chapter 9.)
Watering by hand
A 1999 survey conducted by the American Water Works Association (AWWA) 
found that hand watering uses 33 percent less water than a sprinkler system. 

112
Par t III: Water, Water, Everywhere: Water-Conserving Irrigation and Drainage 
When properly done, hand watering can be very efficient — but it also has 
some downsides. For one, you’re applying the water so fast that you risk 
runoff in heavy soils or on slopes. Also, if you have both a big property and a 
life, hand watering with a hose just isn’t an option — you may find it tough to 
stand there long enough to get the water to really soak in.
 
If you’re going to stand at the end of a hose, you may want to invest in a fancy 
nozzle. My favorite nozzles are the pistol types with a wheel that you can use 
to select the watering pattern: stream, shower, mist, flood, deluge, and so on. 
If you want to save money but still apply water fast, skip the fancy nozzle and 
simply block part of the open end of the hose with your thumb. Works like a 
charm.
Using portable sprinklers
Select portable sprinklers for even coverage. I like oscillating sprinklers 
because they apply water slowly but in larger streams that don’t blow away 
easily. Sprinklers with old-fashioned impact-type heads (tssh-tssh-tssh-tik-tik-
tik-tik-tik) are fun to watch and easy to adjust for distance of throw. I’ve never 
tried the sprinklers that walk around the yard on their own; they kind of 
scare me.
 
If you set out portable sprinklers, move them around periodically to get 
good coverage, and time the application so you don’t waste water. Check out 
Chapter 9 for more info about watering wisely.
Deciding Whether to Use a 
Permanent Irrigation System
If you find yourself seduced by the charms of a permanent irrigation system, 
don’t feel bad. Although there’s clearly a negative impact to using that much 
plastic and other materials, and despite the decidedly unnatural presence of 
a life support system of this kind, irrigation systems do a good job of keeping 
your plantings well-watered and vigorous.
In fact, there are plenty of times when an irrigation system is the only reason-
able option. If you live in a climate with long dry spells during the growing 
season, or if your property is large, nothing will keep things going quite like 
a drip or sprinkler system. The same is true if your soils are very sandy and 
require frequent watering or if they’re heavy clay that’s slow to absorb water, 
making hand watering problematic.

113
 Chapter 7: Surveying Your Watering Options
Considering the pros of irrigation systems
When well designed and properly used, an irrigation system works on behalf 
of the environment and offers the following benefits:
 
✓ Marginal land brought into cultivation: Turning a barren corner of 
your property into a green space that’s generating oxygen, sequestering 
carbon dioxide, providing habitat for wild things, or growing food for 
you is a wonderful thing to accomplish. Even if the change takes a little 
supplemental water and an irrigation system, the situation is better than 
the way things were.
 
✓ Time savings: Use the time you would’ve spent watering to work on 
behalf of endangered species or some other cause.
 
✓ Health of the plants: Hand-watering methods often leave a lot to be 
desired in terms of coverage and penetration. You may think that you’ve 
watered adequately, only to find dry soil an inch below ground. An irri-
gation system can solve this problem.
 
✓ Potential efficiency: Because you can operate an irrigation system to 
virtually eliminate runoff, it can deliver water with little or no waste.
 
✓ Potential water conservation: Using water efficiently means using less 
of it. Delivering water to the plants (and only to the plants) in the exact 
quantities required uses the least water possible.
 
✓ Watershed protection: Runoff of landscape water and leaching of 
nutrients and garden chemicals can damage streams, rivers, lakes, and 
oceans. An irrigation system keeps water on site, where it belongs.
Weighing the cons of irrigation systems
Lifetime water savings and overall garden health may not adequately offset 
the materials and energy consumed by an irrigation system. No one really 
knows for sure. Here are some potential negative environmental effects to 
consider:
 
✓ Plastics use: Nearly all plastics are made from fossil fuels, which are 
nonrenewable, dwindling, and extracted from the earth in ways that 
cause massive environmental and social damage. Until someone figures 
out how to make durable plastic out of soybeans or old coffee grounds, 
we’re stuck with the petroleum-based kind.
 
✓ PVC pipe: PVC pipe is arguably the very worst aspect of an irrigation 
system. The plastic used to make the rigid pipe and fittings, as well as 
much of the other hardware in an irrigation system, is an environmental 
nightmare for several reasons: It’s made from petroleum; its manufac-
ture causes the release of massive amounts of dioxin, one of the most 

114
Par t III: Water, Water, Everywhere: Water-Conserving Irrigation and Drainage 
toxic manmade materials in existence; making the chlorine that goes 
into PVC requires a lot of energy (in fact, it requires an amount equiva-
lent to that produced by eight nuclear power plants); the solvents used 
to fasten the pipe and fittings are hazardous to installers; and currently, 
the pipe isn’t recyclable.
 
 Alternatives to PVC pipe are available. Drip tubing is made of polyethyl-
ene, which also comes from petroleum but is nontoxic, isn’t cemented 
together, and is at least theoretically recyclable. A pipe called cross-
linked polyethylene works for pressure lines, eliminating PVC almost 
entirely. Cross-linked polyethylene has been used in Europe for quite a 
while now; it’s reliable and easy to work with.
 
✓ Possible overwatering: Overwatering kills plants. You can prevent 
overwatering easily enough by using some simple management tips (see 
Chapter 9). But remember that an irrigation system can be an efficient 
plant-murdering device.
 
✓ Potential waste of water: A perfect irrigation system can still waste tons 
of water if it’s managed poorly. The American Water Works Association 
found that in-ground sprinkler systems use 35 percent more water 
and that drip systems use 16 percent more than properties without a 
system. This difference isn’t due to deficiencies in the systems them-
selves but in the ways they’re managed. The worst offenders can be 
automatic controllers, which I cover at the end of this chapter.
Choosing a Permanent Irrigation System
After you’ve decided to invest in a permanent irrigation system, you have to 
decide what kind to get. Unfortunately, irrigation systems don’t come in a 
nice tidy box with all the parts and instructions and special tools, as if you 
were buying a piece of furniture. Instead, you have to design the system to 
fit your particular situation, and then you have to build it from hundreds of 
parts gathered up from bins at the irrigation supply store. It’s challenging, 
but anyone can do it. Your first step is to figure out where you’ll be using 
sprinklers and where a drip system would be a better choice. In the following 
sections, I give you the ins and outs of the different approaches.
Sprinkler systems: Spritzing 
water everywhere
Sprinklers are generally more wasteful than drip systems (which I cover in 
the next section) because they apply water in less efficient ways. However, 
they still have a place in the sustainable landscape. Overhead sprinkler sys-
tems are designed primarily for watering lawns, which need even, shallow 

115
 Chapter 7: Surveying Your Watering Options
water delivery. They’re also used for ground covers, flower beds, and similar 
large areas of relatively shallow-rooted plants. (Note: A permanent sprinkler 
system is buried in the ground. The term overhead refers to the fact that 
sprinklers spray water into the air rather than applying it directly to the soil, 
as a drip system does.)
Sprinkling by design
A typical permanent sprinkler system consists of heads that either pop up 
from the ground or are fixed on plastic risers. The heads are connected by 
an underground network of pipe and are controlled by a manual or electric 
valve. When the system is in operation, arcs of water squirt out of each head, 
spraying the irrigated area from several directions for better coverage.
Benefits and drawbacks
The following are some advantages of permanent overhead sprinklers:
 
✓ Water application is visible (and quite attractive to watch).
 
✓ Foliage gets washed off during irrigation.
 
✓ You can use the system to wash fertilizer into the soil.
Here are some disadvantages of permanent overhead sprinklers:
 
✓ They’re susceptible to wind drift, runoff, evaporative loss, and misting, 
all of which waste water.
 
✓ Coverage is about 70 percent accurate at best, resulting in overwatering 
to compensate for dry spots, which wastes water.
 
✓ Sidewalks, driveways, houses, cars, slow-moving pedestrians, and 
domestic animals often get watered too. They seldom benefit.
 
✓ Runoff wastes water and can make pavement dangerously slippery.
 
✓ Overhead watering brings up lots of weeds.
 
✓ Impact-type heads can be noisy.
 
✓ Sprinkler heads can be trip hazards if they’re installed near traffic areas.
Drip irrigation: A smarter way to water
Permanent sprinklers are being displaced more and more by drip systems, 
which greatly reduce water use. A drip system is made up of flexible poly-
ethylene pipe, usually installed on the surface of the ground and covered by 
mulch, with small drip emitters that are either plugged into holes punched in 
the tubing or molded directly into it. (The latter type is much more durable 
and easier to install.)

116
Par t III: Water, Water, Everywhere: Water-Conserving Irrigation and Drainage 
Drip irrigation is controlled with a manual or automatic control valve the 
same way as an overhead sprinkler system. But it has two additions: a small 
filter to prevent dirt and other particulate matter from plugging the emitters 
and a small pressure regulator to reduce the pressure, which prevents the 
tubing from blowing apart. Chapter 8 provides info on designing an efficient 
drip system.
To drip, or not to drip: The good and the bad
Here are the advantages of a drip system:
 
✓ Direct application of water into the soil results in little or no runoff, no 
spray drift, and consequently no wasted water or safety problems.
 
✓ Drip systems are nearly 100 percent efficient, delivering all the water to 
the root zone of the plants in an even pattern throughout the area.
 
✓ Because most of the soil surface remains dry, you’ll have fewer weeds.
 
✓ Most plants really love being drip-irrigated and respond with strong, 
healthy growth; sturdy root systems; and reduced disease problems.
 
✓ The system is invisible and silent when it’s in operation.
 
✓ No trenching is required to install a drip system.
 
✓ Costs of materials and installation are comparable to (or lower than) 
those of a sprinkler system, and your water bill will be smaller.
These are the disadvantages of a drip system:
 
✓ Drip tubing can be damaged by careless digging, rodents, vandalism, 
and foot traffic.
 
✓ You can’t see or hear a drip system working, so you can easily forget to 
turn it off if you have a manually operated system. You can set a timer 
to remind you, of course, or automate your system (see the section on 
automatic irrigation controllers later in this chapter).
 
✓ A drip system won’t wash fertilizer into the soil. Instead, when you apply 
fertilizer, you have to water it by hand or with a portable overhead 
sprinkler, or you can apply it just before a good soaking rain.
 
✓ Drippers don’t wash off foliage or keep mulch moist. It’s a good idea to 
supplement drip irrigation with an occasional overhead watering, if only 
to keep things clean. Cleanliness isn’t just for the sake of appearance; 
photosynthesis works better when plant leaves are free of dust and dirt.
Misconceptions about drip
If you talk to enough people in the landscaping business, sooner or later 
you’ll run across an anti-drip zealot who jumps up and down about how bad 

117
 Chapter 7: Surveying Your Watering Options
drip systems are. No offense to these well-meaning people, but they’re very 
wrong about drip. They usually don’t understand how drip works, or they’ve 
installed systems poorly and have suffered the consequences.
Here are some of the misconceptions about drip and why they’re wrong:
 
✓ Drip doesn’t last. Poorly installed systems of any kind don’t last. But 
drip tubing is made of polyethylene, which will endure far longer than 
us, our gardens, and probably civilization itself. Unless it’s damaged, 
your drip system won’t have longevity problems.
 
✓ The emitters plug up. If you’ve installed a proper filter, the tiny particles 
that get through it will also get through the emitters, because their 
openings are bigger than the openings in the filter. If you keep your fil-
ters in good shape by periodically cleaning them and replacing damaged 
inserts, you’ll never have a problem with plugging.
 
 The one exception is the nasty problem called bacterial iron slime, which 
can grow in emitters and quickly plug them. See Chapter 8 for info about 
identifying bacterial iron slime.
 
✓ Drip doesn’t cover properly. Use the grid system to water entire root 
zones. This method is the solution to the coverage problem, and it really 
works. I cover this concept in detail in Chapter 8.
Shying away from soaker hoses 
and mini-sprinklers
I’ve never been too fond of soaker hoses or 
mini-sprinklers. Here’s why:
 ✓ Soaker hoses are long tubes made of plas-
tic or recycled rubber tires, connected to 
a faucet. Allegedly, they emit water along 
their entire length, saturating the soil 
directly beneath them. I’ve found, however, 
that all the water comes out in one or two 
places, usually in low spots. This happens 
because soaker hoses provide no internal 
control over the distribution of the water as 
drip systems do so well.
 ✓ Mini-sprinklers are tiny sprinkler heads that 
are installed on drip tubing. Mini-sprinklers 
are fine for specialized applications, such 
as potted plants, some vegetable plantings, 
and very small areas. However, the mist they 
deliver is very fine, so it tends to blow away 
or evaporate before it reaches the soil. Also, 
the heads are fragile and easy to knock off 
kilter, resulting in uneven coverage.

118
Par t III: Water, Water, Everywhere: Water-Conserving Irrigation and Drainage 
Adding an automatic irrigation controller
The busy folks at the American Water Works Association found that installing 
an automatic controller on a manual system increases water use by 47 per-
cent. This statistic seems to indict controllers as being very nonsustainable. 
But when properly used, controllers really can save lots of water.
 
Don’t assume you need a controller. It isn’t a requisite component of a good 
irrigation system, and there’s no shame in having a manually operated system 
that you turn on and off yourself. Still, if you have heavy soils or a large prop-
erty, or you’re disabled, busy, or just lazy, a controller may be the solution.
Advantages and disadvantages of an automatic system
Here are some benefits of using automated irrigation controllers:
 
✓ You can cycle the controller to prevent runoff in tight soils and on 
slopes. For instance, you can set it to water for 5 minutes at a time, 
repeating the cycle every hour so the water has a chance to soak in.
 
✓ Most controllers are easy to operate. Smart controllers (which I cover 
later in this chapter) are a little more difficult to program, but you only 
have to set them up once.
 
✓ You get exact control of your watering program and don’t have to 
depend on your memory or walk around with a stopwatch.
 
✓ A controller works even when you aren’t there.
 
✓ Standard controllers require adjustment only for seasonal changes and 
extreme weather conditions. Smart controllers don’t have to be adjusted 
at all.
The following are some drawbacks of using automated irrigation controllers:
 
✓ They aren’t totally automatic. Unless you have a smart controller 
(see the next section), making them work efficiently is up to you.
 
✓ They have to be programmed carefully. If they’re programmed to 
overwater, for example, they continue to do so for as long as you 
pay your water and electric bills.
 
✓ You have to make seasonal adjustments to the program to get 
sustainable results.
Smart versus dumb controllers — and why it matters
A traditional controller is just a timer. For example, you set it to turn on valves 
1, 3, and 7 for 20 minutes each at 6 a.m. on Tuesdays and Fridays. The control-
ler does this until you tell it differently, because it’s ignorant of outside 

119
 Chapter 7: Surveying Your Watering Options
conditions. Unfortunately, conditions change constantly. And when you think 
about it, time has nothing to do with water need. The conditions that regulate 
water demand — temperature, wind, cloud cover, humidity, precipitation, and 
of course, the seasons — are in a constant state of flux.
Smart controllers are different. They’re keyed in to actual conditions, getting 
data from local weather stations and translating that data into an ever-chang-
ing program that’s sent to your controller by satellite. (Some smart control-
lers come with their own weather station that lives right in your backyard; 
others use “historical” weather data for your area, which isn’t nearly as accu-
rate as real-time information.)
 
A system with a smart controller, which some people call “watering from 
outer space,” works really well and can reduce your water use by 20 to 50 
percent or more. Smart controllers cost more than conventional ones, but you 
recoup that cost quickly in water savings.
To use a smart controller, you program it one time (when you install it), fine-
tune it a bit during the first few weeks, and then never touch it again. The con-
troller asks you for soil type, kinds of plants, slope, exposure (sun or shade, for 
example), and other facts about the environmental conditions in each zone. It 
uses this information to modify the incoming schedule for each zone.

The Nuts and Bolts of Water 
Harvesting, Irrigation, and 
Drainage
In This Chapter
▶ Designing a rainwater-friendly landscape
▶ Irrigating the natural way with storage and nonstorage irrigation
▶ Using graywater in an irrigation system
▶ Installing permanent systems and making them more sustainable
▶ Facilitating drainage without damage
T
his chapter provides the basics of how water harvesting, permanent 
irrigation, and drainage systems are put together and what makes them 
tick. If you aren’t the nuts-and-bolts type, you may be tempted to skip this 
chapter. Please consider, however, the importance of water to all landscapes, 
and remember your role in creating an appropriate, sustainable water system 
for your property. Chances are that your land was set up to drain water away 
as quickly as possible. In most cases, that kind of design isn’t sustainable and 
needs to be changed.
 
To get the most out of your landscaping and to be a responsible water 
manager, you need to understand how these systems work, even if you plan 
to hire someone to install one. Take the time to educate yourself to make sure 
that you get a truly sustainable water system.
You can find that information right here. Read on for info on setting up a 
water system.

Making Your Property a 
Home for Rainwater
In Chapter 7, I cover the basic principles of harvesting rainwater. In this sec-
tion, I provide some tips on how to make it happen on your property. Some 
water-harvesting strategies are good do-it-yourself projects; others should be 
done by professionals. I alert you when you need to hire someone.
 
Water harvesting is a big subject. If you’d like more information, check out 
the Rainwater Harvesting series (Volumes I–II), by Brad Lancaster (Rainsource 
Press). Or refer to any of several books on these various strategies by Art Ludwig 
(www.oasisdesign.net) or Robert Kourik (www.robertkourik.com).
Follow the water
Your first task is to look hard at your site to determine where the water 
comes from and where you can intercept it. The main idea behind a water-
harvesting system is to collect water from as many places as possible and 
deliver it to as many places as possible. So you need to identify collection 
and delivery points. Start at the high points of your land and follow the path 
of the water as it flows across the ground, running along low points in the 
terrain; also follow the water as it runs off your roof into gutters and down-
spouts. Perform the water-flow check while it’s raining so you see what really 
happens, not what you think might happen.
Picture the possibilities
Imagine the shape of your land in light of your objective: slowing the moving 
water and giving it as many opportunities as possible to soak in and irrigate 
your proposed plantings. Also look at sources of graywater, such as washing 
machines and sinks; you may be able to use that water to irrigate fruit trees 
or other plantings. Finally, consider where you can install a cistern, either 
above or below ground, to capture roof runoff for use during the dry season.
It’s also important to consider how and where you’ll dispose of runoff 
beyond what your water-harvesting system can handle. In other words, if the 
rain falls hard and long enough, at some point it will fill your cistern and satu-
rate your soil. All the rain that falls after that point has to be removed from 
the property safely. That’s the job of your conventional drainage system — a 
topic that I cover at the end of this chapter.

123
 Chapter 8: The Nuts and Bolts of Water Harvesting, Irrigation, and Drainage
Think safety
 
Be sure to take safety, legality, and the integrity of your land into account 
when developing a water-harvesting system. The following considerations can 
keep you out of trouble:
 
✓ If you live where rainfall is more or less continuous during part of the 
year, or if your soil is heavy clay or has a hardpan layer that holds 
water, be careful not to create concave areas that drown plants.
 
✓ If your property is on a hillside or has potentially unstable soil, check 
with a geologist before you attempt to increase the amount of water that 
soaks into your land. When improperly handled, water harvesting can 
cause a major landslide.
 
✓ Make sure all ponding areas are lower than your house and other 
structures; otherwise, they may flood.
Be wise: Hire a professional if you have even the slightest concern. The con-
sequences of a badly designed water harvesting system can be catastrophic. 
Whatever you do, don’t get in over your head.
Make a sketch and check it twice
Make a quick sketch of your re-engineered watershed (or catchment area), 
showing the proposed new path of the water, including all swales (shallow 
ditches), ponding zones, and other features. (I explain these terms in the 
later section “Factoring in the right features.”)
Double-check your plans to be sure that water goes where you want it to and 
that excess water leaves quietly. Your plan should look like Figure 7-2 (see 
Chapter 7). If, with your plan, you’ll turn your property into a big sponge, 
with no appreciable runoff other than excess water, congratulations! You’re 
on your way to a truly sustainable landscape that operates mostly on natural 
inputs and that keeps stormwater from damaging the environment.
Creating a Nonstorage Water-
Harvesting System
Nonstorage irrigation systems use the land itself to hold water, mimicking the 
way natural watersheds function. By contouring the land to create flow lines 
for the water to slowly travel along and low spots where it can soak in, you 

124
Par t III: Water, Water, Everywhere: Water-Conserving Irrigation and Drainage 
accomplish your goal without purchasing materials, and you expend little 
or no extra effort in the process (assuming you were going to grade the land 
anyway).
 
Nonstorage water harvesting can be done on any geologically stable site but 
preferably not on a hillside, where saturated soil can cause problems. Check 
with a geologist if you aren’t sure about your site’s stability.
How much water can you save with a nonstorage irrigation system? Well, 
an inch of water falling on 2,500 square feet of land — about the size of the 
footprint of an average tract house — makes 1,400 gallons of water available 
to your plants. That’s 1,400 gallons of water you don’t have to buy and 1,400 
gallons less impact on the environment. Multiply that figure by the inches of 
rainfall you get annually, and you’ll see that water harvesting amounts to a 
major benefit. Don’t you wonder why you’ve been throwing water away all 
this time?
Grading your property
To develop your property into a water-harvesting system, grade the land so 
that it has low spots to soak up water. Also make sure that paved areas are 
pervious (they allow water to pass through them into the soil) or that they 
shed the water that falls on them into an adjacent vegetated area.
If you have an underground drainage system to take away excess water, set the 
tops of your catch basins 2 to 4 inches above grade so that water pools around 
them (see the section on drainage systems at the end of this chapter).
 
You may be required to get a grading permit if your system is a large one with 
lots of soil being moved around. Check with your local building department to 
be sure.
 
Be sure to keep all water away from your house and other buildings. Your 
water-harvesting zones should begin at least 10 feet out from the foundations. 
Also test your soil to make sure it percolates adequately for the water to soak 
in. Doing so is important because standing water breeds mosquitoes. And 
never, ever mess with natural streams or other watercourses; modifying them 
is illegal, and you may cause erosion or other serious problems. Besides, real 
streams often carry a lot of water, and your hard work could simply wash 
away in the next rain.

125
 Chapter 8: The Nuts and Bolts of Water Harvesting, Irrigation, and Drainage
Factoring in the right features
A safe, effective nonstorage system incorporates some or all of the following 
features:
 
✓ Swales: Swales are shallow, low ditches through which water moves 
from high to low points. Locate your swales on gentle slopes, not steep 
ones, where they could cause erosion problems.
 
 Swales can swerve back and forth artistically across your land, becom-
ing giant earth sculptures that also happen to be habitats for plants. See 
Chapter 7 for more on swales.
 
✓ Ponding zones: Shallow depressions (10 to 20 inches deep) called pond-
ing zones are located at low points where the water can soak into the 
ground. These low points are good places to plant trees to use the cap-
tured water. However, note that the trees go next to the ponding zone, 
not in the bottom, where they could drown.
 
 Ponding zones should be located to the side of drainage paths, out of 
the direct path of the strongest flow. They’re filled by the swales above 
them, and excess water moves along through more swales on the low 
side of the ponding zones. Keep ponding zones away from septic sys-
tems and leach fields, and make sure they won’t back up and cause 
flooding where you don’t want it.
 
✓ Percolation chambers: Closely related to ponding zones are percola-
tion chambers, which are underground gravel-filled pits that hold lots of 
water. Roots use the water that these chambers collect. See Chapter 7 
for more on percolation chambers.
 
✓ Terraces: You can use terraces on hillsides to slow and hold water but 
only if you’re sure that they won’t affect the stability of the land. On 
gentle slopes, your terraces can be simple contours made of the earth 
itself. On steeper slopes, use retaining walls to hold soil in place; talk to 
a civil engineer about this type of project.
 
✓ Dutch drain: A Dutch drain is an underground polyethylene drainage 
pipe that’s perforated with holes so the water leaks out. It’s placed over 
a gravel-filled trench.
 
 One end of the drain can be connected to the downspout that takes water 
from your roof. The other end can emerge from the soil (or it can daylight, 
as we say in the business) at a safe location. Excess water is removed 
from the area safely, while the bulk of the water leaks out of the pipe into 
the porous gravel and then into the soil, where roots will find it.

126
Par t III: Water, Water, Everywhere: Water-Conserving Irrigation and Drainage 
 
✓ Pervious pavement: Using pervious pavement is a great strategy for 
keeping water on your property. If your paving isn’t pervious (or if pervi-
ous paving isn’t an option for you because of unsuitable soil or geologi-
cal conditions), use conventional nonpervious paving as a catchment 
feature that drains water into nearby swales and ponding zones. Read 
about pervious paving choices in Chapter 12.
I discuss how to install most of these features in the later section “Working 
your plan.”
Planning your work
Like any sustainable landscaping project, water harvesting benefits from 
careful observation of the site and meticulous planning. Because it’s so dif-
ficult to fix mistakes in major, underlying changes like grading and landform, 
and because the consequences of bad planning are potentially serious, it’s 
important to pay attention to what you’re doing.
I can’t go into all the depth you need here, so plan on honing your skills with 
some of the books and Web sites I mention throughout this section. And as 
always, work with a pro if you aren’t completely sure of what you’re doing.
Planning for a water-harvesting system is best done out on site, not at a draw-
ing board. In this case, planning and implementation are both physical acts. 
You may want to sketch out your design on paper, but don’t consider it to be 
of primary importance.
 
A wonderful first step in the planning process is to visit a real creek or stream 
to get the idea of how nature makes irrigation work. Notice how the water 
flows, where it erodes banks, where and how it pools, how the stones look, 
and where the plants grow. The more your system is like nature, the better it’s 
going to work.
After your visit to the creek, come home and consider how you can imple-
ment the principles you observed in nature on your own land. You won’t be 
replicating what you saw of course, but you will be making your land work in 
a natural way. Make sure that your strategy relates to existing and proposed 
vegetation and to any hardscape features you already have or plan to 
construct.
To get your ideas going, follow these steps:
 
1. Starting at the top of your property, use a band of powdered gypsum 
or lime to lay out the approximate path of the water from top to 
bottom.

127
 Chapter 8: The Nuts and Bolts of Water Harvesting, Irrigation, and Drainage
 
2. Develop a system of swales to move the water back and forth across 
the land, and add basins and ponding zones at frequent intervals so 
water slows down enough to soak in.
 
 Vary both the depth and width of your swales for a more natural and 
more absorbent outcome. Getting the overall layout correct is critical. 
If the swales are too steep, the water will run off, possibly picking up 
enough speed to cause erosion. If the swales are too gradual or don’t go 
downhill at all, water may back up where you don’t want it.
 
 Checking these features by eye can be difficult. You need to check the 
elevations throughout the system by using a sighting level or transit (sur-
veying devices that measure the elevations of the land) to be sure that 
your swales run downhill. If you don’t have a lot of surveying experi-
ence, you may want to work with a landscape professional.
 
3. At the lowest points in the system, determine your overflow routes 
where excess water should go, and put spillways at those points.
 
 A spillway is a slightly lowered portion of the bank that forms the swale; it 
creates a path for water to get out. Use multiple spillways, if possible, to 
distribute the water evenly (concentrated flows of water can cause ero-
sion problems). Make sure the spillways drain into safe places and won’t 
flood neighboring properties, cause erosion, or present safety hazards.
 
 The volume and velocity of the water at this point can be very high, so 
stabilize your spillways with heavy boulders or other structures. Either 
add plants and mulch or put boulders in all vulnerable points in the 
system — wherever water flow could erode soil.
Working your plan
The physical act of creating a nonstorage irrigation system isn’t complicated. 
The tools aren’t complicated, either: You need a pick or mattock (which is 
like a pickaxe with a flat blade), maybe a digging bar, a shovel, and a rake. 
You know what I’m going to tell you next. Yup. Start digging.
Swales
Create each swale by making a shallow ditch. Place the soil from your ditch 
on the downhill side of the swale, creating a bank like a little levee (or put the 
soil on both sides, where the land on both sides of the swale is equally high). 
Be sure to leave extra soil on the outside of turns, where potential for erosion 
and blowouts is greater.
If you’ll be adding boulders to the swale to make it into a dry streambed, 
choose rounded rock forms, not angular or broken pieces. Vary the sizes, 
being sure to include some big boulders — as large as you can safely move. 

128
Par t III: Water, Water, Everywhere: Water-Conserving Irrigation and Drainage 
Bury at least one-third of each large boulder so that it isn’t just sitting on the 
surface. To make things look more natural, place a few boulders on top of 
others, as though rushing water tossed them there. Make sure that your boul-
ders are big enough that they won’t wash away. And, finally, never use gravel 
in the bottom of the swale where the water runs; it’ll be gone in the first good 
storm.
Ponding zones
Mark off the borders of your ponding zones with gypsum or lime. (You can 
make the ponds interesting shapes, if you like.) Adjust the depth so you 
won’t have standing water for more than 12 hours after a rain; if your soil 
drains quickly, you can make your ponding zones as much as 18 inches deep. 
Surround your ponding zone with a berm (a low mound made of the earth 
you remove from the basin of the ponding zone itself) that’s at least 2 feet 
wide so the zone lasts a long time.
The bottom of each basin should be flat and level so the water spreads out as 
much as possible. If the soil is compacted, break it up with a pick. Plant and 
mulch your basins for stability.
You can make swales and ponding zones deep and visible or so shallow that 
nobody but you knows they exist; this decision is an aesthetic one that’s up 
to you. The basins will eventually fill with mulch and plants, anyway, becom-
ing less apparent than they were when they were new.
Percolation chambers
To make a percolation chamber, follow these steps:
 
1. Dig a hole at least 4 feet wide and 2 feet deep.
 
2. Rough up the bottom of the hole with a pick or digging bar.
 
3. Line the bottom and sides of the hole with synthetic filter fabric.
 
 Filter fabric is an environmentally less-than-perfect (but in this case 
useful) material that keeps soil and roots from filling the voids between 
the rocks.
 
4. Dump 1- to 2-inch rounded gravel or crushed rock into the pit, up to 
about 6 inches below the surface of the soil.
 
5. Cover the pit with another piece of filter fabric.
 
6. Top it off with your swale or dry streambed.
 
 You can also run pipes from your downspouts or from your under-
ground drainage system into the percolation chamber.

129
 Chapter 8: The Nuts and Bolts of Water Harvesting, Irrigation, and Drainage
 
Before you dig, check for any utilities in the area, and make sure you aren’t 
digging on top of a septic system or any other underground structures. See 
Chapter 11 for details on who to call before you start work.
Terraces
If you’re going to build terraces, first check with a civil engineer or a geolo-
gist to ensure that it’s safe to do so. They can also help you develop a design 
that will hold up to the forces of gravity. You may need to get a building 
permit for your retaining walls.
On shallow ground with less than a 3:1 slope (1 foot of elevation change 
for every 3 feet of horizontal distance), you probably can get away without 
installing retaining walls. On steeper slopes, make walls from urbanite (sal-
vaged broken concrete), wooden timbers or logs, natural stone, or a reusable 
segmental retaining wall system. (See Chapter 14 for information on building 
retaining walls.)
If you aren’t building retaining walls, follow the procedure in the earlier 
“Swales” section to make your terraces. Excavate earth and form it into a berm 
on the downhill side, creating a level area behind the berm. If your topsoil layer 
is thin, remove it, grade the soil underneath, and replace the topsoil when 
you’re done. Compact and stabilize the berm by stomping on it. Prevent ero-
sion by planting sturdy plants with good root systems and by covering the soil 
with a 3- to 4-inch layer of organic mulch such as wood chips.
Dutch drains
In its simplest form, a Dutch drain is a ditch filled with coarse gravel. Water 
runs into it from surrounding areas and soaks into the soil, where plants 
can take advantage of it. That system works fine, but more sophisticated 
approaches can make it last longer and work better.
To construct a first-class Dutch drain, follow these steps:
 
1. Dig a ditch at least 1 foot deep and 10 inches wide.
 
2. Drape a large piece of filter fabric down into the bottom of the ditch 
and up the sides.
 
 Make sure that the material extends far enough onto the ground on each 
side of the trench so you can fold the material over to cover the top of 
the system after you’re done installing the gravel (and pipe, if used).
 
3. Place a layer of 1- to 2-inch diameter gravel or crushed rock or any 
similar porous material — even rubble — in the ditch, leaving room 
for the pipe (if you’ll be using one).

130
Par t III: Water, Water, Everywhere: Water-Conserving Irrigation and Drainage 
 
4. Install the pipe (if you’re using one) on top of the gravel.
 
 Use 4-inch corrugated polyethylene perforated drainpipe wrapped in 
a special filter fabric “sock”, which you can purchase at any irrigation 
supply store. (The staff will know exactly what you need.) Hook the pipe 
to your downspout. Run the end of the pipe up and out of the trench, 
and extend it to a safe place where the excess water can drain away 
without causing erosion, leaving the end of the pipe open. Place a 1- to 
3-inch deep layer of rock over the pipe to cover it.
 
5. Flop the two edges of the filter fabric over the whole mess as if you’re 
rolling up a burrito.
 
6. Cover with topsoil, stomp on it to compact it, and then smooth it off 
with a rake.
Storing Harvested Water
A rainwater storage system uses a tank called a cistern to hold the water. 
The most common source of water is the roof. You deliver water from the 
roof to the cistern by connecting the downspout from your gutters to the 
cistern with a pipe. Water is held in the cistern until the dry season, when it’s 
pumped or gravity-fed into your swales or a ditch or it’s delivered by a hose 
or drip system. See Chapter 7 for more on cistern systems.
Assembling the components
Standard components of a cistern system include the following:
 
✓ A way for the water to enter the tank and a way for it to leave
 
✓ A drain that’s used for periodic cleanouts
 
✓ An overflow pipe that allows excess water to leave the system in a 
controlled way
 
✓ A vent that allows air to come and go as the tank empties and fills
 
✓ An access door at the top that allows a worker to get inside to do 
servicing work
 
✓ Devices to keep animals from entering the tank
As for the tank itself, it can be made of steel, plastic, masonry, concrete, 
wood, or other materials. Composition is where sustainability goes a little 
sideways, because all these materials have significant environmental 
impacts. To boil a complex discussion down to the basics, avoid PVC tanks. 
High-density polyethylene (HDPE) is the most popular tank material; it’s 

131
 Chapter 8: The Nuts and Bolts of Water Harvesting, Irrigation, and Drainage
fairly nontoxic as far as anyone knows, and it has the lowest impact of any 
suitable plastic. It’s relatively inexpensive, but it’s also totally butt-ugly, so 
plan to camouflage this sucker with plants or fencing. Sometimes, you can 
find a used HDPE or steel tank for cheap.
Developing a cistern system
Creating a cistern system is a field day for techie types. On the other hand, 
it’s probably not such a great experience if your idea of doing plumbing is 
changing the washer in a leaky faucet. But if you’re ready for the challenge, 
creating a cistern system can be a fun project. The following sections show 
you the story, in a nutshell, of how to complete the project. Remember: If 
you lack confidence in your plumbing abilities, work with a licensed plumber 
who’s experienced in cisterns.
Get tanked
Before you do anything else, decide where you’ll place your tank and whether 
it’ll be aboveground (less expensive, uglier, but preferable overall) or under-
ground (more expensive and subject to collapsing and floating out of the 
ground). I proceed on the assumption that your tank will be aboveground.
In the ideal scenario, your house is on top of a hill, and the landscaping is 
downhill from the house. The tank should be located next to the house so 
that it can gravity-feed into the yard. If the tank is lower, count on using a 
small electric pump to send the water uphill.
 
Keep these points in mind:
 
✓ Make sure your tank is located on undisturbed, stable soil (not fill soil). 
After all, 1,000 gallons of water weighs as much as two cars.
 
✓ Leave enough room to walk around your tank for servicing.
 
✓ Make sure the surrounding soil slopes away from the tank in all 
directions.
Size up your storage
After you know where you want to house your cistern, decide how much 
water you want to store. There’s a whole science to sizing cisterns, but an easy 
rule of thumb is to keep it to a maximum of 5,000 gallons. How far through the 
dry season that amount will take you depends on the size of your garden, the 
water needs of your plants, the climate, the soil, and other factors. It’s a safe 
bet that you’ll still have to buy water, which is why I include information on 
conventional irrigation systems in this book (see Chapters 7 and 10).

132
Par t III: Water, Water, Everywhere: Water-Conserving Irrigation and Drainage 
Install the cistern
How you install your cistern depends on what it’s made of. Count on at least 
getting help from some strong friends, and know that you may even need 
heavy equipment to move this big boy. Here are some general guidelines to 
keep in mind for each type of cistern:
 
✓ Plastic: Place a plastic tank on a smooth, 1- to 2-inch-thick layer of com-
pacted fine pea gravel (the rounded kind) or sand (but make sure it 
won’t wash away).
 
✓ Steel: If your tank is steel, place it on a bed of compacted coarse gravel, 
which keeps the bottom of the tank dry and postpones the inevitable 
rusting.
 
✓ Concrete: If you’ll be installing a concrete or other type of tank, work 
with a qualified contractor.
Distribute the water
If you have enough elevation change to depend on gravity to send the water 
out to your plants, use a hose or possibly a drip system to distribute it 
(making sure to filter that drip system). If you’re using a pump, you can apply 
the water with a hose, a drip system, or even sprinklers.
 
When setting up a cistern, some subtle but important details are involved in 
connecting the inlet, outlet, drain, and other pipes to the tank. For example, 
the inlet has to have an air gap between it and the high-water mark so the 
water can’t siphon out of the tank, and the drain pipe has to be carefully 
located to make cleaning sludge out of the bottom relatively easy instead of 
having to mop it up and haul it out through the top in buckets. I don’t have 
the space to detail the connections and the many other complexities of tank 
design and installation here. If you’ll be doing the work yourself, I recommend 
that you get a copy of Water Storage: Tanks, Cisterns, Aquifers, and Ponds, by 
Art Ludwig (Oasis Design).
Recycling Water with 
a Graywater System
A graywater system uses secondhand water from your washing machine, 
sinks, and possibly tubs and showers (never toilets). The water is collected 
with a system of pipes throughout the house and delivered to landscape 
plantings.

133
 Chapter 8: The Nuts and Bolts of Water Harvesting, Irrigation, and Drainage
Graywater isn’t for everybody or every situation. You must have the following:
 
✓ Accessible plumbing
 
✓ A normal soil type
 
✓ Moderate climate (neither too wet nor too cold)
 
✓ An attitude that allows you to put up with a bit of work and tinkering to 
keep your system going (see Chapter 10)
Graywater isn’t legal everywhere, and even in areas where it is, certain sys-
tems can get you in trouble. In some areas, a building permit is required for a 
legal graywater system.
 
You can irrigate fruit trees as well as ornamentals with graywater, but for 
health reasons, don’t use it on vegetables or other edible crops. Even though 
experts claim that there are no documented cases of anyone becoming sick 
from contact with graywater, you shouldn’t ignore potential health risks. 
Because of the potential for problems, graywater can’t be allowed to appear 
on the surface of the ground and can’t be applied through overhead sprinklers 
or garden hoses.
 
Also, when using a graywater system, be careful what you put down the drain. 
Use only natural and graywater-compatible cleaning products. If you wash dia-
pers, send the rinse water into the regular sewer system. And don’t flush meds 
or other potentially harmful substances into the sink and out to your garden.
Choosing a graywater system
You can find many kinds of graywater systems, from a simple pipe or hose that 
empties a sink or the washing machine into a flowerbed to a highly complex 
computerized system that costs thousands of dollars. The consensus seems to 
be that a simpler system is best. The one I describe in this section was devel-
oped by graywater expert Art Ludwig after decades of experimentation. I agree 
with him that it’s the best way to go for many situations.
Figure 7-6 (in Chapter 7) shows you how this system looks. A pipe taps into 
the drain from the bathroom sink and leads out to a mulch-filled basin with 
some useful plants growing in it — no filters, tanks, pumps, valves, control-
lers, or space-age gadgetry involved. The system is incredibly simple to build 
and maintain. You can start with something simple like this and later expand 
into a slightly more complex system, such as the branched drain system. If 
you’d like, you can read more about this complex system in Ludwig’s book, 
Create an Oasis with Greywater (Oasis Design). Visit www.oasisdesign.net 
for details on this book.

134
Par t III: Water, Water, Everywhere: Water-Conserving Irrigation and Drainage 
Building a graywater system
Here’s how to make a simple graywater system (check out Figure 7-6 in 
Chapter 7 for a visual):
 
1. Locate a good source of graywater.
 
 In this case, say it’s a bathroom sink.
 
2. Drill a hole in the wall next to the water source (watch for hidden 
plumbing or electrical wires) and install a drainpipe
 
3. Outside, run the drainpipe to a tree or other plant that’s downhill.
 
4. Dig a hole in the ground and then invert a 5-gallon plastic planting 
container in the bottom of the basin.
 
5. Cut some holes in the container and run the pipe that comes from the 
sink into another hole in the top of the container.
 
 The container acts as a surge tank, leaking water out into the basin.
 
6. Fill the basin with coarse mulch.
 
7. Install a tight-fitting screen on the outlet end of the drainpipe to keep 
critters from crawling into your bathroom.
If one basin won’t handle all the water, you can hook up more of them via a 
more complex branched drain system that distributes the graywater to sev-
eral locations using a system of carefully-leveled pipes. Refer to the earlier 
section “Choosing a graywater system” for more on complex systems.
 
The previous steps are a quickie version of real instructions; I recommend 
that you do your homework before tackling a job like this. I’m not saying that 
a simple system like this is beyond the skills of a handy homeowner. But if you 
get into anything more complex, you need a resource devoted to the subject 
or the help of an expert.
Getting a Bird’s-Eye View of a 
Permanent Irrigation System
You may find, as many people do, that you need to use water from the tap to 
supplement rainfall. That means developing a permanent irrigation system. 
You don’t need to fear the complexities of an irrigation system; it’s just a 
bunch of valves, pipes, sprinkler heads, and drip lines. This section gets you 
up to speed on the parts and pieces and how they fit together (see Figure 8-1 
for an overview).

When shopping for irrigation equipment, buy only the very best available. 
Shop at irrigation supply stores — where the pros shop — not at places that 
sell to homeowners, where merchandise is often inferior. The equipment may 
cost a bit more, but the system will last a lot longer — a very sustainable way 
to go if you must have a permanent system.
Hooking up: Point of connection
The place where you tap into your water main is called the point of connec-
tion. In most cases, you saw the pipe in two and install a tee to connect your 
pressure main.
 
Choose a point of connection that’s as close to the water meter or city water 
main as possible so you get the maximum volume and pressure. Don’t try to 
run a system off a hose bibb (outdoor faucet) that comes out the back wall of 
the house or from a soft-water line.

136
Par t III: Water, Water, Everywhere: Water-Conserving Irrigation and Drainage 
 
Tapping into the water main can be tricky business and is best left to a pro, 
even if you plan to install the rest of the system on your own.
Keeping it clean: Filtration
If your water supply is particularly dirty, grit and junk can end up in the 
system, causing valves to stick and heads to plug up. Check with your water 
purveyor about whether you need a filter at the head of the system. Most 
municipal systems are fairly clean, but well water and small private systems 
are notoriously dirty.
 
Bacterial iron slime (also known as iron bacteria) is present in some water 
sources and can cause real problems with irrigation equipment, particularly 
drip systems. Even though it isn’t toxic to people, bacterial iron slime is dif-
ficult to treat and can’t be filtered out. If you have colored, smelly, or iron-
flavored water, or if you see slimy stuff inside your pipes and fixtures, check 
with your water purveyor to see whether you have this problem.
Delivering the goods: Pressure 
mains and hose bibbs
The pressure main is the underground pipe that supplies water to your con-
trol valves. Unlike lateral pipes that are downstream from the control valves, 
pressure mains are under continuous pressure. Pressure mains should be 
at least ¾ inch in diameter; 1 inch or larger is better, though, because you’re 
going to need a lot of water.
Pressure mains usually are buried at least 18 inches below ground — deeper 
in cold climates. Heavy-walled Schedule 40 PVC is the usual choice for pipe, 
but PVC is an environmental nightmare. Consider a more sustainable alterna-
tive such as cross-linked polyethylene pipe.
Put hose bibbs (those are the faucets you hook your garden hoses up to) near 
control valves and anywhere else you need to have running water.
 
For safety and durability, the riser — the pipe that comes aboveground to 
supply the hose bibb — needs to be metal, not plastic. (This is true of any 
situation in which pipe is exposed.) Stake the hose bibb to a 4-x-4 wooden 
post or attach it firmly to a fixed object, such as your house, so it won’t break 
off when you tug on the hose.

137
 Chapter 8: The Nuts and Bolts of Water Harvesting, Irrigation, and Drainage
Keeping it safe: Backflow 
prevention devices
To prevent contaminated irrigation water from entering the domestic water 
supply, the law in most places requires you to have an approved backflow 
prevention device permanently installed on your system. A backflow preven-
tion device is simply a one-way valve that lets water through but doesn’t let it 
turn around and go the other way.
Some backflow preventers are located at the point of connection (which I 
discuss earlier in this chapter). These devices are called pressure vacuum 
breakers, reduced pressure devices, or double check valves. Other backflow 
preventers are installed at each valve; these devices are called atmospheric 
vacuum breakers. The latter are easier to install than the other kinds, and 
they can be less costly if you have only a few valves.
 
Without getting into all the gory details, I can tell you that each type of back-
flow device offers a particular level of protection, so you need to talk to your 
local building department about what kind to use. In most communities, you 
need a building permit for your backflow device; you may or may not need 
a permit for the rest of the system. You also need to have the device tested 
annually by a certified backflow test technician.
Reducing your pressure: Regulators
A pressure regulator is a simple mechanical device that’s installed on the 
water main to, well, regulate water pressure. If your incoming pressure is 
higher than 80 to 100 pounds per square inch (psi), install a pressure regula-
tor at the point of connection to avoid damaging the system. Excess pressure 
can cause heads to blow off and drip emitters to pop off the tubing. And, of 
course, poor system operation leads to water waste.
Gaining control: Zone valves
A zone is a particular physical area of your landscape, served by its own 
separate zone valve that turns it on and off. Zone valves can be operated 
manually or automatically by a controller that sends 24 volts of electricity to 
the valves via underground wires. Valves are grouped in manifolds (branched 
pipes) in one or more locations throughout the landscape. Manual valves 
are installed aboveground so they can be operated conveniently; automatic 
valves are placed underground in plastic valve boxes.
 
Zones exist for several reasons:

138
Par t III: Water, Water, Everywhere: Water-Conserving Irrigation and Drainage 
 
✓ Water use: You can separate the system (and the plantings themselves) 
into hydrozones that contain plants with similar water needs, each con-
trolled by its own valve. That way, you don’t over- or underwater plants.
 
✓ Exposure: You can provide separate valves for sunny and shady areas, 
windy areas, or areas under trees that may need more or less water.
 
✓ Hydraulics: When any area is too big to be served by one valve because 
of limitations in the water supply, you can break the area into smaller 
parts and have multiple valves come on one after another, in sequence.
Sending water to the sprinklers: 
Lateral pipes
The underground pipes that send water from the valves to the sprinkler 
heads or drip lines are called laterals. As with pressure mains, the conven-
tional pipe choice is PVC, but cross-linked polyethylene is much more sus-
tainable if you can find it. Laterals don’t carry as much pressure as mains, so 
the pipe doesn’t have to be as strong. Laterals can be buried a foot deep.
Applying the water: Sprinkler 
and drip systems
Sprinkler heads and drip emitters are the end of the line for the system; 
they deliver water to your plants. Sprinklers spray water overhead and 
are supplied by a system of underground pipes. Drip emitters apply water 
very slowly, fed by tubing that’s installed between the soil and the mulch. I 
explain both in the following sections. Refer to the later section, “Applying 
Sustainable Watering Concepts to Your Permanent Irrigation System” for 
more on how to sustainably use sprinkler and drip systems.
Sprinkler systems
Even though sprinklers are inefficient compared to drip, they do a good job of 
watering a lawn or meadow or large areas of low ground cover (although a sus-
tainable landscape wouldn’t take this approach in the first place). In these cases, 
do everything you can to make the sprinkler system as efficient as it can be.
Select a type of sprinkler head that’s appropriate for the circumstances. Note 
that heads come in aboveground and pop-up versions. Here are some popu-
lar types of sprinkler heads and how they’re used:
 
✓ Spray heads: Small areas are best served by spray heads, which cover 
up to a 15-foot radius from the head. The spray head has a fixed nozzle 
that delivers a fan-shaped arc of water in a circular pattern.

139
 Chapter 8: The Nuts and Bolts of Water Harvesting, Irrigation, and Drainage
 
✓ Rotor heads: Rotor heads have a gear-drive mechanism that delivers 
water via rotating streams, putting the water down more slowly and 
evenly than spray heads do. The coarse streams are less apt to blow 
around in wind. Rotors are used for larger areas because they shoot 
water over longer distances — a radius of 20 to 40 feet or more.
 
✓ Impact heads: Impact heads use a swinging arm to break a stream of 
water into a wider pattern. This old-fashioned design is quite efficient, 
though rather noisy. (A sustainable garden should be a quiet garden.) 
Impact heads are used the same way as rotor heads.
 
Never mix different types of heads on one valve, because coverage patterns 
and precipitation rates can vary considerably.
Drip systems
A well-designed, properly installed drip system can be one of the most sus-
tainable features of your landscape, saving lots of water and making the 
plants truly thrive. Consider the following:
 
✓ Drip systems apply water via emitters, which are small, precisely 
engineered openings that keep the flow consistent from one emitter to 
the next.
 
✓ Emitters can be installed on or molded right into polyethylene drip 
tubing; the latter arrangement is better because the emitters stay put.
 
✓ Each emitter dribbles out water at a very slow rate — usually ½ to 2 
gallons per hour — and the water soaks straight into the soil without 
being sprayed into the air.
 
✓ Filtration is essential to the longevity of the system, because even tiny 
bits of grit in the water can plug the small openings in the emitters. Wye-
type filters with 150-mesh screens are the best. (Certain types of water 
can clog emitters even with proper filtering, so check with your water 
district to be sure that drip will work with your water.)
 
✓ Drip systems operate at 20 to 30 pounds per square inch (psi) of pres-
sure. Because this pressure is much lower than the incoming pressure 
for most water systems, small pressure regulators especially made for 
drip systems are required at each valve.
 
✓ Elevation changes can affect the accuracy of delivery, resulting in more 
water going to low spots. If you have more than 3 to 5 feet of elevation 
change within the area served by one zone valve, either split the system 
into high and low sections or use pressure-compensating emitters, 
which handle elevation changes better than standard emitters do.
 
✓ Drip tubing usually is installed on the surface of the ground and cov-
ered with mulch, but some types can be buried beneath the soil surface. 
Tubing is fastened to the soil with drip staples, which should be installed 
every 3 feet to prevent the tubing from popping up through the mulch.

140
Par t III: Water, Water, Everywhere: Water-Conserving Irrigation and Drainage 
Timing it right: Irrigation controllers
If you have an automatic system, you can install the controller in the garage 
or another protected but accessible location. You can also place it outdoors 
where your gardener or others can get to it when you’re not home. For 
detailed information on smart versus dumb controllers and on how to choose 
a controller, refer to Chapter 7. I strongly suggest that you consider a smart 
controller; it really works, and it saves a lot of water and money.
 
Installing a rain sensor — a little cup located in an open area that catches 
rain and shuts off the system until the weather dries out — isn’t a bad idea. 
Nothing is sillier or more wasteful than sprinklers coming on in the rain.
Applying Sustainable Watering Concepts 
to Your Permanent Irrigation System
I’ve looked at a lot of irrigation systems in my time, and most of them have 
been subpar in terms of design and performance. That’s a shame, because 
putting together a really good system — one that irrigates instead of irri-
tates — doesn’t take much knowledge. Start with the principles that drive the 
design of a system, which I cover in the upcoming sections.
Sprinkler distribution uniformity
Here’s a paradox: Try getting even coverage by watering a square area with 
circular arcs of water. One look at the geometry of the situation makes it 
clear that sprinkler coverage — or distribution uniformity (DU), as we irriga-
tion pros say — can never be perfect with this kind of setup.
Given the impossible geometry, we allow ourselves to be satisfied with 70 
percent DU, meaning that a fairly large part of the area isn’t getting adequate 
water. To keep those drier areas irrigated properly, you’d have to increase 
watering time to the point that the rest of the area is being overwatered. This 
system isn’t very sustainable, which is why I like drip so much; the DU for it 
is 100 percent for all intents and purposes.
 
To get optimal DU, place your sprinkler heads so that each head shoots over 
to all its neighbors, as you see in Figure 8-2, where the dots represent sprin-
kler heads and the numbers note the number of heads hitting each area of 
the yard. That arrangement is called head-to-head coverage, and it’s essential 
to proper performance of the system. Without it, you get dry spots, wasted 
water, and sickly plants.

Drip on a grid versus drip at the plant
Putting one or two drip emitters at the base of each newly planted plant is no 
way to build a drip system. The crown of a plant, especially a drought-tolerant 
one, is the last place you want water, because water there encourages patho-
gens that could ultimately kill the plant. Also, if you don’t have emitters else-
where throughout the mature root system of the plants, they’ll never get enough 
water (see Figure 9-1 in Chapter 9 to understand where roots really are).
 
The proper way to create a drip system is to make a grid of emitters, using 
tubing with molded-in emitters. Space the emitters a set distance apart (usu-
ally 12 to 24 inches) and install parallel lines of tubing throughout the entire 
planted area, wherever roots may roam (see Figure 8-3). That way, the wetting 
pattern is more like rain — even and consistent.

Par t III: Water, Water, Everywhere: Water-Conserving Irrigation and Drainage 
Including Sustainable Drainage Systems
Water-harvesting systems hold rainwater on the land; drainage systems 
take it away. Sounds kind of crazy, doesn’t it? Well, the traditional drainage 
system, without the earth-friendly water-harvesting element, is pretty crazy. 
Somewhere along the line, rainwater became a waste product in people’s 
minds, and drainage systems went far beyond the admirable task of keeping 
your house from flooding. Instead, they went on to become water-squander-
ing, street-flooding devices that cause more problems than they solve.
The conventional drainage system consists of site grading that runs all 
water to low points away from the house and catch basins that capture it 
and deliver it to the street in underground pipes. When it’s in the street, the 
water contributes to urban flooding and also washes pollution into streams, 
lakes, and other bodies of water. This system is a great way to deal with 
excess water that could do real damage to your property, but it takes all the 
water away before it can do any good.
Nonetheless, most landscapes need a drainage system of some kind to pre-
vent catastrophic or nuisance flooding. So if you’re going to include a drain-
age system, make sure you design one that’s sustainable. I show you how in 
the following sections.
Designing your drainage system
Keeping in mind the dual purposes of drainage in a sustainable landscape (to 
keep water on site as much as is practical and to prevent excess stormwater 
from doing damage), here are the steps in designing a drainage system:
 
1. Find out where the water is coming from.
 
 Survey your site to see where stormwater is coming from. Review the 
section “Follow the water” earlier in this chapter. This time you should 
be looking at rainwater as a potential problem, not a resource, but the 
principles are still the same. Talk to neighbors if you aren’t familiar with 
storm behavior and drainage patterns in your neighborhood.
 
2. Find out where the water is going.
 
 See where the exit points are on your property and note any low spots 
where water backs up. The low spots could be troublesome if they cause 
damage or oversaturate an unstable slope, but they’re welcome if they 
act as ponding zones to keep water on your land. (Refer to “Factoring in 
the right features,” earlier in this chapter, for more information on 
ponding zones.)

143
 Chapter 8: The Nuts and Bolts of Water Harvesting, Irrigation, and Drainage
 
3. Consider locations for water-harvesting strategies.
 
 See Chapter 7 and the first part of this chapter for specific ways to keep 
water on the land.
 
4. Identify any safety problems.
 
 Make sure your property is geologically stable (check with a consulting 
geologist on this). Discharge water onto pavement or stable ground to 
avoid erosion problems. Plan good overflow paths for heavy flows.
 
5. Coordinate your drainage design with the overall landscape plan.
 
 Think about where plants that will use the water will be placed and how 
the drainage patterns will affect patios, paths, lawns, and other areas.
 
6. Try to drain the property without using pipes.
 
 When pipes plug up, the water backs up and you have a flood. If you 
can grade your property so that floodwaters run harmlessly across the 
surface of the ground, you’ll be a lot better off in most cases. When you 
solve the problem with grading, you have no pipes to plug up, and your 
only responsibility is maintaining an adequate cover of vegetation so 
the soil doesn’t wash away. In cold climates, freezing weather can wreak 
havoc on drainage systems by clogging pipes and intakes with ice. In 
such places, surface drainage is almost always preferable.
 
7. Place catch basins at low points and connect them to a suitable dis-
charge location with an underground drainpipe.
 
 Make sure that your low points are at least 10 feet from the house — 
preferably as far out on your property as practical. Plan pipe runs to 
avoid tree roots, and try not to dig trenches straight down slopes, 
because they could wash out in a storm. Set the top rims of all catch 
basins a couple inches higher than the surrounding grade to form shal-
low ponding areas where water can soak in. Make double-sure that the 
rims are well below the floor height of your house and other buildings. 
Where catch basins are located away from traffic areas, use domed 
atrium grates rather than flat-topped ones so that leaves won’t plug 
them up.
 
8. Evaluate your design in the field before you build it.
 
 Unlike surface features of your landscape, grading and drainage are 
final. They’re nearly impossible to change after they’re in. If you have 
the slightest doubt about the wisdom, safety, or legality of what you’re 
doing, have it looked at by a qualified professional.
 
Don’t forget to include French drains behind retaining walls and anywhere 
you have groundwater getting into the house. A French drain is a ditch with a 
perforated drainpipe in the bottom — an upside-down version of the Dutch 
drain I introduce earlier in this chapter. Like the Dutch drain, the French drain 

144
Par t III: Water, Water, Everywhere: Water-Conserving Irrigation and Drainage 
is lined with filter fabric to keep soil out but let water in; it’s filled with coarse 
crushed rock to create a porous zone that attracts water from the surround-
ing area. Water goes down into the pipe and can be sent to a suitable place for 
safe use. (In short, French drains absorb troublesome water and take it away, 
whereas Dutch drains take water from somewhere else and let it soak in.)
Installing and maintaining 
your drainage system
As long as you’re careful to set the grades correctly, the installation of a drain-
age system isn’t complicated — just a lot of hard work. Consider the 
following tasks:
 
✓ The drainpipes need to be buried, which of course means a lot of 
trenching and backfilling.
 
✓ You need to keep the pipes going downhill consistently, at a slope ade-
quate for them to empty thoroughly (at least 1/8 inch of drop per foot of 
pipe). Therefore, you need to check the slope with a level as you go.
 
✓ You must minimize standing water. I like to drill a hole in the bottom 
of catch basins and put a layer of gravel under them to eliminate tiny 
ponds where mosquitoes can breed.
 
✓ You must provide cleanout fittings so you can flush out the system 
before the rainy season.
 
Use rigid, smooth-walled pipe wherever you can; it’s easier to keep clean than 
the corrugated kind.
You have very little to do to keep a drainage system working properly. An 
annual flushing keeps things flowing. Plus be sure to keep the area around 
the catch basins free of litter and leaves to prevent clogging. Check the exit 
point of your pipes every now and then to make sure that the water isn’t 
causing erosion.

t isn’t enough to build a water-conserving irrigation system if you still 
water every day. The other half of the equation is behavior. Savvy water 
management isn’t complicated, and it can save you big bucks while you do 
the sustainable thing for the environment. Keep in mind, too, that water man-
agement isn’t just for folks with a fancy irrigation system; it’s just as impor-
tant for those who water by hand.
Unless you’ve set up a landscape that never needs supplemental watering, 
you have to apply water to make up the difference between what the weather 
brings and what your plants need. To do that efficiently, you need to apply 
a few principles to your irrigation practices, making good decisions about 
when and how much to water.
The first step is to develop a landscape that doesn’t need much water in the 
first place. Then, if appropriate, incorporate water-harvesting strategies so you 
don’t have to buy as much water (see Chapter 8). Next, if you have an irriga-
tion system, design it so that it incorporates as much drip as possible, efficient 
sprinkler heads, and a smart controller. (Chapters 7 and 8 can help with all 
your irrigation needs.) Finally, find out how to be a savvy water manager.

Developing a Water-Wise Landscape
By using plants that are adapted to your particular conditions, covering 
the soil with a protective layer of mulch, and developing water-harvesting 
systems to make use of rainfall, you’ve set the stage for water conservation. 
You’ve also given yourself tools to work with as a water manager.
Picking climate-compatible plants
You can choose to create a sustainable landscape that needs no irrigation 
system and no water management. First, evaluate the native plant communi-
ties in your area (hint: take a hike) and decide whether they meet your prop-
erty’s needs. If they do, you may be on your way to achieving the deepest 
level of sustainability: the no-water native landscape.
Visit a local botanic garden or ask professionals about the feasibility of bring-
ing nature into your garden. If it looks like this plan will work for you, forget 
about installing an irrigation system and get to planting!
 
Your landscape doesn’t have to be strictly native to do well without watering. 
Plants from any region of the world where the climate is similar to yours can 
work. Choose your plants carefully; Chapters 16, 17, and 18 can help.
Thinking long and hard about 
plant placement
After choosing appropriate plants for your climate, you also have to deter-
mine the best places to put those plants. Group your plantings into hydro-
zones — those handy groups of plants with similar water needs. In other 
words, plan your landscape so that higher and lower water-using plants are 
in separate areas and on separate irrigation valves. Don’t mix plants with dif-
ferent water requirements; otherwise you’ll always be overwatering or under-
watering certain plants.
Considering turf and mulch
Lawns use tons of water and create other problems as well. In fact, lawns are 
the most consumptive of all landscaping features. If you can’t eliminate your 
lawn, make it smaller. And if you can’t make it smaller, at least manage water-
ing well. Aerate your lawn and remove thatch once or twice a year to allow 
water to penetrate.

147
 Chapter 9: Managing Water: The Other Half of the Irrigation Equation
 
Don’t forget the water-saving qualities of mulch. A 3- to 4-inch-thick layer of 
organic mulch covering the surface of the soil can reduce water use by 50 per-
cent or more. Mulching has many other advantages as well; see Chapter 16 for 
the lowdown.
Creating a Watering Plan or Schedule
In order to be a savvy water manager, you have to create a watering plan for 
your landscape. The watering plan spells out which plants need watering and 
when. Your watering plan delivers water where it’s needed, without exces-
sive runoff or spray drift, and in adequate quantities for the needs of the 
plants.
This section helps you figure out your landscape’s water requirements; put 
together a watering schedule that meets those requirements; and then tweak 
that schedule based on seasons, soil conditions, and other factors.
Discover the truth about roots
The first task is to understand what you’ll be watering. You may be surprised 
to find that the root systems of plants aren’t where your junior-high science 
teacher said they were. You may remember a lecture about the roots of a 
tree: The teacher may have said that the roots go about as deep into the 
ground as the tree is tall and that they extend out about as far as the tree 
canopy is wide. My teacher drew a dumbbell-shaped tree on the blackboard, 
complete with a tidily symmetrical root system. At the time I was pretty 
impressed, but it turns out she made it all up.
As you see in Figure 9-1, the roots of a tree (and for that matter, the roots of a 
shrub or perennial) extend much farther than the canopy, and they’re mostly 
within the top 18 inches of soil. There are exceptions to this rule, of course; 
some trees actually do the dumbbell thing, and unusual soil or weather con-
ditions can send roots down rather than out. But overall, Figure 9-1 shows 
the way things happen underground.
 
The implications for irrigation (and for many other landscaping practices) are 
significant. If you’ve been deep-soaking your yard, you may have been wast-
ing a lot of water or recharging the groundwater at your own considerable 
expense. If you water only at the base of plants and ignore the soil out in the 
open, you’ve been doing the plants a terrible disservice. Effective watering 
covers the entire root system and goes no deeper than the roots do. That 
means wide, relatively shallow coverage, which can be done with sprinklers, 
drip on a grid, or hand watering.

Figuring out how much water 
your landscape needs
People are nurturers, and because watering feels like nurturing, it’s the part 
of gardening that most people love. But combine love of nurturing with lack 
of knowledge about watering decisions, and you have the ingredients for 
water waste and unhealthy plants.
How much you water depends on the root depth of your plants, the soil type 
you have, and the application rate of whatever delivers your water, whether 
it be sprinklers, drip, or you standing at the business end of a garden hose. 
The frequency and quantity of watering depends on many factors as well; try 
a good watering followed by a waiting period to see when it’s time to water 
again. Then use this result as your base schedule for the season (refer to the 
following section to see how to read plants for signs of water need).
Observing your plants
You don’t have to gather a lot of data and crunch a lot of numbers to see that 
plants need water. Some simple signs in the weather, in the soil, and in the 
plants themselves will tell you most of what you need to know about when to 
water.
 
Watch plants for symptoms of drought stress, such as loss of shine on leaves, 
slowing of growth, and dropping of older (that is, lower) leaves. If you see any 
of these signs, check your soil. If the soil is dry 6 to 12 inches down, water 
the plants, and adjust your controller (or the calendar in your mind) to water 
more often. If plants show stress and the soil is moist, reduce the frequency of 
watering. (Oddly enough, the symptoms of too much water and too little water 
are the same.)

149
 Chapter 9: Managing Water: The Other Half of the Irrigation Equation
Also pay attention to the weather. If it’s windy, hot, or dry, go see whether your 
plants need a drink. In fact, if you’re thirsty, your plants may be thirsty too.
 
Don’t let plants dry out to the point where they wilt. Wilting is hard on them.
Using evapotranspiration to your advantage
Evapotranspiration (also known as ET) is the combination of evaporation of 
water from the soil and the transpiration of water through the leaves of your 
plants. It’s a way of indicating how much water your landscaping is using in 
any given weather situation. Many things affect ET, including temperature, 
humidity, wind, cloud cover, size/age/condition of plants, and time of year.
You can save a lot of water by matching your irrigation to the ET. You can 
access current ET data by calling your water purveyor for a local resource. 
Then you can reprogram your controller to match the watering times to the 
current ET. If the ET for the past week was 1.2 inches, for example, you can 
use the scheduling data you develop in your water audit (refer to the later 
section “Perform a water audit”) to adjust your watering time to replace the 
1.2 inches — no more. I show you how to do this in the next section.
 
If you get a smart controller, of course, you can ignore this section; the con-
troller itself will make the adjustment, using data from local weather stations.
Soil conditions: Precipitation rate versus infiltration rate
Each soil type absorbs water at a particular speed known as the infiltration 
rate. Clay soils, which are made up of tiny, tightly packed particles, are the 
slowest to absorb water. Sandy soils, with their big chunky particles and 
numerous air spaces, drink up water fast. Water goes straight down in sandy 
soil rather than spreading out as it does in a clay soil. Loam soils are in the 
middle. Table 9-1 shows the differences in infiltration rates.
Table 9-1 
Infiltration Rates of Soil Types
Soil Type
Infiltration Rate (Inches per Hour)
Clay
0.2 to 0.4
Loam
0.5 to 1.0
Sandy
1.0 to 2.0
Your irrigation system delivers water to the soil at a particular speed known 
as the precipitation rate. As you may guess, the precipitation rate needs to be 
slower than the infiltration rate of your soil; otherwise, you’ll have runoff.

150
Par t III: Water, Water, Everywhere: Water-Conserving Irrigation and Drainage 
If you use sprinklers, keep these figures in mind:
 
✓ Spray heads apply 1 to 4 inches per hour.
 
✓ Rotor and impact heads deliver 0.2 to 1.0 inches per hour. (These heads 
are better for heavier soils because they apply water much more slowly.)
To prevent runoff, design your system so that its precipitation rate is lower 
than or equal to the infiltration rate of the soil. It isn’t the end of the world if 
you can’t, however; you simply can use your automatic controller to apply 
water in short bursts, with rest periods in between to allow the water to 
soak in. (The precipitation rate of drip systems is low enough that they won’t 
create runoff in even the heaviest soils.)
Paying attention to water holding capacity
Soils also differ in how much water they hold and in how fast they dry out 
(which is referred to as water holding capacity). In sandy soil, you need to 
water every 2 to 7 days, depending on the type of plants you have and the 
weather conditions; in loam soil, the interval is 3 to 11 days; and in clay soil, 
it could be 3 to 15 days.
Performing a water audit
The basic idea of a water audit is to determine whether your irrigation system 
is operating at peak efficiency and to figure out what improvements or 
adjustments you need to make to fine-tune the system. Then you make those 
changes and develop a schedule for operating the system so it keeps the 
plants healthy without wasting any water. You can get help from your local 
water purveyor or perform a water audit yourself.
 
A simple, effective water audit will take you about an hour to complete. The 
audit can be used for a permanent sprinkler system or with a low-tech system 
like a sprinkler at the end of a hose.
 
1. Evaluate landscape water use.
 
 Compare water use (found on your water bill) from a hot period, such as 
August, with one from winter when you aren’t watering at all. The differ-
ence between the two amounts is your approximate landscape water use.
 
2. Evaluate the overall landscape.
 
 See whether you can eliminate turf or high-water-use plants in some 
areas, incorporate water-harvesting features, or cover planter beds with 
mulch. Each of these measures can reduce water use significantly.
 
3. Check the system for leaks, overspray, tilted heads, and missing or 
broken nozzles or drip emitters; then make any necessary repairs.
 
 See Chapter 10 for details on how to accomplish this task.

151
 Chapter 9: Managing Water: The Other Half of the Irrigation Equation
 
4. Do a catch-can test on your sprinkler system.
 
 Set some tuna cans out on your lawn (take the tuna out first). Use about 
eight cans for an average-size lawn, placing some at sprinkler heads and 
some in the spaces between heads. Run the system for exactly 15 min-
utes. Then use a ruler to measure how much water is in each can. If the 
water depth differs by more than 30 percent, change the sprinkler-head 
spacing to improve coverage; double-check your repair work; repeat 
the catch-can test; and measure the depth of water in each can. Add the 
depths, divide by the number of cans to get the average, and then mul-
tiply by 4 to get the precipitation rate in inches per hour. Use this figure 
to develop a watering schedule (see the next section).
 
5. Check your controller (if you have one), and write down the schedule 
for each zone.
 
6. Program a new watering schedule into your controller or modify your 
manual watering schedule to account for what you’ve discovered.
 
7. Next time you get a water bill, compare water use to see how much 
you’ve saved.
Setting the watering schedule
Use your precipitation information and current ET data to develop a watering 
schedule; then use the schedule to reprogram your controller or to water by 
hand. The discussion here assumes you’ll be using a controller, but if you’re 
watering manually then simply write the schedule down and follow it.
 
To truly save water, reprogram your controller at least four times a year, when 
the seasons change. Ideally, you adjust the watering schedule every time a 
significant weather change occurs. Smart controllers make those adjustments 
automatically; you could skip this section and go buy a smart controller. But 
assuming that you have a conventional timer, here’s help for you:
 
1. Find your precipitation rate.
 
 For details, refer to Step 4 of “Performing a water audit,” earlier in this 
chapter.
 
2. Develop a base schedule for your turf areas, which generally use the 
most water of any part of the landscape.
 
3. Program this base schedule into your controller.
 
4. Adjust the program as you observe the actual response of your lawn to 
the irrigation cycle.

152
Par t III: Water, Water, Everywhere: Water-Conserving Irrigation and Drainage 
 
The base schedule accounts for average water use but is only a starting point 
for irrigation management. Your job is to reprogram the controller every time 
the weather changes significantly; wind, temperature, sun or clouds, rainfall, 
and other factors all affect actual water needs. Table 9-2 provides a handy 
chart to work with.

Program the numbers in Table 9-2 into the watering time or station time of 
each lawn valve station on your controller (or water this long by hand). Set 
the days to three per week (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, for example). 
Change the numbers as the seasons change. That’s it.
Note: This information assumes that you program for three watering cycles 
per week, which is ideal for most lawn types. In other words, water for the 
times indicated three times per week. If you water more or less often, set 
your watering times to deliver the total number of inches per week (listed in 
the table column heads) for whatever season you’re in. You may need more 
or less water in your particular climate; check the ET via your local water 
purveyor.
For flowerbeds, ground covers, and other non-turf areas that are irrigated with 
sprinklers, determine whether they need more or less water than your lawns. 
Then you can adjust your base schedule accordingly. Keep an eye on the con-
dition of your plants; dig into your soil periodically to determine actual soil 
moisture, and then make adjustments based on what’s really going on.
 
Some communities have permanent watering restrictions designed to con-
serve water year round; others have restrictions only during certain seasons 

153
 Chapter 9: Managing Water: The Other Half of the Irrigation Equation
or times of drought. Typical restrictions include limiting watering to certain 
hours (usually prohibiting watering during the heat of day) or certain days of 
the week, dictating the kind of watering equipment you can use, and prohibit-
ing watering of turf or high-water-use plants. Check with your local water 
utility for specific information.
Watering Wisely: Some General Tips
Here are some tips for making sure your watering efforts are as effective as 
possible. Stick them on your fridge or hang them in the garden shed.
 
✓ Early morning is the best time to water, because there’s less evaporative 
loss due to heat, less wind, and better water pressure. Morning watering 
also supplies plants with the moisture they need to get through the day. 
Finally, the foliage has a chance to dry out, which reduces the likelihood 
of diseases arising from nighttime wetness.
 
✓ Check soil moisture with a soil probe or trowel before watering.
 
✓ Don’t water when it’s windy.
 
✓ Put a rain sensor on your controller so it doesn’t water in the rain.
 
✓ Don’t hose off your pavement unless the water will run into an area that 
needs to be watered.
 
✓ Look for particular plants that show drought stress first; use them as 
indicators that you need to water the area they’re growing in.
 
✓ Keep weeds down; they use water too.
 
✓ Go easy on the fertilizer. Plants that are growing fast and loose use more 
water than ones that are more sedate.
Community resources for water conservation
Most communities, especially in hot dry cli-
mates, offer a wealth of information on land-
scape water conservation. Check your water 
utility’s Web site, or call to see whether the 
company offers on-site water audits, free 
water conservation tools (such as catch-cans 
for water audits, soil moisture probes, and low-
cost recycled mulch), educational materials, 
classes, or demonstration gardens.

and Irrigation Systems
In This Chapter

▶ Handling special irrigation problems
W
ell-designed and properly built water harvesting and irrigation sys-
tems require little care. But ignoring maintenance tasks can result in 
wasted water and ruined landscaping. You don’t need to make maintenance a 
frequent part of your regimen, but even a perfect system needs attention now 
and then as this chapter explains — nothing too complex. Promise.
Keeping Your Water-Harvesting 
System in Shape
Low maintenance is one of the side benefits of a water harvesting strategy. 
Compared to the work needed to keep a hi-tech irrigation system in good 
condition, there’s little to take care of. However, some parts of this system do 
call for a bit of upkeep. In the following sections, I give you some tips on what 
to do with each particular type of system.
Taking care of nonstorage systems
A nonstorage system consists of earthworks, such as swales, dry streambeds, 
percolation zones, and other naturalistic features. One important mainte-
nance task to take care of for this type of system is checking all the parts 
after (or during) each significant rainstorm to make sure they haven’t col-
lapsed or filled with silt. Ensure that the water is going where it’s supposed 

156
Par t III: Water, Water, Everywhere: Water-Conserving Irrigation and Drainage 
to, and make any repairs immediately by regrading and compacting failed 
areas or by using rocks to stabilize weak points.
 
This task is especially important with new systems, because you may need 
to tweak the contours of the soil so that water flows the way you intended. 
However, even an established system can use adjustment now and then; 
gopher or ground squirrel activity or gradual changes in soil levels due to 
siltation can affect your system. If your swales are planted, keep the plants in 
good condition so they hold the soil together, preventing erosion.
Checking out storage systems
Storage-type water harvesting systems consist of a cistern or tank, along with 
a delivery system for the water. Storing lots of water comes with a responsi-
bility to prevent it from becoming a problem. So check for sediment periodi-
cally, and clean the bottom of the tank as needed. Maintain critter-exclusion 
devices to keep mosquitoes and other vermin from coming to live in the 
system. Keep lids and access ports locked so nobody gets inside and drowns.
Keep in mind that tanks can eventually leak or even fail catastrophically. 
Inspect them at least once a year for leaks, rust spots (metal tanks), cracks 
(ferrocement or masonry tanks), undermining of the tank foundations, or any 
other signs of failure. Be sure to check all components after an earthquake.
Monitoring graywater systems
Simple graywater systems, consisting of pipes that deliver water from the 
source (such as your washing machine) to plants by means of gravity, rarely 
need service as long as they don’t introduce a lot of gunk into the lines (and 
assuming that you have consistent downhill flow into soak zones). The 
system will let you know when it needs to be serviced by backing up into, 
say, your laundry room.
 
By law, you can’t allow graywater to come to the surface of the ground. If it 
does, it may be a sign that you’re delivering too much water for the ground 
to absorb. Or it may mean that excess rainfall is saturating the soil. Consider 
expanding the distribution for added capacity, or at least divert water to the 
regular sewer until things dry out a bit.
Many simple graywater systems drain into mulch-filled underground basins, 
which need to be cleaned out and refilled annually. Systems need occasional 
flushing with clean water, and sometimes you have to backflush the pipes by 
shoving a hose up an outlet to release plugging. No stinky smells should be 
coming from your system; foul odors indicate gunk in the lines or a backup. If 
you suspect a backup, flush the lines.

157
 Chapter 10: Maintaining Water-Harvesting and Irrigation Systems
Keep an eye on the health of plants watered by the system, and irrigate them 
with fresh water now and then if the graywater seems to be adding too much 
crud for them to keep up with. Your plants will let you know if this is the case 
by developing dead tips on the leaves (indicating that salts are building up in 
the soil) or by showing signs of stress or reduced vigor.
 
Even though there are apparently no documented cases of anyone ever having 
become ill from contact with graywater, cleaning a graywater system exposes 
you to bacteria and many potential health risks. Wear protective gear, and 
wash up (in fresh water, please) after you’re done.
Inspecting and Maintaining Your 
Permanent Irrigation System
The following sections help you evaluate the condition of each part of your 
irrigation system — sprinklers, drip, and other related components — and 
make repairs. Spending a pleasant hour with your system two or three times 
during the growing season can make a big difference in its performance, in 
your water bills, in the health of your landscaping, and in the environmental 
benefits that accrue from not wasting water. With the exception of maintain-
ing backflow prevention devices, which should be done by a licensed techni-
cian, none of the servicing is complicated.
Start your inspection by looking for excessively dry or wet areas, poorly per-
forming plants, or other signs of misbehavior. Refer to the related subsection 
of this chapter for detailed service procedures on specific components.
 
Turn off the water when working on any pressurized part of the system (that 
is, any part that’s before the lateral lines and drip tubing). And be careful to 
keep dirt out of objects that you’re working on; dirt only makes things worse.
Backflow prevention devices
The backflow preventer is the one-way valve that keeps your water supply 
safe. Often it’s a single device at the beginning of your system called a pres-
sure vacuum breaker, a reduced pressure device, or a double check valve. If you 
have a centrally located device, the law says it has to be serviced annually by 
a licensed backflow test technician. Call your community’s building depart-
ment for a list of approved companies. If you have atmospheric vacuum 
breakers at each valve, they generally require no service.

158
Par t III: Water, Water, Everywhere: Water-Conserving Irrigation and Drainage 
Pressure regulators
The pressure regulator is located at the head of the system along with the 
backflow prevention device; it’s the gadget that controls the water pressure. 
If your sprinkler heads are generating more mist than spray, or if your heads 
or drip emitters are constantly blowing off, perhaps your regulator has gone 
wonky on you. Regulators usually last for decades, but if the incoming water 
is gritty, you may run into problems. Sometimes age takes its toll, too.
 
Attach a pressure gauge to a hose bib to test the pressure, and adjust the 
regulator if necessary by turning the adjustment screw (which is easy to find, 
because it’s the only adjustable thing on the unit). If the pressure doesn’t 
adjust properly, purchase a rebuild kit from your local plumbing or irrigation 
supply store.
Zone valves
Zone valves are the individual electrically or manually controlled valves that 
operate the sprinklers or drip. You have one valve per zone (the system of 
sprinkler heads or drip lines that are controlled by the valve). Valves are 
located aboveground (manual and some electric valves) or underground in 
valve boxes (electric valves only).
For underground installations, the valve box should be dry inside; if it’s 
flooded, check for leaks. Occasionally, an electric valve sticks open — usually 
due to grit lodging in the solenoid port. Piece of cake to fix. First, turn off the 
water. Then remove the solenoid (the thing with the wires attached to it) and 
gently rinse any grit out of the port located in the valve body. The other thing 
that could cause a valve to stick is a punctured diaphragm (no birth-control 
jokes, please). Remove the top of the valve, inspect the rubber diaphragm for 
holes or tears, and replace it if it’s defective.
Every now and then a solenoid goes bad. You can test for trouble by remov-
ing the solenoid and applying 24 volts from the transformer of your control-
ler (not high voltage at an outlet!) to see whether it clicks on. Replace it if it 
doesn’t. (If electrical stuff makes you nervous, call an irrigation company to 
do this test for you.)
If ground squirrels or gophers have filled the valve box with soil, clean it out. 
While you’re in there, turn the valve on (use the manual bleed control that’s 
on the valve, which is a little lever or screw), and then adjust the flow control 
(usually a cross-shaped handle on top of the valve) so that the sprinklers are 
getting enough water. Flow controls usually are set to wide open, but in some 
cases, you may want to adjust them down to reduce flow over the whole zone.
Another part of the system that sometimes causes problems is the wiring 
that connects the valve solenoid to the controller. The weak points are the 

159
 Chapter 10: Maintaining Water-Harvesting and Irrigation Systems
waterproof connectors that join the control wires coming from the control-
ler (these wires come into the valve box from underground) to the solenoid 
wires. If the connectors fail — or if the connection is made improperly with 
electrical tape, wire nuts, or duct tape — replace with proper connectors.
 
Sometimes underground wiring is damaged due to careless digging or bur-
rowing animals; both can be a serious problem. (You’ll know when you have 
this problem, because one or more valves won’t turn on from the controller.) 
Unless you see suspicious activity aboveground, such as a gopher mound 
or recent digging, finding the problem can be mighty challenging. Instead of 
tearing up the whole yard, call an irrigation company that can locate the fault 
with special electronic equipment.
Controller
Very few things go wrong with modern controllers. The vast majority of 
“broken” controllers are just programmed incorrectly. (The program, by the 
way, consists of the time settings and other information you enter into the 
unit with all those dials and buttons. You did this when you put the control-
ler in, right?) If the system isn’t coming on automatically, the best thing you 
can do is get out the instruction book for the controller and reprogram it. If 
reprogramming doesn’t do the trick, take the unit in to a dealer for repair.
 
Power outages lasting a few hours or more may cause the backup battery to 
run down, in which case you lose the program. The remedy is simple: Replace 
the battery and reenter the program. (You did keep a hard copy of the 
program, didn’t you?)
 
Adjusting the program at least four times a year to account for seasonal changes 
in water demand is one of your most important jobs in the sustainable land-
scape. Refer to the water management information in Chapter 9. (If you have 
a smart controller, you’re off the hook.)
Sometimes a problem looks like a controller malfunction but is actually a short 
in the wiring or is a bad control valve. If at least one valve doesn’t come on, use 
a voltmeter to measure the voltage at the terminal strip inside the controller; 
it should be delivering 24 volts to whatever valve is set to come on. If it is, but 
the valve still isn’t working, measure the voltage at the valve. If the valve is get-
ting power, you’ve got a bad solenoid or a defective valve; if the valve isn’t 
getting power, you likely have bad wiring.
A rain sensor, which is a little cup located on the eaves of the house or at 
some other location that’s exposed to rainfall, turns off the controller tempo-
rarily in the event of rain. Once in a while, a rain sensor can cause an overall 
system malfunction. Disconnect the rain sensor at the terminal strip inside 
the controller; if the system works, the sensor is bad. Some rain sensors can 
get filled with leaves, so clean them out now and then.

160
Par t III: Water, Water, Everywhere: Water-Conserving Irrigation and Drainage 
 
Never hook up a controller to an electrical circuit that also serves a washing 
machine, compressor, or other piece of equipment that has a large power 
draw. Power surges resulting when the equipment starts up can throw the 
delicate electronics of your controller into a permanent snit.
Drip filters and regulators
Each of your drip irrigation zones is equipped with a drip setup located at the 
valve for that zone. The drip setup consists of a small regulator to reduce 
incoming water pressure and a filter that screens junk out of the water so 
that it can’t plug the emitters. Drip regulators don’t need service. However, 
regular cleaning of drip filters is essential, especially if your water is on the 
dirty side. Unscrew the canister using your hands. Carefully remove the car-
tridge, keeping dirt from falling into the open filter body. Wash the cartridge 
at a nearby hose bib, using a toothbrush if necessary to gently remove gunk. 
Rinse the cartridge and canister, reinstall the whole business being careful 
not to overtighten, and turn the valve on and look for leaks.
Drip tubing and emitters
The drip emitters that supply water to your plants are installed on or molded 
into black plastic tubing called drip tubing. The tubing usually sits on top of 
the soil and beneath the mulch. In that position, the tubing is vulnerable to 
physical damage from weeding, foot traffic, and animal activity.
 
To inspect your drip lines and emitters, turn the system on and look for any 
funny business. You may find tiny geysers squirting festively into the air; in 
that case, check to see whether any emitters have come off. If an emitter pops 
off, put a new one in the same hole. Or close off the hole with a goof plug (see 
your dealer for this item) and make a new hole nearby for the replacement 
emitter. If a critter has noshed on the tubing, remove the damaged section and 
patch a new piece in, using two drip couplers that are friction-fitted on, just 
like other fittings on the system. (Be very careful to keep dirt from finding its 
way into the tubing while it’s open and vulnerable.)
Every once in a while, despite adequate filtration, an emitter stops working. A 
dead or dying plant will tell you that you have a clogged emitter. Some emit-
ters can be cleaned if they plug up; others have to be replaced. (The best 
ones are self-cleaning.) If the emitters are mounted on the drip tubing, pull off 
the stopped-up one and install a new one. (Keep a supply of emitters on hand 
for moments like these.) If the emitters are molded into the tubing, you can 
simply make a hole in the tubing next to the dead emitter and install a tubing-
mounted emitter in the hole.

161
 Chapter 10: Maintaining Water-Harvesting and Irrigation Systems
After a few years, the drip tubing will disappear under the soil. You can pull it 
back to the surface or leave it there (especially if you have in-line 
emitters that are approved for burial). As tree roots grow, they sometimes 
put a crimp in the drip tubing; replace the crimped part with a small new sec-
tion of tubing, connecting it to the ends of the old tubing with drip coupler 
fittings. Give it some slack to account for the next few years’ growth.
Sprinkler systems
Choose a sunny day when you need to work on your sprinkler system and don 
your swimsuit and flip-flops because you’re going to get wet. Turn on one valve 
at a time, looking for broken heads or nozzles, tilted heads, misaimed heads, 
overspray, underspray, or otherwise out-of-whack heads. Use the adjuster 
screws on top of the heads to fine-tune the distance of throw.
 
Rotor heads sometimes have nonintuitive ways of adjusting the arc; refer to 
the manufacturer’s catalog for instructions. Set all heads so the bodies are 
straight up; they depend on being plumb to deliver an accurate pattern.
You can unthread and remove the nozzles for cleaning or replacement. While 
you’re in there, remove and clean the strainer basket that’s usually located 
underneath the nozzle. If water leaks out of the head while it’s in operation 
(other than where it’s supposed to, that is), you may need to clean or replace 
the seal in the threaded cap that holds the head together. If water constantly 
leaks out of the lowest head in the zone, check for a leaky control valve; if 
that’s okay, you probably just have water draining out of the pipes for a while 
after the zone shuts off. To remedy, install a check valve on that head.
Winterizing your irrigation system
Ever notice that the ice cubes are bigger than 
the amount of water you put in the trays? It’s not 
your imagination. Unlike most materials, water 
expands when it’s frozen. It does that in your 
irrigation system too. So if you live where win-
ters are cold, you need to drain the water out 
of the system at the end of the season to avoid 
damaging pipes and other equipment.
All the pipes in a good cold-weather system 
slope to drain valves located at low points, 
making it easy to open the valves and empty the 
lines quickly — that is, unless it’s already start-
ing to freeze. If your system doesn’t have drain 
valves, use a compressor to blow the water out 
of the lines. Either way, make sure that the lines 
are completely empty before freezing weather 
comes along. After you’ve removed all the water 
from the lines, turn off the main valve at the 
beginning of the entire system, and then set your 
automatic controller to the rain-off position.

162
Par t III: Water, Water, Everywhere: Water-Conserving Irrigation and Drainage 
 
When plants grow up, they can block sprinkler heads, leaving dry spots on the 
lee side of the plant. In fact, sprinklers work best when plants aren’t around. 
Don’t remove them, though; just cut back the offending foliage.
When you’re done checking your sprinkler system, use catch-cans to do a 
water audit to ensure that you got things right. Chapter 9 shows you how.
Coping with Special Irrigation Situations
Most people have fairly simple systems that are served by municipal water. 
But sustainability often takes us in odd directions. In the following sections, I 
provide some tips on managing special circumstances and equipment.
Caring for wells and treatment systems
If your water comes from a private well, you probably have a well expert to 
care for all the problems that come up. Similarly, you should contact a knowl-
edgeable professional to treat problem water; he or she will have special 
equipment for this job.
Treating special water problems
Bacterial iron slime is an organism that inhabits some water supplies. It grows 
inside pipes, valves, sprinklers, drip emitters, and other parts of the system. 
If your pipes have greenish-brown slippery stuff inside them, chances are 
you’ve been slimed. Treatment isn’t easy or practical. The best thing to do is 
to stick with sprinklers, avoiding drip systems and mini-sprinklers, which can 
easily become plugged.
Hard water can affect irrigation equipment, but not as often as you may think. 
Because the insides of the equipment don’t dry out very often, the minerals 
that are present in hard water stay in solution and ride on through. Still, if 
water is hard enough, you may find yourself replacing equipment regularly. 
Treatment of the water usually isn’t practical for irrigation because of the 
volume of water used.
Dirty water can make a mess of the best systems. Installing a prefilter at the 
point of connection can help; talk to your supplier about options. Clean the 
filter regularly, and be sure to choose contamination-resistant valves (also 
called dirty water valves) that are better suited to passing lots of gunk.

Hardscaping Made 
Easy: Creating 
Awesome Features 
without Wrecking the 
Environment

In this part . . .
H
ardscaping is a fancy landscape architect’s term for 
the nonliving elements of the landscape: patios, 
decks, retaining walls, walkways, and so on. One thing 
that makes a landscape sustainable is an emphasis on liv-
ing systems, but every property needs some hardscape.
Just as the title suggests, in this part I show you how to 
create great hardscape features without messing up the 
environment. I cover paving, fences and walls, retaining 
structures, woodwork such as arbors and decks, and even 
fun stuff like water features and art. What’s more, I show 
you how to assemble all these elements into beautiful, 
functional outdoor rooms that will serve your family’s 
needs for decades to come. I also discuss how to prepare 
your site, and how to maintain the finished product.

f you’ve taken the time to design a truly sustainable landscape (see the 
chapters in Part II), you probably thought you’d never get around to 
actually building it. Well, it’s time to get dirty and build up calluses on those 
hands — or to hire a professional to do the whole job. Either way, the 
goal now is making sure that you know what to do at each stage of the site 
prep part of your project. Even if you’ll be hiring someone to ready your 
site, knowing how things work will make you a more informed consumer of 
services and keep you out of trouble. Okay, slip on those boots. Here we go.
Safety First and Nobody Gets Hurt
 
Landscape construction is heavy work involving tools and equipment 
that are often much bigger, harder, sharper, and more powerful than you. 
Because you’ll be doing your landscaping sustainably, you won’t be using 
toxic chemicals, so that problem’s out of the way. But you have to deal 
with numerous other considerations to stay in one piece and to keep your 
family and others safe:
 
✓ Keep the place clean. Make sure that all pathways, all work areas, and 
the site in general are tidy at all times. Don’t leave materials stacked 
precariously, sharp tools left in harm’s way, or open trenches unmarked. 
Keep in mind that kids and possibly the public may find their way onto 
your property during construction. Make daily inspections.

166
Part IV: Hardscaping Made Easy 
 
✓ Wear proper clothing and safety gear. Heavy boots (no flip-flops or 
tennies), sturdy clothing, gloves, safety goggles, a back brace for lifting, 
and a dust mask — all these items are essential to keeping you safe.
 
✓ Lift with your legs, not your back. In other words, squat (keeping your 
back straight) to lift instead of bending over. And don’t be macho; get 
help with heavy stuff.
 
✓ Know how to use your tools. Read instruction manuals that come with 
the equipment you’re using. And get a lesson on operating any heavy 
equipment you rent.
 
✓ Keep tools and equipment in good condition. Make sure that safety 
guards are in place. Watch for frayed power cords, loose blades, and 
dull cutting tools (sharp ones are actually safer).
 
✓Use a GFCI. That’s a ground fault circuit interrupter — a safety device for 
electrical equipment that cuts off power before it can hurt you in the 
event of a short circuit.
 
✓ Never refuel gas-powered equipment while it’s running or hot. Also, 
be sure to store fuel in approved containers in a safe location.
 
✓ Stay out of wet concrete. Contact with skin can cause cement poisoning. 
So be sure to wear rubber boots and gloves when working with concrete.
 
✓ Stay out of trees, too. Leave tree climbing to experts and squirrels. It’s a 
long way down.
 
✓ If you’re working around dry grasses and weeds, keep a fire extin-
guisher on hand. Avoid using steel tools that can spark against rocks.
 
✓ Keep a first-aid kit handy at all times. Know emergency contact num-
bers, and let family members know if you’ll be doing something risky.
 
✓ Keep kids and pets out of the way. They don’t understand the dangers.
 
✓ Watch your contractors. Not all contractors provide safety training for 
their workers. Keep an eye on them.
 
✓ Do only what you’re comfortable with. It’s always better to hire a 
professional than to get hurt.
Locating Utilities before You Dig
Utilities come into your property underground as well as overhead. Before 
you start digging, you need to determine the exact locations of gas and 
water mains, power lines, telephone and television cables, sewer pipes, and 
any other utilities serving the site. You also may have utility easements 
(legal access to the use of your property by others, often utility companies) 
running through your property. You may have transmission lines or pipes 
within those easements.

167
 Chapter 11: Preparing Your Site
 
You must locate utilities on your property before you work, because finding 
them accidentally could get you injured or even killed. What’s more, it would 
cost you (or your next of kin) a lot to fix damaged utilities — and to pay the 
fines for not following the law that says you have to find your utilities with 
something other than a backhoe or pickaxe. Lots of nice folks have blown 
themselves up hitting gas lines, fried themselves poking into underground 
electric wires, disrupted phone service to whole neighborhoods, and had 
other highly humbling misadventures. Don’t be one of them.
 
After you have everything flagged and marked on the ground, take a little time 
to draw a map of your property showing the exact locations of everything, 
because it’s only a matter of time before the markings disappear during 
construction.
Calling your state’s locating service
Be sure to arrange for utility location at least a few days before you start 
digging. Call 811 to arrange for the service; this number serves the entire U.S. 
(Visit www.call811.com for more details.) After you call 811, your local 
One Call Center will contact all the utility providers serving your property 
and arrange for them to come out and flag everything. You’ll have to mark 
the area first so they know where to look for utilities; the 811 operators will 
explain how to do this when you make the call. Within a couple of days after 
calling 811, all your utilities should be identified, and you then can dig with 
confidence. One Call service is free — and required by law.
Tracking down private utilities
You may have to locate where the utilities, such as water and gas lines and 
other underground lines, run inside your property, as the One Call service 
usually covers only up to the property lines. Many companies have cool 
equipment to do this job for a relatively modest fee, and they save you the 
trouble of digging the yard up looking for things.
Getting Down and Dirty with Demolition
The landscaper’s first task is to make a wreck of the place — in other words, 
demolish it. This part can be a lot of fun, and the clean slate that you end 
up with can be invigorating. Often, demolition is completed with heavy equip-
ment, such as a tractor. If your project is large, that’s the way to go, but for 
smaller jobs consider giving the environment a break by using hand tools as 
much as possible.

168
Part IV: Hardscaping Made Easy 
Practicing sustainable disposal
The old-school approach to demolition was to push the old yard into a 
trash bin and send it away to the landfill. Now we realize that nothing 
ever really goes “away” and that everything we dispose of causes problems 
somewhere else.
Instead of treating the unwanted parts of your existing landscaping as waste, 
see whether anything could be useful in constructing your new landscaping: 
soil, trees, broken concrete, bricks from your old patio, useful plants, or artsy 
junk. Set these reusable castoffs aside for later use.
Also be sure to recycle where appropriate. For example, send green waste to 
the local composting operation instead of mixing it with other materials in a 
trash bin (call your local trash hauler or municipal solid waste department 
to find out about the options that are available in your area). Separate 
recyclable metals, concrete, and soil, all of which may be of value to others 
even if you can’t use them. Craigslist, Freecycle.com, and the local classifieds 
and bulletin boards are ways to find homes for these useful castoffs.
Protecting existing land and vegetation
 
Keep nature safe as you demolish your existing landscape. One way to do that 
is to mark off the drip line (the outermost extent of the tree’s foliage) of your 
existing trees with a ring of flags or better yet with temporary fencing. This 
marked line alerts workers about the importance of not grading or compacting 
the soil with vehicles, equipment, or foot traffic during construction. Also 
avoid placing building materials under trees.
Similarly, get your big trees in shape before you do any landscaping. The 
project will be easier and cheaper if the tree-care workers don’t have to 
pussyfoot through new plantings. You can do tree work any time in the early 
stages of the project.
 
Choose your tree-care company carefully. A hundred years of growth can be 
destroyed in minutes by improper care.
Also, protect against erosion by installing straw wattles or silt fencing (see 
Chapter 14 for information on these and other erosion control strategies) at 
the base of piles of soil that rain could wash away (a precaution that’s 
required by federal law). Avoid working in wildlife habitat or nesting sites. 
And keep soil out of waterways.

169
 Chapter 11: Preparing Your Site
Making the Grade: Doing Your Earthwork
One of the most important elements of your sustainable landscape is the 
underlying earth. How you grade your property determines how long water 
remains on the land; how it travels across the surface; and whether it soaks 
usefully into the ground or runs off to cause erosion, flooding, and pollution. 
Grading keeps your house safe from flooding, creates usable areas, and 
sculpts dull terrain into elegant sensual forms.
 
You grade your land only once — and you have to do it properly, because you 
can’t change it after the plants are in. For that reason, understanding how 
grading works is important. I walk you through the details of grading and 
drainage in Chapter 8. And see how to create grading and drainage plans in 
Chapter 6.
Grading the ground sustainably
The sustainable approach to grading is to do as little as possible (because 
soil is damaged by moving it around) and to have specific reasons to grade, 
such as conserving water on site, preventing erosion, or keeping the house 
from flooding. Here are some basic grading principles:
 
✓ Check all existing grades with a sighting level or have the area surveyed; 
then plan a grading strategy to accomplish your objectives.
 
✓ Talk to a geologist if you have any potentially unstable areas. Never use 
terracing or water-harvesting strategies on unstable slopes. (You can 
find information on terracing and water harvesting in Chapter 8.)
 
✓ Evaluate the site for desirable features, such as trees or native ecosys-
tems, and grade to protect those features. Fence off protected areas.
 
✓ Follow or restore the natural landform where possible, or use the infor-
mation in Chapter 7 to develop a water-harvesting strategy for your 
land. Water harvesting modifies the terrain so it soaks up water.
 
✓ Avoid rototilling, which destroys soil structure. Similarly, avoid com-
pacting the soil with heavy equipment if grading by hand is feasible. 
And never work soil when it’s wet, because you can severely damage it. 
Instead, wait until dry weather.
 
✓ Never add sand to clay soils unless you’re planning to build walls with 
the resulting glop.
 
✓ Talk to an arborist before grading around mature trees.

170
Part IV: Hardscaping Made Easy 
 
✓ Don’t add amendments except in special circumstances. Do add small 
amounts of living compost and mycorrhizal fungi to planted areas at 
planting time, not during grading. (See Chapter 16 for more information 
on soil preparation.)
 
✓ For major grade changes, remove the topsoil, regrade the subsoil, and 
then replace the topsoil. This practice will make a big difference in plant 
growth.
Importing and exporting soil
Sometimes, you can’t avoid moving soil off your site. If that’s the case for 
you, try to find a good home for it. Make sure it will be used to repair a 
damaged site rather than create new problems. And if you need to import 
soil, ask about its source — perhaps even requesting a complete soil test 
as a condition of purchase. (You probably won’t get far with this tactic, but 
it’s worth a try.)
 
Having said all that, do avoid bringing soil in or taking it away, if you can. 
Both practices can disrupt off-site locations and involve the usual pollution 
and fossil-fuel dependency of trucks and heavy equipment. In addition, when 
you import topsoil, you run the risk of also importing new kinds of weeds, 
diseases, and even toxic substances.
 
When an area needs to be leveled, try to balance cut and fill to avoid importing 
or exporting soil. In other words, remove soil in one area and use it to fill 
another so it comes out even. You can do this when creating a level pad for a 
patio, for example. Be careful not to undermine unstable slopes, expose or 
smother tree roots, unbury utility lines, or change natural drainage patterns.
Outsmarting the Weeds on Your 
Site the Organic Way
Pretty much every site has weeds. Weeds are difficult to control because 
they evolved to be aggressive, sneaky, virile, and just plain annoying. If you 
don’t get the weeds under control before you install your landscaping, 
they’ll come right through and make a mess of your lovely work. Annual 
weeds will come back from seed, and perennial weeds will poke up from old 
root systems.

171
 Chapter 11: Preparing Your Site
The easiest and best way to tackle a weed problem is to get ’em during the 
site prep stage. Beating weeds early saves time and effort; you won’t have to 
fight them after your landscaping is in place. Just remember that herbicides 
damage the environment, so you want to practice sustainable weed control 
instead. I explain everything you need to know in the following sections.
Understanding why you 
should avoid herbicides
I won’t mention any names, but certain herbicides have been applied to our 
poor, suffering planet for decades now, yet there seem to be just as many 
weeds as ever. Seems like we’re losing the battle despite all the poisons — 
just another example of how conventional methods really don’t work.
 
Commonly used herbicides have significant effects on the environment, such 
as toxicity to wildlife, especially amphibians and fish. Toxicity to humans is 
also a considerable problem; instances of acute and chronic health problems 
are numerous and well documented. Finally, some weeds are developing 
resistance to herbicides, becoming superweeds that nothing can control. 
Because good alternatives are available, you have little or no reason to use 
herbicides any longer.
Practicing sustainable weed control
Facing a weed-infested site can be intimidating, especially if you’ve chosen 
to forego the herbicides. It’s tempting to bend your ethics just this one 
little time. After all, who wants to spend all summer hoeing and pulling? 
Fortunately, smart sustainable gardeners have come up with some safe 
alternatives that don’t break your back (or hurt the environment).
Use horticultural vinegar
Horticultural vinegar is a keen way to kill weeds without nasty chemicals. 
It doesn’t kill every weed in the book, but it’s pretty effective on many, 
especially the young ones.
 
Horticultural vinegar is stronger than ordinary vinegar, so treat it with care 
(as you would any other strong acid). Weeds sprayed with this substance 
often die within a couple of hours. Your yard will smell like a salad for a bit; 
otherwise, the vinegar is environmentally benign. Some nurseries carry 
horticultural vinegar, and a few of the mail-order garden supply places also 
offer it.

172
Part IV: Hardscaping Made Easy 
As of this writing there’s some controversy over horticultural vinegar’s regis-
tration with the EPA as an herbicide; hopefully this issue will be resolved by 
the time you read this book.
Smother weeds with sheet mulching
Sheet mulching is the practice of killing weeds by smothering them. Hoe out 
any surface weeds, cover the soil with two or three layers of corrugated 
cardboard salvaged from the waste stream (buy it from recyclers or gather it 
up from dumpsters behind stores). Overlap the cardboard and wet it down 
thoroughly, and then cover the whole funny-looking mess with at least 4 
inches of organic mulch (wood chips, for example). Leave everything in place 
for a few months, if you can. Sheet mulching has proved to be more effective 
than herbicides, which can also take months to kill weeds fully. See Chapter 
16 for an illustration of sheet mulching.
Rent a goat or try some other weed control methods
In some progressive communities you can rent a goat or a whole herd to 
gobble up your weeds while you sit on the porch sipping lemonade and 
watching the show. This method may sound crazy if you live in the suburbs, 
but animals have been eating weeds for millennia. If you’re out in the 
country, getting a goat (or for that matter some sheep, horses, or cattle) 
should be even easier. A bonus is that they fertilize at the same time.
Other weed control methods include burning weeds (please talk to the fire 
department first!) or killing them with special steam or heating tools (search 
for “flame weeders” with your favorite online search engine). And yes, there’s 
always chopping and hoeing.

E
very garden needs basic hardscape features: places to sit and entertain, 
and safe steps, paths, and enclosures. However, conventional hardscape 
can be entropic, high maintenance, and troublesome. It’s made up of 
materials that are taken from the planet and that can be toxic, nonrenewable, 
high in embodied energy, and transported from far away by means of 
climate-wrecking fossil fuels. Their operation and upkeep can require toxic 
finishing substances and energy-intensive processes.
Sustainable hardscape, on the other hand, emphasizes plants and biological 
elements over industrial elements made of concrete, steel, plastic, and other 
manmade materials. Even hardscape at its most sustainable is a “less-bad” 
solution to the problem of environmental impact. For that reason, you should 
try to use the least amount of hardscape that serves your needs. The good 
news is that many alternative materials and methods minimize negative 
effects; you can use them to create some truly beautiful and useful additions 
to your project.
This chapter covers some popular hardscape options that can add both 
visual appeal and function to the landscape. With the right approach 
and materials, you can have great hardscape features without all the environ-
mental problems.

174
Part IV: Hardscaping Made Easy 
Getting Floored: Surveying 
the Many Flooring Options
Landscapers design gardens in terms of the base plane, or floor. Think about 
it: A landscape plan is a diagram of how the floor is arranged. Laying out 
the floor — whether it’s a patio, deck, or other surface — is a great starting 
point for developing your overall hardscape. In the following sections, I lay 
down the foundations of good floor design and show you some creative, 
sustainable options. (Check out Chapter 14 for tips on constructing floors of 
all kinds.)
Floors should be beautiful; ugliness isn’t a requirement of sustainability. 
You’ll have no trouble finding something that complements your landscap-
ing, is compatible with the architecture of your house, and is easy on the 
environment.
Floors 101: The basics
Unlike the other elements of the hardscape system, floors need to withstand 
traffic. You have a wide range of serviceable materials to choose from (many 
of which won’t lay waste to the planet).
From a sustainability point of view, many flooring materials have unaccept-
able negative effects. The off-site impacts of getting the materials in the first 
place can be extreme: strip mining, clear-cutting forests, dredging riverbeds, 
or drilling for oil. The processes used to turn raw materials into finished 
products can be energy-intensive, toxic, climate-changing, and hazardous to 
workers. Installation can involve heavy equipment, fossil-fuel use, and lots 
of noise. Surfaces that require periodic maintenance can make unreasonable 
demands for chemicals and energy.
 
You’ll also find some sustainable imposters — materials that have question-
able or fraudulent environmental credentials. These materials include 
plastic lumber, phony plastic lawns, and mulch made from ground-up tires. 
Plastic lumber isn’t all bad, but the phony lawns and mulch are environmental 
nightmares.
 
Stick with materials that are as close to a state of nature as possible and that 
require minimal processing and maintenance. And, build things so they last; 
durability is a supremely sustainable strategy, because it divides the initial 
inputs over many decades of use.

175
 Chapter 12: Exploring Basic Hardscape Elements and Outdoor Rooms
Because rainfall runs off of solid paving, it can be an unfriendly part of the 
watershed, causing flooding and stream pollution when the water spills into 
the street and carries contaminants into waterways. Choosing pervious 
surfaces is one way to deal with that concern, but you can also purposely 
choose impervious surfaces to act as water catchment zones that spill their 
captured water into bioswales, planted areas, or other spots where it will be 
put to use. (See the later section “Using safe, sustainable materials” for more 
information on pervious materials, and refer to Chapter 8 for details on water 
harvesting.)
Using safe, sustainable materials
The following sections show some flooring surfaces that your enviro-side can 
feel good about. None of these is perfect, but each gives you a floor with less 
negative impact.
Poured concrete
The poured concrete patio is the classic solution for flat surfaces outdoors. 
Concrete can be colored, textured, imprinted, seeded with pebbles, and 
generally dolled up in many ways. Use concrete where you want a relatively 
inexpensive and very durable surface. But keep in mind all that strip mining 
and carbon dioxide production, and consider alternatives before you make 
the knee-jerk choice of concrete.
Concrete versus cement
There’s a difference between concrete and 
cement. Even professionals don’t always under-
stand this, so if you do, you’ll be among the 
initiates into the Mysteries of the Cementitious 
Realm. Here’s the scoop:
 ✓ Concrete is a mixture of aggregate (crushed 
rock), sand, portland cement, and water.
 ✓ Cement is one of the ingredients of con-
crete. One adds cement to aggregate, sand, 
and water to make concrete for a patio. 
However, one does not make a cement 
patio (or, for fans of The Beverly Hillbillies, 
a ceeement pond). Now you know.
The manufacturing of cement for concrete pro-
duction is incredibly energy-intensive, and it 
generates 5 to 10 percent of the world’s 
carbon dioxide emissions, but improvements in 
the processes used are lowering that figure 
dramatically. New technologies such as 
nano-concrete (made with a special kind of 
cement that has a much lower environmental 
impact) are very promising. And believe it or 
not, a new type of photocatalytic concrete 
(using a technology called TX Active) actually 
absorbs air pollution.

176
Part IV: Hardscaping Made Easy 
 
Fly ash (a waste product of coal-burning power plants) makes concrete 
stronger and it looks and acts like regular concrete. Not only does it use a 
waste product, it also reduces carbon dioxide production.
Paver blocks
Paver blocks aren’t permeable, but specially-designed ones leave openings 
that absorb rainfall at the rate of about 1 inch per hour. Because they 
can be reused, pavers are the quintessential heritage material. (Refer to 
Chapter 2 for more on heritage materials.) Pavers are ideal for driveways, 
paths, and patios.
Pervious concrete
Pervious concrete is regular concrete without the sand — just crushed rock, 
portland cement, and water. It comes out looking like a giant rice cake. The 
voids between the bits of rock slurp up water at a rate of up to 350 inches per 
hour, which — take it from me — is beyond biblical.
Pervious concrete can take plenty of weight, so it’s great for driveways, and 
other heavy-traffic surfaces. It can be colored, and the top can be ground for 
a smoother, more attractive surface.

Urbanite
This newly discovered “mineral” is nothing more than old, broken concrete 
paving, used like flagstones to make what the British call crazy paving.
 
Urbanite is the ultimate waste-stream material, with no environmental 
impact other than transport. It can be stained or used as is, and it makes a 
lovely surface. Urbanite is available nearly everywhere; look for demolition 
projects in your neighborhood or call contractors to find out who’s planning 
to generate some waste concrete.
Living ground cover
Making a living floor is a biological solution. Living ground covers include 
low-growing plants like thyme, chamomile, and yarrow as well as a conven-
tional lawn. Unmowed, these plants make a gorgeous natural meadow; 
mowed, they form turf that you can walk and play on. Nearly all ground 
covers require some watering and fertilizing, but most are less needy 
than turf.
Plants won’t take the kind of abuse that a harder surface will, and they can 
be troublesome to walk on when wet. Reserve them for low-traffic and 
play areas.

Wood decking
Wood decking is a renewable natural material, and its embodied energy is 
fairly low. Be sure that the wood you use is certified as sustainably harvested 
by the Forest Stewardship Council in the United States (www.fscus.org) or 
the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC) globally 
(www.pefc.org).
Plastic lumber
Plastic lumber is a decking material that’s made from soda containers, 
grocery bags, and wood waste. It looks more or less like wood. Plastic wood 
can smell on hot days (and it can be hot underfoot if the wood is dark).
Alternative woods
You may be able to find local, sustainably produced wood for your deck. 
For instance, black locust is a weedy tree that can be harvested and milled 
into durable lumber that’s a nontoxic substitute for pressure-treated 
wood. Local sawyers (people who turn trees into boards) can generate the 
lumber. Black locust is a very hard wood and can be challenging, but by no 
means impossible, to work with. Reclaimed and salvaged lumber is another 
possibility.
Mulch
Mulch has to be the daddy of all sustainable surfaces — so natural that it 
could have come from your own backyard (and if you got the chips from 
tree trimming, perhaps it did). It’s biodegradable, low in embodied energy, 
beneficial for the soil and plants, attractive to look at, fragrant, pervious to 
water, and good at keeping the weeds down and the roots of your plants 
happy. Mulch is a great surface for informal areas, and it’s cheap as anything 
you can imagine. It’s simple to install, too: just dump it and rake it around.
 
Mulch isn’t the best for putting chairs on, as the legs can sink into moist soil, 
and it isn’t so great for handicapped access. Also remember that because it 
slowly decomposes, adding valuable organic matter and nutrients to your soil, 
mulch gets thinner over time. So you have to top it off with a new layer every 
couple of years.
Gravel or crushed rock
Taken from riverbeds or quarries, gravel or crushed rock carries an environ-
mental price. Plus rock-covered surfaces attract weeds that can be difficult to 
control. Use these surfaces sparingly, where their simplicity, perviousness, 
and nice crunchy sound underfoot are welcome.

178
Part IV: Hardscaping Made Easy 
Considering maintenance
Paved surfaces require little maintenance unless you make the mistake of 
painting them. Don’t waste your money on sealers and stains, which often 
contain toxic and air polluting ingredients. Instead, leave surfaces to age 
naturally and gracefully. If you must use a finish, choose nontoxic, low 
VOC materials (VOCs are air-polluting chemicals that evaporate from many 
finishes as they cure).
Ground covers require weeding, watering, and other normal plant care. 
Choose species that are adapted to your area, and research their needs 
before making your decision.
Concrete patios just need a sweeping every now and then. Wood decks can 
be a little more demanding; they need periodic power-washing, sanding, and 
refinishing. Plastic lumber decks just need power washing.
Choosing between a patio and a deck
If you have a steep slope, consider a deck. If you have more or less level, 
stable ground, stick with a patio. A patio made of nearly anything is cheaper 
and easier to build and more durable than a deck. The rub comes when you 
have a hillside that has to be leveled and stabilized before it can support the 
weight of a patio, which can mean a very costly retaining wall system and still 
more environmental impact. In this situation, a deck starts to look good.
 
If you live in a high fire hazard area, check with local authorities about special 
regulations for decks, which can be fire magnets if they aren’t built properly. 
(For more on firescaping your yard, check out the appendix.)
Dividing Space Using Walls, 
Fences, and Other Barriers
The vertical plane, or walls, in your landscape can be made of plants or 
manufactured materials. A wall may be connected to a floor and a ceiling of 
some sort to create an outdoor room, which I discuss in “Using Sustainable 
Hardscape Features to Build an Outdoor Room,” later in this chapter. Walls 
don’t have to be restricted to the outer boundaries of your property. Use 
interior walls to create outdoor rooms and break the space into interesting 
subspaces.

179
 Chapter 12: Exploring Basic Hardscape Elements and Outdoor Rooms
Use walls or fences to block views of neighbors or to create an enclosed 
courtyard or walled garden. For complete privacy, make your enclosure solid 
and at least 6 feet high.
 
Solid enclosures change the microclimate. They create shade on one side and 
sun on the other, block or channel winds, and sometimes absorb or reflect 
heat. When handled properly, these characteristics can be desirable, but 
if you aren’t aware of the changes you’ll be creating, you could end up with 
trouble.
Keeping people and animals in or out of your property requires sturdy 
barriers. The most sustainable of these barriers are thorny or otherwise 
impenetrable shrubs. However, small or determined interlopers can still 
make their way through these barriers. For complete security, choose 
a solid masonry or adobe wall, or consider chain-link fencing made of 
recyclable steel. This section introduces the types of walls and fences that 
you can incorporate into your hardscape. Chapter 14 provides some 
pointers on building sustainable walls.
Free-standing walls
Free-standing walls enclose space to create privacy, make an area secure, or 
improve the microclimate. For minimal environmental impact, build an earth 
wall. Earth (aka soil) can be shaped into adobe blocks that are then stacked 
to form a wall, tamped between temporary wooden forms to make rammed 
earth, or simply plopped into a free-form wall of cob (fancy language for 
blobs of mud and straw). For a higher-tech and more formal-looking wall, 
look into new soil-cement blocks that are coming onto the market. They’re 
made from natural materials, have a high recycled content, and require 
much less energy to manufacture than the conventional concrete blocks 
they replace. And don’t forget the usefulness of living hedges and vines in 
creating privacy.
Of course, you can use more traditional materials such as wood, metal, or 
masonry (brick, stone, concrete block, or plaster) to build a wall. Masonry 
walls are durable and handsome, but they’re also more expensive and often 
higher in environmental impacts than the other types. A traditional masonry 
wall, made almost entirely of cement-like materials has all the drawbacks 
inherent to that material: strip mining, carbon dioxide production, and 
embodied energy. If you decide to build a wall with one of these materials, 
build it so it will last for decades — maybe even centuries. Spread the 
inputs over the lifespan, and you’ll have a very sustainable structure. Using 
high-volume fly ash concrete for the footings will help as well.

180
Part IV: Hardscaping Made Easy 
Retaining walls
Retaining walls hold back slopes and can be used to increase the usable 
space on your property. Retaining walls 2 feet or less in height are easy and 
usually safe to build, but because taller retaining walls support impressive 
loads, they need to be treated as structural elements as well as visual and 
functional ones and are more complicated to install.
Sustainable materials for short retaining walls include dry-stacked urbanite, 
rubble, or stones from your site or a nearby site. The newer mortarless 
individual stacking block systems, called segmental retaining walls (see 
Figure 12-1), are made from concrete but can be reused, making them good 
heritage materials. Adobe can be used for very low walls with little pressure 
on them, but keep in mind that holding back soil with more soil isn’t much 
better than having no wall at all.
Some taller types of retaining walls can also be fashioned from wooden 
timbers, landscape ties, reclaimed wood, and logs. If you use treated wood, 
choose the kind that’s free of arsenic.
 
For taller walls, and where you have a surcharge above the wall (a slope rather 
than level ground), you need to use a cantilever wall, consisting of a base and 
a stem. For any wall taller than 4 feet (including the base), or where you have 
a surcharge of soil behind the wall, hire a civil engineer to design the wall. 
Look into building-permit requirements, too.

 Chapter 12: Exploring Basic Hardscape Elements and Outdoor Rooms
Fences and other barriers
Like walls, fences enclose space to create privacy and make an area secure. 
Your most sustainable fence material option is living plants, which do 
wonders to create privacy. Hedges and vines are inexpensive, tagger-proof, 
and offer all the environmental benefits of any biological solution.
If you need a more solid solution, sustainable wooden fences made from 
certified sustainably harvested wood, nontoxic treated posts, and high fly 
ash content concrete to fill the post holes are an option. Unfortunately, 
certified fence lumber can be difficult to find. If you have to buy noncertified 
wood, at least it’s a natural material and not the worst thing you can choose.
 
Modern wooden fence posts are pressure-treated with a nontoxic chemical 
called alkaline copper quaternary (ACQ). It’s much safer than old arsenic-
treated wood, but there are concerns about corrosion of fasteners in contact 
with ACQ. Be sure to use only ACQ-compatible fasteners and hardware; other-
wise, the fence may fail prematurely, which isn’t sustainable at all.
 
If you’re replacing an existing wooden fence, see if you can salvage the fence 
boards, which are often still in excellent condition, and just replace the posts 
and any other rotten wood. Consider using steel posts, which last a lot longer 
than wood ones.
Chain link or other steel fences are common, inexpensive, and pretty sustain-
able too. Steel has a high embodied energy, but the material itself is usually 
recycled and also recyclable, so you’ll know that your new fence will be 
turned into something useful when it’s finally old. Avoid vinyl-coated chain 
link, though.
Breaking wind like the pros
Windy sites call for something to intercept or 
divert the wind away from use areas. A wind-
break not only increases comfort, but also can 
reduce heating and cooling needs inside the 
house. Trees and shrubs are good at breaking 
wind because they absorb energy efficiently. 
Solid fences and walls can actually worsen 
wind on the lee side by creating an eddy effect. 
Slatted or louvered fencing does a better job, as 
does a fence with an angled top to change the 
flow characteristics. Earthen berms or mounds 
can also direct wind.

Part IV: Hardscaping Made Easy 
Topping Off Your Hardscape 
with a Ceiling
Ceilings, living or manmade, offer shelter, shade, enclosure, privacy, architec-
tural interest, and a place to hang your wind chimes. One of my favorite 
memories of my youth is of an intimate little patio tucked into the back fence 
line of an old house, enclosed on all sides but the front, sheltered from rain 
by a solid roof, and furnished with an old-fashioned glider with thick, comfy 
cushions and a couple of big armchairs. It was nothing fancy, but I vividly 
recall sitting there for hours in a state of complete peace. Thinking back on it 
in later years, I realized that if you took away any of the sides — especially 
the roof — the cozy magic would be lost.
Like floors and walls, ceilings may be part of an outdoor room (see “Using 
Sustainable Hardscape Features to Build an Outdoor Room,” later in this 
chapter). This section explains the ins and outs of outdoor ceilings.
Constructed ceilings
The sky is a nice ceiling: It’s time-tested, colorful, attractive, durable, and 
made from local materials; it goes well with nearly any architectural style; 
and it’s free. Still, sometimes the sky isn’t quite what you want in an over-
head structure. It doesn’t keep out the sun or rain, and it doesn’t modify the 
microclimate. And it also doesn’t give you that cozy, snuggly feeling of being 
sheltered by a room-height ceiling. That’s when you turn to the alternatives.
Attractive sustainable overhead structures can be made of salvaged wood, 
driftwood, tree branches, canvas, or metal (the latter is especially good in 
high fire hazard areas). Unlike trees, constructed ceilings require some skill 
to design and build, and usually they’re subject to building codes to make 
them safe.
One type of constructed ceiling is sometimes called a pergola (see Figure 
12-2). A pergola may be just what you need to provide shade while at the 
same time letting in air and light.
Take into consideration the following factors when pondering whether to 
include a constructed ceiling in your plans:
 
✓ Be sure you really need one. A very cool or foggy climate calls for 
openness to let light and heat in, not a shade-casting overhead.
 
✓ Choose a rainproof roof if you live in a wet climate or enjoy being 
outside during wet weather. Remember that fully-roofed structures 
have to be built to withstand wind; check with a builder or landscape 
architect for details.

183
 Chapter 12: Exploring Basic Hardscape Elements and Outdoor Rooms
 
✓ Determine how much shade you want. The density of the structure 
can result in anywhere from 10 to 100 percent shade. If you use parallel 
louvers to cast shade, place them perpendicular to the rays of the sun. 
Take the path of the sun into account when placing your structure, and 
don’t forget to estimate where the sun will be at different times of the 
year. Well-cast shade can make the patio and house more comfortable 
and can save energy.
 
✓ Set the height of your ceiling so that it’s in scale with surrounding 
elements and creates the feeling you want. Tall ceilings feel open; low 
ones, cozy.
 
✓ Don’t paint overhead structures. Painting costs money and uses 
resources. Worst of all, repainting is a huge pain when the time comes, 
especially if you have to remove a covering of mature vines first. 
Penetrating stains are okay; so is natural unfinished wood.
 
✓ If you want a vine on your overhead, choose well. Most vines carry a 
lot of dead stuff beneath them; choose something that looks good 
from below. Make sure that the vine won’t drop litter on your dinner. 
Use a deciduous vine if you want the sunlight to penetrate in winter. Try 
edible vines such as grapes to get more use out of the structure.
 
Check local zoning ordinances to be sure you don’t put an overhead structure 
in a location on your property where it isn’t permitted, and ask whether you 
need a building permit for your structure.

Part IV: Hardscaping Made Easy 
Living ceilings: Trees
What’s more sustainable, durable, or beautiful than a tree? Name another 
overhead that creates oxygen, sequesters carbon, cools by evaporation, 
operates by solar power, costs practically nothing, provides habitat for birds 
and other organisms, lasts for centuries, is fun to climb, and makes flowers 
and fruit.
Plant trees around your patio or other hardscape elements to provide shade, 
or construct your deck or patio underneath existing trees for immediate 
results.
 
Avoid messy or weak-wooded trees, ones that might blow over, and certainly 
ones with root systems that lift pavement. As with all plantings, be sure that 
the tree you choose is adapted to your climate, soil, and other conditions, 
and place it carefully so that it casts shade where you want it. Take size into 
account.
Deciduous trees (ones that lose their leaves in winter) automatically provide 
shade during summer and allow sunlight to penetrate in winter — one of 
the most considerate things about trees. Evergreen trees can make a good 
overhead, too, as long as you can use the shade all year.
The living ecoroof
One of the coolest sustainable landscape elements is the living ecoroof, also 
known as the green roof (see Figure 12-3). Made of drought-tolerant plants 
growing in a shallow layer of lightweight soil held in place by a waterproof 
membrane and supporting structure, or planted in individual recycled plastic 
bins, the ecoroof turns your roof into a beautiful living ecosystem. Ecoroofs 
are showing up all over the place, from tiny sheds covered in succulents to 
the world’s largest (more than 10 acres) covering a Ford Motor Co. plant in 
Michigan. Tax credits are available for ecoroofs in some places.
Ecoroofs offer a number of environmental advantages in addition to their 
special quirky charm. They
 
✓ Absorb rainwater and pollutants, keeping it off the streets
 
✓ Produce oxygen and sequester carbon
 
✓ Cool the climate both inside and out
 
✓ Increase the life of the roof
 
✓ Produce food as well as ornamental plants
 
✓ Create beautiful living surfaces

Before you go dragging a bunch of plants up to your roof, here are some 
important considerations:
 
✓ Ecoroofs aren’t do-it-yourself projects. Hire an expert to help you.
 
✓ Ecoroofs are heavy, so first you need to be sure that your house can 
handle the extra weight. A structural engineer can help. Don’t scrimp on 
this step, because nothing will spoil your day like a squashed house, 
especially if you’re in it. If significant strengthening is required to 
support the ecoroof, it may be beyond a reasonable budget.
 
✓ Ecoroofs can slide off if they aren’t properly anchored. A slide-off isn’t 
quite as bad as a squashed house, but it’s still no picnic.
 
✓ You, too, can slide off your roof, especially if you step back to admire 
your work or trip on a pumpkin vine.
Ecoroofs are pricey and challenging, but they offer great benefits to you and 
the environment. Besides, what’s more fun than having the neighbors decide 
that you’re definitely insane? To decide whether an ecoroof is for you, 
and to find qualified ecoroof professionals in your area, visit Green Roofs 
for Healthy Cities (www.greenroofs.org) and Greenroofs.com (www.

Moving Around Your Landscape 
with Paths and Steps
Moving from one part of the landscape to another should be as close to 
effortless as possible. Paths can be exciting hardscape elements, leading you 
on a journey that’s full of interesting focal points and discoveries. This 
section helps you sort out how to use paths and steps and what materials are 
most sustainable. (Refer to Chapter 14 for construction information.)
Striding along sustainable paths
Paths get people from one place to another comfortably and safely. They lead 
the eye and the mind, too, as a visual element. Paths are indispensable.
Practical paths can be straight or gently curved, and should be as level as 
possible. Locate paths along natural lines of travel so that passage is 
comfortable and so that people don’t cut corners. For high-traffic areas, 
choose solid, wear-resistant paving; for secondary and occasionally used 
paths, select something inexpensive and organic like wood-chip mulch.
Of all places to throw sustainability to the wind, the pathway is perhaps the 
most forgivable. The pavement here must be durable and free of hazards, 
which means you need a solid, smooth path of a permanent hard-wearing 
surface such as concrete, brick, tile, or grouted flagstone.
 
To reduce the environmental impact of your pathway, use bricks or paver 
blocks securely set on sand (so that they can be reused) or high-volume fly 
ash concrete (which uses a waste-stream product and reduces production of 
carbon dioxide). For low-traffic paths, consider stepping stones made from 
urbanite (salvaged concrete). For more information, refer to “Using safe, 
sustainable materials,” earlier in this chapter.
Use light-emitting-diode (LED) path lights, which use a fraction of the 
energy of high- or low-voltage lights. (For more on outdoor lighting, turn 
to Chapter 13.) Getting to your front door is an important daily act for 
your family and others. The experience should be comfortable, safe, and 
welcoming. Provide a pathway that leads unambiguously to the house; 
one that’s wide enough to accommodate two people walking side by side 
(at least 4/2 feet); and that’s smooth, safe, and well lit.

187
 Chapter 12: Exploring Basic Hardscape Elements and Outdoor Rooms
Level changes: Sustainable 
steps and ramps
Steps are used where the terrain is too steep to walk on; they provide a 
controlled way to move up and down. Ramps are handy when the slope is 
gentle enough that steps aren’t necessary. They make it easy to wheel things 
in and out, and they’re safer than steps because there’s nothing to trip on.
Steps and ramps should be wide, even, and well marked with edges defined 
by stones or other edging. They should also have handrails for safety. 
Because the ground isn’t level, safety is the most important consideration. 
However, you don’t have to use unsustainable approaches. As long as they 
aren’t a hazard, natural materials often fit the bill just as well as high-tech 
ones.
 
In the old days, we built steps (and walls) of railroad ties. They were a waste-
stream product, having been removed from railroad tracks when they became 
split or just old. Railroad ties have downsides, though. They’re heavy and 
difficult to cut; and even worse, they’re soaked with creosote, which is a 
health hazard. Their overall nastiness makes railroad ties a bad choice.
Better options include steps made of
 
✓ Urbanite, which is flat, usually around 4 inches thick, easy to stack up, 
and quite handsome. Turning your old patio into steps is ultrasustain-
able (assuming that you don’t need your patio anymore, of course).
 
✓ Landscape ties, which aren’t perfect but provide choices including 
pressure-treated wood, recycled plastic, melted plastic from automo-
biles, and rot-resistant wood timber made from sustainably harvested or 
urban trees. Of the bunch, this last choice, made from trees such as 
black locust, white oak, cedar, or cypress, is a sustainable choice 
because these ties tend to be local, are possibly a waste-stream item, 
aren’t chemically treated, and aren’t plastic.
 
✓ Stone from on-site or nearby. Stone is natural, has a low embodied 
energy, is nontoxic, and is mighty easy on the eyes.
 
✓ Concrete, which can be lower in its impact if you choose high-volume fly 
ash content concrete. Or perhaps try a new carbon-sequestering or even 
pollution-absorbing concrete, which may be on the market by the time 
you read this.
As you can see, no one option is perfect but there are some excellent 
choices.

Using Sustainable Hardscape Features 
to Build an Outdoor Room
Hardscape features combine with plantings to create outdoor rooms, places 
that serve particular functions similar to indoor rooms: eating, entertaining, 
working, and so on. The idea of the outdoor room goes far back in the history 
of landscape design. Cro-Magnon caveowners in the Paleolithic Era had 
spacious outdoor rooms that they used for eviscerating woolly mammoths 
and entertaining visiting troglodytes. Over time, the idea evolved into the 
modern outdoor room equipped with 50 square feet of barbecue-grill surface, 
two convection ovens, a big-screen television set, spa, fitness center, and 
maid’s quarters. Somewhere between these two extremes lies the sensible, 
sustainable outdoor room of the future. You can see a plan for an outdoor 
room in Figure 12-4.
Many outdoor rooms are more versatile than indoor ones, combining func-
tions that you’d never pair up indoors, such as providing a place for lounge 
chairs, bouncing light into the house, and soaking up rainwater. Permaculture, 
a methodology of holistic design, calls this multiple-use approach stacking 
functions, and it’s a hallmark of sustainable design.

 Chapter 12: Exploring Basic Hardscape Elements and Outdoor Rooms
Like indoor rooms, outdoor ones are made up of floors, walls, ceilings, and 
paths. But outdoor rooms usually are less rigidly defined than those in the 
house, with partially transparent walls, less privacy, and few or no doors to 
subdivide the space emphatically.
 
Materials used for outdoor rooms vary widely and can be quite different from 
materials that are used for indoor rooms. However, some continuity can be 
achieved by taking weather-tolerant indoor flooring or wall elements outside.
The ideal outdoor room should feel like part of nature. An overabundance of 
manmade structures and appliances is not only environmentally unsound, 
but it also creates a setting that’s too much like the indoors. The whole 
appeal of having landscaping in the first place is to be closer to natural 
things, so why muck it up with a lot of hardware? After all, the Garden of 
Eden didn’t have a spa and an eight-burner barbecue.
Many outdoor rooms serve the same functions as indoor ones. A patio is a 
type of outdoor living/dining room combination. A lawn is like a playroom. 
A veggie garden or orchard is the pantry. A potting bench is the garden’s 
workbench. The following sections offer the lowdown on some of the most 
common outdoor rooms.
Living and entertaining space
Outdoor living and entertaining space is likely to be located on a patio or 
deck, which usually is the heart of the garden — the locus of individual, 
family, and group activities. As with an indoor living room, the outdoor living 
room can serve many purposes. It can be enclosed and intimate or open and 
expansive.
Keeping the cars happy: Outdoor parking
The automobile is with us for the foreseeable 
future, and both yours and those of your 
guests need to be parked somewhere. Ponder 
the possibilities of making parking space smaller 
and more environmentally friendly. Here are 
some tips:
 ✓ Make your driveway permeable. Runoff 
from driveways causes flooding and pollu-
tion. Use pervious concrete or pervious 
paver blocks so that water soaks in and 
is used by plants rather than going into 
the gutter.
 
 Another cool option made of a honey-
comb of recycled plastic panels is a 
vegetated paving system. They make 
your driveway look totally rad. Check out 
Chapter 14 to see how the system is put 
together.
 ✓ Pave with mulch or gravel. Both are 
permeable and much lower-impact than 
concrete or other formal paving. Just keep 
in mind that gravel attracts weeds.

190
Part IV: Hardscaping Made Easy 
Here are some tips for creating a successful, environmentally-friendly and 
beautiful outdoor living room:
 
✓ Accommodate whatever size group will be using it frequently. Small is 
sustainable. Make the space big enough for regular use, not infrequent 
parties. A family-size outdoor living room should be around 12 feet on 
each side.
 
✓ Create a retreat. Think about making the main room an “away” place, 
somewhat distant from the house so you feel like you’re more immersed 
in the garden and less connected to the hubbub of indoor life.
 
✓ Think about microclimate. Evaluate your planned use and the micro-
environments around the house; then place living spaces where they’ll 
be best adapted. If you’ll be using the space mainly on hot afternoons, 
place your room on the north or east side of the house, away from the 
scalding sun. If the room is to be used for breakfast, put it on the east 
side where morning sun will warm chilly bones.
 
✓ Evaluate wind conditions. Locate your room in the lee of existing 
structures or vegetation or add fences, walls, or plantings to provide a 
windbreak.
 
✓ Consider proximity to neighbors, street noise, odor, traffic patterns, 
and immediate and distant views. If you’re surrounded by unpleasant 
sights, sounds, and smells, you’ll be less inclined to use your outdoor 
room.
 
✓ Take the relationship to indoor rooms into account. Locate the dining 
patio fairly close to the kitchen and not so close to the bedrooms, for 
example.
The outdoor kitchen
Traditional cultures have been cooking outdoors for millennia, using simple 
equipment. Western culture has made outdoor cooking the domain of the 
male of the species, bravely directing the immolation of animal parts on the 
outdoor grill. Recently, entire modern kitchens have been appearing in the 
yards of well-to-do homeowners, complete with nearly everything an indoor 
kitchen would have.
Outdoor cooking is fun, keeps the real kitchen cleaner, and may even use less 
energy. If you’re going to include a kitchen in your hardscape, here are some 
points to consider:

191
 Chapter 12: Exploring Basic Hardscape Elements and Outdoor Rooms
 
✓ Keep it simple. A modest kitchen area with low-impact fixtures and 
appliances is sustainable.
 
✓ Consider cooking with charcoal instead of gas; it isn’t a no-impact 
approach but it’s somewhat better. An even better idea would be to 
incorporate a solar cooker; visit www.solarcooking.org for hot ideas 
on this subject.
 
✓ If you have a sink, let the graywater irrigate your landscape. See Chapter 8 
for the lowdown on graywater.
 
✓ Add solar lighting so you can see whether your tofu is burning.
 
✓ Use natural materials like cob, adobe, and stone.
 
✓ Place the outdoor kitchen close to the indoor kitchen. Don’t make 
yourself carry ingredients, tools, and finished meals all the way across 
the yard.
 
✓ Locate cooking areas where prevailing winds will blow smoke and odors 
away from living areas.
 
✓ Allow room for socializing. People tend to congregate in outdoor 
kitchens the same way they do in indoor ones.
 
✓ Don’t cook under overhanging trees or structures that could catch fire.
Recreation and sports
Kids, adults, and pets all need rec spaces. Generally, these facilities should 
be on level ground, with safe surfaces, and should be located away from 
quiet spaces or fragile plantings. Lawn is the traditional recreational 
surface, and there’s no denying its safety, durability and usefulness. But 
meadows made of yarrow, sedges, or native grasses can stand up to a 
decent amount of play activity too, so consider them for a more sustainable 
alternative.
 
Informal lawn sports like volleyball and badminton require pretty large 
areas (80 x 45 feet and 60 x 30 feet, respectively). Formal recreation courts 
(tennis, racquetball, and so on) aren’t terribly sustainable; they use up 
lots of resources, and they require impervious surfaces and regular mainte-
nance. Similarly, swimming pools are pretty over the top, with their 
immense demands for energy and water. Why not save yourself big bucks 
by enjoying the local public facilities and use your yard to grow food 
instead?

Personal spaces
Personal spaces can be used for meditation, relaxing in a hot tub, reading, or 
sleeping. Needless to say, they should be private, serene, and very beautiful. 
They can be softer and more natural than more formal areas and less depen-
dent on technology. A mulched space surrounded by especially elegant plants 
is quite nice and very sustainable. Think about including some food plants for 
easy snacking while relaxing.

T
his chapter picks up where Chapter 12 left off, introducing more exciting 
hardscape options. After all, sustainable landscaping isn’t supposed 
to be grim or sacrificial. The trick is figuring out how to have fun without 
ruining the planet. A little restraint combined with a few sustainable 
hardscape strategies can add playfulness and beauty to your landscaping.
Including Fine Furniture 
Without Felling Forests
Gardens are places for lingering, and it’s difficult to linger unless you have a 
comfortable place to sit or lie down. So you’ll probably want to include some 
furniture in your landscape.
 
Furniture Rule Number One is this: You aren’t going to buy yard furniture 
made from rainforest woods, built by cowering slave children, and shipped 
halfway around the world in exhaust-belching cargo ships. You’re simply not 
going to go there. Fortunately, you don’t have to; the good green people of the 
world have come up with many guilt-free alternatives. Here are some of them:

194
Part IV: Hardscaping Made Easy 
 
✓Make your own furniture from stuff you already have. Suppose you 
have to take down a tree for some reason. Don’t send it to the chipper if 
you can use the wood to make a bench or other furnishings. If milling 
logs is a little beyond your talents, think about growing your own 
bamboo or saving trimmings from your fruit trees.
 
 As an alternative, construct built-in furniture from local stone or fashion 
furniture from cob, which is basically just soil slapped into the form 
of a bench and coated with a natural mixture of cooked white flour, soil, 
and straw. Adobe blocks and rammed earth can be made from soil 
that’s on your site. For more information, see the nearby sidebar “An 
earth-building primer.”
 
✓ Buy used furniture. Find a bench or chairs with character at a garage 
sale, antique store, or thrift store. Enjoy their funky patina, or restore 
them with a couple coats of nontoxic paint.
 
✓ Use ultra-low-impact materials. Straw bales, wood from urban trees, and 
salvaged or reclaimed lumber are all commonly available, sometimes 
with a little sleuthing. Stack up some straw bales and cover them with 
earthen plaster for a great outdoor sofa. Create nearly any style of 
furniture from salvaged wood. Look for furniture made from these 
materials by local craftsmen. (Supporting local businesses is part of 
the sustainable way.)
 
✓ Purchase commercially available green furniture. Many manufacturers 
now offer well-designed, carefully built sustainable garden furniture of 
all kinds — and at reasonable prices. Spend a little time on the Internet 
to uncover all sorts of possibilities.
Keeping Lighting Environmentally 
Friendly
Why bother lighting your property? Lighting uses energy and involves a lot 
of high-tech gadgetry. Certainly, you don’t need to do any lighting at all. It’s 
supposed to be dark at night; that’s why the sun goes down. Still, a bit of 
lighting can be very nice at times.
 
Lighting used frivolously is not so good, but a fixture used to illuminate a level 
change and keep people from tripping is a justifiable expenditure of resources. 
So is lighting for security, provided that it comes on only when needed. The 
keys to lighting a sustainable landscape are powering up your lighting the 
proper way and using just enough lighting (not more than is necessary).

195
 Chapter 13: Spicing Up Your Hardscape with Other Elements
From an eco-friendly point of view, the two best ways to power garden lights 
are using a transformer to drop voltage to a safe, energy-efficient 12 volts, 
and using solar lights or powering the system from your home’s solar panels.
 
Solar is the most environmentally friendly lighting method, but the solar 
fixtures currently on the market don’t deliver much light, especially if you 
place them in areas that don’t get much sunlight during the day. As a result, 
low-voltage systems make sense for most people.
In addition to a transformer, a low-voltage system consists of some type of 
control to turn lights on and off, underground wiring to send power to the 
fixtures, and the fixtures themselves (see Figure 13-1). The transformer is 
installed indoors or outdoors in an out-of-the-way location that’s central to 
the fixtures it serves.
An earth-building primer
Making walls, benches, and even houses from 
soil is an ancient art going back to the dawn of 
civilization. It appeals to the caveman (and 
cavewoman) in all of us. Soil is the most avail-
able material anywhere (why do you think they 
call it Planet Earth?). It’s right underneath your 
feet, is easy to form into any shape, requires no 
outside energy other than human labor, and is 
as close to a state of nature as you can get. And 
when it’s the end of the line for your earth-made 
bench or toolshed, it can just melt back into the 
ground it came from. With some protection from 
the elements (this is especially important in wet 
climates) and the use of an organic sealer, 
earthen structures will outlast you.
Here are a few variations on the theme:
 ✓ Cob is soil, straw, and water that’s hand-
formed into nearly any shape. It’s the 
simplest and most versatile of earthen 
materials, easily made into free-form and 
rectilinear shapes.
 ✓ Adobe is the same material as cob, but it’s 
formed into large brick-shaped units and 
then stacked and mortared together.
 ✓ Superadobe is a special technique that 
uses long flexible tubes to contain the 
earthen material, forming it into sausages; 
then the sausages are stacked to 
form retaining walls, buildings, and other 
structures.
 ✓ Rammed earth is soil that has been firmly 
compacted between two temporary 
wooden forms. When the forms are 
removed, the smooth, straight walls stand 
on their own.
 ✓ Straw-bale construction uses a core of 
baled straw covered by earthen or 
other plaster. Strictly speaking, it isn’t an 
earth-building technique, but it’s a close 
relative.
You can use any of these methods to build free-
standing walls, benches, chairs, small garden 
buildings, and sculptures. You can find a 
wealth of information out there to help: 
books, Web sites, workshops, and demonstra-
tion projects.

196
Part IV: Hardscaping Made Easy 
The system controller can be a manual switch in the house (call an electri-
cian to install it), a timer on the transformer that turns the lights on and off at 
set times, or a photocell that turns them on at dusk and off at sunrise. If you 
want to automate the system, try a combination of a photocell and a timer. 
This hybrid approach fires up the lights at dusk no matter how long or short 
the days are, making seasonal reprogramming unnecessary. And the timer 
can be set to shut things down at bedtime, eliminating the problem of lights 
staying on all night. This saves energy.
You can make many permutations on basic landscape lighting themes (think 
uplighting trees or downlighting pools of soft light from overhead), but path 
lighting and safety and security lighting get the stamp of approval from the 
sustainability gods.
You can accomplish safety and security lighting with solar-powered motion-
sensing lights mounted on the house. Just avoid placing big spotlights where 
they could come on during outdoor activities and spoil the ambience by 
creating hot spots; they can also disrupt the natural cycles of local wildlife.

The two negative environmental impacts of outdoor lighting systems are 
energy use and light pollution. Light pollution is the leakage of manmade light 
into the night sky, hiding the stars from astronomers, disrupting ecosystems, 
and possibly causing health problems. Fortunately, neither problem is all that 
difficult to solve. Here’s the skinny:
 
✓ Select low-voltage LED (light-emitting diode) fixtures, which use a 
fraction of the power of conventional fixtures. Try solar fixtures where 
you don’t need strong light, because they tend to produce a feeble 
display. Switch lights on only when you need them, and don’t keep 
them burning all night. Or consider a timer and photocell as described 
earlier in this section. Of course, if your house is solar powered, you’re 
home free.
 
✓ The International Dark-Sky Association (IDA) has developed guidelines 
for outdoor lighting and makes recommendations on the best fixtures; 
visit www.darksky.org for details. Keep wattages down, avoid 
directing light upward, use shields on all fixtures to keep the light 
pointed downward, and turn lights off when they aren’t in use.

For Dummies, by Phillip Giroux, Bob Beckstrom, Lance Walheim, and The

Junk or art? Using waste-stream 
materials in your garden
The most sustainable way to bring art into the 
garden is to turn to the waste stream. So much 
great material goes to the landfill every day that 
you’ll have no shortage of ingredients for your 
own amazing sculpture or decorative addition 
to walls, paving, or other structures. Here are a 
few zesty art pieces made from junk that I’ve 
seen in my travels:
 ✓ Pathway edging made from bowling balls
 ✓ A decorative planter made out of old car 
headlights mortared together
 ✓ Paving embedded with found objects
 ✓ Elegant bonsai pots made from old truck 
brake drums
 ✓ Plants growing in old work boots (size 13D, 
if I recall correctly)
 ✓ Totems assembled from coffee cans, doll 
heads, toys, and plastic fruit
With imagination, nearly anything can become 
art. To find materials, try thrift stores, garage 
sales, or dumpster diving. There are even stores 
and community workshops devoted to trans-
forming society’s castoffs into masterpieces; 
they often teach classes and sell materials from 
the waste stream. Consider the creative possi-
bilities for every piece of junk you come across. 
If you lack the talent to come up with your own 
art, press your kids into service, or look around 
the community for local artists doing cool stuff 
with junk.

Water Features: Ponds, Streambeds, 
Waterfalls
People gravitate to water. Maybe it’s because our lives depend on it. Maybe 
it’s because we ourselves are mostly water. Or perhaps it’s just because it’s 
so darn beautiful. Whatever the reason, adding a water element to your 
garden, no matter how small, creates an instant feeling of rightness. Nothing 
can really substitute for water in the garden, and my feeling is that no garden 
should be without a bit of refreshing water somewhere, even if it’s just a 
birdbath.
 
Water features use resources for their construction, require regular top-offs 
with fresh water (at about the same rate as a lawn), and consume electricity 
for pumping. Water features may seem like unsustainable indulgences, but if 
they’re incorporated properly, they produce real benefits to the environment 
that compensate for at least some of the negative effects.
For example, in neighborhoods utterly devoid of natural water sources, I’ve 
encountered backyard ponds and running streams that were hubs of life, 
teeming with bees, birds, frogs, and countless insects (many of them benefi-
cial). I think that a world of diminishing habitats and relentless urbanization 
argues for more water in gardens, not less.
Elements of sustainable water features
You need a vessel of some kind to hold the water: a birdbath, a fountain, 
a ceramic pot, a prefab or custom in-ground pond made of concrete or 
plastic (I prefer concrete), or a running streambed. Some water features are 
kept free of plants and fish, but the sustainable garden is about nurturing 
life, so consider populating your water feature. Plants and fish provide for 
one another and keep the system in balance so that it requires little input 
from you.
Water features can be formal or informal, manmade-looking or naturalistic, 
simple or complex. A bubbling spring can spill into a small stream that 
runs down into a pond reflecting the sky and overhanging tree branches. 
A waterfall can create pleasant sounds to screen noise. A tiered fountain can 
be the centerpiece of a courtyard. The possibilities are endless.
Passive versus active water features
A passive water feature is still and pumpless, such as a lovely urn with stand-
ing water and a plant or two. Because they use no energy, passive water 
features are the more environmentally friendly choice; they create a serene 
mood with no negative impacts and cost very little money.

199
 Chapter 13: Spicing Up Your Hardscape with Other Elements
An active water feature is one that uses a pump to move water for filtration 
purposes or for the beauty of sound and movement of the water. The most 
effective filter for an active water feature is a 10-inch-deep layer of coarse 
(1- to 2-inch-diameter) gravel on the bottom of the pond (see Figure 13-2), 
with a set of PVC-pipe suction lines at the very bottom to draw water down 
through the gravel and return it to the pond via a jet of water or a waterfall. 
(Yes, I know, PVC piping is a no-no. But landscaping isn’t perfect. Other 
types of piping just aren’t possible for this project.) Bacteria come to live 
in the gravel — good bacteria that eat pond gunk for breakfast and will keep 
the water nice and clear. (Check out Landscaping For Dummies for specific 
information on creating an active water feature.)
To keep the bacteria in your active water feature alive, you should use a 
small, low-volume, high-efficiency pump; and you should run it all the time. 
Naturally, a pump uses some electricity, but a 50- to 100-watt pump usually 
moves enough water for a small pond. Larger ponds and thundering water-
falls require larger pumps, of course, which is a good reason to keep your 
pond small. The benefits are the same at any size.
 
Ideally, you’ll use solar power so that operating the pump doesn’t cause a 
drain on the power grid. You can find small pumps that have their own solar 
panels built in; these devices are okay for moving tiny quantities of water but 
not for running an under-gravel filter or powering a rushing stream.

Caring for your water feature
Bringing a new water feature into balance takes a little time. High nutrient 
levels and alkalis leaching from the pond shell must dissipate before you 
introduce permanent organisms. You’ll have a big algae bloom at first, but it 
should diminish with time.
 
Start with some water hyacinths, which grow very quickly and absorb 
nutrients and contaminants. After the growth of these plants has slowed, 
remove them and bring in the permanent residents. You have many plant 
species to choose from. Be sure to include some mosquito fish or goldfish 
to keep the mosquitoes from breeding. This natural approach to mosquito 
control means that you don’t have to treat your water feature with chemicals. 
Over time, your little ecosystem will become nearly self-reliant.
Ongoing maintenance consists of topping off the water (and replacing about 
half of it once a year), cleaning out the worst of the junk, feeding the goldfish 
in summer perhaps, and keeping an eye on the pump. The under-gravel filter 
will work for years with no care whatsoever, but even the best pumps last 
only a couple of years, so plan on replacing yours as needed.
Discouraging critters from checking 
out your water features
Out here in California the raccoon has become one of the dominant suburban 
species — and boy, do raccoons love water features. They brazenly turn 
over pots, trash delicate plants, eat thousand-dollar koi, and generally raise 
hell. I wish I had a perfect solution for their nightly predations, but I don’t. 
However, here are a few tips for mitigation:
 
✓ Avoid small, easily tipped pots. Use big heavy ones that critters can’t 
overturn.
 
✓ Make a hidey hole for the fish. A big clay pipe lying on the bottom 
works; so does a cave of bricks with a heavy pot set on top. An over-
hanging ledge prevents animals from reaching into the water, too.
 
✓ Get dark-colored fish. I suggest this because they’re less visible. Cheap 
feeder goldfish from the pet store are more than adequate for your 
pond; just be sure to pick the dark ones. Or call your local mosquito 
abatement district for some (usually free) mosquito fish, which are 
nearly invisible.
 
✓ Try a little technology. You could use motion-sensing sprinkler heads, 
electric fencing, or plastic bird netting suspended over the water.

201
 Chapter 13: Spicing Up Your Hardscape with Other Elements
 
✓ Place little vials of coyote or other predator urine in the area. Or use 
your own, for that matter. (Do this after dark if neighbors can see you. 
And don’t pee in the pond; go next to it.) Don’t try to collect predator 
urine on your own either; you can buy it online or at some nurseries.
Birds of prey, such as great blue herons, may visit your pond on fishing 
expeditions. You’ll enjoy these visits until you see a huge bird fly off with 
your prized koi. Hawks and owls may also see your pond as a resource — 
but that’s not all bad, especially given the loss of wetlands and other habitats 
that drives these creatures into our backyards.
 
Birds of prey are protected by law, so don’t even think of taking a potshot at 
them. Instead, use netting, motion-sensing sprinkler heads, and the family dog 
as bird deterrents. Herons can sometimes be fooled by decoys. Or try an alli-
gator. (Ha-ha. Just kidding. A grown alligator won’t actually fit in a small pond.)
Working with and around 
natural water features
 
If you’re fortunate enough to have a real stream or pond on your property, 
you have some special responsibilities. It’s usually against federal and local 
laws to modify, pollute, excavate, harass, fold, bend, spindle, or mutilate 
natural bodies of water and the life in them. Be content with enjoying them as 
they are.
If a natural waterway has been damaged and you want to restore it (hats off 
to you!), first check with your local flood control agency to see what regula-
tions apply. You’ll probably have to work with numerous agencies, such as 
the state department of fish and game and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers 
(bet you didn’t know they were looking after your little creek!), your local 
flood control agency as well as biologists and other professionals. Sometimes 
the government will even help pay for restoration work.
The bottom line is that natural waterways are delicate but complex and 
deserve the very best of care. Take advantage of your awareness to do the 
job right.
Incorporating Storage Spaces 
and Work Places
In the excitement of planning a new landscape, you can easily overlook 
boring, practical things like potting benches, trash cans, and garden tools. 
For the avid gardener, these hardscape elements can be central to the 

202
Part IV: Hardscaping Made Easy 
experience of the garden. For those who don’t garden often, these elements 
are accessed as needed and can be in an out-of-the-way location. Either way, 
make sure you plan for the useful areas of your landscape.
The coolest toolshed I ever saw was a curvaceous cob structure with a 
flamboyant ecoroof covered in luscious plants. It was unique, sensual, and 
beautiful, and made from materials mostly found on site, and other than the 
labor required to build this unique shed, it was . . . well, dirt cheap.
You can create the same type of building. With all the information available 
on cob construction, getting up to speed on dirt building is easy. Remember, 
cob isn’t your only choice; you can create a small building out of any earthen 
material: adobe, superadobe, straw bale, or rammed earth. (Refer to the side-
bar “An earth-building primer,” earlier in this chapter, for explanations of 
these materials.) Alternatively, try reclaimed wood, used metal siding, or 
whatever else is available that fits into your overall scheme.
 
Make sure that flooring surfaces in work areas are level, smooth, and solid. 
(If you’ve ever lost a small but important screw in gravel, you know what I’m 
talking about.) Also, be sure to keep these areas away from living areas and 
neighbors if they’ll be sources of noise.
 
An 8- by 10-foot storage shed is wonderful, but if you don’t have that kind of 
room on your property, look for other places to sneak storage in: along fence 
lines, under eaves, or in idle corners. A narrow storage cabinet is ideal for 
garden tools and most small supplies. Be sure to allow at least 3 to 4 feet in 
front for access, and check local zoning laws to be sure you aren’t putting 
your storage in a forbidden location.
Garden work areas such as potting benches, cold frames, and small green-
houses can assist your efforts to propagate plants and grow useful food. 
These structures, which can be made from scrap, make great weekend 
projects. Consider including a salvaged kitchen sink that drains into the 
garden, for washing veggies and pots and watering the garden at the same 
time (assuming that you won’t be using any toxic substances).
Animal Plan-It: Chicken Coops, 
Rabbit Hutches, and the Like
Incorporating small livestock into your landscape system may sound outra-
geous, but it makes sense to balance the extraction of food crops with the 
input of animal-based nutrients such as chicken manure. This arrangement 
replicates ancient agricultural systems and is one of the core principles of 
permaculture. On this planet, plants and animals support one another; 

203
 Chapter 13: Spicing Up Your Hardscape with Other Elements
leaving the animals out of your system forces you to import expensive (and 
inferior) fertilizers to make up the difference. But when you add animals to 
your sustainable landscape, you get to enjoy the benefits of both plant and 
animal productivity.
Poultry in motion: The chicken tractor
Chickens are multipurpose garden elements, providing cultivation, weeding, 
pest control, fertilizer, eggs, and cuteness all in one feathery, clucking pack-
age. Three or four hens will keep a family well supplied with eggs. (Roosters 
will get you busted in most places, though.) A classic henhouse — around 4 
by 8 feet, made very sturdily to keep predators out — is a wonderful addition 
to the sustainable garden. But another approach is even more sustainable 
because it performs more tasks than a henhouse. Stand back — here comes 
the chicken tractor.
A chicken tractor is essentially a portable coop with four walls and a roof 
covered in (what else?) chicken wire; it also has a somewhat enclosed roost-
ing area. What makes this contraption unique is that the bottom is open to 
the ground. Imagine your little cluckers happily munching away on the weeds 
and depositing valuable nutrients on the soil. Now imagine rolling the whole 
shebang, chickens and all, to a fresh spot every couple of weeks. That would 
be a chicken tractor — a cozy, predatorproof, attractive way to get some 
help with the needs of your garden. Figure 13-3 shows how it may look.

tractor.
 
Doin’ the bunny hop
Rabbits aren’t as productive as poultry, because they haven’t invented bunny 
eggs (despite what you’d think at Easter). But rabbit poo makes pretty good 
fertilizer, and the bunnies are adorable!

204
Part IV: Hardscaping Made Easy 
A rabbit hutch usually is a single room, with all sides including the bottom 
made of 1- by 2-inch heavy-gauge wire (smaller for the bottom, according to 
some experts), a rainproof roof, and legs to keep it 3 to 4 feet off the ground 
as protection from predators. Avoid using wood where the bunnies can reach 
it; wood can be harmful to them if chewed, especially if it’s painted.
Other oddball animal habitats
People keep all sorts of animals in their yards, including edible fish in plastic 
garbage cans, allegedly edible snails in aquariums, and the latest trend: 
cowpooling. This trend involves keeping a community cow on a lot in the 
neighborhood to supply everyone with milk. Go figure.

uilding sustainably means reducing your use of power equipment, 
buying locally or not at all, vetting all your materials for their environ-
mental impacts, protecting existing site features, and building things that 
last. Upholding these commitments isn’t difficult (except maybe giving 
up labor-saving power equipment), but it takes care and attention. Your 
rewards? A beautiful, wholesome landscape; hardscape free of contaminants 
and planet-bashing effects; and big-time fitness from doing all that hard work.
In this chapter, I introduce the sustainable aspects of various elements 
of landscape and hardscape construction, particularly site management, 
paving, and wall building. I cover some variations in the construction 
process to make it more sustainable and eco-friendly. Consult Chapter 12

Fossil-Free Construction: Forgoing 
the Heavy Equipment
Tractors are fun. I admit that. I also admit that using heavy equipment to 
move heavy things like soil and rocks saves a lot of work and gets things 

206
Part IV: Hardscaping Made Easy 
done really fast. Unfortunately, tractors, skid-steer loaders, trenchers, and 
other heavy-duty landscaping tools are hard on the environment, and they 
really aren’t very efficient when you factor in the effects and costs of making, 
buying or renting, fueling, repairing, and disposing of them.
In their landmark book Sustainable Landscape Construction: A Guide to Green 
Building Outdoors (Island Press, 2007), J. William Thompson and Kim Sorvig 
point out that an earthmover can move 20 cubic yards of soil 600 feet in less 
than 2 minutes — a task that would take eight workers using hand tools a 
whole day. But the machine’s energy consumption is four times that of the 
laborers, and food to fuel the workers is renewable, whereas fuel for the 
machine is not. Workers generally don’t spew diesel smoke or make a big 
racket, either.
With power tools you also have to consider pollution (running a chain saw 
for 2 hours produces more pollution than driving a car 2,500 miles); noise; 
damage to soil from the weight of the machines; and the effects of tractor 
factories, gas stations, repair shops, and junkyards, to mention just a few. 
Add this all up and you can see why it makes sense to minimize the use of 
power equipment.
 
Electric tools like chain saws and mowers are much more efficient than 
ones that operate on gas or diesel fuel. And if you must use heavy equipment, 
there’s some solace in knowing that smaller machines are much more 
efficient.
The bottom line? Do things by hand whenever possible. It’s better for you 
and for the planet. It’ll take longer, but hey, what’s the hurry? Hand tools 
often do a great job in the hands of a skilled user. A skinny old man in a town 
near mine used to hire himself out to dig huge pits with just a shovel and a 
digging bar. If he could do it, so can you.
Managing Your Site
Many construction sites look like they’re being managed by a 14-year-old, but 
they don’t have to be ugly, messy, and dangerous. A little housekeeping and 
common sense goes a long way toward protecting the environment, being 
respectful of neighbors, and making the work go more smoothly because you 
know where everything is.
Storing materials and equipment safely
First off, let’s agree that you won’t bring any toxic materials onto your 
construction site. I don’t need to tell you that, right? Not inviting rude guests 
to the party is the first rule. Still, even nontoxic materials can be hazardous 
under certain conditions. Follow these guidelines:

207
 Chapter 14: Sustainable Hardscape Construction
 
✓ Keep fertilizers, paints, and chemicals away from waterways.
 
✓ Be especially careful with tools; they can hurt. Keep them locked up or 
at least safely stored in one central location.
 
✓ Take the keys out of heavy equipment when you’re not around.
 
✓ To the degree that it’s practicable, place equipment, vehicles, and piles 
of materials in a part of the property that’s paved. That way the ground 
pressure doesn’t compact the soil or damage tree roots.
Noise and dust control
I live near (not in) one of the wealthiest communities in the world. People are 
continually remodeling, both inside and out. You can hardly find a quiet 
place; so loud is the din of tools, equipment, and music coming from tiny 
radios. During the rare intervals when they aren’t being worked on, most 
of the fine homes are surrounded by the racket of their neighbors’ projects. 
It’s a good lesson in just how noisy most construction activity is.
 
Noise disrupts wildlife. In nature, noise is a sign of danger, and animals 
(including humans) respond to noise with anxiety and preparedness for fight 
or flight. The solution is to avoid using power tools wherever you can; when 
you do use them, stay within your community’s guidelines on hours of use.
Dust is another nuisance that really isn’t difficult to control. Avoid working 
very dry soil; avoid using equipment like rototillers, which stir up a lot 
of dust (and which damage soil anyway); and use the dust-suppression 
attachments that come with most masonry saws and similar equipment.
Erosion Protection during Construction 
and Beyond
Does your soil have big parallel cracks in it? Are utility poles and trees tilting 
at crazy angles? Is your land riddled with gulleys? Does rainwater concen-
trate in one big soil-stripping torrent? Is your house missing its gutters? You 
could be sitting on a soil erosion time bomb. When the rains come, it’s too 
late to do anything about these problems, so tackle them now.
First, get acquainted with the two types of erosion:
 
✓ Surface erosion, which occurs when water carries the topsoil away
 
✓ Landslides, in which huge chunks of a hillside cut loose and plop down 
on the land (or house) below

208
Part IV: Hardscaping Made Easy 
Both types of erosion are potentially very big trouble. Each kind has its own 
set of strategies for control.
 
The early stages of your hardscape project probably will involve laying bare 
large areas of soil. Protecting against soil runoff from your property during 
construction is mandated by federal law, and the penalties can run up to 
$5,000 per day for anyone caught with mud slithering across property lines 
into streets and waterways.
After the job is done, your attention will turn to preventing erosion in the 
established landscape. Hopefully the way you develop the landscape will put 
the problem to rest once and for all, but if you live on unstable soil, erosion 
protection will be an ongoing task. This section helps you handle erosion 
problems, both short term and over the long haul.
Controlling surface erosion
During the course of your project, you need to manage your site with soil 
protection in mind. For many reasons, you want to expose the least amount 
of soil possible. Naked soil can easily wash away, blow away, or become 
a slippery, muddy mess. When major grading is inevitable, here are some 
strategies you can use (see Figure 14-1 for an overview):
 
✓ Make sure that all grading, whether temporary or permanent, directs 
water where it can be controlled.
 
✓ Maintain natural landforms where possible.
 
✓ Avoid concentrating water in one big stream. Spread water out, and look 
downstream to pinpoint where your water is going.
 
✓ Filter runoff with erosion control fabric, straw wattles, silt fencing, and 
other strategies so that only clear, clean water leaves the site. (I explain 
these strategies in the following sections.)
 
✓ If you expect slopes to go through a rainy season before permanent 
landscaping is established, seed or hydroseed them with suitable 
temporary plantings, or mulch them with straw or hay. (For more 
information, see the section on hydroseeding later in this chapter.)
 
Where the risk of runoff problems is low (stable soil and gentle slopes, for 
example), a 3- to 4-inch layer of ordinary recycled organic mulch, available 
from local recyclers or municipalities, can be spread on the area and simply 
left in place after planting is done.

Straw wattle
Erosion control fabric
Roll erosion control blankets made from jute, coconut fiber, straw, or other 
natural materials onto exposed soil to protect it from surface runoff during 
rains. You can use this material on slopes or wherever runoff poses a risk of 
erosion. It lasts a couple of years, decomposing into soil-improving organic 
matter. By that time, your plantings should be well-established.
Installation is simple. Grade the area; dig a shallow trench at the top of the 
slope; bury the ends of the material in the trench; and unroll the fabric down 
the slope, overlapping sections for good coverage. Metal soil staples (the 
same ones used to hold drip irrigation tubing in place) fasten the fabric to 
the soil.
Straw wattles and other runoff control strategies
Straw wattles are one of the cool new ways of intercepting and filtering water 
that sheets off slopes. A straw wattle is a long sausage-like tube about 10 
inches in diameter. It’s filled with rice straw, compost, or other organic mate-
rial. You install it by partially burying it in a shallow trench (about 3 inches 
deep). Place the wattles perpendicular to the slope and in parallel rows 
every 10 to 20 feet down the slope, following the contours of the slope so the 
wattles are level; then secure them with wooden stakes driven into the soil. 
Dirty surface water runs through the wattles and is filtered clean by the 
straw. Reusable sediment tubes work the same way but can be used more 
than once.

210
Part IV: Hardscaping Made Easy 
At the bottom of a slope, use silt fencing as the final line of defense against 
runoff. A silt fence is a long, low ribbon of tightly woven synthetic fabric 
partially buried in a trench and held up with wooden stakes. Should soil 
move downhill, the silt fence traps it. Silt fence is generally not reusable. 
Checkdams are wooden boards or other small obstructions placed across 
gulleys to slow the flow of runoff. Sedimentation basins are pits dug at the 
bottoms of slopes to capture mud-laden runoff before it escapes.
Hydroseeding
Hydroseeding is a process of applying seed to a slurry of wood fiber, fertilizer, 
and binding agents via a huge truck-mounted contraption that shoots the 
mixture up to 50 feet through a hose. The slurry protects the seed and the 
slope. Hydroseeding is fun to watch, and if you choose species of seeds that 
are appropriate to your site conditions, the technique can be a quick and 
inexpensive solution.
Plants that keep the soil in place
The best erosion control devices are sturdy plants with extensive roots to 
knit the soil together. That’s how nature does things; everything else is just a 
temporary solution until the plants grow in.
The best erosion control plants provide a dense canopy of foliage that breaks 
the force of the rainwater and an extensive root system to hold soil in place. 
Provide your new plants proper irrigation using a drip or overhead sprinkler 
system. (See Chapter 7 for information on these systems.)
Preventing landslides
Some land is especially prone to landslides. If you suspect you’re on such 
land, call a geologist for a consultation.
 
Preventing landslides in some geologic conditions is nearly impossible, but 
you can do the following things to prevent catastrophic losses in basically 
stable soils:
 
✓ Avoid terracing slopes so that they catch rainwater (terracing can be a 
great strategy in stable soils but disastrous in fragile situations).
 
✓ Use a drainage system to catch roof water and site runoff and take it well 
away from the slope.
 
✓ Don’t build structures or retaining walls without professional advice.
 
✓ Avoid planting the slope with grasses, which have large numbers of 
stem penetrations (as opposed to individual shrubs with only one stem 
each). Grass blades are little funnels that direct water into the soil and 
supersaturate it, making it more likely to cut loose.

211
 Chapter 14: Sustainable Hardscape Construction
Creating Paved Surfaces for 
Patios, Paths, and More
Paving (or flatwork, as we call it in the biz) will be essential to hardscapes 
until humans learn to levitate. Until that day comes, we need safe, durable 
surfaces. Biological solutions such as ground covers are great up to a point, 
but there comes a time when everyone recognizes the need for something 
more substantial. So it’s good to know that you have sustainable choices. 
Refer to Chapter 12 for more about hardscape material options.
Making a concrete patio
 
Without going into a whole short course on concrete work, here’s some 
critical information on creating a patio. I recommend that you have a profes-
sional handle this work, but if you’re determined to do it yourself, keep these 
tips in mind:
 
✓ Safety first! Avoid all skin contact with wet concrete, which can be 
toxic.
 
✓ Prepare your soil. If your soil is expansive or unstable, place a layer of 
sand or base material under the slab to isolate it. In any case, install 
your patio on undisturbed or well-compacted soil so it doesn’t settle.
 
✓ Set your forms carefully. Make sure you have at least 1/4 inch of slope 
per foot of run so water drains away from structures. Stake forms 
carefully so they don’t shift during the pour.
 
✓ Buy ready-mixed concrete instead of mixing your own. Purchasing 
ready-mix saves a lot of work. You won’t have time to mix, pour, and 
finish if you’re working by yourself or with only one helper.
 
✓ Don’t try to finish concrete yourself. Finishing is the art of making a 
nice smooth surface; it’s a whole lot trickier than you might think and 
isn’t something for beginners to tackle. If you haven’t finished concrete 
before, hire a finisher even if you do the rest of the work yourself.
Placing unit pavers on a subslab
Where you need a stable, permanent pavement, one solution is to mortar 
individual unit pavers (or simply pavers) such as brick, paver blocks, 
flagstone, or tile over a subslab of poured concrete. However, this method 
increases your cost and also the environmental impact because that concrete 
has to come from somewhere. Plus, once you mortar those puppies down 
they can’t easily be reused in the future.

212
Part IV: Hardscaping Made Easy 
Make your subslab 4 inches thick, and give it a rough broom finish that you’ll 
stick the pavers to with thin-set mortar mix. If you’re pouring onto an expan-
sive soil (gooey clay that moves in response to changes in soil moisture), use 
a sand subgrade under the subslab, and install a grid of #3 steel rebar (steel 
rod used to strengthen) at 24 inches on center to keep the subslab from 
cracking.
 
If your soil is stable, you could leave the rebar out, which would make the 
subslab reusable as urbanite if the pavement is ever taken up (rebar makes 
reuse nearly impossible). Without the rebar, you may get some cracking, but 
perhaps that’s a small price to pay to improve the integrity of the project.
Positioning unit pavers on sand
Positioning unit pavers on sand is cheaper than installing a subslab, and it 
allows the pavers to be reused. Water will penetrate through the cracks in 
the pavers and into the soil, reducing runoff. The downside is that over time, 
the pavers can settle, causing unevenness that can make the surface difficult 
to walk on and possibly even hazardous. However, it’s easy to reset sunken 
areas. You simply lift the pavers, add a little more sand, and replace them.
 
A 3- to 4-inch-deep layer of builder’s sand is usually adequate. If you want a 
firmer base, add portland cement to the sand (up to 10 percent by volume), 
along with enough water to make the mixture moist but not wet. (The pavers 
can be reused because they don’t stick to the sand/cement base.)
Installing vegetated paving systems
Vegetated paving systems help make your driveway and other areas perme-
able so that water soaks in and is used by plants rather than going into the 
gutter. These systems were designed to be used with lawn grasses, but 
no law says you can’t plant them with native plants, wildflowers, or even 
broccoli. (Well, because the systems are made to be driven on, maybe 
broccoli isn’t such a great idea.) You can see how a typical system is put 
together in Figure 14-2.
Numerous vegetated paving products are on the market, and each manufac-
turer has its own specifications for installation. The general idea is to 
excavate down a foot or more; replace the native soil with a base material 
like crushed rock that will support the weight of vehicles; add a layer of good 
soil; place the plastic or concrete support material on the graded soil; add 
more soil (or sand, in some cases); and then sod or plant it from seed.

You may want to incorporate a sprinkler system if you’ll be planting some-
thing that needs regular watering. It’s better, though, to choose plants that 
thrive on natural rainfall.
Spreading loose paving materials
If you want a paved surface that’s easy to install, loose paving materials, such 
as gravel or decomposed granite (d.g., as we affectionately refer to it in the 
business), are the way to go. However, don’t apply loose materials to slopes 
where they can slide downhill and be dangerous to walk on; they’re only 
meant for level or nearly level ground.
 
Many people put a layer of weed control fabric under the gravel. This practice 
isn’t such a great idea because weeds come in from the top, their roots grow 
through the fabric, and they become impossible to pull out, making spraying 
with herbicides necessary. Also, gravel dust can change your soil chemistry 
enough to harm plants. Wash the gravel off before using it. Do this on a paved 
area where the sediment can be trapped within a ring of straw wattles and 
swept up when dry for safe disposal. Be sure that only clean water runs off 
the area.
To construct your paved surface, prepare your subgrade, paying attention to 
where the water will go during rains. Then place your gravel or d.g. on the 
subgrade. For gravel or crushed rock, use no more than a 1-inch-thick layer in 
most cases; deeper gravel can be difficult to walk on.

214
Part IV: Hardscaping Made Easy 
Decomposed granite goes on 3 to 4 inches deep. Excavate the soil to accom-
modate the material or install header boards made of recycled plastic lumber 
so that the d.g. is entirely or partially above grade. Place the d.g. and grade it 
level with a rake, then wet it with a hose and compact it with a water-filled 
lawn roller so it will stay in place. Unlike gravel, d.g. forms a pretty solid 
surface. Many people mix portland cement or special stabilizing agents with 
the loose d.g. before they place and compact it; this technique helps it last 
longer but also makes it impracticable to reuse the material.
Opting for mulch
A 3- to 4-inch-thick layer of wood chips or other organic mulch is fine for 
areas with light foot traffic. Even though it’s last in this list, make it your first 
choice when you don’t need the durability of a hard surface.
Mulch is simple to install; just dump it and rake it around. But before placing 
the mulch, lower the soil 3 inches along the edges of pavement so that the 
mulch won’t spill onto the paved area. Don’t put anything down under the 
mulch; weed control fabrics make weeding even harder and plastic sheeting 
interrupts the movement of water into the soil. If you have serious weed 
problems, put three to four layers of corrugated cardboard on the surface of 
the soil before you place the mulch.
Tips for Constructing Steps Sustainably
Landscaping, like life, has its ups and downs — literally, in the case of steps. 
Negotiating the journey safely and comfortably doesn’t mean throwing 
environmental considerations out the window, however. First refer to 
Chapter 12 to pick out the sustainable material you want to use, and then 
head to Landscaping For Dummies, which tells you how to build garden steps 
out of stone or timber. Here I provide tips for putting steps together safely 
and sustainably:
 
✓ If you make steps from stone, set larger stones directly into the soil 
without any use of concrete (making them a reusable heritage material).
 
✓ If you use smaller, less stable stones, make sure the steps are tied 
together with strong concrete footings containing plenty of steel so they 
don’t crack or move independently.
 
✓ Placing rebar in a set of steps is a good idea, because steps are subject 
to movement and cracking. Adding rebar means that your steps won’t 
be as easy to recycle at the end of their life, but they’ll last longer.

Raising Earthen Garden Walls
Chapter 12 helps you select materials for fences and walls (garden as well 
as masonry), and Landscaping For Dummies tells you how to build them. So 
here I focus on a more unique yet sustainable construction project: building 
earthen garden walls.
Earthen walls come in many forms. In the following sections, I include general 
instructions and tips for building the three most popular kinds of earthen 
walls. This is a basic treatment of a complex subject; for more information 
visit www.greenhomebuilding.com. Or get a copy of the excellent book 
The Hand-Sculpted House by Ianto Evans, Michael G. Smith, and Linda Smiley 
(Chelsea Green Publishing Company).
Getting the soil right
The soil for earthen structures should be a sandy loam, not expansive (which 
means that it won’t swell and shrink to the point of cracking), with a low 
organic-matter content. The National Bureau of Standards (NBS), which 
ought to know about these things, recommends a mix of 17 percent clay, 25 
percent silt, 19 percent coarse sand, and 42 percent fine sand. (Note: Those 
NBS folks may be real smart, but they sure can’t add. Still, their advice 
makes sense as long as you adjust the numbers a little bit to come out to 100 
percent. Don’t exceed 100 percent; if you do, you may experience structural 
problems.) Straw is often added to the soil mixture to improve its strength. 
Water content should be around 10 percent (7 percent for rammed earth).
Use soil from your site if it can be taken without damaging the environment; 
soil can come from a spot where you’ll be building a structure. Using on-site 
soil is the most sustainable way to go. Whatever the source, choose your soil 
carefully.
Waterproof the soil by mixing asphaltic emulsion (a bad petroleum-based 
product) at 4 percent by volume into the mud when making the bricks; they’ll 
last a lot longer. You can also add portland cement (up to 6 percent of the 
total volume) to waterproof and strengthen the material. Keep in mind that 
these adulterants make the wall less recyclable. However, it will still have a 
much lower impact than a concrete block or other conventional wall.
 
It’s a good idea to do a test block to be sure your soil mixture won’t crack 
excessively. Adjust the clay/sand ratio of your soil if you have problems. Add 
clay if the soil is too crumbly and sand if it cracks too much.

Part IV: Hardscaping Made Easy 
Building a solid foundation
The long-term stability of your wall depends on a solid foundation, or footing 
as it’s often called. In a stable soil that has the strength to support a lot of 
weight (and that doesn’t expand and contract with changes in moisture 
content) you have some latitude in the kind and size of footing you use. Less 
favorable soils may require the help of an engineer to design a solid footing 
for a long-lasting wall.
 
Earthen walls are often put on a conventional concrete footing, but they can 
also be built on stone or other more natural waterproof materials. The founda-
tion should go below the frost line in cold climates and must be strong enough 
to hold the wall. For a wall under 2 feet in height, a foundation 12 to 18 inches 
wide and 8 to 12 inches deep is usually adequate. But soil conditions may 
require larger footings in some cases; consult with a civil engineer if you aren’t 
sure. Also be sure to check local building codes for requirements in your area.
Plastering your wall
An earthen wall isn’t naturally waterproof, but covering it with a natural 
plaster (not a conventional cement-based plaster that can cause moisture 
problems and eventual failure) can make it last much longer. You can also 
cover earthen walls with a projecting protective tile or wooden cap to keep 
them from melting in the rain. This is especially important in wet climates.
Many recipes are available for plasters that are friendly to earthen walls (and 
the environment). They contain earth and other elements, such as sand, 
straw, cooked flour paste, and various kinds of feces; they generally don’t 
contain cement-based materials or anything that would seal the wall up. Like 
humans, earthen structures need to breathe; if they can’t, they eventually 
fall apart. For good info on earthen plasters, check out the book The Hand-
Sculpted House, which I mention earlier. Or pick up The Natural Plaster Book 
by Cedar Rose Guelberth and Dan Chiras (New Society Publishers.)
Putting your wall together
If you’re ready to put your wall together, you’ve come to the right place. In 
this section, I provide a rundown of techniques that are specific to the many 
different kinds of walls.
Adobe block
Adobe is soil formed into large, unfired bricks and dried until quite solid. You 
can buy adobe bricks in many areas, especially the Southwest, or you can 
make your own. Here’s how:

217
 Chapter 14: Sustainable Hardscape Construction
 
1. Prepare a level, open area of bare ground where you can make the 
blocks and leave them to dry in the sun.
 
 If you’ll be buying soil, be sure the site is accessible by truck. If you can, 
choose a spot that’s close to where the bricks will be used (carrying is 
hard work). Make blocks in warm, dry weather so they cure properly.
 
2. Create shallow wooden forms made from four 2 x 4s nailed into an 
8-x-16-inch rectangle.
 
 Blocks should be around 8 inches wide and 16 inches long for most land-
scaping applications. Anything larger is too heavy to carry. However, a 
4-inch-thick block offers strength.
 
3. Mix soil with water into a dough-like consistency.
 
 Each 8-x-16-x-4-inch block uses about one third of a cubic foot of soil, so 
you’ll get about 80 blocks out of a cubic yard of soil. You’ll also need 
about 65 to 75 gallons of water to mix with each cubic yard of dry soil.
 
4. Place the forms on level ground and lightly wet them. Then place the 
soil in them.
 
 Place a thin layer of sand on the bottom of the form to prevent the 
blocks from sticking to the ground.
 
5. Tamp the soil well to exclude air pockets, and then let it set up for an 
hour or so before gently lifting the form from the block.
 
6. Allow the blocks to cure for at least three days or until they can be 
moved without breakage.
 
 Stand them on edge next to each other to save space. However, be sure 
to leave air space around the blocks so they dry properly.
 
Allow the blocks to dry in hot sun for at least two weeks before using.
When your bricks are ready, follow these general steps to build a non-
retaining wall under 2 feet tall. First build a foundation (see the earlier 
section “Building a solid foundation”). Then drive two tall wooden stakes 
into the ground at the two ends of your foundation. Stretch a level string 
between them, right near where you’re laying blocks; the string will give you 
something to measure to so your wall ends up straight and level. Lay the 
blocks in an overlapping pattern like bricks.
Now mortar the blocks in place. You can use regular cement mortar, or for an 
ultra-sustainable wall, use earthen mortar of the same material that the 
blocks are made of. (Sift the dry soil you’ll use to make the mortar so rocks 
and trash are removed.) The mortar joints should be ½  - to ¾  -inch thick. Place 
a single piece of #3 rebar horizontally in the mortar between courses (layers) 
of blocks. If you use a concrete foundation, install vertical rebars every 4 feet, 
running from inside the concrete up through the wall (you’ll have to drill 
holes in the blocks so that the rebar can pass through them).

218
Part IV: Hardscaping Made Easy 
Rammed earth
Rammed-earth walls are truly lovely. Here are brief instructions for building 
a wall with this material. First build a foundation (see the earlier section 
“Building a solid foundation”). Then set up two low, very strong wooden 
forms parallel to each other on top of the foundation. Use 2- x 12-inch 
wooden boards for the forms, placing them horizontally on top of the founda-
tion. Limit the height of your form to 24 inches (to build a higher wall, move 
the forms upward on the finished portion of the wall). Fasten the forms 
together by screwing them to vertical 2 x 4s placed every 4 feet along the 
outside of the horizontal forms. Brace the forms using 2 x 4s set at 45 degree 
angles from the ground up to the top of the horizontal form boards; there 
should be a brace every 2 to 3 feet. Secure the braces to the ground with 
strong stakes driven into the soil. Your forms have to be sturdy to resist the 
forces of tamping.
Next, place earth in the forms and compact it by hand (very sustainable, hard 
work) or with a pneumatic tamper. (In ancient China, people whacked it with 
giant baseball bats.) Be sure the corners get compacted, but avoid hitting the 
sides of the forms. Compaction is adequate when the tool bounces off the soil 
surface. Let the soil sit for 24 hours before removing the forms.
Finally, raise the forms on the finished section of the wall and repeat the 
process until the wall reaches the desired height. You can add layers of 
different colored earth for a striated, geological effect.
Cob
A cob wall (see Figure 14-3) is made of chunks of mud slapped into place on 
top of one another and then smooshed into whatever size and shape you 
want the wall to be. This technique makes for a lot of artistic freedom, so 
cob walls tend to be curvaceous, interesting, and often embellished with 
bas-relief dragons and lizards, embedded bottles, and other handmade artsy 
touches.
The first step in making cob is to mix the earth, straw, and water. One 
traditional approach is to place the materials into a pit and then stomp on 
them. Often this is done by several people who link arms, chant, and make a 
dance out of it. All very festive. You also can mix on a tarp, concrete slab, or 
sheet of plywood. To mix, add water to the soil, working it until it’s a doughy 
mass and not too wet. Then start adding straw (a total of about 2 pounds of 
straw per cubic foot of soil) and stomping it in. When the mix is stiff, and it’s 
difficult to pull a chunk away from the larger mass, it’s ready to use.

219

Now you can knead “loaves” of the wet soil and plop them on top of one 
another to form the wall. Make the loaves small enough that you can carry 
them to and from the mixing location to the wall. To get a good bond 
between layers of cob, use a cobber’s thumb to punch the newly-applied loaf 
into the ones below it, stitching the layers together into one single mass of 
soil. (A cobber’s thumb is a stubby wooden rod with a ball at the end that’s 
just big enough to fit in the palm of your hand. In a pinch, a broom handle or 
wooden dowel will do.)
 
As you go, eliminate any seams, gaps, or voids, which can weaken the struc-
ture. Place yourself above the work to avoid muscle strain and to use the 
weight of your body to compress the cobs into a single mass. Don’t work the 
wall too much, though, because excessive pressure can make it turn to jelly 
and lose strength. Allow the finished surface of the wall to be somewhat rough 
so it dries properly; a smooth surface will seal moisture inside. (Your earthen 
plaster coat will cover the roughness.) Don’t let the surface dry out as you’re 
working; otherwise you’ll weaken the bonds between the layers of cob. If the 
surface does dry out, be sure to rewet it before adding any more cobs. If the 
wall starts to bulge out from the weight of the material, trim off the excess and 
slow the process down to allow the soil to partially solidify.

Holding Back: Retaining Structures
You retain soil for a variety of reasons, the most common being to create 
level ground where you once had a slope. You have to build retaining walls 
correctly, though, or you’ll have a world of trouble. Your backyard could end 
up sleeping in your bedroom.
 
If you’ll be building a retaining wall taller than 4 feet from the bottom of the 
footing (foundation) to the top of the wall, or if you have a slope behind 
the wall (called a surcharge), do yourself a favor: Talk to a civil engineer first. 
Remember, too, that taller walls require building permits.
Living solutions to retaining challenges
Look first at biological solutions for holding slopes back. If your slope is grad-
ual enough that deep-rooted ground covers (or better yet, tall shrubs) will 
hold it in place, you score big in the sustainability and tightwad departments. 
Bully for you.
 
Choose climate-appropriate plants that also have recognized potential for 
erosion control. Generally, these plants have roots that are deeper and 
stronger than those of average plants, can thrive on little or no supplemental 
watering beyond what nature delivers, and are long-lived and dependable. 
How do you find such plants? Your best bet is to talk to a local horticulturist 
or landscape professional who’s knowledgeable about such situations. 
Gardening books help, of course, and so does the Internet, but there’s really 
no substitute for local experience.
Piling up stone retaining walls
Lucky is the property owner who has an abundance of good solid stones on 
the land. Stones are useful for many landscaping applications, especially for 
retaining slopes. Even if you don’t have stone on your land, local stone is low 
Wally’s World
It’s truly amazing how much weight you can 
move around safely if you know what you’re 
doing. A guy in Michigan can move and raise 
stone blocks of almost 10 tons by himself — 
without any heavy equipment. He’s replicating 
Stonehenge in his backyard. Search YouTube 
(www.youtube.com) for Wally Wallington to 
see an amazing sight. But you’re not Wally, and 
you’d better learn what you’re doing before you 
start heaving rocks around.

221
 Chapter 14: Sustainable Hardscape Construction
in embodied energy and delivers a durable result at little environmental cost. 
(Speaking of cost, stone can often be had for the hauling, especially from 
farmers’ fields and construction sites.)
If your soil is stable and your wall isn’t too tall, start with a base course of 
stone buried in the soil. In unstable situations use a poured concrete founda-
tion (and get help from a civil engineer when designing your wall). Make your 
base deeper in colder climates to allow for the freeze-thaw cycle that can 
heave shallow footings and ruin walls. The lowest-impact wall is the dry-laid 
stone wall, which is fitted together without mortar. Dry-laid walls are leaned 
back into the slope (this very particular lean is called batter) at a ratio 
of 1 foot of lean for every 3 to 6 feet of wall height, depending on the soil 
conditions and type of stone you’re using.
Refer to Landscaping For Dummies for further directions on building a great 
stone wall.
 
Keep in mind that this project is not only dangerous but challenging, both 
physically (you will be tired) and in terms of the skills needed to do a truly 
decent job. But it’s a great do-it-yourself project for very fit homeowners (or 
for those who aspire to be fit). As always, check local building codes, and get 
professional help if you aren’t sure what to do.
Assembling block retaining walls
The conventional concrete block wall (which is also known as a cinder block 
wall) on a poured concrete footing is an undertaking even for professionals 
or very skilled amateurs. Luckily, over the past couple of decades, the 
popularity of segmental retaining wall systems (SRWs), using blocks that fit 
together without mortar (like Lincoln logs), has increased greatly (check out 
Figure 12-1 in Chapter 12 for a visual). SRWs are easier to put together than 
conventional block walls, and most important, they’re easy to dismantle and 
use again and again, making them a heritage material. The SRW is a preengi-
neered and very strong wall that any able-bodied do-it-yourselfer can build.
SRWs don’t require a foundation. They’re stacked on a shallow leveling pad, 
which is a 6-inch deep by 30-inch wide layer of crushed rock placed in a 
trench. It’s important to get this layer very level so the wall itself is level. Lay 
your base course of block on top of the leveling pad, using a level string line 
attached to two stakes driven into the ground to keep the wall straight.
 
You don’t use any mortar with an SRW and you don’t fill the interior cells of 
the blocks with concrete as you do with a conventional block wall.
Lay additional courses of block on top of your base course. Cap the wall with 
matching cap pieces, and backfill behind the wall with gravel. Depending on 
the type of wall, it may be necessary to install a French drain (see Chapter 8 
for details) behind the wall to carry excess water away.

Building earthen retaining walls
 
Generally speaking, using earth to hold up more earth is not the smartest 
thing to do. You need something stronger. Yes, you can make a low wall out 
of any earthen materials, but keep it 18 inches tall or less, preferably without 
a surcharge (a slope above the wall). Refer to the earlier section “Raising 
Earthen Garden Walls” for more on creating earthen walls.
One pretty amazing earth technology called superadobe really works for 
retaining walls, however. Visionary architect Nader Khalili developed a 
method of filling long fabric tubes with soil and arranging the tubes like a 
coil pot to make retaining or freestanding walls and buildings. The walls 
are plastered so the tubes don’t show. The strength and longevity of this 
material are excellent. Visit the Cal-Earth Web site (www.calearth.org) 
for the lowdown on this extraordinary approach.
Erecting wood and timber retaining walls
Timber walls, properly installed, can be quite strong and very handsome. 
They don’t require a concrete footing — just a first course of timbers laid 
below grade (that is, below the surface of the ground). Leave the timbers long 
and stack them one layer on the next, overlapping them halfway with courses 
above and below as though you were laying bricks. The best way to connect 
them is to drill through two or three courses and drive #4 steel rebar or 
galvanized steel pipe down through them. This all-but-invisible reinforcement 
creates incredible strength.
For taller walls, it’s a good idea to install some vertical posts of the same 
material, buried at least 2 feet (preferably 3 feet or more) into the ground in 
front of the wall, spaced 4 to 8 feet apart. Another strategy is to use deadmen, 
which are long ties that extend back into the slope to add tremendous 
strength. You can even make a freestanding vertically oriented wall by dig-
ging a trench and standing ties up in it, fastening the ties together with rebar.
You can create many variations on the basic theme; a little imagination can 
produce walls with built-in seating, arbors overhead, steps integrated into 
the walls, and many more features.
 
Depending on the material you use and on how well they’re constructed, 
timber walls can last 10 to 20 years. If you backfill your wall with gravel to 
keep soil away from the wood, you can make it last longer.

▶ Cleaning up your hardscape surfaces
▶ Keeping your wood deck in good, usable condition
▶ Doing general safety checks
A
 well-built and intelligently designed sustainable hardscape pretty 
much takes care of itself because it’s made properly of stuff that lasts 
a long time with little or no care. Not that this idea is a new one, mind you: 
Consider the maintenance requirements of the Giza pyramids, the Roman 
aqueducts, or Stonehenge. Okay, I know that they’re going to rack and ruin, 
but slowly, over thousands of years. In the meantime they require very little 
care because they were built properly in the first place.
This chapter tells you what kind of maintenance you can expect to perform 
on your well-designed sustainable hardscape.
Sustainable Surface Care: One Big Secret
 
Here’s the story: Don’t paint, seal, stain, or otherwise coat anything. Ever. 
Well, okay, there are a couple exceptions. Cob construction, for example, 
needs to be sealed with natural coatings to protect it from the weather. It’s 
also okay to use a penetrating natural stain to color wood or concrete and 
then let it weather naturally. The key is to avoid toxic materials and labor-
intensive processes. Use materials that have an integral finish — such as 
stone, wood, concrete, brick, and tile — and then leave them alone to age 
naturally. These materials look good just as they are. If you start applying 
finishes, you’ll find no end to the scraping, sanding, sandblasting, priming, 
painting, and related chores that you’ll have to do.

224
Part IV: Hardscaping Made Easy 
Maybe you don’t give a hoot about the environment. Maybe you hate the 
environment. Fine. Just suppose that you never have to do any of this tedious 
work again. That’s okay even though it’s good for the environment, right? 
So lay off the finishes, and enjoy being lazy.
Hosing, Blowing, and Sweeping: 
Keeping Things Clean
The prevailing wisdom out my way is that hosing off surfaces is a very bad, 
antisocial, wasteful, totally uncool thing to do. Mostly, that wisdom is true: 
Hosing wastes water, and sweeping or raking gets the job done without con-
suming anything. But exceptions exist.
Studies show that people who hand-water their landscapes, using a hose, use 
less water than those who have an automatic irrigation system. Suppose that 
you’re one of those people, and your flower beds need watering. Using the 
water to wash off the adjacent walkways, allowing the water to run usefully 
into the beds, is actually better than sweeping or blowing the walkways, 
because it uses the water twice: once to clean and once to irrigate. Don’t tell 
my sustainable friends, but I do this at home. They’d be horrified and might 
not understand the logic, but it works. The other good thing about washing 
the place down is that keeping foliage dust free helps it photosynthesize 
better, because more light is reaching the leaves. It also knocks down pests.
On the other hand, if your wash water is going down a drain or the beds 
really didn’t need watering, yes, you’re bad, very bad, and totally uncool in 
the very worst way. Like most decisions, the wash/no wash choice is com-
plex; each situation needs to be evaluated in its own light.
Sweeping, of course, is classic cleanup m.o. and good exercise, too. What’s 
more ancient and time-tested than a broom? Or hey, forget the broom — an 
old gardener in my town used palm fronds to sweep sidewalks and other 
paving. That trick is kind of hard to pull off in Minnesota, on account of the 
relatively few palm trees growing there, but where you can find a natural 
tool that works, you’re way ahead of the curve.
 
The real bad boy of garden care is the power blower. Most landscaping 
professionals continue to insist that mechanical blowers are essential to their 
survival. Nonsense. The blower sucks in dinosaur juice (also known as fossil 
fuels) and spits out noise and exhaust fumes while stirring up potentially toxic 
dust and blowing it into the neighbor’s yard. This situation is completely crazy. 
Don’t own one of these fiendish contraptions, and if you catch your gardener 
using one, fire him. (Blowers are illegal in many progressive communities, but 

225
 Chapter 15: Hardscape Maintenance
in my little town, there’s virtually no enforcement. One local curmudgeon 
snatched the blower off an offending gardener’s back and smashed it on the 
ground. He got arrested, but many of the residents secretly considered him 
to be a hero.)
What’s Noshing on My Deck?
If it weren’t for the fact that sometimes, nothing but a deck will get you level 
space at a reasonable cost, I’d recommend that nobody ever put in a deck. 
Still, the United States has 30 million decks, so they clearly meet a need for 
many people, such as those whose homes are on very steep terrain.
However, wood decks are notoriously vulnerable to attack by various pests 
and pathogens as well as to the general ravages of weather, sun, and time. 
Alternative decking materials, such as plastic lumber (see Chapter 12), are 
much easier to live with and require no maintenance other than periodic 
cleaning. But they’re usually used in combination with natural wood framing, 
which has its own problems.
Termites
In many climates, termites are the bane of every homeowner’s existence, con-
stantly noshing on the house and any other wood that’s handy. Decks are no 
exceptions; in fact, they’re particularly vulnerable because they’re hanging 
out there like tempting slabs of chocolate layer cake. In the old days, termite 
remedies were toxic to more than just the termites and didn’t always work so 
well. Nowadays, safe, effective new control methods are available. I explain 
everything you need to know in the following sections.
Practicing your best defense: Prevention
 
The first line of termite defense is prevention. All the eradication techniques 
are useless if your deck is vulnerable in the first place. So follow these preven-
tion tips:
 
✓ Termites love moisture, so keeping things dry is a good start at con-
trolling them. Direct sprinklers away from the deck. Plant drought-
tolerant plants nearby, but keep all plant parts at least 24 inches away 
from the deck. Direct runoff away from the area. Don’t let water from 
potted plants soak through to the deck; use waterproof saucers that 
drain clear of all decking.

226
Part IV: Hardscaping Made Easy 
 
✓ Build your deck properly, with an eye toward making it less vulner-
able. Contact between soil and wood is a good way to call up a termite 
infestation, for example. Set posts on concrete footings, and put the 
posts in special metal anchors that hold the ends up in the air.
 
✓ Never store wood or allow wood scraps to be left in the vicinity of the 
deck. Termites often feed on these canapés before moving on to the 
structure entree.
Calling in the pros
Unfortunately, prevention sometimes doesn’t cut it, and your deck may be 
attacked despite great housekeeping. For severe infestations, call a licensed 
structural pest-control professional who understands and uses the least toxic 
methods. No matter what you do, however, remember that the termites will 
be back. You need to make at least annual inspections of all wood and treat it 
for termites as necessary. Look for entry holes, mud tubes, hollowed-out 
wood, and piles of fecal pellets (a fancy term for termite poop, which looks a 
bit like sand). Dogs are sometimes used to detect termites (probably not 
your dog, though).
Knowing your termites
These wood-eating pests fall into two categories: subterranean termites, which 
are quite widespread, and drywood termites, which live in warm climates. 
(The Southern United States and California are at highest risk for both kinds 
of termites.) Within these categories are a number of species, each with its 
specific behavior patterns. Check with local organic pest-control profession-
als for details on what works against the termites in your area.
Controlling subterranean termites
Subterranean termites generally are controlled with in-ground bait stations, 
but some nontoxic approaches are slowly moving out of the experimental 
category. A sand barrier, for example, is a mechanical deterrent that involves 
surrounding vulnerable wood with a 4-inch-deep by 24-inch-wide moat of 
sand or ground cinders. You can’t use just any sand, though. You need a 
specific size, called 16 grit, that’s too big for the termites to move around and 
too small for them to use as substrate for building the protective tunnels 
(known as mud tubes or shelter tubes) they need to get to your deck posts.
You can also clad posts and other vulnerable wood with metal flashing or 
special termiteproof stainless steel mesh. You need to install this material 
with the utmost care, though, because termites can pass through a 1/64-inch 
opening.
Other defenses include treatment with nematodes, boric acid, or desiccants 
such as diatomaceous earth. There’s also the simple act of finding and 
destroying the underground nest.

227
 Chapter 15: Hardscape Maintenance
Controlling drywood termites
Drywood termites enter wood from the air, not the ground. After they 
enter a piece of wood, they can be impossible to detect until something 
collapses from the effects of their feeding. According to independent 
authorities, no homeowner-applied treatments are effective on drywood 
termites; professionals should be called in at the first sign of infestation.
Nontoxic treatments include heating the wood with big space heaters (diffi-
cult to do on a deck, though), using localized heat guns, chilling them out 
with liquid nitrogen, zapping them with electricity, and sending microwaves 
into the wood.
 
Tenting and fumigation — the most widespread control method — is toxic and 
dangerous, and apparently doesn’t work as well as its proponents claim.
Dry rot
Dry rot is a fungus that, despite its name, occurs in the presence of moisture. 
Why it’s called dry rot is anybody’s guess. It can spread through a deck like 
cancer, turning it to powder in seemingly no time at all. Many a homeowner 
has stepped through his deck one sunny Saturday afternoon. It’s easy to poke 
at your deck with an awl or screwdriver to find rotted portions, but the deck 
usually has concealed damage as well.
All the methods of keeping a deck dry to protect it from termites are also 
effective against dry rot, so start by eliminating sources of moisture. Remove 
leaves and junk from between deck boards, get those pots off the surface, 
and make sure the roof isn’t dumping water on the deck. If you have dry rot, 
remove and replace all the affected wood immediately.
 
Using pressure-treated wood is the best approach for preventing dry rot 
from coming back. People make claims for various toxic chemicals and 
sealants, but these products are dubious both environmentally and in terms 
of effectiveness.
Fungus with powers for good
An eccentric, utterly credible, and brilliant sci-
entist named Paul Stamets, up in the state of 
Washington, is working on a special fungus that 
poisons termites. Stamets claims that he can 
eradicate termites permanently at a cost of 
about $1 per treatment. Visit his Web site at 
www.fungi.com.

Other deck-care issues
 
Even if you don’t have any pests or pathogens dining on your deck, you do 
need to give it a little attention from time to time. Add these tasks to your 
deck-care checklist:
 
✓ Clean your deck periodically, using a pressure washer and a mild 
solution of biodegradable laundry soap.
 
✓ Follow up the cleaning with a light sanding of natural wood (not plastic 
or composite materials) and a sealer if you absolutely must (though 
sealers generally aren’t as effective as their makers claim).
 
✓ Use a biodegradable mildew remover as needed.
 
✓ Inspect the entire deck at least annually, looking for termites, dry rot, 
failing fasteners, soil contact, splinters, and broken or sagging wood.
Caring For Other Hardscape Elements
The caretaking chores that you put on your Saturday morning to-do list 
depend on the hardscape elements you include in your space. This section 
looks at some of the most common tasks to give you an idea of the required 
regular maintenance for various features of your hardscape.
Weeding pavers
Weeds come up in between pavers, especially ones with open joints that 
make them more pervious. Naturally, you’ll be tempted to spray the joints 
with herbicides, but instead, you can spray something quite innocent on 
young weeds to kill them.
 
The secret, believe it or not, is vinegar. I’m not talking about just any vinegar 
(although the grocery-store kind will kill very young weeds pretty well). I’m 
talking about horticultural vinegar. Horticultural vinegar is an ultrastrong 
version of the culinary kind; because of its potency and acidity, it needs to be 
handled with care. But it’s environmentally benign and knocks down many 
types of weeds if you get them when they’re young. Let them mature, and 
you’re looking at some time on your knees with a weeding tool. Your yard 
will smell like a salad for a couple of hours; otherwise, you won’t encounter 
any bad side effects. (Though you still should keep pets inside until the 
spray dries.) Note that as of this writing, horticultural vinegar is awaiting EPA 
approval for use as an herbicide.

229
 Chapter 15: Hardscape Maintenance
Sweeping and recompacting 
decomposed granite
Decomposed granite (also known as d.g.) is a compacted granular material 
that develops loose particles on the surface. For safety’s sake and to avoid 
tracking the particles into the house (where they can do a number on 
hardwood floors), it’s a good idea to sweep the particles off.
An alternative method is to recompact the surface periodically with a lawn 
roller filled with water or with a vibratory place compactor. This compactor 
is, as you might guess, a big vibrating metal plate, the sole purpose of which 
is to squash things flat. You walk behind one of these devices the way you 
walk behind a lawn mower.
Prevent water from running across d.g., because it can wash out little gulleys 
pretty quickly, especially if the material isn’t treated with a stabilizer. 
Loosen, regrade, and recompact d.g. if the surface gets too gnarly for safety.
Testing lighting systems
Check your lighting system now and then for burned-out bulbs, fixtures 
knocked off kilter by clumsy kids and flying newspapers, and funky wiring. 
Don’t forget to reset the timer (if you have one) twice a year when the 
time changes (unless you live in one of the few areas that doesn’t observe 
Daylight Saving Time). You can find more about hardscape lighting systems 
in Chapter 13.
Cleaning and maintaining drainage 
and erosion control features
 
One of the most important hardscape maintenance tasks is keeping storm 
water from doing harm. So before every rainy season, grit your teeth, get out 
your ladder, and clean the gutters. When you’re safely back on the ground, 
run a hose down your catch basins to dislodge any trash, rat carcasses, side-
winders, or small kids from the drain pipes. Check your surface drainage 
and make any corrections, remembering that the grades you carefully set up 
when you put in your landscaping may have changed due to intentional or 
accidental soil movement, sedimentation, settling, plant growth, trash 
buildup, or other causes. Look at erosion control blankets, wattles, check 
dams, and other erosion control structures to make sure they’re still in 
place and working properly. It sure is difficult to work on this stuff when it’s 
pouring rain.

230
Part IV: Hardscaping Made Easy 
Staying Safe: The Site Inspection
 
Landscaping slowly changes — without any help from you — in ways that 
sometimes result in the creation of new hazards. Develop the habit of keeping 
an eye on things from a safety perspective. Here are some items for your 
checklist:
 
✓ Trash: Look for debris piles that can attract vermin, create a fire hazard, 
or endanger children.
 
✓ Fire: Clear out dead or overgrown vegetation, low-hanging tree limbs, 
flammable fuels, and other materials that are just lying around.
 
✓ Trip hazards: Paving settles, sprinkler heads seem to emerge from the 
ground, and foliage hangs over walks — all these situations can create 
things to trip over. Make adjustments as needed.
 
✓ Tree safety: Leave this one to the pros. Get an annual inspection by a 
certified arborist, who will look for weak or broken limbs, heart rot, 
decay, and root problems that could cause part or all of the tree to fall 
onto structures, power lines, or people.
 
✓ Plumbing problems: Look for leaks, runoff that could make sidewalks 
slippery, sprinkler heads sticking up where someone could trip over 
them, and loose drip tubing. Have your backflow prevention device 
checked annually, as required by law, by a licensed backflow test 
technician. (Call your county health department for a list of names.) 
Turn to Chapter 10 for full coverage of irrigation system maintenance.
 
✓ Play equipment and child safety: Check for loose or protruding fasten-
ers, sharp edges, broken parts, splinters, cracks, and peeling paint. 
Clear the area of beehives, animal feces, broken glass, and thorny 
or toxic plants. Also make sure that self-latching gates are working 
properly, especially around pools and ponds.

T
he sustainable landscape is a living system that’s 
dependent on plants and all the other elements of a 
living ecology. Plants don’t just look pretty; they also do 
stuff that actually matters, like making food, preventing 
erosion, reducing energy demand inside your house, 
attracting beneficial insects, and a whole lot more. Of 
course they’re pretty too, aren’t they? There’s nothing 
unsustainable about that!
This part shows you how to use plants effectively, create 
beautiful plantings that demand little upkeep, and even 
design a lawn that requires very infrequent mowing and 
watering. You see how to care for your soil and the life 
within it. You also discover how to buy good plants 
(including trees and shrubs), how to plant them, and how 
to care for them using the most sustainable approaches, 
new and ancient. The basics of organic pest, disease, and 
weed control are in this part too.

Because so much of the wasted effort and materials in the landscape result 
from poor planting choices, discovering how to use plants properly will 
greatly improve the environmental performance of your project and will also 
save you lots of trouble over the years.
Making Sustainable Plant Choices
If you pick plants well and combine them skillfully (two of the most important 
sustainability concepts), they’ll be an asset and a delight for decades and 
even centuries. Choose poorly, and they’ll torment you forever, growing 
too large, becoming invasive or hazardous, or suffering from poor growing 
conditions. So give the selection of trees, shrubs, and smaller plants your 
utmost attention. The following sections detail some practical matters to 
be aware of. (Check out Chapters 5 and 6 for plant, tree, and shrub design 
considerations.)

Discovering which plants 
are sustainable and why
 
A number of factors make any given plant sustainable in a particular applica-
tion and setting. A plant that’s sustainable in one place would be dreadful in 
another. Here are some general guidelines to consider when choosing plants 
sustainably:
 
✓ Learn all you can about each location on your property, and match 
plants carefully to the light, soil conditions, and other factors.
 
✓ Choose plants that are adapted to your climate.
 
✓ Pick long-lived plants so you don’t have to replace them often.
 
✓ Choose plants that are resistant to pests and diseases. Often one 
cultivar will do better than another in your area.
 
✓ Where appropriate, emphasize local native plants because they’ve had 
millions of years to adapt to local conditions. But realize that many 
exotic plants from similar climates will be just as successful as natives.
 
✓ Avoid invasive or troublesome species. There are often official lists of 
problematic exotic plants in your area; take these seriously.
 
✓ Consider the need for inputs like water and fertilizer. Tough plants don’t 
need much of either.
 
✓ Screen your prospective plants for drawbacks, such as susceptibility to 
wind, high flammability, and thorns to name a few. Avoid trees that may 
crack your pavement with their extensive root systems, drop sap or 
seeds, or poison the neighborhood kids.
Loading up on plant information
Information on plants is everywhere. Because gardening is one of the most 
popular leisure-time activities, ample advice is just waiting for you to find it. 
However, as with most things, some of that advice is bad, so choose well-
established sources. The following are some great ways to learn about plants:
 
✓ Look at mature specimens. Visit real plants in real places, not in pots at 
the nursery where they all look pretty much the same and there’s no 
hint that one plant will grow to 100 feet tall while another will stay a foot 
or so.
 
 Botanic gardens offer mature plantings in well thought-out combina-
tions, with good labels and lots of chipper staff to answer your 
questions. Public parks often contain a remarkable variety of species 
as well. Walk around neighborhoods, especially your own, to see 
which plants are doing well. Go on garden tours.

235
 Chapter 16: Planting the Seed: Sustainable Plant Basics
 
✓ Seek out gardening books that address your region. Nothing is quite 
like a good plant encyclopedia to get you up to speed on an unfamiliar 
species.
 
✓ Take advantage of the Internet. Many wholesale growers and retail 
nurseries have great Web sites. So may the cooperative extension 
service or ornamental horticulture department of your state university. 
Search for the scientific name of a plant.
 
✓ Be sociable. Gardeners love to talk. Strike up conversations in nurseries 
and at public gardens, or pester people working in their front yards. Tap 
the (free!) wisdom that’s all around you.
Size does matter: Giving 
plants room to grow
Plants aren’t just pretty things to put around the yard; they’re living organ-
isms with their own way of getting along in the world. They have a very 
specific destiny — a set of genetic instructions that determine their height, 
width, growth rate, and many other characteristics. Plants are indifferent to 
your needs. This concept is difficult for a plant lover to accept, but it’s true. 
Plants don’t give a hoot about you and your landscaping. Sorry.
This means that your job as a landscaper is to figure out what plants need 
and then make sure they get it. Suppose you put a 20-foot wide shrub where 
you want a 4-foot one. The shrub, in its blissful ignorance, will keep trying to 
grow to 20 feet wide, and you’ll have to keep cutting it back. A plant can’t be 
trained as if it were a dog, and your relationship with that plant will go on 
unchanged, with much labor on your part, until you finally take it out and put 
in something that grows to the proper size.
The implications of not giving plants room to grow are many:
 
✓ You work harder, finding yourself in a constant battle with your yard. 
The battle gets bloodier the more oversized plants you have.
 
✓ The plants suffer from the abuse necessary to keep them in bounds. 
They look cut-back rather than natural, and some may never flower.
 
✓ Your green waste container is always full of clippings. Green waste is 
the plant parts you remove in the course of pruning work.
 
✓ Pruning is bothersome and wastes energy. The energy use and noise 
from using power tools and hauling clippings away is bad news.
I call this strategy adversarial horticulture, and believe me, it’s an epidemic. In 
some gardens, 80 percent of the work consists of cutting plants back all the 
time. It’s unnecessary and is a sign of terrible, unsustainable planning.

236
Part V: Great Greenery for a Green Garden 
The remedy, of course, is simple. Believe the gardening books when they list 
sizes. Choose plants that grow to the size you want for any given application. 
Then enjoy watching the garden develop into a graceful state of equilibrium, 
getting easier to live with rather than harder.
Starting off on the right root: 
Choosing healthy plants
Suppose you had to choose between three plants at the nursery — all the 
same variety and all in the same sized containers. One is huge and in luscious 
bloom, the second is mid-sized, and the third hasn’t even grown out to the 
edges of the pot. Which would you pick?
Most people would pick the first one, thinking it was the better deal because 
it was already fully grown. That would be the very worst choice in most 
cases, because it’s probably root-bound. Roots that circle in the pot, as they 
do when confined for too long, continue to circle in the ground and never 
grow out into the soil. The plant that looked so great at the nursery will 
slowly decline, and when you pull it out after a couple of years, you’ll find 
little or no root development.
 
The best choice in most cases would be the mid-size plant. If you were to 
carefully remove such a plant from its container, you’d find roots that are just 
beginning to emerge from the root ball and touch the sides of the container. 
The soil would be solidly knitted together with no circling roots, and it 
wouldn’t fall apart as would a younger plant.
Here are a few other things to keep an eye out for:
 
✓ Look at the crown of the plant, which is where the stem enters the soil. 
You shouldn’t see any circling roots there either.
 
✓ Beware of plants with roots growing out of the drainage holes in the 
bottom of the pot; those guys belong on the compost heap.
 
✓ Check the above-ground parts of the plant, looking for good structure. 
You don’t want any broken, crossing, or rubbing branches, and the 
overall shape of the plant should be roughly symmetrical in most cases. 
Look for an abundance of growth buds, indicating vigor.
 
✓ Be sure no pests or diseases are evident, and watch for yellowing of the 
tissue between the veins or any other abnormal coloration that may 
indicate nutrient deficiencies or other problems.
 
Of course every plant is different, so these are only very general rules. Don’t 
assume that every plant offered for sale is in good condition. Check each one 
carefully.

237
 Chapter 16: Planting the Seed: Sustainable Plant Basics
Selecting plants that naturally 
thrive in your area
Choose varieties that are strong and well adapted to your growing condi-
tions. Some species (and even entire genera) of plants are going to be 
weaklings, either because they’re so far out of their element in your climate 
that they can’t possibly thrive or because they’ve been hybridized for 
appearance at the expense of performance.
 
Make sure the backbone plants in your yard are survivors. Walk your neigh-
borhood to see what does well and talk to local nursery staff and others 
who really know plants. Don’t give yourself an uphill battle by choosing plants 
that will never thrive. That’s not sustainable; it’s just pointless.
Getting to know the natives
Natives are plants that have evolved in place and, in the case of North 
America and other colonized areas of the world, were present prior to 
European settlement. They weren’t introduced or dispersed by humans; 
they developed on their own.
A native species doesn’t exist in a vacuum; it’s part of a plant community of 
interconnected species that have all grown up together. In turn, the plant 
community is part of a larger, highly complex ecosystem made up of plants, 
animals, insects, bacteria, fungi, bodies of water, soil, and even weather 
patterns and other nonmaterial influences. Native plants are highly adapted 
to local conditions, so much so that they often grow in a very specific part 
of the local ecosystem, such as a wet spot or on a sunny slope.
Because of their specificity to a particular environment, native plants may 
be touchy about being moved to different environments. They thrive under 
proper conditions with little or no supplemental watering, fertilization, 
or other special treatment. This is important in developing a sustainable 
landscape because sustainability is all about minimizing inputs.
The constant destruction of ecosystems today makes it important to restore 
as much as possible. Therefore, using natives in a landscape setting will help 
bring things back into balance. Native plants provide food for native animals 
and insects, so inviting those plants into your garden will benefit many 
species. In fact, an all-native garden can be an excellent option. Well-placed 
natives will make gardening much easier than using ill-adapted nonnative 
(aka exotic) plants.
 
On the other hand, in an urban or suburban area, feel free to mix in well-
adapted plants from regions with climates similar to yours. They can add 
diversity and interest to the plant community you’re creating. Exotics are 
also handy for filling niches that native plants can’t tolerate. Don’t forget 
that most of our food plants aren’t native, and yet they deserve a place in our 
sustainable gardens.

Working with native plants
If you’re considering natives, do your research first. Visit a local botanic 
garden that features natives, take a class in native plants, read up on natives, 
or join a native plant society. Above all else, spend time in truly wild places 
in your region to understand what a native plant community is, what makes it 
tick, what plants are associated with one another, and whether these plants 
are really something you want on your property.
After you’ve done your homework, check to be sure that the conditions on 
your property are right for the plants you’re considering. Soils, exposure, 
water, and other elements often have to be just so, and not all sites are 
suitable for natives. If you aren’t sure how to proceed, consult with a profes-
sional who specializes in native landscaping.
When you plant natives, do so in the proper season (which is often fall, but 
it varies depending on location), and be careful to avoid fertilizers, soil 
amendments, and other modifications unless you know that the plants you’ve 
chosen really need them. During the establishment period, keep an eye on 
watering and other care, because even native plants need a little babying 
when they’re pups. Over the long haul, avoid killing your natives with kind-
ness, keeping in mind that they’re quite happy with what nature delivers.
Myths about native plants
Some folks have peculiar notions about native 
plants. Here are some of them:
 ✓ Natives require zero maintenance. This 
notion may be true in some cases, espe-
cially if you’re okay with the unkempt 
appearance of wild places. Natural ecosys-
tems depend on dead plant material, thick-
ets, and fallen leaves to provide cover, food, 
nesting materials, and other necessities for 
the native wildlife. Your garden can do the 
same. But if you want your property to look 
a little more respectable, be prepared to 
groom those natives a bit. And of course, 
dead stuff can attract undesirable critters 
and become a fire hazard.
 ✓ Natives never get pests or diseases. Native 
plants have their own complement of native 
insects and ills. The difference is that in 
most cases beneficial insects and other 
natural controls keep problems in check.
 ✓ All natives are drought tolerant. Consider a 
plant that’s native to a local wetland. It’s 
certainly not drought tolerant, so don’t put it 
in an area that can’t meet its considerable 
need for water. If you’re concerned 
about saving water, pick drought-tolerant 
species, whether native or not.
 ✓ Natives are easier/harder to grow than 
other plants. Growing difficulty depends on 
the plant and how well suited it is to where 
you place it. Plants that are out of place 
suffer and are difficult to live with; this is 
especially true of natives. But put a 
native where it wants to be and chances 
are you’ll have a happy, easy-care plant for 
a long time.

239
 Chapter 16: Planting the Seed: Sustainable Plant Basics
 
If you live near wild land, be careful about introducing natives that aren’t 
present in the immediately local plant community. If your plants are geneti-
cally similar to the truly local natives, they can hybridize with the locals and 
cause genetic pollution.
 
Never dig plants from wild places, even on private property, unless you’re 
sure you aren’t disrupting a native ecosystem or if you’re saving the plants 
from approaching bulldozers. Buy from reputable growers who can guarantee 
that they aren’t dug in the wild.
Avoiding invasive plants
Some plants are so nasty that they should never show up in your garden. A 
particular species may be just fine in its native habitat (where competition, 
browsing animals, or insects keep it under control), but taken elsewhere, 
it runs everything else out of town. Every location has its outlaws, and you 
may already know (and curse) the names of your local botanical hoodlums. 
People have been moving plants around the globe for centuries, and even 
though most introductions are benign, quite a few have made a mess of 
things. They out-compete native plants, increase fire danger, destabilize 
slopes, ruin the habitat for indigenous animals, and more.
Look to your local native plant society, botanic garden, or university or visit 
www.usna.usda.gov/Gardens/invasives.html for information on 
troublesome plants in your area.
 
Some invasive species are still sold at nurseries. Just because you see a plant 
for sale doesn’t mean that it behaves itself. Know which species are invasive 
and never plant them, no matter how cute they look in the container.
Developing a plant palette
A plant palette is a list of plants that might be suitable for your project. 
You’ll pick from the palette to develop your planting design, narrowing down 
the list to the most compatible and desirable varieties. For now, this is an 
opportunity to expand your awareness of plants that will work for you and 
for the environment. Here’s how to develop a plant palette:
 
1. Begin investigating the possibilities for your plant palette.
 
 Make a menu of choices that fits your criteria for each spot in the land-
scape. Start with plants you know and like. List them by type of plant 
(perennial, shrub, tree, and so on), by size, by potential location in the 
landscape (shade tree for the back patio, ground cover for the back 
slope), or whatever other considerations are important to you. Make the 
same kind of list for each type of plant that you need.

240
Part V: Great Greenery for a Green Garden 
 
2. Go visit the plants.
 
 Visit places that have full-size plants. Go where you can see how plants 
behave, how big they get, how they smell, and everything else about 
them. See “Loading up on plant information” earlier in this chapter for 
more details.
 
 Ultimate size is one of the most important considerations when viewing 
plants. When you see a mature plant, you can really understand its 
ultimate size.
3. Prioritize your list.
 
 While all the plants are fresh in your mind, make little happy faces by 
your strong favorites, and cross out ones that just don’t fit for whatever 
reason (wrong size, wrong color, spouse hates it, or whatever).
You won’t be able to use all the plants you’ve listed on your plant palette, 
and for reasons of good design you’ll want to select a reasonable number of 
varieties for the final design. You’ll need to pare down your list in order to 
develop a final design.
Here are some tips for narrowing down your plant palette:
 
✓ Choose compatible colors, textures, and forms. Use the design skills I 
provide in Chapter 5 to pick combinations of plants that work well 
together visually. Sure, sustainability is about how things work, but it’s 
also about how things look.
 
✓ Select plants based on their watering needs. Choose plants that you 
can group together according to water need — into hydrozones. Place 
medium water-use plants together in one area, low water-use plants in 
another, and so on. Then develop your irrigation system so that each 
hydrozone has its own separately-valved system that can be controlled 
independently of the others. This way you’re sure that you aren’t 
drowning your drought-tolerant plants in order to give the higher water-
use ones the water they need, or vice versa. (Chapter 9 provides more 
information on water management.)
 
✓ Only keep those plants that fit the spaces you have. If you give plants 
room to grow you’ll be about 40 percent of the way toward a sustainable 
landscape — even if you do everything else wrong. Why? Because so 
much effort, time, energy, and money are spent cutting back plants that 
have grown too big for the space they’re in. Pruning to control size is a 
sign of design failure. By checking the ultimate size of all your plants at 
the design stage, you’ll be nipping this problem in the bud. Refer to the 
earlier section “Size does matter: Giving plants room to grow” for more 
on choosing plants based on their sizes.

241
 Chapter 16: Planting the Seed: Sustainable Plant Basics
 
✓ Eliminate problem plants. Do not for one minute believe that your 
plants will be free of the shortcomings described in the gardening 
books. Your ivy will creep under the siding of your house just the same 
as anybody else’s. Ivy doesn’t know that you’re special. So, ruthlessly 
remove problem plants from your palette. There may be no bad dogs, 
but I’m here to tell you that there are definitely some very bad plants. 
Each region has its own collection of them, and gardeners will know 
what they are. Ask, and then act accordingly.
The Secret’s in the Soil
Dirt is the stuff you wash off your clothes. Soil is the living layer of minerals, 
organic matter, air, and microorganisms that makes up the root zone of your 
yard. Surprisingly, about 50 percent of a healthy topsoil is air; most of the 
other half is made of minerals, with only about 5 percent organic matter, 
such as decaying leaves, roots, and other former and current plant parts.
Microorganisms also are an immensely important element of living soil. The 
billions of beneficial bacteria, fungi, insects, and other critters that live in just 
a handful of soil are responsible for the health of both the soil and the plants. 
Protecting and nurturing these microorganisms turns out to be one of the 
most essential tasks of sustainable landscaping. Nothing is better than vital, 
living soil to make plants grow well.
Soils are divided into three main categories:
 
✓ Clay soil: Clay soils, which gardeners usually detest, are composed of 
very fine particles. They’re often sticky and difficult to work with, and 
they retain water for long periods of time. These soils tend to be fertile, 
but sometimes they can have trouble releasing nutrients to the plants. 
Clay soil isn’t the end of the world, but it requires special consideration.
 
✓ Sandy soil: Sandy soils are made up of relatively large particles, and 
they have trouble holding water and nutrients. As with clay soils, if you 
have sandy soils, it’s best to pick plants that are adapted to them 
rather than committing yourself to a lifetime of constant watering and 
fertilization.
 
✓ Loam soil: Loam soils are just right. They’re a mixture of clay, sand, 
and organic matter, among other things. If your soil is loamy, you’re a 
very lucky gardener because you get the best of both worlds — good 
drainage and water holding capacity, decent fertility, and no particular 
problems. You can plant almost anything you want.

242
Part V: Great Greenery for a Green Garden 
 
To determine your soil texture, moisten a small handful of soil (not too wet, 
please) and make a wiener-shaped gob. Close your hand around it, and 
squeeze it out between your thumb and index finger. Pay attention to the feel 
of it, and to how long a ribbon you can get to extend into the air before it 
breaks off. Then use the following descriptions to determine what type of soil 
you have:
 
✓ Clay: Eeew! This type of soil is all sticky and slippery and gooey! It 
makes a piece in the air at least 1 to 2 inches long.
 
✓ Clay loam: This soil is kind of sticky, but the air piece will be an inch or 
so long.
 
✓ Sandy loam: The sand makes this soil feel somewhat gritty; the clay and 
silt make it feel a little gooey. It hangs together but won’t form a ribbon 
in the air like the clay soils.
 
✓ Sandy: This type of soil is loose and gritty; not at all sticky. It would 
never form a ribbon. Instead, it just falls apart.
Soil management myths 
and misunderstandings
First of all, there are no “bad” soils other than those contaminated by human 
activity. Soils are classified by texture — whether they’re sandy, loam, or 
clay (with some variations on those themes). Plants grow in all kinds of 
soils, but most growers consider loam ideal. So what if yours happens to be 
sand or clay? Should you try to convert it to a loam? The answer is no; 
most attempts at changing soil are about as successful as getting your chain-
smoking uncle to give up cigarettes.
Myth 1: You need to improve your soil with amendments
One of the persistent myths of gardening is that you need to “improve” soil 
by adding organic matter (soil amendment). This practice actually makes the 
situation worse in most cases because it reduces water holding capacity and 
fertility (unless your soil is very sandy), makes the soil dry out faster, and 
attracts rainwater, causing the plants to drown.
The only proper way to add amendments is if you incorporate them into the 
entire root zone of the mature plant, which isn’t very practical except in the 
case of very small plants. Even then, amendments seem to do more harm 
than good in most cases. You do need to add a good living mix of organic 
nutrients and beneficial soil microorganisms, especially mycorrhizal fungus. 
(See the nearby sidebar “Mike O’Who???”) These microorganisms are applied 
in small quantities as inoculums that will boost the living element in the soil.

243
 Chapter 16: Planting the Seed: Sustainable Plant Basics
 
The sustainable strategy for dealing with less than desirable soil is to pick 
plants that like the soil you have. This approach reduces maintenance and 
improves performance.
Myth 2: Soil polymers help you save water
Another myth is that magical soil polymers (chemical soil additives) help you 
save water. This isn’t necessarily true. Polymers have been proven to be inef-
fective much of the time and can actually be harmful in some situations.
 
No polymer (or anything else for that matter) can change the inherent water 
requirements of a plant any more than adding something to your gas will 
boost the mileage of your car. In theory polymers hold water, releasing it to 
the plants when they need it. Nice idea, but they often don’t let go of that 
water, so it’s unavailable to your plants. Plus, the effectiveness of polymers is 
often compromised by fertilization and other changes in the soil. They don’t 
last very long either, and some of them are made from wicked chemicals.
Myth 3: Clay soils can be “fixed”
You can add gypsum to clay soils to help break them up, but that’s only 
effective if the soil has a high sodium content. So have your soil tested first. 
Sand added to clay can turn it to concrete, but if you use at least 30 percent 
sand by volume you can successfully lighten some clay soils. Adding organic 
matter to clay soils provides no long-term benefit. Maintaining a cover of 
mulch might help over years or decades, but it won’t do you any good in the 
short term. The best way to handle clay soils is to choose plants that tolerate 
it. Gardening books don’t typically list clay-tolerant plants, so look around 
your neighborhood to see what’s doing well.
The soil food web: Bringing life to your soil
Sustainable gardeners talk about soil not just as a physical and chemical 
medium but as a living soil food web: beneficial fungi, bacteria, earthworms, 
insects, and other organisms that partner up with plants to make them 
thrive. All these critters build soil structure and work to retain nutrients and 
convert them into forms plants can use. Without life in the soil, plants barely 
survive. Check out Figure 16-1 for a visual.
 
Your job as the sustainable gardener is to create the conditions for the soil 
food web to thrive. You also must reinoculate damaged soils with the life 
they need. Do this by incorporating living compost, mycorrhizal fungus, benefi-
cial soil bacteria, and humic acids into the soil at planting time. How? Look for 
a good organic fertilizer that lists these elements on the label. Any good nurs-
ery carries at least one brand. Also recognize that common activities such as 
grading, fertilizing with chemicals, and using herbicides and pesticides have 
a toxic effect on soil organisms, so use them sparingly (if at all).

Soil testing: Chemistry versus biology
In order to grow plants successfully, you need to know what kind of soil 
you’re working with. The best way to do this is by sending a sample of your 
soil into a lab for a landscape suitability analysis (LSA). Like a blood test, 
the LSA tells you a lot about the chemistry of your soil: pH (whether it’s 
acid [technically anything with lots of hydrogen ions and a pH below 7.0] or 
alkaline [low in hydrogen ions and with a pH above 7.0]), nutrient content, 
salinity, and a number of other factors.
In some states, the agriculture department or cooperative extension service 
does soil testing; in other places you have to use a private lab. Take a sample 
of soil from where the roots will grow; anything between 6 inches and 12 
inches deep is usually adequate. Mail it to the lab, and in a week or so you get 
back a complete readout of your soil and specific treatment recommenda-
tions. Ask the lab for organic recommendations rather than chemical ones, 
since you won’t be using chemical fertilizers.

245
 Chapter 16: Planting the Seed: Sustainable Plant Basics
An LSA doesn’t tell you anything about the condition of the soil food web. For 
that, you need another set of tests done by special labs that focus on biology 
rather than chemistry. Unless you have a special problem, the addition of a 
good organic fertilizer should jump-start your soil’s living element without 
the expense of biological testing.
The LSA also doesn’t tell you anything about the presence of toxic sub-
stances. If you suspect that pollutants are causing problems, talk to your lab 
about ways to test specifically for them.
Diagnosing internal soil drainage
Dig a hole a foot deep and a foot wide and fill it with water. Come back in a 
few hours. If the hole is still full of water, your soil has an internal drainage 
problem. Choose plants that are okay with wet feet (many gardening books 
provide lists of plants suited to poorly drained soils).
 
If you must grow plants that want good drainage, take steps to improve it: Dig 
a deep posthole to punch through the clay layer (if that’s the problem) and 
fill it with gravel so that water drains out, or run drain pipes underground to 
draw water away from the area. You can also plant on mounds or in raised 
beds, ignoring the bad drainage altogether.
Fertilizers 101: Opting for organic
Plants need macronutrients (nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium, which 
most plants use in large quantities), secondary nutrients (calcium, magnesium, 
and sulfur) and micronutrients (iron, magnesium, zinc, boron, and others). 
Soils vary in their natural fertility, so you may need to add nutrients if your 
Mike O’Who???
Most people think of fungi as bad things that eat 
your plants or cause athlete’s foot. But not all 
fungi are bad, and mycorrhizal fungus is among 
the best. It attaches to the roots of many kinds 
of plants and acts as a souped-up accessory 
root system to greatly increase the uptake of 
nutrients and water, improving the health of 
plants and reducing the need for supplemental 
feeding and watering. Though mycorrhizae 
occur naturally in most soils, grading, chemical 
fertilizers, and pesticides can destroy them. The 
good news is that you can easily reintroduce 
them by using fertilizers that contain them or by 
adding them in granular or liquid form either at 
planting time or in the established landscape. 
They make a huge difference in your garden.

246
Part V: Great Greenery for a Green Garden 
plants need more than what your soil has to give. Nutrient deficiencies 
lead to slow growth, increased susceptibility to pests and diseases, and 
symptoms such as chlorosis (yellowing of leaf tissue).
Organic fertilizers come from plant and animal sources such as manure, kelp, 
blood, feathers, cottonseed, and alfalfa; they nourish the soil food web. 
Chemical fertilizers are made from fossil fuels and mineral salts; they deplete 
nonrenewable resources, kill the life in the soil, burn plants if applied too 
generously, and leach into ground and surface water.
 
Organic fertilizers are better for plants and soil because they’re gentler, 
slower-acting, come from natural renewable sources, are low in salt content, 
don’t leach into groundwater, and work in harmony with microorganisms to 
improve the soil. In fact, organic fertilizers need soil organisms to convert 
their nutrients to forms your plants can use.
The occasional (2 or 3 times per year) application of a good-quality organic 
fertilizer is adequate for most kinds of plants. Fertilize plants with special 
needs (such as acid-loving species or fruit trees) with specially-formulated 
organic fertilizers.
Break It Down: Composting Plant Tissue
Compost is the other end of the cycle of birth and death: it’s plant tissue 
broken down by natural forces into nutrients that other plants need to 
grow. Compost returns nutrients to the system in their most natural form, 
improves soil structure, stabilizes soil chemistry, makes plants more 
drought tolerant, nourishes beneficial soil microorganisms, suppresses 
diseases, neutralizes contaminants, increases soil permeability, and reduces 
runoff. Compost is essential, sustainable, and beautiful.
Reasons to compost (and reasons not to)
The sustainable landscape is cyclical, not linear; nothing goes to waste in a 
sustainable system. Nowhere is this truer than in the dance between living 
plants and compost. You have the opportunity to take part in one of the 
great cycles of life, and the payoff for you is healthier plants, lower fertilizer 
bills, richer soil, and less green waste being hauled away by noisy diesel-
spewing trucks. This benefit is reason enough to compost, but when you 
finally harvest your finished compost and run the silky, fragrant stuff through 
your hands, you finally understand what it means to be a truly sustainable 
gardener.

247
 Chapter 16: Planting the Seed: Sustainable Plant Basics
Some circumstances may make composting impractical or unnecessary. One 
is lack of space for a compost pile, but that’s a pretty lame excuse since some 
compost containers take up a tiny 2 x 2 foot area. You can even use worm 
composters in the kitchen. A more legit reason to not have a composting 
system is that your landscaping doesn’t generate enough green waste to 
supply it. That can happen if you’ve done a bang-up job of choosing the right 
plants; then nothing really ever needs to be cut back.
 
Small quantities of clippings should be cut up and left as an offering at the 
base of the plant they came from. This practice is called the chop and drop 
method, and it can absorb virtually all the plant parts in a well-balanced 
garden. (Flip to Chapter 20 for more on this method.)
Fancy-pants composting technology 
and the supplies you really need
You don’t really need much technology to be a gardener, and composting is 
no exception. An old-fashioned compost pile works fine, as it has for eons. 
You simply find a suitable spot and heap up some stuff, using the simple 
formula in the next section. Then cover the pile to keep the heat in. Turn it 
now and then if you want it to break down faster (see Figure 16-2). Squirt 
some water on it every week or so. Harvest ripe compost. That’s it.
 
If you must buy composting bin, look for a simple bin made of recycled plastic 
(Figure 16-2 also shows an upright compost bin). The bigger the better; piles 
around 3 x 3 feet heat up better than smaller ones. Throw plant parts in the 
top and periodically pull finished compost out the little door in the bottom. 
No muss, no fuss, no turning. Or get a tumbler-type bin and give it a spin once 
in a while. You can also build a series of bins out of concrete block, scrap 
wood, or other sturdy material for the dividers. You want to turn the compost 
in a bin system; a concrete floor makes that easier.

Composting step by step
Composting is simple. Even though you find many subtleties and various 
approaches, getting things to rot isn’t really that mysterious. Follow these 
simple steps and you’re on your way:
 
1. Make a pile of the right stuff — half green, half brown.
 
 Gather up some green stuff and some brown stuff. They can be lawn 
clippings (green) and dry leaves (brown), freshly cut hedge clippings 
and wood chips, or any similar mixture of materials. The greens 
supply the nitrogen and the browns kick down the carbon. The right 
combination, which turns out to be about half of each, makes for a 
good, hot pile that breaks down quickly. Using too much green material 
makes the pile stinky, and using too much brown material slows the 
activity in the pile to a crawl. The more you chop up the material, the 
faster it composts. Using food scraps is okay if you cover them with 
leaves or shredded paper to keep the flies out; meat and other animal 
parts attract vermin and are best left out. For sure don’t add dog or cat 
poo; they can harbor wicked diseases.
 
 Don’t waste your money on “compost starters” or other gimmicks that 
purport to make the process happen faster. The heavy lifting in the 
composting process is accomplished by a crack team of bacteria, fungi, 
enzymes, and earthworms; most of them are present in the material you 
feed into the pile. If you want to speed the process, add a few handfuls 
of topsoil, manure, finished compost, fireplace ashes, bloodmeal, or 
bonemeal.
 
2. Add water to your pile.
 
 Once a week, soak the pile down until it’s moist but not saturated. Cover 
the pile with a tarp or close the lid on the composter to keep the heat 
and moisture in.
 
3. Turn the pile weekly.
 
 Turning with a pitchfork speeds up the decomposition process.
 
4. Harvest your compost when it’s dark brown, looks kind of like coffee 
grounds, and has a wonderful sweet/earthy fragrance.
 
 You can screen it to sift out any coarse pieces or just use it as is.
 
5. Use your compost at your next planting.
 
 Dig a handful of compost into the soil when planting a new plant 
(you don’t need much). Spread it on the surface of planter beds as a 
combination mulch and fertilizer (the nutrients leach into the soil during 
overhead watering or when it rains). Incorporate it into potting soil.

249
 Chapter 16: Planting the Seed: Sustainable Plant Basics
Solving compost nuisances and problems
If you follow the recommendations in the previous sections, you shouldn’t 
have any trouble with composting. But if things go sideways on you, here are 
some tips:
 
✓ It stinks! You have too much green stuff or water in your mix. Turn the 
pile and add some browns.
 
✓ It’s too cold! Make your pile bigger, water it, turn it, or add some greens. 
Insulate the pile with straw if air temperature is low.
 
✓ It’s too hot! The pile is supposed to be quite hot, especially during the 
early stages. But a pile that’s too big or not well ventilated can overheat, 
killing the microorganisms that are there to help. Turn the pile and 
divide it if necessary to reduce the size.
 
✓ It’s overrun with critters! No meat in the pile, okay? It attracts raccoons, 
skunks, rats, and other meat-eaters. And cover those kitchen scraps, 
which attract fruit flies. If you see a large furry paw rising up out of the 
pile, run like crazy.
Giving a New Plant a Good Home: 
Planting Basics
No matter what you’re planting, what you do when you put it in the ground 
can affect the well-being of the plant for its entire life. Digging a hole and 
shoving a plant into it is only the beginning. As with many aspects of horticul-
ture, some of the common knowledge about planting is wrong. Here’s how to 
do it right, step by step (check out Figure 16-3):
 
1. Dig the hole.
 
 Plants like to be planted a little high, so make your hole about 1 inch 
shallower than the depth of the root ball (2 inches shallower for larger 
plants) and twice as wide as the root ball. Don’t overexcavate and then 
refill the bottom of the hole with loose soil; put your plant directly on 
undisturbed soil. Beat up the sides of the hole so the roots can get out 
into the surrounding soil; a smooth-sided hole creates circling roots. If 
you’re planting on a slope, make the hole perpendicular to the face of 
the slope, as shown in Figure 16-3; this technique prevents upslope soil 
from collapsing onto the plant.
2. Prepare the backfill soil (soil that will fill the hole).
 
 Refer to the soils section earlier in this chapter for information on 
amending and improving soils. Add any appropriate materials as 

250
Part V: Great Greenery for a Green Garden 
necessary and gently mix them in, being careful not to overwork the 
soil and destroy its structure. In most cases, you don’t need to add soil 
amendments other than perhaps a bit of compost.
 
3. Remove the plant from its container.
 
 For plants in nursery pots, turn the plant upside down, holding the soil 
in place with your hand. Give the rim a downward tap; the plant should 
slide out of the pot. For larger containers, place the plant on its side and 
gently pull it from the pot. Cut the container off if necessary, but don’t 
break the root ball. Place balled and burlapped plants (plants wrapped 
in burlap instead of being in a pot) in the hole and then uncover the top 
half of the root ball, allowing the burlap to remain in the soil, where it 
eventually decomposes.
 
4. Examine the root ball.
 
 If the plant has circling roots, gently dislodge them and spread them out. 
For a normal root ball with roots just touching the outside, no action 
is necessary, though you can stimulate root development by lightly 
scratching the ball with your hands. Discard or return any plant that’s 
seriously root bound, with many circling roots; it will never succeed.
 
5. Put the plant into the hole.
 
 Check the depth, remembering to plant a little bit high. Center the plant 
in the hole. For bare root plants, spread the roots out on a cone of 
soil you’ve made in the center of the hole. Place the backfill soil about 
halfway up the root ball and gently compact it to eliminate any air 
pockets. Add some water to soak the backfill soil. Backfill and compact 
more soil the rest of the way to the surface, and use the remaining soil 
to make a small, temporary basin around the plant so you can flood it 
with water a few times.
 
6. Apply mulch.
 
 Place mulch around the plant as shown in the illustration. See the later 
section “Mulching: The Sustainable Garden Miracle” for information on 
the benefits of mulch.
Even the toughest plants need babying when they’re first planted. Pay close 
attention to watering, keeping the soil (especially the root ball) constantly 
moist but not soggy. Poke a finger into the soil to test for moisture. As the 
plants mature, water longer and less frequently, because the root system will 
be more extensive.
 
Don’t try to hurry plants along with strong doses of fertilizer; allow them to 
develop in their own time. Watch for pests and diseases, and take action 
immediately, knowing that young plants have few reserves to protect them. 
Maintain a good cover of mulch to keep moisture in and weeds down. Finally, 
get after those weeds pronto, because they can outcompete your plants 
quickly.

Mulching: The Sustainable 
Garden Miracle
Back in the old, unsustainable days, everyone used to rake up the leaf litter 
from flower beds and lawns and cast it into the trash, leaving soil exposed to 
sun, wind, rain, and footfall. It sounded good at the time — keep the place tidy, 
avoid harboring pests and diseases, get your property looking all suburban and 
respectable, and let the magic truck take the bad stuff out of your life forever.
“Good” homeowners acted that way, and many still do. Just one problem: 
The castoffs weren’t litter, and there was no “away.” What people were really 
doing was squandering precious nutrients, water, and fossil fuels; causing 
pollution; harming their plants; supporting a destructive chemical fertilizer 
industry; increasing weed and pest problems; destroying their soil; and 
short-circuiting one of the handiest nutrient loops in the garden system.

252
Part V: Great Greenery for a Green Garden 
Modern sustainable landscapers know better. They treat every molecule 
of organic matter with the utmost care, knowing that it’s essential to the 
long-term health of their personal ecosystems. That’s where mulch comes in. 
Mulch is a blanket of organic (or sometimes inorganic) material that sits on 
the surface of the soil. (It’s not the same as soil amendment, which you dig 
into the soil.)
 
Mulch serves many functions in the landscape system, as the following 
sections show. If I had to pick the top two or three most essential elements in 
the sustainable landscape, mulch would surely be one.
Mulch ado about mulch: 
Benefits of mulching
Mulch is an expert at stacking functions (multitasking). Here are a few ways 
that mulch benefits your sustainable landscape:
 
✓ Saves water: A couple of inches of mulch can cut your water use by at 
least half and greatly increase the intervals between waterings. Note 
that mulch must be coarser-textured than the soil beneath it in order to 
get the full water-saving benefits.
 
✓ Reduces plant stress: Mulch insulates roots from heat and cold in 
addition to adding and retaining nutrients.
 
✓ Keeps weeds down: Weeds can’t get a foothold in mulched soil, and the 
few weeds that do come up are weak and easy to pull out.
 
✓ Protects the soil: Mulch eliminates compaction and crusting of the 
valuable topsoil layer. Beneficial soil microorganisms get what they 
need under a cover of organic matter.
 
✓ Improves the soil: As organic mulches slowly decompose, they release 
their nutrients into the system. They also harbor beneficial soil fungi 
whose mycelium (a structure similar to a root system) helps open the 
soil and improve its structure.
 
✓ Eliminates damaging soil cultivation: Tilling, digging, and violent 
weeding become things of the past, which allows soil structure to 
develop unmolested as it should.
 
✓ Improves water penetration: Because the soil is open, it accepts water 
much more easily. Roots get more of the water because less of it runs 
into the street.
 
✓ Eliminates surface erosion: Soil can’t wash away in a rainstorm if it’s 
snuggled under mulch. It stays where it belongs.
 
✓ Prevents soil splashing: Mud that splatters up onto plants often carries 
diseases. Mulch keeps it in place.

253
 Chapter 16: Planting the Seed: Sustainable Plant Basics
 
✓ Creates a mud-free, dust-free, walkable surface: No more slogging 
through the muck after a rain with gobs of earth sticking to your shoes. 
No more dirt tracked into the house by kids, dogs, and husbands. And 
no more dust storms on windy days.
 
✓ Hides drip tubing: Drip irrigation is great, but frankly even I think it’s 
pretty unattractive. Mulch makes it disappear.
 
✓Makes the yard pretty. Just as making the bed is the easiest way to 
straighten up a bedroom, mulching instantly dresses your garden up.
Surveying the types of mulch
Mulches fall into two general categories: organic and inorganic. In this usage, 
organic has nothing to do with purity or pesticides; it refers to the nature of 
the material. Organic mulches come from living sources; inorganic ones come 
from minerals or other nonliving origins.
Organic mulches
Organic mulching materials include tree chips, shredded bark, pine needles, 
leaves, straw, nut shells, and compost. Organic mulches are the best way to 
go because they’re part of the living cycle of nutrients. Organic mulches 
mimic the natural duff layer in a wild ecosystem; duff (the stuff that falls off 
plants) is just mulch by another name.
This brings up an important point: Your plants will mulch themselves by 
dropping leaves and other parts when they’re no longer useful or at the end 
of the season. Nature’s way is to allow that organic matter to decompose 
in place, returning the valuable nutrients to the soil. Gardeners make a big 
mistake in raking all this stuff up and sending it off to the landfill. Why waste 
the very best thing your plants need? You’re supposed to let plant matter 
remain where it falls.
 
Never allow organic matter, however groovy it may be, to become a fire 
hazard. Keep mulch no more than 4 inches deep. Thicker mulches may ignite 
through spontaneous combustion or as the result of a carelessly discarded 
cigarette.
Inorganic mulches
Inorganic mulches include gravel, crushed rock, cinders (also known as 
pumice), decomposed granite, brick chips, plastic sheeting, geotextile fabrics 
(woven or non-woven synthetic cloth), crumb rubber (ground up car tires), 
and recycled broken glass (tumbled to remove sharp edges).

254
Part V: Great Greenery for a Green Garden 
Inorganic mulches last much longer than organic ones because they don’t 
break down very fast. But they also don’t improve the soil like organics do, 
and some of them are problematic (check out the next section). Inorganic 
mulches also don’t provide the insulating qualities of organics because they 
have little or no loft, the fluffy quality that makes sleeping bags warm and 
keeps root systems cozy. Inorganics are okay in cactus gardens where 
organic mulch would look unnatural and in specialized plantings where 
effect is more important than horticultural perfection (but keep these to a 
minimum for sustainability’s sake).
Mulches to avoid
 
Some mulches have too many problems to recommend them, and a few are 
downright dangerous. For instance:
 
✓ Stay away from highly flammable materials, such as loose leaves or 
fine-textured coconut fiber that can spontaneously ignite on a very hot 
day or that may be toxic to pets (cocoa hulls can poison animals).
 
✓ Avoid dyed mulches, which have potential problems with the dye. 
Also avoid crumb rubber mulches, which are one of the worst mulch 
materials; see Chapter 2 for the grisly details.
 
✓ Never place plastic sheeting under a layer of mulch; it prevents water 
from soaking into the soil and gases from escaping. Geotextile fabrics 
allow water and gases to pass through, but weed seeds germinate on top 
of them and then root through the fabric into the soil, making physical 
removal impossible and necessitating the use of herbicides.
 
✓ If you use a gravel mulch, wash it first, because dust particles may 
change soil chemistry for the worse.
A lesson in mulching
Mulching demands little brain power, and requires the simplest of tools. 
Here’s how to apply an organic mulch, step by step:
1. Finish grade the area to be mulched.
 
 To finish grade, smooth the soil, remove any surface rocks and debris, 
and make any adjustments to the terrain so that water goes where you 
want it when it rains (no point in flooding the house, right?).
 
 Dig along the edges of walks and patios, lowering soil about 3 inches 
below the top of the pavement. Slope the soil gradually back into the 
adjacent grade so it doesn’t drop off abruptly. This practice provides a 
lip to catch the mulch so it doesn’t spill all over the pavement.

255
 Chapter 16: Planting the Seed: Sustainable Plant Basics
 
2. Murder the weeds.
 
 Remove any weeds, including the roots. If your weeds are perennial 
(meaning the kind that come back from the roots), dig out as much of 
the root system as you can and proceed to Step 2a; otherwise skip to 
Step 3.
 
2a. Smother perennial weeds with sheet mulching.
 
 Sheet mulching (shown in Figure 16-4) is the process of covering the soil 
with a layer of cardboard and mulch to kill stubborn weeds. It works 
better than herbicides and at a much lower cost to the environment.
 
 Cover the soil with two to three layers of corrugated cardboard (old 
appliance boxes or any kind of heavy corrugated packaging). Overlap 
the cardboard pieces by at least 6 inches so that no weeds come up 
through the cracks. Wet the cardboard and move to Step 3. (Note: You 
don’t have to remove the cardboard; it decomposes in place, adding 
valuable organic matter to the soil. When the time comes to plant, 
usually a few months after sheet mulching, just make a slit in what’s left 
of the cardboard and plant as usual.)
 
 In this era of recycling, cardboard has become difficult to find because 
supermarkets no longer give it away. Try waylaying someone on the 
way to the recycling center with a truckload of cardboard by offering 
them some money to dump it at your house. Or offer to buy it from 
the recycler.
 
3. Dump on the mulch.
 
 Make an even layer 4 inches thick; it will settle to 2 to 3 inches over time. 
You need about 13 cubic yards of mulch to cover each 1,000 square feet. 
Be careful not to squash your plants, and lift trailing branches up so 
they’re on top of the mulch.

Part V: Great Greenery for a Green Garden 
 
 Keep mulch 6 inches away from the trunks of trees and shrubs. Contact 
between mulch and trunks can harbor pathogens and possibly harm the 
plants. Wet down the mulch to settle the dust and kill water-repelling 
fungus spores that can make mulch shed water like a duck.
 
 It’s important to keep mulch away from your house. Contact between 
organic matter and a building can create perfect conditions for the 
development of Meruliporia incrassata, or “house-eating fungus.” This 
bad boy, rare but potent, can turn your home into a shell of rotten wood 
before you know what happened. It’s caused by moisture in contact with 
wood; mulch can initiate the problem.
4. Maintain mulch thickness.
 
 Remember that mulch breaks down, which lets the nutrients and 
organic matter in the mulch improve the soil. But it’s bad because the 
thinner the mulch gets, the more easily weeds can pop through. Once a 
year or so, add mulch wherever there’s no plant cover, maintaining the 
3-inch optimum cover.
Dealing with mulch problems
Other problems with mulch tend to be inconsequential. Here are a few items 
that may come up:
 
✓ Fungus amongus: Organic mulches and decomposing organisms go 
hand in hand. Most of them are utterly harmless, but some, like dog 
vomit fungus and various slime molds, can be alarming to look at. And 
then you have artillery fungus, which spritzes little flecks of goo on walls 
and anything else that’s nearby. Fortunately, none of these buggers 
causes any real damage, and they’re all passing phenomena hitching a 
ride on your mulch when it’s at a particular stage of decomposition. 
Once that stage passes, so do the fungi.
 
✓ Sour smell: This too is a product of the decomposition process that will 
go away after a few days in most cases.
 
✓ Trash in recycled mulch: Because recycled organic mulch is made 
from green waste, it often contains bits of drip tubing, plastic pots, and 
other debris that has to be picked out. It’s a small price to pay for the 
sustainable benefits of recycling green waste and saving lots of money.
 
✓ Weed seeds: I once covered a property with cypress mulch; I drove by a 
couple of years later and found that our landscaping had been swal-
lowed in a forest of cypress trees. If seeds germinate, just pull them out.
 
✓ Pests and diseases: The concern that mulch may be a carrier for 
pathogens and insects appears to be unfounded, but some unwanted 
pestilence may possibly get a foothold. If that happens, follow the 
pest management recommendations in Chapter 21.

Introducing Beneficial Trees and 
Shrubs to Your Landscape
In This Chapter
▶ Reaping the many benefits of trees
▶ Matching trees to your needs
▶ Picking, planting, and pruning your new trees properly
▶ Hedging your bets with shrubs
T
rees and shrubs form the basic structure of the landscape. Smaller plants 
come and go, but woody plants can live for decades or even centuries. 
As the biggest living things in the garden, trees and shrubs can demand 
more than their share of attention and resources if they’re ill-suited to your 
growing conditions, too big for the space they’ve been given, or susceptible 
to problems. Choose trees and shrubs carefully, give them a good home, and 
provide the minimum care they need to thrive. They’ll reward you with an 
abundance of valuable services.
In this chapter, I go into the environmental benefits of trees and shrubs, 
show you how to choose trees and get them off to a good start, and explain 
how to care for them in youth and in age.
Appreciating the Many Benefits of Trees
Aside from their obvious beauty, trees offer so many benefits that it’s difficult 
to imagine how we’d ever get by without them. Bet you didn’t realize that 
trees affect all of the following:

258
Part V: Great Greenery for a Green Garden 
 
✓Environment: According to the esteemed International Society of 
Arboriculture (www.treesaregood.com), an acre of mature trees 
generates enough oxygen to meet the needs of 18 people and sequesters 
(absorbs from the atmosphere and holds in its tissue) 2.6 tons of 
carbon per year — equal to the amount generated by driving a car 8,700 
miles. Carbon sequestration is particularly important because the more 
carbon we can take out of the atmosphere, the lower the threat of global 
warming. The same acre of trees sucks up other pollutants as well, 
including ozone and sulfur dioxide.
 
✓ Ecosystem: Trees play a key role in the natural environment, hosting 
birds, insects, and animals as well as providing shade for understory 
plants. They also increase available water by improving absorption into 
the soil, and their dense canopies and extensive root systems protect 
the soil from erosion and landslides.
 
✓ Garden value: Trees provide privacy, screen out undesirable views, 
frame attractive views, and absorb noise. A tree canopy provides 
shade and reduces glare. Also, many trees make fruits, nuts, and other 
foodstuffs.
 
✓ Microclimate: A bank of evergreen trees (trees that hold onto their 
leaves all year, such as pines or live oaks) planted about 50 feet from 
your house on the windward side, protects your land and home from 
damage, and improves the microclimate in your garden. The sheltering 
effect of trees also protects against frost, allowing you to grow a wider 
range of plants.
 
✓ Your home: Placing deciduous trees (trees that lose their leaves in 
winter, such as maples or plane trees) on the east and west sides (and in 
some cases the south side) of your house keeps it cooler in summer and 
warmer in winter, lowering utility bills, saving energy, and reducing 
global warming. Trees also cool the environment around them by an 
average of 20 percent compared with adjacent treeless areas.
 
 Trees make pavement and cars last longer by providing shade that 
keeps them cooler. The shade also reduces off-gassing from vinyl and 
other materials inside your car, so you aren’t stepping into a toxic cloud 
every time you hop into the driver’s seat.
 
✓ Economics: A study in the 1990s placed a net value of the services 
provided by a typical mature tree in California at $48 to $63 per year. 
Benefits included savings in electricity and natural gas used for heating 
and cooling (a savings of $2.1 billion a year in the United States alone), 
reductions in pollutants such as carbon dioxide and ozone, rainfall 
interception resulting in a reduction in stormwater runoff, and aesthetic 
benefits. The study also found that a mature tree in the front yard 
of a residence increased the sales price by around 1 percent. Keep in 
mind that the dollar amounts would be much higher today. Check out 
Figure 17-1 to see how this impact looks in the real world.

Determining Which Trees 
Meet Your Needs
The right tree is one of the most essential and sustainable elements in a 
typical landscape. But before you hustle down to the nursery and get a whole 
bunch of trees, you need to do your homework.
First, compile a list of candidate trees. Read up on trees in a good gardening 
book, check out the mature trees in a local botanic garden, or visit http://
selectree.calpoly.edu for great information on choosing the right tree. 
Then ask yourself the following questions about your candidate trees to help 
bring matters into focus:
 
✓ What’s it gonna do? As always, the sustainable question is “What’s the 
purpose of your tree?” You may be looking for shade, wildlife habitat, 
flower or foliage color, wind protection, food, all those functions, or 
even more. Pick a tree that meets your needs.
 
✓ Where’s it gonna go? Pick a location where shade will be desirable, and 
where the tree has room to grow. Check for compatibility with other 
plants in the area and with the style of your house.

260
Part V: Great Greenery for a Green Garden 
 
✓ What’s it gonna mess up? Check for adequate clearance from power 
lines, underground utilities, pavement, and foundations. Avoid placing 
trees with aggressive roots anywhere near any plumbing, pavement, or 
buildings. Don’t plant a tree that drops a lot of leaves, flowers, and fruits 
over pavement, especially if it creates a hazard. Think about the effect 
of the tree on your view and on the views your neighbors enjoy; some 
communities outlaw trees that grow into a neighbor’s view. Avoid trees 
that are poisonous, highly flammable, short-lived, brittle, unstable, 
invasive, weedy, or particularly susceptible to pests and diseases.
 
 Criminey! It sounds like all trees cause problems, but that’s not the case. 
Many trees are almost problem-free, and even ones with drawbacks will 
be fine in the right situation. But be realistic about problems and don’t 
let love blind you to the realities (remember that you might live with 
this tree longer than you live with your spouse).
 
✓ What’s it gonna look like? Ponder the many shapes of trees: broad 
crown, spreading, narrow crown, pyramidal, vase, and columnar, not to 
mention the distinctive shape of palm trees. Imagine how these shapes 
would fit in your yard. Think about foliage texture and color, flower 
color and season, branching habit, and even wind movement.
 
✓ What’s it gonna need? Consider the water requirements of the tree as 
well as the soil, food, and weather conditions it needs, its requirements 
for pruning and other professional care, and its resistance to pests and 
diseases.
Giving New Trees a Solid Start
Proper selection, correct planting, and good follow-up care are essential to 
success with trees. If you bollix up an annual or perennial, starting over is no 
big deal. However, messing up a tree means years of lost time or a perma-
nently disfigured or inappropriate (and very large) element in the landscape. 
Choose, plant, and care for your trees with the utmost loving attention. I 
show you how in the following sections.
Selecting the right-size tree
Unless you have a genuine need for instant shade and a huge budget, plant a 
relatively small tree. Trees come in all sizes, and costs run from a few dollars 
to thousands.
 
A smaller tree will be the fastest-growing and most rewarding way to go. 
Those big specimen trees are way past the age for travel; their roots are old 
and set in their ways. In many cases, a big tree sulks, showing little vigor and 
displaying little growth. But a young tree in, say, a 15-gallon container, will 
take off and grow like a puppy, rooting vigorously into the soil.

261
 Chapter 17: Introducing Beneficial Trees and Shrubs to Your Landscape
Finding a healthy specimen
Choosing a quality tree is vital to its long-term performance. In this section, I 
show you what to look for in a tree and how to avoid some of the pitfalls you 
may not know about until it’s too late.
Tree packages
Trees are grown several different ways, with regional differences based on 
climate and custom. There’s no “right” kind of package; here are a few of the 
most common types:
 
✓ Containers: Trees are often planted in plastic pots of varying sizes, 
expressed in gallons. Sizes range from 1 to 15 gallons. In terms of the 
actual size of the tree, and depending on the species, a “one” (as it’s 
called in the biz) generally is 1 or 2 feet tall, not too impressive at the 
start but a good way to go if you want fast growth and low cost. A “
fifteen” is 5 to 8 feet tall with a caliper (diameter of the trunk) of 1½   to 2 
inches; it’s a great choice for a reasonable-size, fairly inexpensive tree.
 
 Larger trees are contained in tapered wooden boxes running 24 to 72 
inches wide and even bigger. The biggest boxed trees need to be planted 
with heavy equipment and are stunningly expensive. A 24-inch tree isn’t 
a bad way to go, planting out at 12 to 15 feet tall and still young enough 
to establish well.
The sustainable home orchard
Fruit trees are among the most sustainable 
plants you can grow. Most fruit-bearing trees 
require relatively little care and can actually be 
fun to husband. If you choose varieties with a 
history of success in your area, you’ll be able to 
harvest organically grown, local food for 
decades to come.
To develop a home orchard, list the fruits and 
nuts that you like to eat. Check with local 
food-growing experts and your neighbors — 
especially old-timers — to learn which varieties 
work best in your area. (Nurseries, especially 
the big chains, often buy whatever’s on 
the market and rely on the ignorance of their 
customers to make the sale. If you expect to get 
good yields and tasty fruit, exact varieties 
matter. Choose carefully.)
Next, plan how to incorporate the trees into 
your landscaping. Place the most attractive 
trees (such as persimmons, citrus, apricots, 
pears, apples, figs, cherries, and many nut 
crops) in prominent locations, keeping the less 
charismatic varieties out of sight. (Peaches, for 
example, can be homely, especially if they get 
leaf curl.) Make sure that soil conditions are 
suitable by testing as described in Chapter 16. 
Plant your trees where they’ll get full sun all 
day long.
You can pack fruit trees in tightly, but avoid 
doing so if you have plenty of room. Don’t forget 
that many kinds of fruit trees can be espaliered
(trained into a flat panel-like shape to save 
space) against a sunny wall. You can also plant 
dwarf fruit trees that take up lots less room.

262
Part V: Great Greenery for a Green Garden 
 
✓ Balled-and-burlapped: In many regions, trees are grown in the ground 
and dug up at the time of sale; the root ball is swathed in burlap 
and fastened with twine or cradled in a wire basket. These balled-and-
burlapped (B&B) trees come in various sizes. B&B trees are most often 
the deciduous kind, dug in the dormant season when they’re leafless; 
plant them as soon as possible after purchase.
 
✓ Bare root: Deciduous fruit and ornamental trees are often sold as bare-
root trees in winter, when they’re dormant and leafless. Because their 
roots are exposed, they need to be planted quickly. They tend to be 
small (6 to 8 feet tall), lightweight, and easy to plant; they’re also a snap 
to evaluate for condition because you can see everything.
 
✓ Transplanted: Established trees can be dug from one place and planted 
in another with implements ranging from ordinary hand tools to tractor-
mounted tree spades. It’s best to dig around part of the root system 
6 months to 1 year in advance, to allow new roots to develop within the 
future root ball. Transplanted trees are at high risk for loss but can be a 
good way to go if you have a good tree in a bad location.
Tree features
Most commercially available trees are grown too tall and skinny; placed too 
close together in the nursery; and trained to be top-heavy, with lots of 
canopy on a feeble trunk. Bare-root and B&B trees (see the previous section) 
tend to be better than containerized ones. A few nurseries grow stocky, 
robust, real trees. Here are some things to look for in a healthy tree:
 
✓ Good roots: The root system should be proportional to the canopy and 
well branched and fresh, displaying a lot of young root shoots. Seeing 
the whole root system is easy with a bare-root tree. Avoid containerized 
trees with roots coming out the drainage holes in the bottom of the pot, 
and follow the other tips on picking healthy plants in Chapter 16. The 
root ball of a B&B tree should be firm and 10 to 12 times the diameter of 
the trunk measured 6 inches above the soil. (A tree with a 2-inch trunk 
should have a root ball 24 inches in diameter, for example.)
 
 Grab the trunk and push it back and forth. A well-rooted tree is immov-
able; a poorly rooted one wiggles around in the soil. Examine the 
trunk where it enters the soil, looking for girdling roots that circle one 
another — a sure sign of problems.
 
✓ Trunk flare: The trunk of a healthy tree widens as it enters the ground. 
If you see a trunk that plunges straight into the soil like a telephone pole, 
that tree has been planted too deeply to do well.
 
✓ Happy branches and good crotches: The canopy of the tree should be 
nicely proportioned, with evenly spaced branches. Examine the crotches, 
which are where branches come together; they should be wide and 
strong. V-shaped crotches indicate weak attachment and the probability 

263
 Chapter 17: Introducing Beneficial Trees and Shrubs to Your Landscape
of catastrophic failure in some future windstorm. Avoid trees with 
wounds and clumsy pruning cuts that left stubs. Check for cracks where 
branches meet the trunk. If the tree is tied to a stake, be sure that the

Planting a tree properly
 
To plant a tree properly, read the general planting instructions in Chapter 16 
and follow these additional tips for trees:
 
✓ Set the tree at the right height and make sure it sits on undisturbed soil.
 
✓ Lift by the root ball, not the trunk, to prevent strain on the root system.
 
✓ Carefully straighten the tree so the trunk is vertical.
 
✓ Make sure that the best side of the tree is visible.
 
✓ Staking weakens trees. If the tree is robust and well grown it won’t need 
staking unless there are extreme wind conditions. Remove the nursery 
stake and see whether the tree remains upright. If you stake it, be 
sure the ties are loose to allow a little movement (see Figure 17-2). Large 
trees may need to be supported with guy wires instead of stakes.

Tree care during the early years
Care of your newly planted tree is critical to its long-term health. There’s not 
much to do, but it’s important to do it right. Read on for details.
 
✓ Pruning young trees: The pruning you do on your new trees will set 
their course for life, determining their shape, strength, and overall 
health. It’s easy to do, but it’s critical that you do it right and not do too 
much. Develop a central trunk with main scaffold branches spaced 
evenly along and around the trunk. Eliminate any tight crotches as well 
as any branches that are crossing, rubbing, damaged, weak, oversized, 
or redundant (see Figure 17-3). See Chapter 20 for more pruning advice.
 
 Some folks will tell you that a newly planted tree should be heavily 
cut back. Poppycock. A young tree needs every leaf to develop a 
healthy root system. Prune with a light hand, following the previous 
instructions.
 
✓ Establishment watering: Two of the biggest reasons trees don’t estab-
lish properly are underwatering and overwatering. Monitor the soil 
with a probe or shovel to make sure the root ball doesn’t dry out. If your 
soil drains poorly, be sure you don’t drown the tree.
 
✓Fertilizing and pest control: Assuming that you fertilized well at 
planting time and chose species well adapted to your site, your trees 
shouldn’t require feeding for months or years. If growth slows 
abnormally, broadcast a balanced organic fertilizer throughout the 
root zone, and water it into the top 12 to 18 inches of soil. Watch for 
and promptly treat insect damage and disease.
 
✓ Protection: Keep gophers under control. Build sturdy cages around your 
trees if deer or other browsers are a problem. Shade or whitewash your 
sun-sensitive trees to protect them against sunscald. Stake securely if 
strong winds are a consideration.
Shrubs in the Sustainable Landscape
Shrubs are often the easiest group of plants to care for, assuming that you’ve 
chosen well. When properly used, shrubs demand little in the way of fertil-
izer, water, and other resources. In fact, a good shrub is as sustainable as 
anything you can imagine, getting all it needs from sun, soil, and rain. If I’ve 
convinced you that you need to include a few shrubs in your landscape, read 
on for more information.

265
 Chapter 17: Introducing Beneficial Trees and Shrubs to Your Landscape

main scaffold braches spaced
evenly along and around the trunk.
An unpruned, untrained tree has
several co-dominant stems. It may
also have tight crotches and branches
that are crossing, rubbing, oversized,
and redundant.
Considering types of shrubs
A shrub is a woody plant that lives more than one season, is smaller than 
a tree, and is larger than a perennial plant. Shrubs can be arborescent (tree-
like), upright, mounding, spreading, or prostrate. Shrubs can be deciduous 
(losing their leaves in winter, such as Forsythia and roses), broadleaf ever-
green (holding on to their leafy growth year-round, like lavender and camel-
lia), or coniferous evergreen (with needle- or scalelike foliage, such as yew 
and juniper). Shrubs bloom in different seasons, and many offer colorful 
fall or winter foliage. Speaking of color, don’t overlook shrubs that are 
variegated (with multicolor leaves). Thorny or prickly shrubs can be useful 
at boundaries as barrier plants.
Knowing what shrubs can do for you
Shrubs are the ultimate sustainable multitaskers. They can screen out unde-
sirable views, create private spaces, exclude unwanted visitors, block wind, 
define boundaries, subdivide large spaces, create a stunning accent, soften 

266
Part V: Great Greenery for a Green Garden 
the lines of your house, provide a background for smaller plants, act as 
erosion-controlling ground cover, provide food and concealment for wildlife, 
and bear fruit and other food for you. Here are tips on a few key uses of 
shrubs:
 
✓ Hedges and screens: Using shrubs as untrimmed screening plants is a 
lot less work than planting a sheared hedge. Choose evergreen shrubs of 
the proper size for boundary plantings and let them do their thing with-
out trimming. If space is limited, or if you’re looking for a formal effect, a 
clipped hedge is the way to go. Unfortunately, Mother Nature didn’t 
make many plants that are 2 feet wide and 8 feet tall, so the gardener is 
forced to train larger plants into that form. If space is really limited, try a 
fence covered with vines; you’ll get the effect of a hedge with much less 
width and less care.
 
✓ Specimen shrubs: A striking plant, when used individually at a focal 
point in the landscape, is called a specimen. Choose something with an 
open habit (with branches showing through the foliage), interesting 
branch structure, fabulous flowers, or some other attention-getting char-
acteristic. Keep it separate from adjacent shrubs and place compatible 
perennials at its feet for a lovely scene.
 
✓ Massing: To cover large areas with tall, easy-to-grow plants, use masses 
of shrubs, mixing a few varieties that vary in texture, foliage color, 
flower color and season, and habit. Consider the year-round appear-
ance, making sure that the shrub displays something for every season, 
whether it be foliage, flowers, fruit, or attractive bare branches. Avoid 
random one-of-each plantings; repeat varieties through the area.
 
✓ Foundation plantings: Planting shrubs all around the house has been 
out of fashion for quite a while. But shrubs located strategically to 
soften or accent the lines of the house are still welcome. Try planting 
shrubs far enough away from the house that they can be enjoyed from 
both inside and out.
Buying quality shrubs
Shrubs are long-lived plants and, along with trees, form the backbone of the 
garden. For that reason, choosing well is important. Buy shrubs in smaller 
container sizes unless you need mature plants immediately for a party or 
wedding. A 1-gallon shrub often overtakes a 5-gallon or 15-gallon shrub of the 
same variety in just one or two growing seasons.
 
When shopping for shrubs, choose varieties that are well adapted to your 
climate, that thrive with minimal inputs of water, fertilizer, and the like, 
and that are the right size for the space you have. See Chapter 16 for more 
information on selecting healthy, vigorous plants.

267
 Chapter 17: Introducing Beneficial Trees and Shrubs to Your Landscape
 
Make sure that your shrubs aren’t poisonous, especially if little kids or pets 
are around. Some shrubs — such as yew, rhododendron, and oleander — are 
highly toxic.
Working with shrubs
The rules that apply to other types of planting also apply to shrubs; see 
Chapter 16 for the dirty details. Plant clipped hedges 3 to 4 feet apart in most 
cases, depending on the kind of plant you’re using.
Except for hedges, pruning should be done from the inside out, removing 
conflicting, damaged, weak, or dead branches. Many shrubs can be 
rejuvenated by cutting them back hard, or even to the ground, every few 
years as needed. For basic care information, see Chapters 20 and 21.

W
elcome to the wonderful world of the smaller landscaping plants, 
the nonwoody things that add so much charm and function to 
the garden. You could create a lovely planting of just trees, shrubs, and 
mulch, but small-scale companion plants add a lot to the personality of a 
garden. Remember, too, that many kinds of nonwoody plants serve practical 
functions in addition to being ornamental. Perhaps most important of all, 
diversity increases stability and, therefore, sustainability.
Planting Perennials for 
Beauty and Habitat
Perennial plants are those that live for more than two years. They’re gener-
ally nonwoody, and most of them die back in winter in colder areas. 
Perennials are often grown for their colorful flowers, but many are valuable 
for other reasons. In the sections that follow, I introduce you to perennials 
and their functions; I also show you how to select perennials and put them 
to good use in your garden.

270
Part V: Great Greenery for a Green Garden 
Making pals with perennials
Perennials are perfectly attuned to the low-impact, low-maintenance philoso-
phy of sustainable landscaping, making them the perfect companions to your 
garden. Consider some of the benefits that perennials bring:
 
✓ They’re among the easiest flowering plants to maintain, requiring only 
occasional deadheading (removing the dead flowers) and an annual hard 
pruning at the end of the season. (See Chapter 20 for details on caring 
for perennials.)
 
✓ A well-chosen perennial requires little supplemental watering or fertiliza-
tion and resists attacks by pests and diseases.
 
✓ If given adequate space to grow, perennials don’t need to be pruned to 
control their size.
Perennials also are revered for their colorful flowers, which are attractive to 
the following groups:
 
✓ Birds: Many birds depend on perennial plants for food, shelter, and 
nesting materials. For example, red flowers, especially tubular ones, 
provide nourishment for hummingbirds.
 
✓ Bees and beneficial insects: Many flowering plants attract bees, an 
insect that’s having a difficult time these days due to diseases and loss 
of habitat. Many perennials, such as goldenrod, lamb’s ear, and Shasta 
daisy, provide habitat for beneficial insects that reciprocate by helping 
to keep your garden free of pests.
 
✓ Animals: Rabbits, deer, and other mammals feed on perennials. As long 
as this doesn’t result in destruction of your plantings, it can help return 
wildlife to communities. You can even get your property certified as a 
wildlife habitat; visit www.nwf.org/backyard for information.
 
✓ Humans: Culinary herbs, such as thyme, oregano, and mint, are easy 
to grow and are long-lived. Other perennials offer food — and you 
have choices beyond the usual asparagus, rhubarb, and artichokes. 
For example, primroses, daylilies, and hyssop all have edible parts. 
Perennial plants have medicinal uses, too. Consider the easy-to-grow 
Aloe vera, lemon balm, lavender, and feverfew. Visit www.altnature.
com for more on medicinal perennial plants.
Choosing and using perennials
Perennials vary widely in their tolerance for sun or shade, wet or dry condi-
tions, cold or mild climate, and type of soil. They come in a wide range of 
sizes, too. They span the range of flowering periods from spring through fall, 

271
 Chapter 18: Enhancing Your Landscape’s Sustainability with Smaller Plants
and some varieties even bloom in fairly cold winters. If you live in a mild 
Mediterranean or other semitropical climate, you can enjoy perennial flowers 
all year long.
 
Perennials demand little and live a long time; that’s why they’re a welcome 
element in the sustainable landscape.
When selecting perennials, avoid Saturday Morning Syndrome: choosing 
plants impulsively because they’re looking all cute at the nursery. Instead, 
take the time to make a plan before you head out. Here are some things to 
keep in mind:
 
✓ Decide on a color scheme.
 
✓ Research climate-adapted varieties that will work in your location.
 
✓ Make a wish list and then choose the most compatible plants from that 
list, making sure they have the same growing requirements and look 
good together.
 
✓ Repeat varieties throughout your planting so you don’t get the one-of-
each look. Include six to ten varieties in any given area, using at least 
three plants of each variety.
 
✓ Mix varieties that have compatible foliage colors and textures.
 
✓ Consider the overall form of the plants: mounding, spiky, and so on, and 
combine forms that look good together.
 
✓ Mix plants that have different seasons of bloom.
 
✓ Vary the height and width of the plants you choose.
Look in a gardening encyclopedia for lists of perennials that are suited to 
your region. Such lists show plants by color, season of bloom, soil or light 
requirements, and other characteristics. Comb the lists for things that 
appeal to you, cross-checking to be sure that your candidate plants meet 
all your requirements. Then take your list to a local nursery to check 
availability, discuss possible combinations with nursery staff, and see the 
plants. Observe mature specimens in actual gardens if possible.
 
Mail-order nurseries offer unusual perennials. The plants often cost more 
than what you’d find locally, but it may be the only way to obtain hard-to-find 
species that you’ll never run across at the local chain store.
 
After you’ve picked out your plants and made a plan, you’re ready to put ’em 
in place. Keep in mind that most perennials are best planted in the fall. This 
matches their natural growth cycle, reduces the amount of water needed to 
get them established, and improves their chances for survival. Follow the 
standard planting instructions in Chapter 16.

272
Part V: Great Greenery for a Green Garden 
Adding Annuals and Biennials 
for Color and Wildlife
Annuals live a year, set seed for the next generation, and croak. “Live fast, die 
young” is their philosophy. Examples of annual plants are petunias, cosmos, 
and pansies. Biennials take a slightly different track, hanging around for a 
year as somewhat unimpressive green blobs and then doing the flower-and-
kick-the-bucket thing the second year. Examples are sweet William and 
foxglove.
Gardeners choose annuals and biennials for three reasons: color, color, and 
color. But they can also provide nectar for insects, pollen for bees, seed for 
birds, and browse for animals.
Considering the sustainability 
of annuals and biennials
When you think about those massive beds of marigolds and petunias that 
some gardeners laboriously renew every spring, you may conclude that 
annuals and biennials are about as far from sustainable landscaping elements 
as nuclear-powered riding mowers. But some of them are most welcome in 
the sustainable landscape.
For example, native wildflowers thrive on natural rainfall and reseed them-
selves to come back year after year. They’re just what native insects 
and animals need for habitat. You can’t get more sustainable than that, 
and they’re beautiful to boot. Even nonnatives offer pollen for the bees.
Selecting and using appropriate 
annuals and biennials
When you choose annuals and biennials, select varieties that fit with your 
overall planting scheme and that can take care of themselves. Check the 
hardiness (in gardening parlance that’s how cold-tolerant a plant is, not 
how tough it is) and earliest-planting-date information on the seed packet if 
you’re planting from seed (the most sustainable way to go). Hardy plants 
can overwinter as seeds in the ground; tender ones that can’t take freezing 
winters should be planted in spring, whether from seed or plants. You can 
also find half-hardy annuals and biennials that put up with yucky cold 
weather but not frost. Let natives go to seed instead of cutting them back 
before their natural life cycle is completed.

273
 Chapter 18: Enhancing Your Landscape’s Sustainability with Smaller Plants
 
Consider growing all your annuals from seed; it’s the most resource-efficient 
(and sustainable) way to obtain them. Start seeds in flats or small pots and 
move them into the garden later, or sow the seeds directly into ground 
that has been weeded and lightly raked to loosen the soil. Save and trade 
seeds with other gardeners, too. If you buy annuals in pots or packs, avoid 
overgrown plants that are already in bloom.
Brushing Up on Bulbs 
and Bulblike Plants
Bulbs (and their close kin rhizomes, corms, and tubers) are among the loveli-
est and easiest garden plants. Examples of bulbs include tulips, hyacinth, 
crocuses, and daffodils. A bulb’s vertical, strap-shaped foliage and stunning 
flowers add a lively bit of punctuation (think exclamation point) to perennial 
beds and meadows. Bulbs live for many years. Most of them die back after 
they flower, spending the winter underground to emerge and bloom again in 
spring.
Making wildflower meadow magic: Not so easy
The fact is that a wildflower meadow (which is 
different from the types of meadows I suggest 
as lawn substitutes in Chapter 19) is one of the 
most daunting challenges in the gardening 
world. Yes, making a native meadow is righ-
teously sustainable, and you can try to your 
heart’s content. But if you don’t eliminate the 
weed seeds first, and if you don’t follow up with 
diligent weeding and protection from browsing 
animals and other pests as the young meadow 
develops, you’ll end up with something fit only 
for a pass with the rototiller. Further, most of the 
so-called wildflower mixes available for sale 
aren’t true to the mix of species in any real 
meadow and almost certainly aren’t tuned to 
your particular location. Nevertheless, you can 
succeed with a small wildflower meadow if you 
follow these tips:
 ✓ Choose a custom mix of truly local wild-
flowers; see a reputable local seed dealer 
for advice.
 ✓ Spend several months sheet-mulching (see 
Chapter 16) before you sow your seeds.
 ✓ Plant the wildflower meadow at the right 
time of year for your location. Check with 
your seed dealer for advice, or read the 
label on your seed packet.
 ✓ Plan to spend time hand-pulling tiny weeds 
out of wildflower seedlings.
If you’re successful, you’ll have a great display 
of color in the spring, and some plants may 
come back the following spring. Try sowing 
smaller quantities of wildflowers in perennial 
borders and turf-type meadows. Remove little 
patches of mulch to expose bare ground, loosen 
it a bit with a cultivating fork, sow a few seeds 
(just a few!), and top-dress with a 1/4-inch thick 
layer of fine compost or similar organic matter. 
Nature will do the rest.

274
Part V: Great Greenery for a Green Garden 
 
Bulbs are considered sustainable because they require little or no care once 
established. Plus, native bulbs in your garden help preserve wild species and 
provide sustenance for native creatures. However, never dig bulbs from the 
wild or purchase dug bulbs from unscrupulous dealers. There’s no need to 
destroy nature to get plants.
Here are some tips for using bulbs successfully and easily:
 
✓ Use bulbs in drifts and masses, or salt them among other small plants. 
Bulbs belong in meadows, where they add diversity.
 
✓ Many bulbs are among the first plants to bloom in spring. They can be 
planted in mixed borders for an early show.
 
✓ Many bulbs naturalize, increasing their numbers annually to form 
sizable, dense populations that need little care.
 
✓ You don’t need to dig bulbs up and put them in storage every year. If a 
bulb needs that kind of treatment, it isn’t adapted to your climate.
 
✓ Follow the package instructions on planting depth, which can be critical 
to their success.
 
✓ Plant bulbs in chicken-wire baskets and cover the soil with wire to 
protect them from squirrels, gophers, and birds.
 
✓ Allow the foliage of most bulbs to die down naturally to feed the bulb for 
the following year’s performance.
Walking on Living Carpet: 
Perennial Ground Covers
In some ways, ground cover is a dubious term. As the term is commonly used, 
it means a low-growing nonwoody perennial plant that sprawls across a wide 
area. Meadows are a special type of ground cover; see Chapter 19 for more 
on them. The idea of ground covers seems to be twofold:
 
✓ To play the role of lawn, visually and sometimes functionally.
 
✓ To outcompete weeds for a carefree sward of greenery and flowers.
 
These ideas are lovely, and in some situations they actually work. At other 
times, the solution becomes the problem because of poor plant selection. 
Tread carefully in the world of ground covers, and find out what really 
succeeds before committing to a plan of action.
The main pitfalls of the ground-cover approach have to do with the nature of 
the chosen plants. Following the “right plant, right place” dictum can result in 
a successful, more-or-less-bulletproof planting. But a careless choice can 
create a disaster. Here are the major ills of common approaches:

275
 Chapter 18: Enhancing Your Landscape’s Sustainability with Smaller Plants
 
✓ Weeds: Weeds show up through underground or aboveground runners 
and by way of seeds. If the ground-cover planting is too low to the 
ground or contains bare spots, weeds and germinating weed seeds can 
get right to the sunlight and take control quickly. At that point, you face 
laborious hand-weeding or the use of herbicides.
 
 The sustainable approach is to choose plants that are at least 1 foot 
tall so they shade the soil and keep weeds down. Use a drip system to 
irrigate instead of keeping the soil surface constantly moist with an 
overhead sprinkler system, which creates a perfect environment for 
seed germination. Choose drought-tolerant plants and water little or not 
at all; seeds germinate only during the wet season.
 
✓ Invasiveness: Many ground covers are viney and try to grow out of 
bounds. Some, like ivy, are so aggressive that you’d swear they’re going 
to grow into the next zip code. With plants like this, there’s nothing you 
can do except keep cutting them back.
 
 Pick plants that have a determinate growth habit, meaning that they grow 
to a certain relatively predictable size and stay there. Plant them far 
enough from edges to eliminate the need for trimming. In other words, 
keep a plant that grows to 4 feet in diameter at least 2 feet from the edge 
of the bed it’s in.
 
✓ High water use: Many drought-tolerant ground covers are available; 
pick one of those instead of a thirsty variety.
 
✓ Bees: Bees pollinate crops, make honey, and are smart, cute, and utterly 
essential to life on Earth. But stepping on bees isn’t good for neither 
man nor bees, especially if you’re allergic to them. Avoid bee-attracting 
varieties like clover or Lippia for walk-on ground covers.
Getting Ornamental with Grasses
There was a time when grasses in the yard were either lawn or weeds. Then 
some folks in Europe began growing grasses for their beauty — not perpetu-
ally crew cut and indistinguishable from one another, as in a lawn, but placed 
as individual plants in flower beds and allowed to grow to their full glory. It 
took gardeners a while to get used to seeing fully grown grass plants without 
yanking them out by the roots. But the charms of grass prevailed, and many 
gardeners came to love ornamentals. In the sections that follow, I describe 
the benefits and pitfalls of growing ornamental grasses, and I explain how to 
sustainably use and maintain them.
Understanding ornamental grass basics
Ornamental grasses range in size from 6-inch-tall Fescue to clumps of 
Miscanthus that grow 8 feet tall or higher. Even bamboo is technically a 

276
Part V: Great Greenery for a Green Garden 
grass. Grasses can be sustainable elements in the landscape as long as 
they’re climate adapted, noninvasive, and the right size.
 
Read up on the grasses in a good plant encyclopedia or one of the many 
books that specialize in ornamental grasses. Ask other gardeners or local 
nursery people about what works best in your area.
Here are some of the basic benefits of using grasses:
 
✓ Many species tolerate or prefer poor soil and require little or no 
fertilizer.
 
✓ Unlike lawn grasses, they don’t need much in the way of water.
 
✓ They’re generally pest free.
 
✓ They sequester a lot of carbon, which helps mitigate global warming.
 
✓ They grow quickly and live a long time in most cases.
 
✓ They resist browsing by deer and other animals.
On the other hand, grasses do have some problems:
 
✓ Weeds: The most vexing problem is weeds. If you’ve ever tried to pull 
two grassy plants apart, you know that it’s like trying to break up a 
dogfight. Multiply this situation by a yard full of grasses and you’ve got 
yourself a hobby. The answer is to choose drought-tolerant varieties 
and be sure to pull weeds when they’re young.
 
✓ Invasiveness: Avoid using invasive varieties, such as fountain grass, 
pampas grass, big and little bluestem, Miscanthus, and Nassella tenuis-
sima; they become weeds, and some can even harm wild ecosystems. 
They can be nearly impossible to get rid of. What’s harmless in one 
area can be pernicious in another, so check ornamental grass books for 
bad guys and talk to your local cooperative extension office for locally 
troublesome species.
 
✓ Fiery dispositions: Some grasses are highly flammable. In fact, most 
wildfires start in dry grasses. Irrigate enough to keep them green, and 
periodically remove dead foliage by hand or cut the plants back hard 
in early spring.
Integrating grasses sustainably 
into the landscape
Ornamental grasses make great specimen plants, ground covers, and mass 
plantings. They even grow in containers. Mixing grasses with perennials and 
shrubs gives your landscaping a natural feel. Here are some basic consider-
ations for working grasses into your plantings:

277
 Chapter 18: Enhancing Your Landscape’s Sustainability with Smaller Plants
 
✓ Cool and uncool grasses: Grasses fall into two categories: cool season 
(which are most active at . . . guess what time of year?) and warm season 
(which do better in that other time of year). Mix cool- and warm-season 
grasses for year-round interest. Winter brings a fourth season of beauty 
to many grasses if you wait until spring to cut them back.
 
✓ Runners and clumpers: Running grasses spread, often vigorously, by 
underground shoots; they can be handy for erosion control, but many of 
them can get out of hand quickly and become nuisances. Clumping 
grasses hang out in one place and don’t get in anybody’s face; they’re 
easier to live with.
 
✓ Light: With a few exceptions, grasses like full sun, so plan to use them in 
open areas where they’ll get at least half a day of the stuff. In shadier 
areas, try grass-like rushes and sedges.
 
✓ Special effects: Exploit the unique charms of grasses: their fountain-like 
growth habit, the graceful way they move and rustle in the wind, the 
way morning and afternoon light settles in the foliage. Plant grasses to 
the west of a bench or patio for a wonderful backlit sunset show. Use the 
showy blooms in flower arrangements. Plant a tall specimen grass where 
you want an eye-catching vertical element.
 
✓ Soil stabilization: Take advantage of the extensive root system of 
grasses to knit unstable soil together. However, see Chapter 14 for an 
important caveat about preventing landslides.
Keeping your garden from becoming 
a pain in the grass
Assuming you’ve chosen your grasses well, you shouldn’t have much trouble 
with them. Here’s a rundown of tasks that you may or may not need to do:
 
✓ Water: Many grasses are happy with rainfall alone, but some need 
supplemental irrigation. Many drought-tolerant grasses can tolerate wet 
soils, but they may grow too lush and floppy in wet soil, and they may 
end up being short lived, too.
 
 Drip, overhead, and hand watering are all okay. Wet the soil 12 to 18 
inches deep. Water as seldom as you can get away with.
 
✓Fertilize: Most grasses don’t need fertilizer; in fact, overly fertile 
conditions encourage weak growth. Especially avoid excess nitrogen, 
which produces lush foliage to the point where it can be a problem.
 
✓ Avoid pests and diseases: Overwatering and overcrowding can encour-
age diseases. Gophers will eat grasses from underground, so plant them 
in protective wire baskets (see Chapter 16 for details). Other critters will 
browse on your grasses from time to time; remember that grasses are 
here for just that purpose and can’t be hurt by a little grazing.

278
Part V: Great Greenery for a Green Garden 
 
✓ Get control of weeds: Carefully remove young weeds, roots and all. 
Wetting things down first helps a lot. Don’t let the weeds get too big, or 
you’ll end up lifting and dividing the grass (or removing it altogether) 
just to get the weeds out.
 
✓ Cut back: Some grasses can go along for years with no pruning, but 
most look better (and are safer in a fire) if you cut them back hard 
annually in early spring. You may also want to try combing dead 
foliage out with your hands (wear gloves). Meadows can be mowed — 
or grazed, if you happen to have a few head of cattle around.
Walking a Vine Line
Vines have a special place in the landscape. They can be useful for small or 
narrow spaces, but they can also be problematic, growing into trees and 
invading spaces not meant for them. Using vines well can result in a richer 
garden environment; misusing them can cause grief.
Understanding nature’s di-vine strategy
Vines developed as a way to exploit limited sunlight in forests where the light 
is taken by the trees, leaving little for smaller plants. Vines tolerate shade 
when they’re young and scramble to the tops of the trees to get to the sun, 
spreading out as soon as they reach the canopy. All vines compete with 
their host trees, and some — like the strangler fig of tropical rain forests — 
ultimately kill the tree and become trees themselves by developing huge 
trunks and branches. Some introduced vines such as the infamous kudzu in 
the Southern U.S. have become a severe problem with no solution in sight. If 
all this sounds kind of violent or at least rude, it is. Natural doesn’t always 
play gentle.
 
When properly chosen and planted in a suitable location, the right vine can be 
just the ticket for special garden needs. Vines need more trimming than other 
plants, but sometimes that’s a small price to pay to get a lot of function.
Here are some general things to consider to make vines work for you:
 
✓ Using vines: Make use of vines to cover fences where you have no space 
for a hedge. Plant them on walls to help insulate the house and conceal 
bad architecture. Send them over the hill to control erosion.
 
✓Choosing a climbing style: Some vines twine around their support; 
others wrap small tendrils around the stems of other plants; still others 
stick by means of little holdfasts, which look like teeny lizard feet. Some 
vines just sprawl. Choose a vine type that grows on the support you 
plan to offer it. (Holdfasts, by the way, are well named; they can be 
nearly impossible to get off if you want to paint.)

279
 Chapter 18: Enhancing Your Landscape’s Sustainability with Smaller Plants
 
✓ Deciding between evergreen or deciduous vines: Evergreen vines 
hold their leaves all year; deciduous ones lose them in winter. Choose 
evergreens for screening purposes.
 
✓ Attracting wildlife: Many vines attract and nurture butterflies, birds, 
and bees. Vines can also attract rats, which is not so good unless you 
happen to love rats.
 
✓ Building a support system: Make your support strong, because mature 
vines can be surprisingly heavy. A building will do as long as you’re 
willing to keep the vine trimmed away from eaves and openings. Install 
horizontal stainless steel wires on fences, and hand-train the vines onto 
them. Make trellises out of natural materials such as the whiplike 
branches pruned from deciduous fruit trees.
 
 You may be tempted to grow big vines on overhead pergolas. What 
usually happens is that all the leaves and flowers grow on top, where all 
the light is, and you end up sitting underneath looking at dead stuff and 
wondering when the rats are going to start jumping on your head. And 
when the time comes to paint, you’ll wish you’d never heard the word 
vine. If your pergola is ugly, tear it down; don’t make things worse by 
trying to hide it with a vine. Also, go ahead and let a vine climb up to the 
second story if you like spending your weekends teetering high on a 
ladder with electric hedge clippers in your face.
 
 Avoid growing vines on power poles. They draw attention to the pole 
and make the utility companies unhappy, because they have to keep cut-
ting back the vines. Keep them out of trees, too.
 
✓ Planting different combinations: Try planting two vines that bloom in 
different seasons for a longer display of color.
Letting vines feed you, too
Everyone knows about the grapevine, but many other vines also produce 
edible fruits, including passion fruit; kiwi; and cold-hardy arctic kiwi, berries, 
hops, and chayote. Don’t forget annual vines such as peas, beans, squash, 
and melons. Food-bearing vines can grow in places where fruit trees and 
vegetable beds would never fit, and they often put the fruit at a nice pickable 
level to eliminate stooping and climbing.
If you’re in the market for a couple of food-bearing vines, first pick things 
you actually like to eat so the food doesn’t go to waste. Choose varieties 
that work well in your region. Check for resistance to local diseases and 
pests too. Be sure your soil is suited to the vine you’re choosing, and find a 
sunny spot where it will perform well. Finally, make sure you provide sturdy 
support as well as a way to conveniently get to it in order to pick the fruit 
and prune.

Seeking the Super-Sustainable 
Succulents and Cacti
You either love or hate succulents and cacti. If you hate them, you don’t have 
to read this section; you’ll still be welcome in the sustainable-landscaping 
club. If you love them, you’ll discover an amazing array of shapes and forms. 
Succulents and cacti can’t be touched when it comes to sustainability. In the 
following sections, I describe how succulents and cacti function, and I also 
explain how you can choose them and use them.
Getting the scoop on succulents and cacti
Generally, succulents and cacti like sun, but some varieties tolerate shade. 
They prefer warmer climates (USDA Zones 8 to10; see Chapter 4 for details 
on hardiness zones), but some grow as far north as parts of Canada. Because 
they hold water in their tissues, they’re very drought tolerant, though many 
can accept limited regular watering under otherwise good growing condi-
tions. They use one third to one half the water of turf. Pests and diseases are 
rare; and there are few, if any, invasive varieties. Succulents and cacti are 
among the easiest, most bulletproof plants for the sustainable landscape.
Knowing what to consider 
for the succulent garden
Consider these factors before you start buying every cactus in sight:
 
✓ Placement: Locate succulents on the sunny south side of a house or 
building, where reflected heat and the warmth retained in the walls will 
help them endure cold nights. Choose a location with good air circula-
tion as well. Place thorny plants away from paths and other traffic 
patterns.
 
✓ Arrangement: Succulents and cacti rarely grow only with others of their 
kind in nature. It’s okay to have an all-succulent/cactus garden, but 
it’s okay to mix them with other kinds of plants. Just be sure to group 
them with plants that have similar water needs. Use the bold forms as 
specimen or accent plants. Silhouette them against walls. Play with the 
many foliage colors.
 
✓ Drainage: Succulent plants grew up in places with gravelly soil and fast 
internal soil drainage. Give it to them. Give them drought. Give them 
sun. Leave them the heck alone. They’ll love you for it. If you’re one of 
those people who waters every day, stay away from succulents, because 
they hate that kind of attention.

281
 Chapter 18: Enhancing Your Landscape’s Sustainability with Smaller Plants
 
✓ Feeding and watering: Go easy on the fertilizer, and apply it only during 
the active growing season (and only in small doses). However, don’t use 
it unless you see actual nutrient deficiencies. Withhold fertilizer and 
water during fall and winter.
Handling thorny plants is tricky. Succulents are much heavier than other 
plants because of the water in their tissue, so they can be top-heavy. And a 
top-heavy succulent can lead to accidents that cause you painful injury. 
Many succulents are also brittle and need to be handled with care. This is 
extreme gardening, so wear thick leather gloves, a heavy, long-sleeved shirt 
or jacket, heavy boots, and eye protection, and wrap the plants in newspaper 
or a piece of old carpeting. If you get pricked, clean the wound promptly and 
thoroughly to avoid infection.
The Best Use of Land: Growing Food
People went kind of crazy after World War II. Huge cars with tailfins, Twinkies, 
and big front lawns consumed the affections of “modern” Americans. One of 
the casualties was homegrown food, a common part of life before then. Times 
have changed again, and it’s time to get back to growing our own groceries. 
Feeding your family is the very best use of your land — and not as difficult as 
you may think.
 
When it comes to sustainability, you not only make good use of your land by 
growing food to feed your family, but you also reduce farm-to-plate transport 
from miles to feet and eliminate fossil-fuel use. Perhaps the best benefit is the 
fact that homegrown food is utterly fresh, delicious, free of pesticides, and fun 
to grow. You can enjoy varieties that are vastly more flavorful than anything 
you’ll buy at the supermarket. If you have kids, introduce them to the art of 
food growing; they may need this knowledge more than we do.
The following sections introduce the benefits of growing your own food and 
provide pointers on growing the best garden full of a variety of foods.
Picking through food-plant principles
 
Food doesn’t need to be relegated to a sad corner of the backyard as though it 
were some kind of blight. True, tomatoes and a few other crops are a bit 
homely as the season winds to an end, but most food plants are every bit as 
lovely to look at as so-called ornamentals, which of course leads to the idea 
of mixing food and ornamental plants. To me, nothing is lovelier than a 
garden filled with fruit trees; grapevines; perennial crops like asparagus and 
rhubarb; and annual crops such as lettuce, peppers, and eggplants mixed in 
with flowers and shrubs. The abundant food forest, overflowing with yummy 
edibles, has become a staple of the sustainable garden.

282
Part V: Great Greenery for a Green Garden 
Growing food doesn’t have to be labor intensive. The truly lazy gardener can 
concentrate on permanent crops, such as fruit trees and perennial veggies, 
but even annual crops can be easy if you observe a few principles:
 
✓ Prepare your soil well, but only one time. (You’ll find out why in a 
minute.) Choose a level, sunny spot for your annual crops. Make sure 
that the native soil is good, or build raised beds and import decent soil. 
Add compost and fertilizer, and water it in well.
 
✓ Select crops that you actually like to eat. Kohlrabi looks cool, but if you 
detest its flavor, it’s going to go to waste.
 
✓ Grow plants from seed (indoors to get an early start), or make things 
really easy and buy starts in six-packs. Choose organically raised 
varieties, if they’re available.
 
✓ Add balanced organic fertilizer and a little compost at planting time, and 
water your new plants as soon as they’re in the ground.
 
✓ Cover the entire area with organic mulch — prunings, purchased mulch, 
or tree chips. When spread out 3 to 4 inches thick, mulch will keep water 
in and weeds down. Mulch is the key to success without a lot of work. 
Replenish the mulch as it decomposes.
 
✓ When you want to add plants, instead of tilling or digging the whole 
area, just move bits of mulch out of the way and plant into the soil, 
replacing the mulch when you’re done. Ba-da-bing: an ecosystem!
 
Check out the Path to Freedom Web site (www.pathtofreedom.com) to find 
out what one family has done to maximize productivity on its small suburban 
lot. It’s truly astonishing how much you can harvest from the most ordinary 
property by devoting as much space as possible to food production and using 
intensive gardening practices. See the appendix for more information on 
developing a food forest.
Bringing in perennial food plants
In between annual veggies and fruit trees are the perennial crops, ones that 
live for many years without replanting. Some of them are quite familiar; 
asparagus, artichokes, and rhubarb come to mind. They go in the ground 
one time and then provide you great groceries for many years with little 
effort other than harvesting.
Perennials help build good soil; use few resources; extend the harvest season 
beyond what annuals can deliver; and can be part of a perennial polyculture, a 
diverse ecosystem of productive plants of all types. Perennial food crops 
don’t replace annual crops; they add another dimension to your food system.
 
Perennials are easy, but they aren’t perfect. Some are slow to begin producing, 
and a few can become weedy. Still, perennial food plants are worth exploring 
even if you just stick to rhubarb.

283
 Chapter 18: Enhancing Your Landscape’s Sustainability with Smaller Plants
You may be surprised by how many foods come from perennial plants other 
than the Big Three (asparagus, artichokes, and rhubarb). Depending on your 
climate, you may want to try some of these crops. Unless otherwise noted, 
these will grow in most climates and soil types (and all these are attractive 
plants that you don’t need to hide behind the garage):
 
✓ Jerusalem artichokes (not artichokes and not from Jerusalem; how this 
species got its name is a mystery)
 
✓ Chayotes (mild to moderate climates)
 
✓ Scarlet runner beans
 
✓ Bananas (for the very mildest climates only)
 
✓ Sweet potatoes (not for very cold climates)
 
✓ Ultra-drought-tolerant prickly pear cactus, which makes nutritious 
fruit; the young leaves, called pads, can be cooked as vegetables (not 
for extremely cold climates)
 
✓ Daylily flowers, which some folks eat
 
✓ Taro (if you live in a mild climate), from which you can make poi
 
✓ Bamboo shoots from specific varieties of bamboo

(www.edibleforestgardens.com) and Plants for a Future (www.

Sharing the wealth: The foodshed idea
Once you get hooked on growing your own 
food, you can take it to the next level by sharing 
the food surplus with your neighbors. Nearly 
every food gardener has a surplus now and 
then, and it often goes to waste because the 
family just can’t eat that much broccoli at one 
sitting. The answer is to organize a neighbor-
hood foodshed, which is like a watershed 
except that it’s apples and peaches and onions 
that flow to a central point in the neighborhood 
where folks gather to trade food, swap growing 
tips, watch the kids play, and make friends. 
Because the food is both grown and transported 
without the use of fossil fuels, it’s the most 
efficient way imaginable to feed people. You 
can even go a step further and tune the neigh-
borhood for a balanced diet by adding crops as 
needed and optimizing the use of the land.
Foodsheds are about much more than just food; 
they’re also about building community 
and having fun. Visit my Web site www.
owendell.com for a complete how-to on 
starting and managing your own foodshed.

Discovering the secrets of savvy farmers
Farmers work with soil and plants every day. The best of them can teach the 
home food grower a thing or two about keeping the harvest coming and the 
land healthy, not to mention how to do it without wrecking yourself in the 
process. Here’s some of the collective wisdom of sustainable agriculture:
 
✓ The farm, large or small, is an ecosystem. The interactions of plants, 
animals, insects, bacteria, fungi, soils, air, water, and minerals are 
complex, and it’s essential to understand all elements of the system, not 
just plants. In fact, by mimicking the processes of natural ecosystems, 
you’ll get better results with less work.
 
✓ Keep your eyes open. Watchfulness, keen observation, and thinking 
for yourself can make all the difference between success and failure. 
Small things, if unobserved, can cause problems.
 
✓ Feed the soil, and the soil will feed us. Keeping the soil in good health 
is the heart of good food-growing practices. Because food production 
involves extracting elements from the system (the food we eat), nutri-
ents have to be brought back in the form of compost, compost tea, 
humanure (yes, that), or organic fertilizers. Even more important, 
beneficial soil microorganisms, such as soil bacteria, mycorrhizal fungi, 
and earthworms, need to be kept in good health, because they’re the 
basis for the health of the plants. Organic farmers say, “Healthy soil 
equals healthy food equals healthy people.”
 
✓ Don’t cultivate. Turning soil usually does more harm than good. No-till 
farming practices, combined with regular use of mulches on the surface, 
protect and improve soil structure and improve yields. When you have 
decent soil in place for your mini-farm, leave it alone.
 
✓ Encourage diversity. Plant many varieties, and rotate your crops so 
they don’t deplete the soil. Include legumes, such as fava beans, that 
absorb nitrogen from the atmosphere and deliver it to the soil. Also 
include plants such as yarrow, dill, cilantro, clover, and tansy to attract 
beneficial insects that will stick around and control pests.
Growing Specialty Plants 
for Sustainable Uses
If you want to turn your property into a bastion of sustainability, make it 
work harder. Go back to our roots, to the time when people used their land 
to meet their needs, raising plants and animals that were useful to them — a 
time that included most of human history until very recently. No laws (except 

285
 Chapter 18: Enhancing Your Landscape’s Sustainability with Smaller Plants
the foolish ones that force people to grow front lawns) prevent you from 
raising plants that do something besides look pretty. Consider some of the 
things you can do with common garden plants:
 
✓ Garden goodies: Garlic, coriander, and many other plants make effec-
tive natural insecticides. Garlic is also a fungicide, as are impatiens. 
The juice of walnut leaves kills some weeds.
 
✓ Household helpers: Shampoo your hair with rose of Sharon extract, 
wash your clothes with soapwort (used since the Middle Ages), and 
repel moths with lemon rind. In the kitchen, clean the pots and pans 
with scouring rush, store things in bottle-gourd containers, and hasten 
the ripening of fruit with dandelion roots (when put in a closed space 
with the fruit, dandelion roots give off ethylene gas which initiates 
ripening).
 
✓ Building materials: If you’re really ambitious, you can grow your own 
lumber or make things from bamboo, but those options are only the 
beginning. How about building a room addition using home-grown 
cattails for insulation, Western red cedar bark for roofing, walnut-shell 
extract for wood finishing, horsetail for sandpaper, and glue made from 
garlic juice? There’s even a rust preventive made from hemlock trees!

the Other Uses page at the Web site of Plants for a Future (www.pfaf.org).
Making Use of Potted Plants
Nothing is quite as endearing as a cluster of terra cotta containers spilling 
over with a froth of colorful flowers and fascinating plant forms. Nearly every 
gardener succumbs to this temptation at some point. Many gardeners fail 
and never try again. That’s a shame, because growing potted plants doesn’t 
have to be difficult. But pots are a tough growing environment, and you have 
to know what you’re doing. This section gives you the lowdown.
Knowing when to pot and when to not
 
Unless you live where no open ground is available, don’t depend on potted 
plants to form the backbone of your landscape. No plants are native to pots, 
and most plants wouldn’t be caught dead in a pot. Well, actually, they’re 
caught dead in pots all the time; that’s the problem. A plant in a pot is slowly 
being tortured to death, because there’s just not enough root run for any but 
the smallest or most highly specialized plants.

286
Part V: Great Greenery for a Green Garden 
Still, there’s a time and place for potted plants. If your garden consists of a 
balcony or patio, pots are the only way to go. Very urban properties often 
have little soil, and the gardener turns to containers to satisfy the urge to 
grow things. Every landscape will benefit from the judicious placement of a 
few good potted plants, though, because they add a lot of charm to paved 
areas, entries, and other hardscaped places where growing plants in the 
ground is impossible. Potted plants also make the garden look finished 
because the pots themselves become an art feature. Go easy on pots, but 
indulge yourself in a few here and there.
Determining the best plants for pots
You can plant nearly anything in a pot as long as you understand the 
implications. Consider the facts about each of the following categories:
 
✓ Annuals and perennials: Annuals and perennials offer seasonal color.
 
✓ Bulbs: Bulbs can come and go without much care.
 
✓ Shrubs, fruit trees, and even vegetables: These plants all work in 
containers. They require more attention to watering and fertilizing when 
they’re potted than they would if they were in the ground, and they may 
never do quite as well as they would in the ground. If you want to keep 
them from year to year, count on repotting them every year or two.
 
✓ Succulents and cacti: Succulents and cacti are the most bulletproof 
plants for containers because they store water in their tissue, tolerate 
drought very well, seem to be okay with confinement, and won’t wilt or 
die if you neglect them now and then. Any plant with succulent tissue 
has evolved in a dry environment, where the camel-like strategy of 
holding on to water is a key to survival. They bring that strategy to your 
veranda and make life easy for you.
 
 Besides, succulents and cacti are amazingly diverse and strikingly 
(sometimes weirdly) beautiful. You can keep them in the same pot for 
years without any apparent harm, and if the kid you’re paying to water 
them while you’re on vacation forgets, the plants will be fine when you 
get home.
 
✓ Monocots: Plants in the grass, lily, iris, orchid, sedge, palm, and agave 
families (among others) are members of the class of plants called 
monocots. The name comes from the fact that germinating seeds of these 
plants have one seed leaf, the first juvenile leaf that emerges from the 
seed, called a cotyledon. For some reason, monocots are much more tol-
erant of the crowded conditions of a container than their counterparts 
the dicots (plants with two seed leaves like most shrubs, perennials, and 
annuals). This means that you can enjoy monocots in containers for a 
long time before you have to repot them. Many varieties thrive for years 
in very crowded, rootbound conditions.

287
 Chapter 18: Enhancing Your Landscape’s Sustainability with Smaller Plants
 
Avoid planting vines in pots and then training them on a wall or arbor. This 
arrangement will work for a while, but eventually you end up with a sorry-
looking mess because the vine will outgrow the pot and die on you in a highly 
visible way. Vines belong in the ground.
Caring for potted plants
As with all things sustainable, setting things up right makes living with 
container plantings much easier. And knowing what to do over the long haul 
can make a believer out of you, even if you’ve failed with pots before. Follow 
these considerations:
 
✓ Containers: If you’re buying a new container, sustainable choices 
include terra cotta (glazed or unglazed), wood, recycled plastic, or even 
the new ultra-sustainable pots made from the hulls of grain. Repurposed 
containers can be anything that strikes your fancy. I’ve seen plants in 
coffee cans, old shoes, brake drums, hollowed-out stones or tree 
stumps, clay sewer pipes, and wheelbarrows.
 
 Make sure that your container has a drainage hole in the bottom; if it 
doesn’t, carefully drill one with a masonry bit. The pot should be sturdy 
and weather-resistant. Very porous containers need watering much 
more often; sealing the inside with roof sealant helps retain water. Avoid 
moss-lined baskets, because they don’t thrive unless they’re watered 
nearly every day in summer. Putting plants in a plastic pot and then 
inside a more attractive outer pot makes care a lot easier and helps soft, 
low-fired pots last longer.
 
✓ Soil: Commercial potting soils have improved a lot over the past few 
years. Many good organic products are available. Soil for pots is lighter 
than what’s in the ground and in most cases doesn’t even contain any 
actual soil. Lightness offers fast drainage and makes it easy to move 
plants around, but it also means that the soil will dry out fast and won’t 
hold nutrients as well as heavier soils.
 
 You can add manures, compost, or real soil to commercial potting mix, 
or you can make your own from scratch. Incorporate some mycorrhizal 
fungi at planting time to bring life to the soil; this addition can make 
a huge difference. Polymers (special additives that hold water) are 
controversial; I don’t recommend them.
 
✓ Planting: Be sure that your plants are healthy and well-watered. 
Knock plants out of their pots by turning them upside down while 
holding the soil in place with your hand and then giving the top edge 
of the container a gentle tap on the edge of the pot you’ll be putting 
them into. The plants should slide right out. Check for a well-developed 
root system, discard any plants with circling roots, and give the roots 
a little back-scratch to loosen them up before sinking them into their 
new home.

288
Part V: Great Greenery for a Green Garden 
 
 As with any planting, don’t plant too deeply, and water thoroughly as 
soon as you’re done. Adding mulch on top of the soil helps save water 
and keeps the roots insulated.
 
✓ Fertilizing: Use an organic complete fertilizer. Potting soil contains few 
natural nutrients, so you have to supply everything. Quality fertilizer 
makes all the difference. Fertilize every month or so during the growing 
season (except for succulents and cacti, which need much less), or try a 
slow-release fertilizer made for pots.
 
✓ Watering: Plants in pots need watering much more often than if they 
were in the ground, and missing a watering can be the beginning of the 
end for delicate species. If you water by hand, fill the pot at least twice 
to make sure the water goes all the way to the bottom of the root ball 
and to flush out any salts that may have accumulated. Apply enough 
water so that some of it leaks out the drainage hole. If you can place 
pots in the rain now and then, they’ll really appreciate the purer water.
 
 If your pots are on an automatic irrigation system, put them on their 
own valve, and program the controller to water them at least every two 
to three days in summer (depending on the weather) unless they’re 
succulents or other very drought-tolerant varieties. Consider running 
water into a big stew pot while you’re waiting for the hot water to arrive 
at the kitchen tap and using the saved-up water for your potted plants. 
Finally, self-watering planters with a reservoir and a wicking system 
make watering a simple matter of refilling the reservoir now and then.
 
 Remember that cacti and succulents need a resting period in fall and 
winter. Bring them into a brightly lit room if you live in a cold climate, 
and protect them from rain during the cool season.

Exploring Lower Impact Lawns 
and Sustainable Lawn Alternatives
In This Chapter
▶ Critiquing the conventional lawn
▶ Making lawns less bad
▶ Relying on lawn alternatives
I
t’s time to have a look at that lawn of yours. Eighty percent of U.S. homes 
have lawns, so odds are that you’re the owner of one. You’re either stuck 
with or in love with one, wondering how you can reconcile lawn ownership 
with sustainability. No lawn will ever be 100 percent sustainable, but you can 
do plenty of things to mitigate their negative effects. Lawns even have a few 
good points.
Lawns are usually the most consumptive element in a typical landscape. But 
here’s the good news: Lawns are the low-hanging fruit on the sustainable 
tree. Getting your lawn working better goes a long way toward improving the 
sustainability of your property. I go into ecological lawn care in Chapter 22. 
For now, in this chapter, I provide you with some info on making your lawn 
more sustainable, or at least less bad.
Getting the Dirt on Lawns
If you have a lawn, you’re not alone. NASA took some photos from space 
and concluded that the United States alone has 31,630,000 acres of lawn. 
(NASA also wanted me to tell you that it’s time to clean out your gutters.) 
That’s nearly twice the size of the 100 largest U.S. cities put together. If only 
turf were a truly beneficial element of gardening, we could be proud of our 
accomplishment. (How did we get to this point, anyway? See the nearby 
sidebar “The lawns that ate America” for some background.)

290
Part V: Great Greenery for a Green Garden 
Lawns have become a symbol of consumerism gone mad, and they pretty 
much deserve their bad reputation. Check out Figure 19-1 for an idea of how 
lawns adversely affect the environment.
Despite what the lawn industry — which is made up of sod and seed produc-
ers, fertilizer manufacturers, irrigation system companies, lawn care busi-
nesses, and others — says, lawns aren’t all they’re cracked up to be. Look at 
some of the negative effects of lawns that you’ll never see in an ad for lawn 
care products:
 
✓ Air pollution: Because mowers, edgers, trimmers, and so on operate 
without smog devices, they’re responsible for at least 5 percent of U.S. 
air pollution. Each mower emits 80 pounds of carbon dioxide per year, 
generously contributing to global warming.
 
✓ Wasted water: Lawns suck water like crazy. Between 30 and 60 percent 
of urban fresh water in the U.S. is used to keep lawns alive. Lawn water 
use amounts to 270 billion gallons per week, which is three times what’s 
put on irrigated corn. It’s enough to grow 81 million acres of organic 
food. So is it better to have 31 million acres of lawn or 81 million acres of 
pure, fresh food?
The lawns that ate America
Lawns got off to a poor start. They became 
popular in the 1600s, when British landowners 
began to compete to see who could take the 
most arable land out of production and plant it 
with the brazenly useless crop of turf. The 
English climate is ideal for such a silly pursuit, 
of course, with its constant supply of moisture, 
agreeable native grasses, and plenty of sheep 
to keep the results cropped into respectability.
For a long time, lawns were exclusively for the 
privileged. But two mid-19th-century inventions, 
one coming closely on the heels of the other, 
are responsible for the stunning explosion of 
turf, especially in the New World. First, vulcani-
zation of rubber permitted the development of 
reliable garden hoses, which were essential for 
watering, especially in the drier climate of North 
America. Next, the invention of the mechanical 
lawn mower enabled the average sheepless 
homeowner to keep turf under control. The 
lawn soon became a symbol of democracy and 
prosperity, enabling the humblest suburbanite 
to enjoy the fantasy of being the lord of the 
manor.
Over time, lawns turned into an industry, and 
today $30 billion a year is spent in the U.S. just 
on professional lawn care, not to mention the 
efforts of homeowners themselves and the vast 
array of technologies that are thrown at modern 
lawns. This situation wouldn’t be so bad if it 
weren’t for the negative impacts of turf: global 
warming, noise from powered equipment, prob-
able to definite risks of cancer and other dis-
eases from turf chemicals (see the study by 
Cornell University at envirocancer.
cornell.edu/turf/index.cfm or 
visit www.chem-tox.com/pesticides), 
water and air pollution, fossil-fuel use, habitat 
destruction, soil degradation, excess water 
consumption, mountains of clippings, and golf. 
Oh. Sorry, golfers. But really, couldn’t you play 
on mulch?

✓ Overuse of fossil fuels: Each year, $5.25 billion is spent on fossil fuel–
based lawn fertilizers. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 
says that Americans burn 800 million gallons of gas in their mowers each 
year. Lawn care equipment (mowers, edgers, trimmers, and so on) 
accounts for 2 percent of American fossil fuel use.
 
✓ Excessive use of dangerous pesticides: Sixty-seven million pounds of 
synthetic pesticides go on American lawns each year. Only 35 percent of 
those pesticides actually reach the plants; the rest drifts off to do harm. 
This leads to water and air pollution, global warming, loss of wildlife and 
beneficial insects, and numerous diseases (cancer, birth defects, and 
heart disease, for example).
 
✓ Damaging fertilizers: Chemically based fertilizers are made from nonre-
newable fossil fuels and other nasty stuff. They leach into the water 
supply and kill lakes by nourishing algae blooms that suck all the oxygen 
out of the water. Unlike gentle natural fertilizers made from organic 
sources, chemical fertilizers are salts that have a terrible effect on soil 
well-being; they kill the beneficial soil microorganisms on which the 
grass depends for its health. They also disappear suddenly, leaving your 
lawn without adequate nutrients.

Part V: Great Greenery for a Green Garden 
 
✓ Harm to wildlife: Lawns are dead zones for wildlife. Compared to a 
mixed planting of trees, shrubs, perennials, and annuals, a lawn contains 
almost no biodiversity and offers little or no habitat value. Plus many 
common lawn chemicals are toxic to bees, fish, and birds. Even the 
family dog isn’t safe; there’s twice the incidence of lymphoma and 
bladder cancer in dogs that live around pesticide-treated lawns.
 
✓ Creation of green waste: A typical 1/3 acre lawn generates almost 2 tons 
of clippings a year. That’s slightly shy of 190 million tons in the U.S. 
alone. Most of that is taken away in a fossil-fuel consuming truck and put 
in a landfill where it will never again be part of a living system.
 
✓ Safety concerns: There are around 70,000 severe lawnmower accidents 
per year in the U.S. alone. Don’t believe me? Think of it this way: A 
rotary mower can fire rocks at 200 miles per hour. Also consider what 
happens when you try cleaning out the chute while the mower is still 
running.
 
✓ An abundance of noise. Stop with the racket already! Imagine your 
neighborhood on a Saturday morning without all the lawnmowers and 
blowers going at once. How peaceful that would be. Peace and quiet isn’t 
an impossible dream.
 
✓ High costs: Suppose you pay a gardener $50 a visit to mow your lawn. 
And suppose you live in a mild climate like mine where mowing is a year-
round job. If you do that for 20 years, not accounting for inflation or 
raises for the poor sucker, you’ll spend more than $50,000. This number 
doesn’t even count the water, fertilizer, sprinkler repairs, replacement, 
weed control, and all the rest.
Having said all that, however, there are a few advantages to having a lawn:
 
✓ A recent independent study found that if lawn clippings are left on the 
lawn after mowing, lawns can sequester significant quantities of carbon, 
which helps mitigate global warming — a big plus. (See the later section 
“Grasscycling” for more info.)
 
✓ Grassed areas (as long as they aren’t compacted or growing on heavy 
soil) absorb water readily, so they can soak up a lot of stormwater, 
preventing urban flooding and allowing groundwater recharge.
 
✓ They produce oxygen, cool the air, and trap dust and crud.
 
✓ Lawns don’t burn, so they’re handy if you live in a high fire hazard area.
 
✓ They’re soft and safe to play on.
 
✓ They reduce glare.
 
✓ And hey, they’re pretty.
Are these benefits justified in light of the problems that lawns create? 
Differing schools of thought exist, and no solid data takes into account the 
mitigating effects of organic lawn care.

293
 Chapter 19: Exploring Lower Impact Lawns and Sustainable Lawn Alternatives
 
Whatever the bottom line, lawns probably aren’t going away any time soon, 
if ever. It’s better not to have a lawn, but if you have one or want one, you 
can minimize its destructive effects by using one or more of the alternatives I 
present in this chapter.
Minimizing the Impact of the Lawn
You do have options. You can change your lawn and the way you manage 
it with significant positive results. Most of the changes aren’t difficult or 
expensive. Some of them are even free and result in immediate savings in 
water and labor. None of it is rocket science. In the following sections are 
some initial thoughts; visit Chapter 22 for a detailed rundown on lawn care 
the sustainable way.
Reducing its size
Consider how much turf you require. Unless you have an actual need for 
a big lawn, such as hosting regulation tackle football games, there’s no 
reason to support the typical suburban 1/3 acre of turf. Grow lawn where it 
will really be used, and use the rest of the space for perennial beds, an 
orchard, vegetable gardens, or native plantings. Your costs will go down and 
benefits will go up, and the environment will love you. Never use a lawn for 
ornamental purposes.
 
Create a long, narrow lawn that allows for most normal uses and cuts the 
unnecessary girth. A gardener I once met called this design a lap lawn.
Changing to low-maintenance grasses
You can choose from many kinds of lawn grasses, some less troublesome 
than others. As with any plant, different varieties of lawn grass vary in their 
susceptibility to pests and diseases, their need for water, their resistance to 
weeds, and their need for mowing and other care. If you’ll be installing a new 
lawn or replacing an old one, pick a low-care variety that
 
✓ Is suited to your region
 
✓ Is resistant to pests and diseases
 
✓ Uses the least amount of water possible

294
Part V: Great Greenery for a Green Garden 
Hybrid tall fescues are the current candidates in many areas, but the best 
choice varies from place to place. Talk to experienced lawn professionals 
who are familiar with local conditions.
Improving water management
Most people are overwatering their landscaping, and lawns are getting most 
of this largesse. Good water management involves a bit of education and 
some careful attention to changing conditions, not simply watering on a fixed 
schedule that ignores actual water need. Water management doesn’t cost a 
penny, and you’ll start seeing lower water bills right away. Visit Chapter 9 for 
complete information on ways to manage your water properly.
 
You have a huge opportunity to save water (and money) just by tuning up 
your lawn sprinkler system. A permanent, well-designed irrigation system is 
the most sustainable way of watering a lawn, but it has to be kept in good 
condition with regular maintenance. Simple adjustments, such as re-aiming 
heads, cleaning plugged nozzles, and moving heads to improve coverage and 
eliminate overspray onto pavement, can make a big difference. See Chapter 10 
for details.
Exploring Lawn Alternatives
Suppose that you’re ready to scrap your lawn and do something more 
sensible. Bravo! That’s a smart move, especially considering the wide of 
variety of low-maintenance alternatives that use much fewer resources after 
they’re established.
Beating the lawn police
Of all crazy things, many communities and hom-
eowner associations actually demand that 
residents own and maintain conventional lawns. 
They fine or even arrest violators, criminalizing 
those who prefer wildflowers, vegetables, 
or perennial borders over turf (as well as 
those who don’t mow often enough). Some 
homeowner associations can even lay claim 
on your property for your defiance of their 
regulations.
If you live under such oppressive conditions, 
lobby for change. Organize like-minded neigh-
bors to educate the community about the nega-
tive effects of turf and the benefits of sustainable 
landscaping, and offer good examples of beau-
tiful, sustainable lawn alternatives. If you’re up 
for it, defy the law and make an example of your 
yard. You’re sure to make people think, and 
perhaps you’ll be able to make a real difference 
in your community.

Playing with the meadow idea
Everywhere you look, people are taking out their lawns and replacing them 
with meadows. The transformation has been described as a “revolution,” and 
it’s surely one of the bright spots in modern horticulture. Instead of fertilizing 
and watering to make grass grow and then ruthlessly decapitating it every 
week with snarling fossil-powered lawn mowers, the meadow owner enjoys a 
more tousled, natural-looking turf made up of native or climate-compatible 
nonnative grasses, grass-like sedges, or herbaceous plants such as yarrow. 
Check out the fine-looking meadow in Figure 19-2.
 
Meadows have many advantages over grass lawns. Consider the following:
 
✓ Meadows need mowing rarely (or never). A sedge meadow, for exam-
ple, can be mowed a couple of times a year to freshen it up, or it can be 
left to its own devices. If you want a clipped look, many meadow plants 
can take regular mowing.
 
✓ Meadows require much less water and fertilizer than lawns do. 
Properly chosen plants that are put in favorable locations have little if 
any trouble with pests and diseases.
 
✓ Meadows can be more diverse than lawns. Meadows provide a tough, 
playable, beautiful surface as well as habitat for beneficial and native 
insects such as butterflies.

Part V: Great Greenery for a Green Garden 
Meadow plants
Meadow plants fall into three basic categories:
 
✓ Grasses: These are chosen for their attractive unmowed appearance and 
overall low maintenance. These plants can be native or otherwise as 
long as they’re easy to live with.
 
✓ Sedges: Sedges look like grasses but are in a different family of plants. 
They’re fresh looking, tolerant of a wide range of conditions, and easy 
to live with. A few species can be moderately invasive and should be 
surrounded by an underground plastic root barrier.
 
✓ Perennials: These flowering plants, such as yarrow, develop a tight turf.
 
You can (and really should) mix several kinds of plants in your meadow. 
Diversity makes any meadow a richer habitat that’s more adaptable to varying 
conditions and much more interesting to look at.
How to make a meadow
Creating a meadow isn’t much different from putting in a lawn. Soil 
preparation is the same. Here are the basics:
 
1. Kill weeds using the sheet-mulching technique described in 
Chapter 16.
 
2. Rototill the soil (one of the few times this is a good thing to do for 
your soil), incorporating an inch-thick layer of good quality compost.
 
3. Level the area and compact it gently with a lawn roller.
 
4. Install your sprinkler system.
 
 Sprinklers are the best way to water a meadow wherever there are long 
periods of drought during the growing season. Even though watering 
will be less than with a lawn, it won’t be zero.
 
5. Put in the plants.
 
 Depending on the species you choose, the plants can be planted from 
seed or small pots. In some regions, certain meadow mixes are available 
as sod.
Lawn Care For Dummies, by Lance Walheim and the National Gardening 
Association (Wiley), has all the information you need on putting in a 
new lawn.
 
Establishment of some meadow species can involve more work than a lawn 
because the plants are slower to mature, meaning that you’ll have to pull 
weeds for a while longer than usual. But that’s a small price to pay for years of 
easy care and low impact.

297
 Chapter 19: Exploring Lower Impact Lawns and Sustainable Lawn Alternatives
Meadow management
Living with a meadow is pretty easy, given that the plants in a meadow don’t 
care whether you pay much attention to them. Mowing can be challenging if 
the plants are very overgrown; a weed whacker or hand shears can work 
better than a mower in some cases.
 
As for watering meadows, try letting it go until you see signs of stress (slowing 
of growth, change in color, droopiness). I’ll bet the intervals between water-
ings will be longer than you think.
Fertilize once or twice a year, but only if growth is slow. That’s really about 
it. A meadow is supposed to be easy to maintain — and it is.
Choosing walk-on ground covers
You can use various kinds of ground covers in place of a lawn. The main 
difference between a ground cover and a meadow is the degree of traffic 
that the plants can tolerate. Meadows are fine with normal lawn use, whereas 
ground covers are better off with only occasional foot traffic, because 
they’re more easily injured or recover more slowly. Ground covers provide 
the look of a lawn where you want a broad swath of something low to set off 
other, taller plantings and where you can tolerate limited access and use.
Most ground covers offer fewer benefits and require more care than 
meadows do, but your actual experience will depend on the plants you 
choose. Look into varieties that are suited to your region and then choose 
plants that thrive in your particular conditions. Planting and establishing a 
ground cover is similar to what’s needed for a meadow. See Chapter 18 for 
more on ground covers.
Covering an area with mulch
There’s a time and place to lay off the green stuff and simply cover the earth 
with a layer of organic mulch. Mulch is a low-care surface that’s well suited to 
paths and open areas where a living element isn’t needed. Sometimes, mulch 
is a temporary solution while you’re killing weeds or waiting to decide how to 
develop a space. At other times, it’s a great permanent element in the land-
scape, offering weed control, water conservation, soil improvement, erosion 
protection, and a nice natural appearance. It’s cheap, too. Check out Chapter 
16 for the lowdown on mulch.

298
Part V: Great Greenery for a Green Garden 
Thumbs down: Avoiding phony grass
As with so many things these days, some of what passes for green materials 
is anything but. For instance, phony plastic lawns are all the rage in some 
circles. Some communities even give rebates to homeowners who replace 
their living lawns with artificial ones. Manufacturers point out that a fake 
lawn uses no water and needs no mowing, fertilizer, or pesticides.
 
Nonliving turf worsens the urban heat island effect, uses materials that are 
made from fossil fuels (and may contain toxic elements), eliminates even the 
paltry life-giving benefits of real grass, and creates a potential waste-stream 
nightmare at the end of its service. Throw in the fact that synthetic turf does 
require some water to keep it clean, contributes to stormwater pollution 
because it offers no biofiltration, and gets dangerously hot in summer, and 
you can see that plastic lawns are a very bad idea.
Living lawns are a huge part of the negative environmental impact of land-
scaping, but substituting a sea of plastic is going in the wrong direction. A far 
better alternative is to install a meadow of native grasses or other perennials. 
Better yet, put in a diverse garden of useful plants that wildlife will appreciate 
and that you’ll enjoy for food.

I
n my many decades of creating and maintaining landscaping, no client has 
ever asked me for a high-maintenance garden. Never. It’s safe to assume 
that few people see weeding, mowing, pest control, and pruning as “fun” 
lifestyle elements, yet people accept these chores as though they had no 
choice. Even avid gardeners grow weary of some of the maintenance tasks 
their gardens require.
Most everyone accepts the myth that a proper garden needs a lot of care and 
nurturing, but such high maintenance is unnecessary. Instead of playing 
God with your landscape — pruning things into submission, deciding what 
lives and what dies, and arranging your little world just the way you want — 
sustainable gardening recognizes that your garden is part of a larger, natural 
system.
In this chapter, you discover sustainable maintenance techniques that affect 
the environment and your pocketbook less, yet still deliver the beautiful 
landscape you’re longing for.

300
Part V: Great Greenery for a Green Garden 
Understanding the Importance 
of Sustainable Maintenance
Nonsustainable maintenance affects the environment, your pocketbook, and 
you personally in several ways:
 
✓ The annual 60 trillion British thermal units (Btu) of energy used to mow 
lawns in America is equivalent to 200 billion hours of human work.
 
✓ Eighty percent or more of the total cost of a conventional landscape 
goes to maintaining it over a 20-year lifespan. That’s tens of thousands 
of dollars or more that you don’t really need to spend.
 
✓ Fertilizer-laden water seeps into groundwater and runs off to pollute 
streams and destroy lakes.
 
✓ Pesticides blow away during application to affect what the chemical 
industry politely calls nontargeted recipients, such as kids in their 
classrooms, beneficial insects, and wildlife.
 
✓ Pesticides also volatilize (a fancy way of saying that they evaporate), 
causing air pollution.
 
✓ Howling motors annoy whole neighborhoods.
A sustainable landscape, by contrast, exists in a peaceful state within its 
boundaries and causes no harm to others. The strongest smell escaping 
from it is the fragrance of the freesias; the loudest noise comes from the 
songbirds.
Minimizing Maintenance 
with Sustainable Design
Natural ecosystems don’t need maintenance. You don’t see anybody out in 
the wilds pruning, fertilizing, or weeding nature; it takes care of itself! 
Nature’s got that homeostatic edge — the natural balance of forces that 
keeps things from falling apart.
Compare that with what would happen if you left your landscaping unat-
tended for a while. Suppose you were to put a chain link fence around your 
property, turn off the utilities, walk out, and lock the gate. What do you think 
the place would look like if you came back after one year without any care 
whatsoever: no watering, no fertilizing, no mowing, and no pruning? If you 
answered, “It would look like crap,” you’d likely be right. Most landscapes 

301
 Chapter 20: Examining the Essentials of Sustainable Garden Care
need constant attention to prevent the forces of entropy from tearing them 
apart. Think about it. Without watering, plants would die. Without pruning, 
some plants would grow completely out of bounds and smother smaller ones. 
Without pest and disease control, weak plants would soon succumb.
What’s different about landscaping that it needs so much attention? The 
answer is that most landscaping hasn’t been set up according to the rules of 
nature. It’s created without much thought for what’s required to keep it in 
one piece. Flimsy structures, inefficient irrigation systems, plants that are 
too big for the spaces they’re in or that are prone to diseases — all these 
factors add up to a battleground, with the hapless homeowner in the middle. 
More important, the system as a whole is dysfunctional because the inter-
relationships of elements aren’t present or aren’t working.
 
The poor, nonsustainable design of most landscapes increases the need for 
maintenance. That’s a shame, because the following simple rules of sustain-
able design make life easier for the gardener as well as for the garden:
 
✓ Plants are selected for their overall reliability and for their compatibility 
with local conditions: soil, climate, microclimate, and watering regimen.
 
✓ Plants are given room to grow so that they don’t need to be pruned to 
control size.
 
✓ Plants are drought tolerant and pest resistant.
 
✓ Plants are long-lived to minimize the need for periodic replacements.
 
✓ Plants have been inoculated at planting time with mycorrhizal fungi to 
help them work more efficiently.
 
✓ The irrigation system is built to match the soil and plants.
 
✓ Watering is facilitated by a smart controller or by a good management 
plan for a conventional controller or manual system.
 
✓ Mulch covers the earth to help keep the water in, keep weeds down, 
and preserve the soil’s well-being.
 
✓ Hardscape elements, such as patios, walls, and other structures, 
are designed for minimal care with no need for special cleaning or 
refinishing.
 
✓ Hardscape elements are built to last for decades (or longer).
 
In a properly designed garden, maintenance is a steady series of small tweaks, 
not violent blitzes of hyperactivity. To tune up your maintenance routine, 
make a list with two columns. Put the gardening work you love in one column 
and the gardening work you hate in the other. Use the rules of sustainable 
landscaping to eliminate as many of the items in the second list as possible. 
Set up a smoothly functioning landscape system — an ecosystem. Then put 
the fate of the garden in the hands of nature, relegating yourself to the role of 
gentle nurturer — an assistant, not the boss. Your services will still be needed, 

302
Part V: Great Greenery for a Green Garden 
but in smaller quantities. You can enjoy the garden instead of struggling with 
it. You’ll save money, too! See Part II of this book to learn more about how to 
design a sustainable landscape that really works over the long haul.
Purging Your Power Equipment 
to Please the Planet
When I show people what I use to maintain my garden, they stare in disbelief. 
I love tools, and over the years I’ve owned nearly everything made for 
gardening and landscaping work. But can you guess what I use in my own 
garden? A pair of hand pruning shears, a small trowel, and sometimes a 
weeding tool known as an asparagus knife. Oh, I have other tools. I use a 
shovel to plant big things, and a hose to water. I have lots of stuff out in the 
garage, and once in a while I actually use something for a special task. But 
mostly, the pruning shears and the trowel are it. Together, they cost around 
$80. I have to laugh when I look at these gardening catalogs full of gadgets 
that I have no use for.
Then there’s power equipment. Do you need to eliminate it from your tool 
kit if you want to garden sustainably? The best answer is that by creating a 
sustainable garden, you’ve eliminated so much of the usual work that 
tools — both manual and powered — are much less necessary.
 
When you face a laborious task, ask yourself whether hand tools will get it 
done without much fuss. If you truly need the help of modern technology, 
choose a newer model that complies with current efficiency and pollution 
standards, and rent or share tools with neighbors if you can.
To help you power down, in the following sections I discuss the impacts that 
power equipment has on the environment and your pocketbook. I also give 
you some good alternatives to power tools.
Understanding the effects of power tools
Some of the most pernicious elements of the maintenance picture are power 
lawn and garden tools: mowers, blowers, chain saws, string trimmers, 
and the like. Add up the effects of fossil fuel use, air pollution, noise, health 
problems, injuries (to you and your plants), and the infrastructure that 
supports mechanized garden care, and you have a real mess.

303
 Chapter 20: Examining the Essentials of Sustainable Garden Care
It’s true that power equipment saves a lot of hand labor, but when you take 
the work of manufacturing, maintaining, and paying for it, much of its alleged 
efficiency disappears in a cloud of exhaust smoke. It’s also true that the gas 
engines that power this equipment have become cleaner and quieter, but 
that’s only because the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ordered manu-
facturers to improve the dismal record of their products. And there’s still a 
long way to go.
Adjusting to alternatives for 
power garden equipment
I don’t have a lawn — just a tiny meadow that I never mow. I have a vine on 
the house that I shear back (with electric hedge trimmers) once or twice a 
year. If I got rid of that vine, I wouldn’t need the hedge trimmers. Believe me, 
it’s tempting. I practice chop and drop, and I mulch, so there’s no need for a 
string trimmer. I never turn over the soil, even in my vegetable garden, so I 
don’t need a rototiller. I get more food than I could ever eat without lifting a 
finger except to plant the little fellers and pick the produce. Perhaps you 
have more work to do in your garden than I do. That’s cool. I understand. But 
I bet that in most cases, you’ll still do fine without power tools.
The Cheat Sheet lists some simple sustainable choices to replace power 
equipment. Some of these options take more effort to use but have a much 
lower impact when you look at the big picture.
Going with green cleanup gear
One piece of power equipment — the leaf blower — is particularly galling to 
many people. Here’s a little advice that will make your life easier and keep 
you out of trouble with the neighbors and wild-eyed enviros like me: No 
blowers. Let me say that again. No bloody blowers, okay? There may be a 
legitimate use for these growling, pollution-flatulating, dinosaur-juice-sucking, 
dust-cloud-making, disease-spreading little contraptions, but I’ll be darned 
if I know what it is.
 
Ordinary housekeeping tasks, such as cleaning pavement, can be done with 
time-honored gear: a rake, a broom, or even a palm frond. The only energy 
they use is yours, and unless you sing while you work, they’re pretty quiet. If 
hardscape surfaces drain into planter beds that could use the water, feel free 
to hose them off, especially if you use a low-volume nozzle. If the water would 
go into the street or a drain and be wasted, use a broom.

304
Part V: Great Greenery for a Green Garden 
Pruning Established Plants
I love to prune. It’s a way of making a plant look more graceful without 
imposing much on its basic character. When you get hooked on real pruning, 
you’ll never butcher another innocent plant.
Unless you’re doing topiary or clipping a formal hedge, pruning is not about 
sculpting plants into shapes: It’s about developing a sturdy, healthy, graceful 
branching structure and allowing the natural form of the plant to express 
itself with just a little help from you.
You can’t achieve this goal by standing outside the plant with a clattering 
hedge trimmer in your hands; you have to stick your head, or your whole 
self, inside the plant and prune from there, using pruning shears to remove 
offending growth one branch at a time. Very few people, professional garden-
ers included, have any idea how to do this. So you’re about to become one 
of the in crowd (or perhaps it’s the in-the-shrubbery crowd). The following 
sections describe the proper way to prune.
 
First, make sure that your tools are sharp and well adjusted. Do most of your 
pruning in winter or spring, depending on the type of plant, but remove 
damaged or dangerous branches at any time. Look up specific information on 
the species you’re working on, because pruning techniques vary from one 
plant to another. When trees grow too big for you to prune safely, put them in 
the hands of a certified arborist (see the “When it’s grown: Involving an 
arborist” section later in this chapter).
Examine the subject
First, take a long look at the plant, inside and out. Identify branches that are 
damaged, weak, crossing, or growing out of bounds (refer to Figure 17-3 
in Chapter 17 to see how unhealthy tree branches look; this applies equally 
to smaller plants). Decide whether you’ll be making major changes such 
as removing large limbs, or simply opening the interior and improving the 
structure.
 
In most cases, the less pruning you do, the better. You’re gently nudging 
the plant toward its own perfection, not brutalizing it into a form of your 
choosing. Pruning is collaboration, not war.

305
 Chapter 20: Examining the Essentials of Sustainable Garden Care
Do the big stuff first
Take out any major branches that are problematic because of size, condition, 
or shape. Be sure that you want them out, because they’re not easy to put 
back on. Figure 20-1 shows you how to cut large branches safely without 
harming yourself or the plant.
 
Big limbs are a lot heavier than you might think, and there’s a danger of injury, 
so let a pro do the pruning work if you aren’t certain whether you can handle 
it. If you do make a big cut, don’t seal it with anything; sealing is ineffective 
and can even seal in problems.
If you have shrubs that send many canelike branches up from ground level, 
you can refresh them by cutting up to 1/3 of the branches to the ground. This 
will bring new vigor to a weakly-growing shrub.

Pay attention to details
Your goal is to open the center of the plant and create a graceful branch 
structure. Do this by thinning out the inner structure of the plant, removing 
smaller branches and twigs that are dead, weak, or growing toward the 
center of the plant. Remove as little living foliage as possible — never more 
than f1/3 of the total and ideally much less. A before-and-after example is 
shown in Figure 20-2. Don’t cut too close to a bud; leave a short bit of stem 
just above it (see Figure 20-3).

opposite buds, make
a straight cut directly
above the two buds.

alternating buds, make
a diagonal cut just above
the outward facing bud.
Prune to increase density
Some plants respond well when you cut just the tip growth back to a bud, 
as shown in Figure 20-4. This technique, which makes the plant fuller and 
more compact, is known as heading back. But do this only if you really 

307
 Chapter 20: Examining the Essentials of Sustainable Garden Care
want a tighter plant; in most cases, this practice ruins the natural form, 
and it may disrupt flowering on plants that bloom at the ends of their 
branches.

Treat fruit trees differently
Each type of fruit-bearing tree has its own pruning requirements, and it’s 
important to prune these trees properly so you get a good crop of fruit. This 
subject is beyond the scope of this book; visit www.ces.ncsu.edu/depts/

The formal sheared hedge has its place in the sustainable landscape. True 
sustainable hedge care requires holding a small goat up to the hedge while it 
gnaws the hedge into the proper form. If you don’t have a goat, try hand 
hedge clippers. Electric hedge trimmers are okay, especially if your house is 
equipped with solar power. Gas-powered hedge trimmers aren’t okay, but 
you already knew that.
 
Shear hedges so the sides are slanted inward, with the top narrower than the 
bottom (see Figure 20-5). That way, the surface receives more sunlight, and 
the hedge plants do better.

When it’s grown: Involving an arborist
Trees quickly grow beyond the ability of a home gardener to care for them 
safely and effectively. It’s best to hire a professional to perform an annual 
tree health and safety inspection, checking for signs of damage, disease, 
dangerous limbs, and poor growing conditions. If work is needed, instead of 
trying to save a little money by doing it yourself, let a pro handle it.
 
Anyone with a chainsaw can claim to be a tree expert, but real professionals 
are certified by the International Society of Arboriculture (ISA), the Tree Care 
Industry Association (TCIA), or the American Society of Consulting Arborists 
(ASCA). Don’t jeopardize your trees by putting them in the hands of a self-
appointed expert. Real arborists have to pass rigorous exams for their certifi-
cation. Ask to see their credentials, get a certificate of insurance so that you’re 
protected if an accident occurs, and of course get a written estimate. To find 
out more, visit: ISA (www.isa-arbor.com); TCIA (www.natlarb.com); 
ASCA (www.asca-consultants.org).
 
If a tree “expert” advises you to top a tree, send him packing. Topping is the 
practice of whacking the upper portion of limbs off to make the tree smaller. 
This practice is discredited, and no qualified professional proposes it. 
Topping trees ruins their structure and creates the danger of falling limbs. A 
tree that has grown too big can be controlled by crown reduction, which is a 
non-harmful pruning technique for making a tree smaller.

Forgoing Fertilizer: The Fine 
Art of Chop and Drop
The traditional cycle of “fertilize, grow, prune, dispose of the prunings, and 
fertilize some more” is wasteful, expensive, and damaging to the environ-
ment. Americans put more fertilizer on their landscaping than is used in all 
the world’s underdeveloped countries to grow food. It’s shameful, especially 
considering how unnecessary it is.
A sustainable garden doesn’t get pushed hard to grow only so you can cut it 
all down and throw it away. Plants can live quite well on their own droppings. 
This is nature’s way: stuff falls off the plant and returns to the system. 
Hauling it away and then importing synthetic fertilizers is cuckoo. True, there 
are times when you should fertilize (to give your plants a boost or to stimu-
late growth of young plants). But if you help the plant recycle its own waste, 
it will reward you with steady, healthy growth.
 
One of the key elements in sustainable maintenance is not allowing anything 
to escape from the system. Rather than bag up your prunings, keep them 
on site to cycle the valuable nutrients they contain back into the soil. The 
laborious way to recycle pruning debris is to compost it, but even that’s 
working too hard. The easy way is to cut the leftovers into little pieces as you 
prune and allow them to fall directly at the feet of the plant that produced 
them. I call this practice chop and drop. It’s a silly way of reminding myself that 
stuff that grew in Spot A should remain in Spot A. Chop and drop keeps the 
nutrient loop very tight and minimizes effort on your part.
Chop and drop saves labor in addition to saving money. Yes, you do have to 
cut things up, but because you’re helping to form a mulch layer, you’ll weed 
and water much less. And you won’t have to dispose of the stuff or spread 
fertilizers (or work to pay for them).
 
I should acknowledge that hacked-up plant parts can look less than properly 
suburban. If you can’t stand the appearance, cover the choppings with 
nicer-looking mulch, such as bark or chips. Or stuff your choppings beneath 
the skirts of the plants where they can do their thing unseen.
If you do fertilize, use organic fertilizers that come from natural, renewable 
sources and that are gentler on the plants and soil microorganisms. Visit 
Chapter 16 for more on this.

Weeds Be Gone: Managing Weeds 
without Hurting the Environment
The conventional gardener turns to chemical herbicides and violent prac-
tices to eliminate weeds. Because growing conditions in a conventional 
garden are often hospitable to weeds, all the weeding in the world won’t 
keep them from coming back. The sustainable way is to change the 
conditions, which allows you to enjoy a weed-free ecosystem with little or 
no effort.
Getting to know weeds
Weeds are plants that people moved from one place to another on the 
backs of domestic animals, in soil used as ballast on ships, or as imported 
garden or farm plants that didn’t know where the property lines were. Some 
weeds are native, but most are imported. Knowing all this doesn’t change 
the fact that weeds will enter your life even if you have the most sustainable 
landscape on the planet.
 
Weeds are ultra-successful plants. They grow fast, out-compete more delicate 
plants, suck all the water, and make lots and lots of babies. Some weeds 
even poison the soil around themselves so that nothing else will grow. Weeds 
kick butt.
Creating an unfriendly environment 
for weeds
We have weeds because we create situations in which they feel at home. In 
these situations weeds encounter the thing they love most: open ground. 
Weeds see open ground and they just giggle with delight, and then they get 
to work procreating.
Weeds do the job of pioneering in open space, to be succeeded by later, 
larger plants that form a more stable long-term plant community. In this fact 
lies the answer to the problem of weeds: Create the stable plant community, 
and the weeds won’t show up because their niche is already filled. If you 
don’t believe it, just look at where the weeds grow. You won’t find many in 
unfavorable locations with dense permanent growth.

311
 Chapter 20: Examining the Essentials of Sustainable Garden Care
Trying out types of weed controls
Here are some great strategies that really work. Use them, and your weed 
problem will gradually decline to nearly nothing. Really.
 
✓ Physical controls: Use plants that are at least knee-high for most of 
your landscaping. Maintain a 3- to 4-inch-deep layer of organic mulch 
in all beds and open areas. To get rid of a strong stand of established 
weeds, sheet mulch the area. (Visit Chapter 16 for details on sheet 
mulching.) Use a drip system (see Chapter 8) to keep as much of the 
soil surface dry as possible. Pull weeds when they’re young and before 
they set seed.
 
✓ Biological controls: Goats, geese, ducks, chickens, and other browsing 
animals eat weeds (as well as desirable plants). So do certain insects for 
a limited range of weed species. You can even find mycoherbicides — 
fungi that destroy weeds.
 
✓ Chemical controls: You probably know the name of a certain herbicide 
that seems to work very well. (I would never mention it in a family book 
like this one.) People love it. It’s a lot more hazardous than you’ve 
been told, however. What’s more, after 30 years of using it in massive 
quantities worldwide, we seem to have as many weeds as ever. Does it 
sound like something’s wrong? There is.
 
 You don’t need that harsh chemical stuff. Sheet mulching works better. 
If you want to kill existing weeds, spray them with horticultural vinegar 
(this is a strong acid so be careful when you apply it), or use corn 
gluten meal to suppress the development of weed seedlings, including 
crabgrass. (See Chapter 22 for the full scoop.)
Bundle Up: Winterizing Your Plants
 
The best strategy for helping your plants to get through the winter in good 
health is to make sure they’re hardy enough to tolerate local worst case 
conditions. But sometimes even sustainable plantings need help with this.
For example, young plants need special protection for the first few winters. 
Provide burlap screens for wind and frost protection (see Figure 20-6), and 
maintain winter mulch around young plants. Wrapping the trunks and main 
branches of young trees and shrubs to protect against sunscald can create 
more problems than it solves; use wrapping judiciously, and remove it as 
soon as conditions permit. Make a tent of boards to prevent snow loads from 
damaging delicate plants.

Some plants that keep their leaves all year can dry out in winter. Protect 
them with a cover of evergreen boughs or an antidesiccant spray.
 
If extreme conditions are coming, treat even established plants as you would 
young ones. To prevent breakage, knock snow off limbs before it freezes. Low 
spots and open ground are colder than south-facing walls and the spaces 
under eaves. Cold air flows to low places just the same as water, so you can 
predict where the coldest places will be by looking at your land. Exploit 
warmer microclimates by planting less hardy varieties there. Prepare your 
plants for frost by not fertilizing from late summer onward and by keeping soil 
moist as frost approaches.

Chapter 21
Pest and Disease Control 
the Sustainable Way
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding pest management basics
▶ Controlling insect pests
▶ Keeping animals in check
▶ Dealing with diseases
A
 sustainable garden starts with good design, including plants that are 
well adapted to your conditions and inherently resistant to pests and 
diseases. A sustainable garden also includes healthy soil teeming with good 
microorganisms that help fight bad things. But plants do get stuff, and when 
they get stuff, you have to deal with it. Pests and diseases don’t run rampant 
through a healthy ecosystem; they’re signs of out-of-balance conditions. 
Correct those conditions and the problems probably will go away.
Animals, however, will run rampant through most any ecosystem. They can 
be infuriating to deal with, yet some animals are welcome in the sustainable 
garden. In fact, most animals are a mix of good and bad. For instance, moles 
eat troublesome soil-dwelling pests but also damage lawns with their 
mounds. And of course native animals have a right to coexist with us. There 
are ways to live with the animals rather than exterminate them. This chapter 
tells you how to manage pests, diseases, and animals the sustainable way.
Integrated Pest Management: The Smart 
Way to Deal with Problems
Integrated pest management (IPM) is a strategy for dealing with pest and 
disease problems in an intelligent, nontoxic way. It consists of regular, 
careful monitoring of the garden ecosystem to identify unhealthy conditions, 

314
Part II: Great Greenery for a Green Garden 
coupled with a stepped approach that starts with the least-toxic method and 
moves up the scale only if necessary. You need to know a great deal about 
the problem to control it effectively with IPM — you can’t just spritz toxic 
pesticides all over the yard. IPM consists of these steps:
 
1. Improve growing conditions and eliminate whatever caused the prob-
lem. By cutting back on fertilizer use, for example, you reduce soft-tissue 
growth and make plants less susceptible to aphids and sucking insects.
 
2. Try simple mechanical actions like washing pests off with a jet of water 
or using sticky barriers to keep pests out of trees.
 
3. If the pests crawl back, more draconian methods come into play. 
Release beneficial insects or apply microbial controls.
 
4. Only if the first three steps fail, consider using least-toxic sprays.
 
5. If all else fails, replace sickly plants with something sturdier.
Controlling Creepy-Crawlies
Instead of using hazardous pesticides in your garden, opt for insect 
management that involves the three Ps:
 
✓ Predators: Beneficial insects that eat pests
 
✓ Parasites: Beneficial insects that lay eggs on pests (the eggs hatch and 
destroy the pests)
 
✓ Pathogens: Diseases that kill the pests but not your plants
 
The strategy you choose depends on the particulars of the situation. Work 
with local IPM practitioners until you get a feel for how the system works. 
Look for a pest control company that uses the terms “IPM” or “organic” in 
their advertising, and insist on nontoxic approaches.
Understanding problems with 
conventional pest control
The more pesticides you use, the more pests you have. Insects breed so 
rapidly that new generations are quickly born with natural resistance to the 
pesticides. The chemical industry constantly battles to come up with new 
formulations that will outevolve the pests — and it isn’t winning. Add to this 
the toxic legacy of so many often-unregulated and untested chemicals, and 
you have cause for concern about conventional approaches to keeping pests 
at bay.

315
 Chapter 21: Pest and Disease Control the Sustainable Way
 
Because of the inherent dangers involved, the use of pesticides by licensed 
professionals and farmers is highly regulated. Yet many of the same chemicals 
that require application permits and recordkeeping when used by pros can be 
applied by untrained homeowners with no oversight. Keep in mind that just 
because you can buy something at the nursery doesn’t necessarily mean that 
it’s safe. For detailed info, including an extensive database of toxicity informa-
tion on pesticides, visit the Pesticide Action Network North America Web site 
at www.panna.org.
Beneficials are your buddies: Getting 
to know the good insects
Beneficial insects feed on or parasitize harmful insects. Most everyone knows 
that ladybugs eat aphids, but ladybugs are only the beginning. One of the 
most voracious predators is the green lacewing, which is omnivorous and 
easy to establish in your garden. Other good beneficials include parasitic 
wasps, which feed on aphids, whiteflies, caterpillars, and other insects; 
beneficial beetles, which eat mealybugs and scale; and mites that eat thrips.
As long as you don’t spray pesticides in your yard, some beneficial insects 
are already present. If the native populations aren’t sufficient to take care of 
problems, you can buy beneficials from nurseries or insectaries.
 
Before introducing anything to your garden, find out exactly what insects 
you have by taking samples to your local cooperative extension office for 
identification. Then work with a supplier to choose an appropriate beneficial. 
Beneficials have to be released properly to survive and do their jobs. Get 
specific release information when you purchase your beneficials.
You can also plant to attract beneficial insects. Common edibles such as dill, 
caraway, cilantro, and fennel feed the good bugs as well as you. Ornamentals 
work too; cosmos, yarrow, tansy, alyssum, evening primrose, and others 
attract lacewings, ladybugs, parasitic wasps, and other beneficials.
Using beneficials takes a little thought, but discovering this hidden aspect of 
life on your property is fascinating, and this technique really works. For 
interesting reading on beneficial insects, visit a pioneering insectary’s Web 
site: Rincon-Vitova Insectaries at www.rinconvitova.com.
Making use of microbial controls
Microbial insecticides are diseases (aka pathogens) that kill pests. A common 
example is Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), which kills various species of caterpil-
lars. Bt is easy to apply, harmless (unless you’re a caterpillar), and very 
effective.

316
Part II: Great Greenery for a Green Garden 
 
Each microbial is specific to particular pests. So, as with beneficial insects, 
you need to carefully match one to the other. Find out if microbial controls 
are effective against your particular pest by asking your local nursery what it 
recommends.
Using least-toxic pesticides carefully
Insecticidal soaps, oil sprays, and botanical pesticides (made from plants) 
are examples of pesticides that have low toxicity to nontarget organisms, 
such as you and your family, birds, and other wildlife. They’re handy for 
spot treatments of serious outbreaks where resident beneficials aren’t up 
to the job.
 
Use least-toxic chemicals carefully, because they can kill beneficials too. Also, 
regular dependence on these pesticides — even relatively safe ones — can 
cause pest populations to develop resistance to the pesticides. Also, be sure 
to always follow label instructions when you use any pesticide.
Dealing with common pests: 
An insect-by-insect guide
There are many pests, of course, but there are also many sustainable 
strategies for dealing with them. Here are some of the main pests of home 
gardens and some tips for dealing with them:
 
✓ Ants: Ants prefer to nest in dry-baked soil, so mulching can be an excel-
lent strategy. Try insect growth regulators or nontoxic baits containing 
boric acid or diatomaceous earth (an abrasive material).
 
✓ Aphids: These insects are prolific yet relatively easy to control with 
natural enemies, such as ladybugs, lacewings, and syrphid flies. Avoid 
overfertilization, prune away highly infested plant parts, and control 
ants (which farm aphids, increasing their populations).
 
✓Cutworms and grubs: Birds and predatory insects feed on these bugs. 
If that tactic fails, use Bt insecticide, neem oil, or beneficial nematodes.
 
✓ Japanese beetles: Treat with milky spore disease or parasitic nema-
todes.
 
✓ Mealybugs: Control ants, avoid harming natural predators, introduce 
predatory insects, and spot-treat with insecticidal soap or oil.
 
✓ Scales: Encourage natural enemies by avoiding pesticides and planting 
flowering plants for habitat. Oil sprays can be effective, but timing is 
critical; check with your nursery for details.

317
 Chapter 21: Pest and Disease Control the Sustainable Way
 
✓ Snails and slugs: Use a nontoxic bait that breaks down into fertilizer. Or 
try putting some beer in a pie pan or special bait station. The snails and 
slugs get smashed, party down, and die.
 
✓ Thrips: Introduce natural enemies, such as predatory mites, and avoid 
shearing or overfertilization, which produces soft, vulnerable growth.
 
✓ Whiteflies: These insects can be difficult to control, but parasitic wasps 
can keep populations down. Insecticidal soaps and oils also help.
Critters! Sensible Vertebrate Control
Think of nuisance animals as big bugs with backbones. What insects do on a 
small scale, animals do in broad sweeps. Nothing tests the gentle gardening 
spirit like a raccoon attack on the pond or a visit by hungry gophers. 
Integrated pest management (which I introduce earlier in the chapter) 
applies to big pests too.
Gophers, moles, and voles
Gophers till the soil and aren’t all bad, but they can be among the most 
destructive and irritating garden pests. It’s no fun to watch your prize 
kohlrabi get sucked underground in front of your eyes. Enclose plants in 
chicken wire cylinders with openings no smaller than 1 inch (use bottomless 
cylinders for woody plants so their roots will escape and not be choked by 
the wire). Surround beds with an underground fence of hardware cloth, which 
is a welded wire mesh. Pit gopher snakes or cats against gophers; plant daffo-
dils or oleanders around your property; or if all else fails, trap the beasts.
 
Daffodils and oleanders are poisonous to people and pets too, however, so 
use them with care.
Moles are actually beneficial, eating grubs and other soil insects. Leave them 
alone unless they’re really damaging your lawn by making raised mounds. 
Sadly, there’s no proven nonviolent way to control moles. They scoff at 
noisemakers, stinky repellents, and other kindly approaches. They can only 
be deterred by trapping. If you feel that murder and sustainability are com-
patible, set out two or more mole traps along an active run. Or let natural 
predators, such as owls or neighborhood cats, do your dirty work.
Voles are more aggressive and can harm plants. Repel them with commercial 
repellents or predator urine, exclude them with wire barriers, or trap them in 
a humane trap and release them in a faraway field.

318
Part II: Great Greenery for a Green Garden 
Rats! (and mice)
I wish I had better news, but there’s no nice way to deal with rats and mice. 
You have only a few nonlethal options:
 
✓ Good housekeeping: Keeping your property clean helps minimize the 
problem. Eliminate piles of junk and thick vines where rodents like to 
hang out, and don’t leave pet food outdoors.
 
✓ Barriers: Use wire screens to close off openings to the house.
 
✓ Security: Close the pet door at night.
But when it comes to really getting rid of these critters, it’s no more Mr./Ms. 
Warm-’n-Fuzzy Ecoperson. You have to kill them. With traps. Don’t use bait 
unless you want to poison your pets and wildlife. As for repellents, what in 
creation would ever repel a rat?
 
Putting up an owl box — a manmade nest for one of the greatest killers of 
all time — helps to a point. To find out how to build an owl box, visit www.
owlpages.com.
Raccoons and other medium-size critters
Vertebrate pests, as the pros call the medium-size critters, can be exasperat-
ing. Some can be adorable too: fuzzy little bunnies that eat your plants and 
bushy-tailed ground squirrels that undermine your patio. They were here 
first, and we have no right to exclude native animals from our environment. 
Some species, such as raccoons, opossums, and skunks, seem to be making a 
comeback in many neighborhoods as they adapt to a changed environment. I 
believe that they have rights and that their contributions to the suppression 
of still smaller pests need to be taken into account. Still, we gardeners need 
to set some boundaries. Consider the following options for nontoxic control:
 
✓ Remove attractions such as pet food from outdoor areas.
 
✓ Eliminate den sites near the house by cleaning up brush and wood piles.
 
✓ Place fencing around vulnerable plantings, such as veggie beds.
 
✓ Chase them off with special motion-sensing sprinkler heads.
 
✓ Spray repellents or predator pee around the yard.
 
✓ Trap them or call your community’s animal control department for help.
 
✓ Get a dog (or, I’m told, a llama) to keep animals at bay.

319
 Chapter 21: Pest and Disease Control the Sustainable Way
Deer and other macrovertebrates
Macrovertebrates, such as deer, moose, and elk, can make a real mess of a 
garden, especially when drought or fire deprives them of their customary 
wild food sources. A determined animal can be difficult to stop, but some 
strategies work against them:
 
✓ Unpopular plants: Choose plants they don’t like; you can find lists of 
these plants in gardening books and on Web sites.
 
✓ Barriers: Protect browsable plants by placing sturdy wire cages or 
netting around the plants, or string fishing line across the animals’ paths 
to trip them up and spook them. Two 4- to 5-foot tall fences running 
parallel to each other and spaced 3 to 5 feet apart can keep deer out of 
an area pretty reliably.
 
✓ Smelly substances: Try repellents containing chili peppers, rotten eggs, 
and other nasty substances. Other things that sometimes work are bars 
of Irish Spring soap (its unique fragrance is not well loved by deer), baby 
powder, fabric-softener sheets, and predator urine. Most of these items 
are easy to use, but if you’re planning to get your own urine sample 
from the neighborhood mountain lion, you may want to think twice. 
Believe it or not, wild-animal pee is for sale at progressive nurseries and 
online. Choose urine that matches that of local predators the deer know 
and fear.
 
You’re dealing with smart animals here. They’ll quickly get wise to your tricks, 
so plan on changing tactics regularly. For more on deer management, visit 
attra.ncat.org/attra-pub/deercontrol.html#exclu.
Putting Yourself on Disease Control
Diseases can be tricky to control. Sometimes a plant collapses suddenly and 
you can’t determine the cause. Disease organisms are present everywhere all 
the time; only when conditions become favorable for them do they go into 
action. Many soil pathogens, for example, wait for soil that’s warm and wet at 
the same time; they’re harmless unless both conditions are present.
 
The best way to prevent disease outbreaks is to choose resistant plants and 
then eliminate any conditions that are conducive to problems. These include 
over- or underwatering; poor soil conditions, such as heavy or badly-draining 
soil; bad air circulation; and too much shade for sun-loving plants (and vice 
versa). Diseases will attack stressed plants first.

320
Part II: Great Greenery for a Green Garden 
Fungi good and bad
If you’ve read Chapter 16, you know how important fungi are, especially 
mycorrhizal fungi that team up with your plants to improve their uptake of 
water and nutrients. Most fungi are essential. Without them, the planet would 
have long ago been buried in undecomposed waste. Still some fungi, such as 
Phytophthora root rot and oak root fungus, attack living plants, causing 
decline and even death. Some fungi are really nasty and can be very difficult 
or (I hate to have to tell you) impossible to control.
 
Most fungus attacks result from poor growing conditions. Change the 
growing conditions, and in many cases you might eliminate the problem. For 
example, overwatering gives a big thumbs-up to wicked little fungi, such 
as phytophthora root rot, oak root fungus, pythium, and others. The fungi 
are always present in the soil, waiting for conditions favorable to their 
development. Change your habits, give the plants what they need, and the 
fungi will disappear like the Wicked Witch of the West.
One promising new approach for controlling soil-borne fungal diseases 
involves applying bacterial inoculants to the soil. These inoculants take up 
space that otherwise would be occupied by fungi. A healthy soil food web is 
no place that harmful fungi want to hang out.
Fungi are proving to be among the most useful living things. For a fascinating 
look, check out Mycelium Running: How Mushrooms Can Help Save the World 
(Ten Speed Press) by visionary mycologist Paul Stamets.
Viruses
Plant viruses are incurable; often, the best strategy is to remove the afflicted 
plant. On the other hand, viruses rarely kill woody plants, being content with 
merely distorting the foliage. Viruses can lay dormant for decades, waiting 
for the right plant to show up. Genetic susceptibility is the critical element; 
even ideal growing conditions won’t prevent an infestation.
You can work around viruses by keeping plants vigorous so they’re better 
able to resist the effects of an infestation. Sanitation can also help. Remove 
infected plants from the property immediately (don’t compost them).

In This Chapter
▶ Creating conditions for lawns to thrive
▶ Feeding your lawn
▶ Mowing and watering tips and tricks
▶ Controlling pests, diseases, and weeds the sustainable way
▶ Getting rid of your funky old lawn
T
he most sustainable lawn is no lawn at all. The second best approach 
is to have a meadow instead of a lawn (see Chapter 19 for details). 
Meadows do most of the things that lawns do, including tolerate moderate 
traffic and play. But when you need a conventional lawn (for lawn games or 
other legitimate uses, or to comply with neighborhood regulations), try to 
keep it as small as you can and care for it in such a way that you create the 
least impact possible.
The shift to organic lawn care has been huge. People are fed up with spread-
ing poisons all over their yards. According to Popular Mechanics magazine, 
the number of U.S. households purchasing natural fertilizers increased from 
2.5 million to 11.7 million between 1998 and 2003. During the same period, 
the number of households practicing natural pest control went up from 
1.8 million to 10.9 million. That’s a revolution!
People wouldn’t be using organic methods if they didn’t get results. Organic 
lawn care isn’t just for hard-core enviros; it’s also a well-developed system 
with a lot of great science behind it. Suppose you hate the environment. Fine. 
Organic lawn care will still save you time and money, and at the same time 
it’ll deliver a great-looking, robust lawn. In this chapter, I show you how to 
make it happen.
 
You can find a lot more great information on lawn care in Lawn Care For 
Dummies, by Lance Walheim and the National Gardening Association (Wiley). 
Consider it a companion volume to this chapter.

Part V: Great Greenery for a Green Garden 
Putting Healthy Conditions First
Set up a healthy environment, and you’ll have much less trouble with your 
lawn. Proper lawn-growing conditions include the following:
 
✓ Good soil: Lawn grasses need soil that’s loamy, fertile, and fairly high in 
organic matter. Too much clay inhibits root development; the roots can 
easily be overwatered or compacted. Too much sand creates a soil that 
dries out too fast and doesn’t hold nutrients well. Get a soil test to see 
whether your soil will have to be modified or replaced (see Chapter 16 
for details). If the soil is poor, you’re better off fixing that first.
 
✓ Enough sun: The best place for a lawn is in full sun.
 
✓ Proper varieties of lawn grasses: Choose a seed mix that’s adapted to 
your particular climate. Include several varieties of grass that adapt to 
slightly different growing conditions. If you have shady areas, include 
some shade-tolerant varieties.
 
✓ Minimum competition from neighboring trees: Tree roots are shallow 
and extensive (See Chapter 9). They find lawns quickly and suck the life 
out of them. The lawn is small and weak compared to the trees, so it 
loses the battle. Place your lawn as far away from trees as you can.
 
✓ Adequate water: Be sure you have enough pressure and volume to 
operate a sprinkler system (see Chapters 7 and 8 for details), and take 
community watering restrictions into account. If you’re on a well or 
other private water supply, find out whether there’s a consistently 
adequate supply of water.
Fertilizing the Sustainable Way
The major nutrient that lawn grasses require is nitrogen, followed by phos-
phorous, potassium, and sometimes trace elements such as iron. Nitrogen is 
volatile and needs to be applied regularly. However, many people overapply 
lawn fertilizers thinking that more is always better. Instead, test your soil to 
find out exactly what the lawn needs (see Chapter 16).
If you have to fertilize your lawn, follow these simple guidelines:
 
✓ Go organic. Organic fertilizers nurture soil life; harsh chemical ones 
harm it. Organics last longer, won’t burn the lawn if they’re overapplied, 
are made from sustainable natural sources rather than fossil fuels, are 
less likely to leach into groundwater or streams, and are less expensive 
in the long run.

323
 Chapter 22: Opting for Organic Lawn Care
 
✓ Know how much fertilizer to apply. Lawns need 1 pound of actual 
nitrogen per 1,000 square feet at each application, with an annual total 
of 1 to 5 pounds, depending on soil type, grass variety, and growing 
conditions. The percentages of the Big Three (nitrogen, phosphorous, 
and potassium) in a fertilizer are listed on the bag — shown as 10-5-5, 
for example, indicating 10 percent nitrogen and 5 percent each of 
phosphorous and potassium.
 
 To avoid damage to waterways and groundwater through leaching of 
nutrients, replace only what’s been used instead of dumping on a set 
amount of fertilizer each time.
 
✓ Know when to fertilize. Two feedings a year are usually enough to 
encourage good root development and prepare the grass for strong 
growth in spring. Make fall your primary feeding time. Avoid fertilizing 
too early in spring, because it encourages the development of diseases. 
Warm-season grasses should be fed in summer only; cool-season 
grasses shouldn’t be fed in the heat of summer.
 
 Organic fertilizers are dependent on soil microbes to convert their 
nutrients to a form that’s available to the grass. The microbes are on 
duty when soil temperatures are on the warm side, so organic fertilizers 
won’t do much good in cold weather.
There’s more to good fertilizing than just nitrogen. Keep these tips in mind to 
keep your lawn looking lush:
 
✓ A monthly application of seaweed extract (kelp) provides valuable 
trace elements (nutrients needed in smaller quantities). This seaweed 
application is a natural way to boost the performance of your lawn.
 
✓ Good organic fertilizers contain humic acids, which increase the avail-
ability of nutrients, improve soil structure, enhance photosynthesis and 
protein synthesis, and improve root function. These fertilizers enable 
you to use less nitrogen, which means less waste and pollution.
 
✓ The pH (a measure of whether the soil is acidic or alkaline) of your 
lawn should be between 6.3 and 6.8. Adding lime to your soil (the 
mineral, not the fruit) can reduce acidity; adding sulfur can reduce 
alkalinity. Maintaining optimum pH helps keep weeds and diseases 
from becoming a problem, reducing or eliminating your need to use 
chemicals.
 
✓ Adding compost or compost tea (a specially prepared living solution of 
compost that’s available at some nurseries) once or twice a year can 
revitalize the soil food web and contribute nutrients. (See Chapter 16 
for details.)

Aerating and Renovating Your Lawn
Aeration is the practice of removing cores from the root zone of turf to 
reduce how compact the roots are and to allow water and fertilizers to 
penetrate. Clay soils are especially susceptible to compaction.
Aerate in spring or fall, when temperatures are low. Use a gas-powered or 
small foot-powered aerator that removes small cores of soil (see Figure 22-1). 
Don’t use a spading fork or spikes that don’t take cores, because they 
compact the sides of the holes they make. Remove nine to ten cores per 
square foot of lawn. Follow up by raking compost into the holes.
Renovation, also called dethatching, is a method of combing thatch (built-up 
dead grass) from the turf. Thatch inhibits the penetration of water, fertilizer, 
and air, and it can encourage certain diseases and pest problems. Thatch is 
most prevalent in lawns that are overfertilized, especially Kentucky bluegrass.
 
If the soil food web is in good shape, the beneficial bacteria, insects, and earth-
worms will consume thatch and keep the soil open. But conditions are some-
times less than ideal due to inherent soil conditions, such as heavy clay, 
compaction due to heavy use, or regrettable lapses of good practice. That’s 
when it’s prudent to step in and fix the situation.

Renovate in late summer, and do so only if thatch is at least 1/2 inch thick. 
Here’s how.
 
1. Remove the thatch.
 
 Use a power lawn rake (a machine that combs thatch out of the lawn) or 
a special hand renovating rake if you’re doing a small area.
 
2. Overseed (apply lawn seed onto the prepared surface of the lawn).
 
3. Top-dress (cover the seed) with a 1/4-inch layer of compost.
 
 Use about 20 cubic feet of mulch per 1,000 square feet of lawn area.
 
4. Water to bring the seed to life.
It may be cheaper to hire a lawn company to aerate and renovate for you. 
(Check out the nearby sidebar, “Working with an organic lawn care com-
pany,” to be sure you’re working with a reputable and sustainable company.)
Working with an organic lawn care company
Caring for one’s own lawn is a basic duty of 
modern homeownership. But there are certainly 
reasons to hire someone to mow, fertilize, weed, 
renovate, and otherwise nurture your lawn for 
you. Take laziness, for example; it’s one of my 
favorite motives for paying people. Or busyness, 
distaste for the activities of lawn care, physical 
inability to do the work, or excessive income. 
For whatever reason, hiring a lawn service can 
be a load off your shoulders.
Be sure you choose a lawn care company that 
has a genuine commitment to the sustainable 
way. Some services sneak the chemicals 
in when you’re not looking or use the same 
equipment for chemical and organic lawn care, 
resulting in contamination. Others don’t 
really understand the principles behind organic 
lawn management and don’t deliver good 
results. The sustainable approach has been 
around long enough, and enough training is 
available, so there’s no excuse for poor 
performance.
Ask questions about the approach the lawn 
care company is proposing, and use the 
information in this chapter to see whether its 
program conforms to accepted sustainable 
practices. Get specifics about the materials 
the service will be using and the strategies it 
recommends for your particular situation. Get 
a detailed written management plan and a 
fixed price as well as the usual references and 
written contract.
No gardening service, organic or otherwise, 
can keep things perfect all the time; nature just 
has too many variables. But be sure to maintain 
open communication with the workers to be 
sure that you understand what they’re up to 
and that you’ll be aware of any problems that 
come up.

Giving Your Lawn Just Enough Water
Water properly and you’ll have few problems; screw it up, and nothing else 
will go right. Nearly everybody waters too much. A few people water too 
little. Very few people water just the right amount. If your lawn is constantly 
soggy and squishy, you’re overwatering. If you step on the lawn and it 
doesn’t spring back, or if your lawn is crunchy and dying out in places, 
chances are you’re not watering enough. See Figure 22-2 for what happens to 
grasses and their root systems with varying amounts of water.
Figure 22-2:

of different 
approaches 
to watering.

Visit Chapter 9 for details on proper watering. For now, remember the 
following key points:
 
✓ Most lawns need 1 or 2 inches of water per week, including rainfall. 
That inch of water will penetrate 6 to 12 inches into the soil, depending 
on your soil type (deeper in sandy soils than in clay soils).
 
✓ Water more often in sandy soils, less often in clay soils, but never 
water more than three times a week. Once a week is usually fine, but 
the frequency depends on weather conditions. The hotter, drier, and 
windier the weather, the more often you have to water.
 
✓ Water to replace what’s been used and no more. Use a soil probe to 
examine soil moisture. If the soil is damp in the root zone, you don’t 
need to water. If you step on the grass and it doesn’t spring back when 
you remove your foot, it’s time to water.
 
✓ Water early in the morning. Never water at night or in the heat of day 
unless your lawn is in urgent need of water.

327
 Chapter 22: Opting for Organic Lawn Care
 
✓ Pay attention to drought tolerance. Among cool-season grasses, fescues 
are the most drought tolerant; bluegrass and rye are the least. Warm-
season grasses tolerate more drought than cool-season ones. There’s no 
such thing as a drought-tolerant lawn, so keep it small. (Find out more in 
Chapter 19.)
Smart Mowing Means Good Growing
Mowing with a power mower causes noise and pollution, and it uses fossil 
fuels. Mowing is dangerous. Mowing is bad. Flip to Chapter 19 to read more 
about the effects of mowing. In the meantime, this section provides some tips 
for mowing as smart and sustainably as possible.
 
Besides watering, mowing is the other most-important lawn care practice. 
You should mow your lawn high (and no, I don’t mean under the influence). 
Maintaining grass at the proper height preserves plenty of leaf surface so 
that photosynthesis is maximized and plenty of sugars go into the roots to 
strengthen them (plants are sugar junkies). Mowing high encourages deep 
rooting and soil building. It also helps shade out weeds, encourages grass to 
spread by sending out underground runners, discourages pests (what’s better 
than a discouraged pest?), and keeps diseases at bay.
Mow cool-season grasses, such as fescues, bluegrass, and rye 2 to 3 inches 
high. Mow warm-season grasses, such as Bermuda grass, no more than 
1 inch tall.
 
Here are a few other mowing mantras to keep in mind:
 
✓ Mow when the grass needs it, not just because it’s Saturday morning.
 
✓ Use a mulch mower or mulching blade to return the clippings to the 
lawn by practicing grasscycling (see the upcoming “Grasscycling” 
section). Grasscycling can account for up to 30 percent of the total 
nitrogen requirements of the average lawn, and it eliminates the need 
to dispose of the clippings.
 
✓ You can mow right over fallen leaves, and they, too, can return to the 
soil. Contrary to popular belief, this practice doesn’t cause thatch 
buildup.
Mowtown: Alternatives to 
fossil-powered mowing
People mow because the grasses they use in lawns are bred to be mowed. 
They mow because society says mowing is the right way to keep a lawn. They 

328
Part V: Great Greenery for a Green Garden 
mow because a cropped turf is a playable, attractive surface. They mow, and 
mow, and mow, burning up dinosaur juice and making noise and pollution in 
the process. Yet you can mow in less damaging ways.
Muscle-powered push mowers (also called reel mowers) work very well. They 
use no fuel unless you count what you had for breakfast. They’re quiet. They 
always start. They let you mow the lawn and get your exercise at the same 
time, which is perfect for busy people. They work well as long as you don’t 
let the lawn grow too long before mowing. Because a reel mower shears the 
grass off like a pair of scissors would, it makes a cleaner cut than the typical 
rotary mower. One of these mowers is a feasible option if your lawn is 
smaller than 3,000 square feet, made up of a fine-bladed and not-too-wiry 
grass variety, and is on relatively level ground.
If you have a bigger lawn or tough grass, use an electric mower, which 
requires about half the energy of a gas mower and can be less polluting, 
depending on the source of the electricity (solar panels on your roof would 
be ideal). Modern electric mowers are cordless, quiet, and efficient, and 
they always start.
Or try the classic solution: sheep. The town of Curitiba, Brazil, uses a flock of 
municipal sheep to mow the parks. Grass co-evolved with browsing animals, 
so this method isn’t such a big leap. The sheep fertilize, too. If you happen to 
have one or more domestic ruminants, turn them out on the lawn.
 
Taking good care of your mower can make a difference. Reel mowers need 
sharpening and adjusting now and then to keep the cut clean and minimize 
the effort it takes to push them. Electric mowers need little care other than 
keeping the blade sharp. If you have a gas mower, keep it tuned up so it 
pollutes as little as possible, and sharpen the blade so it doesn’t have to work 
so hard.
Grasscycling
Bagging grass clippings is unnecessary and wasteful. After all, it removes 
valuable nutrients and organic matter from the system for no reason. A 
better alternative is grasscycling (also known as mulch mowing) — the 
practice of leaving clippings on the lawn so they return to the soil through 
the process of decomposition. Grasscycling can reduce the need for nitrogen 
(the key element in lawn fertilizer) by 30 to 50 percent.
 
The idea that leaving the clippings on the lawn causes thatch is a myth. If you 
have a mulching mower, it will automatically cut the grass into very fine bits 
that will decompose quickly and then blow them down into the lawn, where 
they’ll get right to work recycling nutrients. Many regular mowers can be 
equipped with a grasscycling kit. You can use a regular mower as-is as long 
as you cut the grass often enough that you aren’t removing more than an inch 
of the blades at any one time. Be sure to mow when the grass is dry so the 
clippings are distributed more evenly.

Fighting Lawn Pests and Diseases 
without Chemicals
Like giving yourself a healthy diet, exercise, and good living conditions, 
taking care of your lawn’s soil makes all the difference. An overfertilized and 
overwatered lawn is the perfect place for pest and disease problems to 
develop. So is one that isn’t mowed at the right height or isn’t mowed often 
enough. The traditional approach is to attack the problem with chemicals, 
but that doesn’t work if the cause of the problem isn’t resolved.
 
Pests and diseases are present in every lawn, but they lay dormant until con-
ditions are right for their development. Any problem depends on the presence 
of three elements: a disease or pest, a host (your lawn), and conditions 
favorable to the problem. Eliminate the conditions, and the problem will go 
away without the need for toxic pesticides or other chemicals.
The following sections introduce you to pest and disease control the 
sustainable way.
Controlling lawn pests: Grubs, bugs, 
and other subsurface lurkers
Sometimes good conditions aren’t enough to stop a problem; and other times 
it isn’t possible to optimize conditions for one reason or another. That’s 
when you step in with some natural controls, which are available from 
nurseries and insectaries. The following are tips on dealing with some of the 
most common lawn insect pests (see Figure 22-3):
 
✓ Grubs, armyworms, and cutworms: These soil-dwelling larvae cause 
patches of lawn to die off and also attract varmints that dig up the lawn 
looking for them. Grubs are susceptible to many natural controls, so 
you may not need to take any action. You can inoculate the soil with 
beneficial nematodes (roundworms); introduce parasitic wasps; or treat 
with Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), a disease of caterpillars that’s harmless 
to anything else. Japanese beetle grubs are treatable with milky spore 
disease; one fall application lasts for decades.
 
✓ Sod webworm: These larvae make small patches of dead grass in 
summer. You’ll see moths flying around the lawn and can find green 
pellets of frass (a nice word for poop) in the grass. Keep grass mowed 
high, aerated, and well watered to minimize the problem. If those 
techniques fail, control with Bt or parasitic nematodes. Some varieties 
of rye and fescue lawn grasses contain endophytes (beneficial fungi that 
attack webworms and other pests).

330
Part V: Great Greenery for a Green Garden 
 
✓ Chinch bugs: These winged insects are easily controlled by regular 
watering, which encourages the development of fungi that attack the 
bugs. Keep thatch removed, too. As with webworms, grass varieties 
containing endophytes also help.
 
✓ Billbugs: These tiny beetles can be controlled with endophytic grasses 
or parasitic nematodes.

Treating lawn diseases
Many species of fungi and other diseases attack lawns that aren’t in good 
condition. Lawn diseases usually announce their presence with patches 
of dead grass. The way the patches spread and the shape and color they 
take on can indicate (to a trained eye) the type of problem that’s lurking 
beneath the surface. See Lawn Care For Dummies for details on identifying 
diseases.
Lawn diseases are nearly impossible to control with chemicals, but good 
lawn care usually keeps the diseases at bay. The best strategy is to avoid 
overfertilizing, which produces susceptible growth. No organic fungicides 
are available, but seaweed has been effective in some cases.
 
If diseases are persistent, renovate the lawn and seed with a mixture of 
disease-resistant grass varieties. See the earlier section “Aerating and 
Renovating Your Lawn” for further details.

331
 Chapter 22: Opting for Organic Lawn Care
Whacking Weeds the Natural Way
 
Make your lawn dense and vigorous so it outcompetes the weeds: Plant the 
proper varieties, nurture the soil, mow high and often to prevent seed-set on 
annual weeds, water deeply and infrequently, and reseed bare spots quickly. 
Any vacancies will likely fill up with weeds, not desirable grasses. Monitor 
weed development, and eradicate newcomers early.
Even with the best of care, you still get some weeds. This ain’t the Garden of 
Eden. Outsmart them. Try these tips:
 
✓ Fix the pH. Dandelions, for example, like a soil pH of around 7.5 (slightly 
alkaline); adjust the pH so it’s between 6.3 and 6.8, and the dandelions 
will diminish.
 
✓ Fertilize when necessary. The medic plant and clover are indicators 
of low nitrogen, so fertilizing a little more often will put them at a disad-
vantage.
 
 By the way, clover absorbs nitrogen from the air and puts it into the 
soil, where grasses can use it. Clover was a common feature of lawns 
until chemical-company propaganda convinced people that it was a 
weed. It also attracts bees, however, so it’s hazardous to those with 
bee allergies.
 
✓ Yank them out by hand. Hand-pulling weeds can be laborious, but it 
works fine if you stay on top of it. Many non-backbreaking weeding tools 
are available.
 
✓ Be uncultivated. Don’t cultivate the soil if you have perennial weeds; it 
can disperse rather than discourage them.
 
✓ Dress with vinegar. Using horticultural vinegar to spot-treat weeds 
works really well. (For details, visit www.usda.gov and search for 
“vinegar weeds.”)
 
 Only low-test food-grade vinegar is legal to use in the garden; stronger 
20-percent concentrations work great but aren’t yet approved by 
the EPA.
 
✓ Apply corn gluten meal. This type of meal kills crabgrass. Apply 20 
pounds per 1,000 square feet in early spring or late summer. You should 
get 50 to 60 percent crabgrass control in the first year and 90 percent by 
the third year.
 
 Corn gluten meal works against many other weeds and also acts as a 
gentle organic fertilizer. Don’t seed after applying it, though, because it 
inhibits germination. Spread the meal with a fertilizer spreader, water 
afterward, and then let the lawn dry out for two to three days.

Replacing an Old Lawn
At some point, a lawn gets old. The exact longevity of a lawn depends on 
many factors: local growing conditions, type of lawn, level of care, degree of 
use, and the presence of pests, diseases, and weeds. Unfortunately, there 
comes a time when it’s necessary to turn the old clunker in for a new model.
In some cases, renovating and overseeding your washed-up lawn with fresh 
grass is sufficient (see the earlier section “Aerating and Renovating Your 
Lawn” for details). But when you’re faced with a lawn that’s mostly weeds, 
full of holes, and generally pathetic, it’s time to roll up your sleeves and start 
over. Some work is involved, but replacing a lawn isn’t that difficult for the 
average gardener. Here’s how to do it:
 
1. Strip the old sod off.
 
 Using a hand sod cutter or a (I’ll look the other way) pollution-spitting 
gas-powered sod cutter, which you can rent. Compost the sod. (See 
Chapter 16 for details on composting.)
 
2. Rototill the soil, incorporating a 1-inch-thick layer of good organic 
compost into the top 5 or 6 inches of native soil.
 
 This method brings life to the soil and gives you an organic-matter 
content that’s ideal for turf grasses.
 
3. Finish-grade the area, being sure to direct water away from the house.
 
 If your soil is sandy or loamy and drains well, consider making the lawn 
concave so that it soaks up rainwater, which will reduce dependence 
on irrigation. However, this technique isn’t a good idea for heavy or 
easily compacted soils, where heavy use may be a problem if the soil is 
frequently wet — especially if you live on a geologically unstable site.
 
4. Install a sprinkler system if you’ll be using one.
 
 You have a few system options to choose from; see Chapters 7 and 8 for 
the scoop.
 
5. Use sheet mulching to kill the weeds.
 
 If you have persistent perennial weeds that come back from the roots, 
visit Chapter 16 for info on sheet mulching.
 
6. When you’re sure that the weeds are gone, remove the mulch and 
cardboard, and seed or sod the new lawn.
For specific information on installing a conventional lawn, refer to Lawn Care 
For Dummies.
 
If you want to go one better than lawn, put in a meadow. Meadows require 
much less watering, fertilizing, and mowing than lawns do; they’re also diverse 
and beautiful, and you’ll be the envy of all your neighbors. Visit Chapter 19 for 
details on low-impact lawns and lawn alternatives.

n this chapter, I introduce some projects you can tackle right away (for 
relatively little or no money!) that make a big difference to you and the 
environment. They’re all easy, and most of them don’t require the use of 
heavy equipment, chiropractors, or bad language. Enjoy.
Make Your Lawn Smaller
Most lawns have parts that are never used for anything other than giving the 
lawn mower its weekly workout. Do what savvy sustainable landscapers 
everywhere are doing: Cut that lawn down to size! (Refer to Chapter 19 for 
the scoop on lawns and lawn alternatives.) Make a lap lawn — a phrase 
coined by a gardener I once met. Long and narrow, this type of lawn is still 
perfectly suited to hosting a friendly game of catch or a chase with the family 
pooch. After its midriff bulge has been whacked away, your svelte new lawn 
is ready for sustainable action. Consider a maximum size of 20 by 40 feet — 
a total of 800 square feet. If you can do with less, great.
 
In making the lawn smaller, you create new borders. Plant these borders with 
useful, beautiful, climate-appropriate plants that need less care, water, and 
fertilizer than the original lawn did. Drip-irrigate and mulch the borders to 
save water. Don’t forget to move your sprinkler heads to the new edges of the 
lawn to save more water (and money).

336
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Tune Up Your Sprinkler System
Out-of-whack sprinklers result in water waste and poor lawn performance, 
so you need to give the system a tune-up every so often. Turn the system 
on one valve at a time so you can test it and get everything working right. 
(See Chapter 10 to find out how to maintain your irrigation system.)
Reprogram Your Irrigation Controller
Conventional irrigation controllers have no idea how much water your plants 
need. They’re just timers, faithfully carrying out whatever instructions you 
gave them the last time you programmed them. Umm, you did adjust your 
controller at some point, right?
If you haven’t, now is the time. Get out the instruction book for your control-
ler so you can make sense of the simple-yet-often-obscure ways of program-
ming these pesky beasts. Then read Chapter 9 of this book to discover 
how to make seasonal adjustments to your controller. Reprogramming your 
irrigation controller isn’t terribly difficult, and it saves you a bunch of money. 
Your plants will thank you, too.
Install a Smart Irrigation Controller
If you don’t want to reprogram the controller you already have (see the 
preceding section), yank that old clunker off the wall and put in a smart 
controller. A smart irrigation controller receives signals from — get this — 
outer space. These signals reset the controller’s program continuously, 
based on current meteorological data taken from local weather stations.
To install and program a smart controller, you just have to answer simple 
questions about your soil, plants, and so on. You tweak it a bit over the first 
few weeks, and when you’re done, you probably never have to touch it again.
These units have generated water savings of 25 to 50 percent, which means 
that your water bill will go down. Even better, you can gloat when the 
neighbors come over. Sustainability is just the coolest thing. See Chapter 9 
for more on smart water management.
 
Many water districts offer rebates for installing smart controllers.

337
 Chapter 23: Ten Projects That Pay You and the Environment Back Big Time
Axe Your Overgrown Plants
Take note of how many hours per month you spend keeping plants from 
growing too big for the space they’re in. You could’ve spent that time 
enjoying a nice, sustainable activity, such as loafing.
Plants don’t ask you how big you want them to be. If they’re programmed to 
get 100 feet tall, they always try to do so. So if you want an 8-foot-tall plant, 
you need to choose one that grows to 8 feet at maturity. Then you’ll never 
have to trim it. Plus, it looks better and is healthier when left alone. (And 
you’ll look so relaxed in that hammock.)
Pull Up Sissy Plants
Go around your yard with a shovel and perhaps a digging bar, swiftly and 
mercifully eliminating namby-pamby plants of whatever kind. Or at least 
move them where they’ll perform better, if location is the problem. Probably 
80 percent of gardening problems are caused by 20 percent of plants. You 
know which ones they are. Go get ’em.
My favorite sissy plant to weed out is the rose. I know the term may offend 
some people, but hybrid tea roses aren’t so great at taking care of them-
selves. It hurts me to ponder the rust, the leaf spot, the bugs, and all the 
other ills and ailments that plague these pitiable creatures. I consider it a 
public service to replace them with something a little more durable.
Dump Your Chemical Arsenal
Exactly what excuse does anyone have for holding onto that noxious-smelling 
collection of insecticide, weed killer, and fert-’n’-hurt? C’mon — you know 
you’ll never use that stuff again. You’re a sustainable gardener now! Put 
your old chemicals in a sealed container and then take them to your local 
hazardous-waste collection center for safe disposal. Then go home, perform 
a cleansing ritual or two in your garage, and get on with your life. Feel good 
knowing that you’ll probably never have to make the trek to the toxic dump 
again.
 
Some of this stuff is truly treacherous to your health, so be sure to wear 
protective gear and be very careful not to spill anything.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Trade Your Power Tools for Hand Tools
Shop around for some truly good, lifetime-quality hand tools, and leave the 
power ones out at the curb for some other fool to struggle with. You’ll be 
glad you did.
Power tools actually don’t save much effort. First, you have to work pretty 
hard to earn the money to buy them. Then you have to store them some-
where, do tune-ups and repairs, fuel and oil them, wipe them down and 
sharpen the blades, and adjust the dang carburetor over and over because 
nobody but the high priests of internal combustion can get it right the first 
time. Besides all that, think about the number of times you’ve pulled the 
starter cord with no result. Must be in the thousands, right? You could’ve 
had the lawn mowed with a simple push mower by the time you regained 
your composure and got that wheezy old mower running.
Mulch Your Beds
Naked beds don’t work. The soil dries out too quickly, root systems suffer 
heat and cold, weeds come up everywhere, rain washes earth away, 
beneficial soil microorganisms suffer, drip tubing shows, mud sticks to 
your boots . . . I could go on and on. In nature, organic material rains down 
from plants constantly, creating mulch and returning valuable nutrients to 
the soil. The sustainable landscaper mimics this elegant system by practicing 
chop and drop pruning (refer to Chapter 20) and by spreading some form 
of organic mulch on the surface of the soil. For more on mulching, see 
Chapter 16.
Grow Food
What better use can you have for your land than growing your own food? The 
list of advantages is a mile long (but I won’t bore you with the details). Plant 
a few crops that are easy to grow in your area and then devote a little time, 
money, and effort to reap the rewards. Flip to Chapter 18 for more informa-
tion about sustainable veggie gardening.

Ten Totally Nonsustainable 
Landscaping Mistakes and 
How to Avoid Them
In This Chapter
▶ Knowing the nonsustainable landscaping pitfalls
▶ Avoiding resource- and money-sucking mistakes
C
onsidering all the nonsense that’s out there about landscaping and 
gardening practices, I don’t think you need to feel bad about committing 
some of the gaffes listed in this chapter. After all, it’s human nature to think 
that if everyone’s doing something, it must be right.
Yet many common gardening practices are foolish, and imitating them 
doesn’t help anyone. If you’re wasting time and money or creating a big 
environmental impact, now is the time to change your ways. A little knowl-
edge and willingness to change behavior can solve the majority of gardening 
problems in a big hurry, with no downside and often little or no cost.
Making Hasty Decisions
The first rule is to slow down. Very few landscaping emergencies exist at any 
time — and none at all exist during the early stages of your project. The best 
gardens have been developed over years, decades, and even centuries. Take 
your time.
There’s a phenomenon that I call Saturday Morning Syndrome. Here’s how it 
works: You get up on Saturday morning and say, “Hey, today is the day I 
landscape my yard! All right!” You drive down to the nursery, where you pick 

340
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
out a bunch of plants you’ve never even heard of before and a bag of soil 
amendment; maybe you throw in a fountain that caught your eye and a 
couple of plaster gnomes. You come home with your stuff and spend the rest 
of the day trying to figure out what to do with it. Because you don’t have a 
clue what the plants want or how big they get, they eventually kick the 
bucket; lift your house off its foundation; or grow into the next block, 
strangling small children along the way. The fountain doesn’t go with the 
house. And the gnomes? Well, I won’t even go there.
You’re going to live with your new landscaping for a very long time. Why not 
do yourself a favor and give the design phase all the attention it needs? You’ll 
be happy you did. The chapters in Part II can help.
Not Giving Plants Room to Grow
Each plant has a genetic destiny. Its ultimate size is built into its DNA, and 
you can’t do a thing to change it. Based on a rigorous scientific survey — 
one that involved walking around my neighborhood looking at all the plants 
that want to be much bigger than the spaces they’re in — I estimate that 
40 percent of all gardening work consists of cutting things back. This is 
madness. And of course, it’s also nonsustainable, because it requires fossil 
fuels to run the hedge trimmers and truck the decapitated plant parts to the 
landfill. Fortunately, you can employ a simple solution.
 
Check the mature height and width of the plant in any good gardening book or 
on a good gardening Web site. Or see what the tag that comes with the plant 
says. And believe it. Make sure to place each and every plant so that it has 
room to grow — make sure it’s far enough from other plants, paved surfaces, 
and structures. (Check out Chapter 16 for more information on giving plants 
the room they need.) That way, you’ll never have to prune your plants.
Ignoring Growing Conditions 
When Planting
Plants are living things, and they need what they need. Planting a shade-
loving plant in the hot sun or a drought-loving plant in a wet spot is a recipe 
for failure. So is putting a delicate plant where it’ll be pummeled by wind. 
Once again, the simple solution is to match your plants carefully to the 
conditions you have. Flip to Chapter 16 for some pointers.

341
 Chapter 24: Ten Totally Nonsustainable Landscaping Mistakes
Note: At times, it makes sense to change conditions to accommodate plants 
that normally wouldn’t be happy in that particular spot, but it’s far wiser, 
easier, and more sustainable to choose plants that will be happy with things 
as they are.
Overwatering
There’s something satisfying about watering — so satisfying that overwater-
ing is among the most widely practiced of gardening mistakes. Not only does 
overwatering waste water that could be used for better things, but it also kills 
plants or makes them grow too fast so that they become soft and vulnerable 
to problems. Overwatering costs you a lot of money, too!
If you have a manual watering system (or if you water by standing at the 
business end of a hose), be sure to use a soil probe or put a shovel into the 
soil to check moisture levels before you water. Don’t depend on the surface 
appearance of the soil; conditions may be quite different down where the 
roots live. If the soil is dry 6 to 12 inches below ground, consider watering — 
depending, of course, on the root depth of the plants in the area.
If you have an automatic controller (see Chapter 7 for details), be sure to 
reprogram it periodically to account for seasonal changes in water use. The 
heat of the summer increases water demand, but then many people forget 
to turn the controller back down in the fall. Refer to the water management 
information in Chapter 9 or talk to your local water purveyor for specific pro-
gramming suggestions. Better yet, invest in one of the new smart controllers; 
these devices automatically adjust to ever-changing conditions.
Using Chemical Fertilizers
Many chemical fertilizers are made from natural gas and other nonsustain-
able resources. They also often have a high salt index, which means that they 
salt the soil, making conditions tough for the many beneficial microorgan-
isms on which your plants depend for true well-being. Also, many chemical 
fertilizers act very quickly, which means that they can burn plants by over-
loading them with excessive nutrients — and then go away, leaving the plants 
stranded. Using chemical fertilizers on plants is like expecting your body to 
live on coffee and chocolate bars. It’s tempting but not so healthy.
Sustainable gardeners depend on organic fertilizers that provide nourish-
ment for the entire soil food web, not just the plants (see Chapter 16 for 
details). Organic fertilizers are made from renewable natural sources rather 
than petroleum. They’re much less likely to cause pollution from runoff and 
to leach into groundwater. And they don’t burn plants. They apply nutrients 
gradually — as plants prefer — and stick around for the long haul.

342
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
 
The truly sustainable landscape doesn’t depend on fertilizers, because nutri-
ents never leave the site. Everything that’s pruned from a plant is returned to 
the soil in the form of compost or sheet mulch (find out more in Chapter 20). 
It’s fine to use fertilizers for the occasional special treat or when nutrient 
levels need to be high for spring growth or other situations, but your plants 
should be able to coast along on their own waste most of the time.
Being Hooked On Pesticides
Tell me that you don’t use harsh chemical pesticides. Please. They’re so 
unnecessary! Plants get pests for any number of reasons, generally because 
something is wrong with the growing conditions: too much or too little 
water, sickly soil, oddball weather conditions, and so on. The pests know a 
stressed plant from a happy one, and they make their move when a plant’s 
defenses are down. Pests also attack soft growth, which can be a result of 
overwatering.
A well-planned landscape has little need for conventional pesticides, which 
cause pollution and health risks. Still, even in the most sustainable gardens, a 
plant may suffer an attack of some kind. Your first line of defense should be 
to evaluate growing conditions and make any necessary improvements. Then 
sit back and watch for positive change. More often than not, the newly 
healthy plant will defend itself without any further help from you.
The other cool thing that happens is that beneficial insects often move in to 
mop up the pests for you. If not, organic remedies are available for most pest 
and disease problems; you should have no trouble finding a treatment that’s 
consistent with sustainable practices. If all else fails, take the plant out and 
replace it with something tougher. Visit Chapter 21 for more information on 
combating pests and plant diseases.
Applying Harsh Chemical Herbicides
You end up with weeds because nature fills voids — and not usually with 
azaleas. Weeds are aggressive, opportunistic plants that are poised to exploit 
any gap in vegetation. When conditions are right, weeds happen.
 
Weed growth and the use of herbicides are the result of design failure. 
Correcting the problem with proper planting and mulch is easy. For instance, 
if you make sure that every square inch of your garden is filled with robust 
plants or covered with weed-discouraging mulch, you greatly reduce the 
problem; as a result, you don’t need to use herbicides. Then you can deal with 
the few remaining weeds (yes, you’ll still have some) by hand-weeding or 
using some horticultural vinegar spray when they’re young. (See Chapter 22 
for what you need to know to get started.)

343
 Chapter 24: Ten Totally Nonsustainable Landscaping Mistakes
Choosing Power Tools When 
Hand Tools Would Do
Power tools seem to make your gardening life easier, but when you factor in 
all the variables — working to buy and maintain them, keeping them adjusted 
and running properly, storing them, using gas and oil to keep them going, and 
dealing with the impact of eventual disposal — they really aren’t that great a 
deal. Add in the terrible noise and air pollution, and what you get is a high-
tech train wreck.
Sure, sometimes power equipment is the best way to go if you want to get the 
job done in a reasonable period of time, but remember that humans built the 
Giza pyramids and Stonehenge and a whole lot of other stuff by hand. Why 
have we gone soft on our ancestors?
If you have a lawn, consider using a push mower (see Chapter 22) or try 
converting the lawn to a natural meadow that requires little or no mowing. 
Drag out those rusty old hedge shears and give them a whirl on the hedges; 
your pecs will perk up marvelously. Just remember that the key is to design 
(or redesign) your property so that power tools just aren’t necessary. You 
want to design so that everything is in a state of balance that makes all that 
hard work a thing of the past.
Tilling the Soil
Everyone has been taught that fluffy, thoroughly cultivated soil is the very 
best stuff for your plants. As it turns out, that’s not true. Instead, cultivating 
soil destroys its texture, along with the elegant network of mycorrhizal fungi 
and other beneficial organisms that are essential to the well-being of your 
plants. Tilled soil can become clumpy or powdery, and the effects are worse 
if the soil is wet when tilled. Tilling also turns up weed seeds and can undo 
years of patient weeding in a single, pollution-spewing pass.
Yes, tillers suck up dinosaur juice (also known as fossil fuels) and spit out 
smog and noise just like all other power equipment. Tsk, tsk. Not sustainable. 
Not sustainable at all.
Tilling the soil to grow plants is like tearing the roof off your house to let a 
little fresh air in. The sustainable way is to practice no-till or low-till growing. 
For the home gardener, this ancient practice involves covering your vegeta-
ble garden with an organic mulch, which keeps weeds down, reduces water 
use, and returns nutrients to the soil. Place plants in small, hand-dug holes 

344
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
within the mulch, never again turning the soil over. Mulch may not be as 
sexy as a big plot of fragrant, fluffy black earth, but it’s a whole lot better for 
the environment, your plants, and you. (Find out much about mulch in 
Chapter 16.)
 
At times, you have to do grading during the course of constructing your 
new landscape, and you may be tempted to soften the soil with a rototiller. 
Resist — the same soil damage will occur. Instead, water if necessary to 
bring soil to proper physical condition; then grade by hand (or with minimal 
use of heavy equipment in large areas).
Unimproving the Soil
One of the biggest myths in landscaping is that you have to “improve” the 
soil to get the best performance from plants. The truth is that you really 
can’t fix soil. Some pioneering research in the 1970s proved that in most 
cases, amending soil is detrimental both to the soil and to the plants. Here 
are several reasons:
 
✓ Incorporating amendments into the soil displaces nutrients and reduces 
its water-holding capacity in many cases (depending on your soil type).
 
✓ Fluffy, highly porous planting pits invite rainwater in, drowning the 
plants if internal soil drainage is poor.
 
✓ Conversely (and perversely), those fluffy pits dry out much faster than 
the surrounding native soil during dry periods, so plants suffer.
 
✓ Roots circle around in soft, amended soil and never venture out into the 
native soil where they belong, especially in clay soils.
 
Spend your time and money improving the soil food web by inoculating it 
with mycorrhizal fungi, beneficial bacteria, and other living goodies — not by 
working on the texture.
Chapter 16 gives you the scoop on soil improvement. In the long run, of 
course, it’s far better to match plants to the soil you have.

The Housewarming (And Cooling) 
Landscape
By placing trees at strategic locations around your yard, you can make your 
house more comfortable all year long. Deciduous trees (ones that lose their 
leaves in winter) provide shade in summer, keeping your house cool, and let 
in the sun during the winter, making your house warmer and sunnier. On the 
windward side, evergreen trees get in the way of the wind, creating a calm 
zone on your property. Shoot, you can even use trees and shrubs to funnel 
cooling winds onto your property. Hardscape can help too: Fences and walls 
direct air movement, and overhead structures shade hot spots. Look at 
Figure A-1 to see cool ideas for keeping your home comfy.

The Fire-Wise Landscape
If you live in an area with a history of catastrophic wildfires, you’re at risk of 
losing your home. Create defensible space around your home by thinning 
overgrown vegetation, replacing highly flammable plants with low-growing 
and succulent varieties, removing lower limbs from trees, eliminating or 
modifying wooden structures, keeping your property tidy, and keeping 
plants well watered. Also consider building masonry patios (made of stone, 
concrete, or other nonflammable material) instead of wooden decks and 
using steel fencing or masonry walls instead of wooden fences. Make your 
house less flammable by enclosing eaves and installing a “Class A” fireproof 
roof and fireproof siding.
 
No landscape is ever completely fire-safe, because anything will burn in a 
violent wildfire. But the strategies in this section improve your chances. Get 
the lowdown at the Firewise Communities Web site (www.firewise.org).

The Watershed-Friendly Landscape
We all live on a watershed. The rainfall that hits your roof and land runs into 
the street, where it contributes to urban flooding and pollution of streams, 
lakes, and oceans. If you make your landscaping absorbent, the ground soaks 
up that good water instead of wasting it. Provide plenty of planted areas 
instead of just pavement, make pavement permeable (see Chapter 12), create 
low spots in the terrain that will soak up water (see Chapter 8), build rain 
gardens (any planting that’s irrigated by channeling rainwater from adjacent 
roofs and surrounding areas into the planted area), and swear off chemicals 
that could leach into the environment. You could even plant the roof of your 
house! (Chapter 12 discusses the ecoroof.) Refer to Figure A-3 to see how to 
make a watershed-friendly landscape.
 
By creating a watershed-friendly landscape, you’ll save money on water, your 
plants will be happier with pure rainwater, and the environment will be 
eternally grateful to you. For further details, check out the watershed page of 
my Web site at www.owendell.com/watershed.html.

The Wildlife Landscape
Critters. Some people love ’em; some people hate ’em. The truth is that 
you probably don’t want to attract bears, wolves, or rattlesnakes to your 
backyard; they’re better off in the wilds. But lots of other animals, birds, 
and insects are an important part of a sustainable landscape.
Maintaining a wildlife-friendly landscape isn’t just about attracting beneficial 
insects like honeybees, which pollinate your food crops. Foraging animals, 
such as skunks and opossums, can help keep the pest population down. 
Provide food, shelter, and water for native critters, and the whole system 
benefits. For an example, see the Missouri Department of Conservation’s 
“Landscaping for Backyard Wildlife” page at mdc.mo.gov/nathis/
backyard/backwild. Check out Figure A-4 to discover ways to attract 
wildlife to your yard.

The Food Forest
You eat, right? Well, why not eat from your own land? Growing food is easy, 
especially if you develop a stable food forest that uses the laws of nature to 
support a permanent edible ecosystem made up primarily of fruit trees and 
perennial plants that are durable, easy to care for, and well adapted to your 
climate and soil. A food forest also includes compatible animals, pollinators, 
water-harvesting systems, and annual food plants, such as broccoli and 
tomatoes. It’s a complex ecosystem that looks great, feeds your family, and 
is good for the environment. That homegrown food sure is tasty, too! 
Check out the food-forest info at the Permaculture Institute’s Web site (www.
permaculture.org/nm/index.php/site/Permaculture-Food-
Forest). Refer to Figure A-5 to see what a food-oriented landscape looks like.
