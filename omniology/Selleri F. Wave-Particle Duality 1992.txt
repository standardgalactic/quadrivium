Preface
This volume tries to continue a tradition of reviews of the contemporary research 
on the foundations of modern physics begun by the volume on the Einstein- 
Podolsky-Rosen paradox that appeared a few years ago/1) Its publication coin­
cides with the hundredth anniversary of de Broglie’s birth (1892), a very welcome 
superposition, given the lasting influence of the Einstein-de Broglie conception of 
wave-particle duality. The present book, however, contains papers based on a 
broad spectrum of basic ideas, some even opposite to those that Einstein and 
de Broglie would have liked.
The order of the contributions in this book is alphabetical by first author’s 
name. It is important here to stress the presence of three reviews of fundamental 
experimental data, by Hasselbach (electron interferometry), Rauch (neutron 
interferometry), and Tonomura (Aharonov-Bohm effect). Hasselbach reviews 
several interesting experiments performed in TUbingen with the electron biprism 
interferometer. Wave-particle duality is brought out in striking ways, e.g., in the 
buildup of an interference pattern out of single events. The Sagnac effect for 
electrons is also discussed. The chapter by Rauch presents interesting results on 
wave-particle duality for neutrons. Of particular interest are the differences 
between stochastic and deterministic absorption in the neutron interferometer, and 
the concrete evidence for the quantum-mechanical ^-symmetry of spinors. In the 
short chapter by Tonomura, conclusive evidence for the reality of the Aharonov- 
Bohm effect is reviewed, collected in experiments based on advanced technologies 
of electron holography and microlithography.
The historical and philosophical discussion of the events that resulted in the 
hegemony of the Copenhagen view shows that the process was in a way rational but 
certainly not uniquely required by criteria internal to science, as Cushing convinc­
ingly argues in his chapter. Gueret deals with the feature of “duality within 
duality” by considering the spherical light wave emitted by an isotropic source as 
the “envelope” of wave packet of limited longitudinal and transversal size arising 
from single atomic emissions. The importance of the special theory of relativity 
for the birth of wave-particle duality is stressed by Lochak and Dutheil. The paper 
by Home and Selleri shows that the Aharonov-Bohm effect can be interpreted 
rather naturally as the action of a photonic empty wave on the electrons, thus

Preface
lending some support to the idea of local realism. The contribution by Koh 
discusses the scanty evidence that the self-interference of quantum objects de­
pends only on wavelength but not on other intrinsic features, such as mass.
In the early days of quantum theory, Bohr upheld the point of view that an 
atomic system can be made to exhibit either particle or wave properties, but never 
the two simultaneously. Mittelstaedt develops this idea by showing that an atomic 
system can in some cases be considered approximately as a particle and, simul­
taneously, approximately as a wave, always in such a way that Heisenberg relations 
are satisfied. Bass discusses the open question of providing a physically satisfac­
tory probabilistic interpretation of quantum theory and suggests the introduction 
of partially disjoint probability spaces. The chapter by Phipps deals with “cover­
ing theories” of the existing quantum theory and proposes to discard the Einstein- 
Bohr debate on the nature of the wave-particle duality as a possibly wrong 
question in order to concentrate on a new theory (the embryo of which is 
presented) that could in the future lead to more detailed predictions, e.g., in the 
domains of nuclear and particle physics. Gordon discusses in his chapter the 
possibility that “half of the duality,” the wave, is not directly observable. For 
him the wave-particle duality can be a general world view, in spite of the 
impossibility of resurrecting Einstein’s reality. Some arguments against the 
existence of de Broglie waves are discussed by Muckenheim.
Caser’s chapter explores the option that nonlocal features of some recent EPR 
experiments are only apparent and that quantum mechanics may not be completely 
valid in its predictions for nearly ideal EPR experiments. The idea is suggested 
that the nonlocal aspects of quantum mechanics may originate in a local multi­
plicity of vacua which obey a set of superselection rules. A set of experiments on 
two-photon interference performed in Rochester after 1987 is discussed by Selleri 
and shown to be consistent with a local realistic approach based on variable 
detection probabilities. Schmidt reports on a set of numerical calculations of 
particle trajectories in double- and triple-slit experiments, based on the idea of 
objectively real waves, and studies the possibility of performing experiments that 
could lead to the direct detection of quantum waves. Ryff deals with nonlocal 
realism and proposes investigating the idea experimentally with apparatus de­
signed to evidence nonlocal features connected with the wave-particle dual 
properties of light.
The topics included in this volume are testimony to the richness and 
significance of the current research on the foundations of quantum physics. I am 
sure that it will be a useful review and reference book.

1. INTRODUCTION
I shall at first restate the principles of quantum mechanics. We take an abstract 
Hilbert space H. According to a definite rule, we associate with every physical 
quantity a linear operator over H, bounded or not bounded. We choose an element 
of H such that ||i|j|| = 1. We call the mean value of A in the state the scalar 
product
2(A) = (A<M)
(1)
If A is hermitian, Q(A) is real.
This definition is justified by the following properties/1) Let Us be a contin­
uous abelian group of unitary operators:
VSUS' = US.US = t/s+s„ U_s = C7-1, Uo = identity
Then the function
9(5) =
(2)
is a positive definite function of 5. This means that, for any integer n > 0, for any 
real numbers 5P . . . , sn and any complex numbers q,. . . ,cn the hermitian form

is positive. According to Bochner’s theorem, there exists a positive bounded 
measure P such that
0(s) = Jexp (ww) JP(w)
In the case where the hermitian operator A is bounded (or in certain cases where 
A is not bounded), it is possible to define exp(iAs) which generates a unitary group. 
Then
6(5) = (exp (zAs)i|> ,i|>) 
(4)
By this formula, we associate with A a measure P which can be called a probability 
measure. Therefore, 0(5) plays the role of the characteristic function of some 
random variable associated with the measure P. Nevertheless, it must be noted 
that this interpretation of the positive definite function 0 is not the only one 
possible. In any case it was chosen for quantum mechanics.
The expression (1) of the mean value is a consequence of the expression (4) of 
the characteristic function. It is then justified. Examples of characteristic functions 
are well known. Let us choose as Hilbert space H the space of complex valued 
function i|>, square-integrable over [-00,4-00] and such that
f_Ji|j(x)|2dk = 1
The operator A such that Ai|/(x) = xi|j(x) is associated with the position of a 
particle. Its characteristic function is
_ 00 
__
(exp(zsx)i|/,i|j) — J_wexp(zsx)i|A|j<ix 
(5)
Therefore, |i|/|2 plays the role of a probability density for the position.
The operator A such that Av|/(x) = (hli)(dtyldx) is associated with the ve­
locity of the particle. Its characteristic function is

Probability, Pseudoprobability, Mean Values

we can easily verify that the operator (hli)(dldx) corresponds to the probability 
density (2zn,//z)|i|j(x/7i)|2.
More generally, the characteristic function associated with a hermitian 
operator A can be constructed as follows:
If i|# is a given function of x, we introduce the function
X(x,s) = exp (isA)ty(x) 
(8)
It satisfies the following equation:
X is a solution of this equation such that x(
*,0)
 = and we have
0(s) = 
(10)
Let us suppose in particular that A is the hamiltonian operator H. Equation (9) 
becomes identical to the Schrodinger equation with 5 = ht. If we decide that, in 
formula (8), is a solution of the Schrodinger equation, we must introduce 
explicitly the fact that i|j is a function of time t. x is a solution of the same equation, 
such that x(
*,0)
 = Therefore, the expression of x is necessarily
X(x,s) = 
+ hs) 
(11)
and we have
cp(X) = 
+ hs)dx 
(12)
an expression which does not involve the general structure of the operator 
exp(zsTi) independently of the special form of i|/.
2. PAIRS OF OPERATORS
Let A and B be two hermitian operators/8’9) If AB = BA, the product of A and 
B is well defined and is a hermitian operator. If X and pi are two real numbers, we 
can introduce the hermitian operator XA + piB. The unitary operator exp(z(XA 
4- |xB)) is defined, and can be written exp (z’XA) exp (iXB) as well as exp (z’XB) 
exp (z’XA). The mean value
(exp(z(XA + |iB)i|f,i|j) 
(13)
is the characteristic function of the pair of operators A,B, in the sense of prob­
ability theory.

4
Jean Bass
If A and B do not commute, let us write
AB - BA = iC 
(14)
C is a hermitian operator. The most important case is C = hl, where I is the 
identity operator and A is a positive number. Then
AB - BA = ihl 
(15)
It is verified by A = x, b = (hli)(dldx). C = 0 corresponds to commutative 
operators.
The study of quadratic means associated with A and B leads to remarkable 
consequences. The variance of A, B are the mean values
C(A2) = (A2<M) = IIAM/II2, G(B2) = (B2<|/,i|/> = ||B< 
(16)
If A and B commute, the covariance of A,B is
Q(AB) = <ABi|j,i|j) = <Ai|j,Bi|/> 
(17)
Let r be a real or complex parameter. rA + B is or is not hermitian, but it generates 
a positive norm:
{(rA + B)i|j, (rA + B)i|>) =
rr||Ai|/||2 + r(Ai|/,Bi|j) + r(Bi|>,Ai|>) + ||Bi|/||2 
0
If AB = BA, we choose for r a real number. As a consequence of (18), we have
=£ ||A<MIW|I 
(19)
Or
le(A5)i [e(A2)-e(s2)]1/2
This is the classical Schwarz’s inequality.
If AB — BA = iC, we choose for r a purely imaginary number r'i. Then
r'2||AiHI2 + r'(Cty,i|>) + IIB^H2 s*  0
Therefore,

or
|G(C)| 
2[2(A2)0(B2)]l/2
If C = hl,
[e(A2)0(B2)]i/2 
h/2
It is the celebrated Heisenberg’s uncertainty relation. For position and velocity, 
this inequality corresponds to the fact that the probability densities of x and 
(h/i) (d/dx) are |i|j|2 and (2ir/h)\ty(x/h)2, where 4*  is the Fourier transform of i|>. If 
for instance cp(x) = (2iT)“1/4CT“1/2exp(-x2/4CT2), one has

(21)
If we replace A by A — 2(A), and B by B - Q(B), we see that the product of the 
standard deviations of the probability law associated with A and B is greater than a 
positive number h/2. If the first one tends to zero, the second one tends to infinity. 
Moreover, if the probability density of A tends to the 8 distribution of Dirac, the 
probability density of B tends to zero at every point. It stretches and flattens out 
along the axis in such a way that the integral from —oo to +<
*>
 remains equal to one. 
For instance, in the above example of a gaussian i|j, o tends to zero and it is clear 
that |i|j(x)|2 tends to zero at any point x. In this sense, B becomes entirely 
indeterminate.
3. WIGNER’S PSEUDODENSITY
The preceding discussion shows clearly that it is not possible to associate to 
the pair A = x, B = (hli){dldx) a joint probability law. Nevertheless, as XA + |1B 
is a well-defined hermitian operator, it is possible to compute the mean value of 
exp(i(XA + |ulR)), namely
0(X,|x)
(22)
We have to compute the function
i|/(x) = expl ikx + |i/i —Ji|/(x)
(23)
which derives from the function i|j(x,s) such that

6
Jean Bass
i|/(jc,j) = exp
s’! ikx +
(24)
i|/(x,5) reduces to i|j(x) for s = 0, and we are interested in ip(.x, 1). For this purpose, 
we introduce the infinitesimal operator of the family exp[s(/Xx + }jJi(d/dx)], 
which does not constitute a group: We find that i|> satisfies the differential equation
dip 
dip
- = iXxiP +
(25)
Its standard resolution gives
ip(jc,s
*)
 = exp
iK(xs +
ux i i 2
ipC

 + pAs)
(26)
Therefore,
0(X,|ul) = J^exp ik^x + 
+ y&)ty(x)dx
which is better written as
0(X,|x) = J Qoexp(zXx)i|f (x + ip (x — dx (27)
0(X,O) is the exact characteristic function of position, and 0(0,|i) the exact 
characteristic function of velocity. But 0(X,|x) is not a characteristic function with 
respect to X and |jl. Indeed, 0(X,|x) is the Fourier transform of

More generally, any expression as expi(oA 4- (3B)-expi(a'A + P'B), with 
a + ot' = X, P + £' = |x, gives an alternative expression of the characteristic 
function of A,B. For position and velocity, the result is 0(X,|x)-exp(i7i/2) 
(ot'p - ap').
4. PROBABILITY SPACES
It is usual to say that every hermitian operator generates a random variable. 
But the results of the preceding section show that the set of all these random 
variables does not constitute a probability space. Only a set of commutative 
operators is able to generate a probability space. In such a space, the characteristic 
function of a finite family {Ak} of hermitian operators is given by
<exp(iSxkAk)4»,»|/> 
(32)
Let E be the set of all bounded operators over the Hilbert space H. It contains 
the unitary operators. The space E is the union of a family of vector subspaces E} 
such that, if A and B belong to E-, then AB = BA; in particular, if A and B are 
hermitian operators, AB is a hermitian operator belonging to E-. If A and B 
commute, it will be convenient to write A B. Then the situation is as shown in 
Figure 1. If A and B belong to the same space Ev
A^B
If A and C belong to the same space E2,
A_C
But B and C do not belong to the same subspace of E. Then we have not B^C. 
Example:

A = xp B = x2, C = 7—

(In this example, the operators A, B, C are not bounded. But the associated unitary 
groups are bounded, and have the same property.) This discussion is summarized 
as follows. Quantum mechanics is represented by a vector space E in which is 
defined a binary relation A B, not transitive, for C A and A B does not 
imply C^B. The space E is the union of vector spaces E}, the elements of which 
are pairwise “comparable,” i.e., satisfying the above relation. These subspaces E} 
possess a structure of an algebra of bounded operators.
5. QUANTUM MECHANICS AND FLUID DYNAMICS
In the preceding sections, time was given and fixed. If we take in account the 
evolution in time, we must introduce new concepts. The state describes a tra­
jectory in Hilbert space. This trajectory is a solution of a Schrodinger equation, 
namely
i dt
h V 
-
(34)
(We assume that the mass is one.) The potential V is independent of time.
In order to discuss and to solve this equation, several processes can be used. 
In the first one we write
(35)

Probability, Pseudoprobability, Mean Values

It is well known(7) that (34) gives rise to two real equations, namely:
dp + V d 
dt k dxk
d<p' 
^dxk
= 0
dtp j y / dtp \ _ h2 Aa 
dt + 1 k \dxk/ 2 a
(36)
(37)
(36) is a conservative equation of the mass, for a flow having density p and velocity 
grad <p. (37) is generally interpreted as a Jacobi equation for a hamiltonian system, 
in which the potential V is completed by a “quantum potential” (7i2/2)(Aa/a). 
Equation (37) describes the motion of a point under the action of a potential V. The 
trajectories compatible with this potential are mutually independent, and specified 
by their initial position. All that is by no means probabilistic. We still interpret 
p = a2 as the probability density of a “particle” (i.e., a moving point) which 
would have in space a random position belonging to any trajectory.
But (36) is not sufficient to determine that u- = dcp/dXj is the velocity of a 
hydrodynamic flow. In fluid dynamics, the “various trajectories” coexist. They are 
followed by “fluid particles,” not well defined, which have a physical interaction, 
characterized by internal stresses. These stresses are represented by a symmetrical 
tensor Tjk such that, in accordance with (37),
l dTik d fh2V2a\
-STi = T-(3-—) 
(38)
p k dxk dxj \ 2 a /
A solution of (38) is
h2 ,d2loga h2 f d2p Idp dp\ _
Jk 2° dXjdxk 4 \dXjdxk pdXjdxk/’P a
(For verification, it is helpful to put = expx ) Other solutions are obtained by 
adding to (39) the general solution of the homogeneous system
X^ = o
namely
= V2(/-8jk
d2U 
dx,-dxt
J K
(40)
where U is an arbitrary function.

10
Jean Bass
If we interpret (A2/2) (V2/a), the “quantum potential,” as generating stresses, 
(37) becomes a genuine equation of fluid dynamics (Bernoulli’s equation). The 
velocity of this fluid derives from a potential, and is given by
h I — dib 
dib \
P“j = 
~ 
(41)
J Zi \ aXj 
^xj/
The question may be asked whether such a flow has a physical existence, and not 
only a mathematical structure. If so, we are more or less led to abandon the 
probabilistic interpretation, which we have noticed is incomplete. The function 
p = |i|/|2 becomes a material density, and no longer a probability density. There is 
no inconvenience to interpret the physical particle (and not the fluid particle) as a 
fluid possessing an extension in space. Some of its properties are correctly 
described by the motion of its center of mass, but other more subtle properties take 
into account the space extension of the fluid. Do the properties of this fluid have an 
oscillating nature, suggesting the association of a wave notion and a particle 
notion? It is not obvious, but it seems to be related to the structure of the fluid 
trajectories. These trajectories are the solutions of the differential equation
dx- 
di|>
dt 
dx-
(42)
To get a rough understanding of their nature, we must use a second classical 
method of integrating the Schrodinger equation. This equation has “stationary 
solutions” of the form
i|/(x,t) = a(x) exp (itot), a = |i|/|
(43)
The complex function a is a solution of the differential equation
V2a 4- 2
(44)
As ||i|/|| = 1, a must satisfy the condition fDa2(x)dx = 1. Then (44) has nonzero 
solutions only for the set of eigenvalues of gj. In many cases, this set is countable, 
and we have for the solution of the Schrodinger equation
i|> = S ak(x) exp (fo)k0
(45)
The ak are the normed eigenfunctions, multiplied by coefficients such that the 
series X |ak(x)|2 is convergent.
As a function of t, i|/ is a Fourier series, generally nonperiodic, which

Probability, Pseudoprobability, Mean Values
11
represents an almost-periodic function. This sort of function is somewhat oscilla­
tory, or “waving.” We see that the form of solutions of the Schrodinger equation 
suggests at once the idea of a wave.
We must now find the solutions of the differential equation
dx- 1 /_dib dib\
<‘l = 
~ 
(46)
The right-hand member of (46) results from a succession of operations which 
preserve the structure of almost-periodicity, namely
1. Differentiation of i|/ and i|j with respect to space
2. Product of two almost-periodic functions
3. Ratio of two almost-periodic functions, except in the case where i|j i|j 
vanishes in some points of the domain (density zero at some points)
Therefore, (46) takes the form
dx 
= S bjk(x) exp (iak0 
(47)
It seems that at present nothing is known about the nature of the solutions of (47). 
An elementary example where exact integration is possible will show what may 
happen. Let us consider the equation
= fc(x)(Sbkexp(iakO) 
(48)
with only one scalar variable x. Let us suppose that the function J dx/b(x) has an 
inverse function c(z). The solution of (48) takes the form
x = c( ZrT^expOaj/) ) 
(49)
\ k l0Lk

If c(z) can be expanded in a power series, we have

The spectrum is deduced from the spectrum of the velocity, but is more compli­
cated. It contains linear combinations with integral coefficients, which may be 
dense over the frequency axis. Now the spectrum {ak} itself is very complicated. It 
is reasonable to think that the solutions, or some solutions, of (48) are oscillating 
functions supplied with a spectrum. But we do not know if this spectrum is a ray 
spectrum or is continuous. In any case it is convenient to investigate the spaces in 
which we can find these sorts of functions, which we shall call stationary 
functions, and to confront these spaces with the spaces of operators.
6. MARCINKIEWICZ SPACE AND STATIONARY FUNCTIONS
We must now define the stationary functions and investigate their fundamen­
tal properties. We shall put aside probability theory and mathematical expecta­
tions. We introduce another definition of mean value, suggested by experiment. 
We are concerned with complex or real valued functions/defined over [—00,4-00]. 
We call an average operator an operator M which maps / into
1 rT
Mf= ]im — j f(t)dt 
(51)
T—>00 
—1
Mf is called the {temporal) mean value of/. The set of functions for which A//exists 
is a vector space. But it is too large for applications. We introduce now the 
quadratic mean of/, defined by
M\f\2 = lim^r |/(r)M 
(52)
T->00 £1 -T
It is easy to see that the set of functions with a quadratic mean is not a vector space. 
For instance, / = exp {i log |r|) has a quadratic mean, g = 1 has a quadratic mean, 
but, as /has no mean value, / + g = 1 4- exp(zlog |r|) has no quadratic mean
It is necessary for functions having a quadratic mean to belong to a vector 
space. For this purpose, we define a generalized quadratic mean value by
M\f\2 = lim sup^= fT |/(0|2dt 
(53)
(Remember that lim sup XT signifies lim [supXT,].) 
• 
T—*°°  
T—T>T
The expression

13
is obviously a positive and decreasing function of T. When T—it has a finite or 
infinite limit. It is easy to prove that the set of functions/for which this limit is 
finite constitutes a vector space. It is a normed space, by ||/||2 = M\f\2. It is even a 
complete space (Banach space). It was introduced by Besicovitch in a particular 
case, and is called Marcinkiewicz space $D?2. It contains functions having an exact 
quadratic mean. But likewise it contains functions such as 1 + exp (i log |t|) 
without a quadratic mean. After the quadratic mean, we must study the existence 
of the average of a product. It is clear that the existence of Af|/|2, Af|g|2 does not 
imply the existence of An example of this situation is given by/(t) = 
(ilogO, g(0 = 1. Here is a difference between temporal mean values and 
mathematical expectations. In probability theory, when the random variables X 
and 7, defined over a well-specified probability space, have a quadratic mean, then 
XY has a mathematical expectation. If M(fg) exists, we say that / and g are 
comparable and we write f^g. The existence of Mf can be written as/^1.
Let E' be a set of functions pairwise comparable:/^# and in particular/^/, 
i.e., M\f\2 exists. It is clear that E' is a vector subspace of Marcinkiewicz space 
W?2. It is even a Hilbert space, with the scalar product Mfg. The space 9Ji2 is the 
union of vector spaces E' of comparable functions which have the same structure 
as the spaces of operators discussed in Section 4. Figure 1 is valid when the 
operators are replaced by functions, comparable functions corresponding to 
commutative operators, and real functions to hermitian operators. Figure 2 gives 
an example of this situation, when/is a function such that lim f(t) = 0. We see 
that Mf = 0, M(/exp ilog |f|) = 0 but Mexpilog|r| does nofexist.
To a real function/it is possible to associate a characteristic function. When
FIGURE 2.

14
Jean Bass
MexpOV(O) 
(54)
exists, this is a positive definite function, the Fourier transform of a measure 
which has the properties of a probability measure. For instance
for / = 1, Afexp(zX) = eiX (density 5(x — 1))
for / = sinr, Afexp(zXsinf) = J0(X) (density -—7==^ for W < 1
0 for |x| > 1)
The next step consists of constructing the characteristic function of a pair of real 
functions f,g. It is the mean value of exp [i(Xf 4- |xg)]. If/^g, this mean value 
exists and is a positive definite function of X and jjl. But if / and g are not 
comparable, M[i(kf + |xg)] does not exist.
There is a strong analogy between operators and functions. But there are 
some differences. For operators, (exp[z(XA + |jlB)i|j,i|j) exists, but is or is not a 
characteristic function. For functions, Af[exp z(X/ -I- pig)] exists or does not. In 
fact, if it does not exist, it seems possible to give an extended definition of mean 
value such that various mean values exist, but are not necessarily characteristic 
functions. In both cases, the notion of characteristic function has no more sig­
nificance.
Among the functions belonging to SR2, very important are those for which 
fit) fit + t) for any t. The mean value
7(t) = MfWit + t) 
(55)
is called the correlation (or autocorrelation) function of/. It is easy to prove that 
y is a positive definite function of t. If y(r) is continuous, it is the Fourier 
transform of a positive bounded measure, called spectral measure. This measure 
is continuous or discontinuous.
The first case corresponds to almost-periodic functions, of the form
f(t) = 2ckexp(zwkr) 
(56)
The correlation function of/is
7(t) = S|ck|2exp(KokT) 
(57)
By a convenient extension of their elementary definition, they constitute a 
complete vector subspace of 2R2J2-5> In this case, / has a discontinuous (ray) 
spectrum.

If the spectral measure is absolutely continuous, there exists a spectral 
density <p such that
7(t) — J exp(i<0T)<p((D)da) 
(58)
Then the function/is called a pseudorandom functions2^ It has a continuous 
spectrum. The correlation function is continuous, and limy(T) = 0.
T—>00
Pseudorandom functions have no elementary representation. They are Fou­
rier transforms of vector-spectral measures, and such representations are not 
concrete. But it is easy to build models of special pseudorandom functions. Here 
are examples of pseudorandom functions.
We say that a sequence xn of real numbers such that 0 < xn < 1 is uni­
formly distributed if the following condition is satisfied: Let (a,b) be an arbitrary 
interval included in (0,1). Let TV' be the number of terms xp x2,. . . , xN belonging 
to (a,b). We suppose that the ratio N'/N tends to a limit, which is equal to b - a, 
when TV —> oo.
In the same way, we define a sequence (xn, yn) uniformly distributed in the 
square (0,1) x (0,1). We say that the sequence xn is 2-uniformly distributed if 
the sequence (xn, xn+1) is uniformly distributed in the square.
We give a function F, defined and Riemann-integrable over (0,1). We 
consider the function / such that
/(0 = 0 if f <0,/(r) = F(xn) if n<t<n + 1 
(59)
It is possible to prove that this function is pseudorandom (see Refs. 2-4). Its 
correlation function (defined by lim (1/7) J ) is equal to 
o
(1 — |t|) (t), where (t) = 1 if |t| 
1, (t) = 0 if |t| 
1
Of course, the convolution of this function by an integrable kernel transforms 
these discontinuous functions into continuous pseudorandom functions.
Concrete examples of 2-uniformly distributed sequences are known. Let
P(0 = aotv + 
+ • • • + av
be a real polynomial of degree v > 2, such that aQ is an irrational number (for 
instance, P(t) = y/2t2, P(t) = tt^2). Then the sequence P(ri) modulo 1 (the decimal 
part of P(n)) is 2-uniformly distributed.
The characteristic function of f(t) is defined by
0(s) = limy f exp dt = lim — S exp(«F(xn)) 
(61)
T-^oo I 0 
AT-+OO /V n=0

Jean Bass
According to a fundamental theorem of H. Weyl, this limit is equal to
exp(isF(x)dx 
(62)
For this special class of pseudorandom functions, we find a new correspondence 
between probability theory and temporal mean values. Indeed, (62) is the charac­
teristic function of a random variable F(x), defined over the probability space (0,1) 
with Lebesgue measure.
The main fact of this section is that almost-periodic functions, as well as 
pseudorandom functions, are essentially oscillating, without any limit at infinity. 
We thus are led to conclusions which are no more than hypotheses, and would 
deserve mathematical complements and physical interpretation.
7. CONCLUSION
The path we have followed begins with a discussion of the standard proba­
bilistic interpretation of quantum mechanics. In a given state i|j, a correspondence 
is established between operators in Hilbert space H and random variables, through 
an adequate definition of mean value. Characteristic functions, defined as mean 
values, enable us to define probability laws, by squaring elements of H. But all 
these elements are not fully consistent with a customary structure of probability. 
They suggest the introduction of a family of probability spaces partially disjoint.
The study of the evolution of illustrates the role played by oscillating 
functions like almost-periodic functions (ray spectrum) and pseudorandom func­
tions (continuous spectrum). These functions belong to a function space (Marcin- 
kiewicz space HR2 in which mean values are defined neither as mathematical 
expectations as in probability theory nor by scalar products (Ai|j,i|j), but as 
temporal mean values. The structure of Marcinkiewicz space is very similar to the 
structure of the union of probability spaces used in quantum mechanics. The 
evolution of i|/ suggests the association of a physical particle with a hydrodynamic 
flow possessing internal stresses. The streamlines of the flow are very likely 
described by functions belonging to the space HR2. The question is asked whether 
this fluid is able to give a physical representation of the particle. It is worth noting 
that it has the combined properties of a pure particle, an extension in space, and 
local irregularity, suggesting an oscillatory structure and the word “wave.”

CHAPTER 2
Local Vacua
Serge Caser
1. FROM BELL’S THEOREM TO WHERE?
Ever since Bell’s article of 1964,<0 which greatly clarified the debate initiated 30 
years earlier by Einstein and co-workers (EPR)/2> nonlocality has been considered— 
by some physicists at least—as a critical issue in the interpretation of quantum 
mechanics (QM). On the other hand, the so-called local realistic theories (LRTs) 
which were proposed as an alternative to QM generally appear as ad hoc con­
structions with a limited scope, although they certainly are very useful in showing 
that experiments most often do not prove what they were set up for. The strength of 
QM, of course, lies in its simplicity and predictive power. But most experiments 
with some relevance to nonlocality are very difficult to perform, and the only one 
which appears to be conclusive^ used photons—particles with very peculiar proper­
ties, indeed. As to the measurement process itself, on which the quantum theory is 
based, it justifiably appears to many as an independent prescription (since all 
efforts to derive it from the theory actually presuppose what they intend to prove).
In the face of such uncertainty, the physicist seemingly has a choice between 
three options:
1. QM is exact in all its predictions, and nonlocality, unintuitive as it may 
be, is probably here to stay (and you better get used to it).
2. Nonlocality is only apparent (and QM may not be true in all its predictions).
3. Why all the fuss about “nonlocality”? It cannot be used to send faster- 
than-light signals, and so it is irrelevant to physics (and maybe to 
philosophy as well).

Note that options 1 and 3 can easily be reconciled (and often are in practice!), 
so the real choice is between 1 + 3 and 2.
The aim of this chapter is to explore option 2. One word about our philosophy 
(or prejudices): when we say that QM may not be true in all its predictions, we 
expect it to correctly predict spin correlations whenever these correlations are not 
in conflict with locality; otherwise, we expect the discrepancy between QM and 
experiment to be large. Why that? Because spin (or isospin) measurements obey 
beautifully simple rules, and we believe that nature is not vicious enough to 
approximate those rules, with no obvious physical reason. (Maybe Einstein would 
agree on this point.) Needless to say, when these simple rules are not in conflict 
with locality, it will remain to show, in the spirit of LRTs, that they are necessary.
Spin correlations and Bell’s theorem are the subject of Section 2, where a 
number of elementary results are given. These will allow us to introduce the 
concept of local vacua, which will be used in Section 3 in studying a “which way” 
experiment. Section 4 will be devoted to some heuristic considerations about local 
vacua, and Section 5 will offer some new insights into Dirac’s covariant vacuum— 
a classical electromagnetic “ether,” and a possible candidate for a local vacuum. 
Conclusions are given in Section 6. 2
2. SOME BASIC FACTS ABOUT NONLOCALITY
There is considerable confusion in the literature about nonlocality, and many 
“proofs” of the local character of QM are simply due to their author’s personal 
definition (or lack of definition) of this concept. We know of only one clear 
definition of this term in correlation experiments, and we will stick to it, namely: 
Bell’s definition (see below). Also, most results in this field can be obtained in the 
simple model of two spin-1 particles with total spin zero (Bohm and Aharonov’s 
version of the EPR experiment)/4) This model will now be examined.
Consider the setup of Figure 1, where a spin-zero particle decays into two 
spin-1 particles. The two fermion spins are measured along directions a and b (by 
Stern-Gerlach instruments, say). If Pj^(0) is the quantum mechanical joint 
probability for the detection of particle 1 with a spin component cr along a and of 
particle 2 with a spin component a' along b (where 6 is the angle between a and b), 
Bell’s theorem^1) states that it is impossible to write it as
P^'(0) = fAd\p(X)^(X, a)p$(X, b) 
(1)
where p. (i = 1, 2) are real functions satisfying 0 pi 1 (probabilities), and A is 
any set of fields with a normalized distribution function p(X). By the way, the 
factorized form in the right-hand side of (1) is Bell’s (and our) definition of locality.

Local Vacua
21
(Note that p does not depend on a and b, nor px on b, nor p2 on a*)
 Therefore, 
according to Bell’s theorem, QM is nonlocal.
*In a less restrictive definition of locality, p(X) can be influenced by some retarded action of the 
analyzers, as in Ref. 7; or the probabilities pv p2 may depend on the results of previous detections 
through some kind of memory effect [S. Caser, Orsay preprint LPTHE 84/51 (1984)]. Such local (in the 
sense of field theory) models violate Bell’s inequality. They will not be considered here.
Or is it? Take the case ct = ct' = +1. QM tells us that
g
P&(0) = i*in
22 
(2)
(see below). Now, the right-hand side of (1) cannot equal this function (Bell’s 
theorem), but it can equal, say, (1/2)C sin2 (0/2), with C a constant less than 1. This 
only means that some events do not give rise to a coincidence count—in total 
agreement with the introduction of detection probabilities in (1)! When the 
experimenter compares coincidence rates for different values of 0, the C constant 
will drop out (i.e., the rate will be normalized to its value at 0 = 0) and the 
effective rate will equal (2). So the question is: can one set up an experiment where 
all the particles are detected? Unfortunately, the only clean experimental results 

22
Serge Caser
presently available are those of Aspect and co-workers for photons/3) and the 
detection rate there is very poor. The best one can do in comparing (1) with 
experiment is to first derive an inequality which involves no single particle counts 
(Clauser and Horne’s homogeneous version of Bell’s inequality)/5) To do this, 
however, an extra (and untestable) assumption is needed. It is a simple matter to 
see why. But let us first go into the details of our model for a = ct' = +1. 
According to QM, the state of the system is
l«|i> = ^(ltW>2-IW>2) 
(3)
where |f)z and |^)z are eigenstates of o/z) for particle < = 1,2. Pqm(O) is 
the probability of finding the system in the state
\a+b+) = e-^a^l |)le-/[(a+e)/2]a(2>| 1)2 
(4)
where a is the angle between a and the z direction:
^(0) = l<«+*+l'l»>l2 
(5)
Using the identity el(ot/2)ay = cos(a/2) + fo^ sin (a/2) and <Jy = a+ — ct_, one 
easily gets (2). [A similar calculation gives Pqm(O) = P^(0), Pqm(0) = Fq+(0) 
= (1/2) cos2 (0/2).] Note that this probability is independent of a, as it should be, 
because of rotational invariance. We could have used, instead of |i|j), the state
l^x = ^(ItW - ll>M)

and by averaging over X (the only way to recover rotational invariance, since we 
lost it by using |F)X):
pf+(g)==*+isin4 (ii)
At this stage, several remarks are in order. First, if one considers (11) together 
with (10), one concludes that Furry’s hypothesis leads to an expression in the form 
(1), with p(X) = l/2ir. The model is clearly an LRT, but it fails to reproduce 
QM: the extra factor 1/2 multiplying (1/2) sin2 (0/2) in (11) is only a renormal­
izing factor and is not important (see remark above), but the constant term 1/8 is! 
since, according to QM, no ++ events should be present at 0 = 0. This is an 
important point: Furry’s model has /^(X,^) = cos2 [(a — X)/2] and p^(X,a) = 
sin2 [(a — X)/2], hence 4- p\ = 1 (similarly for p2). But the quantum 
correlations are such that for every X in (1) only one outcome is possible at each 
analyzer: if, for instance, the result of the measurement of spin 1 along a is — with 
a nonzero probability p^(k,a), it must, for that particular X, be + with zero 
probability (or else the particle must go undetected), and vice versa. Otherwise, 
when a and b are set parallel (0 = 0), double + (and double —) events will be 
present. (Remember thatpY does not depend on b, norp2 on a.) In other words, if a 
model like (1) is to reproduce QM, it must be deterministic as to the + or — 
outcome (but it may, of course, allow undetected events): + and — events are 
mutually exclusive.
A comparison of (10) and (9) with (5) and (6) also shows that the quantum 
correlation is given by the half sum of two Furry terms (no averaging over X 
necessary) plus an interference term: it is this term which is responsible for the 
strict correlation at 0 = 0. Or else, the quantum result may also be found by 
selecting the component X = a in the Furry ensemble |F)X (or the component X = 
a + 0 in the ensemble |F')X = 
and by multiplying this component by
1/V2: this operation is equivalent to the reduction of the wave function, a non­
local process! [Compare with (6).]
One last remark: for photons [no 1/2 in the arguments of (10)] Furry’s 
probabilities are those of Malus’law.
How does one make (1) equal to the QM correlation, up to a multiplicative 
constant C? We know that C must be less than 1 (Bell’s theorem). For instance, a 
choice like
p++(0) = 1 + Vicos (a - X) 1 - V2cos(a - X + 9) 
(U) 

24
Serge Caser
together with p(X) = 1/2tt [this differs from Furry’s term (10) by the presence of 
the V2 factors] exactly yields the QM correlation (2) (C = 1). This choice, 
however, is ruled out, since the corresponding “probabilities” px and p2 are not 
between 0 and 1. But consider the following choice(7’8) (see Figure 1):
p+(X,a) = |cos(X - a)| for =£ X - a —

and this is equal to the QM correlation (2) multiplied by C — (2/tt)2. (C is less than 
1, as it should be. Similar relations hold for the other Pacr'.) Note that the choice 
2/tt for p2 is not arbitrary: after averaging over X, the four mean probabilities
P” = f dXp(X)p?(X, z) 
(15)
(i = 1, 2, a = ±, z arbitrary) should be equal (an experimental fact). One finds 
p? = I/'tt , which is 2/tt times the observed probability 1/2 [a result consistent with 
the (2/tt)2 factor in (14)].
This model, therefore, agrees with QM, provided the ratio of the number of 
coincidences to the number of events does not exceed (2!tt)2. In photon correlation 
experiments, the coincidence rate is much lower: this is why up to now these 
experiments failed to “prove” nonlocality. As mentioned earlier, to close this 
loophole, Clauser and Horne(5) made use of an extra assumption, which they called 
“no enhancement.” This means that
p?(X, a) pz(X,o°)
(16)
for every X, where pfk, °°) is the probability of a count of detector i in the absence 
of the polarizer. If one looks at (13), one sees that this inequality is violated.

Local Vacua
25
Indeed, pz(X, °°) = pf + [as given by (15)] = 2/ir. But for X = a, for instance, 
the pf of (13) is equal to 1. Let us simply remark here that the no-enhancement 
assumption is by no means a physical prerequisite (because the X’s are not 
accessible to experiment), (see also Ref. 9.)
A striking feature of the above model is the dissymmetry between and p2 
[see (13)]. In fact, if one thinks of photons as classical fields, one would expect a 
relation of the kind
P?(X, b) = p°(k + it, b) 
(17)
There is a theorem which says that, whatever the number of X’s (in the plane 
of the polarizers or not), no such symmetry between the analyzers is possible J8) 
How close to the QM curve can one get in a symmetric model? The answer is given 
by a second theorem:<1()) arbitrarily close, but in the QM limit no particles are 
detected (which is why the first theorem is valid!). The limit, therefore, is, 
physically speaking, a singular one. Why is it so? Nobody knows. But this simple 
fact explains why people working with symmetric LRTs had such a hard time 
finding an approximate fit to QM. According to our philosophy, since the QM 
correlation is compatible with locality, it should be exact. In other words, the LRT 
should be dissymmetric. Is this dissymmetry really a problem?
*
 After all, two 
functions which are different can be considered as two realizations of the same 
function for two values of an extra discrete variable t (t = 0,1). This leads us to 
introduce detection probabilities pf(ki9a9 with correlations of the type

X2 = Xj + 
(18)
T2 = 1 - Tj
(tz = 0,1). The model defined by (13) belongs to this category. (See also Ref. 11.)
What is the meaning of the t variable? Obviously, nature is not “classical” 
enough to reproduce the QM correlation without appealing to some discrete 
“quantum” number. Classical fields? Possibly, but probably a whole collection of 
them (for a given type of particle). We will therefore postulate that a particle is 
made of (or accompanied by) a collection of fields, labeled by a discrete variable t, 
which we call “local vacua.” Some properties of these will now be investigated.
3. HOW TO GET RID OF THE WAVE FUNCTION COLLAPSE
In Section 2 we saw that, to reproduce QM, LRTs must be deterministic, in 
the sense that the result of a spin measurement is determined by mutually exclusive 

26
Serge Caser
probabilities (or else the particle must go undetected). This not too well-known 
fact shows that QM, in its essence, is not so dramatically different from classical 
physics—at least as far as correlations are concerned. On the other hand, we saw 
that a quantum element (the discrete variable t) is a necessary ingredient of 
classical model-making. We believe, therefore, that if a theory must replace QM, 
it will not be some trivial extension of classical field theory. It could, in fact, be 
something between this and the orthodox QM—but local.
Let us consider the action of a Stern-Gerlach magnet (with its magnetic field 
gradient along z) on a spin-1/2 particle. The instrument can be found in three 
different (macroscopic) states: its ground state |0), a state |u) after recording the 
passage of the particle with its spin up, and a state |d) after recording the spin-down 
particle. These states form an orthonormal basis for the instrument in that 
particular measurement. (Actually, each state should be a subspace, but this is not 
important for the present discussion.) When the particle enters the instrument with 
its spin up, it is not necessarily recorded: after its passage, the instrument is in the 
state
|10> = aJO) + pju) 
(19)
with |aj2 + |pj2 = 1, and the state of the system particle + instrument undergoes 
during the measurement the transition
|W)> = |<p(0>lt>|0> 
|<Pu(0>lt>|10> 
(20)
where |<p(t))| f) is the particle wave function. Similarly, when the particle enters the 
instrument with its spin down, the total system will undergo the transition
|W)> = l<P(0>li>|0> -+ |<pd(0>|!>|01> 
(21)
and the instrument will be left in the state
|01> = a2|0) + P2|d> 
(22)
with |a2|2 + |p2|2 = 1. Note that if the instrument works symmetrically, |aj = |a2|, 
13i| = |P2|. We will suppose it does. If now the particle enters the magnet in a 
superposition |<p(t)Xlt) + |I»/V2 (spin perpendicular to the magnetic field 
gradient and to the line of flight), the total system will evolve according to
|W)> = |<p(O)^(|t) + |l»|o> 
^(|<PuW>lt>|10) + |<Pd(0>|!>|01» 
(23)
Let a1 = ee/8i, a2 = ee*82 ([aj = |a2| = e), 
= Vl - €2e/0i, P2 =
Vl - €2e/02 (Ipj = |p2| = Vl - e2). The end result of (23) becomes

______ (24) 
y'kL£e<e1|<pu(O)|t)|u) + y^^e«2|<Pd(0>|l)|d)
There are two extreme cases:
(1) Complete measurement: e = 0. This gives
|4»(0> = ^(e/9i|<pu(0>lt)|u> + e'e2|<p/0>||)|d» 
(25)
At this point, one argues that |u) and |d) being macroscopic states of the (classical) 
instrument, they cannot be superposed: therefore, one concludes that the final state 
of the system is either the first term on the right-hand side of (25), or the last one— 
but not both. This is a superselection rule. [More generally, the rule applies to 
the three states in (24).]
(2) No measurement: e = 1. In this case
IW = ^(e/8i|<PuW>lt) + e^|(pd(t))U»|O> 
(26)
In the interference domain, <pu(x, t) = e/8cpd(x, t): whenever + 8 = S2 
one recovers the initial state in (23) (no spin rotation).
In general, (24) shows that the probability for no measurement is e2, and the 
probabilities for an up-spin or a down-spin measurement both equal (1 - e2)/2.
What is the physical criterion for measurement? Since € = |aj = |a2| 
= |(0|10)| = |(0|01)|, complete measurement will take place whenever the initial 
and the final states of the instrument are orthogonal (e = 0). If, for instance, the 
instrument initially is in a coherent state (as for the magnetic field of a Stern- 
Gerlach), and the interaction with the particle spin adds a few photons to it (or 
turns it into a neighboring coherent state), one cannot expect a complete measure­
ment to take place, since these states are not orthogonal. On the contrary, 
measurement will take place if the instrument is in a pure photon-number state; 
that is, if the state of the instrument (or whatever plays that role in the measurement 
process) is quantum rather than classical.
Obviously, apart from considerations about the state of the instrument or the 
aforementioned superselection rule, there is no reason for appealing to the 
experimenter’s mind (or his cat’s) to build up a consistent viewpoint. One can even 
go one step further: look at (23), for instance. Instead of supposing that the states 
|0), 110), and |01) belong to the instrument, why not suppose that they are in some 
way attached to the particle itself, or to something that accompanies it? The wave 
aspects of the particle are already contained in |<p(t)), but we saw in the previous 

28
Serge Caser
section that a discrete quantum number t appeared necessary to account for 
correlation measurements in LRTs: this could be the manifestation of these extra 
states we are looking for—“local vacua.” We therefore write the state of the 
particle as
|W)> = |<p(O>|s>|O>T 
(27)
where (x|<p(0) — <p(
*
, t) is the usual (“space”) wave function of QM, |s) is the spin 
(isospin . . .) ket, and |0)T is the ket of the associated local vacuum. The local 
vacua are supposed to form a complete orthonormal basis.
T<0|0>T, = 8T>T, 
(28)
and one has the superselection rule: the local vacuum cannot be observed in a 
superposition of the |0)T states. These characteristics of the local vacua are a 
straightforward consequence of the instrument’s behavior, so that the above 
discussion can be reinterpreted step by step according to the new rules. In 
particular, there is a close correspondence between the instrument and the 
particle’s local vacuum: whenever the instrument is in a coherent (classical) state, 
the interaction between the instrument and the particle does not change the 
particle’s local vacuum: interference is preserved [see (23), with |0), 110), and |01) 
all replaced by the same local vacuum |0)T]. When this is not the case, the 
(quantum) state of the instrument is changed by the measurement process, and so 
is the local vacuum: superselection at work between the two local vacua thus 
created at random (one up: |10) = |0)T, the other down: |01) = |0)T,, t' #= t) 
destroys the interference by preventing their recombination at the end of the 
process of measurement. In this interpretation, no reduction of the wave function 
ever occurs—no mystifying rule, only superselection. As to the particle itself, we 
expect it to accompany one of the local vacua (up or down). (Photons could behave 
differently—see below.) What we have achieved by the introduction of these local 
vacua, therefore, is a complete decoupling between the particle and the instrument 
(or observer), as in classical physics. Note the strong interplay of classical and 
quantum concepts at every stage of the investigation: local vacua are described by 
quantum states, but a superselection rule applies, as for the classical macroscopic 
states of an instrument, or else, the quantum states of a system which differ by 
their electric charge. (This rule makes them quite different from, say, classical 
states of the electromagnetic field.) Also note the intuitive side of the local 
vacuum-instrument interaction: whenever the local vacuum “bounces off” a 
classical instrument, its internal state (as described by t) does not change. This is 
similar to a ball bouncing off a wall elastically: neither the wall nor the ball 
undergoes an internal state change. On the contrary, if the collision is inelastic, 
one can expect an irreversible change to take place in the wall’s internal state, and

Local Vacua
29
(according to our rule of the game) in that of the ball as well: no doubt a permanent 
recording of the collision—in other words, a measurement.
4. THE PHYSICAL NATURE OF THE LOCAL VACUUM
One does not always realize that de Broglie’s relation X = h/mv has its origin 
in the relativistic invariance, to order v/c, of the phase of the wave function 
exp(—ip'xlh). If one supposes, as de Broglie did, that to a particle of mass m is 
attached a natural clock of frequency o>0 = and that a similar clock, 
synchronized with the particle’s clock in the particle’s rest frame, can be found at 
every neighboring point in space, then de Broglie’s wavelength X in a frame where 
the particle velocity is v is equal to the distance between two consecutive planes of 
equal phases of the set of moving clocks (the latter appearing out of synchroniza­
tion to the observer at rest because of Lorentz’s transform, but, to this order, not 
slowed down by time dilation). Periodic synchronization of the clocks of the 
atomic electron then leads to quantization of its orbit (the “resonance condition” of 
wave mechanics). Simple as they are, these arguments probably contain in germ a 
more profound (dynamical) view of space than is presently accepted. Dirac 
quantized the electromagnetic field by turning its degrees of freedom into 
elementary quantum oscillators. If a particle’s clocks, as explained above, are 
elementary oscillations of space,(12) then the particle’s wave function would appear 
as some kind of fundamental field through which it acts on its neighborhood. (In 
this context, Einstein’s postulate of the constancy of the velocity of light can be 
thought of as a resonance condition between these oscillators.) This is to say that a 
particle creates its own local vacuum, whose extent is given by that of its wave 
function. Quantum effects would then originate in the oscillatory character of this 
local vacuum and its evolution under the influence of the limiting action of 
measuring instruments. For instance, a photon entering a polarizer should adapt 
its local vacuum to the polarizer’s vacuum, an operation that could lead to the 
collapse of the photon’s vacuum and, if the photon is to be identified with its local 
vacuum, to its subsequent nondetection, as in Section 2.
In (27), the wave character of the local vacuum is described by the “space” 
wave function |cp(r)), while the rest of it is contained in |0)T, which is responsible 
for the superselection rule. One can of course unite both concepts in a single vector
|<P(O>T - |<p(0>|0>T 
(29)
The interesting question now is: why should local vacua obey a superselection 
rule, as in Section 3? The only thing one can say is that this rule is, for the above 
experiments at least, the first genuine manifestation of the quantum world—since 
classical fields do mix together! This does not mean, however, that classical 

30
Serge Caser
physics cannot be used in our understanding of local vacua. A little known theory 
of Dirac will be helpful.
5. DIRAC’S COVARIANT VACUUM AS AN EXAMPLE
Many physicists today think that the idea of a universal ether is not only 
useless, but incompatible with the special theory of relativity. To see that the ether 
concept does not deserve the first quality, it is enough to change its name: the old 
ether has become the present-day quantum vacuum, whose manifestations are 
numerous and predictable. As to the second point, every student in field theory 
knows what a covariant vacuum is. A classical version of this vacuum is the zero­
temperature blackbody spectrum, with spectral density p(w) ~ a)3: it is covariant, 
and it does not cause friction on a charged particle moving with constant 
velocity/13) (Friction is proportional to its acceleration, as in Newton’s law.) In 
fact, the a)3 law is the only one compatible with covariance/14) besides the empty 
vacuum (p = 0), and the renormalization process in quantum field theory replaces 
the first one with the second. The ether, therefore, is at the center of modern 
physics. (By the way, Einstein himself never ceased to believe in it/15))
A fluid with no viscosity is a superfluid. But why couldn’t it/tow? This is the 
subject of Dirac’s beautiful theory of classical electrodynamics/1617) Dirac simply 
observed that a possible gauge for the electromagnetic vector potential A^ is
A, A*  = k2 
(30)
with k a universal constant (Dirac’s gauge). This makes it possible to regard 
A^(x) as a local velocity (up to a multiplicative constant), and Dirac concludes^17): 
“Thus with the new theory of electrodynamics we are rather forced to have an 
ether. ” Why is it a new theory? Because Dirac derived his gauge from a particular 
Lagrangian, and this in some instances leads to deviations from the usual theory. 
[Dirac’s ether is not only a superfluid, but a superconductor (j — A^), a feature 
that made him believe in a better renormalization program once the theory is 
quantized.] What we are interested in here, however, is not Dirac’s theory but 
Dirac’s gauge (30), a perfectly legal choice in classical electrodynamics, as we 
shall now see.
Consider the motion of a particle of charge q = ±e and mass m in a given 
field F = dHA<0) - 5nA<°). The Hamilton-Jacobi equation

(31)

with k = mc2!e, is identical with Dirac’s gauge condition (30), provided one sets

This means that the vector potential in Dirac’s gauge is connected with by a 
gauge transformation, whose gauge function is the Hamilton-Jacobi characteristic 
function S. The potential A^ is not unique: The Hamilton-Jacobi equation in that 
potential now reads
(a,l + -V'Ya* +

This produces a new Dirac potential (A'^A'

A' = A + -dS'

(34)
Let us now concentrate on (33), which gives the motion of the charge in the
potential A^ (A^A

(35)
and the particle 4-velocity:

These relations signify that any pair of solutions A^, S' of (33) [with A^ deduced 
from the given A<®> by the relation (32)] represents a possible motion of the ether 
and of the charge, respectively, in the given field F^v. Note that the velocity of the 

32
Serge Caser
ether in (37) depends on the particle’s charge and mass (through the ratio q/m, 
since this is a classical theory). We will come back to this later.
It is a simple matter to derive the expression of the Lorentz force F = q(E 
+ v x B/c) acting on the charge, from the above equations. What is not so 
obvious, however, is that the same result can be obtained in the spirit of Mach's 
principled by drawing an analogy between the above motion of the ether and that 
resulting from the motion of a reference frame: it turns out that the total sum of the 
inertial forces thus generated is equal to the Lorentz force on the charge. We will 
only sketch the proof. The calculation is more transparent in the nonrelativistic 
approximation for the motion of the ether and of the charge, where the expression 
of the inertial forces (centrifugal + Coriolis) is well known. In that approximation, 
one gets from (37)
u = ——A 
me 
me2 + Imu2 = —qAQ
(39)
where u is the ether 3-velocity (|u| « c, or e|A| « me2) and A0 = v A2 4- k2.
Mach’s principle (in its local version) says that a motion of the ether with 
the velocity field u at some point P in space has the same effect on a particle at P 
as the inertial forces that would result from a motion of the reference frame, 
relative to some inertial frame, with the local velocity field — u.
If cd is the instantaneous rotation vector of the moving frame, one has
cd = —|V X u
(40)
Introducing the vector radius r of the charge with its origin at the instan­
taneous center of rotation (cd x r = — wt, u{ being the transverse component of u), 
the fundamental equation for the motion of the charge is obtained by equating to 
zero its acceleration in the inertial frame:
d2r
It2
(41)
= 0
(No forces are present in this frame, since by hypothesis all forces come from 
inertia.) This should be written in terms of the velocity of the charge v = DrlDt 
and its acceleration D2rlDt2 in the rotating (laboratory) frame. The total inertial 
force acting on the charge
p- D27
F mDt2 
(42)

Local Vacua
33
can then be shown, after some calculation, to be equal to the Lorentz force.(19) 
This result draws a curious analogy between gravitation (the equivalence 
principle, at least) and electromagnetism. We already mentioned the presence of 
the qhn factor in the expression for the ether velocity (37): this, of course, is what 
makes the two theories intrinsically different (no genuine equivalence principle for 
electromagnetism), and the above considerations a pure analogy. Remember, 
however, that a local vacuum is attached to every particle (with given q and m). 
If the local vacuum were a quantized version of the above A^ in Dirac’s gauge (in a 
ground state configuration), the fact that the ether velocity (37) is different from 
one particle to the next would not be surprising: every charged particle has its own 
ether. (This is a weaker version of our superselection rule.) Dirac’s ether, therefore, 
as a local manifestation of a classical covariant vacuum, and by its crucial 
dependence on some of the particle’s quantum numbers, seems to support the idea 
of local vacua.
6. CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK
A careful examination of all the available experimental evidence certainly 
conveys the impression that the nonlocal character of QM is far from being 
established. On the theoretical side, however, there is an urgent need for more 
physics. The predictions of QM clearly are statistical in character. For instance, 
the time description of detection is poor, if not totally absent.
*
 How does a 
polarizer work? What is the criterion for a measurement to take place? (Irrever­
sibility is not a useful criterion, since QM is reversible.) QM treats photons and 
massive particles on an equal footing, but spin correlations at a distance could be 
different in these two cases. As we saw, since the photon number is not conserved, 
photon spin correlations are compatible with a local theory plus enhancement (a 
phenomenon perfectly compatible with a nonexistent polarizer theory!). Note that 
there is no conflict at this point with energy or momentum conservation, the latter 
being satisfied in the mean. But energy-momentum conservation can be checked 
for individual high-energy photons: in this case, however, polarizers are ineffi­
cient, and no direct test of the spin correlation can be made. The question is: is this 
really a coincidence? After all, QM teaches us that the uncertainty relation will 
always turn out true, whatever the observer’s ingenuity, because it (supposedly) is 
a built-in characteristic of nature. Why couldn’t some new principle like this, 
linking the particle character to the polarization character, be at work here? On the 
other hand, a charged particle like the electron is a well-localized object, and one 
does not expect electrons to disappear in the electromagnetic field of a Stern-

Gerlach instrument. But in this case, the uncertainty principle makes the spin 
measurement impossible/20) Another coincidence? As for neutrons or molecules, 
it could turn out that for such localized neutral objects Furry’s hypothesis is valid, 
with a corresponding breakdown of the quantum correlation. Or else, neutrons 
could behave as photons (see above). For heavier objects, of course, the discrep­
ancy between Bell’s limit and QM gets smaller, as does the probability for their 
disappearing in the course of measurement. It is no little irony that the nonlocality 
“proof’ with photons could rest on the (wrong) hypothesis that two photons 
emerge from every atomic cascade and give rise to detection—a hypothesis 
suggested by a classical mental image.
All these considerations make it impossible to ignore the role of the vacuum. 
It can readily be seen, for instance, that the normal ordering prescription of 
quantum field theory (which sets the energy of the vacuum equal to zero) is 
responsible for photon antibunching, a phenomenon “typical” of the quantum 
nature of light/21) The argument can be reversed: take away that normal ordering, 
and light may appear classical. (This does not mean that the usual procedure is 
wrong, but only that proofs of the existence of an absolute gap between the 
quantum and classical worlds do not prove anything!) On the other hand, laser 
light, a “classical” object, has a well-defined phase, but its photon number is not 
determined. One could be tempted to conclude that no such thing as a phase exists 
for a single photon. This conclusion is invalid, because a photodetector does not 
take notice of vacuum effects/22) The vacuum, therefore, whether directly or 
indirectly, appears as a necessary ingredient in the interpretation of a wide range of 
quantum phenomena—and, in general, a classical vacuum is good enough. This 
idea stimulated a number of physicists/23) It seems, however, that if nonlocality is 
one of the characteristics of QM to be explained this way, an even more 
sophisticated vacuum should be conceived. In any case, since the problem of 
inertia cannot be fully understood in the old scheme, this line of research is fully 
justified by itself. The concept of local vacua, we hope, could be the starting point 
of such an investigation.

CHAPTER 3
Causal Quantum Theory
Why a Nonstarter?*
James T. Cushing
1. INTRODUCTION
The standard view of quantum mechanics, almost universally accepted by practic­
ing physicists and most often by philosophers of science concerned with such 
issues, is what may be (somewhat elusively) termed the “Copenhagen” interpreta­
tion. This interpretation requires complementarity (e.g., wave-particle duality), 
inherent indeterminism at the most fundamental level of quantum phenomena, and 
the impossibility of an event-by-event causal representation in a continuous space­
time background. However, it is important to stress that quantum mechanics as a 
theory has two conceptually distinct but practically related components (as does 
any modern theory in physics): a formalism and an interpretation. Very loosely, 
the formalism refers to the equations and calculational rules that prove empirically 
adequate (i.e., “getting the numbers right”) and the interpretation refers to the 
accompanying representation the theory gives us about the physical universe (i.e., 
the picture story that goes with the equations or what our theory “really” tells us 
about the world). Since a (successful) formalism does not uniquely determine its 
interpretation, there may be two radically different interpretations (and ontologies) 
corresponding equally well to one empirically adequate formalism. This can be 
taken as an instantiation of the Duhem-Quine thesis of underdetermination of
*This paper is a much expanded version of a talk, “Copenhagen Hegemony: Need It Be So?, ” delivered

13-17, 1990, the proceedings of which are being published by World Scientific Publishing Co.

theory by an empirical base. Even if one wants to restrict (and, arguably, that 
would be a mistake) the Duhem-Quine thesis to different formalisms each 
handling equally well a given body of empirical information, there nevertheless 
remains the interesting and important point of opposing ontologies equally well 
supported by a common empirical base.
While the rather abstract logical observation that no set of data uniquely 
determines a theory may be relatively uncontroversial, the practical determination 
of a physical theory by empirical considerations and by logic is often taken to be 
quite another matter. Einstein himself offered the following opinion about this 
in an address he delivered in 1918 before the Physical Society of Berlin on the 
occasion of Max Planck’s 60th birthday.
There is no logical path to these laws; only intuition, resting on sympathetic understand­
ing of experience, can reach them. In this methodological uncertainty, one might 
suppose that there were any number of possible systems of theoretical physics all 
equally well justified; and this opinion is no doubt correct, theoretically. But the 
development of physics has shown that at any given moment, out of all conceivable 
constructions, a single one has always proved itself decidedly superior to all the rest. 
Nobody who has really gone deeply into the matter will deny that in practice the world 
of phenomena uniquely determines the theoretical system, in spite of the fact that there 
is no logical bridge between phenomena and their theoretical principles. . . J1)
Now Einstein to the contrary notwithstanding, there are people who have looked 
carefully at the development of certain major episodes in the history of physics 
and who have concluded that factors other than just “the world of phenomena” 
have been essential for specific theory choice and that, but for contingency, the 
final choice might have turned out other than it did/2’3) This is not to claim that just 
any theory can be made to work, but rather to emphasize that logic and physical 
phenomena alone are not sufficient to select uniquely one theory(4) (although, 
in many cases, they alone are in practice enough to rule out or reject some theories 
as viable candidates). This is not to deny Einstein’s claim that “in practice” one 
theory is finally chosen as “decidedly superior to all the rest. ” The question, then, 
is how in fact is such a choice made? In this chapter we point out a known 
equivalence between two opposing interpretations of quantum mechanics and 
discuss the factors that were involved in accepting the so-called “Copenhagen” 
interpretation over its rival.
Although it is not widely appreciated (even if it is somewhat more widely, but 
darkly, “known”—at the level of hearsay), there do exist interpretations alterna­
tive to the standard Copenhagen one. The so-called causal interpretation that we 
focus on here is not only equally as well confirmed as the Copenhagen one (since 
it is based on exactly the same formalism), but it preserves event-by-event 
causality in space-time (albeit with the same type of nonlocality present in the 
Copenhagen interpretation).
We begin with brief summaries of the formalism of (nonrelativistic) quantum 
mechanics, of the Copenhagen interpretation and of one causal interpretation and

show why these two interpretations are necessarily equally well supported empiri­
cally. Each interpretation is then applied to the example of actual neutron 
interferometry experiments, which are, essentially, modern-day versions of the 
double-slit “thought” experiment.(5) Such considerations are necessary to block 
any claim that a causal interpretation is incoherent so that the (clever) founders of 
quantum mechanics would (surely) have spotted that flaw and hence not bothered 
pursuing such an interpretation. We then turn to the central question raised in this 
chapter. Since causal interpretations of quantum mechanics are not refuted by 
logic and/or by empirical (in)adequacy, why have they never (to this day) been 
seriously considered by any sizable faction of the theoretical physics community? 
To construct a plausible explanation for this lack of interest in such causal 
interpretations, one must look (circa 1925-1927) at the roots of the Copenhagen 
interpretation and of the nascent causal interpretation and at the subsequent 
historical developments. If one simply begins the discussion today (i.e., with the 
present situation as it now stands without asking how we arrived there), a charge 
of ad hocness is too easily (even if invalidly) raised by an opponent wishing to 
reject out of hand any interpretation alternative to the accepted, “correct” Copen­
hagen one.
2. FORMALISM AND INTERPRETATION: AN EXAMPLE
Let us expand a bit upon this distinction between the two components of a 
theory that we mentioned above: namely, a formalism and an interpretation. We 
do not mean to imply that this division of a theory into the two components of 
formalism plus interpretation is necessarily unique, complete, or exhaustive. For 
our purposes in this chapter we need only the recognition that a formalism and 
an interpretation are two distinct, even if related, parts of a theory.
An interpretation is based on a (necessarily) incomplete examination of a 
formalism, since it is not possible to apply a given formalism to all conceivable 
situations and experiments (either actual or of the “thought” variety) in arriving 
at an interpretation of that formalism. That is, our “intuition” about the world is 
based very largely on those relatively few (but hopefully “typical”) cases or 
problems we can solve (often exactly). Thus, in the case of classical mechanics 
applied to the motion of a planet (mass m) about the sun (mass M), we might in 
thumbnail sketch represent the appropriate formalism in terms of Newton’s second 
law of motion.

James T. Cushing
On the basis of many applications (basically, the two-body problem and perturba­
tions thereof), we then develop an interpretation of the nature of the world 
governed by this system of laws. The picture, or folklore belief, that emerged 
historically was that of a completely deterministic, causal, (in principle) predict­
able physical universe. This intuition was based on the class of problems (today 
termed “integrable”) that yielded to the analytical tools available. However, the 
lesson of modern chaos theory, which has emerged in the last couple of decades or 
so, is that such integrable dynamical systems are quite atypical of classical 
mechanical systems. We now appreciate that a “typical” mechanical system (of 
which there are many even simple examples) can exhibit chaotic behavior so that 
we have really no predictive power about its long-term future behavior. That is, our 
intuition about the nature of classical mechanical systems was seriously wrong for 
about 300 years! The formalism (or equations) of classical mechanics has not 
changed, but, for many people, the interpretation most definitely has (although 
one could still accept an ontological determinism). With this as an elementary 
illustration of the difference between a formalism and its interpretation, let us now 
turn to the case of quantum mechanics.
3. THE “COPENHAGEN” INTERPRETATION
Entire books^8) have been written on the formalism of (nonrelativistic) 
quantum mechanics and we intend here only to sketch in the briefest (if some­
what vague) form, in terms of a few simple rules, the types of postulates that are 
usually employed in making quantum-mechanical calculations.
*
1. A state vector (e.g., i|j)—a vector, in a Hilbert space 3^, representing the 
state of the physical system.
2. A dynamical equation (e.g., the Schrodinger equation),
O) 
dt
giving the time evolution of the state vector under the influence of the 
Hamiltonian H for the physical system.
3. A correspondence between (hermitian) operators A in and physical 
observables a. These physical observables a can take on only the eigen­
values aj where
Ai|»y = 
(4)
*No claim is made that these postulates are complete, independent, or the most general ones possible. 
They are intended only as an illustration of a formal structure when a state vector <|/ can be used to 
represent a specific physical situation.

Causal Quantum Theory
41
4. Ensemble averages for a series of observations of a given as (i|j|A |i|j).
5. A projection postulate (either explicitly or effectively assumed) upon 
measurement
* = (5)
From this formalism follows the Heisenberg uncertainty, or indeterminacy, princi­
ple. This is related to Bohr’s complementarity principle. For our purposes here, a 
special case of complementarity that will serve as an illustration is the well-known 
wave-particle duality according to which a physical system (e.g., an electron or a 
photon) behaves either as a wave or as a particle, depending upon the context or 
environment. Applications of the formalism of quantum mechanics to (idealized) 
position-momentum measurements, double-slit arrangements, and the like lead 
to a picture, or interpretation, in which definite space-time trajectories cannot be 
maintained, specific possessed values of observables (such as all components of 
spin) are not possible at all times, event-by-event causality must be abandoned 
(to be replaced, perhaps, by “statistical causality,” whatever that may be), the 
process of measurement (the necessary and sufficient conditions for which are not 
spelled out in advance of its occurrence) assumes a central and highly problematic 
role in nature (i.e., the projection postulate or collapse of the wave function), 
and the passage to a classical limit (in terms of an underlying physical ontology) 
defies any coherent description. An examination of the formalism in specific 
Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) or Bohm correlation-type experiments shows 
the nonseparable nature of the theory and this gives rise to correlations that may 
imply the existence of nonlocal influences between spatially separated regions 
(really, at spacelike separations). So, on the Copenhagen interpretation of quan­
tum mechanics, physical processes are, at the most fundamental level, both 
inherently indeterministic (perhaps acausal?) and nonlocal. The ontology of 
classical physics is dead.
The Bell(9) theorems play an important role in this discussion.(10) The Bell 
inequality (of which there are actually several versions) and experimental re- 
sults<n) undercut the possibility of a local, deterministic theory to account for 
quantum phenomena. Also, the theory that is already widely accepted, namely 
quantum mechanics with the Copenhagen interpretation, is both indeterministic 
and nonlocal. So, it is tempting to leave things alone and stay with the present 
theory.
4. A LOGICALLY POSSIBLE, EMPIRICALLY VIABLE ALTERNATIVE: 
CAUSAL INTERPRETATIONS
Now that we have indicated that the formalism of quantum mechanics is not 
identical with, or need not include, the Copenhagen interpretation of that formal­

42
James T. Cushing
ism, let us outline an alternative, equally as empirically adequate interpretation of 
that same formalism. Once the existence of such a “causal” interpretation has 
been pointed out, we then turn to the question of its historical origin and of its fate. 
Perhaps the most direct way to introduce this is to discuss David Bohm’s causal 
interpretation/12) His basic idea is the following.
*
 Beginning with the (non- 
relativistic) Schrodinger equation (which is accepted, not derived, there)

equation of motion can simply skip to the next paragraph.

of the resulting expression yields

If U were identically zero, then Eqs. (9) and (11) together would represent a 
continuous “fluid” of particles of momentum
p = VS 
(12)
following well-defined classical trajectories. With this assignment for p = mv, the 
P = |i|>|2 of Eq. (11) can be given the interpretation of a probability density for the

distribution of particles, since Eq. (11) then becomes the standard continuity 
equation. However, even when U 0, we can use Eq. (12) to write

(13)
The last form of this expression, plus Eq. (9), imply that
$ = -V(V + U) 
(14)
or that
— = F 
dr
(15)
where F is the gradient of the potential energy, V + U. This potential energy now 
includes the familiar “classical” potential energy V as well as the “quantum” 
potential energy U. The quantum potential of Eq. (10) introduces highly nonclas- 
sical, nonlocal effects.
The reader, of course, need not be particularly concerned about or interested 
in the mathematical manipulations displayed in Eqs. (6) through (15). What is 
relevant, though, for our purposes here is that the dynamics of quantum mechanics 
can be put into the “Newtonian” form F = ma [Eq. (15)] and given a causal 
interpretation in which microscopic particles, such as electrons, follow well- 
defined trajectories in space-time. However, because of the influence of the 
quantum potential, these trajectories are very sensitive to the initial conditions 
(r0,v0) of the particles.
*
 Let us put the following gloss on this presentation of 
Bohm’s (1952) “causal” interpretation. The “wave function” represents the 
effect of the environment on the microsystem under consideration (here, a particle 
of mass m). This i|/is a solution to the Schrodinger equation (by analogy, perhaps a 
“generalization” of Poisson’s equation, which determines the potential V in 
classical mechanics) and it yields the quantum potential U via Eq. (10). This is the 
fundamental (ontological or epistemological) meaning of i|/. The causal interpreta­
* Although Bohm’s original papers were written in 1952, well before the advent and popularity of 
modern chaos theory, his general approach and several of his insights are forerunners of, and certainly 
consonant with, this current field of activity.

tion and the standard Copenhagen one are based on the same formalism and are 
indistinguishable in their predictions if the following three assumptions are 
made(13):
1. The field satisfies the Schrodinger equation [Eq. (6)].
2. The particle velocity is restricted to v = (l/m)VS [Eq. (11)].
3. The precise location of a particle is not predicted or controlled, but has a 
statistical (ensemble) distribution according to the probability density 
P(x,z) = |iV(x,r)|2-
These are logically independent assumptions. In particular, notice that i|> plays 
very different roles conceptually in (1) and (3). In our gloss of the formalism 
presented above, (1) and (2) would be taken as representing the quantum dynamics 
of a microsystem (influenced by a quantum potential through the wave function i|>). 
In response to why it should in addition be the case that the probability density P 
should happen to have the value |i|j|2, Bohm<13> has given an argument to show 
that any initial P such that P |i|j|2 would be “driven” to P = |i|i|2 by ran­
dom interactions and by the quantum dynamics [(1) and (2) above], much as an 
arbitrary initial distribution in (classical) statistical mechanics is driven to an 
equilibrium (Maxwell-Boltzmann) one through random interactions.
*
*Of course, form a purely logical point of view, one could simply demand (3) by fiat, as is essentially 
done for the Copenhagen interpretation.
It is not our purpose here to show in great detail the empirical indis­
tinguishability of this and of the standard interpretation of quantum mechanics. 
Such details can be found elsewhere/12’14) We have indicted how a radically 
different interpretation can be based on the standard formalism of quantum 
mechanics. It is also worth pointing out that there is no measurement problem in 
this causal interpretation and no collapse of the wave function/121 although all 
of the standard results, such as the Heisenberg uncertainty relations, still obtain. 
That is, there is no ontological rift between the classical and quantum worlds or 
domains. Furthermore, it is easy to state precisely when a system behaves 
classically: when the quantum potential [Eq. (10)] is negligible. Since Eq. (10) 
involves the wave function i|j, this becomes a property that the wave function must 
satisfy to be in the classical domain (a much more coherent criterion than some 
unrealizable and conceptually ill-defined “limit” such as ft —* 0). Bohm’s causal 
interpretation gives us a more (nearly) understandable (picturable) view of micro­
phenomena than does the Copenhagen interpretation, which merely leaves us with 
nothing comprehensible to say about the detailed physical behavior of a system 
between one preparation and a subsequent measurement. True, at this level of the 
causal interpretation, or “theory,” we have no understanding of the physical origin 
of the highly nonlocal quantum potential U that is responsible for those nonsepar- 
able features that are the hallmark of specifically quantum phenomena. Still, we 

Causal Quantum Theory
45
are better off with regard to understanding than with the Copenhagen interpreta­
tion. There is a reasonable analogy, perhaps, with classical Newtonian gravita­
tional theory with its (instantaneous) action at a distance. That property remained 
a mystery, even though a causal story could still be told about, say, planetary 
motion. A successor theory, Einstein’s general theory of relativity, replaced action- 
at-a-distance with gravitational waves propagating through a space-time geometry.
Another aspect of the causal quantum mechanics program has been various 
attempts to provide a physical underpinning for that interpretation. This project 
has proven to be quite difficult and it is important both to distinguish these efforts 
from Bohm’s logical exercise of his interpretation (outlined above) and to appreci­
ate that Bohm’s substructure in terms of his implicate order
*
14) is quite different 
from Vigier’s covariant ether approach.
*
15*16) We do not have space here to discuss 
these programs. At present, neither is complete and without its problems.
5. A MODERN “DOUBLE-SLIT” EXPERIMENT
Let us illustrate how the Copenhagen and causal interpretations of quantum 
mechanics handle the results of modern neutron interferometry experiments 
performed by Helmut Rauch and his co-workers in recent years in Vienna. This 
is the modern-day version of the familiar double-slit experiment. Figure 1 illus­
trates the experiment. The planes of a single crystal are used to Bragg-reflect/ 
transmit an incident, polarized, monochromatic (really, monoenergetic) beam of 
neutrons into two coherent subbeams (of equal intensity). The (four) crystal planes 
(all actually part of one single crystal that has been machined to form this 
interferometer) perform the same function as the double-slit arrangement for the 
older optical-type experiments. The small vertical arrows in Figure 1 represent the 
spin of the neutron. The incident beam of neutrons is completely polarized, which 
means here that the neutron spin points up along the z axis. The magnetic spin-flip

46
James T. Cushing
coils in beams I and II flip (with essentially 100% efficiency) the spin of the 
transmitted neutrons (to spin down along the z axis). The intensity of the incident 
beam is sufficiently low that just one neutron at a time is in the interferometer. 
(That is, a neutron enters and leaves the interferometer before the next neutron is 
incident upon the interferometer.) Consequently, each neutron can only interfere 
with itself—a truly quantum phenomenon. The radio-frequency spin-flip coils 
operate by exchanging a single photon of energy 
with the neutron (where cor is
the resonant frequency at which the coil is driven). Each coil is driven at slightly 
different resonant frequencies, cori and cor2. Hence, the two beams, when recom­
bined at the crystal plane on the far right of Figure 1, have slightly different 
energies (or “frequencies”) and so will exhibit a “beat” phenomenon in the 
intensity of this recombined beam (labeled the O beam). A straightforward 
application of the formalism of quantum mechanics (independent of any particular 
interpretation/17) leads to the prediction that the intensity of the recombined O 
beam should have the time variation
*
*To simplify the form of Eq. (16), we have written as the constant phase factor a what is actually the sum 
of a nuclear phase shift x (produced by the “x” slab of Figure 1) and a phase difference A between the 
two radio-frequency (rf) generators driving the two flip coils. However, all that is important for our 
discussion is that I0(f) of Eq. (16) has a time dependence [i.e., the (Aw)r term in the argument of the 
cosine].
tA point for development at length elsewhere is that one might expect, on the basis of an “intuition” 
based on the Copenhagen interpretation, that the photon exchange with one of the coils could (in 
principle, at least) constitute a measurement process, in which case there could be no interference in 
the final O beam. This is indicative of the problematic status of the projection postulate, which is to be 
applied whenever a measurement occurs. Unfortunately, “Copenhagen” does not specify (in advance) 
necessary and sufficient (physical) conditions for an (arbitrary) interaction to constitute a measure­
ment. When a measurement has occurred (i.e., no interference, say), then one applies, after the fact, 
the projection postulate. This is, at least, an incompleteness in that interpretation.
Zo(0 ~ 1 + cos [a - (A<o)f]

where
Aco = a)ri - a>r2 
(17)
The actual experimental results^17) show this interference or beat effect (see Figure 
2). That is, even though the “neutron” (via beam I or beam II) has exchanged a 
single photon of definite energy with one of the flip coils, no “collapse” of the 
wave function has taken place, since interference effects are exhibited in the 
recombined O beam.t
On the Copenhagen interpretation, we are effectively stranded with the 
formalism and its predictions, leaving as a mystery just how the neutron (wave? 
particle?) interacts with one flipper and yet produces interference. The exchange 
of a photon with one flipper would seem to indicate the neutron behaves as a

particle, yet subsequently it behaves as a wave (part traveling along path I and part 
along II within the interferometer) to produce interference in the emerging O 
beam. Copenhagen intuition (perhaps only a folklore gloss, though) typically 
leads one to expect wave or particle, depending upon the environment or experi­
mental arrangement. On the other hand, the causal interpretation (as outlined 
earlier in this chapter) assigns both a wave and a particle to the neutron. Detailed 
calculations^18’19) using the quantum potential show how energy and angular 
momentum are transferred by the quantum potential between the environment and 
a localized neutron (a particle) that passes through just one coil. Whether or not 
such experiments and analyses of them take the discussion of rival interpretations 
beyond the level of mere preference and empty heated debate may still depend 
upon one’s prior predilections pro or con “Copenhagen.” It remains relevant, 
though, that the experimentalist largely responsible for this neutron interferometry 
work remarks:
All of the observed interference phenomena can easily be explained in terms of wave 
mechanics, but it has to be considered that well-defined particle properties can be 
attributed to the neutron, too. ... So far it can hardly be imagined how the neutrons 
propagate as localized particles through the interferometer/20)
Similarly, the theorist Jean-Pierre Vigier sums up the tension between these two 
interpretations or world views as:
We are confronted by a stark alternative. Either (i) we renounce the independent 
existence of the neutron and with it any possibility of describing what happens in the 
neutron interferometry experiments. There exists then no possibility of explaining 
quantum phenomena, not even in terms of a wave/particle duality which only leads to 
ambiguity. Individual quantum phenomena are in principle and irreducibly indetermi- 
nist in character and there can be no form of physical determinism appropriate in the 
quantum domain or (ii) we adopt the quantum potential approach as the only known 
consistent manner in which the quantum world can be conceived and explained in terms 
of a physically determinist reality. Then, even if the quantum potential approach is not 
taken as the finally satisfactory description of quantum mechanical reality it at least 
shows in a clear way the features that such a description must entail/21)

Our purpose here has not been to resolve this tension definitively one way or 
the other. Rather, it has been to outline a case that at least one viable interpretation 
alternative to the widely accepted Copenhagen view exists. Even today this issue 
remains actively debated so that a causal interpretation need not be rejected on 
grounds of logic or empirical adequacy.
6. THE VALUE OF AN ALTERNATIVE INTERPRETATION
However, before we turn to the historical details of the emergence of quantum 
mechanics, let us consider some of the motivations for and values of studying an 
interpretation alternative to the standard Copenhagen one.
We might feel that there is little point in such an exercise since “Copen­
hagen” works and is consistent. But, even if this latter claim is accepted, the 
question of understandability remains. Does the Copenhagen interpretation give 
us a description of the world that we can understand in any meaningful sense of 
that term? That question is certainly open to debate. The quest for a more (nearly) 
understandable world view can be a motivating factor in seeking another inter­
pretation of a quantum formalism.
*
 These and other relevant factors have been 
concisely and elegantly stated by David Bohm in his classic 1952 paper:
The usual interpretation of the quantum theory is self-consistent, but it involves an 
assumption that cannot be tested experimentally, viz., that the most complete possible 
specification of an individual system is in terms of a wave function that determines only 
probable results of actual measurement processes. The only way of investigating the 
truth of this assumption is by trying to find some other interpretation of the quantum 
theory in terms of at present “hidden” variables, which in principle determine the 
precise behavior of an individual system, but which are in practice averaged over in 
measurements of the types that can now be carried out. In this paper and in a subsequent 
paper, an interpretation of the quantum theory in terms of just such “hidden” vari­
ables is suggested. It is shown that as long as the mathematical theory retains its present 
general form, this suggested interpretation leads to precisely the same results for all 
physical processes as does the usual interpretation. Nevertheless, the suggested inter­
pretation provides a broader conceptual framework than the usual interpretation, 
because it makes possible a precise and continuous description of all processes, even 
at the quantum level/25)
As a matter of fact, whenever we have previously had recourse to statistical theories, we 
have always ultimately found that the laws governing the individual members of a 
statistical ensemble could be expressed in terms of just such hidden variables/26)
The usual interpretation [i.e., in its finality and completeness] . . . presents us with a 
considerable danger of falling into a trap, consisting of a self-closing chain of circular 
hypotheses which are in principle unverifiable if true/27)
♦This is not the first time philosophers of science have discussed alternative causal interpretations of 
quantum mechanics/22-24)

7. OPPOSING COMMITMENTS, OPPOSING SCHOOLS
*
If neither empirical (in)adequacy nor logical (in)consistency provides a 
sufficient explanation, perhaps we might profitably consider other factors in such a 
choice between theories. Criteria such as fertility, beauty, and coherence, while 
often important, can have a Whiggish aspect to them if they are defined in terms 
of the successful, victorious, or accepted theory and then applied to a competing 
theory. We shall discuss such criteria when applied to the Copenhagen versus the 
causal interpretation. However, let us now turn to the influence of contingent 
historical events in the development of quantum theory. Could the philosophical 
outlooks and backgrounds of the creators of the “Copenhagen hegemony” have 
been important factors?
While it is not a new insight that there were two essentially independent 
routes to quantum mechanics, one leading to wave mechanics and the other to 
matrix mechanics/28) it is nevertheless important for our purposes here to see what 
were the basic philosophical or methodological commitments of these two oppos­
ing “schools.” This difference is often characterized loosely as determinism 
versus indeterminism. Although we indicate below that such a characterization is 
both too simplistic and also misplaced in its focus, we want first to emphasize 
that the concept of indeterminism as an essential feature of nature did not for the 
first time become a seriously considered option just in the early part of the 20th 
century with the advent of quantum physics. While it does not appear defensible to 
take seriously at face value a strong Forman-type thesis(29-31) according to which 
(external) social factors determine the very content of science, it is still the case 
that science is undeniably a historical entity in which contingency does play a 
major role. That is, the cultural/philosophical milieu within which science de­
velops and fashions its theories does provide a background of ideas and concepts 
that can influence (but neither uniquely nor solely) the direction of science. This is 
not intended as a denial of the crucial role played by internal factors (such as 
logical deduction and consistency, empirical adequacy, the scope of a theory, etc.), 
but it is meant to indicate that such external factors are not irrelevant to the 
scientific enterprise/4) Even though science often creates new concepts or signifi­
cantly modifies current ones, still, those concepts on offer at any given time can 
exert an influence on the debate over theory selection.
7.7. Cultural Milieux
By the late 19th century there were significant philosophical precedents for 
the concept of indeterminism in nature, as opposed to the straightforward deter­
minism often associated with classical physics/32’33) For example, Charles- 
Bernard Renouvier (1815-1903) questioned the causality principle for physical 
processes, challenged the (Kantian) doctrine that acceptance of causality was a

only touch on it.

precondition for human understanding, and held that an object and its representa­
tion cannot be divorced even in principle. Emile Boutroux (1845-1921) stressed 
contingency and inherent (i.e., not just representing our ignorance) chance in 
nature’s actions. Their thinking opposed belief in a completely rational universe 
and proposed instead an element of irrationality in a nature having contingent 
laws. In a given situation, there would be equally possible alternatives to what 
does, in fact, occur. Henri Poincare (1854-1912) read and was influenced by 
Renouvier, while Louis de Broglie and other founders of the quantum theory 
studied the writings of Poincare. It has been quite well documented that S0ren 
Kierkegaard’s (1813-1855) philosophy made an impression on Niels Bohr through 
the teachings of Harald H0ffding (1843-1931). Not only had Bohr attended 
H0ffding’s lectures as a student, but he also read his works and corresponded with 
him later in life. Bohr explicitly acknowledged the influence of H0ffding’s 
philosophy on his own formulation of complementarity/34) One of H0ffding’s 
tenets was that in life decisive events proceed through sudden “jerks” or discon­
tinuities. The point here of these brief comments is not that these philosophical 
currents alone determined the course of quantum theory in the early part of this 
century, but rather that these concepts were available to, and in the minds of, the 
creators of quantum theory and, we shall argue, did exert an influence on the 
choice of the final, “accepted” form of quantum theory. And, of course, logical 
positivism was a part of this backdrop with its emphasis on the central role of the 
empirical determination or definition of a term.
Consonant with this theme is Brush’s study(35) of the philosophical back­
ground to quantum mechanics. Brush sees the rise of indeterminism (or the fall of 
determinism) as having its roots in the 19th century and growing gradually. For 
him, the primary opposition of concepts in the evolution of quantum mechanics 
was realism versus instrumentalism (“positivism”). In his reconstruction, the 
acceptance or consideration of indeterminism had its roots in thermodynamics. In 
the larger arena of Western intellectual history, Brush contrasts romanticism with 
realism and claims there has been an oscillation between these two poles and that 
this has gone through several cycles in modern times. To look ahead a bit in our 
argument, we can see how these different philosophical commitments came to be 
focused, through an examination of specific problems in quantum physics, into the 
following opposing positions/36’37)

Our goal here is to see what were the prior philosophical or metaphysical 
commitments that the key figures in the formulation of quantum theory brought

51
with them to their study of problems in physics. We do not claim that such commit­
ments alone determine the theory formulated and finally accepted. Logic, data, 
and fertility are central factors, but, we argue, neither are they alone fully 
determinate of the theory. Both sets of factors must be taken into account. Of 
course, if the final decision between the two theories were a wholly rational one, 
independent of these prior metaphysical commitments (and this is by no means 
obvious in the case of quantum mechanics), then the origins of and reasons for those 
commitments, while perhaps interesting in themselves, would actually be irrele­
vant for the ultimate theory choice and for its “logical” justification. (This is just 
the usual distinction between the logic of discovery and the logic of justification.)
Since the Einstein-de Broglie-Schrodinger route will be considered first, let 
us look at the roots of Einstein’s philosophical commitments.
7.2. The Wave-Mechanics Route
Degen<38> argues that Einstein’s general position on foundational questions in 
physics—relativity, his stance on quantum theory, and his long-standing commit­
ment to a unified field theory—can best be understood as a search for the God of 
Spinoza. Einstein believed, according to Degen, that “. . . this God manifests 
himself in the rational structure of the external physical world, which the physicist 
tries to capture in a causal space-time theory.” Einstein’s basic Weltanschauung 
was that of a rational, causal world that could be comprehended in terms of an 
objective reality. He also acknowledged explicitly the philosophical influence on 
him of Poincare and MachJ3940) It is, of course, the intersection of general 
predilections like these with the puzzles presented by physical phenomena that 
results in a definite theory or research program.
To illustrate this, we now sketch how the opposing positions—wave- versus 
matrix-mechanics—were arrived at and what the arguments were for each view. 
The one traces its roots back to the nature of electromagnetic phenomena, the other 
to a study of (the discrete) spectral lines. So, not only does it turn out that the 
general philosophical outlooks of these two groups of key players were quite 
different, but also it was with very different classes of physical phenomena that 
each group began. The discontinuity versus continuity dichotomy is contingently 
rooted in philosophical commitments and in physical phenomena.
In 1909 Einstein used the Planck black body radiation law
Sttv2 f fhv\ I-1
p(v, T) = -^-(/ivKexpf — } - 1| 
(18)
and Planck’s energy quantization condition
e = hv 
(19)
to computed the mean square energy fluctuation for blackbody radiation in 
thermal equilibrium with another system(42)

(2°)
Einstein pointed out that the first term would be expected if radiation were com­
posed of independent particles (his “photons”) and the second term if radiation 
consisted of waves that could interfere with each other. At a conference in Salzburg 
in 1909, he stated(43):
It is my opinion, therefore, that the next phase of the development of theoretical physics 
will bring us a theory of light that can be interpreted as a kind of fusion of the wave and 
emission theories.(44)
In retrospect, we tend to see this as an early flirtation with the concept of wave­
particle duality.
In a paper on the quantum theory of radiation published in 1917, Einstein^45) 
showed that when molecules emit and absorb radiation under the influence of an 
external radiation field, then momentum and energy must each be conserved, so 
that such radiation was termed “needle radiation” by Debye/46) It is well known 
that Compton’s experimental work<47) on the scattering of radiation by electrons 
gave support to the hypothesis of free electromagnetic quanta/48) In 1922 Einstein 
and Ehrenfest analyzed the implications of the Stern-Gerlach results and con­
cluded that either energy conservation had to go or only radiation-emitting systems 
can be quantized/49) This was an early indication of the conceptual difficulties 
encountered when one attempts to construct pictures of atomic events. This would 
sharpen into a conflict between a representation in a continuous space-time 
background (“visualizability” of microevents) versus strict (event-by-event) en­
ergy conservation (and causality). In this same 1917 paper, Einstein stated that the 
recoil direction of the molecule, which has emitted radiation, is “. . . only deter­
mined by ‘chance, ’ according to the present state of the theory” (italics added) and 
that “the weakness of the theory lies ... in the fact. . . that it leaves the duration 
and direction of the elementary process to ‘chance.’ ”(5°) Here, as later, Einstein 
took this to be a shortcoming of the theory, a provisional fault to be overcome 
(hopefully) in the future.
The next key figure in this “continuity” school is, of course, Louis de 
Broglie. Not only was there little interest in quantum physics in France after World 
War I(51) (and France and Germany remained scientifically insulated from each 
other then), but even earlier in the century, theoretical physics there had fallen very 
much behind the times. L6on Brillouin (1889-1969) recalls:
The situation in France was serious. There was no regular course of applied mathe­
matics when I attended the Sorbonne—nothing at all. . . . There were really few people 
working in theoretical physics in France at that time. Theoretical physics was really at 
a low level when I was a student/52)

Causal Quantum Theory
53
There was certainly no existing tradition of research in quantum theory in France 
when Louis de Broglie was a student. What theoretical research there was was 
dominated by classical physics. It was Louis’s brother, Maurice, who was actively 
involved in experimental work on the photoelectric effect and who introduced the 
younger de Broglie to quantum physics. Abragam
*
53) has pointed out that Louis de 
Broglie was poor in foreign languages and rarely went abroad. In 1923 de Broglie 
initiated the theory of wave mechanics in attempting to understand the dual nature 
of Einstein’s photon. In his early youth, Louis de Broglie had been impressed by 
the well-known formal (mathematical) analogy between wave optics and classical 
particle mechanics/54) Building on this analogy and on some of his own previous 
work
*
55'57) on Einstein’s light quanta, de Broglie built a model of a particle that 
follows the trajectory of its associated phase wave. There was a great affinity of 
views between Einstein and de Broglie. In 1925 Einstein stated his opinion that 
de Broglie’s ideas “involve more than merely an analogy. ”(58) This is not 
surprising since Einstein had previously, in the context of general relativity, 
attempted to treat “particles” as the singularities in an underlying field.
This notice by Einstein drew attention to de Broglie’s work. Heitler recalls:
Upon this remark by Einstein, de Broglie’s paper was widely studied in Germany. I was 
a student at the time preparing for my Ph.D. in Munich under Sommerfeld, and 
de Broglie’s paper was discussed there too. Everyone had objections (they were not very 
difficult to find) and no one took the idea seriously. I believe this applied to most 
theoretical physicists—except Schrodinger/59)
Indeed, Schrodinger recalled that “My theory was stimulated by de Broglie’s 
thesis and by short but infinitely far-seeing remarks by Einstein, ’’t60*61) In a paper 
on Einstein’s gas theory, Schrodinger
*
62) concluded that photons can be seen as the 
energy levels of the “aether’’oscillators, that cavity radiation need not “. . . corre­
spond to the extreme light-quantum representation” and that
This means nothing else but taking seriously the de Broglie-Einstein wave theory of 
moving particles, according to which the particles are nothing more than a kind of 
“wave crest”* on a background of waves/63)
In that same year, Schrodinger
*
64’65) exploited Hamilton’s analogy between me­
chanics and optics to obtain his wave equation. Quantization was implemented by 
boundary conditions imposed on a continuous wave function. It is interesting to 
note in this connection that Schrodinger had early on acquired a mastery of 
eigenvalue problems in the physics of continuous media and that he was familiar 
with Courant and Hilbert’s book on mathematical methods in physics (in which 
such eigenvalue problems are treated in detail).
*
66) Also, since Schrodinger
♦Actually, de Broglie’s earlier theory had both a wave and a particle for each microentity, rather than 
just a wave with the particle represented by a crest on it.

54
James T. Cushing
worked out the relativistic case for hydrogen first (no spin, of course) and obtained 
an answer other than the Balmer formula and then put this work aside for some 
months before returning to the nonrelativistic case/67) it would appear as though 
his motivation and results owed nothing to Heisenberg’s formulation of matrix 
mechanics or to Pauli’s solution of the hydrogen atom with it. This is consistent 
with Schrodinger’s own comment in a note in his paper on the equivalence between 
wave- and matrix-mechanics:
I did not at all suspect any relation to Heisenberg’s theory at the beginning. I naturally 
knew about his theory, but was discouraged, if not repelled, by what appeared to me as 
a very difficult method of transcendental algebra, and by the want of perspicuity/68’69)
Our last thread in this part of our story is de Broglie’s proposal in 1927 of a 
principle of the double solution in which the basic entity is a wave, but having a 
singularity whose trajectory would correspond to a particle path.
*
 Because of 
mathematical difficulties with that proposal, at the 1927 Solvay Congress he 
presented a simplified pilot-wave model. We return to this subject later.
*If de Broglie had succeeded with this theory, he might have satisfied Schrodinger’s wish for a theory 
based on waves only, rather than on waves and particles.
What we have sketched, only in outline above, is one (historical) route to a 
formulation of quantum mechanics—namely Schrodinger’s wave mechanics. It 
should be evident that this small group (Einstein, de Broglie, and Schrodinger) 
of the creators of that theory shared a commitment to a continuous wave as the 
basic entity subject to a causal description. Visualizability and self-consistency 
had become accepted hallmarks of classical physical theories. As Hendry puts it, 
“. . . better to have an intelligible classical wave theory with flaws than a totally 
unintelligible ‘dual’ theory.”™ Furthermore, the creation of wave mechanics 
owed essentially nothing to any interaction with the other group to whom we 
turn—those who shaped matrix mechanics. Again, we shall see that this second 
group was also fairly small, independent, and quite closed. Now the position taken 
by the wave-mechanics school was the more “natural” one relative to the then- 
accepted concepts of classical physics (i.e., it represented a less radical depar­
ture). The other program, based fundamentally upon discontinuity (and a lack, 
even in principle, of event-by-event causality), however, finally carried the day in 
spite of its much more radical nature. So, it is all the more important that we 
examine the arguments that were seen as convincing in this choice.
7.3. The Matrix-Mechanics Route
The small number of central players (Bohr, Heisenberg, Pauli, Jordan, and 
Born) involved in the program that led to matrix mechanics suggests that we ask 
whether this, too, was a closed group. This becomes all the more plausible when 
we realize that Pauli and Heisenberg were both Ph.D. students with Sommerfeld at 

Causal Quantum Theory
55
Munich, each in succession were then Bohr’s assistants at Gottingen and later 
worked with Bohr at Copenhagen. Each of these young students was greatly 
impressed by Bohr’s 1922 Gottingen lecture /71> Jordan was also a student at 
Gottingen at this time. We have already indicated (philosophical) factors in Bohr’s 
own background that inclined him toward, or at the very least made him receptive 
to, a discontinuous structure in nature at the most fundamental level and, 
eventually, to a doctrine of complementarity between opposites. This element of 
discontinuous transitions is a central feature in his 1913 “semiclassical” model(72) 
for the hydrogen atom. This was certainly the current language for discussing 
atomic phenomena in Sommerfeld’s school. So, prima facie, there is a case that 
Pauli and Heisenberg as young students were impressionable and naturally 
accepted this central tenet of atomic theory. Incidentally, throughout his life, the 
ever-critical Pauli remained deferential toward his old teacher, Sommerfeld/73) 
However, this inclination toward credence is scarcely sufficient to account for the 
prevailing strength of this conviction on the discontinuity versus continuity issue. 
Belief74) sees discontinuities as the key issue in this formulation of quantum 
mechanics. Hendry<75> also stresses that causality, as such, was not the central 
question initially in the development of this program.
Largely due to the failure of certain classical approaches, the main players 
took up various philosophical positions on what was and was not possible in 
principle. That is, these were not logical or in-principle refutations, but strong, 
practical beliefs that became dogma.
*
 Thus, Bohr’s own Ph.D. dissertation argued 
that the failure of the classical electron theory of metals was attributable to a 
fundamental insufficiency of the classical principles themselves/76) Pauli, in his 
work on general relativity and related field-theory generalizations, convinced 
himself (again, because of a failure) that a continuum field theory, with the 
particles as singularities, was not possible/77) In his famous 1921 Theory of 
Relativity, Pauli already was of the opinion that “. . . there is no point in 
discussing . . . quantities [that] cannot, in principle, be observed experimen­
tally. ”<78) And, in the same vein, we find:
*Bell’s theorem provides an instructive contrast to this situation. That is, prior to, say, 1964, most 
physicists believed that a “hidden-variables” completion of quantum mechanics was impossible. 
However, after Bell’s work it was proven that a local, deterministic theory, agreeing in all of its 
predictions with quantum mechanics, is impossible.
Finally, a conceptual doubt should be mentioned. The continuum theories make direct 
use of the ordinary concept of electric field strength, even for the fields in the interior 
of the electron. This field strength is however defined as the force acting on a test 
particle, and since there are no test particles smaller than an electron or a hydrogen 
nucleus, the field strength at a given point in the interior of such a particle would seem to 
be unobservable, by definition, and thus be fictitious and without physical meaning/79)
This certainly has a strong operationalist air about it. By 1923, in a letter to 
Eddington, Pauli required operational definitions of anything used in physics and 

56

the replacement of continuous concepts by discrete ones/80) After all, observa­
tions are essentially localized and instantaneous, with measurements being dis­
crete and, he felt, this structure should be carried over into the foundation of any 
theory that accounts for such observations and measurements. He believed this 
would require major conceptual revisions. Both Pauli and Heisenberg had been 
involved in Bohr’s program of attempting to apply the old quantum theory, with its 
orbitals, to molecular systems and the utter failure of this approach convinced them 
that electron orbitals were meaningless/81’82) Also, a major logical difficulty of 
the old quantum theory with its visualizable orbitals was that, due to the quantiza­
tion requirement for orbital angular momentum, the orbitals had to be oriented in 
certain special ways in any field, however weakS3y> If a field in one direction were 
reduced slowly to zero and then gradually increased to some small value in 
another, it is not at all clear how the orbit could properly align itself (rather than 
simply precessing about the initial axis). The Stern-Gerlach experiments (1921— 
22) supported quantum predictions (notice the name—space quantization— 
originally used for this effect!), rather than a continuous (classical) magnetic 
moment/84) Pauli’s success with the Zeeman effect (1924) in terms of a classically 
nondescribable two-valuedness in the quantum-theoretical properties of the elec­
tron further strengthened his belief in nonvisualizability/85) He was convinced as 
well that the exclusion principle could not follow from classical mechanics or from 
the old quantum rules/86) Heisenberg began to be converted to Bohr’s and Pauli’s 
views on the failure of mechanics/87) The failure of the Bohr-Kramers-Slater 
theory (in which energy conservation had been given up) in 1925 indicated to Bohr 
that “. . . a complete renunciation of the usual space-time methods of visualiza­
tion of the physical phenomena. . .” would be necessary for further progress/88) 
Heisenberg’s matrix mechanics provided this.
Dirac was an exception in this group in that he had no particular interest in 
philosophical questions/89) He admitted finding de Broglie’s ideas beautiful, but 
could not take those waves seriously because he was so much embedded in the 
(old) Bohr theory with its orbits (which he took literally)/90) Dirac cared only 
about the equations and what could be calculated with them. Later, he took from 
Bohr the rejection of mental pictures in space-time. Perhaps like many (most?) 
physicists, Dirac was willing to leave the philosophical considerations to someone 
else. Dirac also made the interesting observation that, in his opinion, part of the 
reason for the great impact that general relativity made in 1919 after the end of 
World War I was the need to forget the old and to focus on something wonderful 
and new/91) This desire for a radical conceptual revolution was prevalent in the 
general cultural milieu of the time(92) and also, as we show below, in Pauli’s and 
Heisenberg’s expectations about quantum theory.
It was the “collision” between matrix mechanics and wave mechanics that 
provided the impetus for the formulation of a consistent interpretation of quantum 
mechanics. Although it is not uncommon for scientists to believe that there is just 
one (unique) law or theory, Kalckar<93) recounts that Bohr even as a child believed 
in the uniqueness (necessity) of natural laws. Such a belief would justify one in 

Causal Quantum Theory

looking for, or attempting to formulate, the correct version of quantum mechanics. 
Heisenberg’s faith in the finality of quantum mechanics was essential for his 
struggle to fashion the “Copenhagen” interpretation via his uncertainty relations. 
Beller puts this very forcefully:
In his recollections, Heisenberg repeatedly stressed that his belief in the completeness 
of this mathematical scheme of quantum mechanics led him to assume that nature works 
only in such a way as not to violate the quantum mechanical formalism. Heisenberg’s 
recollections regarding his belief are supported by correspondence at the time. This 
belief in the completeness of the mathematical scheme was essential—without it, 
Heisenberg, in the case of a discrepancy between “nature” and “formalism,” would 
seek to improve the formalism rather than to reinterpret nature. It is in this context. . . 
that Einstein’s dictum (“it is the theory which decides what we can observe”) 
“suddenly” approached the status of a guiding principle/94)
Born believed that microscopic coordinates were unmeasurable and, there­
fore, irrelevant/95^ Through his analysis of scattering processes with Schro­
dinger’s formalism, Born came to the opinion that even perfect initial information 
still led to uncertainty in the result and this implied, for him, a lack of causality/96) 
Apropos of these issues, Heilbron(97) asks what was the warrant for the comple­
mentarity principle as being complete and the final word in forbidding even the in­
principle possibility of a description of microphenomena that is both causal and 
pictured in a continuous space-time. His response is that (thus far) experience has 
shown the validity of complementary pairs of descriptions and that belief in the 
ultimate necessity of complementarity rests on the subjective epistemological 
criterion of the need for classical concepts and on the indivisibility of atomic 
phenomena (i.e., Bohr’s act of faith). Rosen summarized Bohr’s position as 
“[physical] reality is whatever quantum mechanics is capable of describing. ”<98) 
In Heilbron’s representation, the Copenhagen interpretation defined itself as true 
and strengthened its hold on physics, rewriting history so that Einstein, de 
Broglie, and Schrodinger largely fade from view, thus leaving “Copenhagen” 
as the only intelligible version of quantum mechanics/99)
Interestingly enough, it was some of the more mathematically inclined (and 
at times less philosophically committed) contributors who maintained an open­
ness on the question of the (physical) interpretation of the formalism. According 
to Hendry:
[Dirac] took great care to keep formalism and interpretation distinct and emphasized 
that the probabilistic interpretation did not follow from the formalism, as Born had 
suggested, but must rather follow from a separate association of theoretical and physical 
terms that included probabilistic assumptions/100)
Similarly, Jammer tells us that Hilbert recognized a certain freedom of choice in 
the interpretation of a formalism/101) These were, in fact, intertwined in the 
historical development of matrix mechanics. This contingency made it easy to 
accept a particular interpretation as an essential part of the formalism. Heisen­

berg’s position on the relation between the formalism and the interpretation fits 
such a scenario. A bit later we expand on this point.
Let us interject here that, once the Copenhagen interpretation had established 
its hegemony in Europe, this hegemony was essentially automatically extended to 
the United States. In her study of quantum physics in America prior to 1935, 
Sopka(102) shows that the American connection of young physicists (e.g., Urey, 
Lindsay, Dennison, Slater) was mainly through Copenhagen, Gottingen, and 
Cambridge (where the orthodoxy had already spread). Many American physicists 
were first alerted to the “new quantum theory” by Max Born when he visited MIT 
and other U. S. institutions in the winter of 1925-1926/103) Of 32 American visitors 
to Europe, all went to “Copenhagen”-doctrine centers (and none, for example, to 
France)/104^ America was still in a learning, catch-up phase prior to, say, 1930, 
and the pragmatic American approach to quantum mechanics led to an acceptance 
here, by and large without philosophical qualms. In the United States, notable 
achievements in quantum theory were in applications of a largely established 
formalism/105)
One can perceive, perhaps, a parallel (and not just in America) between the 
rapid spread of orthodox quantum mechanics (once the formalism had been fixed 
and the Copenhagen interpretation forged) and Newtonianism. There was an empha­
sis, by most of the rapidly growing band of practitioners, on computation as opposed 
to thinking about foundational questions. It is simplest and most efficient for 
disciples to follow the path of the master and use the scheme to calculate, carrying 
along without much reflection a certain amount of philosophical “baggage.”
8. FORGING THE “COPENHAGEN” INTERPRETATION
With this as background for the historical development that led to two 
opposing interpretations of the formalism of quantum mechanics, we can now 
summarize rather briefly how the Copenhagen interpretation came to be formu­
lated under the challenge that Schrodinger’s wave mechanics presented to the 
Gottingen-Copenhagen matrix-mechanics program and how this latter interpreta­
tion established its hegemony. Since we have argued that matters of logic and of 
empirical adequacy alone are insufficient for rejecting out of hand a causal 
interpretation, it can be little surprise that we must turn to other factors to pro­
vide an adequate explanation.
In fact, we return to the early days of the quantum formalism and the Solvay 
Congress of 1927. In 1923 Louis de Broglie put forward his concept of wave­
particle duality as extended to electrons and he further developed these duality 
arguments in his doctoral dissertation/106) Although, as we have seen, Einstein 
was impressed with de Broglie’s thesis, and Schrodinger’s own work on wave 
mechanics was influenced by de Broglie’s insight, de Broglie nevertheless had the 
reputation of being an unorthodox theoretician
*
107) and that did not condition the 
scientific community at large to consider his subsequent speculations seriously.

Also, the French scientific community had isolated the Germans for reasons of 
nationalism after World War I and this was not conducive to a flow of ideas 
between the Germans and the French.(108) But, of course, this can scarcely have 
been an absolutely determining factor since, after all, Schrodinger was Austrian 
and was receptive to de Broglie’s ideas. We have argued that a crucial factor in 
the relevant historical developments was a split in philosophical outlook along 
generational lines: the “older” essentially classical, worldview of people like 
Einstein, Schrodinger, and de Broglie versus a radically different, eventually 
indeterministic conception of physical processes engendered by the younger 
generation including Heisenberg, Pauli, Jordan, and Dirac. This tension between 
what we might term the “Nordic gang” (e.g., Bohr, Heisenberg, Pauli, Jordan, 
Born, with Dirac being an “honorary” member in this classification) and the likes 
of Einstein, Schrodinger, and de Broglie is a key element in appreciating how 
“Copenhagen” gained the ascendancy. Nor were the differences between these 
two groups merely philosophical. As we discuss in a bit more detail below, there 
was a very practical “social” or “professional” dimension to it as well.
We have cited some relevant personal, or even psychological, views of 
prominent members of the Copenhagen school. The prevalence of an empiricist- 
operationalist philosophical tendency among Heisenberg, Pauli, and Bohr can be 
traced in part (somewhat ironically, given Einstein’s later views) back to Einstein’s 
1905 relativity papers. This operationalist approach seems to have made a great 
impression and to have exerted a profound influence upon young German physi­
cists. Several such factors help us in understanding the vehemence of the 
Copenhagen school’s reaction against Schrodinger’s wave mechanics. Matrix 
mechanics had been formulated by Heisenberg, and developed by other members 
of the Copenhagen school, as an essentially abstract mathematical formalism 
with no physical interpretation. Heisenberg’s views on the nature of a successful 
mathematical formalism of a physical theory and of its relation to an interpretation 
were the following/109) He believed that a successful formalism, such as classical 
mechanics, was of a piece or whole and that it could not be modified in any 
essential way without destroying the entire structure. Thus, when such a formal­
ism encounters difficulties (as classical mechanics did with quantum phenomena), 
it is not possible to modify that formalism successfully. Rather, a radically new 
formalism must be found to accommodate these new features of the physical 
world. (In his later years Heisenberg came to see “Kuhnian” revolutions in science 
as a natural outcome of this sharp break between formalisms.) Not only did 
Heisenberg see a successful formalism as unique and of a whole, but he also held a 
remarkable view of the relation between a formalism and its interpretation.
In an interview in Munich on February 22, 1963, for the Archive for the 
History of Quantum Physics Thomas Kuhn discussed with Werner Heisenberg 
Heisenberg’s own reaction (in 1926) to Erwin Schrodinger’s development of wave 
mechanics. Heisenberg believed that one simply had to examine the formalism 
(here, of matrix mechanics) to find its proper interpretation. This view that a 
formalism gives (uniquely) its own (proper) interpretation made the appearance of 

60
James T. Cushing
Schrodinger’s (apparently) very different formalism (theory) quite disturbing for 
Heisenberg. This possibility, coupled with Bohr’s “defection” to the enemy camp 
when he wrote his paper on the statistical interpretation of (Schrodinger’s) wave 
function, produced in Heisenberg (so he told Kuhn in this interview) the fear that 
the physics community might take a wrong fork in the road and be led into error. 
Before any equivalence between the two formalisms had been established, the 
possibility of a wrong choice was a major concern (according to Heisenberg 
here) so that it remained essential to find the correct interpretation of matrix 
mechanics as quickly as possible. This became a major undertaking in Copen­
hagen with Bohr, Heisenberg, and Pauli. Later in this interview, Kuhn pressed 
Heisenberg about what might have happened if the equivalence (between matrix 
and wave mechanics) had taken longer to establish and if the theoretical physics 
community had gone the (“wrong”) Schrodinger route—might not physics have 
developed quite differently? While Heisenberg allowed that it might have for a 
while, he was certain that things would have come back to where they in fact have 
ended (to the truth? to matrix mechanics?). The point is that here Heisenberg 
affirms a belief in a unique, correct theory (one truth).
While Heisenberg’s responses to Kuhn in this interview remain on the lofty 
plane of objective truth and concern with physics not being misled into a wrong 
turn, there were other, much more practical and mundane, factors that lent urgency 
to the dispute/choice between matrix mechanics (Copenhagen) and wave me­
chanics. As Beller^111) and Cassidy^112) have made clear, the formalism of matrix 
mechanics had not had many successful applications (and, in fact, appeared to be 
bogged down in a mathematical morass) before Schrodinger’s wave mechanics 
allowed theorists to make a stunningly wide variety of well-supported calcula­
tions. Wave mechanics, not matrix mechanics, was the formalism employed by 
most theorists! This danger of losing the war on the calculational front threatened 
further consequences. Not only did Heisenberg have personal ambitions for 
advancement, but several chairs in theoretical physics were opening up in 
Germany. There was a conscious realization by members of the Copenhagen 
school that control of the future direction of theoretical physics was at stake. This 
group (our “Nordic gang”) had the talent, organization, and drive to carry the day 
in establishing the hegemony of the Copenhagen view/113) Heisenberg’s uncer­
tainty relation paper was a major step in accomplishing this. They worked in 
concert, while their opponents (Einstein, Schrodinger, de Broglie) pulled each in 
his own direction. The influence of the Bohr Institute in Copenhagen was 
enormous on an entire generation of leading theoretical physicists who passed 
through it (e.g., most of those who played dominant roles in establishing theoreti­
cal physics in the United States). It is also interesting to note that no French 
physicist ever worked at the Bohr Institute (at least not for any extended period 
of time).

visiting Copenhagen. In large measure the French excluded themselves (even if unconsciously) by

A crucial encounter occurred at the 1927 Solvay Congress. In 1927 Louis de 
Broglie proposed a “principle of the double solution,” according to which he 
suggested a synthesis of the wave and particle nature of matter/115) At the Fifth 
Solvay Congress in 1927, he presented some of these ideas in a form he termed the 
pilot-wave theory/1161 Here a physical particle is pictured as being guided by the 
pilot wave. In discussion at that Congress, Wolfgang Paul/1171 criticized de 
Broglie’s theory on the basis of the example of the inelastic scattering of a plane 
wave by a rigid rotor. Although de Broglie felt he understood the general outlines 
of a suitable response to Pauli’s^118* *1191 objection, he in fact did a poor job in 
attempting to rebut Pauli at the 1927 Congress so that his response appeared ad hoc 
and was not convincing then/1201 In addition to Pauli’s negative reaction to 
de Broglie’s paper, neither Einstein nor Schrodinger gave positive support to de 
Broglie’s ideas: Einstein because he did not like the nonlocal (or nonseparable) 
nature of the theory and Schrodinger because he wanted a theory based only on 
waves (not on waves and particles). And, de Broglie’s reputation of being an 
unorthodox theoretician did not help the situation. In addition, the people who 
were producing results with the matrix-mechanics formalism for problems involv­
ing spin (e.g., Heisenberg and Born who also spoke at the 1927 Solvay Congress) 
strongly favored the indeterministic or noncausal picture/1211 Bohr was for a long 
time against the concept of the photon/1221 so that de Broglie’s ideas had never 
spread rapidly in the Copenhagen school. The Institute at Copenhagen was a very 
closed community and those invited there were identified as the “respectable” 
theorists. De Broglie was never a member of this group. By 1930 when he wrote a 
very standard quantum-mechanics book, de Broglie had himself changed his mind 
about the pilot-wave theory: “It is not possible to regard the theory of the pilot­
wave as satisfactory. ”<1231 In that same book he rehearsed other arguments against 
the pilot-wave theory, both general conceptual ones<1241 and a specific thought 
experiment involving the reflection of light from an imperfect mirror/125’1261 Von 
Neumann’s 1932 impossibility “proof”<1271 for hidden variables theories further 
confirmed de Broglie’s position against his own previous theory/1281
their choice of the areas of theoretical physics in which they worked. Quantum physics simply was not 
a field of great activity in France at this time.
*A detailed summary and analysis of current work in the causal quantum theory program will be 
presented in a forthcoming case study. Discussion of some recent work on alternative interpretations of 
quantum mechanics can be found in Selleri (1990).(129)
9. AN ALTERNATIVE HISTORICAL SCENARIO?
*
There matters essentially stood until 1952 when David Bohm published two 
papers on a causal interpretation of quantum mechanics. (We have discussed 
this in Section 4.) Initially, de Broglie was against Bohm’s ideas (which were 
similar to his own pilot-wave theory of 1927) and he raised the same objections 
against Bohm’s theory that had been raised against his own/1301 Interestingly 

62
James T. Cushing
enough, when Bohm sent Pauli a copy of the paper in which Bohm showed Pauli’s 
objections to the causal interpretation to be specious, Pauli never responded/131) 
Furthermore, Pauli’s views on the nature of science and its relation to his 
conception of God (basically, a cosmic bookkeeper who enforced statistical 
causality) made it inconceivable to him that anything like a return to a “classical” 
world with causality and picturable, continuous processes in space-time was either 
possible or anything less than a disgusting loss of nerve and a return to dark­
ness/132) Bohm did, as we have seen, produce a causal version of quantum 
mechanics—one capable of a realistic interpretation with a largely classical 
(micro) ontology. Bohm’s work of the early 1950s reconverted de Broglie to his 
former ideas/133) For de Broglie the issue at stake was not (classical) determinism, 
but rather the possibility of a precise space-time representation for a clear picture 
of microprocesses/134) In this, his expectations were similar to Einstein’s, 
de Broglie felt(135) that classical Hamilton-Jacobi theory provided an embryonic 
theory of the union of waves and particles, all in a manner consistent with a realist 
conception of matter. With the concept of the quantum potential/136) one could 
provide a model for fundamental processes. This strong commitment by de Broglie 
to a realistic interpretation of the quantum formalism is consistent with his own 
high estimate of the work of Emile Meyerson (1859-1933), as stated by de Broglie 
in a preface to Meyerson’s Essais (1936)/137) Meyerson, an influential French 
philosopher of science, attempted to dispel the positivist bias and held that the 
goal of science is an ontological one/138)
Subsequent to Bohm’s papers, Edward Nelson<139 140) showed that a single 
particle subject to Brownian motion, with a diffusion coefficient (hIZm) and no 
friction, and responding to imposed forces in accord with Newton’s second law, 
F = ma, obeys (exactly) the Schrodinger equation. Although there is randomness, 
a radical departure from classical physics is unnecessary so that the resulting 
theory is probabilistic in a classical way/141) William Lehr and James Park<142) 
generalized Nelson’s work to the relativistic case. This alternative program has 
thus shown a great deal of fertility for generalization within its own resources, not 
just as ad hoc moves. That is, if, say in 1927, the fate of the causal interpretation 
had taken a very different turn and been accepted (over the “Copenhagen” one), it 
would have had the resources to cope with the generalizations essential for a 
broad-based empirical adequacy. We could today have arrived at a very different 
worldview of microphenomena. If someone were then to present the (merely) 
empirically equally as adequate Copenhagen version, with all of its own counter­
intuitive and mind-boggling aspects, who would listen!
That is, a highly “reconstructed” but entirely plausible bit of history could 
run as follows (all around 1925-1927). Heisenberg’s matrix mechanics and 
Schrodinger’s wave mechanics are formulated and shown to be mathematically 
equivalent. Hence, the Dirac transformation theory and an operator formalism are 
available as a convenience for further development of the formalism to provide 
algorithms for calculation. Study of a classical particle subject to Brownian motion

(about which Einstein surely knew something!) leads to a “classical” understand­
ing of the already discovered “Schrodinger” equation, which is then given a “de 
Broglie-Bohm” realistic interpretation. A “Nelson” model(139’140) underpins this 
interpretation with a visualizable model of microphenomena. “Bell’s” theorem^9) 
is proven and taken as convincing evidence that there is a type of nonlocality 
present in quantum phenomena. A “no-signaling” theorem(143 144) for quantum­
mechanical correlations is established and this puts to rest Einstein’s objections^145) 
to the nonseparability of quantum mechanics. This important point is the follow­
ing. If one considers a system S consisting of two subsystems Sj and S2 which 
are spatially separated at some time, then Einstein felt that “. . . the real factual 
situation of the system S2 is independent of what is done with the system 
SP . . .”<146) Einstein worried what it would even mean to do science if such were 
not the case. But, a no-signaling theorem would have shown that relativity could 
be respected at the practical or observational level and that the nonlocality present 
in nature was of a “benign” variety. This could reasonably have been enough to 
overcome his objections to the nonlocal or nonseparable nature of a “de Broglie- 
Bohm” interpretation of the formalism of quantum mechanics. Exhibiting explicit 
wave solutions with particle-like singularities^147’148) could also have satisfied 
Schrodinger who wanted a theory with waves as the fundamental physical entities. 
That is, these developments, which could (conceptually and logically) have taken 
place around 1927, could have overcome the resistance of Einstein and of 
Schrodinger to supporting a “de Broglie-Bohm” program. As is well known, 
Madelung^149) in 1926 already had the same equations Bohm would employ in 
1952, but his interpretation was very different from Bohm’s and did not carry 
conviction. Bohm’s interpretation would certainly have been possible in 1927. 
These models and theories could be generalized to include relativity and spin. The 
program is off and running! Finally, quantum statistics follow naturally in a causal 
stochastic interpretation^150) and this causal interpretation can be extended to 
quantum fields. *< 14’16’151)
*It is not the intention of this sketch to imply that one would have to go a stochastic route as opposed to 
Bohm’s quantum potential one.
It is essential to appreciate that this “story” is neither ad hoc (in the sense of 
these causal models having as their sole justification an origin in successful results 
of a rival program) nor mere fancy, since all of these developments exist in the 
physics literature. However, “Copenhagen” got to the top of the hill first and, to 
most practicing scientists, there seems to be no point in dislodging it.
10. INTERNAL VERSUS EXTERNAL EXPLANATIONS
It has not been our intention here to argue in favor of a Bohm type of 
interpretation of quantum mechanics over the standard Copenhagen one. Rather, 

64
James T. Cushing
our interest has been to see whether a very different choice (from the actual 
historical one) might reasonably have been made. In the present case, we have 
seen that neither internal factors (such as logical consistency, empirical adequacy) 
alone nor external ones (say, sociological, psychological) alone are sufficient to 
account for the wide acceptance of the Copenhagen worldview in place of a causal 
one. That is, while “facts” alone do not uniquely constrain theory construction 
and selection, neither can one’s predilections alone enforce just any theory/152) 
Nature provides (often tight) constraints, but there still remains latitude in theory 
choice (here, an interpretation or worldview). The actual course of theory con­
struction and selection is a rich and involved one with many overlapping factors. 
Science, even in its products or laws, remains historical or contingent in an 
essential manner. That is, how things might have gone a very different way at 
certain crucial junctures and why they did not may be as important as the reasons 
for the “right” choices that science has made. We are not particularly uncomfort­
able with a lack of inevitability in other areas of history. That point is nicely 
made in the review of a book which examines whether it was inevitable that the 
Confederacy should lose the United States Civil War in the 19th century.
Inevitability is an attribute that historical events take on after the passage of sufficient 
time. Once the event has happened and enough time has passed for anxieties and doubts 
about how it was all going to turn out to have faded from memory, the event is seen to 
have been inevitable. Different outcomes become less and less plausible, and before 
long what did happen appears to be pretty much what had to happen. To argue about 
what might have happened or whether and why the presumably inevitable turned out 
to be thought so strikes many people as a waste of time/153)

CHAPTER 4
Duality of Fluctuations, Fields, 
and More
Peter E. Gordon
1. INTRODUCTION
Much of the contemporary literature on duality is an attempt to eliminate the 
concept. That is, it consists of efforts to account for phenomena without introduc­
ing the wave-particle duality.
Surdin(1) questions whether the “photon concept is really necessary?” by 
substituting wave packets. Marshall^ tries for a duality without particles while 
Bach’s(3) particles simulate wave behavior. Garuccio’s(4) enhanced photon detec­
tors produce the effect of duality without the basic property. The list of these 
ambitious and well-developed strategies could be extended.
Another approach is to dissolve the mystery or dilemma of duality by 
physically unifying the subject. Chief among these ideas is the coexisting wave 
and particle of de Broglie and more recently Selleri/5)
Our approach is to accept duality and to attempt to broaden the concept. Our 
idea of duality is as a dynamic property whose consequences have not yet been 
fully explored. In fact, after extending its applicability, we advance duality as a 
worldview.
In the next three sections, we try to add to the properties of light to which we 
apply the wave-particle duality. In Section 2 we generalize Einstein’s original 
result for the fluctuations of blackbody radiation to apply to any field. We do 
this by separating the operators for the fluctuations into wave and particle parts 
according to criteria drawn from the quantum theory of coherence. We define

orders of wave fluctuation which we relate to mth-order coherence. We apply this 
to the wave-particle fluctuations of nonclassical states and relate the wave 
fluctuation to squeezed states.
In Section 3 we inquire as to what extent the fields themselves can be 
separated into wave and particle parts. We reach certain conclusions which we 
apply to nonclassical states and to the vacuum.
In Section 4 we look at the two radiation processes, spontaneous and 
stimulated, asking what this duality has to do with the wave-particle duality. We 
propose a model for stimulated emission in terms of the nonclassical states 
discussed earlier and compare the results of this model with those of recent 
experiments. We offer yet another argument relating spontaneous emission and the 
vacuum fluctuations. For each radiation process we examine the stimulation 
process separately from the emission process. We conclude this section with a 
hypothesis regarding radiation.
In Section 5 we analyze a number of experiments proposed and performed 
with the object of detecting the wave. We try to show in each experiment that the 
wave is unobservable and propose this as a principle; that half of the duality, 
the wave, is not directly observable.
In Section 6 we look at the consequences of this unobservability and its rela­
tion to measurement, and the relation of wave-particle duality to measurement.
We close by presenting duality as a worldview. Einstein’s reality may be 
difficult to resurrect. Duality offers us an alternative.
2. DUALITY OF FLUCTUATIONS
The first clear indication of the wave-particle nature of light was due to 
Einstein. He showed that the fluctuations in blackbody radiation, with which he 
and Planck were concerned at the time, could be divided into two parts: one part 
is derivable from the wave properties of light, the other is due to its particle 
properties.
We will begin by deriving Einstein’s original separation using the methods of 
the quantum theory of coherence. We will generalize Einstein’s result from blackbody 
radiation. We will do this by showing that the operators for the fluctuations can be 
separated into wave and particle parts. Our results will then hold for any field.
2.7. Generalized Wave-Particle Fluctuations
One reason for generalizing the separation of the fluctuation is that dualism 
is not confined to blackbody radiation and so the separation of the fluctuation 
should not be either. We demonstrate this separation of the fluctuations to second, 
third, and fourth orders explicitly. By defining orders of “wave” fluctuation we 
give new definitions of mth-order coherence and mth-order coherent states. It is 

Duality of Fluctuations, Fields, and More
71
interesting to see that the concepts of dualism can be used to reproduce quantita­
tive results of contemporary theory.
The fluctuations in number may be expressed as
(An)2 = n + n2 
(1)
Einstein<6> showed that the first term would arise from a system consisting of 
independent particles and the second from a system of waves.
We would like to generalize Einstein’s result using the methods of coherent 
states/7)
We will separate the operators for the fluctuation into two parts according to 
the following definitions:
1. The first, or “particle” part, will give the Poisson fluctuation.
2. The second, or “wave” part, will give a zero result when applied to a 
coherent state.
This is a reasonable definition in view of the association between the coherent 
state and the classical wave. The definite-valued wave gives zero “wave” fluctua­
tion, i.e., no fluctuation beyond the Poisson. An operator for the fluctuation which 
gives zero on the coherent state will therefore be called a wave fluctuation.
In general, the wave fluctuation will be nonzero. Its value will depend on the 
nature of the state. We will see that for blackbody or Gaussian radiation it gives 
the usual result. Notice that the wave fluctuation is defined with reference to the 
field, i.e., to the coherent state. The fluctuations are in terms of the number 
operator. We will discuss fluctuations of the field in the next section.
The simplest case is the second-order fluctuation in n, the case considered 
by Einstein:
(An)2 = (a+a - (n))2
= a+a + a+a+a'a — 2a+ (n) + (n)2
= a+a + W 
(2)
The first term gives the Poisson fluctuation while the second, which we have 
labeled W2, gives zero for a coherent state,
<a|W2|a) = 0 
(3)
while giving of course (n)2 for the well-known wave fluctuation of the Bose- 
Einstein distribution described by the Gaussian density operator
P(a) = (ir(n))~ 1e“ lal2/<n)
(4)

72
Peter E. Gordon
We note for future reference the third- and fourth-order Poisson fluctuations:
Poisson n 
(5)
(^Poisson = 3n2 + n 
(6)
For the third-order case we have
(An)3 = n3 - 3rP {n) + 2<n)3
Using
(a+a)3 = (a+)3a3 = 3(a+)2a2 + a+a
we calculate
(An)3 = a+a
+ [2(n)3 - 3{n)(a+)2a2 + (a+)3a3]
+ [3(a+)2a2 - 3<n>2]
= a+a + W&> 
(7)
where we have bracketed terms of the same order to show that goes to zero 
in the limit of a coherent state.
The wave fluctuation is of course nonzero for general states and may be 
calculated.
As an example, the third-order wave fluctuation for |y) or blackbody radiation 
[the distribution Eq. (4)] may be calculated from
(y|W(3)(a+,a)|y> = Tr{W<3)(a+,a)p} 
= (ir(n)-1W(3)(a
*
 ,a) 
• exp — |a|2/(n)J2a
which holds because W(3) (a+,a) is normal ordered. We then get
<y|W(3)|y> = 2<n>3 + 3<n>2 
(9)
In fact, these methods can be used to obtain a quantitative measure of the 
wave fluctuations of any field.
The fourth-order Poisson fluctuations Eq. (6) differ from the second and third 
orders so that it is worthwhile to see whether this separation holds in the fourth 
order.
We make use of an expansion for normal-ordered moments J8)

73
(a+a)v = S ( S -77-------T7 )(a+>an 
(10)
Ji \ 7) T]!(p, - 7])! /
[The coefficients (for the normal-ordered moment) are called homogeneous 
product sums and are equal to the product of the first jjl integers taken v at time, 
repetitions allowed.] First we expand
(a+a — (n))4 = (a+a)4 — 4(a+a)3{ri)
+ 6(a+a)2 (ri)2 — 3(n)4
Using Eq. (10), we have
(An)4 = [(a+)4a4 - 4{n)(a+)3a3 + 6{n)2(a+)2a2 - 3<n>4]
+ [6(a+)V - 12(ri)(a+)2a2 + 6(n)2a+] + [7(a+)a2 - 7<n>2]
+ 3<n>2 + (ri) = 3<n)2 + <n) + W 
(11)
We have again grouped terms of common order to show that W(4) gives zero 
for a coherent state leaving the fourth-order Poisson fluctuation.
Note that these results are for operators and therefore apply to any field, not 
just blackbody radiation.
2.2. Nonclassical States
Now we would like to apply these methods to nonclassical states, states with a 
limited number of photons. This will later allow us to consider the dualistic 
properties of the vacuum.
The concept of wave fluctuation may be used to define mth-order coherence^ 
and mth-order coherent states.
We recently explored properties of second-order coherent states/10) The states 
satisfy the second-order coherence condition
(II\: (a+a)2: \II) = </Z|a+a|n)2 
(12)
where the dots denote normal ordering.
For a state containing up to two photons in a given mode we have states of the 
form
2
\II) = Scn\n) 
(13)
n—0
Assuming the normalization condition
(14)

74
Peter E. Gordon
as well as Eq. (12) we obtain (up to a phase factor) a one-parameter family of states 
in which
r (n\2 
-11/2
|co| = [1 + 
- <n)
|CJ = [<n> - (n)2]1/2
|C2| = %n)
(15)
(16)
(17)
with (n) denoting the average number of photons in a given mode. We note that Eq. 
(16) implies that the value of (n) is limited to
0 « (n) =£ 1 
(18)
The second-order coherent state with maximal (n) is
|Z7) = Vi|O) + VI|2) 
(19)
Calculation shows that although
= 0 
(20)
we have
¥= 0 
(21)
Wave fluctuations may therefore be used to define orders of coherent states: 
mth-order coherent state has zero wave fluctuation up to mth-order This 
definition is equivalent to that for mth-order coherence, e.g., Eq. (12).
The state equation (19) exhibits nonclassical behavior^; that is, its P(a) is 
negative in some regions and cannot be interpreted as a probability or must be 
interpreted as probability with negative values/11) In fact, any field which has zero 
second-order wave fluctuations and nonzero wave fluctuations of a higher order 
behaves nonclassically.
We will be exploring the dualistic properties of nonclassical states. Recently 
a type of nonclassical states called “squeezed states” have been introduced into 
the theoretical and experimental literature/12) We can type the various states 
conveniently in terms of the second-order wave fluctuation operator:
W = a+a+aa - 2a+a{n} 4- <n)2 
(22)
Note the presence of the negative term in W&X It allows for the existence of 
squeezed states.

3. DUALITY OF FIELDS
Having separated the fluctuations it is natural to attempt to extend this 
separation to the fields themselves. To what extent can the fields be separated into 
wave and particle parts?
The duality of fields would, like the duality of fluctuations, show wave and 
particle parts being displayed simultaneously. We do not, however, have in mind 
any spatial separation of light into waves and particles. Photons in any case cannot 
be localized in the same sense that a particle in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics 
can be located. About the difficulty of placing the wave in space and time we will 
have more to say later. So, although particles and waves are often described 
visually, we do not hold out hopes for a visualizable model of duality.
We will treat in turn classical and nonclassical fields because, as we will see, 
our method of separating classical fields does not apply to nonclassical ones.
3.1. Classical Fields
Classical fields can be described by a positive definite probability function 
P(a). For these fields the convolution theorem allows us to separate P(ot) into 
two parts:
1. A coherent state with
Pw(a) = 82(a - a) 
(23)
where
a = J aP(a)J2a 
(24)
is the mean value of the total field.
2. A field P(ot + a) for which the mean value vanishes and is commonly 
known as an unphased field:
J aP(a + a)<Pa = 0 
(25)
In the terms of the convolution theorem, we have
P(a) = J 8(2)(a - a - a')P(a' + a)d2a' 
(26)

76
Peter E. Gordon
The coherent state, P(a) = 8<2\a — a), is as close as we can get to a classical 
wave in quantum theory. It is in fact a classical wave plus the (unavoidable) 
vacuum fluctuations. For these fields the amplitudes add as in classical wave 
theory; that is, it will interfere as a classical wave.
For unphased fields on the other hand, the intensities add. When combining a 
number of such fields we can add the number of “particles” in each unphased 
field to get the number in the total field.
Of course the unphased field is not exactly a set of classical particles any 
more than the coherent state is exactly a classical wave. Second-order correlations 
for this state will differ from those for the Gaussian, as an example.
This separation of the field allows us to discuss the fluctuations of the field 
(Aa)2. All of our results on the duality of fluctuations in the last section were in 
terms of the number operator. The field was brought in only to define the wave 
fluctuations W(nl
The fluctuation of the field operator for the coherent part of the field is zero, 
because the coherent part of the field is a delta function in a.
For the unphased field we have for the mean number of equivalent particles
^unphased = f la|2p(“ +
= J |ot + a|2P(a + a)d2a — a2
= |c?| - |J5| = (Aa)2 
(27)
The fluctuations of the field do not divide up neatly into wave and particle 
parts like the fluctuations for the number operator. But the above result does show 
dualistic properties:
The means square fluctuation (the variance) of the amplitude of the total field 
is equal to the average number of particles in the unphased part of the field.
Let us do a number of “checks” on this conclusion. Consider the number of 
particles in the other part of the field:
<">coherent = I H2&2(« ~ a)rf2a = |a|2 
(28)
Combining the number of particles in each part of the field
<”>unphased + ^coherent = PI “ l“|2 + l“P = l^l (29)
Since
|a2| = J |a2|P(a)d2a = (n)total field 
(30)
we have
^^unphased + ^coherent ~~ total field

Duality of Fluctuations, Fields, and More
77
Now consider the special case
«nphased = « = (A«>2 
(3D
We have:
1. No fluctuation of the field
2. Total field = |a> (because 
= 0)
Now let us introduce a result in order to draw another conclusion. Hillery/13) 
and earlier Aharonov et al. ,(14) showed that for a classical P(ot) any pure state must 
be a coherent state |ot).
In terms of our results we see that in order for a classical state to have particle 
properties it must be a mixture. In fact, we can say that particles are the mixture 
properties of states. That is, insofar as a classical state can be said to consist of 
particles it must be a mixture.
We will demonstrate the same property in nonclassical states.
A particular example of unphased fields is P(|a|) which does not depend on 
the phase of a. Such stationary fields have density matrices in the number 
representation which reduce to diagonal form. They are thus equivalent to a 
mixture of number states. Laser light is often described as a convolution of the 
Gaussian P(a) [Eq. (4), another mixture of number states] and the coherent state.
This then is the extent to which fields with positive-definite P(ot) can be 
separated into wave and particle parts.
3.2. Nonclassical Fields
Not all superpositions of the number states can be described by a positive- 
definite P(a). We met up with such a state in Eq. (19). These nonclassical states 
have regions where P(ot) is negative but which cannot be observed because of 
the vacuum fluctuations. That is, the negative values are restricted to a range so 
small that they are always averaged out by the classical observation. We will 
elaborate on this point after discussing the vacuum in the next section.
Because of this property the diagonal of the density matrix of the field (ot|p|ot) 
is better suited for the description of these nonclassical states. Using it we may 
attempt to characterize such states dualistically.
To do this let us first write down (a|p|ot) for two states which we have 
characterized as particlelike:
Gaussian:
1 f —1
<aW“> -
(32)

78
Peter E. Gordon
Number state:
<a|p|ot) =
exp -|a|2
(33)
Notice that both of these states are functions of | ot|. Now let us turn to the coherent 
state
P(a) = 82(ot - a0) 
(34)
and
<a|p|«>ao = exP-|a - aol2
= exp{-|a|2 - |a0|2 - 2Reaaocos(0 - 0O)} 
(35)
We see a clear dependence on the phase angle 0.
Now let us analyze the nonclassical state Eq. (19) in the same way. The 
density matrix (a|p|ot) can be calculated as
z । । K 1 । 12 r <* 2 + (ota)2 a4l
<o-|p|«>77 = -e“|a| 
+-----^2-----+ ~2j
—+ \/2|a|2cos20 +
(36)
We see that the wave properties of this nonclassical state are separated out 
explicitly in the middle phase-dependent term of the right-hand member of Eq. 
(36). As further evidence of this, note that a mixture of |0) and |2) would give the 
other two “unphased” terms. That is, the density matrices for the vacuum and the 
two-photon state are the first and third terms of Eq. (36), respectively. The 
coherence between these states is responsible for the coherent state |II) and gives 
the middle term of Eq. (36). This phase dependence is characteristic of stimulated 
emission.
This is in line with our conclusions about classical fields. The pure state 
Eq. (19) shows wave properties. It may be of interest to see that the state is pure by 
noting that its density matrix in the ^-representation obeys

Duality of Fluctuations, Fields, and More
79
Wave and phased properties go with the pure state; particles and unphased 
properties belong to the mixture. This is an indication of a relation between 
measurement and duality which we will turn to later.
3.3. The Vacuum
Our interest in the density matrix formulation and in duality itself extends to 
the vacuum. Each of our fields Eq. (32) to Eq. (35) reduces to the vacuum
according to the following prescriptions:
Gaussian (ri) —> 0 
(38)
Number state n —> 0 
(39)
Coherent state a0 —> 0 
(40)
All lead to the same density matrix for the vacuum:
<“|pla>vac = exp-|a|2 
(41)
The fact that different limit procedures lead to the same state Eq. (41) shows that 
the vacuum is continuous with other states of the field. We will consider these 
limits [Eqs. (38)-(40)] again. According to our “unphased” criterion for particle 
properties of state
<“|p|a>particles = /<lal) 
<42)
we conclude that the vacuum is a particlelike state. This is not a new idea but 
we are presenting it in the context of our discussion of duality. Born, Heisenberg, 
and Jordan long ago noted that the particlelike term in the fluctuations (of a thermal 
field) and the zero-point energy of the harmonic oscillator are closely related. We 
will explore this relation further in the next section.
The structure of the coherent state itself is of interest in this discussion. It 
may be considered a classical wave of amplitude a0 on which is superposed the 
vacuum fluctuations. When the classical wave—ot0—vanishes, the vacuum fluctu­
ations remain.
Note that the structure of the vacuum itself [Eq. (41)] prevents the observation 
of the negative values of P(a) for nonclassical states mentioned at the start 
of Section 3.2. P(a) satisfies the condition
f P(ot)exp-|a - p|2J2a 0 
(43)
which must hold for all complex values of p. It corresponds to the positive defi­
nite nature of the diagonal of the density matrix

(a|p|a) 
0 for all complex a 
(44)
Equation (43) is not strong enough to keep P(a) from having negative values, but 
it does place restrictions on the range of these values. Suppose we consider the 
range of values around the vacuum [3 = 0. Equation (43) becomes
f P(a)e-I“l2d2a 
0 
(45)
We see that the factor in Eq. (45) has the same structure as the vacuum equa­
tion (41).
The classical theory only applies to ranges of the field larger than the zero­
point fluctuations. The measurement is ‘smeared out’ over this range. An observa­
tion gives us only an average of P(a) over the range.
Equation (45) tells us that such an average will always be positive.
When P(a) tends to vary little over the range, that is, when P(a) is identical 
with its average over this range, then we are dealing with a classical field.
Finally we can calculate the average number of particles in this particular 
unphased field, the vacuum. We obtain

4. DUALITY OF THE RADIATION PROCESS
4.1. Two Kinds of Radiation Processes
From the time of Einstein two kinds of radiation processes have been 
postulated, spontaneous emission and stimulated emission. In line with our 
general program we would like to ask the following question: to what degree can 
we extend wave-particle duality to the duality of emissions, stimulated and 
spontaneous? Many physicists question whether there is a duality of emissions at 
all, whether spontaneous emission really differs from stimulated emission. We 
will propose an answer to this question at the end of this section.
In order to do this we will investigate the dualistic nature of the radiation 
process. We will treat the stimulation process and the emission process separately. 
And we will separate each treatment in turn in terms of spontaneous and 
stimulated radiation.
We proceed according to the following plan:
• Section 4.2—spontaneous emission
• Section 4.3—stimulated emission: the Pfleegor—Mandel experiment

Duality of Fluctuations, Fields, and More
81
• Section 4.4—stimulation of stimulated emission: the Blake-Scarl experi­
ment
• Section 4.5—stimulation of “spontaneous” emission
• Section 4.6—a hypothesis
4.2. Spontaneous Emission
Quasi-classical models of radiation have long associated stimulated emission 
with coherence and waves. The author some time ago(15) presented a model of the 
formation of pulses of coherent radiation through the stimulated emission process. 
In terms of photons, one says that the stimulated photons have a common phase, 
resulting in coherence and a classical-like wave. This type of explanation begs the 
question of how individual photons can have a phase at all.
Spontaneously emitted light, on the other hand, at least at a low density in 
phase space, adds and behaves like particles/16) But we must consider that, at a 
high density in phase space, spontaneously emitted light also behaves like a wave. 
We can distinguish these two types of emission if we think of a wave in terms of 
second- or higher-order coherence, or equivalently, as having higher-order wave 
fluctuations equal to zero. Only stimulated emission can produce such light. 
Spontaneous emission, however intense, produces only first-order coherence. Any 
second-order experiment performed on light resulting from spontaneous emission 
will fail to show coherent of that order. The Brown-Twiss experiment was of this 
type.
Experiments of a second order will show nonzero wave fluctuations for 
any spontaneously emitted radiation. On the other hand, stimulated emission will 
show 
= 0
for 
n m
where m may be a quite high number.
We will define particle behavior as
#= 0
(47)
This has the effect of classifying as particlelike the light used in all of the 
great interference experiments done before the introduction of lasers. To this 
objection we can only say that second-order experiments were not available at the 
time.
This definition states that in any experiment involving second- or higher-order 

82
Peter E. Gordon
correlation properties between pairs or greater numbers of photons, we can say that 
spontaneously emitted light behaves like particles.
4.3. Stimulated Emission
With stimulated light it is not clear that we should talk about atoms emitting 
photons at all. Just this difference is brought out by the Pfleegor-Mandel 
interference between independent lasers/17) Conditions of the experiment are such 
that the intensity is low enough so that no more than one photon is likely to be 
present in the system at any one time.
Interference between the lasers shows that the photons do not come from 
either laser. Attempts to assume so would lead to contradictions as in interpreting 
ordinary two-slit interference. We are accustomed to saying that the photon does 
not come through either slit, but it is not as easy to accept that it does not come 
from either laser. One difficulty is that there are more theories of the laser (than 
theories of slits) with energy levels as sources and photons as products.
All this is a direct consequence of the stimulated emission process. Consider 
the contrast with spontaneous emission. To do this suppose the lasers were 
emitting |«) states or mixtures of |n) states, such as the Gaussian. |n) states are 
the product of definite numbers of excited and unexcited atoms. To form these 
states we must in principle be able to tell which atom had decayed or at least in 
which laser the atom was in. This is only possible with spontaneous emission. But 
\n) states do not interfere and so spontaneous emission (at low (n)) is not 
compatible with the interference we find.
With stimulated emission we get interference and we cannot tell which laser 
the photon came from. In this case it hardly makes sense to talk of photons being 
emitted.
4.4. Stimulation (of Induced Emission): The Blake-Scarl Experiment
Stimulated emission is in any case an odd process. What are we to make of the 
interaction between the stimulating photon and the rest of the system, including 
the stimulated photon? There is, unlike most interactions, no exchange of energy 
and momentum. We are accustomed to observing particle properties of light when 
energy-transferring interactions take place between light and matter. On the other 
hand, if the “interaction” between the stimulating and the stimulated light is 
considered, we should expect to see interference—and wave behavior.
The Blake-Scarl experiment
*
18) presents similar problems for the photon 
theory of stimulated emission as the Pfleegor-Mandel experiment just discussed. 
The difference is a focus on the stimulation as opposed the emission process.
A beam of light from a single-mode laser passes through an amplifier tube in 
which stimulated emission increases the intensity of the laser beam. Blake and 
Scarl looked for time correlations between pairs of successively detected photons 

Duality of Fluctuations, Fields, and More
83
in the output light. The expectation was for correlations in the arrival times for the 
stimulating and stimulated photons. No change of correlation was found as the 
ratio of amplified to chaotic light was raised from 0 to 2, raising questions about 
the photon nature of stimulated emission.
We have proposed the following model of stimulated emission in order to 
explain the Blake-Scarl experiment. Let us suppose the stimulating photon and 
the stimulated photon interact—interfere—and form the second-order coherent 
state \II) described in Section 2. We expect this state because of the phase 
coherence associated with stimulated emission. The phase dependence of \II) is 
expressed explicitly in Eq. (36). Moreover, the correlation properties of laser 
light are given by a series of correlation functions beginning with Eq. (12) which is 
the defining relation for second-order coherent states. Let us see how the properties 
of this state can be used to explain the results of Blake and Scarl.
We have discussed the interpretation of the coefficients of the second-order 
coherent state in terms of the probabilities for spontaneous and stimulated 
emission/19)
Defining the ratio of amplified to chaotic light as
We have from the variation of the average occupation number in the second-order 
coherent state Eq. (18)
0 < ^ < 2 
(49)
7C
as in the Blake-Scarl experiment.
Now our point is that throughout this variation the correlation properties of 
this state remain constant. The correlation is independent of the ratio IL/IC as 
observed by Blake and Scarl.
Of course, states involving |3) and higher-order Fock states might be pro­
duced by the LGT. But these states, because of their phase coherence, would be 
higher-order coherent states. They would therefore automatically satisfy the 
second-order conditions tested by Blake and Scarl. For example, a possible third- 
order coherent state is
|Z//)e.g = VS|0) + Vi|l) + V||3> 
(50)
This state is also coherent to second order. The point is that Blake and Scarl 
detected only second-order coherence properties, correlations between pairs of 
photons.
According to the criteria of Section 4.2, these observations are consistent 

84
Peter E. Gordon
with wave behavior. From this point of view, stimulated emission is an inter­
action of light and light, characterized by the wave behavior of the state \ll) formed 
by the stimulating and the stimulated photon.
4.5. Stimulation (of Spontaneous Emission)
It has long been an idea that spontaneous emission is induced by the vacuum 
fluctuations. Comparison of the Einstein radiation coefficients with the zero-point 
energy permits us to at least formally make the connection. More recently, lifetime 
changes for excited atoms in front of mirrors have been explained in terms of 
reflections of the vacuum fluctuation.
We would like to show a relation between the vacuum fluctuations and 
spontaneous emission in terms of the present methods.
First we point out several consistencies of this relation.
1. The emitting atom recoils in a random direction when emitting sponta­
neous radiation. Any stimulating field responsible for this would have to 
have a random direction.
2. Absence of coherence in the spontaneous radiation is consistent with an 
unphased character of the stimulating field.
The point is that, supposing spontaneous emission is being stimulated, the 
vacuum fluctuations satisfy both requirements of the stimulating field.
Now we would like to relate spontaneous emission and the vacuum fluctua­
tions by comparing the classical limits in the number and coherent state represen­
tations.
In the number representation the probability for emission is calculated by 
standard Q.E.D. to be proportional to [(n) -I- 1].
When (ri) = 0 (no photons present) there still remains a probability for 
emission and this is spontaneous emission.
The semiclassical theory, on the other hand, gives a probability for emission 
proportional to (ri). The classical limit, in which the semiclassical result is valid, is
(n) » 1
and is equivalent to ignoring the spontaneous emission term in the quantum 
mechanical probability. From this point of view, spontaneous emission is a 
quantum effect—it disappears in the classical limit. This conclusion is not shared 
by all physicists.(20)
Now let us turn to the vacuum fluctuations. The coherent state is described in 
the P-representation as a delta-function:
P(a) = 8(2)(a — a0)
(51)

Duality of Fluctuations, Fields, and More
85
We have encountered this state in its density matrix description:
<a|p|a>ao = exp -|a - a0|2 
(52)
We will argue that Eq. (51) is the classical limit of Eq. (52). This property 
of the density matrix is closely related to the weak correspondence principle/21) 
According to the latter, a classical generator equals the diagonal coherent state 
matrix elements of the associated quantum generator.
The advantage of the density matrix over the generator for our purposes is that 
the former becomes the classical distribution only in the classical limit. The 
density matrix formalism allows us to examine the approach to the classical limit.
In what sense does Eq. (52) approach Eq. (51) in the classical limit? If we 
take this limit as
l«ol » 1
Eq. (52) approaches Eq. (51) in that it goes to zero for values of a differing from 
a0 by magnitudes slight compared to the magnitude of a0 itself.
The classical limit is thus equivalent to ignoring the fluctuations around a0. 
But these fluctuations around ot0 are just the vacuum fluctuations as we have seen 
[they remain in Eq. (52) when a0 = 0].
Comparing the physical interpretation of these two classical limits
1. In the number representation spontaneous emission vanishes in the limit 
<n) » 1
2. In the coherent state representation the vacuum fluctuations vanish in the 
limit
l“ol >> 1
We see that the vacuum fluctuations act analogously to spontaneous emission. 
They are corresponding quantum effects or terms. If we wish the classical limit 
to be invariant to representation, vacuum fluctuations must play the same role as 
spontaneous emission. Spontaneous emission and the vacuum fluctuations are part 
of a larger group of associated quantum effects including the particle term in the 
wave-particle separation of the fluctuations we started with. The relation between 
the particle term and the ground state fluctuations was first pointed out by Born, 
Heisenberg, and Jordan/22)
4.6. A Hypothesis
Now we are ready to offer a hypothesis. If we accept
1. The particle nature of the vacuum fluctuations (Section 3.3)

86
Peter E. Gordon
2. The role of the vacuum fluctuation in spontaneous emission (Section 4.5)
3. That spontaneous emission results in particles (Section 4.2)
then we can say the following: In spontaneous emission, particles stimulate the 
emission of particles.
In Sections 4.3 and 4.4 we argued that stimulated emission both was 
stimulated by and resulted in waves. In stimulated emission, waves stimulate the 
emission of waves.
The stimulating light passes on to the stimulated light not only its direction 
of motion and its phase (both random in the case of spontaneous emission) but also 
its wave or particle nature.
5. THE UNOBSERVABLE WAVE
5.7. Empty Waves and Duality
Recently a number of experiments have been proposed or performed with the 
object of showing the existence or nonexistence of the empty wave. In these 
experiments an attempt is made to detect the wave in a region where no photons are 
present. The empty wave is so called because if we agree that all of the energy and 
momentum is carried by the particle, then no energy or momentum is left over 
for the wave.
In support of the emptiness of the wave we should note that if detectors with 
threshold energies as low as 1/100 of the photon energy are placed in both arms of a 
split-beam experiment, light is still detected at only one detector. In this way upper 
limits can be established on the energy content of the wave.
Our principal point to start with is that attempting to detect the empty wave is 
equivalent to detecting the existence of duality. The empty wave is the same wave 
whose existence we accept when photons are present. In cases where photons are 
rarely present, such as the Pfleegor-Mandel experiment discussed in the last 
section, we have no trouble explaining the resulting interference as a consequence 
of the wave. Continuity requires that when we have no photons present, we do not 
invoke a different wave.
In any case, whether or not the wave is empty, we are accustomed to detecting 
photons. This is because the detection process, being an interaction of light and 
matter, necessarily involves light particles.
Detection of the empty wave, on the other hand, because there are no 
photons, would have to involve the light wave. So a direct detection of the wave 
would not necessarily involve the interaction of light and matter. This is just 
as well because the detection process could not involve the exchange of energy or 
momentum since the empty wave does not have any. All of this reminds us of 
stimulated emission, which as we have seen does not involve any such exchange 

Duality of Fluctuations, Fields, and More
87
between the stimulating agent and the emitted light. Stimulation emission has 
therefore been proposed as a candidate for the detection process.
We have just discussed stimulated emission as a process involving an 
interaction between light and light. We proposed that a second-order coherent state 
is formed.
In this section we will try to show that the correlation properties of this state 
always prevent the observation of the wave. Assuming the existence of the empty 
wave, we will show that it is undetectable. That the wave, in itself, should possess 
properties rendering it unobservable is not entirely new in physics. We have only 
to think of virtual particles. But just as the uncertainty principle prevents 
observations violating quantum theory, so (as we will see in Section 6.1) the 
unobservability of the wave prevents violations of locality from being observable. 
Moreover, as we will see in Section 6.2 the same property that protects locality 
guarantees the Hermitian nature of observables.
We have recently(23) pointed out difficulties in the detection of the empty 
wave in various experiments designed to prove or disprove its existence. The 
reason for this lies in the coherence properties of the two-photon states such as \II) 
formed by stimulated emission.
The time correlation experiments (so-called type-1 experiments) which have 
been proposed to detect the wave do not require phase coherence. Nevertheless, 
the phase coherence of \II) effects its correlation properties.
5.2. Blake-Scarl
In the Blake-Scarl experiment discussed in Section 4.4, correlations were 
expected between the arrival times of the stimulating and stimulated photons. No 
such correlations were found.
Selleri(24) has explained this result in terms of the empty wave. Suppose each 
primary photon from the first laser is accompanied by an extended empty wave. 
If the stimulated emission is due to the action of the wave, no time correlation 
would be expected between the detection of the stimulating photon and the 
stimulated photon, as found by Blake and Scarl.
In the photon model of stimulated emission, we would certainly expect 
increasing correlation in the arrival times of pairs of photons as the gain and the 
amount of stimulated emission increased. All that is necessary for this conclusion 
is to assume that the primary photon is in the vicinity of the excited atom, 
practically a statement of the photon model of stimulated emission. It would seem 
that the observed absence of increased coincidences is evidence against the photon 
model and in favor of the empty wave as stimulating agent.
But, as we have pointed out, if the state \II) is formed in stimulated emission 
out of the primary photon and the stimulated photon, we will be unable to observe 
correlations (beyond accidental correlations). This will be true whatever the nature 
of the stimulating light whether due to the primary photon or to an extended empty

wave. The coefficients [Eqs. 15-17)] of the state \ll) ensure that we would ob­
tain Poisson statistics in any experiment up to the second order, i.e., involving 
up to two photons. Selleri’s model of the amplification of light from the wave point 
of view produces the same Poisson distribution.
The Blake-Scarl experiment does not provide evidence either for or against 
the existence of the empty wave.
5.3. Selleri and Others
Another experiment or basic type of experiment has been proposed by 
Seller^25) and since elaborated on by many authors. Stimulated emission also 
plays a role in this experiment but now the stimulating photon and the empty wave 
associated with it takes different paths after encountering a beam splitter (BS; 
see Fig. 1). The empty wave is to be detected as the stimulating agent for emissions 
from the laser gain tube (LGT). This would show up as correlations between 
detectors Pj and P2.
Now let us accept the premise that the empty wave exists and is responsible 
for stimulating the emissions from the LGT. But suppose the photon to be detected 
at Pj (the initial photon which has been reflected at BS) and the photon generated 
in the LGT by the empty wave associated with the initial photon form the state \II). 
Now the expected PjP2 coincidences will not occur. Again this is because \II) 
contains no correlations beyond the accidental or Poisson.
Our expectation that the photons in the separate beams form the state \II) is 
based on the arguments given in Sections 4.4 and 5.2. Such a spatially extended 
state is familiar to us from EPR.
5.4. Muckenheim et al.
Miickenheim, Lokai, and Burghardt(26> have recently performed an experiment 
which they claim shows that empty waves do not induce stimulated emission in 
laser media. In a dispersive medium the phase velocity exceeds the group velocity,
FIGURE 1.

Duality of Fluctuations, Fields, and More
89
cg
(53)
(54)
where Cp is the phase velocity of waves, Cg is the group velocity of the photons, 
n(X) is the index of refraction, and dn/dX is negative in media with normal 
dispersion.
Because of this, Muckenheim et al. claim that an empty light wave arrives 
earlier than the photons. Failure to detect earlier stimulated emission, which would 
have been induced by the wave, is the basis for their claim.
While it is true that the phase velocity exceeds the group velocity, the phase 
velocity does not apply to the arrival of the wave. This is true even for a 
monochromatic wave as long as the wave is not present at a given point until a 
particular time. In fact, only an infinitely long wave can be thought of as truly 
monochromatic. Of course, such as infinite wave does not “arrive” and so cannot 
be used in the present experimental context. Putting it another way, any gradient 
in the square of the waves moves with the group velocity. Thus, the region which 
changes from no wave to wave moves with the group velocity. So the wave arrives 
at the same time as the photons.
It seems that this experiment cannot be used to prove or disprove the 
existence of empty waves; that is, the experiment cannot be used to detect the 
wave.
5.5. Martinolli-Gozzini
Martinolli and Gozzini<27> tested the nature of the two-photon state by allow­
ing it to fall on a semitransmitting mirror. They measured the statistics of the 
reflection process.
There are three possible results: both photons are transmitted, both photons 
are reflected, or one photon is transmitted and the other is reflected. An extensive 
analysis of the experiment by Heidmann and Reynaud(28) leads to probabilities 
of |, |, and | for the cases above. These probabilities generally hold for the case 
of distinguishable particles.
Martinolli and Gozzini on the other hand obtained results compatible with 
probabilities of J, J, and J. These probabilities hold for identical photons.
Heidmann and Reynaud reach their results even though they consider the 
photons as indistinguishable bosons. This is accomplished through symmetriza­
tion between the reflected and transmitted modes. Their precollision wave packet

(56)
(where T and R stand for transmitted and reflected modes) are the symmetrized 
representation of identical bosons.
The problem is that the states shown in Eqs. (55) and (56) are very different 
from \II). \II) is nonseparable (EPR-like),
|zz> * |1,2> 
(57)
The origin of this difference is that the photons in |II ) are, in fact, not 
bosons/29’30) This also explains the peculiar properties of the squeezed states 
discussed in Section 2.2.
A fuller exposition of this experiment will be presented elsewhere.
5.6. Conclusion
By analyzing these and other experiments we conclude that the wave is 
unobservable. The reasons for this unobservability vary with each experiment. 
These difficulties in observation might be part of a pattern, like the difficulties 
observing violations of the uncertainty principle or of conservation of energy. 
That is, the wave may be unobservable in principle.
The principle, which as we will see is duality itself, manifests itself on the 
physical level in different ways, depending on the experimental situation. In this 
regard it is similar to other principles.
In looking into the nature of this principle we will be attempting to give a 
reason for the unobservability of the wave. To do this we will have to question 
the idea of objectively coexisting particles and waves, an idea to be found in 
writings from de Broglie to Selleri. If the wave and the particle do not coexist we 
will have to find different times or physical situations during which they exist 
separately. The only natural division in time in quantum mechanics is between 
before and after measurement.
The relation between measurement and duality occupies us in one way or 
another in the last section of this chapter.
6. 
DISCUSSION: MEASUREMENT AND DUALITY
6.1. Locality
We have attempted to show that the wave is unobservable. Our inability to 
directly observe the wave (as we can the particle) may in fact be a necessary 

Duality of Fluctuations, Fields, and More
91
limitation. We now wish to show that this unobservability of the wave produces 
observed locality, i.e., locality on the observed level.
This is particularly brought out by EPR. In EPR the inability to observe i|i, 
which is the probability amplitude, prevents nonlocality from being observable.
Consider an EPR experiment with two observers. When the second observer 
performs a measurement on the photon that arrives at his location, he does in fact 
obtain some information about the photon before measurement. He can, in the 
usual versions of the experiment, eliminate the possibility that before his measure­
ment the photon had a particular polarization.
He could not do this before his measurement. But although some information 
about the photon survives the measurement, precisely that information which 
would violate locality is “filtered out” by the measurement.
Suppose the first observer is choosing between two measurement apparatuses 
U and V and basic sets |u) and |v) corresponding to a choice between plane 
or circularly polarizing filters. This choice is the message to be sent to the second 
observer.
Once this choice is made, and the first measurement is carried out, the photon 
arriving at the second observer is in an eigenstate of u or v. This is a consequence 
of conservation principles, to which we will return. This “element of reality” 
contains nonlocal information which will not be present after measurement.
Assume that the basic sets |w) and |v) are related by a unitary transformation:
|w)v= Sauv|v) 
(58)
The measurement our second observer makes eliminates the possibility that the 
photon was in the eigenstate or orthogonal to the one obtained as a result of the 
measurement. However, the various probabilities that the photon was in one of the 
eigenstates of the other basis always add up to an equal probability since
X a+auv = 1 
(59)
v or u
by unitarity. This “protection” of locality by the unitary transformation may be 
seen as a case of quantum mechanics saving relativity. We may consider this as the 
inverse of the famous Bohr-Einstein clock-in-the-box weighing experiment, 
where relativity was brought to the aid of quantum mechanics.
We should not be surprised if detecting the wave in space and time (where 
else?) should prove difficult.
Such a wave could not be superimposed over events, as the empty wave is 
often called on to do. We will have to find another place for the wave, other than 
where events take place.
Locality we conclude is a property confined to the observed level. It is 
present after, and a result of, measurement.

6.2. Unitarity
A central problem of quantum theory is to state the conditions under which a 
measurement is carried out. A few physicists have argued the necessity of 
involving the observer, as a conscious being. The majority of physicists have, 
however, rejected this approach as leading to a subjective interpretation of 
quantum mechanics. The alternative is to place measurement in an “irreversible 
act of amplification. ”
Aside from the fact that no program based on irreversibility has been 
convincing, the same difficulties stand in the way of such an approach. The Bohr­
Wheeler approach to measurement (no elementary phenomenon is a phenomenon 
until it is an observed phenomenon) has been criticized as being ultimately 
referenced to subjective criteria such as observation and meaning/31)
Such a fundamental irreversibility would involve a nonunitary transforma­
tion. The projection postulate itself selects one of the terms on the right of
S CK|i|/K)| Ao) —> 2 CK|i|>K)|Ak)
(60)
and should not be considered reversible.
(|A0) is the original position of the apparatus. The | AK) are the final states of 
the apparatus which are correlated to |i|jk) the eigenstates of an observable Q.)
We have just discussed the role of unitarity in preserving locality of the 
observed level. What is not always noted is that the unitary nature of measurement 
is also necessary to the Hermitian nature of observables. This was first pointed out 
by Wigner/32)
Now we assume that the initial state of our “object” is |i|jk) an eigenstate 
of Q. The measurement of this state (the interaction between the apparatus and 
object) carries out the transformation:
I^K^K
(61)
Note that by carrying out our measurement on |i|/K), an “element of reality,” 
we avoid all problems associated with the projection postulate.
If we measure a different eigenfunction, we obtain
lM*i>lAo> 
IU»i>lAi>
(62)
The right sides of Eqs. (61) and (62) must be orthogonal because of the 
distinguishability of the pointer readings. If the transition represented by the 
arrows in Eqs. (61) and (62) is unitary, the left sides are also orthogonal, and 
therefore also the |i|jk), the eigenfunctions.
But if the measurement process is nonunitary, if in Wheeler’s words it is 
“brought to a close by an irreversible act of amplification,” then we can no longer 
assume orthogonal eigenfunctions.

The coherent states themselves are nonorthogonal. They are often called 
classical states. Interestingly, they have been suggested as a substitute for the 
“observer” in Bohr’s formulation of quantum theory/33)
The nonunitary transformation leads to nonphysical observables. Suppose the 
distinguishable eigenvalues of our observable Q are given by
Ql'l'i) = qilM
*i>
Q|4»j> = q>j> 
(63)
It makes no difference whether the qi are real, as long as they are unequal. We then 
have
<Q^il’l»j> = q/'l'ikj) 
(64)
and
<Q'ViIU>j> * <'l'ilQ'l’j> 
or
(^ilQ^j) * <M>ilQM>j> 
(65)
this following from the nonorthogonality of the eigenfunctions in Eqs. (64) 
and (65).
Note that we are only trying to show the consequences of avoiding the 
subjective aspects of measurement by making irreversibility a physical pro­
perty. If we were forced to offer an example of a nonphysical observable we might 
choose a mental image or a perception. It is certainly observable and not obviously 
physical. It is the result of an irreversible “process” (consciousness) and not least 
in importance (according to the relation of unitary measurement to locality we 
discussed in Section 6.1), not located in space.
6.3. Duality and Reality
6.3.1. Failure of Local Realistic Theories. We see that unitarity leads on the one 
hand to an observable locality and on the other to physical observables. This 
assures that whatever we can detect will be real, i.e., local and objective. But 
we are left with a question: If ordinary, unitary measurement gives us local, real 
observables, why all this trouble with local realistic theories! The problem is that 
when we talk about a realistic theory we ask about the reality and locality of things 
before measurement. This is the EPR or element-of-reality approach, the criterion 

94
Peter E. Gordon
of which is prediction before measurement. This is the realistic interpretation 
associated with Einstein. On the other hand, we have seen here that the familiar 
realistic properties apply only after measurement.
It is well known that we do not observe i|/. We have spent some time pointing 
out that we do not observe the wave in general. We infer the existence of the wave 
from the evidence of observations on particles. In the case of light we readily 
accept the existence of the wave. In the case of matter we are more hesitant. The 
difference lies in the fact that classical light is a wave.
This inability to directly observe the wave is due to the measurement process 
of quantum mechanics. Measurement brings into quantum theory the same 
dualism we are exploring. Here it is between the Schrodinger equation and the 
measurement (projection) process, between i|> and the observed values.
We can display this generalized duality as follows:
Postmeasurement
Observable
Particle
Observables (real)
Locality
Separability
Premeasurement
Unobservable 
Wave 
(Nonreal) 
Nonlocality 
Nonseparability
Other familiar properties could be added to this list. We could show that 
invariance holds only after measurement. By this we mean that the measured 
values are the same for all observers, while the objects before measurement, which 
may include elements of reality, are not invariant.
Temporal dualities such as “becoming versus being” as well as others can be 
brought into this relation.
The line here represents measurement. Duality offers a concept of measure­
ment—or at least a way of singling it out: crossing the line.
But why duality rather than just a measurement upon the wave? One reason 
is that the wave is not in space. Another is, as we suggest above, that the duality 
is more general than wave versus particle.
There is no absolute place for the line. In Bohr’s terms we would say that the 
measuring instruments define the line.
Our sense of the complementarity of physical properties is that they apply 
before and after measurement, respectively. In EPR (as we have seen) the 
(nonlocal) properties of the photon’s polarization before measurement are deter­
mined by conservation principles. After measurement, only local information 
survives.
The EPR problem itself can be approached from the point of view of duality. 
One need suppose that the basis of measure on the right side, which is not spatial, 
is instead dependent on phase. The EPR photons would then be at the same 

Duality of Fluctuations, Fields, and More
95
“place” on the premeasurement side and so be capable of instantaneous communi­
cation.
Unobservability of the wave follows from the fact that it does not lie on the 
left, postmeasurement, observable side of the line. It does not coexist with the 
particle. The wave is always inferred from measurements on the particles by 
retrodicting from the time of measurement back across the line to the time before 
measurement.
“Realism” calls for the existence of this premeasurement, right side of the 
duality and so brings in nonlocality. Hence the failure of local realistic theories.
We can produce such a theory only by ignoring the right side. In Bohr’s 
words, “concepts of space and time by their very nature acquire a meaning only 
because of the possibility of neglecting their interaction with the means of 
measurement.” A Copenhagen interpretation means dealing only with the obser­
vations, with the left side.
6.3.2. A Historical Aside.(34) Our apparent local realism is facilitated by the 
unobservability of the wave, just as the existence of a previous reality, the celestial 
sphere, was facilitated by the inability to observe parallax.
The Ptolemaic reality was also dualistic, consisting of Earth on the one hand, 
and the celestial mechanisms, in their evolving historical forms, on the other. It 
can be argued that all widely accepted worldviews have been dualistic.
Similarly, unobservable entities are not new to physics. Virtual particles are 
unobservable but are inferred because they give rise to forces between real 
particles. In the same way unobservable waves give rise to interferences.
In the older, geocentric physics the region beyond the celestial sphere was 
unobservable. In more recent physics we have the example of cosmic censorship 
hypothesis wherein singularities are shielded from observation.
The prejudice among scientists against unobservables is due to the long 
history of religion, which contained the great Unobservable. Observability has 
consequently come to grant a special status, equivalent to being part of physical 
reality, both within and without physics itself. We have instead argued that 
observability is a particular state of affairs, one due in fact to the unobservability 
of the wave.
6.3.3. Conclusion. If we could observe the wave, with all its nonlocal effects, 
our conception of reality would have to change. We would have to accept either
1. That space-time is an illusion (not real), or
2. That space-time is not everything (i.e., that there is also a non- 
spatiotemporal reality)
Thus, duality is more than a question of whether the wave exists; it is a 
question about the nature of reality. Duality is a worldview with its place alongside 

96
Peter E. Gordon
the conventional worldview of reality. Locality only contradicts reality. It does not 
contradict duality. Duality by its very nature includes reality.

CHAPTER 5
Dualism within Dualism
Open Questions
Philippe Gueret
The general point of view of wave-particle duality proposed by Albert Einstein 
and Louis de Broglie represents all atomic objects such as photons, electrons, 
protons, etc. as consisting of the physical association of two entities: (1) a wave­
packet, devoid of energy and momentum but nevertheless objectively real and 
propagating in space and time; (2) energetic corpuscles always localized inside 
the wave-packets.
Moreover, within this wave-particle duality exists another which appeared 
early in classical physics for the explanation of diffraction phenomena by means 
of the Huygens-Fresnel principle. This “dualism within dualism” retains all of its 
interest in the modern theory of light and serves as a basis to interpret the wave­
mechanics in terms of the “double solution” hypothesis.
Our purpose is to expose this problem and draw from it some experimental 
and mathematical inferences coming into sight of open questions for all that.
Let us consider a pointlike source S of a wave phenomenon in a homogeneous 
isotropic medium and let 2 be a spherical wave-surface at a given time t (Figure 1). 
According to the Huygens hypothesis, each point M of 2 is regarded as the source 
of a secondary spherical wavelet the radius of which is V Ar at a forthcoming 
instant t + Ar, V being the wave propagation velocity (phase velocity). At the same 
time r + Ar, the wavefront becomes 2' with radius V(t + Ar) and behaves as the 
envelope of all the wavelets emitted by the elements of 2. Therefore, Huygens 
evidenced a progressive propagation mechanism of the wave phenomenon from a 
point M of space to another.
The Huygens construction has been completed by the Fresnel hypothesis of

point M of X emits at its turn a spherical wavelet.
possible interferences between the wavelets themselves. Then, it is natural to 
admit that the secondary sources distributed on the X surface could have the same 
phase as the oscillating state of the wave front X. A more detailed investigation 
of this situation shows that actually the wavelets have a phase advance of ir/2 
before the X oscillations.
The Huygens-Fresnel principle does not only give a wave front propagating 
forward, but also a wave front X" propagating in the opposite direction and 
which is another envelope of the wavelets (Figure 2). A mathematical analysis of 
this fact enables us to justify the Huygens-Fresnel principle and to eliminate the 
undesirable X" wave inconsistent with empirical evidence. This was performed by 
Kirchhoff for scalar waves as acoustic waves in fluids. Kirchhoff built up an 
accurate formula including two terms adding or canceling each other according to 
whether one considers a point of X' or a point of X". The electromagnetic wave 
problem is more intricate because of the vectorial nature of the field. The expres­
sion of the Huygens-Fresnel principle requires three assumptions:
1. In a point M of space, the field must be the sum of all the fields sent by the 
elements of the wave front X. This holds also for the first derivatives of the 
fields.
2. The integral expression of the field, taken on X, must be equal to zero in 
each point located inside the spherical surface X (no back-waves).
3. The secondary wavelets are real electromagnetic waves.

99
FIGURE 2. The wavelets have two envelopes: S', which propagates forward, and X", propagating 
backward.
On this basis, one can deduce different formulas, equivalent to one another, 
but adjusted to the applications: in optics or for the transmission techniques of 
short waves, for instance.
The emission mechanism of light vibrations is not yet fully understood. 
However, it is known from the pioneer works of Einstein and Bohr that the energy 
exchanges between matter and electromagnetic radiation are carried out by quanta 
with energy hv. Particularly, when one atom emits one photon with energy hv, an 
electron of this atom passes from an energetic level E2 to another of lesser energy 
Ev the height difference of these levels being precisely equal to hv = E2 - Ev 
Then, in optics, it is reasonable to think that
1. The electromagnetic radiation is not emitted continuously but by limited 
wave-trains (or wave-packets) containing photons and coming from the 
different atoms from which the course is composed.
2. The energy density of these waves inside a small volume measures the 
probability of finding photons in this space region.
3. Electromagnetic waves surrounding photons emitted by different atoms 
can very likely interfere as shown by the Brown-Twiss or the Pfleegor- 
Mandel experiments.
Thus, the following representation occurs: the light source S being made of a 
very great number of atoms, the electromagnetic wave emitted at a given instant 
t, is the sum of individual wave-packets due to the different atoms. These emit only

for a time t corresponding to the mean life of their excited levels. After a fairly 
long time, the wave-packets emitted at the instant t will be kept away and new 
atoms take the relay by emitting new waves with new amplitudes and phases: there 
is a loss of coherence between successive emissions of radiation. A source is 
coherent with itself only providing that we compare waves emitted at very near 
instants, the time interval being clearly below t.
The successive atomic emissions of the source S are made of wave trains 
limited in the propagation direction. The phase velocity V of the waves inside the 
wave train is related to the wavelength X and the frequency v by V = Xv and the 
wave-train velocity v itself (the group velocity) is given by the Rayleigh formula
1/v = d(l/X)/dv = d(v/V)dv 
(1)
The wave-train length L — vt (coherence length) is a measurable size by well- 
known methods of the interference techniques: for instance, by disappearing of the 
interferences by interposing transparent plates or by separating sufficiently the 
mirrors of a Michelson interferometer.
We can define t as the “coherence time” of a wave train by remarking that 
at a given point M, it behaves as a monochromatic plane wave of the same length 
L as the wave train. Such an approximation meets its justification by applications 
which can be made to the calculations of interferences and diffraction phenomena.
We have experimental numerical data on the coherence length (and conse­
quently on the coherence time t) of the light wave-packets: for ordinary visible 
light of mean wavelength X = 0.5 jim, L is equal to about 1 m which corresponds 
to a coherence duration t of about 10~8 s. Moreover, the time constant t is 
connected to the spectral ray width of the light: one can easily devise that a long 
wave train is sufficiently near that of a sinusoidal wave to have a well-defined 
frequency whereas a short wave train admits a more spread spectrum.
These considerations about the structure of light emissions bring up more 
physical consistence to the Huygens-Fresnel principle. Thus, the wave-surface X 
corresponds to the geometrical distribution of the wave trains in space surrounding 
the source S. The wave-packets take the place of the Huygens wavelets. For a 
source of ordinary intensity, the great number of atomic emissions gives to the 
wave front an apparent “materiality” in the sense that the X wave can be regarded 
itself as responsible for the interference phenomena. On the contrary, for a source 
of very low intensity, emitting photons one by one, for instance, X is reduced to its 
statistical signification of geometrical function of repartition of wave-packets 
around the source and can be useful for calculations of probabilities.
Let us recall that Einstein propounded such a model for atomic emissions of 
radiation under the name of Nadelstrahlung. In the case of light, this model 
exhibits a wave-wave dualism with the wave-particle dualism.
The idea of a wave associated with a particle of matter occurred first to de 
Broglie^ and was embodied in his well-known doctoral thesis of 1924.His 

Dualism within Dualism
101
assumptions were that the particle has an internal vibration (the “de Broglie 
clock”) and moves in the space-time of special relativity, where at every moment 
it is localized.
A free particle at rest has mass mQ and energy E = mOc2. If this energy is 
taken to equal one quantum hvQ, the internal particle vibration frequency is defined 
by v0 = mQc2/h and a wave function can be associated with the vibration so that
'Pq = a exp 
(2)
t being the proper time of the particle. 'Pq is uniform throughout space and does 
not serve in any way to locate the particle.
Now, if it is supposed that the same particle is moving freely with uniform 
velocity v in the +x direction, a Lorentz transform gives
T = (t - PX/C)V(1 - p2) 
(3)
(P = vic) and, for an observer at rest, the wave function becomes
^(x,r) = aexp{[2Tn’v0(Z - px/c)]V(l—P2)} 
(4)
or, on taking Vq/V(1 — p2) = v and c2/v = V
^(x,0 = aexp[2iriv(r — x/V)] 
(5)
Note that, under the Lorentz transformation, the wave frequency becomes v = 
V(/y/(l — P2), while the particle frequency becomes v = v0V(l - p2) according 
to the clock slowdown formula. In order to remove this contradiction, de Broglie 
lays down his “phase concordance principle”: the internal particle vibration 
and its associated wave remain in phase where the particle is located, de Broglie 
waves consequently act as a guide for the particle motion.
According to Eq. (5), for an observer at rest, the particle motion is associated 
with the propagation of a plane wave of frequency v and phase velocity V > c. On 
defining, as usual, the wavelength by X = V7v, one gets for this phase wave
X = c2h!Ev = hip 
(6)
E and p = |p| respectively representing the energy and relativistic momentum 
of the moving particle.
On the basis of classical reasoning in wave theory, one can consider a wave­
packet made up of a superposition of plane wave with closely related frequencies. 
Using k = v/V, such a packet can be written as
0(x,O = J^{aexp [2iri(W - kx)]}dk

In both cases the identification of the group velocity U of a wave-packet with

between the relativistic de Broglie waves (phase velocity V = c2/v, frequency

103
v = E/h) and the nonrelativistic Schrodinger waves (phase velocity V = v/2, 
frequency v — mv2/2h). Moreover, the Schrodinger waves which are statistical 
featured waves without local concentration of energy (as the Born waves) cannot 
be likened to real physical waves. For this reason, de Broglie(3) expressed his 
“double solution hypothesis”: to each solution 'P = aexp(iS) of the propagation 
equation, there must correspond a solution Uo = f exp (iS) with the same phase S, 
but one whose amplitude/exhibits a singularity moving with the particle velocity. 
The UQ corresponds to an extended wave phenomenon centered on a very small 
region standing, strictly speaking, for the particle. The Uo wave would be the 
solution of a yet unknown nonlinear equation and the 'P wave the solution of its 
linear approximation, at least outside the singularity.
If we take ¥ = a exp(iS), the linear Klein-Gordon equation
□'P - (m2c2/ft2)^ = 0 
(15)
splits into
(C): V(a2V5) = 0 
(15)
(J): (VS)2 + m2c2 = hua/a 
(16)
(C) is a continuity equation and (J) a Jacobi equation.
In the right-hand side of Eq. (16,J) one recognizes the relativistic generation 
of the quantum potential introduced by de Broglie, which expresses the reaction of 
the wave deformed in the presence of obstacles to its propagation. In particular, the 
explicit calculation of this quantum potential in the two slit situation^4) shows how 
to obtain interference without the need to abandon the notion of well-defined 
trajectories.
Now, let us consider a wave-packet of arbitrary shape surrounding the 
particle and defined by
u(x,t) = R(&k) exp (iS) 
(17)
with A£ = mc/h, = x — vt9 S = (mc2/h)t ~ (mv/h)x, m = ^^/(l — £2). 
This wave-packet is the solution of a nonlinear two-dimensional Klein-Gordon 
equation
with □ = 
= d2/dx2 - d2/c2dt2, x2 = m0c2/h2, Vp = (ww)1/2 = |u|. This
equation is the relativistic extension of the nonlinear Hasse equation^5) (a Schro­
dinger equation with a nonlinear term of “quantum potential” type) and describes 
propagation of kinks and solitons of arbitrary shape in the two-dimensional space­
time.

Equation (18) stems from the Lagrangian

From this Lagrangian can be derived the same current as in the linear case, that is a

In four-dimensional space-time, instead of (17), the nondispersive wave­
packet associated with a particle of rest mass mQ and traveling in the +x direction 
are defined by
u(r,0 = /?(r)exp(iS) 
(22)
with r = |r| = [(x - W)2/V(l - |32) + y2 + z2]1/2. They are solutions of
□m - %2u = (Rrr + 2Rr/r)exp(iS)

As Mackinnon has shown, the sine solutions express the relativistic covari­
ance of the phase concordance principle.(6) These solutions are also well known to 
represent the superposition of two spherically symmetrical waves, one converging 
and the other diverging/3) In electromagnetism, they behave as waves in a phase- 
locked cavity similar to those analyzed by Jennison<7> and have the inertial 
properties of classical particles.
The cosine solutions, unbounded at the center, can also be retained since, in a 
realistic scheme, particles are not pointlike and have a radius r0 very small but 
different from zero. These solutions can express the very high value of the 
amplitude near the particle.
The previous elementary calculations give a schematic model of U.Q waves 
consistent with experimental data on the interferences of particles. Furthermore, 
as in the optical case, the coherence length L of matter waves is a measurable 
quantity: the electron longitudinal coherence length L used in interference experi­
ments (Moellenstedt, Faget) is about 10-6 cm with a velocity on the order of 
109 cm/s; for neutrons, L varies between 10-5 and 10-3 with a velocity on the 
order of 105 cm/s. It is important to underline the fact that an interference pattern 
is not dependent on the observer may be explained by de Broglie waves, but not by 
Schrodinger ones/8) even in the nonrelativistic case.
Thus, a dualism between the wave and the UQ waves appears within the 
wave-particle dualism for matter, exactly in the same way for light and the 
Nadelstrahlung model occurs again.
A satisfactory manner to avoid this problem would be to ascribe all the 
physical properties to the wave-packets and the statistical ones only to the A 
wave, in the Born way. de Broglie discussed this important problem in a very 
interesting but practically unknown article published in the Cahiers de Physique. 
Analyzing the Einstein model, de Broglie did not retain the above proposition. 
Indeed, he reminded the reader that, about 1920, in order to put the Nadelstrahlung 
to the test, Schrodinger suggested the following experiment: “with the help of 
mirrors, to have a try at doing interfere the light beams emitted in nearly opposite 
directions” and de Broglie wrote: “The experiment was performed and has given a 
positive result. As the photons were emitted one after the other by the atoms of the 
source, this result seems to give an evidence, contrary to the Nadelstrahlung 
hypothesis, that just when the emission occurs, the wave going out the atom and 
carrying a photon is a classical spherical wave,”(9) i.e., a S wave.
This experiment seems to have made a great impression on de Broglie’s mind 
and led him to abandon Einstein’s idea. But nowadays, one knows that it is not 
simple to build a source emitting photons one after the other, so that the 
Schrodinger experiment needs confirmation. If new experiments would negate the 
results of the former and uphold the Nadelstrahlung, a space to new inquiries about 
individual atomic processes would be created. The wave functions Uo should 
describe a real phenomenon propagating in space-time as in the original de Broglie 
wave mechanics, the wave functions 'F, elements of an abstract functional space, 
retaining all their quantum mechanical assignments. This view implies that,

mathematically and experimentally, a few questions remaining open, as, for 
instance:
1. The transversal size of a wave-packet, i.e., the transversal coherence 
length.
2. The physical nature of the Uo waves (in other words, what is waving?). For 
light, it appears clearly that Maxwell electromagnetic waves are associ­
ated with photons, in the case of massive photons introduced by de 
Broglie/10) or for conventional zero-mass photons as shown, particularly, 
by the Majorana equation/11) But the problem remains unsolved for the 
other particles: for instance, are protons and neutrons associated with the 
same “nucleonic” wave? A solution of this question is very likely tied to a 
realistic reinterpretation of the quantum field theory.
3. The “empty wave-packet” problem, i.e., the examination of the proper­
ties of wave-packets deprived of their particles. Empty waves are neces­
sary to explain one particle interference with itself. The theoretical study 
of their possible intervention in the domain of neutronic interferometry^12) 
and their eventual ability to induce stimulated emissions of radiation^13) 
have already been examined. But other problems remain unsolved: for 
instance, are the empty waves absolutely devoid of energy? A negative 
answer should lead to a concrete description of how a photon grows old by 
repeated diffractions and, particularly, by taking in account this consid­
eration, it is possible to obtain an available alternative explanation of the 
redshift of astronomical objects/9) Another problem is: why an empty 
wave separated from an electrically charged particle, would remain 
sensitive to an electrostatic field?
4. The wave-wave dualism within the wave-particle dualism involves the 
existence of two kinds of quantum potential: one □ al a built from the wave 
function 'P = a exp(/S.) gives the trajectories of the wave-packet center/4) 
the other, built from the wave function Uo, is connected with the position 
fluctuations of the particle inside the wave-packet. This scheme is consis­
tent with stochastic theories, but without the need for a recourse to a 
hypothetical chaotic medium as the Dirac ether.
5. An important problem is the spin dependence of the Uo waves. From its 
solution depends, namely, space-time specification of the polarization 
measurements as it occurs peculiarly in the EPR experiments.

Recent Contributions of Electron 
Interferometry to Wave-Particle 
Duality
Franz Hasselbach
1. INTRODUCTION
Louis de Broglie’s wave-particle duality hypothesis, published in his famous 
papers in 1924, was verified for electrons only 3 years later by Davisson and 
Germed2) and Thomson/3) No interferometer was available at that time to measure 
the very short electron wavelengths predicted by the de Broglie relation. The idea 
underlying their experiment to prove the hypothesis was that if electrons are in 
some sense represented by waves, they should undergo diffraction from crystalline 
lattices in a way almost identical to X rays. Crystalline lattices of appropriate 
periodicity were at hand and therefore a diffraction experiment provided the first 
evidence of wave-particle duality.
By 1940 the electron microscope had developed to a point where it became 
possible to observe phenomena below 10 nm in scale and at the end of this dec­
ade an electron interferometer seemed to be within reach. Two schemes to produce 
two coherent electron waves and to recombine these waves were investigated: 
Amplitude division occurring upon crystalline diffraction by Marton(4) and wave­
front splitting by an electron optical biprism by Mollenstedt and Diiker/5’6) Both 
schemes work with electrons. However, biprisms proved to have the greater utility 
for electrons. That is why they are used exclusively in today’s electron interferome­
ters. The single-crystal interferometer got to the top two decades later in neutron 
interferometry/7) The most direct and spectacular experiments concerning wave-

particle duality were done with electron and neutron interferometers. However, 
there is of course—apart from these experiments—an overwhelming mass of 
evidence for de Broglie’s hypothesis.
Conventional electron interferometers were constructed by electron micros­
copists according to customary principles approved in electron microscopy. In 
fact, they were most of the time just suitably modified electron microscopes. Their 
sensitivity to alternating magnetic stray fields and mechanical vibrations is 
therefore similar or, in interferometers with wide separation of the coherent beams, 
even higher than that of electron microscopes with atomic resolution. Electron 
interferometers therefore had to be located in special laboratories far from electric 
cables, far from any traffic and often additionally mounted on vibration isolation 
systems. To put such an interferometer on a rotating table, e.g., in order to perform 
a Sagnac experiment with electron waves seemed to be unimaginable. A closer 
look at the problem fortunately revealed that the special constructional require­
ments necessary for a rugged interferometer were disregarded in conventional 
instruments. We therefore dropped traditional constructive principles and devel­
oped a totally new design J2 * * * * * 8 * * * *) The resulting instrument is many orders of magnitude 
more insensitive to the disturbances just mentioned. The Sagnac experiment, for 
which the insensitivity of the instrument to vibrations is crucial, could be per­
formed successfully as we will see later. While we focus here our interest on 
experiments done with this new interferometer, supplementary information may 
be found in review papers on conventional electron interferometry/9-12)
2. THE NOVEL ELECTRON-OPTICAL BIPRISM INTERFEROMETER
An electron optical biprism interferometer, in principle, consists of an elec­
tron source which is illuminating the biprism (Figure la). The biprism is composed
of a very fine metallized quartz filament (less than 1 pun in diameter) held at
positive potential between two grounded electrodes. The incoming wave front is
split into two partial waves when passing the biprism filament and—by the
positive charge—the two partial waves are deflected toward each other. In analogy
to the light optical biprism the electrons (partial waves) seem to emerge from the
two virtual sources (marked by crosses). Interference fringes are formed in the
region of superposition only if the spatial and the temporal coherence conditions
are met. Both conditions can be satisfied very easily when the electrons emerging
from the very fine virtual source of a field-emitter tip are used to illuminate the
biprism/13 * * *
) When a single positively charged biprism is used, the widest separa­
tion of the coherent partial waves is on the order of the diameter of the biprism
filament, i.e., a micrometer or less. A wider separation of the coherent electron
waves is mandatory in many experiments, e.g., when a very small coil or super­
conducting tube carrying magnetic flux has to be inserted between the coherent 
waves in order to measure the Aharonov-Bohm phase shift <14-17) or the flux 
quantization in superconductors/17’18) Likewise, an enclosed area between the

interferometer, (b) Schematical setup for achieving wide separation of the coherent electron waves by 
means of a dual biprism arrangement.
coherent beams which is as large as possible is needed for the Sagnac experiment. 
Wide separation of the coherent beams and in turn an enclosed area can easily be 
accomplished by multiple biprism arrangements as shown, e.g., for the case of two 
biprisms in Figure lb. Here the first biprism is charged negatively and bends the 
partial waves apart. A second, positively charged biprism recombines them. The 
separation of the wave fronts depends on the negative voltage of the first biprism 
filament and the distance of the two filaments. It reaches its maximum in the 
vicinity of the second biprism filament.
A conventional electron interferometer operated under such “wide separation 
conditions” has an enormously increased sensitivity to vibrations and—due to the 
phase shifting action of magnetic fluxes enclosed by the coherent beams—to ac 
magnetic stray fields. The mechanical resonance frequency of a conventional in­
strument is low and, since it departs only slightly from the frequencies of the 
vibrations coming along the floor of the building it is excited easily. As a remedy 
it had to be the primary goal to make the new interferometer as rigid as possible, 
i.e., to raise the mechanical eigenfrequency of the whole assembly to values as 
high as possible; then external vibrations cause the interferometer to vibrate as a 
whole of course, but the relative positions of its components are not influenced.

In turn, the visibility of the interference fringes is not impaired. The consequence 
of these considerations is that the dimensions as well as the weight of the inter­
ferometer have to be reduced drastically. Mechanical alignment of the interferom­
eter, while operating, has to be abandoned in favor of prealigned high-precision 
electron optical components. Fine alignment has to be done exclusively by electro­
magnetic deflection systems.
The practical realization of the interferometer, the electron-optical setup, 
and a beam path are given in Figure 2a,b,c. The total length of the interferometer 
is only 30 cm, the diameter of the electron-optical components 28 mm, and the 
total mass less than 1 kg. In the setup shown, up to three biprisms can be used 
according to the individual requirements of the experiment. Fine alignment is 
achieved by the deflection elements and by the coils. The homogeneous magnetic 
field created by the coils allows rotation of the directions of the wave fronts. 
Inevitable slight rotational misalignments of the biprism filaments relative to each 
other can be compensated in this way. The Wien filter incorporated in our 
instrument is a novel component in electron interferometry. It is obligatory— 
as we will see later—in multiple biprism interferometers working with low-energy

a three-biprism (—,+,—) arrangement with an enclosed area. The third, nega­
tively charged biprism deflects the beams so that they intersect at a smaller angle in 
order to increase the width of the fringes in the interference pattern.
3. ELECTRON INTERFEROMETRIC VERIFICATIONS OF WAVE­
PARTICLE DUALITY
3.1. Early Experiments: Diffraction at an Edge, Electron Biprism
Interferences, and Diffraction by Slits
Electron diffraction on macroscopic objects was observed for the first time by 
Boersch(19“21> in 1940 in an electron microscope. He observed contour fringes 
on an edge in out-of-focus electron micrographs and identified these as Fresnel 
diffraction fringes.
As an example of electron biprism interferences, a series of interferograms 
taken at an energy of 2.5 keV with our new interferometer are given in Figure 3a. 
The potential of the biprism filament was chosen in the range 0.0-1.6 V. In the 
uppermost panel of Figure 3a the shadow of the biprism filament is visible in the 
middle. The Fresnel diffraction fringes of both edges of the filament are clearly 
visible. With increasing positive voltage applied to the biprism filament the par­
tial waves begin to overlap. With further increasing angle of superposition— 
corresponding to an increasing lateral distance of the two virtual sources—more 
and more fringes become visible.
Microminiaturization was launched in Tubingen at the end of the 1950s.(22’23> 
Slits about 0.3 |xm wide in a thin copper foil were produced with this new 
technique. Single-, double-, up to ten-slit diffraction patterns were observed by 
Mollenstedt and Jonsson in 1959(24’25) and diffraction by a transmission grating 
by Holl in 1969.(26) In Figure 3b, single-, double-, and five-slit diffraction pat­
terns taken from Jonsson’s Ph.D. thesis(27) are given. The single slit interference 
pattern is complementary to the shadow image of the biprism filament given in 
Figure 3a and demonstrates Babinet’s theorem.
3.2. Novel Experiments
3.2.1. 
Buildup of an Interference Pattern out of Single Events. One of the most 
impressive experiments which directly shows quantum mechanics at work is to 
observe the buildup process of an electron biprism interference pattern by 
accumulating the arrival sites of single electrons on a photographic plate or, even 
more impressive, in the memory of an image processing system/
) While with the 
photographic method the buildup process can be seen just after the developing 
process is finished, with the image processor the buildup process can be visualized

voltage applied to the (single) biprism filament is given at the right. Fresnel diffraction fringes on both 
sides of the filament are clearly visible especially when no voltage is applied to the biprism filament,

in real time. The fringe pattern, which has been accumulated in the memory of the 
image processor, is simultaneously displayed with the electrons incoming in every 
moment. In order to be able to discriminate between the incoming electrons and 
the accumulated fringe pattern, the brightness of the dots on the cathode ray tube, 
corresponding to the momentarily incoming electrons, is enhanced by a suitable 
program routine. Unfortunately, this dynamic buildup process cannot be demon­
strated in a book. We must be content here with a static demonstration as given in 
Figure 4.
In order to obtain these micrographs the emission current of the cathode of 
our interferometer was adjusted to such a low value and the gain of the image 
intensifier to such a high level that the sites of incidence of single electrons become 
visible as tiny bright spots on the fluorescent screen of the image intensifier. In the 
series of micrographs the exposure time has been doubled from micrograph to 
micrograph resulting in an increasing density of the bright spots. While fringes

(starting from 1/8 s) has been doubled from micrograph to micrograph. With increasing integration

cannot be seen at all when one is observing the fluorescent screen and in the first 
micrograph which has been taken with an exposure time of 1/8 s, they are well 
marked in the last ones. The appearance of well-localized bright spots demon­
strates the corpuscular nature of the electrons and the arrangement of the spots to 
fringes the simultaneous presence of their wave nature.
A prerequisite for this demonstration of particle-wave duality was the 
availability of image intensifiers with a gain sufficient to visualize single electrons. 
The first micrographs showing the statistical nature of the formation of inter­

ference fringes were taken by Merli et al. in 1976(29) followed by Wohland<3°) and 
Matteucci and Pozzi/31> The micrographs presented in Figure 4 were taken in the 
first test phase of the new interferometer and presented at the 1979 meeting of the 
German Electron Microscopical Society/32)
3.2.2. 
The Wien Filter as a Device to Shift Wave Packets Longitudinally. What 
is a Wien filter, and what is the salient point of a Wien filter in an electron 
interferometric instrument? A Wien filter consists of crossed electric and mag­
netic fields (Figure 5). It is in its compensated state when the electric force on the 
electrons is just compensated by the magnetic force, that is, the electrons travel 
through the Wien filter without any deflection rectilinearly. Let us assume that the 
two coherent wave packets enter into the Wien filter Ax apart from each other and 
that the condenser plates of the Wien filter are on a potential of — U and 4-17, 
respectively. The wave packet on the right-hand side travels through the Wien 
condenser in a region of positive potential with respect to that on the left-hand 
side. That is, the wave packet on the right has a higher group velocity in the Wien 
filter than that on the left. Consequently, the wave packets leave the Wien filter 
shifted longitudinally Ay relative to each other. The acceleration and deceleration 
of the wave packets happens in the fringing electric fields of the Wien filter. With 
increasing excitation of the compensated Wien filter, the longitudinal shift in­
creases, and for sufficiently high excitation, the two wave packets leave the Wien 
filter one behind the other. They do not overlap any more, and the contrast of the 
interference fringes vanishes.

FIGURE 5. Influence of a Wien filter in its compensated state 
on two spatially separated electron wave packets and on the 
phase of the waves. The wave packets are shifted longi­
tudinally, the phase velocity is not affected (see text). There­
fore, the positions of the horizontal lines, which symbolize the 
crests of the waves, are not shifted at all by the electromagnetic 
fields inside the Wien filter.

Recent Contributions of Electron Interferometry
117
It is noteworthy that in all compensated states of the Wien filter, the electron- 
optical index of refraction equals one in the nonrelativistic limit. Consequently: 
(1) the phase velocity of the electron waves is not affected at all by the presence of 
a Wien filter in its compensated state and (2) the order of the interference is not 
increased without regard to the fact that the wave packets are shifted longitu­
dinally.
3.2.3. Coherence Lengths. The ability of a Wien filter to shift wave packets of 
charged particles longitudinally was discovered by Mollenstedt and Wohland; this 
feature was used to perform the first coherence length measurements of electron 
waves in 1980.<
’
> They increased the excitation of the Wien filter until the fringe 
contrast vanished and calculated the corresponding coherence length from the 
geometrical dimensions of their Wien filter and the electric field strength for 
vanishing fringe contrast.
33 34
In order to overcome the large errors of more than 10% inherent in the 
measurement method just mentioned, we refined it substantially in the following 
way<35>: The electric and magnetic field are no longer increased simultaneously. 
We increase in a first step the electric field only. The Wien condenser then works 
as a deflection element. Let us assume that the interference fringes are deflected, 
e.g., by 3 fringe widths to the left on the fluorescent screen. This is due to the fact 
that the wave packet traveling in the more negative region of the Wien condenser is 
slower and loses three wavelengths. We now increase the magnetic field until the 
deflection due to the electric field is just compensated. This state of the now again 
compensated Wien filter corresponds to the following physical situation: Both 
beams travel rectilinearly through the Wien filter but the left-side wave packet is 
shifted longitudinally by three wavelengths with respect to the right one in the 
Wien filter. For measuring the coherence length this procedure is repeated while 
counting the total number of fringes until the contrast in the fringe field has 
decreased to He. We define the coherence length by twice this number of fringes 
times the wavelength of the electrons. The factor limiting the precision of this 
method is given by the precision with which the contrast of the fringes can be 
determined densitometrically. This is a question of counting statistics only.
Let me note here that for this measurement method it is not necessary to know 
anything about the geometry, the field strengths and homogeneities of the electro­
magnetic fields in the Wien filter, not to mention the fringing fields. The only thing 
we need to know is the de Broglie wavelength of the electrons.
In order to simulate different energy widths of our electrons and in turn 
different coherence lengths, we superimposed to the extraction voltage of 4 kV 
of our field emitter a triangular-shaped voltage of variable amplitude. The result 
of our coherence length measurement is given in Figure 6. The natural width of the 
field emission spectrum plus 3-V triangular-shaped voltage peak to peak results 
in a coherence length of 25 nm. By reducing the amplitude to 0.5 V it increases 
to 120 nm. The natural energy width of the field emitter of 0.36 eV corresponds 
to a coherence length of 280 nm.

118
Franz Hasselbach
FIGURE 6. Coherence length as a function of energy spread of the electron beam. Different energy 
spreads were artificially simulated by superimposing a triangular-shaped voltage of 0-3 V to the 
extraction voltage of 4 kV of the field emitter. The natural energy width of the field emission of 0.36 eV 
corresponds to a coherence length of 280 nm.
In this chapter, no distinction has been made between coherence length and 
the length of the wave packet even though the length of de Broglie wave packets 
increases due to their intrinsically dispersive propagation. The question arises, 
did we measure the coherence length or the longitudinal shape of the electron wave 
packet which is varying with the distance from its origin. It is beyond the scope of 
this contribution to present the theory here or even to discuss the problem in detail. 
The result is: In spite of the fact that the wave packet spreads, the coherence length 
remains equal to its initial value, which is exclusively determined by the wave­
number spread of the beam. Irrespective of the spread of a wave packet, the fringe 
visibility depends on the coherence length only/36-38)
3.2.4. Fourier Spectroscopy of Electron Waves. For a quantitative Fourier spec­
troscopic measurement of an electron energy distribution/
) it is not sufficient 
just to count the number of fringes until a certain decrease of the contrast is 
39

reached. Here we must record quantitatively the contrast in the whole interference 
field. Such an interference field consists, e.g., for a beam energy of 2.5 keV with 
an energy spread of « 0.36 eV of about 20,000 fringes. We recorded the contrast 
in this whole interference field in sets of, e.g., ten fringes successively with a 
television camera.
In order to use all information contained in a two-dimensional fringe pattern 
and in turn to reduce the noise, the fringe intensities were integrated along the 
fringe direction. The result is a one-dimensional low-noise densitometer trace 
across a single set of fringes. The digitized data of all sets of fringes are put 
together with matched phases in a personal computer. The data are then Fourier- 
analyzed in a VAX computer. For the spectrum of the field emitter we obtained a 
full width at half maximum of 0.6 eV instead of the theoretical width of about 
0.36 eV (Figure 7a). The spectrum, which was obtained under unfavorable 
experimental conditions, demonstrates in this very first test of the new method a 
resolution of better than 0.4 eV. In a second experiment we superimposed a square 
wave of 30 V amplitude to the extraction voltage of our field emitter. This 
simulates an energy spectrum containing two discrete lines 30 eV apart from each 
other (Figure 7b). The two lines are clearly visible, the peak in the middle is an 
artifact/39)
3.2.5. The Sagnac Effect of Electron Waves. The Sagnac effect(4(M3) is one of 
the most faceted gemstones of physics: With respect to theoretical physics it links 
classical and relativistic physics in a unique way. It helped to clarify many 
interrelations between classical mechanics, the theory of relativity, nonrelativistic 
and relativistic quantum mechanics. On the other hand, it is not only of interest 
from a theoretical point of view: today’s state-of-the-art navigation systems, e.g., 
in the latest generation of civil airplanes, are based on the light optical Sagnac 
effect. Additionally, the most promising developments in the area of rotation 
sensing are based on the Sagnac effect of matter waves/44) i.e., of ions, mole­
cules/45’46) and last but not least of superfluid helium/47) With the latter, the most 
sensitive detector for absolute rotation sensing seems feasible. The first experi-
FIGURE 7. Spectra obtained by Fourier analysis, (a) Spectrum of a field emission cathode; accelerat­
ing voltage 2.5 kV (see text), (b) In order to simulate a spectrum containing two discrete lines, a square 
wave voltage of 30 V in amplitude was superimposed to the extraction voltage of the field emitter. The 
two peaks are clearly visible. The central peak is an artifact.

mental confirmations of the Sagnac effect for matter waves were undertaken by 
Zimmermann and Mercereau in 1964(48) for Cooper pairs in a rotating super­
conducting quantum interferometer (SQUID) and—following a proposal of 
Anandan<42)—by Werner et al. in 1979 for neutrons/49)
In a Sagnac experiment (Figure 8) two signals or wave packets run in opposite 
directions around an enclosed area A. The whole experimental setup rests on a 
disk and is set into rotation with respect to the laboratory frame. For the co-moving 
observer the signals run with equal velocity v around their paths and arrive at the 
detector after the time ttR/v where R is the radius of the circle. In the inertial 
system with respect to which the disk is rotating, the clockwise signal has a 
speed of v + OR and the counterclockwise, v — (1R. When we calculate the arrival 
time of the signal at the detector, this difference in speed is just compensated by the 
difference in the distances that the signals have to travel. The signals reach the 
detector at the same instant of time in the rotating and the laboratory system. In the 
classical Galilean invariant theory, there is no observable effect of the rotation. 
However, in the relativistic theory as well as in Schrodinger’s nonrelativistic 
quantum mechanics the Sagnac phase shift for matter waves is predicted.
Dieks and Nienhuis<5°) discuss the question, how is it possible that a 
nonrelativistic theory yields a phase shift at all and, moreover, the correct one? 
Their conclusion is that nonrelativistic quantum mechanics contains some rela­
tivistic elements in the sense that the quantum mechanical Galilei group “is not an 
invariance group in exactly the same way as is the Galilei group for classical 
theories. ” This group theoretical aspect of the Sagnac effect has been profoundly 
discussed by Anandan.(43) In essence, the Sagnac effect is purely a relativistic 
phenomenon: The difference in the arrival time of the two signals at the detector 
is a consequence of the fact that there exists no absolute time according to the 
theory of relativity. Thus, an adequate derivation of this time difference or the 
corresponding Sagnac phase shift is possible only within the framework of the
FIGURE 8. Principle of the Sagnac interferometer.

special theory of relativity/42’43’51) The special theory of relativity predicts for the 
Sagnac phase shift for electromagnetic and matter waves:
2m 2
<Pi — <p2 =
where E denotes the total energy of the particles or photons, h is Planck’s con­
stant, ft = ft/2'ir, c the velocity of light, A the enclosed area of any shape and fl the 
angular velocity of the rotating system, and m the relativistic mass and not the rest 
mass m0. In the nonrelativistic limit m —» mQ, the Sagnac phase shift of matter 
waves, in contrast to electromagnetic waves, becomes independent of the wave­
length.
The following should be noted: (1) The total energy of an electron is at least 
511 keV compared to 2 eV of an optical photon. Consequently, an electron Sagnac 
interferometer should be more sensitive by a corresponding factor of 250,000 
compared to an optical one. However, while it is relatively easy to realize an 
enclosed area comparable to a soccer field with light waves—let me mention that 
Michelson and Gale realized such a large area in their famous experiment to detect 
the earth’s rotation^52)—it is very hard to attain enclosed areas on the order of 
1 cm2 in electron interferometers. (2) The Sagnac phase difference does not 
depend on the speed of the signals or wave packets, but on the angular velocity 
of the rotating system only. Thus, the application of the Sagnac effect to detect 
rotation is obvious.
In the present experimental observation of the Sagnac effect of electron 
waves/51 53 54) two of the three electron biprisms (Figure 2) were used to realize an 
enclosed area of about 4 mm2. The small enclosed area necessitates relatively high 
rotation rates on the order of 1 rev/s to obtain detectable Sagnac phase shifts of 
about 3% of a fringe. These high rotation rates lead to centrifugal effects, such as 
minute bending of the vacuum chamber causing fringe shifts comparable, or even 
larger than the expected fringe shifts due to the Sagnac effect. In order to avoid any 
influence of centrifugal forces, we measured the phase differences between 
successive alternating clockwise and counterclockwise rotations with exactly the 
same rotation rates.
The Wien filter incorporated into our Sagnac interferometer (Figure 2) has 
proved to be indispensable in restoring the temporal coherence of the electron 
waves arriving in the plane of interference. In low-energy electron biprism 
interferometers the electrostatic deflection elements for fine alignment almost 
always reduce or totally destroy the longitudinal coherence in the plane of 
interference. Typically, the coherent electron wave packets travel laterally sepa­
rated, in regions differing in their electric potential through the deflection fields 
resulting in an unwanted longitudinal shift. Because of the low electron energies 
used in our interferometer, resulting in a correspondingly short coherence length, 
the longitudinal shifts in the numerous deflection systems usually add up to a value 

122

greater than the coherence length. The two wave packets arrive in the interference 
plane one after another. No fringe contrast is observed. With the Wien filter we 
routinely create a longitudinal shift that is exactly compensating that caused by the 
deflection elements/55) In the interference plane, longitudinal coherence and 
in turn maximum fringe contrast is reestablished. This is demonstrated in Figure 
9. Without excitation of the Wien filter the incoherent overlap of the arriving wave 
packets leads to a stripe of enhanced intensity in the middle of the uppermost 
micrograph (a). With increasing compensation of the relative delay of the wave 
packets by the Wien filter, temporal coherence is reestablished (b,c). The inter­
ference fringes reappear.
The phase information was extracted by image processing from the inter­
ference pattern. The pixel columns of the television camera are aligned mechan­
ically parallel to the interference fringes. The information in all pixels of one 
column is integrated. The result is a low-noise densitometer trace across our
FIGURE 9. Reestablishing temporal coherence by means of a Wien filter. Without excitation of the 
Wien filter the wave packets arrive in the plane of interference one after another (a). With increasing 
excitation of the Wien filter the interference fringes appear (b). The excitation is increased until 
maximum contrast of the interference fringes is observed corresponding to a full overlap of the wave 
packets (c). Only after this step is our low-voltage biprism interferometer fully adjusted and ready 
for an experiment.

interference field. This trace is Fourier-analyzed and the phase information is 
calculated via the arctan of the Fourier components. The phase error achieved with 
this method is less than 1%.
A high mechanical and electronic long-term stability is required. The 
wavelength of the 1.5-keV electrons is about 0.03 nm. One percent of a fringe 
corresponds to a length of0.0003 nm. The entirety of all disturbances, i.e., due to 
mechanical vibrations, electronic instabilities, and instabilities of the field emis­
sion electron source must not exceed the equivalence of this length. The stability 
needed in this experiment is comparable to that of an electron microscope with 
atomic resolution. But, while exposure times of a few seconds are usual in such 
microscopes, we need this stability for at least 10 min because of the relatively long 
time needed for accelerating and decelerating of the whole apparatus.
The results of our measurements of the Sagnac phase shift are given in Figure 
10 and agree well with theory. The error limits of about 30% are due to long-term 
drifts of the electronic supplies and instabilities of the field emission.
Let us now consider the striking formal analogy between the formula for the 
Sagnac phase shift and the Aharonov-Bohm phase shift in the nonrelativistic case:
<P1 - <p2 =
<P1 - *2  = Ads = fBdd
The Sagnac phase shift is given on the left and the Aharonov-Bohm phase shift 
on the right hand side. The surface integrals are over the oriented enclosed area, ft 
is the angular velocity vector, B the magnetic field vector, and A the vector poten­
tial. 2mft in the Sagnac formula corresponds to (e/c)B in the equation for the 
Aharonov-Bohm effect. The angular velocity corresponds to the magnetic field. 
Hendriks and Nienhuis(56> derive the Dirac, Klein Gordon, and Schrodinger equa­
tion in the rotating frame of reference and show that the rotation has the same effect 
on the Schrodinger equation, as an electromagnetic field, described by a

vector potential. That is, the Sagnac effect is the mechanical counterpart of the 
Aharonov-Bohm effect. Consequently, since the Aharonov-Bohm phase shift is 
an example for a geometric phase or Berry phase/57) the same holds for the Sagnac 
effect. Bernstein and Phillips^58) discuss the Aharonov-Bohm effect in the context 
of the mathematical theory of fiber bundles and vividly demonstrate that the 
Aharonov-Bohm experiment can be modeled by a parallel transport of a vector on 
a truncated cone capped with a spherical dome. The region of the spherical dome 
corresponds to the enclosed magnetic field and this in turn to the total curvature 
enclosed between the paths. In this model the Aharonov-Bohm phase shift equals 
the angular excess when a parallel transport of a vector over a closed curve around 
the cone is performed. In the case of the Sagnac effect the corresponding phase 
shifting field is likewise caused by a velocity-dependent potential. The study of the 
Sagnac phase shift in the framework of the fiber bundles/geometric phase model 
will shed new light on quantum physics, the theory of relativity, and their 
interrelations.

1. INTRODUCTION
In 1959 Aharonov and Bohm pointed out that in quantum mechanics, unlike in 
classical physics, there can be observable effects on charged particles (such as 
electrons) confined to an electric and magnetic field-free space when there is an 
enclosed magnetic field in a region inaccessible to the electron wave function. 
Prediction of this striking effect, known as the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect, 
stimulated intensive investigations (more than 300journal articles over the past 30 
years) which culminated in the beautiful experiments using electron holography 
and microlithography that unambiguously verified the existence of this effect 
(these experiments have been reviewed by TonomuraW in a separate contribution 
to this volume; see also the pertinent references cited therein).
It is somewhat surprising that though there have been considerable discus­
sions about the implications of the AB effect, its significance from the point of 
view of local realism has not yet received proper attention. The present chapter 
seeks to fill this gap from the perspective of Einstein’s conception of what he called 
Gespensterfelder (“ghost” waves, devoid of momentum and energy, guiding the 
atomic and subatomic entities) which will be referred to as “empty” waves in the 
present chapter. It is important to recall that in his “Reply to Criticisms,” 
Einstein(2) stated that the problem of wave-particle duality was “probably the 
most interesting subject” to discuss. In the same book, BohE3) referred to Ein­
stein’s “use of such picturesque phrases as ghost waves (Gespensterfelder)” 
127

which, Bohr emphasized, “implied no tendency to mysticism, but illuminated 
rather a profound humor behind his piercing remarks. ”
Almost all the discussions concerning the significance of the AB effect give 
the impression that its existence (now experimentally proved) should necessarily 
imply a nonlocal effect. However, in their original paper, Aharonov and Bohm(4) 
had written: “Two possible directions are clear. First, we may try to formulate a 
non-local theory in which, for example, the electron could interact with a field that 
was a finite distance away. . . . Secondly, we may retain the present local theory 
and, instead, we may try to give a further new interpretation to the potentials.” 
Later, Aharonov
*
5) advocated the outlook viewing the AB effect as an example of a 
nonlocal phenomenon, since the value of the vector potential at a point is not gauge 
invariant and therefore not measurable. The interpretation of the AB effect as a 
manifestation of a kind of nonlocality in quantum mechanics was also discussed 
by Spasskii and Moskovskii,
*
6) Van Kampen,
*
7) Olarin and Popescu.
*
8) Philippidis 
et al.W analyzed the meaning of the AB effect using the quantum potential 
approach and concluded that nonlocal aspects of quantum mechanics come into 
play as a result of “global” determination of the quantum potential which, in their 
words, provides “an intuitive understanding in the context of the AB effect of what 
may physically underlie Bohr’s notion of the wholeness of the form of the 
experimental conditions and the content of the experimental results. ” On the other 
hand, Yang
*
10) asserted: “The AB effect is the result of a local equation of motion 
in the Heisenberg representation, but with non-commuting dynamical variables. 
Electrodynamics is not non-local in quantum mechanics. ” It is also relevant to 
note that the recent analysis of the time-dependent AB effect (the effect of a time­
varying enclosed magnetic flux on the AB phase-shift)
*
11’12) has revealed that in a 
dynamic situation the magnetic phase-shift is not determined solely by the 
enclosed flux but also depends on the time of switching of the flux. Brown and 
Home
*
12) show that the effect has to be attributed to the vector potential acting 
locally at the electron’s position as the center of the wave packet moves along the 
interfering stationary-action trajectories from the source to the screen. In such a 
time-dependent case, Stokes’s theorem ceases to be applicable; hence, Brown and 
Home
*
12) conclude: “There are no global aspects and this implies that their 
invocation in the static limit reflects a mathematical accident rather than a 
fundamental physical feature.”
Experimental investigations of the AB effect carried out in the early 1960s
*
13) 
claimed to have confirmed the existence of this phenomenon. However, it was later 
pointed out
*
14) that since these experiments used current-carrying solenoids or 
magnetic whiskers of finite length, the observable effects on the electrons could be 
accounted for by the inevitable leakage of magnetic field through the ends. 
Furthermore, some authors
*
15) even questioned the theoretical justification for 
the AB effect on the issues related to the use of Stokes’s theorem in the multiply- 
connected space to fix the vector potential and also on the ground of an incom­
patibility with energy and momentum conservation. The experiments by Tono- 

Aharonov-Bohm Effect
129
mura(1) settled the controversy decisively. These experiments used tiny toroidal 
magnets (a few microns in diameter) avoiding completely the leakage effects. In 
the light of these experiments one is compelled to accept the physical reality of the 
AB effect whose deeper understanding promises to provide new insights into 
conceptual foundations of quantum mechanics. In the following section we 
recapitulate briefly the key elements in the theoretical treatment of the AB effect.
2. THEORY OF THE AB EFFECT
It is well known that Maxwell’s equation can be expressed in the following 
elegant form in terms of the 4-vector potential A|I(x) = (A(x), i$(x)) at every 
spacetime point x = (x, ict):
□A/x) = -(4tt/c)^(x) 
(1)
where j^x) = (j(x), zcp(x)) is the 4-current and A^ satisfies the Lorentz condition
We now note that the 4-vector potential A^ can undergo what is known as 
gauge transformations of the second kind:
a|X^a; = Ah + ^ 
(3)
pc
where A is a scalar function of x that satisfies the homogeneous D’Alembertian 
equation
□A = 0 
(4)
It is because of Eq. (4) that both Eqs. (1) and (2) remain unchanged when subjected 
to Eq. (3). Let us now consider the electromagnetic tensor F , which is 
antisymmetric in |x, v and comprises six independent quantities, viz. the compo­
nents of the electric field E and of the magnetic field B. It is easily seen that its 
well-known expression in terms of the 4-potential, given by
F =
(5)
also remains unaltered by the transformation (3) subjected to (4). In classical 
physics the 4-potential A^ is regarded as a mathematical construct, devoid of any

130
Dipankar Home and Franco Selleri
physical significance in itself, but a useful aid in computing the fields which 
generate physically observable effects by acting on the charges, accelerating them 
and thereby affecting their physical attributes such as energy and momentum.
The ingenuity of the AB example lies in that it provides an instance where a 
physically observable quantum mechanical effect on charged particles is ascrib­
able to even when F^v = 0 (zero-field condition). Note that the fields deduced 
from (5) turn out to be
B = V X A
It is then evident that sufficient conditions for E = B = 0 are: (i) Vd> = 0, (ii) V x 
A = 0, and (iii) dA/dt = 0; i.e., A be time-independent. However, it is not 
necessary for A or O to vanish in order to satisfy these conditions. The AB example 
in which A #= 0 but still E = B = 0 is the following:
We consider a very long and closely wound current-carrying cylindrical 
solenoid. Then one has essentially a confined magnetic field B trapped inside the 
solenoid. However, A ¥= 0 outside the solenoid because it has to satisfy the 
following condition because of Stokes’s theorem:
O = fn-dS = f A-dx 
(7)
where is the total magnetic flux through every closed circuit containing the 
symmetry center of the solenoid.
Now let us consider a beam of electrons split into two parts (Figure 1), each 
going on opposite sides of the solenoid, but avoiding it. The beams are recombined 
within the region F where at any point, say, P the wave function can easily be 
shown to be given by
'P = ^exp(-z51/^) + ^exp(-/52/ft) 
(8)
where
5] = (—e/c) f 
(9)
and
S2 = (—e/c) J 
(10)
with the integrals extending over the trajectories associated with the first and the 
second wave packet, and ^P2 are the wave functions when A = 0.

Aharonov-Bohm Effect
131
FIGURE 1. A beam of electrons going around a solenoid on opposite sides (ABF and ACF) are 
recombined within the region F
The interference pattern observed in the region F will depend on the phase 
difference
(Sj —S2)/ft = (elhc)$ A-dx= (e/hc)4> 
(11)
which is determined by the vector potential A through the gauge invariant closed 
loop integral A-dx where the closed path of integration is ABFCA of Figure 1. 
We have, therefore, an observable phase difference which results in the shift of 
the interference pattern depending on 0. There are two most important features of 
this effect that need to be stressed:
A. The magnetic field is confined to a region that should be totally inacces­
sible to electrons that propagate in a different region of space where 
electric and magnetic fields are rigorously zero.
B. The vector potential A must instead be nonvanishing in the region where 
the electrons propagate.
3. LOOKING BEYOND THE MATHEMATICAL FORMALISM
If one follows the standard interpretation espoused by the Bohr-Heisenberg 
school, the question of any further “understanding” of the AB effect does not 
arise. According to this viewpoint, quantum mechanics is to be regarded as a 
package of mathematical recipes by means of which one can predict the statistical 
results obtainable under specified experimental conditions; the possibility of 
providing a consistent space-time causal description of the individual quantum 
events (accounting for the observed statistical results) is ruled out even in 
principle. On the other hand, there exists a different school of thought that believes 
that the need for a space-time causal description of “underlying physical reality” 

132
Dipankar Home and Franco Selleri
in terms of an unambiguous well-defined model is of paramount importance, a 
point of view eloquently articulated in the following words of Einstein
*
16): 
“Physics is the attempt at the conceptual construction of a model of the real world, 
as well as its lawful structure. ” We now know of rigorous theoretical models that 
provide in a quantitative way a causal description in space and time of individual 
microevents underlying many quantum phenomena (for an up-to-date overview 
see Selleri
*
17)). There is no difficulty, for example, in reproducing in such a way the 
quantum mechanical predictions for the famous double-slit experiments. There is 
even a movie, produced with a computer by C. Dewdney, in which individual 
particle trajectories can be seen to reproduce the statistical interference pattern.
The main idea here is to take seriously the Einstein-de Broglie
*
18) picture of 
the microphysical objects, according to which an individual atomic entity is 
actually a localized particle accompanied by an extended, objectively real wave 
0(x,y,z,r) (proportional to the Schrodinger wave function ^(x,y,z,0) which 
“guides” the particle through its trajectory. The action of the wave on the particle 
is represented by a suitably defined “quantum potential,” say, Q (which has 
qualitatively new features vis-a-vis the so-called classical potentials) whose exact 
expression can be deduced from the solution of the Schrodinger equation written 
in the form 'F = 7?exp(z5/ft):
Q = "
ft2 V2/?
2m R
(12)
The upshot of the various calculations using the “quantum potential” 
approach is the realization that the quantum phenomena can be consistently 
interpreted in terms of the dual aspects of the wave and the particle which together 
compose a quantum object, both behaving causally in space and time. One can 
therefore conclude that the way for a deeper probing of the nature of physical 
reality underlying the quantum phenomena has opened up and the barrier pre­
sented by the so-called “impossibility” or “no-go theorems” has been overcome. 
It is against the background of this scenario that we now proceed to analyze the 
ramifications of the AB effect from the point of view of “realist” descriptions 
adhering to the “locality” (no action at a distance) condition. As everybody 
knows, the quantum potential Q is strictly local only for the case of a single 
particle. The Schrodinger wave function describing two particles is instead
'P = ^(XpjpZp x2,y2,z2; t) 
(13)
and depends on the coordinates of both particles. As a consequence of this, Bohm 
and Hiley showed that the quantum potential Q acting e.g. on particle “1” is
0 = fi2 V^FfrpypZp; x2,y2,z2; r)|
1 
2m ^(XpjpZp x2,y2,z2; r)| 
(14)

Aharonov-Bohm Effect
133
and depends in general on the instantaneous position of particle “2.” This is 
clearly a form of nonlocality. Several comments should, however, be added. First, 
it has never been shown that violations of Bell’s inequality occur as a consequence 
of (14), and our feeling is that one deals here more with a formal than with an 
essential type of nonlocality. Second, the validity of the two-body Schrodinger 
equation has been checked experimentally only for particles at a very short 
distance (e.g., in the case of the He atom). Third, it can be hoped to deduce the 
many-body Schrodinger equation in configuration space from the single-particle 
equation in ordinary space, and attempts in this direction have been made, e.g., by 
Andrade e Silva/19) No impossibility theorem has ever been formulated against the 
success of such an idea and so it appears that nonlocality implied by (14) will be 
eliminated if one can find a formulation of the Schrodinger equation for n parti­
cles in ordinary three-dimensional space.
4. LOCAL REALIST INTERPRETATION OF THE AB EFFECT
We begin by recalling that the basic motivation for introducing the concept of 
fields is to enable physical effects on charged particles to be understood as local 
phenomena. The central puzzle posed by the AB effect is that it defies such an 
understanding in terms of local fields. One has to inevitably take resort to the 
concept of vector potential, but then the value of vector potential at a given space­
time point is apparently devoid of any physical reality because it is not a gauge 
invariant quantity. This difficulty readily dissolves if one adopts the “quantum 
potential” approach. Note that the quantum potential Q (as defined in Eq. (12)) at 
a given space-time point is gauge invariant. In the regions surrounding points 
B and C of Figure 1 we have the wave functions for the electron given by
= ^exp(-/S1/ft) 
(15)
and
= 4^exp(—fS2/&)

respectively, where and are the wave functions corresponding to A = 0. 
The quantum potential Q depends only on |Tj = |^| and on |¥2| = in the 
two said regions and is therefore gauge invariant.
In the region surrounding point P of Figure 1 we have according to (8), the 
wave function given by
M2 = l^l2 + W + 2|^||4^| cos [(Sj - S2)/ft] 
(17)
which is gauge invariant since |^|, |¥§|, and (Sj - S2) are so. Q being a function 
only of |^| is also therefore gauge invariant.

As shown by Philippidis et alS9) one can calculate explicitly the trajectories 
(Figure 2a and b) in the AB effect situation and explain the fringe shift as arising 
from the interaction of the electrons with the quantum potential. The quantum 
potential, therefore, mediates the local effect of the gauge-independent part of the 
vector potential on the electrons. There is no need to invoke the idea of an 
“immediate nonlocal action” by the enclosed magnetic flux on electrons. Philip­
pidis et al., however, restrict their attention in interpreting their calculations as an 
illustration of nonlocal aspects of quantum mechanics manifested through the so- 
called “global” determination of the quantum potential. In what follows we 
discuss the relevant significance from a local realist point of view.
The local action of the physically real empty wave C>(x,y,z,t) on an electron 
at a space-time point is mediated through the value of the quantum potential at that 
point, which in turn is determined by the solution ty(x,y,z,t) of the Schrodinger 
equation, along with the relevant boundary conditions. In the AB example, since 
'P contains a phase factor involving the preexisting vector potential A(x,y,z), the 
action of an empty wave on each individual electron changes its trajectory 
(compared to the situation A = 0) and results in the overall shift of the interference 
pattern. A significant element inherent in this interpretation of the AB effect is that 
momentum (and eventually energy) of each individual electron gets altered by this 
action of the empty wave, though the empty wave in itself is devoid of momentum 
(and energy) and since F^v = 0, the electromagnetic momentum (and energy) 
density also vanishes in the region accessible to the electrons (classically as well as 
quantum mechanically), because ignoring the zero point fluctuations of the field 
strengths, quantum electrodynamics satisfies the correspondence principle, a 
point discussed in the standard treatise by Heitler/20) It is, therefore, evident 
that the momentum and energy conservation laws do not hold for the individual 
electron trajectories interpreted in terms of local realism. This is, of course, an 
inevitable feature associated with the local realist interpretation of quantum 
interference phenomena in terms of empty waves and not limited to the AB effect. 
For instance, in the double slit experiment, one gets diffraction pattern-like 
distribution of particle trajectories emerging from the slits corresponding to an 
incident uniform distribution of particles. Here again, the empty waves act on the 
individual particles modifying their momentum even though there is no other 
source with which they can locally exchange momentum. One could think that “in 
practice” momentum is exchanged with the screen on which the slits are pierced 
and hence no violation of the conservation laws need be invoked. But this can at 
most explain the particle deviations occurring in the single slit (diffraction) 
experiment. In a double-slit experiment the relevant wave interference is essen­
tially active in a region several centimeters away from the screen and in such

potential approach; (b) particle trajectories for the AB effect situation with the shifts arising due to the

conditions it is obvious that no local interaction with the screen can explain the 
modified momentum distribution of the particles.
The speciality of the AB effect lies in that here, even at the statistical level, 
the momentum (and energy) conservation does not hold from the point of view of 
local realism. This is easily seen by considering that 0Pj -Hd/dxyV) has different 
values for A = 0 and A =# 0 (AB example) because of the presence of the phase 
factor exp(—ie/c) J A-dx in 'F when A ¥= 0, which leads to an additional con­
tribution to the momentum expectation value. Note that

where is the wave function when A = 0 and S = (—e/c) J A(x)-dx.
It is therefore evident in the AB effect-type situation the expectation value of 
momentum (and energy) changes even though locally the electromagnetic field 
has zero momentum (and zero energy). One possible argument^21) at this stage 
could be that the reflection of the electrons at the impenetrable boundary of the 
enclosed magnetic flux provides the source for this momentum (and energy) 
change. However, this argument can be readily circumvented by considering a 
localized wave packet whose spreading during the time of transit is made 
negligibly small (by taking an initially highly localized packet with sufficiently 
high energy so that its time of transit is quite small) so that it remains confined to a 
region away from the boundary of the trapped flux. Another point that might be 
raised is that a moving electron produces a magnetic field which overlaps with the 
enclosed magnetic field giving rise to an additional source of interaction energy. 
However, in the experiments by Tonomura et al., the enclosed magnetic field is 
shielded by a superconducting barrier which (due to the Meissner effect) excludes 
the possibility of such an overlap. The only way one can, therefore, salvage the 
momentum (and energy) conservation laws in the AB example is by invoking 
“nonlocal” influence of the enclosed magnetic flux on electrons. For those 
believing in local realism the physical reality of the AB effect has, therefore, the 
important message that the locality condition and momentum (energy) conserva­
tion laws appear to be incompatible for such quantum mechanical phenomena. 
This is extremely worrying for anyone who believes in a realistic and rationalistic 
approach to physics, given the enormous amount of empirical evidences that 
overwhelmingly support the conservation laws. This deep problem, perhaps, 
hides an equally profound truth that should be brought to light. One possible 
conjecture is that the zero point fluctuations of the field strengths could provide 
locally the missing balance of momentum and energy for the particle trajectories 
in the AB effect-type situations. The validity of this conjecture needs to be 
carefully assessed by more detailed considerations, but we would like to stress that 
the reality of the quantum zero point field of the vacuum, strikingly manifested

137
in the attraction between neighboring uncharged metallic plates in vacuum (known 
as the Casimir effect), should be taken seriously. The fluctuations of the field 
strengths about the mean value zero in the vacuum need not necessarily be random 
and it could well be that the momentum and energy changes involved in the local 
action of the quantum potential on particles are mediated through these zero point 
fluctuations.

CHAPTER 8
Are Two-Beam Self-Interferences 
Mass-Independent?
Not Thoroughly Known (?) Role of the Mass
Yujiro Koh
1. INTRODUCTION and historical backgrounds
The symmetric two-beam self-interference of single particles, which is one of the 
most elementary quantum processes and named after Dirac, is usually understood 
to exhibit the same normalized interference pattern under the same geometric 
condition for both the wavelength and slit-detector system, no matter how different 
the properties
*
 of the particles are (abbreviated as the same-geometry-interference 
patterns of various particles).
Although the above assumption (abbreviated as the Dirac assumption) con­
tributed to simplifying quantum mechanics at its beginnings, I think that the 
experimental basis of the assumption, or the evidence as to whether there is any 
difference among self-interferences of various particles (abbreviated as the 
particle-independence concept in the Dirac assumption) or not, was at that time 
(and is even now) disproportionately weak, in contrast to its important roles in 
theories, e.g., that for the wave function reduction in measurement theories. At the 
stage of 1925-1928, when the early construction of quantum mechanics had 
finished, the experimental data of the self-interferences of non-massless particles 
which might be available to test the Dirac assumption were the diffraction of 
electrons by crystal only.
The discovery of the electron crystal diffraction, however, could not support

the Dirac assumption experimentally, in spite of its contribution to the wave­
particle dualism. The reason is that, at the technical level in those days, it was 
impossible to ascertain evidently the particle-independence concept between 
electron and X-ray photon, by observation only of too complicated crystal 
diffraction patterns due to multiple diffraction under exposure to the background 
reflection. Since, at that time, the simplest two-beam self-interference (e.g., 
double-slit diffraction) patterns of various particles could not be realized, it was 
actually impossible to test the Dirac assumption experimentally by such simple 
same-geometry-interference patterns.
In describing the actual history, it can be pointed out that the particle­
independence concept in the Dirac assumption has played the same role as a 
principle of simplicity. The subsequent accumulation of a vast amount of quantum­
physical information including the neutron crystal diffraction has not changed the 
situation basically, but has extended the particle-independence assumption from 
the simple two-beam self-interference to the whole of interference phenomena. It 
must, however, be remembered that in the history of science there are examples 
where even the important basic laws based on the simplicity principle, such as the 
mass-conservation law, could be shown to hold only approximately, not exactly.
The two-beam self-interferences of non-massless particles have been realized 
with great technical difficulties since 1952 (~25 years after the appearance of 
quantum mechanics), as shown in Table I. In 1969(6) I noticed that the electron 
biprism techniques could be modified to test the Dirac assumption, and in 1985<7> 
the neutron double-slit diffraction as well. Since then, in order to compare the two- 
beam self-interferences of the X-ray photon, electron, proton, and neutron, my 
colleague and I have been investigating the possible modifications of the experi­
mental techniques used in the area of the above-named particles. Our aim is to 
make the self-interference patterns so distinct, like the ideal same-geometry-

interference patterns, as to be able to distinguish whether the particle-independence 
concept is correct or not.
Of course, the wide range of the rest masses of these interfering particles 
creates difficult technical problems. For example, the condition of the same 
wavelength in the same-geometry-interference pattern is crucial. However, we 
do not think that it is hopeless to utilize the simple structure in the two-beam 
setups and reexamine the so far ignored role of the particle’s history before 
superposition. Then, it seems possible for us to make proposals of the modified 
two-beam self-interference experiments, which satisfy the above-mentioned aim, 
realizable by using continuous developments of existing techniques (Section 2).
The fundamental problem left to be overcome in the proposed experiments is 
estimation of machine times in the particle source necessary for accumulating 
data to obtain reliable information as to whether the Dirac assumption will get 
more exact or only transitionally approximate (Section 2.1).
In the former case which is advantageous to the Copenhagen interpretation, 
the first experimental evidence for the particle-independence assumption will be 
brought forward. Other new weak points will also be pointed out (Section 3).
In the latter case the estimation seems to be impossible unless the behaviors of 
the particles (possibly slow) between splitter and detector are described in a 
slightly different way from the usual one, considering the particle-independence 
assumption as the first approximation which has to be improved in the next stage. 
Then, the long-pending debates about some propositions in the Copenhagen 
interpretation may be reexamined (Section 4).
It should be emphasized, however, that the meaning of the proposed experi­
ments is ambivalent for the respective interpretations of both cases.
2. PROPOSITIONS OF NEW TEST EXPERIMENTS
In the modified experiments which are proposed to test the particle­
independence concept in the Dirac assumption, the points of modification for the 
existing techniques are as follows: (A) Extension of the biprism techniques from 
electron to proton or heavier ions. (B) Macroscopic separation of the two split 
beams of the two-beam interference setup, by an artificially controllable separator 
of macroscopic Total Separated Path Lengths
*
 (abbreviated as TSPL, according to 
*TSPL can be said to be a special kind of the particle’s parametrized history prior to superposition. 
TSPL should not be confused with conventional path difference which is comprehended in the 
vagueness of the TSPL concept itself.
The fact (which is liable to be misunderstood) that TSPL play no role in the two-beam interference 
has been experimentally ascertained only for two (not necessarily split) beams of macroscopic or 
many-particle waves (e.g., two laser beams of slightly different frequencies), but never for quan­
tum-mechanical two split beams of single particles. It is, I surmise, unsure even for visible single 
photons, since beam intensities high enough for too long TSPL of two split beams of single photons 
will be difficult technically; though possible for two laser beams.

Ref. 6) which are elongated between the splitter and the exit slits in such a way that 
the separated beams cannot be superposed in front of the exit slits. (Examples of 
TSPL in existing techniques are illustrated in Figure la and lb.) In both A and 
B the restriction of the same-geometry-interference pattern must be maintained 
between the exit slits and the detectors.
In order to parametrize the normalized two-beam interference pattern, the 
visibility
V = (U - Wdmax + kin)
introduced by Michelson to measure the degree of unobscurity of the interference 
fringes, is convenient. In short, the proposed experiments are measurements of the 
TSPL versus V curves of the double-slit diffractions of X-ray photon, neutron,

and the ion-biprism interferences under the restriction of as close to the same­
geometry-interference as possible and comparison among them, although the 
Dirac assumption as a simplicity principle asserts all the same V = constant line 
without any experimental basis.

controllable TSPL is realized by replacing the boron wire with a barrier of neutron­
absorber film of -100 width extended in variable length - 100 jim-100 cm 
(or longer if necessary and possible) of the incident beam direction, so that the 
split beams cannot be superposed with each other in front of the exit slits. The 
superposing space between the exit slits and the detector plane is kept unchanged 
for the variable TSPL. The normalized constant-X wave function in the above 
space is exactly the same, as long as the incident beam can be regarded as paral­
lel, no matter how long the TSPL are.
The data of Figure 2b correspond to a point (TSPL - 100 pum, V = 0.60) 
on the TSPL-V plane. For the setup of Figure 3, the Dirac assumption predicts a 
V = 0.60 straight line in a possible range of TSPL as an example of the TSPL-V 
curve. The technical upper bounds (— order of 1 m) of TSPL will be limited by 
the reliability of the location techniques on a huge optical bench on which the 
slits, splitter, and separator must be mounted exactly.
There is no essential problem which cannot be overcome technically. But 
Zeilinger et alS5^ needed the machine time of 7.5 days to obtain just Figure 2b. In 
practice, we are unable to design any plan for accumulating enough data to 
measure a reliable TSPL-V curve, unless we can estimate beforehand total 
machine time necessary and sufficient for an image of the whole experiment plan 
(Section 4, point 4).
In any case, either independence or dependence of the visibility upon TSPL 
will have important physical meanings.

145
2.2. TSPL versus V Curve
In observation of the TSPL-V curves, there is no conflict with the Heisenberg 
uncertainty principle. In fact, the Dirac assumption assumes the V = constant 
lines, as examples of the TSPL-V curves, for all particles, as long as their two- 
beam self-interferences are possible. The possibility to observe the TSPL-Vcurve 
is compatible with the impossibility of simultaneous observation of orbit and 
interference fringes. This compatibility should not be regarded as puzzling ac­
cording to the uncertainty principle.
Nevertheless, we cannot but feel it puzzling that the same-geometry­
interference patterns of all two-beam self-interfering particles with variable TSPL 
have the same normalized fringe shape and their TSPL-V curves are the same V = 
constant line, no matter how different the particles’ properties are. This feeling of 
puzzlement is illustrated in Figure 4 with “Another Question of the Symbol Cat of 
the International Workshop on Matter Wave Interferometry, Wien, 1987” which 
is different from the conventional question about her career or orbit just after 
splitting.
Since the physics during the time interval = (TSPL)/(speed), both experi­
mental and theoretical, is scarcely known, it does not seem unnatural for us to 
expect that in the TSPL-V curves of the same-geometry-interference patterns
daily-life order in the neutron
double-alit experiment with clear fringes (1981,Zeilinger et al.)
FIGURE 4. The cat cannot be sure about whether or not all will have the same future (interference 
pattern), though they have obeyed the order (uncertainty principle) of Heisenberg well and been under 
the same environment (geometric condition).

146
Yujiro Koh
there may be distinguishable differences dependent on the properties of the 
particles in the following ways:
A. The interference fringes should become more obscure for heavy masses as 
the TSPL become longer.
B. The particle-independence concept in the Dirac assumption should be 
treated as the first approximation.
2.3. Effect of Source Size
Next, before the TSPL-V curves of various particles are discussed, an effect 
of source size on observation of the visibility must be investigated. Excluding 
the two exceptional cases of neutron double-slit diffraction and electron biprism 
interference, it is technically not easy for us to decrease the source size effect 
which is injurious to the apparent fringe clearness or visibility.
The actual two-beam interference fringes, of both double slits and biprism, 
can be calculated as the weighted average of fringes from each point-source 
(weighted weight point-source intensity) over the tiny source domain spreading 
near the plane of symmetry of the two-beam interference setup. The domain can be 
either an assemblage of real points emitting actually interfering particles or only a 
focal region of incident beam through a lens device.

where alb = (source-fiber distance)/(fiber-observation distance), W is the source 
width perpendicular to incidence, A = X(a + b)/(separation of virtual sources) 
is the spacing of fringes in the observation plane perpendicular to incidence.
VD_D{(W/a)->0}/VD_D = 1/VD_D = CD_D 
(3)
♦Assuming that the fringe intensity at x, i(x,s), of each particle radiated from a point source at s, is

and the weighted average of the fringe intensity at x is

where x and s are deviations from the plane of symmetry, respectively, on the observation and source 
planes perpendicular to the incidence. The source intensity a(s) is uniform.
DrahoS and Delong ascertained that in their electron-biprism experiment, as in the old visible- 
photon biprism, according to variation of the factor sin {(irb/A)-(W7a)} for increase of (W7A), positions 
of the fringe maxima and minima are alternated or the visibility becomes zero at (W/A) = alb, 
2alb, .... This fact seems to show enough reliability of their assumptions.

147
can be regarded as a correction factor in order to calculate the corrected visibility 
for a point source on the symmetry plane from the observed visibility of 
symmetrical fringes for sources distributed in a domain of small size W.
Their assumption from which VD_D and CD_D have been derived cannot be 
said to be well-grounded. But the oscillatory dependence of VD_D on (W/A) has 
been ascertained experimentally. CD_D and VD_D seem to be usable as the 
correction factor and basic data for designing a future experimental setup.
The neutron double-slit diffraction of parallel incidence is under specially 
advantageous conditions because of the correction factor CD_D(W/a W/&) — 1 
almost independent of W, high source intensity, and high detection efficiency, 
compared with the other neutral particles in Table I. For the other neutral particles, 
however, such advantages are ineffective.
2.4, Modified Ion Biprism
Structures of electrodes of the electron biprism are simple enough that 
extension of the biprism techniques from electron to proton or heavier ions, adding 
the beam separator of adjustable TSPL, is realizable under the restriction of nearly 
equal wavelengths.
The term realizability is used here in the meaning of possibility to be made 
real, in a scope of continuous development from existing techniques, without both 
technical and financial difficulties which cannot be overcome essentially. The 
realizable experiment should be distinguished from the so-called Gedanken 
experiment: only the experimenter’s intention determines whether the former 
will be carried out or not, while the latter may be often impossible in practice, 
though possible theoretically.
Energies and £ = v/c values for important ions in Table I and X-ray photon 
are estimated in order to get the feeling of their orders of magnitude in a case where 
their wavelengths are unified to 0.02 A of the same order as that in the electron­
biprism experiment of Mollenstedt and Bayh<9’10); 620 keV and 1 for X-ray photon, 
290 keV and 0.77 for electron, 210 eV and 0.66 x 10“4 for proton, 105 eV 
and 0.33 x 10-4 for deuteron, etc.
As a necessary condition for the wire electrode of the biprism in order to 
observe apparently clear interference fringes, we can derive the condition (Bayh’s 
Winkelkoharenzbedingung(10)) that
bW/ak 20(W/X) = (d/a)(W/X) -> 0 
(4)
where d = 20a is the wire diameter, since
VD_D(TrbW/ak) 1 - TT2(Z?W/aA)2/(3!) « 1 - ir2(20W/X)2/(3!)

148
Yujiro Koh
In the case of the electron biprism, very small values of (d/a)(W7X) have been 
achieved as a result of modern electron-microscope techniques, especially due 
to the exceptionally small W — 200 ~ 50 A of the pointed hot emission filament or 
the cold emission tip. The very clear fringes of the experiment of Mollenstedt and 
Bayh<9-10) correspond to (d/n)(W/X) = (1 jun/245 mm)(200 A/0.06 A) = 0.0136 
and VD_D ~ 0.99974. Even for d = 20 |xm, Bayh<10) reported still recognizable 
fringes, which correspond to (d/a)(W/X) — 0.272 and VD_D « 0.883.
The TSPL = 52 cm shown in Figure lb is a record long TSPL obtained as a 
by-product of the beam’s lateral separation as wide as possible. It has, however, not 
yet been investigated as to how the visibility changes for TSPL > 52 cm. The 
maximum length 52 cm reported by Mollenstedt and Bayh<9»10) may be a signifi­
cant feature or a symptom of the in-flight transition (Section 4, point 3).
For the biprism of protons and heavier ions, it is hopeless for us to invent the 
same type source as that of electrons. Instead, it seems hopeful that focal regions 
of their incident beams through some ion-optical lens devices will play roles of 
virtual image sources of small W. Expression (4) is useful as a necessary condition 
for the smallness of W. For example, 0.3 > (d/a)(W/X) = (1 |im/250 mm)(W/0.02 
A) gives 1500 A > W. For W not small enough, however, DrahoS-Delong’s 
assumptions for (2) become inappropriate.

*T. Sasaki is constructing a low-energy proton source, which has an extremely small width, by means of 
contraction of the two tandem magnets of iron-core (the image contractor). Its main design factor, 
Winkelkoharenzbedingung, is
(d/a)(W/X) = (1 p.m/250 mm)(0.2 p.m/2.9 A) ~ 0.27
This design factor is on the same order as that of Bayh/10) resulting in still recognizable fringes. 
Compared with J — 100 jim in Figure 2a, d — 1 |xm in Sasaki’s factor is so small that the beam separator 
of the absorber-film type, as exemplified in Figure 3, will be impossible. Beam separation other than 
that of the electromagnetic method, as exemplified in Figure lb, will be difficult.
In spite of these difficulties, I think that the extension of the biprism 
techniques from electrons to ions, including a preacceleration for detection if 
necessary, is realizable in the meaning of this Section within the scope of the 
continuous development of modem ion optics, until the very low energies of ions 
make application of the ion optics inappropriate.
3. IS THE DIRAC ASSUMPTION APPROXIMATE OR NOT?
The possibilities of experimental trials testing the reliability of the Dirac 
assumption by measuring the various TSPL-V curves have been treated in the 
preceding sections. In the foundations of such trials, I cannot deny there are 
some dubieties about the belief that the Dirac assumption cannot be approximate 
because of its great contribution. Reasons for the dubieties can be itemized from 
the viewpoint of the proposed experiments as follows.

Are Two-Beam Self-Interferences Mass-Independent?
149
1. As discussed in Section 2.2, the expected mass-dependence of the TSPL- 
V curves.
2. In the neutron double-slit diffraction of Zeilinger et al.,& the neutron 
wavelength Xn = 18.45 A corresponds to the neutron speed vn = 211.4 ms-1. The 
flight time interval from the splitter to the detector TSD = 5 m/vn = 23.65 ms. The 
extremely low speed is impressive and these values are on the order of macro­
scopic daily life (vn < speed of the supersonic airplane). When biprisms of protons 
and heavier ions are realized, the more impressive situations where the lower 
speeds of the heavier ions are on the daily-life order will be reached. The flight 
time interval TSD will be elongated without limit by use of the splitter-detector 
distance elongated easily. We should note that such situations will be realizable in 
the meaning of Section 2.4 and, in part, have already been realized (neutron 
double-slit diffraction), compared with practically impossible Gedankenexperi- 
mente (such as often used in measurement theory).
Although the indeterministic distribution of final states of the two-beam 
interference cannot but be accepted as an experimental fact, it seems to be too 
unnatural and incomprehensible that the image of behavior of the possibly heavy 
and slow interfering particle in the unlimitedly long TSD is abandoned on principle, 
except description by the superposed wave functions. Similarly so it does that its 
classical orbit in the whole interval of TSD appears suddenly after being disturbed 
by some observation. The heavier or the longer they are, the more unnatural the 
situation is.
3. Figure 5 shows the realizable constant-X ion biprisms which have six 
artificially controllable functions: mass number of the ions themselves, variable 
voltage V applied to the electrodes, beam splitter as the separator of adjustable 
TSPL, position of the observation plane, and adjustable two exit slits.
When one beam of the split beams is shut out by the corresponding exit slit, 
the ion biprism is transformed into the beam deflector. By gradually and continu­
ously opening and closing one of the exit slits for the beam from image source Oa, 
the final particle distribution on the observation plane is converted from the pattern 
of quantum-mechanical two-beam interference fringes, Fap in (Bap), to that of the 
classical deflector slit image, Dvp in (SvjJ), and conversely, back and forth. Dvp 
itself, however, has the edge diffraction of the wave function, as calculated by the 
Fraunhofer diffraction theory of classical optics. In more detail, the particle 
distribution as the form, Fap + R(s) x Dvp, where the mixing ratio, 7?(s), is 
dependent upon the degree, s, of symmetry of the two split beams. There is no 
reason why it should be asserted that the so-called wave function reduction can 
take part in only the interference phenomenon resulting in the interference pattern 
Fap. The wave function reductions take place in both the two-beam interference 
for the biprism (Bap) and the edge diffraction for the deflector (Svp).
For both setups of (Sv{3) and (Bap), the behaviors of ions in TSD can be 
described by the respective wave functions which are determined by the respective 
conditions; the former in (Svp) is made so as to be different from the latter in (Bap)

with the artificial operation that the beam from the virtual image source Oa is 
restricted by means of the controllable slit. When the slit is closed perfectly, the 
description by the classical orbit, as in the geometrical optics for visible photon, 
also becomes possible for the behavior in TSD for (Svp). However, the more widely 
the slit is opened, the less meaning the classical orbit has. For the symmetric two 
split beams, the classical description plays no role.
Although it is correct to describe (Svp) as classical, it is not correct to 
describe only (Bap) as quantum-mechanical since both are describable with similar 
wave functions. We have, I think, unreasonable convention that we treat the 
quantum-mechanical description and the classical one as being too isolated.
4. If the speed of the interfering particle is slow enough compared with that of 
closing the exit slit, a movement of closing the slit for conversion Fap —> Dv^ 
will be able to start and finish in the middle of TSD, as a realizable process in the 
meaning of Section 2.4. Then, how will the possibly heavy and slow particle 
behave in the unlimitedly long TSD?
According to the uncertainty principle, the classical orbit cannot exist before 
closing the slit. After closing, however, where will the classical orbit start from? Is 
that (a) the point on the classical orbit at the instant, rcl, when the slit will have been 
closed, (b) at the instant, t^ when the particle will arrive at the closed slit 
(rci < ?ar), and (c) at another instant for which such classical descriptions are 
inappropriate? [The above (Bap) with the partially opened slit is essentially 
equivalent to the delayed choice experiment. See Section 5.2.]
4. HYPOTHETICAL MODEL: THE IN-FLIGHT TRANSITION BEFORE
ARRIVAL AT DETECTOR
In short, all the dubieties in Section 3 have come from the main dubiety about 
the abandoned behavior in the unlimitedly long flight time interval TSD of each 
interfering particle passing through the symmetric two-beam interference setup, 
like that of Figure 2a or (Bap) in Figure 5. (Notice that the word behavior is often 
used instead of the conventional word orbit. The behavior includes the motions of 
all possible types: the motion of the coherent channel mentioned in point 1 below, 
that of the incoherent channel, the in-flight transition in point 3 below, the classical 
motion, etc.) Both the probabilistic distribution of final states and the behavior 
in TSD of the interfering particle should not be abandoned.
It is too conventional that we insist on the continuation of the classical orbit 
in the interference phenomenon, but on the other hand it seems too unnatural that 
we consider the behavior of each interfering particle should be abandoned at all 
instants in TSD (except the initial and final instants) according to the Copenhagen 
interpretation. In the middle of both extreme viewpoints, we should search for 
another viewpoint.
Now, as discussed in Section 2.2, it seems natural for us to expect that the

152
Yujiro Koh
longer the TSPL become, the more obscure the two-beam interference fringes 
should become for heavy masses. In other words, the heavier the masses are, the 
steeper declivity the TSPL-V curves should have. A reason for the expectation 
is an assumption that, for heavy masses, the interference will hardly take place 
in far distance from the splitter.
Experimentally, if such setups as those of Figure 3 or (Blong) in Figure 5 can 
be constructed, the above expectation will be able to be tested, and the same 
expectation seems to be explained (or, more correctly, speculated) by use of the 
following series of hypothetical models:
1. The so-called traditional wave-packet reduction for observation cannot 
start until the instant, TSD, when the particle, starting from the splitter or scatterer, 
arrives at the detector. A new type of spontaneous transition would have to occur 
at an instant (« TSD for a heavy particle) from a two-beam coherent state (i.e., 
a coherent channel) to either one of two incoherent single-slit-beam states (i.e., 
two incoherent channels), in order that such dubieties as stated in Section 3 will be 
solved. It would occur at a flight distance, R, from the splitter or scatterer, 
i.e., during the flight of the interfering particle and before its arrival at the 
detector.
2. If superposition of the two split beams which are coherent together is 
possible before the spontaneous transition mentioned in point 1, interference 
between the two beams can occur. If the two beams have a beam separator of TSPL 
longer than R, the superposition and the interference will be impossible and only a 
weighted sum of two single-beam patterns (weight <  the spontaneous transitions 
probability from the coherent channel to each incoherent channel) will be ob­
served on the observation plane.
*
3. For introducing the new type of spontaneous transition, a minimum of 
necessary reformation of the theoretical picture should be tried.
If we temporarily postpone the question of the dynamical details of the 
interaction or of the origin of the new transition, an /^-dependent scattering 
phenomenon about each of the scatterer particles in the splitter may play a role 
essentially equivalent to the splitting. It may be a microscopic and spontaneous 
transition of a completely new type from the outgoing spherical wave to one of the 
final mutually-incoherent plane waves, satisfying the momentum conservation 
laws and taking place at variable R (^ particle speed • TSD). This transition would 
occur probabilistically during the flight of the scattered particle (abbreviated 
as “the in-flight transition,” according to Ref. 7), before the so-called observation 
starts in the detector.
Now, in general, a parallel incident beam of a usual scattering experiment 
or an initial plane wave isolated from its source, maintaining the 4-dimensional 
linear and angular momenta, may be prepared through such an in-flight transition.
4. The in-flight transition would have a lifetime, Tin, as a kind of spontaneous 
decay. Then, it seems natural that we assume the TSPL-V curve has an expression

Are Two-Beam Self-Interferences Mass-Independent?
153
V <x exp(-K x TSPL)
(5) 
K(mass, interaction, etc.) = (particle speed • Tin)-1
Expression (4) is a result obtained from the speculated in-flight transition, but 
not a logical conclusion. It should be regarded as a kind of working hypothesis.
Of course, it is interesting to know what factors k and Tin are dependent upon. 
Let us, however, postpone this problem together with the origin of the new 
transition, as in the beginning of point 3 above. The most important at this stage 
is whether expression (5) can be verified experimentally or not.
As treated in Section 2.1, for reliable measurements of the TSPL-V curves 
the very long machine times are presumed, these being dependent very strongly 
on the magnitudes of k. The work, describing Expression (5) as a kind of working 
hypothesis, means the work of estimation of the machine times.
Reliable methods to estimate k are not yet known. However, all possible 
methods should be attempted, even if only prospectively. A method treated in 
Section 5.1 represents a trial example.
5. THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVES
The hypothesis of the /^-dependent scattering composed of the in-flight Tin 
decay seems to have much circumstantial evidence, but no positive proof at 
present. If the hypothesis is shown to be correct with increasing proof in the 
future, its effects to circumstances will be influential. Such situations may re­
semble those of the Avogadro hypothesis at its beginnings. Although the origin of 
the in-flight transition is not necessarily treated systematically in this chapter, 
emphasis will be laid on future perspectives and any possible theoretical clue 
to estimation of k will be shown as follows.
5.1. Irreversible Microscopic Process
Consider an isolated microscopic system composed of two particles. If each 
particle is scattered by the other and followed by the spontaneous in-flight 
transition with lifetime Tin, it is difficult for us to consider in the expression 
describing the /^-dependent scattering that the direction of their time flow from 
the past to the future can be inverted.
Hence, study of the microscopic process including at least one in-flight 
transition seems to have the same purpose as that of the Microscopic Theory of 
Irreversible Process in Quantum Systems by Prigogine’s Brussels group/12) which 
introduces the irreversibility into the quantum-mechanical process in a sense 
similar to thermodynamics.

154
Yujiro Koh
For example, the in-flight transition may be an example of the microscopic 
irreversible scattering in Prigogine’s sense. He has introduced the new concept, 
the internal time, of the scattered particle. However, Prigogine himself explained it 
as an imperfect concept under calculation. On the other hand, Tin of the in-flight 
transition is only a constituent of a working hypothesis at the present time. It seems 
natural that both imperfect concepts have the same order,(13)
Order(Tin) — Ordor(internal time) 
(6)
We will be able to use relation (6) for estimation of k.
5.2. Effect on EPR and Delayed Choice Experiments
Physical phenomena where the in-flight transitions play dominant roles may 
be common between those just after the decays observed in EPR experiments and 
those just after the scatterings treated in the preceding sections. Then, EPR 
experiments may be realizable, only before the in-flight transition takes place. In 
other words, it seems natural(7) that measurement of the TSPL-V curve is the 
experiment in which we observe “From how long a separation do the scattered and 
scatterer particles become separable, in the sense of the EPR phenomenon, and 
following the real time process after scattering?” k-1 = (TSPL)^^ may be 
interpreted as the upper boundary of TSPL, within which the two particles are 
inseparable or the EPR phenomenon is possible.
Wheeled14) pointed out that the delayed choice experiment mentioned in 1931 
by von Weizsackei415) was the first type of EPR experiment. The problem of the 
dubiety discussed in point 4 of Section 3 is essentially the same as the delayed 
choice problem.
A delayed choice experiment for electrons, using the setup shown in Figure 
lb, will be possible by inserting, into the record TSPL = 52 cm of electrons, an 
adjustable slit as exemplified in (Svp) of Figure 5. However, the delayed choice 
phenomena of electrons in such setup may become difficult for long TSPL » 
52 cm and wide lateral separation » 60 |im. This represents a perspective from 
this chapter, in which a possible restrictive effect on the EPR phenomenon from 
the in-flight transition can be forecasted.
5.3. Are Roles of the Mass “Not Thoroughly Known”?
If it should be generally accepted that the macrophysical laws will be derived 
approximately from the microphysical laws, the existing perspective that the 
derivation will be able to be completed on the basis of the combination of the 
Schrodinger equation, the 'P'P
*
 law, and the wave packet concept and its reduction 
seems to be too optimistic. The reason is that the derivation of the macrophysical 

Ar£ Two-Beam Self-Interferences Mass-Independent?
155
determinism, as a special case of extremely large probability, from the micro­
physical indeterminism on the basis of the above-mentioned combination only 
seems to be hopeless, unless the microphysical indeterminism becomes restricted 
gradually with an increase of the mass.
The in-flight transition may be an example of such a source of restriction. The 
relation of k and Tin in (5) seems to suggest an unknown role of the mass for the in­
flight transition.
We should say that the roles of the mass are not yet thoroughly known, 
spreading from the macroscopic space-time curvature to the microscopic in-flight 
transition. It seems, at least, to be worthy of testing and not irrelevant that we 
search for new methods of estimation of k in relation to unknown roles of the 
mass, as discussed in Section 4.
6. EPISTEMOLOGICAL REMARKS
The motivation for daring to introduce the new in-flight transition into 
quantum evolution (added to the detection process at the end of the scatterer —> 
detector flight time interval TSD which can be unlimitedly long, or approach the 
order of daily life) is to search for compatibility between the probabilistic 
distribution of the scattered particle and its real behavior in the real interval TSD. 
Both will be regarded as experimental data independent of intervention of the 
observer. It is significant for us whether or not such data should be regarded as 
symptoms of the physical realities. This, I think, depends on our personal 
viewpoint of the respective epistemologies. The important point is which view is 
the more advantageous to understand any future physical truth. There is a 
viewpoint which denies the existence of any new truth in the interval TSD. This 
chapter belongs to a viewpoint which permits us to search for the existence of it.
The hypothetical model of the in-flight transition is only phenomenological at 
present; in other words, is supported by circumstantial evidence only. But it would 
be worthwhile searching for some positive proof both experimental and theoreti­
cal. The purposes of this chapter are proposal of the hypothesis and discussion of 
estimation in preparation for its experimental verification.

Note added in proof. Although study of the origin of the in-flight transition is 
postponed in this chapter, some clues to a future theory which will be useful for 
further K-estimation or replace the tentative hypothesis should be searched for. 
Measurement of the TSPL-V curves will be the experimental clue. Another 
theoretical clue may be, I presume, given by Lie-algebraic reconsideration.

CHAPTER 9
Wave Mechanics and Relativity
Georges Lochak and Regis Dutheil
Many papers have already been published concerning de Broglie’s ideas on matter 
waves, including papers by one of us (G.L.) and D. Fargue in an earlier collective 
book devoted to the foundations of wave mechanics/1) One can find, in the latter, 
some important points such as the law of phase accordance, considered by de 
Broglie as his basic idea, the hypothesis of a permanent localization of the particle 
in the wave, upon which de Broglie based his theory of measurement, and the 
attempts to find a nonlinear wave equation which would be able to describe the 
wave-particle dualism in a synthetic way.
In the same papers, the importance of relativity for the development of wave 
mechanics was already strongly emphasized. Nevertheless, we shall come back 
again, with new arguments, to this unique problem in the present chapter, because 
we think, as Louis de Broglie, that relativity is the cornerstone of wave mechanics 
and that every attempt to better understand this theory must be based on it.
It must not be forgotten that, when de Broglie found his famous connection 
between the principles of Maupertuis and Fermat, his approach was purely 
relativistic and historically, it was even the first application of the principle of 
relativistic covariance in quantum mechanics/2) But two years later, in one of his 
famous papers/3) Schrodinger obtained some of the basic formulas of wave 
mechanics (especially wave length and group velocity) making use only of 
classical mechanics. He was especially very satisfied that group velocity could be 
obtained without relativity, contrary to what de Broglie did in his thesis. Later on, 
following Schrodinger, de Broglie himself often introduced, in some of his books, 
these formulas from classical mechanics/4-6) But it was for him only a heuristic 
process which made it possible to shorten an introduction: afterwards, all of his 
fundamental works were based on relativity.

However, many theoreticians seem to consider that despite a historical role 
played in the birth of wave mechanics, relativity has not a crucial importance for 
its foundations. In particular, almost all works about causal interpretation do not 
make use of relativity: among many examples, see for instance Refs. 7-9. de 
Broglie was the only one who always started from Klein-Gordon and Dirac rela­
tivist equations in this kind of work. He considered the Schrodinger equation only 
as an approximation, excepting for the problem of systems of particles.
For these reasons, we would like to show, in this chapter, that relativity is 
really unavoidable when we want to obtain some fundamental formulas of wave 
mechanics.
1. CAN WE REACH WAVE MECHANICS STARTING FROM CLASSICAL 
MECHANICS?
In this section, we shall examine (in a slightly different form) some calcula­
tions of de Broglie and Schrodinger, based on classical mechanics. But first of all, 
we are going to recall briefly one of de Broglie’s initial relativistic reasonings.
Introducing relativity directly he set up a phase four-vector of the wave, 
which he likened to the energy-momentum four-vector of the particle. He used 
Planck’s law:
E = hv
(1)
in order to identify time components vic and Etc of the two four-vectors. From 
this followed, by relativistic covariance, the identity of the space components 1/X 
and p; hence the famous formula of wavelength:
Owing to the identification of the two four-vectors, de Broglie deduced the 
identity of Maupertuis’s and Fermat’s principles and he got the famous group- 
velocity theorem. Note that in the preceding formula, m must be considered as 
the relativistic mass (depending on v).
Now suppose that we ignore relativity. Consequently, we cannot use the above 
reasoning because we cannot introduce the four-vectors and thus we have to 
proceed differently. In this paragraph, we are going to do almost the same thing as 
Schrodinger and de Broglie in Refs. 3-6: we shall start form the identification 
of Maupertuis’s and Fermat’s principles (as Hamilton did, though in a different 
form, which we shall examine at the end of this chapter).
Let us then postulate the identity of the two extremal formulas:
/•B 
fB ds
8J mvds = 8J — = 0
JA 
JA X
(3)

Wave Mechanics and Relativity
159
However, contrary to what Hamilton did, we shall not consider the particle 
and wave descriptions as alternative. In accordance with de Broglie, we assume an 
association between wave and particle within the same physical object. It will be 
understood that we consider only the case of a particular and its wave in the 
vacuum, in the absence of an external field.
The left-hand integral in (3) is taken along the particle’s trajectory and the 
right-hand one along a radius of the associated wave: we postulate, with de 
Broglie, that these two curves coincide. In order that this identity should hold 
for any motion, the two integrants must be identical up to a universal constant, 
which implies de Broglie's formula (2) (now m is a constant because we are in 
classical mechanics).
In saying that, we assume implicitly that the constant of proportionality 
between the two sides of (3) is the Planck constant, but doing so we are only 
anticipating experimental results which prove it, without violating the logic of the 
reasoning.
Let us introduce phase velocity V through the formula
V
X = - 
(4)
V
Identifying (2) and (4) we get
hv
V'=— 
(5)
mv
Since we are in the case of inertial motion, the particle energy is entirely 
kinetic and according to Planck’s law and classical mechanics, we obtain
E = hv = |mv2 
(6)
Introducing (6) in (5), we find a relation between the phase velocity V of the 
wave and particle velocity v:
v = I 
(7)
Oddly enough, this trivial relation is never written. And yet it is interesting 
because it is very different from the de Broglie formula:
c2
V = - 
(8)
v
This is a crucial point to which we shall return. Nevertheless, (7) shows a 
dispersion of phase waves, because according to (6), v becomes a function of 

160

frequency and therefore V too. Now, let us consider the group velocity (7 of this 
wave through Rayleigh’s classical formula:
1 _ J /1\ _ tZ /v\
U ~ ~dv\\) ~ dv\v)
Introducing (5) and (6) in (9), we find
77 = 
= ~tM = ” 
(io)
U hdv vdv v
Consequently,
U = v
(11)
We see that, starting from a purely classical calculation, equivalent to 
Schrodinger’s, we reach a result that de Broglie obtained using relativity: the group 
velocity of waves is equal to the particle velocity. Schrodinger underlined the fact 
that this relation “does not necessarily follow from relativity, but remains valid 
for any conservative system of classical mechanics 
We can see that, remain­
ing in the framework of classical mechanics and wave theory, postulating Planck’s 
law and identifying Maupertuis’s and Fermat’s principles, we obtain:
1. de Broglie’s wavelength (2)
2. A relation between phase velocity of the wave and particle velocity
3. Group velocity (11)
Among these relations, which ones can be experimentally checked? As long 
as we observe only material particles, like electrons, only the wavelength will 
be accessible and for low energies, formula (2), with constant m, holds. But we 
shall not be able to check the formula (11) of group velocity, because experiment 
only gives particle velocity, which does not prove that particle velocity is equal to 
group velocity. Moreover, energy E, phase velocity V, and frequency v still remain 
inaccessible.
We cannot even claim verify Planck’s formula, because E and v might be 
wrong; likewise we cannot check equality (6) since v is measured, but E and v 
are not; and above all we cannot say anything about the relation (7) between phase 
velocity V and particle velocity v. Schrodinger was satisfied to obtain the same 
group velocity as de Broglie, but this result proves nothing about phase velocity. 
We observe also that by measuring X, (4) gives only the ratio V/v: we must 
therefore measure one of these two quantities experimentally in order to deduce 
the other.

Wave Mechanics and Relativity
161
Since neither V nor v is measurable directly for a material particle, let us 
introduce one of de Broglie’s essential ideas which was at the basis of his work: 
wave mechanics must be a unifying theory of matter and light. In fact, his starting 
point was a mechanical theory of the photon and not a wave mechanics of matter.
*
 
Moreover, since Fermat’s principle derives from optics and Maupertuis’s principle 
from mechanics, unifying them involves a synthesis between these two fields of 
science, which we will assume from now on.
Can we apply to light the formulas deduced above? This can be answered 
experimentally because with light, and contrary to material particles, phase and 
group velocity (and even frequency) can be measured. Now these velocities are 
equal in vacuum, which invalidates (7). Besides, if (7) had been correct, it would 
have been known as far back as the 18th century, because the light velocity 
measured by Romer would have been twice the one measured by Bradley: indeed, 
Romer based himself on the occultation of Jupiter’s satellites and measured group 
velocity, whereas Bradley measured phase velocity through astronomic aberra- 
tionJu42) Qf course, the distinction between these two velocities was unknown 
at the time because it was hidden by the equality of results in vacuum: it was 
observed later in refracting media, t To conclude, since (7) is incorrect, we cannot 
start from classical mechanics to find wave mechanics.
2. MINIMAL CONDITIONS OF WAVE-PARTICLE DUALISM: THEY ARE 
INCOMPATIBLE WITH CLASSICAL MECHANICS AND REQUIRE 
RELATIVITY
Let us now leave classical mechanics, but without introducing relativity yet. 
Still remaining within inertial motion, let us define wave-particle dualism with 
the following postulates:
1. Identity (3) of Maupertuis’s and Fermat’s principles
2. Planck’s law (1)
3. Equality (11) between group velocity of waves and corpuscle velocity
4. Leaving classical mechanics and consequently (6), we replace it by the 
following general formula (in which we recall Planck’s law already 
postulated):
♦This means that, for de Broglie, the photon is an ordinary particle. Its mass is nonzero but only very 
small. Remember that the masslessness of the photon is not a physical fact but only a theoretical 
consequence of the principle of gauge invariance. Experiment cannot prove that a mass is zero but can 
only give an upper bound for it, which is the case for the photon.
tRecall that all of the methods that rely on the measurement of a light signal give the group velocity 
(Fizeau’s cogwheel, Kerr’s cell, Foucault’s rotating mirror, Michelson’s interferometer). Besides 
astronomical aberration, phase velocity appears in the refraction index and in the ratio of the electric 
and magnetic units/13) It can also be measured in electromagnetic resonant cavities/11)

E = hv = m(y)F(y)
(12)
Here v is the particle velocity. Thus, we only suppose that energy is 
proportional to mass, but we suppose that the latter—and the unknown factor F— 
may be dependent on velocity. Observe that in a homogeneous space and in the 
absence of field, if mass is not a constant it can only depend on v.
Let us underline that postulates 1 and 3 which describe the essential part of 
wave-particle dualism were, in de Broglie’s work, theorems that were deduced 
from relativity. But it cannot be the case here, because relativity is not yet included 
in our hypotheses. However, we will see that relativity is the only possible 
mechanics, provided an essential condition, without which we could not calculate 
the functions m(y) and F(v), is fulfilled: the principle of invariance of light ve­
locity in vacuum.
One could assert that this principle is not a relativist postulate but an 
independent physical fact deduced, for instance, from the observation of double 
stars, as was shown by De Sitter. All the same, this is the principle which paved 
the way for relativity.
According to the previous paragraph we know that the first two postulates we 
introduced lead to de Broglie’s wavelength (2) and to the relation (5) we shall need.
Taking into account postulates 1 and 3 and using (12), we introduce (1) and 
(11) in Rayleigh’s formula (9). Hence:
1 = — = A /I") = d(jnv^ = d(jnv^
v 
U dv\\J d(hv) d(mF) 
( }
from which we find a first equation between the unknown function m(v) and F(y)
d(mF) _ d(mv) 
dv V dv
(14)
Notice that if we supposed mass was not dependent on v, we would find:
m = Cnt => — = v => F = |v2 
dv
(15)
and we would come back to the case of classical mechanics, which we excluded 
earlier. Therefore, we will admit that m(y) is really a function of v.
Let Ro be a reference frame where the particle is at rest and R a reference 
frame with velocity v with respect to Ro. Space and time are denoted (x0, r0) 
in Ro and (x9f) in R. Consider a stationary wave in RQ:
T = exp2z'7rvoro 
(16)

Wave Mechanics and Relativity
163
With respect to R, it will be a propagating wave with a phase velocity V and a 
frequency v:
v|i = exp 2itw> ( r - — 1
(17)
V is given by (5) which, taking account of (12), yields:
v = F- 
V
(18)
Insert this formula in (17) and identify (16) and (17). This gives us the 
following transformation law for the time variable:
_ m(y)F(y) f 
vx \
'° “ /IVO V *W/
(19)
In order to find the space transformation, imagine a light signal which travels 
along the interval (x0, r0) in RQ and the corresponding interval (x, t) in R. The 
velocity of light being the same in both reference frames (this is where the 
postulate interferes), the time necessary to cover the distance will be equal to
x 
x
tQ = in Rq and t =- in R
(20)
Inserting (20) in (19), we get the law of space transformation:
m(y)F(y) / vc2t\
x° 
hv0 V F(v>)
(21)
It is easily seen that the transformations (19) and (21) form a group and that 
their composition law implies the following composition law of velocities which 
already looks like the relativistic one:
v" _ v/F(v) + v'/F(v') 
F(y") ~ 1 + [vv'c2/F(v)F(v")]
(22)
As v is the translation velocity of reference frame R with respect to the 
reference frame 7?0, if we compose two transformations of opposite velocities v 
and v' = — v, we should obtain the unit transformation (with zero velocity); this 
implies that the function F(y) is even, because:
V 
v' 
V 
V 
n 
.
fz x + rz 'X = r-z x cz x = 0 from which F(v) = F( v)
F(y) 
F(y) F(y) 
F(—v)
(23)

164
Georges Lochak and Regis Dutheil
(25)
Then, inverting transformations (19) and (21), we find
1 
/n(v)F(v) 1 - (v2c2/F2) \ 0 F(v)J’
_ hvo 1 
/+
m(v)F(v) 1 - (y2c2/F2) \ 0 F(y) J
These inverse formulas should coincide with those which obtained by 
changing v in -v in (19) and (21); as F(v) is even, this gives a second equation 
between m(v) and F(v):
m(y)F(y) __ hvQ 1 
hvQ m(v)F(v) 1 — (v2c2/F2)
Thus:
m2F2 = h2v^ + m2v2c2
From which follows, taking the derivative:
d(mF) 
d(mv)
mF —-— = czmv—z— 
dv 
dv
And taking account of (14):
F(v) = c2
This entails, in virtue of (18), de Broglie’s relation between phase velocity 
and particle velocity:
Vv = c2 
(29)
According to postulate 3 this is also, by definition, the relation which links 
phase and group velocity.
Then according to (28), the composition law (22) for velocities gives the 
relativistic formula:
(26)
(27)
(28)
v" V + v'
c2 1 + (vv'/c2)
(30)
On the other hand, the general law (12) becomes Einstein’s law:
E = me2
(31)

Wave Mechanics and Relativity
165
If we introduce (28) into (26) we get:
me1 = Vl - (v2/c2)
(32)
From this, using (31) and defining the rest mass by applying Planck’s law in 
the system at rest, there follows the usual relativist dependence of mass with 
respect to velocity:
mm — —z 
=
Vl - (v2/c2)
(33)
Finally, introducing (28) and (32) in (19) and (21), we recover the Lorentz 
transformation:
t - (yxlc2) 
x - vt
tn = —/ 
=; xn = —. ----- = 
(34)
0 Vl - (v2/c2) 0 Vl- (v2/c2)
Let us summarize the argument:
1. We first defined wave-particle dualism through three postulates which 
were nothing else than Planck’s and de Broglie’s laws.
2. We then postulated the proportionality between energy and mass in every 
inertial system.
3. This form admits classical mechanics and relativity as particular cases 
but it could a priori correspond with many conservative dynamics, which 
would be in accordance with de Broglie’s law for the group velocity. But 
we have shown that there are actually only two dynamics compatible with 
all of these four postulates: classical mechanics and relativity. Now the 
theory of light compels us to reject classical mechanics: thus, there 
remains only relativity as de Broglie always asserted.
3. A NOTE ABOUT A REASONING OF HAMILTON
It is well known that Hamilton having defined the surfaces of constant action,
S = Cnt
(35)
noticed that the length of the vector:
p = mv = VS
(36)

166
Georges Lochak and Regis Dutheil
varies as the inverse of the velocity V (i.e., the phase velocity) of the wave front 
defined by (35). Therefore, he called it the vector of normal slowness of the 
front/10’14)
This remark led Hamilton to set
V = | 
(37)
Relation (37) lies at the basis of his analogy between optics and mechanics: 
specifically, the relationship between corpuscular and wave optics.
Of course, in Hamilton’s work group velocity is not mentioned, as the 
concept was unknown at that time. But we shall see that relation (37) which at first 
looks like de Broglie’s relation (8) is in fact inconsistent with Planck’s law and in 
any case could not lead to wave mechanics. Indeed, Hamilton seemed to consider 
(37) as a direct consequence of the identification of principles of Maupertuis and 
Fermat. But this cannot be the case because this would lead to set in (3) and (4):
m = Cnt and v = Cnt 
(38)
Actually, introducing (4) into (3) and eliminating the now superfluous factors 
m and v, the identity of extremal principles could be written under the form:
J
. B 
f*  B 1
av^ = 8Ja-^ = O 
(39)
This equality (which by the way is inhomogeneous) leads indeed to relation 
(37) (which is not homogeneous either). But conditions (38) cannot be accepted 
because:
1. Already in classical mechanics (the Hamilton one) the second equality 
(38) contradicts Planck’s law since it contradicts the equality (6).
2. In relativist mechanics, equalities (38) go against both Planck’s law and 
equivalence of mass and energy.
Therefore, it would be wrong to assert that to derive formula (8) it is enough 
to identify Maupertuis’s and Fermat’s principles. However, we have shown at the 
beginning of this chapter that identification, when properly formulated, leads 
to the wavelength formula. But as we have seen, the true problem is the one of 
phase velocity, which forces us to choose relativity.

CHAPTER 10
Unsharp Particle-Wave Duality 
in Double-Slit Experiments
Peter Mittelstaedt
1. INTRODUCTION
The quantum mechanical double-slit experiment was discussed from an epistemo­
logical point of view in the Bohr-Einstein debate/1) According to Bohr the 
particle-wave duality comes from the fact that the measuring instruments for the 
measurement of a particle (the path) and for the measurement of the wave (the 
interference pattern) are mutually exclusive. This was demonstrated by Bohr for 
many Gedanken experiments by means of the uncertainty relation between 
momentump and position x. The same uncertainty relation can, however, also be 
used to show that in spite of the strict particle-wave duality, the path (momentum 
p) and the interference pattern (position
*)
 can at least be measured simultaneously 
in an approximate sense. This surprising result was first demonstrated by Wootters 
and Zurek(2) within a quantum mechanical reformulation of one of the Gedanken 
experiments discussed by Bohr and Einstein/1)

A more rigorous treatment of unsharp quantum mechanical measurements 
must make use of the general theory of unsharp observables in quantum me­
chanics, which replaces the sharp observables, which can be described by 
projector-valued measures, by effect-valued measures which correspond to un­
sharp observables (see Busch(3)). If in the double-slit experiment the observables 
of the path and the interference pattern are replaced by unsharp observables of this 
kind, unsharp joint measurements of the path (momentum p) and the interference 
pattern (position x) turn out to be possible. Unsharp measurements of this kind 
must not be confused with inaccurate ones since the unsharpness expresses the
169

objective indeterminacy of the path and of the interference pattern, but not the 
observer’s ignorance about these properties.
Several attempts have been made to realize unsharp joint measurements 
experimentally. A photon split-beam experiment has been performed using a 
modified Mach-Zehnder interferometer/4) This experiment provides simul­
taneous unsharp wave and particle knowledge in full agreement with the theoreti­
cal predictions. More sophisticated experiments of this kind were proposed, but 
have not yet been realized/5) Other kinds of experiments which were interpreted in 
the sense of unsharp joint measurements are neutron interference experiments, 
which were performed by several authors/6-8) However, these experiments use a 
slightly different experimental setup which does not allow interpreting them as 
unsharp measurements, but rather as experiments with “unsharp preparation. ” 
This conceptual distinction can also be realized experimentally by extended 
experiments which are briefly discussed here.
2. THE PHOTON SPLIT-BEAM EXPERIMENT
As an illustration of the Bohr-Einstein debate we consider the photon split­
beam experiment shown in Figure 1. In the experimental setup, a Mach-Zehnder 
interferometer, the incoming photon-state |cp) is split by the first beam splitter (BS\
FIGURE 1. Photon split-beam experiment. Beam splitters (BS\ and (BS)2 with transparencies

into two components described by the orthonormal states and |-<B), respec­
tively. The two parts of the split beam are reflected at the two mirrors and M2 
and recombined with a phase difference 8 at the second beam splitter (BS)2. In this 
experiment there are two mutually exclusive measuring arrangements: If the 
photon counters Cp C2 are in the position (C^, Cf), one observes which way (B 
or -«B) the photon came, and if the counters are in the position (CJ, C%), one 
observes the interference pattern, i.e., the intensities which depend on the phase 
difference 8.
This experiment can be described completely within the framework of the 
two-dimensional Hilbert space %C2. The observables are then given by projection 
operators P(B) with eigenstates |B) and 
(for the path) and P(A) with
eigenstates |A) and |-»A) (for the interference pattern). The state |(p) of the 
incoming photon can be decomposed in the B-basis as |<p) = 1/V2(|B) + 
exp (z’8)| —>B)). Hence, the probabilities for the ways B and -*B  are given by p(cp, B) 
= |<cp|B>|2 = 1/2 and p(<p,-nB) = |(<p|->B)|2 = 1/2, respectively. The interference 
observable is given by P(A) with eigenstates |A) = 1/v2(|B) + | ->B)) and | -iA) = 
1/V2(|B) - |-«B)). Hence, the probabilities for A and -A are given by p(<p, A) = 
1/2(1 + cos 8) and p(<p,-A) = 1/2(1 — cos 8), respectively. Obviously the 
observables P(B) and P(A) have a nonvanishing commutator [P(B\ P(A]_ 
= 1/2{|B)(-»B| — | —«B><B|} ¥= 0 and can thus not be measured simultaneously.
Pure and mixed state operators of %C2 can be represented by means of a three­
dimensional unit sphere, the Poincare sphere 2? (Figure 2). By using the Pauli 
operators {fl,CTpCT2,a3} with [or-,a J = and = 28^U, projection 
operators P(X) are given by
P(X = 1/2(X,.CT,. + 11), Xt G R+, Sx? = 1
and mixtures by
W(Y) = l/2(y,.CT,. + U), Yt G R+, Sy? < 1
Here projection operators P(X) are given by unit vectors X or points on the surface 
of 2? and mixed states by vectors Y with |P| < 1 or points in the interior of 2?. 
Projection operators P(X) = |X)(X| and fl - P(X) = P(-^X) = |-»X)(-»X| which 
project onto orthogonal states correspond to diametrical points of the Poincare 
sphere. If the axes of 2? are chosen such that the operator P(B) reads
P(B) = \/2(Bi^i + fl) = 1/2(ct3 + fl)
the operator P(A) of the interference pattern is given by
P(A) = l/2(Aicri + fl) = 1/2(ctj + fl)
and thus P(A) and P(B) correspond to orthogonal vectors A and B.

sphere. Initial preparation P[cp], phase shift 5, path observable interference observable P(A). 
Mixed states W(Z) and WL((p, A) lie in the interior of the sphere.
Mixed states are described by (positive trace one) operators W(Z) and are 
given by W(Z) = l/2(Zfaf. + 11) with vectors |Z| < 1. The spectral decomposition 
then reads
W(Z) = W+(Z)-l/2(fl + Z^.) + W(Z)-1/2(1] - Z.on)
with 2. = Zf/|Z| and eigenvalues
W+(Z) = 1/2(1 + |Z|), W~(Z) = 1/2(1 - |Z|)
which correspond to the probabilities p(W, Z±), i.e., the expectation values of the 
projection operators P(±t) = 1/2(11 ± Z o-.). In the Poincare sphere SP the operator 
W(Z) lies on the diameter given by P(+Z) and P(—Z) and has the distance |Z| from 
the origin of the sphere (Figure 2). Mixed states are of particular importance for the 
description of the measuring process.
For a given preparation P[cp] = 1/2(<p/ct/ + 11) this sharp measurement of an

173
observable P(A) = \l2tAp- 4- U) in the sense of von Neumann and Liiders consists 
of two steps (I) and (II)
P[<p]^WL(<p,A)^P(A)
Step (I), the objectification, transforms the preparation P[<p] into the Liiders 
mixture
WL(<p, A) = p(<p, A)P(A) + p(<p, -A)P(-A)
whereas step (II) merely reduces the observer’s subjective ignorance by reading 
the final result P(A), say, of the measuring process. For the above-mentioned 
preparation |<p) = 1/2(|B) 4- exp(/8)|-iB)) one obtains either the mixture
WL(<p,B) = 1/2P(B) 4- 1/2P(-B)
by measuring the path or the mixture
WL(<p, A) = 1/2(1 4- cos<p)P(A) 4- 1/2(1 - coscp)P(-A)
by measuring the interference pattern.
In the Poincare sphere the mixed states W£(<p, B) and W£(<p, A.) are obtained 
geometrically by orthogonal projections of the vector cp onto the radius vectors 
B and A, respectively. For a given angle 8 s.t. 8 = arccos^-A the probabilities for 
P(A) and P(-iA) are p(<p, A) = 1/2(1 4- cos 8) and p(<p, -«A) = 1/2(1 — cos 8), 
respectively (Figure 2).
3. THE UNSHARP MEASURING PROCESS
In contrast to the sharp first kind measurement described above, the final 
result of an unsharp measurement is not a projection operator P E 2?(9^) but an 
effect operator E E ^(36). Effects are selfadjoint operators E, the spectrum Ex 
of which lies within the interval [0,1]. In the two-dimensional Hilbert space 9€2 
effects are given by operators of the kind
Ea = a/2(\o-(. + fl), Sx? =£ 1, 0 a =£ 2/(1 + |X|)
For the sake of simplicity we will restrict the discussion here to the special case 
a = 1. These special effect operators
E = 1/2(X,.ct,. + fl), Sx? « 1
correspond to points in the interior of the Poincare sphere, and are formally 

174
Peter Mittelstaedt
equivalent to mixture operators W. To any effect there exists a counter effect E 
which is given by
E = U - E = 1/2(1] -X-az.)
The spectral decomposition of an effect E(X) of this kind reads
E = 1/2(X-ct + U) = 1/2(1 + |X|)P(X) + 1/2(1 - |X|)P(-X)
with projection operators
P(±X) = 1/2(1 ± X,.CT,./|X|)
The eigenvalues have the interpretation
E+ = 1/2(1 + |X|) > 1/2—reality degree of property P(X)
E~ = 1/2(1 - |X|) < 1/2—unsharpness of property P(X)
where we have assumed that E+ > 1/2 and E~ < 1/2.
By means of these considerations we are now prepared to describe the 
unsharp measuring process. An unsharp measurement of the observable P(A) 
= 1/2(1 + Azctz) leads to the effect
E(A,Xa) = 1/2(XaA,.ct/ + 1), S(XaA,.)2 « 1
as the final result of the measuring process. The eigenvalues E±(A,\a) of E(A,\a)9 
which follow from the spectral decomposition
E(A,\a) = 1/2(1 +Xa)1/2(H + A.az) + 1/2(1 - XA)1/2(U - ApJ
are
E+(A,Xa) = 1/2(1 + XA) > 1/2—reality degree of P(A)
E“(A,Xa) = 1/2(1 — XA < 1/2—unsharpness of P(A)
and describe the degree of reality or the unsharpness of the observable P(A).
In the two-dimensional Hilbert space the special effects E = l/2(Xza. + U) 
with Sx? 1 are equivalent to mixture operators, i.e., positive trace one 
operators. This accidental equivalence allows for a very simple illustration of the 
unsharp measuring process. Starting from the preparation P[cp] an observable P(C) 
= l/2(C-cr. + D) with CZAZ- = XA and Cz(cp X A)z- = 0 (Figure 3) is measured sharply 
with the result P(C), say. The knowledge of P(C) then provides the knowledge of 
the effect E(A,Xa) for the following reason: If starting from the preparation P(C)

Unsharp Particle-Wave Duality
175
FIGURE 3. Unsharp measuring process P(A) with preparation P[<p]. The vector (? lies in the plane 
spanned by the vector $ and A.
one would measure P(A) without reading, then one would obtain with certainty the 
Liiders mixture
WL(C, A) = p(C, A)P(A) + p(C, -A)P(-A)
with p(C, A) = 1/2(1 + XA) and p(C, -iA) = 1/2(1 - XA), which is equivalent to 
the effect E(A,Xa).
It is obvious that there are infinitely many projection operators P(C') with 
C,iAi = XA such that C' is not in the plane spanned by <p and A. However, these 
projection operators P(C') have a larger distance from P[<p] than P(C) and 
consequently the system with the preparation P[(p] is stronger “demolished” by 
a P(C')-measurement than by a P(C)—measurement. Since the result, the effect 
E(A,Xa), is the same for all projection operators P(C'), the measurement of P(C) 
with C.(<p x A)i = 0 corresponds to the “minimal demolishing measurement” 
of the effect E(A,Xa).
For the unsharp joint measurement of two observables (projection operators 
P(A) and P(B)) we consider the two effects
E(A,Xa) = 1/2(XaA1ct|. + D) with X (XaA,.)2 « 1
E(B,XS) = 1/2(XbBi.ct1. + B) with X (Xfi5,)2 « 1

and with eigenvalues E(A,kA) and E(B9Xb), respectively. Two arbitrary observ­
ables and M2 are called coexistent, if the ranges on the M. are contained in the 
range of one joint observable M. For the unsharp observables E(A,kA) and E(B,Xb) 
this means that these two effects are coexistent iff
1/2|XaA + X^ + 1/2|XaA - X^| 
1
If in particular A-B = 0, this condition reads X^ + X| 1.
The special observables P(A)—(of the interference pattern) and P(B)—(of 
the path) fulfill the relation A-B = 0. Moreover, we consider here the limiting case 
of maximal coexistence X^ + X| = 1. The corresponding effects E(A, XA) and 
E(B, XB) can then be estimated jointly by the ideal Liiders measurements of 
an observable
P(C) = l/icq.ff,. + fl) With Sc? = 1
which fulfills the two conditions = XA and CiBi = \B. The observables P(C) 
with C-A = XA lie on a circle CA and those with CB = XB on a circle CB. From the 
geometry of the Poincare sphere (see Figure 4) it is obvious that for values XA and 
XB with X^ + Xj = 1 there is exactly one observable P(C) for which both conditions 
are fulfilled. However, since C is neither in the plane spanned by <p and A nor in the
FIGURE 4. Poincard sphere descrip­
tion of an unsharp joint measurement 
of the observables P(A) and P(A) by 
means of an intermediate observable

plane spanned by <p and B, the joint measurement of A and B does not correspond 
to minimal demolishing measurement of both effects £(A, XA) and E(B, XB).
4. INFORMATION THEORETICAL CONSIDERATIONS
In the case of a sharp measurement the observer knows either the eigenvalue 
of the path observable or the eigenvalue of the interference observable. Unsharp 
measurements provide unsharp knowledge about the path and the interference 
pattern. It is useful to describe these different situations by means of information 
theory. For a preparation W = P[<p] the deficiency of information about the result 
of a sharp measurement of the observable P(A) can be expressed by the formula
J7(cp, A) = —p(<p, A)lnp)<p, A) - p(cp, -«A)lnp((p, -»A) ln2
where p(<p, A) and p(<p, ~vl) are the probabilities of obtaining P(A) and P(~
*A)
 as 
measuring results. Conversely the (normalized) knowledge about the wave prop­
erty P(A) of a system with preparation P[(p] is given by W = 1 - #(cp, A)/ln2.
Here we consider preparations W = P[<p] which correspond to a pure state |<p) 
and observables which are not degenerate. Then the deficiency of information 
Z/(cp, A) about the result of an ideal first kind measurement of P(A) agrees with 
the von Neumann entropy of the Liiders mixture
WL(<p, A) = p(<p, A)P(A) + p(<p, -A)P(-A)
which is obtained in step (I)—the objectification—of the measuring process, 
i.e., we have
77(<p, A) = Tr(WLlnWL) =: H(WL(<p, A))
where we have denoted the entropy of the mixture WL by H(WL). Hence, the 
deficiency of information Z/(cp, A) about the property A an be interpreted as the 
observer’s subjective ignorance about A in the Liiders-Gemenge which is de­
scribed by the mixture WL(q>9 A).
The result of an unsharp measurement of P(A) with the unsharpness 
1/2(1 — XA) is given by the effect B(A,Xa). The gain of information, which is 
achieved by measuring the effect B(A,Xa) on a system with preparation <p should 
be determined by its minimal demolishing measurement, i.e., by the measurement 
of the projection operator P(C), which in addition to C*A
 = XA also fulfills the 
condition C.-(<p x A). = 0. The deficiency of information #(<P, C) about the 
property C in the state <p is then given by
ZZ(cp, C) = ~p(<p, C)lnp(<p, C) - p(cp, -iC)lnp((p, -«C)

with (see Figure 3)
p(<p, C) = 1/2(1 + cos (8 — 8')), cos 8' = XA
= 1/2(1 + \jcos8 + V(1 - X;psin8) =: p(<p; A, XJ
Hence, we write H(<p, C) = H(cp; A, XA) for the gain of information which is 
achieved by measuring the effect E(A, XA).
Since the deficiency of information H(<p, C') for a projection operator P(C') 
with C'-A = XA is a monotonically increasing function of the distance d(cp, C') = 
arccos (<p-C') between P[cp] and P(C'), and since the relation d(cp, C) d(<p, C') 
holds for any C' of this kind, we obtain //(cp, C) 77((p, C'). Hence, the defi­
ciency of information H(cp; A, XA) = 7/(cp, C) is smaller than the value of any 
other P(C'), which provides the same knowledge about the effect E(A, XA).
The remaining deficiency of information about the eigenvalue of P(A) in 
the state P(C) is then given by
H(C, A) = -p(C, A)lnp(C, A) - p(C, -A)lnp(C, -A)
with p(C, A) = 1/2(1 + cos 8') = 1/2(1 + XA). This deficiency of information 
H(C, A) is equal to the entropy of the Liiders mixture
WL(C, A) = p(C, A)P(A) + p(C, -.A)P(-A)
which is generated by the first step of the measuring process, i.e., we have H(C, A) 
= H(WL(C, A)).
Since in the present case the probabilities read
p(C, A) = 1/2(1 + XA) and p(C, --A) = 1/2(1 - XA)
the mixture WL(C, A) agrees with the effect E(A, XA). Hence, the remaining 
deficiency of information about the value of P(A) after the measurement of P(C) is 
given by the entropy H(E(A, XA)) of the effect, which is considered to be the result 
of the 1/2(1 — XA)—unsharp measuring process of P(A). Hence, we obtain the 
result
H{C, A) = H(WL(C, A)) = H(E(A, XA))
The special observables P(A)—(interference pattern) and P(B)—(path) 
fulfill the condition A'B = 0. We will consider here again the case of maximal 
coexistence X^ + Xj = 1. The gain of information which is achieved by a joint 
measurement of the effects E(A, XA) and E(B, XB) is then given by the deficiency 
of information about the observable P(C), the eigenstate of which provides the 
simultaneous knowledge of both effects, i.e., by

where on account of 2 Vy(l —y) = XA (Figure 4) we have

5. REALIZATION OF THE UNSHARP JOINT MEASUREMENT OF P(A) 
AND P(B)
According to the previous discussion for an unsharp joint measurement of the 
particle property—given by P(B) and the wave property—given by P(A), one has 
to perform a sharp measurement of an intermediate observable P(C). In the photon 
split-beam experiment of Figure 1 this can be achieved by the following modifica­
tion of the experimental setup: Whereas the transparency p of the first beam 
splitter (BS\ still has the value p = i, the transparency y of the beam recombiner 
(BS)2 is chosen such that y is variable, i.e., 0 y < 1. Each value of y determines 
an observable P(C(y)), which is measured sharply with the apparatus. In particu­
lar, for the value y = 0 one would measure which way the photon came, i.e., one 
would measure the observable P(C(0)) = P(B). If y = 1, one measures the 
interference pattern, i.e., the observable P(C(l/2)) = P(A). In the general case 
(0 y 1), one measures the observable
P(C(7)) = (7 - V7(l - 7)) A + 2V(7(1 - 7)P(A) + |1 - 27|P(B)
which—in the Poincare sphere representation of Figure 4—lies on the meridian 
circle between P(A) and P(B). The components of P(C) in the direction of P(A) 
and P(A) are 2Vy(l — y) and |1 — 2y|, respectively. If one identifies these 
components with the parameters XA and XB, i.e., if one puts XA = 2Vy(l - y) 
and XB = |1 — 2y|, then they determine the eigenvalues
E±(A, XA) = 1/2(1 ± XA) and E±(B, XB) = 1/2(1 ± XB)
of the effects E(A, XA) and E(B, XB), respectively (Figure 4). Obviously the 
condition X^ + Xj = 1 of maximal coexistence is fulfilled here.
The visibility of the interference pattern depends on y and is given here 
by 5(y) = 2Vy(l — y). It reaches its maximum for y = 1/2 (when we do not know 
anything about the photon’s path) and vanishes for y = 0 and y = 1 (when we know 
which way the photon came). On account of S(y) = XA the visibility is related 
to the reality degree E+(A, XA) of the interference observable P(A) by
E+(A, XA) = 1/2(1 + X4) = 1/2(1 + S(7)) = 1/2(1 + 2V7(1 - 7))

180
Peter Mittelstaedt
In a similar way for the reality degree E+(B, XB) of the path observable P(B) one 
obtains
£+(B, XB) = 1/2(1 + XB) = 1/2(1 + |1 - 2X|)
An experimental arrangement with the transparency y of the second mirror and the 
visibility S(y) provides some information about the photon’s particle and wave 
character. The corresponding formula for the deficiencies of information H(y, A) 
and H(y, B) about further measurements of P(A) and P(B) in an eigenstate 
|C(y)) of P(C(y)) are then given<2’4> by
H(y, A) = ~~p(y, A)lnp(y, A) — p(y, -iA)\np(y, -A)
H(y9 B) = -p(y, B)lnp(y, B) - p(y, -B)lnp(y, ->B)
where p(y, A) and p(y, B) are the probabilities of measuring P(A) and P(B), 
respectively, with the preparation P(C(y)). These probabilities read
p(y, A) = 1/2(1 + 2V7(1 - 7)) = 1/2(1 + XJ = E+(A, XA)
p(y, B) = 1/2(1 + |1 - 27|) = 1/2(1 + Xfi) = E+(B, XB)
and agree with the reality degrees of P(A) and P(B). For the deficiencies of 
information one thus obtains
H(y, A) = -1/2(1 + S(y)) In 1/2(1 + S(y)) - 1/2(1 - S(y)) In 1/2(1 - S(y))
H(y, B) = -ylny - (1 - y)ln(l — y)
Conversely, one can express the wave character and the particle character of a 
system in the state |C(y)) by the (normalized) knowledge W(y) = 1 - H(y, A)/ln 2 
about the wave property and the knowledge P(y) = 1 — H(y, B)/ln2 about the 
particle property. The particle property (P(y) and the wave property W(y) are 
plotted against the visibility S(y) in Figure 5.
For the realization of the described experiment, 18 different transparency 
values y for the beam recombiner (BS)2 were used. The preparation |<p(8)) = 
1/2(|B) + exp{z
*8)|-iB))
 depends on the phase 8 which was varied continuously. 
The intensities
/+(8, 7) = |(<P(S)|C(7)>|2, Z-(8, 7) = |<<p(8)hC(7»l2
which are measured in the counters C1 and C2, respectively, are then given by
^(8, 7) = 1/2(1 ± 2V7(1 - 7) cos 8)

Unsharp Particle-Wave Duality

FIGURE 5. Particle property P(y) and wave property W(y) are plotted against the visibility S(y).
As an illustration of the experimental results, we consider two alternative situa­
tions which correspond to almost sharp measurements of the particle and the wave 
property (Figure 6; for further details see Mittelstaedt et al Sty.
l .y! = 0.492: here we have W(yj) = 99.98% wave property and PtyJ 
= 0.02% particle property. The measured visibility agrees with the 
theoretical value SCyj) = 0.992 and corresponds to a very significant 
interference pattern.
2 . y2 ~ 0.994: here we have only W(y2) = 18%  wave property and P(y2) 
= 98.2% particle property. Even in this extreme case the measured 
visibility S(y2) = 0.145 which agrees with the theoretical value is still 
sufficient for a significant interference pattern.
*
These results demonstrate in a very convincing way that the measurement of 
the observable C(y) provides an unsharp simultaneous knowledge of the photon’s 
particle property as well as of its wave property. In accordance with previous 
theoretical expectations/2) it follows that even if the path of the photon is known 
to a degree of 98.2% its wave character still manifests itself in a surprisingly 
significant interference pattern.
It should be mentioned that the present photon split-beam experiment is not 
yet a proper realization of the theory of the unsharp measuring process. It has been 
pointed out by Busch(5) that only the extended experiment of Figure 7 with four 
outcomes (in the counters C\, C2 and , D2) would provide a complete description

distinct instruments for measuring unsharply the path P(B) and the interference 
observable P(A), respectively. Moreover, for k #= X the entire measuring instru­
ment is statistically complete, i.e., the statistics of the four outcomes also provide 
complete information about the initial preparation |cp(P, 5)) of the system which 
depends on the transparency (3 of the first beam splitter and of the phase 8.

6. NEUTRON INTERFERENCE EXPERIMENTS
Another attempt to realize unsharp joint measurements of wave and particle 
properties are neutron interference experiments which were performed and dis­
cussed by Rauch and Summhammer/6) Zeilinger/7 *
) Greenberger and YaSin,and 
Rauch/9) These experiments use a slightly different experimental setup (Figure 8). 
The incident beam is again split into beams B and but in one of the beams, 
say B, an absorber is introduced which partially absorbs this beam. As an absorber 
of this kind, one could use another partly transparent mirror with transparency a 
< 1. In this way the intensity of the path B can be arbitrarily reduced, whereas the 
-*B intensity remains unchanged.
Since in this experimental setup the normalization of the incident beam is 
destroyed by absorption, for the theoretical discussion we replace the absorbing 
mirror by a beam splitter with variable transparency £. The incoming beam can 
then be decomposed as
I<p(3, 8)> = Vl - p|B> + Vpexp(i8)hB>
If with this preparation the observable P(A) of the interference pattern is meas­
ured, one obtains the probabilities

p(<p, A) = 1/2(1 + Vp(l - p)cos8), 
p(<p, -.A) = 1/2(1 - 2Vp(l - p)cos8)
These expressions describe the probabilities for A and -«A if the system has the 
preparation |cp(P)>. The ignorance about the path P(B) is then given by
#(<p(P), B) = -(1 - p)In(1 - p) - pinp
In a situation with a preparation |<p(P)) which corresponds to 98.0% particle 
property P(B) = 1 - 7/(<p(P), B)/ln 2, say, the remaining 2% wave property can be 
shown to still provide a significant interference pattern/8) These intuitively 
surprising experiments confirm the theoretical predictions. However, they can­
not be interpreted as unsharp joint measurements of the wave and particle 
properties A and B.
In order to discus the difference between the neutron interference experiment 
with (P =# i, y = i) and the unsharp joint measuring process with (P = 1, y #= 1) 
described above we must distinguish two different parts in the experimental

arrangement of Figure 8: the preparation and the measuring instrument. In the 
neutron experiments the initial state |<p(P, 8)) is prepared with £ =# 1 (denoted here 
as “unsharp preparation”) and lies on the meridian circle of the Poincare sphere 
(Figure 4) between P[cp] and P(B). In the measuring part of the experimental setup 
one uses a beam recombiner with y = I and thus measures P(A). The mixture 
which is obtained by this measuring process is given by
WL(<p(0), A) = p(<p(P), A)P(A) + p(<p(P), -A)P(-A)
with eigenvalues p(cp(P), A) and p(cp(P), -»A) which describe the relative frequen­
cies of events in the counters C{ and C2. Hence, the final result of this measuring 
process is either in the state P(A) or in the state P(-»A), but nothing is known about 
the particle property P(B).
In contrast to this experiment, the unsharp joint measuring process starts with 
preparation P[<p] and measures the observable P(C(y)) with y #= J. The mixture 
which is obtained in this measuring process reads
C(y)) = p(cp, C(y))P(C) + p(y, -C(y))P(-C(y))
with eigenvalues p(cp, C(y)) and p(<p, -«C(y)) which describe again the relative 
frequencies of events in the counters Cr and C2. However, the final result of the 
measuring process is the state P(C) or the state P(->C), both of which provide a 
simultaneous knowledge about the wave property P(A) and the particle property 
P(B).
It is obvious that for a preparation P(cp(P)) with £ = y the probabilities
p(<p(p), A) = 1/2(1 + 2Vp(l - 3) cos 8)
and
p(<p, C(-y)) = 1/2(1 + 2V-y(l - -y)cos8)
are equal. This means that the mixtures WJ<p(p), A) and WL(<p, C(y)) have the 
same eigenvalues and lead to the same counting rates in the counters C{ and C2. 
Hence, the two conceptually different situations of unsharp preparation (£ #= 1/2, 
y = 1/2) and unsharp measurement (P = 1/2, y ¥= 1/2) seem to be indistinguish­
able from an experimental point of view. This is, however, not the case. The two 
mixed states W£(<p(£), A) and WL(cp, C(y)) can be distinguished by the expectation 
values of any observable which is not commensurable with P(A) and P(C(y)), 
e.g., by the observable P(B). If we write for the probabilities
P+ : = p((p, C(y)) = p(<p(P), A)

186
Peter Mittelstaedt
p~ : = p(<p, ->C(y)) = p(<p(P), ->A)
one obtains
TrO^GpflJ), = p+1/2(1 + cos 8) + p-1/2(1 - cos 8)
Tr(WL(<p, C(7))P(B)) = p+(l - 7) + p~y
and these expectation values are obviously different. The two cases of unsharp 
preparation and unsharp measurement could also be distinguished by the extended 
split-beam experiment proposed by Busch/5)

CHAPTER 11
Some Arguments against 
the Existence of de Broglie Waves
Wolfgang Muckenheim
1. DISTINGUISHING SCHRODINGER’S FROM DE BROGLIE’S WAVES
The degree of physical reality to be attributed to Schrodinger’s wave function 
depends strongly on the degree of philosophical realism the “observer” is 
endowed with. The corresponding opinions span a wide range. The pure realist 
considers an electron as just a small particle, with the wave function being only a 
mathematical construct in his mind. The pure instrumentalist, on the other hand, 
refuses to talk about such notions as “reality” but accepts the wave function as the 
only entity corresponding to his idea of an electron (because a small particle would 
possess definite position and momentum). Of course, there are many epistemo­
logical niches between these extreme positions. However, if we dare to talk about 
an observer-independent reality (as we wish to do in this chapter), then we cannot 
accept Schrodinger’s wave function as a part of this reality because its shape 
depends on our knowledge, changing (i.e., collapsing instantaneously) with every 
additional bit of information we accumulate.
*
This feature of the wave function, which makes realists reluctant to add it to 
the inventory of their world, is just supplying that flexibility which is required to 
prevent quantum theory from internal contradictions and paradoxes.
*To give an example, the only wave function appropriate to describe a neutron emitted by a nucleus is a 
spherical wave. The additional knowledge (gained by a nondemolition measurement) that the neutron 
propagates close to a fixed direction leads to a plane wave. If further the decay time can be approxi­
mated (e.g., by detecting the recoiling nucleus) we have to construct a Gaussian wave packet. All these 
constructs describe one and the same neutron which has not suffered any physical interaction and 
which, after all, can be detected as a tiny particle with fixed mass and spin.

This advantage is not shared by a different entity which, as a special structure 
of reality that can be described in terms of a formalism developed for waves, is a 
genuine part of reality. This structure has been known for a long time in the case of 
light, and it was predicted by de Broglie to apply to material particles too. Various 
experiments, starting with Young’s double slit via Davisson-Germer’s electron inter­
ferences to recent interference experiments involving neutrons and heavier parti­
cles, have proven the reality of these wave structures by presenting evidence in the 
form of distinct interference structures which could never be generated by ambig­
uous mathematical constructs existing merely in the brains of the experimenters.
2. DE BROGLIE’S INITIAL CONCEPT OF DE BROGLIE WAVES
For more than 50 years, de Broglie’s initial ideas have been discussed and 
modified, with the unfortunate result that, today, it is not at all clear what we 
should understand by de Broglie waves, also called matter waves, empty waves, 
pilot waves, or phase waves. It is not necessary for our purposes to exhaustively 
discuss all features contained in the original concept
*
 but we need to clarify some 
essential points to supply a common basis for the subsequent discussion. In order 
to remain as authentic as possible, we quote a few original statements.
After pointing out that there is a significant difference to Schrodinger’s 
statistical wave function, de Broglie states that his wave “has a very low amplitude 
and does not carry energy, at least not in a noticeable manner. The particle is a 
very small zone of highly concentrated energy incorporated in the wave, in which 
it constitutes a sort of generally mobile singularity. ”(2) “Only its phase, related 
directly to the motion of the particle, seemed to me of fundamental signifi­
cance. . . 
. we think that in wave mechanics one must introduce precise
hidden parameters, which are the positions and velocities of the corpus­
cles. . . . ”(4) “On congoit alors 1’onde continue comme guidant le mouvement de 
la particule. C’est une onde pilote.”t<5> The reality attached by de Broglie to his 
wave becomes particularly evident by the following gedankenexperiment, set up 
to derive Bohr’s postulate. “Passons maintenant au cas d’un electron decrivant 
d’une vitesse uniforme sensiblement inferieur a c une trajectoire fermee. Au 
temps t = 0, le mobile est en un point O. L’onde Active associee, partant alors de O 
et decrivant toute la trajectoire avec la vitesse c/p, rattrape 1’electron au temps t en 
un point O' tel que 00' = Pct.”$<6> There is scarcely any statement which more
♦The interested reader is referred to a brief but competent review by de Broglie’s former assistant 
G. Lochak.U)
tThe continuous wave is considered as guiding the motion of the particle. It is a pilot wave. 
tLet us consider now the case of an electron which describes a closed loop at a constant velocity 
significantly lower than c. At time t = 0 the electron is at point O. The fictitious wave associated with 
the electron starts at O and describes the same loop with the velocity c/p, overtaking the electron at 
time t at a point O' with OO' = per.

eloquently can underline the reality of this wave, propagating with phase velocity 
c/p, overtaking the particle and interacting with it.
Hence, we have to deal with a real wave without (measurable) energy or 
momentum, which is connected to the particle by
E = me2 = hv 
(1)
p — mv = h/K 
(2)
with E and p energy and momentum of the particle, respectively. The particle’s 
velocity (in free space)
v = dEIdp = dV(m0c2)2 + (pc)2/dp = p/m 
(3)
is equal to the wave’s group velocity
v = dv/d(l/\) 
(4)
The phase velocity, given by
V = Xv = c2/v 
(5)
is always larger than the speed of light for particles with nonvanishing rest 
mass m0.
As mentioned above, there is overwhelming experimental evidence showing 
that certain parts of reality behave in a way that can be described by assuming the 
existence of de Broglie waves. The big question is, does it really make sense to 
assume the existence of such waves? And, if so, what is the oscillating medium? In 
particular, is this medium present everywhere and always (similar to the pre- 
relativistic ether) or does it emerge and vanish out of nothing into nothing (like the 
visual impression of a vapor trail), being created continuously by every particle?
3. DISCUSSION OF MODELS
If we prefer to stick to the opinion that reality consists of small particles 
which are guided by waves, we seem to have only the two models mentioned 
above. (This is dictated by the tertium non datur too: Either the undulatory 
medium is a permanent one or it is not.)
Let us for a moment assume the latter case. Then the medium of de Broglie 
waves has to be void of energy, because it is continuously created by particles 
which do not lose energy. The idea of something possessing nothing but “reality” 
but nevertheless influencing a particle by “guiding” it, is very hard to accept. 
Moreover, applying it to de Broglie’s derivation of Bohr’s postulate, we are forced 
to assume a wave-front propagation (or propagation of any part of the wave) with 

190
Wolfgang Muckenheim
superluminal velocity V. If, further, the empty wave created by this process can 
influence a particle’s motion or act in any other physically detectable way, this 
entails the possibility of sending signals with superluminal velocity. Hence, there 
would be a contradiction to special relativity. (If the wave cannot act in any 
physically detectable way, we need not further talk about it at all.) This verdict is 
strong enough to drop the “vapor trail” model. Consequently, the negative result 
of an experiment to detect the empty wave of a bunch of photons/7) though not 
conclusive/8’9) agrees with our conclusion.
The alternative to the vapor trail model is that of a permanent medium, i.e., 
the ether. But regardless of the problems which that notion raises in connection 
with questions concerning the isotropy of space independent of the state of the 
particle’s motion, the same argument as given above holds also in this case. If a 
wave can “overtake” a particle in circular motion by propagating with superlumi­
nal velocity, and if this wave can act in a physical way, then we have the same 
contradiction with special relativity.
Hence, we can conclude that de Broglie’s example/6) fails. In order to save the 
existence of de Broglie waves, one can take the view<8) that the Fourier components 
form a wave packet such that outside a small bounded region the components 
cancel to zero. But it is easy to show that this view is in contradiction with de 
Broglie’s initial concept. Let us consider a single particle. As quoted above, this is, 
for de Broglie, incorporated in the wave(2) and has precise position and velocity/4) 
Hence, from Eqs. (1) and (2) we can deduce precise wave parameters X and v, 
leading to only one Fourier component. No superposition is possible. If, in order 
to remove this problem, the quantum mechanical uncertainty of energy and 
momentum is introduced, we end with Schrodinger’s wave packet and de Broglie’s 
initial concept is destroyed.
4. CONCLUSION
According to the discussion above it will be very difficult if not impossible to 
maintain de Broglie’s picture of the independent existence of wave and particle.
Although a single particle can be prepared and handled experimentally, we 
need not restrict our argument to this case but we can extend it to a bunch of 
several particles. Due to the independent existence of the de Broglie wave of each 
particle, it can by no means be expected that outside of the bunch these waves 
cancel each other. Should this be the case for a special bunch of particles (due to 
their energies, velocities, and relative locations), this must be considered an 
accidental and most improbable event. Likewise, there could be a bunch with 
parameters such that the amplitude of the common wave has the maximum 
possible amplitude outside of the narrow location containing the particles.
Only the Fourier components of a Schrodinger wave packet always will can­
cel outside of this region because they are chosen according to this requirement.

Some Arguments against de Broglie Waves
191
On the other hand, there is so much experimental evidence for some wavelike 
structure of reality (as well as for its particlelike structure) that we cannot avoid to 
accept the “dualistic” view: Reality consists of entities inaccessible to our present 
means of reception which, according to our questions, answer in a way that can be 
interpreted as and be dealt with mathematical tools developed for waves or 
particles. But we cannot expect to grasp the complete reality by either of these 
notions.

CHAPTER 12
On the “Completeness” of Quantum
Mechanics
Thomas E. Phipps, Jr.
1. BACKGROUND
No study of the wave-particle dualism would be complete without examination of 
both the necessity and sufficiency of the mathematical-descriptive formalism that 
gives rise to it. Concerning sufficiency of the existing formalism, the issue of 
“completeness” of quantum mechanics as a physical theory was raised most 
poignantly by Einstein/1) This matter is usually treated in connection with the 
Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) paradox/2*3) in the context of proposed “hidden 
variable” modifications or enhancements. The customary exposition then pro­
ceeds to Bell’s theorem^4) and its modern developments, both theoretical and 
experimental^5)—the impression being created that there is a sort of championship- 
of-the-world fight in progress between clearly identified opponents: in one corner 
the recognized title-holder, “quantum mechanics,” in the other a sequence of all 
possible (in general more generously parametrized) challengers to quantum 
mechanics.
As it happens, the assumption of the existence of such well-defined battle 
lines is a possibly fatal oversimplification. The conceptual fallacy in pitting 
quantum mechanics against all comers is simply that “quantum mechanics”—or 
any other product of theoretical physics—is not in principle a uniquely defined 
conceptual entity. Here we have in mind not the many possible versions or 
“interpretations” of accepted formalism, but substantive variants of that formal­
ism. No theory is defined for purposes of physical description—meaning for 
purposes of acquiring observational support—except within a penumbra or con-

gruence of its class of what is termed “covering theories. ” Every experiment that 
upholds quantum mechanics upholds also all covering theories of quantum 
mechanics; for the definition of a covering theory is any more richly parametrized 
theory that reduces identically to the “covered” theory for particular fixed 
values of the extra parameters.
Any generalization of quantum mechanics that is a covering theory of 
quantum mechanics must by this definition inherit all the problems of quantum 
mechanics. Thus, it must encounter difficulties in resolving the EPR paradox to 
just the extent that ordinary quantum mechanics encounters such difficulties. No 
matter how richly parametrized they may be, such theories include quantum 
mechanics and thus include all of that theory’s problems of mating to however- 
defined “physical reality. ” If we confine attention to covering theories, then in the 
battle between quantum mechanics and its opponents . . . which is which? (In the 
words of Pogo, “We have met the enemy and he is us.”)
Since one seems thus to be “licked at the start” in any attempt to generalize 
quantum mechanics via the covering-theory approach, why bring up the subject? 
The answer is that one is licked only in respect to the answering of certain 
questions, such as those raised by EPR, and it may be in some sense (knowable 
only by hindsight from the vantage point of future history of science) that these 
are the wrong questions. In science the questions asked are all-important and 
nature provides no signposts pointing to the “right questions” for any particular 
era. The questions to which EPR leads—including metaphysical or ontological 
ones tending toward a definition of “reality”—may well be the wrong ones.
Perhaps the right ones for our time are more along the line of: Why does our 
cherished mechanics of quanta fail to provide a specific dynamics of “nuclear” or 
“elementary” sub-atomic-scale quanta? Why is it parametrically incapable of 
describing Einsteinian “point events ” not to mention “quantum jumps?” Why 
does it offer no distinction between the unique facts of history and the ensemble of 
possible futures? Why should the principle of relativity of physical size (which 
holds throughout the vast Newtonian range of sizes) suddenly fail at the threshold of 
subatomic scales? Such questions lie clearly within the province of the physicist; 
whereas EPR (at least in its original Einsteinian form) can rapidly lead into 
territory whose ownership the philosopher may legitimately contest. The plainly 
“physical” questions just mentioned typify those upon which a study of covering 
theories of quantum mechanics casts a starkly revealing light.
There is a further, manifestly crucial, aspect of covering theories: invariant 
covering theories provide a royal road to “new physics,” insofar as their extra 
parameters offer fresh descriptive possibilities. As the reader may have inferred, 
this chapter will be addressed mainly to covering theories of quantum mechanics— 
in particular to one most attractive candidate, a “top contender” that seems 
distinguished from the rest by its simplicity. Some of the implications of this 
covering theory for physical description will be sketched, and a potentiality will be 
demonstrated for vastly extending the mechanical descriptive purview. But it must 

On the “Completeness” of Quantum Mechanics

be recognized at its outset that such a study can lead to no “resolution” of the 
wave-particle dualism. For that dualism, in precise analogy with EPR, poses 
questions that—though they inspire significant new experiments—may point less 
toward new physics than toward the clarification and mental integration of old physics.
In fact it is the writer’s prejudice that too much attention to dualism distracts 
from perceiving and enhancing the unity of mechanics, which deserves a promi­
nent place among the goals of physical theory. Concerning the new physics just 
mentioned, all experiments are in themselves ambiguous and offer physical 
insight only in conjunction with theory—so that any experiments, whether or 
not so intended, may in hindsight be perceived as the precursors of new physics. 
Humility is in order, for we still play among the pebbles bordering Newton’s ocean, 
and despite much pebble-polishing and knowledge-squirreling have advanced 
farther in hubris than in wisdom.
2. COVERING THEORIES: AN EXAMPLE FROM
ELECTROMAGNETISM
The subject of “completeness” of physical theory in general being intimately 
bound up with the status of covering theories, it may be instructive to digress 
briefly from our main subject of mechanics into the neighboring field of 
electromagnetism—which affords a singularly elegant, though little-known, ex­
ample of the significance of the invariant covering theory.
In brief, Maxwell’s electromagnetism rests upon field equations that are not 
invariant under any known coordinate transformation. This simple statement of 
fact invites the rebuttal that Maxwell’s equations are covariant under Lorentz 
transformations and that covariance is “just as good” as invariance. To this latter 
contention the obvious response is, “How do you know until you’ve tried?” That 
is, the majority of today’s physicists have imbibed covariant formalism from their 
cradle, and have never so much as sampled the flavor of a truly invariant 
electromagnetic formalism. Having been raised on ersatz, how can they render a 
judgment on echf!
The question of what electromagnetic “invariance” means cannot be sepa­
rated from that of precisely identifying the invariants of kinematics. The subject of 
higher-order or “exact” description—which has been treated elsewhere^6’7)—lies 
outside the present purview. Fortunately, at first order in (v/c), Einsteinian and 
Newtonian identifications of the kinematic invariants are in close enough accord 
that we can proceed to illustrate here the invariant covering theory idea and 
physical role without concern about the description of very high-speed motions.
Confining ourselves then to first-order considerations, we invoke history by 
noting that Heinrich Hertz, the experimentalist who assured Maxwell’s fame by 
confirming the existence of electromagnetic waves, was also a powerful theorist 
who published^8) a form of Maxwell’s equations that was rigorously invariant under

196
Thomas E. Phipps, Jr.
Galilean (inertial) coordinate transformations. To accomplish this, Hertz banished 
“spacetime symmetry” by replacing Maxwell’s partial time derivatives d/dt, 
wherever they occurred in the free-space field equations, with total derivatives,
d/dt = d/dt + v-V
The resulting modified field equations can be shown
*
7) to be Galilean invariant; 
in fact, they are readily expressed in manifestly invariant form/7) such that each 
symbol in the field equations transforms invariantly under inertial transformations. 
Thus, there is no occasion to invoke covariance—which in any case could not 
obtain because of loss of spacetime symmetry (the partial space derivatives 
appearing in the Hertz equations being not symmetrical with the total time 
derivatives).
The formal maneuver just described introduces into the field equations a new 
velocity-dimensioned parameter “v” not present in Maxwell’s version of electro­
magnetism. Hence, the Hertz theory is more richly parametrized than the Maxwell 
theory. In fact, we see that Hertz’s is a covering theory of Maxwell’s—because, 
on assigning to v = (yx, vy, vz) the fixed numerical values (0,0,0), Hertz’s equations 
reduce identically to Maxwell’s (in view of d/dt—+ d/dt). The fact of noninvariance 
of Maxwell’s theory under any coordinate transformation, taken with the fact of 
Galilean invariance of Hertz’s theory, means that Hertz’s equations constitute an 
invariant covering theory of Maxwell’s noninvariant theory.
Why has the reader never heard about this? Since there is a lesson about 
physics (sociology of) to be learned, it is worth a brief further historical detour to 
answer this. First, Hertz used an archaic (nonvector) notation that concealed the 
simplicity of his total time derivative modification. Second, he gave no proof of 
“invariance” but simply asserted it. (A modern commentator/9) on beholding this 
assertion, failed to check the mathematics but blandly remarked that Hertz must 
have meant “covariance.” Not so; he meant what he said, but took too much for 
granted about his readers’ intelligence. In fact, he could not have meant “covari­
ance” because his equations lack spacetime symmetry.)
Third, Hertz made a genuine mistake on the side of physical modeling or 
interpretation (the soft underbelly or Achilles’ heel of all mathematical physics, as 
Hertz himself implied in his famous putdown, “Maxwell’s theory is Maxwell’s 
equations”): Hertz assumed that “v” measured an ether velocity, and further 
borrowed an old assumption due to G. Stokes that ether was 100% convected by 
material bodies. So he interpreted “v” as the observable velocity of such bodies 
in the laboratory, and consequently termed his theory an “electrodynamics of 
moving bodies. ”(8) His equations were thus interpreted
*
9) as predicting the produc­
tion of a magnetic field by motion of a dielectric in the laboratory. This effect was 
looked for and not found/10) Hence, Hertz’s theory (viewed not as Hertz’s 
equations but as these plus Hertz’s fanciful interpretation) was discredited and 
discarded in favor of Maxwell-Lorentz theory.

On the “Completeness” of Quantum Mechanics
197
The latter, being spacetime symmetrical, was used by Einstein-Minkowski 
as the basis for the famous hypothesis of the “metric nature of spacetime.” Once 
that went into the curriculum of the global village there was no turning back from 
covariance to invariance, and Hertz’s important mathematical discovery of an 
invariant covering theory was lost to history . . . until recently, when several 
investigators (including S. Kosowski of Poland, E D. Tombe of Northern Ireland, 
and C. I. Mocanu of Romania, as well as the present author) independently 
rediscovered Hertz’s invariant mathematics. Naturally, it has been necessary 
to find a better physical interpretation than Hertz’s, and here opinions differ to 
this day.
This is not the place to go into the subject, which has been treated else­
where/7) but it may be remarked that by interpreting “v” as the velocity in the 
laboratory of a particular tangible object, the field detector, it is possible to avoid 
both the taint of metaphysics and the trap of false predictions into which Hertz 
unhappily stumbled. There is—as must be true of all covering theories— 
predictive agreement of the covering theory (Hertz’s) with all observational 
evidence that supports the covered theory (Maxwell’s). The special case in which 
covered and covering theories become identical is that in which field detector 
velocity vanishes, v = (0,0,0), which is precisely Maxwell’s case of the field 
detector at rest in the laboratory. In summary: Maxwell got the mathematical 
physics “right in one laboratory,” but not in all variously moving laboratories. 
That remained for Hertz, who yet tripped at the final step of converting mathemati­
cal physics into physics.
The issue of covariant versus invariant description may appear academic, 
pedantic, or even metaphysical. On the contrary, it relates directly and decidably 
to observable facts of experience: It is an issue of real physics. According to 
Einstein-Minkowski all forces in nature must be expressible in covariant form, 
whereas according to Hertz no such requirement can hold for electromagnetism. 
The discovery of a single example of a noncovariant force in nature would settle 
the issue in favor of Hertz’s invariant covering theory and would disprove space­
time symmetry.
As it happens, there is growing evidence for the existence of noncovariant 
electromagnetic forces. The original Ampere law<n) of force between current 
elements, for example, obeyed Newton’s third law and thus was noncovariant. 
Ampere’s law, though never known to be violated/11) was replaced in the favor of 
physicists by the Lorentz force law. The two laws differ by a quantity Q that is an 
exact differential/12) Thus, their predictive differences (together with the Lorentz 
violation of Newton’s third law) vanish when Q is integrated around any closed 
circuit external to the test current element. Yet if the circuit containing the test 
element is itself considered, the nontest portion of that circuit forms an open 
loop. In quantifying action-reaction it is the action upon the test element of the 
nontest portion—not of the total circuit—that must be considered. The integral of 
Q around a partial circuit need not vanish and the distinction between the two laws 

198
Thomas E. Phipps, Jr.
should be measurable. (In this theoretical conclusion we venture to differ from 
Maxwell/13))
In fact, the experiment has been done(14) and has indicated that nature votes 
for Ampere—consequently for Hertz, for invariance, for Newton’s third law as 
acting between current elements, and against homogeneous “spacetime” and its 
alleged metric nature or symmetry. Earlier evidence of Graneau01) and others 
showing support for Ampere’s law by exploding wire and railgun-buckling 
observations at very high pulsed currents is thus confirmed by low-current 
evidence valid under conditions precluding alternative explanations such as 
conductor melting.
It is clear from this electromagnetic example that issues of real physics, 
decidable by crucial experiment, devolve from such seemingly moot questions as 
covered versus covering theory, invariance versus covariance, etc. We now re­
turn to our main topic of mechanics.
3. A SIMPLE COVERING THEORY OF QUANTUM MECHANICS
The foregoing introduction via covering theories to the “completeness” of 
physical theory was concerned with what might be termed the “sufficiency” of 
physical description. Let us now address “necessity. ” In order to reason about this 
topic it is essential to proceed from a priori principles of some sort. Fortunately 
in the case of mechanics we do not start from a tabula rasa: A takeoff point for all 
other kinds of mechanics is provided by classical mechanics, which is well 
understood in all its aspects and may lay some claim to being the most broadly 
successful of all physical theories.
The most highly evolved form of classical particle mechanics is (arguably) 
the Hamilton-Jacobi form,
H

H = Hty, pjf t)
(la)
dS
Pj d<lj
(lb)
~P=^,
1 dQj ’
S = S(qj, Qjt t)
(1c)
which we seize on here because of its marked formal resemblance to the 
Schrodinger and Dirac equations. Two features of Eq. (1) are noteworthy: (1) The 
huge invariance group of the “contact” (or canonical) transformations under 
which these equations of motion remain unchanged. This group includes but far 
exceeds both linear and nonlinear coordinate transformations. (2) The tremendous

199
range of sizes of physical systems to which the equations and their concomitant 
“point particle” idealization apply.
The second item suggests a physical principle capable of guiding the 
development of a covering theory of ordinary quantum mechanics—namely,
Principle of Relativity of Physical Size<7>: The equations of motion of point-particle 
mechanics are expressible in a form that does not connote absolute largeness or 
smallness of the physical system described.
The vital issue is: Over what range of sizes is the Newtonian idealization of 
the mathematical point particle physically permissible? We know that for many 
purposes it is quite acceptable to treat our sun’s planets as mathematical points, 
and to do the same for baseballs, buckshot, and smoke particles. If Dirac(15) is to be 
believed, however, all this changes dramatically at the threshold of the atomic 
world; for, he asserts, quantum mechanics is the discipline that sets an absolute 
size scale to the world. In other words, the grand cavalcade of size relativity comes 
to a jarring halt right in the province of the chemist. That makes chemists very 
important people . . . absolutely.
So, anyway, says Dirac. Now let us see what he does(X5V Heedless of the 
doctrine of size absolutivity, he applies the idealization of the point particle to the 
smallest and lightest of the known massive particles, the electron. (Newton could 
hardly have done more . . . nor less.) Specifically, he cooks up a felicitous point 
operator form of the function H appearing in Eq. (la), together with a formal 
operand 'P, and thus extends into the smallest physical size range—far below the 
atomic—the point particle idealization embodied in the size relativity principle. In 
other words, he ignores size absolutivity and applies Newtonian size relativity . . . 
and this self-refutation is attended with astounding success! Since we ourselves 
must humbly decline to succeed better than success, let us follow this great man in 
doing as he does, not as he says—by applying without stint the size relativity 
principle.
Note that the principle, as stated above, speaks to “a form” of the mechanical 
equations of motion. It does not imply that any form will do ... we have to 
look for a particular form. Fortunately, our task is such an easy one that it prac­
tically performs itself. Proceeding from Eq. (1)—since we wish to share Dirac’s 
success in describing electrons—we know that we shall have to supply a formal 
operand ^Pf at least to Eq. (la). This means looking on the symbols of Eq. (la) in 
general as operators acting toward the right; and since classically (lb) and (1c) are 
on an equal footing with (la) it is natural to think of these additional equations as 
containing rightward-acting operators equally in need of operands. Being parsi­
monious, we do not part with operands easily, and so propose sharing the same 
operand:
(2a) 
ut

-pA = 
<2c>
Although this hypothesis has been arrived at here somewhat in the manner of 
doodling, it turns out to be quite a satisfactory “form” to represent equations of 
motion for all mechanics, invariant on all size scales in the sense of the size 
relativity principle. Indeed, we shall now show that not only is it invariant on all 
size scales of likely interest to physics, but it is a covering theory of all known 
forms of mechanics. Thus, we have again to deal with an invariant covering theory. 
Equation (2) is seen to possess three distinct classes of solution:
Class I. = constant. In this case the constant can be canceled from Eq. (2) 
and what remains is identically the Hamilton-Jacobi equations. Thus, Eq. (2) is a 
covering theory of classical mechanics, Eq. (1). That classical motions are 
included among the exact solutions of our postulated generalized equations of 
motion, Eq. (2), is a fact of profound significance for measurement theory. It alters 
the relationship of classical and quantum physics, since ordinary quantum me­
chanics treats classical motion states always as mere approximations to “exact” 
superpositions of quantum states, never as best-available descriptors in their own 
right. In dealing with Eq. (2) we have to get used to the idea that all mathematical 
solutions are for physical descriptive purposes approximations. What physical 
theory offers in any given problem is merely a modest choice between poor and 
less poor approximation, not a choice between drab approximate and gorgeous 
exact. (We describe things, and descriptions are not things. Ergo descriptions are 
never exact, for only things can be exactly things.)
Class II. S = constant = h/i. In this case, Eq. (2) reduces to
ft d
(3a)
<3b>
h d
-'A = 
<3c>
The value h/i of the constant is chosen to agree with experiment. Equations (3a), 
(3b) are of the form of the Schrodinger-Dirac equations. Equation (3c) is a 
stranger involving extra parameters {Qj9 Pj) that classically are constants of the 
motion and that retain the character of constants regardless of the class of solution 
considered. Obviously, Class II solutions describe quantum (atomic) states of 
motion. By inspection we see that Eq. (3c) has the solution

¥f = <£>(<?,, Oexp
(4)
The exponential multiplier appearing here is just a constant phase factor, in general 
absorbed into the wave function normalization factor. Thus, |^f|2 = |0|2, $ being 
just the Schrodinger or Dirac wave function. Since all the physical predictions of 
quantum mechanics depend on sums or integrals of mean-value products such as 
from which the constant phase factor cancels, it is clear that the 
class of observational agreements of Eq. (3) coincides with that of ordinary 
quantum mechanics, viz.,
- ’75® 
<5‘>
'71’ » —•P 
(5b)
This results from canceling the constant phase factors from Eqs. (2a), (2b).
So, Eq. (2), which we saw above is a covering theory of classical mechanics, 
is now shown to be a covering theory of ordinary quantum mechanics as well. This 
puts us on familiar ground. Nevertheless, there is something new: The “constant” 
phase factor of Eq. (4) contains not universal constants but dynamical constants 
(Q,P), which in general “jump” to new values when the descriptive problem 
(system Hamiltonian) changes . . . thus furnishing an entirely new mechanism of 
discontinuity and a way of severing that “von Neumann chain” of phase connec­
tions which in the Copenhagen view joins all physical descriptive problems into 
one endless, seamless whole. In short, we acquire a post facto way of describing 
happenings, point events, or what used to be called “quantum jumps”—without, 
however, acquiring any new predictive capabilities. Thus, the transition from 
covered to covering theory has profound implications for quantum measurement 
theory. These have been examined elsewhere(7’16) and need not detain us here.
In sum: As a scheme for calculating observable quantities, quantum me­
chanics is altered not a bit by substitution of the covering theory, Eq. (2). But the 
richer parametrization of the latter has a great impact on measurement theory. For 
example: (1) It permits us to view history as a fact, not as the sort of statistical 
(“class of facts”) ensemble appropriate to prediction. (2) Through this nontrivial 
distinction between prediction and retrodiction, it gives substance at the quantum 
level to “time’s arrow. ” (3) It secures the logical sufficiency of mechanics without 
need or call for extra axiomatics (e.g., a projection postulate).
Class III. S #= constant, =# constant. In this case the mathematical 
character of the problem changes. Equation (2c) is no longer a “fifth wheel,” but 
becomes a “second equation in the second unknown. ” That is, in each of the other 
classes of solution there is only one unknown function, S or ^Ff. But here both

202
Thomas E. Phipps, Jr.
of these functions are unknown and have to be solved for simultaneously. An 
example of such simultaneous solution has been given.(7’17) It appears to describe 
nuclear-scale stationary bound states of electron-positrons in terms of states of 
imaginary particle momentum but real mass-energy. Thus, the ability of a 
covering theory to lead to “new physics” (right or wrong) is reaffirmed. Further 
evolutionary developments of the theory are needed. Here we confine attention to 
noting some attributes of the Class III formalism.
The most notable formal features of the Class III solutions are that (a) the 
classical-analog (CA) operators become in general non-Hermitean and (b) the 
Heisenberg postulate is violated. (It is for the latter reason that electron-positrons, 
as noted above, can exist on the nuclear size scale.) The Heisenberg postulate is 
generalized to
r/ d \ 
( d \ 1
- L‘ 
(6)
This leads to a tripartite interpretation of the quantity S: On the classical (Class I) 
scale S is Hamilton’s principal function; on the atomic (Class II) scale S is 
Heisenberg’s constant (fc/z); and on the nuclear (Class III) scale S measures the 
degree of departure of the commutator of (q,p) mechanical variables from the 
Heisenberg value. That is, the commutator is no longer universally constant but 
becomes a space-time variable function subject to the boundary condition that 
quantum mechanics be recovered far from the scene of nuclear (subatomic) 
description; i.e., S(r) —> h/i as r —
If we split off a real function 5 by the definition S = (h/i)s, we see from a well- 
known theorem (viz., that the product of two noncommuting Hermitean operators 
is non-Hermitean) that a CA operator such as H is non-Hermitean; for from Eq. 
(2a) we have
h a T 
= 7-s«P,
(7)
which exhibits H as the product of a Hermitean operator —(hli)dldt and a 
Hermitean (real) operator s. The real property is imposed upon s by the physical 
requirement that the transformations
= Hs~l
'P =
(8)
render the resulting time-conjugate operator 
Hermitean—for these transfor­
mations, applied to eq. (2a), reduce it to

(9)
which identifies 3£ as the operator conjugate to time.
It would in any formalism be disastrous to have the time-conjugate operator 
turn out to be non-Hermitean . . . and that misfortune is avoided by the simple but 
crucial formal transformations (8). To confirm the Hermitean property of 3^, for 
example in the case of a nonrelativistic one-body problem, we observe that
M = Hs~x = [(l/2m0)p-p + VK1 
= -(h2/2mQ)Vs-V + Vs"1
(10)
which is readily seen to be Hermitean if and only if 5 is real. (A similar 
demonstration for the Dirac Hamiltonian is even more immediate.) Here the CA 
momentum operator p is seen from Eq. (2b) to be the non-Hermitean product of 
the Hermitean operator (ft/z)V and the real function 5. A transformation analo­
gous to Eq. (8) yields a Hermitean momentum,
p = p$-] =
du
The transformations (8), by producing Hermitean operators, reduce the Class III 
formalism to mathematically familiar terms. But it must not be overlooked that the 
specific form of the Hamiltonian is affected by the transformation, and it is this 
specific form that contains all the physics. Thus, a new theory that will not in the 
least interest mathematicians may be of considerable interest to physicists.
4. ALTERNATIVE “NECESSITATIONS” OF THE COVERING THEORY, 
EQUATION (2)
An alternative general principle from which Eq. (2) may equally well be 
inferred is the following:
Principle of Correspondence Reversibility: The formal correspondence between 
classical and atomic-scale mechanics shall proceed with equal facility in either 
direction and shall in either case yield a complete mechanics.
Early in the history of quantum mechanics, Pauli<18) advanced a claim that 
one could start with the ordinary quantum mechanical equations of motion, Eq. 
(5), and recover the equations of motion of classical mechanics as a limiting case.

204
Thomas E. Phipps, Jr.
This claim was important at the time for confirming the legitimacy of the new form 
of mechanics, as it improved its connection with known successful mechanics by 
making correspondence a two-way street. Unfortunately, Pauli’s claim is spurious, 
as the only links he established were between Eqs. (5a), (5b) on the one hand and 
Eqs. (la), (lb) on the other. No mention was made of Eq. (1c), without which no 
Newtonian mechanics is possible. Recently it was recognized^19) that what one 
gets by Pauli’s route is not Newtonian particle mechanics but Liouville-type 
statistical mechanics. That is, the formal absence of the constant parameters 
(Qj,Pj)—known classically as the “new canonical variables”—from ordinary 
quantum mechanics deprives that discipline of the specificity needed to describe 
point events and leaves it with only the capacity to describe (statistical) classes of 
events. This is a shared disability of quantum mechanics and classical statistical 
mechanics, as contrasted with classical point particle mechanics. The cause, a 
parametric deficiency, is likewise shared.
If the correspondence reversibility principle is imposed as mandatory, it is 
apparent that ordinary quantum mechanics is in violation and must be replaced by 
some other theory. The need to enrich parametrization on the quantum side in 
order to improve specificity for post facto point event description—and to prevent 
any change in number of parameters during the correspondence transition in either 
direction—then suggests the covering theory approach, and one quickly gets to 
Eq. (2) by fairly obvious inferences. There is no need to elaborate here. Equation 
(2) offers a true point particle descriptive mechanics for all physical size scales.
Finally, setting aside all “principles,” there is a direct empirical route to 
something like Eq. (2) via the reader’s personal knowledge. Most physicists have 
had the experience of observing in a darkened room the scintillations, e.g., of 
a zinc sulfide phosphor. These are flashes of light that have the appearance of 
originating at definite times from pinpoint locations. It may be supposed that these 
attributes of localization would persist if the phosphor were examined under 
varying magnifications up to the most powerful. We seem thus to experience (and 
to retain in “historical” memory) personal detection of a specific space-time 
constellation of point events. Yet since the equations of motion of ordinary 
quantum mechanics, Eq. (5), lack parameters capable even of after-the-fact 
description of such a particular event constellation, the Copenhagen interpretation 
assures us that quantum-level “historical” retrodiction is as futile as prediction 
and that such an experience, as well as the memory of it, is consequently an 
illusion.
Physics was chartered to describe human experience, not to denigrate that 
experience as illusion. The illusion, according to the argument of this chapter, 
is that Eq. (5) forms the basis for a “complete” mechanical description of nature. 
The conservative approach to formal completion involves exploiting the wealth of 
possibilities for parametric enrichment—while “holding fast to the good”— 
offered by invariant covering theories.

CHAPTER 13
Neutron Interferometric Tests 
of Quantum Mechanics
Helmut Rauch
Neutron interferometers based on wave-front and amplitude division have been 
developed in the past. Most experiments have been performed with the perfect 
crystal neutron interferometer which provides widely separated coherent beams 
enabling new experiments in the field of fundamental nuclear and solid-state 
physics. A nondispersive sample arrangement and the difference of stochastic and 
deterministic absorption have been investigated. The verification of the ^-sym­
metry of spinors and of the quantum mechanical spin-superposition experiment 
on a macroscopic scale are typical examples of interferometry in spin space. These 
experiments were continued with two resonance coils in the beams, and the results 
showed that coherence persists, even if an energy exchange between the neutron 
and the resonator system occurs with certainty. A quantum beat effect was 
observed when slightly different resonance frequencies were applied to both 
beams. In this case, an extremely high energy sensitivity of 2.7 x 10“19 eV was 
achieved. This effect can be interpreted as a magnetic Josephson-effect analog. 
Phase echo systems, experiments with chopped beams and multiplate interferome­
try are discussed as examples for forthcoming experiments. All the results 
obtained to date are in agreement with the formalism of quantum mechanics but 
stimulate the discussion about the interpretation of this basic theory.

is based on amplitude division and is now most frequently used due to its wide 
beam separation and its universal availability for (1) fundamental, (2) nuclear, and 
solid-state physics research/3’41 The interferometer based on grating diffraction is 
a recent development and has its main application for very slow neutrons/51 A 
schematical comparison is shown in Figure 1. The perfect crystal interferometer 
provides the highest intensity and highest flexibility for beam handling.

In this chapter the development and the application of the perfect crystal 
interferometer are reviewed. The first successful test of such an interferometer 
was in 1974 at our small 250-kW TRIGA reactor in Vienna
*
31 (Figure 2).
The perfect crystal interferometer represents a macroscopic quantum device 
with characteristic dimensions of several centimeters. The basis for this kind of 
neutron interferometry is provided by the undisturbed arrangement of atoms in a 
monolithic perfect silicon crystal/3’61 An incident beam is split coherently at the 
first crystal plate, reflected at the middle plate, and coherently superposed at the 
third plate (Figure 1). It follows immediately from general symmetry considera­
tions that the wave functions in both beam paths, which compose the beam in the 
forward direction behind the interferometer, are equal (<|/q = i|$), because they 
are transmitted-reflected-reflected (TRR) and reflected-reflected-transmitted 
(RRT), respectively. The system is based on Bragg diffraction from perfect 
crystals; therefore, the de Broglie wavelength of the neutrons is about 1.8 A and 
their energy is about 0.025 eV.
The whole theoretical treatment of the diffraction process is based on the 
dynamical diffraction theory, which can also be found in the literature for the 
neutron case/7-101 Inside the perfect crystal, two wave fields are excited when the 
incident beam fulfills the Bragg condition, one of them having its nodes at the 
position of the atoms and the other in between them. Therefore, their vectors are 
slightly different - k2— 10~5&0) and due to mutual interference processes, 
a rather complicated interference pattern is built up, which changes substantially 
over a characteristic length Ao—the so-called Pendelldsung length, which is 
on the order of 50 |xm for an ordinary silicon reflection. To preserve the 
interference properties over the length of the interferometer, the dimensions of the 
monolithic system have to be accurate on a scale comparable to this quantity. 
Therefore, the whole interferometer crystal has to be placed on a stable goniometer 
table under conditions avoiding temperature gradients and vibrations.
A phase shift between the two coherent beams can be produced by nuclear, 
magnetic, or gravitational interactions. In the first case, the phase shift is most 
easily calculated using the index of refraction

where bc is the coherent scattering length and N is the particle density of the phase 
shifting material. As in ordinary light optics the change of the wave function is 
obtained as follows:
(3)
Therefore, the intensity behind the interferometer is given by
zo a I'I'o + ^ol2 K (1 + cosx)
(4)
The intensity of the beam in the deviated direction follows from particle conservation:
Zo + /H = const 
(5)
Thus, the intensities behind the interferometer vary as a function of the thickness 
D of the phase shifter, the particle density A, or the neutron wavelength X.
Any experimental device deviates from the idealized assumptions made by 
the theory: the perfect crystal can have slight deviations from its perfectness, 
and its dimensions may vary slightly; the phase shifter contributes to imperfec­
tions by variations in its thickness and inhomogeneities; and even the neutron 
beam itself contributes to a deviation from the idealized situation because of its 
wavelength spread 8X. Therefore, the experimental interference patterns have to 
be described by a generalized relation

where A, B, and <|>0 are characteristic parameters of a certain setup. It should 
be mentioned, however, that the idealized behavior described by Eq. (4) can nearly 
be approached by a well-balanced setup/13) The reduction of the contrast at high 
order results from the longitudinal coherence length which is determined by the 
wavelength spread of the neutron beam (AxL = X2/AX). This causes a change in 
the amplitude factor of Eq. (6) as (B -> Bexp [-(AX/X0)2x§/2]). The wavelength 
dependence of x in Eq. (3) disappears when the surface of the sample is oriented 
parallel to the reflecting planes and the path length through the interferometer 
becomes Do/sin0B and, therefore, the phase shift x — —^^hki^c^o becomes 
independent of the wavelength. In this case the damping at high interference 
orders due to the wavelength spread does not appear as in the standard position. 
Related results of a recent experiment where the interference pattern in the 256th 
interference order have been measured in the dispersive and the nondispersive 
sample position are shown in Figure 3/14) The much higher visibility of the 
interferences in the nondispersive sample arrangement is clearly seen.
2. STOCHASTIC VERSUS DETERMINISTIC ABSORPTION
A certain beam attenuation can be achieved either by a semitransparent 
material or by a proper chopper system. The transmission probability in the first
All of the results of interferometric measurements obtained to date can be 
explained well in terms of the wave picture of quantum mechanics and the 
complementarity principle of standard quantum mechanics. Nevertheless, one 
should bear in mind hat the neutron also carries well-defined particle properties, 
which have to be transferred through the interferometer. These properties are 
summarized in Table 1 together with a formulation in the wave picture. Both 
particle and wave properties are well established and therefore, neutrons seem 
to be a proper tool for testing quantum mechanics with massive particles, where 
the wave-particle dualism becomes obvious.
All neutron interferometric experiments pertain to the case of self-interference, 
where during a certain time interval, only one neutron is inside the interferometer, 
if at all. Usually, at that time the next neutron has not yet been born and is still 
contained in the uranium nuclei of the reactor fuel. Although there is no interaction 
between different neutrons, they have a certain common history within predeter­
mined limits which are defined, e.g., by the neutron moderation process, by their 
movement along the neutron guide tubes, by the monochromator crystal, and by 
the special interferometer setup. Therefore, any real interferometer pattern con­
tains single particle and ensemble properties together. In the following sections, 
typical experiments performed mainly by our group within the last 15 years will 
be presented.

i.e., the contrast of the interference pattern is proportional to Va, in the first case, 
and proportional to a in the second case, although the same number of neutrons

have been observed in both cases. The absorption represents a measuring pro­
cess in both cases because a compound nucleus is produced with an excitation 
energy of several MeV, which is usually deexcited by captured gamma rays. These 
can easily be detected by different means.
Figure 4 shows a typical result for the transmission probabilities near 
a = 0.25 as well as the dependence of the normalized interference amplitude on 
the transmission probability/15’17) The different contrast becomes especially ob­
vious for low transmission probabilities where the interfering part of the inter­
ference pattern is distinctly larger than the transmission probability through the 
semitransparent absorber sheet. The difference diverges for a -+ 0 but it has been 
shown that in this regime the variations of the transmission due to variations of the 
thickness or of the density of the absorber plate have to be taken into account which 
shifts the points below the Va curve/18)
The region between the linear and the square root behavior can be achieved by 
very fast-rotating chopper slits or by a narrow transmission lattice, where one 
starts to lose information of through which individual slit the neutron went. The 
critical slit width is connected to the Pendelldsung length and to the fact that 
certain neutrons become “labeled” neutrons due to slit diffraction which makes a 
separate detection possible in principle.
3. WAVE PARTICLE MEASURE
The results of the previous section show that the degree of contrast is a 
sensitive measure for the particle and wave character of the physical system. 
Therefore, an attempt is made to get a more general formulation, which accounts 
for stochastic and deterministic processes and for situations where a preparatory 
stage is created or where a real measuring process with a collapse of the wave field 
occurs.
For this more general discussion, the formulas can be used in the idealized 
form
I = T[1 + Vcos<|)'] 
(10)
where we use the transparency of the system T = (a + l)/2 and the visibility of the 
interference fringes V = Vs = 2a/(a+1) for the statistical and V = Vd = 2a2/(a + 1) 
for the deterministic case. Both quantities can be obtained from the interference 
pattern or by separate measurements of the beam attenuation factor a. The quantity 
TV denotes the amplitudes of the interference fringes as they are shown in Fig­
ure 4. If the reduction of the contrast is also caused by high-order coherence 
phenomena or due to the roughness of the sample, the visibility factor in the 
equations becomes a product of the different visibility factors.

A measure for the particle nature can be found, if a quantity is taken which 
is the sum of the noninterfering intensity plus the probability of the neutrons for 
being absorbed in beam I or II, respectively^9):
P(7V) = T - TV + ( 1-T) = 1 - TV = 1 - 
(11)
and the wave nature from the amplitude of the interference pattern as
W(TV) = TV = <| W1!) 
(12)
This rather simple formulation fulfills the relation
P + W = 1 
(13)
and can also be used for cases where the contrast attenuation is caused by large 
phase shifts which are on the order of the coherence length. In this case, the 
visibility varies but T remains 1. Obviously, this formulation is in complete 
agreement with the experimental results concerning the beam attenuation and the 
loss of contrast measurements discussed before. The whole results can be summa­
rized in a single figure (Figure 5). Measurements with equal beam attenuation 
in both beam paths belong to the line V=l, high-order loss of contrast and other 
deterministic phase mixing measurements are described by the curve T=l, and 
many incoherent phase mixing processes lie near the origin.
This kind of formulation may facilitate a combination with a Shannon 
information-theoretic entropy approach, where various attempts have been made 
in the past/20’21)
4. 4'tt-SYMMETRY OF SPINORS
The magnetic interaction is caused by the dipole coupling of the magnetic 
moment of the neutron pi to a magnetic field B (H = — piB). Therefore, 
the propagation of the wave function is given by
—> 
— i|jq^-^“/2 — i|j(<x) 
(14)
where a represents a formal description of the Larmor rotation angle around the 
field B (a = (2|jl//i)/Bdt- (2ji/7iv) JBds). This wave function shows the typi­
cal 4'n--symmetry of a spinor

|WM2 = |l|/(0)|2
(16)
The ^-periodicity becomes visible in interferometer experiments, as predicted 
theoretically/22-24^ and has been verified experimentally in early neutron interfero­
metric experiments/25’26) where the intensity for unpolarized incident neutrons 
was found to be
Zo |t|/(0) + t|>(a)|2 
+ cos^J 
(17)
The results of the first related experiment are shown in Figure 6. These results are 
widely debated in the literature. It should be mentioned that this ^-symmetry can 
always be attributed to real rotations in the case of fermions/27’28) Today, the most 
precise value for the periodicity factor is a0 = 715.87 ± 3.8 degrees.(29) This value 
provides only a small margin for speculation about SU(2)-symmetry breaking, 
but a new and more precise determination of a0 is recommended. The ^-peri­
odicity effect has been observed for unpolarized as well as polarized neutrons, 
which demonstrates the intrinsic feature of this phenomenon and the self­
interference properties involved in these kind of experiments. New attention 
should be drawn to an interferometric observation of the Berry phase(30) which 
represents a topological phenomenon and is therefore of central interest.

5. SPIN STATE INTERFEROMETRY
In this case the polarization vector can be influenced differently in the two 
coherent beam paths and these beams can be superposed at the end of the 
interferometer. The principles of these experiments and the most important results 
are summarized in Figure 7(31’32) More experimental details can be found in these 
references. There is a marked difference between the action of a static flipper and 
a resonance flipper, which has to be discussed in more detail.
In the first case (static flipper) the wave function is changed by the flipper 
according to Eq. (14), which has to be applied for polarized incident neutrons:
i|/-> e^e-^2\z) = e*e-
ioy* l2\z} = -i(yye^\z) = e^ - z) (18)
The rotation of the polarization vector around the y-axis has been postulated to 
be it/33) Thus, two wave functions with opposite spin directions are superposed 
at the third plate
i|> oc (|z) + e^\-z)) 
(19)
which corresponds to the situation proposed by Wigneri34) in 1963 to verify the 
quantum mechanical spin superposition law. In this case the intensities in the 
O and H beams are equal, and the beams are polarized in the (x,y)-plane, i.e., 
perpendicular to both the initial spin directions. The angle of the polarization in the 
(x,y)-plane is given by the nuclear phase shift:

Thus, a pure initial state is transferred to a pure final state which is different to

220
Helmut Rauch
if a polarization analysis is performed in the |x) or in the |y) direction. If the 
analyzer is set in the |z) (or |-z)) direction, no intensity modulation is observed.
The second version of the spin superposition experiment was performed with 
a Rabi-type resonance flipper which is also commonly used in polarized neutron 
physics. This kind of interaction is time-dependent and, in addition to the spin­
inversion, an exchange of the resonance energy EHF = /io>r occurs between the 
neutron and the resonator system, which has to be considered in the interfero­
metric experiment. This energy exchange was observed in a separate experiment, 
where the energy resolution AE of the apparatus was better than the Zeeman 
energy splitting (AE < EHF).(35) This experiment was performed according to a 
proposal of Drabkin and Zhitnikov/36) For a complete spin reversal the frequency 
of the field has to match the resonance condition and the amplitude Bx has to ful­
fill the relation | i^BJ/hv = it, where / is the length of the coil. Oscillating fields are 
used instead of purely rotational fields and, therefore, only one component 
contributes to the resonance which causes a slight shift of the resonance frequency 
from the Larmor frequency a>L = 21^1^0//? due to the Bloch-Siegert effect 
(<or = o)L[l + (B^/lbBg)])/37’38) Thus, the wave function of the beam with the 
flipper changes according to
v|j —> 
(21)
Therefore, a spin-up and a spin-down state are superposed at the position of the 
third plate. The final polarization of the beam in the forward direction is given by
cos(x + to/) 
sin (x + to/) 
0
(22)
and lies again in the (x,y)-plane but now rotates within this plane with the reso­
nance (Larmor) frequency without being driven by a magnetic field. A strobo­
scopic method was needed for the observation of this effect. The direction of the 
polarization in the (x,y)-plane depends on the status (phase) of the resonance field 
and, therefore, has to be measured synchronously with this phase.
The observed interference pattern (Figure 7) demonstrates that coherence 
persists, although a well-defined energy exchange between the neutron and the 
apparatus exists. Thus, an energy exchange is not automatically a measuring 
process. As we will see later, the exchanged photon cannot be used for a quantum 
nondemolition measurement. In our experiment, the following argument based on 
different uncertainty relations can be used: First, a single absorbed or emitted 
photon of the resonator cannot be detected because of the photon number-phase 
uncertainty relation, which can be written in the form(39’40)

Neutron Interferometric Tests
221
where S and C can be expressed by the creation and annihilation operators, 
C = (a_ + a+)/2 and 5 = (a_ — a+)/2i, whose matrix elements couple coherent 
Glauber states. For our purpose this relation can be used in its simpler form.
(AA^XAfl2) I 
(24)
The uncertainty of the photon number of the resonator is minimized for a coherent 
state resonator by AV = 
and, therefore, the lower limit for the phase
uncertainty becomes A6 « l/( V(7V)). Because in this kind of spin-superposition 
experiment the phase determination of the flipper field is required to be better 
than 0 J for the stroboscopic method, it is therefore impossible to observe a 
single absorbed or emitted photon (AN 1).
A second version of the beam path detection may be based on the observation 
of the energy change of the neutron. This can only be achieved if the energy 
resolution of the instrument fulfills the relation AE 2|jlB0. On the other hand, the 
stroboscopic measuring method requires time channels Ar l/2vHF = /i/4|pi|B0, 
which provides another constraint on the experiment. Both conditions cannot be 
fulfilled with respect to the energy-time uncertainty relation concerning the beam 
parameters 
h/2. Therefore, we conclude that a simultaneous detection
of the beam path through the interferometer and of the interference pattern re­
mains impossible. This kind of experiment has also been analyzed in terms of a 
coherent state or of a number state resonator/42) These authors came to the same 
conclusion, that interference becomes destroyed if a signal is extracted from the 
resonators.
It has been argued by Vigier’s group^43’44) that new information about the 
particle-wave duality can be obtained with resonator coils in both coherent 
beams. The corresponding experiments will be discussed in the next section.
6. DOUBLE COIL EXPERIMENTS
The experimental arrangement for the double coil experiment is shown in 
Figure 8 /45’46) The final polarization lies in the |— z) direction and the energy 
transfer can be smaller or larger than the energy resolution AE because this 
information cannot be in any way associated with a beam path detection. The 
layout of the experiment followed the proposal of Vigier’s group/43 44) According 
to our previous considerations, the change of the wave functions with the reso­
nance flippers turned to the resonance frequency can be written for polarized 
incident neutrons (|z)) and for different modes of operation as follows.

a. Both flippers are operated synchronously without a phase shift between 
the slipper fields:
_> e/(<o-<or)f|-z) + 
(25)
This results in an intensity modulation
Zo oc 1 + cos x 
(26)
which is independent of the flipper fields.
b. 
Both flippers are operated synchronously with a distinct phase relation A:
+ e^e^e^-^-z) 
(27)
In this case, the intensity modulation is given by
/0 °c 1 + cos(x + A) 
(28)
c. Both flippers are operated asynchronously with statistically fluctuating 
phase differences A(Z) which average out during the measuring interval. Then.
Zo a const 
(29)
It should be mentioned in this context that even in this case, coherence phenomena 
can be observed if a stroboscopic investigation is performed (Zo = Z0(A)).
The results of these related experiments are shown in Figure 8. Complete 
agreement with the theoretical predictions is found. The interference properties 
are preserved, although an energy exchange /iwr certainly takes place. Only 
quanta within a narrow energy band around and no others are excited inside 
the flipper resonator. Therefore, one could believe that the spin flip and the energy 
transfer process to the neutron occurred inside one of the two coils, which would 
demonstrate that the neutron has chosen one of the two possible paths. But even 
this rather weak statement would require the concept of pilot waves, quantum 
potentials, etc., leading immediately to questions about the interpretation of 
quantum mechanics, which are not the subject of this chapter. In this connection, 
an experiment is proposed which shows this situation even more clearly(47) (Figure 
9). In this case, the flippers are operated only if the neutron burst is inside the coils 
and a strong magnetic field causes an energy shift AEHF = 2|jlB0 which is larger 
than the energy width of the beam (AEHF > AE) and, therefore, measurable with a 
high-resolution time-of-flight system. In this situation, it looks even more likely 
that the neutron has chosen one of both possible beam paths although we do not 
know which one. In this case the field (phase) variation becomes faster than the 
coherence time of the beam (Arc = Ax/v) which causes a phase-chopping effect, 
reducing the interference contrast.

7. MACROSCOPIC QUANTITIES IN UNCERTAINTY RELATIONS
By means of perfect crystal neutron optics the resolution in momentum or 
energy space can be increased to such an extent, that the conjugate quantities each 
macroscopic dimensions.
First, the perfect crystal can be envisaged as a very narrow collimator, whose 
angular divergence is roughly given by the ratio of the lattice constant divided 
by the thickness of the crystal This feature becomes visible in multiple 
Laue-rocking curves, where the convolution of the individual reflection curves 
exhibits a very narrow central peak<48’49> which has similarities to the diffraction 
focusing effect first treated for X rays/50) The individual reflection curves are well 
known from dynamical diffraction theory and can be written as(7 7

where A is a reduced quantity related to the thickness of the perfect crystal and 
y describes the deviation from the exact Bragg angle. At the same time, a narrow 
incident beam is spread out across the whole Borrmann fan, whose dimension at 
the exit is given by the thickness (t) of the crystal plates as 2rrg0B. The rapid 
variation of the intensity across the reflection curve or the Borrmann fan (Pendel- 
losung fringes) is caused by the rapid variation of the phases of the excited waves 
inside the crystal. The corresponding rocking curves are given by the convolution 
of such fine structured curves. They can also be interpreted as self-correlation 
functions, which can be connected with the uncertainty relations/51) The analytical 
form of the central peak of these multiple Laue rocking curves can be written as^52)

The width at half maximum is given by
89 = 0.7^
(32)
which is on the order of several thousandths of a second of arc. The related 
momentum uncertainty (AA — A80) is on the order of cm-1 and, therefore, Ax 
in the space-momentum uncertainty relation becomes on the order of cm. The 
formulas for the triple case Laue rocking curves and for various other contributions 
to the rocking curves can be found in the literature/5 2)
The experiments have been performed with monolithic multiplate systems by 
rotating a wedge-shaped material around the beam axis; this provides a proper 
control of small beam deflections in the horizontal plane, which is the only 
sensitive plane for perfect crystal reflections. This deflection is given by the 
properties of the material, by the angle 0 of the wedge, and by the rotation angle a 
around the beam axis

The broadening of the central peak due to the insertion of a macroscopic slit is 
shown in Figure 10. More recently, measurements with macroscopic transmission

broadening of the narrow central peak due to diffraction from a slit with a width of 5 mm.(53)

226

lattices have yielded similar results. Although the wavelength of the neutrons is 
smaller than the width of the slit, by a factor of about 108 the broadening becomes 
visible due to the high angular resolution of such systems. This can also be 
understood by the large transversal coherence length of the beam across the whole 
Borrmann fan (2rrg0B).
As an alternative to the high-momentum resolution just discussed, an 
extremely high-energy resolution can be achieved by a slight modification of the 
double coil experiment described in Section 6. If the frequencies of the two coils 
are chosen to be slightly different, the energy transfer becomes different too 
(AE = h(a>r[ — o)r2)). The frequency difference can be made very small, if high- 
quality synthesizers are used for the field generation. The flipping efficiencies for 
both coils are always very close to 1 (better than 0.99). Now, the wave functions 
change according to
X 
(34)
Therefore, the intensity behind the interferometer exhibits a typical quantum beat 
effect, given by
I oc 1 + cos [x + (wrl - <or2)z] 
(35)
Thus, the intensity behind the interferometer oscillates between the forward and 
deviated beam without any apparent change inside the interferometer/45’46) The 
time constant of this modulation can reach a macroscopic scale which is again 
correlated to an uncertainty relation &E&t h/2. Figure 11 shows the result of an 
experiment, where the periodicity of the intensity modulation, T = 2zn,/((orl — <or2), 
amounts to T = (47.90 ± 0.15)s caused by a frequency difference of about 
0.02 Hz. This corresponds to a mean difference of AE energy transfer between the 
two beams, E = 8.6 x 10-17 eV, and to an energy sensitivity of 2.7 x 10“19 eV,

which is better by many orders of magnitude than that of other advanced spectro­
scopic methods. This high resolution is strongly decoupled from the monochroma­
ticity of the neutron beam, which was AEB — 5.5 x 10-4 eV around a mean 
energy of the beam EB = 0.023 eV in this case. It should be mentioned that the 
result can also be interpreted as being the effect of a slowly varying phase A(z) 
between the two flipper fields [see Eq. (28)], but the more physical description is 
based on the argument of a different energy transfer. The extremely high resolu­
tion may be used for fundamental, nuclear, and solid-state physics applications.
The quantum beat effect can also be interpreted as a magnetic Josephson ef­
fect analog/54) In this case, the phase difference is driven by the magnetic energy

which yields the observed intensity modulation [compare eq. (35)]
M(l + cosA(O) 
(37)
where A(Z) = 2[kBQt/h. This is analogous to the well-known Josephson effect 
in superconducting tunnel junctions/55) where the phase of the Cooper pairs in 
both superconductors is related according to
- <!>,) = |(E2 - EJ = |2 eV 
(38)
which is driven by the electrical potential V between both superconductors.
An intrinsic lower limit for the energy width of the neutron beam which is 
caused by its lifetime, t = 925 s, which yields according to AEj > h/2, AZ^ - 
3.5 x 10-24 eV. The decay appears in both beam paths and contributes an 
attenuation factor exp(—z/t) = exp (—/t/v)which is similar to those discussed in 
Section 2.
8. EXPERIMENTS IN PROGRESS OR IN PREPARATION
We feel that most of the fundamental experiments for testing quantum 
mechanics by neutron interferometry have already been performed but there will 
be the need to demonstrate the features of quantum mechanics in more detail. The 
proposal shown in Figure 9 is such an example. The outcome of such an 
experiment can be calculated in advance but it suggests that the neutron has a 
trajectory inside the interferometer although which one remains unknown. The 
transition to the quantum limit has to be considered if an uncertainty limit is 
touched (lattice diffraction, diffraction in time, phase chopping). There also 
remain possibilities for more accurate repetitions of experiments under even better 

228
Helmut Rauch
conditions which could produce spectacular results at any time. In addition, there 
may be new experiments, which could push the development of advanced neutron 
optics further. Some examples of such experiments are discussed below.
a. Phase echo system. Such systems are similar to spin echo systems known 
in advanced neutron spectroscopy/
) but use the phase of the wave function 
instead of the Larmor precession angle as the measurable quantity/
) The 
interference pattern disappears, if the longitudinal shift of the wave packets due 
to a phase shifter becomes larger than the longitudinal coherence length of the 
beam (xX/2 tt > X2/AX, see also Figure 3). This behavior has been observed 
experimentally/
’
) By applying an opposite phase shift in the same beam, or the 
same phase shift in the second beam of the interferometer, the smeared inter­
ference pattern can be restored to full contrast, shown schematically in Figure 12. 
Such experiments demonstrate that phase information can exist although the 
measured signal looks like a statistical mixture. The coherence properties can be 
recovered if a proper measuring method is applied. Recovery of a smeared-out 
interference pattern has been demonstrated recently by using combinations of 
thick Bi- and Ti-phase shifters/
) This method will establish a new horizon if 
combined with multiplate interferometry (part c), where interference properties of 
a dephased beam can be recovered in the following interferometer loop.

b. Pulsed beam interferometry. It could be argued that there is always an 
overlap of wave functions in a stationary situation (or at least of plane wave 
components of the wave packet from both beam paths) at the position of the beam 
splitter and at the place of superposition. This can be avoided by using a chopper 
which produces bursts, whose lengths are smaller than the dimension of the 
interferometer^
) (Figure 13). The known spatial spreading of the wave function of 
matter waves

_ Ax(0) _
(39)
has no influence on the interference properties for all practical situations, where 
the length of the bursts Ax is much larger than the coherence length, X2/AX.
FIGURE 12. Principle of a phase echo system/57)

229
FIGURE 13. Sketch of the apparatus for interference experiments with pulsed beams/61)
Nevertheless, such experiments will make the discussion about the collapse of the 
wave field in the case of an absorber (see Section 2) more profound and new types 
of delayed choice experiments will become feasible where the decision about 
interference or beam path detection can be made after the burst has passed the 
beam splitter. Very interesting heat effects have been observed when the inter­
ference pattern of the slower neutrons from a chopper slit in front overlaps with the 
interference pattern of the faster neutrons from the following slit/61’62)
c. Multiplate interferometry. A five-plate interferometer is shown in Figure 
14. In this setup, different interferometer loops are linked together by common 
beam paths. The theoretical description follows the formalism developed for the 
standard triple-plate case/ ’ ) but the expected interference properties show some 
new features, which do not exist for the standard interferometer. The whole 
theoretical description follows the treatment for the X-ray case(63); here we refer 
to a four-plate interferometer and specify averaged intensities of the interfering 
beams behind this device:

FIGURE 14. Sketch of a multiplate interferometer with an indication of different interferometer loops 
(left) and principle of coherent beam mixing (right).
Each intensity depends on two net phase shifts of two interferometer loops. First 
experimental investigations agree with these predictions.(64) The intensities and 
interference properties of the loops B and C can partly be controlled by the first 
interferometer loop. There exist additional positions of four-wave mixing, which 
provide new aspects for coherent neutron optics. The intensities inside these 
interferometer loops can be coherently influenced not only at the position of the 
splitter but also at the position of the mirror. This may be useful for the achieve­
ment of squeezed neutron states<65> and new bunching systems. The formulas have 
been checked as to whether a phase shifter can have an influence, if it is placed 
within a beam with zero intensity (e.g., y3 if xA = ir). They predict no such 
influence. Absorbing and thick phase shifters producing phase shifts on the order 
of the coherence length lead to additional effects. 9 * * * *
9. DISCUSSION
All the results of the neutron interferometric experiments are well described
by the formalism of quantum mechanics. According to the complementarity
principle of the Copenhagen interpretation, the wave picture has to be used to
describe the observed phenomena. The question as to how the well-defined

Neutron Interferometric Tests
231
particle properties of the neutron are transferred through the interferometer, is not 
meaningful within this interpretation, but it should be an allowed one from the 
physical point of view. Therefore, other interpretations should also be included 
in the discussion of such experiments. The particle picture can be preserved if pilot 
waves are postulated or if a quantum potential guides the particle to the predicted 
position. Related calculations have been performed for a simplified interferometer 
system/66’67) Unfortunately, the results of these calculations are identical with the 
results of ordinary quantum mechanics and, therefore, to decide between both 
points of view remains an epistemological problem. The nonlocal quantum 
potential and the beam trajectories are shown in Figure 15. The alternative view 
according to the wave picture is visualized in Figure 16 where the position of the 
nodes of the superposed wave fields relative to the lattice points determine where 
the waves proceed behind the interferometer.
We have always tried to perform unbiased experiments and do not wish to 
interfere with any epistemological interpretation of quantum mechanics. Perhaps 
in the future new proposals for experiments will be formulated that permit a unique 
decision between different interpretations. As an experimentalist, one appreciates 
the pioneering work of the founders of quantum mechanics, who created this basic 
theory with so little experimental evidence. Now we have much more direct evi­
dence, even on a macroscopic scale, but, nevertheless, one notices that the

position between the nodes of the wave field and the lattice points depends on the phase shift and 
determines the beams behind the interferometer.
interpretation of quantum mechanics goes beyond human intuition in certain 
cases. Only two aspects of the experiments discussed before should be repeated: 
How can every neutron in the spin-superposition experiment be transferred from 
an initial pure state in the |z) direction into a pure state in the |x) direction behind 
the interferometer, if no spin turn occurs in one beam and a complete spin reversal 
occurs in the other beam path? How can every neutron have information about 
which beam to join behind the interferometer, when a slightly different energy 
exchange occurs in both beams inside the interferometer and the time constant of 
the beat effect is many orders of magnitude larger than the time of flight through 
the system?
Experiments of our group and such which are related to fundamental physics 
problems have been discussed in this chapter. Several recent review articles can 
supplement a broader scope about the status of neutron interferometry/68-72)

Gedanken Experiments on Duality

1. APPROACH
If we accept experimental results^1-3) as evidence of violations of Bell’s inequal­
ities/1’4) we either have to abandon realism or introduce some faster-than-light 
(FTL) interaction.
*
 This is indeed quite an amazing result, one which deserves 
thorough theoretical and experimental investigation. My approach is a first attempt 
in this direction. As I intend to show, nonlocal realism, just like local realism, 
can be investigated experimentally.
I have considered experiments that are combinations of experiments on 
wave-particle duality^6) and on nonlocality.(2) In an experiment to test Bell’s in­
equalities using two-channel polarizers, a photon of a correlated pair has either to 
follow one or the other of two possible paths. On the other hand, in an experiment 
with a Mach-Zehnder interferometer the photon has to follow both paths at the 
same time. An appealing idea is to combine these experiments in order to find out 
what will then happen to the photon. From the standpoint of realism, what happens 
to the photon at the two-channel polarizer must be independent of the kind of 
experiment that is being performed.
The following question can be raised when a FTL interaction is assumed: when 
is this interaction triggered?! According to realism, and contrary to the usual 
interpretation, this triggering has to be caused by some physical process, whether
♦Actually, some loopholes still remain, and we may try to explain the experimental results using a local 
realistic approach/5)
tThis question is obviously related to that of knowing just when the collapse of the state vector takes 
place, in the usual interpretation of quantum mechanics. Owing, however, to the essentially subjec­
tivistic character of this interpretation, no satisfactory answer can be expected here.

it is observed or not. In the cases to be examined, there are two evident possibili­
ties: splitting of the photon at the polarizer or photon detection at the photomultiplier.
Even if we assume that quantum mechanical predictions for the experiments 
so far performed are correct, it seems natural to suppose that the assumption of 
realism may lead to experimental consequences in conflict with the usual inter­
pretation of quantum mechanics. Naturally, there is no rigorous mathematical 
procedure to show this. Nonetheless, there are interesting consequences if we start 
with some simple, physically sound assumptions.
*
Many of the results to be presented here have already been discussed else­
where/7-9) In the present chapter these conclusions will be made more rigorous 
and will be extended to new situations.
2. WAVE-PARTICLE DUALITY
In the first experiment to be considered,a light wave packet containing a 
single photon impinges on a beam splitter (the argument would follow the same 
lines if it impinged on a two-channel polarizer instead). Two mutually exclusive 
phenomena may then be observed: photon anticorrelation (the photon follows one 
of two possible paths) or photon interference (using a Mach-Zehnder interferome­
ter). Consistent with realism, I will assume that a photon that impinges on a beam 
splitter has no means of “guessing” the kind of experiment to which it will be 
subjected. Hence, taking into account the possibility of observing interference 
phenomena, I have to assume that the initial wave packet is split into two wave 
packets at the beam splitter. I will then tentatively assume that the wave packets are 
identical in every respect, both being capable of producing a detector click. Since, 
when an anticorrelation experiment is performed, only one detector can and must 
click each time, I also have to assume that some aleatory factors make one detector 
click before the other and that at the same time a signal is sent to prevent the other 
detector from clicking as well. This idea could easily be checked by removing 
one of the detectors; since there would then be no neutralizing signal, the 
remaining detector would detect twice the number of events, as if the photon 
always followed the same path—and this is not physically sound.
An alternative is to assume that the probability of a packet producing a 
click is 1, and that the first packet impinging on a detector sends a message to the 
other packet informing it whether the first packet has been detected or not. If 
detected, the probability that the second packet will produce a click thus drops 
to zero; if not, it jumps to one.
♦Although the terms simple and physically sound may be considered somewhat vague, I think their 
meaning will become quite clear in the present context. Something similar occurs in the interpretation 
of the experimental tests of Bell’s inequalities. We can consider that local realism has been disproved 
z/and only z/the possibility of a conspiracy of nature is discarded. On the other hand, what is meant 
by conspiracy of nature is open to debate.

Gedanken Experiments on Duality
237
Naturally, more complicated situations, involving many polarizers and beam 
splitters, could also be devised. Whenever a detector is not triggered, this 
information will be sent to the other packets and probabilities then readjusted 
appropriately. Although this is a logical possibility, it seems quite unreasonable. 
(As will be shown later, it seems still more unreasonable when nonlocality is taken 
into account.)
I will then assume that the photon wave packet is split into two different wave 
packets upon passing through either a beam splitter or a two-channel polarizer: one 
incapable of producing a detector click and the other capable of doing so, that 
is, an empty and a photonic wave packet. From the standpoint of realism, this is an 
objective fact, independent of any observation or detection. This does not exclude 
the possibility of having the empty and photonic packets recombine after passing 
through a beam splitter or a two-channel polarizer, in accordance with the wave­
like properties of light. I will then adopt the pilot-wave interpretation as introduced 
by de Broglie, according to which(1°)
(a) Light is composed of photons and waves. The latter account for the wave­
like properties of light, while the former, which are “guided” by the 
waves, account for its particle-like properties.
*
*The term photon in (a) is used in the broad sense and does not necessarily imply the existence of a 
localized particle inside the photonic packet.
tActually, local realistic approaches based on experimental limitations are possible/5)
tl will not use the usual v1 and v2 to refer to the photons, since here it does not matter which photon is 
emitted first, but rather which arrives at the polarizer or is detected first. In particular, the source of 
Figure 1 can either be the same as that of Ref. 2 or as that of Ref. 3, in which case the photons are 
emitted simultaneously, v (v') denotes the photon emitted toward the left (right) in the drawing.
3. NONLOCALITY
In the second experiment to be analyzed/2) two correlated photons, v and v', 
are emitted in opposite directions and made to pass through two-channel po­
larizers, with different orientations, before being detected. As has been empha­
sized/1) and experimentally corroborated/11) in order to maintain a realistic 
viewpoint, we must assume some sort of FTL interaction to explain the observed 
correlations, t Consistent with realism, I will assume that this interaction is 
triggered by some physical process. In the present case, there are two possible 
candidates: (1) photon detection at the photomultiplier and (2) splitting of the wave 
packet at the polarizer.
I will then consider a slightly modified version of the experiment in Ref. 2, in 
which one of the detectors is removed (Figure 1)4 Whenever only v' is detected, I 
know (I am considering the ideal case) that v has followed the path that does not 
have a detector, and this can also be taken as a kind of detection. The probabilities

before v’ impinges on pol. II. One of the detectors (which could register photon v) has been removed.
of coincident detections may then be determined. The usual interpretation of 
quantum mechanics says we must obtain the same results we would obtain with the 
detector in place. Therefore, if realism agrees with quantum mechanics on this 
particular point, no detection is needed to trigger the FTL interaction.
*
*It would be interesting to examine the consequences of this conclusion for existent nonlocal realistic 
theories/12)
t Although the photons cannot be observed without the detectors, that they are transmitted or reflected 
at the polarizers can be an objective fact, from the standpoint of realism.
The experiment of Figure 1 deserves closer examination. According to 
quantum mechanics,
p(a, b) = p(a±, 
= lcos2(a, b) 
(la)
and
p(a, bj) = p(a±, b) — |sin2(a, b) 
(lb)
where p(a, is the probability of v' being detected in a polarization state 
perpendicular to b while v is indirectly detected in a polarization state parallel to 
a, and so on. Hence,
p(b) = p(a, b) + p(a±, b) = p(a, bj + p(a±, bj = p(bj = i (2)
as expected. On the other hand, if the FTL interaction is triggered by photon 
detection, we must have
P(a, b) = h, P(a, b±) = 1(1 - 7) 
(3)
where y[(l - y)], the probability of v' being transmitted (reflected) at pol. I, 
must be different from cos2 (a, b) [sin2 (a, &)], since the quantum mechanical 
result cannot be reproduced in this case. (In fact, if all the detectors are removed in 
Figure l,t the other probabilities can also be written in terms of y, and the 

Gedanken Experiments on Duality
239
correlation function calculated. Naturally, Bell’s inequalities would have to be 
satisfied, since we would then have local realism.) On the other hand, the other 
probabilities would still be expressed by (la,b) and (2) would not be satisfied 
anymore. By simply determining the ratio p(Z?)/p(Z>±), we would thus be able to 
know if a distant detector had been removed or not. Superluminal communication 
would then be possible.
An alternative, if we insist on the idea of detection triggering but reject 
superluminal communication, is to reintroduce the supposition that the first packet 
impinging on a detector sends a message to the other packets informing whether 
the first packet has been detected or not. In the present context, however, this idea 
will be still more unreasonable than before. To see this, we need only place a beam 
splitter between the source and the polarizer on the path followed by photon v. 
When the left-hand detector is not triggered, photon v has either been transmitted 
at the polarizer or reflected at the beam splitter. Hence, to obtain the correct 
probabilities of detection, the FTL signal has to force v' into a state such that the 
different possibilities are taken into account. In other words, v’ has to be informed 
about the probabilities of v being transmitted at the polarizer or reflected at the 
beam splitter.
I will then assume that the FTL interaction is triggered whenever the first 
photon of a correlated pair is split at a polarizer into an empty and a photonic 
packet. In this case, to be in perfect agreement with quantum mechanics, we have 
to assume that the second photon is forced into the same state as the first photon. A 
variation of the experiment represented in Figure 2 serves in illustration. In this 
variation, the distance between the source and the polarizers is such that v always 
arrives at pol. I and is detected before v' can reach pol. II. Many different optical 
devices, such as retarders, polarizers, absorbers, and phase shifters, can be placed 
along the two arms of the interferometer. If v is found in a polarization state 
perpendicular to a, for example, and we want to know in which state v' can
FIGURE 2. A source (S) emits a pair of correlated photons (v, v'). The right-hand part of the 
apparatus consists of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer which allows light reaching pol. Ill to be found 
in the same polarization state as when it reached pol. II. The distance from pol. I to the source can be 
varied, as can be the orientations of pol. I and HI.

Luiz Carlos Ryff
be found at 5, and with what probability, we need only assume that v' impinges on 
pol. II in the same state in which v was found (i.e., perpendicular to a) and then 
apply our knowledge of wave optics.
In the usual approach, the previous conclusion is correct only when v is in fact 
detected at 1 while according to my approach it is correct whenever splitting at the 
polarizer forces v into a polarization state perpendicular to a, even if no detection 
occurs. I will then assume that
(b) When the first photon wave packet of a correlated pair is split at a two- 
channel polarizer into an empty and a photonic packet, the second photon 
wave packet is forced into the same polarization state as that of the 
photonic packet.
*
In other words, when the first photon of a correlated pair is forced into a 
certain polarization state upon passing through a polarizer, the second one is 
forced into the same state.
4. COMBINING EXPERIMENTS ON NONLOCALITY AND WAVE­
PARTICLE DUALITY
To make predictions for the experiment represented in Figure 2, some extra 
assumptions are needed. We have to consider whether (and in which circum­
stances) the passage of the first photon of a correlated pair through a polarizer is a 
reversible or an irreversible process, insofar as after this passage whatever happens 
to either one of the distant photons may or may not influence the other. In order to 
clarify this point, I will initially discuss the simple experiment represented in 
Figure 3. The distances between the source and the polarizers are such that we are 
certain that v' will reach pol. Ill before v reaches pol. I. In this case, if v' is 
detected at 3, v impinges on pol. I in a polarization state parallel to b, since v' has 
passed through pol. II before reaching pol. III. Naturally, at least in the case in 
which the empty and photonic waves do not recombine, the following conclusion 
can be drawn:
(c) Whatever may happen to either one of the photonic packets following the 
process described in (b), this will have no effect on the other, distant 
photonic packet.
♦Actually, assumption (b) applies only to entangled states of the same type, as that produced in the 
experiments of Ref. 2, for example. In the case of the decay of the positronium/13) the second photon 
would be forced into a state orthogonal to that of the photonic packet. Naturally, (b) can be adapted for 
experiments using one-channel polarizers.

241
FIGURE 3. A source (S) emits a pair of correlated photons (v, v'). Lx > L3, where Lx (L3) is the 
distance from pol. I (III) to the source.
In an attempt to maintain complete agreement with the usual predictions of 
quantum mechanics, we could assume, in the case of the experiment represented 
in Figure 2, that (c) does not apply when the photonic and empty packets are 
recombined. However, this assumption is not in itself sufficient for achieving the 
aforementioned agreement, as can be seen from the experiment represented in 
Figure 4. According to the usual approach, when the removable mirror (RM) is 
not in place and path 3 is freed, (F24)Q (RM removed) = 0, where P24 is the 
probability of detecting v at 2 and v' at 4. This result, easily derived from quantum 
mechanical formalism, can be inferred from the fact that the correlation state is 
such that v and v' must be found in the same polarization state. Now I will consider 
the situation in which a photonic packet follows path 2 and an empty one, path 1. 
According to (b), v' will reach pol. II in a polarization state perpendicular to a, and 
as a consequence, no empty wave will propagate along path 3. Hence, when v 
follows path 2, it is irrelevant whether path 3 is blocked or not, since there is no 
empty wave propagating along path 3 to recombine with the photonic wave 
propagating along path 4. But if path 3 is blocked—and we can see that things 
happen as if it were—the same conclusion (c), derived from the experiment in
FIGURE 4. A source (S) emits a pair of correlated photons (v,v'). The apparatus consists of two 
Mach-Zehnder interferometers, which allow light reaching pol. m (IV) to be found in the same 
polarization state as when it reached pol. I (II). The distances are such that v impinges on pol. I before 
vf can reach pol. II, and v' impinges on pol. IV before v can reach pol. in. R.M. is a removable mirror, 
which allows us to perform two kinds of experiments: with the R.M. in place and with it removed.

242
Luiz Carlos Ryff
Figure 3, would be valid. A similar line of reasoning is valid when v follows 
path 1. Therefore, we would obtain (P24)R (RM removed) = (F24)R (path 3 
blocked) +(F24)^ (path 4 blocked) #= 0, in strong disagreement with the quantum 
mechanical result.
Although in principle, since there is simply no empty wave to recombine in 
the above experiment, it could be used to test nonlocal realism, even if assumption 
(c) does not hold when the photonic and empty waves recombine, in reality some 
questions may be raised. I have been discussing an ideal situation but the photons 
actually are not perfectly correlated and the polarizers display some degree of 
leakage. How correlated will v and v' be in this case, after the waves recombine? 
Strictly speaking, from the standpoint of realism and considering our present 
knowledge, this kind of question can only be answered through experimentation. 
However, some inferences are possible. We can imagine different situations in the 
experiment of Figure 4, such that pol. I and II do not have the same orientation. 
The intensities of the empty and photonic waves on the arms of the right-hand 
interferometer can thus be varied. If the usual quantum mechanical results are still 
observed, we may conclude that relative intensity has no effect on these results. 
However, relative intensity can also be varied by placing an absorber along one 
of the arms of the interferometer and maintaining the initial orientations of the 
polarizers. The results obtained would then differ from the previous ones. For 
example, if v' is detected in a polarization state parallel to b, v is not forced into 
the same state, thus contradicting the previous conclusion. We may then compli­
cate the model still further by imaging that a FTL signal travels backward along the 
arms of the interferometer, and what these signals find on their way is what affects 
the results. For instance, one signal may or may not impinge on an absorber, 
depending on the experiment that is being performed, and this will change the 
experimental outcome. A little reflection shows that the signal would have to be 
endowed with properties similar in some respects to those of the usual electro­
magnetic waves. In principle, this possibility could be tested by placing Pockels 
cells on the paths of the photons, for example, so that the wave following one of the 
two possible paths (either 3 or 4) is blocked, while the signal traveling backward is 
allowed to pass.
*
♦An experiment on the same line, in which the photon paths are intercepted by strong laser beams, has 
been proposed/14) Although not devised with this intention, the experiment of Ref. 11, using 
acousto-optical switches, might help to clarify this point. However, the experiment cannot be 
considered conclusive, since we can always imagine that the FTL signal follows backward along the 
path left by the photon, not being acted on by the switches. It might be interesting to perform an 
experiment in which a Faraday rotator is placed on the path followed by v'. Since in this case the 
direction of rotation of the plane of polarization does not depend on the direction of propagation of the 
impinging light, different results from those predicted by quantum mechanics would be obtained 
whenever v' is detected before v has reached Pol. I, if the possible FTL signal indeed has properties 
similar to those of the usual electromagnetic waves. From a practical viewpoint, this experiment has 
the advantage of not requiring any kind of switch.

Gedanken Experiments on Duality
243
The above digression is intended to show that even more cumbersome 
hypotheses are in principle testable. However, from a conceptual standpoint, it 
would appear more consistent to assume that (c) is valid even when the empty and 
photonic waves recombine. In other words, after the process described in (b), the 
two-photon system is found to be in a disentangled state that can no longer be 
changed back into an entangled state. This possibility is akin to the concept of 
collapse of state vector. However, in a realistic approach this disentanglement is 
an objective fact, whether it is observed or not. This will be discussed in detail 
in the next section.
5. TESTING THE PROPOSED APPROACH
I will discuss the experiment represented in Figure 2, assuming perfect 
correlation and polarizers but considering that not all photons are collected and 
that available detectors are far from ideal. This will not place any essential 
restriction on conclusions, since available polarizers and the observed correlated 
states for the angle usually subtended by the collecting lenses are very near ideal. 
On the other hand, the realistic approach yields results that strongly disagree with 
the usual interpretation of quantum mechanics.
Two different situations will be considered. In the first, the distances between 
the source and the polarizers are such that photon v impinges on pol I before v' has 
reached pol. II. The interferometer is designed so that v' impinges on pol. Ill in 
the same polarization state in which it impinges on pol. II. I will calculate the 
probabilities P23 and P24 of coincident detection. The quantum mechanical result 
can be obtained in a straightforward manner, which, as a consequence of 
assumption (b), is also valid for the realistic approach. Let/(/') be the probabil­
ity of v (v') entering the left (right) collimating system; let t] (if) be the effi­
ciency of the left (right) detectors, and let g' (g) be the probability of v' (v) 
entering the right (left) collimating system if v (v') has entered the left (right) 
collimating system. The probability of v being found in a polarization state 
parallel to a is 1; v' is then forced into the same polarization state. Since the 
probability of v' reaching pol. Ill is 1, using Malus’s law it follows that
(p23>2 = (p23)/e = bn'/#'cos2 (a, c) 
(4a)
= <P24>/? = hl’n'/?'sin2 (a,<?) 
(4b)
Hence,
= tan2 (a, c)
(5)
where R23 and R24 are the measurable detection rates.

244
Luiz Carlos Ryff
In the second situation to be considered, the distances between the source and 
the polarizers are such that photon v impinges on pol. I after v' has reached pol. IL 
Looked at from the usual standpoint, the situation must still be the same. Hence, 
according to (4a,b)
P'24\
P23/Q
^23 /Q
= tan2 (a, c)
(6)
On the other hand, if assumption (c) holds true, we are faced with a new situation. 
Let A(b, c) [B(b, c)] be the probability of v' being transmitted at pol. Ill when 
it follows path 1 (2). Summing the probabilities arriving at using (b) and (c) (which 
represent two mutually exclusive possibilities), we easily obtain
*
*A calculation in terms of hidden variables can be found in Ref. 7.
(p23)/? = 
c)cos2(a, b) + B(b, c)sin2(a, b)} 
(7) 
since v is forced into a state parallel (perpendicular) to b when v' is transmitted 
(reflected) at pol. II. Similarly, let A'(b, c) [B'(b, <?)] be the probability of v' being 
reflected at pol. Ill when it follows path 1 (2). Hence,
(p24)/e = 
c)cos2(a,/>) + B'(b, c) sin2 (a,6)] 
(8)
Since light impinging on pol. Ill is in a totally unpolarized state, then
A(b, c) + B(b, c) = A'(b, c) + B'(b, c) 
(9)
Formulas (7) and (8) conflict with (4a,b). In particular, when angle (a, b) = 45°, 
using (9) we obtain 
(10)
independent of angle (a,c) and in disagreement with (6).
6. ANOTHER POSSIBLE EXPERIMENT
Assumptions (b) and (c) cannot deal with all imaginable situations. In 
particular, the experiment represented in Figure 5 raises curious and interesting 
questions. The interferometer is designed in such a way that the parallel compo­
nents of the incident beam following direction 4 (5) via path 1 and 2 interact 
constructively (destructively). The perpendicular component reaching beam split-

FIGURE 5. A source (S) emits a pair of correlated photons (v, v'). The right-hand part of the 
apparatus consists of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer with pol. II located along one of its arms, 
allowing light following direction 5 to be found perpendicularly polarized to direction b.
ter 2 (BS 2) via path 2 is distributed equally in directions 4 and 5. As a conse­
quence, photon v' following direction 5 is always found in a polarization state 
perpendicular to direction b.
I will only consider the following sequence of events, which suffices to clarify 
the kind of question a nonlocal realistic approach may raise: (1) v' impinges on 
BS 1 and is split. A photonic wave packet follows path 2 and an empty one follows 
path 1 and is split at pol. II. (2) After that, v is detected at 2. Assuming (and 
this can be experimentally verified) that neither the splitting of v' at BS 1 nor the 
splitting of the empty wave packet at pol. II disentangles the two-photon state, v' is 
then forced into a polarization state perpendicular to a, according to (b).
What happens to the empty wave jacket following path 1? To simplify the 
reasoning, I will consider that a = b. If nothing happens, then, according 
to (a), when the beams following paths 1 and 2 recombine at BS 2, there is a 
nonnull probability that v' will be found at 5 not in a polarization state perpendicu­
lar to b. since the beams are in mutually orthogonal polarization states. Hence, by 
simply observing the polarization state of the photon following direction 5, we 
are able to infer whether v has been made to pass through a polarizer or not. A 
superluminal telegraph might be conceived in this manner.
An alternative, albeit a complicated one, is to assume that the splitting of v 
also changes the state of the empty wave packet in such a way that things happen 
as if v' had already been in a state of polarization perpendicular to a prior 
to impinging on BS 1. When a = b, the amplitude of the empty wave packet 
following path 1, which has already passed the polarizer, thus suddenly drops to 
zero. When a ¥= b, the amplitude will have to be modified appropriately in order to 
ensure that v' will always be found at 5 in a polarization state perpendicular to b.
Therefore, the combination of a FTL interaction with the pilot-wave concept 
leads to a situation in which superluminal communication cannot be discarded 

246
Luiz Carlos Ryff
a priori. This should be viewed as a natural conclusion since, if we accept a FTL 
interaction, superluminal communication becomes an open possibility. Moreover, 
to accept a FTL interaction we have only to accept quantum mechanical non­
locality and the existence of a real external world with definite properties—and 
these can hardly be considered bizarre ideas. Conversely, we may interpret the 
proposed experiment as an attempt to determine the consequences of assuming 
that superluminal communication is impossible, in a nonlocal realistic approach. 
As seems to become evident, from the standpoint of realism this kind of question 
can only be answered through experimentation.
7. COMPARISON WITH CONCRETE SITUATIONS
As was underscored in Section 5, the results then obtained would not have 
been essentially any different if imperfect correlation and polarizers had been 
assumed. Nevertheless, it is not immediately obvious how assumption (b) can be 
extended to make it consistent with quantum mechanical nonlocality in nonideal 
situations. Thus, it is important, at least for conceptual reasons, to try to clarify 
this point. This section shows how this can be done.
To indicate the degree of correlation between two photons, I will introduce 
the pair correlation coefficient, a, whose value can vary from zero to one. To make 
this point clear, I will initially consider the ideal case of perfect polarizers. I will 
assume that if the first photon wave packet of a correlated pair is split into an empty 
and a photonic packet upon passing through a polarizer, and if the pair correlation 
coefficient is a, then a fraction a of the second photon wave packet is forced 
into the same polarization state as the photonic packet, and a fraction (1 — a) 
remains unpolarized.
*
 When a = 1, there is a perfect correlation; when a = 0 
there is no correlation at all.
I will consider only the pairs of photons actually reaching the polarizers. Let 
p0(a) da be the probability of the pair correlation coefficient falling between a 
and a + da, where 9 is the half-angle subtended by the collecting lenses. Then
S^P^da = 1 
(11)
When 9 = 0, there is a perfect correlation: p0(l) = 1, p0(a #= 1) = 0; but a null 
probability of detecting a photon J15)
In concrete situations, the packet will emerge from the polarizer in a partially 
polarized state. Then, if a fraction p of the photonic packet is in a polarized state, 
a fraction pa of the second wave packet will be forced into the same polarization
♦In a hidden-variables approach, we have to assume that a fraction a is forced into a polarization state 
and a fraction (1 — a) remains in the same initial hidden-variables state.

state as the fraction p of the photonic packet, and a fraction 1 — pa will remain 
unpolarized. Thus, assumption (b) can be substituted by assumption:
(b') When the first photon wave packet of a correlated pair whose pair 
correlation coefficient is a is split at a polarizer into an empty and a 
photonic wave packet such that a fraction p of the photonic packet is 
polarized, the second photon wave packet is forced into a partially 
polarized state such that a fraction pa is in the same polarization state 
as that of the photonic packet.
I will now show how the pair correlation coefficient a can be related to the 
usual correlation coefficient F(0), present in the expression for the probability 
of coincident detections that are used in experimental tests of Bell’s inequalities. 
In the experiment discussed in Refs. 1 and 15, two correlated photons, Vj and v2, 
impinge on one-channel polarizers oriented parallel to a (pol. I) and b (pol. II), 
respectively. Let and (e^ and ep be the transmittances of the first (second) 
polarizer for light polarized parallel and perpendicular to the polarizer axis. 
Hence, p^a) and p2(b), the probabilities of Vj and v2 being detected, are
Px(a) = 
(12a)
and
p2(b) = b\2fA 
(12b)
where fx (/2) is the probability of (v2) reaching pol. I (II), Tij (t]2) is the effi­
ciency of the first (second) photomultiplier, and
= eL ± e*, e2 = eL ± e* 
(13)
The incident beam can be decomposed into two incoherent components, one 
parallel and the other perpendicular to the axis of the polarizer. A fraction (em) 
of the parallel (perpendicular) component is transmitted at the polarizer. Hence, 
formulas (12a,b) follow naturally from assumption (a) of Section 2, since the 
probability of vr (v2) being transmitted at pol. I (II) is e^/2 (e^_/2). Part of the 
parallel component combines with the perpendicular component, producing an 
unpolarized component. Thus, the fraction of the beam emerging from pol. I in a 
polarization state parallel to a is p = 
. A fraction pa of the second beam is
then forced into a state parallel to 3, and a fraction (1 — pa) =(€+ — €£a)/ey 
remains unpolarized. The component parallel to a can be decomposed into 
components parallel and perpendicular to b. Using Malus’s law plus the definition 
of eM and em, we see that the fraction of the component parallel to a that is 
transmitted at pol. II is (e^cos2 + e2 sin2 0), where 0 = angle (a, b). Since the 

248
Luiz Carlos Ryff
fraction of the unpolarized component that is transmitted at pol. II is e^/2, the 
probability of coincident detection as a function of a can be written as
p(a, b, ol) =
cl Fpl 
cl — cl (v
^fa(€ifCos2<I> + e2 sin2O) + + 
(14)
where g is the conditional probability. (14) can be rewritten:
p{a, b, a) = Jn1'n2/i£(€+e+ + aeLel cos 20) 
(15)
Multiplying (15) by pe(a)da and integrating, using (11), we obtain the usual 
result^1’15)
p(a, b) = iq1'n2/i«(€+e+ + F(0)eL€2 cos20) 
(16)
where the correlation coefficient, F(0), is related to the mean value of a, through 
relation

(17)
It is also not obvious how assumption (c) can be modified when nonideal 
polarizers are considered. It is not strictly correct that whatever may happen to 
either one of the photons following the process described in (b') will have no ef­
fect on the other, distant photon. This becomes clear when we realize that if Vj 
passes through two crossed polarizers (which is possible—although rare—in 
cases of real, imperfect polarizers) it will be found in a totally unpolarized state, 
and according to the usual approach the same must be true for v2. From a real­
istic standpoint, this raises some questions, which will not be discussed here and 
whose clarification would call for new experiments.
8. NONLOCALITY AND RELATIVITY
From the standpoint of special relativity, quantum mechanics raises some 
problems. As stressed by Dirac, nonlocality is against the spirit of relativity/16) 
Even if we do not adhere to realism, the usual view presents a conceptual
♦Naturally, the present derivation also applies to experiments using two-channel polarizers. Instead of 
and €m, we would use transmission (7l,Tl) and reflection (/?H,2?-L) coefficients. The theoretical 
determination of F(0) falls outside the scope of the present approach, which is not intended to 
substitute quantum mechanics.

difficulty. To show this, I will again consider the experiment represented in Fig­
ure 1 but with all four polarizers. In the laboratory frame, v is detected before 
v'. Let the detections of v and v' be two events separated by a space-like interval. 
We can then consider another inertial frame, moving in the same direction as v' 
and such that in it v' is detected before v. For an observer in the first frame, 
measuring the state of v forces v' into a definite polarization state. Hence, v' 
impinges on pol. II in a definite polarization state. Since the Lorentz transforma­
tion connecting the two frames does not change the polarization state of v', the 
observer in the laboratory frame is able to infer that the same conclusion is valid 
for an observer in the moving frame. But for the second observer, it is measuring 
the state of v' that forces v into a definite polarization state. Hence, he concludes 
that v' impinges on pol. II in an unpolarized state, since to him, when v' im­
pinges on pol. II the system is still in an entangled state and therefore v' is in 
no definite polarization state. Although this is only a conceptual contradiction, 
with no observable consequences, it is a contradiction. The point is that measuring 
the state of one of the photons of a correlated pair does not inform us as to the state 
the other photon was in before the measurement; it forces the other photon into a 
definite state. Even if we adhere to the usual interpretation of quantum mechanics, 
this seems difficult to understand if we do not accept some FTL interaction. If we 
do accept this notion, however, it is important to know when the interaction is 
triggered. This is indeed crucial and, as has been shown in this chapter, may have 
far-reaching consequences. It seems that any attempt to clarify the foundations of 
quantum mechanics will necessarily have ramifications on the special theory of 
relativity. For example, it seems that a privileged frame, where one of the photons 
is really detected before the other, would have to be introduced. Physicists, 
however, react strongly to this idea. According to Bell/17) this possible frame 
might be an undetectable one. However, if we find a privileged frame difficult to 
swallow, a privileged, although undetectable frame is even harder to digest. 
Naturally, if we admit the existence of a privileged frame, the very reason for 
assuming a principle of relativity is eroded. There is no a priori reason why this 
frame should remain undetected. Therefore, while risking being regarded with 
suspicion by some of my colleagues, I will advocate Poincare’s viewpoint, 
according to which the relativity principle is an experimental fact and as such 
susceptible to endless revision/18) Perhaps we eventually discover that the 
Lorentzian point of view is more correct than the Einsteinian/19)
Some of my predictions seem to conflict with the special theory of relativity. 
For instance, the experiment proposed in Section 5 considered two situations. 
In the first (second), v impinges on pol. I before (after) v' reaches pol. II. Since the 
arrivals of each photon at each polarizer can be events separated by a space-like 
interval, ascertaining which event occurred first will depend on the frame used to 
describe the experiment. Quantum mechanical formalism, as usually interpreted, 
predicts the same probabilities for both situations [formula (6)], in agreement 
with the special theory of relativity. My approach, on the other hand, predicts two 

250
Luiz Carlos Ryff
different probabilities [formulas (5) and (10)]. As also pointed out in Section 6, 
in a realistic approach, FTL communication cannot be discarded a priori.
Nevertheless, my approach is not necessarily incompatible with special 
relativity. In the experiment in Section 6, if the splitting of v' at BS 1 disentangles 
the two-photon state, or if the splitting of v at pol. I changes the state of the empty 
waves on the interferometer, no superluminal communication is possible. More­
over, if the privileged frame in which the probabilities are to be calculated turns 
out to be the frame in which the source is at rest, there would not, strictly 
speaking, be just one privileged frame but many—one for each source. Thus, to 
correctly calculate the probabilities, we would have to know the velocity of the 
source. This is a perfectly relativistic condition.
In my opinion, quantum nonlocality raises problems that cannot simply be 
ignored. Thus, it is important to adopt a coherent approach with consequences that 
can be experimentally investigated.
9. EXTENDING THE APPROACH TO THE CASE OF MOMENTUM 
CORRELATED PHOTONS
Nonlocality has also been verified in the case of momentum correlated 
photons/20) I will now briefly outline how to extend my approach to make it 
testable here as well, based on an experiment that has recently been proposed^21) 
and that appears in an expanded version in Figure 6 J22> Phase shifters <!>]. and <&2; 
beam splitters Hx and //2; mirrors MA, MB, Mc, and MD; and detectors Uv Lv 
U2, and L2 are used in the original experiment. The quantum mechanical 
probabilities of coincident detections will be
p(t/p (/2|4>p $2) = p(Li, L2|0»p <I>2) = 
+ cos(<I>2 - 4>j + 0)] 
(18a)
and
P(t7p L2|<Dp <I>2) = p(Lp t/2|0»p 0>2) = 
- cos (<&2 - 0», + 0)] 
(18b)
where p(Ul, 4* 2) is the probability of detecting photon 1 at Ul and photon 
2 at U2, and <b2 are the phase shifts, 0 depends on the detailed placement of the 
mirrors and beam splitters, and r| is the quantum efficiency of the detectors. 
A Bell’s inequality can be written and (18a,b) used to show that it is violated by 
quantum mechanics, characterizing a nonclassical correlation. As before, I will 
assume a FTL interaction. In this case, a measurement to determine the path 
followed by one of the photons modifies the beams associated to the other photon, 
establishing a definite phase different between them. To exemplify, I will consider 
the ideal situation in which <J>2 — 
+ 0 = 0. For instance, if photon 2 is de­
tected at U2, beams A and D acquire a phase difference such that no beam will

follow the path leading to Lv in agreement with (18). According to my approach, 
this should be taken as evidence that no empty wave will follow this path. Now, 
assuming (Section 3) that no detection can trigger the FTL interaction, it has to be 
triggered by the splitting and recombination of the beams at the beam splitter.
The experiment in Figure 6 is similar to that in Figure 4, Section 4.1 will also 
assume in the present case that the triggering of the action disentangles the two- 
photon state (as in the former case, there is no empty wave to recombine with the 
photonic wave). Therefore, using reasoning similar to that in Section 4, we are 
able to infer that the probabilities of coincident detections do not depend on d>3 
and <&4, in a realistic approach, while according to the usual approach they do. In 
other words, according to the usual quantum mechanical approach, photon 1 
follows both paths F and G at the same time, so to speak, but according to the 
realistic approach it will follow either one or the other, and this leads to different 
predictions.

1. EXPERIMENTS SHOWING THE INTERFERENCE OF INDEPENDENT 
PHOTON BEAMS
Interference effects produced by the superposition of the light beams from two 
independent single-mode lasers take place even under conditions in which the light 
intensities are so low that, with high probability, one photon is absorbed before the 
next one is emitted by one or the other source. This was first demonstrated by 
Pfleegor and Mandel. 0) Their experimental setup is shown in Figure 1. From two 
independent, single-mode He-Ne lasers, light beams with aligned polarization are 
passed through two attenuators and superimposed at the interference detector R. A 
part of the beam is split off at the unsilvered glass plates Mj and M2 and passed 
through a pinhole to photomultiplier C. This photo tube functions to register the 
difference frequency of the two lasers in the form of a beat note. The interference 
detector R is only activated when the beat frequency falls below 50 kc/s. The 
interference could only be observed in time intervals on the order or less than the 
frequency spread of the light, in practice about 20 |is for the used lasers. Since the 
average number of photons registered per trial was only about 10, correlation 
techniques were required to demonstrate the interference.
The interference pattern was received on a stack of thin glass plates, each of 
which had a thickness corresponding to about half a fringe width. The plates 
were so arranged that light falling on the 1st, 3rd, 5th, etc. plate was reaching

photo tube A only, and light falling on the even-numbered plates (2, 4, 6, etc.) fed 
photomultiplier B only. If the half fringe spacing coincides with the plate 
thickness, the number of counts registered by one of the photomultipliers should 
increase, while the counting rate at the other detector should decrease. So a 
negative correlation between the number of counts of channels A and B is to be 
expected if there is interference between the two independent photon beams. The 
rather low statistical accuracy of the experiment allowed the existence of the ef­
fect to be proven with only four measured values of the correlation coefficient 2-3 
standard deviations away from the no-interference line. Therefore, Pfleegor and 
Mandel(2) repeated the experiment in a modified form to achieve much higher 
accuracy. This time the correlation coefficient was found about 10 times to be 5-10 
standard deviations away from the no-interference line. The results are shown in 
Figure 2. The existence of low-intensity interference was so established beyond 
any doubt.
Other authors have reported the interference of independent photon beams. 
Radloff,<3> for example, produced independent confirmation by recording many 
times the interference pattern (produced again by two independent single-mode

He-Ne lasers) when it was standing for a short time at the same position on the 
recorder. Vain’shtein et alS^ repeated the experiment by using a different corre­
lation method analogous to the classical Hanbury-Brown-Twiss method. New 
methods and a different optical system of the interferometer not only confirmed 
the occurrence of the interference found by Pfleegor and Mandel, but also enabled 
the Russian group to determine directly the interference pattern at much lower 
intensities.
It seemed that with these observations a famous statement of Dirac(5) that 
“. . . each photon interferes only with itself. Interference between different pho­
tons never occurs” was disproved. However, Pfleegor and Mandel were also able:
1. To reproduce their experimental results with a theoretical calculation 
broadly deduced from that quantum field theory that Dirac had developed 
coherently with his general point of view;
2. To interpret the low-intensity interference effect by stressing that the 
localization of a photon at a detector necessarily makes it intrinsically 
uncertain from which of the two lasers it came. Thus, if the photon wave 
function represents only our knowledge of the photon behavior, it is 

256
Michael Schmidt
natural to add two wave functions corresponding to the arrival of each 
detected photon from the two lasers. The squared modulus of this sum 
would then contain the observed interference effect.
Andrade e Silva and de Broglie<6> gave another interpretation of the Pfleegor 
and Mandel experiment. For them a photon is a dual structure: particle and 
wave. By particle they mean a very small object that is constantly localized in 
space. The wave is nothing but an undulatory phenomenon propagating in 
ordinary three-dimensional space. Therefore, the de Broglie photon, in agreement 
with Einstein’s picture/7) is a very small region of high concentration of energy 
which is embodied in a wave in which it constitutes some kind of moving 
singularity.
With these ideas another explanation of Pfleegor and Mandel’s observations is 
possible. The two lasers continuously emit two undulatory beams, which intersect 
and interfere with one another in the region R, there giving rise to interference 
maxima. If one of the two lasers emits a photon, then it will be guided by the 
wave to reach with larger probability those parts of R where the total wave 
amplitude is larger. If many photons are falling on a screen S inserted into the 
region R, the interference pattern becomes visible.
This means that a particle coming from one laser could interact not only with 
the wave with which it was born, but with a different wave arising from a different 
laser as well. The particle is thus guided by the sum of the two electromagnetic 
waves:
A<»(x,y,z,0 + A^>(x,y,z,t)
where Ajp is the four-potential describing the wave emitted from the ith laser 
(i = 1,2) and x,y,z are the coordinates of the particle at time t. Such a conclusion 
is both absolutely necessary and very natural in the Einstein-de Broglie picture of 
quantum phenomena, if the Pfleegor-Mandel experiment has to be explained. It 
is, however, in contradiction with the standard quantum-mechanical description of 
wave functions of different quantum objects as belonging to different vector 
spaces and thus are unable to exert any mutual influence.
2. FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS OF THE IDEA OF EMPTY WAVES
The Einstein-de Broglie idea of the reality of particle and wave not only 
holds for photons, but also for all other quantum objects (e.g., electrons, neu­
trons). To the particle are “attached” the fundamental physical attributes of 
energy, momentum, and mass, while the wave probably does not carry them at all 
and for this reason is called “empty,” when one is dealing with a wave packet not 
containing its particle.

Wind Effect of Empty Quantum Waves
257
Selleri(8) developed from this the idea to test the empty wave concept in 
stimulated emission. Croca(9) was the first who attached this idea to a testable 
experimental setup for other than photonic particles, neutrons. Croca’s ideas were 
developed by Croca, Garuccio, and Selleri/10) who formulated the basic assump­
tion as follows:
A neutronic particle propagating in a region of space where several neutronic 
wave packets of the same frequency are simultaneously present interacts 
locally with their sum
0 = 
+ 02 + • • • + 
(1)
through the quantum potential
even when the waves come from different sources. This interaction has the 
effect, over the statistical ensemble, that the density of the particles becomes 
proportional to |<t>|2.
This I call the CGS (Croca-Garuccio-Selleri) assumption.
Schmidt and Seller^11) have shown that the last part of this assumption is not 
true in general. They considered the triple-slit experiment of Figure 3 where a 
fourth slit is constantly closed by the particle detector D2, another detector 
being used for scanning the frequency of arrivals on the “second screen. ” l\vo 
incoherent sources X} and X2 emit quantum objects of the same nature (electrons, 
neutrons, etc.) and of the same energy, so that the quantum waves emitted by the 
two sources have the same frequency. The sources are assumed to have a low 
intensity of emission, i.e., quantum objects are emitted one at a time at widely 
separated time intervals. Emission from the upper source Xj can hit on the upper 
slit only: From this slit a cylindrical wave will be emitted to the right, 
sometimes together with a particle. Only cases in which this particle is observed 
by detector will interest us, and these only in coincidence with a second particle 
detection in D2. It was shown in Ref. 11 that these DjD2 coincidences are coupled 
very often to the emergence of two empty waves <|)2 and <|)3 from the second and 
third slit of Figure 3, respectively, if the intensity of X2 is taken to be much smaller 
(e.g., 100 times smaller) than that of X! and if a suitable shutter is set in front of 
X2. For details concerning the experimental apparatus I refer the reader to Ref. 13. 
What matters here is that in the subset of events that is of interest a particle 
emerges from the first slit of Fig. 3 in conjunction with its associated wave 
while very often only two empty waves <t>2 and 4>3 emerge from the other open slits.
The particle distribution at the second screen can be calculated in three 
different ways:

258

FIGURE 3. Triple-slit experiment for the 
detection of empty waves. The two inco­
herent sources and X2 emit quantum 
objects of the same nature. Since only 
coincident events of the detectors Dj and 
D2 are registered, and given the very 
different intensity of the two sources, 
very often empty waves are coming from 
the two lower slits while a wave plus a 
particle are coming from the upper slit.
1. The first one is merely the probabilistic Bom interpretation of the wave 
function
Pi = l4>il2
(3)
In this approach the waves are only mathematical tools for the calculation 
of probabilities and have otherwise no objective existence: when a 
particle is detected in D2 the waves <f>2 and <f>3 go instantaneously to zero 
(“reduction of the wave function”), whence (3).
2. The second is linked to the causal interpretation of quantum mechanics, 
according to which all waves (fjp <b2, and 4>3 are objectively real, but also 
based on the CGS assumption expressed by Eqs. (1) and (2). It leads to

the second equality being a consequence of the incoherent nature of the 
two sources used in Figure 3.

In most cases Pj = p2 = p3, as will be shown in the next section. It was 
Croca(9) who first made the assumption that there are cases where Pj is not equal 
to p2. Concrete calculations were made in parallel by Croca, Garuccio, and 
Lepore(12) for photons, and by Schmidt and Selleri<13> for electrons. The last named 
authors were also able to show that cases also exist where p2 is not equal to p3. 
This is shown in Figure 4a and 4b. Figure 4a compares pj and p2, and Figure 4b p2 
and p3. The fact that the particles are not able to fill the whole region of space 
which would be expected with the calculation of p2, we call wind effect. It seems 
that particle trajectories are “blown away” from a part of this region. This is a new 
feature for particle trajectories, consistent with the pictures of Dewdney et alSi4> 
and of the next section where even in the normal double-slit experiment the 
particle trajectories are not allowed to cross each other. A description of the 
experimental setup for Figure 3 is given in Ref. 13, while a detailed description of 
the numerical method is contained in Ref. 15. The difference between pl and p3 
will be used to show that empty waves can be detected in a Pfleegor-Mandel-type 
experiment for electrons. The difference from the original Pfleegor-Mandel 
experiment is not only the use of electrons instead of photons, but also the use of 
two incoherent sources.
3. THE NORMAL DOUBLE-SLIT EXPERIMENT
The normal double slit experiment was designed by Thomas Young and is 
found in nearly every textbook of quantum mechanics. The experiment was first 
realized in 1959 by Mollenstedt and Jonsson^16) for electrons, a fact that sometimes 
seems to be unknown/17^ A first attempt at a causal interpretation was made by 
Dewdney et alSi4> They used a new technique of drawing particle trajectories 
using the guidance formula of de Broglie. I have repeated their calculations (see 
Figure 5a) and my results are in good agreement with those of Ref. 14. Further­
more, the distribution at the second screen agrees with that to be expected from 
the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics. Instead the authors of 
Ref. 14 did not show explicitly the distribution p at the screen.
I calculated the particle density at the screen in the three different ways 
explained in the previous section. The results are shown in Figure 5b. In this case 
there is no different between pp p2 (solid line), and p3 (asterisks), where p3 
is obtained by the summation over 8000 particle arrivals at the screen. For the 
calculations of p3 a Multi-Channel-Analyzer-Simulator was constructed with a 
channel width of 0.00002 cm. Particle trajectory arrivals were summed in the 
channels and the intensity was plotted. The starting point of each trajectory behind 
the first slit was calculated with a random number generator giving Gaussian 
distributed random numbers. For details see Ref. 15. The experimental input 
parameters have been taken from Ref. 14.

4. DOUBLE-SLIT EXPERIMENT WITH TWO INCOHERENT SOURCES
For more than 60 years the double-slit problem has been considered to be 
completely solved. The experimental results obtained by Mollenstedt and Jons- 
son(16) for electrons, and by Zeilinger et alSl*>  for neutrons have produced striking 
agreements with the quantum theoretical predictions. At the same time the causal 
interpretation of quantum mechanics has constantly led to predictions identical to 
those of the Copenhagen interpretation. From this, many people got the idea that 
the causal interpretation is at most of philosophical interest and cannot give any 
new prediction at the empirical level. It is the aim of the present chapter to show 
that the situation has evolved in a very interesting way: after the results obtained 
in Refs. 8-10,12,13, one can now discriminate the causal from the Copenhagen 
“interpretation” of quantum mechanics.
Starting with the results of Ref. 13 a double-slit experiment was designed (see 
Figure 6) as follows: Two sources Si and S2 should emit the same kind of particles, 
which in our picture are always accompanied by a wave. We have chosen these 
quantum objects to be electrons because we wanted to compare our results with 
those of Ref. 14. As one can see, a particle in conjunction with its associated wave 
coming from the lower source S2 can go through two slits. One is permanently 
closed by a particle detector D2. We are only interested in coincidence events 
where particles are detected in Dj and D2, that means: from the lower slit only 
empty waves are emitted while from the upper slit a particle plus a wave are 
arriving at the detector. The two sources emit wave packets with coherence length I 
FIGURE 6. A modified Pfleegor-Mandel experiment, where two waves of two different sources 
should interact. The difference with respect to the original Pfleegor and Mandel experiment is that the 
two sources and S2 are not in phase and since only DjD2 coincidences are registered the empty wave 
concept can be tested. Given the large difference in the intensities of the two sources, and according to 
the causal interpretation, a wave with its accompanying particle should emerge from the upper slit 
while an empty wave comes from the lower slit in the very large majority of the considered events.

equal to their physical length. But I must be known from previous measure­
ments, as well as the group velocity u. In such conditions, every wave packet will 
take a time At = Hu to cross any given point. Precisely this At defines the 
coincidence time. If D2 fires at time t2, then must fire at time L/u + At/2 later, 
if the double detection is to be counted as a true coincidence from electronics (L 
is the distance between the two screens). This definition of “coincidence” 
guarantees that the waves accompanying the two particles detected by Dj and D2 
overlap in the region in front of the second screen.
There is always a nonzero probability that two particles emitted by S2 give 
rise to Dj-D2 coincidence. In order to make sure that the particles detected 
by D1 come almost always from Sj it is convenient that be more intense than S2, 
let us say by a factor of 100. This difference must be obtained without any change 
of the wave accompanying a particle emitted by S2: a suitable toothed wheel can 
do the job, since it absorbs completely some quantum objects while it lets through 
unchanged some other ones.
In this chapter I take into account that there is a difference At0 in the starting 
time Zo of the two wave packets behind the first screen. Because the starting point 
xQ of the wave packet satisfies x0 = vx t0, the packets also have different starting 
points according to their x-coordinate even if vx were the same for all of them. We 
also discuss the effect on the particle distribution at the screen when the wave 
packets have different frequencies.
5. THREE CALCULATIONS OF PARTICLE DENSITY COMPARED
The Copenhagen Interpretation
The particle density p at the screen for the double-slit experiment with two 
incoherent sources is
Pi = |4»1I2 
(7)
where is the wave function associated with the electron coming from the upper 
slit in Figure 6. The wave function <J>2 of the empty wave coming from the lower 
slit is assumed to be 0 because of the “reduction of the wave function” postulate 
which should be valid if the detector D2 has registered a particle. We have used 
“Gaussian slits” for our calculations. That means that the particle distribution 
behind the first screen should be Gaussian. These “Gaussian slits” were first 
introduced by Feynman/1^) if one starts with a Gaussian wave packet, a time 
evolution gives only a spreading of this wave packet. At the screen we should 
expect a Gaussian distribution to build up when many particles arrive on the 
second screen.

Michael Schmidt
The CGS Assumption
According to the causal interpretation the two waves and <f>2 coming from 
the lower and the upper slit of Figure 6 are real, even when a particle is detected 
in D2. Therefore, the CGS assumption of Section 2 gives
p2 = !<!>! + <|>2|2 = |4>J2 + |<t>2|2
(8)
The lack of difference between the squared sum and the sum of the squared wave 
functions is due to the incoherence of the two sources. Hence, the interference 
term vanishes. Since we are only interested in particles coming from the upper 
slit in Figure 6

The Calculation of p3 with the “Guidance Formula' of de Broglie
The total de Broglie wave for the double-slit experiment in every point of 
space r and for all time t can be written

These general results can be specialized for Gaussian wave packets. With 
Belinfante’s(20) notation one has
<&z(x,t) = (27rst2)~3/4exp [zkz(r - 0.5uzt) - (r. — uzr)2/4o05t]

Furthermore,
rz = r “ r0/ 
(20)
where r is the considered point of space and r0- is the midpoint of the /th Gaussian 
slit on the screen in Figure 6.
It is easy to identify the ingredients of the local velocity (14) in (17)-(20). 
One has

the wave packets.

(28)
The derivatives (25)-(28) can be introduced in Nx [see (16)] and Ny. The local 
particle velocity can be calculated through (14), also by using (21) and (22). From 
the velocity it is only a trivial work to find the trajectory. We will not insist on 
this here. By summing over a lot of arrivals of particle trajectories at the second 
screen the density p3 is obtained.
6. NUMERICAL RESULTS OBTAINED WITH THE “GUIDANCE 
FORMULA”
The numerical values of the fixed parameters in my calculation were:
ct0 = 0.65 x 10“5 cm 
y01 = 1 x 10“4 cm 
y02 = — 1 x 10~4 cm 
Uj = (1.3 x IO10 cm/s, 1.5 x 104 cm/s) 
u2 = (1.3 x 1010cm/s, —1.5 x IC^cm/s)
Gaussian wave packets are assumed to arise from the first screen where the slits are 
located. Actually the slits are only a fiction in such a calculation, the true situation 
being that of different Gaussian packets, with little initial overlapping, that 
propagate symmetrically toward the second screen, spread and thus increase their 
overlapping, and fully interfere in the region containing the second screen. In the 
ideal situation there are two sources totally in phase, both having the same energy 
and they emit their particles at the same time tQ, and there is no difference with 
respect to the situation with only one source in the de Broglie approach. In this 
case one gets the same picture for the particle trajectories as shown in Figure 
5a. As a first test I changed the phase £ between the two wave packets. The results 
are shown in Figures 7 to 9. If the phase shift is 0 and 2tt the trajectories are not

FIGURE 7. Particle trajectories for a double-slit experiment with two sources. While the energy of the 
particles and the starting time t0 of the two wave packets from the slits are identical, their phase 
difference is kept constant and equal to it.

changed (no difference from Figure 5a). The biggest fringe shift is obtained if 
5 = 7T (see Figure 7). The fringe shift decreases in perfect symmetry with the 
distance to it (see Figures 8 and 9).
Second, I looked at the particle trajectory behavior if the particles were 
emitted with different energies which is equivalent to a frequency change for the 
waves. If the energy difference grows, the particle trajectories tend to overlap (see 
Figures 10 and 11). For larger energy differences the wave packets do not “feel” 
one another any longer and the particle behaves as in a single-slit experiment 
(Figure 12).
My main interest was to calculate the density at the second screen. The 
following parameters were changed with random numbers for one of the wave 
packets, while for the other wave packet these parameters were fixed: the phase, 
the starting time r0, and the energy. All of the following figures were calculated 
in such a way that the wave packets were coming from the lower and the upper 
slit of Figure 6, but the particle trajectories were started at the upper slit only. In 
Figure 13 one sees the density at the screen when the phase shift between the waves 
is randomly changed between 0 and 2tt. With our model I always mean a 
calculation of the density with the guidance formula of de Broglie, and with the 
quantum mechanical prediction I mean pp obtained according to the Copenhagen

difference and the starting time tQ are fixed, while the particle energies differ by 1 eV This energy 
difference corresponds to momenta different only in the x-direction.

and the trajectories are only straight lines as they would be in single-slit experiments. This is shown in 
the present figure.

interpretation. Figure 14 shows the result after varying the energy of one particle in 
the x-direction randomly between 0 and 4 eV, while the base energy is 46.355 keV. 
In Figure 15 the starting time t0 is changed between 0 and 8 fs. This number is so 
small because after 1 fs the midpoints of the wave packets already have a difference 
of 2ct0 in the x-direction, due to the high velocity. In Figures 16 and 171 altered all 
of the parameters at the same time with the values given in the figure captions.
Figure 16 clearly shows that the experimental parameters can be chosen in 
such a way that a distinction between the causal interpretation and the 
Copenhagen interpretation (CI) is possible. Figure 17 also shows that if one 
does not take care of these small differences, one always finds the usual 
results predicted by CI. In a forthcoming publication I will give an experi­
mental set up where the differences are easier to detect.

CHAPTER 16
Two-Photon Interference and 
the Question of Empty Waves
Franco Selleri
1. INTRODUCTION
In this chapter the quantum mechanical probabilities are considered averages of 
other probabilities applying to subensembles of the considered set of quantum 
systems. Therefore, if pqm is a quantum-mechanically predicted probability for 
a set S of objects of the same type (e.g., photons, electrons) we will assume that 
S can be split in a certain number of subsets Sz to each of which a certain 
probability p. belongs, such that 
Pqm

where and N are the populations of S. and S, respectively.
For a realistically minded physicist there are two good reasons for believing 
in the previous description:
1. He is led to the conclusion that the experimentally observed violations^1) of 
Bell-type inequalities of the strong type(2) are due to the lack of validity in 
nature of the additional assumptions used in the derivation of such 
inequalities. He thus considers the following (Clauser-Holt-Shimony- 
Horne(3)) assumption as false'. “ Given that a pair of photons emerge from 
two regions of space where two polarizers can be located, the probability

of their joint detection by two photomultipliers is independent of the 
presence and of the orientation of the polarizers
2. He knows a necessary consequence of local realism in its most general 
formulation<4>: “If probabilities are consequences of objectivity real 
physical properties of the ensembles for which they are predicted, then 
they must result from averages of probabilities in general different for 
different subsets composing these ensembles."
There are thus both experimental and theoretical reasons for giving a 
structure to detection probabilities. In quantum theory instead, one describes the 
detection probability of a photon always with a constant numerical factor t] , the so- 
called “quantum efficiency” of the photodetector. Of course, quantum optics had 
a tremendous success in explaining a very large number of observations, but this 
can be considered a consequence of the observation of average values in full 
ensembles. Since the average of a product is in general different from the product 
of the averages, it is in the case of two-photon observations that one can expect 
departures from the quantum-theoretical description.
2. DETECTION-PROBABILITY MODEL
When a photon enters a photodetector, consider the quantum efficiency t| as 
an average of different probabilities. For example, assume the detection proba­
bility to depend on the photonic wave function 4>. Now, this is a dangerous 
assumption, because the transmission through a beam splitter, a polarizer, etc. 
depends on the wave function. If T and D are the transmission and detection 
probabilities, respectively, one would have an overall probability
which in general is different from Tqm'iq since a correlation between transmission 
and detection is in this way established. We need a particular dependence of D 
on <J>, such that the well-understood physics of single photons is reproduced. A 
simple way to achieve this is the following.
Every photon carries a dichotomic variable |x = ±1;
T($>) does not depend on jjl;
D(fjL, <b) = 7) + jjlG(c|>) 
(2)
Assuming that the values |x = ±1 are equiprobable, one gets
= r(<b)ii
(3) 

Two-Photon Interference and Empty Waves
279
and the single-photon physics is reproduced if T(fy) is chosen in conformity to 
the quantum-mechanical predictions. 
For probabilities one must have
0 T] ± G(ty 1 
(4)
whence it follows:
|G(<I>)| 
7]; |G(c|))|

(5)
Assuming that the dependence of G on t] is all contained in a positive factor 
/(tj) one writes:
=/(7])F(<|>) 
(6)
with
IW 1 
(7)
Given (7), one can satisfy the conditions (5) for all values of |F| only if 
*n; /('n) i - 
The simplest function f satisfying both conditions is
Z"1 = 7| —1 + (1 - 7|)—1 
Therefore, 
/ = 7](1 - 7|) 
and
G(<t>) = 7|(1 - 7))F(<|)) 
(8)
The simplest choice for F that allows this function to span the whole range 
of permissible values is
F(tf) = 1 - 2|i|/|2 
(9)
where i|> is proportional to 4>. For |i|j|2 = 0, F = 1, while for |i|>|2 = 1, F = — 1. 
Therefore, (9) fixes the normalization of the wave function: the maximum value of 
|i|/|2 should be 1. The dichotomy between the physically real wave <|) and the 

280
Franco Selleri
probabilistically normalized wave i|j is typical of the de Broglie approach. The 
difference between <b and ib is, however, reducible to a constant numerical factor.
With reference to Figure 1 we see that the straight line (9) is a possible choice 
for F(i|/). Line (a) tends to make the effects generated by i|> nearer to zero, and 
should probably be discarded; line (b) tends instead to magnify the effects of i|/ and 
should be considered as interesting. Line (c) will give the strongest possible 
effects within the present approach and can be written
Fc(y) = 2 0(y) - 1 = Sign(l - 2|Md2) 
(10)
where 0(y) is the step function. In order to obtain something similar to curve (b) 
we can add to F = y a term with three zeros, for y = —1,0, +1. It can be written
«(i + y)y(i - y)
with a > 0, constant. One thus has
Fb(y) = y + ay(l - y2) 
(11)
From condition (7) one can show that a j. In order to magnify the effects of our 
model we can take a = j, so that
Fb(y) = ly - iy3 
(13)
Another possible choice is directly suggested by Figure 1:
Fb(y) = sin (y yj 
(13)

3. TWO-PHOTON DETECTION
Since the two values of |i are assumed equiprobable, for all measurements 
performed on independent photons (2) leads to the quantum mechanical proba­
bility (3) for all choices of F. The situation changes for two observations 
performed on correlated photons, if one assumes, for example, that the photons are 
produced with the same value of |±, which, however, will change at random 
over the values |x = ± 1 from pair to pair.
Consider the detection probabilities
= [1 + H(1 - 2|i|/1|2)]t)1
D2 = [1 + fi(l - 2|i|»2|2)]712 
}
for photon 1 and 2, respectively. In (14) we assumed the same pi for the two photons 
and took the approximation 1^, t|2 « 1, valid in some recent experiments. The 
|x-averaged product of D{ and D2 is given by
= [1 + (1 - 2|4»1|2)(1 - 2|i|i2|2)]t)1'T]2 
(15)
In the particular cases where
I’l'il2 + W2 = 1
one easily gets the simplified expression:
W = 4|i|/1|2|i|>2|2t11t12 
(16)
In the often-met cases where the transmission probability is given by the squared 
modulus of the wave function one obtains:
= 4|i|/1|4|l|/2|4Ili1fl2 
(17)
This is a completely new formula, never before met either in de Broglie’s or in the 
standard Copenhagen approach. The fourth power of the wave function has the 
effect of magnifying all interference phenomena.
4. VIOLATION OF “STRONG” BELL-TYPE INEQUALITIES
With reference to Figure 2, consider two photons (1) and (2) crossing two 
polarizers and entering two photodetectors. The squared modulus of the proba­
bilistic wave is reduced from unity to
Ivj/J2 = cos2(k — a); |i|>2|2 = cos2(X - b) 
(18)

polarizers. For the joint transmission and detection probability we have, in the 
linear approximation to Fx 2(y):
P\2 = cos2(X - a)cos2(X - b)-[2 - 2cos2(X - a) - 2 cos2(X - b)
4- 4cos2(X — a)cos2(X — h)]^^
after the average over |i has been performed, and always in the approximation 
7)1, 7)2 « 1.
By averaging over X from 0 to it with constant density we get
P12 = [2M22 - 2M24 - 2M42 + 4M44]t11t12 
(19)
where
My = (cos
*(X
 — a)cos>(X - b))K
It is a simple matter to show that the following results hold:
M22 = |[1 + lcos2(a - b)]
M24 = M42 = |[f + cos2(a - b)]
^44 = AH + 2cos2(a — b) + Jcos4(a — fe)]
By substituting in (19) one obtains
P12 = A[10 + 8cos2(a — b) + cos4(a — £)]'H1'ri2 
(20)
This corresponds to a fringe visibility of 73%, while Ou and Mandel<5) ob­
tained 75%.
5. TWO-PHOTON INTERFERENCE ON A SCREEN
In an experiment performed by Ghosh and Mandel^ the idler and signal 
photon from a parametric down conversion process hit the same screen (Figure 3).

points of detection are x} and x2, while x0 is the symmetry point on the screen.
For this experiment the total squared waves in the points x{ and x2 contain an 
interference term between signal and idler wave and are given by
|4»il2 = Ml + cos (7 j + A)]
W2 = Ml + cos(72 + A)]
where A is the random relative phase of the signal and idler waves, coming from

where L = X/0 is the fringe-spacing parameter and

In this experiment there are no polarizers or beam splitters and only the 
double-detection probability should be considered. In the approximation ^,1)2

Notice that from (21) it follows

y2 = 1 - 2|i|>2|2 = - cos(72 + A)
(23)
(24)

and therefore the cubic approximation (12) leads to
F(yi) = -icos(7! + A) + Icos’Cyj + A)
F(y2) = -|cos(72 + A) + icos3(-y2 + A)
Since the phase A is arbitrary, an average of DXD2 must be made over A. One thus 
obtains the double detection probability
D12 = [1 + 
(26)
where
{F(yJF(y2)\ = %MU - jM13 - $M3I + $M33 
(27)
with
Mtj = (cos1 (^ + A)cos>(72 + A))a 
(28)
From the easily obtained results
Mn = icos(y1 - 72)
M13 = M3j = icos(7! - 72)
M33 = cos (7j - 72) + J cos3 (7j - 72)
one obtains
£>12 = [1 + 15008(7! - 72) + a COS3 (7 J - 72)]T11112 
(29)
The predicted fringe-visibility thus turns out to be about 64%, in agreement with 
the experimental data. If the Ghosh-Mandel geometric factor [sin (ttAx/L)/ 
(ttAx/L)]2 — 0.55 is considered, the visibility is reduced to 35%, still compatible 
with the rather poor experimental data. From our point of view it is not surprising 
that the experiment has been done only once and only with three points with large 
errors: a near 100% visibility of the interference figure was probably impossible to 
obtain. Our approach could, however, lead to a large visibility, e.g., by adopting 
curve (c) of Figure 1.
6. TWO-PHOTON INTERFERENCE BEYOND A BEAM SPLITTER
This experiment, performed by Ou and Mandel/7) is in some respects simi­
lar to the previous one (a two-photon interference on a screen is detected), but its 
essential new feature is the presence of a beam splitter that introduces extra

coincidence by photodetectors Da and Db.
probability factors and increases the visibility of interference (Figure 4). The 
squared wave functions are still given by (21), but the double transmission and 
detection probability is now given by
p12(xP 
+ a - 2|i|/ii2xi - 2|mj2|2)]t]1^2 
(30)
after averaging over the parameter |i = ± 1 common to the two photons. Substitut­
ing (21) in (30) and averaging over A gives
D12(xp x>) = &[9 + 8cos(7! - 72) + 2 cos2 - 72)]i]fn2 
(31)
which has maximum and minimum values in the ratio 19/3, corresponding to a 
fringe visibility of 73%, in good agreement with observations. Of course, our 
prediction (30) does not coincide with the quantum theoretical one. It is interest­
ing to notice that near 100% visibility is never observed, in agreement with our 
predictions. This disagreement with the standard approach is usually explained 
away by invoking imperfect alignment of the optical apparatus, but it is remark­
able that in the dozen or so published experiments a good alignment could never 
be achieved.
7. THE WANG-ZOU-MANDEL EXPERIMENT
After a suggestion by Croca et alS*> for the detection of empty waves, Wang,
Zou, and Mandel7 * 
(9) performed an experiment with photon pairs produced in a 
parametric down conversion process (Figure 5). Their apparatus contained three 
beam splitters BSP BS2, BS3 that will all be considered with a 50/50 transmission/ 
reflection probability. In a coincident detection it is only the signal photon that

can be detected by D2, and then it is the idler photon that goes to Dr The 
experiment was designed to detect a possible influence of the signal empty waves 
reflected by BS3 and by BS2 on the probability that the idler photonic particle 
be transmitted by BSj and detected.
Our treatment is very simple for the signal photon: its probability wave is 
reduced twice in intensity and arrives in the detector with:
W2 = i y2 = 1 - 2l^2l2 = i 
F2 = y2 = i
For the idler photon the wave functions outgoing from BS3 are given by
and

one gets N3 = Vj. Therefore,
Coming to BSt one has

One also has

Therefore, the probability that the idler photon crosses BS3, crosses BSP and is 
detected requires the product of three factors to be calculated:

CHAPTER 17
Experiments on the Aharonov-Bohm
Effect
Akira Tonomura
1. INTRODUCTION
The Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect
*
1) states that electrons can be physically influ­
enced by the magnetic field which the electrons do not touch. This effect is purely 
quantum-mechanical, since electrons pass through only field-free regions and 
therefore no force is exerted on them. Although the AB effect had already been 
tested experimentally
*
2) just after the prediction, some people questioned
*
3) even 
the existence of the AB effect from both theoretical and experimental standpoints. 
Since the controversy seemed to go on indefinitely, it was apparent that a firm 
experimental foundation should be established and the questioned ambiguities 
eliminated by testing whether the phase shift really existed under conditions of no 
overlap between electrons and magnetic fields. Therefore, a series of new confir­
mation experiments of the AB effect have been done since 1982.(4) The conclusion 
was arrived at in 1986
*
5) that the predicted phase shift was detected even under 
ideal conditions. Such an experiment could only have been made possible by the 
recent development of advanced technologies such as electron holography
*
6) and 
microlithography. In this chapter, the confirmation experiments of the AB effect 
are described, especially in relation to wave-particle duality.
2. THE AHARONOV-BOHM EFFECT
The interaction of an electron wave with magnetic fields is described by the 
Schrodinger equation, in which electromagnetic potentials, rather than fields, are

used. In 1959, Aharonov and Bohm actually solved the Schrodinger equation for 
the arrangement shown in Figure 1, producing a striking effect. Even if two 
electron waves travel in field-free regions on both sides of an infinite solenoid, the 
electron waves are physically influenced to produce a relative phase shift. 
Aharonov and Bohm attributed this effect to the vector potential surrounding the 
solenoid, in which the circulation integral does not vanish but is equal to the 
magnetic flux inside the solenoid. This effect was so far from conventional ways of 
thinking that various assertions have been made concerning its physical implica­
tions. The significance of this effect increased in the late 1970s:<7> The theory of 
gauge fields was revived as a most probable candidate for the unified theory of all 
fundamental interactions in nature. In this theory, vector potentials are extended to 
gauge fields and regarded as a fundamental physical quantity. The AB effect 
demonstrates the physical reality of gauge fields.
However, in 1978 the existence of this effect was negated by Bocchieri and 
Loinger/3) They asserted that previous experimental results were due to the 
fringing magnetic fields from finite solenoids or whiskers used in these experi­
ments.
On the other hand, Liebowitz<8> presented a classical interpretation of the AB 
effect: an incident electron passing in a field-free region near the solenoid re­
ceives a force producing the AB effect. This is because the field energy inside the 
solenoid changes due to the overlap of the solenoid’s and the electron’s magnetic 
fields, according to his assertion.
In order to clarify these discussions, two experiments were carried out. One 
demonstrated that an electron interference pattern is formed by the accumula­
tion of just a single-electron interference at one time in the apparatus. The other 
decisively confirmed the existence of the AB phase shift.
3. FORMATION PROCESS OF ELECTRON INTERFERENCE PATTERN­
DEMONSTRATION OF WAVE-PARTICLE DUALITY
An electron interference pattern is always formed in such a way that a single 
electron exists at one time in the apparatus. Such an experiment is referred to as 
“impossible, absolutely impossible to explain in any classical way, and has in 
it the heart of quantum mechanics.” Feynman(9) continues, “This experiment has 
never been done in just this way, since the apparatus would have to be made on an 
impossibly small scale.”
However, such an experiment has now become feasible with the progress of 
technologies. Electron microscopy allows small-scale magnification, and individ­
ual electrons can be observed with a photon-counting detector modified to count 
electrons. The experiments were actually carried out in a field-emission electron 
microscope equipped with both an electron biprism^10) and a two-dimensional 
position-sensitive electron counting system^11) as shown in Figure 2. Electrons

emitted from a field-emission tip were sent to the biprism. The interference pattern 
was enlarged by magnifying lenses and recorded by the electron counting system. 
Electrons could be detected one by one on the TV monitor. When the number of 
electrons is small, as in Figure 3a, electron distribution seems quite random. 
However, when the number increases, the interference fringe pattern formed when 
two electron waves pass through both sides of the biprism is recognizable (Figure 
3c-e). Even when the electron arrival rate was as low as 10 electrons/s in the entire 
field of view, so that at most only a single electron existed at a time, the 
accumulation of single electrons formed the interference pattern shown in Figure 
3e, which occurs when two electron waves pass through both sides of the biprism.
In quantum-mechanical terms, even a single electron can split into two on
2-D detector

both sides of the biprism in the form of a wave function (see Figure 4a). Two partial 
electrons overlap to interfere on the observation plane and form a probability 
interference pattern. When detected, the two overlapped partial electrons can be 
observed as a single electron, never as two. It is interpreted that the measurement 
makes the extended wave function collapse into a single point instantly.
The mystery of this collapse increases when the experiment shown in Figure 
4b is carried out. In this case, two partial electrons having passed through both 
sides of the biprism filament are thoroughly separated by applying a positive 
potential to the biprism filament instead of a negative one as in Figure 4a. When 
measured, a single electron is detected on either side of the biprism filament. Since 
two partial wave functions must exist on both sides of the filament, the partial 
wave function on one side of the filament must have jumped to the other side to 
collapse. This is in spite of the fact that the two partical waves have been 
completely separated and are traveling in opposite directions. It should be noted 
here that the coherence length of the electron wave packet in the traveling direc­
tion is only 1 |xm.
This experiment was designed especially for a demonstration, and therefore 
the electron frequency was much lower than that of the hologram formation. 
However, the single-electron accumulation remains the same for any electron 
interference experiment. The following AB effect experiment was carried out 
under these single-electron conditions.
4. CONFIRMATION EXPERIMENTS ON THE AB EFFECT
Among a series of experiments, the last considered to be the most conclusive 
is introduced here. Instead of a straight solenoid, a toroidal ferromagnet was 
used. An infinite solenoid is experimentally unattainable, but an ideal geometry 
can be achieved by the finite system of a toroidal magnetic field/12) Furthermore, 
the toroidal ferromagnet was covered with a superconducting niobium layer to 
completely confine the magnetic field.

(a) Application of a positive potential to the cen­
tral filament; (b) application of a negative poten­
tial to the central filament.

296

A sample with such a complicated structure should be smaller than the 
transverse coherence length of an electron beam, say 10 jim, and therefore, 
fabricated with the most advanced photolithography techniques. The resultant 
sample is shown in Figure 5. First, an isolated toroidal sample was fabricated. 
However, the sample temperature could not be lowered enough, to below the 
critical temperature Tc (= 9.2 K), to become superconductive. Therefore, the 
toroidal sample was connected to a niobium plate by a tiny bridge for high thermal 
conductivity, as seen in the scanning electron micrograph (Figure 5).
The measurement of the relative phase shift was made between two electron 
waves passing through the inside of the hole and outside the toroid at 5K. 
Although measurements were made for many toroidal samples with different 
magnetic flux values, only two phase shifts were observed, as shown in Figure 6. 
The phase shift value is either 0 or it. The conclusion is obvious: a relative phase 
shift of tt is produced even when the magnetic field is confined within the 
superconductor and is shielded from the electron beam. This proves that the AB 
effect exists.
But why does AS take either 0 or tt? This quantization of the phase shift 
provides key evidence for the complete shielding of a magnetic field with the 
covering superconductor, and is therefore explained in more detail. The mecha­
nism of the phase shift quantization was clarified by the following interference 
experiment. When the temperature T of the toroidal sample was raised, the

matic.

interferogram changed abruptly when T crossed the superconducting critical 
temperature Tc: The phase shift value remained either 0 or tt, independently 
of T, as long as a magnetic flux was covered with a superconductor. However, 
when T > Tc, the phase shift value is considered to be determined only by the 
enclosed magnetic flux and given by eQlh. This was also supported by the 
experimental fact that the phase shift value decreased in proportion to a decrease in 
magnetization in the Permalloy film, when the sample temperature was further 
raised to room temperature.

298
Akira Tonomura
It is clear why the phase shift must have a discrete value, 0 or tt. When the 
temperature of a toroidal sample decreases below Tc, a phenomenon funda­
mental to superconductivity called “flux quantization” occurs, and can directly be 
observed in the form of an electron interferogram. At that time, electrons in the 
superconductor form Cooper pairs, which, in phase, form a coherent wave. When 
the coherent wave turns once around the magnetic flux, the phase has to be the 
same, modulo 2ir, as the original value. This condition is equivalent to the flux 
quantization in h/2e units. Conversely speaking, the flux quantization occurs only 
when a magnetic flux is completely covered with a superconductor. If there is any 
weak link, the flux is not quantized due to the phase jump there.
Therefore, the occurrence of the flux quantization can assure in the present 
case that the Nb layer becomes superconducting, and that a magnetic flux is 
completely surrounded by a superconductor. The obtained experimental results 
shown in Figure 6 give clear evidence supporting the above explanation. Since a 
magnetic flux of h/2e produces an electron phase shift of it, the relative phase shift 
inside and outside a toroidal sample is 0 or it depending on an even or odd number 
of the trapped flux quanta.
5. CONCLUSIONS
The existence of the AB effect was conclusively confirmed using advanced 
technologies of electron holography and microlithography. The relative phase 
shift of it was detected between two electron waves having passed inside and 
outside a tiny toroidal ferromagnet when the number of the trapped flux quanta 
inside the covering was odd. The fact that the magnetic field did not leak outside 
the sample was confirmed by observing the flux quantization phenomenon, which 
assured that the magnetic field was completely surrounded by the superconductor 
and was forbidden to leak outside by the Meissner effect.
The present experiments not only confirmed the existence of the AB effect, 
but also negated the classical interpretation of the AB effect in terms of force 
concepts (see Ref. 13). The AB effect was confirmed under conditions where there 
was no chance for two electrons to exist in the experimental apparatus at one time.
