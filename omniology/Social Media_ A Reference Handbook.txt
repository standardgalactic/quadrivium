Preface
 Social media have infi ltrated nearly every aspect of modern 
society, enhancing opportunities to maintain and build inter-
personal relationships, connect businesses to customers, collect 
donations for causes, build online professional networks for job 
searching, and even fuel political revolutions. Users can access 
news from media organizations through social media or act 
as citizen journalists to create and distribute their own news. 
Support for social issues can be expressed through hashtags on 
Twitter, images on Facebook, or videos on YouTube. People 
also use social media to publish and access travel, restaurant, 
and product reviews; play interactive games; engage in politi-
cal conversations; and connect with fellow fans of their favor-
ite television shows. Social media have opened windows to 
users’ personal lives and made users obsess about the way they 
present themselves online. Consumers are increasingly buy-
ing products directly from social media sites, and marketers 
are diverting higher percentages of digital budgets to adver-
tising on social media sites. Social media have produced new 
job opportunities, including social media marketers and online 
community managers, and some celebrities have risen to fame 
through social media. Furthermore, almost all industries have 
been impacted by the availability of social media, and new in-
dustries have emerged because of social media. 
 Behind the scenes, social media platforms and data com-
panies are collecting the information users are sharing. Th e

Preface
data are useful to marketers who target social media users with 
product advertising, political campaigns that want to encour-
age certain users to vote for their candidates, or hiring manag-
ers who are making decisions about job candidates. As a result, 
many users are becoming more concerned about how their 
data are being used. 
 Social media are a global phenomenon, with the Asia-Pacifi c 
region driving much of the growth. Worldwide, social media 
users grew 10 percent between 2015 and 2016 to 2.3 billion. 
During that time, social media users in the Asia-Pacifi c region 
increased 14 percent. Social media platforms are also increas-
ingly being accessed from mobile devices. Between 2015 and 
2016, active mobile social users grew 17 percent to almost 
2 billion users (Kemp 2016). 
 As an inescapable part of our culture, social media have even 
had a profound impact on the English language. In 2014, the 
collegiate edition of the  Merriam-Webster dictionary added 
the following Internet and social media–related words:  selﬁ e , 
 hashtag ,  catﬁ sh ,  crowdfunding ,  digital divide ,  gamiﬁ cation ,  pay-
wall ,  tweep ,  social networking ,  hot spot , and  unfriend (Steinmetz 
2014). In 2015, the unabridged version added  clickbait ,  emoji , 
 meme ,  NSFW (not safe/suitable for work), and  photobomb (Iza-
him 2015). Social media and tech words added in 2016 to the 
unabridged version included  FoMO , an acronym for the “fear 
of missing out,” which impacts some social media users, and 
 nomophobia , which is the fear of being without a cell phone 
(Steinmetz 2016). 
 Th is book has seven chapters that provide readers with an 
overview of the social media industry and references for social 
media resources. Chapter 1 starts with a defi nition of social 
media and then outlines the history of the industry by focusing 
on the launch and growth of a variety of important platforms 
and technologies. Th e chapter concludes with a discussion of 
future trends in social media. 
 Chapter 2 describes the unique problems and controversies 
of social media and suggests solutions. Social media have been 

 
Preface 
xix
targeted for a variety of societal ills, including an unhealthy ad-
diction to social media and feelings of depression, loneliness, 
and envy as people are exposed to the seemingly more fabulous 
lives of others. Th is envy may also drive people to feel pres-
sure to project idealized versions of their own lives. People also 
worry about privacy issues and the potential for online sham-
ing when people jump on the bandwagon to attack someone 
through social media. Parents are particularly concerned about 
cyberbullying, sexting, and online predators. Users can also 
be targeted by online scammers or tricked by hoaxes or fake 
news stories. Whether social media have a positive or negative 
impact on relationships and communication skills is also ad-
dressed. Th e curation process used by social media platforms 
may also aff ect users who are exposed to a narrow worldview. 
Finally, practical issues related to social media in the workplace 
are discussed. 
 Chapter 3 provides a variety of perspectives from social 
media scholars and professionals on topics ranging from soci-
etal issues, such as the impact of social media on body image 
and on victims of sexual assault, to corporate concerns, such as 
corporate online activism, social media data mining, and using 
social media for crisis communication. Th e chapter also cov-
ers political campaigns, the suppression of a minority opinion, 
and engaging on Twitter with actors of a popular television 
program. 
 Chapter 4 fi rst discusses three key movements that success-
fully engaged social media users. Th en, the chapter profi les the 
founders of the most popular and important social media plat-
forms as well as social media thought leaders, scholars, profes-
sionals, bloggers, and celebrities. 
 Chapter 5 reviews key data related to social media including 
Internet, social, and mobile users and usage, the increasing use 
of smartphones to access social media sites, and the amount 
of time spent on social media as well as feelings of addiction. 
Th is chapter also describes statistics that compare social media 
platform usage, presents data about users and usage of the most 

xx 
Preface
popular platforms, addresses the use of social media by market-
ers, and explores social commerce. Finally, key documents in-
cluding legislation, testimonies, and speeches related to social 
media are provided. 
 Chapter 6 presents an annotated bibliography of print and 
nonprint resources for further research on social media in-
cluding books, blogs, podcasts, videos, and leading research 
organizations. 
 Chapter 7 provides a chronology that tracks the development 
of social media from the technologies that made it possible to 
launch social media platforms through the founding, growth, 
sale, and even closure of some platforms. Also included are en-
tries about social media usage and social media campaigns that 
attracted signifi cant media attention. 
 Th e book concludes with a glossary of terms related to social 
media.

Background and History

Introduction 
 In a relatively short period of time in human existence, social 
media changed the world. Users connect and communicate 
with others, share their lives, and spend their time in new ways. 
Corporations, governments, and many other organizations 
have had to pivot to adapt to the new opportunities. While 
changing the world, the world also changed social media. 
Users often defi ned how social media platforms would be used, 
which created opportunities for new entrants, caused some to 
alter their strategies, and forced others to close. 
 Th e growth of social media has been both swift and vast. At 
the beginning of 2016, when the worldwide population was al-
most 7.4 billion and more than 3.4 billion people actively used 
the Internet, over 2.3 billion people were active social media 
users (Kemp 2016). Putting the scale of Facebook alone into 
perspective, Facebook users total more than the population of 
any country, including China and India (Qualman 2015). Th e 
region of the world with the highest penetration of social media 
users is North America, where approximately 59 percent of the 
population has a social media account. In terms of individual 
countries, penetration in the United States also is 59 percent;

addition to changing the way people connect and communicate with oth-
ers for professional purposes, social media have created many new jobs.

Social Media 
only South Korea, the UAE, Hong Kong, Singapore, and 
Argentina have higher penetration rates (Kemp 2016). 
 In terms of mobile, the world had almost 3.8 billion mobile 
users (including smartphones and non-Internet-enabled feature 
phones) and almost 2 billion active mobile social media users 
in 2016 (Kemp 2016). Th e ubiquity of mobile phones, which 
more people own than a toothbrush, may be driving the so-
cial web more than any other trend or development (Qualman 
2015). As digital analyst Erik Qualman proclaimed, social and 
mobile media are not emerging, but merging. 
 Today, the social media industry rakes in billions of dol-
lars. One source of revenue is advertising on social media 
sites, which is predicted to reach almost $36 billion in 2017 
(eMarketer 2015a). Th e highest spending on advertising is in 
North America, followed by Asia-Pacifi c and Western Europe. 
Facebook receives the highest percentage of spending among 
all social media sites, representing almost 65 percent in 2014 
(eMarketer 2015a). In addition to using social media to drive 
consumers to websites or stores to make purchases, some mar-
keters are experimenting with online sales directly on social 
networks, called social commerce. For example, sites like Pin-
terest are starting to add “buy” buttons so that sales can be 
made directly from the social media site. Th e Social Media 500 
report by Internet Retailer found that, of the 500 leading on-
line retailers, social commerce totaled $3.3 billion in 2014, an 
increase from $2.6 billion in 2013 (C. Smith 2015). 
 Social media are phenomenal not only for their rapid growth 
and economic value, but also for the impact on the human 
experience. From a social standpoint, no other technological 
advancement has likely had such a signifi cant impact on con-
nection and communication as social media. A 2014 survey 
found the average adult Facebook user had more than 300 
friends in his or her network with 15 percent of respondents 
having more than 500 friends, allowing them to engage with 
many more people than most could handle offl  ine (A. Smith 
2014). Social media bridge geographical distances, providing 

 
Background and History 
5
a means to continue relationships with friends who live else-
where or make new connections. 
 Social media users have also learned how to share their lives 
with others in new ways, as private moments are now expe-
rienced publicly. All the milestones of life, including engage-
ments, weddings, honeymoons, births, and even deaths, are 
shared within the network. As noted by  Guardian reporter 
Jacob Silverman, “Sharing itself becomes personhood, with ac-
tivities taking on meaning not for their basic content but for 
the way they are turned into content, disseminated through the 
digital network, and responded to” (Silverman 2015). Users 
are not just posting photos; many are also video blogging, aka 
vlogging. YouTube has been a popular repository for these 
vlogs, but newer social media entrants like Snapchat and Ins-
tagram allow users to send short videos to friends. Th ose who 
want to provide real-time access to their lives can use Periscope 
and Facebook Live. 
 Social media have changed not only interpersonal com-
munication, but also communication by organizations. Most 
businesses, from Fortune 500 companies to small businesses, 
use social media to connect with customers, prospective cus-
tomers, investors, suppliers, and others. Social media users are 
also active content creators of online reviews on sites like Yelp, 
travel site TripAdvisor, and restaurant site Urbanspoon, which 
can help or hurt a business. Television shows, movies, celeb-
rities, bands, and studios all use social media to connect to 
fans. News organizations also use social media to share stories, 
changing the way people consume news. Instead of visiting the 
website of a news organization, many people receive their news 
as they scroll through news feeds on Facebook or Twitter. Cer-
tain stories will be more attractive on social media sites and 
appear higher on feeds, creating a new form of gatekeeper. Citi-
zen journalists who can easily upload content to social media 
sites have also expanded the range of reporting. Political cam-
paigns, social cause campaigns, and even revolutions have been 
impacted by social media.

Social Media 
 Finally, social media have changed the job market. Based 
on research by Deloitte, Facebook alone is estimated to have 
spurred the creation of 4.5 million jobs around the world and 
added $227 billion to the worldwide economy (Goldman 
2015). Facebook itself has 8,000 employees. A new job, called 
social media manager, did not exist before Facebook, and in 
2014, approximately 189,000 people managed social media 
profi les for clients or their employers. Employees are creating 
profi les on LinkedIn to build professional networks and fi nd 
jobs. Some social media users are creating their own empires 
through blogs, YouTube videos, or Instagram profi les, while 
others are launching the next social media platform. 
 Th is chapter starts with a defi nition of social media and then 
outlines the rise of social media by focusing fi rst on the techno-
logical developments that made social media possible and then 
detailing the launch and growth of a variety of important plat-
forms. Predictions for the future of social media are discussed 
at the end of the chapter. 
 A Definition of Social Media 
 Social media are Internet-based platforms that allow users to 
create profi les for sharing user-generated or curated digital con-
tent in the form of text, photos, graphics, or videos within a 
networked community of users who can respond to the con-
tent. Th e terms  social media and  social networks are often used 
interchangeably, but social media are the sites that allow users 
to share content and connect with other users, and social net-
works refer to the communities of users who are found on so-
cial media sites. In the early years, social media sites were often 
referred to as social network sites because many platforms em-
phasized the networking feature. For example, Friendster called 
itself “an online community that connects people through 
networks of friends for dating or meeting new friends” and 
MySpace’s mission was that it “lets you share photos, journals 
and interests with your growing network of mutual friends.” 

 
Background and History

 In an infl uential paper on social networks, danah boyd and 
Nicole Ellison defi ned  social network sites as “web-based ser-
vices that allow individuals to (1) construct a public or semi-
public profi le within a bounded system, (2) articulate a list of 
other users with whom they share a connection, and (3) view 
and traverse their list of connections and those made by others 
within the system” (boyd and Ellison 2007). Reminiscent of a 
journal or diary, Don Schultz described social networks as “par-
ticipatory and self-expressive Web sites . . . where members/
participants expose, discuss, reveal, and expound on their per-
sonal lives, activities, hopes, dreams, and even fantasies for oth-
ers to see and marvel upon” (Schultz 2007, 10). 
 Today, the term  social media is more popular, bypassing 
the usage of  social network in Google searches around 2009 
(Veerasamy n.d.). Th e replacement of the word  network or 
 networking with the word  media refl ects the fact that many of 
these platforms now function as media, where content is shared 
and consumed much like a news site. Twitter once defi ned it-
self as “A global community of friends and strangers answer-
ing one simple question: What are you doing?” Now the site 
prompts users to share “what’s happening?” and its mission is 
“to give everyone the power to create and share ideas and infor-
mation instantly, without barriers.” Th is change refl ects a shift 
from serving as a social network for the purpose of forming 
and maintaining connections to a vibrant information source 
created by that network. Every social media platform off ers a 
unique experience for the user and provides a range of uses and 
benefi ts. 
 Social Media Foundations: 1970s–1990s 
 Similar to any invention in modern history, many previ-
ous developments have led to the emergence of what is now 
known as social media. For all the successes of social media 
companies, most notably Facebook, many other companies 
failed to fi nd the right formula. Th is sentiment is expressed 

8 
Social Media 
by Gartner analyst Brian Blau who said in a 2013 interview, 
“Th e road is littered with dead companies that made the 
wrong move at the wrong time, the MySpaces of the world” 
(Bercovici 2013). Some entrepreneurs have been forgotten 
for their important contributions to later more commercially 
viable platforms. For example, Marcel Molina, whose short-
form blogging platform called a tumblelog may have helped 
inspire David Karp’s more popular Tumblr, which Karp sold 
to Yahoo for $1.1 billion, had this to say in 2013 about social 
media pioneers: “Th e people who plant the seed are often for-
gotten through history even though one could arguably asso-
ciate substantial or equal credit to them. I’m not saying that’s 
what I want. I just think it’s interesting how the last one wins” 
(Alfonso 2013). 
 Before the platforms referred to today as  social media devel-
oped, message and bulletin boards, LISTSERVs, online chat 
rooms, and instant messaging tools allowed users to connect 
with others through networked computers and later online. 
Bulletin board systems (BBSs) emerged shortly after the fi rst 
generation of the home computer. Th e fi rst use of a home 
computer to manage a BBS dates back to 1978. Ward Chris-
tensen and Randy Suess, who were members of the Chicago 
Area Computer Hobbyist Exchange, conceived the Computer 
Bulletin Board System during the Great Blizzard of 1978 in 
Chicago (Gilbertson 2010). Th eir BBS allowed the club to 
share messages through a computer network, rather than on a 
physical message board. Users would dial into a host computer, 
which would establish a connection via modem. Another de-
velopment called Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP) 
in 1979 by Duke University graduate students Tom Truscott 
and Jim Ellis allowed for the launch of Usenet Newsgroups. 
Instead of using personal computers, like BBSs, Usenet News-
groups were hosted on a mainframe computer that could 
manage many users at the same time. Truscott and Ellis also 
developed the concept of organizing messages into categories 
(Apple II History n.d.). 

 
Background and History 
9
 In 1993, Internet service providers such as America Online 
(AOL) and CompuServe provided Usenet access to members 
(Apple II History n.d.). Users of Usenet groups could post 
or reply to messages posted on the boards, which allowed for 
threaded conversations. Providing networked conversation on 
a variety of topics, Usenet groups were the forerunners for the 
many discussion sites on the Web today. CompuServe off ered 
thousands of forums on topics ranging from current events, 
entertainment, politics, and sports, which were visited by hun-
dreds of thousands of users. Later versions allowed users to cre-
ate profi les, but users were not able to create a list of friends or 
followers, which, according to boyd and Ellison (2007), made 
them fall short of being a true social network. Th roughout the 
1990s, interest in using BBSs and Usenet groups began to sub-
side, mainly due to the rise of the Internet and the availability 
and wealth of information provided there. AOL discontinued 
its Usenet newsgroups in the early 2000s, replacing them with 
Web-based chat rooms and message or discussion boards. 
 LISTSERVs allow users to build online social networks 
through e-mail. Developed in 1986 by engineering student 
Eric Th omas, the LISTSERV software automates the manage-
ment of e-mail lists, which had previously been set up manu-
ally (Manjoo 2010). LISTSERV users can join a group based 
on a topic of interest and then easily send and receive messages 
to and from the entire group. A moderator assists in manag-
ing the process. Although LISTSERV is a registered trademark 
of Th omas’s company, people often use the term to refer to a 
generic e-mail discussion list. In the early years, hundreds and 
then thousands of groups were launched, mostly at universities 
for discussing research or technology (Manjoo 2010). LIST-
SERVs are still popular today to connect members of an in-
dustry or organization or for internal communication within a 
company on a specifi c topic of interest to employees. Although 
Twitter, Facebook, and other social media sites are increasingly 
serving as a substitute for LISTSERVs, a LISTSERV still off ers 
value as a targeted communications tool. 

10 
Social Media 
 In 1980, CompuServe developed CB Simulator, the fi rst 
dedicated online chat service available to the general public, al-
though the technology dates back to 1973 when Doug Brown 
and David R. Wolley introduced Talkomatic at the University 
of Illinois. Chat rooms allowed for real-time conversation in a 
space that users could join or leave with a simple click. AOL, 
then known as AppleLink, also developed a chat product. 
AppleLink’s People Connection service provided virtual rooms 
for people to connect on such topics as genealogy and games 
(Wagstaff  2012). Chat room usage at AOL reached its peak in 
the late 1990s after the company introduced monthly (instead 
of hourly) pricing in 1996, allowing people to hang out in chat 
rooms as long as they wished (Wagstaff  2012). By 1999, AOL’s 
subscriber base was 17 million users. AOL chat rooms were 
available until 2010, when the company decided to focus on 
other products (Wagstaff  2012). 
 Instant messaging services off ered the ability to connect 
directly with specifi c users instead of a collection of random 
users, moving them one step closer to being a social network. 
For example, AOL Instant Messenger (AIM) employed instant 
messaging technology to allow users to chat with friends on 
their buddy lists, create profi les, and post away messages that 
could be read by others. Despite dominating the market in the 
late 1990s to early 2000s, AIM had dropped to a market share 
of 0.7 percent by 2011 (Abbruzzese 2014). 
 Another variation of a chat room existed in Internet Relay 
Chat (IRC), a real-time online conversation tool that allowed 
users to join channels on such topics as “macusers” or “teenchat.” 
To see certain channels and interact with certain people, IRC 
requires users to connect to the same IRC network compris-
ing one or more IRC servers. In August 1988, Jarrkko “WiZ” 
Oikarinen launched the fi rst IRC client and server at the Uni-
versity of Oulu in Finland (Stenberg 2011). IRC emerged when 
Oikarinen added chat to his BBS software at tolsun.oulu.fi . 
Th e software was freed from the university so that it could be 
run on an off site server. After installing a server, Oikarinen had 

 
Background and History 
11
the fi rst IRC network. After friends at other universities also set 
up IRC servers, IRC quickly spread to the entire Finnish na-
tional network, then the Scandinavian branch of the Internet. 
By November 1988, IRC was used throughout the Internet. 
 IRC usage has decreased since 2004. At that time, the top 
four IRC networks had more than 100,000 daily users, with 
one called Quakenet receiving daily visits by 200,000 users 
(Stenberg 2011). By 2011, Quakenet had lost about half of 
those daily users but was the only network with more than 
100,000 users (Stenberg 2011). 
 Early Social Media Communities: 1990s 
 In contrast to the previously discussed communication tools 
that facilitated an exchange of messages, GeoCities and blogs 
emerged in the 1990s to provide a personal space for users to 
share their own content. Wikis also arrived on the scene as a way 
for users to collaborate on content creation, and Six Degrees 
introduced early adopters to the concept of social networking. 
 GeoCities, launched in 1994, was a precursor to the fi rst so-
cial networking platforms. Th e tool allowed users, aka “home-
steaders,” to create their own websites that were grouped into 
“neighborhoods,” or themed content areas (1st Web Designer 
n.d.). A user with a technology-related site would be placed in 
“SiliconValley,” while one with an entertainment focus would 
be located in “Hollywood.” Yahoo bought the company for 
more than $3 billion in stock during the dotcom bubble and 
shut it down in 2009 (Ostrow 2009). GeoCities Japan still re-
mains available to users in that country. 
 Blogs emerged primarily to share personal refl ections, es-
says, articles, and other content. Although blogs do allow for 
two-way communication through the comments section, they 
are primarily a vehicle for one-way communication. Although 
previously available in other forms such as compilations of 
Web links, blogs exploded in popularity in the late 1990s. First 
called Web logs, blogs are characterized by reverse chronological 

12 
Social Media 
entries of text, video, audio, or photos. Blogging was facilitated 
by a new technology that was launched in 1999, namely RSS, 
called either “Really Simple Syndication” or “Rich Site Sum-
mary.” Credited to Dave Winer, RSS breaks data into discrete 
items that can be syndicated on the Web, and an RSS feed 
makes it possible to pull news stories, blog entries, and other 
content into a news aggregator. When a blog is in RSS format, 
a program such as a news aggregator can check the blog’s feed 
for changes and update the news aggregator appropriately. 
 LiveJournal, launched in 1999 by programmer Brad Fitz-
patrick to stay in touch with friends, allowed users to have a 
profi le page, a friends list, and the ability to follow the blogs of 
friends, making it more similar to modern social media plat-
forms. Th e friends list also provided the most recent journal 
entries by those friends. One diff erentiating point of Live-
Journal was that the platform served as a primary site for fan 
discussion (Romano 2012). Since the founder’s exit in 2005, 
LiveJournal angered its users by continuing to make business 
and site design changes without consulting or informing users, 
then failing to respond quickly and apologize in the wake of 
user outrage, and then reversing the decision (Romano 2012). 
Th e biggest corporate mistake, which occurred in 2007 after 
the company had been purchased by Six Apart, involved the 
deletion of 500 user journals with problematic keywords, such 
as those referring to rape and child molestation. At the same 
time, journals for rape survivor groups and character role-playing 
groups were also deleted. Th is corporate maneuver, known as 
Strikethrough because of the strike-throughs placed on the 
journal names, made national news (Romano 2012). Angry 
users who used the site to participate in fan communities left 
for fan-run sites like Dreamwidth and ArchiveOfOurOwn
.org. LiveJournal was later sold to SUP Media, a Russian media 
company. Th e U.S. general manager of LiveJournal, Anjelika 
Petrochecko, discussed in an interview with the Daily Dot how 
the platform evolved in relevance: “Back when LiveJournal was 
fi rst created], the Internet was really small. Th ink about how 

 
Background and History 
13
many websites you actually could use. You had to make do 
with LiveJournal and Yahoo, pretty much. Now, userbases are 
growing, more people have access to more websites, and there 
are so many interesting technologies. It’s the natural evolution 
of the Internet. It’s very diff erent from what it was even three 
years ago, let alone 10 years ago” (Romano 2012).  
 Free blogging software was also released in 1999 by both 
Pitas and Blogger. Th e software provided users with a simple 
interface for designing and updating a blog, making it pos-
sible for a wider and less technical segment of the population 
to launch a blog. Blogging software Pitas was founded by 
Toronto programmer Andrew Smales, which during the last 
three months of its existence had been actively used by about 
50,000 users (Phillips-Sandy 2013). Before launching Pitas, 
Smales had a Web page called “Every Link I Went to Today” 
and noted at the time that “there was a pretty distinct line be-
tween online diaries and weblogs that were mostly links with 
a little bit of commentary” (Phillips-Sandy 2013). When a fel-
low tech entrepreneur complimented Smales with the words 
“nice weblog,” he had a name for what he was doing (Phillips-
Sandy 2013). Smales’s other project at the time was building 
an online community of diarists called Diaryland. Diaryland 
had about 2.2 million registered users in 1999, according to 
Smales, with about 20–30 percent of them active (Phillips-
Sandy 2013). Th e site was an early version of a social network, 
allowing users to post content and also follow one another. 
 Blogger, founded by Evan Williams, Paul Bausch, and Meg 
Hourihan of Pyra Labs, diff erentiated itself from Pitas by pro-
viding an option to host the blog on the user’s own server or the 
server of his or her choice, rather than the Blogger server. After 
users created more than 1 million blogs (200,000 of which were 
active) using the platform, Blogger was purchased by Google 
in 2003 (McIntosh 2003). In 2015, Blogger ranked fi fth be-
hind leader WordPress among content management systems 
(W3Techs n.d.). Blogging still remains a popular activity on 
the Web, but has evolved since the early days. New tools have 

14 
Social Media 
been introduced, namely Tumblr, LinkedIn, and Medium, that 
provide additional opportunities for blogging. 
 Although the fi rst wiki had been introduced by Ward Cun-
ningham in 1995, it was not until 2001 when Jimmy Wales, Larry 
Sanger, and others launched online encyclopedia Wikipedia that 
most people become aware of the usefulness of a wiki. Th e name 
originates from the Hawaiian word “wiki wiki,” meaning “very 
fast.” Wikis are considered social media because users collaborate 
on creating and editing content. As of 2016, Wikipedia had more 
than 5 million English articles and experienced approximately 
10 edits a second around the world (Wikipedia n.d.). 
 In 1997, MacroView CEO Andrew Weinreich launched Six 
Degrees, a site sometimes referred to as the fi rst true social net-
work. Th e name of the site was derived from the concept of 
“six degrees of separation,” which suggests that everyone in the 
world can be connected to any other person through six con-
nections or fewer. Six Degrees combined features from other 
sites, including the user profi les of dating sites like Match.com 
and the lists of friends and chat capabilities of messaging tools 
like AIM. A later feature allowed users to browse the connec-
tions of their friends. Th is early iteration of social networking 
ceased operations in 2001, just one year after being sold for 
$125 million, and its quick death can be blamed on the lim-
ited number of online users at the time and the fact that that 
the site served little purpose other than to collect friends, send 
messages, and see how friends were connected to other users 
(1st Web Designer n.d.). Users were also frustrated by inces-
sant membership drives and the spam-like nature of the invita-
tions (1st Web Designer n.d.). Around the same time as Six 
Degrees, sites such as AsianAvenue, BlackPlanet, and MiGente 
also emerged to connect niche audiences. 
 Emerging Social Media: Early 2000s 
 Th e developments previously discussed laid the foundation for 
the emergence of social media platforms in the early 2000s. By 

 
Background and History 
15
the middle of the decade, the popularity of social media started 
to explode with the introduction of some of today’s most popu-
lar platforms. For some people, social media has pervaded their 
lives so intensely that it is diffi  cult to remember how commu-
nication occurred before social media. 
 Ryze, launched in 2001 by Adrian Scott, sought to help 
business professionals connect online. Scott’s inspiration came 
from networking mixers he organized at his San Francisco loft 
(Mieszkowski 2002). He developed the site to allow those at-
tendees to connect between events. Members could create pro-
fi les; search the site for other professionals based on location, 
industry, and personal hobbies; and create tribes based on com-
monalities. Th e site quickly inspired another social networking 
site, Friendster, which was founded by Ryze member Jonathan 
Abrams and Peter Chin. 
 Friendster was launched in 2002 with a more user-friendly 
interface than predecessor Six Degrees. Th e site included profi le 
photos, message boards, and links to “friendsters.” Friendster 
attempted to fi nd a niche in the online dating marketplace as an 
alternative to Match.com. Instead of meeting strangers, Friend-
ster could help a user meet a friend of a friend, potentially lead-
ing to a more successful romantic relationship. Within its fi rst 
three months, the site attracted 3 million members, representing 
1 in every 126 Web users at the time (1st Web Designer n.d.). 
Th e platform’s demise came after rapid growth created technical 
problems and an upset to the site’s culture. Users also fretted 
about whether to allow acquaintances to become friendsters. 
 LinkedIn, the leading professional social networking site 
with 350 million users in more than 200 countries, was 
founded by Reid Hoff man and other former members of Pay-
Pal and SocialNet in 2002, and then was launched offi  cially in 
2003. Th e site provides a space for users to create a professional 
profi le in a format similar to a resume, build their professional 
networks, share references with their contacts, and search for 
jobs. Th e site has evolved and now provides a space to share 
news stories and blog posts in a news feed. 

16 
Social Media 
 For many social media users, MySpace was their fi rst social 
networking experience. Launched on a limited basis in 2003 
(and offi  cially in 2004) by musician Tom Anderson and mar-
keter Chris DeWolfe, MySpace was designed as a Friendster-
like platform for musicians and bands to share music and 
connect with fans. Th e growth of the site was aided by An-
derson’s connections to and support from Hollywood and mu-
sician friends. DeWolfe promoted MySpace through e-mail 
spam to users of Friendster and online dating sites (Lapinski 
2006). Th e year proved to be the right time for people to em-
brace social networking, and popularity of the site skyrock-
eted throughout 2004, breaking 1 million unique visitors per 
month in June 2004 (Jackson and Madrigal 2011). In July 
2005, when the site was receiving 17 million unique monthly 
visitors, the founders sold the company to Rupert Murdoch’s 
News Corp for $580 million (Rushe 2011). Just a year later 
with 46 million unique monthly visitors, MySpace became 
the most visited site on the Web representing 4.46 percent of 
all Internet traffi  c (Cashmore 2006). Th e quick rise eventu-
ally led to a dramatic fall, as Facebook surpassed MySpace in 
terms of unique worldwide visitors in April 2008 and unique 
U.S. visitors in May 2009 (Raphael 2009). News Corp took 
a fi nancial hit in selling MySpace in June 2011 to Specifi c 
Media Group and Justin Timberlake for a reported $35 mil-
lion (Rushe 2011). Th e site, rebranded as Myspace with a low-
ercase  s , now focuses on the music industry. 
 A virtual experience in an online world was launched by 
Linden Lab and its founder Philip Rosedale in 2003 through 
the game Second Life. While in the game, players, represented 
by avatars, engage with other users, participate in activities, 
and create and trade property. Second Life may have been the 
fi rst social media site to demonstrate the potential of users to 
spend money on virtual goods, such as a new hairstyle for an 
avatar. After 10 years in existence, more than 36 million people 
had created accounts and spent a total of $3.2 billion within 
Second Life (Linden Lab 2013). At the time, the company was 

 
Background and History 
17
still acquiring an average of 400,000 new users each month 
and users off ered 2.1 million virtual goods for sale (Linden Lab 
2013). Since then, Linden Lab geared up for a new version, 
expected to be released in 2016. Th e new version will support 
the Oculus Rift, a virtual reality headset, allowing users to not 
only watch their avatars on the screen, but also virtually see out 
of the eyes of their avatars (Linden Lab 2015). 
 A seminal year in the history of social media was 2004 when 
Mark Zuckerberg and several of his Harvard University class-
mates launched Facebook. At the time of the 10-year anni-
versary of Facebook, Zuckerberg refl ected on the occasion by 
saying, “I remember getting pizza with my friends one night 
in college shortly after opening Facebook. I told them I was 
excited to help connect our school community, but one day 
someone needed to connect the whole world” (Zuckerberg 
2014). At the time, this goal may have seemed far-fetched, but 
Facebook has indeed been successful at connecting billions of 
people worldwide. Facebook’s early strategy was to restrict ac-
cess to the social network to create an air of exclusivity. First, 
it was only open to Harvard students, attracting more than 
half of the student population to sign up in its fi rst month 
(1st Web Designer n.d.). It later rolled out access to students 
at other universities, high school students, and fi nally, the gen-
eral public after two years. Another decision was to accommo-
date other languages on Facebook. In 2007, Facebook started 
with Spanish and now off ers approximately 80 languages. As of 
August 2016, Facebook had 1.71 billion monthly active users 
with 84.5 percent of those users outside the United States and 
Canada (Facebook n.d.). Facebook is by far the most dominant 
social media platform in the world. 
 In May 2012, Facebook had the largest Internet initial pub-
lic off ering in history at the time and raised $16 billion with a 
peak market capitalization of more than $104 billion (Spears 
and Frier 2012). After an initial tumble of its stock price, the 
price surged during the three-year period of 2013–2016 along 
with the rest of the stock market. By 2015, Facebook was worth 

18 
Social Media 
more than Walmart, with a market valuation of $245 billion 
(La Monica 2015). 
 One of the early considerations of the Facebook founders 
and other key employees was a revenue model that would allow 
for continued access to the free service. An advertising model 
was adopted to allow marketers to purchase sidebar advertising 
or promote posts within users’ News Feeds. Since then, adver-
tising formats have continued to evolve. Revenue for 2015 was 
almost $18 billion, with much of that coming from advertising, 
representing a 44 percent increase of revenue from the previous 
year. Approximately 80 percent of all Facebook’s advertising 
revenue is generated by mobile advertising (Lien 2016). 
 Despite its strength in terms of users and revenue, the growth 
of Facebook has not been without challenges and obstacles. 
Th e company was criticized following the introduction of the 
Facebook mobile app in 2010, mainly with complaints that it 
was buggy and slow (Casti 2013). Th e key problem was that 
the app was designed to work on any operating system, includ-
ing iOS or Android, instead of being designed for a specifi c 
platform. Critics questioned whether the company would be 
able to dominate in mobile, but the company successfully re-
designed the app. As of the end of the second quarter of 2016, 
Facebook had 1.57 billion monthly active mobile users, repre-
senting approximately 92 percent of all active monthly users 
(Facebook 2016). 
 Th e company has also made it possible for non-smartphone 
users to access Facebook through an app for feature phones 
called “Facebook for Every Phone.” Th e app mimics a smart-
phone app and runs faster than the mobile website. Th e app is 
used by more than 100 million users in developing countries, 
such as India, Indonesia, and the Philippines (Makavy 2013). 
Facebook also introduced Facebook Messenger in late 2012, 
moving its messaging system out of the boundaries of Facebook 
and into a separate app. By 2014, all Facebook mobile users 
were required to download the app if they wanted to continue 
messaging through Facebook. Th e benefi t of Messenger is that 

 
Background and History 
19
any user can access the app, not just Facebook users. Th e app 
also provides a means to connect with Facebook friends and 
other contacts either by phone, video calling, or text message. 
 Facebook is the only social media platform to date to have 
a Hollywood movie released about it. Th e 2010 movie  Th e 
Social Network told the story of the founding and growth of 
Facebook and was based on the 2009 book  Th e Accidental 
Billionaires: Th e Founding of Facebook, a Tale of Sex, Money, 
Genius, and Betrayal by Ben Mezrich. Th e central confl ict in 
the book and subsequent movie was whether Zuckerberg had 
stolen the concept of Facebook from Harvard classmates, the 
Winklevoss twins, an allegation that was denounced in other 
sources, namely  Th e Facebook Eﬀ ect by David Kirkpatrick. In 
2011, Facebook settled with the Winklevoss twins a second 
time in a dispute over who had conceived the idea of the social 
media site. Th e deal was worth more than $160 million at the 
time and included $20 million in cash and partial ownership of 
Facebook (Ionescu 2011). 
 Despite the popularity of Facebook, recent studies have sug-
gested that Facebook is not as important as other social media 
platforms for younger users who prefer platforms where they 
can share content and communicate away from the eyes of 
their parents, teachers, and other adults (BI Intelligence 2015). 
Perhaps the younger demographic will move onto Facebook as 
they age and have less of a need to have private conversations 
among peers. Whatever the future holds for Facebook, its rise 
has been phenomenal and the benefi ts have been abundant. 
Zuckerberg said so himself in his 10-year anniversary post: 
“It’s been amazing to see how all of you have used our tools 
to build a real community. You’ve shared the happy moments 
and the painful ones. You’ve started new families, and kept

 Flickr, an early image-sharing social media platform, 
was launched in 2004 by husband-and-wife team Stewart 

20 
Social Media 
Butterfi eld and Caterina Fake. Th e site’s tagline, “almost cer-
tainly the best online photo management and sharing appli-
cation in the world,” underscored its dominance in the early 
years. Flickr was built on the concept of not just photo sharing, 
but also social networking. Photo sharing could be controlled 
with much more granularity than sites like Facebook originally 
off ered. For example, photos could be uploaded for private 
viewing, shared with a few select people, or posted for public 
consumption. 
 Just a year after launching, Yahoo acquired Flickr for a re-
ported $22 million to $25 million. Instead of nurturing the 
community, Yahoo focused on monetizing the site through 
searches that accessed Flickr images (Honan 2012). To Yahoo, 
the site was a database, not a social network, at a time when 
social networks were on the rise. Under Yahoo’s management, 
Flickr users were frustrated with a new system of signing in to 
Flickr with a Yahoo account. Th e company also pursued pre-
screening of user content before it was posted online. 
 Another problem with Flickr was that it was slow to intro-
duce a mobile app. More than a year after the Apple iTunes 
store opened, Flickr fi nally launched its app, but reception was 
extremely critical of the inability of the app to upload several 
photos at one time and the reduction of image quality through 
the process of uploading (Honan 2012). At the same time, 
other photo apps emerged, which allowed users to apply cre-
ative fi lters to their images. Approximately one year after Flickr 
launched an app in the iTunes store, its biggest threat to future 
success, Instagram, appeared on the scene (Honan 2012). 
 Flickr has somewhat fallen out of favor with mainstream 
users for image sharing, as people generally choose Facebook 
as a place to share personal photos and Instagram as a place 
to share and view a range of photography. Flickr’s usefulness 
as a storage platform for photography has also been replaced 
by services from Dropbox, Microsoft, Google, and Apple 
(Honan 2012). As of 2015, the site still reportedly had 92 mil-
lion users, but traffi  c was much lower, suggesting that many of

21
those users represent neglected accounts (Honan 2012). As of 
mid-2016, Quantcast estimated Flickr’s traffi  c to be approxi-
mately 4.5 million users a month, a number that has been 
dropping over time (Quantcast n.d.). New developments, 
however, are continuing and the site now provides higher-
resolution display for pro members and an improved photo 
editor tool. Th e site also off ers users one terabyte of free storage 
with no size limits. 
 Social news sites emerged as early as 1997 with the technology-
focused site Slashdot, but it was the launch of Digg in 2004 
and Reddit in 2005 that social news sites started to attract 
mainstream attention. Th ese sites allow users to share stories 
that can then be voted on by other readers. Th e more favorable 
the votes are, the higher the story will appear in the feed, while 
negative votes will move the story down. Digg, founded by 
Kevin Rose, Jay Adelson, Owen Byrne, and Ron Gorodetzky, 
provides users with a means to vote to either “digg” or “bury” a 
user-submitted story. Further contributing to making this site 
a social network, users can create profi le pages with a catalog 
of their diggs that can be followed by friends. In 2012, Digg 
was acquired by Betaworks, a technology investment and de-
velopment company, for just $500,000, a disappointing fi g-
ure considering the estimated value of the site had once been 
around $160 million and investors had provided $45 million 
of funding through the years (Metz 2012). Data from com-
Score revealed that although Digg’s traffi  c had been more than 
29 million unique monthly visitors in January 2010, by May 
2012, it had dropped to 7.3 million (Metz 2012). 
 Social news site Reddit, launched by University of Virginia 
graduates Steve Huff man and Alexis Ohanian, has fared much 
better than Digg. In 2006, Condé Nast acquired the site for 
an undisclosed price and started to attract a more mainstream 
audience. As of April 2016, Reddit had 244 million monthly 
unique visitors (Conger and Dickey 2016). 
 When the  New Oxford American Dictionary named  podcast 
as the word of the year in 2005, it signaled that podcasts had 

22 
Social Media 
reached the mainstream. A podcast is an online audio program 
that can be downloaded or streamed. Although a podcast is not 
exactly social media any more than a song or television show 
is social media, it can be made social by providing a space for 
listeners to engage with the hosts. For example, questions for 
the hosts or answers to questions asked by the hosts could be 
tweeted or posted on Facebook. Furthermore, podcasts provide 
a way for many regular people to create shareable content be-
cause production requires little in terms of skill or tools. 
 Th e podcast “tipping point” is often considered to be June 28, 
2005, when Apple’s iTunes allowed for the podcast format 
and created a frenzy of activity with 1 million podcast sub-
scriptions within just two days and listenership for some 
podcasts increasing at 10 times previous levels (Apple 2005). 
Although only a minority of the U.S. population listened to 
podcasts in 2016, listenership has been steadily growing. By 
2016, 21 percent of Americans over age 12 had listened to 
a podcast in the past month and 36 percent had listened to 
a podcast at least once (Edison Research 2016). Additionally 
the rise of mobile phones has helped spur podcast listening, 
with 64 percent of those who have ever listened to a podcast 
indicating that they had done so “most often” on a mobile 
device. However, podcasts only represented a small sliver of 
total audio listening, at about 2 percent of the time compared 
with 54 percent of the time spent listening to AM/FM radio 
(Edison Research 2016). 
 Th e fastest growing website for the fi rst half of 2006 was 
video-sharing site YouTube (O’Malley 2006). Founded by Pay-
Pal employees Chad Hurley, Steve Chen, and Jawed Karim in 
2005, the site allows users to post videos and build a community 
of users who like and comment on videos, as well as subscribe 
to the user’s feed. Less than a year after its offi  cial launch in 
November 2005, YouTube was purchased by Google for $1.65 
billion in stock (Sorkin and Peters 2006). As of 2016, the site 
was the second largest search engine and the third most visited 
site (behind Google and Facebook). Approximately 300 hours

23
of video are uploaded every minute, and YouTube’s videos re-
ceive an average of more than 1 billion views a day (K. Smith 
2016b). More than half of the views on YouTube come from 
mobile devices, and among millennials, YouTube is where they 
spend about two-thirds of their premium online viewing time 
(K. Smith 2016b). 
 A Daily Kos post from 2011 attempted to answer the ques-
tion of how long it would take to watch all videos uploaded to 
YouTube to date. Estimates of the number of videos that have 
been uploaded ranged from Dr. Michael Wesch’s suggestion of 
80 million in March 2008, which was determined by using a 
wildcard search (typing “*” into the search bar), to program-
mer Artem Russakovskii’s suggestion of 141–144 million vid-
eos in August 2008. Th e post’s author performed a wildcard 
search in 2011, which yielded approximately 275 million video 
results. Wesch also studied video length and proclaimed that 
an average YouTube video at the time was 2.77 minutes. Cal-
culations using 275 million videos at an average length of 2.77 
minutes show that it would take 1,450 years for a single person 
to watch all YouTube content that had been uploaded at that 
time (SuperBowlXX 2011). 
 YouTube’s business model relies heavily on paid advertis-
ing, and various forms are available to advertisers. Skippable 
or non-skippable ads run prior to the start of a video, overlay 
ads are semitransparent at the bottom of the video and can be 
closed, sponsored cards relevant to the video are placed directly 
to the right of the video, and display ads appear above the other 
suggested videos. Worldwide gross ad revenues for 2015 were 
expected to hit $9.5 billion, and after subtracting costs for 
traffi  c and content acquisition, net advertising revenues were 
expected to reach $4.28 billion (eMarketer 2015b). Although 
YouTube dominates as the worldwide leader in video views, the 
company is facing competition from Facebook, Twitter, Ama-
zon, and Vimeo. 
 To encourage major users to stay with YouTube, the com-
pany launched the YouTube Partners Program in 2007 to 

24 
Social Media 
share advertising revenue. According to YouTube, channel 
owners making more than six fi gures increased 50 percent 
between 2015 and 2016 (YouTube 2016). As of September 
2016, the top YouTubers in terms of subscribers included 
established pop stars and musical groups such as Rihanna, 
Justin Bieber, One Direction, and Taylor Swift as well as You-
Tube sensations such as PewDiePie, HolaSoyGerman, and 
Smosh (Social Blade 2016). Th e annual earnings of leader 
PewDiePie, with almost 50 million subscribers and more 
than 13.1 billion video views as of mid-2016, were estimated 
to be $12 million for 2015 (Mandle 2015). As a result of 
user interest in creating videos with quality production, You-
Tube Spaces is now available in six cities around the world 
to provide video creators with studios to produce their video 
content and learn new skills. 
 Social networking site Bebo is an example of a social media 
site that crashed, burned, and then reinvented itself. Th e site 
was founded by husband-and-wife team Michael and Xochi 
Birch in San Francisco in 2005 and became popular among 
users in the United Kingdom, particularly Ireland. Its major 
competitor at the time was MySpace, but Bebo was considered 
more user-friendly. Similar to other social media sites, users 
could share blog posts, photos, music, videos, and surveys. AOL 
purchased the site in 2008 for $850 million, a deal considered 
by a BBC reporter to be “one of the worst deals ever made in 
the dotcom era” (BBC News 2010). After managing the site for 
two years, AOL announced that Bebo would be sold or closed 
for its inability to compete with Facebook and Twitter and 
its declining membership. After the site was sold to Criterion 
Capital Partners, the new owner declared bankruptcy, and the 
Birches bought Bebo back for $1 million (Grant 2013). Late in 
2014, Bebo was reincarnated as a mobile messaging app. Users 
select avatars for their profi les, not personal photos. Hashtags 
are not just for following similar conversations, but they also 
control actions or unlock special activities within the app. For 
example, the hashtag #allthesingleladies places the avatar in a

 Mainstream Social Media: Late 2000s 
 By 2006, Facebook had opened its platform to all users over 
age 13 with a valid e-mail address, and many users were willing 
to explore not only Facebook, but also the other social media 
platforms that emerged during the late 2000s. Notable en-
trants during this time included Twitter, Tumblr, Foursquare, 
and WhatsApp. Also, social gaming grew in popularity, and the 
launch of the iPhone meant that mobile users had a chance to 
engage with social media through apps and the Web on a user-
friendly mobile platform. 
 Twitter fi rst received mainstream attention at the SXSW 
conference in 2007 and was the conference’s breakout social 
media platform (Kessler 2011). Twitter is diff erentiated from 
other social media sites in that it is, by default, an open space 
for conversation. Most users keep their profi les set to public, 
instead of making them private. Also unlike other social media 
sites, Twitter users do not have to mutually accept a follower re-
quest to see tweets from another user. Users can follow anyone 
with a public account and see that user’s tweets in their time-
lines, but can also block followers, which may occur if a fol-
lower harasses or bothers a user. Hashtags are used extensively 
on Twitter, which allow users to search and follow a thread of 
conversation. For example, users watching a television show 
might use the show’s hashtag to follow and participate in con-
versations with other viewers. Hashtags are also used to build 
support for issues or causes, such as #BlackLivesMatter for vio-
lence and injustice against African Americans, #bringbackour-
girls for the Nigerian schoolgirls who were abducted by Boko 
Haram, #alsicebucketchallenge for the ALS Ice Bucket Chal-
lenge, or #whyistayed and #whyileft for domestic abuse. 
 Th e story behind the founding of Twitter has been hotly de-
bated in popular media and often neglects the involvement of 

26 
Social Media 
Noah Glass, original founder of Odeo, a podcasting platform 
start-up and the company that later launched Twitter. Odeo 
investor Evan Williams (who later became CEO), former 
Google employee Biz Stone, and NYU undergraduate student 
Jack Dorsey are usually credited for the founding of Twitter. 
In a 2011  Business Insider article, Nicholas Carlson provides 
a version of the founding that highlights Glass’s contribution 
(Carlson 2011). 
 After Glass founded Odeo, Williams became more involved 
than investors generally are with start-ups (Carlson 2011). 
Odeo even moved its operations to Williams’s former apart-
ment when he moved into a house. Williams eventually be-
came the CEO, and along the way, Stone and Dorsey were 
also hired. Although an early invention of Glass’s was turning 
a phone message into an MP3 that could be hosted online, 
Odeo’s fi rst product was an online platform for podcasting. 
Within months, however, Apple announced that iTunes would 
be able to host podcasts and that the service would be pre-
loaded on iPods. Odeo then grew disenchanted with podcasts. 
 Dorsey had the idea of sharing “status,” or what the user was 
doing right then. In early 2006, Glass, Dorsey, and contract 
developer Florian Weber presented an idea to the company 
whereby users would send a text that would be shared with all 
their connections (Carlson 2011). Glass was in charge of the 
development team. Th is service was called twttr, a name imag-
ined by Glass. After they purchased the domain name from its 
owner, twttr became Twitter. Th e fi rst message on the site was 
posted by Dorsey, who tweeted on March 21, 2006: “just set-
ting up my twttr.” 
 To clarify who deserves credit, Carlson explained: “Ev-
eryone agrees that original inkling for Twitter sprang from 
Jack Dorsey’s mind. Dorsey even has drawings of something 
that looks like Twitter that he made years before he joined 
Odeo. And Jack was obviously central to the Twitter team. 
But all of the early employees and Odeo investors we talked 
to also agree that no one at Odeo was more passionate about 

 
Background and History 
27
Twitter in the early days than Odeo’s co-founder, Noah Glass” 
(Carlson 2011). One illustration of how Glass is often over-
looked in the platform’s start-up story is an interview of Stone 
by radio host Howard Stein where he said, “So Jack and I built 
the prototype. We took two weeks and built the working early 
model of Twitter and showed the rest of the team. We said, 
‘What do you guys think?’ People were pretty underwhelmed” 
(Carlson 2011). 
 Twitter had a rough start, gaining only 5,000 registered 
users within its fi rst two months (Carlson 2011). Williams saw 
its value, but felt investors were not justifi ed in investing in 
Odeo now that its direction had changed. He purchased back 
all the stock in mid-2006, therefore becoming not only the 
CEO but also the owner. Although this sum was not reported, 
it is speculated to have been approximately $5 million (Carlson 
2011). Five years later, the company was valued at $5 billion. 
Questions remain as to whether Williams tricked investors by 
downplaying the potential of Twitter (Carlson 2011). In 2006, 
Williams started a new company called Obvious Corporation, 
which promptly purchased Odeo. Williams then made the de-
cision to fi re Glass. Twitter was later spun out of Obvious as 
its own company and went public in late 2013. At the time of 
its IPO, shares of Twitter were priced at $26 per share, but the 
price has been on the relative decline ever since. As of 2016, 
Twitter had about 310 million monthly average users and over 
1.3 billion registered users, with slightly less than half of those 
accounts having ever sent a tweet (K. Smith 2016a). 
 Although most of the social media platforms discussed so far 
involve connecting with friends for conversation and content 
sharing, social gaming, where networks of people can partici-
pate collaboratively or competitively in a game setting, is an-
other important development within the realm of social media. 
One of the early leaders in social gaming was the company 
Zynga, founded in 2007 by Mark Pincus who had also previ-
ously launched early social networking site Tribe.net. Zynga’s 
games were fi rst available to MySpace users and later moved 

28 
Social Media 
onto Facebook. As Facebook exploded in popularity, so too did 
Zynga’s games, with some Facebook users even joining the so-
cial networking site to be able to access the games. Zynga’s fi rst 
game for Facebook, launched in September 2007, was a social 
poker game called Texas Hold ’Em Poker, providing friends a 
way to organize a poker game and participate remotely. An-
other popular Zynga product, Mafi a Wars, launched in 2008, 
has been called “the smallest, marginal step up from a text-based 
game,” involving just pictures, progress bars that moved from 
empty to full, and numbers that increased (Th ier 2012). Zynga’s 
most popular game, FarmVille, which launched in 2009 after 
being in development for just fi ve weeks, had more than 1 mil-
lion new daily active users a week on average (Keating 2015). 
FarmVille was followed by Café World the same year. After 
being introduced in late 2011, Zynga’s Mafi a Wars 2, despite 
signifi cant updates, started losing users from day one. As of 
2012, it had 100,000 fewer daily active users than its predeces-
sor (Th ier 2012). By 2013, three of the fi ve most popular games 
on Facebook were Zynga games FarmVille 2, Zynga Poker, and 
ChefVille. 
 Th e business model of Zynga allowed for free participation 
in games, but off ered virtual goods that could be purchased to 
enhance the gaming experience. Pincus said in a recorded talk 
to app developers, “I did every horrible thing in the book just 
to get revenues” (Popken 2009). Some of his tactics included 
announcements cluttering the Facebook News Feed, providing 
paid in-game boosts to regenerate energy quicker, and using 
lead-generating off ers that involved answering questions that 
might trick users into opting in to receiving spam, installing 
malware or adware, or subscribing to a credit card charge. In 
the same talk, Pincus also said, “I mean we gave our users poker 
chips if they downloaded this zwinky toolbar which was like, 
I don’t know, I downloaded it once and couldn’t get rid of it” 
(Popken 2009). Users were also incentivized to recruit friends 
to the game and allow promotional messages to be presented 
to friends on Facebook. 

 
Background and History 
29
 During the fi nal quarter of 2011, Zynga earned 80 percent 
of its revenue from Facebook users, while 43 percent of Face-
book’s revenues were coming from Zynga (Tam 2012). By the 
end of the following year, Zynga and Facebook had negoti-
ated a new deal to reduce the reliance of each company on 
the other. Th e companies agreed that Zynga would no longer 
be required to display Facebook ads on its site, use Facebook 
credits to make in-game purchases, or solely develop for the 
Facebook platform. In return, Zynga no longer had the ability 
to cross-promote through Facebook by placing Zynga.com ads 
in Zynga games played on Facebook, publishing game updates 
that link to the Zynga site, or sending e-mails to Facebook 
users (Tam 2012). 
 Zynga’s initial success failed to translate into long-term sta-
bility for the company. When the company fi rst fi led for an IPO 
in 2011, the valuation was $20 billion, a number that quickly 
dropped to $9 billion, and fi nally, by the time of its IPO, had 
dropped further to $7 billion with shares priced at $10 (Th ier 
2012). From May 2014 to August 2016, share prices hovered 
around $3. Even though Zynga is not as much of an industry 
player as it once was, the mobile gaming industry has been on 
the rise and was expected to hit $30 billion in sales in 2015, 
which surpasses $25 billion in 2014 (Keating 2015). Mobile 
gamers are also increasing and represented 35 percent of all 
gamers in 2015 (Keating 2015). 
 Th e blogs of the early day of social media were reinvented 
with the introduction of tumblelogs, with the most popular 
being Tumblr, which was developed and released by David Karp 
in 2007. A tumblelog is a short-form blog service that allows 
each post to be just one paragraph and the content of posts in-
cludes not just text, but also photos, GIFs, and pulled quotes. 
Although Karp often receives credit for inventing this new format, 
his design was likely inspired by earlier developers, including 
a German high school student named Chris Neukirchen who 
created a tumblelog called anarchaia in 2005 and Marcel Mo-
lina and Sam Stephenson who launched Projectionist, which 

30 
Social Media 
they referred to as a “tumble log” (Alfonso 2013). What Karp 
was able to do was take these existing concepts and provide 
regular users with tools to create their own tumblelogs. 
 Tumblr users not only had their own blogs that they could 
manage, but also a dashboard that provided a feed of updated 
content on other Tumblrs they followed and comments on 
their own posts. Originally founded as an advertising-free plat-
form, the business model changed in 2012 to embrace paid 
advertising, called sponsor products (Lardinois 2012). One 
of Tumblr’s fi rst major advertisers was Adidas, for whom the 
company created a soccer Tumblr and promoted it on the 
home page. In 2013, Tumblr was purchased by Yahoo for 
$1.1 billion, making Karp about $250 million richer. By the 
end of 2015, Tumblr had about 550 million monthly users and 
280 million blogs (Heine 2015). 
 In 2016, Tumblr added paid advertising to users’ blogs, but 
allowed users to opt out (Olivarez-Giles 2016). Th e ads provide 
an additional way to monetize the free service and also off er 
a way for users to make money from their blogs through a 
partner program. Th e inability of Tumblr to have a viable mon-
etization strategy for so many years resulted in the company 
having a hard time convincing marketers to spend money on 
Tumblr (Walters 2016). Around the same time as the advertis-
ing announcement, Tumblr’s parent company, Yahoo, sold to 
Verizon, placing Tumblr under the umbrella of the telecom-
munications giant. 
 Although not a social media platform, the emergence of 
the iPhone and other smartphones can be tied to an increased 
use of social media. Smartphones can be traced back to and 
the launch of the IBM Simon in 1992 (McCarty 2011). Th at 
phone off ered a touchscreen that could be operated by a stylus 
and the ability to send and receive faxes and e-mails, but failed 
to gain popularity among mainstream consumers. Several years 
later, Nokia and Ericsson also introduced smartphones, a term 
coined by Ericsson. By the early 2000s, Palm, Research in Mo-
tion (the maker of BlackBerry), and Windows all had entrants 

 
Background and History 
31
into the smartphone market, but nothing changed dramatically 
in the marketplace until Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced at 
the Macworld convention in January 2007 that the iPhone 
would be on the market later that year (Chen 2008). Instead 
of a phone for business people, the iPhone would be geared 
toward the average consumer. 
 An initial limitation of the iPhone was that third-party ap-
plications could not be added, but within six months, Apple 
opened up the platform to developers. Th e fi rst third-party app 
developed for the iPhone was OneTrip, a digital shopping list 
(Moynihan 2007). Around the same time, the Android op-
erating system was also in development, and this system was 
able to run on a number of devices, including fi rst HTC and 
later Samsung, LG, and Motorola (McCarty 2011). Th ird-
party apps for all these phones are located on either Apple’s 
App Store or Google’s Android Market, now called Google 
Play. As of June 2016, the number of apps available in the 
Apple App Store was estimated to be 2 million apps, which 
was second to Google Play with 2.2 million apps, with both 
app sources dwarfi ng Amazon Appstore, Windows Store, and 
BlackBerry World (Statista 2016b). Apple apps have experi-
enced 140 billion downloads between July 2008 and Septem-
ber 2016 (Statista 2016a). In May 2016, the most popular apps 
in the world included WhatsApp with 42 million downloads 
that month, followed by Messenger, Facebook, Snapchat, Ins-
tagram, and YouTube (Richter 2016). 
 By 2015, 64 percent of American adults owned a smart-
phone, a steep increase from 2011 when the percentage was 
35 percent (A. Smith 2015). Among all mobile phone users 
in the United States, 79 percent own a smartphone (comScore 
2016). Ten percent of American adults have a smartphone, but 
not high-speed Internet at home, making them particularly re-
liant on this device (A. Smith 2015). Smartphones keep social 
media sites at the fi ngertips of users at all times. Furthermore, 
the functions of the phone, namely the photo and video cam-
era, allow users to capture content for easy sharing to social 

32 
Social Media 
media sites. By the end of 2015, almost 80 percent of social 
media users’ time on social media was spent accessing the sites 
from predominately smartphones (67 percent of time) but also 
tablets (12 percent of time), which had increased from 67 per-
cent of time for both types of devices at the end of 2013 (com-
Score 2016). 
 Th e increasing penetration of smartphone usage has led to 
the development of social media apps to be used solely on a 
smartphone. Foursquare, created in 2009 by Dennis Crowley 
and Naveen Selvadurai, was launched as a location-based social 
networking site that incorporates the phone’s location services 
to allow users to “check in” to their location. Crowley had pre-
viously developed Dodgeball, which was a mobile service that 
texted location to a user’s friends. 
 Foursquare included social networking features by providing 
a way to connect users with friends also at the same location. 
Additionally, the app had a game component that gave users 
an opportunity to unlock a variety of badges based on their 
check-ins and also become the “mayor” of a location by having 
the most visits during a time period. Th e app appealed to busi-
nesses that could present users with deals or discounts based on 
their check-ins. For example, Chili’s provided a free order of 
chips and salsa to patrons who had checked in the restaurant 
on Foursquare. 
 Foursquare grew dramatically in the early years, surpass-
ing 45 million users and 5 billion check-ins by December 
2013; however, since then, the platform has not fared as well 
(C. Smith 2014). Foursquare’s initial purpose shifted in 2014, 
and the app that is Foursquare now provides suggestions about 
the “best places to eat, drink, shop, or visit in any city in the 
world” with “access to over 75 million short reviews from 
local experts,” according to its home page. Th e company also 
launched the app Swarm for checking in and fi nding nearby 
friends, which had both been features of the original Foursquare. 
Th e check-in data in the early years was particularly important 
at that time because phones were not sophisticated enough to 

 
Background and History 
33
pinpoint a user’s location with much precision or know what 
venues were in the area, a data point that was relevant to users 
of the data. As the technology and data developed, the check-
in became less important to the company. Th e company also 
learned that sharing a check-in was not nearly as interesting as 
sharing a selfi e or other content that could be done on other 
social media platforms (Popper and Hamburger 2014). 
 A major player in the messaging arena is WhatsApp, which 
was purchased by Facebook in 2014 for $19 billion fi ve years 
after its founding in 2009 by Jan Koum and Brian Acton. 
Facebook already had a successful messaging app in Facebook 
Messenger, but even after the acquisition of WhatsApp, users 
continued to grow for both services. WhatsApp grew steadily 
from August 2013 to September 2015, adding approximately 
1 million users every four months to hit 900 million users with 
Messenger trailing slightly with 700 million (Baidya 2015). 
Acton explained at Facebook’s 2015 F8 conference that each 
platform will grow through independent development and that 
Facebook has no plans to merge the two platforms in the near 
future (McGarry 2015). 
 Modern Social Media: 2010s 
 As social media increased in usage and moved to mobile, many 
social networks fell into one of two categories: those that focus 
on photos and those that focus on messaging (Pierce 2015). 
Even Facebook, despite its dominance in these two areas, pur-
chased platforms that emphasize photos, such as Instagram, 
and platforms for messaging, such as WhatsApp. Journalist 
David Pierce stated, “[Facebook] understood before anyone 
that our online social interactions can’t be captured in a single 
feed. Instagram, Messenger, and Facebook all have diff erent 
purposes, diff erent uses; trying to cram them all into a single 
bucket doesn’t make any sense. It took Google a while, but it 
too seems to be fi nally recognizing that” (Pierce 2015). Th is 
section covers visual platforms Pinterest, Instagram, and Vine,

Social Media 
messaging apps Kik and Snapchat (which also emphasizes vi-
sual content), and live-streaming apps Facebook Live, Meerkat, 
and Periscope. 
 Pinterest, the virtual pinboard or bulletin board site, is full 
of visual content ranging from home design and fashion to 
party ideas and recipes. Th e site, launched in 2010 by Ben Sil-
bermann, Paul Sciarra, and Evan Sharp, provides users with a 
platform reminiscent of a bulletin board or scrapbook for up-
loading or “pinning” either their own content to the site, con-
tent shared by others on the site, or content shared elsewhere 
that off ers a Pinterest button. Th e pins are organized onto 
boards that can be named by the user. Th e Pinterest feed on 
the home page allows users to see the content shared or liked 
by others. Despite off ering social networking functions, Silber-
mann views Pinterest as a “catalogue of ideas” that is more like 
a search engine (Barbaschow 2015). 
 Pinterest users surpassed 100 million in September 2015 
and they were pinning approximately 1.5 billion pins a month 
(Barbaschow 2015). As of March 2015, Pinterest was valued 
at $11 billion, a number that had tripled during the previous 
18 months (de la Merced 2015). At 85 percent, the major-
ity of users are women (eMarketer 2014) and an estimated 
42 percent of women in the United States use Pinterest (Duggan 
et al. 2015). One of the main sources of revenue for the site is 
“promoted pins” purchased by advertisers to attract interest in 
products and drive sales through links to websites for online 
purchases. In June 2015, Pinterest launched Buyable Pins in-
dicated by blue price tags that allow users to make purchases 
directly from the site (Barbaschow 2015). Advertisers also cre-
ate their own profi les for branding purposes. Th e visual beauty 
available on Pinterest has impacted society in many ways, in-
spiring people to be more creative when planning everything 
from weddings to baby gender reveal parties to children’s birth-
day parties. Pinterest also off ers countless recipes and photos of 
food pinned by restaurants, food manufacturers, grocery stores, 
food bloggers and home chefs. Fashion, crafting, organizing, 

 
Background and History 
35
and decorating ideas also fl ourish on the site. Th e site is also 
fi lled with inspirational quotes as well as “life hacks,” which are 
methods of making a task easier. 
 Th e site is particularly useful for marketers interested in 
reaching the predominantly female audience of consumers. 
Grocery store Whole Food’s Pinterest page, for example, off ers 
approximately 60 boards on such topics as “Beautiful Summer 
Berries,” “Sweet Tooth,” and “How Does your Garden Grow?” 
Marketers also identify Pinterest infl uencers, who are users 
with large followings, for sponsored content or design collabo-
rations. For example, in 2014 Target selected several Pinterest 
party-planning infl uencers and partnered with them to create 
product lines that would be sold in stores and featured on the 
infl uencers’ Pinterest boards (Target 2014). 
 Also launched in 2010 was Instagram, the brainchild of Kevin 
Systrom and Mike Krieger. Instagram began as a photo-sharing 
site that off ered a range of artsy digital fi lters for enhancing 
photos. Since then, it has also added video-sharing capabilities 
and a “stories” feature where users can string together photos 
and videos into a slideshow that disappears. Similar to Twitter, 
Instagram also incorporates hashtags to allow users to tag and 
then search for content sharing the same tag. Advertisers also 
encourage the use of certain hashtags for users to share a photo 
to enter a contest or participate in another type of promotion. 
As of June 2015, Instagram had 300 million active users who 
post 75 million photos per day (Newtek 2015). Purchased by 
Facebook in April 2012 for $1 billion, the company has not yet 
developed a monetization model. It is, however, exploring ways 
to connect advertisers with consumers (Newtek 2015). 
 Th e popularity of Instagram has led to “the Instagram eff ect” 
described by  Adweek as “that fi ltered, shadowed, sharpened, 
brightened, tilted, faded, structured, saturated way of seeing 
life through a lens” (Swant 2015). Th e site’s impact has even 
extended to brands, which are replacing their overly staged 
photography with visuals that look more organic not only for 
Instagram, but also for other online and offl  ine advertising 

36 
Social Media 
placements. Researchers at Canva studied more than 1 million 
Instagram images and found that those fi ltered with Claren-
don, Skyline, Normal (not using a fi lter), and Valencia tend 
to get the most likes (Williams 2016). Analytics provide infor-
mation about how viewers are responding to these styles, and 
Instagram is a good source for ideas to make branded photos 
blend in with other popular styles. 
 Google launched social networking site Google+ in 2011 to 
compete with Facebook and Twitter, but despite its attempts to 
diff erentiate itself with concepts such as “Circles,” which limit 
conversation to a specifi c group of friends, and “Hangouts,” 
which allow a group of people to video chat, Google+ could 
not gain a signifi cant advantage over the leaders (Fiegerman 
2015). Users with a large network on Facebook had little mo-
tivation to recreate that network on another site, and Face-
book eventually incorporated a similar tool to Google Circles 
to manage the receivers of any post. Furthermore, as noted in 
 Mashable , Google+ launched “without a clear plan to diff eren-
tiate the service from Facebook . . . bet on a charismatic leader 
with a fl awed vision, ignored troubling indications about the 
social network’s traction (or lack thereof) with users and con-
tinued throwing features at the wall long after many had writ-
ten Google+ off  for dead” (Fiegerman 2015). 
 Th e original Google+ integrated with other Google prod-
ucts, namely Search, Gmail, and Drive, helping its adoption 
and allowing users to seamlessly move between products. 
Google+ represented Google’s fourth attempt to successfully 
launch a social network following products Google Buzz, 
Google Friend Connect, and Orkut. Orkut survived for a while 
because of high usage among Brazilian and Indian users, but 
the site was eventually closed in 2014. In early 2015, Google+ 
spun off  “Photos” and “Streams” as separate products (Fiegerman 
2015). Photos allows users access to photo storage, editing and 
sharing tools, organization and search capabilities, and a clean 
layout. Streams is the rebranded news feed of Google+ that of-
fers opportunities for users to share and read content provided 

 
Background and History 
37
by their connections. Google Hangouts had already been a 
stand-alone product, off ering messaging, video calls, and voice 
calls from any device. Although Google has not released usage 
statistics for Hangouts, it has serious competition from other 
messaging apps including WhatsApp with 700 million active 
users and WeChat with 500 million users as of January 2015 
(tech2 News Staff  2015). Hangouts is failing by not being as 
mobile-friendly as other chat apps in a mobile world (tech2 
News Staff  2015). 
 Th e video-sharing site Vine, created by Dom Hofmann, 
Rus Yusupov, and Colin Kroll, allowed users to create six-
second video clips through an iOS or Android app. Twitter 
quickly purchased Vine in 2012 and offi  cially launched the 
platform in 2013. Vine grew from 77,000 visitors in January 
2013 to 3.6 million by May 2013, according to Compete.com 
(Tate 2013). Although not the fi rst app of its kind, Vine was the 
one that was able to diff erentiate itself from the competition. 
Advertisers employed the platform to create stop-motion ani-
mation videos. Other users included journalists who captured a 
small slice of the news story they were covering, celebrities who 
used it to connect with fans, and record labels for promoting 
new albums or artists. As of 2016, Vine suspended uploads to 
the platform, but will continue to make current content avail-
able for several months. Twitter is expected to close the app in 
2017 (Perez 2016). 
 Other social media platforms launched in the early to 
mid-2010s included mobile messaging apps, such as Kik and 
Snapchat, which are popular with teens and young adults. 
Th ese apps give teens a way to communicate with each other 
while avoiding the watchful eyes of their parents. Launched 
in 2010, Kik is similar to short message service (SMS) text 
messaging, but instead uses data or Wi-Fi to transmit mes-
sages, which makes it attractive to users with text limits. 
Additionally, users only need to know the Kik username of 
someone they wish to message, not their phone number like 
with SMS messaging. 

38 
Social Media 
 Snapchat was founded by Stanford students Evan Spiegel, 
Bobby Murphy, and Reggie Brown in 2011. With more than 
150 million people using the service by mid-2016, Snapchat 
surpassed Twitter usage that year (Frier 2016). Snapchat’s mes-
sages disappear after being viewed for several seconds, which 
makes it a particularly compelling app for private sharing of 
photos and videos. Snapchat engages users with eff ects such 
as fi lters for changing the photo’s tones as well geofi lters that 
indicate location; graphics that add elements to a selfi e, such as 
a fl ower crown; and animated eff ects, such as a rainbow being 
vomited from a subject’s mouth. 
 Live-streaming video platforms were a social media devel-
opment that attracted signifi cant attention in 2015. Th e two 
major players in this arena are Periscope and Facebook Live, 
which allow users to live broadcast (with about a two-second 
lag) from their phones and interact with followers who can 
post messages. One of the early entrants into the live-streaming 
market was the now-defunct Meerkat, founded by Ben Rubin, 
which gained traction at the SXSW conference in 2015. Celeb-
rities and television personalities such as Julia Louis-Dreyfus, 
Jimmy Fallon, and Al Roker followed with “Meerkats” shortly 
after (Newton 2015). Some of the appeal of the app may have 
resulted from the announcement that Twitter was cutting off  
access to Meerkat as a result of its acquisition of similar tool 
Periscope, a move that incited people to show interest in the 
smaller company (Newton 2015). Shortly before SXSW 2015, 
Twitter quietly purchased Periscope for an amount reported to 
be slightly under $100 million, its largest acquisition (Koh and 
Rusli 2015). Periscope, founded by Kayvon Beykpour and Joe 
Bernstein, had 10 million downloads by August 2015 (Wag-
ner 2015). Th e applications for live streaming are varied and 
include concerts, sporting events, other live productions, back-
stage moments from television shows, breaking news stories, 
and political campaigning. 
 Facebook also launched its own live-streaming service 
called Live in 2015, but the feature was fi rst only available on 

 
Background and History 
39
Facebook Mentions, an app that allows celebrities and other 
high-profi le verifi ed users to engage with fans (Mangalindan 
2015). Facebook users can view the live stream in their News 
Feed when a celebrity they follow launches the app. In 2016, 
the company made Live available to all users with an iPhone. 
Th is strategic move by Facebook helped prevent Periscope 
and other competitors from enjoying a signifi cant amount of 
the live-steaming market, encouraged people to spend an in-
creasing amount of time on Facebook engaging with videos, 
and served people’s desire to create and watch live streaming 
(Barnett 2016). 
 Future Directions for Social Media 
 “We’re still in the fi rst minutes of the fi rst day of the Inter-
net revolution,” remarked Intuit cofounder Scott Cook back 
in 2000 (Levingston and International Herald Tribune 2000). 
Less than two decades after its emergence, the social media 
industry still seems to be in its early days as well. Th e devel-
opments that users might see in the future include growth of 
existing platforms, new platforms, and new features in current 
platforms. Other trends include the popularity of niche social 
networks, online sharing and crowdfunding platforms, virtual 
and augmented reality apps, and messaging apps. Social media 
monetization strategies will continue to evolve, and popular 
culture products will continue to incorporate social media in 
new and creative ways. 
 Niche social networks are increasingly popular because they 
allow users to connect with a smaller group of people who share 
a common interest instead of a mass audience. Because a viable 
competitor to Facebook may never emerge, the only way to create 
a competitive advantage may be to focus on an untapped niche 
market. Th e social networking platform, Nextdoor, for example, 
allows neighbors to connect and share community news, post 
items for sale, or fi nd lost pets. Path, another social networking 
site, connects users with no more than 150 contacts, which is 

40 
Social Media 
considered the optimal number of people in a network. Other 
trends include Social-Local-Mobile apps, aka SoLoMo apps, like 
Highlight or Ban.jo that allow users to connect socially with 
others and events in the local area through their mobile phones. 
SoLoMo apps benefi t from the high rates of social media use on 
mobile phones and the needs of some people to meet up with 
friends who are in their vicinity or learn about events in the area. 
 Social media have been a critical component in the fl our-
ishing of an online sharing economy (Reynolds 2015). Th e 
emergence of social media sites, such as Facebook and Twitter, 
had an impact on users by fostering the sharing of information 
and recommendations. Some of these recommendations, par-
ticularly those on Twitter, are shared with strangers, which is 
an important component of a sharing economy. Also, because 
users often share under their real identities, this transparency, 
as opposed to anonymity, creates trust. Th e social network also 
provides users with a way to know whether reviewers are within 
their social graph as friends of friends (Holmes 2014). A report 
by Vision Critical found that 40 percent of Americans have 
participated in this collaborative economy by either buying or 
selling pre-owned goods or services (Holmes 2014). 
 One of the popular sharing sites is Airbnb, a site for sharing 
homes or rooms with strangers for a price. Airbnb and similar 
sites allow users to fi rst view photos of the accommodations 
and then the two parties involved can learn about one another 
through verifi ed profi les and reviews. Uber and Lyft have also 
grown in popularity to provide transportation services. Other 
sharing sites have emerged that provide pet sitting services, 
such as DogVacay, conference rooms through sites like Liquid 
Space and ShareDesk, car rentals from Turo and Getaround, 
and bike sharing through Liquid. 
 Social media users are also connecting on crowdfund-
ing sites like GoFundMe to launch and support fund-raising 
campaigns that raise money for health emergencies or other 
personal needs. Another popular site is Kickstarter, which is 
dedicated to fund-raising for creative products, not personal 

 
Background and History 
41
campaigns. Small donation site Kiva crowdfunds to provide 
loans, not donations, to people around the world to support 
their small business ventures. 
 Products for virtual and augmented reality are also ex-
pected to change the social media landscape. Virtual reality 
engages users in a simulated environment while augmented 
reality blends virtual reality with real life, such as overlay-
ing useful information about the user’s surroundings. When 
Facebook purchased Oculus VR in 2014 for $2 billion, it 
gained access to the company’s virtual reality headset, the Oc-
ulus Rift. Lower-priced competitors Google Cardboard and 
Samsung Gear VR, among others, have also entered the mar-
ketplace. Other players are creating virtual and augmented re-
ality apps. For example, the  New York Times  in 2015 shipped 
Google Cardboard headsets to its subscribers and encouraged 
them to download its virtual reality app. Th e app was down-
loaded more than 600,000 times, making it more success-
ful that any app in its history (Griffi  th 2016). Even more 
popular was Pokémon Go, released in 2016, an augmented 
reality game that quickly captured mass attention and par-
ticipation. While engaging with the game, users seek virtual 
characters by looking at their actual surroundings through a 
smartphone. As of the end of July 2016, Pokémon Go down-
loads were estimated to be 7.5 million in the United States 
alone (Etherington 2016). 
 Conversations have also been moving to messaging plat-
forms, such as Snapchat, Messenger, WhatsApp, WeChat, 
and Kik, in such large numbers that messaging apps now have 
a user base that is on par with the four largest social media 
platforms combined (Revis 2016). In the future, messaging 
platforms will continue to look for ways to engage users with 
new features to enhance messages, such as emojis, gif apps, 
and stickers; expand the range of items for purchase; and off er 
improved tools for group chats. On apps like China’s popular 
WeChat, where users can order a taxi, book a hotel, buy movie 
tickets, check into airline fl ights, access bank statements, and 

42 
Social Media 
make appointments, the purpose of the app becomes to help 
manage a user’s life, rather than just send messages (Natanson 
2016). Th ese interactions with banks, airlines, and movie 
theaters utilize third-party apps that act like websites on the 
chat user interface. Also on the horizon is the use of “bots” 
to engage with users of messaging platforms, with conversa-
tions triggered by keywords typed into messaging systems. 
For example, users who are chatting about going out to eat 
might receive a recommendation from a bot, and then after a 
reservation is made through the app, another bot might start 
recommending menu items. 
 Many social media platforms have a monetization strategy 
that depends heavily on advertising, but many are also incor-
porating social commerce that allows users to make purchases 
directly from the social media sites. Th e key to social commerce 
is a “buy” button directly on the Facebook post, Twitter tweet, 
or Pinterest pin. Th e buy buttons reduce the steps it takes to 
purchase the product, thus simplifying the sales funnel pro-
cess. Facebook introduced its buy button in 2015, and users 
can purchase a product without leaving the site as all the in-
formation is input into a pop-up window. Also in 2015, Pin-
terest launched Buyable Pins, and Twitter started off ering buy 
buttons on ads. Among the fi rst marketers using the feature 
on Twitter were ticket merchants for sporting events and con-
certs (Del Rey 2015). Advertising formats will also continue 
to evolve. Facebook and YouTube have both added 360-degree 
video ads for more engaging experiences. 
 Social media platforms will also continue to engage popu-
lar culture consumers in new and creative ways. For example, 
movie trailers or television shows have premiered on social 
media sites. In 2011, Twitter was used by both Paramount for 
the release of the trailer for its movie  Super 8 and the Sundance 
Channel for the second season premiere of  Girls Who Like Boys 
Who Like Boys . Two weeks before the AMC show  Halt and 
Catch Fire premiered on television in 2014, it was released on 
Tumblr. As a show about computers, it was the perfect fi t for 

 
Background and History 
43
a social media launch. Additionally, social media conversation 
can also create buzz for a show or a fi lm. Th e 2013 Syfy made-
for-television movie  Sharknado about a tornado of sharks that 
hits a Los Angeles community illustrates the power of social 
media to create considerable interest in a media product. Th e 
network released promos on YouTube and started tweeting and 
retweeting in the hours before the movie’s premiere in addition 
to promoting the fi lm through traditional methods. During 
the airing, fans were tweeting at an estimated rate of 5,000 
tweets per minute quickly making  Sharknado a trending topic 
on the site (Twitter 2013). 
 Social media continue to off er viewers a richer experience to 
engage with television content. When viewers use their smart-
phones or tablets during a television show to access additional 
content related to the show or interact with other viewers, they 
are having what is called a “second-screen experience.” Some of 
the techniques for engaging viewers in a second screen while 
watching a television show include providing hashtags on the 
screen, voting via a social media site or app, sharing reality 
show participants’ social media sites, or providing apps to en-
gage specifi cally with other viewers. For the television mini-
series  World without End , for example, users of the series’ app 
were provided with extra content that was made available in 
real time, such as character-related content when a character 
appeared. Th e app also functioned to allow conversations with 
other fans.  Th e Walking Dead and other AMC shows also use a 
similar product called Story Sync. 
 With all the developments during the past two decades, it 
may be diffi  cult to imagine that a new social media platform 
or class of platform could emerge that will connect more users, 
signifi cantly impact the culture, or greatly shift the way that 
lives are managed. Th at being said, entrepreneurs, inspired by 
today’s social media founders and success of the most popular 
platforms, are working on projects that will likely once again 
change the world. New social media platforms continue to 
be launched every day to compete with the major players by

off ering more appealing features for a similar tool, targeting an 
untapped audience, or introducing a completely new concept.

Problems, Controversies, 
and Solutions
 Introduction 
 New technologies are often both widely hailed for their positive 
contributions and fi ercely criticized for their negative impact 
on society and individuals. Although social media platforms 
have more than 2 billion willing users, the impact on users 
has been the subject of much concern, derision, debate, and 
confusion. Some users will recognize the potential for social 
media to help them initiate and maintain relationships, achieve 
personal growth and development, and provide an outlet for 
creativity. Others will view social media as a potential threat 
to their relationships, jobs, ability to communicate, and possi-
bly even safety. Furthermore, the news media often exaggerate 
the harmful eff ects in an eff ort to both educate consumers and 
attract readership and viewership, which stimulates more con-
cern among users. Th is chapter will discuss some of the most 
prominent issues related to social media, highlight social media 
controversies, and propose valid solutions. 
 Social Media Addiction 
 Some users are so consumed by social media that they ignore or 
neglect offl  ine responsibilities and relationships in an eff ort to 
connect with others online, share content about personal lives, 
Teenagers have a daily connection with social media, primarily through 
their smartphones. Th is constant use of technology had led to new dangers 
such as cyberbullying, sexting, and media addiction. (iStockPhoto.com)

Social Media 
or read or watch engaging content. Th e time spent on social 
media may then detract from attending to job responsibili-
ties, completing schoolwork, engaging with family members or 
friends face-to-face, or contributing to society in other mean-
ingful ways. Most press coverage of the distractions from “real 
life” caused by social media is targeted at teens, parents, and 
employees, but any user is susceptible to social media addic-
tion. A commentary on the plight of social media addicts is 
depicted in a 2013 video, which has received approximately 
50 million views. “I Forgot My Phone” illustrates a day in the 
life of a young woman without her cell phone for the day, who 
experiences isolation from the many people she encounters 
who are interacting with their phones (charstarleneTV 2013). 
 Statistics show that social media consume a signifi cant 
amount of daily attention. On a worldwide basis, Facebook 
estimates that the average user spends 50 minutes per day 
on Facebook and its products (Instagram, Messenger, and 
WhatsApp), while comScore estimates the number to be only 
35 minutes for U.S. users (Stewart 2016). Other studies have 
found more disturbing trends. For example, GlobalWebIndex 
(2016) found that worldwide social media users spend almost 
two hours per day on social media. A study by Common Sense 
of teens found that teen girls who are social media users spend 
just under two and a half hours per day on social media, while 
teen boys who use social media spend slightly more than one 
and a half hours (Rideout 2015). Th e collective time spent 
on Facebook by all users each day amounts to 39,757 years 
(GO-Globe 2014). 
 What is it about social media sites that make them so addic-
tive for users? Some users may be driven to social media sites 
like Facebook because they suff er from FoMO, or fear of miss-
ing out. In August 2013, the  Oxford English Dictionary pro-
posed the following defi nition of FoMO: “Anxiety that an 
exciting or interesting event may currently be happening else-
where, often aroused by posts seen on a social media website” 
(Hogan 2015). Another study defi ned FoMO as “a pervasive

apprehension that others might be having rewarding experi-
ences from which one is absent . . . the desire to stay con-
tinually connected to what others are doing” (Przybylski et al. 
2013). Przybylski et al. found that younger people were more 
likely to exhibit high levels of FoMO, with young men being 
more susceptible than women. Additionally, those with stron-
ger FoMO had lower scores on basic psychological needs, such 
as autonomy and competence, and lower levels of life satisfac-
tion and positive moods. Th ose with high FoMO scores also 
tended to use social media just before going to sleep and just 
after waking up as well as during meals and lectures. 
 In addition to FoMO, other reasons for the addictiveness 
of Facebook have been identifi ed. Th e technology itself makes 
the site particularly addictive because only a minimal eff ort is 
needed to post, comment, or like to help maintain a relation-
ship to others. Th e platform also allows users to share content 
and updates with a vast network simultaneously. Users also 
have access to a wealth of information including news stories, 
videos, and photos that are curated by a network of similar 
people as well as an opportunity to be a voyeur in the lives 
of others, commonly referred to as Facebook stalking. Others 
may be addicted to how Facebook strokes their egos. Th ey have 
an opportunity to share an accomplishment, a photo from an 
exciting vacation, or even a selfi e, and then wait for the positive 
feedback to follow. Facebook and other social media sites also 
help users fulfi ll their universal need for human connection 
and to remind people that they are not alone. Th e site can also 
off er entertainment in times of boredom. Facebook has tra-
ditionally featured a strong gaming element from games such 
as Candy Crush Saga and Clash of Clans, which draw tens of 
millions of daily users to the site to play the games (Conrad 
2011). Furthermore, social media sites like Facebook also off er 
the promise of more exciting content as the user scrolls down 
the News Feed. If certain content is not interesting, users are 
enticed by the possibility of more interesting content if they 
continue scrolling, an activity that requires very little eff ort.

Social Media 
 Neuroscience can be used to explain some of the addiction 
created by social media sites. Connecting with others online 
activates the neurotransmitter dopamine, which controls the 
reward and pleasure centers of the brain (Rock 2012). As 
Dr. David Rock, the director of the NeuroLeadership Institute, 
noted, “Social media can be so rewarding, that it overwhelms 
our ability to focus on other things. . . . Th e circuitry activated 
when you connect online is the seeking circuitry of dopamine. 
Yet when we connect with people online, we don’t tend to get 
the oxytocin or serotonin calming reward that happens when 
we bond with someone in real time, when our circuits reso-
nate with real-time shared emotions and experiences. . . . An 
overabundance of dopamine—while it feels great, just as sugar 
does—creates a mental hyperactivity that reduces the capacity 
for deeper focus” (Rock 2012). 
 Could social media be harder to quit than cigarettes or alco-
hol, as suggested by a study conducted by researchers in the 
Booth School of Business at the University of Chicago (Relph 
2012)? While social media addiction is currently not classifi ed 
as a psychological condition, researchers have been investigat-
ing this possibility. Th e American Psychiatric Association is 
considering adding “Internet-use disorder” to the list of offi  cial 
conditions in the  Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental 
Disorders (Jurgenson 2013). In 2012, University of Bergen 
researchers developed a scale to measure Facebook addiction 
(Andreassen et al. 2012). Th e researchers found Facebook 
dependency to occur more likely in younger users, women, 
people who are anxious or socially insecure, those who are less 
organized and ambitious, and extroverts. Answering “always” 
or “often” to at least four of the six following items may indi-
cate Facebook addiction, according to the researchers: spend-
ing a lot of time thinking about Facebook or planning usage 
of Facebook, feeling urges to use Facebook more and more, 
using Facebook to forget about personal problems, trying to 
cut down on Facebook usage without success, experiencing 
feelings of restlessness if prohibited from using Facebook, and

63
believing that Facebook usage has had a negative eff ect on work 
or school (Andreassen et al. 2012). 
 A 2013 Pew Internet & American Life study explored disen-
gagement from Facebook and found that 61 percent of Face-
book users had taken a break from the platform at least once 
for several weeks or longer (Rainie, Smith, and Dugan 2013). 
Of those who do not use Facebook, 20 percent of respondents 
had used the site at one time and only a small percentage 
(8 percent) of nonusers were interested in becoming a user in 
the future. Th e users who had taken an extended break men-
tioned they did so for a variety of reasons, including being too 
busy with other demands and not having time for Facebook 
(21 percent), lack of interest in the site (10 percent), lack of 
compelling content (10 percent), too much gossip or drama 
(9 percent), or concerns that they needed a break from the site 
because it was consuming too much time (8 percent). 
 Combating social media addiction often involves a digital 
detox, also called a disconnection or unplugging, where the 
user takes an extended or permanent break from a social media 
platform. High-profi le people in the tech industry, such as Paul 
Miller of the website Th e Verge and  Fast Company columnist 
Baratunde Th urston, have taken and then written about breaks 
from the Web (Jurgenson 2013). Th urston’s detox revealed fea-
tures of these social media sites that make them diffi  cult to sus-
pend usage (Th urston 2013). For example, unlike e-mail that 
off ers an auto-reply vacation message, social media sites off er 
no such option. If a user wants to take a break and indicate 
that he or she is not checking social media, he or she has to 
be creative and possibly change the profi le photo to a special 
message, as Th urston did by changing his profi le photo to a 
message about his break. 
 An experiment by a team of Cornell University researchers 
encouraged people to take a break from Facebook and, during 
that time, change their profi le photos to a graphic that read 
“99 Days of Freedom” and stay off  the site for that length of 
time. Researchers followed up with participants after 33, 66, and 

64 
Social Media 
99 days. Th e key fi nding was that those participants who expe-
rienced addiction-associated feelings during the experiment, 
had focused on impression management while they used Face-
book, experienced negative moods during the experiment, and 
replaced Facebook with other social media but used these sites 
to refl ect upon and renegotiate their relationship with Facebook 
were more likely to eventually return to Facebook (Baumer 
et al. 2015). 
 Other programs have also emerged to help people disen-
gage with social media. For example, public radio station 
WNYC’s program  Note to Self launched a project in 2015 called 
“Bored and Brilliant” to help participants break their addic-
tion to checking their smartphones, including social media sites 
(WNYC 2015). Th e rationale for the importance of the project 
included the statistic that, 67 percent of the time, people check 
their smartphones without being prompted by any kind of noti-
fi cation. Th e project encouraged participants to download the 
app Moment (for iPhone) or BreakFree (for Android), both 
of which track phone usage. Challenges involved tasks such as 
keeping the phone in a bag (instead of a pocket) and deleting 
the apps considered the most distracting. 
 Digital detox camps such as Camp Grounded in Northern 
California give adults addicted to technology an opportunity 
to take a break from their screens . Experience Life  magazine’s 
Heidi Wachter attended the camp and wrote about the fol-
lowing suggestions that any digital addict can follow: create 
tech-free zones in the home, call or send handwritten notes to 
friends instead of texting, enjoy tech-free dinners with friends, 
and start or end the day with yoga, meditation, or another 
refl ective activity (Wachter 2015). 
 Social media users interested in a digital detox should keep 
the following suggestions in mind (Hall 2014). First, users 
should recognize that feelings of withdrawal are temporary 
and detoxing from digital devices and social media is a process. 
Also, the time away should be replaced with a focus on offl  ine 
relationships and living their lives more fully. Instead of feeling

65
FoMO, those taking a break from digital devices can embrace 
JoMO, which is the joy of missing out. Time spent looking at 
a screen can be replaced by real experiences that provide happi-
ness as well as give detoxers an opportunity to reignite a passion 
for a particular hobby. 
 Studies have shown that unplugging is not easy for users. 
University of Maryland researchers found that when forced to 
unplug from technology for an entire day, nearly four in fi ve 
students experienced signifi cant mental and physical distress, 
panic, confusion, and extreme isolation (Relph 2012). Social 
media users who want to try detoxing for just one day can 
participate in the Annual Day of Unplugging, a project by the 
organization Reboot. Th e Annual Day of Unplugging, which 
runs from sundown to sundown starting on the fi rst Friday in 
March each year, is supported with organized events around 
the world. Users who visit the website nationaldayofunplug
ging.com can sign the pledge, access resources, learn about 
events, and upload a photo of themselves holding a sign that 
shares what they plan to do when they unplug. 
 Extensive social media usage not only impacts daily life, but 
it can also cause physical ailments. Th e Ford 2014 Trend Report 
found that 94 percent of respondents from the United States 
and 75 percent worldwide agree that “Finding time to discon-
nect and be alone with myself is important to my health” (Ford 
2013). In addition to the mental health benefi t of disconnect-
ing, users who control their social media addictions on smart-
phones can also prevent some of the physical ailments caused 
by smartphone use. For example, heavy smartphone users may 
experience headaches and neck aches. Florida chiropractor 
Dean Fishman coined the term “text neck” to describe the rever-
sal in the curvature of the spine that happens after extended 
smartphone use (Dayton 2015). Th e weight of the head, when 
tilted forward, puts increased pressure on the cervical spine and 
supporting muscles. Suggestions to prevent and overcome the 
problem of text neck include holding the smartphone up to 
eye level, taking frequent breaks, and performing exercises that 

66 
Social Media 
strengthen muscles behind the neck and between the shoulder 
blades (Dayton 2015). Focusing on a small screen to read text 
can also cause eyestrain, and users are encouraged to look into 
the distance occasionally to give their eyes a break (Chan 2011). 
 A study from Harvard Medical School also found that use of 
smartphones, laptops, and iPads at bedtime delays the release 
of sleep-inducing melatonin, which causes interference with 
sleep schedules (Gale 2014). A simple solution is to set a tech-
nology curfew and avoid using gadgets in bed. Th ose users who 
have a hard time not using devices in bed can use yellow-based 
lighting in the evening to block a screen’s blue wavelength 
light, which has been shown to aff ect melatonin production 
(Harvard Medical School 2012). Th ey can also use the soft-
ware f.lux, which alters the intensity and spectrum of light pro-
duced by screens according to the time of day. In 2016, Apple 
released iOS 9.3, which included a feature called Night Shift 
that changes the colors on the screen to warmer tones, away 
from blue light, depending on the time of day. 
 Th e relationship between social media use and sleep dis-
turbances has been explored in several studies. Researchers 
at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine surveyed 
1,788 adults to collect information about social media usage 
and sleep patterns and found that the average amount of time 
spent per day on social media was 61 minutes and the aver-
age number of visits to social media sites per week was 30 
(Levenson et al. 2016). Approximately 30 percent of respon-
dents also reported sleep issues. When respondents were 
divided into light and heavy users, those who checked social 
media more during the week were more likely than those who 
checked less to have sleep disturbances, and similarly, those 
who spent more time on social media per day were more likely 
than those who spent less to have sleep problems. In studies 
like this, it is important to note that although these two vari-
ables appear to move together, one does not necessarily cause 
the other. If a causal relationship exists, social media may cause 
sleep loss by displacing sleep, by creating so much arousal 

 
Problems, Controversies, and Solutions 
67
making it diffi  cult to sleep, or by being used on devices that 
emit light that impacts circadian rhythms. In contrast, sleep 
loss may increase social media usage as users pick up their 
devices when they cannot sleep. 
 Influence of Curated Content 
 Social media platforms with news feeds like Facebook and 
Twitter would overwhelm users if they presented all posted 
content in real time. Th e average Facebook user might have 
1,500 posts that could appear on the News Feed when he or 
she opens the site, and through an algorithm that ranks con-
tent and selects the content the user is most likely to engage 
with, Facebook selects approximately 300 posts for viewing 
(Boland 2014). Users with many Facebook connections could 
interact with 15,000 potential posts during each session, mak-
ing content curation in the News Feed even more important. 
Facebook defends this practice as providing a more positive 
and engaging experience for Facebook users who will be more 
likely to see content that engages them (Boland 2014). 
 Content publishers and other organizations that use Face-
book and other sites to promote their businesses, causes, 
products, or services are particularly concerned with how to 
make their posts appear organically in the feeds of their fol-
lowers without having to promote them through paid ads. For 
example, if a local restaurant posts content on Facebook, the 
restaurant would like those posts to appear in the News Feeds 
of followers. Organic reach refers to the average percentage of 
content posted by a page owner that its followers would see in 
their News Feeds. Over time, organic reach of Facebook posts 
has been diminishing dramatically. In February 2012, the aver-
age page follower would see 16 percent of posts made by a 
page owner. By March 2014, that percentage per follower had 
decreased to 6.51 percent (EdgeRank Checker 2014). 
 Facebook attributed the decrease in organic reach to 
increased content sharing (Boland 2014). As more content 

68 
Social Media 
was being posted and user engagement with the site remained 
unchanged, then it followed that users would be exposed to a 
smaller percentage of all content. Users are also liking more 
pages, by an average increase of 50 percent in 2013, which 
further intensifi es the competition among all these pages for 
placement on the News Feed (Constine 2014). 
 Facebook News Feed director of product management Will 
Cathcart described to  TechCrunch reporter Josh Constine how 
the visibility of posts is determined by a score calculated by 
100,000 factors (Constine 2014). Th e most important fac-
tors, according to Cathcart, included previous interest of the 
user in interacting with the content creator, the post’s perfor-
mance among other users, the performance of past content 
posted by the content creator, the type of post (status, photo, 
video, or link), and the recency of the post. Despite this tech-
nical description, the algorithm has been called “surprisingly 
inelegant, maddeningly mercurial, and stubbornly opaque” 
(Oremus 2016). 
 A study of Facebook conducted by EdgeRank Checker 
found that news outlets and others that create content that can 
be consumed on social media have more reach than compa-
nies who are posting marketing messages about their products. 
As Constine noted, “You can Like both  Th e New York Times 
and Oreos, but you can actually read the  NYT on News Feed 
whereas you can’t eat a cookie there. So it makes sense that the 
 NYT would reach a higher percentage of its fans—its posts are 
more interesting” (Constine 2014). 
 Others have challenged Facebook’s explanations, criticizing 
the company for forcing marketers into paid advertising for 
their posts to appear in the feed. Facebook, however, has dis-
puted that claim (Boland 2014). Th e challenge for marketers is 
to earn a spot on the News Feed by publishing posts that will 
get likes, comments, shares, and click-throughs. If users do not 
interact with posts, the reach for future posts will be impacted, 
setting off  a spiral into potential oblivion. 

 
Problems, Controversies, and Solutions 
69
 In 2016, Facebook once again tweaked its algorithm based 
on the results of survey research. Th e company employs a feed 
quality panel of more than 1,000 users who rate their Face-
book experiences and describe what improvements to content 
they would like to see. Additionally, the company surveys tens 
of thousands of people each day to understand how appeal-
ing they fi nd stories in their feeds. According to the company, 
through this research, “we are able to better understand which 
stories people would be interested in seeing near the top of 
their News Feed even if they choose not to click, like or com-
ment on them—and use this information to make ranking 
changes” (Zhang and Chen 2016). Research demonstrated 
that users had better experiences when they like the top stories 
in their feed. Stories that move to the top are those Facebook 
thinks people might take action on, such as liking, comment-
ing, or sharing, and what people may want to see at the top of 
their feed. Th e company contends that most page owners will 
see few changes in their Facebook referral traffi  c, but that oth-
ers may receive increases or declines (Zhang and Chen 2016). 
 Th e best way for page owners to get posts in front of con-
sumers and other audiences is to pay for advertising. At one 
time, Facebook placed paid ads only in the sidebar. Now, pro-
moted or sponsored posts appear in the News Feed alongside 
posts from friends, and any post created by a page owner can 
easily be converted into a paid advertisement. Other social 
media platforms have followed Facebook’s lead and now off er 
the opportunity for promoted posts. 
 Although Facebook curates content in its News Feed, it has 
yet to segment content on another part of the site. In con-
trast, Twitter has made changes to its platform to curate con-
tent for users on a tab called Moments, which organizes tweets 
and other content by topic. However, like Facebook, Twitter’s 
timeline is expected to undergo signifi cant changes in the way 
content is presented. In 2015, visitors to the site started seeing 
“while you were away” tweets near the top of their timelines. In 

70 
Social Media 
early 2016, a BuzzFeed report announced that Twitter was on 
the verge of introducing an algorithmic timeline, which sent 
users into panic mode (Kantrowitz 2016). Instead of a chrono-
logical feed, users would see content that Twitter believes they 
would be most interested in viewing. According to BuzzFeed 
News, “an algorithmic timeline represents a way for Twitter 
to elevate popular content, and could solve some of Twitter’s 
signal-to-noise problems. It is also widely assumed to be anath-
ema to the platform’s typically vocal power users” (Kantrowitz 
2016). Opponents of this change believe that the organic and 
unfi ltered stream of news diff erentiates Twitter from other 
social media and news sites. With an algorithm, important 
tweets that have not achieved the appropriate metrics to be 
highlighted could instead be buried. Th e protest in Ferguson, 
Missouri, for example, built steam on Twitter through the 
unfi ltered feed while news stories about the event did not crack 
the Facebook algorithm (Kantrowitz 2015). 
 Other social media platforms such as Snapchat and Insta-
gram are also providing curated content for users. Presenting 
content organized around a theme helps users explore a topic in 
more depth and also increases the opportunities for the platform 
to off er brand sponsorships and advertising around an event. 
Snapchat, for example, started off ering Live Stories in 2014 to 
follow live events such as concerts, sporting events, or political 
rallies. Th e advertising and sponsorship business model clicked, 
and the company increased live event coverage from one to two 
a week to several a day. Th e live events have proven their abil-
ity to attract millions of views, with the daily audience for Live 
Stories averaging 20 million people (Wagner 2015). 
 Although content curation off ers organized content for 
users and opportunities for sponsored content or advertis-
ing for marketers, the content selected may have a profound 
impact on users. Users may fi nd themselves in what has been 
called a “fi lter bubble” or an “echo chamber,” where the con-
tent they see is consistent with their political, cultural, or 
ideological beliefs. Facebook, in particular, has been criticized 

 
Problems, Controversies, and Solutions 
71
for using its algorithm to highlight posts that are consistent 
with a user’s viewpoint and suppressing posts from those who 
have dissenting viewpoints. Some of the awareness about the 
possibility of this practice has been generated by activist and 
author Eli Pariser, who gave a 2011 TED talk called “Beware 
Online ‘Filter Bubbles,’ ” which has been viewed by several 
million people. His talk describes how Facebook removed his 
conservative friends from his feed because the algorithm must 
have picked up that he clicked more on the links posted by 
liberal friends. A research study that explored this issue, how-
ever, found that content in the News Feed is only marginally 
more consistent with users’ own ideologies and that the nature 
of their friends and the content clicked on are more likely to 
predict the diversity of content in their feeds (Bakshy, Messing, 
and Adamic 2015). 
 In 2016, a former Facebook curator for the “Trending Topics” 
section revealed that Facebook was suppressing conservative 
stories (Nunez 2016). Even when trending organically, stories 
about Rand Paul, Mitt Romney, and other conservative issues 
were excluded from the list by workers. Conversely, when Face-
book users were not reading stories deemed important by man-
agement from 10 specifi ed news sites, other former curators 
described how they were instructed by management to place 
these stories in Trending Topics to gain some traction. After this 
exposé, Facebook fi red the curating team and replaced them 
with engineers who would instead manage an algorithm to 
determine Trending Topics. 
 Online Hoaxes, Rumors, and Scams 
 Sharing content is a popular activity on social media sites, dra-
matically changing the ways users become aware of issues and 
form opinions. Sometimes the source of the content is a repu-
table news organization, blog, or other website, but the rush to 
post breaking news may result in the publication of false infor-
mation. In some instances, however, the content intentionally 

72 
Social Media 
includes unfounded rumors, pranks, hoaxes, scams, or fake 
news stories. Because sharing on social media is as easy as click-
ing a button, fabricated stories and rumors can spread rapidly. 
 Research has shown that Facebook users will select content to 
share provided that it is an accepted message and fi ts into what 
they already believe (Del Vicario et al. 2016). Because Face-
book users tend to clump into homogeneous clusters, friends 
on social media are likely to process content through the same 
lens and share similar opinions, lessening the opportunity that 
any posted content would be challenged. Under these circum-
stances, it is possible for rumors and other unfounded content 
to proliferate. 
 A popular social media prank is to encourage people to post 
a message on their Facebook profi les under the false pretense 
that the post will result in a positive outcome or prevent a 
negative one. In 2015, Facebook users shared a post declar-
ing copyright protection of all personal information on Face-
book, including photos and videos (Dugle 2015). Facebook 
responded to this hoax by explaining that users already own 
the content they post to Facebook, making such a statement 
unnecessary. It is also unlikely that Facebook would ever cull 
through the profi les of its billions of users to see who had and 
had not made the copyright declaration. 
 Another prank in 2015 had people sharing messages on their 
Facebook profi les in hopes of receiving $4.5 million of the 
$4.5 billion worth of Facebook stock that Mark Zuckerberg 
was purportedly giving away “to people like YOU and ME!” 
as the post read (Emery 2015). Th e message explained that 
the prize money was a “way of saying thank you for making 
Facebook such a powerful vehicle for connection and philan-
thropy.” In fact, Zuckerberg had announced that he was going 
to donate 99 percent of his fortune to the Chan Zuckerberg 
Initiative, a company created by Zuckerberg and his wife, but 
not to users. Th e Facebook post was merely a prank. 
 A common Facebook scam uses a post with a coupon for 
$100 off  for stores like Target or Walmart. One purpose of the 

 
Problems, Controversies, and Solutions 
73
scam is to motivate people to like, share, or comment on the 
post so that it will spread further (Online Th reat Alerts 2015). 
Th e click-throughs from the post also help to make a certain 
Web page popular so that the site can then be sold to the high-
est bidder, along with the names and other information of 
people who interacted with the post. Furthermore, those who 
click through might be asked to complete a survey, and the 
scammers get paid from third-party sites for these completed 
surveys. 
 Another scam involves creating a cloned account for a Face-
book user. If a user friends an unknown person, it is possible for 
that Facebook “friend” to collect information about the user’s 
friends, clone the account to pose as the user, and then send 
friend requests to those friends (Kristof 2013). Once the scam-
mer has built up a strong following among the user’s friends, 
the scammer sends a message, such as “OMG. I’m overseas and 
was just robbed! I don’t even have enough to get home!” Th e 
scammer then requests fi nancial contributions from the user’s 
friends. In such situations, friends are likely to be suspicious 
and may even reach out with a text to check on the user, which 
is when the scam will be discovered. Another strategy of scam-
mers is to send what looks like a link to interesting content to 
the user’s friends but instead the link downloads malware onto 
their computers if they click on it. 
 Th ese scam situations can be avoided if users apply diligence 
and common sense in their use of Facebook and other social 
media sites. Users are advised to not accept friend requests 
from people they do not know and to also review the profi les 
of people they think they know who make requests. Th e pro-
fi le should be consistent with what the user knows about the 
friend. If not, it could be a cloned profi le. If a user discovers 
a cloned profi le, it can be reported to Facebook for removal. 
When money is requested by a friend for an emergency situa-
tion, those who are considering making a contribution should 
use other methods to ensure the request is legitimate. A friend 
in a desperate situation is likely to seek help from one person 

74 
Social Media 
who can help, such as a parent or close friend, rather than send-
ing a blast to all Facebook friends. Finally, although it is tempt-
ing to open links for “a funny video of you,” such wording 
often indicates the link will download malware. 
 Online hoaxes have also occurred on YouTube, often in the 
form of entertainers portraying themselves in a false light. Th e 
seemingly homemade videos of singer Marié Digby posted on 
YouTube in early 2007 attracted quite a following, and she 
started to generate radio airplay and have her music featured 
on the MTV program  Th e Hills . A press release in August 2007 
described how “Breakthrough YouTube Phenomenon Marié 
Digby Signs with Hollywood Records.” Although positioned 
by her record label as a breakout star who had been recently 
discovered and signed, Digby had actually been signed by 
Hollywood Records in late 2005, prior to posting YouTube 
videos. Before a  Wall Street Journal  reporter started investigat-
ing Digby’s background in 2007, the artist even had “none” 
checked under record label on her MySpace page. In the end, 
both the artist and her label admitted to and defended their 
eff orts, describing their strategy as building a following before 
the launch of her album (Smith and Lattman 2007). 
 Also in the early days of YouTube, a video series posted by 
lonelygirl15 involved a hoax that attracted a huge following. 
Th e videos appeared to showcase the real-life struggles of an 
average American teenager named Bree. After much specula-
tion, Bree’s identity was revealed to be New Zealand actress 
Jessica Rose, who was working in collaboration with fi lmmak-
ers Ramesh Flinders and Miles Beckett (Heff ernan and Zeller 
2006). Additionally, Creative Artists Agency was behind the 
creation of the videos. 
 Th e World Economic Forum has listed digital misinfor-
mation as a main threat to society (Del Vicario et al. 2016). 
Google and Facebook have both taken steps to highlight 
false or untrustworthy content. Google’s current algorithm 
bases search results on inbound links, so if a site has a lot of 
other sites linking to it, it is judged to be of higher quality 

 
Problems, Controversies, and Solutions 
75
and, therefore, deserves a higher rank in the search results. Th e 
problem with this method is that if many people link to a site 
of misinformation, it will continue to attract attention because 
it will appear higher in search results. Google’s more recent 
program to rank Web pages on the accuracy of information 
is called “Knowledge-Based Trust” (Hodson 2015). Google 
has collected information and other known facts in a database 
called Knowledge Graph, which was fi rst introduced in 2012. 
Using Knowledge-Based Trust, pages are ranked by compar-
ing facts on the website with those stored in the Knowledge 
Graph. In early tests, the system was able to reliably predict the 
trustworthiness of the sources. Th e downside to this technol-
ogy is that the trust scores of Web pages with facts not in the 
Knowledge Graph are more diffi  cult to determine. 
 In 2015, Facebook tweaked its algorithm to limit the impact 
of stories that might be false (Oremus 2015). Although the 
stories were not removed, they were instead downplayed in 
the News Feed. Facebook added the option for users to fl ag a 
story as false when it appeared in their feeds. Facebook’s algo-
rithm also examined how many users who shared the story later 
deleted it, based on the assumption that they may have had 
regrets about posting a fake story. Furthermore, a fl agged post 
was also marked with a warning that it could contain incorrect 
information. 
 Despite these eff orts, the presidential campaign of 2016 was 
likely impacted by the onslaught of fake news websites that 
used Facebook and Twitter to spread fake stories. According 
to the Pew Research Center, almost half of the U.S. popula-
tion and about two-thirds of Facebook users are getting news 
from the site (Gottfried and Shearer 2016). Th e fake news 
and political websites that fl ourished during this election were 
mostly only interested in traffi  c from social media sites for the 
purpose of driving up revenues through advertisements hosted 
on the websites. Th e more outrageous the news story, particu-
larly if it refl ected negatively on Democratic nominee Hillary 
Clinton, the more likely it was to receive clicks. Some of these 

76 
Social Media 
sites have been traced to teens in Macedonia seeking to profi t 
from the U.S. election. BuzzFeed identifi ed more than 100 of 
these websites from this Greek region with names like World
Politicus.com, TrumpVision365.com, USConservativeToday
.com, DonaldTrumpNews.co, and USADailyPolitics.com 
(Silverman and Alexander 2016). 
 One of the most popular stories included that Facebook, 
Twitter, and Google were burying news of an FBI investigation 
of Clinton, which was tweeted by Donald Trump. Other popu-
lar fake stories included one posted on a fake ABC News site 
that reported a man was paid $3,500 by the Clinton campaign 
to protest at a Trump rally (which was retweeted by Eric Trump, 
Ann Coulter, and Trump’s former campaign manager Corey 
Lewandowski) and a tweet from a fake CNN account reporting 
a signifi cant lead for Trump in Florida on election day just after 
polls opened. Other fake sites included the “Denver Guardian,” 
which ran a story about how an FBI investigator into the Clinton 
e-mail scandal was found dead, and a “Christian Times News-
paper” story that reported 10,000+ sealed ballots with Clin-
ton’s name selected were being stored in ballot boxes in an 
Ohio warehouse. ( Christian Times newspaper is a legitimate 
source, but is not affi  liated with the website that appropriated 
its name.) A story from the Macedonian site ConservativeState
.com proclaimed that Hillary Clinton said in 2013, “I Would 
Like to See People Like Donald Trump Run for Offi  ce; 
Th ey’re Honest and Can’t Be Bought,” which racked up almost 
500,000 likes, shares, and comments. Other false claims from 
Macedonian sites included that the Pope endorsed Trump and 
that Mike Pence said Michelle Obama is the “most vulgar fi rst 
lady we’ve ever had,” which combined with two other fake 
posts reviewed by BuzzFeed received more than 1 million likes, 
shares, and comments (Silverman and Alexander 2016). In the 
wake of the election after recognizing the impact fake news can 
have on public opinion and facing a public outcry, Facebook 
introduced some experiments to more aggressively address and 
combat the issue of fake news (Isaac 2016). 

 
Problems, Controversies, and Solutions

 In addition to fake tweets during the 2016 election, Twitter 
users were previously fooled by other false reports of news. In 
2015, a story about an impending Twitter buyout for $31 bil-
lion was created by an unidentifi ed scammer, who posted it on 
a fake  Bloomberg News site after which it was circulated by jour-
nalists and others on Twitter and through other means (Farrell 
2015). Th e rumor increased the stock price by 8 percent within 
eight minutes. When the story was confi rmed by a  Bloomberg 
News  source to be false, the stock price sunk to lower than it 
was prior to the rumor. Even though the error was quickly cor-
rected, the scammer and others still had enough time to benefi t 
from the rumor. Hackers have even gained access to high-profi le 
Twitter accounts and distributed false information. One of the 
more infamous examples involved the hacked Twitter account 
of the Associated Press and the resulting tweet: “Breaking: 
Two Explosions in the White House and Barack Obama Is 
Injured.” Although only up for a few minutes, the tweet was 
retweeted 3,000 times and incited a 143-point plunge in the 
stock market (Kelly 2013). 
 Th e Boston Marathon bombing and Ebola cases in the 
United States are two examples of crises that spurred rumors 
throughout social media. A study by University of Washing-
ton researchers of the Boston Marathon rumors found that 
tweets with incorrect information spread faster and wider 
than tweets with correct information (Starbird et al. 2014). 
One tweet incorrectly stated that an eight-year-old girl running 
in the marathon had died in the bombing, and the research team 
found this rumor was tweeted more than 90,000 times and 
the correction only 2,000. Another popular Boston Marathon 
rumor was that the perpetrators may have been part of U.S. 
military special operations, possibly Navy SEALs. Th e source 
of this rumor was a photo widely circulated on social news site 
Reddit and bulletin board 4chan of two men standing together 
in similar clothes and backpacks with one wearing a hat with an 
emblem. Th e researchers found Twitter conversation about this 
tweet generated about 4,500 tweets with a signifi cant number 

78 
Social Media 
of the tweets referencing misinformation instead of correc-
tions. Th e fi nal rumor studied involved the misidentifi cation 
of a missing Brown University student as one of the bomb-
ers. In photos released by the FBI, it was noted that the stu-
dent resembled “Suspect #2,” and the rumor went viral when 
Twitter users, including high school classmates of the student, 
tweeted about the resemblance. Th e almost 30,000 tweets mis-
identifying the bomber still exhibited many more with mis-
information than corrections until the Tsarnaev brothers were 
named as suspects, which ended the spread of misinformation 
shortly thereafter. 
 In the case of the fatal disease Ebola, residents of Newark, 
Miami, and Washington, D.C., continued to tweet rumors sug-
gesting Ebola had been unleashed in those cities even after the 
isolated potential cases in those cities tested negative (Luckerson 
2014). Iowa residents believed that Ebola had affl  icted some-
one in the state, and the state’s Department of Public Health 
had to step in to dispel the rumor. Other tweets inaccurately 
suggested that Ebola is spread through air, water, and food, 
therefore creating more of a panic. 
 Sometimes citizen journalism is to blame for false informa-
tion that is widely distributed on Twitter. People on the scene 
of a particularly hectic situation, such as a bombing, riot, or 
natural disaster, interpret the events through their fi rst-hand 
perspective, but will not necessarily report the events accurately 
on social media sites, such as Twitter. Twitter is particularly 
viral in these crisis situations because it off ers a public site that 
pulls all forms of content from a variety of viewpoints from 
offi  cials and news organizations to eyewitnesses on a platform 
easily searchable using a hashtag or a keyword. 
 Visual content sites like Pinterest and Instagram are also 
targets of hoaxes and scams. On these sites, a common hoax 
involves photoshopped images. Users may believe that, in 
nature, one can fi nd purple trees, blue watermelons, or rainbow-
colored owls. Some Pinterest users manage boards to debunk 
Pinterest hoaxes, such as the board available at: pinterest.com/

trainrgrl/hoaxes. Scammers on these platforms may also set up 
bogus accounts to follow users with the hope of gaining fol-
lowers so that the promoted images will be seen or the links 
will be clicked, which may earn scammers click-through fees. 
Surveys are also used in exchange for a free gift, but the scam-
mers instead receive a “gift” of the user’s personal information. 
 Most social media hoaxes and scams are relatively harm-
less, ranging from those that encourage people to post con-
tent on their social media profi les to entertainers who do not 
portray themselves authentically. Sites like Snopes provide 
background that can help users determine whether something 
shared on social media is a hoax or scam; therefore, it is recom-
mended that concerned social media users check that site for 
any information. Users are also cautioned against clicking on 
quizzes, images, and other content that might help scammers 
gather personal information to sell or download viruses on 
victims’ computers. 
 Cyberbullying, Sexting, and Child Predators 
 Cyberbullying, sexting, and child predators on social media sites 
are common concerns of parents, teenagers, educators, and law 
enforcement. Other issues related to teen use of social media 
include solicitations to engage in sexual talk or behavior and 
exposure to sexual content online. Th ese negative aspects of 
social media will often be featured in the news because they 
make frightening stories that capture the attention of a general 
audience. Not every teen, however, who uses social media will 
be exposed to these abuses, but it is still important for vulner-
able groups to be educated on how to avoid and handle these 
situations. 
 Online victimization has been categorized into three types, 
which include solicitation to engage in sexual talk or behavior, 
unwanted exposure to sexual materials, and Internet harass-
ment, commonly referred to as cyberbullying (Finkelhor, 
Mitchell, and Wolak 2001). Th e Youth Internet Safety Surveys 

80 
Social Media 
conducted in 2000, 2005, and 2010 with a sample of 1,500 
teenagers aged 10 to 17 demonstrate changes in sexual solicita-
tion, unwanted exposure to content, and online harassment 
during an important time when Internet users moved away 
from the chat rooms and websites of the early 2000s to the 
social media platforms that emerged and grew in popularity by 
the end of the decade (Jones, Mitchell, and Finkelhor 2012). 
 Th roughout the time period studied in the Youth Internet 
Safety Surveys, unwanted sexual solicitation decreased from 
19 percent in 2000 to 9 percent in 2010. Th e researchers sug-
gested that the decline may be a result of teens moving from 
chat rooms with strangers to social networks where they are 
interacting with peers. Th e teens may also be more educated 
about online predators and are therefore more cautious about 
their online interactions. Although 34 percent experienced 
unwanted exposure to pornography in 2005, the percentage 
decreased to 23 percent by 2010. Some of the decline may be 
attributed to spam fi lters that remove this content from inboxes 
and increased sophistication of users who understand the pos-
sible consequences of clicking on unfamiliar links or opening 
unknown content. In contrast, experiences with online harass-
ment either as a victim or as a perpetrator increased from 6 per-
cent in 2000 to 11 percent in 2010. Th e researchers attributed 
this increase to more online interactions with peers and the lag-
ging eff orts of educational campaigns about cyberbullying at a 
time when more focus was placed on issues such as online sexual 
solicitation. Th ey also added that bullying may not be increas-
ing, but that the bullying that occurs offl  ine has migrated online 
over time (Jones, Mitchell, and Finkelhor 2012). 
 Risk factors of online victimization have been classifi ed into 
those that are technology-based, interpersonal, and intraper-
sonal (Call and Burrow-Sanchez 2010). First, using technology 
obviously increases the risk for online victimization, and com-
mon mistakes in using technology include misspelling a word 
in a Google search, downloading content from a fi le-sharing 

 
Problems, Controversies, and Solutions 
81
site, and disclosing personal information online, which could 
be used by a predator to target a potential victim. Often, teens 
who engage in risky behaviors are not aware of online dangers. 
A major interpersonal factor is forming online friendships with 
strangers, especially when the user is willing to share personal 
information or engage in sexual talk. Aggressive behavior in 
online communication, such as posting rude comments, also 
increases the likelihood of victimization. Parent–child rela-
tions are also important, as children who have been given more 
guidance by parents as well as children with less confl ict in 
the home are less likely to be online victims. Offl  ine physical and 
sexual abuse is another predictor of online victimization. Finally, 
certain intrapersonal factors may make a teen more likely to be 
victimized, such as the demographics of gender and race. Th e 
relationships formed online are also impacted by intrapersonal 
factors, such as mental illness, homosexuality, or diffi  culty with 
offl  ine relationships (Call and Burrow-Sanchez 2010). 
 Defi ned as bullying that occurs on a digital platform, cyber-
bullying is found throughout the spectrum of social media 
sites. Although some people may reject the concept of cyber-
bullying with the argument that bullying occurred long before 
the introduction of online media, cyberbullying is particularly 
problematic for its victims. Hurtful comments and rumors are 
easily launched within the online environment, and depending 
on the social network, the sender may remain anonymous or 
hide behind a fake profi le. Additionally, social media provide 
a means to both capture and distribute embarrassing content 
which can spread to a wide network very quickly. Th e content 
can also be diffi  cult to completely remove from social media 
and the Internet as copies are easily made and posted. Finally, 
social media are available to users 24/7. Th e messages are diffi  -
cult for bullied teens to ignore, given that they are often placed 
on the social media sites frequented by the victim and even the 
victim’s own profi le. Even if the target of the bully avoids social 
media, the messages may still be viewable to others. 

82 
Social Media 
 Th e Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance survey for 2013 con-
ducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
examined cyberbullying rates as well as demographic factors. 
Th e study found that approximately 15 percent of high school 
student respondents reported they had experienced electronic 
bullying (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2014). 
More girls (21 percent) than boys (8.5 percent) reported being 
the victims of online bullies. Th e practice also decreased with 
grade, with ninth-graders (16.1 percent) experiencing more 
online bullying than twelfth-graders (13.5 percent). 
 Cyberbullying can lead to criminal charges. For example, 
in November 2013, police arrested a 15-year-old Florida girl 
who they said sent hundreds of threats over an eight-day period 
using the messaging app Kik such as, “You’re a pathetic piece 
of s—,” “Nobody likes you, “and “I hate you so much.” Another 
message informed the recipient that she should commit suicide 
to avoid being murdered. Th e bully was charged with three 
counts of aggravated stalking and one count of tampering with 
a witness (Phippen 2013). 
 Th e most tragic cyberbullying cases are those that end with 
the victim committing suicide. One of the prominent early 
cases of social media cyberbullying occurred on MySpace when 
13-year-old Megan Meier formed an online friendship with 
16-year-old Josh Evans. In the beginning, Josh helped to build 
Megan’s self-esteem, but then he quickly turned on Megan 
with messages that became increasingly more cruel, including 
statements such as “Th e world would be a better place without 
you.” Other classmates also piled on to post hurtful messages. 
One day in October 2006, Megan walked away from her com-
puter, went to her bedroom, hanged herself in her closet, and 
died the following day. Later, it was discovered that “Josh” was 
actually a fake profi le created by neighbor Lori Drew, Drew’s 
employee, and Drew’s daughter, a former friend of Megan’s. 
Although Drew had been indicted on one count of conspiracy 
and three counts of Computer Fraud and Abuse Act violations, 
she was later acquitted (Zetter 2009).

 Recommendations for parents to deal with cyberbullying 
include talking to teens about what to do if they are the victim 
of a bully as well as how to avoid being one themselves, equip-
ping them with tools to deal with bullying, encouraging them 
to sign a no-bullying pledge, asking them to stand up for vic-
tims, and explaining how to take action if the teen is a victim. In 
these conversations, teens need to realize that the consequences 
of what they say online can be very serious. Although rude or 
derogatory comments might be protected by the First Amend-
ment, threatening statements may not be. Advice for teens is 
to avoid using social media as a tool to hurt others and to let 
parents know about any hurtful messages posted online about 
them. Several anti-bullying sites, such as StopBullying.gov and 
the Cyberbullying Research Center, provide guides to state 
laws, explain ways to report cyberbullying, and off er additional 
resources. 
 Another issue related to technology and social media is sex-
ting, which is sending sexually explicit messages and photos, 
usually through texts. Sexting is related to cyberbullying in 
that the sexual content can be used to target or bully a stu-
dent (called sextortion), especially if the content gets out of 
the hands of the original recipient and is shared with others on 
social media sites or elsewhere. When a naked photo of a teen-
ager under the age of 18 is distributed, many states classify such 
content as child pornography, and those who create and/or dis-
tribute the content can then be charged as perpetrators of child 
pornography. A recent trend has been to reduce the penalties 
for minors who snap sexting selfi es to misdemeanors or warn-
ings. Florida, for example, is one state that before 2011 would 
have charged teens with a felony and required registration as 
a sex off ender for such off enses, but new legislation eased the 
penalties for the fi rst off ense to community service and a small 
fi ne (CNN Wire Staff  2011). 
 Teens and other social media users may also be lured into a 
relationship with someone they meet online, which can lead 
to serious consequences. A 2014 study sponsored by Cox 

84 
Social Media 
Communications found that 18 percent of respondents have 
considered meeting someone in person that they fi rst met 
online, while 58 percent of those teens have actually done so 
(Th e Futures Company 2014). Many of these relationships may 
be harmless, such as someone who is connected to a known 
person, such as the cousin of a friend. However, teens can eas-
ily be lured into meeting someone in real life who is posing as 
a fellow teen in order to cause harm. For example, a teen girl 
might think she has been building a relationship with a teen 
boy online, but that teen boy is actually a man. 
 YouTuber Coby Persin conducted an online experiment 
with three teenage girls (with parental permission) by fi rst cre-
ating a fake Facebook profi le, friending the girls, and then see-
ing what kind of judgment they would display when invited to 
meet him in person (Mahoney 2015). Th e scenarios included 
meeting Persin in a park, allowing him over to a girl’s house, 
and getting into a car with him, all of which were done by 
the girls. Th e video featuring the three scenarios garnered more 
than 43 million views and was followed by one that used a girl’s 
profi le to lure boys, which was equally successful in its experi-
ment and received more than 17 million views. Most of the 
parents who were interviewed beforehand believed that their 
child would not be willing to meet a complete stranger and 
were shocked at the outcome. 
 Monitoring behavior of teens on social media sites is a 
concern of many parents. In order to protect their children, 
parents should investigate a variety of approaches such as 
using software to monitor accounts or having user names and 
passwords to their children’s social media accounts. A 2016 
study by the Pew Research Center found that 60 percent of 
respondents with children aged 13–17 have reviewed their 
children’s social media accounts for questionable or unsavory 
content (Sass 2016). Of the respondents, 56 percent have 
friended their children on various social media platforms and 
35 percent know the passwords to their children’s social media 

 
Problems, Controversies, and Solutions 
85
accounts. Only 16 percent use tracking tools. A Cox Com-
munications study found similar results in that 51 percent of 
parents monitor their children’s social media usage in some 
way (Th e Futures Company 2014). 
 Another preventative measure is to encourage parents to talk 
to their children about Internet safety, with an emphasis on not 
disclosing personal information and engaging in conversation 
with strangers. Th e Cox Communications study found that 
9 of 10 teens have talked to their parents about Internet safety, 
with 86 percent of those teens having had the talk in the past 
year (Th e Futures Company 2014). Th e problem with this 
intervention, however, is that it avoids addressing some of the 
key risk factors that lead to victimization (Call and Burrow-
Sanchez 2010). Th e following four components to an Internet 
safety education program are suggested: (1) informing teens 
about dangers and ways to engage in positive communication, 
(2) using peers as positive change agents, (3) including family 
members in the promotion of Internet safety, and (4) address-
ing the needs of the most vulnerable teens (Call and Burrow-
Sanchez 2010). 
 Despite all the risks, many teens are savvy about social media, 
with some of these digital natives being more sophisticated than 
their parents. As a result, almost half of respondents admitted 
to hiding their online behavior from their parents, taking such 
actions as clearing their search history and cookies (46 percent), 
using a private browsing option (20 percent), or disabling the 
software their parents had installed on their phones, tablets, or 
computers (8 percent) (Th e Futures Company 2014). Parents 
who have access to their children’s social media accounts, either 
through a password or a friend relationship, should not remain 
too complacent about their ability to monitor online activity. 
Some other teen tactics include moving to social media sites 
that are unfamiliar to or not used by their parents. For example, 
although a parent might have access to their child’s Facebook 
account, the child may be having conversations and sharing 

86 
Social Media 
content on sites like Snapchat or Instagram or even create a 
second, more private profi le on a particular platform. 
 Negative Moods, Feelings of Loneliness, and Envy 
 If social media platforms always made users feel sad, they 
would not be nearly as popular as they are. Social media are 
similar to other forms of media such as television and newspa-
pers in their ability to evoke both positive and negative reac-
tions. Since the introduction of the uses and gratifi cations 
approach to studying media by Katz, Blumler, and Gurevitch 
(1973–1974) in the early 1970s, many other studies have 
explored how people use media and the benefi ts they receive 
from their usage. Bartsch and Viehoff  (2010) summarized the 
results of some of the studies on emotional gratifi cations from 
media usage, which include intense sensations, management 
of mood, an escape from real-life relationships, the building 
of parasocial relationships with characters, the opportunity to 
have vicarious experiences, and downward social comparisons. 
Even though social media can be compared to traditional 
forms of media, social media are distinctive in that they allow 
for real-time two-way communication with people in a user’s 
online social network, many of whom are typically also offl  ine 
connections. 
 Some studies have suggested that social media usage impacts 
mood, feelings of loneliness, and envy when users compare 
their lives to that of others. Other studies describe positive emo-
tions that result from building and maintaining relationships 
on social media platforms. Presented with a unique set of chal-
lenges, social media users are learning how to negotiate these 
platforms to avoid negative emotions and enhance positive 
ones. Th e direction of the emotional response may, in fact, be 
situational. For example, passive browsing on Facebook could 
result in feelings of envy for the lifestyles showcased in the pho-
tos of friends, while active engagement in conversations with 
friends could prove satisfying. Furthermore, the personality, 

 
Problems, Controversies, and Solutions 
87
mood, or offl  ine experiences of the user may predict how social 
media usage will impact his or her emotional response. 
 A growing body of research has provided insight into the 
eff ects of Facebook on mood. A controversial 2012 experiment 
by Facebook, conducted unknowingly on almost 700,000 
users, found that the nature of Facebook posts impact mood, 
a phenomenon called emotional contagion (Kramer, Guillory, 
and Hancock 2014). One group in the study was exposed to 
posts lacking words that are considered to evoke positive emo-
tions, while another group saw posts lacking words thought 
to evoke negative emotions. In turn, the group shown posts 
with fewer positive words subsequently wrote posts with fewer 
positive words, while those shown posts minimizing negative 
words wrote posts with fewer negative words. 
 Other research has demonstrated that extensive use of Face-
book, despite the nature of the posts seen, results in a belief that 
the participant’s time was not used in meaningful way, con-
tributing to a worse mood (Sagioglou and Greitemeyer 2014). 
In this study, researchers allowed participants to browse either 
Facebook or the Web for 20 minutes. Th ose in the Facebook 
group reported being in a worse mood, which was attributed 
to how they felt about the meaningfulness of the time spent 
online. Th e researchers concluded that users will continue to 
return to Facebook because of an “aff ective forecasting error,” 
which is the mistaken assumption that they would actually feel 
more positive after spending time on Facebook. 
 Social media users can experience a feeling of validation 
when their friends acknowledge posts through comments and 
likes. A study of online interpersonal neglect by Greitemeyer, 
Mügge, and Bollermann (2014) found that having a large net-
work of friends does not compensate for the psychological dis-
satisfaction felt when social media users receive few responses to 
their posts. Th e researchers explored this relationship by having 
participants view their birthday wishes from their last birthday 
and then respond to questions about mood. Th e study found 
that posts on a user’s profi le can impact his or her needs for 

88 
Social Media 
belonging, self-esteem, control, and meaningful existence. Th e 
lack of birthday greetings on Facebook may even be more dev-
astating to a user because it is displayed publicly and showcases 
the user’s value to his or her network. 
 Despite serving as a robust social network, Facebook may also 
contribute to feelings of loneliness. Eric Klinenberg, author of 
 Going Solo: Th e Extraordinary Rise and Surprising Appeal of Liv-
ing Alone , wrote, “Reams of published research show that it’s 
the quality, not the quantity of social interaction that best pre-
dicts loneliness” (Klinenberg 2013). Scholars and other critics 
are now questioning whether Facebook and other social media 
sites distance people from “real” offl  ine relationships or allow 
for opportunities to bring people together in new ways. Most 
users can probably think of circumstances where Facebook and 
other social media sites have both hindered and helped per-
sonal relationships. Someone might spend so much time on 
Facebook that it becomes an entertainment substitute for other 
opportunities, such as going to dinner or a party with friends. 
At the same time, Facebook might help connect a user with an 
old friend when one is traveling to the other’s hometown or 
help maintain bonds between friends who now live in distant 
cities so that the relationship does not decay over time. In the 
1990s, the term  Internet paradox was coined to describe how 
technology causes users to both connect and disengage with 
society (Kraut et al. 1998). In a world where people are more 
connected than ever, is it possible to experience such loneliness 
and detachment? 
 An Australian study found that Facebook users had lower 
levels of social loneliness, which describes a feeling of lacking 
friendship bonds, and higher level of family loneliness, where 
they did not feel connected to family (Ryan and Xenos 2011). 
Th erefore, Facebook may connect people to friends outside the 
home to the detriment of the relationships they have with their 
family within the household. Th e researchers also looked at 
personality traits and found Facebook users to be more extro-
verted and narcissistic than nonusers, while nonusers were 

 
Problems, Controversies, and Solutions 
89
more conscientious and socially lonely. Th ey also concluded 
that Facebook use depends on certain personality factors. 
 A study of adolescents found that feelings of loneliness are 
related to motives for using Facebook (Teppers et al. 2014). Th e 
researchers concluded that “In general, our fi ndings showed 
that peer-related loneliness is an important personality char-
acteristic that predicts adolescents’ Facebook motives and, in 
turn, is positively predicted by the social skills compensation 
motive and negatively by the meeting people motive” (Teppers 
et al. 2014, 695). If teens are using Facebook to make connec-
tions and communicate with friends, usage of the site is pre-
dicted to lessen their feelings of loneliness over time. Users will 
receive an emotional gratifi cation from this expanded network 
and feel less lonely. However, the researchers found feelings of 
loneliness may escalate if the teen has poor social skills and uses 
Facebook to compensate for other forms of interpersonal con-
tact. Th e researchers hypothesized that teens with poor social 
skills feel lonelier as a result of Facebook use and suggested the 
following reasons: (1) teens are not able to transfer the com-
fort they feel communicating on Facebook to offl  ine situations, 
(2) the time spent in superfi cial communication with online 
friends may displace time that would have been spent build-
ing deeper offl  ine relationships, and (3) Facebook use impacts 
social comparisons leading to dissatisfaction. 
 Social media usage is linked to the acquisition of social 
capital, which is defi ned as the benefi ts attained from the 
social structure (Ellison, Steinfi eld, and Lampe 2007). Social 
capital is segmented into bridging social capital, or informa-
tion acquired through a diverse network, and bonding social 
capital, or emotional support provided by friends. A study 
that compared directed communication on Facebook, which 
includes the posts, comments, and likes of friends, to consump-
tion of the content posted by friends found that while directed 
communication correlates with heightened feelings of bond-
ing social capital and lower loneliness, consumption is related 
to lower bridging and bonding social capital and increased 

90 
Social Media 
loneliness (Burke, Marlow, and Lento 2010). Th e most coun-
terintuitive result to the research team was that consumption 
was not related to increased feelings of bridging social capital. 
Additionally, overall activity on Facebook, particularly friend 
count, is positively related to both forms of social capital and 
negatively related to loneliness. Th e researchers interpreted the 
results in the following ways. First, socially connected people 
are attracted to sites that reaffi  rm those relationships. Next, 
Facebook allows for the building and maintenance of distant 
or new relationships. Finally, social media platforms off er a 
positive feedback loop whereby liking and commenting on the 
content of others will be returned to that user in the form of 
likes and comments on his or her content. 
 Some of the questions about social media sites and feelings 
of depression, loneliness, and other negative emotions are those 
of causation. Does Facebook cause these emotions or do peo-
ple experiencing these emotions turn to Facebook for comfort? 
A study by Kross et al. (2013) of 82 Facebook users whose 
mood was tracked via surveys fi ve times a day for two weeks 
found that the use of Facebook between surveys contributed to 
a worse mood and that overall satisfaction with life for those 
who were frequent Facebook users during the course of the 
study declined. Th ose participants who had made social con-
tacts in the real world either by phone or in person between 
surveys reported more positive feelings. Th e researchers con-
cluded that the decline in well-being that is linked to Facebook 
use is not because depressed people are more likely to gravitate 
to Facebook, but that Facebook itself has an impact on users. 
 Social media sites, especially Facebook, may also create feel-
ings of envy when users view the seemingly endless photos 
and posts showcasing vacations, engagement rings, weddings, 
babies, parties, homes, athletic or academic achievements of 
children, cars, and job promotions. In addition to the amount 
of information that can be viewed about others, social media 
users may also be anxious that others will view their profi les less 
favorably in comparison. Th e environment increases the need 

 
Problems, Controversies, and Solutions 
91
for impression management, whereby a user highlights certain 
positive aspects of his or her life while downplaying others, 
creating a perception that is better than reality. 
 Researchers studying social media envy found that slightly 
more than 20 percent of recent scenarios where the partici-
pants were envious occurred on Facebook with the main areas 
of envy on Facebook being the vacations, happiness, and the 
online social interaction of others (Krasnova et al. 2013). 
Th ose users in their mid-thirties were more likely to envy fam-
ily happiness, and women of all ages were more likely to envy 
physical beauty. Th e researchers also found that envy mediates 
the relationship between passive Facebook following and life 
satisfaction. Intense passive following (i.e., looking at profi les 
and not interacting with users) leads to social comparison and 
feelings of envy, which then have an impact on life satisfaction. 
Social media envy inevitably leads to pain, which the user will 
attempt to minimize through avoidance of particular friends or 
even unfriending those friends. Other responses may include 
more self-promotion on the part of the user, possibly through 
an exaggeration of accomplishments. Th e researchers referred 
to this behavior as the  self-promotion-envy spiral . When users are 
exposed to the self-promotional content of others that makes 
them envious, they counter with their own self-promotional 
content, which may make other users envious. Th ey found that 
men were more likely to discuss accomplishments as a form of 
self-promotion while women highlighted their looks and social 
lives. 
 Another study on Facebook envy surveyed users and found 
that browsing Facebook resulted in symptoms of depression 
when comparisons to the lives of others created feelings of envy 
(Tandoc, Ferucci, and Duff y 2014). When browsing did not 
lead to envy, users experienced lower levels of depression. In 
another examination of Facebook users, the researchers found 
that those who spent more time on the site as well as those 
who had Facebook friends they did not know personally were 
more likely to agree that others had better lives than themselves 

92 
Social Media 
(Chou and Edge 2012). Users who spent more time on Face-
book were also more likely to have the perception that others 
were happier than themselves and less likely to agree that life 
is fair. On the positive side, those users who have more Face-
book friends were less likely to agree that others were happier 
and more likely to agree that life is fair. To curb perceptions 
that others are happier or their lives are better, the research-
ers encouraged deeper interactions with friends in offl  ine set-
tings, which off er a more balanced view of the lives of friends 
instead of just the positive information they choose to post on 
Facebook. 
 Despite these fi ndings, other studies have found positive 
emotional outcomes from social media use. For example, the 
majority of teens in the 2012 Common Sense Media study 
indicated that social media did not impact their emotional 
well-being, and of those who reported having been aff ected 
by social media, more teens reported positive outcomes rather 
than negative results (Rideout 2012). For example, social media 
usage was linked to greater confi dence by 20 percent of respon-
dents (4 percent said less), feeling more outgoing by 28 percent 
of respondents (5 percent said less), feeling more popular by 
19 percent of respondents (4 percent said less), lower levels of 
depression by 10 percent of respondents (5 percent said more), 
and lower levels of shyness by 29 percent of respondents (3 per-
cent said more). Additionally, 15 percent of users said they felt 
better about themselves because they use social media, while 
4 percent said they felt worse. 
 Other circumstances highlight contexts when Facebook use 
may improve or at least have no negative impact on the mood 
of the user. In a study, Sagioglou and Greitemeyer (2014) 
found that making plans or connecting with friends on Face-
book heightens mood. Lin and Utz (2015) found that positive 
emotions are more likely than negative to be experienced while 
using Facebook and are more likely to occur when a “strong 
tie” friend as opposed to a “weak tie” acquaintance makes a

93
positive post. Verduyn et al. (2015) found that although pas-
sive Facebook usage, such as browsing, has led to decreases in 
aff ective well-being through feelings of envy, active Facebook 
usage had neither a positive nor a negative eff ect. 
 Verduyn et al. (2015) discussed why people continue to use 
Facebook passively (at a rate of 50 percent more than active 
users) if it negatively impacts their well-being. First, research 
has documented the addictive powers of Facebook and other 
social media sites, and similar to other addictive behaviors, peo-
ple will continue to engage despite the negative consequences. 
Second, users enjoy interacting with others and exposure to 
interesting and entertaining content on social media sites, so 
it is possible that users consider the pros of usage to outweigh 
the cons. Finally, people may be unaware of the connection 
between their feelings and Facebook usage. 
 To combat problems related to social media use and mood, 
depression, loneliness, and envy, social media users should con-
sider how to use the platforms in a way that increases positive 
emotions and suppresses negative ones. One suggestion is to 
block friends whose posts are troublesome, such as those who 
boast too much about accomplishments or post political con-
tent about a party, candidate, or issue not supported by the 
user. Users can also follow pages that post positive content, 
such as Upworthy, Th e Happiness Project, 1,000 Awesome 
Th ings, or the Huffi  ngton Post: Good News. Users should also 
maximize the features of the platforms for their personal gain. 
For example, users can maintain relationships on Facebook, but 
then use the site to organize real-life interactions. LinkedIn and 
Twitter are both benefi cial for making professional contacts. 
Social media users might also be interested in participating in 
a happiness or gratitude project, where they share specifi c con-
tent on social media. Users can also share uplifting or posi-
tive content they fi nd on the Web, such as an inspirational 
video or quote. In the end, it is important to remember that 
social media is a tool, and if it is not off ering desirable content, 

94 
Social Media 
useful features, or valuable relationships expected by the user, 
the user can always become a nonuser. 
 Pressure to Project the Ideal Self 
 Th e popular 2013 song “Selfi e” by Th e Chainsmokers expressed 
the attitudes of many social media users who are focused on 
projecting a favorable image on social media sites. Th e lyrics 
include the following lines about a selfi e: “I only got 10 likes in 
the last 5 minutes/Do you think I should take it down?” Th e 
subsequent lyrics answer the question by suggesting taking 
another selfi e. 
 Social media sites allow users to create an idealized or 
curated version of their lives and then connect with others who 
can view this particular presentation of self. As described by 
Marche (2012), “Self-presentation on Facebook is continuous, 
intensely mediated, and possessed of a phony nonchalance that 
eliminates even the potential for spontaneity . . . Curating the 
exhibition of the self has become a 24/7 occupation.” A 2014 
trend report by Ford found that 74 percent of respondents in 
the United States believe that people portray themselves more 
favorably on social media than they do in real life (Ford 2013). 
Respondents from China were even more likely to agree 
with this statement (84 percent) while respondents in Japan 
(70 percent), Germany (58 percent), and Brazil (52 percent) 
were less likely. With complete control aff orded by social media 
sites over profi le content, users may choose to share the most 
attractive or interesting photos and other content. Similarly, 
users also often have the power to not share information about 
personal and professional failures, unattractive photos, or other 
content that would portray them in an unfavorable light. 
 Self-presentation has changed since the emergence of social 
media. Jurgenson (2013) discussed how the virtual world has 
replaced people’s offl  ine identity with “the simulated second 
life that uproots and disembodies the authentic self in favor 
of digital status-posturing, empty interaction, and addictive 

 
Problems, Controversies, and Solutions 
95
connection.” Early social media sites and Web spaces allowed 
users anonymity, and users often took advantage of this option. 
For example, early MySpace users could create a display name 
of their choosing and opt to reveal their real name or not when 
interacting with other users or when others viewed their pro-
fi les. Nicknames were also popular among users of online bul-
letin boards and chat rooms as well as graphic avatars in place 
of a profi le photo. When Facebook started growing in popular-
ity, MySpace then began encouraging users to display their real 
names, as was the standard on Facebook from the beginning 
(Arrington 2008). Self-presentation became more of a concern 
with the emergence of social media sites like Facebook and 
Instagram that rely more on presentation through visual con-
tent, such as photos and videos. Th is type of content allows for 
opportunities to share much more about users’ personal lives 
and manipulate this content as well. At the same time users 
are revealing more about their lives through photos on social 
media, they are making sure those photos represent them in the 
most favorable light, which may be artifi cial and inauthentic. 
 Photo apps are available that airbrush or otherwise alter 
photos to make the subject appear younger, thinner, or more 
attractive. Some of these apps include Perfect365, FaceTune, 
ModiFace, Pixtr, and Visage Lab. Some social media platforms 
have built-in features for photo manipulation. Not surpris-
ingly, teens and young adults as well as women are the most 
active users of these apps. Seventy percent of FaceTune’s users, 
for example, are women, and two-thirds of Perfect365’s users 
are under age 24 (Bosker 2013). 
 Researchers who study social media presentation often draw 
upon impression management or self-presentation theories, 
which were infl uenced by sociologist Erving Goff man and his 
1959 book  Th e Presentation of Self in Everyday Life  (Goff man 
1959). Goff man viewed self-presentation as a performance 
and advocated impression management for its ability to foster 
friendship and avoid confl icts. Although his concepts origi-
nated long before the emergence of social media, Goff man’s 

96 
Social Media 
work remains applicable in modern times. Self-presentation 
has been the theoretical foundation of studies of personal web-
sites by several academicians, including Nicola Döring (2002), 
Schau and Gilly (2003), and Anna-Malin Karlsson (1998). 
Others have looked at social networking sites, such as online 
dating sites (Ellison, Heino, and Gibbs 2006). Ellison et al.’s 
(2006) study explained reasons for deceptive profi les on online 
dating sites as resulting from a “foggy mirror” issue, where users 
cannot view themselves as others see them, or from a tendency 
to describe their “ideal selves,” which could be a deliberate or 
unintentional process. 
 Self-affi  rmation is another theory that relates to social media 
presentation (Toma and Hancock 2013). Th is theory is based 
on the idea that people desire to view themselves as valuable, 
worthy, and good, and this drive will motivate their behav-
ior. People will then avoid any information that will negatively 
impact their self-worth while embracing information that con-
fi rms it. Building self-worth requires self-affi  rmation, which 
demands an awareness of values, relationships, and individual 
characteristics. One of the processes in self-affi  rmation is the 
need to seek confi rming information after an ego threat in 
order to repair self-worth, which will make people less defen-
sive and more resistant to subsequent threats. 
 Toma and Hancock (2013) argued that self-affi  rmation 
applies to Facebook because the platform provides an opportu-
nity to present key personal attributes within a network of per-
sonal relationships. Users will seek self-affi  rmation within this 
context and try to increase their perceptions of self-worth. As the 
researchers note, “this analysis suggests that Facebook profi les 
have the potential to confer upon users self-affi  rmational ben-
efi ts because they encapsulate a fl attering, socially connected, 
meaningful, and accurate self-portrait” (Toma and Hancock 
2013, 323). In two studies of Facebook users, Toma and 
Hancock found that Facebook profi les are self-affi  rming and can 
satisfy the needs of users for building self-worth and self-integrity 
and that Facebook users are likely to browse their own Facebook 

 
Problems, Controversies, and Solutions 
97
profi les after a blow to their egos to attempt to repair their own 
feelings of self-worth. Th is study is particularly important in 
demonstrating how benefi cial Facebook can be in helping peo-
ple deal with life’s setbacks and repair damage to their egos. 
 Th e reasons for participating in online self-presentation 
include a longing to make a favorable impression on others or 
project an identity that is consistent with one’s ideals (Herring 
and Kapidzic 2015). Many of the studies in this area have 
focused on teens and young adults. Herring and Kapidzic 
(2015) explored diff erences in how teen girls and boys manage 
their online presentations. Girls are more likely to limit profi le 
visibility through privacy settings while boys are more likely 
to share their profi les publicly. Th e researchers also compared 
textual presentations and found boys more likely to project 
assertiveness through their writing style and tone while girls 
demonstrated their desire to please boys and encourage social 
interaction. From the perspective of the visual presentation, 
girls posted more photos refl ecting a desire to be attractive and 
sexually appealing, while boys did not demonstrate a clear pat-
tern. Overall, the teens studied demonstrated the importance of 
displaying gendered identities on social media profi les, which 
is consistent with offl  ine patterns of development of their social 
identity (Herring and Kapidzic 2015). 
 Focus groups with teens conducted by the Pew Internet & 
American Life Project found teens to be proactive in manag-
ing the content and appearance of their social media profi les 
(Madden et al. 2013). Participants viewed “likes” as an indica-
tor of social status, and teens are strategic in their attempts 
to maximize “likes” and will remove content with few “likes.” 
Deleting content is the most popular strategy (59 percent have 
done so), and some of their other tactics for managing their 
profi les include deleting comments from others (53 percent), 
removing a tag from photos posted by others (45 percent), and 
deleting their entire profi le (31 percent). 
 Other studies have examined how young adult social media 
users present themselves in their posted photos. In a 2011 study 

98 
Social Media 
of 288 Facebook users, Kapidzic found that young adults who 
chose profi le photos where they had posed and dressed seduc-
tively were more likely to have internalized media messages 
about stereotypical looks (Kapidzic 2011). Not surprisingly, 
stronger results were found among females. 
 For some, the pressure to project and maintain a certain 
appearance can become an unhealthy obsession. Research 
studies have explored whether social media platforms change 
people in a way that they are more concerned about their self-
presentation. A study of Australian social media users found 
that “Facebook users have higher levels of total narcissism, 
exhibitionism, and leadership than Facebook nonusers . . . In 
fact, it could be argued that Facebook specifi cally gratifi es the 
narcissistic individual’s need to engage in self-promoting and 
superfi cial behavior” (Ryan and Xenos 2011). Ryan and Xenos 
contend that social media platforms are more attractive to 
those who are already narcissistic and attention-seeking, and 
although the sites cultivate this behavior, they do not create it. 
 Managing a social media profi le includes, for some peo-
ple, excessively monitoring the likes and nature of the com-
ments on posted photos. Th e more likes or positive comments, 
the more the user may feel worthy or validated. Ford’s 2014 
Trend Report noted that the public self that is shared on social 
media may require more validation than the offl  ine, authentic 
self (Ford 2013). Th e report noted that 62 percent of adults 
agreed that they feel more positive about themselves when 
people respond to their social media posts. Seventy-two per-
cent of adults over age 34 agreed that they post content on 
social media sites that they believe their followers will like, 
making them more self-conscious than the 40 percent of those 
aged 34 and younger who agreed with the statement. Th e report 
expanded on this idea: 
 We are living in a world of hyper self-expression, complete 
with “selfi es,” chronic public-journaling and other forms of 
digital self-expression. As authors, we have the opportunity 

 
Problems, Controversies, and Solutions 
99
to craft our own identity and tell the stories that are unique 
to us. What looks like—and perhaps started as—vanity 
showmanship is now a deep desire for validation. A Face-
book “like” or two makes us feel good. A dozen “likes” 
makes us feel great, creating a quiet but fi erce need to re-
visit the pieces of our narrative, to tweak, color and edit 
them to our liking—and to the liking of others. But as we 
smooth out the rough edges of our public self, do we gloss 
over our real character? (Ford 2013, 20) 
 Th e ability to eff ectively manage a social media profi le and 
maintain a positive self-presentation is a skill that benefi ts a 
range of people, from those seeking jobs or admission to col-
lege to those desiring a romantic relationship or a tight network 
of friends. Social media users, however, are cautioned to avoid 
obsessing over acquiring likes and comments from friends, 
altering photos to look as attractive as possible, and presenting 
one’s life in a false light on social media sites. Users, particularly 
teens and young adults, who spend too much time creating 
their online personas may miss opportunities to develop their 
offl  ine selves. 
 Social Media in the Workplace 
 Social media are an integral part of workplace life. Reasons for 
using social media for work purposes include the performance 
of job duties, particularly for employees in the marketing or 
communications fi elds; internal employee communication 
and team management; job hunting; monitoring employ-
ees; or recruiting and screening prospective employees. Social 
media can also create distractions for some employees on the 
job, which seriously impacts productivity (Vitak, Crouse, and 
LaRose 2009). Th is section focuses specifi cally on the use of 
social media for recruiting and screening prospective employ-
ees, the practice of employers requiring social media log-in 
information from current and prospective employees, the extent 

100 
Social Media 
to which the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) protects 
employees, and considerations when crafting a corporate social 
media policy. Finally, this section ends with a discussion of how 
prospective employees can use social media to enhance their 
job search. 
 Th e human resources function, in particular, is one area that 
has raised questions about the appropriate use of social media 
for recruiting and screening prospective hires. A 2016 study 
by the Society for Human Resource Management found that 
43 percent of respondents use social media or a Google search to 
screen job applicants and 36 percent have rejected an applicant 
based on information discovered (Society for Human Resource 
Management 2016). Some of the reasons for rejection included 
illegal activity or factual inconsistencies with applications. Th e 
study also found 84 percent of respondents said they recruit 
using social media, an increase from 56 percent of those who 
used social media in 2011, and another 9 percent are planning 
to use it. For most recruiters, LinkedIn is the primary social 
media recruiting tool, used by 96 percent, but Facebook and 
Twitter are also popular platforms. 
 A study of 228 hiring professionals had similar results and 
found that almost 80 percent of respondents used LinkedIn to 
screen candidates, followed by Facebook (35.9 percent) and 
Twitter (14.8 percent) (Sameen and Cornelius 2015). Most of 
the hiring managers surveyed (67.2 percent) used social media 
to target passive candidates instead of active ones. Th e point 
in the hiring process where social media was most likely to be 
reviewed was after receiving the application (39.8 percent), and 
43.8 percent said that fi nal hiring decisions were not based on 
information in the social media profi les. For those who did use 
social media profi les to make fi nal decisions (31.3 percent), 
some of the reasons included personality fi t with organization, 
additional support for professional qualifi cations, and com-
munication skills. Most (59.4 percent) would not reject candi-
dates based on information found on social media profi les, but 
if they did, reasons included lying about qualifi cations, poor 

 
Problems, Controversies, and Solutions 
101
communication skills, sharing confi dential information about 
the previous employer, and posting negative comments about 
the previous employer. 
 Another issue related to the usage of social media by recruit-
ers is the possibility of discrimination based on information 
provided or observable on a social media profi le, whether gen-
der, age, race, religion, sexual orientation, or physical disability. 
Th e availability of candidate information on social media chal-
lenges the enforcement of federal employment discrimination 
laws. Suggestions to combat this problem include using social 
media as one of many tools for recruiting and involving a third 
party to review social media profi les as a background check 
(U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission 2014). 
 A recent privacy invasion trend has been employers who 
demand the social media usernames and passwords from either 
prospective or current employees. Employers may defend this 
behavior by arguing they are monitoring whether employees 
are releasing proprietary information or setting them up for 
potential legal liabilities, but employees often see the practice 
as an invasion of privacy. According to the terms of agreement 
for many social media sites, users are expected to protect their 
passwords, therefore making it against the terms of agree-
ment if recruiters or employers require prospective and cur-
rent employees to turn over this information. By 2016, more 
than 25 states had passed laws that prohibit employers from 
collecting this information from both applicants and current 
employees and many other states are considering this legisla-
tion (National Conference of State Legislators 2016). At the 
same time, Congress is pursuing a federal law on this matter. 
For this reason, many recruiters and employers have access to 
only publicly available information. 
 For the most part, job applicants probably do not realize 
the extent to which they are being profi led. Some companies 
use scoring services to make data-driven decisions about pro-
motions or hiring (Pasquale 2015). Anything from joining the 
wrong Facebook group or using inappropriate language can give 

102 
Social Media 
an employee a black mark. Little regulation exists in this area, 
but states could pass legislation that would require employers 
to share the outside intelligence reports collected on current 
and prospective employees. As noted by Frank Pasquale in an 
op-ed piece for the  Los Angeles Times , “Without such notifi -
cation, we may be stigmatized by secret digital judgments” 
(2015). Employees and applicants should have an opportunity 
to know what data are being used to make decisions by employ-
ers as well as have a chance to correct any misinformation. 
 Many employees operate with the assumption that First 
Amendment protection of free speech applies to their social 
media posts. However, free speech protection is only provided 
to public sector employees posting on matters of public con-
cern. Instead, workers have some protection from the NLRA. 
Th e NLRA allows employees to collectively discuss work-related 
issues for the purposes of collective bargaining or mutual pro-
tection without interference from the employer, and these con-
versations may occur on social media sites (Patterson 2014). 
 Th e act created the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), 
a federal agency that receives tens of thousands of employee 
complaints annually, including an increasing number of social 
media–related cases (NLRB n.d.). In some of these complaints, 
employees are commenting on work-related issues or working 
conditions. In others, they are displaying behavior deemed inap-
propriate to the employer. It is important for both employees 
and employers to understand what kinds of posts are legally 
protected. Employers who fi re employees over social media posts 
could face wrongful termination lawsuits if the content posted 
on social media sites represents protected speech or protest. 
Some of the rulings on recent cases have determined that a “like” 
may not be protected concerted activity; that the employee may 
not be protected if the post is a malicious attack on the employ-
er’s products, services, or reputation; and that an individual 
employee is not protected if posting alone without engaging 
in conversation with at least one other employee (Schmidt and 
O’Connor 2015). 

 
Problems, Controversies, and Solutions 
103
 Recent decisions by the NLRB also indicate that the agency 
is closely scrutinizing employer social media policies and look-
ing for unlawful language. A 2012 study by the Society for 
Human Resource Management found that 40 percent of orga-
nizations have social media policies and the 33 percent of those 
with policies have used them to discipline an employee in the 
past year (Society for Human Resource Management 2012). 
Employers are advised to develop social media policies that 
provide guidelines for employees on what is acceptable and 
unacceptable on social media sites, but employers also need to 
understand the legal limits of what can be included. For exam-
ple, in 2014, the NLRB reviewed a situation at Triple Play 
Sports Bar and Grill where two employees were fi red for vio-
lating social media conduct policies by using profane language 
to criticize an owner on Facebook. One employee started the 
conversation with the following post: “Maybe someone should 
do the owners of Triple Play a favor and buy it from them. 
Th ey can’t even do the tax paperwork correctly!!! Now I OWE 
money . . . Wtf !!!” Th en another employee added, “I owe too. 
[Th e boss is] such an a**hole” (Schmidt and O’Connor 2015). 
Th e NLRB ruled that because the language was used in discus-
sions of problems by the employer in withholding the correct 
amount of state income tax from paychecks, it was protected 
as speech used to “seek and provide mutual support looking 
toward group action to encourage the employer to address 
problems in terms and conditions of employment, not to dis-
parage its product or services or undermine its reputation” 
(Patterson 2014). Th e board also found the company’s social 
media policy violated the NLRA because it “proscrib[ed] any 
discussions about their terms and conditions of employment 
[that the employer] deemed ‘inappropriate’ ” (Patterson 2014). 
 In another decision issued in 2014, the NLRB determined 
that the fi ring of fi ve employees from a nonprofi t organization 
who discussed a coworker who was planning to complain to 
management about their performance was in violation of the 
NLRA. Th e board found the posts to be concerted activity, 

104 
Social Media 
which is protected (NLRB n.d.). Another widely publicized 
employee fi ring as a result of a social media post created more 
bad news for troubled Chipotle, who was trying to bounce 
back after an  E. coli outbreak and sexual discrimination law-
suit. Two weeks after tweeting “@ChipotleTweets, nothing is 
free, only cheap #labor. Crew members make only $8.50hr 
how much is that steak bowl really?” Chipotle employee James 
Kennedy was fi red for the tweet and fi led a wrongful termina-
tion lawsuit. Th e NLRB found Chipotle’s social media policy, 
which prohibited posting “disparaging, false” statements on 
social media sites, to be in violation of labor laws (Th e Associ-
ated Press 2016). 
 Schmidt and O’Connor (2015) reviewed NLRB cases that 
resulted from social media terminations and provided recom-
mendations to those crafting corporate social media policies. 
Th ey suggested that employers provide employees with the free-
dom to share legitimate concerns about their workplace, but 
not embarrass the company or the customers. Policies should be 
as specifi c as possible in listing examples of prohibited behavior, 
but still allow employees to air grievances and not place limits 
on the use of profanity, sharing of gossip, or rude posts. It is 
also suggested that employers review other NLRB cases to learn 
from the mistakes of other organizations and stay abreast of case 
law in the area of social media. 
 A  National Law Review article suggested that employers 
include in their social media policies the activities protected by 
NLRA and a statement that the policy will not interfere with 
those rights (Patterson 2014). Th en, employers can include 
unprotected social media posts and activities that may result in 
disciplinary action, such as disclosure of proprietary company 
information, threats of violence, statements that are obscene or 
used to bully, rumors or other false statements about the com-
pany or employees, and posts that are racist, sexist, or discrimi-
natory intended to create a hostile work environment. 
 A report issued by the NLRB in 2012 off ered two major 
points for employers and employees to keep in mind as they 

 
Problems, Controversies, and Solutions 
105
relate to employer social media policies and employee postings 
on social media sites. First, “[e]mployer policies should not be 
so sweeping that they prohibit the kinds of activity protected 
by federal labor law, such as the discussion of wages or work-
ing conditions among employees.” Second, “[a]n employee’s 
comments on social media are generally not protected if they 
are mere gripes not made in relation to group activity among 
employees” (NLRB n.d.). 
 Although certain content on social media sites might disqual-
ify applicants from jobs, social media can be used strategically 
by job seekers to improve their chances of being hired. Many 
prospects are located through LinkedIn, and therefore, job 
seekers should not only have a LinkedIn profi le, but also add as 
many professional details as possible, build a strong network of 
connections, and join LinkedIn groups such as alumni organi-
zations or industry associations. Job seekers may also consider 
building a personal website to showcase their work, which is 
particularly recommended in creative fi elds. Job seekers should 
also remove unfavorable social media content from their own 
social media profi les, including negative comments about cur-
rent or prospective employers, or ask it to be removed from 
other profi les. Finally, even though employers are bound by 
anti-discrimination laws, applicants may also consider remov-
ing personal information from their social media profi les. 
 Relationships and Communication Skills 
 In today’s digital society, people are both more connected and 
more disconnected than ever before. Social media provide 
users a link to a vast and potentially geographically dispersed 
network of friends and acquaintances with whom they can 
interact at any time. Th rough social media, friendships made 
throughout a lifetime can be maintained, and new friendships 
can be formed. Another benefi t is that it is possible to manage 
many relationships through social media sites. Despite these 
advantages, social media interactions have been criticized for 

106 
Social Media 
being superfi cial, lacking the necessary depth to form even 
closer bonds. Digital conversations may also be less fulfi lling 
than other forms of communication. Consider, for example, 
the diff erence between receiving birthday wishes from many 
friends on Facebook versus a phone call from a friend. Th e 
Facebook greetings require little commitment in terms of time, 
while a phone call is more meaningful and personal. Social 
media interactions may also have a detrimental impact on the 
ability of people, especially youth, to communicate offl  ine. 
 Because social media facilitate connections with other peo-
ple and enhance the opportunity to meet new people, the tech-
nology may also threaten relationships with signifi cant others. 
Anecdotal evidence has provided many examples of people 
who left a spouse to rekindle a relationship with a past love 
interest or start a relationship with a new social media con-
nection. Even if a user is not engaging with social media to 
cheat on his or her partner or attempt to fi nd a new partner, 
research has demonstrated that excessive use of the Internet can 
have detrimental eff ects on a relationship. A 2011 study found 
that when one partner spent signifi cant amounts of time on 
the Internet, the relationship suff ered from confl ict (Kerkhof, 
Finkenauer, and Muusses 2011). Reasons suggested included 
that the non-Internet-using partner felt ignored or neglected 
and that the partner using the Internet was suspected of con-
cealing or not sharing information about his or her life. A later 
study on Facebook usage and relationships also found that 
digital communication led to relationship confl ict (Clayton, 
Nagurney, and Smith 2013). Th e researchers found a correla-
tion between Facebook usage and confl ict related to Facebook, 
and, in turn, a correlation between this confl ict and negative 
relationship outcomes for the couple, such as cheating or the 
dissolution of the relationship (Clayton, Nagurney, and Smith 
2013). For those in shorter relationships (36 months or less), 
Facebook use was more likely to lead to confl ict, but this con-
nection was not present for couples in relationships for more 
than three years.

 Some of the research on the use of social media by youth 
to manage relationships has explored how social media usage 
leads to anxiety or isolation from family and friends (Turkle 
2011), while other research has focused on how teens develop 
important relationships through social media (Ito et al. 2010). 
A study by Common Sense Media showed how social media 
can provide a tool for young people to communicate with 
friends, develop an identity, learn social skills, and extend 
friendships (Rideout 2012). When it comes to relationships 
with friends, this study of 13- to 17-year-olds found that more 
than half (52 percent) of teens said social media usage has 
enhanced relationships with friends versus just 4 percent who 
said usage has negatively aff ected those relationships. Some of 
the benefi ts included keeping in touch with friends they cannot 
see regularly (88 percent), getting to know students at school 
better (69 percent), and connecting with others who share a 
common interest (57 percent). Th e teens surveyed, however, 
preferred face-to-face communication as their favorite way to 
communicate with friends (49 percent) followed by texting 
(33 percent), with social media communication at just 7 per-
cent. Th e two top reasons for preferring face-to-face commu-
nication included that it is more fun (38 percent) and easier to 
understand what people mean (29 percent). 
 Studies of self-reported communication preferences do not 
acknowledge how technology may rewire the user’s brain path-
ways and impact the ability of users to develop strong inter-
personal relationships. Th is process works through chemicals 
called neurotransmitters in the brain that function to transfer 
information between nerves. As a child develops, pathways are 
expanded based on stimulation and are used to help organize 
information as it is acquired. Digital use, however, changes the 
neural pathways and can impact some traits and abilities such 
as concentration, self-esteem, building personal relationships, 
and empathy (Johnson 2014). 
 Relationships can also be explored from the perspective 
of social capital, which are the resources that one acquires 

108 
Social Media 
through relationships with people in a network (Coleman 
1988). Th e concept of social capital is particularly relevant 
in a social media setting. Social capital could take the form 
of information or relationships that can be helpful to others 
in the network. For example, a user might be able to off er his 
connections knowledge about companies that are hiring or 
specialists who might be able to cure a disease. Social capital 
is often described as either bridging or bonding, with bridging 
resulting from “weak ties” or loose connections that can off er 
information but not emotional support and bonding resulting 
from people in close relationships, such as family members or 
dear friends (Ellison, Steinfi eld, and Lampe 2007). A study 
by Ellison, Steinfi eld, and Lampe (2007) of college students 
found certain kinds of Facebook use to be more useful in cre-
ating or maintaining bridging social capital. Students who 
did not use Facebook as intensely and had low satisfaction 
with college life and low self-esteem experienced much lower 
bridging capital than more intense users. Th e researchers sug-
gested that Facebook use could help those unhappy students 
adjust to college life by off ering information and opportu-
nities. Facebook use was found to be less critical for main-
taining or creating bonding social capital than bridging, but 
still important, particularly for maintaining preexisting close 
relationships. 
 Another study of youth and communication tools examined 
pairs of close female friends (Sherman, Michikyan, and Green-
fi eld 2013). Th e research team found that the most bonding 
occurred when the pairs interacted in person, followed by video 
chat, audio chat, and then instant messaging. Additionally, 
the use of technology impacted bonding for the participants. 
For example, those who used video chat and audio chat fre-
quently reported more bonding than those who did not. Fur-
thermore, even though less bonding occurred during instant 
messaging than other communication methods, affi  liation cues 
such as emoticons, typed laughter, and excessive capitalization 
improved bonding.

 In addition to directly impacting relationships, social media 
have been criticized for sabotaging the development of solid 
communication skills needed to build and maintain relation-
ships. Parents and other adults worry that children are not 
acquiring the skills to manage face-to-face conversations. Single 
people sometimes resort to texting and social media as an 
important tool for managing their dating relationships, even 
relying on digital media as a method for communicating the 
end of a relationship to avoid an uncomfortable face-to-face 
situation. Some people also fi nd themselves distracted by social 
media in settings where they have the opportunity to engage 
with people face-to-face. 
 In an interview with WBUR, scholar Sherry Turkle stated 
that she believes digital communication is “dumbing down” 
communication skills and that some young people are even 
intimidated by the prospect of talking to people IRL (in real 
life). Turkle continued by adding that digital communication 
“is not so good for the sort of nuanced understanding and 
relationship-building you get when you are present with your 
friends—for sharing intimacies, for sharing diffi  cult news, for 
saying you are sorry, for really getting to know someone. It gives 
us that sense of connection without the demands of intimacy 
and the responsibilities of intimacy” (Adler 2013). In the same 
interview, Microsoft researcher Nancy Baym advocated a con-
trasting opinion, saying that “the evidence consistently shows 
that the more you communicate with people using devices, the 
more likely you are to communicate with those people face to 
face” (Adler 2013). 
 For young people as well as others, screen time may impact 
the ability to recognize nonverbal cues, an important element 
of face-to-face communication that is absent in digital commu-
nication. A team of researchers performed a fi eld experiment 
where a group of preteens spent fi ve days at an overnight nature 
camp without any screens, including television, computers, 
and mobile devices. Compared to the control group who had 
access to screens, the preteens who did not engage with screens 

110 
Social Media 
had better recognition of nonverbal emotional cues in facial 
expressions presented in photos and videotaped scenes. Th e 
researchers concluded that “the short-term eff ects of increased 
opportunities for social interaction, combined with time away 
from screen-based media and digital communication tools, 
improves a preteen’s understanding of nonverbal emotional 
cues” (Uhls et al. 2014, 387). 
 A 2009 study on digital communication found that teens 
who spend more time communicating using online social sites, 
instant messages, and texts have more anxiety symptoms than 
when communicating face-to-face (Pierce 2009). Th is phe-
nomenon is even more pronounced in girls. Th e question then 
arises as to whether people who are more socially anxious turn 
to technology for communication or whether it is the use of 
technology that drives them to be more anxious. In the end, 
the question is irrelevant because, either way, the teen is not 
having as much of an opportunity to build in-person social 
skills. 
 Social media may improve communication skills for those 
who lack the confi dence to communicate in face-to-face situa-
tions. For those who are quiet or introverted, social media can 
level the playing fi eld by giving them an opportunity for their 
voice to be heard or allowing them to show another side of them-
selves. Th e quiet person in a face-to-face situation might off er 
humorous comments, creative content, or thoughtful insights 
online. Some people or even certain situations may require more 
time to craft responses, and social media allow them opportu-
nities to do so. Social media also provide an outlet for creative 
written and visual communication through the use of blogs, 
images, or videos. 
 Building and maintaining strong offl  ine relationships and 
communication skills can be improved through practice and by 
not relying solely on social media as a crutch to avoid face-to-
face communication. Social media users should recognize how 
social media communication can be used as a tool to foster per-
sonal relationships and as a bridge for offl  ine communication, 

 
Problems, Controversies, and Solutions 
111
but not allow it to become a substitute for all face-to-face com-
munications. For example, social media can be used to facili-
tate organization of an outing with friends, learn that a friend 
lives in a city where the user is planning to travel, or rekindle 
a relationship with a high school friend. Parents can help their 
children learn to build personal relationships by regulating the 
usage of their children’s digital devices and setting up rules and 
boundaries. Furthermore, parents should also exhibit behaviors 
their children can model by creating boundaries for their own 
usage. For example, family dinners and other family events 
may be deemed device-free times. Children and teens should 
also be encouraged to talk in person to teachers, coaches, and 
other adults and not rely on digital communication. 
 Online Shaming and Attacks 
 With today’s technology, people’s public and even private 
behavior and statements as well as anything posted on social 
media can easily be captured, shared, downloaded, or for-
warded to a network of followers, making it easy to launch 
and propagate online attacks. Unleashing an attack on some-
one for their morally reprehensible behavior is as easy as send-
ing a tweet or sharing a photo. Depending on the site, attacks 
can even be made anonymously. In the wake of a controversial 
event, social media users tend to jump on the attack band-
wagon and raise the profi le of the event to something that may 
receive national and even international attention. In addition 
to public shaming, attackers sometimes call for the person to be 
destroyed, which often takes the form of a job fi ring. Another 
form of attack is committed by online trolls, who were active 
even before social media on websites and bulletin boards and 
often attack on a whim. With social media, however, people 
are now more exposed to trolls than ever before. Unlike the 
mobs who participate in public shaming, trolls often focus on 
a variety of targets and are not likely to pile on to a public 
situation. 

112 
Social Media 
 Public relations professional Justine Sacco made several 
tweets while traveling from New York to Cape Town, South 
Africa, during late 2013, commenting on a passenger’s body 
odor, the dental problems of Londoners, and fi nally, prior to 
the fi nal leg of her trip, the AIDS epidemic in Africa when she 
said, “Going to Africa. Hope I don’t get AIDS. Just kidding. 
I’m white!” (Ronson 2015). Sacco’s 170 followers did not have 
an immediate reaction to the tweet before she boarded her 
eleven-hour fl ight. During her fl ight while she was offl  ine, her 
tweet created a Twitterstorm of backlash and tens of thousands 
of tweets. One said, “How did @JustineSacco get a PR job?! 
Her level of racist ignorance belongs on Fox News. #AIDS can 
aff ect anyone!” Th e situation was so critical that her employer, 
IAC, felt compelled to engage in the conversation adding, “Th is 
is an outrageous, off ensive comment. Employee in question 
currently unreachable on an intl fl ight.” Another Twitter user 
responded with, “We are about to watch this @JustineSacco 
bitch get fi red. In REAL time. Before she even KNOWS she’s 
getting fi red.” Because Sacco was off  the grid while the situation 
exploded, Twitter users created the hashtag #HasJustineLand-
edYet, accelerating the drama of the situation and making Sacco 
the top trending topic worldwide on Twitter. Because of the 
tweet, Sacco did lose her job, moved to Africa to work in public 
relations for a nongovernmental organization, and then moved 
back to New York for another public relations position at an 
undisclosed company (Ronson 2015). 
 Another target of online vilifi cation was Walter Palmer, the 
Minnesota dentist who shot the beloved Cecil the Lion, a major 
tourist attraction in Hwange National Park, while on a hunt-
ing trip in Zimbabwe. Th e killing was gruesome, with Palmer 
shooting Cecil with a bow and arrow, then allowing the lion 
to suff er for 40 hours before Palmer fi nally killed him (Bever 
2015). Th e fallout for Palmer was signifi cant. Th e resulting 
online shaming and threats as well as offl  ine protests caused 
him to shut down his dental practice. Th e garage of Palmer’s 
vacation home in Florida was spray painted with the words 

 
Problems, Controversies, and Solutions 
113
“Lion Killer.” Additionally, Palmer’s Yelp page was bombarded 
with negative reviews and boycott requests. Even celebrities, 
such as Ricky Gervais, Ian Somerhalder, Jerry O’Connell, 
Sharon Osbourne, and Shannon Doherty, jumped into the fray 
to criticize the dentist (Hilton 2015). Th e courts in Zimbabwe 
determined that Palmer had obtained legal authority to hunt, 
and he was not charged with any crime (BBC News 2015). Th e 
hunt guide he worked with, however, was arrested. After two 
months, Palmer was able to reopen his dental clinic. 
 Another online victim was Lindsey Stone, who in 2012 
posted a photo on Facebook of herself “giving the fi nger” to 
and appearing to scream near a sign at Arlington National 
Cemetery that requested visitors off er “Silence and Respect.” 
After the photo went viral, Stone received thousands of nega-
tive online comments and threats and was fi red from her job 
(Regan 2015). In another example, the chief fi nancial offi  cer 
of a medical device manufacturer, Adam Mark Smith, posted 
a video of himself berating a Chick-fi l-A employee about the 
company’s antigay marriage stance. After the video went viral, 
he lost his $200,000-a-year job as well as his home. After fi nd-
ing a new job, Smith was promptly fi red when the new boss 
realized that he was the man from the infamous video (Towner 
and Nye 2015). Alicia Ann Lynch also suff ered the vitriol from 
social media users who objected to her Halloween costume 
of a Boston Marathon bombing victim just months after the 
attacks (Giacobbe 2014). Th e backlash included publicizing 
racy photos Lynch had previously uploaded to Tumblr, calling 
her parents and saying they would “slit her throat,” contacting 
her boss, posting negative online reviews for the company they 
thought employed her father, threatening her best friend, and 
posting comments about how Lynch deserved to be raped and 
how they hoped her mom would get cancer (Giacobbe 2014). 
Although Lynch apologized, the threats continued and she was 
fi red from her job. 
 Why does this phenomenon occur? Why are people so quick 
to pile on to these situations? Social media make it easy to share 

114 
Social Media 
opinions, and these online condemnations might make inse-
cure people feel better about themselves. Th ose who participate 
in online shaming may experience schadenfreude, which refers 
to the pleasure that comes from knowledge of the misfortune 
of others. Also, attacks do not need to be delivered face-to-face, 
so the sender can somewhat hide behind an online profi le. By 
joining in the attack, people have an opportunity to be part of 
popular conversation and serve as moral police. Jon Ronson, 
who wrote the book  So You’ve Been Publicly Shamed , described 
in the  New York Times how public shaming grew along with the 
technology: 
 Still, in those early days, the collective fury felt righteous, 
powerful and eff ective. It felt as if hierarchies were being 
dismantled, as if justice were being democratized. As time 
passed, though, I watched these shame campaigns multi-
ply, to the point that they targeted not just powerful insti-
tutions and public fi gures but really anyone perceived to 
have done something off ensive. I also began to marvel at 
the disconnect between the severity of the crime and the 
gleeful savagery of the punishment. It almost felt as if 
shamings were now happening for their own sake, as if 
they were following a script. (Ronson 2015) 
 Ronson views public shaming as a form of power, which gives 
a voice to voiceless people and provides a way to create drama. 
Th e sad consequence of the drama is that it often ruins a life 
or career. 
 For those who fear online shaming, one solution is to be 
more careful about what is shared in social media posts. Con-
tent can be misunderstood or taken out of context. Social 
media users also need to realize that people have diff erent value 
systems and moral codes. An activity, such as hunting lions, 
may be acceptable to some people, but egregious to others. 
At the same time, social media users cannot completely con-
trol their online personas because others may capture offl  ine 

 
Problems, Controversies, and Solutions 
115
behavior or comments and share that content on social media 
sites. Again, an awareness that anything said or done might 
be posted online may cause people to police their own offl  ine 
behavior. Th ose who attack, criticize, or attempt to embar-
rass others through social media should consider whether the 
punishment called for fi ts the crime and also recognize that 
people, especially young people, will make mistakes they will 
later regret. 
 Trolls perform another type of online attack, often targeting 
people at random. Unlike online shaming, the target has usually 
not done anything egregious or controversial. Journalist Lindy 
West, herself a victim of a troll, defi ned trolling as “recreational 
abuse—usually anonymous—intended to waste the subject’s 
time or get a rise out of them or frustrate or frighten them 
into silence” (West 2015). Sadly, trolls often prey on those who 
have lost family members, even children, and will write revolt-
ing comments on social media sites and online news stories. 
Th ose in the public eye, such as journalists and celebrities, are 
often targeted by numerous trolls. 
 In West’s situation, a troll had set up a Twitter profi le using 
the name PawWestDonezo, which was loosely based on West’s 
deceased father’s name, Paul West. Th e bio read: “Embarrassed 
father of an idiot. Other two kids are fi ne, though.” His listed 
location was “Dirt hole in Seattle,” and a photo of her father 
was used as the profi le picture. West responded by writing 
about online trolls, which inspired the troll to e-mail West to 
apologize. His explanation for trolling West: “I think my anger 
towards you stems from your happiness with your own being. 
It off ended me because it served to highlight my unhappiness 
with my own self ” (West 2015). 
 Because trolls are trying to get a reaction from their tar-
gets, the best way to deal with them is to ignore their com-
ments. Replying, even with a comment such as “please stop” 
or “go away, troll,” will only feed the beast (Gordon 2014). 
Some users may get lured into the conversation with the troll, 
and in that case, it is best to try to defl ate them with kindness 

116 
Social Media 
(Gordon 2014). Finally, recognizing that trolls are people who 
are probably bored or have low self-esteem may help a user 
discredit the attacks. 
 Social Media Privacy Concerns 
 Th e classic 1993  New Yorker cartoon that reads “Nobody on 
the Internet knows you are a dog” perfectly describes the sen-
timent in the beginning days of the Internet and early social 
media sites. Since then, consumer concerns about online pri-
vacy and security have increased as both technology and users 
have become more sophisticated (Pasierbinska-Wilson 2015). 
 When many users fi rst went online in the early to mid-
1990s, they were using dial-up services and paying by the hour 
for online access, two factors that limited opportunities for 
others to collect personal information. Furthermore, users at 
the time were often accessing the Internet through controlled 
portals such as AOL and the Microsoft Network. Addition-
ally, the technology to steal personal information was not 
as available nor as advanced as it is today. Th erefore, at the 
time, most consumers, businesses, and Internet service pro-
viders were not greatly concerned about privacy (Pasierbinska-
Wilson 2015). Th at being said, movement toward privacy 
activism was taking place in organizations, such as the Elec-
tronic Privacy Information Center, which formed in 1994 to 
serve as a nonprofi t research center to “protect privacy, free-
dom of expression, democratic values, and to promote the 
Public Voice in decisions concerning the future of the Inter-
net” (Electronic Privacy Information Center n.d.). At the 
time, the American Civil Liberties Union also started to raise 
awareness of online privacy issues and the behavior of govern-
ments and corporations. 
 Th e privacy of children became an issue in the mid- to late 
1990s as people began to worry about child pornography and 
marketers taking advantage of children under the age of con-
sent (Pasierbinska-Wilson 2015). In 1998, Congress passed the 

 
Problems, Controversies, and Solutions 
117
Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act to require commer-
cial websites to gain parental consent before collecting, using, 
and/or disclosing information from children under the age of 
13 and to also outline the contents of a privacy policy, includ-
ing the responsibility of a website operators to protect the pri-
vacy and safety of children on their sites. 
 Th e 2000s saw the rise in popularity of online social networks 
such as MySpace and Facebook, where users willingly shared 
personal information including their name, personal photos, 
birthdate, geographic location, and favorites (Pasierbinska-
Wilson 2015). Legislation at the time, including the Califor-
nia Online Privacy Protection Act of 2003, focused on privacy 
policies. Th e act outlined that website operators who collect 
personal data must post a privacy policy in an obvious spot on 
the site that explains the nature of the data collected, how the 
data are shared with other parties, and how users can access 
their stored data, if the process exists. At the time, privacy con-
cerns were somewhat addressed through awareness of policies. 
 By the 2010s, however, users wanted to not only know about 
how their data would be used, but also have more control over 
that data. High-profi le stories related to online privacy and 
security covered by the news media highlighted the sophisti-
cation of individuals, governments, and corporations, height-
ening consumer concern (Pasierbinska-Wilson 2015). Th e 
National Security Agency surveillance reports, for example, 
revealed the once-secret bulk e-mail collection and wiretapping 
authorized by President George W. Bush and drew attention to 
all the online and offl  ine data that are legally attainable. Simi-
larly, Julian Assange’s launch of WikiLeaks, a site that reveals 
secret information and news leaks, generated more concern 
from average citizens about online privacy. 
 In 2012, Havas Worldwide conducted a study of more than 
7,000 adults in 19 countries on privacy concerns. Th e survey 
found that 55 percent of worldwide respondents aged 35–54 
were worried that “technology is robbing us of our privacy,” with 
the percentage higher than 60 percent among U.S. respondents 

118 
Social Media 
(Havas Worldwide 2012). Agreement was also high with that 
same age group (62 percent) for the statement “People share too 
much about their personal thoughts and experiences online; 
we need to go back to being more private.” Despite concerns 
about privacy, a 2015 study by International Data Corporation 
and Kaspersky Lab of 18,000 consumers found several behav-
iors that leave social media users open to hackers and stalkers. 
In terms of friending, 12 percent responded they would add 
anyone to their network who made a friend request even if the 
person was a stranger, and 31 percent would add a “friend of 
a friend” (Kaspersky Lab 2015). 
 Online privacy and security is often a power struggle 
between website operators who fi nd signifi cant value in user 
data and users who want to protect their personal information. 
Th e business models of many websites and social media sites 
often involve providing collected data to advertisers and other 
third parties. Consumer scorn is often directed at advertisers 
and marketers who gather data that can be used to deliver rel-
evant ads to users. Social networking sites such as Facebook 
and LinkedIn that provide a free platform to users generate 
revenue through advertising sales. Advertisers fi nd value not 
only in getting ads in front of targeted prospective customers, 
but also in the data provided to them by the sites. In addition 
to for-profi t businesses, the government and political parties 
are also interested in acquiring the data. 
 Users should be concerned with how social media compa-
nies are using and selling their personal information as well as 
how much information about them is known to third parties. 
Many Facebook users have noticed how a Google search results 
in subsequent targeted advertising on Facebook. For example, 
a consumer who is shopping on Zappos.com for a pair of boots 
may then notice Zappos ads for boots the next time they are on 
Facebook. A 2013 Pew Internet & American Life Project study 
found that most social media users are not interested in receiv-
ing targeted advertising based on surfi ng behavior or personal 
information (Davis 2016). Most social media sites provide 

 
Problems, Controversies, and Solutions 
119
users an option to turn off  targeted ads in the settings or block 
ads from a specifi c source. For example, Facebook allows users 
to click directly on posts in the News Feed to decline or hide 
ads from a particular advertiser in the future. User information 
is collected not only through surfi ng the Web but also through 
apps that can be allowed access to phone content such as pho-
tos or contacts. In 2012, Twitter was exposed for copying con-
tacts of iPhone Twitter app users to its own servers (Waugh and 
Cohen 2012). 
 A Pew Research Center study of 802 teens found that a 
higher percentage were sharing more information about them-
selves on social media in 2012 than they did in 2006 (Madden 
et al. 2013). Sharing a birth date (82 percent did so), school 
name (71 percent), city where they live (71 percent), or cell 
phone (20 percent) may also compromise the privacy or safety 
of the user. Additionally, sharing photos can be problematic 
for users. Photos taken on a cell phone have metadata attached 
to them, which can reveal the location of the user when the 
photo was taken. In 2012, a Burger King employee posted on 
the site 4chan a photo of lettuce on the fl oor of the restaurant 
with the caption: “Th is is the lettuce you eat at Burger King.” 
Despite posting anonymously, the photo’s metadata revealed 
the exact location of the restaurant, which eventually led to 
the fi ring of that employee and two others. Users should also 
be particularly concerned about broadcasting their locations 
through check-ins and posting photos from trips, which is a 
signal to others that their homes are unoccupied. To protect 
location data, users who take photos on phones and post to 
social media should turn off  location services for social media 
sites and adjust the settings so that photos do not store meta-
data. Another strategy is for users not to post travel photos 
until they return home from a trip. 
 Another privacy concern is the extent of posted content that 
is available to “non-friends.” Th ese “non-friends” may access 
information through public social media profi les or might be 
accepted as friends by users they do not actually know. Th e best 

120 
Social Media 
strategy for users to protect their information is to understand 
the privacy settings of social media sites. For most platforms, 
the default is a public account so the user must be savvy to 
know how to control access to their information. Users should 
also not accept friend requests from people not known to them 
personally, especially on sites like Facebook where a great deal 
of personal information is shared. 
 Social media sites also make it possible for privacy to be vio-
lated by another user posting personal information or photos 
about a friend, acquaintance, or even a stranger. In the Havas 
Worldwide study, almost half of the total sample (47 percent) 
and a majority of those aged 18–34 worry that inappropriate 
personal information about them will be shared online (Havas 
Worldwide 2012). On Facebook, users can require approval 
before being tagged in a photo, but that does not prevent users 
from uploading an embarrassing photo. 
 More concerning is the facial recognition technology used by 
Facebook to provide a suggested tag for uploaded photos. To 
do this, Facebook compares the faces in an uploaded photo to 
friends of the user, making a suggestion to tag specifi c users. 
Th e Privacy Commissioner of Canada had this to say about 
the future of facial recognition technology: “Th e availability 
of cheap facial recognition for the masses may have the eff ect 
of normalizing surveillance over time. We are not yet at the 
point where we can take pictures of people on the street with 
our smartphones, identify them, and gain access to informa-
tion about them. However, this reality may not be too far off ” 
(Roberts 2015). Although Facebook users are encouraged to 
opt out of auto-tagging, merely having photos on Facebook 
connected to a user’s name provides data that can be used for 
other purposes. 
 Another privacy question of users is who owns the rights to 
the content posted on social media sites, including text, pho-
tos, and videos. Instagram users created such an uproar after 
Instagram announced that the site owned all content uploaded 
by users that the company had to retract the policy (McCullagh 

 
Problems, Controversies, and Solutions 
121
2012). Facebook states that the company provides “a non-
exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, worldwide 
license to use any IP content that you post on or in connection 
with Facebook” (Facebook 2015). Th erefore, while users own 
their content, Facebook can freely use it without compensation. 
 Conclusion 
 Th is chapter presented a range of issues related to social media 
use including addiction and the impact on relationships and 
communication skills. Other negative outcomes such as online 
shaming, scams and hoaxes, fake news, cyberbullying, and 
feelings of loneliness, depression, and envy were also covered. 
Finally, the chapter addressed the impact of content curation 
on social media feeds, the desire to project an ideal image, social 
media in the workplace, and privacy issues. Despite these prob-
lems, social media can have positive benefi ts if users approach 
social media with a meaningful, conscious, and informed 
mindset. 
 One of the questions often pondered about social media is 
how social media are changing users, but perhaps a better ques-
tion is how social media users are changing the world. Recent 
examples of the large-scale impact of the power of social media 
include fund-raising campaigns, natural disaster response, and 
political revolutions (Roesler 2014). Without social media, 
more than $220 million worldwide would not have been 
raised for the ALS Association as a result of the viral Ice Bucket 
campaign (Holan 2014). Without social media, victims of 
the earthquake and tsunami in Japan 2011 would have fewer 
methods to seek information about loved ones and get updates 
about the situation, which was particularly dangerous because 
of damage to a nuclear reactor (Roesler 2014). Without social 
media, protesters in the political uprisings of the Arab Spring 
in 2011 would have fewer means to organize protesters, com-
municate with activist leaders, discuss government injustices, 
and demonstrate to the world the depravity of the situation 

122 
Social Media 
(Pontin 2011). Despite the many problems of social media 
platforms, they can off er unparalleled, large-scale, and mean-
ingful benefi ts.

Perspectives
 Introduction 
 Th e essays in this chapter authored by communication scholars and 
professionals provide a range of perspectives on social media. Th e 
issues covered explore societal topics including the impact of social 
media on young women’s perceptions of their bodies and how social 
media both helps and hurts victims of sexual assault. Corporate 
concerns are also covered in essays about online corporate activism 
on issues such as lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) 
rights, the practice of social media data collection, and how social 
media both create crises for organizations and can be used for the 
purpose of organizational crisis communication. Finally, the es-
says also cover the role of social media in political campaigns, how 
social media suppress the minority opinion, and the practice of 
live tweeting during popular television shows. Th e authors provide 
insights that encourage readers to think about the issues and often 
propose solutions to the problems presented.

Social Media 
communication. Indeed, of U.S. online users, 18- to 29-year-
olds are on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Pinterest in the 
largest proportion among all age groups, according to the Pew 
Research Center, and have adopted these platforms faster than 
others (Perrin 2015). Teenagers, on the other hand, are on-
line daily, and some “almost constantly,” primarily via mobile 
devices, says another Pew report (Lenhart 2015). Th is con-
stant connectedness via social media has been both lauded and 
scorned by parents, academics, and experts, but despite the vast 
diff erences in opinion, one thing is certain: social media do af-
fect the attitudes, behaviors, and relationships of many young 
people. One type of impact is on body image. 
 Body image encompasses the thoughts, feelings, and be-
haviors about one’s physical shape, size, and appearance. It 
goes beyond how people feel about themselves and often af-
fects how they behave toward their bodies. For example, poor 
body image is a stronger trigger of disordered eating than ac-
tual weight among college women (Cooley and Toray 2001) 
and is a risk factor for low self-esteem, depressive symptoms, 
eating disorders, and obesity (Grabe, Ward, and Hyde 2008). 
Body image can aff ect many aspects of a young person’s life and 
therefore is important to be studied further, especially in rela-
tion to social media. 
 Th e link between social media and body image is still being 
explored but some trends are starting to occur. More time 
spent on Facebook has been linked to increased drive for thin-
ness, internalization of the thin ideal, dissatisfaction with one’s 
weight, and signs of disordered eating (Mabe, Forney, and Keel 
2014; Tiggemann and Slater 2013). Some specifi c behaviors, 
such as photo-related activities, have been singled out for their 
negative consequences, although the relationship cannot point 
to defi nite cause and eff ect (Meier and Gray 2014). 
 Furthermore, users with particular physical or psychological 
attributes have diff erent experiences. Our research has found 
that college women wanting to lose weight pay more atten-
tion to the physical appearance of others on Facebook and 

 
Perspectives 
141
experience more negative body attitudes than women who 
do not want to lose weight (Eckler, Kalyango, and Paasch 
2014). Women who tend to make more appearance com-
parisons, on the other hand, experience greater appearance 
discrepancies after spending time on Facebook (Fardouly and 
Vartanian 2015). 
 Th us, we know that spending more time on social media 
could be harmful to some. However, the reasons for this are yet 
unknown. A recent study the authors conducted on U.S. col-
lege women looked into the body-related content they posted 
on Facebook as a way to better understand the above relation-
ship. Of the 882 participants, 111 (12.6 percent) said they had 
posted on their News Feeds about weight, body image, dieting, 
or weight loss in the past month. Th ey made four such updates 
on average, ranging from 1 to 30, which shows a great diff er-
ence in willingness to discuss such topics. 
 Women disclosed the contents of their last post and of a 
typical post, and their answers (total of 188) were analyzed 
qualitatively and several dominant themes emerged. For last 
and typical posts, exercise was the most dominant theme and 
covered primarily the practice of exercising (“how much I have 
exercised” or “working out at the gym”). Two other themes 
were equally present: weight loss and food/diet. Th e majority 
of comments about weight loss concerned outcomes or success, 
such as “how much weight I lost,” “updates on weight loss,” 
“could fi t into a smaller size pants,” or simply “losing weight.” 
Other comments, although not as common, concerned the 
desire for weight loss, such as “needing to lose weight” and 
“thinking about losing weight.” Common subthemes in the 
food/diet theme were healthy food alternatives (“trying a new 
healthy meal recipe”) or starting a diet. 
 Body image was the fi nal theme to emerge. Some women 
talked about negative perceptions of their bodies and how 
they wanted to look diff erently: “feeling huge,” “I wish I was 
confi dent in my body,” “how I wish I was taller,” “I feel too 
skinny,” “being too tall,” and “I wish I was thinner or prettier.” 

142 
Social Media 
Others used this platform to send empowering and positive 
messages, such as “I believe I look good,” “my dress emphasized 
by curves,” and “bigger being better.” Overall, however, nega-
tive messages outweighed positive ones and the majority of the 
negative messages across all themes were concentrated in the 
body image theme. Messages about exercise, weight loss, and 
diet were primarily neutral in tone. 
 We concluded from our study that few women posted body-
related updates on Facebook and most of them did so with a 
neutral tone and focused on exercise, weight loss, or dieting. 
But few women did post about body image and the majority 
of what they disclosed was negative. Th e small overall share of 
these negative body image posts may be reassuring to some, but 
we have reasons to believe that the predominance and infl u-
ence of such communication over Facebook is larger than this 
initial study can attest. First, we have analyzed here only the re-
sponses of women who said they posted on their own timelines 
(12.6 percent of the overall sample). But another 27.4 percent 
had commented on friends’ posts or photos on the same issues, 
which shows an additional communication stream about these 
topics. Furthermore, posts and comments on Facebook do not 
have to be about weight or shape to aff ect body image, as other 
research has shown that women who write status updates about 
their personal lives (unrelated to appearance or weight) and 
receive extremely negative comments are more likely to have 
concerns about their shape, weight, and eating (Hummel and 
Smith 2015). 
 What female Facebook users can take from all this is the 
knowledge that negative comments they write to others, even 
if unrelated to their appearance, may hurt their friends’ body 
image. Also, the very amount of time they spend on Facebook 
may aff ect their own body image negatively and may push them 
into more comparisons with others. Social media off er access 
to more friends, more photos, and more updates, and com-
parisons are often the mechanism through which Facebook ex-
erts its infl uence. Awareness of that may be helpful in reducing 

 
Perspectives 
143
somewhat the urge to compare to others. Finally, it is important 
to realize that many users carefully manage their presentations 
online and often create ideal images of themselves, which is 
far from their real selves (Gonzales and Hancock 2011; Good-
ings and Tucker 2014). Th is could be one reason why so few 
female social media users post updates on body-related issues, 
when we know that these are highly relevant to many of them. 
Knowing this may push women into questioning the realism 
and veracity of the content they see on social media and thus 
guard them against false comparisons to others and extreme 
expectations from themselves.

 Exploring Victimization in the Digital Age: 
Perspectives on Social Media and Sexual Assault 
 Rowena Briones Winkler 
 In recent years, the issue of sexual assault (SA) has come to the 
forefront due to the power of social media. Nonprofi t organiza-
tions, politicians, activists, and survivors alike have harnessed 
these technologies to help spread the word and increase aware-
ness of this issue that continues to pervade and challenge our 
society on a daily basis. With this said, it is imperative to explore 
how social media are used to communicate about a serious issue 
that is in need of more awareness, mobilization, and action. 
Th erefore, this essay aims to describe social media communica-
tion surrounding SA from a variety of diff erent perspectives. 
By exploring the social media conversation surrounding SA, an 
often taboo and stigmatized topic, this essay can provide much 
needed insight on how to handle prevention eff orts and vic-
tim support, as well as how social media communication can be 
used to address social issues like SA in the future. 
 One way that social media has allowed activists to build on-
line dialogue is through hashtags, which are defi ned as tags or 
identifi ers that help to categorize conversations (Stache 2014). 
For SA in particular, this tactic has mostly been used via Twit-
ter as depicted by several recent examples: 
 • Th e #yesallwomen hashtag shared stories of women who 
were ignored by law enforcement and school administra-
tors when they sought help after being assaulted to discuss 

146 
Social Media 
violence against women and the unfair sexual expectations 
directed at women. Th e woman who created the hashtag, 
however, was forced to shut down her personal Twitter ac-
count after being harassed violently on the site. 
 • Christine Fox asked “What were you wearing when you were 
assaulted?” on Twitter in response to the victim-blaming 
around suggestive clothing that typically occurs after an 
assault. Following the activity on Twitter, artist Adrienne 
Simpson created a series of images that more visually dis-
played the tweets and added the hashtag #RapeHasNoUni-
form, which was frequently shared. 
 • Hannah Giorgis created the #WhyIDidntReport hashtag to 
off er individuals an outlet to share stories as to why they 
remained silent after being assaulted. Within several days, 
Giorgis received over 15,000 tweets in response to the 
hashtag, along with over 600 anonymous stories that were 
shared on Tumblr (Giorgis 2014). 
 • Wagatwe Wanjuki created the hashtag #survivorprivilege in 
response to  Washington Post columnist George Will’s opin-
ion piece that sparked major backlash for calling rape a 
“supposed campus epidemic” and tagging rape victims as a 
“coveted status” on college campuses (Will 2014, 1). Many 
survivors angry with the piece participated in the hashtag, 
arguing that there is nothing privileged about life after rape. 
 Not surprisingly, anti-rape social media eff orts have particu-
larly strong roots within the college campus community. With 
94 percent of fi rst-year college students using social media sites 
(Tunheim 2012), several campaigns were developed by student-
led eff orts to hold schools accountable for victim advocacy and 
support. Due to their ease with technology and social media in 
particular, rapid collaborations have taken place both within 
and between college campuses, allowing messages to spread 
quickly to create an anti-rape movement throughout the na-
tion. Two examples are Th e IX Network, a private Facebook 

 
Perspectives 
147
group created to provide solidarity for victims, and Know 
Your IX, a group that provides assistance for students who want 
to fi le federal complaints and put pressure on university lead-
ers. Faculty members have also gotten involved, participating in 
online-based organizations such as Faculty against Rape. 
 With hashtag campaigns and online advocacy groups 
emerging in response to the rape epidemic, there are defi nitely 
benefi ts to increasing awareness of this issue via social media. 
However, there are complications and negative consequences 
to consider as well, otherwise known as the “horrifi c Catch-22 
of rape in the Internet age” (Friedman 2013, 1). Even though 
there is more willingness to confront SA head-on via social 
media, a question remains:  Is this a healthy step in recovery for 
victims in particular, or does it only perpetuate online shaming 
and undermine the therapy process? For many victims, the ha-
rassment and social stigma surrounding the aftermath of the 
experience are diffi  cult to endure. Several cases explicate this: 
17-year-old Rehtaeh Parsons, who took her own life after pho-
tos of her rape circulated at Cole Harbour High School in Nova 
Scotia; 15-year-old Audrie Pott, who killed herself only eight 
days after Facebook photos of her naked body were circulated 
throughout her social circle; and 16-year-old Daisy Coleman, 
who attempted suicide after accusations of being a slut were 
spread on Facebook following a party—one of the only times 
she went out after being raped by a football player two years 
prior to the incident. 
 Th ese cases, among many others, illustrate how the by-
stander eff ect can play a role with social media and accounts of 
SA. According to Darley and Latané (1968), the bystander ef-
fect refers to the notion that the more individuals are present in 
a distressing situation, the less likely one single person will stop 
to help the person in need. Some argue that this very phenom-
enon is occurring when it comes to rape cases spread on social 
media; oftentimes, students who are forwarded photos are too 
scared to speak up in fear of judgment from peers, or that they 
too will be cyberbullied. Even more troubling, friends of the 

148 
Social Media 
victim also fail to report a problem out of a misguided respect 
for the victim, believing that the victim would just want to 
forget about the assault and move on. Th us, the bystander ef-
fect, along with the catch-22 of social media and SA, paints a 
very complex picture for all parties involved. For the fi rst time 
in years, what has been traditionally recognized as an intensely 
private issue is suddenly becoming increasingly more public. 
As Friedman (2013, 1) states: 
 Now that cases regularly crop up in which photos and 
videos of sexual assaults are circulated on social media, it’s 
becoming harder to argue that rape is anything but a pub-
lic scourge. We are all bystanders . . . when we see photos 
and videos of a teen girl’s body or of a high school boy 
bragging about taking advantage of her, this reality is 
thrown into stark relief. And when we see ordinary kids

 Posting, Sharing, and Tweeting a Brand’s Politics: 
Social Media and the Recent Evolution of Online 
Corporate Activism 
 Nathan Gilkerson 
 In the short decade since the dramatic rise of social media plat-
forms such as Facebook and Twitter, companies have evolved 
from primarily using these tools for basic marketing and public 
relations purposes, such as communicating sales and promo-
tions to customers, to an environment in which brands and 
corporate CEOs have become online participants in the na-
tional political dialogue of the day. Although once a practice 
most companies strived to avoid, more and more corporations 
have now begun to strategically engage in online political ac-
tivism, often as a viable method for strengthening customer 
relationships, building corporate reputation, and improving 

150 
Social Media 
internal and external relations. In fact, many consumers now 
expect brands to use social media to “weigh in” on and show 
visible support (or opposition) toward certain hot-button po-
litical issues, such as gay marriage. Some social media users 
today are quick to pressure companies to take a stand and 
join their cause, publicly calling out organizations that remain 
neutral. In particular, Twitter has become a popular venue for 
companies to express support for political causes. 
 Recent headlines have highlighted several high-profi le ex-
amples of this trend, with mixed results for companies willing 
to use social media to wade into the political debate. Several 
corporate CEOs utilized social media to express concern and 
condemn legislation passed in Indiana in 2015 that made it 
legal for businesses in the state to deny services to gay, lesbian, 
and transgender individuals based on religious beliefs. In re-
sponse to the law’s passage, Marc Benioff , CEO of the cloud 
computing company Salesforce.com, announced on Twitter 
that his company was reducing its investments in Indiana and 
would be canceling events requiring employees to travel to the 
state, tweeting, “Today we are canceling all programs that re-
quire our customers/employees to travel to Indiana to face dis-
crimination” (Barbaro and Eckholm 2015). Surrounding the 
2014 protests and civil unrest in Ferguson, Missouri, Starbucks 
CEO Howard Schultz initiated a short-lived companywide 
campaign intended to promote candid conversations about 
race in the United States through the hashtag #RaceTogether 
(Sanders 2015). Although the Starbucks eff ort was widely criti-
cized by business and social commentators as being tone-deaf 
and superfi cial, many also applauded the company’s initiative 
to engage its customers on such a hot-button topic. Around 
the same time, Twitter itself took a political stance and made 
headlines in both social and traditional media by prominently 
painting the hashtag  # BlackLivesMatter on an offi  ce wall of its 
San Francisco headquarters. Including a photo of the painting, 
one Twitter employee proudly tweeted to her followers, “Hon-
ored to work for a company like this. Truly”   (Mandaro 2014).

 While it has become more common for companies to use 
social media to comment on political and social issues, it seems 
some topics are viewed as safer to engage in than others. Al-
though a few brands spoke out on race issues during the height 
of the Ferguson protests, or more recently, during the summer 
of 2015 debate over removal of the Confederate fl ag in South-
ern state capitals, a long list of companies quickly took to social 
media to show their support for the historic June 2015 deci-
sion by the U.S. Supreme Court regarding the legality of gay 
marriage. Using trending hashtags such as #MarriageEquality 
and #LoveWins, major corporate Twitter accounts including 
brands like Ben & Jerry’s, Gap, Visa, and American Airlines 
posted images and messages to convey their support for the 
controversial court decision (Griswold 2015). 
 Beginning around 2012, a number of companies began 
publicly voicing either support or opposition in the political 
debate over gay marriage. Among the earlier most noteworthy 
examples, several Fortune 500 companies including Amazon, 
Starbucks, Microsoft, and Nike formally supported legislation 
legalizing same-sex marriage in Washington state. Alternately, 
the family-owned fast-food chain Chick-fi l-A, which closes its 
locations on Sundays and is known for its CEO’s strongly held 
Christian beliefs, gained national media attention and online 
notoriety by using the company’s charitable organization to 
contribute millions of dollars to conservative groups opposing 
gay marriage (Webley 2012). Consumers across the political 
spectrum have taken to social media to express outrage and 
call for boycotts against companies that have conveyed politi-
cal stances they oppose. As just one example, some Facebook 
users called for a boycott against Oreo when the brand posted a 
photo featuring a rainbow-colored cookie on its Facebook page 
in an eff ort to highlight and show support for LGBT Pride 
Month (Webley 2012). 
 Despite the risk of angering and alienating some consum-
ers, recent industry and academic research has supported the 
notion that corporate involvement in politics can be a winning 

152 
Social Media 
business strategy. Academic research in the fi eld of public rela-
tions has formally conceptualized this activity as “corporate 
social advocacy” and positioned the approach between two 
other traditional areas of public relations practice: issues man-
agement and corporate social responsibility eff orts (Dodd and 
Supa 2014). Strategic issues management within public rela-
tions can be thought of as the proactive monitoring of and 
responding to issues (and critics or opponents, etc.) that can 
aff ect the success or operations of an organization. Alterna-
tively, corporate social responsibility activities are voluntary 
actions taken by a company that are not specifi cally concerned 
with maximizing profi ts, but instead are more focused on 
benefi ting society, such as eff orts to help employees, the envi-
ronment, or the local community. Corporate social advocacy, 
Dodd and Supa argue, specifi cally “refers to an organization 
making a public statement or taking a public stance on social-
political issues” (2014, 5) and can occur either in the form 
of a planned, intentional communication issued from a 
company—such as a formal announcement of corporate sup-
port for a cause or certain legislation on Twitter or Facebook—
or through a less intended or planned action, such as a remark 
made by a CEO to a journalist during an interview or to a 
crowd at a public event. 
 Dodd and Supa (2014) explored the dynamics of consumer 
reactions to corporate social advocacy, using experimental re-
search to test the shifts in “purchase intentions” among study 
participants exposed to information about organizational advo-
cacy eff orts. Gauging both the participants’ political attitudes 
and their self-expressed intention to purchase products or ser-
vices from the companies described in the experiment, the re-
searchers found that subjects who were in agreement with a 
company’s stated political stance were signifi cantly more likely 
to express purchase intent toward that company and, alter-
nately, that lesser subject agreement with a company’s political 
position resulted in a reduction in stated purchase intent. Put 
another way, the researchers found evidence that consumers

153
do care about the political positions taken by a company, and 
reward those companies they agree with by giving them their 
business, while avoiding doing business with organizations es-
pousing politics they disagree with. 
 Research indicates that not only do many consumers con-
sider a company’s politics, but also many of today’s consumers 
are in fact  expecting political involvement from the corporate 
sphere. A 2014 study published by Global Strategy Group, a 
U.S. public aff airs and research fi rm, also examined the dy-
namics of corporate involvement in politics and the potential 
impact on business and reputation. Surveying a U.S. adult 
population, the research found that 56 percent of respondents 
agreed that “Corporations should stand up for what they be-
lieve politically regardless of whether or not it is controversial,” 
with an 89 percent majority expressing they felt companies 
have the power to positively infl uence social change (Global 
Strategy Group 2014). Th e study explored attitudes toward 
“corporate political engagement” related to companies convey-
ing public stances on issues such as the minimum wage, gun 
control, same-sex marriage, and the environment. Th e research 
concluded that when done strategically, with consideration of 
shifting public attitudes and key audiences’ opinions about 
controversial issues, taking a political stance is generally viewed 
as appropriate and can serve to enhance the company’s reputa-
tion. Th e study noted that respondents were generally more 
supportive of companies’ political involvement if the issue was 
viewed as connected to their core business, and that millennial 
respondents were the most likely to indicate strong support for 
corporate advocacy related to specifi c issues, such as LGBT-
related causes (Global Strategy Group 2014). While the Global 
Strategy Group study did not specifi cally report on social media 
usage or respondents’ willingness to take to sites like Facebook 
or Twitter to publicly praise or chastise a company based on its 
politics, data from the Pew Research Center (2013) have shown 
that millennials remain the highest-percentage age group in 
usage of social networking sites and that a strong majority

(66 percent) of all social media users today report having used 
the tools for civic or political activities (Rainie et al. 2012).

 Consumers as Data Profiles: What Companies 
See in the Social You 
 Joseph T. Yun and Brittany R. L. Duff  
 Each day 500 million tweets are posted to Twitter’s social 
media feed (Twitter 2015). Facebook has 1.71 billion monthly 
active users (Facebook 2016). Th ese astounding numbers of 
social media users produce an equally mind-boggling amount 
of data. It is generally assumed that social media companies 
might use data for their own business purposes, but there is a 
growing group of other players that are storing and analyzing 
social media data that many people are not aware of. Data min-
ing of social media is a burgeoning subfi eld of data mining, and 
techniques are being created for further discovery in this realm 
(Barbier and Liu 2011). While users are aware that they are 
posting to public or semipublic venues, they may not be aware 

156 
Social Media 
that their posts can be cataloged as a long-term record. With 
the ever-growing body of social data being stored and the com-
putational techniques alongside it, we are presented with both 
an exciting future of data discovery and potential for concern 
when it comes to privacy. 
 Th e reality of widespread data aggregation went from an 
abstract idea to a very concrete reality with the revelation of 
highly classifi ed documents showing mass data collection of 
U.S. citizens. On June 5, 2013, Edward Snowden, a former 
CIA employee and government contractor, leaked documents 
that showed that the National Security Agency (NSA) was col-
lecting metadata on U.S. citizens, which was previously un-
known. What the general public once thought was conspiracy 
theory hit home as they realized that it was their own personal 
data that were being stored and accessed in ways previously 
unimaginable. 
 With the computational power available in the era of big 
data, data are being stored, accessed, and mined with stagger-
ing ease. Th is holds true for social media data that individuals 
and groups publicly post every day. Whether it is public com-
ments on news sites, posting of statuses to Facebook, broad-
casting an image on Instagram, tweeting 140 characters (or 
less) on Twitter, or even expressing one’s thoughts over Weibo 
(a Chinese social media platform), if the posting is public, it is 
being stored in data warehouses for analysis. Data warehouses 
are physical computer storage repositories where organizations 
centrally store data from various sources. In the case of social 
media, numerous companies now aggregate and store the data 
from as many public social media feeds as they can. Some ex-
amples of these data aggregator companies are Crimson Hexa-
gon, Salesforce Radian6, Gnip, Sysomos, and BrandWatch. 
Th ey connect to each social media feed’s public application 
programming interfaces (a set of programming requirements 
that allow one application to talk to another application, or 
in this case, a way for a data aggregating company to get data 
from the social media company) or, in many cases, they have 

 
Perspectives 
157
a business relationship with the social media company to ob-
tain the full stream of data from its platform. Th ese data ag-
gregator companies store all of the publicly posted social media 
data they can acquire in their data warehouses and then also 
apply their own tools to allow for easy analysis and mining. As 
public social media data and social media platforms continue 
to grow daily, so does the aggregation of these data into data 
warehouses. For example, topsy.com indicates that its Twitter 
database includes all publicly posted tweets from 2006 until 
present day (Topsy 2015). 
 With the aggregation of “easy to access” public social media 
data comes a vast open landscape for research opportunities in 
both the business and the academic sectors. Researchers have 
already attempted to predict future societal trends (i.e., stock 
market movement) with social media data (Asur and Huber-
man 2010) and project personality types of individuals based 
on the content and connections of their social data (Golbeck, 
Robles, and Turner 2011). In the past, it was only possible to 
access, store, and analyze smaller amounts of social media data, 
but now with data aggregation and highly accessible computa-
tional tools, fi nely tuned consumer profi les are being utilized 
by numerous companies. Companies such as Google and Face-
book are well known for their targeted advertising, which is 
driven by the data that are collected from each customer, but 
these companies still largely rely on data that are proprietary to 
their platforms and their organizations. Pieces of our personal 
data are strewn throughout the digital world, but it seems likely 
that consumer research will most likely be accelerated by the 
combination of data storage and the computational power that 
exists today. An example of the potential power of combining 
data aggregation and supercomputing is IBM Watson Blue-
mix, which has cognitive services that give detailed analyses 
of social data in the realms of personality, message resonance 
(matching a message with an individual’s preferences and per-
sonality), and cognitive insights (insights into the mind of the 
individual) (IBM 2015). 

158 
Social Media 
 Various open source and commercial tools exist for large-
scale analysis of social media text as well. Commercial pack-
ages, such as Crimson Hexagon ForSight, allow individuals 
to analyze social text and categorize that text into categories 
such as positive, negative, or neutral sentiment (Crimson 
Hexagon 2015). Open source products, such as NodeXL, 
provide the ability to construct a bird’s eye view perspective 
on the structure of social networks through the data from 
social media feeds (NodeXL 2015). Th e science of network 
analysis can shed light on questions such as which individuals 
and/or groups have positions of power and infl uence within 
a social network. Websites such as overviewproject.org allow 
for researchers to organically compute what sorts of topics or 
themes arise from bodies of social media conversation (Over-
view 2015). Th e algorithms that make up topic modeling are 
allowing companies and people to gain better insight into the 
topics encompassed in a large body of social text (Blei 2012). 
It is likely that these tools and algorithms, when paired with 
the vast stores of social media data, will increase the accessibil-
ity and, therefore, use of social media data to profi le topics, 
trends, and people. Consumers will indeed become associated 
with highly detailed individual data profi les in the very near 
future, profi les that could utilize individual social media post-
ings going back several years. 
 With the revelation of NSA collection of metadata on U.S. 
citizens, researchers began considering whether or not this 
mass data collection violates the Fourth Amendment (unrea-
sonable search or seizure) (Atkins 2014). A similar question 
may be asked with regard to the mass collection of social data 
and provision of services and tools to mine these data. One 
major diff erence between these two would be that U.S. citizens 
were largely unaware of their personal metadata being captured 
and stored by these government programs, whereas individu-
als knowingly post to social media and understand the public 
nature of their posts. Would social media behaviors change if 
everyone knew the permanence of their posts, the widespread 
storage of years of their posts beyond the social media feeds 

 
Perspectives 
159
that they post to, and the growing ability to easily mine and 
analyze their posts? Even if a user decides to delete a post from 
social media and/or delete his or her whole account, what hap-
pens to the posts that are already stored in data warehouses? 
Th e assumption may be that these companies would have an 
agreement with the social media companies to ensure that da-
tabases are synced between the two, especially with regard to 
data deletion, but this is not necessarily guaranteed. 
 Another major problem of privacy is anonymized social 
data. A common practice by companies when it comes to shar-
ing social data is to anonymize the data by removing personal 
names or aliases from data sets. Th is assumes that it would 
take extensive eff ort to reidentify individuals in these social 
data sets, and therefore modeling would be built around larger 
themes as opposed to around any single individual. However, 
researchers at the University of Texas at Austin created an al-
gorithm that allowed them to use one set of social data from 
Flickr to ascertain individual identities in anonymized social 
data from Twitter (Narayanan and Shmatikov 2009). By ana-
lyzing the structure of the social networks (connection patterns 
between people on social media and measures of those connec-
tions), they were able to correctly reidentify 30.8 percent of the 
anonymous users. Only about 12 percent were identifi ed in-
correctly and the rest were not able to be identifi ed; but of the 
12 percent that were incorrectly identifi ed, almost half of were 
close enough to allow for human insight to help reidentify the 
individuals. As computational power increases and algorithms 
become more refi ned, the potential for true anonymity of data 
will become increasingly unlikely.

 The Role of Social Media in Crisis Communication: 
Opportunities and Challenges for Crisis 
Communication Strategies in the Social Media Era 
 Jae-Hwa Shin 
 Since the mid-2000s, social media have played an increasingly 
important role in shaping the perceptions and responses to 
crises. According to Duggan and Smith (2013), nearly three-
quarters of U.S. adults belonged to at least one social media 
site. In addition to managing traditional or controlled media, 
public relations practitioners are today advised to develop a 
crisis response plan that incorporates social media—not as an 
afterthought, but as an integral part of crisis management strat-
egies that are unique to the communication channel. Accord-
ing to Coombs (2014), an organization can use social media to 
quickly report a crisis, which results in less reputational damage 
than if another source fi rst reports. Th is diminishes, or at least 
reconfi gures, the gatekeeping role that was once the domain 
of news organizations. Crises, when they occur, can prove dif-
fi cult to contain. Like putting out a wildfi re with several points 
of origin, it is often hard to know where to start and when one 
is fi nished. On the other hand, as Austin, Liu, and Jin (2012) 
have contended, a growing number of U.S. adults not only 

162 
Social Media 
prefer to get information online, but also perceive information 
gleaned online as more credible than what is available through 
traditional media channels. 
 Social media off er a range of specifi c opportunities and chal-
lenges. Among the opportunities, social media have the poten-
tial to be collaborative, allowing many voices and viewpoints to 
fi nd representation, and the possibility of meaningful two-way 
communication including the opportunity to mobilize and 
reach a plethora of voices. New media can amplify traditional 
media or provide a forum for discussion and debate of sto-
ries that originate through other media channels. On the other 
hand, social media often initiate or lead news stories on tradi-
tional media.  Columbia Journalism Review reported that nearly 
60 percent of journalists have Twitter accounts, while a study 
conducted by the University of Indiana School of Journalism 
found that almost 54 percent were active users. Clearly, even 
for media professionals, social media have the advantages of 
timeliness, fl exibility, and directness. Timeliness is a key fac-
tor. As Cho, Jung, and Park (2013) have shown, news of the 
2011 earthquake in Japan began to surface on Twitter 20 min-
utes before traditional news sources began to report the story. 
Moreover, the interactive potential of social media, as demon-
strated as early as 2007 in the immediate wake of shootings at 
Virginia Tech, during the Arab Spring and Haitian earthquake, 
and the 2013 attack on Westgate Mall in Kenya, represents a 
key advantage in connection to risk communication and fos-
tering public awareness during an emergent crisis (Simon et al. 
2014). On a more mundane but nevertheless powerful level, 
social media present the opportunity for the public to engage 
directly with organizations or celebrities. Distinctions between 
content creators, gatekeepers, and audiences, stakeholders, or 
publics are thus eroded. 
 Challenges include managing the sheer volume of informa-
tion. Separating the wheat from the chaff  becomes an onerous 
task and few organizations have the resources to fully scan 
the social media environment 24/7. Nonprofi t organizations

in particular historically have failed to recognize the poten-
tial for two-way communication embedded in social media 
(Muralidharan et al. 2011). In contrast to traditional media, 
the emerging nature of social media makes more apparent the 
struggle to manage the fl ow of information amid the noise. 
According to Cho and Gower, the way a crisis is framed af-
fects how an event is evaluated, as “the public perceives not the 
objective fact of a crisis event, but the facts constructed by the 
media or news releases from the party in crisis” (2006, 420). 
Austin, Liu, and Jin (2012) suggested that it mattered less to 
many social media users whether or not crisis information was 
accurate or not. Th e speed with which a single tweet can travel 
can incite unanticipated consequences. 
 Th e Red Cross learned this lesson in February 2011 when 
social media director Wendy Harman accidentally posted 
a tweet about beer that included the phrase “when we drink 
we do it right” followed by the hashtag “#gettngslizzerd.” Th e 
tweet went unnoticed for about an hour before it was followed 
with an explanation issued by the organization: “We’ve deleted 
the rogue tweet but rest assured the Red Cross is sober and 
we’ve confi scated the keys.” Th e strategy, which mixed correc-
tive action with self-deprecating humor, proved eff ective and 
led to a fund-raising opportunity including a partnership with 
Dogfi sh Head beer, the subject of the “rogue tweet” (“Case 
Study” 2011). Th e same may be said of the way DKNY han-
dled a photographer’s claim that the company improperly used 
one of his images in a display. Claiming it was an accident, the 
company issued a sincere apology backed up with a donation 
of $25,000 to a local YMCA. 
 Applebee’s restaurant had less success negotiating social 
media in 2013 in the wake of the fi ring of Chelsea Welch, a 
waitress who posted a photograph on her personal Facebook 
account of a minister’s bill decrying the 18 percent tip added 
to the bill with “I give God 10% why do you get 18.” Th e 
company claimed that Welch violated the customer’s privacy, 
a reasonable proposition until it was revealed on social media 

164 
Social Media 
that the company had itself posted a similar receipt on the cor-
porate Facebook account that clearly identifi ed a client. Apple-
bee’s attempts to defend its actions quickly garnered more than 
10,000 comments, the majority of which were negative (“Big 
Op-Ed” 2013). Further complicating the crisis response, the 
company attempted to delete many of the negative comments 
and entered into argumentation with customers. Th eir defen-
sive response violated the public’s growing expectation, fos-
tered by social media, for transparency and candor (Wendling, 
Radisch, and Jacobzone 2013). 
 Celebrities and public fi gures often evade crisis situations, 
distort their responses, and exacerbate the situation in social 
media environments, often making the crisis more conspicu-
ous and extensive. In the context of revelations about doping, 
Lance Armstrong concentrated on the crisis communication 
strategies of attacking the accuser, stonewalling, and bolstering 
on his offi  cial Twitter account, which was inconsistent with a 
range of strategies such as mortifi cation, conforming, and ret-
rospective regret that he used in his Oprah Winfrey interview. 
Armstrong failed to exhibit a similar degree of contrition and 
be consistent in his crisis response strategies between traditional 
media and social media (Hambrick, Frederick, and Sanderson 
2015). He thus missed the opportunity to eff ectively respond 
to the crisis and possibly redirect the audience to more positive 
themes and images. 
 Organizations can be blindsided by social media attacks. 
Planned Parenthood proved to be unprepared for the successful 
attacks mounted on social media by LiveAction. As Wigley and 
Zhang contended, “Crisis managers should think about social 
media as a way to prepare for a crisis and develop relation-
ships with stakeholders, by using dialogue, etc.” (2011). Social 
media have become a crucial platform for crisis responses and 
occurrences as well. Although organizations can monitor or de-
tect a sign or prodrome of crisis, more often they respond to 
crisis with selected strategies ranging from “simple denial” to 
“mortifi cation” on social media (Benoit 1995).

 A recent illustration of the power of social media to aff ect 
attitudes occurred on August 9, 2014, at 12:03 p.m. when 
Twitter user @Th eePharoah posted the now famous message 
“I JUST SAW SOMEONE DIE OMFG.” Within the course 
of the next few minutes, this and a subsequent photograph of 
Michael Brown’s slain body in Ferguson, Missouri, had been 
rapidly retweeted nearly 6,000 times. Th e city of Ferguson 
failed to respond for more than fi ve hours, heightening the per-
ception that the police had acted improperly. Other blunders, 
such as lack of sensitivity in communicating with the public, 
the restricted access to journalists, and the militaristic tactics 
employed on the ground, led to an escalation of the crisis 
(DeVries 2015). Considered as an organization facing a crisis, 
the city of Ferguson would have benefi ted from advice about 
the role of social media in a communication strategy off ered 
by Veil, Beuhner, and Palenchar (2011): accentuate open, hon-
est communication from the start, collaborate with the media, 
and adopt a stance of empathy that suggests partnership with 
stakeholder publics.

 Lessons from the Social Media Revolution?: 
A Look Back at Social Media’s Role in Political 
Campaigns and Elections 
 Terri L. Towner 
 Over the past decade, social media sites have emerged as im-
portant hubs of political information and activity. Sites, such 
as Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, and blogs, have rapidly trans-
formed citizen-to-citizen and citizen-to-government interac-
tion in a manner not seen before. Specifi cally, citizens can share 
their political attitudes, gather campaign information, connect 
with candidates and parties, and become politically mobilized. 
As a result, scholars from a variety of disciplines have exam-
ined how political candidates, parties, and citizens employ 

168 
Social Media 
social media during campaigns, and, most importantly, how 
these online sites infl uence their political attitudes and behav-
iors. A look back at recent elections suggests that social media 
transformed political campaigning, but scholarly research im-
plies that it did not revolutionize citizens’ political knowledge 
or participation. Th is nonrevolution can be attributed to the 
campaign strategy itself as well as the limitations of existing 
scholarly research. 
 Since the 1990s, political candidates have incorporated on-
line technologies into their campaign strategies. By the 2012 
presidential election, both Barack Obama and Mitt Romney 
fully embraced social media platforms to market themselves to 
voters. In fact, both candidates were locked in a social media 
war, each employing a variety of online platforms to connect, 
mobilize, and inform citizens. Candidates used social media 
to target specifi c voters, discuss policy issues, trumpet their 
accomplishments, and attack their opponents (Pew Research 
Center 2012). Undeniably, social media have changed cam-
paigning, as candidates can communicate with voters without 
the mainstream media fi lter and distribute information cheaper 
and faster. Yet, campaigns fail to employ a distinguishing fea-
ture: the social aspect. Campaigns deliver information in a top-
down or one-way fashion while neglecting direct interaction 
and two-way communication with citizens. Considering the 
latter, social media are best viewed as another mode for cam-
paigns to spread information. As a result, social media’s impact 
on citizens’ political knowledge and participation is found to 
be limited. 
 Regarding political knowledge, studies suggest that social 
media’s infl uence in creating an informed citizenry is mini-
mal (Baumgartner and Morris 2010; Dimitrova et al. 2014; 
Groshek and Dimitrova 2011; Kaufhold, Valenzuela, and Gil 
de Zúñiga 2010; Pasek, More, and Romer 2009; Towner and 
Dulio 2011a). Citizens are not employing social media to be-
come more politically knowledgeable. Instead, these platforms 
are used for entertainment and to connect with friends, family, 

 
Perspectives 
169
or people in the community rather than for information-
seeking (Anderson and Caumont 2014; Dimitrova et al. 2014). 
 While it is clear that social media do not enhance politi-
cal knowledge, research fi ndings on social media’s impact on 
political participation are rather mixed. On one hand, some 
scholars off er evidence that social media use signifi cantly in-
creases offl  ine political participation, such as voting, signing 
a written petition, and boycotting (Dimitrova et al. 2014; Gil 
de Zúñiga, Jung, and Valenzuela 2012; Gil de Zúñiga, Mo-
lyneux, and Zheng 2014; Towner 2013; Towner and Dulio 
2011a, 2011b; Zhang, Seltzer, and Bichard 2013). On the 
other hand, other research found no empirical link between 
social media and offl  ine engagement (Baumgartner and Morris 
2010; Groshek and Dimitrova 2011; Towner 2015). Regard-
ing online political participation, research is more promising, 
indicating that social media use increases forms of digital en-
gagement, such as e-mailing, making an online donation, and 
following a candidate on a social networking site (Baumgartner 
and Morris 2010; Gil de Zúñiga, Jung, and Valenzuela 2012; 
Gil de Zúñiga, Molyneux, and Pei Zheng 2014; Towner 2013; 
Zhang, Seltzer, and Bichard 2013). In fact, Boulianne’s (2015) 
meta-analysis concludes that social media have only marginal 
eff ects on political participation during campaigns, asserting 
that future research on social media eff ects must move beyond 
utilizing college student samples and cross-sectional research. 
 Due to several reasons, social media’s role in campaigning is 
found to be nonrevolutionary as well as nonimpactful on citizens. 
First, campaigns transmit information on social media in a one-
way fashion with little dialogue or open discussion. Campaigns 
that employ social media to their full potential, such as utilizing 
staff  to respond to citizens’ questions and comments, will likely 
have more infl uence on citizens’ attitudes and behaviors. Second, 
the scholarly work on social media eff ects is limited in research 
design. For example, research largely focuses on presidential 
campaigns rather than local- or state-level campaigns. Due to 
nonpartisan, local elections, “at-large” voting districts, and often 

170 
Social Media 
competitive gubernatorial races, one could argue that social 
media have more signifi cant eff ects on citizen attitudes during 
state- and local-level campaigning. In addition, scholars examin-
ing social media eff ects during campaigns rely largely on con-
venience samples of college students, rarely examining national 
adult samples. Adults, who are increasingly using social media 
for social and civic reasons, may consume campaign information 
diff erently than young people. Th us, the impact of social media 
could have varying eff ects on adults’ political knowledge and 
participation. Last, the measurement of political participation 
requires reconceptualization to include both offl  ine and online 
forms of engagement (e.g., voting, protesting, e-mailing, “fan-
ning” a candidate) as well as new modes (e.g., adding or deleting 
an application or “app” about politics) as technology advances. 
It is possible that current measures of political participation are 
not capturing all forms of engagement and thus resulting in little 
to no social media eff ects. In sum, given that social media use in 
campaigning is ever-changing, its eff ects on citizens continue to 
require examination during future elections.

typical top-down, one-way communication model. Instead, 
individuals’ personal expressions and opinions have become 
more public than ever. Access to computers, mobile devices, 
and free social media platforms give everyday people the ability 
to promote their ideas and ideals. User-generated content has 
transformed the social media ecosystem, turning into a very 
complex and transactional virtual community, where commu-
nication comes, goes, and intersects like a web. Th is access has 
created an oversimplifi ed notion that the Internet has democ-
ratized information, but this is not that simple. Instead, social 
media sites have fostered safer and alternative virtual environ-
ments more conducive to the expression of controversial issues, 
like groups and other less-intrusive platforms, away from the 
scrutiny of known relationships. 
 As people are more free to talk and express their thoughts, 
they have also become more unwilling to share what could be 
deemed “inappropriate” or opposite to the socially desired an-
swer or perceived public’s opinion. Th is results in a possible 
social media self-censorship, the process of suppressing one’s 
own opinion, particularly in the midst of controversial issues. 
Th is essay uses the Spiral of Silence Th eory to explore self-
censorship on social media and examines techniques used to 
relate and “save face” in the midst of controversial issues, in-
cluding participation in groups or using less invasive social 
media sites like Twitter. 
 Although controversial issues such as same-sex marriage, hate 
speech, racism, or vaccinations often “pop up” on timelines in 
forms of texts, images, and memes, most people are careful to 
express controversial issues, even if this means agreeing with it 
by liking or sharing. A 2014 Pew Research Center study shows 
that people are less likely to post views if their followers do not 
share their opinions (Hampton et al. 2014). As with television, 
social media have a way to crystalize public opinion. It might 
not show what the majority view is, but it will give people the 
impression of what it could be, and according to the Spiral of 
Silence Th eory, that impression is enough to keep people with 

174 
Social Media 
opposing views silent. Th e Spiral of Silence Th eory explains the 
growth and spread of public opinion, which is an intangible 
force that “keeps people in line.” Coined by Elisabeth Noelle-
Neumann, the Spiral of Silence Th eory refers to the pressure 
people feel to conceal their views when they think they are 
the minority (Noelle-Neumann 1984). It is a communication 
process in which people who think they hold a minority view 
do not speak up because of fear of social exclusion and relation-
ship loss. 
 Th e Internet expansion in the past 20 years has created an 
opportunity and platform for freedom of expression. Th e prev-
alence of social media sites fostered an assumption that people 
would be fully free to express themselves, even if they were 
part of a minority view. Th e reality is that despite the boom 
of these social media sites, users are still cautious of what they 
share, particularly on social media sites with symmetrical rela-
tionship ties like Facebook, where the friendship is mutual and, 
in most cases, personal. Although social media sites and the 
First Amendment give Internet users the ability to share their 
personal views, “save face” continues to be a desirable behavior. 
 While many researchers have questioned the applicability 
of the Spiral of Silence Th eory to online behavior, the funda-
mental concept of the theory explains that social media users 
also engage in self-censorship if they fear their opinion is the 
minority. People’s perception of dominant views has a lot to 
do with their willingness to share personal opinions on social 
media. Users seek alternative virtual spheres where it is safer to 
express controversial opinions. One of the advantages of social 
media, however, is the ability to participate in controversial dis-
courses through alternative pathways, away from the scrutiny 
of people directly related, where similar views are shared, even 
if they are the opposite to the perceived majority. Th ese include 
groups, less-invasive social media sites like Twitter, specifi c chat 
rooms and forums, and, in some extreme cases, the creation of 
aliases and fake profi les.

 Facebook, for example, allows members to organize them-
selves into groups. In 2014, Google indexed 620 million Face-
book groups, and a user can join up to 6,000 groups at any 
given time. In these groups, members are allowed to share 
updates, photos, and documents and send messages to other 
group members. Th ere are diff erent types of groups, depend-
ing on the desired level of privacy: public, closed, and secret 
groups. 
 Public Groups: Anyone can join, be added, or invited to 
public groups. Th ey are also visible in search results and 
anyone can see the comments, group members’ names, 
and their posts. Public groups give users a selective audi-
ence to share controversial ideas, but these groups are wide 
open. Closed and secret groups are more likely than the 
public groups to host members with controversial views. 
 Closed Groups:  In closed groups, anyone can ask to join, 
see the group description, and view who is in the group, 
but only members can see what is posted in the group’s 
News Feed. Th e moderator has to approve a member-
ship request, and depending on the subject and sensibil-
ity of the issue, as with the “unpopular” anti-vaccination 
groups, for example, further steps are taken to avoid the 
acceptance of “trolls.” 
 Secret Groups:  Secret groups are virtually invisible on Face-
book. To join, a member must be added or invited by a 
current member. Th is provides the ultimate level of pri-
vacy to members. 
 Th ose who feel they hold the minority opinion on contro-
versial issues may also join less-invasive and impersonal groups 
like Twitter, which off ers a diff erent platform than Facebook. 
Th e asymmetrical structure of Twitter gives users the option to 
follow, without being followed. Conversations are aggregated 
into hashtags and @mentions, and these interactions often take 

176 
Social Media 
place among users with little or no personal relationship. Th e 
hashtags have also been used as a great tool to diff use informa-
tion, regardless of relationship statuses. Hashtags allow topics 
to be organized and collected as “trends,” and due to the lack of 
personal relationships, ideas are shared with the main purpose 
of self-expression without the expectation of reciprocation. Of 
the eleven reasons for using Twitter identifi ed by the Ameri-
can Press Institute, only three were somewhat relational; all the 
other nine reasons were topic-specifi c (Rosenstiel et al. 2015). 
Th is gives those with minority views a less-invasive platform to 
express controversial views. Th ere are also other virtual spaces 
where people are more comfortable to voice their opinions be-
sides the well-known social media sites mentioned, including 
forums, chat rooms, blogs, and newsgroups. 
 Social media without a doubt have given an edge to the de-
mocratization of information: people are able to speak up more 
and share their perspectives and points of view. However, the 
relational nature of human beings, the need for acceptance, 
and saving face are still valued in human interactions—in some 
cultures even more than others. Ultimately, social media users, 
in fear of being in the minority view, seek alternative strategies 
to voice their opinions. Saving face, overall, continues to be 
the ultimate human communication goal, even if the opinion 
is not really the minority view but just perceived to be the mi-
nority view.

 Live Tweeting: Fans and Celebrities 
 Michelle Groover 
 Social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and Snap-
chat are used by many people today—including celebrities. 
Twitter is a microblogging site that allows users to send and 
receive messages in the form of text, links, photos, or videos 
up to 140 characters in length. Th is article will explore the 
phenomenon of “live tweeting” and take a look at how Twit-
ter is used to tweet during the airing of a popular television 
program. 
 In June 2015, Nielsen listed the top 10 television programs 
in the United States by average audience and average number 
of tweets during an airing of each program from September 1, 
2014, to May 24, 2015 (Nielsen 2015). Th e report stated 
the show with the highest average audience tweeting about 
it was  Th e Walking Dead , with a typical audience of more 
than 4.3 million and averaging 480,000 tweets during the 
eight months investigated . Also in the top 10 were  Game of

 Many television programs list a hashtag in the lower por-
tion of the screen when it airs. Th is hashtag provides viewers 
with a way to join the conversation with others watching the 

178 
Social Media 
program, which includes other fans and, at times, the stars of 
the program. Other times, viewers will create a hashtag based 
around what is happening in the current plot. 
 Th e sixth ranked show in the Nielsen list was  Scandal with 
an average audience of more than 2.4 million and averaging 
282,000 tweets (Nielsen 2015). Not only are fans of the show 
live tweeting during each episode, but stars of the show are as 
well.  Scandal uses a number of hashtags to interact with its au-
dience; however, the primary hashtag is #Scandal. 
 During  Scandal  episodes, many of the primary cast members 
will live tweet with the audience. Th ough all do not participate 
in live tweeting every week, they try to let their fans know when 
they are. For example, during the airing of the Th ursday night 
program on April 17, 2015, Kerry Washington [Olivia Pope] 
tweeted, “On set but will tweet as much as I can! WHADDUP 
West Coast?! #scandal.” Washington is also often asked what 
clothes her character is wearing and she often answers. When 
she is not able to tweet, someone handling her publicity will 
respond. Th ese tweets are noted by the “kw’s krew” signature 
on the tweet. For example, “#PapaPopeisBACK! Watch #Scan-
dal NOW!—kw’s krew.” In this way, fans know Washington 
is not participating, but still wants to connect with her fans. 
Also, some of the actors will tweet photos from the set or where 
they are watching that evening’s show. For example, on De-
cember 16, 2014, Scott Foley [Jake] tweeted “#scandal selfi e. 
On location today!,” which was accompanied by a photo. Ad-
ditionally, cast members will tweet about a scene along with 
viewers. For example, following a scene where Olivia provides 
advice to Mellie about winning the Senate election, Jeff  Perry 
[Cyrus] tweeted, “Liv reading chapter & verse on how Mel-
lie can win . . . CLASSIC OP! #tgit #scandal.” Th ese types of 
tweets provide the viewers with insights from the stars, news 
about what is happening on the set, and their thoughts on key 
storylines. In doing so, viewers feel more invested in what they 
are watching.

 Th e show’s May 2015 season fi nale used the hashtag #Scan-
dalFinale. While many fan tweets focused on the content of the 
show, some directed their messages to the stars themselves—
with some receiving responses. Prior to the airing of the fi nale, 
a fan asked Foley if he could describe the fi nale in one word, 
to which Foley responded “Absolutely not!” Other fans asked 
the stars if they would not only be live tweeting during the 
East Coast airing, but also the West Coast airing. Tony Gold-
wyn [Fitz] wrote “Might be a little sleepy but I’ll be tweeting.” 
Prior to the East Coast airing, Goldwyn asked on Twitter who 
would be live tweeting with the cast that evening, which re-
ceived 57 retweets and 131 favorites. Th roughout the fi nale, 
the stars originated tweets related to the scenes being aired 
at the time, with these tweets being retweeted and favorited by 
the fans. Additionally, the stars tweeted kudos to their fellow 
castmates. Washington tweeted, “Wow. @KatieQLowes and 
@guillermodiazyo you ROCKED this scene!!!! #ScandalFinale.” 
Following the airing of the fi nale on the East Coast, Goldwyn 
tweeted, “Th anks for another AWESOME season #Gladiators!! 
See you in September! #Nothing without you #Scandal.” In 
this one statement, Goldwyn let fans know they are the reason 
the show has become popular. 
 While many fans will live tweet regardless of whether or not 
the stars of the show participate, it is interesting how much more 
lively the conversations and questions are when there is partici-
pation from the cast. Even when stars do not live tweet every 
episode, their participation helps the show succeed, as seen in 
Goldwyn’s response following the show’s 2015 season fi nale. 
 In conclusion, live tweeting during a television program can 
bring people closer to their friends, as well as introduce them 
to other fans of the show. Additionally, fans recognize the pos-
sibility their favorite cast member could answer their questions. 
A show’s success is not always found in the number of people 
watching the program, but in those who are talking about it 
and what they are talking about.

 Introduction 
 Th e tools of social media have helped spread the messages of 
political, economic, and fund-raising movements to local com-
munities to encourage participation and also to the media and 
other audiences around the world to raise awareness. Th rough 
social media, participants also developed a sense they were part 
of a greater movement, which likely strengthened their com-
mitment to the cause. Th is chapter will fi rst highlight the ALS 
Ice Bucket Challenge, the Arab Spring uprisings, and Occupy 
Wall Street as important movements that were propelled by 
social media. 
 Th e success of social media platforms has been a direct 
consequence of the determination, creativity, and business 
acumen of the entrepreneurs behind the various platforms. 
Th is chapter will also profi le the founders of today’s most 
popular social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, 
LinkedIn, Snapchat, and Tumblr as well as some of the early 
social media pioneers of sites such as MySpace and Flickr. 
Th is chapter will also highlight key thought leaders, bloggers, 
authors, marketers, and scholars in the social media industry

 Movements 
 ALS Ice Bucket Challenge (2014) 
 Perhaps no other campaign has ever reached greater success 
in terms of participation, fund-raising, social media chatter, 
and attention in popular culture than the ALS Ice Bucket 
Challenge. Th is campaign was truly a grassroots eff ort, fueled 
by friends of an amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) victim 
and spread through social media by millions of participants 
ranging from average citizens to celebrities. Signifi cant cover-
age by traditional media and participation by personalities on 
television and YouTube further accelerated awareness of the 
campaign and the cause. 
 Th e ALS Association (ALSA), which benefi ted from the cam-
paign, is the only national nonprofi t organization that conducts 
research and provides resources for people living with ALS. Th e 
Ice Bucket Challenge was not organized by the organization it-
self, but has been a tradition in sports that has been used for 
other causes in the past. Televised ice bucket challenges started 
with the Golf Channel’s program  Morning Drive , which was 
followed by  Th e Today Show ’s Matt Lauer who had been nomi-
nated by golfer Greg Norman. Th e Golf Channel’s segment did 
not mention any donations to charity while  Th e Today Show 
indicated that if the challenge was not taken, the person nom-
inated must donate to a charity. Other ice bucket challenges 
at the time included motocross racer Jeff  Northrop who ran a 
campaign on Instagram for his nephew’s medical needs as well 
as a women’s basketball campaign called #Chillin4Charity that 
raised money for the Kay Yow Cancer Fund (Levin 2014). 
 On the same day as  Th e Today Show ’s ice bucket challenge 
demonstration, professional golfer Chris Kennedy chal-
lenged his cousin, Jeanette Senerchia, and because her hus-
band has ALS, asked for a donation to be made to the ALSA

(ALS Association n.d.). Th rough the power of social networks, 
one of Jeannette’s friends was connected to Pat Quinn in Yon-
kers, New York, who was in turn connected to former Boston 
College baseball player Pete Frates in Boston, both of whom 
have ALS (ALS Association n.d.). From the northeast of the 
United States, the campaign spread throughout the country 
and around the world. Although many diff erent stories exist 
about the origin of the campaign, Josh Levin of  Slate off ered 
the following in an article about the invention of the Ice Bucket 
Challenge: “No matter the answer, it’s clear that the year’s biggest 
viral trend isn’t about any single person. Rather, it’s one of the 
best examples we’ve ever seen of the Internet’s amazing ability 
to connect people and spread ideas” (Levin 2014). 
 Th e original challenge involved a participant making a choice 
between donating $100 to the ALSA or creating a video where 
the participant would dump a bucket of ice water on his or her 
head. Th e challenge then quickly transformed into one where 
the participant would dump the water and still make the dona-
tion. Social media played an important role because not only 
did people create some engaging and entertaining content for 
their friends to view on Facebook, Twitter, and other platforms, 
but also the participant used the video to nominate three friends 
to participate in the challenge, causing participation to spread 
exponentially. Th e campaign also peaked in the summer, a time 
when pouring a bucket of ice water over one’s head seemed 
most appealing. Notable celebrities who were challenged in-
cluded then-president Barack Obama (who opted to make the 
donation instead of dumping ice water), Justin Bieber, LeBron 
James, former president George W. Bush, and Bill Gates. 
 Th is campaign was compelling for a number of reasons. In 
an interview with the  Guardian , Eb Adeyeri of We Are Social 
suggested that the campaign indulges certain personality traits 
that are common to social media users. He noted: 
 It encourages a competitive spirit, with each participant 
trying to make their video more amusing, absurd or 

186 
Social Media 
outrageous than the last. It also plays on the fact people 
often have narcissistic tendencies on their own social 
media feeds and enjoy an excuse to post images and videos 
of themselves. It works perfectly with the guilt factor. 
Even if you think it’s a stupid campaign it’s hard to ignore 
a personal (and very public) nomination from a friend in 
the name of charity. It also embraces the community spirit 
of social media; rather than sponsoring someone to climb 
a mountain or run a marathon, the low barrier to entry 
means everyone can get involved and feel as though they’ve 
done something good with their day. ( Th e Guardian 2014) 
 Other professionals interviewed for the same article suggested 
that the popularity of the campaign was driven by the appeal 
of viewing videos featuring friends and family members, the 
ease of which participants could capture and upload video 
using smartphones, the simplicity of the supplies involved in 
the campaign, and the low commitment required to consume 
the content because the videos are short ( Th e Guardian 2014). 
 Th e campaign generated more than 17 million videos that 
were watched by 440 million people a total of 10 billion times 
(ALS Association n.d.). In terms of fi nancial success, a total 
of 2.5 million people donated approximately $115 million to 
the ALSA (Bonifi eld 2015). Th e money was divided into fi ve 
main spending “buckets,” including the bulk of it going toward 
research, then patient and community services, followed by 
public and professional education, and then a small percentage 
going toward both fund-raising and external processing fees. 
 Arab Spring (2010–2011) 
 Th e “Arab Spring” was a series of protests, riots, and demonstra-
tions across several Arab countries that began on December 18, 
2010, in Tunisia with the self-immolation protest demonstra-
tion by Mohamed Bouazizi in the city of Sidi Bouzid (NPR 
Staff  2011). Some of the fi rst countries to follow with uprisings 
included Algeria, Jordan, Egypt, and Yemen, which were then 

 
Profiles 
187
followed by many other countries in the Arab world. Many 
citizens of these countries could no longer tolerate cruel and 
unfair regimes and demanded the opportunity to live a more 
dignifi ed life (Goldstein 2014). In Tunisia, Egypt, Yemen, and 
Libya, the unrest led to leaders being removed from power, and 
in several other countries, the leaders announced they would 
not seek a subsequent term. Bahrain, Syria, Iraq, Kuwait, Mo-
rocco, and Sudan also experienced civil disobedience and pro-
tests, and several other countries throughout the region were 
also touched by minor protests. 
 Scholars have debated whether social media were the catalyst 
of the revolutions or played another role, such as a method for 
reporting on events. Th e Arab Spring is even sometimes re-
ferred to as a “Twitter Revolution” or “Facebook Revolution.” 
An article in the  Arab Social Media Report described how the 
usage of social media in the Arab world exploded after vari-
ous bans were lifted, allowing citizens “to organize demonstra-
tions (both pro- and anti-government), disseminate information 
within their networks, and raise awareness of ongoing events 
locally and globally” and governments “in some cases to engage 
with citizens and encourage their participation in government 
processes, while in other cases to block access to websites and 
monitor and control information on these sites” (Salem and 
Mourtada 2011, 2). 
 Th e impact of social media during the Arab Spring can be ex-
plored through the decisions made by various governments, pro-
testers, and the social networking sites themselves. For example, 
governments of various countries ordered a block or a lifting of 
the ban on certain social media sites or the Internet itself during 
the Arab Spring. In Algeria, Facebook and Twitter were partially 
blocked on January 9, 2011, and in Syria, Facebook returned 
on February 6, 2011, after having been blocked since late 2007. 
Egypt blocked the Internet for fi ve days in January 2011, and 
Libya shut down the Internet in February 2011 for two par-
tial days. Some governments and their supporters started using 
social media sites to engage with citizens, as was done by the 

188 
Social Media 
Egyptian Military Council, or to urge people to stop protests, 
as pro-government supporters did in Sudan. In some cases, the 
social networking platforms themselves suspended certain ac-
counts, such as Facebook’s shutdown of the Palestinian Intifada 
page with 350,000 supporters (Salem and Mourtada 2011). 
 Th e most signifi cant use of social media, however, was by 
protesters as many calls for protests made on Facebook devel-
oped into actual protests on the specifi ed date. For ten protest 
calls examined in a research study, all but one in Syria and the 
initial protest in Tunisia developed into a protest (Salem and 
Mourtada 2011). In the case of Tunisia, after the initial protest, 
those that followed were organized on Facebook. Th e research-
ers addressed the causality of social media when they noted, 
“Th is is not to say that there was a causal relationship, or that 
the Facebook pages were the defi ning or only factor in people 
organizing themselves on these dates, but as the initial plat-
form for these calls, it cannot be denied that they were a factor 
in mobilizing movements. However, given the small Facebook 
penetration in most of these countries . . . it can be argued that 
for many protesters these tools were not central” (Salem and 
Mourtada 2011, 5). Facebook was likely used by a small, but 
active group of protesters who then used other means to mo-
bilize a wider set of contacts, possibly through another digital 
method, mobile phones, or personal interactions. 
 Th e same study found that the most popular usage of Face-
book for citizens in Egypt and Tunisia during early 2011 was to 
“raise awareness inside the country on the causes of the move-
ments.” For Egypt, the second most popular reason for usage 
was to “organize actions and manage activists” while the third 
most popular reason for usage was to “spread information to 
the world about the movement and related events.” In Tunisia, 
the second and third most popular reasons were the reverse of 
Egypt. Finally, for both countries, “entertainment and social 
uses” were the least popular reasons for using Facebook (Salem 
and Mourtada 2011). Also, the highest percentage of citizens 
of both countries (88.1 percent for Tunisia and 94.3 percent 

 
Profiles 
189
for Egypt) reported getting news and information during the 
civil movements from social media sources instead of tradi-
tional media, including local, regional, and state-sponsored 
media (Salem and Mourtada 2011). 
 Authors Clay Shirky and Malcolm Gladwell considered the 
role of social media in social activism and revolutions, and their 
contrasting arguments provided context for the Arab Spring. 
Prior to events that led to the uprisings, Gladwell had argued 
in a piece for the  New Yorker that Twitter and Facebook have 
been overemphasized by the media as political action tools 
(Wasik 2011). In  Foreign Aﬀ airs , also prior to the Arab Spring, 
Shirky claimed that digital media had a crucial role in political 
incidents, such as the 2009 defeat of the Communist govern-
ment in Moldova and the 2001 impeachment of the Philippine 
president (Wasik 2011). He addressed Gladwell’s charge that 
online activism is superfi cial and argued “the fact that barely 
committed actors cannot click their way to a better world does 
not mean that committed actors cannot use social media ef-
fectively” (Wasik 2011). At the end of a  Wired article that ad-
dresses the debate between the two scholars, Wasik concluded 
that “Activists may need ‘strong ties’ to risk their lives in the 
streets, but it’s clear those ties can stretch across continents, and 
can consist entirely of bits—right up until the moment when 
they come together” (Wasik 2011). 
 Occupy Wall Street (2011) 
 Occupy Wall Street was a grassroots movement of protests that 
started in September 2011 against fi nancial inequality and cor-
ruption occurring within the fi nancial sector in the United 
States. Th e movement’s slogan, “We are the 99%,” refers to 
those who are not in the richest 1 percent of the population. 
Th e trigger for the movement may have been a July 2011 tweet 
by anticonsumerism magazine  Adbusters suggesting a march 
on Wall Street in September (Preston 2011). Th e movement, 
which started in Zuccotti Park in Manhattan, moved outward 
throughout the United States and around the world. 

190 
Social Media 
 Social media, particularly Twitter and Facebook, helped the 
protest spread quickly to others communities throughout the 
United States. An article in the  Economist suggested Occupy 
Wall Street, and not the Arab Spring, was “the world’s fi rst gen-
uine social-media uprising” (G.L. 2011). Th e campaign used 
a Facebook page that had 170,000 fans as of October 2011, 
Twitter hashtags #occupywallst and #ows, a website at Occupy
Together.org, a Tumblr blog called “We are the 99 Percent,” 
meet-ups in more than 1,300 cities around the world, and a 
Kickstarter campaign that raised more than $75,000 (G.L. 
2011). Counting all Facebook pages for the campaign, a total 
of 450,000 people had liked the pages as of October 2011 
(Kanalley 2011). One month later, another news story reported 
the movement had 400 Facebook pages with a total of 2.7 mil-
lion fans (Preston 2011). YouTube housed 1.7 million videos 
with 73 million combined views tagged with “occupy” in the 
“News and Politics” category, although it is likely that some 
of these were not relevant to the movement (Preston 2011). 
Wikis and Web pages also abounded online including Occupy
WallSt.org and HowtoOccupy.org. On Twitter, @occupywall
stnyc had more than 94,000 followers in November 2011, and 
according to Trendrr, an average of 400,000 to 500,000 tweets 
per day had been shared about the movement since early Oc-
tober with over 2 million tweets on November 15, the day the 
police broke up the New York City camp (Preston 2011). Live 
broadcasting using the site Livestream.com and other plat-
forms also helped protesters share the story live, and more than 
200 Occupy channels on video-streaming sites evolved over 
time (Preston 2011). 
 Researchers who studied this phenomenon using 600,000 
tweets during a 36-week period found that communication 
about Occupy Wall Street had a “highly localized geospa-
tial structure,” where many of the tweets were created and 
consumed by users in the same state (Conover et al. 2013). 
Th ey found that a high percentage of tweets were related to 
resource mobilization, which, in the case of Occupy Wall 

 
Profiles 
191
Street, were tangible resources such as food and tents, increas-
ing the need for communication at the local level. Much of 
the traffi  c fl owing within New York, California, and Wash-
ington, D.C., locations of encampments by protestors, de-
scribed protest actions, including place and time. 
 Th e content shared on social media platforms was partic-
ularly helpful to those with a vested interest in tracking the 
spread, tone, and messages of the campaign. Th e posts also pro-
vided information about possible goals of the campaign and its 
supporters. For example, the Republican Congressional Com-
mittee was monitoring social media to demonstrate to voters 
how the movement was comprised of people holding extreme 
views (Goodale 2011). Banks were also particularly interested 
in the campaign, causing Bank of America, for example, to run 
a full-page ad in the  Atlanta Journal-Constitution to share how 
the bank has helped homeowners in Georgia (Goodale 2011). 
ListenLogic, one of many companies collecting and analyzing 
social media communications, found a spike in conversation 
that mentioned bank transfers prior to November 5, the day 
consumers were being advised to transfer their bank accounts 
from large banks and fi nancial institutions to community banks 
and credit unions (Goodale 2011). 
 Th e movement, however, was predicted to be diffi  cult to 
sustain with social media alone and, according to Harvard 
Law School professor Yochai Benkler, requires “actual, on-the-
ground, face-to-face actions, laying your body down for your 
principles—with the ability to capture the images and project 
them to the world” (Preston 2011). 
 People 
 Anderson, Tom (1970– ) 
 At the age of 30 with a graduate degree in fi lm studies, strug-
gling musician Tom Anderson saw a fl yer that promised $20 to 
anyone who responded. Needing money for a trip to Singapore, 
Anderson replied and ended up participating in a focus group 

192 
Social Media 
for XDrive, an online fi le storage company that employed Chris 
DeWolfe as the head of consumer marketing. Th e moderator 
was impressed with Anderson, and he was subsequently off ered 
a job as a copywriter with the company. He planned on work-
ing at XDrive long enough to pay for his Singapore trip, but 
instead his relationship with XDrive and several employees led 
to him becoming the cofounder of one of the most signifi cant 
early social media networking sites (Angwin 2009). 
 Anderson’s background includes dropping out of San 
Pasqual High School in Escondido, California, to play in a 
heavy metal band called Top Hatt. Th e son of an entrepreneur, 
Anderson enjoyed computers while growing up. During the 
time he should have been fi nishing high school, Anderson was 
instead writing a technical book called  Using Crosstalk Mk.4 
 about software that connects computers to other computers or 
services such as CompuServe (Angwin 2009). 
 In 1994, Anderson enrolled in the University of California, 
Berkeley to double major in English and rhetoric. Although 
he edited a poetry and fi ction journal in college, Anderson 
also stayed involved in technology. He wrote reviews for 
GameRevolution.com and discussed video games on Usenet 
newsgroups. When posting on Usenet, Anderson used pseud-
onyms such as Tom Everett (his middle name) and Melissa 
Loeffl  er, the name of a friend (Angwin 2009). After college, 
Anderson played in the rock band Swank and was poised to 
move to Tokyo and then later considered moving to Taiwan. 
He was able to make his dream of moving to Taiwan come 
true, but returned to the United States to pursue a master’s 
degree in critical fi lm studies at the University of California, 
Los Angeles. He completed the two-year program in one year 
and became interested in the pornography industry (Angwin 
2009). He operated an Asian porn site called TeamAsian.com, 
which linked to other content. Click-throughs from the site 
earned Anderson referral fees. 
 Anderson’s stint at XDrive ended when the company laid off  
employees and fi led for bankruptcy in 2001. DeWolfe, along 

 
Profiles 
193
with Anderson and two other former XDrivers, Josh Berman 
and Aber Whitcomb, then started a company called Respon-
seBase, an e-mail marketing company, which later also sold 
e-books and then became a full-fl edged e-commerce business. 
One of the company’s early clients was MySpace.com, which, 
like XDrive, off ered online storage space. When the company 
failed to pay its online hosting bills, DeWolfe snapped up the 
domain name. 
 Launched in 2003, the new MySpace competed with sites 
like Friendster and Xanga and eventually became the largest 
online social network in the world. Anderson helped tap into 
the music community who had become disillusioned with 
Friendster after being targeted for not adhering to profi le regu-
lations and also because of rumors the site would switch to a 
fee-based model. Musicians found a more welcoming commu-
nity on MySpace and persuaded their fans to follow them to 
this new social networking site (boyd 2006). 
 For all MySpace members, Anderson was automatically as-
signed to be their fi rst MySpace friend. Th roughout his years 
with MySpace, Anderson used the same profi le photo, which 
is now considered iconic, showing him wearing a white T-shirt 
positioned in front of a whiteboard covered with writing. 
 In 2005, Anderson and DeWolfe sold MySpace and the par-
ent company Intermix to Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp for 
$580 million. Anderson served as president of MySpace right 
after the sale and stayed on with the MySpace team until 2009, 
later serving in an advisory role (J. T. Miller 2014). 
 Unlike other social media entrepreneurs, Anderson has not 
been actively involved in launching or funding other start-ups. 
He has, however, kept some involvement by serving as an ad-
viser to online gambling site RocketFrog, a role he has held since 
2012 (Chang 2014). Anderson has stepped away from running 
a social media platform, but does use social media for his current 
passion. At Burning Man 2011, Anderson became interested in 
photography and worked with a friend, professional photog-
rapher Trey Ratcliff , to develop his skills (J. T. Miller 2014). 

194 
Social Media 
Anderson now travels the world shooting landscapes and posts 
to Instagram under the profi le name myspacetom. 
 Anderson said in an interview with ABC News that most 
people would not have expected him to become a social media 
pioneer. In the interview, he stated, “If you knew me before 
MySpace, you’d probably thought I’d have been a scholar 
teaching philosophy in a university my whole life. If you met 
me before college, you’d probably have thought I’d be a musi-
cian for my entire life . . . I like change” (J. T. Miller 2014). 
 Armstrong, Heather B. (1975– ) 
 After launching her blog Dooce in 2001, Heather Arm-
strong grew her readership to the point that she was called 
“Th e Queen of the Mommy Bloggers” by the  New York Times 
in 2011 (Belkin 2011). She ranks among the fi rst and most 
prominent bloggers in this now-competitive arena of mommy 
blogs. Dooce, however, began as a way for Armstrong to rant 
about coworkers and discuss her disassociation with her Mor-
mon faith and family. Th e name of her blog came from an 
AOL Instant Messenger spelling of “doode” for “dude,” which 
Armstrong had misspelled as “dooce” on many occasions 
(Khazan 2015). When Armstrong started blogging, she was a 
25-year-old single woman, and just three years later in 2004, 
she was married with a young child and able to make blogging 
her full-time job. Her husband also quit his job to manage 
the business side of the blog. By 2011, she had 100,000 daily 
views and was raking in hundreds of thousands of dollars from 
advertising (Ronan 2015). 
 Raised in Bartlett, Tennessee, as a Mormon, Armstrong 
graduated as the valedictorian of her high school class and then 
studied English at Brigham Young University, graduating in 
1997 (Armstrong n.d.). Th e day she graduated from college 
marked the day she also left the Mormon Church. Her profes-
sional career began as a Web designer in Los Angeles. After 
launching her blog, Armstrong was fi red from her job a year 
later for talking about coworkers online (Armstrong n.d.).

 As a blogger, Armstrong has written much about her life, 
including a chronicle of moving in with her boyfriend, her sub-
sequent marriage, and their two kids. She has also shared less 
fl attering aspects of her life, including time spent in the hospi-
tal suff ering from postpartum depression after the birth of their 
fi rst child. She chose not to, however, write about the separa-
tion and eventual divorce from her husband, starting a new 
relationship, and raising kids as a single mom (Ronan 2015). 
 Armstrong is not only the author of Dooce, but also a num-
ber of books about her life including  It Sucked and Th en I Cried: 
How I had a Baby, a Breakdown, and a Much Needed Margarita 
in 2008,  Th ings I Learned about My Dad in Th erapy in 2009, 
and  Dear Daughter: Th e Best of the Dear Leta Letters in 2012. 
 Like many bloggers, the daily expectation of posting as well 
as the desire from readers for personal details took its toll on 
Armstrong. In April 2015, Armstrong admitted that she had 
taken up some other projects, including public speaking and 
brand consulting, which “provided a much needed distrac-
tion from . . . a dangerous level of exhaustion and dissatisfac-
tion” (Khazan 2015). Although Dooce is still an active blog, 
Armstrong is no longer publishing on a daily basis nor is she 
exclusively posting about being a mom and details about the 
lives of her children, as they have gotten older. Recent topics 
include training for a marathon, books, her pets, and home 
organization. 
 In addition to the personal strain of maintaining a popu-
lar blog, the business model of Dooce and other blogs that 
relied on banner ads started to implode with the rise of na-
tive advertising. Today’s click-through rates on banner ads is 
approximately 0.1 percent, driving down advertising revenues 
for sites and blogs that sell banner ads (Khazan 2015). Native 
ads appear on Facebook and Twitter feeds and are a popular 
form of online advertising used by marketers today because 
they attract more attention. Also, because of higher views, the 
revenues generated are greater. Some bloggers have combated 
the decline of revenue from banner ads by creating sponsored 

196 
Social Media 
content, which, in Armstrong’s case, would involve Armstrong 
and her family using free products provided by companies and 
writing promotional blog posts about their experiences. Al-
though sponsored content might work well for travel, food, or 
fashion bloggers, Armstrong felt her blog was too personal to 
involve herself and her family (Khazan 2015). 
 boyd, danah (1977– ) 
 danah boyd (lowercase intentional) is a social media scholar and 
activist who has focused on how youth incorporate social media 
into their lives. As Internet scholar Clay Shirky noted about 
boyd in a  New York Times  interview, “Th e single most important 
thing about Danah is that she’s the fi rst anthropologist we’ve got 
who comes from the tribe she’s studying” (Paul 2012). 
 boyd chooses to present her name in lowercase as a nod to 
her mother’s desire for a visually balanced name (i.e., danah 
is more balanced than dana) and also as a political statement 
against the convention of capitalization. As boyd described on 
her website, “it’s my name and i should be able to frame it as 
i see fi t, as my adjective, not someone else’s” (boyd n.d.). 
 boyd’s childhood was spent in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, 
where she was raised by a single mother. She had little contact 
with her father after her parents divorced when boyd was fi ve 
years old (Paul 2012). Her high school years were fi lled with 
many activities and extra-curriculars including marching band, 
literary magazine, theater, Model United Nations, volunteer-
ing, and athletics. It was boyd’s brother who fi rst introduced 
her to Internet Relay Chat and Usenet, which she started using 
during her junior year to discuss her teenage issues with strang-
ers she met online. She also created her fi rst website in high 
school, which still remains online as an Ani DiFranco lyrics 
page. She graduated as co-valedictorian of Manheim Township 
High School and then enrolled in college at Brown University 
where she studied computer science. 
 boyd’s academic credentials include a PhD from the School 
of Information at the University of California, Berkeley. Her

197
dissertation research was funded through a MacArthur Foun-
dation Initiative on New Media and Learning (boyd n.d.). Her 
dissertation, titled “Taken Out of Context: American Teen 
Sociality in Networked Publics,” was a two-and-a-half-year-
ethnography of how teenagers engage with social media sites 
and the practices of self-presentation, peer sociality, and nego-
tiating adult society. boyd also has a master’s degree from MIT 
where she studied with the Media Lab’s Sociable Media Group. 
 boyd is currently a principal researcher at Microsoft Re-
search and a research assistant professor at New York Univer-
sity’s Interactive Telecommunications Program (boyd n.d.). 
boyd was also selected as a 2011 Young Global Leader of the 
World Economic Forum and remains an active member. In 
2011, boyd, along with Berkman Center director John Palfrey, 
was invited to serve as a research fellow for Lady Gaga’s Born 
Th is Way Foundation (Paul 2012). In an eff ort to advise the 
organization, Palfrey and boyd developed a working paper se-
ries to summarize existing research and provide useful advice. 
Th ese papers deal with such topics as youth bullying preven-
tion and anti-bullying legislation. For eight years, boyd also 
served as a Fellow for Harvard University’s Berkman Center for 
Internet and Society. 
 boyd is the author of  It’s Complicated: Th e Social Lives of Net-
worked Teens  and a coauthor of  Hanging Out, Messing Around, 
and Geeking Out: Kids Living and Learning with New Media 
and  Participatory Culture in a Networked Era . In  It’s Compli-
cated , boyd addresses how youth live in a virtual world with 
conversations conducted through texts, relationship drama 
playing out on Facebook, and hanging out managed through 
Skype (Quart 2014). She also explores the concerns of parents 
over their teenagers becoming “screenagers.” Her published 
papers cover not only youth social media topics such as teen 
drama, but also privacy, digital backchannels, and social visual-
ization design (boyd n.d.). 
 In recent years, boyd has explored the implications of 
“big data,” particularly with respect to privacy and publicity, 

198 
Social Media 
misinterpretation of data, and civil rights (boyd n.d.). Her inter-
ests have led her to launch the research institute Data & Society, 
which focuses “on the social and cultural issues arising from 
data-centric technological development” (Data & Society n.d.). 
 Dorsey, Jack (1976– ) 
 Jack Dorsey, cofounder of Twitter, was born into a working-
class family in St. Louis, Missouri, to a father who worked in a 
service department of a mass spectrometer company and a home-
maker mother (Max 2013). In his room as a child, Dorsey had 
a CB radio and a police scanner and later an IBM PC and then 
a Macintosh. In his youth, he enjoyed participating in Internet 
Relay Chat and trading code with other programmers. At the 
age of 14, Dorsey developed a dispatch routing software program, 
a product still used by taxi companies today (Leonard 2009). 
 Dorsey attended the University of Missouri at Rolla but left 
for New York City to work as a programmer for a taxi and 
courier dispatch service (Max 2013). He enrolled and then 
dropped out of New York University a semester short of gradu-
ating to move to San Francisco to start his own dispatch service 
using the Internet in 2000. He bounced between cities and 
other jobs, but returned to San Francisco. At one point, Dorsey 
decided to get his massage therapy license so that he could start 
a business doing massage therapy for programmers and, as a 
programmer himself, also help them through their coding is-
sues (Bercovici 2013b). While working as a programmer for an 
Alcatraz tour company in 2005, Dorsey noticed Evan Williams 
in a coff ee shop. At the time, Williams was known for selling 
a company to Google. Dorsey had been pursuing a shoe sales 
job at Camper, but decided fortuitously to send his résumé to 
Williams. 
 Williams was indeed interested and invited Dorsey to join 
a podcasting platform start-up called Odeo as a programmer. 
Dorsey had an interest in creating a communication service 
that updated people without needing access to a computer. 
Furthermore, he had the idea of sharing “status,” or what the 
user was doing right then.

 From a company brainstorming session, the idea for a short 
message service for internal communication emerged, a project 
initially called twttr (Carlson 2011). Th e fi rst message on the 
site was posted by Dorsey, who tweeted on March 21, 2006, 
that he was “just setting up my twttr.” His Twitter handle, 
@Jack, was the twelfth created at the company, but only because 
the fi rst eleven were tests (Max 2013). When a domain name 
was purchased, the site became Twitter. Debate has swirled 
about the founding of Twitter, but “Everyone agrees that origi-
nal inkling for Twitter sprang from Jack Dorsey’s mind. Dorsey 
even has drawings of something that looks like Twitter that he 
made years before he joined Odeo. And Jack was obviously 
central to the Twitter team” (Carlson 2011). 
 Dorsey became the fi rst CEO of Twitter, but created prob-
lems by apparently “spending a considerable amount of time 
going to hot-yoga classes and taking sewing lessons” and not 
giving enough attention to the fl edging company (Bilton 
2016). After his ousting just one and a half years into his ten-
ure, Dorsey was replaced by fellow founder Evan Williams, 
but remained with Twitter as chairman of the board, later be-
coming executive chairman in 2011 (Indvik 2011). With the 
encouragement of Dorsey, Twitter acquired Vine in 2014, a 
social network where users post six-second videos, and Peri-
scope in early 2015, a live-broadcasting service (Malik 2015). 
In October 2015, Twitter announced that Dorsey would re-
turn as CEO with the hope of making signifi cant changes to 
this important, but struggling, social media platform (Malik 
2015). After having Dorsey in place as CEO for a few months, 
user growth was fl at, the stock price was down 60 percent 
since the previous CEO had been in place, and the company’s 
market valuation had dropped from $40 billion to about 
$20 billion (Bilton 2016). 
 Between the years of serving as CEO of Twitter, Dorsey 
launched Square in 2010, a system that allows any retailer to 
process credit card payments using a mobile device and a credit 
card reader (Indvik 2011). In addition to serving as the CEO 
of Twitter, Dorsey remains the CEO of Square. Th e Twitter 

200 
Social Media 
board had asked him to resign as the CEO of Square, but 
Dorsey refused (Bilton 2016). Dorsey’s annual salary at Square 
is a mere $2.75, a small but signifi cant amount that refers to 
the percentage that Square charges merchants per credit card 
swipe. Dorsey also does not receive a consequential salary 
at Twitter, but his shares in both companies are worth over 
$1 billion (Rao 2016). 
 Fake, Caterina (1969– ) 
 Caterina Fake represents an early social media entrepreneur and 
one of the few women entrepreneurs discussed in this chapter. 
All the platforms launched by Fake share a common thread—
they combine art, technology, and community. Along with her 
then-husband Stewart Butterfi eld, Fake founded photo-sharing 
site Flickr in 2004 through their company Ludicorp. In an 
interview with  Biz Journals , Fake explained the perfect timing 
of Flickr. She said, “When we started, more than 50 percent 
of houses had broadband. People had phones with cameras. 
People were familiar with putting pictures online. It was a fast-
moving train all at once” (Portillo 2014). Just one year later, 
the site was acquired by Yahoo for an estimated $35 million, 
according to experts (Portillo 2014). 
 Prior to Flickr, Fake and her company Ludicorp had devel-
oped the massively multiplayer online game called Game Nev-
erending. Th e game was available on the Web from 2002 to 
2004. Th e tools they built for Game Neverending then evolved 
into Flickr. Prior to that, Fake was involved in the Web through 
her early participation in online discussion board Th e WELL 
(Th e Whole Earth ’Lectronic Link) and she was also a commu-
nity manager for Netscape communities. She started blogging 
in 1998 and was a part of a small community of bloggers at 
the time (Portillo 2014). Other jobs before Ludicorp included 
working as a temp designing CD-ROM education titles in the 
IT department at Columbia University, a position with the 
Web development company Organic, and a stint as an art 
director at Salon.com (Larson 2014).

 After Flickr was sold, Fake spent a few years with Yahoo 
where she launched Yahoo! Answers and the idea incubator 
Brickhouse. Fake’s next venture was cofounding Hunch, which 
used collective intelligence to build a taste graph to map peo-
ple’s preferences based on their answers to a range of questions. 
Th e tool then off ered suggestions, based on a “hunch” that the 
user would like the recommendation. Like with Flickr, this 
platform was quickly acquired by a larger company, this time 
by eBay for a reported $80 million (Portillo 2014). 
 In recent years, Fake has used her vast wealth to be an angel 
investor in such companies as Kickstarter and Etsy. Addition-
ally, she served on the Etsy board as chairwoman for fi ve years. 
In the early days of her involvement with Etsy, she helped the 
company with day-to-day operations and closing their fi rst 
round of funding (Bilton 2010). 
 With $9.5 million in funding, Fake launched Findery in 2014, 
an app with the slogan “where every place has a story.” Th rough 
the app, users can share notes and photos on a world map. Some 
of the platform’s strengths are the hidden gems and personal sto-
ries that are available to travelers (Portillo 2014). In addition to 
being the founder, Fake also serves as CEO of the company. 
 Born in Pittsburgh, Fake’s background includes an early in-
terest in writing and art. In college at Smith and then Vassar, 
she majored in English and then worked as a fi ne artist in New 
York City. After moving to San Francisco in 1995, she applied 
her art skills to a career as a Web designer and programmer. 
She taught herself HTML and began building websites (Bilton 
2010). Fake’s many honors include an appearance on the list 
of  Time magazine’s 100 Most Infl uential People in the World 
in 2006 and honorary doctorates from the New School and 
Rhode Island School of Design. 
 Hoﬀ man, Reid (1967– ) 
 Reid Hoff man,   founder of LinkedIn, is a Stanford graduate 
with strong ties to the Silicon Valley area since birth. He was 
born at Stanford Hospital in Palo Alto, raised by two lawyer 

202 
Social Media 
parents who separated early in their marriage, and attended 
middle school and then a private high school in Berkeley be-
fore transferring to the Putney School, a boarding school in 
Vermont (Lemann 2015). At the age of nine, Hoff man delved 
into fantasy role-playing games, particularly Dungeons & 
Dragons. After learning that the company that published Dun-
geons & Dragons, Chaosium, had a nearby offi  ce, Hoff man 
joined a group of boys who tested products and later, wrote 
game reviews for a gaming magazine published by the com-
pany (Lemann 2015). After graduating from high school in 
1985, Hoff man enrolled in Stanford to study symbolic systems, 
a major that integrated philosophy, linguistics, psychology, and 
computer science. He met his future wife, Michelle Yee, dur-
ing his freshman year, and also became friends with classmate 
Peter Th iel, who would later play a pivotal role in Hoff man’s 
career. Both Th iel and Hoff man served on the student senate 
(Lemann 2015). 
 Post-Stanford, Hoff man earned a master’s degree in philos-
ophy at Oxford on a Marshall scholarship to prepare for an 
academic career. Hoff man then abruptly switched course and 
returned to Silicon Valley with the idea of starting a software 
company (Lee 2009). Th rough a personal connection, Hoff -
man landed a job at Apple with the intention of learning how 
to launch a start-up. While at Apple, he worked on the online 
service eWorld. After learning software development at Apple, 
he moved on to Fujitsu to develop skills in product manage-
ment and business operations, focusing on the virtual chat 
community WorldsAway (Lemann 2015). In 1997, Hoff man 
launched SocialNet, which focused mostly on online dating, 
but also helped others connect. Th e start-up was able to at-
tract funding from venture capitalists, but the business model 
that involved partnering with newspapers was not sustainable 
(Lee 2009). Hoff man’s departure from SocialNet was followed 
by an off er from hedge fund owners Peter Th iel and Max 
Levchin to join them at their start-up, PayPal. While serving 
as executive vice president of business development at PayPal,

203
Hoff man gained a greater understanding of “how the world of 
work was changing” (Lee 2009). 
 PayPal was sold to eBay in 2002, which gave Hoff man the 
opportunity and funding to work full-time on his next con-
cept, LinkedIn, a social networking platform for professionals 
to connect to one another as well as job openings. Th e platform 
for LinkedIn was built using a patent for constructing social 
networks purchased from Six Degrees by Hoff man and Mark 
Pincus, cofounder of Zynga, for $700,000 (Lemann 2015). 
Around this time, Hoff man also connected Th iel and Mark 
Zuckerberg, leading to Th iel’s investment in Facebook. Hoff -
man and Pincus each purchased 0.5 percent of Facebook for 
$37,500 (Lemann 2015). 
 Hoff man’s initial goal with LinkedIn was to fi rst engage 
1 million users and then fi gure out the business model for the 
company (Lee 2009). For the fi rst two years, LinkedIn had no 
revenues (Lemann 2015). By 2005, having reached the fi rst 
goal, LinkedIn focused on three sources of revenue: job listings, 
subscriptions for enhanced services, and advertising. By 2008, 
Facebook’s membership was approximately three times that of 
LinkedIn and fear set in among LinkedIn employees that Face-
book might attempt to incorporate a professional networking 
feature to compete with LinkedIn, but Hoff man remained stead-
fast that people would want to use diff erent platforms to keep 
their professional and personal lives separate (Lemann 2015). 
 Building growth early on was aided by the ability of users to 
upload their entire e-mail contact list to launch automatic invi-
tations as well as the decision in 2006 to make profi les partially 
public so that they appear at the top of Google search results 
(Lemann 2015). LinkedIn also uses a powerful algorithm to 
make relevant suggestions for connecting. 
 After realizing that LinkedIn needed further product de-
velopment in 2006, Hoff man hired a new CEO, Dan Nye, 
and moved into the product side. Two years later, Deep Nis-
har from Google was hired as vice president of products to 
relieve Hoff man of that responsibility and allow him to return 

204 
Social Media 
as CEO and chair. During the two-year period that Nye had 
served as CEO, membership grew from 9 million to 35 million 
and sales increased 900 percent (Lee 2009). In 2011, shortly 
after surpassing 100 million users, the company went public, 
making Hoff man a billionaire (Lemann 2015). 
 Hoff man and Yee married in 2004 and decided not to have 
children. Although Yee worked as a clinical psychologist, she is 
pursuing a philanthropic project to focus on and often escapes 
from Silicon Valley to attend Buddhist retreats (Lemann 2015). 
Despite his great wealth, Hoff man lives in a four-bedroom 
home and does not own a private plane, although he did recently 
splurge on a Tesla (Lemann 2015). 
 In addition to serving as executive chairman at LinkedIn, 
Hoff man is also a partner in the venture capital fi rm Grey-
lock (Lemann 2015). Hoff man is a regular at events such as 
the annual TED conference, the World Economic Forum, 
international relations conference Bilderberg, and gatherings 
organized by Th iel, Google’s Eric Schmidt, and technology 
guru Tim O’Reilly. Hoff man also organizes his own annual 
conference called Th e Weekend to be Named Later that in-
cludes about 150 power players and their families at a South-
ern California resort (Lemann 2015). He also travels to China 
several times a year, which is the fastest growing market for the 
company (Lemann 2015). Hoff man serves on the boards of 
Airbnb, Edmodo, Xapo, Wrapp, Mozilla, and Kiva. Previous 
board positions include shopkick, Zynga, Six Apart, Vendio, 
and Grassroots. He is also the author of  Th e Start-up of You , 
published in 2012 with Ben Casnocha, and  Th e Alliance: Man-
aging Talent in the Networked Age , published in 2014 also with 
Ben Casnocha and Chris Yeh. Hoff man also enjoys playing the 
popular board game, Settlers of Catan, and created a version 
for friends called Startups of Silicon Valley (Lemann 2015). 
 Hughes, Chris (1983– ) 
 Chris Hughes is not only a social media platform cofounder, 
but also known for contributing his social and digital media 

 
Profiles 
205
expertise to a successful presidential campaign as the director of 
online organizing. As described by Ellen McGirt in  Fast Com-
pany , “Hughes has helped create two of the most successful 
startups in modern history, Facebook and the campaign appa-
ratus that got Barack Obama elected” (McGirt 2009). 
 Hughes’s early life was spent in Hickory, North Carolina, 
and he was raised as the only son of a paper salesman and a 
former public school teacher. He applied on his own to board-
ing schools, and after receiving a generous fi nancial aid package 
from Phillips Academy, enrolled in the Andover, Massachu-
setts, school (McGirt 2009). Hughes then attended Harvard 
on scholarship where he met Mark Zuckerberg. Hughes’s early 
role on the Facebook team was not writing code like Zuck-
erberg and fellow cofounder Dustin Moskovitz, but instead 
making suggestions about the functionality of the site as well 
as opening Facebook to other schools, although Hughes ini-
tially argued that each school should have a separate network 
(McGirt 2009). After spending part of the summer in Palo Alto 
after his sophomore year, Hughes, unlike the others, returned 
to Harvard to fi nish his double major in history and French 
literature, study abroad for a semester in Paris, and write a the-
sis on urban space in Algiers (McGirt 2009). He continued, 
however, working with the Facebook team, and returned to 
Palo Alto after graduation. 
 Hughes’s work for Facebook bridged his interest in politics 
when Facebook started off ering profi le pages to political candi-
dates for midterm elections in 2006, long before fan pages were 
available to celebrities and brands (McGirt 2009). Although 
then-senator Barack Obama was not a midterm candidate at 
that time, he was still interested in having a Facebook page, 
and it was Hughes who provided the customer service. Soon 
afterward, Hughes was invited to join the Obama presidential 
campaign as the third member of the new media team. 
 For the Obama campaign, Hughes “helped develop the 
most robust set of Web-based social-networking tools ever 
used in a political campaign, enabling energized citizens to 

206 
Social Media 
turn themselves into activists” (McGirt 2009). Th e digital tool, 
called MyBarackObama.com or MyBO for short, as well as 
the main campaign website went live the same day Obama an-
nounced his candidacy. Approximately 1,000 groups organized 
on the fi rst day of the MyBO launch, nearly crashing the site 
(McGirt 2009). 
 MyBO provided a way for supporters to organize themselves 
into groups, plan events, fund-raise, and target possible sup-
porters. Working with contracted and in-house developers, 
Hughes built a powerful calling and canvassing tool called 
Neighbor-to-Neighbor. Users could fi nd a list of people who 
were undecided or leaning toward Obama who could be called 
or visited. Th e tool integrated data on these potential Obama 
voters to match that of the volunteers as much as possible. 
Neighbor-to-Neighbor is credited with facilitating approxi-
mately 8 million volunteer calls (McGirt 2009). 
 Hughes also led the development of the Vote for Change 
voter registration site. Th e site not only registered 1 million 
people, but also included a strategy to register people in the 
most advantageous state to the campaign. For example, de-
pending on the rules of the states involved, a college student 
may be able to register to vote either in the state where he or 
she attends school or his or her home state. Th e app decided 
which state was more important for the Obama campaign and 
registered the student there (McGirt 2009). 
 By the end of the campaign, using MyBO.com, volunteers 
had created more than 2 million profi les, planned 200,000 
offl  ine events, formed 35,000 groups, and raised $30 million on 
70,000 fund-raising pages (McGirt 2009). After the election, 
Hughes transformed MyBO.com into Organizing for America, 
which became a Democratic National Committee project. 
 In 2012, Hughes purchased a majority stake in the progres-
sive magazine  Th e New Republic , but after a major staff  exodus 
in 2014 and a decline in traffi  c in 2015 of about 40 percent, 
he sold the magazine in early 2016 (Byers 2016). Hughes had 
purchased the magazine for an undisclosed sum, which sources 

 
Profiles 
207
have indicated to be about $2.1 million and then invested 
about $20 million to transform it into a digital media company 
(Byers 2016). According to  Forbes  in 2016, Hughes is worth 
$430 million and was listed as number 28 on the list of richest 
American entrepreneurs under age 40 (Kroll 2016). 
 Karp, David (1986– ) 
 David Karp, founder of the microblogging platform Tumblr, 
was once a tech-obsessed teenager who taught himself to code 
at age 11. Karp’s parents noticed he needed more challenge than 
his prestigious New York City high school, Bronx Science, could 
off er and began to look at other ways to engage their son. Karp’s 
mother reached out to Fred Seibert, who was running an anima-
tion production company, and Seibert off ered Karp the oppor-
tunity to stop by the offi  ce. Eventually, Karp decided to home 
school, freeing more time to work for Seibert in an attempt to 
better position himself to gain admission to MIT for computer 
engineering (Bercovici 2013a). Karp also took Japanese lan-
guage lessons at the Japan Society and worked with a math tutor 
to write software for blackjack and poker (Bercovici 2013a). 
 Instead of applying to MIT, however, Karp continued work-
ing as head of product at UrbanBaby, a parenting website. 
While still working for UrbanBaby, Karp’s next venture was 
taking his coding and limited knowledge of Japanese to Tokyo 
when he was just 17 years old with an interest in building ro-
bots (Halliday 2012). Instead, Karp returned with a desire to 
become an entrepreneur as well as a handful of contracts and a 
list of executives to contact (Halliday 2012). After UrbanBaby 
was acquired by CNET, Karp sold his equity and set up the 
development company, Davidville, to which he signed Viacom 
and other major companies as clients (Halliday 2012). One 
of Karp’s projects was tweaking a multiuser blogging platform 
that he had built for Seibert’s company. Th rough Seibert, Karp 
met investor Bijan Sabet of Spark Capital who wanted to invest 
in what would eventually become Tumblr (Bercovici 2013a). 
Th e initial off er of venture capital was deemed by Karp to be 

208 
Social Media 
“too much money with too much pressure” (Bercovici 2013a). 
When reduced to $750,000 with a $3 million valuation, Karp 
fi nally agreed to the investment. 
 At the age of 21 from the bedroom of his mother’s apartment 
in New York City, Karp launched Tumblr (Halliday 2012). At 
the time, Tumblr had just one other employee, Marco Arment, 
who had been recruited through Craigslist. Karp’s initial vision 
for the company was to off er a product that would not require 
additional investment and would not be later bought out. He 
saw Tumblr as a way to attract customers for his consultancy 
business that off ered website services. For a few months, Karp 
was able to keep a foot in both businesses, but then when the 
user base started doubling every few weeks, Karp realized that 
he needed to focus exclusively on Tumblr (Halliday 2012). 
Karp also originally tried to keep the team small, but when 
the user base surged, the company was not prepared to handle 
the resulting engineering issues. Off ers to move the business to 
Silicon Valley poured in, but Karp felt that New York was more 
supportive of start-ups and stayed. 
 Although Karp was reluctant to base Tumblr’s business 
model on advertising, the company eventually off ered pro-
moted posts. After Yahoo purchased Tumblr for $1.1 billion 
in 2013, Karp remained as CEO. Karp has used his wealth to 
invest $500,000 in New York start-up Sherpaa Inc., a company 
that off ers an app that connects employees and physicians, and 
more than $2 million in Superpedestrian Inc., which builds a 
device that can transform a bicycle into a hybrid electric. Karp 
has made other investments in start-ups such as Th irty Labs, 
Elixir, Kitchensurfi ng, and Picturelife (Crunchbase n.d.). He 
has stated in interviews that he does not want to use his wealth 
to be a venture capitalist per se but enjoys supporting the start-
ups of friends (Chernova 2014). 
 Kjellberg, Felix (1983– ) 
 Felix Kjellberg, known online as “PewDiePie,” is the world’s 
biggest YouTube star. He built a large following by creating 
YouTube videos of himself playing video and mobile games.

Instead of merely watching reviews, Kjellberg’s audience has 
the opportunity to view his game-playing experience, hear his 
opinions, and observe his strange but comedic behavior in this 
process. As noted in an article in the  Wall Street Journal , “He 
contorts, screeches, swears, sings and even ‘twerks’ to portray 
his feelings” (Grundberg and Hansegard 2014). 
 Originally from Gothenburg, Sweden, Kjellberg created the 
alter ego PewDiePie in 2009. His fi rst video featured the game 
Minecraft and Kjellberg’s commentary in Swedish, followed 
by several videos with English commentary about fi rst-person 
shooter games, such as Call of Duty (Hernandez 2014). He 
continued to upload what is known as “Let’s Play” videos, where 
viewers watch players engage with a video game and learn from 
the commentary about their strategies. Kjellberg now wields 
enough power to propel a new game to become a success, and 
game producers even give shout-outs to PewDiePie hoping he 
will create a “Let’s Play” video based on their games for his 
channel (Hernandez 2014). 
 Wanting to focus full time on his YouTube channel, Kjell-
berg dropped out of Chalmers University of Technology in 
Sweden where he had been majoring in industrial economics 
and technology management (Gallagher 2013). He worked at 
a hot dog stand to support himself while getting started mak-
ing videos (Regan 2015). 
 Th rough his video channel, Kjellberg has created an empire 
that pulled in revenues of approximately $7.4 million in 2014. 
He has branched out from his initial video game videos to more 
comedic sketches. With more than 43 million subscribers, his 
top 10 most popular videos have more than 30 million views 
each with his most popular exceeding 72 million. In 2012, he 
signed a deal with Maker Studios that manages the produc-
tion of online content, but also takes a percentage of ad sales 
(Grundberg and Hansegard 2014). 
 Kjellberg’s popularity has attracted criticism from both the 
public and the press. A Twitter poll reported by Kotaku found 
that people described PewDiePie with such words as “obnox-
ious waste of time” and “annoying” (Hernandez 2014). An 

210 
Social Media 
article in  Variety magazine attributes Kjellberg’s success to his 
“blathering like a blithering idiot” (Wallenstein 2013). Th e ar-
ticle continued by saying, “Foul-mouthed PewDiePie jabbers 
nonsensically to the fans he calls ‘bros’ primarily about video-
games in a voice that reminds you of a young Bobcat Goldth-
wait between hits of nitrous oxide” (Wallenstein 2013). 
 Kjellberg ranked third behind two YouTube duos in a sur-
vey of 1,500 teens by  Variety about the infl uence of 20 well-
known personalities, a list that included both YouTubers and 
traditional celebrities such as actors and singers (Ault 2014). 
PewDiePie ranked higher than celebrities Jennifer Lawrence, 
Katy Perry, and Johnny Depp. 
 His 2014 online earnings generated controversy for the 
young star when they were released in the Swedish newspaper 
 Expressen and the story went viral (Regan 2015). He shared in 
a video how “It seems like the whole world cares more about 
how much money I make than I do myself.” He further ex-
plained that “Th ey [the critics] thought I just sit on my ass all 
day, and I just yell at the screen over here. Which is true! But 
there’s so much more to it than that” (Regan 2015). Kjellberg 
also emphasized that he has given a million dollars of his earn-
ings to charity. 
 Monty, Scott (1970– ) 
 Scott Monty is among the digital pioneers who led social media 
for a major American corporation in the early years of social 
media. In Monty’s case, it was Ford Motor Company. Ford’s 
CEO Alan Mulally once called Monty “a visionary” (Wernle 
2014). He has also been ranked by  Forbes magazine as one of 
the top infl uencers in social media. 
 For almost six years, Monty served as manager of global 
digital and multimedia communications for Ford. In this posi-
tion, he led the company’s social media and digital activities 
including blogger relations, marketing support, customer ser-
vice, and internal communications (Wernle 2014). He utilized 
social media to reach new and existing customers, and under 

 
Profiles 
211
his leadership, Ford was the fi rst company to introduce a car on 
Facebook and the fi rst brand on Google+. For the relaunch of 
the Ford Fiesta, Monty recruited 100 online bloggers and in-
fl uencers, gave them each a car to drive for a year, and encour-
aged them to generate brand content to share through social 
and digital platforms to build awareness of the car (Wernle 
2014). In another campaign for Ford called “Random Acts of 
Fusion,” Monty’s team rewarded Internet conversation about 
the Ford Fusion by surprising users with a car wash, off ering 
critics a test drive, or having comedians create a retweet of their 
tweets (Fera 2013). 
 Measuring the impact of social media on the bottom line is a 
critical task of any social media manager. Monty famously said, 
“What’s the ROI of putting your pants on every day? It’s hard 
to measure but there’s negative consequences for not doing 
it” (Ratcliff  2014). In an interview with Econsultancy, Monty 
clarifi ed that social media requires diff erent measurement tech-
niques than marketing or other communication functions of 
an organization (Ratcliff  2014). It is also diffi  cult to isolate and 
measure social media because they are often tied to advertising 
and public relations eff orts. 
 Under Monty’s leadership, digital and social media at Ford 
became increasingly important to the company’s marketing 
strategy. Even though traditional methods were still being used 
by Ford, the percentage of the marketing budget allocated to-
ward digital and social media was 25 percent in 2011 and has 
been increasing each year since then (Ratcliff  2014). 
 After leaving Ford, Monty became executive vice president 
of strategy for SHIFT Communications. He then founded and 
now serves as CEO for Scott Monty Strategies. In 2016, Monty 
became the CEO and co-managing partner of Brain+Trust 
Partners, an executive consultancy fi rm that focuses on put-
ting humanity into digital communications. As Shel Israel 
wrote about him in  Forbes , “Monty has been one of the poster 
children of making the modern brand—even entrenched, 
iconic brands like Ford—more conversational, personal and 

212 
Social Media 
transparent. Along with other social media pioneers who in-
jected this new thinking into other big brands, he believes the 
real power of this new form of communications lies in listening 
to the views of customers, prospects, partners and competitors” 
(Israel 2014). 
 Monty’s educational background includes three degrees 
from Boston University: a bachelor’s degree in classical civili-
zation, a master’s degree in medical science, and a master’s in 
business administration with a focus on health care manage-
ment. After several early positions in communications, market-
ing, and development in the health care fi eld, Monty entered 
the agency side as an account director for PJA Advertising & 
Marketing, which was followed by a stint with the marketing 
agency Crayon before moving on to Ford. Monty has been 
blogging since the early 2000s, and his current blog can be 
found at scottmonty.com. He also distributes the newsletter 
“Th e Full Monty” and is executive editor and cohost of “I Hear 
of Sherlock Everywhere,” a website and podcast for Sherlock 
Holmes fans. 
 Parker, Sean (1979– ) 
 As one of the youngest people profi led in this chapter to be-
come a technology entrepreneur, Sean Parker cofounded the 
fi le-sharing site Napster in 1999 at the age of 19 (Kirkpatrick 
2010b). With Shawn Fanning, Parker dramatically changed the 
music business through Napster, a peer-to-peer music-sharing 
service. Th e industry as well as several bands and musicians 
responded by suing Napster for copyright infringement, which 
eventually forced the company to close. 
 Growing up, Parker learned to code on an Atari 800 at a 
young age by his oceanographer father. Although described as 
being “painfully cerebral” with an informed opinion on a vari-
ety of topics, Parker barely fi nished high school (Kirkpatrick 
2010b). During high school, he honed his hacking skills by 
tapping into a range of Fortune 500 companies, educational 
institutions, and military and government websites around the 

 
Profiles 
213
world. He was eventually caught by the FBI and sentenced 
to perform community service (Kirkpatrick 2010b). During 
his senior year, he interned as a programmer for Mark Pin-
cus’s D.C. start-up FreeLoader and then Internet service pro-
vider UUNet, receiving high school credits and an income of 
$80,000 (Bertoni 2011). After meeting Fanning and learning 
of his plans to create Napster, Parker decide to forego college 
to move to San Francisco and work on the project. After the 
quick ascent and then downfall of Napster because of legal or-
ders that halted users from illegally downloading copyrighted 
material, Parker was pushed out of the company. 
 Parker has exhibited a strong sense about the direction of 
technology and Facebook’s Zuckerberg has said that “few peo-
ple are as smart as he [Parker] is” (Kirkpatrick 2010b). After 
Napster, Parker cofounded the contact management system 
Plaxo at the age of 21, but was later fi red. After approaching 
Zuckerberg for a meeting in New York City, the two connected 
over dinner there. Parker again met up with Zuckerberg in Palo 
Alto, and he was invited to live in the rented summer home. At 
age 24, Parker became the founding president of Facebook, a 
position he held briefl y, but that association contributed most 
signifi cantly to his net worth, estimated to be $2.4 billion in 
2016 (Kirkpatrick 2010b). 
 In 2006, Parker joined Peter Th iel’s Founders Fund as a 
managing partner. He has also been instrumental in bringing 
digital music service Spotify to the United States. He started 
the Facebook application Causes with Joe Green, who attended 
Harvard with Zuckerberg. A recent venture for Parker is Bri-
gade Media, a social media platform for civic and political en-
gagement. In 2016, Parker cofounded Th e Screening Room, a 
service that would provide movies to viewers at home the same 
day they are released in theaters. Th e pitch involves a $150 
set-top box that provides secure, anti-piracy technology and 
movies that cost $50 to rent (Kosoff march 2016). 
 In 2015, Parker created Th e Parker Foundation and funded 
it with $600 million (Th e Parker Foundation n.d.). Th e mission 

214 
Social Media 
of the foundation is to fund life sciences, global health, and 
civic engagement projects. To date, the foundation has pro-
vided $10 million to create an autoimmunity research lab at 
the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). Before 
setting up the foundation, he had funded malaria research at 
UCSF through a $4.5 million donation and an allergy research 
center to be named the Sean N. Parker Center for Allergy and 
Asthma Research at Stanford University with a $24 million 
donation (Th e Parker Foundation n.d.). 
 As a billionaire, Parker has been living lavishly. Parker and 
his wife Alexandra Lenas were married in 2013 in Big Sur, 
California, in a $4.5 million ceremony that lasted three days. 
All guests were provided with Tolkien-inspired costumes by 
the  Lord of the Rings costume designer to wear during the cer-
emony (Kirkpatrick 2010b). He owns a $20 million West Vil-
lage townhome nicknamed the “Bacchus House” and a $55 
million home in Los Angeles called “Th e Brody House,” which 
was purchased from Ellen DeGeneres (Gross 2011). 
 Pincus, Mark (1966– ) 
 Originally from Chicago, Mark Pincus, cofounder of so-
cial gaming site Zynga, is the son of two professionals, an 
architect mother and a father who was a partner in a mergers-
and-acquisitions fi rm (Grigoriadis 2011). As a child, he was 
competitive at a wide range of games including video games, 
outdoor sports, and board games like Trivial Pursuit and 
Scrabble (Grigoriadis 2011). Pincus earned an undergradu-
ate business degree from the Wharton School at the Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania and an MBA from Harvard Business 
School. Between college and graduate school, Pincus worked 
at Lazard Frères as a member of the bank’s fi rst program 
for postcollege grads and also at Asian Capital Partners 
(Takahashi 2011). After graduate school, he did not land a 
job immediately because, as he claimed, “I just didn’t have 
a lot of respect for authority” (Grigoriadis 2011). After de-
ciding that he should change his career path from fi nance to 
media, he worked for cable company TCI where he wrote 

 
Profiles 
215
business plans for the Auto Channel and TV Guide Onscreen 
and also conceptualized the Disaster Channel. Pincus’s next 
position was with a Washington, D.C., venture capital fi rm, 
from which he was fi red (Grigoriadis 2011). 
 Prior to founding Zynga, Mark Pincus was a three-time 
entrepreneur. His fi rst company was FreeLoader, a Web-based 
push technology service, which he sold for $38 million. Pincus 
described during a talk at Berkeley that he received a “small 
share of the total” (Cutler 2009). Th e sale was one of the fi rst 
for big Web companies and earned Pincus some recognition 
in the tech industry (Grigoriadis 2011). After moving to San 
Francisco, he launched another start-up called Support.com 
to provide online tech support, which he described as a “service 
that nobody wanted” (Cutler 2009). When the company 
went public in 2000, an industry source estimated that Pin-
cus earned $30 million from the deal (Grigoriadis 2011). In 
2003, Pincus founded Tribe Networks, which operates the 
social networking website Tribe.net. Unfortunately for Tribe, 
some attendees of the annual Burning Man festival held in 
the Nevada desert eventually gravitated to the site and up-
loaded photos of themselves naked, off ending and driving 
away users (Grigoriadis 2011). 
 Despite earning millions from these projects, Pincus described 
feeling like a failure as an entrepreneur (Grigoriadis 2011). He 
attended retreats by motivational coach Tony Robbins and 
started working with a life coach whose clients included other 
Internet entrepreneurs. Pincus so enjoyed the benefi ts of work-
ing with coaches that he also hired tennis and yoga coaches, as 
well as a skiing coach during his birthday week. According to 
Pincus, the coaching paid off  because it helped him see gaming 
in a diff erent way (Grigoriadis 2011). He learned through his 
coaches that by spending money on a game, a player can com-
pete at a higher level. 
 Zynga soared to popularity as one of the fi rst companies to 
allow friends to play games against one another on a social plat-
form, which was Facebook in Zynga’s case (Wingfi eld 2016). 
Th e games require a monetary investment to be successful 

216 
Social Media 
(Grigoriadis 2011). Eventually, people grew annoyed with the 
dominance of social gaming content in their feeds, and Face-
book made changes that made it more diffi  cult for games and 
other apps to solicit users. Facebook also insisted that Zynga 
use Facebook Credits for currency, which would give Facebook 
a 30 percent share of revenues. Th is move caused Pincus to 
threaten to pull Zynga’s games from Facebook, but after Pincus 
and Mark Zuckerberg discussed the situation, they were able 
to work out a deal. Zynga also missed the opportunity to seam-
lessly move onto mobile devices, which is where games like 
Candy Crush and Clash of Clans thrived. 
 Pincus has been described as a micromanager who has a dif-
fi cult time delegating or empowering his team (Lynley 2015). 
Also known for his analytical savvy, Pincus may have helped 
drive a strong initial public off ering for Zynga. His leadership 
style, however, was criticized by investors. During “greenlight” 
meetings used to determine the games that would move for-
ward into full development, Pincus was notorious for grilling 
his team about the monetization strategy of each game and 
how to engineer the game’s virality (Lynley 2015). Insiders 
claimed this approach hampered creativity within the com-
pany. A video of Pincus talking about all the ways the company 
would exploit users to increase revenues circulated throughout 
the tech industry and created controversy for the Zynga leader 
(Grigoriadis 2011). 
 Before Zynga went public at a $7 billion valuation, Pincus’s 
fortune was estimated to be $2 billion, but his net worth took 
a dive to around $1 billion upon the company going public 
in 2011 (Mac 2013a). Th roughout the spring of 2012, stock 
prices rallied and reached a high of $14.69 in March. Th en, 
after Pincus sold 16.5 million shares, which totaled about 
16 percent of his stock in the company, investor confi dence 
drove the stock price down and the company never recovered 
(Mac 2013a). At the time of the sale, other employees were re-
quired to hold onto their shares, and Pincus’s actions damaged 
their ability to sell at a favorable price.

217
 Pincus announced in 2013 that he was stepping down from 
his position as CEO of Zynga and would be replaced by former 
Xbox executive Don Mattrick. Pincus, however, remained with 
the company as chief product offi  cer and chairman of the board, 
two positions he was already holding. At some point, he did 
step away from day-to-day company operations, but still had an 
offi  ce at Zynga and indicated his support for the future of the 
company. In an internal memo to employees, he said, “I remain 
Zynga’s largest shareholder and biggest believer” (Lynley 2014). 
 While Pincus was away from Zynga, he focused on invest-
ing. He had previously been an early investor in such successful 
social media platforms as Facebook and Twitter, and during 
this period, he is reported to have also invested in Dropbox 
(Lynley 2014). Sources also claimed that he attempted to be 
an investor in the app Secret, but was turned down along with 
other potential investors (Lynley 2014). In 2014, he started a 
new company that resembled both a start-up and an incubator 
called Superlabs. With his own funding, he supported work 
on digital projects that he had been considering since leaving 
Zynga (Swisher 2014). 
 In 2015, Zynga announced that Pincus would return to once 
again serve as CEO, news that caused an 18 percent drop in the 
company’s stock price (Lynley 2015). An initiative of Pincus 
at the time was to make the company more data-driven and 
become known for its analytics. Pincus stepped down less than 
a year later as CEO to become executive chairman and was 
replaced by board member Frank Gibeau (Wingfi eld 2016). 
 On a personal note, Pincus and his wife, Alison, purchased 
a $16 million home in the prestigious Presidio district of San 
Francisco in 2012 (Schuker 2012). Alison, also a digital entre-
preneur, is the cofounder of One Kings Lane, a fl ash site for 
home accessories and furniture. 
 Rose, Kevin (1977– ) 
 Kevin Rose has been described as having “a way of creating 
amazing products and then neglecting them” (Lynley 2012). 

218 
Social Media 
Along with partners Owen Byrne, Ron Gorodetzky, and Jay 
Adelson, Rose founded the social news site Digg in 2004 with 
a $6,000 investment. Th e concept of the site was that users 
would share news stories that would become more or less 
prominent by user votes to “digg up” or “bury” content. 
 With a self-diagnosed case of attention defi cit disorder as 
well as mild dyslexia, Rose was not a young overachiever like 
several other prominent social media entrepreneurs (Chafkin 
2013). He was raised in a lower middle-class family in Las 
Vegas by an insurance salesman father and a mother who did 
nails. He learned some programming in middle school, but 
overall, he struggled in school with both his studies and girls 
(Chafkin 2013). His secondary education included computer 
science night classes at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, 
and employment as a technician at a nuclear test site. In 2002, 
he moved to San Francisco for a production assistant job with 
the cable network TechTV. He quickly moved on air as the 
“resident hacker” and then a host (Chafkin 2013). 
 Rose met Adelson in the late 1990s when Adelson was inter-
viewed by TechTV for a segment about one of his companies 
(Lynley 2012). Rose was inspired by Adelson’s entrepreneurial 
spirit, and Adelson was interested in video production. It was 
Rose who fi rst suggested a site that would “democratize the 
news,” and with Adelson’s mentoring, Rose built a prototype 
(Lynley 2012). Adelson then offi  cially joined the team, and 
Byrne was added to write the code for Digg. 
 In 2007, after hackers cracked the code for HD-DVD, mak-
ing it possible to copy and illegally distribute HD-DVDs, a 
Digg post instructed users how they could do this themselves. 
After Digg removed the initial post to avoid legal problems, 
community members continued to repost and also comment 
on the situation. Rose sided with the community, saying on 
his blog, “But now, after seeing hundreds of stories and reading 
thousands of comments, you’ve made it clear. You’d rather see 
Digg go down fi ghting than bow down to a bigger company. 
We hear you, and eff ective immediately we won’t delete stories

or comments containing the code and will deal with whatever 
the consequences might be” (Marcus 2010). 
 When TechTV was sold and then folded into another 
channel, Rose, Adelson, and several others including former 
TechTV employees cofounded Revision3. A video podcast 
called Diggnation by Rose and Alex Albrecht launched in 2005 
on the site, which further helped to promote the Digg brand by 
featuring popular stories shared on Digg (Marcus 2010). Ac-
cording to the website, Revision3 provides “all-original weekly 
and daily episodic community driven programs watched by a 
super committed, passionate fan base.” Rose currently off ers 
a series on the site called “Foundation,” where he interviews 
entrepreneurs. In 2012, Discovery Communications acquired 
Revision3. Rose also cofounded the microblogging site Pow-
nce in 2007, which was purchased and closed by Six Apart in 
2008. His involvement in side projects like Pownce angered 
the board, who felt that because Digg’s designer, Daniel Burka, 
was working on Pownce, it was a Digg product and that any 
success of Pownce should benefi t Digg shareholders (Lynley 
2012). Rose unveiled at the SXSW conference in 2009 another 
side project, WeFollow, a Twitter directory. 
 During the early years, off ers to purchase Digg included a 
$200 million off er by Google and a $60 million off er from 
News Corp (Lynley 2012). In 2006, the Digg board enter-
tained and then turned down the off er from News Corp in 
a deal that would have earned Rose $36 million at the age of 29 
(Lynley 2012). Google’s deal was off  the table when they looked 
into Digg’s technology and caliber of the technical team and 
determined it had faults (Lynley 2012). In 2010, after decid-
ing to become more involved in Digg after being distracted 
by other projects, Rose fi red Adelson as CEO. Rose then be-
came CEO of Digg and committed himself full time to the 
company. His tenure lasted only six months until Matt Wil-
liams joined Digg from Amazon as CEO. Rose fi nally left Digg 
in early 2011. Digg was sold to Betaworks in 2012 for a mere 
$500,000 with some additional equity. Some of the company’s 

220 
Social Media 
patents were sold to LinkedIn for $4 million and the engineer-
ing team was acquired by a Washington Post Co. subsidiary for 
$12 million (Lynley 2012). 
 Since Digg, Rose cofounded the company Milk in 2011, an 
app workshop company. Th e company’s fi rst product was a re-
view application called Oink (Lynley 2012). Rose and his team 
clashed when the team wanted to continue working on Oink 
and launch a second version, but Rose was more interested in 
pursuing new ideas. With only $1.1 million in funding and 
a large team, the company could not agree on its direction, 
and Milk was acquired by Google (Konrad 2015). Rose then 
joined the Google team and was investing for Google Ventures. 
In 2015, Rose scaled back his time commitment to Google to 
focus on North Technologies, a consumer app workshop. Th e 
fi rst two projects of North were Tiiny, a photo-sharing app. and 
then Watchville, a platform for watch collectors. Although nei-
ther project gained traction, Rose received $5 million in seed 
funding from investors, but then closed in 2015 after being in 
existence for less than a year. 
 As an angel investor in other social media platforms in their 
early stages, Rose has been quite successful. His investments in-
clude Twitter, Square, Fab, Facebook, Path, and Zynga. Other 
less familiar companies have also been good investments, in-
cluding Chomp, which was acquired by Apple for $50 million; 
OMGPop, acquired by Zynga for $200 million; and Ngmoco, 
purchased for $400 million by a Japanese gaming company. 
His return on investment in these companies is estimated to be 
almost 2,200 percent (Chafkin 2013). As of 2015, Rose moved 
to New York City to lead Hodinkee, a watch enthusiast website 
(Green 2016). 
 Sandberg, Sheryl (1969– ) 
 Perhaps the most important and infl uential woman in social 
media is Sheryl Sandberg. Sandberg, who joined Facebook as 
chief operating offi  cer in 2008, had already become a multi-
millionaire through her stock options from Google where she 

 
Profiles 
221
was the vice president of global online sales and operations 
from 2001 to 2008 (Kirkpatrick 2010a). Before Google, she 
worked as chief of staff  to Lawrence Summers when he served 
as secretary of the Treasury during the Clinton administra-
tion. She had met Summers as a student at Harvard major-
ing in economics when she took his class called Public Sector 
Economics. Summers later served as her thesis adviser as she 
explored the relationship between economic inequality and 
spousal abuse. 
 From Google, Sandberg brought her experience in working 
with advertisers to Facebook, which was ambivalent about ad-
vertising as a business model, mainly because of Zuckerberg’s 
objections (Kirkpatrick 2010a). Shortly after joining, Sand-
berg held evening brainstorming sessions to answer the ques-
tion: “What business are we in?” Options included advertising, 
selling user data, selling avatars and other virtual goods, or 
enabling transactions and taking a cut of the fees (Kirkpatrick 
2010a). Th e consensus of the team was that advertising should 
represent 70 percent or more of the company’s revenues. 
Instead of Google’s advertising strategy that fulfi lls a demand 
searched for, Facebook’s would create demand (Kirkpatrick 
2010a). Four years after joining the Facebook, Sandberg 
became the fi rst woman on the company’s board. 
 In 2013, Sandberg’s book  Lean In: Women, Work and the 
Will to Lead  was published, which started a movement among 
women as well as backlash toward Sandberg. Th e book dis-
cusses the challenges faced by women, including those as 
highly accomplished and recruited as Sandberg, in corpo-
rate America. In the book, she outlines a plan for eff ective 
working relationships between women and men to increase 
opportunities for women at the top. Some reviews, however, 
criticized her suggestions as only appropriate for elite profes-
sional women who can negotiate the terms of their employ-
ment and whose supervisors view them as an asset and will 
fi ght to keep them (Gara 2013). Reader backlash contended 
that institutional factors, such as gender discrimination and 

222 
Social Media 
income inequality, cannot be overcome by a woman’s sheer 
motivation or persistence for change (Groner 2014). 
 Born in Washington, D.C., Sandberg moved with her fam-
ily to North Miami Beach, Florida, at the age of two. She is 
the daughter of an ophthalmologist father and a mother who 
gave up her pursuit of a PhD and a position teaching French at 
a college to raise Sandberg and her two younger siblings. Her 
parents founded the South Florida Conference on Soviet Jewry, 
which assisted Soviet Jews immigrating to the United States. 
Sandberg is a product of the public school system and was al-
ways at the top of her class (Auletta 2011). At Harvard, Sand-
berg cofounded the Women in Economics and Government 
club to encourage more women to select these majors. She was 
inducted into Phi Beta Kappa and graduated as the top student 
in the economics department (Auletta 2011). After graduation, 
Sandberg worked for about two years as a research assistant to 
Summers when he was chief economist at the World Bank. 
She returned to Harvard for an MBA and then took a job with 
McKinsey & Company. 
 Sandberg experienced tragedy in her personal life with the 
sudden death of her husband, Dave Goldberg, in 2015 during 
a vacation in Mexico (Goel 2015). At the time, the couple had 
been married more than 10 years and have two children. Like 
Sandberg, Goldberg was also a technology executive, working 
for Yahoo and then later as CEO of SurveyMonkey. Th irty 
days after his passing, Sandberg posted a compelling and heart-
breaking post on Facebook about her husband that went viral 
and received mainstream media attention. Almost a year later, 
the post had 912,000 likes, 73,000 comments, and 400,000 
shares. 
 According to  Forbes , Sandberg’s net worth in December 
2016 was estimated to be $1.27 billion. In 2016, she ranked 
fourteenth on the  Forbes list of America’s Self-Made Women 
and seventh on the Power Women list (Forbes 2016b). At the 
end of 2015, Sandberg donated $31 million of her Facebook 
stock to the Sheryl Sandberg Philanthropy Fund. Th e fund

 Silbermann, Ben (1982– ) 
 Ben Silbermann, cofounder of virtual pinboard Pinterest, is 
an Iowa native who attended a large public high school and 
excelled at cello and competitive debate. During his junior 
year, he was invited to participate in the prestigious Research 
Science Institute, sponsored by MIT and the Department of 
Defense (Chafkin 2012). Inspired by two ophthalmologist 
parents, Silbermann was a pre-med major at Yale before chang-
ing his career goals his junior year to business. During his fi rst 
job with the Corporate Executive Board, a consulting company 
in Washington, D.C., he started reading technology blogs and 
getting excited about the platforms entrepreneurs were build-
ing (Chafkin 2012). He and his girlfriend both quit their cor-
porate jobs and moved to the West Coast. Hired by Google, 
he worked in customer support and also designed products 
such as display ads. Without an engineering background, how-
ever, he felt his career growth there was stifl ed and left in 2008 
(Chafkin 2012). In an interview with All Th ings D, Silbermann 
said, “if Google teaches you anything, it’s that small ideas can 
be big” (Panzarino 2013). After resigning from Google, Silber-
mann collaborated with college friend Paul Sciarra to design 
iPhone apps but had little success (Shontell 2012). Th e team’s 
fi rst project, a shopping app called Tote, generated some seed 
funding but did not gain popular acceptance. It was useful, 
however, in demonstrating to Silbermann that although people 
were not interested in making purchases through the site, they 
did save photos for later viewing (Chafkin 2012). 
 An avid collector as a child, especially of bugs, Silbermann 
recognized there was not a place on the Internet to share collec-
tions. After a conversation with Columbia architecture gradu-
ate student Evan Sharp about infographics and collecting, 
Silbermann shared the idea of a digital collection as a method 

224 
Social Media 
of self-expression (Chafkin 2012). In 2010, Silbermann and 
Sciarra then started working on this new project, which would 
become Pinterest. Sharp joined the team to design and code 
the site, much of which was done while sitting in a Whole 
Foods on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. In an apartment 
in Palo Alto, Silbermann and Sciarra collaborated with a single 
engineer they had added to the team. 
 Silbermann’s strength as an entrepreneur has been credited 
to his “ability to look beyond the sometimes narrow-minded 
world of Internet entrepreneurship” (Chafkin 2012). He rec-
ognized that, unlike the users of many other social platforms, 
not everyone wanted to be a creator, but rather a curator of 
content created by others. He also resisted the popular feature 
of many other platforms to add an element of gamifi cation to 
the site, where users compete to be on leaderboards or earn 
badges. 
 Pinterest was off  to a slow start in the early days. After nine 
months, the platform had fewer than 10,000 users (Shontell 
2012). Th e slow growth may have been attributed to limited 
sign-ups in the beginning. Th e fi rst users were mostly design 
bloggers personally recruited by Silbermann who were each 
given a certain number of invitations to hand out to others 
with good taste. 
 Understanding the importance of loyal users, Silbermann 
personally contacted the fi rst 5,000 users and provided many 
of them his cell phone number to discuss any issue directly 
with him. He attended blogger meet-ups and sent weekly 
e-mails to the community, which he had written himself. 
Despite lack of early success, Silbermann pressed on. He 
explained why in an interview at SXSW, “Th e idea of telling 
everyone we blew it was so embarrassing. I thought, ‘Google 
is never going to take me back—they barely hired me the fi rst 
time!’” (Shontell 2012). 
 Silbermann currently serves as the CEO of Pinterest. A 2012 
interview revealed Silbermann’s work ethic, which includes pre-
dawn checking of e-mail, leaving for the offi  ce at 7 a.m., and 

 
Profiles 
225
working nonstop until dinner. Silbermann expects the same 
commitment and work ethic from employees. To build new 
iPad and Android applications for Pinterest, Silbermann put 
all employees on “lockdown,” which required them to come in 
early and stay late for several weeks. Employees received com-
memorative T-shirts emblazoned with the slogan “Summer of 
Apps.” During this period, Silbermann was also on lockdown 
from all outside contact and did not even respond to business 
opportunities (Chafkin 2012). Th e Summer of Apps proved 
a success, and the iPad app was number one in the App Store 
within a day (Chafkin 2012). 
 Silbermann’s mother has become a Pinterest celebrity of sorts. 
Back in 2012, his mother, Jane Wang, had the largest follower 
count on Pinterest with approximately 3.4 million followers. 
By 2016, she had dropped to fi fth place, but had more than 
doubled her follower count to almost 7.9 million followers. 
 Smith, Marc (1965– ) 
 A sociologist by education,   Marc Smith studies computer-
mediated communication and the organization of online 
communities. His academic credentials include a PhD in soci-
ology from UCLA, a master’s in social theory from Cambridge 
University, and a bachelor’s in international area studies from 
Drexel University. Smith always had a passion for comput-
ers and was interested in interconnections, but not necessarily 
data or statistics. While growing up, Smith was one of the 
fi rst owners of a Radio Shack Tandy TRS-80, an early home 
computer that hit the market in 1977, and he discussed in 
an interview how he realized that programming was not his 
niche, but rather that he was someone who could direct coders 
(De Waal 2010). Smith embraced data visualization as a way 
for people not versed in math and science to gain insights into 
the data. 
 Smith’s research focuses on “the ways group dynamics change 
when they take place in and through social cyberspaces,” par-
ticularly with visualizing, mapping, and measuring the online

Social Media 
groups (Smith n.d.). Smith is the founder and chief social 
scientist of the Connected Action consulting group, which fo-
cuses on applying social science methods and social media net-
work analysis to social media usage. He is also the cofounder of 
the Social Media Research Foundation (SMRF), a group of so-
cial media researchers who work together to create social media 
tools and host open data. Th e primary project of the SMRF is 
NodeXL, an add-on to Excel funded by Microsoft that collects, 
analyzes, and visualizes social networks. NodeXL’s strengths are 
the simplicity and user-friendliness of the interface, “yet at the 
heart of the code is an algorithm with deep maths that deter-
mines how social structures be given a visual identity. Th is en-
ables the creation of reliable visualisations of complex data sets” 
(De Waal 2010). 
 Th e visualizations created by NodeXL show each person in 
the network as a dot, or node, and the connections between 
people as lines, or edges. Th e visualization for a Twitter network, 
for example, will show those who have the most infl uence on 
the conversation through retweets and mentions. In an inter-
view with Smith, he explained how professionals and scholars 
have used NodeXL for a variety of studies, including mapping 
Alexander the Great’s social network, connections between peo-
ple who author patents together, and the six distinct patterns of 
network structures in Twitter networks (Rajpurohit n.d.). 
 Prior to his involvement in Connected Action and SMRF, 
Smith founded and managed the Community Technologies 
Group at Microsoft Research. While at Microsoft, he devel-
oped “Netscan,” which reported on Usenet newsgroups and 
other threaded conversation sites. He then led development of 
social media analytics tools at Telligent Systems as the com-
pany’s chief social scientist (Smith n.d.). Smith’s publications 
include a coedited book with Peter Kollock called  Communities 
in Cyberspace  as well as a coauthored book with Derek Hansen 
and Ben Shneiderman titled  Analyzing Social Media Networks 
with NodeXL: Insights from a Connected World .

 Solis, Brian (1970– ) 
 Brian Solis, a prominent and early thought leader in the area of 
social media, explores and studies how emerging technologies 
impact business and society. He is currently principal analyst at 
Altimeter Group, a company that provides research and strat-
egy consulting on disruptive technology to business leaders. 
Th e company also provides free and independent research to 
the public. In 2015, Altimeter Group was acquired by Prophet, 
but the team and company name remained unchanged. 
 At Altimeter, Solis advises companies on how to design 
digital customer experiences, studies start-up innovation to 
better understand how to disrupt markets, and helps clients 
employ digital technology to connect to various publics, such 
as customers or employees. From 2010 to 2014, Solis ran the 
Pivot Conference as the executive producer and host. Th e con-
ference presented the most disruptive trends in business and 
then helped brand leaders understand how to both appreci-
ate and deal with disruption. Prior to Altimeter, Solis was the 
principal of FutureWorks, a creative digital and social media 
agency where he led programs for Fortune 500 companies, 
celebrities, brands, and technology start-ups (Solis n.d.). In 
his early twenties, Solis launched  Reality Magazine , which was 
a free fashion publication distributed to retail establishments 
and restaurants (Pitzer 1994). Solis served as publisher and 
contributing editor of the magazine. At the time, Solis was 
also working for an advertising agency in Malibu, California, 
and taking classes at Pierce College, a two-year public institu-
tion in Woodland Hills. 
 Solis is a prolifi c author of books about digital disruption 
including  X: Th e Experience When Business Meets Design ,  What’s 
the Future of Business (WTF) ,  Th e End of Business as Usual , and 
 Engage. Engage is considered the industry reference for compa-
nies wanting to use the social Web to engage with consumers 
(Solis n.d.). He also wrote  Putting the Public in Public Relations , 
the fi rst book to explore the role of social media in the practice

of public relations. Solis also publishes a prominent blog; 
contributes to business and trade publications such as  AdAge , 
 Forbes , and  VentureBeat ; and is a frequent keynote speaker at 
events and conferences around the world. With over 500,000 
connections on LinkedIn, Twitter, and Facebook, Solis has 
been designated a LinkedIn Infl uencer (Solis n.d.). 
 In 2008, Solis, along with JESS3, released the Conversation 
Prism, an evolving graphic that tracks social networks and or-
ganizes them by usage and purpose (Solis 2008). Th e prism 
puts “You” at the center with spokes that show social media 
platforms for video, events, music, pictures, livecasting, social 
networks, and more. Th e spokes are organized into social sites 
for adapting, listening, and learning, and then further seg-
mented into platforms for communications, human resources, 
community, marketing, and sales, among other functions. Th e 
most recent version of the Conversation Prism, the fourth edi-
tion, was released in 2013. 
 Solis has received a variety of honors and recognitions in-
cluding in 2012 being named one of  Billboard Magazine ’s 
“Billboard’s Twitter 140: Th e Music Industry Characters You

eight “Infl uential Leaders” cited by  CRM Magazine in 2010 
and recognized as one of “Silicon Valley’s 40 under 40” in 2008 
(Prophet n.d.). 
 Spiegel, Evan (1990– ) 
 Evan Spiegel, cofounder and CEO of Snap Inc., formerly called 
Snapchat, is not a coder like several other social media entrepre-
neurs, but rather a product designer with a visual orientation. 
In a  Recode article about Spiegel, his ideas were described as 
“raw and unorthodox” that “probably wouldn’t pass the smell 
test at larger companies like Facebook or Google” (Wagner 
2016). Snap Inc. is also unlike other tech companies in that it is 
not based in Silicon Valley, but was originally housed in a bun-
galow on the Venice boardwalk near Los Angeles (Maddaus 

 
Profiles 
229
2013). Th e company quickly outgrew that space and leased 
several properties on nearby Market Street, other properties 
around Venice, and also space in New York City (Stone 2015). 
 Th e son of two Ivy League–educated lawyers whose mar-
riage ended in divorce, Spiegel graduated from the private high 
school Crossroads in Santa Monica, California. Much has been 
written about Spiegel’s privileged upbringing. In high school, 
through a proposal written to his father, he demanded his fa-
ther lease him a BMW 550i because “Cars bring me sheer joy” 
(Maddaus 2013). After his father refused and other disagree-
ments ensued, he moved in with his mother who leased him 
the $75,000 car. In high school Spiegel had an internship 
with Red Bull, which involved organizing promotional parties, 
some of which were held in his father’s home (Maddaus 2013). 
During his formative years, Spiegel also learned to build a com-
puter from scratch (Maddaus 2013). 
 After high school, Spiegel pursued a degree in product de-
sign at Stanford. He made a number of important connections 
in college, including Peter Wendell, founder of Sierra Ventures 
and instructor of graduate courses on entrepreneurship and 
venture capital. When Wendell invited Spiegel to attend some 
of this classes, he had an opportunity to sit near guest speakers 
such as Google CEO Eric Schmidt and YouTube cofounder 
Chad Hurley, among others. Spiegel also met Scott Cook, the 
CEO of Intuit, who gave him an opportunity to work on a 
platform the company would be employing in India (Maddaus 
2013). Just a few credits shy of graduating, Spiegel was allowed 
to walk across the stage at graduation with every intention of 
fi nishing his remaining credits, but never did. 
 Snapchat was born from a conversation about sexting Spie-
gel had with two Kappa Sigma fraternity brothers, Frank Regi-
nald Brown IV and Bobby Murphy (Entis 2015). Similar to 
the story of Facebook, Snapchat was launched from a college 
dorm room, in this case Spiegel’s. Brown was later forced out of 
the Snapchat team, but he contended that the idea to send self-
deleting photos through an app was his idea (Maddaus 2013). 

230 
Social Media 
Brown sued for a 20 percent stake in the company and a set-
tlement was reached in September 2014 for an undisclosed 
amount (Entis 2015). Murphy, the coder of the team, stayed on 
board and now serves as the company’s chief operating offi  cer. 
 Facebook attempted to purchase Snapchat in 2013 for 
$3 billion, an off er rejected by Spiegel (Entis 2015). Th e same 
year, Snapchat received $60 million in funding, giving Spiegel 
and Murphy $10 million each in the deal (Maddaus 2013). 
Spiegel’s 2016 net worth was estimated to be $2.1 billion, 
a sum that makes him the youngest billionaire in the world 
(Entis 2015). He reportedly lives a lavish lifestyle, driving a 
Ferrari around Los Angeles, traveling around the world, and, 
in 2015, purchasing Harrison Ford’s Brentwood, California, 
home with supermodel girlfriend Miranda Kerr for $12 mil-
lion (Gollayan 2016). 
 Some aspects of Spiegel’s personal life have been highly 
publicized, especially what was revealed in certain e-mail com-
munications. For example, Gawker gained access to e-mails 
Spiegel sent while at Stanford, including invitations to parties, 
jokes that certain fraternities have gay members, drug refer-
ences, and misogynistic suggestions of drunken sex with soror-
ity girls (Biddle 2014). In an e-mail to  Business Insider , Spiegel 
attempted to do some damage control, saying “I’m obviously 
mortifi ed and embarrassed that my idiotic emails during my 
fraternity days were made public. I have no excuse. I’m sorry 
I wrote them at the time and I was jerk to have written them. 
Th ey in no way refl ect who I am today or my views towards 
women” (Entis 2015). A hack of e-mail at Sony Pictures also 
resulted in exposing e-mails between Sony Entertainment CEO 
Michael Lynton and Spiegel, who admitted that his board was 
not aware of critical business issues (Wagner 2016). 
 Stanton, Brandon (1984– ) 
 Before founding the popular Facebook page and blog “Hu-
mans of New York,” Brandon Stanton studied at the University 
of Georgia and earned a degree in history. After graduation,

a $3,000 bet he made that Barack Obama would win the presi-
dency in 2008 helped him land a job trading bonds on the 
Chicago Board of Trade (Stanton n.d.). 
 After three years of trading and then losing his job, Stan-
ton switched careers from trading bonds to his passion, which 
was photography. He set out to photograph interesting street 
scenes in some of America’s largest cities, including New Or-
leans, Pittsburgh, and Philadelphia. From the approximately 
1,000 photographs taken each day, he would select 30 to 40 to 
post on Facebook. He considered selling prints but at the time 
was just sharing the photos for his Facebook connections to 
enjoy (Stanton 2013). 
 In addition to shooting buildings and other objects on the 
streets, Stanton started photographing people, fi rst as candids, 
and then as portraits (Stanton 2013). He noticed that the 
photographs of people were getting the most engagement on 
Facebook. Upon arriving in New York City in August 2010, 
Stanton was almost exclusively capturing people and placing 
the photos in an album on Facebook called “Humans of New 
York.” He then returned to his home of Chicago, packed up, 
and moved to New York with the intention of taking 10,000 
street portraits to plot on an interactive map. After moving the 
photos from his personal Facebook profi le to a “Humans of 
New York” Facebook page, his follower base grew quickly. 
Stanton also maintains a blog with his photos and stories. He 
then added the element of an interview to the photographs, 
making the content even more compelling and the audience 
even larger. Stanton explained in an interview with  Crain’s that 
“having those conversations on the street is a learned skill. It’s 
very much a repetitive process of learning to approach subjects 
and make them comfortable enough to share intimate details 
of their lives. I had to practice” (Benson 2015). 
 In 2013, Stanton’s book  Humans of New York was released 
after selling 30,000 preordered copies. Th e book spent 45 
weeks on the  New York Times Best Seller list, hitting number 
one during that time. In 2015, he released  Humans of New 

232 
Social Media 
York: Stories , which was the number one best seller in travel 
photography on Amazon and also a number one  New York 
Times best seller. He has also released a children’s book called 
 Little Humans . 
 During the summer of 2015, Stanton took time away from 
his New York City subjects to photograph people in Pakistan. 
His photographs shed light on such serious topics as bonded 
labor, abusive relationships, and violence, but also expressed 
common human experiences such as education, recreation, 
and dating. Within just three days, his followers donated 
more than $2 million for a campaign to end bonded labor 
by helping exploited laborers in the brick kiln industry with 
the legal assistance, education, and rehabilitation needed to 
escape their situation (Erbentraut 2015). Another success of 
the campaign was helping a mother in an abusive relation-
ship fi nd housing and medical assistance. A local resident vol-
unteered to connect her with resources. Later that same year, 
Stanton was in Greece, Hungary, Croatia, and Austria to share 
the stories of Syrian refugees (LaMantia 2016). Another proj-
ect in 2015 focused on inmates of fi ve federal prisons in the 
northeast of the United States. In all, Stanton has traveled to 
more than 20 countries on fi ve continents to photograph his 
subjects (LaMantia 2016). 
 In 2016, Stanton photographed pediatric cancer patients, 
parents, doctors, nurses, surgeons, and researchers of Memorial 
Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. Th is photography campaign 
comprised of more than 50 Facebook posts raising $3.8 mil-
lion from more than 100,000 people in 18 days. Th e campaign 
was hailed by the administrator of the Department of Pediat-
rics in an interview with  Crain’s as “life changing” for the hos-
pital by reaching a record-breaking grassroots fund-raising goal 
in such a short time period (LaMantia 2016). In 2015, Stanton 
also raised more than $1 million for a Brooklyn middle school 
called Mott Hall Bridges Academy (Benson 2015). Other cam-
paigns raised funds for the YMCA in Bedford-Stuyvesant and 
for a family to adopt a child from Ethiopia.

 By May 2016, Stanton had more than 17.6 million follow-
ers on Facebook and 5.3 million Instagram followers, but he 
does not monetize the brand beyond the sales of his books and 
fees for public-speaking events. He has not accepted payment 
from any source to place content on his blog. Even when he 
collaborated with the United Nations for a two-month inter-
national trip, he paid for the trip himself (Benson 2015). In 
2015,  Crain’s honored Stanton as a “40 under 40.” 
 Th iel, Peter (1967– ) 
 Peter Th iel has been a part of many digital success stories, 
most notably PayPal and Facebook, and he also runs a hedge 
fund and a venture capital fi rm. Th e  New Yorker said of Th iel, 
“He might be the most successful technology investor in the 
world” and that “Few people in Silicon Valley can match Th iel’s 
combination of business prowess and philosophical breadth” 
(Packer 2011). 
 Born in Frankfurt, Germany, Th iel moved with his family 
fi rst to Cleveland, and then his father’s engineering job took 
the family to several other locations including South Africa and 
Namibia. As of fi fth grade, the family had settled in a com-
munity in the San Francisco Bay area. While growing up, Th iel 
demonstrated a strong profi ciency for math and was also a na-
tionally ranked chess player. He enjoyed reading  Th e Lord of the 
Rings , and later books by Solzhenitsyn and Rand. It was during 
this time that he adopted the libertarian perspective that he 
is known for in the present day. His educational background 
includes an undergraduate degree as well as a law degree from 
Stanford. Post-graduation, he worked for a New York law fi rm 
and a Wall Street investment bank (Packer 2011). 
 Th iel rose to prominence in the tech industry as one of the 
founders of PayPal, along with Reid Hoff man, Max Levchin, 
and Elon Musk. Levchin had heard Th iel talk at Stanford 
about currency trading, and during their meeting the next day, 
they hatched the idea over smoothies of an electronic payment 
system for e-commerce (Packer 2011). Part of the appeal of 

234 
Social Media 
PayPal for Th iel was the potential for transactions to take place 
outside of government control. 
 After PayPal went public and then was sold to eBay for $500 
million, Th iel received a share totaling $55 million. He then 
set up the hedge fund Clarium Capital Management, which 
was mostly funded with his $10 million investment. By 2008, 
the hedge fund had assets of more than $7 billion, but after 
the fi nancial collapse, the fund was reduced to $350 million by 
2011, with two-thirds of it Th iel’s money and representing all 
of his liquid net worth (Packer 2011). 
 Th iel’s initial involvement with Facebook was as an early in-
vestor. He paid $500,000 for a 7 percent stake in the company 
and a position on the board. As of 2012, he had cashed out 
almost all his Facebook holdings for a sum just over $1 billion 
(Pepitone and Cowley 2012). He has since cofounded data-
mining company Palantir Technologies with $30 million of his 
own funding. As of 2016, the company was worth approxi-
mately $20 billion. Palantir’s software works with government 
agencies to locate terrorists and other criminals through their 
information trails. 
 Th iel has attracted much attention for his political beliefs 
and unconventional ideas. Th e online manifesto of his venture 
capital fi rm, Founders Fund, which he runs with Sean Parker 
and others, begins with the statement that sums up Th iel’s frus-
tration with forward progress: “We wanted fl ying cars, instead 
we got 140 characters” (Gobry 2011). Th e fund has invested in 
nanotechnology, space exploration, and robotics. He has also 
supported the Singularity Institute, an artifi cial intelligence 
think tank; the Methuselah Foundation, which works to re-
verse human aging; and the Seasteading Institute, which wants 
to build fl oating city-states on international waters that would 
not be under the jurisdiction of any country’s government. 
 In 2011, Th iel developed a program for promising young 
entrepreneurs to provide them fellowships that would allow 
them to bypass college and start working on launching their 
own start-ups. Called the Th iel Fellowship, each year the 

 
Profiles 
235
program provides two-year grants for $100,000 to 20 young 
people under the age of 23.  Forbes  branded the Th iel Fellow-
ship a “failed education experiment” because the program did 
not produce any revolutionary start-ups and some of the par-
ticipants, recognizing the importance of a college education, 
enrolled in college to complete their degrees (Wadhwa 2013). 
Even Th iel himself has admitted that the entrepreneurs “were 
not focused on breakthrough technologies that will take civili-
zation to the next level” (Wadhwa 2013). 
 In May 2016,  Forbes uncovered that Th iel had been fi nanc-
ing several lawsuits against tabloid journalism giant Gawker 
Media. When Terry Bollea, also known as the wrestler Hulk 
Hogan, sued Gawker for invasion of privacy for publishing a 
sex tape of Bollea and a friend’s wife, it was Th iel who paid 
Bollea’s lawyers approximately $10 million for their representa-
tion. Th e case resulted in a $140 million jury award for Bollea. 
An article in  Forbes explained that, “Th e $140 million judg-
ment, which isn’t covered by insurance, could prove fatal to the 
company if it’s upheld—and could serve as a blueprint for any 
billionaire who wants to lay siege against a media outlet” (Mac 
and Drange 2016). Gawker claimed that Th iel is determined to 
close their operations through litigation. Th iel has stated that 
he believes his actions toward Gawker to be “one of my greater 
philanthropic things” to help people targeted by a “singularly 
terrible bully” (Mac and Drange 2016). 
 Th iel’s antipathy toward Gawker may be traced back to a 
post on the site on December 19, 2007, that was headlined 
“Peter Th iel is totally gay, people.” Although Th iel has said in 
interviews that he had been out as a gay man to friends for a 
few years prior to that, he did not necessarily want this informa-
tion broadcasted to the general public (Mac and Drange 2016). 
 Among Th iel’s properties as of 2011 are a $7 million man-
sion in San Francisco and a $27 million oceanfront property 
in Maui (Packer 2011).  Forbes ranks Th iel as the seventy-ninth 
richest person in tech with an estimated net worth of $2.7 bil-
lion (Forbes 2016a).

frequently visited social media platforms: Twitter and Blogger. 
A  New York Times profi le on leadership changes at Twitter in 
2010 called him “famously deliberate and cautious,” “ill at ease 
on the big stage,” and “methodical” (C. C. Miller 2010). 
 Williams hails from Clarks, Nebraska, where he was involved 
in his high school band, choir, basketball, drama club, and 
the speech team (Epley 2014). His father, a third-generation 
farmer, and his mother, a substitute teacher, raised four kids in 
the community of just 360 residents. After his parents divorced 
during Williams’s senior year of high school, he moved with 
his mother and sister to Columbus, Nebraska, to complete his 
schooling at Columbus High School. Williams attended the 
University of Nebraska–Lincoln, but dropped out before fi nal 
exams his sophomore year. 
 After leaving the university, Williams worked for a mentor 
in Key West, Florida, writing direct mail copy, but returned to 
Nebraska to focus on other projects, including a historical ac-
count of Cornhuskers football on CD-ROM and also selling 
and setting up Internet domains for local companies (Epley 
2014). He also created a video that explained how to use a 
command line to connect computers in a network, which he 
sold for a profi t (Greene 2007). Williams then started an Inter-
net company, which failed because he hired unqualifi ed peo-
ple to write software and had a diffi  cult time managing them 
(Greene 2007). He shut the company down after about a year 
and set off  for California. 
 In Sebastopol, California, north of San Francisco, Wil-
liams worked for O’Reilly and Associates as a marketing co-
ordinator in the software group (Epley 2014). He struck out 
on his own after just seven months, but did continue working 
for O’Reilly as a freelance intranet developer. Th en, together 
with Meg Hourihan, whom he met at a networking event 
and dated briefl y, he founded Pyra Labs in 1999. High school 
friend Paul Bausch joined the start-up shortly after to write

code. At the time, Williams was interested in developing soft-
ware that allowed people to eff ectively collaborate on projects 
(Greene 2007). 
 Pyra Labs launched a tool for publishing “weblogs,” which is 
what blogs were originally called, to help people without cod-
ing skills self-publish their own websites. Th e platform, called 
Blogger, was later rebuilt by Williams and sold to Google for 
an undisclosed sum, although he has said it was less than the 
$50 million reported by gossip blog Valleywag (Greene 2007). 
Williams’s work on Blogger earned him accolades including 
being named to  MIT Technology Review magazine’s “top 100 
innovators under age 35” in 2003 and “Person of the Year” by 
 PC Magazine in 2004 (Biography.com n.d.). 
 Williams invested in a company called Odeo founded by 
Noah Glass in 2004, and two years later, he bought out their 
investors’ interest in the company, reformed it as Obvious 
Corporation, and fi red Glass (Carlson 2011). However, dur-
ing that time, the company developed Twitter, which was later 
spun out as a separate company. In an interview with  MIT 
Technology Review , Williams called Twitter a “no-brainer” for 
“social animals” (Greene 2007). He also explained how “People 
like other people. So hearing from them, and being able to ex-
press yourself to people you care about in a really simple way, is 
fun, and it can be addictive.” After serving as CEO of Twitter 
for about two years, Williams stepped down but remains on 
the board and is one of the largest shareholders (Epley 2014). 
 In 2012, Williams founded and became CEO of Medium, a 
Web-publishing platform that allows for a more visually attrac-
tive presentation of a story. Medium is built on the idea that in 
the near future people will not be scouring the Web for content 
posted on blogs or other sites, but rather looking for it on cen-
tralized websites (Hof 2015). By posting content on Medium, 
creators have a higher likelihood of attracting readers. 
 In a 2013 interview with  Wired , Williams shared some of 
his musings about the Internet. “We often think the Internet 
enables you to do new things, but people just want to do the 

238 
Social Media 
same things they’ve always done.” He then added, “Th e Inter-
net is not what I thought it was 20 years ago. It’s not a utopian 
world. It’s essentially like a lot of other major technological 
revolutions that have taken place in the history of the world” 
(Tate 2013). 
 When Twitter went public in November 2013, Williams’s 
12 percent stake in the company was worth more than $1 billion 
(Mac 2013b). In late 2015, Williams donated 1.8 million shares 
of Twitter stock to the Sara and Evan Williams Foundation, 
which sold them for $47 million (Rosoff  2015). Th e foundation 
supports causes such as literacy and the environment. Williams 
currently lives in San Francisco with his wife and two sons. 
 Zuckerberg, Mark (1984– ) 
 Last on this list is entrepreneur Mark Zuckerberg, who is fi rst 
on many lists for making the most signifi cant contribution to 
social media through the launch of Facebook. Zuckerberg, the 
son of a dentist father and psychiatrist mother, was raised in 
a modest home in Dobbs Ferry, New York, as the second of 
four children and the only son (Kirkpatrick 2010a). After two 
years of public high school, Zuckerberg transferred to the elite 
boarding school Phillips Exeter Academy. His many awards 
and honors in various high school subjects such as math, as-
tronomy, physics, and classical languages as well as his partici-
pation on the fencing team as captain and most valuable player 
earned him admission into Harvard (Kirkpatrick 2010a). 
 Facebook’s story begins at Harvard during Zuckerberg’s 
sophomore year while he lived in a suite with roommates 
Dustin Moskovitz, Chris Hughes, and Billy Olson. During the 
fi rst week of school in 2003, Zuckerberg developed a program 
called Course Match that would help students choose courses 
based on friends who were also registered. Quickly, hundreds 
of students started using the site (Kirkpatrick 2010a). Zuck-
erberg’s next online project was Facemash, which invited stu-
dents to compare their peers with the goal of determining “the 
hottest person on campus” (Kirkpatrick 2010a, 23). Photos for

the site were provided from the digital archives of photos taken 
at freshman orientation used for the “facebooks” produced by 
each of Harvard residential living houses. 
 In early 2004, Zuckerberg registered Th efacebook.com with 
the intention of combining features from Course Match, Face-
mash, and the social networking site Friendster. Friendster’s 
primary purpose was to connect users for dating, but the site 
had experienced some technical issues. MySpace also launched 
prior to Facebook, but had not caught on with Harvard stu-
dents. Zuckerberg’s key idea was to create an online version 
of the school’s printed facebook. After Zuckerberg set up the 
site with a hosting company, Th efacebook launched on Febru-
ary 4, 2004. Within four days of launching, the site had 650 
users, all with a Harvard.edu e-mail address. By the end of the 
fi rst month, the site had 10,000 users. After four months of 
successful operation, Zuckerberg was off ered $10 million for 
the company, an off er he quickly declined (Kirkpatrick 2010a). 
 Th e summer after Zuckerberg’s sophomore year was spent 
in Palo Alto, California, in the heart of Silicon Valley. At the 
end of the summer with 200,000 Facebook users and on the 
precipice of launching at 70 more campuses, Zuckerberg, along 
with partner Dustin Moskovitz, made the easy decision not to 
return to Harvard in the fall (Kirkpatrick 2010a). 
 Th rough the years, Facebook continued to grow its user base 
among college students, and then the general public. Th e com-
pany expanded the platform’s available languages to accommo-
date global users. Facebook went public in May 2012 with an 
initial public off ering (IPO) that was fraught with problems. 
Th e company raised its IPO price shortly before going public 
and then technical problems at NASDAQ caused trader confu-
sion (Luckerson 2014). Th e stock sunk from its initial off ering 
of $38.23 to $18 by August 2012. Since then, however, the 
stock has continued to climb, reaching $116 in April 2016. 
 In 2012, Zuckerberg married girlfriend Priscilla Chan, 
whom he had dated on and off  since his sophomore year at 
Harvard. Th e wedding was timed to follow Chan’s graduation

Social Media 
from UCSF’s medical school, but it also coincidently took 
place one day after Facebook’s IPO. After the birth of their 
fi rst child, Maxima Chan Zuckerberg, in late 2015, Zucker-
berg announced that he and his wife will eventually give away 
99 percent of their Facebook stock, at that time worth about 
$45 billion (Frankel, Fung, and Layton 2015). According to a 
letter to their daughter posted on Facebook, the couple stated 
that their mission is to “advance human potential and promote 
equality for all children” (Frankel, Fung, and Layton 2015). 
Th e money will be directed into the Zuckerberg Chan Initia-
tive, which is not a nonprofi t foundation but rather a limited 
liability company. Previous large contributions given by the 
company include $120 million to public and charter schools 
in the San Francisco Bay Area and $100 million to the public 
school system in Newark, New Jersey, a controversial project 
that failed to provide sustainable results “because it was a top-
down approach that called for wholesale changes in the city’s 
public schools with plans crafted by outsiders, not community 
members” (Frankel, Fung, and Layton 2015). Th e couple has 
also provided $15 million to AltSchool, a corporation founded 
by a former Google employee that provides personalized in-
struction through technology, and have plans to open a private, 
tuition-free school in East Palo Alto for low-income students 
(Frankel, Fung, and Layton 2015).

 Introduction 
 Technology is increasingly integrated into the lives of users, 
impacting a wide range of daily activities including communi-
cation, news and information consumption, management of 
tasks, entertainment, shopping, and work. For many users, the 
technological devices of mobile phones, tablets, and comput-
ers are close at hand throughout the day and interactions with 
them are common, particularly to access social media sites. Th e 
data detailed in this chapter provide evidence for the profound 
impact of social media on the lives of users. 
 Th is chapter presents fi ndings from research studies, which 
provide valuable insights into Internet, social, and mobile users 
and usage, including the increasing use of smartphones to access 
social media sites. Social media addiction is also addressed, and 
research studies are presented that show the amount of time 
spent on social media as well as feelings of addiction. Th is chap-
ter also describes statistics that compare usage of various social 
media platforms, presents user and usage data about the most 
popular platforms, addresses the use of social media by market-
ers, and explores social commerce. Finally, presented at the end 
of the chapter are documents related to social media privacy

social media usage in disasters and suppressing stories on Face-
book, and a speech related to a popular social media campaign. 
 Internet, Social Media, and Mobile Usage 
 Th is section presents data on Internet, social, and mobile users 
in both the United States and worldwide and includes trends 
over time as well as demographic data on social media users. 
In the United States with a population of almost 323 million 
as of January 2016, more than 282 million people or 87 per-
cent were active Internet users and 192 million or 59 percent 
were active social media users. Mobile phone penetration was 
actually higher than total population at more than 342 million 
or 106 percent, and 169 million people or 52 percent of the 
population were active mobile social users (see Table 5.1). 
 Social media have been embraced by billions of people 
around the world, and the number of active users continues to 
rise. As of January 2016, the worldwide snapshot shows that 
more than 3.4 billion people of the almost 7.4 billion are Inter-
net users, more than 2.3 billion are active social media users, 
almost 3.8 billion are mobile users, and almost 2 billion people 
are active mobile social media users (see Table 5.2). 
     Globally, as shown in Table 5.3, the largest population of 
social media users are found in East Asia (769 million), followed

by Southeast Asia (234 million), North America (213 million), 
South America (211 million), and Western Europe (201 million). 
Th e highest penetration of social media users can be found in 
North America (59 percent), followed by South America (50 per-
cent), Western Europe (48 percent), and East Asia (48 percent). 
 When the Pew Research Center began tracking social media 
usage in 2005, only 7 percent of American adults used social

media (see Figure 5.1). By 2015, almost two-thirds of Ameri-
cans were users. Growth has slowed in recent years as most 
mainstream users have already adopted social media. 
 Th e Pew Research Center also looked at demographic dif-
ferences and trends among adult social media users in the 
United States, which are shown in Table 5.4. In terms of age, at 
90 percent, users aged 18–29 are most likely to use social 
media. Since 2008, women have been more likely than men to 
be social media users, but the gap is small. In 2015, 68 percent 
of women and 62 percent of men were users. In 2014, the 
percentages were closer at 63 percent of women and 60 percent 
of men. Americans with higher levels of education and higher 
socioeconomic status have also consistently been more likely to 
be social media users. Percentages of users with some college or 
an associate’s degree and those with a college degree or more 
have been close in usage since 2008, but those with a high

school degree or less have consistently been less likely to use 
social media. In 2015, for example, 76 percent of Americans 
with a college degree or more education were social media users, 
70 percent of those with some college or an associate’s degree 
were users, and only 54 percent of those with a high school

degree or less were users. A similar trend can be observed with 
income levels, with 78 percent of Americans living in house-
holds making $75,000 or more using social media in 2015, 
72 percent of those making $50,000 to $74,999, 69 percent 
of those making $30,000 to $49,999, and only 56 percent of 
those making less than $30,000. In terms of race, diff erences in 
usage are not very pronounced, a trend that has occurred since 
2009. By 2015, 65 percent of non-Hispanic Caucasians and 
Hispanics were users and 56 percent of non-Hispanic African 
Americans were users, with usage percentages being even closer 
during the previous fi ve years. 
 Smartphone Ownership and Social Media 
Usage on Devices 
 Because so many people are using smartphones to access 
social media, smartphone ownership is a key to understanding 
increased social media usage. Th is section covers ownership of 
various digital devices as well as global smartphone penetra-
tion, the percentage of users who can access the Web and time 
spent accessing the Web via a mobile phone, and trends over 
time for engaging with social media from various devices. 
 In the United States, as of 2015, 92 percent of the popu-
lation owned a cellphone, including smartphones. Th e sec-
ond most popular device was a desktop or laptop computer at 
73 percent, then smartphones at 68 percent, and tablet comput-
ers at 45 percent. Other devices included MP3 players at 40 per-
cent, game consoles at 40 percent, e-book readers at 19 percent, 
and portable gaming devices at 14 percent (see Figure 5.2). 
 As shown in Table 5.5, trends over time among adults aged 
18–29 in the United States show even more dramatic increases 
for smartphone and tablet ownership from 2010 to 2015. Dur-
ing this time, computer and MP3 player ownership dropped 
from 88 percent to 78 percent for computers and from 
75 percent to 51 percent for MP3 players, suggesting that other 
devices have replaced computers and MP3 players. On the rise

 Data collected in 2015 by the Pew Research Center exam-

and income. Th e data showed that a digital divide occurs for 
likelihood to own a smartphone on the basis of age, educa-
tion, and income, with younger, more educated, and higher 
income people more likely to own a smartphone. As shown in 
Table 5.6, of the top 12 countries in terms of smartphone 
penetration, South Korea (88 percent), Australia (77 percent), 
and Israel (74 percent) rank in the top three followed by the 
United States at 72 percent. Of the countries on this list, Ger-
many, Malaysia, and Turkey all have the largest diff erences 
(42 percent) in penetration between users aged 35 and up and 
those aged 18–34. Education diff erences are more pronounced

in Chile, Malaysia, and Turkey, where those who are more edu-
cated are more likely to be smartphone owners. Similarly, in 
Chile and Malaysia, the diff erence between percentage owner-
ship by those with higher incomes and those with lower is the 
most pronounced. 
 Asia is also a particularly vibrant region for mobile traffi  c with 
561 million active mobile social accounts. A study by Google 
described Asia as “mobile-fi rst,” referring to the high percentage 
of Internet users who fi rst went online using a mobile device 
as well as the high penetration of smartphone usage (Google 
2014). Of the top seven countries in terms of percentage of 
the population that uses a smartphone shown in Table 5.7, fi ve 
are Asian countries. Singapore, South Korea, Hong Kong, 
China, and Australia all have higher penetrations than the United 
States, which is followed by Malaysia. For all Asian countries in 
the study, computer usage is lower than smartphone usage, but 
for the United States and Australia, computer usage is higher. 
Smartphone-only users are highest in Malaysia (35 percent), 
followed by Singapore (16 percent), Hong Kong (14 percent), 
South Korea (14 percent), and the United States (11 percent). Th e 
implications of such research are that products and services 
need to be increasingly built with a mobile mindset. 

264 
Social Media 
 Th e percentage of adults accessing the Web via a mobile 
phone has been increasing steadily in recent years. Mobile 
phones are particularly popular in developing countries that do 
not have the infrastructure to provide Internet access through 
a phone network or broadband, but are capable of installing a 
cell tower. In 2011, only 51 percent of Internet users globally 
were accessing the Web through a mobile phone, but by 2015, 
that percentage had reached 75 percent (see Figure 5.3). 
 Th e time spent online on mobile phones has also been on 
the rise in recent years. When looking across age groups, users 
aged 16–24 report that they spend approximately 3.26 hours 
per day online on their mobile phones (up from 1.88 hours in 
2012) while users aged 55–64 are spending 0.58 hours per day 
on average (up from 0.37 hours in 2012) (see Figure 5.4). 
 On average, users in Latin America are spending the most 
time online on mobile, followed by the Middle East and Africa, 
Asia Pacifi c, North America, and fi nally, Europe (see Figure 5.5). 
 Between 2008 and 2015, the overall time spent on digital 
media including mobile devices, desktop and laptop comput-
ers, and other connected devices has increased from 2.7 hours

per day to 5.6 hours, as shown in Figure 5.6. Much of this 
increase is driven by the increased time spent on mobile phones, 
from just 0.3 hours per day (12 percent of all time spent) to 
2.8 hours per day (51 percent of all time spent).

 Since 2013, share of time spent accessing social media on 
smartphones has been increasing from 56 percent in 2013 
(through both the app and the Web) to 67 percent in 2015. At 
the same time, users who access social media from a desktop 
computer have declined from 33 percent in 2013 to 21 percent 
in 2015 (see Figure 5.7). 
 Social Media Addiction 
 To understand social media addiction, this section starts with 
a discussion of the global estimates of time per day spent on 
social media. Th e section will then cover teen daily usage of 
screens in general and social media in particular and then feel-
ings of device addiction among both teens and their parents. 
Finally, this section will cover compulsive phone checking, 
including the platforms accessed fi rst in the morning. 
 GlobalWebIndex’s quarterly report for the third quarter 
of 2016 found that approximately one-third of all time spent 
online is spent on social media sites. As shown in Figure 5.8, 
this amount has been growing steadily in recent years from 
1.36 hours spent per day on social media in 2012 to 1.58 hours 
spent per day in 2016.

268 
Social Media 
 According to 2014 statistics compiled by GO-Globe, the 
average social media user in the age range of 15–19 spends 
three hours a day on social media, while those aged 20–29 
spend two hours (GO-Globe 2014). Other studies of teenag-
ers found similar levels of social media usage. A 2015 report 
by Common Sense Media found that among teen girls who 
use social media, the average time spent per day is just under 
2:30 hours while teen boys who use social media spend slightly 
more than 1:30 hours (Rideout 2015). Sixty-four percent of 
teen girls report that they use social media on any given day 
while 51 percent of teen boys reported the same. 
 According to the Common Sense Census from 2015, Amer-
ican teenagers spend an average of almost seven hours per day 
(6:40) using screens for entertainment, including computers, 
phones, televisions, and video games (see Figure 5.9). Tweens 
aged 8 to 12 are using screens an average of 4:36 hours per 
day. Among teens, the highest percentage of users view screens 
between 4 and 8 hours (31 percent), followed by more than

8 hours (26 percent) per day. Among tweens, the highest per-
centages use screens two hours or less (28 percent), 2–4 hours 
(27 percent), and 4–8 hours (27 percent) per day. Among the 
teens and tweens who use social media, teens spend approxi-
mately more than two hours per day (2:04) on social media 
and tweens spend 1:43 hours per day using social media 
(Rideout 2015). 
 Teenagers are often described as suff ering from digital media 
addiction. In a 2012 Common Sense Media study, 41 percent 
of the 13- to 17-year-olds surveyed said they would describe 
themselves as addicted to their cell phones and 20 percent said 
they were addicted to a social media site (Rideout 2012). A total 
of 43 percent either strongly or somewhat agreed they wish they 
could sometimes unplug from social media and 36 percent either 
strongly or somewhat agreed that they would like to go back to 
a time prior to Facebook. Th e report explained that some of the 
desire to unplug for teens is based on exposure to racist, sexist, 
or homophobic content on social media sites. Forty-fi ve percent 
of the teen respondents reported sometimes feeling frustrated 
when spending time with friends who are distracted by social 
media, texting, and browsing the Internet (see Table 5.8).

Social Media 
 Parents are also frustrated with their teens’ use of digital 
devices with 59 percent of those surveyed for a 2016 Com-
mon Sense Media study saying that their teens are addicted 
to mobile devices and 66 percent of parents reporting that 
their teens spend too much time with their devices (Felt and 
Robb 2016). Arguments happen frequently, with 36 percent 
of parents saying mobile device use causes daily confl ict, 
43 percent saying less than daily, and 21 percent reporting 
no confl icts. Surveys of teens also echo what parents are say-
ing. About 50 percent of teens report they are addicted to 
their mobile devices and 52 percent say they spend too much 
time on them. Teens are not alone, however, in their addic-
tion. About 28 percent of teens report that their parents are 
addicted to their mobile devices, and 27 percent of parents 
say they believe they are addicted (see Table 5.9). About one-
half of parents and one-third of teens have tried to cut the 
amount of time they are spending on mobile devices (Felt and 
Robb 2016). 
 Studies have shown that many cell phone users are compul-
sive phone checkers, with a worldwide average of 150 checks 
per day, according to the Ford 2014 Trend Report (Ford 2013). 
Additionally, 80 percent of respondents in the United States 
surveyed for that report agreed that “Today, the cell phone is a 
crutch for people’s fear of being idle.”

Data and Documents 
271
 A 2013 International Data Corporation (IDC) study con-
ducted for Facebook on the topic of smartphones and social 
media found that 79 percent of people have their phones near 
them for all but two hours of their waking day, with an aver-
age of 32:51 minutes spent using Facebook on the phone over 
an average of 13.8 Facebook sessions (IDC 2013). GO-Globe 
reported that approximately 18 percent of users cannot go 
more than a few hours without checking Facebook (GO-Globe 
2014). In a study of parents and teens, Common Sense found 
that 69 percent of parents and 78 percent of teens check their 
devices hourly, and 48 percent of parents and 72 percent of 
teens feel the need to respond immediately to texts, messages, 
and other notifi cations (Felt and Robb 2016). More concern-
ing is that 56 percent of parents say they check their devices 
while driving and 51 percent of teens note that they see their 
parents checking while driving. 
 Th e IDC study also discovered that within 15 minutes of 
waking up, 79 percent of smartphone owners are checking their 
phones (IDC 2013). Among those users, approximately 80 per-
cent check their phones before doing anything else. As expected, 
percentages for people aged 18–24 are even higher with 
89 percent of them checking the phone within 15 minutes and 
74 percent reaching for the phone immediately upon waking. 
 As shown in Table 5.10, a study by GfK MRI of U.S. 
smartphone users found texts and e-mail to be the most pop-
ular apps checked fi rst thing in the morning, with millennials 
and baby boomers most likely to check texts (78 percent and 
59 percent, respectively) and Gen Xers most likely to check 
e-mail fi rst (67 percent) followed closely by texts (66 per-
cent). Two social media sites were included in the top results, 
including Facebook, which is checked by 48 percent overall, 
but by the highest percentage of millennials compared to the 
other age groups (58 percent). Similarly, Instagram, although 
only checked by 16 percent of all smartphone users surveyed, 
was checked by 29 percent of millennials, higher than the 
other two age groups.

 Usage of Various Social Media Platforms 
 Th is section begins with a discussion of global usage of social 
media and messaging platforms in terms of monthly active 
users, U.S. penetration of various social media platforms, 
global membership and visitation of social media platforms, 
and frequency of visitation in the United States. Th en, this 
section will cover changes in millennial usage of social media 
platforms over time and present a comparison of the two 
youngest demographic groups in terms of posting or com-
menting on various social media platforms. 
 An examination of the social media and messaging plat-
forms with the highest monthly average users (MAU) as shown 
in Figure 5.10 reveals that Facebook and its products as well 
as the products of Chinese fi rm Tencent and other Asian com-
panies dominate. At the beginning of 2016, Facebook contin-
ued to lead the social media landscape with 1.59 billion MAU. 
As the fi rst social network to reach a billion users, Facebook 
also commands high usage among mobile users at the rate of 
1.39 billion average users per month (Facebook n.d.). On a 
daily basis, Facebook attracts over a billion users. 

 
Data and Documents 
273
 Facebook-owned WhatsApp receives 900 million MAU. 
Another messaging app, Tencent QQ, holds third place with 
860 million MAU. Owned by Tencent Holdings Limited, 
most Tencent QQ users live in China and other Asian coun-
tries. Facebook’s Messenger holds fourth place in usage with 
800 million MAU. QZone and WeChat, also owned by the 
Chinese company Tencent, have 653 and 650 million MAU, 
respectively. Blogging platform Tumblr has 555 million MAU, 
and yet another Facebook product, Instagram, has 400 mil-
lion MAU. Although Twitter has experienced lagging growth 
recently, it is still solid as the ninth largest among social net-
works or messaging platforms with 320 million MAU with 
80 percent of those users accessing the platform from a mobile 
phone at least monthly. Other popular platforms include mes-
saging platform Snapchat with 200 million MAU, digital 
scrapbooking site Pinterest, which reached 100 MAU, and 
professional networking site LinkedIn also with 100 MAU, but 
with over 400 million total registered users. 
 In the United States, the top social networking or messag-
ing platforms in terms of percentage of the adult population

who are active users include Facebook (41 percent), Face-
book Messenger (26 percent), Twitter (17 percent), Pinterest 
(15 percent), Instagram (15 percent), and Google+ (12 per-
cent) (see Figure 5.11). 
 In comparing the top social platforms in terms of member-
ship, visitation (within the past month), and active usage with 
a global sample of Internet users aged 16–64 (excluding China) 
during 2015, GlobalWebIndex found that the highest percent-
age of Internet users are members of Facebook and that the 
highest percentage have visited YouTube in the past month. 
Also, for most of the platforms, those who are active users rep-
resent approximately half of those who have a profi le on the 
site (see Figure 5.12). 
 When comparing the frequencies at which U.S. users access 
social media sites, Facebook continues to dominate with 
70 percent of users visiting daily, followed by Instagram, which 
is visited daily by 59 percent of users, and Twitter, which vis-
ited daily by 38 percent of users (see Figure 5.13).

Social Media 
 As shown in Figure 5.14, an examination of social media 
penetration over time with teens and millennials aged 13–32 
by YPulse has shown slight declines in the usage of Facebook 
and Twitter among this age group, with growth in the newer 
social media platforms of Instagram, Snapchat, and Vine. 
Over the more than two-year time period examined (January 
2013–March 2015), the popularity ranking of the platforms 
remained relatively unchanged with Facebook still the leader 
and YouTube an increasingly close second. By early 2015, how-
ever, Instagram surpassed Twitter as the third most used social 
media platform. 
 Comparing teens aged 13–17 to young adults aged 18–32 
showed some dramatic diff erences in social media usage in 
terms of posting or commenting on the sites daily, particularly 
for Facebook, where 57 percent of those aged 18–32 post or 
comment daily and only 28 percent of those aged 13–17 do so 
(see Figure 5.15). In contrast, Instagram, Snapchat, and You-
Tube receive daily posts or comments from signifi cantly higher 
percentages of younger teens than the young adults surveyed.

 Specific Platform Data 
 Th is section describes insights and data related to various spe-
cifi c social media platforms, including Facebook, Twitter, Pin-
terest, LinkedIn, Instagram, and Snapchat. Video viewing is 
also discussed. 
 Facebook 
 As of June 2016, Facebook had 1.71 billion monthly active 
users (1.57 billion on mobile) and 1.13 billion daily active 
users (1.03 billion on mobile). Th e majority of those users 
(84.5 percent) live outside the United States and Canada (Face-
book n.d.). As of May 2016, the largest number of Facebook 
users were located in India (more than 195 million), followed 
by the United States (191.3 million), Brazil (90.11 mil-
lion), Indonesia (77.58 million), and China (52.87 million) 
(see Table 5.11). 
 Th e dominance of Facebook is further demonstrated in the 
fi nding by GlobalWebIndex that 84 percent of online adults in

Facebook, Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, and Instagram. 
Not surprisingly, the younger the user, the more likely he or she 
is to be a member of one of these platforms (see Table 5.12). 

 
Data and Documents 
279
 With a penetration rate of 72 percent for Facebook in the 
United States, a higher percentage of women who use the 
Internet than men are active Facebook users (77 percent vs. 
66 percent) and the highest percentage of users come from 
the 18- to 29-year-old age group (82 percent) followed by the 
30- to 49-year-old age group (79 percent). When comparing 
racial and ethnic groups, usage penetration is highest among 
Hispanics (75 percent) (see Table 5.13). 
 Among Facebook actions, the most prevalent is also the easi-
est: clicking the “like” button, which is something that 66 per-
cent of active worldwide Facebook users have done. As shown 
in Figure 5.16, other popular activities include watching a 
video (51 percent), messaging a friend (50 percent), and com-
menting on a friend’s photo or video (48 percent). 
 As shown in Figure 5.17, the most popular brands on Face-
book during September 2016 (not including Facebook itself) 
were Coca-Cola with more than 99 million fans, YouTube with

 As of March 2016, the top 10 most popular tweets in terms 
of retweets were dominated by a popular boy band, political 
statements, and celebrity selfi es. Th e most retweeted tweet at 
the time was a selfi e from the 2014 Academy Awards posted 
by host Ellen DeGeneres (@Th eEllenShow) that also featured 
Bradley Cooper, Lupita Nyong’o, Jennifer Lawrence, Brad Pitt, 
Kevin Spacey, Julia Roberts, and others. Th e tweet that “broke

sung’s Galaxy phone (Bulik 2014). In second place, One Direc-
tion band member Louis Tomlinson (@Louis_Tomlinson) 
tweeted about his “love” for bandmate Harry Styles, which

leaving the band, resulting in the fi fth most retweeted tweet. 
In sixth place, when President Barack Obama was reelected, 
his staff  shared a photo of the president hugging First Lady 
Michelle Obama with the caption “Four more years.” At the 
time of its posting, this tweet was the most retweeted ever. 
Th e seventh most retweeted tweet was posted by One Direc-

Social Media 
 Video 
 Video viewing is popular with social media users, either through 
social media platforms like YouTube or Facebook or from apps 
like Netfl ix. As of September 2016, YouTube had more than a 
billion users who watch hundreds of millions of hours on You-
Tube every day (YouTube n.d.). YouTube also has greater reach 
among 18- to 34-year-olds and 18- to 49-year-olds than any 
U.S. cable network. More than half of viewers are coming from 
mobile phones and the time spent per mobile viewing session 
averages more than 40 minutes. 
 Data collected in July 2015 displayed in Table 5.17 reveal 
that monthly digital video viewers have increased each year since 
2012 and are expected to increase through 2017. Similarly, time 
spent on a daily basis with digital video has increased and is 
expected to increase during this time period, with most of the 
viewing growth attributable to viewing on mobile devices. At 
the same time, traditional television viewers increased between 
2012 and 2013, but decreased in both 2014 and 2015 and are 
expected to continue to drop into 2016 and 2017. In 2015, 
viewing of digital video on phones surpassed desktop computers. 
 Almost a quarter of U.S. smartphone users watch television 
shows or movies on their devices on a daily basis and about

percent) have never done so and 17 percent have tried once or 
twice (see Figure 5.18). 
 As of September 2016, the top 10 most viewed YouTube

10 also includes singers Justin Bieber, Rihanna, and Tay-
lor Swift as well as British music label EMI Group Limited

ish video-on-demand site. Videos targeted at children also fea-
ture prominently on the list including toy advertising channel 
FunToyzCollector, Russian cartoon and family programming 
channel Get Movies, and children’s educational programming 
channel LittleBabyBum.

 Pinterest 
 A February 2015 eMarketer study estimated that Pinterest 
would reach 47 million monthly active users in the United 
States that year and pass 50 million in 2016. Even though Pin-
terest does not have the activity of platforms like Facebook or 
Twitter, it attracts users who are interested in making purchases. 
Females comprise the majority of users, estimated to be almost 
83 percent of all Pinterest users in 2016 (see Table 5.19). 
 A separate study found the penetration rate for Pinterest to 
be 31 percent of U.S. Internet users as of 2015 (see Table 5.20). 
A much higher percentage of women Internet users than men 
are active Pinterest users (44 percent vs. 16 percent) and the 
highest percentage of users come from the 18- to 29-year-old age 
group (37 percent) followed closely by the 30- to 49-year-old

and 2017. Most of the income comes from U.S. ad revenues, as 
opposed to non-U.S. revenues. 
 Snapchat 
 Penetration of Snapchat is high among the youngest users 
(70 percent for ages 18–24 and 41 percent for ages 25–34). In 
just three years, Snapchat has seen signifi cant increases in its 
usage across all age groups as shown in Table 5.24. 
 Th e majority of Snapchat users are millennials born between 
1981 and 2000. As of 2016, eMarketer estimates the num-
ber of Snapchat millennial users in the United States to be 
40.9 million and the percentage of smartphone users in that 
age group to be 51.3 percent (see Figure 5.22). Growth in 
Snapchat usage is expected to continue to rise through 2020, 
but at a slower rate. 
 At the beginning of 2016, Snapchat users were watch-
ing more than 7 billion video clips each day, a number that 
is approaching Facebook’s 8 billion daily video views despite 
Facebook having 15 times as many users (Frier and Chang 
2016). Th e top actions that Snapchat users are performing, 
as shown in Figure 5.23, are sending a message (70 percent), 
sending a photo snap (61 percent), adding a friend (53 per-
cent), sending a video snap (47 percent), and creating or view-
ing a story (45 percent).

 Social Media for Marketing 
 Th is section presents data on marketers’ use of social media 
platforms as well as the platforms they plan to increase usage 
of in the future and those perceived to have the best return on 
investment (ROI). Additionally, this section includes past and 
projected spending on social media on a global scale and U.S. 
allocations of digital marketing budgets. 
 As of May 2015, Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn were the 
top three platforms that worldwide marketers were using to pro-
mote their companies, products, or services (see Figure 5.24). 
 As shown in Figure 5.25, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and 
LinkedIn were all cited as platforms where worldwide market-
ers would be focusing more attention in the future. 
 A worldwide study by Social Fresh, Firebrand Group, and 
Simply Measured of social media marketers found that highest 
percentage of marketers cited Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram 
as the three social platforms with the best ROI (see Figure 5.26).

Social Media 
 In 2015, eMarketer predicted that global advertising spend-
ing on social media would reach almost $24 billion in 2015, 
a 33.5 percent increase from 2014, and that it would reach 
almost $36 billion by 2017. Social media ad spending in North 
America was expected to pass $10 billion for 2015, an increase 
of 31 percent over 2014. As a percentage of overall digital 
ad spending, social media advertising was expected to reach 
almost 14 percent worldwide for 2015 and almost 16 percent 
in North America (see Table 5.25). 
 A study by Cowen and Company published in early 2016 
by eMarketer found that U.S. marketers allocated more 
than 22 percent of their digital advertising budgets to social 
media and almost 20 percent to video advertising. Th e other 
digital categories included more than 27 percent for display 
advertising and more than 25 percent on search advertising 
(see Figure 5.27).

 Impact of Social Media on Online Shopping 
 For many retailers, online sales contribute signifi cantly to the 
bottom line. Th is section provides metrics for online and social 
commerce, presents adoption rates for social buy buttons, and 
reports activities that are having the most impact on online 
shopping behavior. In the United States, online sales for 2015 
totaled $335 billion, a number that is expected to increase 
more than 9 percent annually for the next fi ve years (Lindner 
2016). Additionally, 244 million customers browsed or bought 
online in 2015, which is expected to reach 270 million by 
2020. Mobile phones are estimated to have had a $1 trillion 
impact on online and offl  ine sales in 2015. 
 Included in online sales are sales through social networks, 
which is called social commerce. Th e  Social Media 500 report 
by Internet Retailer found that, of the 500 leading online 
retailers, social commerce totaled $3.3 billion in 2014, an 
increase from $2.6 billion in 2013 (Smith 2015). Traffi  c to

retail websites from social networks had also increased 7 per-
cent during this time frame. Total worldwide social commerce 
was projected to reach $20 billion in 2014 and $30 billion in 
2015 (Statista 2014). Th e leading social commerce e-retailers 
in terms of revenue in 2014 included Zappos.com (10.16 per-
cent of traffi  c from social networks), Fab.com (25 percent), 
and NoMoreRack.com (35 percent) (Saleh n.d.). Th e next 
three leaders included Victoria’s Secret (8.5 percent), Nord-
strom (8.3 percent), and Nike (8.4 percent). Th e leaders are all 
fashion brands, indicating the ability of social media to work 
eff ectively for this industry. 
 Buy buttons on social media sites are helping to drive social 
commerce. As of August 2015, e-mail and Facebook were the 
leading platforms for the adoption of buy buttons, used by 27.1 
percent and 22.0 percent, respectively, of retailers surveyed (see 
Figure 5.28). Although buy buttons are available on all other 
major social media platforms, a small percentage of retailers are 
using them.

 At this time, however, most worldwide consumers do not 
believe that a buy button on a social media platform would 
make them more likely to purchase a product. In a study by 
GlobalWebIndex, only 10 percent of Internet users said a buy 
button would make them more likely to purchase, as shown 
in Figure 5.29. Other fi ndings were that 37 percent follow a 
favorite brand on social media and 30 percent use social media 
to research a product. 
 Digital activities are having an impact on online shopping 
behavior. A study by PricewaterhouseCoopers of more than 
22,000 digital shoppers who had shopped online at least once 
in the past year found that 45 percent reported that reading 
reviews on social media sites had an infl uence on their purchase 
behavior. Other eff ective strategies included receiving promo-
tional off ers from an online retailer (44 percent), viewing online 
ads (30 percent), staying on top of trends (25 percent), writ-
ing reviews (22 percent), associating with particular brands and 
retailers online (20 percent), and purchasing directly through 
social media (16 percent) (see Figure 5.30).

 Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (1998) 
 In 1998, Congress passed the Children’s Online Privacy Protec-
tion Act (COPPA) to require commercial websites to gain parental 
consent before collecting, using, and/or disclosing information from 
children under the age of 13. Th e act gives parents control over the 
information that is collected about their children online. Th e act 
also outlines the contents of a privacy policy, including the respon-
sibility of a website operator to protect the privacy and safety of 
children on their sites. 
 (1) In general 
 It is unlawful for an operator of a website or online service 
directed to children, or any operator that has actual knowledge 
that it is collecting personal information from a child, to col-
lect personal information from a child in a manner that violates 
the regulations prescribed under subsection (b).

 Barack Obama, “It Gets Better” (2010) 
 Th e It Gets Better Project helps lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans-
gender (LGBT) youth deal with bullying and harassment by pro-
viding encouraging video messages that describe how the future 
will be much better for them. In a video posted on the organiza-
tion’s website, President Obama provides a message of hope and 
support to LGBT victims of bullying in the wake of several tragic 
suicides.  
 Like all of you, I was shocked and saddened by the deaths of 
several young people who were bullied and taunted for being 
gay, and who ultimately took their own lives. As a parent of two 
daughters, it breaks my heart. It’s something that just shouldn’t 
happen in this country. 
 We’ve got to dispel the myth that bullying is just a normal 
rite of passage—that it’s some inevitable part of growing up. It’s 
not. We have an obligation to ensure that our schools are safe 
for  all of our kids. And to every young person out there you 
need to know that if you’re in trouble, there are caring adults 
who can help. 
 I don’t know what it’s like to be picked on for being gay. 
But I do know what it’s like to grow up feeling that sometimes 
you don’t belong. It’s tough. And for a lot of kids, the sense 
of being alone or apart—I know can just wear on you. And 
when you’re teased or bullied, it can seem like somehow you 

 
Data and Documents 
303
brought it on yourself—for being diff erent, or for not fi tting 
in with everybody else. 
 But what I want to say is this. You are not alone. You didn’t 
do anything wrong. You didn’t do anything to deserve being 
bullied. And there is a whole world waiting for you, fi lled with 
possibilities. Th ere are people out there who love you and care 
about you just the way you are. And so, if you ever feel like 
because of bullying, because of what people are saying, that 
you’re getting down on yourself, you’ve got to make sure to 
reach out to people you trust. Whether it’s your parents, teach-
ers, folks that you know care about you just the way you are. 
You’ve got to reach out to them, don’t feel like you’re in this by 
yourself. 
 Th e other thing you need to know is, things will get better. 
And more than that, with time you’re going to see that your 
diff erences are a source of pride and a source of strength. You’ll 
look back on the struggles you’ve faced with compassion and 
wisdom. And that’s not just going to serve you, but it will help 
you get involved and make this country a better place. 
 It will mean that you’ll be more likely to help fi ght 
discrimination—not just against LGBT Americans, but dis-
crimination in all its forms. It means you’ll be more likely to 
understand personally and deeply why it’s so important that 
as adults we set an example in our own lives and that we treat 
everybody with respect. Th at we are able to see the world 
through other people’s eyes and stand in their shoes—that we 
never lose sight of what binds us together. 
 As a nation we’re founded on the belief that all of us are 
equal and each of us deserves the freedom to pursue our own 
version of happiness; to make the most of our talents; to speak 
our minds; to  not fi t in; most of all, to be true to ourselves. 
Th at’s the freedom that enriches all of us. Th at’s what America 
is all about. And every day, it gets better.

 Social Media in Disasters (2011) 
 Th e administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency 
(FEMA), Craig Fugate, testiﬁ ed to the Subcommittee on Disaster 
Recovery and Intergovernmental Aﬀ airs of the Senate Committee 
on Homeland Security and Governmental Aﬀ airs on the topic of 
using social media for communication purposes in the aftermath 
of a disaster. Fugate describes how social media can be an eﬀ ective 
tool in the toolbox for disaster management and communication. 
 Senator Pryor. At FEMA, do you all have people in offi  ce that 
are doing your social media focus here? Or is this just part of 
your overall eff ort, or do you have to have folks that actually 
focus on this? 
 Mr. Fugate. We do have dedicated staff  that are working on 
what we call digital engagement. Initially, when I got to FEMA, 
the Web page, using things like YouTube to post update vid-
eos, and beginning to do partnerships with Facebook where we 
would do joint Facebook pages per disaster with the State to 
share information to the public. 
 When I got there, one of the things that I asked early on was 
to begin tweeting, which I had done in the State of Florida, so 
I now tweet “@CraigatFEMA.” I actually do my own tweets. 
So many people keep asking me, Who does your tweets? I am, 
like, I do not have staff  to tweet, I tweet. And I do not tweet 
about me; I tweet about things that I think are interesting. 
 A lot of the people that I communicate with are my peers 
and practitioners. It is actually interesting. Not only is this 
useful in disasters, but it is helping build a community in the 
emergency management that traditionally had to go to course 
or conferences to see and hear across the Nation ideas. Th ere 
are things that, when you get into the nomenclature of all of 
these terms, concept of what a hashtag is in Twitter, what it 
is, it is something that you build into a message that you can 

 
Data and Documents 
305
link on that can take—-everybody who uses that tag can link 
everybody else’s messages together, so very early emergence in 
the emergency management community that are asking these 
very questions about social media applications is a pound sign, 
social media emergency management (SMEM). Th at is not led 
by FEMA, but we have staff  that participate. 
 But this is the conversation taking place with local emer-
gency managers, States, volunteers, researchers, the private sec-
tor, and we have never had those kind of—we never saw that 
interaction outside of conference settings or courses, which was 
limited. 
 So we have a centrally directed eff ort, but it also is underly-
ing some key principles, is give information all the way from 
high bandwidth to low bandwidth to in-person. We cannot 
forget there are people who do not use social media. But com-
municate and provide tools the way people are communicating 
and using those tools, not limit them to what is just easy for us 
to administer. 
 Senator Pryor. All right. You may not have this available, but 
do you have examples of how social media has actually saved 
lives? 
 Mr. Fugate. Th ere are examples. I think you are going to have 
some people in the next hearing that will talk about this. But 
some of the examples in Haiti where the wireless infrastructure 
came back on rather quickly, as people were trapped in debris 
and rubble and you did not have a centralized government sys-
tem to receive those calls because of extreme damages to both 
the government of Haiti and to the United Nations, people 
were able to get out text messages that were being received by 
people outside the area. Th ey were able to fi gure out where 
those people were, approximately, based upon the towers and 
went back and worked with the cell providers. And I think 
you are going to hear stories about how a lot of volunteers 
and people with a lot of technology experience were able to 
start mapping and providing data in a way that it allowed the 
United Nations (U.N.) and other forces from the United States 

306 
Social Media 
Agency for International Development (USAID) to get Urban 
Search and Rescue (US&R) Teams and other resources where 
needed. And that was just one example in a country that many 
of us were kind of taken aback on the devastation, but also the 
resiliency of the Haitians themselves and how much mobile 
technology had actually been integrated into their country 
prior to the earthquake. 
 Senator Pryor. And I think back to Hurricane Katrina, and 
I think about all those folks in the Superdome and other places, 
and I guess—was the wireless network up and running at that 
point? You may not know this, but was it up and running in 
those early days? 
 Mr. Fugate. Mr. Chairman, I really do not know, but it 
is something that—one of the things we have learned in my 
experience in 2004 and 2005—and I do not know if we have 
any of the wireless operators that could provide this informa-
tion. But it has been my observation that the industry learned 
from those events and how it worked very hard to get in addi-
tional resources to both bring back up wireless but also increase 
capacity. We saw this in the tornadoes where they brought in 
additional equipment and worked to get cell coverage back up, 
get wireless back up. And because of that, we have seen—and, 
again, I kind of look at Haiti as a lesson learned. We actu-
ally were assuming until Haiti that wireless communications in 
areas of devastation would be unreliable and we really would 
not need to plan for it. Haiti taught me that the industry has 
learned and is becoming more resilient, and oftentimes it will 
probably be for many people in the public the fi rst communi-
cation that comes back up is going to be the wireless services. 
 . . . 
 Mr. Fugate. Mr. Chairman, some of my peers now equate 
the wireless combined with social media as a revolution in 
emergency management as powerful as wireless was to original 
public safety radio systems, except now this is far more reach-
ing in the ability to communicate with the public. And so as 

 
Data and Documents 
307
we see this, again, I think our role here at FEMA is to keep up 
with the public and not necessarily fall back into what I call 
innovation at the speed of government, but really look to the 
technology industry, and as Senator Brown said, I have had the 
opportunity to go to Google, I have been to Facebook, I have 
been to Twitter, and really looking into their insights of how 
we better utilize the private sector as part of the team and not 
try to re-create things that they do better than us, but use those 
tools to better communicate and listen to the public as we deal 
with disasters. 
 Senator Pryor. Is it your impression that during a disaster 
the public will fi nd you using social media? Or do they know 
where to go? 
 Mr. Fugate. No, sir. Again, those people that have had disas-
ters do not, and so this is why we work so hard. And I appreci-
ate every time—this is pretty much the drill, is to get people 
to register with FEMA, get the information out there. So it is 
always for us important to get people to know where they can 
get that information. Part of this is working with the States, 
things like joint Facebook pages. But I think, by and large, 
most people are not thinking about FEMA, and that is why 
trying to build systems that are government-specifi c tend to 
fail. It is our ability to use the tools they are using and then 
direct them to things they are used to using. I mean, if you 
think about it, when we tell people to go to a Web page that is 
our typical Federal Web page, it is not easy to fi nd the informa-
tion in a disaster. Th at is why we built the mobile page so that 
when you send them there, it is strictly about disaster informa-
tion that they need, not, the traditional way that we oftentimes 
put information on a Web page.

 Nebraska Workplace Privacy Act (2016) 
 Th e Nebraska Workplace Privacy Act is one of many similar state 
laws that prevent employers from requiring passwords to personal 
social media accounts to either gain employment or retain a job. 
Th e state legislature passed the act without any opposition votes 
and governor Pete Ricketts signed the bill on April 19, 2016. 
 A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to employment; to adopt the 
Workplace Privacy Act; and to provide severability. 
 Be it enacted by the people of the State of Nebraska, 
 . . . 
 Sec. 3. No employer shall: 
 (1)  Require or request that an employee or applicant provide 
or disclose any user name or password or any other related

electronic communication device; 
 (2)  Require or request that an employee or applicant log into 
a personal Internet account by way of an electronic com-

an employee or applicant because the employee or applicant: 
 (1) Files a complaint under the Workplace Privacy Act; or 
 (2)  Testifi es, assists, or participates in an investigation, pro-

 Facebook Suppressing Conservative Views (2016) 
 In an interview with Gizmodo, a former Facebook contractor de-
scribed how his team was required by supervisors to suppress cer-
tain stories from the trending news module. Th e suppressed stories 

312 
Social Media 
tended to have a conservative bent, such as stories about Republi-
can Wisconsin governor Scott Walker or stories from the conserva-
tive website Drudge Report. Th e claims led the Senate to launch 
an inquiry into the matter. Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Tex.) read a 
statement about his concerns to the House of Representatives. 
 Mr. SMITH of Texas. Madam Speaker, recently, it was revealed 
that the tech giant Facebook may have altered its popular trend-
ing news section to suppress conservative views. Facebook’s 
CEO promised to make changes. 
 Now it has been reported that Facebook removed a viral 
video that showed how media company NowTh is was editing 
footage of Donald Trump to make him seem insensitive and 
racist. And last week, a gun range owner in Houston, Texas, 
said his Facebook page had been blocked after he advertised 
free concealed handgun classes. 
 If these allegations are true, Facebook will not be a credible 
source of information for the American people. Let’s hope that 
Facebook will demonstrate it has no bias against conservatives.

can be sold. For example, while a brick-and-mortar book-
store can only stock best-selling books, an online store 
that is not restricted by space can off er a wider catalog and 
sell niche products to smaller groups of readers, resulting 
in increased overall sales.
