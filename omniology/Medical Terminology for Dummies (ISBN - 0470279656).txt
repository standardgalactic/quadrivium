and even pharmacies. This is a personal grand tour through not only the 
world of medical terminology, but also through your own body.
You’ll find as you read this book that learning medical terms is a two-part 
proposition. First, you’ve got to master the landscape of language itself. Don’t 
worry, though — there will be no quiz. We just want you to better understand 
how to both create and break down words. Once you get to know more about 
prefixes, suffixes, and root words, you can do darn near anything with the 
terminology. For example, you can go inside the body to discover the terms 
that match up with different systems, diseases, procedures, and pharmaceu-
tical products.
Mastering medical terminology involves more than just memorizing. 
Exploring these terms and how they can be created will unlock not only med-
ical mysteries for you, but great opportunities as well.
About This Book
Getting to know the world of medical terminology can get a bit repetitive 
at times. That’s why we decided to break the book down into several parts 
about all kinds of different things. You start by getting the back story of 
terminology — the history and the players involved with bringing this “lan-
guage” to the masses. Then you get into the nitty-gritty of how words are 
formed and all about word parts, usage, pronunciation, and recognition. 
Finally, you take a gander at all the different body systems and the words 
associated with them. We even threw in some bonus top ten lists at the end 
that we hope you find useful.
There’s a lot to learn about medical terminology, we admit, but we’ll be right 
there with you for the whole wild, crazy ride.
Keep in mind that this is not a giant textbook of terms, nor is it a dictionary. 
Those are both great resources, and we recommend you pick up both if you 
are a medical professional. This is a friendly take on the topic, and our main

Medical Terminology For Dummies 
goal is to show you the basics of how these words are made so that you can 
go out in the big, bad world and master the creation and use of medical terms 
on your own terms. We’re not giving you a fish, we’re teaching you to fish. 
Conventions Used in This Book
Truly, the best way to make sense of terminology (because it is like a lan-
guage of its own in many respects) is to approach it as you would a foreign 
language. But we want you to feel comfortable with the concept of how a 
term is formed before you get crazy with your flashcards and recall devices. 
That’s why you see many chapters about language and medical terminology’s 
place in it. 
You will notice we also make extensive use of lists in this book. We do this 
for your sanity. Be honest: Wouldn’t you rather be able to study these terms 
in organized, easy-to-find lists and tables rather than picking through long, 
boring paragraphs trying to find the words you need to learn? We thought so. 
Once you get the hang of medical terms and how they are formed, we 
change gears a little bit and jump right into the systems of the body. Each 
system chapter tells you a bit about how that particular body system works, 
to give you some context for its words. We aren’t doctors, so we try our best 
to explain things using simple language. That means you might see words 
like pee and poo from time to time. We figure you’re knee-deep in official-
sounding terms here, so it doesn’t hurt to lighten up once in a while.
As we said, there are a lot of lists. But in the text, we try and put new terms in 
italics where we define them, to make them easier to spot.
Don’t be alarmed by those little pictures you see peppering the pages of this 
book. Feel free to be distracted, however — that’s the point. We want you 
to stop and look at these great kernels of knowledge as you go through the 
book. 
 
Marks concrete tips and tricks that you can put to use in giving you more 
control over your financial life.
 
Highlights passages that are good to keep in mind when mastering medical 
terminology.
 
Alerts you to common mistakes that can trip you up in your medical 
terminology studies.

This icon indicates you are about to read an interesting tidbit about the Greek 
heritage behind the terms you are learning.
 
Ditto here. This icon points you back to the Latin roots that helped make 
these terms possible.

discussion at hand.
Foolish Assumptions
We are assuming you fall into one of these categories:
 
✓ A medical student hoping to get a jumpstart on general terminology 
before that first big quiz.
 
✓ A medical professional looking to brush up on terms if you’re a bit out of 
practice or just want to know more about how these terms are made.
 
✓ A curious adult interested in speaking your doctor’s language and learn-
ing more about the terms that describe how your body functions. 
No matter what possessed you to pick up this book, we hope it gives you the 
terminology boost you need for your particular circumstances. The human 
body has hundreds and hundreds of working parts, and they all have names. 
Moreover, there are names for all kinds of associated terms relating to func-
tions, conditions, diseases, pathology, and even pharmacology. It’s a whole 
lot, we grant you. But you are eager, right? And no amount of 50-cent words 
frighten you away from your goal: to become a medical terminology Zen 
master. You can do it, Grasshopper.
How This Book Is Organized
We don’t mess around with much extraneous here in For Dummies land. You 
want to know the most important info in a friendly, easy-to-read manner, and 
we want to give it to you. Everybody wins.
This book starts at the most logical beginning, the background of medical ter-
minology, and gets into where it all came from, who had a hand in develop-
ing it, and how it morphed into the modern version we use today. Then, you 

4
Medical Terminology For Dummies 
revisit grammar school briefly and read about word parts, their meanings, 
and how they all work together to make a cohesive word. If you hated gram-
mar in school, don’t fear. It isn’t painful, and we think you’ll find it interesting 
to read the story behind the terms. We promise: Words you may have taken 
for granted will reveal themselves in a whole new light, and, as a result, your 
“aha!” light bulb will be going off a lot.
Once that happens, the book takes you right into the human body for a grand 
tour of systems and the terms that go with them. Finally, you’ll wind down 
with some useful top ten lists of great resources, word-building activities, and 
recall devices. By the time you turn that last page, we know you’ll feel confi-
dent and ready to talk root words and eponyms with the best of them.
Part I: Living for Linguistics 
To start your journey, you’ll jump into the history of medical terminology 
and find out a bit about how the whole big, crazy mess evolved into some-
thing people use everyday in doctor’s offices, hospitals, clinics, insurance 
and billing companies, and even pharmacies. 
Believe it or not, medical terms didn’t just magically appear on tablets 
dropped from the sky. Someone put a great deal of thought into how they 
would be created. You’ll find out all about the Greeks, the Romans, and even 
more modern medical gurus for whom many terms are named. 
Once you get a little history under your belt, you will get familiar with the 
basic three building blocks of words: roots, prefixes, and suffixes. You can 
mix and match these like a shell game and get a different word every time. 
You’ll wrap up your terminology basic training by taking a look at pronuncia-
tion, usage, plurals, and multiples.
Part II: Mapping Words and Bodies
Here’s where you start to fine-tune your terminology skills. This part takes 
you through the vast world of prefixes, suffixes, and how words are formed. 
Before you know it, you’ll be amazing your friends with all your word-building 
party tricks. And, just like mapping a word, you can start to think more about 
how those terms relate to the universe that is your body. You hit some quick 
highlights of your body’s systems and functions, learning how they work 
together, before moving on to some more detailed explanations of the terms 
associated with those systems.

 Introduction
Part III: In Terms of Anatomy 
This is where the fun starts, the big daddy chapters in which you find out all 
about different body systems and the words that help describe them. From 
your infrastructure (also known around some parts as your skeletal system) 
to your muscles, senses, and integumentary (a fancy word for hair, skin, and 
nails) system, you’ll find hundreds of words and word parts used to describe 
them. Here you read about many of them in terms of basic description, 
pathology, testing and procedures, and pharmacology. 
Part IV: Let’s Get Some Physiology 
Terminology
Keeping up with the internal dynamics of medical terms, you move on to 
body systems that are a bit more physiological. The heart — literally — of 
the operation is your cardiovascular system. It’s helped out by your respira-
tory system, which helps you breathe and provides oxygen to the blood. The 
gastrointestinal system is full of words describing how what you eat becomes 
what you expel. All your hormones and crazy chemicals are kept in check by 
your endocrine system, while your nervous system also pitches in to manage 
body chemicals and reactions. Your body is like a giant circus, and the terms 
used to describe it are the fliers you follow to make sense of it all.
Part V: Name That Plumbing
Call us crazy, but we think your pee and babymaking parts are important 
enough for a whole part in this book. Hey, why not dedicate some major 
space to the systems that purge your body of toxins and provide the key to 
maintaining the world population? Reading this part, you get to know every-
thing you always wanted to about your urinary tract and then — hang on to 
your hat — you get a refresher course in Sex Ed. Of course, there are tons of 
terms to help you along the way and, like the other systems, they describe 
body parts, conditions, diseases, procedures, and drugs.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
Just to make sure you’ve covered all the bases, be sure to check out this part 
that is chock-full of fun tidbits. We cover where to look for great resources, 
fun word-building activities, and some commonly used mnemonic devices.

Medical Terminology For Dummies 
Where to Go from Here
By all means, if you’re feeling spunky you can jump right into this book at any 
point and start working on your terminology savvy. Mastering the how and 
why of medical terms is sometimes as important as learning the terms them-
selves, which is why we put those chapters first. But by all means, feel free to 
hunt and peck the sections that are most useful to you.
Be bold. Be brave. And, most importantly, proceed through this book with 
confidence. Once you get the hang of how these words are made, you’ll have 
no problem committing them to memory and to your daily life.

D
id you realize that when you picked up this book, you were begin-
ning a journey into a whole new language? Don’t worry — you haven’t 
grabbed Greek For Dummies by mistake — it’s all English, or at least 
“English.” But once you get deep into the world of medical terms, you will 
find that it is a whole new way of speaking. Your journey will indeed take you 
to ancient Greece as well as to Rome. You will meet some of the pioneers of 
the medical world. You will gain entrance into a whole new world: your body. 
All of those confusing terms you hear on Grey’s Anatomy will soon become 
second nature to you, and pretty soon you’ll be whipping out 50-cent words 
like a seasoned medical professional.
The Tale Behind the Terms
Medical terminology is made up of the terms that describe human anatomy 
and physiology (body organs, systems, and their functions), body locations, 
diseases, clinical, diagnostic imaging, and laboratory testing, together with 
clinical procedures, surgeries, and diagnoses. 
It’s important for every one of these things to have a specific name — just 
as it’s important that you have your own unique name — because otherwise 
how would medical professionals be able to communicate clearly with one 

10
Part I: Living for Linguistics 
another? You might be able to visit your doctor and say, “I have a pain in my 
shoulder,” and have him solve the mystery of what is causing that pain. But 
when your doc communicates that information to, say, a surgeon, it’s crucial 
to be more specific. There are many working parts to your shoulder, after all, 
so you wouldn’t want the surgeon to try and fix something that’s not broken. 
When your doctor tells the surgeon the problem is with the rotator cuff, they 
are communicating much more clearly, and hopefully surgery and treatment 
will be a lot better. 
The beauty of medical terminology is that it makes such vital communication 
more succinct and to-the-point. A medical term usually describes in one word 
a disease or condition that, under normal circumstances, would take several 
words to describe. Appendectomy is a one-word medical term to describe 
“surgical removal of the appendix.” Now that saves you plenty of breath for 
more important things, like singing an aria or rooting for the Colts. 
You can thank the Greeks and Romans for getting the ball rolling with regard 
to terminology, Hippocrates and Aristotle especially. Over 2,000 years ago, 
they saw the need for specific, descriptive medical language and began to 
create words that matched body parts and functions. Now, although you may 
secretly curse them as you study for your terminology final, you should also 
take the time to thank them for saving us a world of confusion. 
The foundation of medical terminology is based in both Greek and Latin 
origin. The Greeks were the founders of modern medicine, but Latin is the 
basic source of medical terms. With origins in ancient Rome, Latin quickly 
made its way through the world, solidifying its rep as the language of choice 
for medicine and science. Building on guidance from the Greek and Latin 
origins, medical terms began to be professionalized in the mid-1800s. The 
first medical dictionary appeared in the 1830s shortly after the first edition of 
Webster’s American Dictionary of the English Language. 
Making Terminology Work for You
Thankfully, there are ways to wade through the quagmire of medical terms 
and figure out how to pronounce and use them like a champ. But you have 
to start at the beginning by breaking down the parts of each word and then 
deciphering its meaning. Or, to put it in a fancy-schmancy way, you should 
use etymology. Etymology helps you find the origin and historical develop-
ment of a term. You can use etymology to decipher words with Latin and 
Greek origins, eponyms (words named after people), and acronyms (modern 
language terms that stand for longer phrases).

11
 Chapter 1: Scrubbing In to Master Medical Terminology
Back to those word parts that you’ll break down. There are three you need 
to know:
 
✓ Roots/combining forms
 
✓ Prefixes
 
✓ Suffixes
Roots are the glue that holds all medical terms together. They are the basic 
form around which the final word is formed. A combining form is a combin-
ing vowel (usually o or i) plus the root word, usually with a prefix or suffix 
added. Prefixes appear at the beginning of a word and tell the how, why, 
where, when, how much, how many, position, direction, time, or status. The 
suffix, always at the end of a word, usually indicates a procedure, a condition, 
or a disease. While the prefix gives us a clue into what to expect in a word’s 
meaning, the suffix tells us what is happening with a specific body part or 
system. And, usually, it either entails what is wrong with you or the proce-
dure used to diagnose or fix it. 
Oh, but we’re not done yet! In fact, the fun of medical terminology has just 
begun once you figure out the parts of each word. You can put words in 
plural form (which unfortunately involves way more than adding a simple s),
find out how to pronounce them, and — the big payoff — use them in the 
real world.
The breaking down of words that you will learn in this book also helps you 
with pronunciation. With medical terminology, sounds are not always pro-
nounced the same as in English, and there are no steadfast rules that a com-
bination of specific letters will always be pronounced in the same way. One 
thing that helps in both the standard English and medical worlds, though, 
is to learn how to pronounce phonetically, by breaking up the word into 
smaller parts.
There is an old saying that the only constant is change. With medical terms, 
the same rule applies. A rule that might work for pronouncing one word might 
not come close to working for any other word. Be ready to be flexible, because 
what may seem familiar to you from everyday English might take on a whole 
new sound as a medical term. Once you can open your mind to all of the pos-
sibilities, you’ll enter a whole new world of understanding terminology.

12
Part I: Living for Linguistics 
Building a Foundation of Vocabulary
Getting the basics of word formation and pronunciation down pat is the 
hard part. Once you can do that, you can move on to building your word 
vocabulary. Even though medical professionals like to joke that terminology 
is like a foreign language (sometimes, yes), don’t throw this book out the 
window just yet. The good news is that you probably already know a lot of 
medical terms and you can use those to build up the rest of your newfound 
vocabulary. New terms become easier once you know the reasoning behind 
most medical terms. 
Remember your grade school days when you used all kinds of little tricks to 
remember things like multiplication tables and the state capitals? The same 
principle applies to new medical terms. You can make lists of word parts, 
list words by similar sound, map words, or memorize terms by body system. 
And those are just a few ideas. Do whatever works for you, even if it’s singing 
terms to the tune of “Sunrise, Sunset” in the shower. We promise not to tell. 
In Terms of Anatomy 
For our purposes in the land of medical terms, we can compare anatomy to 
the infrastructure of a building. The walls, floors, bricks, plaster, electrical 
system, plumbing, and so forth all help keep the building working for the 
people who inhabit it. Your body’s anatomy is no different, which is why you 
are going to read about these particular terms first. Once you get the basics 
of what holds your body together, you can go on to find out about the physi-
ological systems that make your body react to both internal and external 
circumstances. 
First on our anatomy checklist is the skeletal system. This is your body’s 
frame, much like the frame of a building. This system, along with its joints, 
works together with the muscles to give you the support and movement you 
need every day. The bony skeleton provides the jointed framework for the 
body, giving it shape. This framework protects vital organs from external 
injury and provides attachment points for muscles, ligaments, and tendons to 
make body movement possible. 
Working together with the skeleton is the muscular system, in which several 
different major muscle groups work together. Made up of over 600 muscles 
and joints, this system is responsible for movement. The skeleton provides 
attachment points and support for muscles, but it is the muscle tissue’s abil-
ity to extend and contract that makes movement possible. 

13
 Chapter 1: Scrubbing In to Master Medical Terminology
Covering all this infrastructure is the integumentary system. Your skin, 
glands, nails, and hair work like the façade, or outside covering, of a build-
ing. They are the things people see when they look at you. The outside of 
your “building” often shows the world how healthy the rest of your body is. 
Healthy skin, along with accessory organs glands, hair, and nails, are the hall-
marks of healthy insides, so care for them accordingly. Think of this as you 
would apartment shopping. If the outside of the building looks shoddy, would 
you want to move in? 
Your sensory system is all of the “fun stuff” in your building. The windows, 
amenities, sound system, and dining facility all bring aesthetic delight to the 
building’s inhabitants, and your senses work in a similar fashion. Your eyes 
are the windows to your world. Everything you see from your own face in the 
mirror each morning to the sight of the most beautiful sunset comes to you 
courtesy of those peepers. The smell of baking bread, the feel of a fine cash-
mere sweater, the taste of a great vintage wine, and the sound of a child’s 
laughter are all made possible by your senses. 
It may be hard to imagine that words can describe all of the amazing things 
your anatomy can do, but believe us when we say that it’s all possible 
through terminology. And who knows? Perhaps there’s a word out there that 
hasn’t been created yet that you will coin using what you learn here.
All Systems Go
Once you get those basic working parts ingrained in your brain, you will 
move on to the physiology terminology. Physiology deals with the remaining 
body systems that help your fabulous body do its day-to-day work. 
First up is the thing that keeps your blood pumping and your life moving 
forward each day: your heart. More specifically, the cardiovascular system. 
Your heart does not work in a vacuum. It has supporting players, namely 
your blood cells and vessels. These parts all work together to supply your 
body with fresh, clean, oxygenated blood.
Then there is the separate but complementary lymphatic system that works 
to flush your body of impurities. Most directly associated with immunity, the 
lymphatic system works in the same context as the cardiovascular system 
due to the similar makeup of the system and the fact that, once cleaned by 
the lymph nodes, lymphatic fluid is released directly into the bloodstream. 
Lymph vessels are arranged in a similar pattern as the blood vessels. 

14
Part I: Living for Linguistics 
Speaking of oxygenating your blood, think about how that oxygen finds its 
way into your body. You may not consciously think about it every day, but 
breathing makes it all possible. The body’s trillions of cells need oxygen and 
must get rid of carbon monoxide, and this exchange of gases is accomplished 
by the respiratory system. External respiration is the repetitive, unconscious 
exchange of air between the lungs and the external environment.
You have to breathe, but you also have to eat, and eating is way more fun. 
Your good buddy the gastrointestinal system helps turn those tasty meals 
and treats into usable energy for your body. Also called the alimentary or 
digestive tract, this system provides a tube-like passage through a maze of 
organs and body cavities, beginning at the mouth, the food entrance into 
the body, and ending at the anus, where solid waste material exits the body. 
Voilá! Your delicious Chinese takeout magically turns into . . . well, you know.
Moving on, the complicated endocrine system maintains the chemical bal-
ance of the body. It does this by sending chemical messengers called hor-
mones throughout the body via the bloodstream. Hormones regulate and 
control activity of specific cells or organs. Slowly released hormones control 
organs from a distance. Endocrine glands are located in different parts of 
the body. They are said to be ductless, because they have no duct system to 
transport their secretions. Instead, hormones are released directly into the 
bloodstream to regulate a variety of functions of body organs. One can stimu-
late growth, another matures sex organs, and yet another controls metabo-
lism. Your body has both central and peripheral glands. 
Even more complicated (are we having fun yet?) is the nervous system. 
Working like the body’s built-in computer system, it is far more complex than 
your laptop. Messages from the brain are relayed via the spinal cord through 
nerve fibers that provide connections for incoming and outgoing data. The 
body has more than ten billion nerve cells whose function is to coordinate 
activities of the body. This system controls our voluntary activities as well as 
involuntary activities. We speak, hear, taste, see, think, move muscles, and 
have glands that secrete hormones. We respond to pain, danger, tempera-
ture, and touch. We have memory, association, and discrimination. These 
functions are only a small part of what the nervous system controls.
The nervous system is made up of the central nervous system (CNS), which 
includes the brain and spinal cord. The peripheral nervous system (PNS) is 
composed of cranial nerves (that extend from the brain) and spinal nerves 
(that extend from the spinal cord). The autonomic nervous system (ANS) 
controls and coordinates the functions of the body’s vital organs, such as 
heartbeat and rate of breathing — functions we don’t even think about.

Down Under Details
Speaking of things you don’t usually think about, the urinary system is made 
up of the kidneys (two), ureters (also two), bladder, and urethra. This sys-
tem’s main function is to remove urea (the nitrogenous waste products of 
metabolism) from the bloodstream, and excrete it in urine from the body. 
Nitrogenous waste is difficult to excrete from the body. The main function of 
the urinary system is to remove urea from the bloodstream.
Urea is formed in the liver from ammonia. The bloodstream carries it (in the 
same manner as hormones and lymph) to the kidneys, where it passes with 
water, salts, and acids out of the bloodstream into the kidneys. The kidneys 
produce the urine that travels through each ureter into the bladder to be 
excreted via the urethra. Now that’s a whole lot of information to impress 
your friends with at a dinner party. On second thought, maybe not. 
When food and oxygen combine in cells to produce energy, the process is 
known as catabolism. In the process, food and oxygen are not destroyed, 
but small particles making up the food and oxygen are rearranged in a new 
combination, and the results are waste products. Waste in the form of gas 
(carbon dioxide) is removed from the body by exhaling through the lungs. 
Think about how you were made. No, you weren’t discovered under a cab-
bage leaf. Your mom and dad made you (see Sex For Dummies if you don’t 
get our drift here) using their reproductive systems. In the male, it has two 
main functions: to produce spermatozoa, the male reproductive cell, and to 
secrete testosterone, the male hormone. The reproductive organs, or gonads, 
are the testes. They are supported by accessory organs, ducts, glands, and 
supportive structures. The ducts include the epididymides (epididymis-
singular) vas deferens, ejaculatory ducts, and the urethra. Glands include 
seminal vesicles, prostate, and bulbourethral glands (or Cowper’s glands). 
The supporting structures include the penis, scrotum, and spermatic cords. 
That’s a lot of moving parts.
The female reproductive system produces the female reproductive cell, or 
sex cell, secretes the hormones estrogen and progesterone, and provides 
the conditions to establish a pregnancy, together with providing a safe place 
for the pregnancy to develop and grow. The gonads (ovaries in the female), 
together with the internal accessory organs consisting of the fallopian (uter-
ine) tubes, uterus, vagina, external genitalia, and breasts (mammary glands) 
make up the reproductive system in the female. Reproduction is achieved by 
the union of the female reproductive cell, an ovum, and the male reproduc-
tive cell, a spermatozoon (sperm for short), resulting in fertilization.

The How and Why
In This Chapter

▶ Tracking the evolution of terminology
▶ Exploring Greek and Latin roots
R
epeat after us: Context is a good thing.
You love context. Mmmmm, context. It is a good idea to get to know some-
thing about your subject matter before you dive head-first into studying it. 
This is particularly true with medical terminology because so much of the 
theory and history behind this topic shows up in the actual words and terms 
you will use every day.
Defining Medical Terminology
First, let’s ponder what medical terminology is. It’s a whole lot more than 
just medical words and phrases. Each word and each term is organic, mean-
ing you can trace each part of the word back to a specific meaning. Cobbled 
together, these little meanings make up the overall meaning of the word. 
Medical terminology is made up of terms that describe human anatomy and 
physiology (body organs, systems, and their functions), body locations, dis-
eases, diagnostic imaging and laboratory testing, together with clinical proce-
dures, surgeries, and diagnoses.
Why do we need medical terminology?
 
A medical term usually describes in one word a disease or condition that, 
under normal circumstances, would take several words to describe.

18
Part I: Living for Linguistics 
For example, consider two terms commonly known to most people. Tonsillitis 
is a one-word medical term to describe “inflammation of the tonsils,” and 
appendectomy is a one-word medical term to describe “surgical removal 
of the appendix.” It’s much easier to use one word than a long, drawn-out 
phrase to describe these conditions, don’t you think? 
Using Medical Terminology 
in the Real World
The need or desire to learn medical terminology is not limited to the health-
care professionals. For example, a firefighter has to relay information to para-
medics, such as the condition of a burn victim being placed in an ambulance. 
A police officer must complete a written report after delivering a baby in the 
back seat of a car. Or closer to home, think about trying to understand when 
a doctor tells you that your child needs surgery, or why an aging parent 
needs to be placed in a long-term care facility. 
Sprechen Sie terminology?
Medical terminology is like a foreign language 
to most people. In fact, it operates exactly like a 
foreign language if you have never encountered 
it before. There are so many words that are dif-
ficult to pronounce and even more difficult to 
spell correctly. As such, medical terms sound 
strange, confusing, and sometimes overwhelm-
ing to the novice. They make no sense whatso-
ever. But as in a foreign country, you can’t make 
out what is happening until you can speak the 
language.
Just as with practicing German (or any lan-
guage, for that matter), you get the meaning 
of medical terms by breaking down each word 
into different parts:
 ✓ Prefix: Appears at the beginning of a word 
and tells the how, why, where, when, how 
much, how many, position, direction, time, 
or status.
 ✓ Root word: Specifies the body part to which 
the term refers.
 ✓ Suffix: Appears at the end of a word and 
indicates a procedure, condition, or dis-
ease
Those are the bare bones, basic parts of every 
medical term. Each prefix, root, and suffix has 
its own meaning, so it’s your job to remember 
them and put the three meanings together into 
one greater word meaning. It can be tricky, 
though, so proceed carefully until you are con-
fident of individual part meanings.
As with languages, things aren’t always what 
they seem. For example, if we use tonsilli-
tis and appendectomy, we see that the suffix 
-itis always means ”inflammation,” no matter 
what root word precedes it. Similarly, the suffix 
-ectomy always means “surgical removal of.” 
So when switching suffixes, appendicitis means 
“inflammation of the appendix,” and tonsillec-
tomy means “surgical removal of the tonsils.”

 Chapter 2: Medical Terminology: The How and Why
And of course the best thing of all about medical terminology is that it allows 
you to convey the greatest quantity of information, with the least confusion 
and most precision, to anyone in the world. For example, saying someone has 
a badly broken wrist doesn’t convey as much as saying someone has a Salter-
Harris II fracture of the right digital radius with moderate lateral displace-
ment and 28 degrees of upward angulation. Now who’s the coolest kid in the 
clinic?
In theory and practice
You don’t need prior knowledge of Greek and Latin or anatomy and physiol-
ogy to build a medical vocabulary. But you do need to master the fundamen-
tals, or the ABCs, so to speak, to be comfortable and confident with medical 
terminology.
 
You accomplish this by breaking down each word and identifying its parts 
(prefix, suffix, and root). A basic knowledge of the human anatomy helps, but 
more important is to know how each body system works independently and 
together with other systems. Knowing that helps the puzzle pieces fit into 
place more easily.
Mastering medical terms is much easier than you think. It is certainly easier 
than acquiring a whole new language from scratch. You already know words 
like appendicitis and tonsillectomy. New terms become easier once you know 
the reasoning behind most medical terms. Many terms are made up of inter-
changeable parts, used over and over again, in different combinations. Once 
you understand this, you will be well on your way to translating even the 
toughest medical terms — including terms you have never heard or seen 
before. 
Your vocabulary will grow by leaps and bounds as you analyze medical 
terms, and you’ll find that this will become the key to your success. Root 
words, suffixes, and prefixes make up the basis for all terms. As with your 
ABCs, once you have these mastered, the sky is the limit.
Writing it down
One thing that gives some people pause with medical terminology is spell-
ing the words correctly. Again, defer to the rule of breaking down the word 
into parts. If you can spell each small prefix, root, or suffix and put them all 
together, then you can spell medical terms with ease.
 
One of the best ways to practice the spelling is, of course, to write it down. 

20
Part I: Living for Linguistics 
Whether you are a list maker or prefer to draw maps, there is a way for you 
to incorporate writing terms as spelling and word-recognition practice. Some 
useful ideas for writing and recalling terms are
 
✓ Make lists of similar prefixes, roots, and suffixes based on what body 
system they are associated with.
 
✓ Make lists of prefixes, suffixes, and roots based on some other memo-
rable moniker, such as sound similarity or similar meaning.
 
✓ Draw simple maps of each system and label body part terms.
 
✓ Use your body system map to identify diseases affecting each spe-
cific part. You can also use this technique to identify locations of 
specific procedures. 
 
Building a medical vocabulary involves breaking down a word by identify-
ing its prefix, suffix, and root word. The root word is the foundation or basic 
meaning of the word. It can appear with a prefix and suffix or between a prefix 
and suffix, as prefixes and suffixes never stand alone. They must be attached 
to a root word.
 
In this book we outline roots, suffixes, and prefixes and include the anatomy 
for each body system to help you to understand how everything fits together. 
When in doubt, look at the table of contents and check a specific body sys-
tem’s chapter.
Changes in Medical Terminology
Medical language is an entity unto itself and followed a historical develop-
ment. Common medical vocabulary used today includes terms built from 
Greek and Latin word parts, some of which were used by Hippocrates and 
Aristotle more than 2,000 years ago. That’s quite an extensive pedigree, and 
one that only continued to build as time flew by, right into the modern age.
 
One type of medical term is the eponym, a term named after the personal 
name of someone. An example would be Parkinson’s disease, named after the 
English physician Dr. James Parkinson.
With the great advancements in medicine throughout the 20th century, medi-
cal language changed with the times and continues to do so today. Some 
words are discarded or considered obsolete, whereas others are changed, 
and new words are continually added. 
Building on guidance from the Greek and Latin origins, medical terms 
began to be professionalized in the mid-1800s. Dorland’s Illustrated Medical 
Dictionary was first published in 1890 as the American Illustrated Medical 
Dictionary, consisting of 770 pages, over 50 years after the first edition of 
Webster’s American Dictionary of the English Language. Dr. William Alexander 

21
 Chapter 2: Medical Terminology: The How and Why
Dorland was the editor, and when he died in 1956 the dictionaries were 
renamed to include his name, thus they are known today as Dorland’s 
Illustrated Medical Dictionary. Electronic medical publishing took off during 
the 1980s thanks to advancements in database publishing and electronic stor-
age. In the mid 1990s, medical dictionaries — most notably from Dorland’s, 
Stedman’s, and Taber’s — became available in electronic form with many 
various editions and publications available on disk, CD-ROM, and via Internet 
downloading.
Now available in several formats including traditional print, CD-ROM, Web 
sites, databases, and even wall charts, medical dictionaries grow bigger with 
each new edition. Check out Chapter 24 for a list of great resources. The 
rapid increase in medical and scientific knowledge necessitates new medical 
vocabulary to describe it. Changes in medicine in the 20th century became 
apparent in the growing size of medical dictionaries. Knowledge about immu-
nology, antibodies, allergies, and viruses was in the infancy stage in early edi-
tions of dictionaries. 
It’s Greek and Latin to Me
You can thank the two founding fathers of medical terminology for getting 
the ball rolling: Hippocrates and Aristotle. Hippocrates, considered the 
father of medicine, was a student, teacher, and great physician. Aristotle was 
a Greek philosopher and a physical scientist. He stressed observation and 
induction. His major studies were of comparative anatomy and physiology. 
 
The Hippocratic Oath — an oath of professional behavior sworn by physicians 
beginning a medical career — is attributed to Hippocrates. 
The Greeks were the founders of modern medicine, but Latin is the basic 
source of medical terms. With origins in ancient Rome and thanks to good, 
old-fashioned conquest, Latin quickly made its way through the world, solidi-
fying its rep as the language of choice for medicine and science. You can 
still see evidence of Latin’s influence in several languages, from English and 
French to Italian and Spanish. 
When first confronted with medical terms, the average person is puzzled 
and often overwhelmed by the sometimes strange spelling and more so the 
pronunciation. This is understandable when approximately 75 percent of all 
medical terms are based on Latin or Greek terms. Most medical terms are 
derivatives of Latin and Greek, even though modern day changes are made to 
make the terms more comprehensive.
Look no further than the study of etymology to help you crack the code of 
medical terms. Etymology indicates the origin and historical development of a 
term. Some examples of etymology, or word history, include

22
Part I: Living for Linguistics 
 
✓ Words with Latin origins: Femur, for example, is a Latin term referring 
to a bone in the leg.
 
✓ Words with Greek origins: Hemorrhage, for example, is a word with 
Greek origin indicating a rapid, uncontrollable loss of blood.
 
✓ Eponyms: These are the words named after people, such as Parkinson’s 
disease.
 
✓ Acronyms: These are modern language terms that stand for longer 
phrases such as laser, which stands for “light amplification by stimu-
lated emission of radiation.”
Etymologies were listed in early medical dictionaries, assuming the reader 
had studied languages and could read Greek or Latin. But gradually the Greek 
alphabet was cast aside when it was later recognized that few, aside from 
specialists, were actually studying ancient Greek.
Modernizing Medicine
With the advent of the medical dictionary, terminology came to the masses 
with full force. Today, medical terminology has evolved into modern applica-
tions from basic anatomy to include alternative, holistic, naturopathic, and 
complementary medicine. Other modern applications of medical terminology 
include (but are certainly not limited to):
 
✓ CAT scans
 
✓ DNA advancement
 
✓ Hundreds of new drugs on the market to assist or alleviate a multitude 
of ailments
 
✓ Investigative and diagnostic medicine
 
✓ Joint replacements and other surgical procedures
 
✓ Laparoscopic surgeries
 
✓ MRIs
 
✓ Organ transplants
 
✓ Stem-cell research
Today medical terminology is used and needed in any occupation that is 
remotely related to medicine and the normal functioning of the body. 
To name a few careers involving the need for medical terminology:

23
 Chapter 2: Medical Terminology: The How and Why
 
✓ Athletic therapy
 
✓ Audiology
 
✓ Dentistry and dental hygiene
 
✓ Emergency medical services
 
✓ Exercise science
 
✓ Genetics
 
✓ Massage therapy
 
✓ Medical statistics
 
✓ Medical transcription
 
✓ Nutrition
 
✓ Occupational therapy
 
✓ Personal training
 
✓ Pharmacy
 
✓ Physical therapy
 
✓ Speech language
 
✓ Veterinary medicine
All these applications exist in addition to the obvious groups of healthcare 
professionals who use terminology in their day-to-day activities, including 
associates, the medical secretary in a doctor’s office, the insurance claims 
adjuster, the compensation board adjudicator, the courtroom recorder . . . 
the list goes on and on. Even the proofreader of a local newspaper needs to 
know a little medical terminology in order to keep that medical news article 
free of spelling errors.
We see evidence of changes everywhere. A large percentage of surgeries 
are now done laparoscopically (using a fiberoptic scope), and new surgical 
instruments are introduced almost daily. Cosmetically, in addition to plastic 
surgery, there are now Botox and fat redistribution procedures. A drug refer-
ence book is obsolete almost from publication, as more and more new drugs 
flood the market. There is always a new cough medicine to try or allergy pill 
to take. With every new medical discovery comes the medical terminology 
that describes it. The study continues to evolve, even as you read this book. 
 
The 31st Edition of Dorland’s Illustrated Medical Dictionary advertises that it 
contains around 125,000 entries. The 29th edition of this same dictionary con-
tains approximately 117,500 entries. That’s an addition of 7,500 new words in 
just one edition!

Prefixes, Roots, and Suffixes
In This Chapter

I
ntroducing the starting lineup for your medical terminology team! 
Whether you realize it or not, most words are made up of individual parts 
that contribute their own meaning. The big three — roots, prefixes, and suf-
fixes — of medical terms all work together to clue you in to what that word 
means. Often, they tell you where it comes from, too. 
Starting at center, you have the root. The root is the main part of the word, 
telling you in general the thing you are dealing with. The word root specifies 
the body part.
Playing forward is the prefix. A prefix appears at the beginning of a word and 
tells you more about the circumstances surrounding the meaning of the word.
The suffix would be the goalkeeper, to really stretch this metaphor. The suffix 
is always at the end of a word and, in the medical world, usually indicates a 
procedure, a condition, or a disease.
Almost every medical term can be broken down into some combination of 
prefixes, roots, and suffixes. Because they are the core of a word’s meaning, 
the root words are great in number. There are many more roots than prefixes 
and suffixes put together.

Rooting Around for Answers
So what makes the root of a word so darned important? Maybe it’s because 
the root lights the way to understanding the body system in question. The 
combining form, or word root, specifies the body part the word is either 
describing or associated with. Just by doing that, it helps rule out hundreds 
of other possibilities, allowing you to think only about a specific set of body 
parameters. 
In this section are two big lists of all the important roots that can appear 
after any prefix or before any suffix. They divide into two categories: exterior 
root words, which describe the exterior of the body, and interior root words, 
which deal with — you guessed it — the inside. These are the big daddies, 
the glue that holds all medical terms together. Think of this section as one-
stop shopping. If you can’t find your root word here, you won’t find it any-
where! We will not be undersold!

Copycats and opposites
Some prefixes might look very different, but 
have the same meaning. Here are some exam-
ples:
 ✓ Anti- and contra- mean against.
 ✓ Dys- and mal- mean bad or painful.
 ✓ Hyper-, supra-, and epi- all mean above.
 ✓ Hypo-, sub-, and infra- all mean below.
 ✓ Intra- and endo- mean within.
However, other, more troublesome prefixes 
mean the opposite of each other even though 
they look or sound similar. These are conten-
tious prefixes:
 ✓ Ab- means away from (abduct), but ad- 
means toward.
 ✓ Ante-, pre-, and pro- mean before, but post- 
means after.
 ✓ Hyper-, supra-, and epi- mean above, but 
hypo-, infra-, and sub- mean below.
 ✓ Macro- means large, while micro- means 
small.
 ✓ Tachy- means fast, but brady- means slow.
 ✓ Hyper- also means excessive, yet hypo- 
also means deficient.

33
 Chapter 3: Introducing the Big Three: Prefixes, Roots, and Suffixes
Prefix as Precursor
Think of the prefix as the welcome wagon for a term. It invites you in, wel-
coming you to a whole new world. It tells you something about what you 
are going to find inside. Prefixes and suffixes are modifiers or adjectives 
that alter the meaning of the root word, in the same ways as regular English 
terms. A prefix appears at the beginning of a word and tells the how, why, 
where, when, how much, how many, position, direction, time, or status.
 
An easy word-building activity is to use the prefixes you know and draw 
connections to medical terms you are familiar with. For example, you 
probably know that ultra- means something is extra, or beyond its normal 
scope. And you’re probably familiar with the word ultrasound, a procedure 
that provides — you guessed it — a look at your insides that is beyond 
the normal scope of visual exam. See? You’re a medical terminology whiz 
already. Okay, maybe I’m exaggerating slightly.
You might recognize many of the prefixes associated with medical terminol-
ogy, because they have similar meanings in regular, everyday vernacular. 
For example, the most basic prefix of a- means without, or not, in medical 
terminology, just as it does in any other word. If something is atypical, it is 
not typical. Hemi- means half, as in hemisphere. The moral of this story is that 
prefixes aren’t just window dressing. They have a unique and specific goal, 
which is to tell the reader more about the circumstances surrounding the 
word’s meaning. 
It’s just semantics
Take a moment to digest what exactly is 
meant by the word semantics. Semantics is, 
quite simply, the study of meaning in commu-
nication. 
Have you ever heard someone say, “Let’s drill 
down to semantics”? What they probably meant 
was that they wanted to discuss the actual 
meaning of whatever it was you were discuss-
ing. So, remember that when you are trying to 
decipher the meaning of a medical term, you do, 
in fact, want to talk semantics.
The word semantics is derived from the Greek 
semantikos, meaning “significant.”
This may be a book about medical terms, but 
we’re talking morphemes here, not morphine. 
A morpheme is the smallest linguistic unit that 
has semantic meaning. For example, un means 
not, or opposite. So the next time you look at 
a two-letter prefix and think it’s just window 
dressing, think again. Chances are it has plenty 
of important meaning.

Suffixes: Final Thoughts
The suffix, always at the end of a word, usually indicates a procedure, a con-
dition, or a disease. Whereas the prefix gives us a clue into what to expect in 
a word’s meaning, the suffix pulls no punches and tells us what is happening 
with a specific body part or system. And, usually, it either entails what is 
wrong medically or indicates the procedure used to diagnose or fix it. 
The scope of suffix meanings is extremely wide. Like prefixes, many of these 
have similar meanings in plain old, everyday English that you hear on the 
street. For example, the suffix -meter simply indicates an instrument used to 
measure something, just as it does in other fields of study. Geography, a term 
feared by many fifth graders the world over, ends with -graphy and means the 
process of recording. You’ll meet several other forms of -graphy in our medi-
cal term discussions.

Multiples, and Plurals — Oh My!

▶ Checking out acronyms, eponyms, and homonyms
▶ Discovering the common plural forms
▶ Applying different rules of pluralization to medical terms
A
fter you’ve got the basics under your belt, it’s time to branch out. 
Really branch out — in multiple directions. You might think that in 
medical terminology, multiples and plurals work just like they do for regular 
words in the English language.
Psych!
Read on to find out about the wily world of medical multiples.
Pluralized medical terms would be pretty easy to comprehend and remember 
if all examples followed the same rules. The fun (fun?) of the English language 
is that there seem to be just as many words that do not follow the rules as 
ones that do. To see this, all you have to do is look to some basic examples 
from everyday conversation.
Wouldn’t it be simple if the standard rule was to add an s to make a noun 
plural? One cat and one dog would then become two or more cats and dogs. 
Simple. How about one woman, one man, and one child? This pluralization 
becomes two or more women, men, and children. So much for simply adding 
the s.
For the most part, terms of Latin or Greek origin do not follow English rules 
when it comes to pluralizing. However, luckily for you, in modern current use 
it is becoming more and more acceptable for medical terms to be pluralized 
by the English method.
But first, let’s take a quick look at three common kinds of common medical 
terminology: acronyms, eponyms, and homonyms.

Acronyms
An acronym is a word (or abbreviation) formed by the first letters or syllables 
of other words. Most acronyms are expressed in uppercase letters, but not 
always. For example, you might be familiar with the words scuba and laser. 
These terms are so well known that they have become acceptable as words 
in their own right. Scuba began life as an acronym for self-contained underwa-
ter breathing apparatus. Laser was an acronym for light amplification by stimu-
lated emission of radiation. These two humble acronyms went on to greater 
glory as bona fide words. 
There are, to put it mildly, many acronyms in medical terminology, some of 
which are common, some not so common. It is important to know the con-
text in which they are used, because many are identical or sound similar, but 
have quite different meanings. Here are some common medical acronyms.
 
✓ AMA: American Medical Association
 
✓ AMA: Against medical advice
 
✓ CAT: Computerized axial tomography (scan)
 
✓ CAT: Children’s apperception test
 
✓ COPD: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
 
✓ COPE: Chronic obstructive pulmonary emphysema
 
✓ ECT: Electroconvulsive therapy (shock therapy)
 
✓ ECT: Enteric-coated tablet
 
✓ ECT: Euglobulin clot test
 
✓ MRI: Magnetic resonance imaging
 
✓ MRI: Medical Research Institute
 
✓ MRI: Medical records information
 
As you can see, many acronyms look the same, but actually mean something 
different. Knowing the context in which an acronym is being used is very 
important. Many common acronyms can be misinterpreted.
 
A favorite acronym of many medical professionals is BM. If you have ever been 
a patient in hospital, the usual question always asked by the nurse is, “Have 
you had a BM today?” Of course, most people know the nurse is referring to 
a bowel movement, but BM also could mean basal metabolism, body mass, 
bone marrow, basement membrane, blood monocyte, breast milk, or Bachelor 
of Medicine. Face it — everyone loves a good BM joke.

Next on the tour of plural forms is the antonym, proving once and for all 
that opposites do attract. An antonym is a word that means the opposite of 
another word. Examples would be right/wrong, right/left, up/down, and front/
back. With reference to medical terms, some prefixes can be paired as oppo-
sites. Table 4-1 lists some of the most popular.

Eponyms
Eponyms are an unusual and interesting facet of the plural world. An eponym 
is a person, place, or thing from which a person, place, or thing, gets (or is 
reputed to get) its name. For example, Romulus is the eponym of Rome. It 
can also refer to a person whose name is a synonym for something (from the 
Greek eponymos: epi [to] + onyma [name]).
In the medical field a disease, sign, operation, surgical instrument, syn-
drome, or test is often named after a certain physician, surgeon, scientist, 
or researcher — someone responsible for the creation, improvement, or 
research involved in its discovery.
 
In current usage, it is now acceptable to drop the possessive apostrophe from 
most eponyms, so either is acceptable. For example, you can use Alzheimer’s 
or Alzheimer.
Here are some of the most popular medical eponyms:
 
✓ Apgar score: Named after Virginia Apgar, American anesthesiologist 
(1909–1974). A numbering expressing the condition of a newborn infant 
at 1 minute of age and again at 5 minutes.
 
✓ Alzheimer’s disease: Named for Alois Alzheimer, a German neurologist 
(1864–1915). A progressive degenerative disease of the brain.
 
✓ Cushing’s syndrome: Named for Harvey Williams Cushing, American 
surgeon (1869–1939). A complex of symptoms caused by hyperactivity 
of the adrenal cortex.
 
✓ Down syndrome: Named after John Haydon Down, English physician 
(1828–1896). A chromosomal disorder, also called trisomy 21, formerly 
called mongolism.
 
✓ Gleason grade: Named for Donald Gleason, American pathologist (1920– 
Present). A rating of prostate cancer assigning scores of 1–5 for degrees 
of primary and secondary growth. 
 
✓ Hodgkin’s disease: A form of malignant lymphoma. Named for Thomas 
Hodgkin, an English physician (1798–1866).
 
✓ Homans’ sign: Named for John Homans, American surgeon (1877–1954). 
Pain on dorsiflexion of the foot; a sign of thrombosis of deep veins of the 
calf.
 
✓ Ligament of Treitz: Located in the intestinal tract. Named after Wenzel 
Treitz, a Czech physician (1819–1872).

41
 Chapter 4: Acronyms, Eponyms, Homonyms, Multiples, and Plurals — Oh My!
 
✓ Lyme disease: A multisystemic disorder transmitted by ticks. Named 
after a place, Old Lyme, Connecticut, where the disease was first 
reported in 1975.
 
✓ Peyronie’s disease: Named for Francois de la Peyronie, a French 
surgeon (1678–1747). It means a deformity or curvature of the penis 
caused by fibrous tissue within the tunica albuginea. When distortion of 
the penis is severe it causes erectile dysfunction or severe pain during 
intercourse.
 
✓ Parkinson’s disease: Named for James Parkinson, English physician 
(1755–1824). A group of neurological disorders including tremors and 
muscular rigidity.
As you can see, most of those famous people are no longer with us. So you 
had a much better chance of having something named after you if you were 
born a hundred years ago.
 
Don’t be afraid to learn more about eponyms. Many diseases, signs, syn-
dromes, and tests are listed in a medical dictionary. Any name can be 
researched as most are cross-indexed in a good medical dictionary such as 
Dorland’s. 
Homonyms
Similar to the antonyms is the homonym. A homonym is a word that has the 
same pronunciation as another, but a different meaning, and in most cases 
a different spelling (from the Greek homonymos: homos [same] + onyma 
[name]. Some common English language homonyms would be meat and 
meet, peal and peel, bare and bear, feet and feat, or pain and pane. While the 
list could go on and on with everyday English words, there are a few true 
homonyms in medical terminology. Table 4-2 shows the most likely suspects.

Deriving a Plural the Medical Way
As you read earlier in this chapter, medical plurals are a bit different from the 
standard, everyday English variety. Read on to familiarize yourself with the 
nuances of medical plural building. 
Medical rules for forming plurals
Some rules for pluralizing medical terms are as follows, with examples of the 
rule and exceptions to the rule. 
Medical Rule 1: Change the a ending to ae
In other words, vertebra becomes vertebrae. 
By adding the e to the plural, the “aah” sound ending pronunciation 
becomes “eh.”

43

The a at the end is pronounced “aah.”
 
✓ Acetabulum, acetabula
 
✓ Antrum, antra
 
✓ Atrium, atria
 
✓ Bacterium, bacteria
 
✓ Diverticulum, diverticula

Medical Rule 6: When a term ends in yx, ax, or ix, 
change the x to c and add es
 
✓ Appendix, appendices

45
 Chapter 4: Acronyms, Eponyms, Homonyms, Multiples, and Plurals — Oh My!

of a noun and adjective, pluralize both terms
  
✓ Condyloma acuminatum, condylomata acuminata
 
✓ Placenta previa, placentae previae
 
✓ Verruca vulgaris, verrucae vulgares
There are (of course!) some exceptions to all of these rules: 
 
✓ Cornu, cornua
 
✓ Pons, pontes
 
✓ Vas, vasa
English rules of forming plurals
Many medical terms apply basic English rules for forming plurals. Thank 
goodness! You will no doubt recognize many of these common English lan-
guage plural rules.
English Rule 1: Add an s
 
✓ Bronchoscope, bronchoscopes
 
✓ Disease, diseases

English Rule 4: When a term ends in o after a consonant, add nes
 
✓ Comedo, comedones
Exceptions:
 
✓ Embryo, embryos
 
✓ Placebo, placebos
 
When in doubt use a dictionary — it would be impossible to list all exceptions 
to all the rules.
Welcome to the Peanut Gallery: More 
Exceptions to the Plural Rules
Medical professionals, including physicians, clinicians, and pharmacists, 
often use measurements and their abbreviations to convey important infor-
mation. In regard to multiples, the plural has no place in measurement abbre-
viations if coupled with a number value. 
For example, the phrase “The incision was several centimeters long” is 
acceptable because it is a vague, not an exact amount. But if coupled with a 
number value and a measurement abbreviation, it then becomes, “The inci-
sion was 7 cm long.” The measurement abbreviation cm is always used with 
a number value and is always singular. It is never pluralized as cms, as the 
number value provides the clue that someone is talking about more than one 
centimeter.
Another example of common measurement is the tablespoon. When made 
plural, this word becomes tablespoons. Used with a specific number value, it 
becomes 2 tablespoons. When abbreviated, it is always 2 tbsp., not 2 tbsps.
 
Abbreviation of measurement with numbers is always left singular.
Single-digit numbers are made plural by adding an ’s. For example, “Several 
4 × 4’s were needed to build the porch” And “The patient was asked to count 
by 7’s.” However, no apostrophe is used to form the plural of multiple-digit 
numbers, including years. “He is in his early 20s” (not his 20’s). “She was 
born in the 1950s” (not the 1950’s). Get the picture? 

47
 Chapter 4: Acronyms, Eponyms, Homonyms, Multiples, and Plurals — Oh My!
Similarly, to pluralize uppercase abbreviations or acronyms, use a lowercase 
s without an apostrophe. Some medical examples include 
 
✓ CVA, CVAs
 
✓ EEG, EEGs
 
✓ WBC, WBCs
But if the abbreviation is expressed in lowercase, then an ’s (with the apos-
trophe) is added to pluralize.
 
✓ rbc’s, not rbcs
 
✓ RBCs, not RBC’s 
The real culprits in medical terminology are what are called the sound-alikes. 
These words are pronounced almost the same, but with a different spelling 
and often a very different meaning. Not knowing the difference can get you 
into a lot of trouble and can cause a great deal of confusion. Table 4-3 shows 
several examples.

I before E: Memorization techniques
Everyone has their own favorite way of remem-
bering words. The best thing to do is play around 
and find the memorization method that works 
best for you. Try some of these on for size:
 ✓ Alphabetical order: List prefixes, suffixes, 
or roots in alphabetical order to memorize.
 ✓ Flashcards: Use any connections you want 
to create your own flashcards.
 ✓ Group words in similar body systems: 
Tackle your list by system, recalling and 
memorizing one at a time, such as cardio-
vascular, muscular, urinary, and so on.
 ✓ Memorize by meaning: Try grouping words 
with similar meanings.
 ✓ Memorize by similar prefix or suffix: If pre-
fixes or suffixes are close in sound, spell-
ing, or meaning, try lumping them together 
and memorizing in chunks.
 ✓ Mnemonic devices: Remember “I before E, 
except after C”? See if you can create your 
own mnemonic devices for medical terms.
 ✓ Timed self-quizzes: When you feel you’ve 
mastered a group of words, create your 
own self-quizzes (or find some online) and 
time yourself.
Then we have a handful of terms that never 
change, no matter what. Consider putting these 
at the top of your memorization to-do list. 
 ✓ Some words are always plural: herpes and 
ascites.
 ✓ Some are always singular: adnexa or geni-
talia (not adnexae or genitaliae).
 ✓ Some remain the same whether singular or 
plural: biceps, triceps, forceps, and scissors.

Say What? Pronunciation 
and Usage
In This Chapter
▶ Simplifying your pronunciation methods.
▶ Distinguishing prefix sounds from suffix sounds.
▶ Applying pronunciation tips to everyday usage and word building.
I
f you read Chapter 4, you now have a better idea of how medical terms are 
formed. But unless you work on the set of a silent medical movie, you’re 
going to have to learn how to pronounce these words. Even the Hollywood 
hotshots who rush around the sets of ER and Grey’s Anatomy have to learn 
how to say medical terms, and are paid well to do it convincingly. Though 
you may not net seven figures for shouting, “Get an MRI of this man’s duode-
num and jejunum, stat!” you will fit right in with your medical counterparts 
by knowing the correct way to pronounce medical terms. 
Hooked on Phonics 
With medical terminology, sounds are not always pronounced the same as in 
your everyday English pronunciation, and there are not even steadfast rules 
that a combination of specific letters will always be pronounced in the same 
way. One thing that helps in both the standard English and medical worlds, 
though, is to learn how to pronounce phonetically — by breaking up the word 
into smaller parts.
The variety of possible letters and sound combinations can make — or at 
least can seem to make — medical terms difficult to pronounce, especially if 
you’ve never seen or heard the term before. What may seem familiar to you 
from everyday English might take on a whole new sound in a med term.

52
Part I: Living for Linguistics 
 
We can’t repeat this enough: By breaking the word down into basic parts — 
prefix, root, and suffix — you can simplify the task of pronunciation.
Take a closer look at the prefixes and the combining forms or root words 
when you start vocalizing the terms you know. You will find that by adding a 
variety of suffixes, not only does the prefix and suffix change the definition of 
the term, more importantly, in many instances it changes the way the term 
is pronounced. What does this mean for you? It means dive into this book 
and start memorizing! This in itself is a difficult task, but thankfully, there are 
some basic rules and tips that you can apply to help you along the way. 
Pronouncing Common Prefixes 
and Beginning Sounds
You have to start somewhere, so why not at the beginning? Because many 
medical terms start with an odd (to the English speaker’s eye) combination 
of letters, the pronunciation isn’t always obvious. Some letters are silent that 
aren’t normally in the English language, whereas some letters take on a whole 
new sound. Clear as mud, right? Let’s take a look at some common rules to 
help clarify things a bit.
The sound of silence
Terms beginning with the letters ps are pronounced with an “s” sound. The p 
is silent, as it usually is when it appears at the beginning of a medical word. 
 
Remember that the “pee” is silent — like it is in a swimming pool. 
Examples:
Psychiatry: (sigh-KIYA-tree)
Psychology: (sigh-CALL-ogy)
Terms beginning with pn are pronounced only with the “n” sound. Again, the 
p is silent.
Example:
Pneumonia: (new-MOAN-ia)
Terms beginning with pt work exactly the same. Once again, the p is silent.

53
 Chapter 5: Say What? Pronunciation and Usage
Example:
Ptosis: (TOE-sis) 
Terms beginning with ch often take on the hard consonant sound like a “k.”
Examples:
Chronic: (KRON-ic)
Chromatin: (KROME-a-tin)
Terms beginning with c or g can take on sound of “s” or “j” if they come 
before e, i, or y.
Examples:
Cycle: (SIGH-cull
Cytoplasm: (SIGH-toe-plazm)
Genetic: (JEN-etic)
Giant: (J-EYE-unt)
But c and g have a hard sound before other letters.
Examples:
Cast: (CA-st)
Cardiac: (CARD-iak)
Gastric: (GAS-trick)
Gonads: (GO-nadz)
From your ear to the dictionary
That’s a pretty good start, but now it’s time to throw a wild card into the mix. 
What if you cannot see the term, but only hear it? Could you find it in a medi-
cal dictionary? Some good, old-fashioned memorization rules will help you 
recall those hard-to-pronounce beginnings. 
If it begins with an “s” sound, it could begin with c, ps, or s:
Cytology: (sigh-TOL-oh-jee)
Psychiatrist: (sigh-KIY-a-trist)
Serology: (sir-ROL-oh-jee)

54
Part I: Living for Linguistics 
If it begins with a “z” sound, it could begin with x or z:
Xeroderma: (zero-DER-mah)
Zygote: (z-eye-GOAT)
If it begins with an “f” sound, it could begin with f or p: 
Flatus: (FLAY-tus)
Phlegm: (FLEM — also note the silent g before m)
If it begins with a “j” sound, it could be g or j:
Gingivitis: (JIN-jih-VIT-is)
Jaundice: (JOHN-dis)
If it begins with a “k” sound, it could be c, ch, or k:
Crepitus: (KREP-i-tus)
Cholera: (CALL-er-ah)
Kyphosis: (kie-FOE-sis)
Pronouncing Common Suffixes 
and Endings
You’re not out of the woods yet. One might think that pronouncing the end-
ings of words is fairly self-explanatory. But again, medical terminology is kind 
of like the curve ball of modern language. As such, letters don’t always sound 
like what they look like. This section lists some things to remember about 
saying word endings.
For terms ending in i (usually to form a plural), the i is always pronounced 
“eye.”
Examples:
Glomerulus, glomeruli: (glom-MERUL-EYE)
Radius, radii: (raid-ee-EYE) 

55
 Chapter 5: Say What? Pronunciation and Usage
Terms ending in ae (again often plurals) are pronounced “ee.”
Example:
Vertebra, vertebrae: (VERT-e-bray)
In terms ending in es (you guessed it — often plurals), the es is pronounced 
as if it were a separate syllable.
Examples:
Naris, nares: (nar-EEZ)
Testis, testes: (test-EEZ) 
Pronouncing Common Combinations
Now that you have established a few pronunciation rules, consider what hap-
pens to the pronunciation of a term when we combine a prefix with a root 
word or combining form, together with a suffix, and often a combining vowel. 
The combinations are endless. 
 
Keep a few simple explanations in mind before you start combining word 
parts. To review:
 
✓ Prefix: Always at the beginning of a term. Modifies the word root that it 
precedes. It almost always indicates a location, number, time or period 
of time, or status.
 
✓ Word root/combining form: Usually indicates a body part, such as 
cardi/o for heart, gastr/o for stomach, and neur/o for nerve.
 
✓ Suffix: Appears at the end of a medical term. Usually, though not always, 
indicates a condition, procedure, disorder, or disease.
 
A combining vowel can be used to change the spelling of a term, making the 
pronunciation easier. A combining vowel is not used when the suffix begins 
with a vowel as this would make pronunciation difficult. A combining vowel 
is only used when the suffix begins with a consonant. For example, gastr/o 
pertains to the stomach. Adding the suffix -itis, meaning inflammation, results 
in the term gastritis (GAS-TRY-tis). If the combining vowel o were not removed, 
the result would be gastroitis creating a double vowel and a word more diffi-
cult to pronounce (GAS-TRO-it-is).

Putting It All Together
You’ve got all the tools, now you just need to use them to build your pronun-
ciation skills. To do that, you have to get brave and start adding all of the 
word parts together. A long medical term must be broken up into the word 
parts in order to arrive at a definition and a pronunciation. You can do this in 
two ways.
Some people like to look at the suffix first to determine if the term is a condi-
tion, a procedure, disorder, or disease. Once the suffix is defined, you can 
then move to the beginning of the word to define the prefix, if there is one, 
and the word root. This method is preferred by many people just getting 
their feet wet in the world of medical terms.
Others prefer to tackle the term from the beginning, establishing a meaning 
for the prefix first, then moving to the word root, and to the suffix last of all.
The pronunciation of a word can sometimes change when you take some pre-
fixes, couple them with root words, and add vowels and suffixes. Following 
are some examples:
 
✓ Euthyroid (YOU-thyroid): The prefix eu means normal. Before thyroid, it 
means that the thyroid is normal. 
 
✓ Febrile (FEB-ril): Means to have a fever. Add the prefix a, which means 
being away from or without, and the word becomes afebrile (ay-FEB-ril), 
meaning without a fever.
 
✓ Hypertension (high-per-TEN-shun): High blood pressure
 
✓ Hypotension (high-poh-TEN-shun): Low blood pressure. Though there is 
not much difference in the pronunciation of hypertension and hypoten-
sion, and one means the opposite of the other, it is important to hear — 
and see — the different spelling of the prefix application.
 
✓ Oliguria (ol-ig-YOUR-ee-ah): Scanty or infrequent urination
 
✓ Polyuria (pol-ee-YOUR-ee-ah): Excessive or frequent urination
Suffixes can also affect the pronunciation of a word. Different suffixes can 
mean different pronunciations, particularly in respect to colors. Check out 
these two combinations and how the pronunciation and meaning change 
with altered suffixes: 
 
✓ Erythrocytes (eh-RITH-roh-sites): Red blood cells
 
✓ Erythrocytosis (eh-RITH-ROH-sigh-TOE-sis): Having increased erythrocytes
 
✓ Melanosis (mel-ah-NO-sis): Unusual black pigmentation
 
✓ Melanocytes (mel-ah-no-SITES): Pigmentation cell in the skin layer

57
 Chapter 5: Say What? Pronunciation and Usage
Even the more grounded basis of a word, the root or combining form, can 
change the way we say and see words. The combining vowel, in particular, 
can change the meaning and pronunciation:
 
✓ Neuritis (new-RYE-tis): Inflammation of a nerve (neur/o)
 
✓ Neuropathy (new-OP-a-thee): A condition of a nerve
 
✓ Neuroplasty (NEW-row-PLAS-tee): Surgical repair of a nerve
What Condition Your Condition Is In
Pronouncing terms for conditions can be easy if you familiarize yourself first 
with the root word of the condition, and then with the suffix. Let’s use the 
simple, everyday stomach ailment as an example. By first pronouncing the root 
word, then adding different suffixes, you can up your vocabulary by a few points:
 
✓ Gastro (gas-troh): Stomach
 
✓ Gastritis (gas-TRY-tis): Inflammation of the stomach (-itis)
 
✓ Gastrodynia (gas-troh-DYNEee-ah): A pain in the stomach (-dynia)
 
✓ Gastropathy (gas-TROP-a-thee): A stomach condition (-pathy)
On the other hand, you can grow your condition vocabulary and usage skills 
by applying the suffix to a variety of roots:
 
✓ Cardiomegaly (kar-dee-oh-MEG-ah-lee): Enlargement of the heart
 
✓ Hepatosplenomegaly (he-PATO-splen-oh-MEG-ah-lee): Enlargement of 
the liver and the spleen (splen/o for spleen) and hepat/o for liver
 
✓ -megaly (MEG-ah-lee): Enlargement of
 
✓ Splenomegaly (splen-oh-MEG-ah-lee): Enlargement of the spleen
Terminology treasure hunting in the dictionary
It is important to remember that every medical 
term you see or hear may not appear in a medi-
cal dictionary as it is commonly spelled or pro-
nounced. With so many root words, prefixes, 
and suffixes, the possible combinations would 
be endless, and the medical dictionary would 
become a set of encyclopedias. So when trying 
to find a term in a medical dictionary, you might 
have to look under the root word first and the 
prefix and suffix separately. Most commonly 
used terms are now listed alphabetically, but 
just because you can’t find a term in the dic-
tionary right away doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist. 
It just means you might have to piece together 
your own definition.

Suffering Suffixes
Suffixes play the most major role in the different ways procedural terms are 
spelled and pronounced. Lucky for you, there is a short list of very common 
suffixes that pertain to procedures. So, again, make the acquaintance of a 
short list of word parts and you get a world of words in return.
Here are some of the suffixes pertaining to procedures that create changes in 
pronunciation:
 
✓ -centesis: A surgical puncture to withdraw or aspirate fluid
 
✓ -ectomy: Surgical removal of
 
✓ -otomy: Surgical incision or cutting into
 
✓ -ostomy: Surgical creation of an artificial opening
 
✓ -plasty: Surgical repair
 
✓ -scope: An instrument used for visual examination
 
✓ -scopy: To see, or a visual examination
 
✓ -gram: Resulting record or picture
 
✓ -graphy: The process of recording a record or picture
Using those suffixes, watch the change in pronunciation depending on the 
suffix that is used: 
 
✓ Abdominocentesis (ab-DOM-ino-sen-TEE-sis): Surgical puncture of the 
abdominal cavity
 
✓ Abdominoplasty (ab-dom-ino-PLAST-ee): Surgical repair of the abdomen
 
✓ Bronchoscope (BRONK-o-scope): Instrument used to examine bronchus
 
✓ Bronchoscopy (bronk-OS-oh-pee): Visual examination of bronchus using 
a bronchoscope
 
✓ Cardiogram (CARD-ee-oh-gram): Film produced by a cardiography
 
✓ Cardiography (car-dee-OG-rah-fee): Process of recording heart activity
 
✓ Colostomy (koh-LOST-oh-me): Surgical creation of an opening in the 
colon
 
✓ Colotomy (kol-LOST-oh-me): Surgical cutting into the colon
 
✓ Endoscope (ENDO-scope): Instrument used for internal visual examination
 
✓ Endoscopy (en-DOS-koh-pee): Visual examination using an endoscope

59
 Chapter 5: Say What? Pronunciation and Usage
 
✓ Mammogram (MAMM-oh-gram): Resulting record of a mammography
 
✓ Mammography (mamm-OG-rah-fee): Process of examining breasts
 
✓ Mammoplasty (mamm-oh-PLAS-tee): Surgical repair to the breast
 
✓ Oophoritis (ou-for-EYE-tis): Inflammation of an ovary
 
✓ Oophorectomy (ou-ou-for-ECT-om-ee): Surgical removal of an ovary
 
✓ Salpingectomy (sal-pin-JECT-oh-me): Surgical removal of a fallopian tube
 
✓ Salpingogram (sal-PIN-joe-gram): Resulting record from salpingography
 
✓ Salpingography (sal-pinj-OG-rah-fee): Procedure to examine fallopian tube
Some of the examples here demonstrate how the pronunciation of a medical 
word can change just by adding gram versus graphy or ectomy versus otomy. 
Something as small as a one-letter change can change the sound and meaning 
entirely. Take scope versus scopy. One letter difference changes an instru-
ment into an examination, and more importantly, changes the pronunciation 
even more.
 
So, practice your pronunciation. Say the terms out loud and get the emphasis 
on the right syllable! (SILL-ab-el!)
And now for the grand finale
So what, you ask, is the craziest medical term 
to pronounce? What can I wow my friends with 
at cocktail parties and class reunions? What 
would make even the technical advisors of ER 
shudder in delight? 
Try these two 25-cent words on for size: 
 ✓ Salpingo-oophorectomy (sal-PING-oh/ou-
ou-for-ECT-om-ee): Surgical removal of an 
ovary and tube
 ✓ Oophorosalpingectomy (OU-OU-for-oh-sal-
pin-GECT-om-ee): Also meaning surgical 
removal of an ovary and tube

ring on the meaty basics of this book! Chapters 6 and 
7 show you the possibilities of prefixes and suffixes. 
Chapter 8 shows you how to recognize words on your own 
terms. Chapter 9 teaches you how to break words down to 
make better sense of them. And Chapters 10 and 11 give 
you a more in-depth picture of the body and its systems, 
organs, and cavities.

Chapter 6
As It Was in the Beginning: 
Prefixes
In This Chapter
▶ Defining common prefixes
▶ Categorizing prefixes by meaning
▶ Getting to know most likely prefix uses
▶ Reviewing some root words
You first met your new friends, the prefixes, in Chapter 3. To recap: 
Prefixes show up at the beginning of a word and tell the how, why, 
where, when, how much, how many, position, direction, time, or status.
Prefixes have a very important job: They act as modifiers or adjectives, alter-
ing the meaning of the root word of the medical term. Though you will see in 
this chapter some new and unfamiliar prefixes that only exist in the medical 
world, for the most part medical prefixes work just like any other prefix in 
the English language.
Common Prefixes
 
Keep the other word part functions in mind when dealing with prefixes. The 
combining form or root, as explained in Chapter 3, specifies the body part. The 
suffix, always at the end of a word, usually indicates a procedure, condition, or 
disease. When all three work together, they make one powerful word.
First things first: Let’s take a look at the most common prefixes in simple, 
easy-to-memorize alphabetical order. Later in the chapter we go over how 
these prefixes fit into everyday medical life and language.

Matching Prefixes to Situations
The next step in prefixes is applying them to the words we use every day in 
medical terminology. Keep in mind that the following is not by any stretch 
the end-all, be-all, conclusive list of medical words, but it’s a nice sampling of 
prefixes at work.
In your body 
Here are some common examples of prefixes in body-related words. You can 
see a nice mix of amounts, directions, and changes in these prefixes:
 
✓ Amenorrhea: Without period or menses, as in pregnancy
 
✓ Anovulatory: Ovaries not ovulating; can be hormonally induced
 
✓ Bilateral: Lateral meaning side; both sides
 
✓ Bradycardia: Slow heart rate
 
✓ Bradyarrhythmia: Slow irregular heartbeat
 
✓ Circumferential: Around the outside
 
✓ Dysfunctional: Difficult or painful menstruation; dysfunctional uterine 
bleeding
Not even close: Opposite prefixes
Some prefixes mean the opposite of each 
other:
Ab- means “away from” (abduct), but ad- 
means “toward.”
Ante-, pre-, and pro- all mean “before,” but 
post- means “after.”
Hyper-, supra-, and epi- mean “above,” but 
hypo-, infra-, and sub- mean “below.”
Tachy- means “fast,” whereas brady- means 
“slow.”
Macro- means “large,” whereas micro- means 
“small.”
Hyper- means “excessive,” but hypo- means 
“deficient.”

 This term is used in orthopedics to test range of motion of an arm or leg. 
In medical transcription, it is often dictated as “A-B-duction” to distin-
guish from “A-D-duction,” meaning the opposite.
 
✓ Adduction: Moving towards the point of origin; opposite of abduction; 
usually dictated or pronounced “A-D-duction.”

pharmacy and the lab. Here’s a quick taste:
 
✓ Anti-inflammatory: Agent opposing or fighting against inflammation
 
✓ Contraindication: Inadvisable, to be avoided
 
 In drug therapy, one drug might be contraindicated to another because 
of the effects of the use of both together.

So It Shall Be in the End: Suffixes
In This Chapter
▶ Defining common suffixes
▶ Categorizing suffixes by meaning
▶ Getting to know the most likely suffix uses
▶ Reviewing some root words
T
he suffix has a job that’s as important as the prefix’s and the root word’s. 
It is a third clue to the mystery of each medical term. The suffix is always 
at the end of a word and usually indicates a procedure, a condition, or a 
disease. All medical terms have suffixes. The suffix is all business and tells 
us what is happening with a specific body part or system — usually what is 
wrong with the body or which procedure is being used to diagnose or fix it.
Common Suffixes
The scope of suffix meanings is extremely wide. Like prefixes, many suffixes 
have similar meanings to those used in plain old, everyday English, whereas 
some are wildly different. You will get to know the usual suspects of suffixes 
fairly quickly — the following three in particular.
-itis
The suffix -itis simply indicates an inflammation of some kind. The -itis is 
quite popular in medical terminology because it can be applied to just about 
any body part within any body system. Here’s a quick sample:
 
✓ Tonsillitis: Inflammation of the tonsils
 
✓ Bronchitis: Inflammation of the bronchus
 
✓ Arthritis: Inflammation of a joint

74
Part II: Mapping Words and Bodies 
-oma
Remember the goofy yet memorable David Letterman joke, “Oprah, Uma. 
Uma, Oprah.”? Well, meet -oma. The -oma suffix can often stand for some-
thing certainly not as pretty as Uma Thurman: a tumor. It can also pertain to 
a neoplasm, or new growth. Again, -oma is one of the most versatile suffixes 
because a tumor or neoplasm can happen on or near any body part, in any 
body system. Some -omas you might have heard of:
 
✓ Carcinoma: Malignant (cancerous) tumor or growth
 
✓ Leiomyoma: Benign (non-cancerous) tumor derived from smooth 
muscle. Commonly called a fibroid or fibroid tumor. 
 
✓ Melanoma: Tumor of the melanocytic (melanocytes in the skin) system 
of the skin, a highly malignant and quickly metastasizing (spreading) 
tumor.
 
A tumor can be benign or malignant depending on the type and composition, 
and amount of cell division and growth.
-pathy
The last of the big three is the -pathy suffix, which indicates a disease pro-
cess. Once again, the wide-ranging use of this suffix is made possible by the 
large number of body systems it can help describe.
 
✓ Cardiomyopathy: Disease process involving the muscles of the heart
 
✓ Cardiopathy: Disease process involving the heart
 
✓ Neuropathy: Disease process involving the nervous system
 
✓ Osteopathy: Disease process involving bone
And lots more suffixes
There are, of course, many, many more suffixes that are just as important 
as the big three, though they may not be quite as recognizable to you (yet). 
As with English terms, many of the suffixes make their terms into adjectives. 
Table 7-1 lists several you should get to know.

usually with one r being left out.

▶ Surveying terms describing the body’s interior
▶ Checking out terms covering the body’s exterior
▶ Looking at pathological terms
G
etting the hang of medical prefixes, roots, and suffixes is just the begin-
ning of reaching your goal of becoming a terminology expert. Once you 
do that, you can move on to general word recognition.
Root words remain the basic component of word building, and you can look 
directly to them to recognize all sorts of words that associate with specific 
body parts and regions. Because you have spent so much time going over 
these individual building blocks, you can now begin to use what you know to 
piece together the larger puzzle of knowing whole words. 
All your memorization should be starting to pay off. By now, many medical 
words parts should be second nature to you, and you can use them to create 
all sorts of related words.
Before you jump headfirst into your medical dictionary, though, take a brief 
moment to give props to your Greek and Latin granddaddies for making it all 
possible. Although the wonders of modern medicine and language evolution 
have changed many terms to make them more applicable and comprehen-
sive, remember that most medical terms are derivatives of Latin and Greek.
 
Blame it on Aristotle and Hippocrates. Approximately 75 percent of all medical 
terms are based on Latin or Greek terms.
Going back to Chapter 2 to the topic of etymology, you might recall (hopefully!) 
that all words have an origin and a history. A large portion of medical terms 
have Greek roots. Take a fairly common term, hemorrhage, as an example. 

82
Part II: Mapping Words and Bodies 
You might hear that word, but did you know you can thank the Greeks for it? 
Hemorrhage is a word with Greek origin indicating a rapid, uncontrollable loss 
of blood.
Imagine a quick look from head to toe of the human body. If you could magi-
cally turn your eyes into a full body scan machine, you would see that your 
body is divided into several regions and cavities. Hundreds of words are 
associated with each of these different locations and the body parts con-
tained in them. Before you get started on the words associated with them, 
take a quick tour of the body regions.
First, envision the cranial cavity in the head, together with the brain. That 
round ball that is your head is probably already full of all sorts of words 
and terms (and hopefully many more after you’ve finished this book). The 
thoracic or chest cavity houses the lungs, heart, aorta, trachea, and esopha-
gus. Next is the abdominal cavity containing the stomach, intestines, spleen, 
liver, pancreas, gallbladder, ureters, and kidneys. The pelvic cavity contains 
the bladder, urethra, uterus, ovaries, and vagina in the female (testes in the 
male), as well as part of the large intestine, and the rectum (in both). In the 
middle of the whole mix is the spinal cavity, which consists of the spinal 
column connected to the cranial cavity. 
The Inside Story: Terms for Your Interior
Inside all these cavities, of course, lies a bounty of body part-related medical 
terms. All the root words and combining forms from Chapter 3 (and Chapters 
6 and 7) can morph into all kinds of different words that explain everything 
from everyday common conditions and procedures to pathology and 
pharmacology. 
 
Remember that you can take any root word or combining form and create sev-
eral different medical terms.
Table 8-1 lists many examples of where these root words can take you on 
your medical terminology journey.

Breaking Down Words
In This Chapter
▶ Identifying word parts
▶ Defining meanings of prefixes, suffixes, and root words
▶ Adding up individual word meanings
A
necessary and important component to learning medical terminology 
and medical terms is being able to break down or dissect a word to 
establish its meaning. Knowing your word parts and how to break down a 
medical term by its word parts is a vital method you can use to understand 
its definition. This means hard-to-pronounce or long medical terms used by 
physicians and healthcare workers are not as difficult as they seem.
When you understand a word part and understand the word part’s meaning, it 
is easy to analyze the definition of a medical term. Many medical words are very 
close in spelling but have different meanings. When you know the correct mean-
ing of a word, there is less chance of using a sound-alike word inappropriately.
 
When in doubt, look it up in a medical dictionary.
Now, let’s take on some larger words and try to break them down using the 
rules.
Finding Parts of Words
Don’t worry — you’re not backtracking, you’re just reminding yourself about 
the three major parts of every medical term so that you can more easily dis-
cover its meaning. 

92
Part II: Mapping Words and Bodies 
Identifying word elements
At the beginning of a medical term you often (but not always) find the prefix, 
which can indicate the direction, the where, the when and the amount.
Next comes the root word, indicating the body part involved. Some root 
word meanings are obvious and easy to understand, like arteri/o for artery, 
abdomin/o for abdomen, testicul/o for testicle, and tonsill/o for tonsil. Many 
are not so easy: What about blephar/o for eyelids, aden/o for gland, nephr/o 
for kidney, hepat/o for liver, or oophor/o for ovary? Obviously, you’re going 
to have to break out your best memorization skills for words like these. 
The suffix at the end of a term is often your first clue to the definition of the 
term. It can indicate a procedure, a condition, or a disease.
 
There is always a suffix at the end of a medical term.
The meaning of a suffix, just as with some root words, may not be obvious. 
It’s important to remember that the suffix always has the same meaning, no 
matter what root word it’s tacked on to.
 
The suffix, then, is the first place to look when trying to analyze or break down 
a medical term. From the suffix, back up to the prefix, if there is one, and 
finally, look at the root word.
Defining the prefix
The prefix and suffix are “adjectives,” in a way, telling you something about 
the root word in the middle. Changing the prefix or the suffix changes the 
meaning of the term. 
Let’s look at some commonly used prefixes, pre- (before), peri- (during), and 
post- (after or following), all coupled with the same term. Watch how the 
prefix changes the time frame. We can use the word operative for example, 
beginning with preoperative, referring to the time period or events before an 
operative procedure. Changing the prefix to peri- would be perioperative, indi-
cating the time or the events around or during an operation. Then changing 
the prefix to post- would result in postoperative, meaning the time or events 
after the surgery is completed. By using the three different prefixes, each of 
these words sound somewhat alike but are quite different in their meaning. 
Some prefixes often mistaken one for another are the prefixes ab-, meaning 
“away from” and ad-, meaning “towards” or “in the direction of.”

93
 Chapter 9: Deconstruction Junction: Breaking Down Words
 
Remember abduction, a kidnapping, or being taken away, as a memory key to 
tell the two apart.
Another example is the prefix dys-, often used in medical terms. Think of dys-
functional (not the dis in discomfort). Dys- used as a prefix in front of a medical 
term means “difficult,” “bad,” or “painful.”
The prefix inter-, meaning “between or among,” is often mistaken for intra-, 
which means “within or inside.” Think of an interstate highway, winding 
between and among states. For intra-, think of an intrauterine contraceptive 
device, used within or inside the uterus. 
 
The definition of a prefix is always the same, no matter what it’s paired with. 
Each time you see intra- before a root word, it always means “within or inside 
of.” Inter- always means “between or among.”
 
Prefixes are joined to a root word without the use of a hyphen, even when a 
double vowel results as in perioperative, intrauterine. The only exception to 
this rule is that a hyphen is used when the prefix joins up with a proper name: 
non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma.
Defining the root word
The root word describes the body parts involved in the medical term. Take a 
look at some common examples.
 
✓ Arthro: Joint
 
✓ Myelo: Bone marrow
 
✓ Myo: Muscle
 
✓ Neuro: Nerve
 
✓ Osteo: Bone
As always, a little memory work is needed here.
 
Medical terms always have a suffix but not always a prefix. Some medical terms 
have a combination of two or more root words, coupling multiple body parts 
together: hepatospleno comes from hepato (liver) and spleno (spleen).

94
Part II: Mapping Words and Bodies 
Identifying the combining vowel
The combining vowel, usually an o, joins the root word to a suffix. If a suffix 
begins with a vowel, the combining vowel o is not used, because it would 
create a double vowel.
Take the root word neuro (for “nerve,” right?) as an example. Let’s join it to 
the suffix -itis, which means “inflammation.” Using the combining vowel o to 
join these together, we would have neuroitis, which is not only difficult to 
pronounce but also contains a double vowel. Therefore, the o is dropped, 
and inflammation of a nerve becomes neuritis. 
Defining the suffix
As you know, the suffix indicates a procedure, disease, disorder, or condi-
tion, and you look at it first. For example, the suffix -itis is common. It means 
“inflammation,” so every time you see -itis, you know it means something is 
inflamed. Taking a word that we know — tonsil — we know that tonsillitis 
means “inflammation of the tonsil.” Gastr/o is the root word for “stomach,” so 
gastritis is “inflammation of the stomach.”
The commonly used suffix -ectomy means “surgical removal or excision of.” 
When you put -ectomy with tonsil, you have tonsillectomy, removal of the 
tonsils. Gastrectomy would therefore be what? Right: Surgical removal of the 
stomach (yikes).
 
The word tonsil (or tonsils) has only one l, but when we make it into a combin-
ing form such as tonsillitis or tonsillectomy, the l is doubled. Tonsillitis is a com-
monly misspelled medical word. More memory work!
Suffixes as “adjectives” help describe the root word. For instance, the suffixes 
-al, -ic, -ous, and -eal are all suffixes that mean “pertaining to.” The suffix -ologist 
refers to “one who studies or practices a specialized medical field.” The suffix 
-ology is “the study of.” The common suffix -pathy means “disease.”
Take an easily identifiable root word, cardio or cardiac, meaning “heart,” and 
apply different suffixes. Cardiology is the study of heart diseases. The cardiol-
ogist is the physician who practices cardiology, and cardiopathy means some 
form of heart disease. Neurology, then, is the study of nerves or the nervous 
system, and the neurologist is the physician who specializes in neurology. 
Any disease of the nervous system or the nerves is neuropathy.

95
 Chapter 9: Deconstruction Junction: Breaking Down Words
Going Deeper into Suffixes
Check out some more suffix examples. Suffixes related to procedures include 
-centesis, referring to surgical puncture to remove fluid for diagnostic pur-
poses or to remove excess fluid. That means abdominocentesis is surgical 
puncture of the abdominal cavity.
The suffix -ectomy means “surgical removal of.” When you see -ectomy at the 
end of any term, no matter how long or how difficult or confusing the first part 
of the word is, it means surgical removal of something. Another term we all 
know that end in -ectomy is appendectomy, surgical removal of the appendix.
But, sadly, it’s not always that easy. Take a look at a more complicated word 
and then break it down. How about the word salpingo-oophorectomy? The 
-ectomy we know indicates the surgical removal of something. But what? 
Salpingo is the root word referring to the fallopian tube; oophoro is the root 
word for ovary. Therefore, salpingo-oophorectomy is surgical removal of a fallo-
pian tube and ovary. Surgical removal of an ovary only would be oophorectomy.
 
The shrewd among you may have noticed this: There is a hyphen in salpingo-
oophorectomy. This is there mainly to aid with pronunciation and to avoid 
a triple “o” vowel with the combining of the two roots. The word can also be 
expressed as oophorosalpingectomy, which means the same thing.
Another suffix related to procedures is -graphy, meaning the process of 
recording a picture or a record. Radiography is the process of recording a pic-
ture by radiograph or an X-ray. Suffixes -gram and -graph are used to describe 
the finished product, the recording or picture. An arteriography is the process 
of recording the picture of arteries. The arteriogram or arteriograph is the film 
that is produced by the arteriography.
The suffix -ostomy means to surgically create an artificial opening or stoma. A 
colostomy is a surgical creation of an opening between the colon and the body 
surface. The root word colo means colon. The suffix -otomy means “surgical 
cutting into,” or a surgical incision. In order, then, to perform a tracheostomy 
(the surgical creation of an opening in the trachea), a tracheotomy (the surgical 
incision into the trachea) must be performed.
 
It is important to know the difference between “ostomy” and “otomy” — there 
is only one letter difference, but a big difference in the meaning. 

96
Part II: Mapping Words and Bodies 
The suffix -plasty means “surgical repair.” The rule of thumb to remember here 
is when you hear or see -plasty think of the plastic surgeon, because, in most 
cases, -plasty surgical procedures are performed by the plastic surgeon. A term 
associated with this suffix is mammoplasty. The root word mammo refers to 
the breast. A reduction mammoplasty would be surgical reduction in the size of 
the breast. Another commonly used suffix with regards to procedures is -scopy. 
This involves the visual examination of the interior of a body cavity or organ 
using an endoscope. The endoscope is the instrument, and endoscopy is the 
actual visual examination being performed with the endoscope. 
 
In medicine today, more and more diagnostic procedures are being performed 
using the endoscopic method. Endoscopic surgery is less invasive. Small por-
tals are made into skin, and the laparoscope provides visualization for exci-
sions to be made through these small portals — as opposed to a full thickness, 
muscle-splitting incision to fully open up (in most cases) the abdominal wall.
 
Female sterilizations, hysterectomies, gallbladder removal, and appendec-
tomies, just to name a few, are now being done laparoscopically. Less time 
is spent in the hospital, and the recovery period is reduced by as much as a 
month. For example, a gallbladder removed by routine upper abdominal inci-
sion requires a recovery period of four to six weeks; done laparoscopically, 
with only portals to heal, the time is cut to two weeks.
Suffixes related to conditions are used over and over again. You have already 
covered a few, but let’s look at some. We have -algia, meaning “pain and 
suffering.” Arthralgia would refer to the pain and suffering of joints. Myalgia 
means “pain or suffering in the muscle.” The suffix -dynia also means “pain.” 
The word gastrodynia (gastro is a root word for “stomach”) means “pain in 
the stomach.”
We already know -itis means “inflammation.” You can have gastritis, tonsillitis, 
laryngitis, thyroiditis, neuritis, cellulitis, dermatitis, colitis, enteritis, and arthritis 
(though you certainly wouldn’t want to). You could have an -itis of almost any 
part of your body.
 
Inflammation has two m’s, but inflamed has one.
The suffix -malacia means “abnormal softening,” most often used referring 
to bone disorders, but it does mean abnormal softening, and arteriomalacia 
refers to abnormal softening of the walls of an artery or arteries.
The suffix -megaly means “large” or “enlarged.” It can be coupled with many 
body parts or organs. Cardiomegaly means enlargement of the heart, spleno-
megaly enlargement of a spleen. Hepatomegaly is enlargement of the liver. 
Thyromegaly would be enlargement of the thyroid gland. And hepatosple-
nomegaly would be enlargement of the liver and spleen, a double-barreled 
root word. 

97
 Chapter 9: Deconstruction Junction: Breaking Down Words
The suffix -osis means “a disease or abnormal condition,” a general suffix 
associated with many of the root words. Gastrosis means a disease (any 
disease) of the stomach. Scoliosis is a curvature of the spine. Diverticulosis 
means outpouchings of the intestinal wall. Psychosis (psyche is the root word 
for “mind”) covers many varieties of mental disorders.
Adding Up Individual Word Meanings
Just as in a math problem, you can add up the parts of a word and get one 
coherent answer, one complete meaning. Here’s one example to get you 
started: Break the word gastroenterologist into root words and suffixes:
gastroenterologist = gastro + entero + logist
Look at the suffix first: -logist says this is a person, the physician. Now go 
back to the beginning. Gastro is the root word for stomach, and entero is 
the root word for intestines. Broken down, then, a gastroenterologist is a 
physician who studies and treats diseases of the stomach and intestines, 
performing a medical service known as gastroenterology.
 
With two root words, the meaning of both root words must be researched to 
know the true meaning of the term. 
Let’s take a trip through the body to find some not so easy terms. Using the 
rules of dissection, you should be able decipher some brainteasers.

Organization of the Body
In This Chapter
▶ Distinguishing the different branches of science that help you study the body
▶ Discovering the building blocks of the body
▶ Getting to know anatomical regions, planes, and cavities
B
efore we get into the real nitty-gritty of the source of all these magnifi-
cent medical terms — your body, that is — you may want to first get to 
know the big picture of your body. In this chapter, we review the structure 
and organization of the body. The body appears to be a solid structure from 
the outside. Inside, body regions, organs, and cavities fit nicely together to 
provide that solid structure.
Looking at the Big Picture
There are all sorts of ways to look at the human body. You can study it from 
different angles, both literally and figuratively. Let’s start with the figurative, 
as in the different kinds of science used to analyze the body. Then later, you 
can move on the some more concrete ways of looking at your beautiful bod.
The branches of science that cover the study of the body are as follows:
 
✓ Anatomy means “cutting apart.” This is the science that studies the 
structure of the body and the relationships of its parts to each other. 
The “cutting apart” is the method used (dissection) to study the struc-
ture of the human body.
 
✓ Biology is the study of all forms of life and living things.
 
✓ Embryology studies the origin (beginnings) and the development of an 
organism. This covers from the 2nd to the 8th week after conception, 
which is referred to as the embryonic stage. After eight weeks, the devel-
oping organism is known as a fetus.

102
Part II: Mapping Words and Bodies 
 
✓ Histology studies the body microscopically — the minute structures 
and their composition, plus the functions of normal cells, tissue, and 
organs.
 
✓ Pathology studies the changes caused by disease to the structures of 
the body or changes due to disease that alter the functions of the body.
 
✓ Physiology studies the normal activity and functions of the body.
Cells
The cell is the basic, smallest unit of life. Cells that perform similar functions 
join together, or group together, to form tissue. Groups of different types of 
tissue join together to form an organ. Groups of organs that work together to 
perform a complex function, form a body system.
 
The body is maintained by metabolism (meta means “change,” bolus refers to 
“mass,” and ism is “a condition”). Metabolism consists of the total processes 
of anabolism (ana means to build up) and catabolism (cata means to break 
down). When metabolism stops, an organism dies.
Each of us has trillions of cells that vary in size and shape according to their 
purpose or function. Specialized cells are responsible for the functions of 
growth, secretions, excretions, nutrition, and reproduction. Mechanical, 
chemical, and nervous stimulation activate the cells. The shapes of most typi-
cal cells are as follows:
 
✓ Epithelial or skin cell: May be square and flat
 
✓ Fat cell: Contains large vacant spaces for fat storage
 
✓ Muscle cell: Long and slender
 
✓ Nerve cell: May be long and have fingerlike extensions, which carry 
impulses
Each cell has a membrane, forming the exterior boundary; cytoplasm that 
makes up the body of the cell; and a nucleus, the small control center of the 
cell that contains the chromosomes. There are 46 chromosomes (23 pairs) in 
a human cell. Genes are regions within the chromosomes. Each chromosome 
has thousands of genes that all determine hereditary characteristics. Each 
gene is composed of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), the chemical that regu-
lates the activities of the cell. The mature reproductive (sex) cell has only 23 
chromosomes, and at conception, the male and female sex cells join together 
to contribute to innumerable possible combinations. That’s why no two indi-
viduals are alike, except for identical twins.

103
 Chapter 10: An Org Chart to Live By: Organization of the Body
Tissues
In the building blocks of body structures, cells of similar characteristics and 
specific tasks join together to form tissue. The body is made up of four differ-
ent types of tissue:
 
✓ Connective tissue supports and encases body structures. It is the most 
widespread kind of tissue throughout the body. It holds organs in place 
and connects body parts to each other. The main types of connective 
tissue include bone that supports the body; cartilage, firm but bendable; 
dense fibrous that makes up the tendons and ligaments; loose that con-
nects adjoining structures; and apidose tissue that pads and protects, 
stores fat, and insulates the body against heat loss. 
 
✓ Epithelial tissue: Found in the skin and in the lining of blood vessels, 
this makes up the outer covering of external and internal body surfaces 
(such as skin and mucous membranes) and the lining of the digestive, 
respiratory, and urinary tracts. 
 
✓ Muscle tissue provides movement. The main function of muscle tissue is 
to contract. 
 
✓ Nerve tissue conducts impulses to and from the brain and is composed 
of nerve cells called neurons. Nervous tissue needs more oxygen and 
more nutrients than any other body tissue. 
Organs and Systems
When two or more kinds of tissue work together to perform a specific function, 
you have an organ. For example, the skin is an organ made up of connective, 
nerve, and epithelial tissue.
Although organs act as units, they do not function alone. Several organs join 
together to form a system and perform a body function. Each system has a 
special function.
Some of the major body systems include the following:
 
✓ The cardiovascular system includes the heart and blood vessels and 
carries the blood throughout the body. 
 
✓ The digestive or gastrointestinal system includes the mouth, esopha-
gus, stomach, and small and large intestines. This system digests and 
absorbs food and excretes waste.
 
✓ The endocrine system is made up of a variety of glands and manufac-
tures and distributes hormones.

104
Part II: Mapping Words and Bodies 
 
✓ The integumentary system includes the hair, skin, nails, and sweat and 
oil glands.
 
✓ The lymphatic system works with the cardiovascular system to protect 
the body against disease-causing organisms.
 
✓ The musculoskeletal system, composed of bones, muscles, tendons, and 
ligaments, provides the framework for the body, supports organs, and 
permits movement in the body.
 
✓ The reproductive systems, the uterus, ovaries, testes, and prostate, pro-
vide for reproduction.
 
✓ The respiratory system includes the trachea, lungs, and bronchi and 
provides the exchange of gases, absorbs oxygen, and expels carbon 
dioxide.
 
✓ The sensory or special senses system, made up of the eyes, ears, nose, 
and mouth, along with the nervous system composed of the brain and 
spinal cord, processes stimuli and allows the body to act and respond.
 
✓ The urinary system manufactures and excretes urine.
Cavities of the Body
The body is not as solid a structure as it appears on the outside. It has 
five body cavities. Each cavity contains organs that are organized (no pun 
intended) in a neat and orderly fashion. 
The five body cavities include the following:
 
✓ The abdominal cavity contains the stomach, intestines, liver, spleen, 
gallbladder, pancreas, ureters, and kidneys.
 
✓ The cranial cavity, the cavity inside the skull, or the cranium, contains 
the brain.
 
✓ The pelvic cavity contains the urinary bladder, urethra, uterus and 
vagina in the female, part of the large intestine, and the rectum.
 
✓ The spinal cavity consists of the spinal column connecting to the cranial 
cavity.
 
✓ The thoracic or chest cavity contains the esophagus, trachea, lungs, 
heart, and aorta. This cavity can be divided into two smaller areas. The 
pleural cavity surrounds the lungs. (Each pleural cavity is lined with a 
membrane called pleura. Visceral pleura is closest to the lungs. Parietal 
pleura is closest to the outer wall of the cavity.) The mediastinum is the 
area between the lungs. It contains the heart, aorta, trachea, esophagus, 
and thymus gland. 

105
 Chapter 10: An Org Chart to Live By: Organization of the Body
 
The cranial and spinal cavities are dorsal body cavities, as they are located 
on the back part of the body. The thoracic, abdominal, and pelvic cavities are 
ventral body cavities, as they are on the front or belly-side of the body.
The thoracic and abdominal cavities are separated by a muscular partition 
called the diaphragm. The abdominal and pelvic cavities are not separated 
and, to really confuse you, together they are frequently referred to as the 
abdominopelvic cavity.

Directional Terms and Anatomical Planes
An anatomical plane is an imaginary flat plate or field. Imagine a slice view 
through the body and you’re on the right track. Anatomic planes provide 
further division of the body, again to identify a specific location or area. 
Visualize dividing the body in half, top from bottom, and then right from left, 
and finally front from back.
 
✓ The frontal or coronal plane is a vertical plane dividing the body into 
anterior (front) and posterior (back) portions.
 
✓ The midsagittal plane is a horizontal plane that divides the body into 
right and left halves at the body’s midpoint.
 
✓ The sagittal plane is a vertical plane that passes from front to back, 
dividing the body into right and left sides.
 
✓ The transverse plane is a horizontal (cross-section) plane, parallel to 
the ground and through the waistline, dividing the body into upper and 
lower halves.
The anatomical planes of the body are used in radiology when specific body 
location or direction is necessary.
 
When thinking about all of these terms, planes, and regions, think of the body 
as if it is standing, arms at each side, with palms facing forward and the feet 
side by side. Whether a patient is standing, or lying down face up, the direc-
tional terms are always applied in the same manner.
Directional terms are used to pinpoint or specifically locate an area on 
the body.

107
 Chapter 10: An Org Chart to Live By: Organization of the Body
When referring to the front of the body, the terms anterior and ventral are 
used. When referring to the back of the body, it’s posterior and dorsal. With 
the waistline of the anatomical position as a guideline, above the waistline is 
referred to as cephalad (“head” or “upward”) or superior (“above”). Below the 
waistline is referred to as caudal (“tail” or “downward”) or inferior (“below”). 
Superior and inferior are also used to describe body parts in relation to one 
another in general.
The sides of the body are referred to as lateral, and the middle referred to 
as medial. The term distal refers to “away from the point of origin” (think of 
distance). Proximal refers to “nearest the point of origin” (close proximity). 
Distal and proximal are two directional terms that seem to pose problems. 
View the torso of the body as the point of origin. Using the arm as an exam-
ple, the proximal portion of the arm is where the arm joins to the shoulder. 
The distal, or away-from, portion of the arm, would be the hand. In the leg, 
the upper thigh would be the proximal portion of the leg, and the foot would 
be the distal portion of the leg.
Directional terms can be joined together to provide a combined form. 
Ipsilateral pertains to one side, whereas mediolateral is a directional term 
meaning pertaining to the middle and one side (such as right mediolateral 
pain). It is often used in medical exams and surgical procedures. Here’s one 
use of mediolateral: A right mediolateral abdominal incision would be an inci-
sion beginning at the middle of the abdomen and going toward the right side. 
A similar term is lateromedial. A lateromedial incision would be the same as a 
mediolateral one, but beginning from the side and going towards the middle.

Part II: Mapping Words and Bodies 
Regions of the Body
All of these body parts don’t make a whole lot of sense until you can put 
them in the context of their general location within the body. Your body can 
be defined in several different ways, from groups and regions to cavities and 
planes.  
Body regions, like the directional terms and anatomical planes we cover later, 
are used to specifically identify a body area. To illustrate all that’s involved 
with a body region, take a closer look at two major regions: the abdominal 
and spinal.
The abdominal area is divided further into anatomic regions to diagnose 
abdominal problems with greater accuracy.
Starting with the diaphragm, which is the muscle separating the thoracic 
cavity from the abdominal cavity, down to the level of the pelvis or groin, the 
abdominal area is divided into nine equal regions. 
Visualize the abdomen divided into nine squares: three across the top, three 
across the middle, and three across the bottom, like a tic-tac-toe board. The 
center portion is the umbilical region, the region of the navel or the umbili-
cus. Directly above this is the epigastric region, or the region of the stomach. 
Directly below the umbilical region is the hypogastric region.
On either side of the epigastric region are the right and left hypochondriac 
regions. To the right and left of the umbilical region are the right and left 
lumbar regions. To the right and left of the hypogastric region are the right 
and left iliac regions.
Get in position
Some frequently used anatomic positions 
describing body positions are
 ✓ Anatomical position is when the body is 
standing, arms at each side, with palms 
facing forward and the feet side by side. 
(Whether a patient is standing, or lying face 
up, the directional terms are always applied 
in the same manner.)
 ✓ Erect is standing position.
 ✓ Genupectoral is kneeling with chest resting 
on examining table.
 ✓ Lateral recumbent means lying on left 
side with right thigh and knee drawn up to 
chest.
 ✓ Prone means lying face down.
 ✓ Supine (dorsal) is lying flat on your back.

109
 Chapter 10: An Org Chart to Live By: Organization of the Body
 
The anatomical divisions of the abdomen are referenced in anatomy textbooks 
to specify where certain organs are found. 
The clinical regions of the abdomen are used to describe the abdomen when 
a patient is being examined. The clinical regions of the abdomen divide the 
abdominal area, as above, into four equal quadrants:
 
✓ The right upper quadrant (RUQ) contains the right lobe of the liver, 
gallbladder, and parts of the small and large intestines.
 
✓ The left upper quadrant (LUQ) contains the left lobe of the liver, 
stomach, pancreas, spleen, and parts of the small and large intestines.
 
✓ The right lower quadrant (RLQ) contains parts of the small and large 
intestines, appendix, right ureter, right ovary, and fallopian tube. 
 
✓ The left lower quadrant (LLQ) contains parts of the small and large 
intestines, left ureter, left ovary, and fallopian tube. 
Table 10-4 provides a quick look at some of the smaller body regions, begin-
ning at the head and moving downward.

Part II: Mapping Words and Bodies 
More body divisions are the regions of the spinal column, also known as the 
back. Note the difference between the spinal column (the vertebrae) and the 
spinal cord (the nerves running through the column). The spinal column is 
made of bone tissue, and the spinal cord is composed of nerve tissue.
The spinal column is divided into five regions. Begin at the top and work 
downward:
 
✓ The cervical region (abbreviation C) is located in the neck region. 
There are seven cervical vertebrae, C1 to C7.
 
✓ The thoracic or dorsal region (abbreviation T or D) is located in the 
chest region. There are 12 thoracic or dorsal vertebrae, T1 to T12, or D1 
to D12. Each bone in this segment is joined to a rib. 
 
✓ The lumbar region (abbreviation L) is located at the loin or the flank 
area between the ribs and the hip bone. There are five lumbar vertebrae, 
L1 to L5.
 
✓ The sacral region (abbreviation S) has five bones, S1 to S5, that are 
fused to form one bone, the sacrum.
 
✓ The coccygeal region includes the coccyx, or tailbone, a small bone 
composed of four fused pieces. 
 
It is important to remember that all these terms are for directional purposes 
only. They provide a road map to the body. In a medical examination, direc-
tional planes, regions of the abdomen, and divisions of the spinal column are 
used often by the physician.

Chapter 11
All Systems Go: When 
Systems Combine
In This Chapter
▶ Discovering the systems associated with basic anatomy
▶ Taking a tour of the physiological systems
▶ Finding out how systems work together
T
eamwork is the key for your body systems. When they all do their own 
individual jobs, they have a better chance of working together in har-
mony. Not every single system works with every other system, but many do 
work together to keep you running at your top performance. 
Anatomical Systems Working Together
Start with anatomy. Anatomy is the study of the parts of the body, from what 
you can see on the outside, like the skin covering muscles and bones, to the 
brain in the skull, or the variety of organs neatly arranged inside the trunk 
or torso of the body like a well-packed suitcase. Coupled with physiology 
(which we cover later), a bit of studying your basic building blocks will help 
you identify and create tons of medical terms.
A good start to learning about anatomy and physiology is to observe the 
body as a whole. Parts III and IV of this book cover these systems in detail, 
but to whet your appetite let’s do a quick preview of the systems of the body.

112
Part II: Mapping Words and Bodies 
The musculoskeletal system
The musculoskeletal system is made up of 206 bones and more than 600 
muscles. The bones of the skeleton have tons of jobs. They provide support 
for the body’s framework and protect vital internal organs, brain, and spinal 
column. Bones store minerals necessary for growth, and red bone marrow 
makes blood cells. Most importantly, bones make movement possible, pro-
viding attachments for muscles. 
 
Bones are attached to other bones by ligaments, whereas tendons connect 
bones to muscles. A joint is where two bones meet.
Muscles attach to bone, not only making movement possible but holding the 
bones of the skeleton together. Muscles allow flexibility of the body and help 
maintain body temperature. But think about some other functions of mus-
cles. There are all kinds of muscles you probably don’t think too much about. 
Cardiac muscle keeps your heart beating, but the cardiac muscle is involun-
tary. That means you don’t have to think about keeping your heart beating. 
Muscle contraction throughout the body keeps the blood flow moving. The 
digestive system is lined by smooth muscle that keeps the food moving. And 
don’t forget the muscles that keep the bladder and colon closed up — until 
you voluntarily relax these muscles when you want. 
The integumentary system
The integumentary system is a really fancy way of referring to the skin, hair, 
nails, and glands. The skin is actually the body’s largest organ (yes, it is an 
organ!). It covers about 20 square feet and accounts for nearly 15 percent 
of your body weight. Skin (obviously) provides an external covering for the 
body. As a protective membrane, it prevents loss of water, salt, and heat.
The skin provides a protective barrier against bacteria, pathogens, and 
toxins that want to invade your body. Plus, it’s full of glands that do many 
smaller, but equally important jobs. Sebaceous glands secrete oil to lubri-
cate, whereas sudoriferous glands secrete sweat, acting as a cooling system. 
Nerves are involved as well and carry impulses that act as receptors for pain, 
temperature, and touch. The blood vessels in the skin aid in regulating body 
temperature.
The sensory system
The eyes and the ears, like the skin, are sense organs. They act as the body’s 
external perception/alarm system by letting in light and sound. Impulses 
from the eyes are sent to the occipital lobe in the brain for processing, and 

113
 Chapter 11: All Systems Go: When Systems Combine
impulses from the ears go to the brain’s temporal lobe. In these lobes of the 
brain, nerve impulses are translated into sound sensations and visual images 
that we experience as vision and hearing. 
 
Age sure takes its toll on the eyes and ears. Presbyopia is impaired vision due 
to aging. Presbycusis is hearing loss occurring in old age. 
Physiology Systems Working Together
Physiology is the study of the function or day-to-day operation of the parts 
of the body. This includes the functions of everything from the smallest cell, 
seen only under a microscope, to a large organ like the heart. You might 
think that each body part has one function to carry out and works indepen-
dently on its own to accomplish this function, but in fact, most body parts 
are team players that work together to accomplish a task. Brisk walking, for 
example, not only requires the use of leg muscles, but also good lung capac-
ity to keep up the pace. You know that the heart pumps blood through the 
body via arteries and veins, which are part of the cardiovascular system. 
Without the lungs performing their function to re-oxygenate the blood as it 
passes through the lungs, the exchange of gases (the function of the respira-
tory system) would not happen, and body cells and organs would die.
 
Pathology (sometimes pathophysiology) is the study of the effects of disease on 
body parts and the ways disease can interfere with an organ or system’s func-
tioning ability.
The cardiovascular and lymphatic systems
The cardiovascular system (sometimes called the circulatory system) has many 
functions. Blood carries oxygen, nutrients, hormones, and lymph fluid to 
cells and transports waste products, carbon dioxide, and urea away to be 
excreted. The heart is the body’s pumping station that pumps out freshly 
oxygenated blood through a vast network of vessels. The heart is divided 
into four chambers: two upper chambers (the right atrium and left atrium 
(plural: atria) and two lower chambers, the right and left ventricles. 
 
The cardiovascular system could not survive without the assistance of the 
muscular system — the myocardium is the heart muscle — which in turn is 
kept functional by the autonomic section of the nervous system.
Not to be forgotten as a team player with the cardiovascular system is the 
lymphatic system. This system works together with the blood to fight disease. 
It looks after the body’s immune system. This system produces lymph, a 
fluid released into the body through lymphatic vessels, which are linked up 

114
Part II: Mapping Words and Bodies 
with blood vessels to carry lymph throughout the body. This system pro-
duces lymphocytes, the disease-fighting cells that circulate the body through 
blood. Lymph nodes located throughout the body act as the filtrating centers. 
Lymph nodes can trap and filter toxic and malignant substances. Special cells 
can digest foreign substances as well as manufacture antibodies to fight off 
infection.
The spleen, tonsils, and thymus are accessory organs of this system, all play-
ing special roles. The spleen stores red blood cells, which can be released 
into the body as needed. The thymus gland produces lymphoctes, the disease 
fighters. The tonsils are also made up of lymphatic tissue and act as a filter 
system for bacteria.
The respiratory system
The respiratory system provides the mechanisms that allow you to breathe. 
You can’t live without it, and, as with the other systems, improper function-
ing would render you dead! Now that would really ruin your day.
A fantastic voyage
Freshly oxygenated blood is pumped from the 
left ventricle through the aorta (the largest 
artery) into arteries that decrease in size to arte-
rioles and to capillaries, the smallest branches 
of the venous system, where the exchange of 
gases takes place. Oxygen is absorbed into 
tissue cells, while carbon dioxide is expelled by 
the cells. The oxygen-depleted blood is carried 
via venules (small veins) through veins, to the 
superior and inferior venae cavae, the body’s 
largest veins, back to the heart, where it is 
received in the right atrium.
But this blood has to be oxygenated before it 
begins the trip again, so the right atrium sends 
the stale blood to the right ventricle, where it 
then gets side-tracked to the lungs to be topped 
up with oxygen. The blood travels through a vast 
network of vessels once again, this time through 
alveoli (the air sacs of the lung), where the lungs 
perform the function of re-oxygenating the 
blood, getting it ready for its next trip around 
the body. Through the processes of inspiration 
and expiration in the lungs, fresh oxygen enters 
the bloodstream, and the not-needed carbon 
dioxide is eliminated by the lungs. This freshly 
oxygenated blood then comes back to the heart 
and is received in the left atrium, then on to the 
left ventricle, where it is pumped through the 
aorta to begin the trip all over again. Imagine 
this happening with every heart beat 100,000 
times a day, resulting in 1,800 gallons of blood 
being circulated on a daily basis!

115
 Chapter 11: All Systems Go: When Systems Combine
The respiratory system works in conjunction with the cardiovascular system 
to provide the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the air in the 
lungs and the blood. Inhaling and exhaling, the movement of air in and out of 
the lungs (ventilation) allows the body to maintain its oxygen requirements for 
body cells and tissue to survive. The lungs facilitate the exchange of oxygen 
and carbon dioxide between the blood and the body cells. This system also 
metabolizes oxygen, resulting in carbon dioxide production in body cells. Air, 
which is about 15 percent oxygen, enters the nose (sometimes the mouth, 
as in chronic mouth breathers when sleeping) — where it is moistened and 
warmed — through to the pharynx (throat), consisting of the nasopharynx, 
oropharynx, and hypopharynx.
Ventilation (breathing) is a process that again is looked after automatically 
by the nervous system. You don’t have to consciously think about breathing. 
When you breathe in (inspiration), all passageways are opened to allow the 
air entry. The diaphragm, a large muscle separating the chest cavity from the 
abdominal cavity, pushes down and the ribs move up to give the lungs lots 
of room to expand. Air pressure within the lungs decreases and air comes 
in. When you breathe out (expiration) the diaphragm moves up, the rib cage 
comes down, lung pressure increases, and air is pushed out.
The lungs are contained in the thoracic cavity that divides into the pleural 
and mediastinum cavities. The pleural cavity surrounds the lungs, and the 
mediastinal cavity between the lungs holds the heart, trachea, and esopha-
gus. The right lung consists of three lobes, and the left lung two lobes. The 
cavities are the pleural and mediastinum, but when referring to the area in 
general you should say mediastinal cavity, even though the area is referred to 
as the mediastinum.
The gastrointestinal system
The gastrointestinal system (also called the digestive system or alimentary 
tract) has three functions: to digest food, absorb nutrients, and carry waste 
materials to be eliminated. Except for the processes of swallowing food and 
having a bowel movement, what happens in between pretty much looks after 
itself.
We chew food, which we swallow, that goes into the esophagus and then into 
the stomach. The stomach partially digests the food before it moves on to 
the small intestine (also called small bowel) for further digestion and absorp-
tion. The residual food moves into the large intestine (large bowel) where it 
is doomed to be eliminated as solid waste. Except for the pharynx (throat) 
and esophagus, all gastrointestinal organs are in the abdominal cavity, often 
referred to as the gut or belly.

116
Part II: Mapping Words and Bodies 
The accessory organs of this system — teeth, salivary glands, liver, gallblad-
der, and pancreas — all do their special part to add in the process of digestion, 
absorption, and elimination. The pancreas (also part of the endocrine system) 
secretes enzymes necessary for digestion. The liver (the body’s largest gland) 
secretes bile needed for digestion. It metabolizes proteins, fats, and carbohy-
drates. The liver also acts as a filter system that neutralizes toxins. The gall-
bladder stores bile that also aids the digestive process. 
 
The liver joins a group of mixed-function organs (working as both organ and 
gland) that includes the stomach, intestines, kidney, ovaries, and testes. In 
addition to their regular system functions, they also produce hormones.
Digested food and nutrients are absorbed into the bloodstream through the 
walls of the small intestine, so blood and the cardiovascular systems again 
assist another system. All the while, the muscular system provides the peri-
stalsis, a wave-like contractions of muscle throughout this long tract of pas-
sageways, that propels the food onward and outward.
 
This system is very prone to inflammation because of the invasion of foreign 
material (food). Food poisoning is a perfect example, but let’s not forget gas-
troenteritis (inflammation of stomach and intestines), vomiting, and everyone’s 
favorite, diarrhea.
The endocrine system
The endocrine system maintains the chemical balance in the body. It works 
in conjunction with the nervous system to regulate body systems. This is 
accomplished by sending messengers called hormones through the body 
via the bloodstream. The nervous system controls the endocrine system’s 
You’ve got connections
The hypopharynx is a common passageway for 
both food and air to travel to their final destina-
tions. Air taken through the nose to the larynx 
produces the voice. The trachea (windpipe) 
connects the larynx to a right and left bronchus, 
just above the lungs. The bronchi break down 
into smaller branches called bronchioles that 
lead into small clusters resembling grapes. 
These grape-like sacs are called alveoli, of 
which there are approximately 300 million in 
healthy lungs, surrounded in capillaries. Oxygen 
moves from alveoli into the lung capillaries sur-
rounding them to be exchanged via the blood-
stream throughout the body. Carbon dioxide 
moves from the capillaries into the alveoli to be 
expelled by the lungs. 

117
 Chapter 11: All Systems Go: When Systems Combine
release of hormones, and hormones control the metabolic function in the 
body. The pituitary gland, known as the “master gland,” is located in the 
brain. It works together with the hypothalamus gland to aid homeostasis and 
body functions such as growth, salt and water balance, reproduction, and 
metabolism.
 
Homeostasis is an automatic process that maintains stability and balance of 
the body’s internal environment in order to stay healthy.  
Glands that make up this system include the thyroid, parathyroids, adrenals, 
and pineal. All these glands produce hormones. The pancreas (also a part of 
the digestive system) also produces hormones. The pancreas joins a group 
of mixed-function organs including the stomach, intestines, kidney, ovaries, 
and testes. In addition to their regular system functions, they also produce 
hormones. 
The thyroid gland secretes two hormones that are necessary for the body to 
maintain a normal rate of metabolism. The parathyroid glands secrete a hor-
mone that moves the storage of calcium from bone into the blood (to main-
tain adequate levels of calcium in the bloodstream).
The adrenal glands are made up of the cortex and medulla. The cortex 
secretes steroids and mineral corticoids. which are essential to life because 
they regulate the levels of mineral salts, or electrolytes. In fact, all adrenal hor-
mones secreted by the cortex are steroids. These include mineralocorticoids, 
which regulate potassium, sodium and chloride (electrolytes) and glucocor-
ticoids (which includes cortisol) that aids in metabolism of carbohydrates, 
fat and proteins (tissues release glucose to raise blood sugar levels when 
needed). 
The adrenal medulla secretes catecholamines only, such as epinephrine 
(adrenaline) and norepinephrine (noradrenaline), which aid the body in 
stressful situations.
The pancreas has specialized cells called the islets of Langerhans. They produce 
insulin and glucagon, which stimulates gluconeogenesis, or sugar production, in 
the liver. Insulin is necessary in the blood so sugar can pass from the blood into 
cells. The pineal gland secretes melatonin, thought to affect the brain, help regu-
late sleep patterns, and influence the rate of gonad maturation.
The endocrine glands all play a part in this large orchestra to maintain the 
harmonious music of the body. The hypothalamus and pituitary are the 
orchestra leaders of this complex system, which needs to function properly 
to maintain good health.

118
Part II: Mapping Words and Bodies 
The nervous system
The nervous system is one of the most complicated systems in the body. More 
than 10 billion nerve cells function constantly to organize and coordinate the 
activities of the body. This system controls voluntary as well as involuntary 
functions. We speak, move muscles, hear, taste, see, and think. We have 
memory, a word bank, association, and discrimination. These enormous 
tasks represent just a small number of functions controlled by the nervous 
system.
The brain controls homeostasis, an automatic checklist your body goes 
through, to keep all systems running normally. When the body is stressed 
due to infection, pain, or not enough oxygen, body cells are not at their best 
and don’t function as well as they should. So the brain monitors blood pres-
sure, body temperature, and sugar in the blood. The hypothalamus, located in 
the brain, maintains homeostasis by initiating the release of hormones when 
needed.
Most major regions of your body host some sort of nervous system worker 
bee, from your head to your toes.
 
✓ The brain’s largest part is the cerebrum. The lobes of the cerebrum 
control functions such as speech, recognizing objects, concentration, 
vision, problem solving, hearing, learning, and almost all functions of 
consciousness, 
 
✓ The cerebellum, or “hind brain,” assists in coordinating voluntary body 
movement and helps maintain body balance. The hypothalamus con-
trols body temperature, sleep, and appetite.
 
✓ The medulla oblongata regulates the centers that control respiration, 
heart rate, and the respiratory system. 
 
✓ The spinal cord passes through the vertebral canal from the medulla 
down to the lumbar vertebrae. The cord conducts nerve impulses to and 
from the brain. 
The three little systems
The central nervous system includes the brain 
and spinal cord. The peripheral nervous system 
consists of cranial and spinal nerves, or all the 
nerves that branch out from the brain and spinal 
cord. Impulses are sent to and from the brain via 
a vast network of nerves. The peripheral system 
consists of nerves that operate automatically, 
sending impulses from the central nervous 
system to glands, the heart, and blood vessels 
as well as the involuntary muscles in the diges-
tive and urinary systems. This autonomic system 
also contains sympathetic nerves that stimulate 
the body when under stress or in a crisis, to 
increase blood pressure and heart rate. 

119
 Chapter 11: All Systems Go: When Systems Combine
You can see why the nervous system is so complex. It is the body’s control 
center, and the spinal cord with its nerve network is the body’s communica-
tion system. 
The urinary and reproductive systems
Think you’re running out of systems? Not a chance! Next, consider your uri-
nary system, whose responsibility it is to remove the liquid waste from the 
body. Urine is liquid waste filtered from the blood, collected in the tubules 
of the kidneys, and passed along to the renal pelvis, the central collecting 
portion of each of two kidneys, down each ureter (we each have two) to the 
urinary bladder, which is, of course, the holding tank. When urination occurs, 
urine is released from the bladder, travels down the urethra, and exits the 
body. 
Much of this system also looks after itself automatically. It works in conjunc-
tion with the bloodstream to begin the filtration process with the autonomic 
nervous system, so we don’t have to think about producing urine, we only 
have to release it when the bladder is full. The muscular system involves the 
sphincter that we control to open to release urine from the body.
The kidneys play an important role in the process of homeostasis — to keep 
everything in sync and in order. Kidneys help maintain the proper balance of 
salt and water content in the blood as well as maintain the proper acid-base 
balance in the blood. The kidneys work together with the liver and adrenal 
glands to maintain balance of sodium and potassium in the blood, which affects 
blood volume and, in turn, affects blood pressure. Once again, this is an exam-
ple of multiple systems working together to accomplish an important task. 
In the male, the prostate surrounds the urethra. The urethra passes through 
the prostate as its connection to the male reproductive system. During urina-
tion, urine passes through the male urethra. 
 
During ejaculation, seminal fluid passes through the urethra, so the urethra 
serves two purposes in the male. The prostate gland secretes juices that help 
make up the seminal fluid.
The reproductive systems have one purpose: to secrete hormones (accom-
plished through the endocrine system) in order to have the ability to repro-
duce. To accomplish this, a male must fertilize a female, either in person or 
via one of the many modern fertility clinical procedures. 
The female system consists of the ovaries (the gonads) that produce the 
hormones estrogen and progesterone. The fallopian tube is the passageway 
that a mature ovum (egg) takes from the ovary to the uterus. The uterus is a 
muscular, very expandable organ that provides a safe place for a pregnancy 
to grow to maturity (40 weeks). The vagina is the birth canal, the route taken 

120
Part II: Mapping Words and Bodies 
by the infant at delivery and also the route taken by the sperm to achieve the 
pregnancy. Actually, fertilization of a sperm and an ovum takes place in the 
fallopian tube and then travels to the uterus to grow. Each month the uterus 
prepares for a possible pregnancy. When conception does not occur, the 
lining of the uterus is expelled as a menstrual period. Then the whole monthly 
process begins all over again. 
 
The breasts are considered part of the reproductive system as they are the 
glands that begin producing milk following delivery. 
In the male, the testes are the gonads. It is in the testes or testicles, which are 
held in the scrotum, that the hormone testosterone is produced, as well as 
spermatozoa, which are stored in the epididymis. At the time of ejaculation, 
the spermatozoa together with seminal fluid gathered along the route, travels 
through a duct system that includes the vas deferens, seminal vesicles, pros-
tate, and urethra, via the penis, to exit the body. During intercourse, it is all 
deposited into the vagina.
We’re sure you’ll agree that, when all is said and done, the human body is a 
pretty amazing machine!

onsider the skeletal system to be your body’s infrastructure. This 
system, along with its joints, works together with the muscles to give 
your body the support it needs to function. The bony skeleton, composed of 
206 bones, provides the jointed framework for the body, giving it shape. This 
framework protects vital organs from external injury and provides attach-
ment points for muscles, ligaments, and tendons to make body movement 
possible.
Bones are connected to other bones by ligaments. Muscles are connected 
to bones by tendons, which are located at each end of a muscle because a 
muscle needs to be attached to two bones to make movement possible. A 
joint, then, is any place in the body where two or more bones meet. 
How the Skeletal System Works 
Although bones, muscles, joints, ligaments, and tendons all work together, 
they each have a special job. Bones provide framework but ligaments and 
tendons provide the attachments for muscles to contract and relax.
Bones store mineral salts, and the inner core of a bone is composed of 
hematopoietic (blood cell forming) red bone marrow. Other areas of the bone 
are used as storage areas for minerals necessary for growth, such as calcium 
and phosphorus. 

124
Part III: In Terms of Anatomy 
 
Red bone marrow is red because red blood cells form in it. In adults red 
marrow is eventually replaced by yellow marrow, which stores fat. Bones are 
complete organs, chiefly made up of connective tissue called osseous or bony 
tissue plus a rich supply of blood vessels and nerves.
 
Colles’ fracture was first described by Dr. Andrew Colles, an Irish surgeon in 
1814. It is a fracture of the distal end of the radius (distal meaning the portion 
of a body part farthest from the point of origin). But you don’t have to be Irish 
to sustain one. In this case the point of origin is the shoulder, looking at the 
limb separately, and not the body as a whole.
Bones and osteology
Now it’s time to get down with osteology. No, it’s not a slick new dance move. 
Osteology is the study of bones. Notice the root word osteo? You might know 
it as part of the word osteoporosis — a common condition typical in women 
involving the loss of bone density. So, osteo is the focus in this chapter. The 
first step into the world of osteology is looking at the actual makeup of our 
bones. 
Bones are classified by their shape — long, short, flat, irregular, and sesamoid.
 
✓ Long bones, found in arms (the humerus is the upper arm) and legs (the 
femur is your thigh) are strong, broad at the ends where they join with 
other bones, and have large surface areas for muscle attachment.
 
✓ Short bones are found in the wrists and ankles and have small, irregular 
shapes.
 
✓ Flat bones are found covering soft body parts. The shoulder blades, 
ribs, and pelvic bones are examples of flat bones.
 
✓ Vertebrae are examples of irregular bones. 
 
✓ Sesamoid bones are small, rounded bones found near joints. The knee-
cap is an example of a sesamoid bone.
There’s more to bones than the hard, white substance you think of when you 
envision one. For starters, the shaft or middle region of a long bone is called 
the diaphysis. Each end of a long bone is called the epiphysis. Both are joined 
by the physis, also called the growth plate. The periosteum of the bone is a 
strong, fibrous membrane that covers the surface, except at the ends. Bones 
other than long bones are completely covered by the periosteum.
 
Fractures are often classified by a system called the Salter-Harris system, which 
identifies whether a fracture involves the epiphysis, physis, diaphysis, or 
some combination of all three.

125
 Chapter 12: Boning Up on the Skeletal System
Beneath the periosteum is a level of osteoblasts, which deposit calcium and 
phosphorus compounds in the bony tissue. Articular cartilage covers the 
ends of long bones. This cartilage layer cushions the bones where they meet 
with other bones, or at the joints. The compact bone is made of dense tissue 
lying under the periosteum in all bones. Within the compact bone is a system 
of small channels containing blood vessels that bring oxygen and nutrients to 
the bone and remove waste products such as carbon dioxide.
Cancellous bone, sometimes called spongy bone, is more porous and less 
dense than compact bone. Spaces in cancellous bone contain red bone 
marrow, which is richly supplied with blood and consists of immature and 
mature blood cells in various stages of development. The ribs, the pelvic 
bones, the sternum or breastbone and vertebrae, as well as the epiphyses of 
long bones, contain red bone marrow within cancellous tissue. Figure 12-1 
illustrates the skeleton.
Axial skeleton
Think of the word axis when you think about the axial skeleton. The bones 
that make up this particular part of the skeleton tend to encircle important 
organs or rotate in an axial motion. The axial skeleton includes the heavy hit-
ters in this section.
Cranium
The bones of the cranium (skull) protect the brain. The bones of the skull 
include the frontal bone, which forms the forehead and bony sockets that 
contain the eyes. The parietal bone forms the roof and upper sides of the 
skull. Two temporal bones form the lower sides and base. The mastoid pro-
cess is a small round part of the temporal bone behind the ear.
The occipital bone forms the back and base of the skull and joins the parietal 
and temporal bones, forming a suture (a joining line) of cranial bones. The 
occipital bone has an opening called the foramen magnum through which the 
spinal cord passes. The sphenoid bone extends behind the eyes and forms 
part of the base of the skull. It joins the frontal, occipital, and ethmoid bones 
and serves as an anchor to hold these bones together. The ethmoid bone is a 
thin delicate bone, supporting the nasal cavity and forms part of the orbits of 
the eyes.
 
Be careful when working with a newborn cranium, as the cranial bones of a 
newborn are not completely joined. There are gaps of unossified tissue (tissue 
that is still in the fibrous membrane stage) in the skull, called the soft spot or 
fontanelle. The lines where the bones of the skull join are called cranial sutures. 
The pulse of blood vessels can be felt under the skin in these areas.

Facial bones
All the facial bones except one are joined together. Only the mandible, or 
lower jaw bone, is capable of moving, which is necessary for chewing and 
speaking. Other facial bones include the nasal bones, and the maxillary 
bones. Two large bones compose the upper jaw. Both the mandible and 
maxilla contain sockets called alveoli, in which the teeth are embedded. The 
mandible joins the skull at the temporal bone, forming the lengthily named 
temporomandibular joint. The zygoma or zygomatic bones form the cheek. 
Vertebral column
The vertebral column, or spinal column, is composed of 26 bone segments 
called vertebrae (singular vertebra), which are arranged in five divisions: 
cervical, thoracic, lumbar, sacrum, and coccyx (tailbone).
The first seven vertebrae are called the cervical vertebrae (C1-C7). These ver-
tebrae do not join with the ribs. The first cervical vertebra, C1 (also known as 
the atlas), articulates with the occipital bone of the skull at the back of neck. 
It supports the head and allows it to move forward and back. The second 
cervical vertebra, C2 (the axis), acts as a pivot, about which the atlas rotates, 
allowing head to turn from side to side, extend, and flex. 
The second division consists of 12 thoracic vertebrae (T1-T12). These verte-
brae join with the 12 pairs of ribs. The third division consists of five lumbar 
vertebrae (L1-L5). They are the strongest and largest of the back bones. The 
sacrum is a slightly curved triangular bone, composed of five separate seg-
ments, or sacral bones, that gradually become fused. The coccyx is the tail-
bone. It is also a fused bone, formed from four small coccygeal bones. 
 
The Greek diskos means “flat plate.” An example is the lumbar disk. And 
coccyx comes from the Greek word for cuckoo; it resembles a cuckoo’s beak.
A vertebra is composed of a disk-shaped portion called the vertebral body, 
which is the solid anterior portion (closest to body front, farthest from the 
body back). A lamina is a part of the posterior (back) portion of a vertebra. 
Spinous processes, thoracic processes, and transverse processes are little wing-
like projections that project or extend from each vertebra. The foramen is the 
opening in the middle of each vertebra that the spinal cord passes through.
Between the body of one vertebra and the bodies of vertebrae lying beneath, 
are vertebral disks which help to provide flexibility and cushion shock to the 
vertebral column. 

128
Part III: In Terms of Anatomy 
Thorax
The thorax (not to be confused with something invented by Dr. Seuss) starts 
with the clavicle, or the collarbone, connecting the sternum (breastbone) to 
each shoulder. The scapula is the shoulder blade, consisting of two flat trian-
gular bones, one on each back side of the thorax. The scapulae extend to join 
with the clavicle at the acromion.
The sternum is the breastbone, the flat bone extending down the midline 
of the chest. The uppermost part of the sternum joins to the sides of the 
clavicle and ribs, whereas the other, narrowed portion is attached to the dia-
phragm. The lower portion of the sternum is the xiphoid process, the small, 
mobile bone tag on the very end of the sternum. This is the thing you would 
feel for when placing your hands on a chest to perform CPR. The 12 pairs of 
ribs are close neighbors with the sternum. The first seven pair join the ster-
num anteriorly (at the chest) by attachments of costal cartilage. Ribs 1–7 are 
called true ribs. Ribs 8–12 are called false ribs. The false ribs join with the 
vertebral column in the back, but join the 7th rib anteriorly and do not attach 
to the sternum. Ribs 11 and 12 are called floating ribs because they are com-
pletely free at their anterior end.
Pelvis
The pelvic girdle or hip bone is a large bone that supports the trunk of the 
body and joins with the femur (thigh bone) and sacrum. The adult pelvic 
bone is composed of three pairs of fused bone: the ilium, the ischium, and the 
pubis.
The ilium is the uppermost and largest portion. The connection between the 
iliac bones and the sacrum is so firm that they are often referred to as one 
bone, the sacroiliac. The iliac crests are found on both the anterior and poste-
rior portions of the pelvis. They are filled with red bone marrow and serve as 
an attachment for abdominal wall muscles.
The ischium is the posterior portion of the pelvis. The ischium and the muscles 
attached to it are what we sit on.
The pubis is the anterior portion containing two parts that are joined by way 
of a disk. This area of fusion is called the pubic symphysis. The region within 
the bone formed by the pelvic girdle is called the pelvic cavity. The rectum, 
sigmoid colon, bladder and female reproductive organs are contained in this 
cavity.

 Chapter 12: Boning Up on the Skeletal System
Appendicular skeleton
Think of the word appendage when your thoughts turn to the appendicular 
skeleton. Your reachers, grabbers, and hoofers are all covered in this section. 
Appendages fall into two major categories of bones. 
Upper extremeties
Arms and hands are part of this category. The bones of the arm and hand 
include the humerus, the upper arm bone. The large head of the humerus is 
round and joins the scapula and clavicle. The ulna and radius are the bones 
of the lower arm or forearm. The bony prominence of the ulna at the elbow 
is called the olecranon. Carpals are wrist bones. Finally, there are two rows of 
four bones. The metacarpals are five bones radiating to the fingers. Phalanges 
(the singular is phalanx) are the finger bones.
Each finger has three phalanges: the proximal, middle, and distal. The proximal 
is the phalange closest to the point of origin, whereas the distal is farthest from 
the point of origin. So, the proximal would be the first after the knuckle, the 
middle would be in the middle, and the distal at the fingertip. The thumb has 
only two phalanges: medial and distal at tip of the thumb.
 
Diaphysis comes from Greek diaphusis, meaning “state of growing between.” 
Diaphysis is the shaft of long bones that grows as children grow.
Leg and foot
The femur is the thigh bone. At the top end of it, a rounded head fits into a 
socket in the hip bone called the acetabulum. The patella, or kneecap, is a 
small flat bone that lies in front of the joint between the femur and one of 
the lower leg bones called the tibia. The tibia is the largest of the two lower 
bones of the leg, often referred to as the shin bone. The fibula is the smaller 
of the two bones.
The tarsals, or ankle bones, are short bones that are much like the carpal 
bones of the wrist, but larger. The calcaneus, the largest of these bones, is 
also called the heel bone. Metatarsals compose the forefoot or bones leading 
to the phalanges in the toes. There are two phalanges in the big or great toe 
and three in each of the other four toes. Just like the fingers, all the bones in 
the toes are phalanges, from proximal to distal. In the big or great toe they 
are called the proximal and distal, differing slightly from the thumb.
 
The femur is the longest bone in the body.

Joints
Now think about the “glue” that holds all these bones together. Okay, joints 
aren’t really made of glue, but they sure do a good job of keeping everything 
connected. Let us articulate that concept a bit better: Joints, also called artic-
ulations, are the coming together of two or more bones. Some are not mov-
able, such as the suture joints between the cranial bones. Some joints only 
partially move, such as joints between the vertebrae.
Most joints do allow movement. These freely movable joints are called synovial 
joints. An example is the ball and socket type — the hip joint, for example, in 
which the head of the femur fits into the acetabulum. Another synovial joint is 
the hinged type as seen at the elbow, knee, or ankle joints.
The bones of a synovial joint are separated by a capsule, composed of fibrous 
cartilage. Ligaments of connective tissue hold the bones together around 
the capsule to strengthen it. The bone surfaces at a joint are covered with a 
smooth surface called the articular cartilage. The synovial membrane is the 
inner layer of the capsule, the layer beneath the capsular surface. 
The synovial cavity is filled with a lubricating fluid produced by synovial 
membranes. This fluid contains water and nutrients that help to lubricate the 
joints so that friction on the articular cartilage is minimal. 
Bursae (singular bursa) are closed sacs of synovial fluid lined with synovial 
membrane. They lie in the spaces between tendons, ligaments, and bones 
and lubricate areas where friction would normally develop close to the joint 
capsule. The olecranon bursa at the elbow joint and the patellar bursa at the 
knee are examples of bursae.
Skeletal Root Words
Now that you’ve gotten to know the specific parts of the skeletal system a 
bit better, it’s time to put your expertise into practice by breaking down the 
root words into meanings and useful applications. The roots, as always, are 
essential medical terminology knowledge because once you master these 
roots (those good ol’ Greek and Latin ones, that is), you can break down any 
skeletal-related word and discover its meaning.

Common Skeletal Conditions
Breaks, sprains, and bunions are no fun. Many of the most common maladies 
associated with the skeletal system involve the application of casts or other 
corrective devices. Good, old-fashioned fractures (a sudden break of the 
bone) top the list of skeletal conditions. Whether a result of an auto accident 
or just plain clumsiness (come on, like you didn’t see that curb jump out at 
you!), any bone in your body is a potential break waiting to happen. 
You are probably familiar with many common bone conditions because 
you’ve likely experienced one of them.
 
✓ Bunion is an abnormal prominence with bursal swelling at the metatar-
sophalangeal joint near the base of the big toe.
 
✓ Bursitis is an inflammation of a bursa. Tennis elbow is an example of 
bursitis of the olecranon bursa.
 
✓ Dislocation is a displacement of a bone from its joint. Dislocations may 
be reduced or restored to their normal condition and the joint immobi-
lized with sling or strapping for healing of torn ligaments and tendons.
 
✓ Sprain, everyone’s favorite, is trauma or injury to a joint with pain, 
swelling, and injury to ligaments.
Break it to me gently, Doc
Don’t think every fracture is a run-of-the-mill 
break. You’d be surprised at how complicated 
a fracture can be. Here’s a sampling from the 
fracture menu:
 ✓ Closed fracture: Bone is broken with no 
open wound in the skin.
 ✓ Comminuted fracture: Bone is splintered, 
crushed, or completely detached.
 ✓ Compression fracture: Bone is compressed; 
occurring in the vertebrae.
 ✓ Greenstick fracture: Bone is partially bent 
and partially broken, like when a green 
stick breaks. Often occurs in children.
 ✓ Impacted fracture: Bone is broken with one 
end wedged into the other.
 ✓ Open (compound) fracture: Broken bone 
with an open skin wound.
Treatment of fractures includes reduction, 
restoring the fracture to its normal position. 
There are two types of reduction:
 ✓ Closed reduction involves a manipulated 
reduction without an incision.
 ✓ Open reduction features an incision into the 
fracture site to restore normal position.
Once the fractured bone is set, a fiberglass or 
plaster of Paris cast, which is a solid mold of the 
body part, is applied to the injured area while 
healing takes place.

136
Part III: In Terms of Anatomy 
Possibly the most painful is the protrusion of an intervertebral disk, an abnormal 
extension of the intervertebral pad into the neural canal. This is commonly 
referred to as a herniated disk or slipped disk.
The bones can also experience conditions due to deformity and growths. 
Talipes, also known as clubfoot, is a congenital deformity of the bones of 
the foot. The bones are twisted out of shape or position. Exostoses are bony 
growths (benign tumors) on the surface of a bone.
Let’s not forget our old friend, arthritis, the inflammation of a joint. Speaking 
of old, this condition is not limited to seniors. Arthritis knows no age, and it 
has several permutations:
 
✓ Ankylosing spondylitis is a chronic arthritis with stiffening of joints, 
particularly the spine. This condition responds to corticosteroids and 
anti-inflammatory therapy.
 
✓ Gouty arthritis (gout) is inflammation of joints caused by excessive uric 
acid in the body. An inherited defect in metabolism causes excessive 
uric acid to accumulate in the blood, joints, and soft tissues near the 
joints. Gout commonly occurs in the big (great) toe.
 
✓ Osteoarthritis is chronic inflammation of bones and joints due to degen-
erative changes in the cartilage. This occurs mainly in the hips and legs. 
Drug therapy reduces the inflammation and pain, and physical therapy 
loosens impaired joints.
 
✓ Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic disease where joints become inflamed 
and painful. In rheumatoid arthritis, the small joints of the hands and 
feet are usually affected first, and the larger joints later.
Finding the Culprit: Skeletal 
Diseases and Pathology
Some conditions affecting the skeletal system are more complicated and are 
considered pathological diseases, which are diseases that occur because of 
structural or functional changes caused by a disease. Some may sound familiar 
to you, including osteoporosis, a decrease in bone density due to loss of calcium. 
Osteoporosis may occur as part of the aging process or due to corticosteroid 
therapy.

137
 Chapter 12: Boning Up on the Skeletal System
Two other diseases with the osteo- root are osteomyelitis and osteogenic sarcoma. 
The former is an inflammation of the bone and bone marrow due to infection. 
Bacteria enters the body through a wound, spreads from an infection near the 
bone, or originates in a skin or throat infection. Infection occurs in the long 
bones of the arm and leg, which can lead to an abscess and, if the bone dies, 
a sequestrum (a segment of dead bone) may develop. Osteogenic sarcoma is a 
malignant tumor of bone. Similarly, Ewing’s tumor is a highly malignant metas-
tasizing tumor (Ewing’s sarcoma) involving the entire shaft of a long bone. It 
occurs in children and adolescents. 
 
Most lesions associated with osteogenic sarcoma occur just above or below 
the knee.  
Inflammation is not just for muscles and soft tissues. Bones can become 
inflamed as well. Rickets is inflammation of the spinal column, characterized 
by osteomalacia or softening of bone. It is a disease of infancy and childhood 
when bones that are forming fail to receive the calcium and phosphorus they 
need. Bones become soft and bend easily. 
 
Rickets and osteogenic sarcoma are most common in childhood.
Testing, Testing: Skeletal Radiology 
and Diagnostic Tests
X-rays of bones and joints are common procedures to identify fractures or 
tumors, to monitor healing of a fracture, and to identify abnormal structures. 
The major methods to the skeletal madness are as follows:
 
✓ Arthrocentesis: Surgical puncture of a joint to aspirate fluid for diagnos-
tic purposes
 
✓ Arthrogram: X-ray film of a joint
 
✓ Arthroscopy: Visual examination of the interior of a joint using an 
arthroscope
 
✓ Bone densitometry (bone density): Determines the density of bone, 
performed to diagnose osteoporosis
 
✓ Bone scan (nuclear medicine test): Detects presence of metastatic 
disease of the bone and monitors degenerative bone disease

138
Part III: In Terms of Anatomy 
 
✓ Computerized tomography (CT): Gives accurate definition of bone 
structure and can demonstrate even slight changes
 
✓ Fluoroscopy: Examination using a fluoroscope, a device used to examine 
deep body structures by means of X-rays
 
✓ Magnetic resonant imaging (MRI): Evaluates all soft tissues and is espe-
cially useful for assessing the ligaments, tendons, muscles, spinal steno-
sis, and degenerative disk changes; great for anything that doesn’t show 
up on an X-ray
 
✓ Single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT): A very 
sensitive nuclear method for detecting bone abnormalities 
Paging Dr. Terminology: Skeletal 
Surgeries and Procedures
Both bones and joints can be repaired with surgery. Joints can be surgically 
fixed with arthrodesis or surgically repaired with arthroplasty. There are three 
types of arthroplasties:
 
✓ Total hip replacement arthroplasty is performed for degenerative joint 
disease or arthritis. The surgery involves replacement of the head of the 
femur of the hip joint with a prosthetic (artificial) metallic femoral head 
and a plastic-coated replacement acetabulum (a cup that the femoral 
head fits into).
 
✓ Total knee joint replacement arthroplasty is performed to replace worn 
surfaces of the knee joint. Various prostheses are used in this procedure.
 
✓ Metatarsal arthroplasty is performed to treat deformities associated 
with rheumatoid arthritis or hallux valgus (a deformity of the big toe), 
and to treat painful or unstable joints. 
 
Remember the root arthro when discussing joints. Arthritis is the inflammation 
of a joint, and most of the surgical procedures for joints use the same root 
arthro.

139
 Chapter 12: Boning Up on the Skeletal System
 
The lone exception to the arthro rule is synovectomy, which is the excision of 
synovial membrane of a joint.
The head and spine have several surgical options. A craniotomy, an incision 
into the skull, allows access to the brain for surgery. A diskectomy is an exci-
sion of an intervertebral disk. On the other hand, a percutaneous diskectomy 
is a procedure that uses fluoroscopy to guide insertion of a Nucleotome into 
a spinal disk, to remove the thick, sticky nucleus of the disk. Nucleotome is 
a registered brand name for instruments and protocol used to perform an 
automated percutaneous lumbar diskectomy. This allows the disk to soften 
and contract, relieving the lower back and leg pain. The excision of a lamina 
relieves symptoms of a ruptured disk, and a spondylosyndesis is the fusing 
together of the vertebrae (spinal fusion). A lamina is a part of the posterior 
(back) portion of a vertebra.
Don’t forget about fixing the appendicular skeleton (remember those good 
old appendages?). Fixing an arm or leg bone is about more than wrapping it 
in a cast. Consider these surgical options:
 
✓ Meniscectomy: Excision of a meniscus for a torn cartilage in the knee
 
✓ Osteoclasis: Surgical breaking of a bone to correct a deformity
 
✓ Osteoplasty: Surgical repair of a bone
 
✓ Osteotomy: Incision into a bone
 
✓ Patellectomy: Excision of the patella
 
✓ Tenorrhaphy: Suturing of a tendon
 
✓ Tenotomy: Incision of a tendon

T
hink about this the next time you hit the gym: Your body is the proud 
owner of more than 600 muscles! Luckily, you don’t have to pump a dif-
ferent weight machine to work every single one. The beauty of the muscular 
system is that it is, in fact, a system in which different major muscle groups 
work together at the same time.
So relax and don’t stress too much about that rowing machine. You’re using 
muscles right now reading this book.
How the Muscular System Works 
The musculoskeletal system is made up of muscles and joints. The muscles — 
all 600 of them and more — are responsible for movement. The skeleton pro-
vides attachment points and support for muscles, but it’s the muscle tissue’s 
ability to extend and contract that makes movement happen. So, for every 
climb of the elliptical machine, you can thank muscular tissue for making it 
possible. 
Muscles make up the major part of fleshy portions of the body and account 
for one half of body weight. Muscles vary in proportion to body size, and the 
shape of the body is determined by muscles covering bones.

142
Part III: In Terms of Anatomy 
Muscular expanding and contracting doesn’t just happen in your biceps. 
It happens all over the body. Muscles support and maintain posture and 
produce body heat. They help form many internal organs and regulate the 
work those organs do behind the scenes (such as the heart, uterus, lungs, 
and intestines) even when the body is not moving. The muscles of arteries, 
intestines, heart, and stomach, for example, are always at work even when 
we aren’t thinking of them. However, the silent work muscles do inside your 
body is wholly different from more obvious muscular work done by your 
arms and legs, for example.
Internal movement involves the contraction and relaxation of involuntary 
muscles, muscles that we cannot consciously control. For example, heart-
beats are performed by cardiac muscles. Breathing and digestion are facili-
tated by muscles called visceral (involuntary) muscles, whereas external 
movement is accomplished by contraction and relaxation of muscles that 
are attached to bones. The muscles that provide this external movement are 
known as voluntary muscles, as they perform movements on command. 
 
All bodily movement, whether lifting of an arm, or the beating of the heart, 
involves the contraction and relaxation of voluntary or involuntary muscles.
Classes of muscles
The class system is alive and well, at least as far as your muscles are con-
cerned. There are three classes of muscles: skeletal, visceral, and cardiac.
 
✓ Cardiac (involuntary striated) muscle has branching fibers and forms 
most of the wall of the heart. Its contraction produces the heartbeat.
Tendons: The ultimate wingmen
You’ve gotta have friends, and so do your 
muscles. For a moment, think of the muscular 
system as a party where people are looking for 
a date. You are the muscle, and you’re looking 
for a bone. The tendon is your “wingman” (the 
one who makes the introductions to the oppo-
site sex). A tendon helps muscles make contact 
with bones. There are tendons on each end of 
skeletal muscles because a muscle needs to 
be attached to two bones to make movement 
possible. Each muscle has a point of origin and 
a point of insertion. Muscles are attached to a 
stable bone at the point of origin and to a moving 
bone at the point of insertion, and this allows 
for movement when a muscle contracts and 
relaxes. And they all lived happily ever after. 

143
 Chapter 13: Getting Ripped: The Muscular System
 
✓ Skeletal (voluntary striated, meaning striped) muscles, are attached to 
the skeleton. They are called voluntary, of course, because they are con-
trolled by your will. This type of muscle can be easily seen by flexing the 
forearm, which makes the bicep muscle become hard and thick.
 
✓ Visceral (involuntary smooth) muscle is found in the stomach, intes-
tines, and blood vessels, and cannot be controlled at will.
 
Unlike other muscle, cardiac (heart) muscle keeps beating even when 
removed from the body, as in a heart transplant. And even if it stops beat-
ing, it can be jump started with an external electrical charge Not so the other 
muscles.
Types of muscles
Oh, if it were only that easy. But there are also types of muscles. At first 
glance, the types of muscles are the same as the classes of muscle. But pay 
close attention and you’ll see there are subtle differences. There are three 
types of muscles in the body.
Striated muscle
Striated muscles are also called skeletal or voluntary muscles. These are the 
muscles that move all the bones, as well as the face and the eyes. The body is 
able to consciously control the activity of a striated muscle. 
Smooth muscle
The second type of muscle is smooth muscle, also known as visceral, involun-
tary or unstriated muscle. The body has no conscious control over smooth 
muscles, which move the internal organs such as the digestive tract. The 
smooth muscles are also found in blood vessels and secretory ducts leading 
from glands. 
 
Skeletal muscle fibers are arranged in bundles, but smooth muscles form 
sheets of fibers that wrap around tubes and vessels. 
Cardiac muscles
The third type of muscle is cardiac muscle. It is striated in appearance but is 
like smooth muscle in its actions. Movement of cardiac muscle cannot be con-
sciously controlled. Cardiac muscle has branching fibers forming most of the 
wall of the heart and controlling the contractions producing the heartbeat. 

144
Part III: In Terms of Anatomy 
Muscles and tendons
Now that you know the classes and types of muscles, let’s take a more in-
depth look at how they work. You already know that skeletal muscles, or 
striated muscles, are the muscles that move the bones of the body. Now get 
ready for the scoop on what makes it possible. 
When a muscle contracts, one of the attached bones remains stationary, as 
a result of other muscles holding it in place. The point of attachment of the 
muscle to the stationary bone is called the origin or beginning of that muscle. 
When the muscle contracts, another bone to which it is attached, does move. 
The junction of the muscle to the bone that moves is called the insertion of 
the muscle. Near the point of insertion, the muscle narrows and is connected 
to the bone by a tendon. One type of tendon that helps attach bone to mus-
cles is called an aponeurosis. 
Round-up of the superficial muscles
Sometimes, being superficial isn’t a bad thing. Take, for example, your super-
ficial muscles, so named because these are the ones you’re most likely to see 
with the naked eye. These workhorses of the muscular system help make you 
unique. Though they all have complicated-sounding names, they help your 
body perform everyday functions like picking up objects and smiling.
Figures 13-1 through 13-4 illustrate four major muscle groups.
 
✓ Arm muscles consist of the upper arm muscles, biceps brachii and 
triceps brachii. In the forearm (lower arm) are the flexor and extensor 
muscles of the hands and fingers.
Tell me more: Describing muscles
Oh sure, you could use good old, standard 
English adjectives to describe muscles and 
their characteristics, but why not have some 
fun? Try these descriptives on for size:
 ✓ Gracilis: Slender
 ✓ Latissimus: Wide
 ✓ Longus: Long
 ✓ Orbicularis: Surrounding
 ✓ Rectus: Straight
 ✓ Serratus: Sawtoothed
 ✓ Transversus: Crosswise
 ✓ Vastus: Great, big 

145
 Chapter 13: Getting Ripped: The Muscular System
 
✓ Head and face muscles include the frontalis, temporalis, orbicularis oculi, 
orbicularis oris, occipitalis, mentalis, buccinator, zygomatic major and 
minor, and the masseter muscle.
 
✓ Shoulder and neck muscles include the sternocleidomastoid, pectora-
lis major, latissimus dorsi, and trapezius muscle, leading to the deltoid 
muscle of the shoulder.
 
✓ The major chest muscles consist of the diaphragm, pectoralis major, 
the rectus abdominis, and the external oblique. Also associated with this 
region is the linea alba. The linea alba (meaning “white line”) is a verti-
cal band of connective muscular tissue that begins at the xiphoid process 
(sternum) and ends at the symphysis pubis (where hip bones meet). 
 
✓ The major muscles of the back include the seventh cervical vertebra, 
infraspinatus, supraspinatus, latissimus dorsi, and the rhomboid major 
muscle.

The seventh cervical vertebra muscle is a muscle, whereas the seventh verte-
bra is a bone. Many muscles, tendons, and ligaments have the same name but 
don’t have the same function. In this case, the 7th cervical muscle is a point of 
attachment aiding in support and movement of head and neck.
 
✓ The pelvis and anterior thigh muscles include the tensor fascia lata, the 
adductors of the thigh, the vastus lateralis and vastus medialis, the rectus 
femoris, and the quadriceps. 
 
✓ The lower leg muscles from the knee to the ankle includes the gastroc-
nemius, which makes up a large portion of the calf muscles, the tibialis 
anterior, soleus, peroneus longus, and peroneus brevis. By the way, things 
aren’t always what they seem: The Achilles tendon is technically classi-
fied as a muscle.
 
✓ From the back, the buttocks are composed of the gluteus maximus and 
gluteus medius. In the thigh, the adductor magnus, vastus lateralis, gracilis, 
whereas the biceps femoris, semitendinosus and semimembranosus com-
bined comprise the hamstrings.

Part III: In Terms of Anatomy 
So, the moral of our muscle story is teamwork. Bones cannot move alone 
without being attached to muscle. Muscles cannot move alone, without being 
attached to stationary bones to allow support for that movement. Neither 
bones nor muscles could function without the attachments provided by the 
tendons and ligaments. Body movement then, is made possible by the bones 
and skeletal muscles working together in addition to the visceral and cardiac 
muscles that function to maintain the muscular rhythm of our vital organs. 
It’s all one big, happy family of muscles.
Muscular Roots and Suffixes
Let’s put your new-found expertise into practice by breaking down the root 
words into meanings and useful applications. The roots are essential medi-
cal terminology knowledge, because once you master these roots (good ol’ 
Greek and Latin ones, that is), you can break down any muscular-related 
word and discover its meaning.
 
Don’t confuse myo (muscle) with myelo (bone marrow).
Root words, combining forms, and suffixes associated with the skeletal 
system include the ones shown in Tables 13-1 and 13-2.

Action Item: The Movement 
of Your Muscles
Your muscles do a serious amount of work every single hour of every day. 
Though you may be reading this book propped up on some pillows while 
munching corn chips, your muscles are at work — muscles are moving your 
eyes across the words so you can read and comprehend, smooth muscles 
are working your organs, and superficial muscles are helping keep your body 
upright. Turns out, for every muscular action, luckily for you, there is a word 
to describe it. Here are just a few muscular action words to remember:
Unofficialoma
Unofficial but not uncommon slang includes 
incidentaloma, which refers to something found 
on a study, which is not particularly important 
or else not relevant to the study at hand, but still 
worth noting. There’s also fascinoma, some-
thing weird and noteworthy: “Hey, check this 
out, it’s a real fascinoma.”

Part III: In Terms of Anatomy 
 
✓ Abduction: Movement of drawing away from the center of the body 
(such as fingers spread apart)
 
✓ Adduction: Movement of drawing toward the middle of the body (i.e. 
fingers held together)
 
✓ Eversion: Turning outward
 
✓ Extension: Movement in which a limb is placed in a straight position
 
✓ Flexion: Movement in which a limb is bent
 
✓ Inversion: Turning inward
 
✓ Pronation: Movement that turns the palm of the hand downward
 
✓ Rotation: Turning around on its own axis
 
✓ Supination: Movement that turns the palm of the hand upward
 
To remember the difference between -ectomy and -otomy, remember -ectomy 
with e for exit or excision and -otomy for o to open only.
Common Muscular Conditions
Muscular conditions are fairly common in people of all ages and backgrounds. 
From tennis elbow to the enigmatic fibromyalgia, the muscular system can 
take a real beating. Here are the most common muscular conditions:
 
✓ Bursitis: Inflammation of the bursa sac, which lines the joint and pro-
vides smooth joint movement
 
✓ Fibromyalgia: Pain in fibrous tissues of muscles, tendons, or ligaments
 
✓ Myoparalysis: Paralysis of a muscle
 
✓ Tennis elbow: The tendon that connects the arm muscle to elbow 
becomes inflamed due to the repetitive use of the arm
 
 The actual medical term for this is lateral or medial epicondylitis (lateral 
if referring to the bump on the outside of the elbow, medial to the bump 
on the inside).
 
✓ Tendinitis or tendonitis: Inflammation of a tendon
 
✓ Tenosynovitis: Inflammation of the tendon and the sheath around it, 
often in a finger or the wrist

Diseases and Pathology
Some of the most serious diseases affect the muscular system. From diseases 
that affect facial movement to the full-body atrophy of Lou Gehrig’s disease, 
these diseases are all challenging: 
 
✓ Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS): Movement disorder or muscle 
atrophy with degeneration of nerves in the spinal cord and lower region 
of the brain, also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease
 
✓ Dupuytren’s contracture: Disease affecting the palmar fascia of the 
hand, causing the ring finger and little finger to contract towards the 
palm
 
✓ Leiomyoma: Benign tumor of smooth muscle
 
✓ Leiomyosarcoma: Malignant tumor of smooth muscle
 
✓ Myasthenia gravis: Lack of muscle strength with paralysis, characterized 
by weakness of muscles of the face and jaw, with difficulty swallowing
 
✓ Myosarcoma: Malignant tumor of muscle tissue
 
✓ Muscular dystrophy: Inherited disease characterized by progressive 
weakness and degeneration of muscle fibers without involvement of the 
nervous system
 
✓ Polymyalgia rheumatica: Muscle pain, common in shoulder or pelvis, 
without arthritis or signs of muscle distress
 
✓ Rotator cuff disease: Inflammation of tendons, and if they fuse you have 
a larger problem, a condition called frozen shoulder or adhesive capsulitis
 
✓ Torticollis: Acute myositis of the cervical muscles (wryneck)
Testing, Testing: Muscular Radiology 
and Diagnostic tests
Though the list of muscular conditions and diseases is quite long, there are 
some simple diagnostic tests doctors can perform to diagnose most muscular 
ailments.

✓ Electromyogram (EMG) is a record of electric activity in a muscle. 
This procedure is done to diagnose carpal tunnel syndrome. 
Electromyography is an electrical recording of activity in a muscle.
 
✓ MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): The gold standard for making pic-
tures of soft tissue such as fascia, tendons, ligaments and muscle.
 
✓ X-ray: Picture of the bones.

Surgeries and Procedures
Now that your muscles have been poked, prodded, tested, and diagnosed, it’s 
time to fix what’s broken. Most of these procedures are surgical in nature. 
 
Many surgeries are performed arthroscopically, through a scope inserted 
into or near a joint space, with one lone endoscopic rogue, Palmar uniportal 
endoscopic carpal tunnel release. This is also called a Mirza technique, an endo-
scopic method for release of carpal tunnel, previously accomplished by open 
surgery. 
The surgical players are
 
✓ Fasciectomy: Excision of fascia (fibrous band or membrane of tissue 
surrounding muscle)
 
✓ Myoplasty: Surgical repair of a muscle
 
✓ Myorrhaphy: Suturing of a muscle
 
✓ Tenodesis: Surgical fixation of a tendon
 
✓ Tenomyoplasty: Surgical repair of a tendon and muscle
 
✓ Tenorrhaphy: Suturing of a tendon
 
✓ Tenotomy: Incision of a tendon
It’s All Related: More Muscular Terms
While the makeup of the muscular system is pretty straightforward, there 
are still all sorts of useful terms you need to know in order to communicate 
about your muscles. Try a few of the words from Table 13-3 on for size.

Nails, and Hair
In This Chapter
▶ Finding out how your integumentary system works
▶ Determining root words, prefixes, and suffixes appropriate to this system
▶ Using terminology of the integumentary system to discuss common conditions and 
diseases
▶ Discovering the right terms to use when diagnosing problems
Your skin (the body’s largest organ), glands, nails, and hair — also known 
as the integumentary system — serve as the “public face” of your body. 
Consider it your marketing team, letting the world know by their condition 
how healthy the rest of your body is. Healthy skin, along with accessory 
organs glands, hair, and nails, are the hallmarks of healthy insides, so care 
for them accordingly. 
Layers of Skin
Like an onion, your skin has several layers, and there is much more to it than 
what you see with the naked eye. The skin is a system of specialized tissue, 
containing glands that secrete fluids, nerves that carry impulses, and blood 
vessels that assist in the regulation of body temperature.
 
Integumentum means “covering.” This system is the body’s covering, made up 
mostly of skin, but with the help of the accessory organs.
The skin has almost as many jobs as it has layers. The skin acts as a protec-
tive membrane that is a barrier against microorganisms, and it protects 
organs from injury. Skin helps maintain and regulate body temperature and 

156
Part III: In Terms of Anatomy 
acts as a receptor for sensation (hot, cold, touch, and pain). The skin helps 
rid the body of waste products. It also guards deeper tissues of the body 
against excessive loss of water, salts, and heat. Secretions from the skin are 
somewhat acidic in nature and contribute to its ability to fight off bacterial 
invasion.
The skin has the large responsibility of keeping you cool. The many different 
tissues in the skin help maintain the body temperature. Nerve fibers coordi-
nate this thermoregulation by carrying messages to the skin from heat centers 
in the brain that are sensitive to changes in the body temperature. Nerve 
impulses cause blood vessels to dilate to bring blood to the surface where 
the heat can dissipate and cause sweat glands to produce the watery secre-
tion that evaporates, thereby acting as your cooling system.
The skin is the most important player in the integumentary system, and is 
made up of three layers. The outer layer is the epidermis, a thin, cellular 
membrane layer. The second layer is the dermis, dense fibrous connective 
tissue. The third layer is the subcutaneous tissue, fat-containing tissue that 
joins the skin to underlying muscle.
The structure of skin varies throughout the body. It is stretchable and tough 
and has different thicknesses. It is thick on the palms of the hands and soles 
of the feet, but thin on the eyelids. The skin is initially firm and elastic, but 
with age, becomes wrinkled, drier, and saggy, especially around the eyes, 
mouth, and neck. The skin covering palms of the hand and soles of the feet is 
different from that covering the rest of the body. The skin on fingers and toes 
has patterns of ridges that never change and are unique for each individual, 
and, as you know from crime dramas, provide a basis for the use of finger-
prints as a means of positive identification.
Epidermis
The epidermis is the outer, totally cellular layer of skin. It is composed of epi-
thelium. Epithelium covers both internal and external surfaces of the body. 
The epidermis has no blood vessels, lymphatic vessels, connective tissue, 
cartilage, or fat. It depends on the deeper dermis, or corium, layer and its 
network of capillaries for nourishment. Oxygen and nutrients from the capil-
laries in the dermis pass through tissue fluid, supplying nourishment to the 
deeper levels of the epidermis.
The deepest layer of the epidermis is called the basal layer. Cells in the basal 
layer are always growing and multiplying. As the basal layer cells divide, they 
are pushed upwards and away from the blood supply of the dermis layer by a 
steady stream of younger cells. These cells shrink, lose their nuclei, die, and 

157
 Chapter 14: Skin Deep: Skin, Glands, Nails, and Hair
become filled with a hard protein called keratin. They are then called horny 
cells, reflecting their composition of keratin. Within a 3–4 week period after 
living as a basal cell in the deepest part of the epidermis, the horny kerati-
nized cell is sloughed off from the surface of the skin. The epidermis, then, is 
constantly renewing itself.
Cells die at the same rate at which they are born. The basal layer of the 
epidermis contains cells called melanocytes. Melanocytes contain a black 
pigment called melanin. The amount of melanin accounts for the color differ-
ences in skin. Darker skin possesses more active melanocytes, not a greater 
number of melanocytes. Melanin in the epidermis is vital for protection 
against harmful ultraviolet radiation, which can manifest as skin cancers. 
Individuals, who through a flaw in their chemical make-up are incapable of 
forming melanin, are called albino, meaning white. Their skin and hair are 
white and their eyes are red (because of the absence of pigment, the tiny 
blood vessels are visible in the iris).
Dermis
The dermis, the second layer, below the epidermis, is also called the corium. 
The dermis differs from the epidermis in that it is living tissue composed of 
blood, lymph vessels, and nerve fibers, as well as the accessory organs of 
the skin. These accessories include the hair follicles, sweat glands, and oil 
glands.
To support this system of nerves, vessels, and glands, the dermis contains 
connective tissue cells and fibers. The dermis is composed of different types 
of connective tissue cells: fibroblasts, histiocytes, and mast cells. Fibroblast 
cells act to repair an injury to the skin. Histiocytes protect the body by sur-
rounding foreign materials. Mast cells contain histamine, a substance released 
in allergies that causes itching.
Fibers in the dermis are composed of collagen. Collagen, meaning “glue,” is 
a fibrous protein material found in bone, cartilage, tendons, and ligaments 
as well as the skin. It is tough, but also flexible. In an infant, collagen is loose 
and delicate but it becomes harder as the body ages. Collagen fibers support 
and protect the blood and nerve networks that pass through the dermis.
 
Hair shafts in the dermis have bundles of involuntary muscle called arrector 
pili attached to hair follicles. When you are frightened or cold, these muscles 
contract, the hair stands up, and “goosebumps” appear on the skin.

158
Part III: In Terms of Anatomy 
Subcutaneous layer
The subcutaneous layer of the skin is made up of connective tissue that spe-
cializes in the formation of fat. Lipocytes, plentiful in the subcutaneous layer, 
manufacture and store large amounts of fat. Areas of the body vary as far 
as fat deposition is concerned. This layer of skin is important in protecting 
deeper tissues of the body and also acts as a heat insulator. The subcutane-
ous layer connects the dermis to the muscles and organs below it. Its fat 
tissue insulates inner structures from temperature extremes.
Glands, Both Sebaceous and Sudoriferous
The skin has two types of glands that, as accessory organs, produce impor-
tant secretions. These glands under the skin’s surface are called the seba-
ceous (oil) glands and the sudoriferous (sweat) glands.
The sebaceous glands produce an oily secretion called sebum, whereas 
the sudoriferous glands produce a watery secretion called sweat. Sebum 
and sweat are carried to the outer edges of the skin by ducts and excreted 
through openings in the skin called pores. Sebum helps lubricate the skin. 
Sebaceous glands are closely associated with hair follicles, and their ducts 
open into the hair follicle through which the sebum is released. 
Sebaceous glands are influenced by sex hormones. This causes them to be 
overactive at puberty and underactive in old age. This explains the excess oil 
production of the skin at puberty and gradual drying of the skin as we age.
Stinking it up: Your sweat glands
Sweat gets a bad rap for being smelly when, 
in fact, it’s not your fault. Your body’s smell is 
caused by bacteria. Sweat or perspiration is 
almost pure water, with dissolved materials 
such as salt making up less than 1 percent of 
its total composition. Sweat is actually color-
less and odorless. The odor produced when 
sweat accumulates is due to the action of bac-
teria on it. 
Certain sweat glands, active only from puberty 
onward and larger than ordinary sweat glands, 
are concentrated near the reproductive organs 
and in the axillae (armpits). These glands 
secrete an odorless sweat that contains sub-
stances that are easily broken down by skin 
bacteria. The breakdown products are respon-
sible for the characteristic “human body odor.” 
So the next time someone tells you your sweat 
stinks, you can say, “I beg to differ. My bacteria 
is the culprit.”
The ceruminous glands are classified as modi-
fied sweat glands and are found in the ear 
canal. These glands produce a yellow waxy 
substance called cerumen (ear wax).

159
 Chapter 14: Skin Deep: Skin, Glands, Nails, and Hair
Sudoriferous (sweat) glands are tiny coiled glands found on almost all body 
surfaces. You have about 2 million of them in your body. There are many 
more in the palms of the hands, and you’d fine approximately 3000 glands 
per square inch on the sole of your foot. The tiny openings on the surface 
are called pores. Sweat helps cool the body as it evaporates from the skin 
surface. Nerve fibers under the skin detect pain, temperature, pressure, and 
touch. The adjustment of the body to its environment depends on the sen-
sory messages relayed to the brain and spinal cord by the sensitive nerve 
endings in the skin. 
 
Diaphoresis comes from the Greek dia, meaning “through,” and phoreo mean-
ing “I carry.” Translated, it means “the carrying through of perspiration.”

Hair and Nails
A hair fiber is composed of a network of horny cells (hold your giggles, please) 
filled with hard protein called keratin. Hair growth is similar to the growth of 
the epidermal layer of the skin. Deep-lying cells in hair roots move forward 
through the hair follicles, or shafts, that hold the hair fiber. Melanocytes 
located at the root of hair follicles supply the melanin pigment for the hair 
fiber. Hair color depends on the amount of melanin present, as it does with 
the color of the skin. Because hormone production decreases as we get older, 
the hair loses color and becomes transparent (which we see as gray).

160
Part III: In Terms of Anatomy 
Nails are hard keratin plates that cover the dorsal (top) surface of the last 
bone of each toe and finger. Nails are composed of horny cells that are 
cemented together and can extend indefinitely until cut or broken. A nail 
grows in thickness and length by division of the cells of the nerve root, at the 
base of the nail plate. Nails grow approximately 1 millimeter a week, which 
means that fingernails may regrow completely in 3–5 months. Toenails grow 
more slowly than fingernails, but if you have lost a toenail due to a nasty 
stubbing incident, it will come back eventually.
Integumentary Root Words
Now that you’ve gotten to know the specific parts of the integumentary 
system a bit better, it’s time to put your expertise into practice by tracking 
down the meaning of root words and checking out their useful applications.

Common Integumentary Conditions
Of all the conditions that plague the integumentary system, ones affecting the 
skin tend to be the most obvious and troublesome issues. From that odd, dis-
colored freckle on your arm to run-of-the-mill acne, the list of unsavory and 
often embarrassing lesions is long. Take a look:
 
✓ Bulla: Large vesicle or blister (plural: bullae)
 
✓ Comedo: Common blackhead caused by a buildup of sebum and keratin 
in a skin pore (plural: comedones)
 
✓ Cyst: Small sac or pouch containing fluid or semisolid fluid
 
✓ Fissure: Groove or crack-like sore
 
✓ Macule: A discolored lesion that lies flush with the skin (freckles, tattoo 
marks, and moles)
 
✓ Papule: Solid elevation of the skin
 
✓ Polyp: Mushroom-like growth extending on a stalk
 
✓ Pustule: Discrete raised area of pus on the skin
 
✓ Ulcer: Open sore or erosion of the skin
 
✓ Vesicle: Collection of clear fluid (blister)
 
✓ Wheal: Smooth elevated area that is red and itchy (such as hives). 
Lesions aren’t alone, though. A host of conditions affect the entire integumen-
tary system. The majority of them, however, still affect the skin more than 
other parts of the system:
 
✓ Alopecia: Hair loss. Can result normally from aging process or be drug 
or illness-induced
 
✓ Cicatrix: Scar left by a healed wound

163
 Chapter 14: Skin Deep: Skin, Glands, Nails, and Hair
 
✓ Ecchymosis: Purplish macular bruise, hemorrhage into the skin
 
✓ Keloid: Abnormally raised, thickened scar
 
✓ Petechia: Small pinpoint hemorrhage (plural: petechiae)
 
✓ Pruritus: Itching, associated with forms of dermatitis
 
✓ Purpura: Merging ecchymoses with petechiae
 
✓ Urticaria: Hives with localized swelling with itching
 
✓ Vitiligo: Loss of pigment in area of skin or milk-white patch
Another important one is burn: injury to tissues caused by heat, flame, elec-
tricity, chemicals, or radiation contact. A first-degree burn is superficial with 
no blister and superficial damage in epidermis. A second-degree burn, or 
partial thickness burn, blisters and causes damage to epidermis and dermis. 
A third-degree burn is full-thickness, damaging the epidermis, dermis, and sub-
cutaneous layer.
Finding the Culprit: Integumentary 
Diseases and Pathology 
Once again, the skin is the major player when it comes to ailments. Surely the 
hair, nails, and glands won’t feel too left out of this motley group of patho-
logical conditions and diseases. The most popular pathological conditions 
include the following:
 
✓ Acne: Inflammatory pustular eruption of skin (acne vulgaris is the 
common variety)
 
✓ Decubitus ulcer: Bedsore
 
✓ Eczema: Inflammatory skin disease with reddened papular lesion; a 
common allergic reaction in children
 
✓ Gangrene: Death of tissue associated with loss of blood supply
 
✓  Impetigo: Bacterial inflammatory skin disease presenting with vesicles, 
pustules, and crusted lesions; caused by bacteria
 
✓ Psoriasis: Chronic (ongoing) skin ailment with silver-gray scales cover-
ing red patches
 
✓ Scleroderma: Disorder affecting all connective tissue that causes abnor-
mal tissue thickening usually on fingers, hands or face
 
✓ Tinea: Infection of the skin caused by a fungus

164
Part III: In Terms of Anatomy 
There are also viral diseases that result in eruptions of skin from the infection. 
These include
 
✓ Rubella: German measles
 
✓ Rubeola: Measles
 
✓ Varicella: Chickenpox
Sometimes, the skin experiences skin neoplasms, also known as “new 
growth.” These are often benign and can include the following:
 
✓ Hemangioma: A cluster of blood vessels that make an abnormal but 
benign growth, often protruding from the skin; some birthmarks are 
hemangiomas
 
✓ Keratosis: Thickened area of the epidermis (wart, callus)
 
✓ Nevus: Mole (plural: nevi)
 
✓ Seborrheic keratosis: Thick, flattened, beige/brown plaques that appear 
commonly on hands and face with age; sometimes called senile warts
 
✓ Verruca: Warts
Unfortunately, the news from the dermatologist can often be serious enough 
to warrant further testing and may involve the “Big C” — cancer. Basal cell 
carcinoma, for example, is a malignant tumor of the basal cell layer of epi-
dermis. It is the most common type of skin cancer and is slow growing, usu-
ally occurring on upper half of the face near the nose. It does not spread. 
Squamous cell carcinoma is a malignant tumor of the squamous epithelial cells 
of the epidermis. This tumor may arise from actinic or sun-related keratoses 
and may metastasize to lymph nodes. Malignant melanoma is a cancerous 
tumor composed of melanocytes. Tumors often metastasize or spread to 
liver, lung, and brain. Finally, mycoses fungoides is a rare chronic skin disease 
caused by the infiltration of malignant lymphocytes. It is characterized by 
large red raised areas that spread and ulcerate; malignant cells may involve 
lymph nodes. 
Testing, Testing: Integumentary 
Radiology and Diagnostic tests
There are two major ways that dermatologists and their colleagues diagnose 
issues with the integumentary system by taking a tissue sample from the 
body. These two types of tests involve the winning combination of bacteria 
and fungus. Bacterial analysis and fungal testing are laboratory tests in which 
the doctor takes cultures or swabs and then examines them in the lab.

165
 Chapter 14: Skin Deep: Skin, Glands, Nails, and Hair
 
✓ Bacterial analysis is performed by taking a sample of a purulent or pus-
filled material or exudates (fluid that accumulates in the space or passes 
out of tissue). The sample is then sent for examination to determine 
what type of bacteria is present.
 
✓ Fungal testing occurs when scrapings from skin lesion are placed on a 
growth medium for several weeks and then examined for evidence of 
fungal growth.
Paging Dr. Terminology: Integumentary 
Surgeries and Procedures
Many of the more common, everyday integumentary conditions can be fixed 
or improved via in-office or outpatient procedures. These procedures aren’t 
necessarily pretty, but they sure do get the job done. They are as follows:
 
✓ Debridement is the removal of dirt, foreign material, or damaged tissue 
from a wound to prevent infection and promote healing.
 
✓ Incision and drainage involve cutting open a lesion such as an abscess 
to remove or drain contents.
 
✓ Intradermal test is performed by injection of a reactive substance 
between layers of the skin to observe for a reaction. This test is used to 
detect sensitivity to infectious agents such as tuberculosis (the Mantoux 
test) or PPD (purified protein derivative) test, or the test for diphtheria 
(the Schick test). Strong reactions indicate ongoing infection, or previ-
ous exposure.
 
✓ Patch skin test is performed by applying a piece of gauze or paper to 
the skin, on which has been placed an allergy-causing substance. If area 
becomes red and swollen, the result is positive. 
 
✓ Punch biopsy is used to obtain tissue in cases in which complete exci-
sion is not necessary or possible. Involves using a surgical instrument 
that removes a core of tissue by rotation of its sharp edge.
 
✓ Sclerotherapy is used in the treatment of varicose veins. Injecting the 
vein with a sclerosing solution irritates the tissue, causes swelling, and 
closes off the vein.
 
✓ Skin biopsy is removal of living tissue for microscopic examination. Skin 
lesions that might be in danger of producing a malignant change are 
removed and sent for pathologic examination. 
 
✓ Skin scratch test involves making several scratches in the skin and 
injecting a very minimal amount of test material into the scratches; a 
test is considered negative if no reaction occurs.

We Americans are a vain people, no doubt. Cosmetic surgery is practically 
a pastime in the United States. But consider that this type of surgical proce-
dure can be about more than looking and feeling younger. Cosmetic surgery 
is a vital field that helps people recover from all sorts of serious wounds. For 
example, cosmetic surgery helps the person with the scarred face caused in 
an auto accident, the woman mourning the loss of a breast to cancer, or the 
child born with a facial deformity. Some of the most common surgical proce-
dures in this field are the following:
 
✓ Blepharoplasty is surgical reduction of the upper and lower eyelids.
 
✓ Cryotherapy involves destruction of tissue by freezing with liquid 
nitrogen.
 
✓ Dermabrasion means scraping away of the top layer of skin using sand-
paper or wire brushes to remove tattoos or disfigured skin. 
 
✓ Dermatoplasty is surgical reconstruction of the skin. Typically, the 
surgical replacement of injured or diseased skin.
 
✓ Electrolysis is destruction of tissue by electricity and is used to remove 
unwanted body hair.
 
✓ Laser therapy involves removal of skin lesions such as papillomas and 
hemangiomas using an intense beam of light. This can also be used to 
remove tattoos or warts from around the nails or on the soles of feet.
 
✓ Liposuction is surgical removal of fat from subcutaneous tissue by 
means of suction.
 
✓ Rhytidectomy means removal of wrinkles by removal of excess facial 
skin. Also known as a facelift.

ou can thank your sensory systems for all the fun you get to have in life. 
While your other, also very important, systems handle the background 
work that keeps you running, the senses let your body have a little fun. What 
you see, hear, smell, touch, and taste makes life the enjoyable experience it 
is. So the next time you’re smelling some truly fantastic barbecue or watching 
a dazzling fireworks display, be grateful for your senses.
The Eye
For humans, the eye is the most important sense organ — the Big Kahuna of 
the senses. Sight provides the most information for us, for what we see, of 
course, but that includes what we can read. The eye is located in the orbit 
(the bony protective cavity of the skull). The eye lets light in, focuses it, 
transforms it into nerve impulses, and sends these impulses to the brain. 
Here’s how: Light rays enter the eye via an adjustable opening, the dark 
center of the eye, called the pupil, which regulates the amount of light 
allowed in. Behind the pupil is the lens, which focuses the light. The lens is 
not rigid and it can adjust its shape in order to adapt to near and far objects. 

170
Part III: In Terms of Anatomy 
The light is focused by the lens into the back of the eye, where it strikes the 
retina. The retina transforms the focused image into nerve impulses that 
travel along the optic nerve to the occipital lobe of the brain for processing.

The eye consists of the inner eye (the eyeball) and the outer eye (the facial 
structures and eye muscles surrounding the eye).

 Chapter 15: It Depends on Your Perception: The Sensory Systems
Inner eye
The inner eye is made up of three layers.
The outer layer contains the cornea and the sclera. The cornea is the trans-
parent anterior portion of the eye. It allows light in and aids in the focusing of 
light onto the back of the eye. The sclera is the white of the eye, providing a 
protective covering for the eyeball.
The middle layer, the uvea, consists of the choroids, the ciliary body, and the 
iris. The choroids, the inner lining of the sclera, contain blood vessels that 
nourish the eye. The ciliary body consists of the ciliary muscles and the cili-
ary process. The muscles adjust the shape of the lens for focusing, and the 
process produces a watery substance, aqueous humor, bathing the anterior 
region of the eye. The iris is the circular colored portion of the eye. The open-
ing in the iris, the pupil, regulates the amount of light that enters the eye. In 
bright light, muscle fibers in the iris contract the pupil. These muscles relax 
in dimmer light, and the pupil resumes its normal size. Radial muscles in 
the iris enlarge the pupil beyond normal size when a person is stressed or 
excited, called dilation.
The inner layer is the retina, which has layers of nervous tissue called cones 
and rods. Each of your eyes has approximately 6 million cones and 120 mil-
lion rods in the retina. The cones are more sensitive in light than the rods. 
Color and sharpness of vision depend on the cone cells. Rods function better 
in dim light and are helpful in night vision. One small area of the retina has 
no cones or rods and doesn’t produce a visual image. Called the optic disc 
or blind spot, it’s the entry point for the major blood vessels of the eye and 
where the optic nerve crosses from the brain into the eye. 
Check your lenses
The lens is not considered part of one of the 
layers of the eye. As light passes through, it 
is bent. The bending is called refraction. The 
refracted light must be focused on the retina for 
a clear image. In order to focus light, the lens 
changes shape. The ciliary muscles change its 
shape to allow for clear vision of far and near 
objects. This lens changing is called accommo-
dation. When a person reaches his or her 40s, the 
lens loses some of its elasticity, causing difficulty 
focusing light from near objects. Reading glasses 
provide the refraction that the lens can no longer 
perform. The lens loses its transparent quality 
with age, becoming thick and dense and some-
times opaque and cloudy and interfering with the 
refraction of light rays. This results in a common 
condition, cataracts. Cataracts, once a leading 
cause of serious vision lost, are now routinely 
removed surgically.

172
Part III: In Terms of Anatomy 
In front of and in back of the lens are two cavities. The anterior (front) cavity 
contains aqueous humor produced by the ciliary processes. This watery fluid 
flows freely from the posterior chamber, through the pupil, to the anterior 
chamber. Inability to drain aqueous humor causes increased intraocular pres-
sure. This condition, known as glaucoma, can result in blindness because of 
damage caused to the retina and optic nerve, by the extra pressure. Equal 
production and drainage maintains the equilibrium of the intraocular pres-
sure. The posterior (back) cavity of the eye is filled with clear, jelly-like mate-
rial called vitreous humor. This preserves the spherical shape of the eyeball, 
holding the retina firmly against the choroid. Both the aqueous and vitreous 
humors function to further refract light rays. 
Outer eye
The outer eye consists of the orbital cavity, the ocular muscles, the eyelids, 
conjunctival membrane, and lacrimal apparatus. The orbital cavity is the bony 
depression that the eyeball fits. Ocular muscles attach to the sclera and move 
the eye. Eyelids shield the eye from light, dust, and trauma. The conjunctival 
membrane lining the eyelids and the anterior part of the eye exposed to the 
air provides protection and lubrication.
The lacrimal apparatus produces, delivers, and drains tears from the eye, pro-
viding cleaning and lubricating. The lacrimal glands produce the tears, which 
are continuously delivered to the eyes by the lacrimal ducts. Small openings 
called punctae drain tears from the eyes into channels in the nose. This is the 
reason you nose runs when you cry. Tears clean and lubricate the eye as well 
as fight infectious microorganisms.
 
Cataract comes from the Greek kato, meaning “down,” and raktos, meaning 
“precipice.” Combined, they can be interpreted as “waterfall.” Through a cata-
ract, sight is like a waterfall or misty. Glaucoma — Greek glaukos — means 
“blue-grey,” and oma means “a condition.” In glaucoma, a gray color replaces 
the black pupil.
The Ear
The ear has two functions: to hear and to help provide the body’s balance 
or equilibrium. We can hear because sound waves vibrate through the ear 
where they are transformed into nerve impulses that are then carried to 
the brain. The sensations of sound are heard within the nerve fibers of the 
cerebral cortex.

The ear is divided into three separate regions: the outer, middle, and inner 
ear. The outer and middle ears look after the conduction of sound waves 
through the ear. The inner ear contains the structures that carry the waves 
to the brain.
The short version of your ears
Some of the most common ear-related abbre-
viations include
 ✓ AC: Air conduction
 ✓ AD: Right ear (auris dextra)
 ✓ AS: Left ear (auris sinistra)
 ✓ AU: Both ears (aures unitas)
 ✓ BC: Bone conduction
 ✓ HD: Hearing distance
 ✓ ENT: Ear, nose, and throat
 ✓ OM: Otitis media

174
Part III: In Terms of Anatomy 
Outer ear
Sound waves are encouraged toward the ear canal by the auricle, or pinna, 
the visible outer ear, the hard, arching cartilage that forms the outer ear 
curve, the tragus, that hard little flap of cartilage that sticks out in front of the 
ear canal, and the earlobe.
From the pinna, the external auditory meatus is lined with numerous glands 
that secrete a yellowish waxy substance called cerumen. Cerumen (ear wax) 
lubricates and protects the ear. Sound waves travel through the auditory 
canal and strike the tympanic membrane or eardrum, located between the 
outer and middle ear.
Middle ear
As the eardrum vibrates, it moves three small bones or ossicles that make up 
the middle ear. Ossicles conduct the sound waves through the middle ear. 
These bones in the order of their vibration are the malleus, the incus, and the 
stapes. As the stapes moves, it touches a membrane called the oval window, 
which separates the middle ear from the inner ear. Another part of the 
middle ear is the auditory or eustachian tube, a canal leading from the middle 
ear to the pharynx. The eustachian tube equalizes air pressure on both sides 
of the eardrum. 
Inner ear
The inner ear is also called the labyrinth because of its circular, maze-like 
structure. The part of the labyrinth that leads from the oval window is a 
bony, snail-shaped structure called the cochlea. The cochlea contains audi-
tory liquids that the vibrations travel through. In the cochlea is a sensitive 
auditory receptor called the organ of Corti. Tiny hair cells in the organ of 
Corti receive vibrations from the auditory liquids and relay the sound waves 
to auditory nerve fibers, which end in the auditory center of the cerebral 
cortex. It is there that these impulses are interpreted and “heard.”
 
Tympanic membrane comes from the Greek tympanon, meaning “drum,” 
because it resembles a drum (hence eardrum). Stapes, Latin for “stirrup,” was 
named, not surprisingly, for its stirrup-like shape.

175
 Chapter 15: It Depends on Your Perception: The Sensory Systems
The ear is also an organ of equilibrium or balance. The three organs within the 
inner ear responsible for equilibrium are the semicircular canals, the saccule, 
and utricle. These organs contain a fluid called endolymph, as well as sensitive 
hair cells. The fluid and hair cells fluctuate with movement of the head and 
transmit impulses in nerve fibers leading to the brain. Messages are then sent 
to muscles throughout the body so that equilibrium (balance) is maintained.
The Nose
Our sense of smell, though not as important to humans as it is to animals, 
basically performs the same purpose. An animal’s sense of smell is acute, as 
it warns of danger and acts as a guide in finding food. We aren’t so different, 
more in degree than in kind — we can smell smoke before we see fire, and we 
all know about smelling good food.
The olfactory epithelium of the nose is the organ of smell. Olfactory (olfact 
refers to smell) receptors in the root (area between eyes) of the nose are 
stimulated by odor, and chemical messages are transmitted to the olfactory 
bulb and sent to the olfactory centers of the brain. We can smell six basic 
odors: fruity, flowery, spicy, burned, putrid, and resin. The sense of smell 
acts to complement the taste sense, which is why a clogged nose with a head 
cold interferes with smelling, and food loses its flavors.
Demystifying deafness
Deafness is diminished or total loss of hearing, 
and there are two types.
Conductive hearing loss is caused by obstruc-
tion of the path travelled by the sound waves 
from the external ear to the inner ear. Examples 
could be build-up of ear wax (cerumen), or a 
foreign body lodged in the external auditory 
meatus. Conductive deafness can be treated 
by removal of the obstruction. 
Sensorineural deafness results from the 
damage to the auditory nerve or cochlea, 
preventing nerve stimuli from reaching the 
brain from the inner ear. This can occur with 
age but also can be caused by loud noises from 
machinery, music, tremors, infection, or injury. 
Hearing aids can help in treating sensorineural 
deafness. However, if a hearing aid is not suc-
cessful, cochlear implants may be needed to 
have hearing restored.

176
Part III: In Terms of Anatomy 
(Because this chapter is about the special senses, we’re really dealing with 
the nose’s sense of smell. The mucus, hairs, and septum (the part separating 
the nostrils) have nothing to do with smelling. But, if you’re so inclined to 
know more about them, check out Chapter 17.)
 
You have 60 million olfactory epithelium cells in your nose. Way to go!
The Mouth
The organs of taste are the taste buds, found on the tongue and in the mucous 
membranes lining the soft palate of the mouth.
We can distinguish only four primary tastes: sweet, sour, salty, and bitter; the 
variety of tastes we experience are mixtures of the four, much as the colors 
we see are mixtures of the three primary colors. For food to initiate the sen-
sation of taste, it must be dissolved by saliva, which is why taste buds are 
in a moist area. Much that we think we taste is really smelled, and the taste 
depends on the odor. Our sense of taste and smell work together in this way. 
 
You have 10,000 taste bud papillae on surface of your tongue.
The Touch Receptor
The skin (which is the body’s largest organ) is our only touch receptor. Touch 
sensation, often referred to as light pressure, varies in different parts of the 
body. The sensitive areas are those that provide the most information about 
ourselves and the external environment. Lips and fingers have the most 
receptors, in a concentrated area, which is why we use them more than, say, 
our elbows, to touch and identify objects.
The dermis of the skin has nerve endings that act as the receptors. They 
sense hot and cold, pain, pressure, and touch. The nervous system carries 
messages to the brain when changes to temperature, injury, or pressure 
occurs. For more information on your skin, see Chapter 14.
Sensory Root Words
Get ready. The sensory systems use a lot of root words, prefixes, and suffixes, 
and with good reason. Consider that this set of systems includes some deli-
cate and sophisticated body parts: eyes, ears, nose, mouth, and skin. It’s no 
wonder that we need a lot of combining forms and roots to fully describe the 
wonders of the senses.

Common Sensory Conditions
Though it may seem obvious, it deserves being said. Most of the conditions 
associated with smell and taste involve the body’s inability to perform those 
sensory tasks. Having trouble smelling your spring flowers? Can’t taste your 
famous five-alarm chili? Chances are that it’s dues to one of these conditions:

182
Part III: In Terms of Anatomy 
 
✓ Ageusia: Lack of or impairment of taste
 
✓ Anosmia: Absence of sense of smell
 
✓ Dysgeusia: Abnormal or perverted sense of taste
 
✓ Dysosmia: Impaired sense of smell
 
✓ Hypergeusia: Excessive or acute sense of taste
 
✓ Osmesis: The process of smelling
As usual, the eye is infinitely more complicated than, say, your tongue. So it 
stands to reason that there are many more possible conditions associated 
with your sense of sight. Though common, all of these conditions are serious 
and should not be taken lightly. They are 
 
✓ Chalazion: Small, hard mass on the eyelid due to oil gland enlargement
 
✓ Esotropia: A type of strabismus (one eye turns inward, cross-eyed)
 
✓ Exotropia: A type of strabismus (one eye turns outward)
 
✓ Glaucoma: Increased intraocular pressure
 
✓ Hemianopia (hemianopsia): Loss of one half of the visual field (the 
space of vision of eye)
 
✓ Hordeolum (sty or stye): An infection of the oil gland of the eyelid
 
✓ Nystagmus: Involuntary, rapid movements of the eyeball
 
✓ Retinal detachment: The retina, or part of it, becomes separated from 
the choroid layer
 
✓ Strabismus: Abnormal deviation of the eye; also called a squint
Moving on to the other complicated sense organ, the ear, you can see that 
quite a few of these conditions result in some from of hearing loss. Some are 
unavoidable, but thankfully, some of these can be avoided by exercising good 
hygiene and staying away from rock concerts (or at least wearing ear plugs). 
 
✓ Macrotia: Abnormal enlargement of the pinna (excessively large ears)
 
✓ Microtia: Abnormally small pinna (excessively small ears)
 
✓ Myringitis: Inflammation of tympanic membrane
 
✓ Otalgia: Pain in the ear (earache)
 
✓ Otitis externa: Inflammation of the outer ear; also known as 
swimmer’s ear
 
✓ Otitis media: Infection of the middle ear

183
 Chapter 15: It Depends on Your Perception: The Sensory Systems
 
✓ Tympanitis: Inflammation of the middle ear (otitis media)
 
✓ Serous otitis media: Inflammation of the inner ear without infection
 
✓ Suppurative otitis media: Bacterial infection of middle ear
 
✓ Tinnitus: Ringing sound in ears; cause unknown, may be associated with 
chronic otitis, myringitis, or labyrinthitis
 
✓ Vertigo: Sensation of irregular or whirling motion, of body or external 
objects, due to severe disturbance of equilibrium organs in the labyrinth
Finding the Culprit: Sensory 
Diseases and Pathology

pathological diseases as any other site on the body. Some of the greatest hits 
include
 
✓ Acoustic neuroma: Benign tumor in acoustic nerve in the brain causing 
tinnitus, vertigo, and decreased hearing 
 
✓ Cataract: Clouding of the lens, causing decreased vision
 
✓ Cholesteatoma: Collection of skin cells and cholesterol in a sac in the

Testing, Testing: Sensory Radiology 
and Diagnostic tests
Your physician will want to run a battery of tests if you ever encounter prob-
lems with any of your senses, particularly with the eyes and ears. There is 
no doubt that your body and brain get a huge percentage of incoming infor-
mation from these two sense organs alone, and if you lose the capability for 
either, your entire world will change. These are tests to take very seriously:
 
✓ Audiogram: The graphed test results of audiometry
 
✓ Audiometry: An audiometer delivers acoustic stimuli of specific fre-
quencies to determine hearing for each frequency using an instrument 
to measure acuity of hearing
 
✓ Diathermy: The use of high-frequency electrical current to coagulate 
blood vessels within the eye
 
✓ Gonioscopy: Involves the examination of the angle of the anterior cham-
ber of the eye to diagnose glaucoma
 
✓ Laser photocoagulation: Used to treat diabetic retinopathy and senile 
macular degeneration
 
✓ Ophthalmoscopy: Visual examination of the interior of the eye
 
✓ Otoscopy: Visual examination of the ear with an otoscope
 
✓ Proetz test: Test for acuity of smell
 
✓ Slit lamp biomicroscopy: A microscopic study of the cornea, conjunc-
tiva, iris, lens, and vitreous humor
 
✓ Tonometry: Measurement of the tension or pressure within the eye
 
✓ Tuning fork test (Weber’s test): A vibration source (tuning fork) is 
placed on forehead to note sound perception on right, left, or midline
 
✓ Visual acuity: Test of clarity or clearness of vision; reading the Snedden 
eye chart of black letters in decreasing size with the chart at a distance 
of 20 feet. 20/20 vision indicates that letters can be clearly seen at that 
distance. 20/50 vision indicates the eye is able to see at 20 feet what it is 
supposed to be able to see at 50 feet.
 
✓ Visual field test: Test measures the area within which objects can be 
seen when the eye is fixed and looking straight ahead

Paging Dr. Terminology: Surgeries 
and Procedures
Thankfully, there is something that can be done about a lot of those common 
eye conditions and diseases. Surgical procedures for the eye have improved 
dramatically over time and often involve less invasive procedures. Either 
way, though, you might want to call a cab afterwards.
 
✓ Blepharoplasty: Surgical repair of the eyelid
 
✓ Cataract surgery: To remove the lens when a cataract has formed
 
✓ Cryoextraction of a cataract: This method uses a cold probe to the ante-
rior surface of the lens to lift the lens out as it adheres to the probe
 
✓ Enucleation: Surgical removal of the eye
 
✓ Keratoplasty: This procedure, also called a corneal transplant, involves 
replacement of a section of an opaque cornea with a normal transparent 
cornea in an effort to restore vision.
 
✓ Phacoemulsification: Removal of cataract
 
✓ Phacoemulsification of a cataract: Involves using ultrasonic vibration 
to break up portions of the lens. The lens is aspirated through the ultra-
sonic probe.
 
✓ Scleroplasty: Repair of the sclera
 
✓ Vitrectomy: Diseased vitreous humor is removed and replaced with 
clear solution.
Procedures for the ear are a bit more invasive, obviously, because so much 
is going on within the labyrinth of canals inside your head. Some of the most 
common clinical and surgical procedures for the ear include
 
✓ Fenestration: Forming an opening into labyrinth to restore hearing
 
✓ Labyrinthectomy: Excision of the labyrinth
 
✓ Mastoidectomy: Excision of the mastoid bone
 
✓ Mastoidotomy: Incision into the mastoid bone
 
✓ Myringoplasty: Surgical repair of the tympanic membrane
 
✓ Myringotomy: Incision of the tympanic membrane performed to release 
pus and relieve pressure in the middle ear

186
Part III: In Terms of Anatomy 
 
✓ Stapedectomy: Excision of the stapes
 
✓ Tympanoplasty: Surgical repair of the eardrum
 
✓ Tympanectomy: Surgical removal of the eardrum
Terminology RX: Sensory Pharmacology
Antibiotics, corticosteroids, and antivirals are often used to treat both ear 
and eye infections. Most eye infections are treated with topical drugs (oint-
ments, liquids or creams, topical meaning applied directly to the area, eye 
drops, ear drops, and antibiotics). Most ophthalmic antibiotics are classified 
as topical applications, as are corticosteroids used to treat inflammation often 
after surgery, trauma, or chemical contact. Here are some other sensory 
meds to know:
 
✓ Balanced salt solution (BSS) is used during eye surgery to irrigate and 
wash the eye.
 
 Do not confuse BSS with normal saline, as they are not the same. BSS is 
a registered ophthalmic preparation used in eye surgeries, a slightly dif-
ferent compound than normal saline, which is a sterile salt solution.
 
✓ Beta blockers are used to treat glaucoma.
 
✓ Mydriatic drugs (drugs that dilate the pupil) are used at eye examinations.
 
✓ Silver nitrate is commonly used as a topical anti-infective agent, admin-
istered to eyes of newborn infants to prevent infection.

E
ver wonder how we have fresh, clean water to drink? A vast network 
of lakes, reservoirs, pumping and purification stations, and pipes ulti-
mately bring us the life force that is water. We, in turn, use it for drinking, 
cooking, cleaning, and a multitude of tasks.
Your cardiovascular system is not so different. Consider your heart as the 
big central pumping station that supplies the rest of your body with valuable 
liquid — mainly, blood. Blood carries oxygen and nutrients to body tissues 
and collects carbon dioxide and waste materials to be eliminated. You can 
think of the complementary lymphatic system as the wastewater treatment 
facility that cleans and purifies what was once useless into clear, clean fluid. 
How the Cardiovascular System Works 
Let’s try another metaphor. Although the heart is the main character in this 
sweeping drama called Your Body, it couldn’t do its work without a strong 
cast of supporting characters: blood, blood cells, and vessels. The separate 

190
Part IV: Let’s Get Some Physiology Terminology 
but complementary lymphatic system works like ushers at a play, guiding no-
longer-useful folks out at the end of the show. None of these components can 
work alone. They are a merry band of players who must share the spotlight.
The main organ of the circulatory (another name for cardiovascular) system 
is the heart, of course, and its main job is making the blood flow freely 
through your veins. By pumping, the heart creates pressure that forces the 
blood to move throughout the body via a channel system of arteries and 
veins. That system reaches from the center of your chest out to the nether 
regions of your appendages and back again, insuring that life-giving and sus-
taining blood cells are carried through your entire body.
The lymphatic system works to complement the actions of the cardiovascu-
lar system by carrying lymph fluid through the body via a system similar to 
veins. The lymph fluid flows forward through a grouping of vessels, ducts, and 
nodes that filter the fluid before it re-enters the bloodstream. In this chapter, 
you find out more about the individual components of these two powerful 
systems and get to know the specific terminology associated with both. 
 
An adult human’s normal heart rate is 70–80 beats per minute. A child’s is 
100–120, an elephant’s about 25, a mouse’s 700, and a canary’s heart beats 
about 1,000 times per minute. Your heart beats around 100,000 times a day, 
pumping 21/2 ounces with each contraction. That’s 5 quarts a minute, 75 gal-
lons per hour, 1,800 gallons a day, and 657,000 gallons per year.
 
Greek plays a role in the roots of the word for heart, cardium. This word, 
which you’ll get to know quite well in this chapter, is taken from the Greek 
word kardia. Cardium takes on other identities in the commonly known forms 
of cardi and cardio. But make no mistake, it’s all the same root.
Now, meet the individual players responsible for the pumping of the red stuff 
that keeps you going every day. Each has its own special function and termi-
nology to go along with it. If watching ER is your only entrée into the world of 
medical terminology, fear not and consider this section your crash course in 
all things cardiovascular. 
The heart
To take a tour of the heart, consider three components: layers, chambers, 
and valves. Together, these elements form the most powerful muscle in the 
body. Located to the left of the midline of your chest’s center, this muscle, 
about the size of your fist, pumps a continuous stream of life-giving blood 
through your blood vessels.
Figure 16-1 illustrates the heart.

The heart is enclosed in a fluid-filled sac called the pericardium, located in the 
chest cavity just to the left of the midline. It consists of three major layers, 
each one performing a unique job in the day-to-day activities of your most 
vital organ. 
 
✓  Endocardium: Endo- is the Greek prefix for “within.” This is the inner 
layer of the heart, lining the chambers and covering the valves.
 
✓  Epicardium: Epi- is the Greek prefix for “on.” This is the outer layer of 
the heart.
 
✓  Myocardium: Myo- is the Greek prefix meaning “muscle.” This is the 
actual heart muscle and makes up the thick middle layer. 
The four hollow places in the heart are called chambers. There are two types 
of chamber: 
 
✓ Atrium: Atrium is taken from the Greek word atrion, meaning “hall.” The 
right and left atria (atrium is the singular form) are the two upper heart 
chambers serving as receiving stations for blood. Valves connect each 
atrium to the ventricles below. 
 
✓ Ventricles: Ventricle is taken from the Latin word venter, meaning “little 
belly.” The right and left ventricles are thick, lower chambers and are 
responsible for pumping blood. The atria receive blood from the body, 
and the ventricles pump blood back out into the body.

192
Part IV: Let’s Get Some Physiology Terminology 
The four heart chambers are separated by membranes called septa (plural 
of septum).
 
✓ Interatrial septum separates the two atria. 
 
✓ Interventricular septum separates the two ventricle chambers. 
Valves are the gatekeepers of the heart, making sure the blood flows in the 
correct direction. They let a specific amount of blood into each chamber and 
don’t allow it to flow backwards. The beauty of valve terminology is that the 
name of each valve gives you a clue to its make-up. 
 
✓ Bicuspid valve (also called mitral): The bi- prefix shows you that this 
valve has two flaps. 
 
✓ Pulmonary semilunar valve and aortic semilunar valve: Both have a 
half-moon shape, thus being named from semi (part) and lunar (moon).
 
✓ Tricuspid valve: Tri- indicates this valve has three flaps, keeping blood 
moving forward. 
Blood vessels
The vast network of blood vessels (made up of arteries and arterioles, veins 
and venules, and capillaries) begins at the heart and spans out through the 
entire body to the far reaches of the fingertips and toes. Together, these 
different types of vessels work to carry blood pumped by the heart through 
the body.
 
Arteries take care of clean, oxygenated blood. Veins handle the movement of 
deoxygenated blood. Your little friends, the capillaries, serve as mini bridges 
between the two types of vessels. 
Arterial system 
The arterial system is composed of arteries and arterioles (smaller arteries). 
The Greek aer is the basis for the word artery, meaning “air.” Combined with 
terein, meaning “to keep,” you get the word artery. Starting with the largest 
artery, the aorta, the arteries carry oxygenated blood away from the heart 
to the arterioles, and then on to the capillaries, where the exchange of gases 
(oxygen and carbon dioxide) takes place. 
 
The pulmonary artery, with its two branches, is the exception of the arterial 
world. Instead of carrying oxygen-filled blood to other parts of the body, its 
branches carry oxygen-deprived blood to the right and left lungs.

193
 Chapter 16: The Heart of the Matter: The Cardiovascular and Lymphatic Systems
Venous system
The venous system is made up of veins and venules (little veins). The veins 
are the workhorses of the vessel system, carrying oxygen-depleted blood 
back to the heart. The journey ends with the blood from the head and upper 
body being returned to the heart via the body’s largest veins, the superior 
vena cava, and from the lower body via the inferior vena cava, received into 
the right atrium. The pulmonary veins carry oxygen-rich blood from the 
lungs back to the heart.
Capillaries
If you look at a map of the blood vessel system, you see that capillaries are 
incredibly small and look tiny, like hair. It’s no accident, then, that the word 
capillary is Latin for “hair-like.” These super-tiny vessels (one cell thick, to be 
exact) bridge the gap between arterioles and venules to keep blood flowing in 
a continuous motion.
Figure 16-2 illustrates capillary exchange.

Part IV: Let’s Get Some Physiology Terminology 
Blood 
There’s more to the make-up of your blood than the obvious red blood cells. 
A large percentage of your blood is actually made up of plasma, which is, 
in turn, largely composed of water. The red and white cells, plus platelets, 
make up the rest of your ever-flowing life force. Here’s a bit more about what 
makes up your blood:
 
✓ Plasma: Mostly water, a small percentage of plasma is composed of pro-
teins, nutrients, waste, and gas. Albumin, fibrinogen, and immunoglobin 
are all proteins found in plasma. 
 
✓ Platelets: The body’s little firemen. Platelets are always putting out 
“fires” in the body by beginning the clotting process and putting a stop 
to any blood escaping from a compromised vessel. 
 
✓ Red blood cells: Also known as erythrocytes, these cells contain hemo-
globin, a protein composed of molecules containing globin and iron. Red 
blood cells carry oxygenated blood throughout the body. 
 
✓ White blood cells: Called leukocytes, these are the double agents of the 
cardiovascular system. They work as the body’s homemade antibiotics, 
fighting germs in both the bloodstream and in tissue fluid and lymph fluid. 
Path of the blood
Veins carry blood back to the heart via the superior and inferior venae cavae. 
The superior (meaning “near the top”) vena cava takes blood from the upper 
body to the right atrium; the inferior (meaning situated below) vena cava 
Following the trail of blood
A great way to remember much of the terminol-
ogy associated with the heart is to think more 
about the path the blood takes each time it 
makes a trip through the vast muscle. 
The rule of two will get you started. Remember 
that the heart has two different types of cham-
bers: ventricles and atria, which both contract 
at the same time. Similarly, the blood trav-
els through two paths: the arterial system for 
sending oxygen-rich blood out and the venous 
system for bringing oxygen-poor blood back. 
Next, try to think of the blood’s path as “The 
Hokey Pokey.” Remember? “You put your right 
foot in. You put your right foot out,” and so on. 
Think of where the blood goes in and out, and 
you can click through around fifteen cardiovas-
cular terms. Let’s follow it:
Left ventricle > aorta > arteries > arterioles 
> capillaries of body tissues > back through 
venules > veins > superior/inferior venae cavae 
> right atrium > right ventricle > pulmonary 
artery > alveoli of the lungs > lung capillaries > 
pulmonary veins > left atrium > left ventricle . . . 
and it begins again. Feel free to put this path to 
the music of your choice and sing along!

195
 Chapter 16: The Heart of the Matter: The Cardiovascular and Lymphatic Systems
carries blood from the lower body to the right atrium, which then empties 
the blood into the right ventricle. The ventricle contracts, expelling the blood 
into the pulmonary artery.
 
Pulmon is the Latin word for “lung.”
The pulmonary arteries carry the blood through to the lungs where it is oxy-
genated. From there, the pulmonary veins carry the oxygenated blood back 
to the left atrium, which then moves the blood into the left ventricle, which 
pumps the blood into the aorta.
 
Thank good old Aristotle for the word aorta, meaning “that which is hung.” 
The philosopher named it so because of the upside-down, hanging curve of 
the artery.
Cardiac cycle
All this pumping and moving of blood comes down to rhythm. The cardiac 
cycle is controlled by the heart’s natural pacemaker, the sinoatrial (SA) node. 
The rhythmic pulsations conduct through the AV node, down the AV bundle 
(also known as the bundle of His), through the Purkinje fibers, jump-starting 
contraction of the ventricles. 
There are two phases in the cardiac cycle:
 
✓ Diastole is the resting period, when the heart rests and fills with blood.
 
✓ Systole is the period when ventricles contract and send blood out, caus-
ing pressure on the walls of the arteries during the heart’s contraction.
 
Both words share a Greek root, stole, meaning “to send.” The difference lies in 
the prefix. Dia- means “apart,” whereas sy- means “together.”
How the Lymphatic System Works 
Most directly associated with immunity, we discuss the lymphatic system in 
the same chapter as the cardiovascular system due to the similar make-up of 
the system and the fact that, once cleaned by the lymph nodes, lymphatic fluid 
is released directly into the bloodstream. Lymph vessels are arranged in a simi-
lar pattern as the blood vessels, but work to clear the body of impurities.
Lymphatic vessels
 
Lymphatic vessels borrow their name from the fluid they pump, called, not 
surprisingly, lymph fluid. Curiously, at the heart of the word lymph is the Greek 
nymph, a term used to describe a beautiful maiden. The word eventually took 

196
Part IV: Let’s Get Some Physiology Terminology 
on Latin roots, when the n was replaced with l. Because lymph fluid is a clear, 
clean fluid, and lymph rhymes with nymph, the transition was apparent to 
Latin wordsmiths.
The lymphatic vessels interlace with blood vessels to carry clean lymphatic fluid 
through the body. They collect the proteins and water, which continually filter 
out of the blood into tissue fluid, and return to the blood. The proteins and water 
filter out of the blood and escape into tissue fluid. The lymphatic vessels pick up 
the proteins and water from the tissues and return them to the blood.
Lymph nodes, also called “glands”
Shaped much like small beans, the lymph nodes are located throughout the 
body. We discuss what the nodes do later in the chapter, but here is the low-
down on the location of these helpful little guys. Lymph nodes are located in 
several regions of the body. Depending on where they are, lymph nodes are 
known by different names, including 
 
✓ Axillary: Underarm and upper chest
 
✓ Cervical: Neck
 
✓ Inguinal: Groin 
Figure 16-3 illustrates a lymph node.
Lymphatic System
The lymphatic system is largely responsible for creating an immunity barrier 
by developing and distributing lymphocytes, a type of WBC (white blood cell) 
throughout the body. Lymphocytes are our little buddies, which you read 
about earlier. The lymph nodes release these lymphocytes and remove or 
destroy antigens (foreign substances that invoke an immune response) that 
circulate through the blood and lymphatic vessels. 
Lymph fluid enters the node, filters through sinuses within the node, and 
drains through a single exit vessel. Consider it a one-way ticket for lymph 
fluid to get into the bloodstream. This filter system cleans out all of the yucky 
stuff: bacteria, foreign particles, and those naughty malignant cells. The 
lymph nodes also destroy invading cells and particles in a process known 
as phagocytosis. The thoracic duct (there is only one) is the largest vessel of 
the lymph system. It collects lymph from the body below the diaphragm and 
from left side of body above the diaphragm.
The spleen, tonsils, and thymus are accessory organs of this system. The 
spleen enlarges with infectious diseases and decreases in size in old age. Some 
phagocytosis takes place in the spleen. The tonsils filter out bacteria and for-
eign matter. The thymus produces cells that destroy foreign substances.
Figure 16-4 illustrates the lymphatic system.

Common Cardiovascular and 
Lymphatic Conditions
Some cardiovascular conditions pertain specifically to the heart and sur-
rounding system of veins and arteries. First, let’s consider what can ail 
some of the individual parts of the heart. Aortic stenosis is the narrowing of 
the aorta. Endocarditis is the inflammation of the inner lining of the heart, 
whereas pericarditis is an inflammation of the pericardial sac (pericardium).

202
Part IV: Let’s Get Some Physiology Terminology 
Then there are conditions that involve the entire heart muscle, including car-
diomegaly, enlargement of the heart, and cardiomyopathy, disease of the heart 
muscle. Myocarditis is an inflammation of the muscle of the heart. The two big 
daddies are — no surprise here — a myocardial infarction, also known as a 
heart attack, and good old cardiac arrest, the sudden cessation or stoppage of 
cardiac output and effective circulation. Don’t forget congestive heart failure, 
angina, and atrial fibrillation. 
Our blood travels through the superhighway of our arterial and venous sys-
tems, and it carries a lot of passengers, from oxygen to lymph. Because it is 
so multifaceted, the blood and its cells can harbor all sorts of conditions. 
Here is a sampling:
 
✓ Anemia: Lack of red blood cells
 
✓ Dyscrasia: Abnormal or pathological condition of the blood
 
✓ Embolus (plural: emboli): Also called an embolism, the sudden blockage 
of an artery by foreign material in the bloodstream, most often a blood 
clot but could be fat, an air bubble, or a clot of bacteria
 
✓ Hemorrhage: Rapid flow of blood
 
✓ Hyperbilirubinemia: Excessive amounts of bilirubin (a bile pigment 
excreted by the liver) in the blood
 
✓ Hypercholesterolemia: Excessive amounts of cholesterol (steroid alco-
hol that maintains membrane fluidity) in the blood
 
✓ Hyperlipidemia: Excessive amounts of fat in the blood
 
✓ Hyperchromia: Excessive pigmented red blood cells
 
✓ Hypertension: Blood pressure that is above normal range of 120/70
 
✓ Hypotension: Blood pressure that is below normal
 
✓ Intermittent claudication: Pain or discomfort in a body part caused 
by any activity which exerts the affected body part; often occurs in the 
calves while walking; a result of occlusive artery disease
 
✓ Leukocytosis: Marked increased in the number of white blood cells
 
✓ Thrombolysis: Breakdown of a clot that has formed in the blood
The lymphatic system has its own fair share of health issues. Lymphadenitis 
is an inflammation of lymph nodes. Lymphedema is an accumulation of fluid 
due to obstruction of lymphatic structures. And splenomegaly is an enlarge-
ment of the spleen.

Finding the Culprit: Cardiovascular and 
Lymphatic Diseases and Pathology 
Pathology is a scary word, and for good reason. Pathology is the study of dis-
ease as it affects body tissue and function. Some conditions of the heart and 
lymph system are more serious and more risky than others. Although all con-
ditions and diseases should be considered serious, these heavy hitters are 
ones that often require more in-depth procedures and treatments. 
Why not start at — literally — the heart of the matter. Some pathological con-
ditions affecting the heart and blood vessels include
 
✓ Aneurysm, a local widening of an artery, may be due to weakness in the 
arterial wall or breakdown of the wall due to atherosclerosis.
 
✓ Angina pectoris is an episode of chest pain due to temporary difference 
between the supply and demand of oxygen to the heart muscle.
 
✓ Arterial hypertension refers to high blood pressure. There are two 
types of hypertension: essential and secondary. In essential hyperten-
sion, the cause of the increased pressure is unknown or idiopathic. In 
secondary hypertension, there is an associated lesion, such as nephritis, 
pyelonephritis or adenoma of the adrenal cortex, which is responsible for 
the elevated blood pressure. 
 
✓ Bacterial endocarditis is inflammation of the inner lining of the heart 
caused by bacteria. 
 
 Keep the three types of cardiac arrhythmia straight. The heart block is a 
failure of proper conduction of impulses through the A-V node and can 
be overcome by implantation of an electric pacemaker. A flutter is rapid 
but regular contractions of the atria or ventricles, while fibrillation is 
rapid, random irregular contractions of the heart as high as 350+ beats 
per minute. 
 
 Damage to the heart valves can produce lesions called vegetations, 
which may break off in the bloodstream as emboli or floating clots. 
Vegetation is an overgrowth of bacteria that gains a foothold on an 
injured valve, becoming fruitful and multiplying. 
 
✓ Cardiac arrhythmia is an abnormal heart rhythm. Some examples 
include heart block, flutter, and fibrillation. 
 
✓ Congenital heart disease refers to abnormalities in the heart at birth, 
resulting from some failure in the development of the fetus. Coarctation 
of the aorta is a narrowing of the aorta. Surgical treatment consists of 
removal of the constricted area with end-to-end anastomosis or joining 
together of the aortic segments.

204
Part IV: Let’s Get Some Physiology Terminology 
 
✓ Congestive heart failure is a condition where the heart is unable to 
pump its required amount of blood . Blood accumulates in the lungs 
and liver. In severe cases, fluid can collect in the abdomen and legs or in 
the pulmonary air sacs (known as pulmonary edema). Congestive heart 
failure often develops gradually over the years and can be treated with 
drugs to strengthen the heart and diuretics to promote loss of fluid.
 
✓ Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a disease of arteries supplying blood 
to the heart. This is usually the result of atherosclerosis, the deposition 
of fatty compounds on the inner lining of the coronary arteries.
 
✓ Heart murmur refers to an extra heart sound heard between normal 
heart sounds. Murmurs are heard with the aid of a stethoscope and are 
caused by a valvular defect or disease, which disrupts the smooth flow 
of blood in the heart.
 
✓ Hypertensive heart disease is high blood pressure affecting the heart.
 
✓ Mitral valve prolapse is improper closure of the mitral valve when the 
heart is pumping blood. 
 
✓ Raynaud’s phenomenon is short episodes of discoloration and numb-
ness in fingers and toes due to temporary constriction of arterioles. 
These may be triggered by cold temperature, stress, or smoking.
 
✓ Rheumatic heart disease is heart disease caused by rheumatic fever. 
 
✓ Varicose veins are abnormally swollen veins usually occurring in the 
legs, due to damaged valves that fail to prevent the backflow of blood. 
The blood then collects in the veins, causing distention. 
The blood itself can suffer from specific diseases and pathological condi-
tions. Consider the diseases specific to both the red and white blood cells. 
Anemia, a common symptom, is a deficiency in erythrocytes or hemoglobin, 
can take several forms, including the following:
 
✓ Aplastic anemia: Failure of blood cell production due to absence of 
development and formation of bone marrow cells
 
✓ Hemolytic anemia: Reduction in red cells due to excessive destruction
 
✓ Pernicious anemia: Lack of mature erythrocytes due to inability to 
absorb vitamin B12
 
✓ Sickle-cell anemia: Hereditary condition in which distorted cells clump 
and block blood vessels
Other issues affecting the blood include thalassemia, an inherited defect in 
the ability to produce hemoglobin; polycythemia vera, a malignant condition 
associated with increased red blood cells: and hemochromatosis, excessive 
deposits of iron through the body. Thalassemia is usually found in patients of 
Mediterranean background.

205
 Chapter 16: The Heart of the Matter: The Cardiovascular and Lymphatic Systems
The white blood cells often make people think of the “Big C,” also known as 
cancer. This is for good reason, as the white cells have a lot to do with a very 
serious disease called leukemia. Leukemia, of course, is the kingpin of white 
blood cell pathology. It is, in simple terms, an excessive increase in white 
blood cells — a cancerous disease of the bone marrow with malignant leuko-
cytes filling the marrow and bloodstream. Four forms of leukemia include:
 
✓ Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL): Seen most often in children and 
adolescents
 
✓ Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML): Derived from or originating in 
bone marrow 
 
✓ Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL): Occurs late in life and follows a 
slow, progressive course
 
✓ Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML): Slowly progressive
All types of leukemia are treated with chemotherapy, using drugs that pre-
vent cell division and selectively injure rapidly dividing cells. Effective treat-
ment can lead to remission, or disappearance of signs of the disease. Relapse 
occurs when leukemia cells reappear in the blood and bone marrow, neces-
sitating further treatment. Watch out for leukemia’s nasty cousin, multiple 
myeloma. This is a malignant tumor of bone marrow in which malignant cells 
invade bone marrow and destroy bony structures.
 
Keep these two blood-clotting health issues in mind
 
✓ Hemophilia is excessive bleeding caused by a congenital lack of coagu-
lation factor necessary for blood clotting.
 
✓ Purpura is a symptom caused by low platelets involving multiple pin-
point hemorrhages and accumulation of blood under the skin.
We couldn’t leave our good friends in the lymphatic system out of the pathol-
ogy discussion. Who knew that such small things like lymph nodes could be 
so prone to disease? 
The lymph nodes themselves are the sites of many a showdown between 
good health and an extended hospital stay. Hodgkin’s disease is a malig-
nant tumor arising in lymphatic tissue such as lymph nodes and spleen. 
Lymphosarcoma (lymphoma) is a malignant tumor of lymph nodes that 
resembles Hodgkin’s disease. Often referred to as non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, 
it affects lymph nodes, spleen, bone marrow, and other organs. Burkitt’s lym-
phoma is a malignant tumor of lymph nodes usually affecting children and 
most common in central Africa.

206
Part IV: Let’s Get Some Physiology Terminology 
Inflammation is another common trait of lymphatic system pathology. 
Sometimes those pesky lymph nodes just get too big for their britches in dis-
eases like the following:
 
✓ Lymphadenitis: Inflammation of lymph nodes usually due to infection
 
✓ Mononucleosis: Acute infectious disease with enlarged lymph nodes 
and spleen due to increased numbers of lymphocytes and monocytes
 
✓ Sarcoidosis: Inflammatory disease in which small nodules form in lymph 
nodes and other organs
Testing, Testing: Cardiovascular 
and Lymphatic Radiology and 
Diagnostic Tests
Confirming the diagnosis of a condition or disease is a full-time job. Think 
about the insurance claim notices you receive every time you get blood work 
or a urine sample done. There is a lab test to diagnose practically anything 
that might ail you. 
Lab tests for issues affecting the heart include serum enzyme test or studies, 
more commonly known as cardiac enzymes. During a myocardial infarction 
(heart attack), enzymes are released into the bloodstream from the dying 
heart muscle. These enzymes can be measured and are useful as evidence of 
an infarction. Lipid tests measure the amount of these substances in a blood 
sample. High levels of triglycerides and cholesterol can be associated with a 
greater risk of coronary atherosclerosis. 
HIV and AIDS
Perhaps the most serious diseases affecting 
the cardiovascular and lymphatic systems are 
HIV and AIDS.
HIV is also known as human immunodeficiency 
virus, the agent attacking the immune system 
and causing AIDS.
AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) 
is a disease marked by a decrease in immune 
response in which the patient has severe 
depletion of helper T-cell lymphocytes. This 
could cause the patient to acquire unusual life-
threatening infections and may develop tumors 
such as Kaposi’s sarcoma, a skin and lymphoid 
cancer, or lymphoma.

207
 Chapter 16: The Heart of the Matter: The Cardiovascular and Lymphatic Systems
The blood test is the most common of all diagnostic tests. Blood work can 
help present a plethora of problems that not only affect blood but also major 
systems and organs. Another gold standard test is the cardiac catheterization, 
which involves inserting a long, thin tube, or catheter, into a blood vessel in 
the arm, neck, or groin that is then threaded to the heart to perform diagnos-
tic testing such as pressure and patterns of blood flow.
Lipoprotein electrophoresis is a process in which lipoproteins (fat and protein 
molecules bound together) are physically separated from a blood sample. 
High levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) are associated with cholesterol 
and triglyceride deposits in arteries. High levels of high-density lipoprotein 
(HDL), containing less lipids, are found in someone with less evidence of 
atherosclerosis. 
 
Remember HDL is the “happy” cholesterol in the blood. So, just remember H 
for “happy.” LDL is the “bad” cholesterol. Remember L for “lousy.”
Other laboratory blood tests include the following:
 
✓ Antiglobulin test (Coombs’ test) determines whether erythrocytes are 
coated with antibody and useful in determining the presence of antibod-
ies in infants of Rh-negative mothers. (Rh-negative is a blood type in 
which all Rh factors are lacking.)
 
✓ Bleeding time is measurement of the time it takes for a small puncture 
wound to stop bleeding; normal time is 8 minutes or less.
 
✓ Coagulation time is the time required for blood to clot in a test tube; 
normal time is less than 15 minutes.
 
✓ ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) measures the speed at which 
erythrocytes settle out of plasma. The rate is altered in disease condi-
tions such as infection, joint inflammation, and tumor.
 
✓ Hemoglobin test is the measurement of the amount of hemoglobin in a 
blood sample.
 
✓ Platelet count is the number of platelets per cubic millimeter of blood. 
Platelets normally average between 200,000–500,000 per cubic millimeter.
 
 A common diagnostic test counts the red blood cells and/or the white 
blood cells. To remember the normal range for each, remember RBC 
(really big count) for RBC (red blood cells). The normal number is about 
5 million per cubic millimeter. The WBC (white blood cell count) is much 
smaller, averaging between 5,000–10,000 per cubic millimeter.
 
✓ Prothrombin time (PT) is the ability of the blood to clot, used to follow 
patients taking blood thinners or anticoagulant drugs such as Coumadin.
 
✓ White blood cell differential count determines the number of different 
types of leukocytes, mature and immature, that are present in a blood 
sample.

Paging Dr. Terminology: Cardiovascular 
and Lymphatic Surgeries and Procedures
So, what do you do about all of these conditions and diseases? Thankfully, 
there are almost as many possible surgeries and procedures as there are con-
ditions and diseases. The clinical procedures for the cardiovascular system 
are many, so hunker down. The great majority of these directly involve the 
old ticker. 
Electrocardiography is a record of the electricity flowing through the heart. 
Speaking of electricity, cardioversion or defibrillation is a treatment procedure 
whereby short discharges of electricity are applied across the chest to stop 
cardiac arrhythmia.
Angiocardiography is a procedure involving injection of contrast dye into 
the bloodstream followed by chest x-ray to determine the dimensions of the 
heart and large vessels. This is often used to diagnose an enlarged heart. 
Similarly, digital subtraction angiography can be used to get a closer look at 
the vessels. Video equipment and computer are used to produce x-rays of the 
blood vessels. 
Other procedures focus on finding out more about how efficiently the heart 
is working. In cardiac catheterization, a catheter is introduced into a vein 
or artery and guided into the heart for purposes of detecting pressure and 
patterns of blood flow. The cardiac scan is when a radioactive substance is 
injected intravenously and its accumulation in the heart muscle is measured 
with a scanner.
Abbreviations: Keep it short and simple
You probably won’t believe us, but saying 
all these terms over and over again can get 
tedious. Thankfully for those of you who must 
utter blood-related phrases on a daily basis, 
there are some handy-dandy abbreviations.
 ✓ BP: Blood pressure
 ✓ CBC: Complete blood count
 ✓ DVT: Deep vein thrombosis
 ✓ Hct: Hematocrit
 ✓ Hgb or Hb: Hemoglobin
 ✓ PT: Prothombin time
 ✓ RBC: Red blood cell count (erythrocytes)
 ✓ WBC: White blood cell count (leukocytes)

209
 Chapter 16: The Heart of the Matter: The Cardiovascular and Lymphatic Systems
The presence of areas of ischemia (deficiency of blood in a body part due 
to constriction or complete obstruction of a blood vessel) and myocardial 
infarction can be demonstrated on this scan. Everyone’s favorite, the stress 
test, determines the body’s response to physical exertion or stress. An 
echocardiogram and other measurements of blood pressure and breathing 
rate are taken while the patient is exercising usually jogging on a treadmill. 
Other fun and exciting procedures include the following
 
✓ Doppler flow study uses ultrasound waves to determine the velocity of 
flow of blood within vessels.
 
✓ Laser angioplasty uses light amplification to stimulate emission of radia-
tion or a laser beam to blocked arteries, especially in the legs.
 
✓ Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) is when a bal-
loon catheter is passed through a blood vessel to the area where plaque 
has formed. Inflation of the balloon flattens the plaque against the vessel 
wall and allows blood to circulate more freely. Also called a balloon 
angioplasty.
 
✓ Venogram: X-ray film of the veins taken after the injection of dye.
There certainly aren’t as many clinical procedures for the lymphatic system, 
but they are equally important. 
Zen and the art of ticker maintenance
Sometimes surgeons have to get down and 
dirty to fix a heart condition. This typically 
involves major surgery, a Skilsaw, and lots 
of time. Though it may be hard to believe that 
these surgeries are standard issue, remember 
that heart surgeons perform them every day 
with great success. 
Angioplasty is the surgical repair of a vessel. An 
endarterectomy is an excision within an artery 
of a thickened interior, usually named for the 
artery that is being “cleaned out.” More vein 
work includes phlebotomy, an incision into a 
vein to remove or give blood. This is also called 
venipuncture.
The big fun happens when surgeons get more 
involved with the heart. In cardiac pacemaker 
insertion, a battery-powered or nuclear-pow-
ered apparatus is implanted under the skin to 
regulate the heart rate.
Think bypasses are only for major cities with 
traffic issues? Not so. The coronary artery 
bypass graft (CABG) is a surgical technique to 
bring a new blood supply to heart muscles by 
detouring around blocked arteries, whereas 
a femoropopliteal bypass is surgery to estab-
lish an alternate route from the femoral artery 
to the popliteal artery in the leg, to bypass 
obstruction.

A bone marrow biopsy is just as serious as it sounds. A needle is introduced 
into the bone marrow cavity, and a small amount of marrow is aspirated 
(removed from the body) and examined under microscope. This procedure is 
helpful in the diagnosis of blood disorders such as anemia and leukemia.
Also in the category of “beyond serious” is the bone marrow transplant. Bone 
marrow cells from a donor, whose tissue and blood cells match those of the 
recipient, are infused into a patient with leukemia or aplastic anemia. The 
patient is first given aggressive chemotherapy to kill all diseased cells and 
then the donor’s marrow is intravenously infused into the patient to repopu-
late the marrow with normal cells.
Taking a closer look at the lymphatic system’s working parts involves the lymph-
angiogram, when dye is injected into lymph vessels in the foot and an x-ray is 
taken to show the path of lymph flow as it moves into the chest region. Lymph-
adenography is an x-ray of the lymph nodes and glands, after the injection of dye.

Your friendly neighborhood pharmacist will know all the details of what to 
use for cardio and lymph-related ailments. In the meantime, you have us. 
This section lists the most common types of drugs used to correct cardiovas-
cular and lymphatic conditions and diseases. 
Antiarrhythmics correct cardiac arrhythmias (irregular heartbeat). Examples 
include digoxin (Lanoxin) and propranolol hydrochloride (Inderal).
Anticoagulants slow blood clotting. Examples include heparin calcium 
(Calcilean) and warfarin sodium (Coumadin).
Antihypertensives prevent or control high blood pressure. Examples 
include nadolol (Corgard), furosemide (Lasix), and diltiazem hydrochloride 
(Cardizem, Cardizem CD).
Beta blockers treat hypertension, angina, and other abnormal heart rhythms. 
Metoprolol tartrate (Lopressor) and carteolol hydrochloride (Ocupress, 
Cartrol) are popular examples.
Calcium channel blockers treat hypertension, angina, and various abnormal 
heart rhythms. Typical ones are nicardipine hydrochloride (Cardene) and 
bepridil hydrochloride (Vascor).
Lipid-lowering agents reduce blood lipid (fat) levels, such as niacin (Nicobid), 
lovastatin (Mevacor), and atorvastatin (Lipitor).

A
s you go about your day, you probably don’t think to yourself, “Breathe 
in, now, breathe out,” over and over. Perhaps the only time you are con-
scious of what your respiratory system does is when it is working overtime — 
during your workout or at the top of stairs you just climbed. 
Because the cycle of breathing is continuous and constant, it’s easy to take it 
for granted sometimes. Breathing is something we don’t give much thought to 
as it looks after itself automatically. The body’s trillions of cells need oxygen 
and need to get rid of carbon monoxide, and this exchange of gases is accom-
plished by the respiratory system.
How the Respiratory System Works 
Air contains about 21 percent oxygen that is inhaled through the nose, finds its 
way to the lungs, into the lungs’ air spaces, and passes into tiny capillary blood 
vessels surrounding the air spaces. At the same time, carbon dioxide — the gas 
produced when oxygen and food combine in cells — passes from the capillary 
blood vessels into the air spaces of the lungs to be exhaled. Exhaled air contains
about 16 percent oxygen.

212
Part IV: Let’s Get Some Physiology Terminology 
External respiration occurs between the outside environment and the capil-
lary blood stream of the lungs, whereas another method of respiration is 
happening between the body cells and capillary blood vessels that surround 
them. This process is called internal or cellular respiration. Internal respira-
tion is the exchange of gases not in the lungs, but in cells of all body organs. 
Oxygen passes out of the bloodstream and into the tissue cells. At the same 
time, carbon dioxide passes from the tissue cells into the bloodstream and is 
carried by the blood back to the lungs to be exhaled. 
 
Capnia comes from the Greek kapnos, meaning “smoke.” The word now refers 
to carbon dioxide.
 
The normal adult cycle of inhaling and exhaling, including a short rest 
between, takes place about 16–18 times per minute. This is known as the 
respiratory rate.

 Chapter 17: Just Breathe: The Respiratory System
Nose
When we inhale, or inspire, air enters the body through the nose via the 
external nasal nares (nostrils) and passes through the nasal cavity. This 
cavity is lined with a mucous membrane and fine hairs called cilia that filter 
out foreign bodies (such as dust and pollen) and warm and moisten the air. 
The paranasal sinuses are hollow, air spaces in the skull that join up with the 
nasal cavity. Paranasal sinuses have a mucous membrane lining and secrete 
mucus. They make the bones of the skull lighter and help in the production 
of sound (which is why you sound different when your sinuses are clogged). 
They connect with the nasal cavity and are named for the bones they are 
located in: the frontal, ethmoid, sphenoid, and maxillary.
 
The singular form of nostrils, or nares, is naris.
Pharynx and larynx
After passing through the nasal cavity, air reaches the pharynx (the throat), 
which is made up of three parts. The nasopharynx is nearest the nasal cavity 
and contains the adenoids, which are masses of lymphatic tissue, which, in 
children, if enlarged, can obstruct the airway passage. Below the nasophar-
ynx, closer to the mouth, is the oropharynx, where the tonsils, two rounded 
masses of lymphatic tissue, are located. The third part of the pharynx is the 
hypopharynx, where the pharynx serves as a common passageway for food 
from the mouth and air from the nose. This area is divided into two branches, 
the larynx (voice box) and the esophagus (passage to stomach). The larynx 
leads downward to the trachea, where the air goes down to the lungs. The 
vocal cords have a slit between them called the glottis. Sound is produced 
as air moves out of the lungs, through the glottis, causing vibration. As food 
enters from the mouth and air enters from the nose, they both come together 
in the pharynx. 
 
Adenoid comes from the Greek aden, meaning “gland,” and cidos, meaning 
“like.” The term was once used for the prostate gland. The first adenoid sur-
gery took place in 1868.
 
What stops food from going into the trachea and respiratory system after 
it’s swallowed? The epiglottis is a flap of cartilage attached to the roof of the 
tongue that acts like a lid over the larynx. When swallowing food, the epiglot-
tis closes off the larynx so that food can’t enter.

214
Part IV: Let’s Get Some Physiology Terminology 
Trachea
On its way to the lungs, air passes from the larynx to the trachea (windpipe), 
a tube 4 1 ⁄2 inches long and about 1 inch in diameter. The trachea is kept 
open by 16–20 rings of cartilage that stiffen the front and sides of the tube. 
Some of these rings make up the thyroid cartilage forming the projection 
called the Adam’s apple.
 
The Adam’s apple is the largest cartilage ring in the larynx. The name is 
thought to come from the story that Adam sinned when he ate the forbidden 
fruit and was unable to swallow the apple stuck in his throat.
Bronchi
The trachea divides into two branches called the bronchi. Each bronchus (the 
singular form of bronchi) goes to a separate lung and subdivides into smaller 
and finer tubes, like the branches of a tree. The smallest of the bronchial 
branches are called bronchioles. At the end of the bronchioles are clusters of 
air sacs called alveoli. Each alveolus (singular of alveoli) is made up of a layer 
of epithelium. This very thin wall permits exchange of gases between the 
alveolus and capillaries that surround and come in close contact with it. The 
blood that flows through the capillaries takes the oxygen from the alveolus 
and leaves behind carbon dioxide to be exhaled. The oxygenated blood then 
carries the oxygen to all parts of the body.
 
Bronchi comes from Greek brecho, meaning “to pour” or “wet.” The ancient 
Greeks believed that the esophagus carried solid food to stomach and the 
bronchi carried liquids (which it doesn’t, and not to the stomach, for sure).
Lungs
Each lung is covered by a membrane called the pleura. The outer layer nearest 
to the ribs is parietal pleura. The inner layer closest to the lungs is the visceral 
pleura. The pleura is moistened with a watery fluid that assists in the move-
ment of the lungs in the chest cavity. The two lungs are in the thoracic or chest 
cavity. The right lung is slightly larger than the left, divided into three lobes. 
The left lung has two lobes. To remember how many lobes each lung has, 
remember that the heart resides on the left side of the chest, thus taking up 
more room and hence leaving room for only two lobes.
 
One lobe of a lung can be surgically removed without damaging remaining 
lobes, which continue to function.

215
 Chapter 17: Just Breathe: The Respiratory System
The lungs extend from the collarbone to the diaphragm in the chest cavity. 
The diaphragm is the muscular partition that separates the chest/thoracic 
cavity from the abdominal cavity. This muscle aids in the process of breath-
ing. The diaphragm contracts and descends with each inhalation. The down-
ward movement of the muscle enlarges the thoracic cavity area, allowing air 
to flow into the lungs to equalize pressure. When the lungs are full, the dia-
phragm relaxes and elevates, making the thoracic cavity smaller, increasing 
the air pressure in the thorax. Air is then expelled out of the lungs to equalize 
the pressure. This is called exhalation or expiration. 
 
Atelectasis, from the Greek ateles, means “not perfect.” Ektasis, “expansion,” is 
an incomplete expansion of the lung, in particular at birth. Incomplete expan-
sion can also occur after surgery when the patient avoids or cannot take deep 
breaths. This can cause the lungs to remain uninflated long enough for the air 
sacs to collapse into each other and create dead spaces in the lungs.
Figure 17-2 shows how inhalation and exhalation work.

You just got to know about all of the individual parts of the respiratory 
system. Each one is equally important. The nose without the pharynx or the 
lungs without the bronchi would be nothing more than spare parts, like on 
an old junker in a garage. Similarly, the parts of medical terms must coexist 
and work together to help us understand their meanings. Prefixes, suffixes,

It’s All Related: More Anatomical Terms
But that’s not all! We still have all sorts of great respiratory words for you to 
consider. For example, respirology is the study of respiratory diseases and 
respiratory system, and a respirologist is a physician specializing in disorders 
and treatment of respiratory systems.
Getting in and around your body are two gases with which you should be 
familiar: oxygen and carbon dioxide. Good old oxygen is the gas that passes 
into the bloodstream in the lungs and travels to all body cells. Conversely, 
carbon dioxide (CO2) is the gas produced by cells that is exhaled through 
the lungs. Internal respiration is the exchange of gases at the tissue cells. 
Sometimes, however, these gases are missing. Acapnia is the absence or less 
than normal level of carbon dioxide in blood, whereas anoxia is the absence 
of oxygen in the blood. Some other respiratory-related health issues include
 
✓ Aphonia: Absence of voice
 
✓ Apnea: Absence of breathing
 
✓ Bronchospasm: Sporadic contraction of the bronchi
 
✓ Dysphonia: Difficulty in speaking
 
✓ Dypsnea: Difficulty breathing
 
✓ Eupnea: Normal breathing

219
 Chapter 17: Just Breathe: The Respiratory System
 
✓ Hemoptysis: Coughing up blood from the lung
 
✓ Hyperventilation: Ventilation of lungs beyond normal body needs
 
✓ Hypoxemia: Deficient oxygen content in blood
 
✓ Hypoxia: Deficient oxygen to body tissue
 
✓ Mucoid: Resembling mucus
 
✓ Mucous: Pertaining to mucus
 
✓ Mucus: Secretion (slime) from the mucous membranes
 
✓ Orthopnea: Able to breathe only in upright or sitting position
 
✓ Nasopharyngeal: Referring to the nose and throat
 
✓ Rhinorrhea: Discharge from the nose
Next we have some terms specifically related to descriptions of respiratory 
body parts and functions. Get to know the following individual components 
of the system a bit better:
 
✓ Adenoids: A collection of lymph tissue in the nasopharynx
 
✓ Alveolus: An air sac in the lung
 
✓ Apex: Upper portion of the lung
 
✓ Apical: Pertaining to the apex
 
✓ Base: The lower portion of the lung
 
✓ Bronchus: The branch of the trachea that acts as the passageway into 
the air spaces of the lung
 
✓ Bronchioles: Smallest branches of the bronchi
 
✓ Bronchodilator: Agent causing the bronchi to widen or open up
 
✓ Cilia: Tiny hairs in the mucous membranes lining the respiratory tract
 
✓ Hilum: Middle portion of lung where bronchi, blood vessels, and nerves 
enter and exit the lungs
 
✓ Lobes: Divisions of the lungs. The right lung has three lobes and the left 
has two
 
✓ Mediastinum: Region between lungs in the chest cavity containing heart, 
aorta, esophagus, and bronchial tubes
Now for the potpourri, the mishmash, and everything but the kitchen sink.

Common Respiratory Conditions
Of all the most common respiratory conditions, the bronchial tubes get the 
big daddy: asthma. Asthma is attacks of paroxysmal dyspnea (wheezing and 
difficulty breathing) with airway inflammation and wheezing due to contrac-
tion of the bronchi, leading to airway obstruction if severe enough. The con-
dition affects millions of people of all ages.
 
Asthma comes from the Greek astma, meaning “to pant.”
The lungs have all sorts of wild and wacky conditions associated with them. 
Atelectasis, for example, is the imperfect expansion of air sacs of the lungs. 
Emphysema is the distention of the alveoli with swelling and inflammation of
lung tissue. Often seen in heavy smokers, this condition is marked by loss 
of elasticity of the lungs. Pneumonia is the acute inflammation and infection 
of the alveoli. A couple of different varieties exist: Lobar pneumonia involves 
distribution of infection in one or more lobes of a lung, whereas pneumocystis 
carinii pneumonia (PCP) is an infectious agent caused by P. carinii. It is fungal 
in origin and is common in AIDS patients.

221
 Chapter 17: Just Breathe: The Respiratory System
Pneumonia can be distributed in different ways, for example confining itself 
to only one lobe, as is often the case with a viral infection, versus presenting 
a “cotton-wool” appearance on X-ray, with scattered white spots throughout 
the lungs, as with PCP. It can be caused by many different infectious agents 
such as viruses, bacteria, and what are known as atypical agents, such as 
Mycoplasma, a common cause of pneumonia in teenagers and young adults.
 
Before 1980, PCP was rare. Sixty to eighty percent of AIDS patients develop PCP.
When we breathe, we don’t just breathe in air. Sometimes foreign particles 
sneak in, like crashers at your respiratory party. Dust is the most common 
culprit. Pneumoconiosis is an abnormal condition of dust in the lungs. 
Differing types of pneumoconiosis include the following:
 
✓ Anthracosis: Coal dust (black lung disease)
 
✓ Asbestosis: Asbestos particles in lungs
 
✓ Silicosis: Silica dust or glass (grinder’s disease)
Speaking of foreign matter hanging out in the lungs, the pleura (that mem-
brane that covers the lungs) can also be affected by foreign matter, namely 
fluid. Pleurisy is an inflammation of the pleura. Pleural effusion is the escape 
of fluid into the pleural cavity. Examples of a pleural effusion include empy-
ema (that pus in the pleural cavity you read about earlier) and Hemothorax, 
which is blood in the pleural cavity typically caused by a trauma, is not quite 
as common but obviously a serious problem — just ask anyone who works 
in the ER. Other greatest hits of pleural effusion include lung malignancy and 
congestive heart failure, due to the increased pressure of blood backing up in 
the pulmonary vessels.
But wait! There’s more fluid and pus! It can be a pusapalooza in those lungs, 
and can often develop into very serious conditions, like these three:
 
✓ Pulmonary abscess: Localized area of pus formation in the lungs
 
✓ Pulmonary edema: Swelling and fluid in the air sacs and bronchioles, 
caused by poor blood supply to the heart muscle
 
✓ Pulmonary embolism: Floating clot or other material blocking the blood 
vessels of the lung
If you thought that was all that could possibly affect your breathing, think 
again. Because there is such a great chance that foreign particles, dust, or 
communicable disease (from the common cold to more serious conditions), 
the lungs and its buddies are susceptible to a wide range of conditions. Here 
are some more examples:

222

✓ Adenoiditis: Inflammation of the adenoids
 
✓ Atelectasis: Incomplete expansion of the lungs
 
✓ Bronchiectasis: Dilatation of the bronchi
 
✓ Bronchitis: Inflammation of the bronchi
 
✓ Laryngitis: Inflammation of the larynx
 
✓ Laryngotracheobronchitis: Croup
 
✓ Pneumothorax: Air between the lung and chest wall
 
✓ Pulmonary neoplasm: A new growth in the lung, which can be malignant 
or benign depending on the composition
 
✓ Rhinitis: Inflammation of mucous membranes of nose
 
✓ Tonsillitis: Inflammation of the tonsils
 
✓ Tracheitis: Inflammation of the trachea
Finding the Culprit: Respiratory 
Diseases and Pathology
Now for the really serious, land-you-in-the-hospital sort of stuff: diseases 
and pathological disorders. One of the most frightening respiratory diseases 
is tuberculosis, also known as TB. Because of its communicable nature, this 
infectious disease, which is caused by acid-fast bacilli spread by inhalation of 
infected droplets, always causes a commotion when reported to health offi-
cials. So much so, in fact, that before antibiotics hospitals built solely for the 
treatment of TB were quite common. TB is a bit more under control today 
and is treated with a specific antibiotic regime, usually over a long-term 
(6-month) period. There are still many cases reported, though, particularly in 
the Global South.
Diphtheria is another infectious disease of the upper respiratory tract, affect-
ing the throat. Influenza, that pesky flu, is a highly infectious respiratory 
disease that is viral in origin. Though for most people nowadays it involves 
some time off work and chicken soup, the flu can be deadly if not treated, or 
in high-risk groups like small children and the elderly. Legionnaires’ disease is 
a form of lobar pneumonia caused by the bacterium Legionella pneumophilia.
 
Legionnaires’ disease gained notoriety after a highly publicized epidemic of it 
occurred at the American Legion convention in 1976.

223
 Chapter 17: Just Breathe: The Respiratory System
Tired yet? Hang in there. There are a few more respiratory diseases you 
should know. Here’s the lowdown:
 
✓ Adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is respiratory failure in an 
adult as a result of disease or injury.
 
✓ Bronchogenic carcinoma is a cancerous tumor arising from the bron-
chus. This tumor can metastasize (spread) to brain, liver, and other 
organs.
 
✓ Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) refers to any persis-
tent lung disease that obstructs the bronchial airflow. Examples include 
asthma, chronic bronchitis, and emphysema.
 
✓ Cor pulmonale is a serious cardiac disease associated with chronic lung 
disorders such as emphysema.
 
✓ OSA, or obstructive sleep apnea, occurs when the pharyngeal collapses 
during sleep leading to absence of breathing.
 
✓ Pulmonary edema means fluid accumulation in the alveoli and bronchioles.
 
✓ Pulmonary embolism is a blood clot, fat clot, or air carried in blood cir-
culation to pulmonary artery where it blocks the artery.
 
✓ URI is upper respiratory tract infection of pharynx, larynx, and trachea. 
LRI (lower respiratory infection) usually refers to an infection of every-
thing that’s left — bronchi and lungs. It’s hard to have a LRI without the 
URI, but you can have the URI by itself.
Watch those kiddos
Some diseases present in infancy or develop 
more predominantly in children. One that is 
commonly associated with children is pertus-
sis, more commonly known as whooping cough. 
This is a contagious bacterial infection of the 
upper respiratory tract (the pharynx, larynx, and 
trachea). Croup (laryngotracheobronchitis) is 
another respiratory disease affecting children. 
It is an acute respiratory syndrome in children 
and infants marked by an obstruction of the 
larynx, hoarseness, and cough.
On a whole other level are those diseases that 
can be inherited. Cystic fibrosis is one to watch. 
This is an inherited disease of infants and chil-
dren in which there is excess mucus production 
in the respiratory tract. It is a dysfunction of the 
exocrine glands with chronic (longstanding) 
lung disease due to excessive mucus secretion 
in the respiratory tract, pancreatic deficiency, 
and sometimes liver cirrhosis. It is a multitude 
of dysfunctions, but the mucus production is the 
main problem.
If you are pregnant, consult with your OB about 
prescreening for cystic fibrosis to determine if 
you or your partner is a carrier for the disease.

Testing, Testing: Respiratory Radiology 
and Diagnostic tests
Now that you have all of these conditions and disease terms floating around 
in your head, you’re probably wondering what, if anything, can be done 
about them? Thanks to the wonders of modern technology, there are all sorts 
of ways physicians and other medical professionals can diagnose what ails 
those airways. 
To start, physicians rely on their senses to look and listen to what your 
lungs and associated respiratory parts are doing. Every time, for example, 
the doctor listens to your heart and lungs with a stethoscope, she is perform-
ing auscultation, which simply means . . . listening to sounds within the body 
using a stethoscope. This simple method allows doctors and nurses to hear 
the sounds of the lungs, pleura, heart, and abdomen. Another listening tech-
nique is percussion, in which the physician makes short, sharp blows (taps) 
to the surface of the body with a finger or instrument to determine density 
from sounds of the underlying tissue. A laryngoscopy occurs when the larynx 
is visualized with a laryngoscope. A bronchoscopy is the examination of the 
bronchus by passing a flexible fiberoptic tube (endoscope) into the bron-
chus. A tracheostomy is cutting an opening into the trachea through the neck 
and inserting a tube to facilitate passage of air or removal of secretions.
 
IPPA stands for inspection, palpation, percussion, and auscultation. These are 
all part of a normal physical examination either in hospital or in physician’s 
office.
Diagnostic tests are part of the respiratory physician’s problem-solving bag 
of tricks. Some are more invasive than others, whereas some simply involve 
more looking and listening with the aid of medical equipment. Some of the 
most used tests are the following:
 
✓ Bronchial washing: Specimens can be obtained for bacterial studies 
and cytologic or cell studies, by aspiration of bronchial secretions or by 
injecting fluid and retrieving it. 
 
✓ Endotracheal intubation is when a tube is placed through the mouth, 
into the trachea, to establish an airway.
 
✓ Lung biopsy: Lung tissue is obtained by forceps or brush (bronchial 
brushing). Can also be accomplished through a catheter inserted under 
X-ray guidance. 
 
✓ Lung scan: Radioactive material is injected or inhaled and images are 
recorded of its distribution into lung tissue.

225
 Chapter 17: Just Breathe: The Respiratory System
 
✓ Pulmonary function tests evaluate ventilation capacity of the lung. A 
spirometer measures the air taken in and out of the lungs.
 
✓ Thoracentesis: Chest wall is punctured with a needle to obtain fluid 
from the pleural cavity for diagnostic studies or to relieve pressure in 
the lung. 
 
✓ Tuberculin test is when an antigen is applied to the skin by multiple 
punctures or tines test, or intradermally by the Mantoux test. An inflam-
matory reaction is observed in 48–96 hours in an infected patient.
One very useful way to view what is going on in the respiratory system is to 
use X-ray and endoscopic procedures to take a closer look. Two major types of 
X-ray are used for this system: A bronchogram is an X-ray of the bronchi, and a 
chest X-ray is used to evaluate the lungs and heart. Another widely used diag-
nostic method is the bronchoscopy, a visual examination of the bronchus using 
a bronchoscope. A chest CT is also called computerized axial tomography (CAT 
scan). This is when physicians and radiologists use computerized images of 
the chest cavity to diagnose tumors, abscesses, and pleural effusion.
Paging Dr. Terminology: Respiratory 
Surgeries and Procedures
Now you’ve got the tools to identify and diagnose conditions and diseases of 
the respiratory system, get your instruments and scrub in, because it’s time 
to operate. 
Most of the terms regarding surgeries and procedures revolve around the 
actual incisions, excisions, and repairs used to treat a myriad of conditions 
and diseases. As such, these terms are fairly straightforward. You’ll see a lot 
of -otomy and -plasty suffixes here, denoting the type of procedure. 
Start at the top, with repairs made to the nose. Rhinoplasty (your standard 
beak job) is a surgical repair of the nose, while septoplasty is the surgical 
repair of the nasal septum.
Moving down to the throat region, you have the adenoidectomy, an excision 
of adenoids. Similarly, the tonsillectomy is an excision of the neighboring ton-
sils, as well as a sure method of obtaining ice cream.
Two terms relate directly to the larynx. Laryngectomy is the excision of 
larynx, while laryngoplasty is the surgical repair of the larynx. Moving on to 
the trachea, we have the tracheotomy, often popularized in television and 

226
Part IV: Let’s Get Some Physiology Terminology 
movies using some non-medical character who must perform one with a 
bottle of vodka and a Swiss Army knife or ball point pen. But let’s leave it to 
the professionals, shall we? This procedure involves an incision into the tra-
chea. A tracheoplasty is a surgical repair of the trachea. 
The lungs and chest cavity are next. Here are some of the most common sur-
geries and procedures pertaining to that area of the respiratory system:
 
✓ Lobectomy: Excision of a lobe of a lung
 
✓ Pleurocentesis: Surgical puncture to aspirate fluid from pleural space
 
✓ Pneumonectomy: Excision of a lung
 
✓ Thoracocentesis: Surgical puncture to aspirate fluid from the chest cavity
 
✓ Thoracotomy: Incision into the chest cavity
Terminology RX: Respiratory 
Pharmacology
Several kinds of medicines are used to treat the respiratory system. Many 
are used for other systems as well, but they are worth repeating so you will 
know what is safe to use with direct relation to the lungs. Bronchodilators 
are used to treat asthma, COPD, and exercise-induced bronchospasm. They 
relax muscles around the bronchi, increasing air flow. They are usually given 
orally, intravenously, or by nebulizer or aerochamber (inhaler) administered 
in puffs. Corticosteroids are used to control inflammatory responses. Diuretics 
(water pills) are used to treat pulmonary edema.
When you are feeling the effects of a cold or bronchial infection, you prob-
ably take one of these next four drug types: Decongestants help reduce 
swelling in mucous membranes of the nose, to relieve stuffiness and allow 
secretions to drain. Antihistamines help dry up secretions. They are effec-
tive in treating allergic reactions, but not effective on the common cold. 
Antitussives decrease coughing by suppressing the cough center in the brain. 
Expectorants reduce the thickness of sputum so it can be coughed up more 
easily. If over-the-counter meds just won’t cut it, a prescription may be in 
order. Antibiotics are used to treat respiratory infections, tuberculosis, and 
pneumonias. Silver nitrate can be used to cauterize superficial blood vessels 
that cause nosebleeds.

T
hat big steak dinner leaves you feeling like you need elastic pants for a 
reason. Your gastrointestinal (sometimes abbreviated GI) system has to 
work hard to make all that meat and potatoes into a useful substance that 
your body can use as energy, and it can only hold so much at one time.
Imagine the local swimming pool at the height of summer. Only so many kids can 
jump in, because otherwise the water overflows and makes a big mess. It’s the 
same with the gastrointestinal system. If you put too many things in, something’s 
bound to overflow. So, take small bites and try to digest everything there is to 
know about that full feeling you have after dinner. Elastic pants are optional.
The gastrointestinal system, also called the alimentary or digestive tract, pro-
vides a tube-like passage through a maze of organs and body cavities, begin-
ning at the mouth, the food entrance into the body, and ending at the anus, 
where solid waste material exits the body.
This system and its organs perform three primary functions:
 
✓ Carrying food for digestion
 
✓ Preparing it for absorption
 
✓ Transporting waste products for elimination
How the Gastrointestinal System Works 
Digestion begins with our help. Food is put in the mouth. It has to be broken 
down and digested both mechanically and chemically, as it makes its way 

228
Part IV: Let’s Get Some Physiology Terminology 
through the gastrointestinal tract. Digestive enzymes help speed up the 
chemical reaction and assist in the breakdown or digestion of complex nutri-
ents from the food.
During the digestive process, proteins break down to amino acids, compli-
cated sugars reduce to simple sugars, such as glucose, and large fat mol-
ecules are broken down into fatty acids and triglycerides.
Absorption takes place when the digested food is absorbed into the blood-
stream, by going through the walls of the small intestine. By this process, 
nutrients like sugar and amino acids travel to all cells in the body. Fatty acids 
and triglycerides are also absorbed through the wall of the small intestine, 
but enter lymphatic vessels rather than blood vessels. 
The third stage is elimination of solid waste materials that cannot be 
absorbed into the bloodstream. This solid waste, called feces, collects in the 
large bowel and finally exits the body you know where.
You can follow the merry route taken through the various passages and organs 
that make up the digestive system. Figure 18-1 shows the organs involved.

 Chapter 18: Feeding Time: The Gastrointestinal System
Mouth and pharynx
The digestive tract begins with the oral cavity or the mouth. The lips provide 
the opening and the cheeks form the walls. The hard palate is the roof of the 
mouth, and the muscular soft palate lies behind it, horizontally separating 
the mouth from the nasopharynx, or posterior nasal cavity. Then everything 
blends in together. The mouth, or oropharynx, shades subtly into the hypo-
pharynx, or the back of the mouth/top of the throat, and then the pharynx 
proper, or upper throat, which then becomes the esophagus. And that con-
cludes our discovery tour of the pharynx.
Hanging from the soft palate is a tiny piece of soft tissue called the uvula, 
which means “little grape.” The tongue extends from the floor of the mouth 
and is attached by muscles to the lower jawbone. It moves food around 
during chewing (mastication) and swallowing (deglutition). The tongue is cov-
ered with tiny projections called papillae, which contain taste buds that are 
sensitive to the chemical nature of foods. 
The teeth are important because, during the chewing process, they break 
down food into smaller pieces to make the swallowing process easier. 
Around the oral cavity are three pairs of salivary glands. These glands pro-
duce saliva, which contains digestive enzymes. Saliva is released from the 
parotid gland, the submandibular gland, and the sublingual gland, on each side 
of the mouth. Narrow salivary ducts carry the saliva into the oral cavity. 
Food passes from the mouth to the pharynx (throat), a muscular tube lined 
with mucous membrane. It acts as the passageway for air from the nasal 
cavity to the larynx (voice box) but also as a food passageway going from the 
mouth to the esophagus. A flap of tissue called the epiglottis covers the open-
ing to the larynx and prevents food from going into the trachea (windpipe) 
when swallowing occurs. 
Esophagus
The esophagus is a 9–10-inch muscular tube from the pharynx to the stomach. 
It aides in swallowing and propelling the food toward the stomach. Peristalsis 
is the involuntary process of wave-like contractions in the esophagus that 
helps the food reach its next destination. This process actually takes place 
throughout the entire gastrointestinal tract, helping to propel food through 
the system. 

230
Part IV: Let’s Get Some Physiology Terminology 
Stomach
Food passes from the esophagus into the stomach. The stomach is made up 
of the fundus (top portion), body (middle portion), and antrum (lower por-
tion). The lining of the stomach consists of folds called rugae, which allow the 
stomach to stretch when food enters. The openings into and from the stom-
ach are controlled by rings of muscles called sphincters. The esophageal (or 
cardiac) sphincter relaxes and contracts moving food from the esophagus into 
the stomach, and the pyloric sphincter allows food to leave the stomach when 
it has been sufficiently broken down. 
The function of the stomach is to prepare food chemically to be received 
in the small intestine for further digestion and absorption into the blood-
stream. Food is churned and mixed with gastric juices to make a semiliquid 
called chyme. Food does not enter the bloodstream through the walls of the 
stomach. The stomach controls passage of food into the first part of the 
small intestine, so it proceeds only when it is chemically ready and in small 
amounts. 
Liver
The liver, gallbladder, and pancreas are accessory organs of the digestive 
system. Food doesn’t pass through these organs, but each plays a role in the 
proper digestion and absorption of nutrients.
The liver produces greenish fluid called bile that contains cholesterol, a fat 
substance, bile acids, and several bile pigments. Bile is continuously released 
from the liver and travels down the hepatic duct to the cystic duct. The cystic 
duct leads to the gallbladder, which stores and concentrates the bile for later 
use. After meals, the gallbladder contracts, forcing bile into the common bile 
duct joining with the pancreatic duct, just before the entrance of the duode-
num. The duodenum receives a mixture of bile and pancreatic juices. 
Pancreas
The pancreas produces juices filled with enzymes, amylase and lipase, to 
digest food. These pass into the duodenum through the pancreatic duct. An 
endocrine gland (see Chapter 19), the pancreas also secretes insulin. This 
hormone is needed to help regulate levels of glucose in the blood.

231
 Chapter 18: Feeding Time: The Gastrointestinal System
 
The pancreas is so named because of its fleshy appearance. Greek pan means 
“all,” and krea means “flesh.” 
Gallbladder
The gallbladder is a sac-like structure 3–4 inches long tucked under the right 
lobe of the liver. It is part of the biliary tract (hepatic, cystic, and common bile 
ducts). It stores bile until needed in the duodenum to aid digestion.
 
You can live without a gallbladder. If inflamed or containing stones (a calci-
fied pebble formed in the gallbladder), it is surgically removed. Bile can find 
another home in the biliary ducts, allowing the biliary process to function. 
Intestines  
The small intestine, or small bowel, extends from the pyloric sphincter to the 
first part of the large intestine. It is 21 feet long, 1 inch in diameter, and has 
three parts. The duodenum, a foot in length, receives the chyme from the 
stomach, as well as bile from the liver and gallbladder and pancreatic juices 
from the pancreas. 
 
Duodenum is from the Latin duodeni meaning “twelve each,” referring to its 
length.
Enzymes and bile help digest food before it passes into the second part of the 
small intestine, the jejunum. The jejunum is about 8 feet long and connects 
to the third portion, the ileum, which is 11 feet long. Most of the absorption 
process takes place in the ileum. In the wall of the small intestine are millions 
of tiny microscopic villi, finger-like projections. Through tiny capillaries in 
the villi, digested nutrients pass through to enter the bloodstream and lymph 
vessels. At the lower end of the ileum is the ileocecal valve, the joining point 
of the small intestine to the large intestine.
 
Here’s a quick look at two parts of the intestine. Jejunum (Latin jejunas) 
means “empty” and is so named because it was always found empty. 
Ileum (Greek cilein) means “to roll.” This is a reference to the peristaltic 
waves that move food.

232
Part IV: Let’s Get Some Physiology Terminology 
The large intestine, or large bowel, extends from the end of the ileum to the 
anus. It is made up of four parts: the cecum, colon, sigmoid colon, and rectum. 
It is five feet long and about 2 1 ⁄2 inches in diameter. The cecum is a pouch 
that is connected to the ileum by the ileocecal valve.
The appendix hangs from the cecum. The appendix has no known function, 
which is why it’s not a huge loss to your body if it must be removed. The 
colon has three divisions: the ascending, transverse, and descending colon. 
The sigmoid colon is S-shaped, at the end of the descending colon that leads 
into the rectum. The rectum terminates at the lower opening of the gastroin-
testinal tract at the anus. The entire large intestine receives fluid waste prod-
ucts of digestion that cannot be absorbed into the bloodstream and stores it 
until it is released from the body. 
Gastrointestinal Root Words
A lot of players work together in the gastrointestinal tract. The good news, 
with regard to word building, is that the list of prefixes and suffixes is a lot 
less complicated than those of other large systems. The prefixes and suffixes 
listed in Table 18-1 will help you keep all of the body parts, ailments, and pro-
cedures straight.

Common Gastrointestinal Conditions
Because the gastrointestinal system is made of many parts, it shouldn’t be a 
surprise that it can be prone to all sorts of ailments and maladies. Mouth con-
ditions are some of the most obvious to the naked eye. Thankfully, two types 
of professionals can help find solutions to maladies of the mouth that affect 
mastication (chewing). Ask any parent about your friendly, neighborhood

orthodontist — she or he specializes in the correction of deformed, crooked, 
or maloccluded (crooked or misaligned) teeth. The periodontist specializes in 
diseases of the tissue around the teeth. Don’t forget the good old dentist, who 
takes care of dental issues; and the oral and maxillofacial surgeons who deal 
with dental and facial surgery to repair things like cleft palates and dental 
trauma.
Now, take a closer look at some of the conditions these specialists treat:
 
✓ Aphthous stomatitis: Canker sores in mouth
 
✓ Bruxism: Grinding teeth involuntarily, often while sleeping
 
✓ Cleft palate: Congenital split in the roof of the mouth or upper lip 
 
✓ Dental caries: Cavities in the teeth (caries means “decay”)
 
✓ Dysphasia: Difficulty speaking
 
✓ Edentulous: Without teeth
 
✓ Gingivitis: Inflammation of gums
 
✓ Halitosis: Bad breath
 
✓ Herpes simplex: Cold sore or fever blister on lip or nose due to herpes 
virus
 
✓ Leukoplakia: White plaques or patches of mouth mucosa
 
✓ Sublingual: Under the tongue
 
Your baby teeth are also called the primary teeth. Your first teeth (20 in all) 
include 8 incisors, 4 cuspids, and 8 molars. Your permanent teeth number 32, 
with 8 incisors, 8 premolars, and 12 molars.
The esophagus is the next stop on your tour of gastrointestinal conditions. 
Many of the following conditions result in discomfort both in swallowing 
(deglutition) and in the digestion process:
 
✓ Aphagia: Inability to swallow
 
✓ Dysphagia: Difficulty swallowing
 
✓ Esophageal varices: Just like varicose veins in the legs; boggy veins with 
inefficient valves that allow venous backflow, resulting in stagnant blood 
in bulging veins
 
✓ Esophagitis: Inflammation of the esophagus
 
✓ Heartburn: Burning sensation caused by reflux or flowing back of acid 
from the stomach into esophagus

To keep dysphasia and dysphagia straight, remember the s in dysphasia for 
“speak,” and the g in dysphagia for “gag.”
Moving south, you find the stomach, an area full of possibility when it comes 
to conditions. Gastroenterology is the study of the stomach and intestines, 
and a gastroenterologist is the physician who treats conditions of stomach 
and intestine.
Many of the conditions that eventually affect the esophagus or intestine start 
in the stomach. So, have your antacids ready for these:
 
✓ Dyspepsia: Difficult digestion
 
✓ Eructation: Act of belching or raising gas from stomach
 
✓ Gastric ulcer: Lesion on wall of stomach. Also known as peptic ulcer
 
✓ Gastritis: Inflammation of the stomach
 
✓ Gastrodynia: Pain in the stomach
 
✓ Hematemesis: Vomiting of blood
 
✓ Hiatal hernia: Protrusion of part of the stomach through the esophageal 
opening into diaphragm
 
✓ Hyperemesis: Excessive vomiting
 
✓ Nasogastric: Pertaining to nose and stomach
 
✓ Nausea: Urge to vomit
 
✓ Regurgitation: Return of solids and fluids to mouth from stomach
 
✓ Ulcer: Sore or lesion of mucous membrane or skin
 
✓ Vomit: Also known as emesis; stomach contents expelled through mouth
The liver, pancreas, and gallbladder all experience their own specific conditions, 
the most common of which is good, old-fashioned, often-painful gallstones.
 
✓ Calculus (plural is calculi): Stones
 
✓ Cholelithiasis: Condition of having gallstones
 
✓ Duodenal ulcer: Ulcer in the duodenum
 
✓ Gallstones: Hard collections of bile that form in gallbladder and bile 
ducts
 
✓ Hepatomegaly: Enlargement of liver
 
✓ Hepatoma: Tumor of liver

All the twists and turns of both the large and small intestines can make for 
some interesting and often complicated conditions. The sheer length of these 
organs makes diagnosis and treatment a long and winding road. Start the 
journey with these intestinal conditions:
 
✓ Ascites: Abnormal accumulation of fluid in peritoneal cavity caused by 
cirrhosis, tumors, and infection
 
✓ Borborygmus: Rumbling, gurgling sound made by move of gas in intestine
 
✓ Cathartic: Strong laxative
 
✓ Colonic polyposis: Polyps, small growths protrude from mucous mem-
brane of colon
 
✓ Constipation: Difficult or delayed defecation caused by low peristalsis 
movement, over-absorption of water as contents sit too long in the intes-
tine, or by dehydration
 
✓ Diarrhea: Frequent discharge of liquid stool (feces)
 
✓ Diverticula: Abnormal side pockets in hollow structure, such as intes-
tine, sigmoid colon, and duodenum
 
✓ Flatus: Gas expelled through the anus
 
✓ Hemorrhoids: Swollen or twisted veins either outside or just inside the 
anus
 
✓ Hernia: A protrusion of an organ or part through the wall of the cavity 
that contains it
 
✓ Ileus: Intestinal obstruction that can be caused by failure of peristalsis 
following surgery, hernia, tumor, adhesions, and often by peritonitis
 
✓ Inguinal hernia: A small loop of bowel protruding through a weak place 
in the inguinal ring, an opening in the lower abdominal wall, which 
allows blood vessels to pass into the scrotum
 
✓ Intussusception: Telescoping of the intestine; common in children
 
✓ Laxative: Medication encouraging movement of feces
 
✓ Melena: Black stool; feces containing blood
 
✓ Polyposis: Condition of polyps in the intestinal wall
 
✓ Pruritus ani: Intense itching of the anal area
 
✓ Steatorrhea: Excessive fat in feces
 
✓ Volvulus: Twisting of intestine upon itself

Finding the Culprit: Gastrointestinal 
Diseases and Pathology
The gastrointestinal system can also play host to even more pathological 
diseases. Many of these involve inflammation of the various system compo-
nents, which can cause major disruption to the work the system performs, as 
well as major discomfort. Here’s a look at inflammation-related diseases:
 
✓ Cholecystitis: Inflammation of the gallbladder
 
✓ Crohn’s disease: Inflammation and ulceration of the intestinal tract of 
terminal or end portion of ileum
 
✓ Diverticulitis: Inflammation of diverticula
 
✓ Enteritis: Inflammation of the intestine
 
✓ Gastroenteritis: Inflammation of stomach and intestine
 
✓ Hepatitis A: Acute inflammation of the liver, spread by fecal-oral 
contact. 
 
✓ Hepatitis B: Inflammation of the liver due to a virus transmitted by 
blood and body fluids
 
✓ Hepatitis C: Virus affecting the liver spread through blood and body 
fluids. Like other forms of hepatitis, this can cause jaundice, a yellowish 
discoloration of the skin
Deadly eating habits
Sadly, some diseases are the result of more 
serious mental and psychotic disorders, and 
they can be deadly. If you or someone you know 
shows any signs of these disorders, please seek 
medical help immediately. No amount of weight 
loss is worth losing one’s life. Here are the most 
serious disorders of this type:
 ✓ Anorexia: Psychiatric condition involving 
self-deprivation of food, lack of appetite, 
and pathological weight loss
 ✓ Anorexia nervosa: Psychiatric disorder; an 
abnormal fear of becoming obese
 ✓ Bulimia: Gorging with food and then purging, 
most commonly by inducing vomiting or use 
of intense exercise or laxatives/diuretics
 ✓ Cachexia: Generalized poor nutrition (adjec-
tive: cachectic)

239
 Chapter 18: Feeding Time: The Gastrointestinal System
 
✓ Hepatitis: Inflammation of the liver caused by virus or damage to the 
liver
 
✓ Pancreatitis: Inflammation of pancreas
 
✓ Periodontal disease: Inflammation and degeneration of gums, teeth, and 
surrounding bone
 
✓ Ulcerative colitis: Chronic inflammation of colon with ulcers
As you can see, inflammation is a huge issue with the gastrointestinal system. 
Here are some other common diseases that can put a halt to this system’s 
daily functions: 
 
✓ Anal fistula: This is an abnormal tube-like passageway near the anus 
communicating with rectum.
 
✓ Celiac disease: Also known as malabsorption syndrome, this disease is 
thought to be precipitated by gluten-containing foods. The hair-like pro-
jections (villi) degenerate (or actually flatten) so they lose their absorp-
tion function. The disease can be hereditary and is common in people 
of Irish origin. Those with the disease must follow a gluten-free diet to 
control abdominal pain and diarrhea. Also known as gluten enteropathy 
or nontropical sprue.
 
✓ Cirrhosis is a scarring of the liver parenchyma, or tissue, due to damage 
from alcohol, drugs, and viruses like hepatitis.
 
✓ GERD means gastroesophageal reflux disease. It refers to the backward 
flow of gastrointestinal contents into the esophagus.
 
✓ IBS: Irritable bowel syndrome is a group of symptoms including diarrhea, 
abdominal bloating, cramping, and constipation associated with stress 
and tension (also known as spastic colon).
Testing, Testing: Gastrointestinal 
Radiology and Diagnostic Tests
Now that you know what can possibly be wrong with your gastrointestinal 
system, it’s time to find out how medical professionals go about confirming 
their suspicions. There are three primary ways physicians diagnose diges-
tive diseases and conditions: X-rays, ultrasounds, and blood tests. Check out 
these exciting X-ray methods:

240
Part IV: Let’s Get Some Physiology Terminology 
 
✓ Abdominal ultrasound: Most common method to determine the pres-
ence of stones in gallbladder, can detect liver cysts, abscesses, gall-
stones, enlarged pancreas
 
✓ Barium enema (lower GI series): Series of X-rays taken of large intestine 
after barium enema injected
 
✓ Cholangiogram: X-ray film of bile duct, contrast medium is injected to 
outline the ducts
 
✓ Cholecystogram: X-ray of the gallbladder
 
✓ Upper GI series: Series of X-rays taken of stomach and duodenum after 
barium swallow or meal has been taken
Now, don’t get squeamish, but it’s time to draw blood. That little pinprick 
you feel when a needle is inserted into skin to draw blood is a small price to 
pay for all that your doctor can discover just by looking at the results of your 
blood tests. The blood can tell a million stories about what is going on inside 
the giant factory that is the body. A wide variety of blood tests can be done 
to diagnose gastrointestinal conditions and diseases, all of which look for 
varying levels of enzymes, proteins, and other blood elements. Some of the 
most common ones are as follows:
 
✓ Alkaline phosphatase: Elevated results indicate liver disease
 
✓ Amylase: Pancreatic enzyme levels elevated in disease of pancreas
 
✓ Bilirubin levels: Present in liver and gallbladder disease
 
✓ CBC (Complete blood count): Measures types and levels of white blood 
cells (indicators of infection), red blood cells (measures of anemia), and 
platelets, or clotting factors
 
✓ CMP (Complete metabolic profile): Damaged organs release certain 
enzymes from their damaged tissue, and these elevated enzyme levels 
show up in the blood; nonfunctioning organ cannot clean waste prod-
ucts out of the blood the way they’re supposed to, and elevated levels 
of these products also show up in the blood; CMP in particular looks at 
electrolytes, liver function, and kidney function
 
✓ Helicobacter pylori antibody test: Blood test to determine presence of 
H. pylori organisms, a bacteria that can be found in stomach lining, caus-
ing duodenal ulcer
 
✓ Occult blood test: Test to detect occult (hidden) blood in feces; also 
called Hema-Check and Colo-Rec
 
✓ Protein: Elevated in liver disease

241
 Chapter 18: Feeding Time: The Gastrointestinal System
Some diagnostic procedures are a bit more invasive, such as an abdomi-
nocentesis (also called paracentesis), a surgical puncture to remove fluid from 
abdominal cavity. Most of the other invasive procedures involve the use of 
an endoscope, an instrument used to visually examine internal organs and 
body parts. Almost every part of the digestive system can be viewed with 
the endoscope. The fiberoptic (all one word) endoscope has glass fibers in a 
flexible tube that allows light to be transmitted back to the examiner. The 
endoscope can be inserted into a body opening (mouth or anus) or through a 
small skin incision to view internal organs.
Some endoscopic procedures include the following: 
 
✓ Colonoscopy: Visual examination of the colon using an instrument 
called a colonoscope
  
✓ EGD (esophagogastroduodenoscopy): Visual examination of esophagus, 
stomach, and duodenum
 
✓ ERCP: Also known as an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatogra-
phy, this involves an X-ray of bile and pancreatic ducts using contrast 
medium (like dye) and endoscopy
 
✓ Gastroscopy: Visual examination of the stomach using an instrument 
called a gastroscope
 
✓ Laparoscopy: Visual examination of any internal organ or cavity using 
an instrument called a laparoscope
 
✓ Proctoscopy: Visual examination of the rectum using an instrument 
called a proctoscope
 
✓ Sigmoidoscopy: Visual examination of the sigmoid colon using an instru-
ment called a sigmoidoscope

Surgeries and Procedures
Luckily, many parts of the gastrointestinal system can be repaired using sur-
gical methods such as surgical excision, repair, and suturing. You will likely 
be familiar with many of these terms, such as appendectomy, but some will be 
brand-spanking new to you. Let’s start by taking a look at surgical excisions, 
or removals. Here are some of the most common:

242
Part IV: Let’s Get Some Physiology Terminology 
 
✓ Abdominoperineal resection: Surgical excision of colon and rectum, by 
both abdominal and perineal approach
 
✓ Appendectomy: Surgical excision of appendix
 
✓ Cholecystectomy: Surgical excision of gallbladder
 
✓ Colectomy: Surgical excision of the colon or part of the colon
 
✓ Gastrectomy: Surgical excision of stomach
 
✓ Polypectomy: Surgical excision of a polyp
 
✓ Uvulectomy: Surgical excision of uvula
Surgical repairs are next on the to-do list of procedures and surgeries. 
Gastrointestinal surgical repairs include
 
✓ Anoplasty: Surgical repair of anus
 
✓ Anastomosis: Surgical connection between two normally distinct structures
 
✓ Choledocholithotomy: Incision into common bile duct to remove stone
 
✓ Laparotomy: Surgical incision into abdomen
 
✓ Palatoplasty: Surgical repair of palate
 
✓ Pyloroplasty: Surgical repair of pylorus
 
✓ UPPP (uvulopalatopharyngoplasty): Surgical repair of uvula, palate, and 
pharynx to correct obstructive sleep apnea
 
✓ Vagotomy: Cutting of certain branches of vagus nerve performed during 
gastric surgery to reduce amount of gastric acid
Finally, surgeons use suturing and the creation of artificial openings to help 
treat conditions of the gastrointestinal tract. These are some of the most 
common:
 
✓ Colostomy: Artificial opening into the colon through abdominal wall
 
✓ Gastrojejunostomy: Artificial opening between stomach and jejunum
 
✓ Gastrostomy: Artificial opening into stomach through abdominal wall; 
this is a feeding method used when swallowing is not possible
 
✓ Herniorrhaphy: Suture of a hernia to repair
 
✓ Ileostomy: Creation of artificial opening into ileum through abdominal 
wall for passage of feces (used for Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, or 
cancer)
 
✓ Jejunostomy: Creation of artificial opening in the jejunum

Remember reading that you might need your antacids to get through this 
chapter? Well, we weren’t kidding. Antacids are one of the most common 
and useful over-the-counter remedies for what ails your digestive tract. And 
most of them provide an added boost of calcium as well. However, keep in 
mind that over-the-counter (OTC) antacids also have high sodium content, 
so check with your doctor before using them if you are on a low-sodium diet. 
Antacids with simethicone also relieve excess flatulence, if you need to avoid 
any embarrassing outbursts in public.
Another great OTC remedy is the laxative. This medication relieves constipa-
tion. Conversely, antidiarrheals relieve or stop diarrhea, and stool softeners 
allow fat and water in the stool to mix in order to soften hard stool. 
A doctor may prescribe medications that provide a little more kick, so to 
speak: 
 
✓ Activated charcoal: Used for its absorption powers; often used via naso-
gastric tube to assist with stomach pumping (drug overdose)
 
✓ Antibiotics: To treat Helicobacter pylori infections, diverticulosis, ulcer-
ative colitis, and Crohn’s exacerbations, and traveler’s diarrhea
 
✓ Anticholinergics: To treat spasms of the GI system such as IBD, diveric-
ulitis, and even ulcers; effectively slow down peristalsis with a calming 
effect
 
✓ Antiemetics: Control nausea and vomiting. Often prescribed when che-
motherapy or radiation is administered
 
✓ Bowel preparations and enemas: Bowel cleansers taken before barium 
enema or bowel surgery
 
✓ Emetics: Used to induce vomiting; especially useful in cases of drug 
overdose or ingested poisons
 
✓ H2 blockers: Used to treat gastric ulcers

H
ormones — a word that strikes fear in the heart of even the most manly 
of men. We’re talking the flannel-wearing, beer-drinking, dirt-under-
fingernails-even-at-a-wedding kind of guys who run for their lives at the first 
sign of domestic discord. But fear not, gentle men. It’s a frequent miscon-
ception that hormones only affect women, but hormones are an important 
part of every person’s physiology. They keep our systems running and send 
important signals to our major organs that dictate how they work.
Hormones don’t just magically appear. They get a little help from their friends, 
the glands, who are kind enough to produce them, nurture them, and then 
send the little guys on their way to the appropriate organs. 
How the Endocrine System Works 
The endocrine system maintains the chemical balance of the body. It does this 
by sending chemical messengers called hormones throughout the body via 
the bloodstream. Hormones regulate and control the activity of specific cells 
or organs. Slowly released hormones control organs from a distance.
Endocrine glands are located in different parts of the body. They are called 
ductless, because they have no duct system to transport their secretions. 
Instead, hormones are released directly into the bloodstream. They regulate 
a variety of the functions of body organs. One can stimulate growth, another 
matures sex organs, and yet another controls metabolism. 

246
Part IV: Let’s Get Some Physiology Terminology 
 
Endocrine: Take endo, which means “within” or “inner,” and add it to the Greek 
krinein, which means “to separate.”
Endocrine glands, no matter which hormone they produce, secrete directly 
into the bloodstream to the target organ needing that hormone. They are 
unlike exocrine glands — such as the sebaceous glands in the skin — that 
deliver secretions via ducts directly to the body organ needing them. The 
endocrine system has two types of endocrine glands: central and peripheral. 
The central glands, the pituitary gland and the hypothalamus, are located in 
the brain. The pituitary gland is referred to as the “master gland” because it 
produces a variety of hormones that travel via the bloodstream to regulate 
activities of other endocrine glands. The pituitary and hypothalamus glands 
work together to regulate body functions such as growth, salt and water bal-
ance, reproduction, and metabolism. 
Peripheral glands include the thyroid, parathyroids, adrenals, pineal, and the 
pancreas. The thyroid, parathyroids, adrenals, and pineal glands have only 
one function: they produce hormones. The pancreas not only produces hor-
mones but also performs important functions of the digestive system. The 
pancreas is similar to other mixed function organs, such as the heart, liver, 
kidneys, ovaries, and testes. In addition to their regular systemic functions, 
these organs also secrete hormones. 
 
Believe it or not, the heart secretes hormones — as if it doesn’t have enough 
to do already. The heart releases ANP, also known as A-type natriuretic peptide 
(or polypeptide), which helps to regulate renal and cardiovascular homeo-
stasis. This hormone is released from the heart atria, whereas BNP (B-type 
natriuretic peptide) is released from the ventricles. Both help to lower blood 
pressure.
Figure 19-1 illustrates the endocrine system.
Hormones
Before you get to know the endocrine glands better, take a second to say 
hello to their little friends, the hormones. These little messengers work like 
diplomatic peacekeepers, so to speak. They communicate with larger organs 
and systems to maintain chemical harmony and keep your body working. 
Because the individual parts of the endocrine system produce a variety of 
hormones, we discuss them in the context of their “home bases” — with each 
individual gland. Let’s look at each of these glands, where they’re located, 
their function, and what hormone they secrete.

Pituitary and hypothalamus
The pituitary gland — the grand master orchestra leader — is a pea-sized 
gland consisting of an anterior and posterior lobe, located at the base of the 
brain in a small depression of the skull called the sella turcica, just below the 
hypothalamus. The hypothalamus secretes trophic hormones that stimulate 
the pituitary gland to release other hormones. Together, these glands are 
known as central glands.

248
Part IV: Let’s Get Some Physiology Terminology 
The anterior pituitary secretes seven hormones, messaged by hypothalamus-
released hormones. Five of these are trophic (stimulating) hormones that 
induce other glands to release hormones:
 
✓ The growth hormone (hGH), also called somatotropin, stimulates 
growth in body cells. 
 
✓ The thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), also called thyrotrophin, stimu-
lates the thyroid gland to produce and secrete its own hormones, thyrox-
ine and triiodothyronine. 
 
✓ Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulates the adrenal cortex to 
produce and secrete cortisol and aldosterone.
 
✓ Follicular-stimulating hormone (FSH) in the female is responsible for 
the growth of the ovum (egg) in the ovaries and stimulates the secretion 
of estrogen and progesterone. In the male, FSH promotes sperm (sper-
matozoa) formation. This is also known as a gonadotropic hormone, one 
which influences the growth and hormone secretion of the ovaries in 
females and testes in males.
 
✓ The luteinizing hormone (LH) induces the secretion of progesterone 
and triggers ovulation. In the male, LH regulates testosterone secretion. 
This is also a gonadotropic hormone.
The remaining two hormones do not stimulate production of other hor-
mones, so they are not tropic hormones. Prolactin (PRL) is the hormone that 
promotes the growth of breast tissue and sustains milk production after 
childbirth. Melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) influences the formation of 
melanin and causes increased pigmentation in the skin. 
The posterior lobe of the pituitary gland stores and secretes two hormones. 
Antidiuretic hormone (ADH), also known as vasopressin, prevents excessive 
loss of water. Oxytocin stimulates uterine contractions in childbirth and 
maintains labor during childbirth. It also regulates the flow of milk from the 
mammary glands during breastfeeding.
The pineal gland: Endocrine groupie
The pineal gland is a bit of a mystery, a sort 
of hanger-on to the endocrine system. It is 
included in the endocrine system because it 
is ductless. However, little is known about its 
endocrine function. It is located near the base 
of the brain and secretes a substance called 
melatonin. This is believed to increase the 
activity of the reproduction system and regulate 
the sleep cycle. Calcification of the pineal gland 
can occur and is used as a radiological marker 
when X-rays of the brain are examined.

249
 Chapter 19: Gatekeepers of Health: The Endocrine System
Thyroid
The thyroid gland is composed of two pear-shaped lobes separated by a strip 
of tissue called the isthmus. It is located on either side of the trachea, just 
below a large piece of cartilage called the thyroid cartilage. This cartilage 
covers the larynx and is the prominence on the neck known as the Adam’s 
apple. The thyroid is made up of tiny sacs filled with a jelly-like fluid called 
colloid. The hormones secreted by the thyroid are stored in the colloid until 
passing into the bloodstream when required. 
 
The thyroid weighs only about one ounce. 
The two iodine-rich hormones secreted by the thyroid gland are thyroxine (T4) 
and triiodothyronine (T3). These hormones are synthesized in the thyroid from 
iodine, which is picked up from the blood circulating through the gland. T3 
and T4 are necessary to maintain a normal level of metabolism in the body. 
Thyroid hormone aids cells in the uptake of oxygen and supports the body’s 
basal metabolic rate (BMR). The BMR is the speed — or lack thereof — at which 
your body absorbs food, turns it into useful amino acids, fats, and sugars, uses 
these nutrients, and eliminates the waste. The BMR also refers to your overall 
energy level, temperature control, skin and hair condition, mood, energy level, 
and even the rate and effectiveness of your cognitive processes. Injections of 
thyroid hormone raise the metabolic rate, and removal of the gland diminishes 
the thyroid hormone content in the body. This results in a lower metabolic 
rate, heat loss, and poor physical and mental development. The gland also 
secretes calcitonin, which helps maintain the balance of calcium necessary for 
a variety of processes. 
The parathyroid glands are four small (about 1 ⁄2-inch) oval bodies that lie on the 
back aspect of the thyroid gland, two on each side. These glands secrete the 
parathyroid hormone (PTH). This hormone mobilizes calcium from bones into 
the bloodstream, where calcium is necessary for proper functioning of body 
tissue. The adjustment of normal calcium in the food we eat is absorbed from 
the intestines and carried via the bloodstream to bones for storage. 
 
The adjustment of levels of calcium in the blood is a good example of the way 
hormones control homeostasis, or equilibrium or consistency, of the body’s 
internal environment.
Pancreas
The pancreas is located behind the stomach and functions as part of the gas-
trointestinal system. (We also discuss this gland in Chapter 18.) Consider it 
a jack of all trades and, as such, a member of more than one body system. As 
an endocrine gland, the pancreas produces hormones — that is, in this case, 

250
Part IV: Let’s Get Some Physiology Terminology 
specialized cells in the pancreas produce hormones. The cells are called the 
islets of Langerhans and they secrete insulin and glucagon, both of which play 
roles in the proper metabolism of sugar and starch in the body. Insulin is nec-
essary in the bloodstream for the use and storage of blood sugar and acts to 
decrease blood sugar levels, whereas glucagon acts to increase them by instruct-
ing the liver to synthesize new glucose in a process called gluconeogenesis.
Adrenals
The adrenal glands are two small glands, one on top of each kidney. Each 
gland consists of two parts, an outer portion called the adrenal cortex and 
an inner portion called the adrenal medulla. The cortex and medulla are 
two glands in one, each secreting its own hormone. The cortex secretes 
hormones called steroids, which are complex chemicals derived from cho-
lesterol. The medulla secretes hormones called catecholamines, chemicals 
derived from amino acids. 
The adrenal cortex also secretes mineral corticoids, also known as miner-
alocorticoids. These hormones regulate the amount of mineral sodium and 
potassium in the body. The main corticoid, aldosterone, is responsible for 
electrolyte and water balance, affecting blood sodium concentration and 
potassium. Aldosterone secretion increases in a severe sodium-restricted 
diet, enabling the body to hold needed salts. Cortisol, also called hydrocorti-
sone, is a glucocorticoid hormone in that it increases the ability of cells to 
make new sugar out of fat. The adrenal cortex also secretes androgens that 
aid in the development of secondary male characteristics, such as growth of

Addison’s disease, a disease of the adrenal cortex, was named after Thomas

 Chapter 19: Gatekeepers of Health: The Endocrine System
The adrenal medulla secretes two hormones: epinephrine or adrenalin and 
norepinephrine-noradrenalin. Both hormones work in conjunction with the 
sympathetic nervous system. Under stress, these hormones are secreted by 
the adrenal medulla in response to nervous stimulation. They help the body 
respond to crisis situations by increasing the heart rate, blood pressure, 
blood glucose (sugar) level, and rate of blood clotting.
Gonads
The gonads (ovaries in the female, and testes in the male) are the gamete-
producing glands. A gamete is a sex cell. Hormones that stimulate the gonads 
are known as gonadotropins. 
Estrogen is secreted by the ovaries and is necessary in the development of 
secondary female sex characteristics (pubic hair and breast development, for 
example). It also regulates the menstrual cycle. 
Progesterone is released in the second half of a menstrual cycle by the corpus 
luteum (empty egg sac) in the ovary. Its function is to prepare the uterus for 
pregnancy. If fertilization doesn’t occur, secretion of progesterone stops, and 
the menstrual cycle follows. There are small levels of estrogen and progester-
one present in males as well.
Human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) is secreted by the placenta when a 
pregnancy occurs. This stimulates the ovary to keep producing estrogen and 
progesterone to maintain the pregnancy.
Testosterone is secreted in the testes. It stimulates the development of sec-
ondary male sex characteristics (pubic and facial hair, deepening of voice). 
The hormone is also present in women to some degree, and some believe it 
increases female libido.
Endocrine Root Words
The glands of the endocrine system all produce different hormones that help 
keep the systems of the body running like clockwork. If you consider these 
glands the gatekeepers of the hormones they produce and send, you can con-
sider prefixes and suffixes the gatekeepers of the root words. They both help 
tell you more about the meaning of the medical term. Table 19-1 shows some 
prefixes and suffixes associated with the endocrine system:

It’s All Related: More Endocrine 
Anatomical Terms
It is, without a doubt, incredibly vital that the components of the endocrine 
system work in harmony because the system is a fairly complex collection 
of glands that produce a variety of hormones. The specialty study of this 
system of glands is known as endocrinology, with the physician in charge 
known as an endocrinologist.
Here’s a closer look at even more aspects of this highly influential system. 
First, take a look at some hormone-related terms:
 
✓ Adrenalin/epinephrine: Adrenalin is a traditional trademark for the 
preparation of epinephrine (adrenaline) in the United States
 
✓ Antidiuretic hormone (ADH): Hormone secreted to stimulate water 
reabsorption
 
✓ Cortisol: Hormone secreted by adrenal cortex
 
✓ Epinephrine: Hormone produced by adrenal medulla
 
✓ Glucagon: Hormone produced by pancreas in islets of Langerhans that 
stimulates the release of sugar
 
✓ Growth hormones (GH and hGH): Secreted hormones stimulating the 
growth of long bones; also called somatotropin
 
✓ Hydrocortisone: Cortisol
 
✓ Insulin: Hormone secreted by islets of Langerhans; essential for the 
proper uptake and metabolism of sugar in cells
 
✓ Islets of Langerhans: Endocrine cells of the pancreas

254
Part IV: Let’s Get Some Physiology Terminology 
 
✓ Melatonin: Hormone secreted by pineal gland
 
✓ Oxytocin: Hormone secreted to stimulate uterus to contract during 
labor
 
✓ Renin: Hormone secreted by kidneys to raise blood pressure
 
✓ Somatotropin: Growth hormone
 
✓ Steroids: Complex substance derived from cholesterol of which many 
hormones are made
 
✓ Target tissue: Cells towards which the effects of the hormone are 
directed
 
✓ TSH: Hormone secretion that stimulates the thyroid gland to produce 
thyroxine (T3) and triiodothyronine (T4)
 
✓ Vasopressin: Antidiuretic hormone ADH
Next, take a look at some of the other substances associated with the endo-
crine system. Though not hormones, these are vital products of this system, 
and help keep the body functioning properly. 
 
✓ Calcium: Mineral substance necessary for proper functioning of body 
tissues and bones
 
✓ Electrolytes: Mineral salt found in blood and tissues; necessary for 
proper functioning of body cells; potassium, sodium, and calcium are 
examples of necessary electrolytes
 
✓ Glucose: Simple sugar
 
✓ Glycogen: Starch, a storage form of sugar
 
✓ Iodine: Chemical element composing a large part of thyroxine, produced 
by the thyroid gland
 
Protein comes from the Greek protos, meaning “first.”
Common Endocrine Conditions
Most conditions associated with the endocrine system present more than 
just a common nuisance or annoyance. These conditions can really mess 
with the everyday function of your body and its organs. Effects like extreme 
weight gain or weight loss, extreme height issues, and even renal (kidney) 
failure are not uncommon when it comes to endocrine conditions. 

255
 Chapter 19: Gatekeepers of Health: The Endocrine System
You will notice that many of these common conditions are results of either 
glandular underactivity or overactivity. Many are also a result of a more seri-
ous endocrine disease, such as diabetes, which we cover in the next section.
The following are a list of pathological conditions that pertain to the pituitary 
gland:
 
✓ Acromegaly: Enlargement of the extremities due to hyperfunctioning of 
the pituitary gland after puberty
 
✓ Dwarfism: Congenital hyposecretion of growth hormone
 
✓ Gigantism: Hyperfunctioning of the pituitary gland before puberty, 
resulting in abnormal overgrowth of the body
 
✓ Hypophysitis: Inflammation of pituitary body
 
✓ Panhypopituitarism: Generalized insufficiency of pituitary hormones
Moving on to the thyroid, which is not without its own special issues, many 
of the following conditions involve both size of the gland as well as its output:
 
✓ Cretinism: Extreme hypothyroidism during infancy and childhood
 
✓ Euthyroid: Condition of having a normal thyroid
 
✓ Exophthalmos: Abnormal protrusion of eyeballs
 
✓ Goiter or thyromegaly: Abnormal enlargement of thyroid 
 
✓ Hashimoto’s thyroiditis: A progressive autoimmune thyroiditis (lym-
phocytic invasion of the thyroid gland) with developing goiter; leads to 
hypothyroidism and sometimes precedes Graves’ disease; also called 
chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis
 
✓ Hyperparathyroidism: Excessive production of the parathyroid 
hormone
 
✓ Hyperthyroidism: Overactivity of the thyroid gland
 
✓ Hypoparathyroidism: Deficient production of parathyroid hormone
 
✓ Hypothyroidism: Underactivity of the thyroid gland
 
✓ Myxedema: Advanced hypothyroidism in adulthood 
 
✓ Thyroiditis: Inflammation of the thyroid gland
 
Exophthalmos comes from the Greek ex, meaning “outwards,” and ophthalmos, 
meaning “eye.” Protrusion of the eyeball can be a symptom of hyperthyroid-
ism, which was originally described by Robert James Graves, an Irish physi-
cian. Voilá! We have Graves’ disease.

Next is our old friend, the parathyroid, with an odd mix of conditions affect-
ing calcium and, of all things, your wrists. Take a look:
 
✓ Hypercalcemia: Abnormally high levels of calcium.
 
✓ Hypocalcemia: Abnormally low levels of calcium.
 
✓ Tetany: A neurological disorder resulting in spasms (contractions) of a 
muscle; usually marked by sharp flexion of wrists or ankle joints, most 
often affects extremities
The adrenals are next on the checklist of conditions. Remember that these 
glands have one primary function: to produce hormones. So, if these are out 
of whack, so is your entire body.
 
✓ Adrenal virilism: Excessive output of adrenal androgens
 
✓ Adrenopathy: Disease of the adrenals
Now it’s time to talk about the pancreas, that double-dipper gland that is 
involved in the inner workings of more than one system. In the case of the 
endocrine system, some common conditions can affect the performance of 
this gland of many talents. They are
 
✓ Acidosis: Abnormal condition characterized by reduced alkalinity of the 
blood and of the body tissues
 
✓ Hyperglycemia: Abnormally high sugar in the blood
 
✓ Hypoglycemia: Abnormally low sugar in the blood
 
✓ Pancreatitis: Inflammation of the pancreas
Conditions of the gonads can be troublesome and can cause some problem-
atic side effects, such as heavy or irregular periods and ovarian cysts for 
women and erectile dysfunction for men. Discussing these conditions, in par-
ticular, require a level of sensitivity. 
 
✓ Gynecomastia: Excessive breast development in a male
 
✓ Hypergonadism: Excessive secretion of hormones by sex glands
 
✓ Hypogonadism: Deficient secretion of hormones by sex glands
Now, it’s time for the potpourri of conditions. Many of these occur as a result 
of a more serious pathological disease, and some involve too much or too 
little of a specific substance in your body. It’s an endocrine grab bag!
 
✓ Diabetes insipidus: Insufficient secretion of the antidiuretic hormone 
vasopressin; causes the kidney tubules to fail to reabsorb needed water 
and salt
 
✓ Diabetic nephropathy: Destruction of kidneys, causing renal insuffi-
ciency requiring hemodialysis or renal transplantation

257
 Chapter 19: Gatekeepers of Health: The Endocrine System
 
✓ Homeostasis: Tendency in an organ to return to equilibrium or constant 
stable state
 
✓ Hyperkalemia: Excessive amounts of potassium in blood
 
✓ Hyponatremia: Deficient amount of sodium in the blood
 
✓ Hyperparathyroidism: A condition of excess parathyroid hormone 
secretion, whether from tumor, genetic condition, or medication
 
✓ Ketoacidosis: A primary complication of diabetes mellitus; fats are 
improperly burned leading to an accumulation of ketones in the body 
 
✓ Polyuria: Excessive urination
 
✓ Polydipsia: Excessive thirst
Finding the Culprit: Endocrine 
Diseases and Pathology
While, admittedly, no condition of the endocrine system is simple or without 
side effects, the diseases we talk about in this section have especially serious 
consequences. One of the most common of these diseases is diabetes, which 
affects millions of people of all ages. Not only does diabetes affect the func-
tion of the body, it greatly affects a person’s everyday habits. To manage the 
disease, one typically has to alter the diet and often take medications or insu-
lin injections. Basically, the patient must learn a whole new lifestyle. Read on 
to find out more about this and other serious endocrine diseases. 
The official name of diabetes is Diabetes mellitus, which means there is a lack 
of insulin secretion from the pancreas.
There are two major types of diabetes mellitus: 
 
✓ Type 1 diabetes is also known as insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 
(IDDM) or juvenile or child onset diabetes; it is often seen in children. 
It involves the destruction of the cells of the islets of Langerhans with 
complete deficiency of insulin in the body. Daily insulin injections are 
necessary.
 
✓ Type 2 diabetes is also called non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 
(NIDDM) or adult-onset diabetes; age and obesity is a common factor. 
The islets of Langerhans are not destroyed, and there is deficiency of 
insulin secretion which causes insulin resistance in the body. Treatment 
includes diet, weight reduction, exercises, and if necessary, insulin or 
oral hypoglycemic drugs.

258
Part IV: Let’s Get Some Physiology Terminology 
Some of the other serious pathological endocrine diseases affect the thyroid 
and the adrenal glands:
 
✓ Addison’s disease is hypofunctioning of the adrenal cortex. 
Glucocorticoids are produced in deficient amounts. Hypoglycemia, 
excretions of large amounts of water and salt, weakness, and weight loss 
are symptoms of this condition. Treatment consists of daily cortisone 
administration and intake of salts.
 
✓ Cushing’s disease involves hyperfunctioning of the adrenal cortex with 
increased glucocorticoid secretions. Hyperplasia of the adrenal cortex 
results from excessive stimulation of the gland by ACTH. Obesity, moon-
like fullness of the face, excessive deposition of fat on the back called 
“buffalo hump,” and high blood pressure are produced by excessive 
secretions of the adrenal steroid. 
 
✓ Thyroid carcinoma is cancer of the thyroid gland.
 
Cushing’s disease was named after Harvey Cushing, an American neurosurgeon.
 
President John F. Kennedy had Addison’s disease, as did Bev’s dog, Barney. 
JFK and Barney, together forever in the annals of endocrine history.
Testing, Testing: Endocrine Radiology 
and Diagnostic Tests
That was quite a list of conditions and diseases, no? It would seem that 
the endocrine system has more potential conditions than Vegas has slot 
machines. Good thing physicians can use some relatively straightforward 
tests to evaluate the way the endocrine glands function.
Blood serum tests only require that you to give a few vials of blood at your 
local lab office. The professionals do the rest from there, running tests that 
measure the following levels: calcium, cortisol, electrolytes, FSH, hGH, glu-
cose, insulin, parathyroid hormones, T3, T4, testosterone, and TSH. All of 
these can be evaluated with blood serum tests.
Sometimes all the lab needs is a clean urine sample, so be prepared to pee 
in a cup. Urine testing can measure the following substances in the urine as 
indicators of endocrine disease: calcium, catecholamines, free cortisol, elec-
trolytes, ketones, and glucose. 

259
 Chapter 19: Gatekeepers of Health: The Endocrine System
 
Glucose comes from the Greek gleukos, meaning “sweetness.”
Some other tests are a bit more complicated, such as the glucose tolerance 
test (GTT), which requires both a blood test and urine sample. This test 
measures the glucose levels in the blood and urine in specimens taken 30 
minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, and 3 hours after ingestion of 100 g of glucose. The 
blood test portion measures levels of glucose in the blood, and the urine test 
measures for ketones in the urine, which is a symptom of uncontrolled diabe-
tes. Other diagnostic tests for the endocrine system include the following:
 
✓ Estrogen receptor test: Determines whether hormonal treatment would 
be useful in cancer treatment by measuring the response of the cancer 
to estrogen
 
✓ Goetsch’s skin reaction: Test for hyperthyroidism involving reaction to 
epinephrine injection, named for Emil Goetsch (1883–1963)
 
✓ Radioactive iodine uptake: Thyroid function is evaluated
Some clinical procedures associated with the endocrine system include:
 
✓ CT scan: Also known as computerized tomography or CAT scan, Here 
transverse views of the pituitary gland and other endocrine organs can 
diagnose pathological conditions.
 
✓ Thyroid scan: In a thyroid scan, a radioactive compound is given and 
localized in the thyroid gland. The gland is then visualized with the scan-
ner to detect tumors or nodules.
 
✓ Ultrasound: Pictures obtained from ultrasound waves can identify pan-
creatic, adrenal, and thyroid masses. This procedure is also used to 
diagnose conditions and diseases of many other systems of the body.
Paging Dr. Terminology: Endocrine 
Surgeries and Procedures
The majority of the surgeries and procedures associated with the endocrine 
system involve either incision into or removal of a gland. It is important to 
note in this system that once an endocrine gland is surgically removed, usu-
ally for tumor or enlargement, hormone replacement is necessary. Whatever 
hormone is secreted by the removed gland must be artificially replaced in 
the body by drug administration.

260
Part IV: Let’s Get Some Physiology Terminology 
You should be able to discern what each of the following surgical terms 
means by looking at the root and the suffix, which either means to remove or 
to cut (as in an incision). Here’s the short list:
 
✓ Adrenalectomy: Removal of an adrenal gland
 
✓ Hypophysectomy: Removal of the pituitary gland
 
✓ Pancreatectomy: Removal of a portion of the pancreas
 
✓ Pancreatotomy: Incision into the pancreas
 
✓ Parathyroidectomy: Surgical removal of parathyroid glands
 
✓ Thyroidectomy: Surgical removal of the thyroid
Terminology RX: Endocrine 
Pharmacology
Now, let’s get to the good stuff — the drugs that can help treat conditions of 
the endocrine system. 
One of the big daddy diseases of the endocrine system is diabetes, which 
affects millions of Americans. Insulin is administered via injection or subcuta-
neous pump to treat diabetes mellitus type 1. There are several types of insu-
lin, including rapid acting, immediate acting, long acting, and even mixtures 
of more than one type. Oral antidiabetics (hypoglycemic drugs) are used to 
treat type 2 diabetes.
Thyroid diseases can seriously affect the body’s growth, either in a meta or 
micro sort of way. Sources of drugs and supplements used to treat thyroid 
disease include desiccated beef or pork thyroid gland. Some are also made of 
synthetics. Antithyroid drugs are used to treat hyperthyroidism. They work by 
mimicking the thyroid hormone and inhibiting the production of T3 and T4.
Finally, there are drugs used to treat the pituitary gland, most notably growth 
hormone therapy and hormone replacement therapy.

magine that your body is a giant building filled with all sorts of workers. 
Blood cells, hormones, and all sorts of worker bees run around all day (and 
night!) making the company work better. At the center of this building is a huge 
computer system, upon which all the workers great and small depend. The 
computer is a lot like your nervous system — it’s the hard-wiring that controls 
all of the little activities your body performs. From the voluntary (raising your 
eyebrows) to the involuntary (the way your eyes dilate), the nervous system 
helps keep it all humming along better than the newest Mac or PC.
How the Nervous System Works 
The nervous system is the body’s built-in computer system, but it is far, far 
more complex than any state-of-the-art computer. With the brain acting as 
the CPU (central processing unit), messages are relayed via the spinal cord 
through nerve fibers, providing connections for incoming and outgoing data. 
The body has more than 10 billion nerve cells whose function is to coordi-
nate its activities. We speak, hear, taste, see, think, move muscles, and our 
glands secrete hormones, all thanks to the nervous system. We respond to 
pain, danger, temperature, and touch as well, and we have memory, associa-
tion, and discrimination. These functions are only a small part of what the 
nervous system controls.

262
Par t IV: Let’s Get Some Physiology Terminology 
The nervous system is made up of three subsystems.
 
✓ The central nervous system (CNS) includes the brain and spinal cord.
 
✓ The peripheral nervous system (PNS) is composed of cranial nerves that 
extend from the brain and spinal nerves that extend from the spinal cord.
 
✓ The autonomic nervous system (ANS) is a division of the peripheral 
nervous and controls and coordinates the functions of the body’s vital 
organs, such as heartbeat and rate of breathing — functions we don’t 
even think about.
The worker bees of the nervous system are called neurons. A neuron is micro-
scopic, but a nerve is macroscopic, that is, it can be seen with the naked eye. 
A nerve consists of a bundle of dendrites and axons. Dendrites are the recep-
tive branching fibers of neurons. Axons carry impulses away from the cell 
body. The dendrites and axons travel together like strands of rope.
Figure 20-1 illustrates the nervous system.
The Central Nervous System
The central nervous system consists of the brain and spinal cord. The periph-
eral nervous system consists of 12 pairs of cranial nerves and 31 pairs of 
spinal nerves. The cranial nerves carry or transmit impulses between the 
brain, the head, and the neck. The spinal nerves relay messages between the 
spinal cord, the chest, abdomen, and the extremities. The functions of the 
spinal and cranial nerves are mainly voluntary, involving smell, taste, sight, 
hearing, and muscle movement. 
Brain
The brain is the central control center for regulating and coordinating body 
functions. It lies in the cranial cavity (within the skull). The spinal cord, 
continuous with the lower part of the brain, passes through the foramen 
magnum, an opening in the skull that allows the spinal cord to continue down 
through the vertebral column. 
 
Most brains weigh between 2.5–4 pounds (40–60 ounces). The size of the skull 
offers only a general idea of the brain size, because the shape and thickness of 
the skull varies.

The brain’s largest part is the cerebrum. Nervous tissue covering the cere-
brum is called the cerebral cortex. The cortex is arranged in folds called gyri 
and depressions or grooves known as fissures or sulci. 

264
Par t IV: Let’s Get Some Physiology Terminology 
 
Cerebral hemispheres are the paired right and left halves of the cerebrum that 
occupy most of the brain cavity. The left cerebral hemisphere controls the 
right side of the body, and the right hemisphere controls the left side.
Thought, memory, judgment, and association all take place in the cerebrum. 
Efferent cranial nerves carry motor impulses from the cerebrum to muscles 
and glands to produce movement and activity. The outer surface of the cere-
brum, the cerebral cortex, is made up of gray matter, and underneath this the 
white matter forms the central part of the brain. 
The cerebral cortex is the center that controls speech, vision, smell, move-
ment, hearing, and thought processes and has four lobes:
 
✓ The frontal lobe is the center for voluntary movement, judgment, rea-
soning, and impulse inhibition.
 
✓ The occipital lobe (the back of each of the hemispheres) manages visual 
perception, association, and visual memory.
 
✓ The parietal lobe collects, recognizes, and organizes sensations of pain, 
touch, movement, and position.
 
✓ The temporal lobe correlates auditory and visual memory as well as 
language development.
In the middle of the cerebrum are spaces called ventricles. These spaces 
contain watery fluid that flows through the brain and around the spinal cord, 
called the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). It protects the brain and spinal cord from 
shock, acting like a cushion. CSF can be withdrawn for diagnostic purposes 
or for relief of pressure on the brain. 
The cerebellum, sometimes called the hindbrain because it is located under 
the back portion of the cerebrum, functions to assist in the coordination of 
voluntary body movement and maintaining body balance. The brainstem is a 
stem-like portion of the brain that connects the brain to the spinal cord. The 
pons, meaning “bridge,” connects the cerebrum with the cerebellum and the 
brainstem. The thalamus acts as a relay station for body sensations such as 
pain, and the hypothalamus controls body temperature, sleep, appetite, and 
the pituitary gland.
The medulla oblongata, located between the pons and the spinal cord, regu-
lates the centers that control respiration, heart rate, blood vessels, and the 
respiratory system. This is also sometimes known as the reptilian brain. It is 
the last part of the brain to shut down at death.

265
 Chapter 20: Calming Down: The Nervous System
Spinal cord
The spinal cord passes through the vertebral canal from the medulla oblon-
gata to the second lumbar vertebra. The spinal cord conducts nerve impulses 
to and from the brain. The cord carries all nerves that affect limbs and lower 
body and is a passageway for impulses getting to and from the brain.
A cross-section of the spinal cord shows an inner section of gray matter that 
contains cell bodies and dendrites of peripheral nerves, and an outer region 
of white matter that contains nerve fiber, surrounded by myelin sheaths, con-
ducting impulses to and from the brain.
Meninges are three layers of connective tissue membrane surrounding the 
brain and spinal cord. The outer membrane, the dura mater, is a thick, tough 
membrane containing channels for blood to come into the brain tissue. The 
second layer around the brain and spinal cord, the arachnoid membrane 
(arachnoid meaning “spider-like”), is loosely attached to other meninges. The 
subdural space is a potential space between the dura mater and the arachnoid 
that contains blood vessels. A space between the fibers and the third mem-
brane is called the subarachnoid space, and it contains the cerebrospinal fluid. 
A third layer of meninges, closest to the brain and spinal cord, called the pia 
mater, is made up of delicate connective tissue with a rich supply of blood 
vessels.
 
The Latin translation of dura mater means “hard mother,” whereas pia mater 
means “soft mother.” Meninges were first named by a Persian doctor in the 
10th century. When translated into Latin, that changes to dura mater. Mater 
was used because Persians thought that meninges were the mother of all 
other body membranes.    
Peripheral Nervous System
It’s worth mentioning here that the nervous system is one giant system that 
is subdivided into the central nervous system (which we just covered) and 
the peripheral nervous system. The peripheral nervous system then divides 
into two parts: the somatic system and the autonomic system. The auto-
nomic system further divides to include sympathetic and parasympathetic 
systems. All subdivisions connect in some way to perform their functions, 
but they all remain part of the main nervous system.
The peripheral nervous system consists of the somatic system, or voluntary 
nervous system, whose actions we consciously control. Then there are groups 
of nerves that function involuntarily or automatically, without conscious 

266
Par t IV: Let’s Get Some Physiology Terminology 
control. These nerves compose the autonomic nervous system. This is system 
made up of nerve fibers and carries impulses from the central nervous system 
to glands, the heart, blood vessels, and the involuntary muscles, such as 
those found in the walls of the intestines and hollow organs — the stomach 
and urinary bladder, for example. 
Peripheral nerves have different names, depending on the direction of the 
impulse they carry. Afferent nerves carry impulses to the brain and spinal 
cord from receptors like the skin, eyes, ears, and nose. Efferent nerves carry 
impulses from the central nervous system to organs that produce a response.
The automatic nervous system is further divided into the sympathetic and 
parasympathetic systems. Some of the autonomic nerves are called sympa-
thetic nerves. The sympathetic nerves stimulate the body in times of stress 
and crisis by increasing the heart rate, dilating airways to supply more 
oxygen, and increasing blood pressure. Conversely, the parasympathetic 
nerves relax the involuntary nerves to calm you down. 
Nervous Root Words
Now you know the major players in the nervous system. It’s hard to believe 
the brain and spinal cord hold so much responsibility for the way your entire 
body functions. And like a supercomputer, one small glitch in how the neu-
rons fire or how the messages are sent down the spinal cord can make the 
difference between, say, walking and being confined to a wheelchair. 
Now let’s start building some vocabulary. Table 20-1 lists prefixes and suf-

Common Nervous Conditions
Because the nervous system is involved in so many aspects of your body’s 
function, the conditions that affect it can have long-lasting implications on all 
bodily systems. Let’s take a look at some of the pathological conditions per-
taining to the central nervous system:
 
✓ Aphasia involves loss or impairment of the ability to speak.
 
✓ Cerebrovascular accident (CVA) is also known as a stroke. It can be 
a rupture (hemorrhagic stroke) or obstruction of an artery (ischemic 
stroke), producing headache, nausea, vomiting, possible coma, paralysis, 
and aphasia.
 
✓ Coma is a state of unconsciousness in which a person cannot be 
aroused. 
 
✓ Concussion is a temporary dysfunction after injury, usually clearing 
within 24 hours. It’s basically a bruise on the brain.
 
✓ Dysphasia is the condition of having difficulty speaking.
 
✓ Epilepsy refers to a sudden disturbance of the nervous system function-
ing due to abnormal electrical activity of the brain. It can manifest by 
a grand mal seizure, with loss of consciousness, limb contractions, and 
incontinence. It could also be as minor as an absence seizure, in which 
the person appears be “spaced out” for a moment.
 
 The Greek epilepsia means “seizure” and is derived from epi meaning 
“upon” and lambancia meaning “to seize.” Officially, the term means 
“seized upon.”
 
 Grand mal (large) seizures (also called tonic-clonic seizures) are charac-
terized by severe convulsions and unconsciousness. Petit mal (small) 
seizures (also called absence seizures) consist of momentary lapses of 
consciousness. 
 
✓ Hemiparesis is slight paralysis of half (either right or left side) of the 
body.
 
✓ Hemiplegia is paralysis of the right or left side of body often occurring 
after a stroke.
 
✓ Hydrocephalus refers to an abnormal accumulation of fluid in the ven-
tricles of the brain.
 
✓ Irreversible coma is a coma from which there is no response to stimuli, 
no spontaneous movement, and a flat or inactive electroencephalogram 
(a record of the brain’s activity). This is what is known as a brain death. 

270

✓ Meningocele is the protrusion of the meninges through a defect in the 
skull or vertebral column.
 
✓ Myasthenia gravis is muscle weakness marked by progressive paraly-
sis that can affect any muscle in the body, but mainly those of the face, 
tongue, throat, and neck.
 
✓ Neuralgia means pain in a nerve.
 
✓ Neuritis is inflammation of a nerve.
 
✓ Neuroma is a tumor made up of nerve cells.
 
✓ Neurosis is an emotional disorder involving an ineffective way of coping 
with anxiety.
 
✓ Palsy means paralysis. One of the most common examples is cerebral 
palsy, a partial paralysis and lack of muscle coordination due to damage 
to the cerebrum of a fetus during pregnancy.
 
 Paraplegia: The Greek para means “beside,” and plegia means “paralysis.”
 
 Bell’s palsy involves facial paralysis due to a disorder of the facial nerve; 
the cause is unknown, but complete recovery is possible.
 
✓ Polyneuritis is the inflammation of many nerves.
 
✓ Psychosis refers to a major mental disorder characterized by extreme 
derangement, often accompanied by delusions and hallucinations.
 
✓ Shingles, also known as herpes zoster, is a viral disease affecting periph-
eral nerves. Blisters and pain spread in a band-like pattern following the 
route of peripheral nerves affected. 
 
✓ Subdural hematoma is a blood tumor below the dura mater, produced 
by the collection of blood in tissue or a cavity.
 
✓ Syncope means fainting or sudden loss of consciousness.
Finding the Culprit: Nervous Diseases 
and Pathology 
The diseases and more serious pathological conditions of the nervous 
system, again, have major implications for the way the rest of your body 
functions. From the way your muscles move to the coordination of involun-
tary reflexes, your nervous system can be subject to a wide range of serious 
pathological issues. Here are just a few of them:

271
 Chapter 20: Calming Down: The Nervous System
 
✓ Alzheimer’s disease: Brain disorder marked by deterioration in mental 
capacity, caused by atrophy (wasting away) of the brain cells; devel-
ops gradually; early signs are loss of memory for recent events, and an 
impairment of judgment and comprehension
 
✓ Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS): Also called Lou Gehrig disease, a 
progressive muscular atrophy or wasting away, caused by hardening of 
nerve tissue in the spinal cord
 
✓ Meningitis: Inflammation of the meninges caused by bacteria (bacterial 
meningitis) or a virus (viral meningitis), an infection of subarachnoid 
spaces
 
✓ Multiple sclerosis (MS): Destruction of the myelin sheath around nerve 
fibers; scar tissue forms and prevents the conduction of nerve impulses 
causing muscle weakness and paralysis
 
✓ Parkinson’s disease: Degeneration of the nerves of the brain, occurring 
in later life, leading to tremors, weakness of muscles, and slowness of 
movement; a progressive condition that leads to muscle stiffness, shuf-
fling gait (manner of walking), and forward-leaning posture
 
 Dr. James Parkinson, an English physician, described Parkinson’s disease 
in 1817. It is also called parkinsonism, paralysis agitans, and shaking palsy.
 
✓ Reye’s syndrome: Disease of the brain and other organs, such as the 
liver; affects children in adolescence; cause unknown but typically fol-
lows a viral infection
 
✓ Spina bifida: Congenital defect of the spinal column due to malunion of 
the vertebral parts
 
✓ Spina bifida occulta: Vertebral lesion covered with skin and not seen; 
evident only on x-ray examination
 
✓ Transient ischemic attack (TIA): Sudden deficient supply of blood to the 
brain lasting a short time; sometimes called a “baby” stroke 
Testing, Testing: Nervous Radiology 
and Diagnostic Tests
Now that you’ve read about some of the nervous system’s conditions and 
diseases, here’s a bit about how to diagnose them. Because many of the fol-
lowing tests deal with delicate parts, such as the spinal cord and brain, phy-
sicians try to keep invasive measures to a minimum. It’s certainly a good idea 
to find a solid, reputable facility you feel comfortable with instead of going to 
Joe Bob’s House of MRIs.

272
Par t IV: Let’s Get Some Physiology Terminology 
And now, to the testing:
 
✓ Cerebral angiography: Contrast medium (such as dye) is injected into 
an artery, and X-rays are taken of the blood vessel systems of the brain. 
This is also called arteriography.
 
✓ Cerebrospinal fluid analysis analyzes cell count, bacterial smears, and cul-
tures of the CSF when disease of the meninges or the brain is suspected.
 
✓ Computerized tomography (CT) scans are performed on the brain to 
locate a tumor, foreign matter, or blocked vessel.
 
✓ Electroencephalography (EEG) is a recording of the electrical activity of 
the brain, performed to diagnose epilepsy.
 
✓ Lumbar or spinal puncture is when cerebrospinal fluid is withdrawn for 
analysis from between two lumbar vertebrae. Contrast medium for X-ray 
studies such as a myelogram or intrathecal medicine may be adminis-
tered via lumbar puncture procedure.
 
✓ Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a noninvasive technique producing 
cross-sectional and vertical images of soft tissues of the brain by use of 
magnetic waves. Unlike a CT scan, the MRI produces images without the 
use of radiation or contrast medium. It is used to visualize tumors, edema, 
and to confirm multiple sclerosis.
 
✓ Myelogam is a procedure in which contrast medium is injected into the 
CSF, and X-rays are taken of the spinal cord.
 
✓ Positron emission tomography (PET) is a technique that permits view-
ing of a slice of the brain and gives information of brain function such as 
blood flow.
Tumors: Unwelcome guests
Tumors are another serious pathological issue 
affecting the nervous system. Working much 
the way a virus attacks a computer, tumors 
attach, grow, and wreak general havoc on any-
thing they touch.
A glioma occurs in the brain tissue, whereas a 
meningioma arises from the meninges. Gliomas 
are highly malignant tumors that almost never 
metastasize or spread. Example of a glioma 
is an astrocytoma, a tumor composed of 
astrocytes. Gliomas are usually removed surgi-
cally. Meningiomas are most often benign and 
surrounded by a capsule, but may cause com-
pression or distortion on the brain.
Another type of tumor is a neuroblastoma. This 
is a malignant tumor arising from nerve cells. It 
may be inherited and occurs most often in adre-
nal glands; it occurs in childhood and is treated 
with combined surgery and chemotherapy.

Surgeries and Procedures
Most surgeries of this system involve removal of tumors in the brain itself, 
whether malignant or benign. Tumors of the spinal cord can also be removed 
surgically. Surgery on the brain and the spinal cord is, as you might imagine, 
very involved and detailed, due to the complexity of nerves and the tissue 
involved. So, again, think reputable institution and not Craniotomy Mart.
But, we digress. Let’s start getting inside your head, literally: 
 
✓ Craniotomy: Surgical cutting into and opening the skull to gain access to 
the brain tissue for surgery
 
✓ Laminectomy: Excision of the posterior arch of a vertebra
 
✓ Neurectomy: Excision of a nerve
 
✓ Neuroplasty: Surgical repair of a nerve
Terminology RX: Nervous Pharmacology
Now it’s time to treat yourself to some drugs. Here are some common types 
of medications used to treat disorders and conditions of the nervous system:
 
✓ Anticonvulsants, hypnotics, and sedatives are used to treat various 
types of seizures. 
 
✓ CNS stimulants are used to treat attention deficit disorders.
 
✓ Cognition adjuvant therapy is given to treat Alzheimer’s disease.
 
✓ Hypnotics are used to treat sleeping disorders; examples include 
barbiturates and nonbarbiturates.
 
The Greek root of hyponotics, hypos, means “to sleep.”

▶ Figuring out how your urinary system works
▶ Checking out root words, prefixes, and suffixes appropriate to this system
▶ Using terminology of the urinary system to discuss common conditions and diseases
▶ Finding the right terms to use when diagnosing problems
You probably don’t give much thought to how your urinary plumbing 
works every time you use the restroom. However, it becomes a major 
concern the minute your, uh, output, isn’t putting out like it should. Welcome 
to the wonderful world of the urinary system! From kidneys to bladders, your 
body is full of all sorts of parts whose sole purpose is to clean your system of 
toxins by way of creating urine.
Believe it or not, a whole arm of the medical profession is dedicated to help-
ing you add your contribution to the toilet bowl on a regular basis. So the next 
time you see someone with a license plate that reads, for example, 2PCME, you 
can bet it’s a urologist on the way to work, to be a human plumber of sorts. 
Let’s take a look at what takes up so much of his or her time.
How the Urinary System Works
The urinary system is made up of the kidneys (you have two), ureters (also 
two), bladder, and urethra (one). This system’s main function is to remove 
urea, the waste product of metabolism, from the bloodstream and excrete 
the urea (in the urine) from the body.

278
Par t V: Name That Plumbing 
So, how does that big steak dinner you ate last night turn into the next morn-
ing’s output in the form of urine? Well, food and oxygen combine in cells to 
produce energy, a process called catabolism. In the process, food and oxygen 
are not destroyed, but small particles making up the food and oxygen are rear-
ranged in new combinations, and part of the result is waste products. Waste 
products in the form of gases (carbon dioxide) are removed from the body 
by exhaling through the lungs. Nitrogenous waste (the by-product of protein 
food) is more difficult to excrete from the body than gases. This kind of waste 
is secreted as a soluble dissolved in water, a waste substance called urine. The 
main function of the urinary system is to remove urea from the bloodstream.
Urea is formed in the liver from ammonia (which is, believe it or not, basi-
cally the same stuff you use to clean the kitchen). The bloodstream carries it 
(in the same manner as hormones and lymph) to the kidneys, where it passes 
with water, salts, and acids out of the bloodstream into the kidneys. The 
kidneys remove waste products, producing urine that travels through each 
ureter into the bladder. Urine is then excreted from the bladder via the ure-
thra. Magically (or so it might seem), your steak dinner has turned into pee!

 Chapter 21: When You Gotta Go: The Urinary System
Kidneys
You have two kidneys, unless you’ve had one removed. Kidneys are dark red-
dish brown, bean-shaped organs that are located behind the abdominal cavity 
on each side of the spine in the lumbar region. They are embedded in a cush-
ion of adipose (fat) tissue and surrounded by connective tissue for support. 
Each kidney is about the size of a fist and weighs approximately 8 ounces. The 
left kidney is a little larger and sits a little higher than the right one. 
Each kidney consists of an outer cortex and an inner medulla region. The 
cortex contains millions of nephrons, and the medulla contains the collecting 
tubules (small tubes). A segment on the medial border of each kidney, called 
the hilum, allows the blood vessels, nerves, and ureter to pass through. The 
nephron is the kidney’s functional and structural unit, or the “brains” of the 
kidney. Each is a urine-producing microscopic structure, consisting of a renal 
corpuscle and renal tubule. 
 
Hilum’s Latin meaning is “a small thing or a trifle.” This is a term for a depres-
sion or pit in an organ where vessels and nerves enter.
Glomeruli (singular glomerulus) are clusters of capillaries (small vessels) at 
the entrance of each nephron. They help filter the blood, beginning the pro-
cess of urine production. In the blood-filtering process, water and solutes 
from the blood in the glomeruli pass through the capillaries and the walls 
that make up the glomeruli into the tubules. Tubules have the ability to 
remove substances your body needs and return them to the blood. 
 
The Greek word pyelos means “tub-shaped vessel,” which describes the shape 
of each kidney.
The story behind what’s in the bowl
Here are the vital stats of your wee-wee. Normal 
urine is translucent pale amber in color with the 
distinctive odor you are familiar with. It consists 
of 95 percent water with dissolved substances, 
nitrogenous waste, pigments, toxins, hormones, 
and sometimes abnormal substances like blood, 
glucose (sugar), and albumin. Of course, if your 
naked eye can see blood in your urine, it’s time 
to call your physician.
Average urine output in a 24-hour period is 
approximately 1000–2000 mL (milliliters). Urine’s 
normal specific gravity should be somewhere 
between 1.015 and 1.025. Specific gravity is 
the weight of a substance compared with the 
weight of some other substance taken as a 
standard. Water is the usual standard in liquids. 
The specific gravity of water is 1. If urine shows 
a specific gravity of 1.025, it means the urine is 
1.025 times heavier than water.  
Be on the lookout for dark yellow urine. This 
means your pee is overly concentrated, which 
may indicate a degree of dehydration.

280
Par t V: Name That Plumbing 
Ureters
You have two ureters (right and left). They are muscular tubes about 15–18 
inches long, lined with mucous membrane, extending from the renal pelvis 
down to the bladder. The left ureter is longer because the left kidney sits 
higher in position. The urine enters the bladder in spurts via each ureter 
every 10–30 seconds.
At the bladder entrance is a ureteral orifice (opening) that opens to allow 
urine into the bladder from each ureter. The orifice works in sequence with 
the peristaltic (wave-like) action that propels the urine through the ureter. 
This action prevents urine from flowing back into the ureter when the blad-
der contracts. 
Urinary bladder
The urinary bladder is a hollow, very elastic muscular sac in the pelvic cavity. 
It acts as a temporary reservoir or “holding tank” for urine. It has two openings 
to receive the urine coming from each ureter. Another opening, the urethra, 
provides an exit route for the urine out of the body. The trigone is a triangular 
space at the base of the bladder where the ureters enter the bladder. 
 
An average bladder holds more than 250 ml of urine before producing the 
desire to urinate.
Contraction of the bladder and internal sphincter is an involuntary action, whereas 
the action of the external sphincter is controlled by you. The act of preventing 
or concluding voiding (urination) is learned and voluntary in a healthy body.
Urethra
The urethra is a membranous tube that carries urine from the bladder to the 
exterior of the body. The process of expelling or voiding urine is technically 
called micturition. The external opening of the urethra is the urethral meatus or 
urinary meatus. The female urethra is about 1 ½ inches long, and its only func-
tion is urination. In the male, it is approximately 8 inches long. It extends from 
the bladder neck through the prostate and through the penis. The male urethra 
carries both urine and reproductive organ secretions (see Chapter 22). Thanks 
to Mother Nature, the urethra can’t mix sperm and urine, so it’s difficult to pee 
with an erection. That sure prevents unwanted embarrassment during those 
tender moments.
 
Catheter comes from the Greek catheter, meaning “a thing let down.” A catheter 
lets down urine from the bladder.

281
 Chapter 21: When You Gotta Go: The Urinary System
 
Micturate comes from the Latin mictus, which means “a making of water.” From 
the verb micturate comes the noun micturition. Be sure to note the spelling: 
Micturition (expelling urine) is often misspelled as micturation.
 
The p is silent in pneumonia, just as pee is silent in a swimming pool. That’s 
why you probably should not frequent swim-up bars on vacation. You never 
know what is lurking in the water.
Urinary Root Words
Now it’s time to turn on the flow (pun entirely intended) of prefixes, suffixes, 
and root words. In the case of the prefixes and suffixes, you will find that 
these beginnings and endings of urinary words tend to allude to some sort 
of condition or state of the urinary system. Table 21-1 gets you started with 
prefixes and suffixes.
Filtration, reabsorption, and secretion . . . oh, my!
As blood passes through the glomeruli of each 
kidney, the process of forming urine begins. 
There are three steps to this process: filtration, 
reabsorption, and secretion. Glomerular walls 
are thin to permit water, salt, sugar, and nitrog-
enous waste such as urea, creatinine, and uric 
acid to filter out of the blood. Each kidney is sur-
rounded by a cup-like structure that collects the 
substances filtering out of the blood. This cup-
like structure is called Bowman’s capsule. 
If the process of forming urine stopped here, the 
body would lose a great deal of needed water, 
sugar, and salt that would be filtered out of the 
blood with the waste. Each Bowman’s capsule 
is connected to a long twisted tube called a 
renal tubule. As the water, salt, and waste pass 
through this tubule, the materials that the body 
needs are able to re-enter the bloodstream 
through tiny capillaries. By the time the filtrated 
material reaches the end of the renal tubule, 
the materials that the body needs to keep have 
been re-absorbed.
The waste, along with some water, salt and 
acids, passes from the renal tubule into the 
central collecting area of the kidney. Thousands 
of tubules deposit urine into the central renal 
pelvis, a space that fills most of the medulla of 
the kidney. Cup-like divisions of the renal pelvis 
called calyces (singular calyx) receive the urine, 
which is (as we mention earlier) made up of 95 
percent water, plus 5 percent urea, creatinine, 
acids, and salts. The renal pelvis narrows into 
the ureter that carries the urine to the urinary 
bladder, where it is temporarily stored. When 
the bladder reaches its capacity, the urge or 
need to void (urinate) is felt and urine is expelled 
from the bladder via the urethra. Then, it’s off to 
the bathroom you go!

Common Urinary Conditions
Ah, your urinary system. So few parts, yet so many possible things that can go 
wrong. Who hasn’t enjoyed a few days on the cranberry juice diet thanks to an 
inconvenient and painful bladder infection? And who could forget the joys of 
passing a good, old-fashioned kidney stone? Good times — not so much.
When you are dealing with common conditions, remember that inflamma-
tion is the arch nemesis of the urinary system. When your urinary parts are 
inflamed, bacteria has a perfect place to grow amidst a system transporting 
waste material. This results in infection and a great deal of discomfort. Here 
are some of the usual suspects: 
 
✓ Cystitis: Inflammation of the bladder
 
✓ Ureteritis: Inflammation of a ureter
 
✓ Urethritis: Inflammation of the urethra
 
✓ Urinary tract infection (UTI): Infection of one or more organs of the 
urinary tract

Finding the Culprit: Urinary Diseases 
and Pathology
Although the typical urinary conditions can cause inconvenience and dis-
comfort, they are sometimes signposts for more serious pathological condi-
tions and diseases. These more serious issues range from diseases that affect 
kidney function to various varieties of cancer:
 
✓ CRF (chronic renal failure): When kidney function is not sufficient, 
leading to dialysis or transplantation
 
✓ Cystocele: Protrusion or sagging of the bladder
 
✓ End-stage renal disease (ESRD): Chronic irreversible renal (kidney) failure
 
✓ Epispadias: Congenital defect in which the urinary meatus is located 
on the upper surface of penis; usually corrected surgically shortly after 
birth
 
✓ Essential hypertension: High blood pressure without apparent cause
 
✓ Glomerulonephritis: Inflammation of kidney glomeruli caused by any 
number of things, including connective tissue diseases like lupus, endo-
crine diseases like diabetes, or bacterial infection like untreated Group A 
Betahemolytic Streptococcus
 
✓ Hydronephrosis: Water or fluid distention in the renal pelvis caused by 
obstruction of the ureter
 
✓ Hydroureter: Distention of ureter with urine due to blockage
 
✓ Hypernephroma: Renal carcinoma in adults
 
✓ Hypospadias: Congenital defect in which the urinary meatus is located 
on the under side of the penis; usually corrected surgically as well
 
✓ Incontinence: Inability to prevent voiding of urine
 
✓ Nephritis: Inflammation of the kidney
 
✓ Nephroblastoma: Kidney tumor containing developing cells 
(Wilms’ tumor)
 
✓ Nephrolith: Kidney stone
 
✓ Nephrolithiasis: Kidney stones or renal calculi
 
✓ Nephroma: Tumor of the kidney
 
✓ Nephromegaly: Enlargement of the kidney
 
✓ Nephroptosis: Drooping or fallen kidney

285
 Chapter 21: When You Gotta Go: The Urinary System
 
✓ Nephrotic syndrome: Condition due to excessive protein loss in urine
 
✓ Nephrosis: Any disease of the kidney
 
✓ Polycystic disease: Multiple fluid-filled sacs (cysts) in the kidneys
 
✓ Pyelitis: Inflammation of the renal pelvis
 
✓ Pyelonephritis: Inflammation of renal pelvis
 
✓ Renal calculi: Stones in the kidney
 
✓ Renal cell carcinoma: Malignancy of kidney involving the renal paren-
chyma (all its essential parts) 
 
✓ Renal colic: Pain due to blockage during passage of a kidney stone
 
✓ Renal hypertension: High blood pressure resulting from kidney disease 
(secondary hypertension)

as adenomyosarcoma
 
✓ Transitional cell carcinoma: Malignancy affecting bladder, ureters, and 
renal pelvis
 
✓ Urinary retention: Blockage in passage of urine or muscle control 
problems leading to incomplete voiding with the same result
 
✓ Urinary incontinence: Inability to hold urine in the bladder
Testing, Testing: Urinary Radiology 
and Diagnostic Tests
Testing the urinary system for diseases and pathological conditions is a bit 
more involved than peeing in a cup and sending the sample off to the lab. 
Physicians can prescribe all kinds of tests to root out the problems that 
affect your plumbing.
First, let’s start with some of the tests that do involve the old reliable urine 
sample. These tests are part of a total urinalysis (microscopic analysis of 
urine), also known as the UA, or blood screening process to evaluate ade-
quate functioning of the urinary system:
 
✓ Addis count: Urine test to determine kidney disease; total volume mea-
surement of urine output in 24-hour period is used to evaluate kidney 
function
 
 Excessive bilirubins can cause jaundice in newborns.

286
Par t V: Name That Plumbing 
 
✓ BUN (blood, urea, nitrogen): Measures amount of urea in the blood; 
when kidney is diseased or fails, urea accumulates, leading to 
unconsciousness and death
 
✓ CCT (creatinine clearance test): Measures the ability of the kidney to 
remove creatinine, a white crystallized compound, from the blood
 
✓ Phenylketonuria (PKU): Substance found in urine of newborns indicating 
congenital problems (routinely performed on newborns)
Physicians might also recommend diagnostic imaging or X-rays to be performed 
on the urinary system. These imaging procedures are, for the most part, non-
invasive with the exception of having to add contrast media (often a dye) to the 
body so that problems show up on the X-ray. Some common diagnostic imaging 
procedures include the following:
 
✓ CAT scan: Stands for Computerized Axial Tomography; a transverse X-ray 
of kidneys to diagnosis tumors, cysts, abscesses, and hydronephrosis
 
✓ Cystogram: X-ray of bladder
 
✓ Cystopyelogram: X-ray of bladder and renal pelvis

Surgeries and Procedures
A plethora of surgeries and procedures are available to help treat disorders 
and diseases. Like procedures for other body systems, these most often 
involve excisions, incisions, and repairs. Think of your surgeon as the master 
plumber of human pipes. These are some typical procedures used in fixing 
your peeing parts:
 
✓ Cystectomy: Surgical excision of the bladder
 
✓ Cystoplasty: Surgical repair of the bladder
 
✓ Cystostomy: Creation of an artificial opening to the bladder
 
✓ Cystotomy: Incision into the bladder
 
✓ Fulguration: Destruction of living tissue with an electric spark, used to 
remove bladder growth or small tumor

Terminology RX: Urinary Pharmacology
The medications used most often in the treatment of urinary conditions and 
diseases are used for lots of other bodily issues. You will no doubt recognize 
these drug families, as they are crossover drugs. 
Traditional antibiotics are typically used to treat urinary tract infections. 
These drugs are most effective against gram-negative E. coli organisms, the 
common culprits in UTIs (urinary tract infections). Gram-negative is a nega-
tive response to a Gram’s stain, a staining method to detect microorganisms. 
Though drinking a lot of cranberry juice is helpful when you have an uncom-
fortable UTI, it is not a panacea. Rely on prescription antibiotics to really 
wipe out the infection and get your pee flowing again. Another type of drug 
common in treating urinary tract infections is the family of sulfonamides.

289
 Chapter 21: When You Gotta Go: The Urinary System
 
Diuretics, often taken for hypertension, make the kidneys work overtime. A 
potassium (K) supplement is often given to maintain therapeutic potassium 
levels in the blood. A diuretic increases the excretion of urine, putting the 
entire urinary system into overdrive, which is not good for the kidneys or for 
sodium and potassium levels. This is why great caution is exercised when 
prescribing these drugs, and all drugs in this family are by prescription only. 
There are some common, everyday items that have diuretic effects, such as 
the caffeine in your coffee or soda.

T
hey say it takes two to tango. You can’t create life without input from 
both the male and the female reproductive organs. Both are equally 
important to the process of babymaking, which is why they each get their 
own chapter in this book. Normally, we would say, “Ladies first,” but in this 
case, let’s start our reproductive discussion with the guys, who donate the 
“little soldiers” responsible for egg fertilization. 
How the Male Reproductive 
System Works 
The reproductive system in the male has two main functions, to produce 
spermatozoa (singular: spermatozoon), the male reproductive cells, and to 
secrete testosterone, the male hormone. The male reproductive organs, or 
gonads, are the testes. They are supported by accessory organs, ducts, and 
glands. The ducts include the epididymides (singular: epididymis) vas defer-
ens, ejaculatory ducts, and the urethra. Glands include seminal vesicles, pros-
tate, and bulbourethral glands (or Cowper’s glands). The supporting structures 
include the penis, scrotum, and spermatic cords. 
The spermatozoon is called sperm for short. Each sperm is a microscopic 
cell, measuring less than 1/100,000th the size of the female ovum. Its structure 
is uncomplicated, composed of a head region that contains the hereditary 

292
Par t V: Name That Plumbing 
material, or chromosomes, and a tail. This tail region, called the flagellum, is a 
hair-like structure that makes the sperm motile (able to move by itself), resem-
bling a tadpole. 
The sperm cell contains little food and cytoplasm, because a sperm only 
needs to live long enough to travel from its point of release in the male to 
where the ovum (egg cell) lies in the female in the fallopian tube. Only one 
spermatozoon can penetrate a single egg and achieve fertilization. Imagine, 
of the approximately 300–500 million spermatozoa that can be released in a 
single ejaculation, only one can complete the fertilization process. 
 
The male reproductive system produces 100 million sperm per day (that’s 
a rate of 1,000 for every heartbeat), from puberty until death! The organs of 
the male reproductive system are designed to produce and release billions of 
spermatozoa throughout the male’s lifetime.
In addition, the male reproductive system secretes the male hormone (or 
androgen) testosterone. Testosterone is necessary for the proper develop-
ment of the male gonads from the fetal stage through adulthood, the testes 
or testicles (singular: testis) and accessory organs of the testes, the prostate 
gland, and seminal vesicles. Testosterone is also responsible for the produc-
tion of secondary body characteristics of the male, such as a facial hair and 
voice deepening. The prostate gland and seminal vesicles secrete fluid to 
ensure the sperm cells’ lubrication and viability (the ability to live). 
Figure 22-1 takes a look at this system’s anatomy, and the organs and parts 
that make up the system.

 Chapter 22: Check the Plumbing: The Male Reproductive System
Testes
The male gonads consist of two testes or testicles, which are egg-shaped 
glands that develop in the kidney region before descending into the scrotum 
before birth. 
The interior of a testis is composed of a large mass of narrow coiled tubules 
called the seminiferous tubules. These contain cells that manufacture sperma-
tozoa. These tubules are the parenchymal tissue of the testis, meaning they 
perform the essential work of the organ. Other cells in the testis, called intersti-
tial cells (or Leydig cells), manufacture the male hormone testosterone. These 
tubules come together and enter the head of the epididymis.
The scrotum is a sac enclosing the testes on the outside of the body. The 
scrotum lies between the thighs in order to expose the testes to a lower tem-
perature than if they were enclosed within the body. This lower temperature 
is necessary for the adequate maturing and development of sperm. 
Between the anus and the scrotum, at the floor of the pelvic cavity in the 
male is the perineum, which is similar to the perineal region in the female. 
Ducts
Once formed, sperm cells move through the seminiferous tubules and 
are collected in ducts that lead to a large tube at the upper part of each 
testis, the epididymis. The spermatozoa become motile and move into the 
epididymis, where they are stored.
The epididymis runs the length of each testicle, is about 20 feet long when 
uncoiled, and is the passageway for sperm from the testis to the body sur-
face. It stores sperm before ejaculation and secretes a portion of the seminal 
fluid (semen).
The vas deferens are a pair of tubes approximately 0.3 cm in diameter and 
2 feet long. The tubes, a continuation of the epididymis, carry the sperm up 
into the pelvic region and around the urinary bladder, where they connect 
with the seminal vesicle duct to form the ejaculatory duct. It is the vas def-
erens that are cut or tied off when a male sterilization procedure, called a 
vasectomy, is performed.
Ejaculatory ducts are formed by the joining of vas deferens with the ducts of 
the seminal vesicles, which are located at the base of the bladder and open 
into the vas deferens as it joins the urethra. These vesicles secrete a thick 
yellow substance, seminal fluid, that nourishes the sperm cells and forms 
much of the volume of the ejaculated semen or seminal fluid. 

294
Par t V: Name That Plumbing 
Urethra
Semen is a combination of fluid and spermatozoa, ejected from the body 
through the urethra. In the male, the genital orifice (opening) combines with 
the urinary urethral opening. The male urethra is part of the urinary system 
as well as the reproductive system because it aids in the output of both urine 
and semen.
Cowper’s glands, or bulbourethral glands, are just below the prostate gland 
and also secrete fluid into the urethra. The urethra passes through the penis 
to exit the body.
Prostate
At the region where the vas deferens enters the urethra, and almost encircl-
ing the upper end of the urethra, is the prostate gland. This gland secretes a 
thick alkaline fluid which, as part of the seminal fluid, aids in the motility of 
the sperm. This gland is also supplied with muscular tissue that aids in the 
expulsion of sperm during ejaculation. The alkaline also protects the sperm 
from acid present in the male urethra and the vagina of the female. 
 
Prostate comes from the Greek pro meaning “before.” Statis means “standing”; 
by anatomy, is the gland standing slightly before and below the bladder.
Penis
The penis is composed of three rounded masses of erectile tissue and at its tip 
expands to form a soft, sensitive region called the glans penis. The glans penis 
is covered with a retractable double fold of skin called the prepuce (foreskin). 
The penis contains the urethra that carries both seminal fluid and urine. It is 
the organ by means of which sperm is ejected into the female vagina.
Male Reproductive Root Words
To really stretch a metaphor, as the human race needs both male and female 
reproductive systems in order to survive by creating new life, the medical 
terms associated with the male reproductive system need both prefixes and 
suffixes to create new words.

Common Male Reproductive 
Conditions
The makeup of the male reproductive system, with all its tubes and ducts, 
can be complicated and subject to several types of conditions. Here are some 
of the pathological conditions associated with the male reproductive system: 
 
✓ Adenocarcinoma: Malignant tumor of the prostate; second most 
common cause of cancer deaths in men over 50; radical (complete) 
prostatectomy along with radiation and chemotherapy is the most 
common treatment
 
✓ Andropathy: Diseases of the male
 
✓ Anorchism: The state of absence of a testicle, one or both
 
✓ Aspermia: Condition of absence of sperm
 
✓ Balanocele: Protrusion of glans penis (through rupture of prepuce)
 
✓ Balanitis: Inflammation of glans penis
 
✓ Balanorrhea: Excessive discharge from the glans penis, often the first 
symptom of a sexually transmitted disease
 
✓ BPH (benign prostatic hypertrophy/hyperplasia): Enlargement or 
excessive development of prostate gland in males over 60 years of age, 
can cause a urinary obstruction with inability to empty the bladder com-
pletely or all at once; surgical treatment is prostatectomy
 
✓ Cryptorchidism: Undescended testicle (crypt meaning “hidden”); two 
months before birth, testicles should descend into scrotal sac
 
✓ Epididymitis: Inflammation of the epididymis
 
✓ Epispadias: Congenital (present at birth) opening of the male urethra on 
the upper surface of penis
 
✓ Erectile dysfunction: Inability of male to attain or maintain an erection 
to perform sexual intercourse
 
✓ Hydrocele: Hernia or sac of fluid in the testis or in the tube leading from 
the testis, can occur in infancy and usually resolves during the first year 
of life
 
✓ Hypospadias: Congenital opening of the male urethra on the undersur-
face of the penis (present at birth)
 
✓ Impotence: Lack of power to obtain erection or to copulate
 
✓ Oligospermia: Condition of scanty sperm (in seminal fluid)

297
 Chapter 22: Check the Plumbing: The Male Reproductive System
 
✓ Orchitis/orchiditis: Inflammation of testes or a testis
 
✓ Phimosis: Narrowing of the opening of the foreskin over the glans penis 
that does not allow the foreskin to retract, obstructing urination and 
causing secretions to accumulate under the prepuce, leading to infection
 
✓ Priapism: Prolonged abnormal erection of penis with pain and tenderness
 
✓ Prostatitis: Inflammation of the prostate gland
 
✓ Prostatocystitis: Inflammation of prostate gland and bladder
 
✓ Prostatolith: Stone in the prostate
 
✓ Prostatorrhea: Excessive discharge from the prostate
 
✓ Testicular torsion: Twisting of spermatic cord causing decreased blood 
flow to testicle; occurs most often during puberty; considered a surgical 
emergency
 
✓ Testicular carcinoma: Malignant tumor of the testis, classified according 
to type of tissue involved; examples: seminoma, embryonal carcinoma, 
and teratocarcinoma (a malignant teratoma); commonly treated with 
surgery: orchidectomy, radiation, and chemotherapy
 
✓ Varicocele: Large, herniated, swollen veins near the testis, associated 
with oligospermia (lower than normal amount of sperm) and infertility
Finding the Culprit: Male Reproductive 
Diseases and Pathology
Unfortunately, some of the most common diseases of the male reproductive 
system are the kind that make headlines, and not in a good way. Sexually trans-
mitted diseases are very serious, highly contagious, and can affect everything 
from your ability to conceive to your relationships with future sexual partners. 
Also known as venereal diseases, the following conditions occur in both male 
and female and are among the most communicable diseases in the world, 
transmitted by unprotected sexual intercourse, via body fluids. Here are the 
usual suspects:
 
✓ AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) is a sexually transmitted 
disease by exchange of body fluids during a sexual act or with use of 
contaminated needles and contaminated blood transfusion, affecting the 
body’s immune system. It is caused by HIV (Human Immunodeficiency 
Virus).
 
✓ Chlamydia, the bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis, is the causative 
agent; includes diseases of the eye and genital tract. It causes discharge 

298
Par t V: Name That Plumbing 
from the penis in males and genital itching, and vaginal discharge in 
females. It can cause infertility in women if it spreads to the ovaries and 
uterus and causes pelvic scarring secondary to the infection.
 
✓ Genital herpes is infection of the skin and mucous membranes of the 
genitals, caused by Herpesvirus hominis type 2. Symptoms include red-
dening of the skin with small fluid-filled blisters and ulcers. Remission and 
relapse periods occur, and no drug is known to be effective as a cure.
 
✓ Gonorrhea is a contagious inflammation of the genital tract mucous mem-
branes due to infection with a bacteria known as Gonococcus. Other areas 
of the body such as the eye, mouth, rectum, and joints may be affected. 
Symptoms include dysuria (painful urination) and discharge from the ure-
thra. Many women can carry this disease without symptoms, but others 
have pain, vaginal and urethral discharge. Penicillin is the method of treat-
ment. Ongoing data from the CDC demonstrate that gonorrheal infections 
have become resistant to fluoroquinolone antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin 
and ofloxacin. As a consequence, as of 2007 this class of antibiotics is no 
longer recommended for the treatment of gonorrhea in the United States. 
The most commonly recommended treatment is an injection of a cepha-
losporin class of antibiotics called ceftriaxone.
 
✓ Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the retrovirus causing AIDS. 
HIV infects T-cell helpers of the immune system, allowing for opportu-
nistic infections like candidiasis, P. carinii, pneumonia, tuberculosis, and 
Kaposi’s sarcoma.
 
✓ Human papilloma virus (HPV) is a sexually transmitted disease causing 
benign or cancerous growths in male and female genitals (venereal 
warts). Venereal warts are also known as condyloma acuminatum (plural: 
condylomata acuminata).
 
✓ Syphilis is a chronic infectious disease affecting any organ of the body 
and is caused by a spiral-shaped bacteria. A chancre, or hard ulcer, usu-
ally appears a few weeks after infection, most often on external genitals 
but may also be on the lip, tongue, or anus with enlargement of lymph 
nodes. Infection can spread to internal organs, and later stages include 
damage to brain, spinal cord, and heart. Syphilis can be congenital 
(existing at birth) to a newborn if transmitted from the mother during 
pregnancy via the placenta. Penicillin is the method of treatment.
 
✓ Trichomoniasis means infection of the urinary tract of either sex and is 
caused by the one-cell organism Trichomonas. Males may have no symp-
toms or could develop urethritis (inflammation of the urethra), or prostate 
enlargement. Females develop itching, dysuria, and vaginal discharge.
 
Venereal is derived from Venus, the goddess of love. It was thought in ancient 
times to be one of the misfortunes of love.

Testing, Testing: Male Reproductive 
Radiology and Diagnostic Tests
It’s time to test those testes! Okay, bad pun, but you get the drift. Though 
there aren’t tons of laboratory tests and diagnostic procedures used for 
this system, they remain important methods for helping men of all ages find 
peace when it comes to issues of concern related to sexual health. 
One very common test is semen analysis. This test is performed as part of fer-
tility studies and also to establishment fertility status. Sometimes the test is 
performed to determine sperm viability for couples having difficulty conceiv-
ing. It can also be performed following a vasectomy to assure that the proce-
dure was successful. In this case, semen is collected in a sterile container and 
analyzed microscopically; sperm cells are counted and examined for motility 
and shape. Analysis is also done at six weeks following vasectomy and again 
at three months, to establish aspermia.
Another common test for men is the GC/Chlamydia test, performed by insert-
ing a small cotton swab into the opening of the urethra to obtain a sample, 
which is then tested for gonorrhea and Chlamydia. 
A general viral culture tests for herpes and HIV, and is performed simply by 
swabbing an open sore.
In VDRL, also known as the Venereal Disease Research Laboratory test, the 
blood is tested to diagnose syphilis. Because the syphilis antigen stays in the 
blood for a lifetime, it can have far-reaching effects.
The PSA (prostate specific antigen test) is recommended to be done yearly on 
males over 50. This is a prescreening mechanism for precancerous condi-
tions of the prostate gland. Any rise or elevation of PSA level is followed up 
by other investigations. 
Prostate carcinoma is both serious and scary. Any time a disease, particularly 
cancer, is associated with a reproductive system, it can cause more than just 
physical symptoms. It can be emotionally and mentally devastating, because 
we associate our sexual identities with our sexual systems. Much as a 
woman feels devastated by breast cancer, a man can feel equally devastated 
by a cancer affecting his sexual health. Prostate cancer is one of the most 
common cancers associated with the male reproductive system.

or all of the gland) through the urethra; cutting back or removal of the 
prostate if enlargement of the prostate may interfere with urination
 
✓ Vasectomy: Excision of a portion of the vas deferens to perform male 
sterilization; vas deferens on each side is cut, a portion removed, and 
the free ends are tied off or clipped, done through an incision in the

The usual routine for any inflammations is antibiotics, and it’s no different 
for the male reproductive system.
Finally, on a more serious note, amebicides, antifungal agents, as well as good 
old penicillin are used to treat the STD family of bacteria. Amebicides treat 
amebal infections, almost always of the intestines; fungicides treat fungi, 
most commonly tinea cruris, or jock itch; penicillin is still the treatment for 
syphilis.

reproductive puzzle that helps create a human life, it is also the vessel that 
helps sustain that little life in the nine months prior to birth. It’s the docking 
station where sperm and egg meet and the storage facility for the end prod-
uct. That’s a lot of pressure to put on one system — create life, sustain new 
life, and nurture new life. Oh yeah, not to mention the business of squeezing

The female reproductive system produces the female reproductive cell, or 
sex cell, secretes the hormones estrogen and progesterone, and provides the 
conditions to establish a pregnancy, together with providing a safe place for 
the pregnancy to develop and grow.
The gonads (the ovaries in the female), together with the internal accessory 
organs consisting of the fallopian (uterine) tubes, uterus, vagina, external 
genitalia, and breasts (mammary glands) make up the reproductive system in 
the female. Reproduction is achieved by the union of the female reproductive 

304
Par t V: Name That Plumbing 
cell, an ovum, and the male reproductive cell, a spermatozoon (or sperm for 
short), resulting in fertilization. 
Gynecology is the study of the organs, hormones, and diseases of the female 
reproductive system. Obstetrics is the specialty dealing with care of the 
female during pregnancy and delivery of the newborn, including the 6–8-week 
period following delivery. 
The female and male sex cells (ovum and sperm), differ from normal body 
cells. Each sex cell, also called a gamete, is a specialized cell, containing half 
the number of chromosomes (23) of a normal body cell (46). As the ovum and 
sperm cells unite, the resulting cell produced, called the zygote, contains half 
the genetic material from the female sex cell and half from the male sex cell. 
This combination provides a full normal complement of hereditary material.
Take a closer look now at the working parts of the female system in

Ovaries
The ovaries are two almond-shaped glands, located on either side of the uterus 
in the pelvic cavity. They are held in place and connected to the uterus by 
the broad and ovarian ligaments. These organs have two functions: First, they 
release a mature ovum each month in a process known as ovulation. They also 
produce and secrete the sex hormones, estrogen and progesterone. Estrogen 
secretion begins development of female secondary sex characteristics, as well 
as manages the cyclic or menstrual changes in the uterus, preparing for a fertil-
ized ovum. Progesterone is produced in the corpus luteum of the ovary and in 
the placenta in order to support and nurture a fertilized ovum.
Each ovary contains thousands of sacs called graafian follicles. Each of these 
follicles contains an ovum. As an ovum matures, the graafian follicle ruptures 
to the surface and the ovum leaves the ovary. The ruptured follicle fills with 
blood and yellow material and becomes a corpus luteum. Near each ovary is 
a duct-like tube called the fallopian tube. The fallopian tubes and ovaries are 
called the adnexa, or accessory structures of the uterus. 
 
The graafian follicle is named after Reinier de Graaf, a Dutch anatomist who 
discovered the graafin sac in 1672.
Figure 23-2 shows the menstrual cycle.
Fallopian tubes
The fallopian tubes lead from each ovary to the uterus. 
The ovum, after its release, is caught up by fimbriae, the finger-like projections 
at the end of the fallopian tube. The tube is lined with small hairs that, through 
their motion, sweep the ovum in a process that takes approximately five days 
to allow that ovum to pass through the fallopian tube. Fertilization takes place 
within the fallopian tube if spermatozoa are present. If intercourse has taken 
place near the time of ovulation, and no contraception is used, sperm cells will 
be in the fallopian tube when the ovum passes through. If intercourse has not 
taken place, and the ovum is not fertilized, it will disintegrate.
 
Fallopian tubes are named after Italian anatomist Gabriele Falloppio (1523–
1562). He was also responsible for naming the vagina and placenta. We sure 
wouldn’t want to be his kid. Heaven only knows what he might name you.

Uterus
When fertilization occurs anytime between puberty and menopause, the 
fertilized ovum will grow and develop in the uterus. Hormones (estrogen and 
progesterone) are secreted from the ovary, and the HCG hormone is secreted 
from the placenta, the blood-vessel-filled organ that grows in the wall of the 
uterus during a pregnancy. 
The uterus is a muscular organ located between the bladder and the rectum. The 
uterus is pear-shaped, with muscular walls and a mucous membrane lining 
with a rich supply of blood vessels. The upper rounded portion of the uterus 
is called the fundus, and the large central portion is called the corpus or body. 
It is within the body and fundus of the uterus that a pregnancy grows. The 
epithelial mucosa of the uterus is more commonly called the endometrium. 
The muscular layer is the myometrium in the middle, and the outer membra-
nous tissue layer is the perimetrium. The narrow lower portion of the uterus is 
called the cervix, meaning “neck.” The cervix has an opening at its lower end, 
leading to the vagina (birth canal), which opens to the outside of the body.

307
 Chapter 23: A Life Force: The Female Reproductive System
Vagina
The vagina is a muscular tube approximately 6 inches long and lined with 
mucous membrane. The entrance to the vagina is called the introitus. 
The clitoris is situated in front of the vaginal opening and the urethral meatus. 
The clitoris is similar in structure to the penis in the male, being an organ 
made up of sensitive, erectile tissue. 
Bartholin’s glands are two small glands on each side of the vaginal opening. 
They produce a mucous secretion that lubricates the vagina. 
 
Bartholin’s gland is named after Caspar Thomeson Bartholin, a Danish anato-
mist (1655–1738). 
The region between the vaginal opening and the anus is called the perineum. 
This may be torn during the process of childbirth in a vaginal delivery. To 
avoid a perineal tear, the perineum may be cut prior to delivery. This incision 
is called an episiotomy. 
The external genitalia (organs of reproduction) of the female are together 
called the vulva. The labia majora are the outer lips of the vagina, and the 
labia minora are the smaller inner lips. The hymen is a mucous membrane 
partially covering the entrance to the vagina. The clitoris and Bartholin’s 
glands are also part of the vulva.
Time to accessorize!
The breasts are considered accessory organs 
of the reproduction system. They are mammary, 
or milk-producing glands, composed of fatty 
tissue, lactiferous or milk-carrying ducts, and 
sinus cavities, which carry milk to the open-
ing or nipple. The breast nipple is called the 
mammary papilla, and the dark pigmented area 
around the nipple is the areola. 
During a pregnancy, hormones from the ova-
ries and placenta stimulate gland tissue in the 
breasts to their full development. After parturi-
tion (giving birth), hormones from the pituitary 
gland stimulate milk production in a process 
known as lactation. 
There are two hormones involved in milk 
production: oxytocin and prolactin. These 
hormones also work to assist during labor, 
delivery, and the recovery of the mother. 
Oxytocin stimuates the uterus to contract, 
inducing parturition. Following delivery, oxyto-
cin helps contract the uterus back to its normal 
size. It also reacts on the breasts to stimulate 
the release of milk. Prolactin stimulates breast 
development and the formation of milk in the 
postpartum period. The act of sucking pro-
motes prolactin production, which in turn, 
promotes further milk production.

Female Reproductive Root Words
So, for lack of a better metaphor, prefixes and suffixes combined with root 
words are kind of like ova and sperm. Separately, they don’t make much 
sense. But together, they produce a whole new being. In this case, of course, 
it’s a word and not a baby. But they are cute, aren’t they?

Full circle: The mysteries of the 28-day 
menstrual cycle revealed
What actually happens on a monthly basis once 
menstruation begins?
At puberty the beginning of menstruation is 
called menarche, which can begin as early as 
age nine or as late as 15–16. Every menstrual 
cycle is divided into approximately 28 days (give 
or take, depending on your body’s makeup) that 
can be grouped into four time periods:
 ✓ Days 1–5, menstrual period: Bloody fluid 
containing disintegrated endometrial cells 
and blood cells is discharged through the 
vagina.
 ✓ Days 6–13, postmenstrual period: When 
the menstrual period has ended, the lining 
of the uterus begins to repair itself as the 
hormone estrogen is released by the matur-
ing graafian follicle (developing egg sac). 
 ✓ Days 13–14, ovulation: The graafian follicle 
ruptures, and the ovum leaves the ovary 
and is pulled into the fallopian tube.
 ✓ Days 15–28, premenstrual period: The empty 
graafian follicle fills with a yellow material 
and becomes known as a corpus luteum. 
The corpus luteum acts like an endo-
crine organ and secretes two hormones, 
estrogen and progesterone, into the blood-
stream. The hormones stimulate buildup of 
the lining of the uterus in preparation for a 
fertilized ovum. If fertilization does not occur, 
the corpus luteum stops hormone production 
and regresses. The fall in hormonal levels 
leads to the breakdown of the uterine endo-
metrium, and a new menstrual cycle begins, 
bringing the cycle back to day 1.
If fertilization does occur in the fallopian tube, 
the fertilized ovum moves into the uterus and 
implants in the endometrium. The corpus 
luteum continues to produce progesterone 
and estrogen, which supports the vascular and 
muscular development of the uterus lining. The 
placenta, the organ of communication between 
the mother and the embryo, now forms in the 
uterine wall. The placenta produces its own 
hormone as it develops in the uterus, called 
human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG). HCG is 
the hormone tested for in the urine of women 
who suspect a pregnancy. When you pee on a 
pregnancy test stick, this is the hormone that 
makes that little plus sign appear. If you see it, 
pour yourself a champagne glass full of milk 
and celebrate — you’re pregnant!

Common Female Reproductive Conditions
There’s more to the female reproductive system than making babies. With all 
that equipment, there’s bound to be a fair share of technical difficulties rang-

hormones due to menopause):
 
✓ Amenorrhea: Absence of menstrual period
 
✓ Cervicitis: Inflammation of the cervix
 
✓ Dysmenorrhea: Painful menstrual periods
 
✓ Dyspareunia: Painful or difficult intercourse

Finding the Culprit: Female Reproductive 
Diseases and Pathology 
It’s important to note that the following conditions not only influence the 
work of the body, but also the overall mental health of the women they affect. 
As with the male reproductive system, a woman’s mental and sexual health 
are intricately interwoven with physical health. For many women, issues 
involving reproductive health often have long-lasting effects on feminine and 
sexual identity. This is especially true if it affects a woman’s ability to con-
ceive or involves loss of reproductive organs, so these diseases and patho-
logical conditions should be addressed with the utmost care and sensitivity. 
 
✓ Adenomyosis refers to endometrium growth in the myometrium of the 
uterus.
 
✓ Breast carcinoma is a malignant tumor of the breast. Tumors may 
spread to skin, chest wall, and lymph nodes located in axilla; they 
may metastasize (spread) to other parts of the body including bones, 
lungs, liver, brain, and even ovaries. Breast carcinoma can be treated 
in a variety of ways, including lumpectomy (removal of cancerous lump 
only), removal of breast tissue but preserving skin and nipple for future 
reconstruction (subcutaneous mastectomy), removal of the entire breast 
(a simple or total mastectomy), or removal of breast, lymph nodes, and 
adjacent chest wall muscle in a single procedure (radical mastectomy).
 
✓ Carcinoma of cervix means malignant tumor of the cervix. Papanicolaou 
(Pap) smear detects early cervical neoplasia by microscopic examination 
of cells scraped from cervical epithelium.
 
✓ Endometrial carcinoma refers to malignant tumor of the uterus. 
 
✓ Endometriosis involves endometrial tissue in an abnormal location, 
such as the ovaries or intestine, associated with dysmenorrhea, pelvic 
pain, and infertility. 
 
✓ Fibrocystic disease is a disease of the breast. It is a benign condition 
involving one or more tumors of the breast.
 
✓ Fibroid (leiomyoma) is a benign tumor in the uterus composed of 
fibrous tissue and muscle, may cause pelvic pain or menorrhagia. 
 
✓ Ovarian cyst is collections of fluid within a sac or cyst in the ovary.
 
✓ Ovarian carcinoma means malignant tumor of the ovary (adenocarci-
noma). It may be cystic or solid.
 
✓ PID (pelvic inflammatory disease) refers to inflammation of female 
pelvic organs.

316

✓ Prolapsed uterus involves displacement of uterus down into the vagina.
 
✓ Stein-Leventhal syndrome (polycystic ovary syndrome) refers to adre-
nal gland malfunction resulting in facial hair (hirsutism), weight gain, and 
infrequent, abnormal, or absent menstrual periods.
 
✓ TSS (toxic shock syndrome) is a severe illness caused by bacterial 
infection, most often seen in menstruating women using tampons. 
Staphylococcus aureus is the bacterial culprit.
 
✓ Vesicovaginal fistula is when there is an opening between vagina and 
urinary bladder.
Testing, Testing: Female Reproductive 
Radiology and Diagnostic Tests
Thank goodness for modern medicine. It certainly helps ease the mind of 
many a woman by providing answers to the most pressing female reproduc-
tive questions. Most women will be familiar with some of these yearly (or 
more often for some) tests that, although causing a bit of discomfort at the 
time, give great comfort in the long run by offering diagnoses for many seri-
ous conditions.
 
✓ Hysterosalpingogram: X-ray taken of the uterus and fallopian tubes after 
a dye is introduced in the uterus to see if it can move freely through the 
fallopian tubes and out to the ovaries; used to diagnose blockages in 
tubes that might lead to infertility 
 
✓ Papanicolaou (Pap) smear: Sample of cells of cervix are harvested and 
examined under microscopic analysis; the presence of cervical or vagi-
nal carcinoma can be detected
 
✓ Pregnancy test: Detects the presence of HCG in the urine or blood to 
diagnose pregnancy
 
✓ Mammogram: X-ray film of the breast
 
✓ Sonohysterography: Recording uterus by sound waves (ultrasound)
Paging Dr. Terminology: Female 
Reproductive Surgeries and Procedures
Now that you’re in tune with the working parts and possible issues involved 
with the female reproductive system, it’s time to find out more about the 

317
 Chapter 23: A Life Force: The Female Reproductive System
things your physician can do to fix the feminine plumbing, so to speak. 
Obviously, many of these surgeries and procedures involve a woman’s ability 
to conceive, whether it be putting an end to that ability through a hysterec-
tomy or helping improve a woman’s chances to get pregnant. First, let’s talk 
about some general procedures.
 
✓ Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy before the embryo or the 
fetus is able to exist on its own. A spontaneous abortion may occur in a 
pregnancy up to and including 12 weeks, and is also known as a miscar-
riage. A therapeutic or induced abortion is a deliberate termination of 
pregnancy and is most commonly performed during the first trimester 
between 8 and 12 weeks. 
 
✓ Cervical conization is a cone-shaped biopsy of tissue from the mouth of 
cervix for diagnostic purposes. This procedure often follows an abnormal 
Pap smear.
 
✓ Cryosurgery: This refers to the use of cold or freezing temperature to 
destroy tissue, usually produced by a probe containing liquid nitrogen.
 
✓ D & C means dilatation and curettage. First, the dilatation (widening of 
the cervical opening) is accomplished. Curettage (scraping) is accom-
plished next by using a curette or metal loop to remove samples of the 
lining of the uterus for diagnostic purposes. Also performed to remove 
products of conception after an incomplete miscarriage or to reduce 
uterine bleeding. 
 
✓ Hysteroscopy is visual examination of the uterus performed with a 
hysteroscope.
Many women opt for a permanent form of sterilization once they make 
the decision to not have more (or any) children. The procedures are very 
common, and each has its own set of pros and cons. Women are typically 
encouraged to choose the sterilization method best for their individual life-
styles and physical makeup. A very common sterilization method is tubal 
ligation, a procedure that involves cutting or interrupting and ligating (tying 
off) fallopian tubes to prevent passage of ovum. This procedure can be done 
laparoscopically or through an abdominal incision:
 
✓ Laparoscopic method: Laparoscope is inserted through the abdominal 
wall, and tubes can be sealed off with high-frequency spark (cauterization) 
or burning. 
 
✓ Tubal banding: A band is wrapped around a section of each tube and 
tissue becomes necrotic (dies), providing a break between the two 
portions of tube.
 
✓ Tubal clipping: Filshie clip is used to clip off tubes, similar to banding 
method. 

318
Par t V: Name That Plumbing 
 
Laparoscopic tubal ligations were done in the 1970s, and the first laparoscopic 
cholecystectomy was performed in 1989.
Many surgical procedures for the female reproductive system require the 
repair or removal of some parts of the system. In the most serious cases 
(often involving cancer), the entire uterus and surrounding cervix are 
completely removed. Keep in mind that breasts are considered part of this 
system as well, so in the following list you’ll see terms referring to the surgi-
cal removal or repair of these body parts as well. 
 
✓ Abdominal hysterectomy: Surgical removal of the uterus through the 
abdomen
 
✓ Bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy: Surgical removal of both tubes and 
both ovaries
Having fun with hormones: Beginning to end 
and birth control in between
Menstruation and pregnancy not only depend 
on the hormones produced in the ovaries, but 
also on hormones secreted from the pituitary 
gland. Follicle-stimulating hormones (FSH) and 
luteinizing hormones (LH) help stimulate the 
development of the ovum and ovulation. After 
ovulation, LH influences the maintenance of the 
corpus luteum and its production of estrogen 
and progesterone.
During pregnancy the higher levels of estro-
gen and progesterone affect the pituitary 
gland itself, by shedding off its production of 
FSH and LH. When a woman is pregnant then, 
new ova do not mature, and ovulation cannot 
occur. This interaction, when hormones act 
to shut off the production of another group of 
hormones, is called negative feedback. This is 
the principle behind the action of birth control 
pills on the body. The birth control pill contains 
varying amounts of estrogen and progesterone, 
causing the hormone levels to rise in the blood. 
Negative feedback occurs, and the pituitary 
does not release FSH and LH. Ovulation cannot 
occur without these, and a woman cannot 
become pregnant.
Other female contraceptive measures include 
the IUD (intrauterine device) and the diaphragm. 
The IUD is a small coil placed inside the uterus 
by a physician. Its presence in the uterus (for-
eign body) irritates the uterine lining to prevent 
implantation of a fertilized ovum. A diaphragm is 
a rubber cup-shaped device inserted over the 
outside of the cervix before intercourse to pre-
vent sperm from entering the cervix and moving 
into the uterus to the fallopian tubes.
The finale of this ongoing cycle occurs when 
the secretion of estrogen from the ovaries less-
ens, fewer eggs are produced, and menopause 
begins. Menopause is the gradual ending of 
the menstrual cycle and the natural process 
resulting from normal aging of the ovaries. 
Other names for menopause are “change of 
life” and “climacteric.” Premature menopause 
can occur before age 35, whereas delayed 
menopause can occur after age 55. Artificial 
menopause occurs if the ovaries are removed 
surgically or made nonfunctional by radiation 
therapy. Menopause is considered complete 
when menstrual periods have been absent for 
at least 12 months.

✓ Colpopexy: Surgical fixation of the vagina to surrounding structures
 
✓ Combination special (total hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-
oophorectomy): Removal of uterus, cervix, both tubes, and ovaries; 
commonly referred to as TAH-BSO (Total Abdominal Hysterectomy with 
Bilateral Salpingo-Oophorectomy)
 
✓ Hymenectomy: Surgical removal of the hymen
 
✓ Hysteropexy: Surgical fixation of a misplaced or abnormally mobile uterus
 
✓ Laparoscopic hysterectomy: Surgical removal of the uterus using a lap-
aroscope
 
✓ Lumpectomy: Removal of cancerous lump only in the breast; subcu-
taneous mastectomy is removal of breast tissue that preserves skin 
and nipple for future reconstruction; simple or total mastectomy may 
involve removal of the entire breast; in a radical mastectomy, the breast 
is removed, along with the lymph nodes and adjacent chest wall muscle 
in a single procedure
 
✓ Mastectomy: Surgical removal of a breast
 
✓ Oophorectomy: Surgical removal of an ovary
 
✓ Salpingectomy: Surgical removal of a fallopian tube
 
✓ Salpingo-oophorectomy (or oophoro-salpingectomy): Removal of fallo-
pian tube and ovary
 
✓ Subtotal hysterectomy: Surgical removal of uterus only (cervix left 
behind)
 
✓ Total hysterectomy: Surgical removal of uterus and cervix
 
✓ Vaginal hysterectomy: Uterus and cervix are surgically removed via vagina
 
✓ Vaginoplasty: Surgical repair of the vagina
 
✓ Vulvectomy: Surgical removal of the vulva
Of course, because creating life and giving birth are two huge jobs of this 
system, you would be remiss to miss these obstetrical terms:
 
✓ Amniotomy: Incision into the amnion to induce labor. It’s also referred 
to as artificial rupture of membranes.
 
✓ Cesarean section: This is surgical removal of the fetus through the 
abdominal and uterine walls. A C-section may be performed for a breech 
presentation (baby’s head is not in downward position), multiple births, 
placenta previa (placenta develops in the lower uterine wall and may 
cover the cervix, blocking the birth canal), abruptio placentae (premature 
separation of placenta from uterine wall), cephalopelvic disproportion 
(when a baby’s head or body is too large to fit through the mother’s 
pelvis), failure to progress in labor, or any sign that the fetus is in distress.

Par t V: Name That Plumbing 
 
✓ Episiotomy: Refers to incision of vulva or perineum. This is done during 
delivery to prevent tearing of the perineum.
 
✓ Amniocentesis: This involves surgical puncture to aspirate amniotic 
fluid via insertion of needle through the abdominal and uterine walls 
using ultrasound guidance. Fluid is used for the assessment of fetal 
health and maturity. This procedure is used to aid in diagnosis of fetal 
abnormalities. It is performed early in pregnancy at 16 weeks to deter-
mine fetal abnormalities such as Down syndrome, spina bifida, or to 
determine the sex of the fetus. It is done late in the pregnancy to deter-
mine lung maturity of the fetus.
 
✓ Pelvimetry: The measurement of the mother’s pelvic to determine abil-
ity of fetus to pass through.
 
✓ Obstetrical ultrasound: Ultrasound of the abdomen and pelvis 
determine fetal development, growth rate, and estimate fetal age, 
weight, and maturity.
 
✓ Salpingectomy: Removal of a fallopian tube in order to remove an 
ectopic pregnancy.
Terminology RX: Female Reproductive 
Pharmacology
And now for a brief word about our friends, the drugs. Many women hoping 
to have children who are experiencing difficulties are very thankful to have 
drugs to treat fertility, such as clomiphene citrate. These little wonders work 
by stimulating the pituitary gland to release LH and FSH, thus increasing 
the body’s ability to conceive. Though these drugs are not panaceas, they 
have helped countless women reach their goals of becoming mothers. On 
the other end of the conception spectrum, some babies want to make their 
appearance too early. In these cases, uterine relaxants are used to stop pre-
mature labor in pregnancy.
Analgesics are painkillers used to treat menstrual cramps and painful periods. 
Then there are the “antis.” Antifungal drugs are used to treat vaginal yeast 
infections, whereas anti-inflammatories and antibiotics are used to treat some 
sexually transmitted diseases. (For more information about STDs that affect 
both woman and men, see Chapter 22.)

▶ Access the most widely used terminology references
▶ Find the type of reference that works best for your lifestyle
O
h, you know you want more. Medical terminology references, that is. 
What did you think we meant? Whether you are drawn to the stacks at 
your local library or prefer the click of the computer keyboard, here are ten 
terminology references that you can’t live without. 
Medterms.com
A subset site of MedicineNet.com, this medical reference includes over 16,000 
terms. Via a simple search engine, the site can look for words of similar spell-
ing and incorrect spelling — which is a boon for those of us who never won 
a spelling bee. The site also offers a word of the day and earns its street cred 
by the fact that its doctors authored the latest edition of the Webster’s New 
World Medical Dictionary.
Medilexicon.com
This Web site is a good all-arounder, featuring a fully searchable list of medi-
cal abbreviations and a medical dictionary. It’s a searchapalooza, offering 
search functions for drugs, medical instruments, and ICD-9 codes (codes 
used for medical charting and billing).

friend. Not only does this dictionary have all of the terms you need to know, 
it offers full illustrations to help get the point across. And, it’s available both 
online at www.dorlands.com and in hardcopy format.
Mosby’s Medical Dictionary
This monster is well over 2,000 pages chocked full of medical terminology 
know-how. It includes a thumb-indexed dictionary and tons of illustrations to 
help you visualize the terms as actual body parts. Not exactly something you 
want to carry around in your book bag, but definitely handy to keep on your 
bookshelf. Plus, it makes a great doorstop or paperweight. Mosby’s is famous 
for the number of colored pictures, which tends to be helpful for the novice 
medical terminology student.

petitors, Taber’s offers not only the print version of its dictionary, but also a 
Web component and terms sent directly to your PDA or wireless handheld 
device. Taber’s other vital stats include: 700 full-color images, 2500 audio pro-
nunciations, customized bookmarking, “sounds like” search, and topic cross-
linking. So, if you’re checking out one particular part of a system, Taber’s will 
point you in the direction of related information. That’s a nice little bit of 
handholding.
Medicalmnemonics.com
This is a cool and fun Web site. If you need a little boost to help you remem-
ber words and terms, chances are you already use mnemonic devices. You 
know, like “I before E, except after C, or when sounding like A as in neighbor 
and weigh.”
Mnemonics are often simple little phrases to help you recall what it is you’re 
trying to learn and put on paper, into speech, or fill in on a standardized test. 
This is a whole Web site dedicated to the concept. Working much like a wiki, 
you can add your own devices to the database and help others. You can search 
the database (of course) or browse by systems and charts. You can even cus-
tomize to fit your needs or set the site up to download to your phone or PDA. 
The coolest part is: It’s totally free and not-for-profit. So thank your fellow 
medheads for sharing the love, and remember to share some yourself by 
adding your own useful mnemonics.

Ten or So Useful 
Mnemonic Devices
In This Chapter
▶ Using simple phrasing devices to remember medical terms.
▶ Discovering quick ways to recall simple system functions.
A
 mnemonic device is any kind of simple way to remember something, 
such as lists of terms, functions, or definitions. They are usually kind of 
silly, which makes them stand out in your mind. In this chapter we’ve com-
piled eleven great useful devices from one of our favorite Web sites, www.
medicalmnemonics.com (see Chapter 24 for more info on this cool site).
Cranial Nerves
Don’t strain your cranium to recall those cranial nerves. Just remember: “On 
Old Olympus Towering Top, A Finn And German Viewed Some Hops” to recall 
these nerves: olfactory, optic, oculomotor, trochlear, trigeminal, abducens, 
facial, auditory-vestibular, glossopharyngeal, vagus, spinal accessory, and 
hypoglossal.
Lung Lobe Numbers
To remember the location of the different sides of the lungs, think tri and bi. 
The tri-lobed lung lives on the right side, along with the tricuspid heart valve. 
The bicuspid and bi-lobed lung live on the left side of your body.

The Size of a Thyroid
Ever play that game where you look at the clouds and try to figure out what 
they look like? Well, you can do the same with the thyroid, which looks a 
little bit like a bra. To remember the size of the thyroid, just remember that 
breasts are bigger in women than men, so the thyroid is bigger in women. 
Even more, pregnant women have the largest breasts, and they also have the 
largest thyroids.
Scalp Layers
The layers of your scalp actually spell SCALP. Remember this easy formula:
Skin
Connective tissue
Aponeurosis
Loose Connective Tissue
Pericranium
SCALP!
Muscles of the Rotator Cuff
Rotator cuff injuries can be debilitating, especially for an athlete. You can 
remember the muscles of the rotator cuff by remembering SITS. These mus-
cles are (clockwise from top): Supraspinatus, Infraspinatus, Teres minor, and 
Subscapularis.
Note: If a baseball pitcher injures these muscles, he SITS out for the rest of 
the game.
Radial Nerve
The muscles supplied by the radial nerve are the BEST! Remember:

Face Nerves
You can recall what the major face muscles do by matching the action to the 
name. Think M and Facial. The mandibular nerve is in charge of mastication. 
The facial nerve is in charge of facial expression.
Perineal versus Peroneal
Can’t keep these two words straight? Just remember that perINeal is in 
between the legs. PerONeal is on the legs.

Ten Fun Word-Building Activities
In This Chapter
▶ Creating some fun alternatives to memorization
▶ Finding the activity that best helps you remember important terms
L
et’s face it: Memorizing lists of medical terms is probably not the most 
fun activity you’ll ever do. Are there ways to spice it up? As it turns out, 
there are. And here is where we share them with you.
Word Grouping
One of these things is quite like the other. Okay, that’s not how the song goes, 
but it serves your purposes if you remember terms best by grouping them into 
similar categories. Many times, it helps you remember if you think about terms 
in relation to similar terms. You can group words and terms by
 
✓ System
 
✓ Function
 
✓ Sound
 
✓ Prefixes or Suffixes
 
✓ Common roots
 
✓ Word type (such body part, condition, disease, procedure, or 
pharmacology)
The possibilities are endless, so spend some time thinking about what works 
best for you.

Using Medical Word Parts You 
Already Know to Build Words 
Have a great sense of recall? Latch your brain onto some word parts that 
make natural sense to you and then start building words. Some prefixes, 
for example, are pretty self-explanatory. Cardio is for heart. Gyne/o is for 
all things femininely reproductive. So use what comes naturally to learn the 
related words.
Here’s one method:
 
1. Start by listing the word parts you already know through everyday use, 
even what you know from television programs. Just make sure they are 
correct!
 
2. Create a worksheet for each word part you know. You can do this in a 
notebook, in a word-processing program, or — even more efficiently — 
in a spreadsheet format.
 
3. Build some words! Just go freeform at this point and add all the related 
words you know.
 
4. Once you’ve got the lists started, you can start researching more words 
derived from that root, prefix, or suffix. By the time you’re ready to 
study, you’ll have a mega database of words.
Matching the Word Part to the Definition
A similar activity involves matching the word part, whether it be prefix, suffix, 
or root, to its definition. This is probably the most standard form of memoriza-
tion, but it works. If you can learn those individual word parts, you can create 
darn near any medical term. Here is one low-tech, useful way to do this:
Create two sets of flashcards — one with the word part and one with the 
corresponding definition. Then work to match them up. How do you know 
if you’re right? Cut each card in half in a distinctive way so that it will fit 
together with its partner. If it fits, you’ve done it!
Crosswords
Are you one of those people who spend Sunday mornings knee-deep in news-
papers, working the jumble or crossword? Consider yourself a master word 

333

builder? Well, this fun and mentally challenging activity isn’t just a great way 
to kill a few hours, it’s a terrific way to remember words and their definitions. 
You can either create your own crossword or look to other resources to find 
them. To create your own, check out DIY sites like the following:
 
✓ www.crosswordpuzzlegames.com
 
✓ www.armoredpenguin.com/crossword/
 
✓ www.edhelper.com/crossword.htm

resources:
 
✓ www.studystack.com
 
✓ www.medword.com
Also check out medical institution Web sites. Many programs offer word-
building games and puzzles to both students and visitors.
Flashcards
There are tons of great flashcard products on the market (see Chapter 25 for 
some of the most common), or you can go old school and make your own. All 
you need is cheapo packet of index cards and a marker and you’re in busi-
ness. You can do them by definition, system, function, or word part. 
Name That System
If you can name a function, you can name a system. Set up this activity with 
some friends and margaritas, and you have a full night of fun. This activity 
can be done in a variety of ways, from basic Q&A to a Jeopardy-like format. 
You can incorporate some quick and easy flashcards with this as well. A simi-
lar activity is to rattle off a bunch of terms and name the system associated 
with them, or do the exact opposite.

Medical Hangman
You remember killing time playing hangman, don’t you? This is exactly the 
same activity, but with medical terms. And maybe the little man drawing isn’t 
hanging, but instead is lying on the operating table. Here are a few sites that 
provide medical hangman games:
 
✓ www.quia.com
 
✓ www.studystack.com
 
✓ www.cssolutions.biz
Word Search
Create a word search out of terms you need to know. There are several 
computer programs that offer word search creation tools, and many are free 
online. Set up a search using any terms you need to know. This activity works 
best if you use words that are unfamiliar or hard to remember. Where’s the 
challenge in finding words you know well? Stretch yourself and see what hap-
pens. Try these sites:
 
✓ www.edhelper.com
 
✓ www.armoredpenguin.com/wordsearch/
 
✓ http://teachers.teach-nology.com/web_tools/word_search/

searches:
 
✓ www.mwsearch.com
 
✓ www.world-english.org/wordsearchmedical.htm
 
✓ www.medword.com
 
✓ www.medtrng.com/quia.htm
Combining Forms
Our good buddies, the combining forms (root words), are back. You can 
create customized lists of combining forms along with their definitions, mix 
and match, or get a roommate or significant other to quiz you (or simply quiz 
yourself) on meanings.

Jumble
A completely maddening, time-consuming, and highly useful word-building 
activity is the word jumble. This is exactly what it sounds like. Words are 
jumbled, letters are mixed up, and it’s your duty to create a real word from 
the mess. For example, can you make sense out of etrvidluiucsiti? It’s good old 
diverticulitis in disguise! Word jumbles are incredibly useful if you have issues 
with spelling and work beautifully with very long words. Jumble.com and 
wordjumble.com are two of the most popular sites.

Prefixes and Suffixes
In This Chapter
▶ Kicking things off with prefixes
▶ Closing things out with suffixes
N
eed a quick fix? Here is a grand list of the major prefixes and suffixes 
we cover in the book, all alphabetized and ready to be studied. Many 
of these can be applied to more than one body system.
Quickly, before you dive into the prefixes and suffixes you’ve come to know 
and love, think about what each word part does and why it does it. Prefixes 
and suffixes are modifiers or adjectives that alter the meaning of the root 
word, in the same ways as regular English terms.
The beginning, the alpha, the jumping-off point is the prefix. The prefix tells 
you something about what you are going to find inside the word itself. A 
prefix appears at the beginning of a word and tells the how, why, where, 
when, how much, how many, position, direction, time, or status.
You might recognize many of the prefixes associated with medical terminol-
ogy, because they have similar meanings in regular, everyday vernacular. For 
example, the most basic prefix of a- means without, or not, in medical termi-
nology, just as it does in any other word. If something is atypical, for example, 
it is not typical. Hemi- means half, as in hemisphere. The moral of this story 
is that prefixes aren’t just window dressing. They have a unique and specific 
goal, which is to tell you more about the circumstances surrounding the 
word’s meaning.

Suffixes
Next we have the omega, the last call of the word scene — the suffix. The 
suffix, always at the end of a word, usually indicates a procedure, a condi-
tion, or a disease. Whereas the prefix gives us a clue into what to expect in 
a word’s meaning, the suffix pulls no punches and tells us what is happen-
ing with a specific body part or system. And usually it either entails what is 
wrong medically or indicates the procedure used to diagnose or fix it. 
Suffixes operate in the medical world much as they do in the land of stan-
dard English. Like prefixes, many of these have similar meanings in plain old, 
everyday English that you hear on the street. For example, the suffix -meter 
simply indicates an instrument used to measure something, just as it does in 
English (like odometer). Geography, a term feared by many fifth graders the 
world over, ends with -graphy and means, more or less, “picturing lands.”
