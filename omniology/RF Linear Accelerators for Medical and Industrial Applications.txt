Introduction
1.1  Overview of Role of Accelerators in Our Lives
When I mention the words particle accelerators to my friends and family, they 
immediately think of high-energy physics experiments with their extremely 
large machines in national laboratories and research universities. This is not 
surprising since these accelerators were originally developed for use in “split-
ting the atom” experiments at the beginning of the last century. It was through 
these pioneering experiments that we were able to learn about the constitu-
ents of the atom. As accelerator technology evolved, we were able to find out 
more about the basic building blocks of matter and about nature’s fundamental 
forces. Nowadays, a high-energy research particle accelerator can speed up a 
beam of charged particles to near the speed of light before they collide with a 
target or with another beam of particles. The sub-nucleus particles created by 
the collision as well as the radiation emitted are detected and analyzed. Some 
of these machines accelerate particles in a straight line, and we call them linear 
accelerators, or linacs for short. Other high-energy machines are based on rotat-
ing the accelerated particles in a circular path, such as the cyclotrons and the 
synchrotrons. Actually, one can say that the story of accelerator development 
goes in step with the progress of high-energy physics. However, along the way, 
engineers, chemists, and medical physicists have found a number of practical 
applications using this fascinating technology of particle accelerators.

RF Linear Accelerators for Medical and Industrial Applications  
In fact, the number of accelerators for science experiments (a few hun-
dred) is much smaller than the number of accelerators used commercially to 
improve and sustain our quality of life. More than 97% of all accelerators are 
used in commercial applications. There are about 30,000 commercial accelera-
tors quietly running in hospitals, chemical factories, and manufacturing facili-
ties. They impact our lives in many ways. Over the last half century, accelerators 
have worked behind the scenes to cure thousands of cancer patients around 
the world, produce isotopes for medical imaging and nuclear medicine, steril-
ize medical paraphernalia and food products, test hidden pipes and structures 
for defects and cracks nondestructively, secure our borders, cut and weld steel 
beams, process semiconductor chips for computers, modify the characteristics 
of polymers, locate oil and minerals in the earth, and help archaeologists deter-
mine the age of ancient artifacts. The current annual global sales of these com-
mercial accelerators are estimated in the billions of dollars.
In this book, we will try to shed light on some of the important applica-
tions of RF linear accelerators (linacs), such as the medical applications (Chap-
ter 5) and industrial applications (Chapter 6). In addition to explaining the 
underlying concepts behind the operation of linacs (Chapter 2), we describe 
the RF system needed to run them (Chapter 3) and how they are manufactured 
(Chapter 4). The focus of the book is linacs, however we will mention briefly 
electrostatic accelerators that are also linear devices. Nevertheless, the word lin-
ac is reserved for RF linear accelerators. We will also briefly review some of the 
circular accelerators and sample some of their applications. The brief coverage 
in this chapter of the electrostatic and circular accelerators will help us to have a 
better understanding of the industrial and scientific applications of accelerators 
in the last three chapters of this book.
In this introductory chapter we will very briefly look at the history of 
accelerating development with their different types (Section 1.2). We will high-
light one of the major medical applications of accelerators, namely cancer radia-
tion therapy (Section 1.3). In the last section of this chapter we list some of the 
industrial applications of accelerators.
1.2  A Glance at the History of Accelerator Development
The driving force behind the development of accelerators has been directly 
tied to the advancement of high-energy physics research [1–3]. In 1919, Ernest 
Rutherford, a renowned physicist, successfully induced nuclear reactions using 
natural radioactive materials. This groundbreaking work motivated scientists 
to develop devices that would eventually accelerate particles to voltages higher 
than those obtained from radioactive materials and would allow for careful and 
controlled study of the atom nucleus. Accelerator development continued for

nine more decades. In this section, we will briefly highlight the significant mile-
stones of this development. Following the path that accelerator development 
took, we find that most of the early development approaches focused on the 
simpler concept of using a dc voltage to provide the electric field required for 
accelerating the charged particles. This is the electrostatic approach that result-
ed in today’s electrostatic accelerators. On the other hand, time-varying voltages 
were proposed almost at the same time, though not realized right away, and 
eventually they resulted in two groups of accelerators. The first is the group of 
circular accelerators, namely the cyclotron, the betatron, and the synchrotron. The 
second is the RF linear accelerator, which is the focus of this book. We map the 
course of early accelerator development in Figure 1.1.

1.2.1  Development of Electrostatic Accelerators
In 1932, two of Ernest Rutherford’s students, John D. Cockcroft and Ernest T. 
S. Walton, designed and built an electrostatic accelerator at the Cavendish in 
Cambridge [1, 2]. They built a voltage multiplier consisting of a set of capaci-
tors connected to rectifying diodes acting as switches. By opening and closing 
these switches in a certain sequence, they could achieve a potential of 400 kV 
from their 200-kV transformer. With this device they were able to accelerate 
protons down a vacuum tube eight feet long towards a lithium target. This was 
sufficient to disintegrate the nuclei of the lithium atom. 
The original Cockcroft-Walton accelerator is now kept in the Science 
Museum in London and shown schematically in Figure 1.2 (from [2], with 
modifications).
Most of high-energy electrostatic accelerators that we know today are 
based on the invention of Robert James Van de Graff and thus is known now as 
the Van de Graff generator [4]. The concept behind this accelerator is depicted 
in Figure 1.3. His idea was to build a machine that would transport charges 
mechanically. The charges are then delivered to an upper terminal where they 
accumulate. The buildup of charges translates to a buildup of voltage on that 
terminal, which has the shape of a sphere. This shape allows for maximum 
buildup of charges without creating sparks. The resulting built-up voltage is 
then used to accelerate particles from that high voltage to ground potential 
across an evacuated accelerating channel.

Ray Herb [5] added three key improvements to this machine. First, he 
replaced the vacuum with pressurized gas that would stand higher voltages. Sec-
ond, he changed the belt carrying the charges from a continuous smooth belt 
to one with steel cylinders held apart by nylon insulating links in the form of a 
chain. A third contribution was to put conducting rings along the accelerating 
channel, which helped in shaping the accelerating field more precisely. These 
improvements allowed the Van de Graff electrostatic accelerator lend itself to 
more practical and commercial applications, such as ion implantation of semi-
conductor wafers as discussed in Chapter 6.
Electrostatic accelerators are limited in the maximum energy they can 
deliver to a charged particle. This final energy is basically the product of the 
charge times the dc potential difference that can be maintained. In practice this 
potential difference is limited by electric breakdown to no more than a few tens 
of megavolts. Time-varying accelerators circumvent this limitation, as we will 
see below, in both circular and RF linear accelerators.

RF Linear Accelerators for Medical and Industrial Applications  
1.2.2  Development of Circular Accelerators
Ernest Lawrence invented the first circular accelerator, the cyclotron [6]. He 
relied on the fact that a moving charge bends in a curved trajectory under the 
effect of a dc magnetic field applied normally to the plane of motion of the 
charged particle beam. An RF driving voltage is applied across a gap between 
two D-shaped half cylinders as shown in Figure 1.4. As the charged particles 
gain energy every time they cross the gap between the “Dees,” they spiral out-
wards in an increasing radius. The two effects—of increase in radius and the 
gain in energy (speed)—compensate for each other, and thus the time for each 
revolution stays constant. If the applied magnetic field is chosen correctly, the 
particle circulation frequency will be in synchronism with the RF oscillating 
field across the gap.
The operation can be described in a few simple equations as follows. 
Recalling that a particle of mass m traveling in a circular orbit of radius r 
with velocity v will be subject to a centrifugal force F given by 
	
=

mv r 	
(1.1)
Now, in the presence of a magnetic field B perpendicular to the plane of 
motion of the particle with charge q and moving with velocity v, the particle 
would experience a compensating force toward the center of the circle of revo-
lution of

By equating the above two equations, we see that
	
ω =

(1.3)
From (1.3), we get the important notion that for a particle of charge q 
and mass m in a field B perpendicular the plane of motion of the particle, the 
frequency of rotation ω is independent of the radius of the orbit r.
From the beginning, it was clear that the cyclotron would not be suitable 
for accelerating electrons that would move at a speed close to that of light once 
they reach energies close to a million volts of acceleration and therefore loose 
synchronism with the accelerating voltage. This was not the case for another 
circular accelerator, the betatron, which Donald Krest developed in 1940 [7]. 
The basic concept of its operation is depicted in Figure 1.5.
A basic relation between a time-varying magnetic field and the resulting 
electric field is Faraday’s law. The simplest manifestation of this law is the ob-
servation that changes in the magnetic environment of a loop of wire will cause 
a voltage to be “induced” in the loop. In the configuration shown in Figure 1.5 
[2], as the magnetic field Bz changes, an orbiting electron (analogous to a cur-
rent in a loop of wire) experiences an “induced” azimuthal tangential electric 
field Es, which drives the electron to higher and higher energy. Actually, the 
concept of operation of the betatron is analogous to the electrical transformer, 
both of which are based on Faraday’s law. In the betatron, the primary part of 
the transformer is the electromagnet providing the time-varying magnetic field 
and the secondary part is the orbiting electron. The betatron configuration is 
shown schematically in Figure 1.6 [2].
Figure 1.5  Basic concept of the betatron.

8 
RF Linear Accelerators for Medical and Industrial Applications  
The magnetic field in the betarton does both bending (B-guide) and 
acceleration (B-average) of the particle (usually electrons), provided that the 
bending magnetic field is increasing with time. The increase in the magnetic 
field strength matches the increase in particle energy, so that the orbit radius is 
kept nearly constant, and the induced electric field provides acceleration of the 
particles. The magnet must be carefully designed so that the field strength at 
the orbit radius (B- guide) is equal to half the average field strength (B-average) 
linking the orbit [7].
McMillan [8] and Veksler [9] independently invented the third circular 
accelerator after World War II. In the synchrotron, the particles are constrained 
to circulate in a constant radius in a ring under vacuum. The magnetic guiding 
field increases with the particle energy, so as to keep the orbit at the same radius. 
The accelerating force is supplied by azimuthal tangential electric field provided 
by RF source (cavity); see Figure 1.7. Once the particle beam reaches the tar-
geted energy, the RF fields are there to make up for the beam’s energy loss due 
to radiation from the circulating beam. The radiated energy is based on the fact 
that deflecting electron beams in a magnetic field emits electromagnetic waves. 
This synchrotron radiation was soon put to use for both medical and industrial 
applications. We will discuss the operation of the synchrotron briefly in Chap-
ter 7 when we discuss proton therapy machines for treating cancer and storage 
ring colliders, including the most recent proton synchrotron at the European 
Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) near Geneva, Switzerland—name-
ly, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).
1.2.3  Development of RF Linear Accelerators
In 1924 Gustaf Ising, a Swedish physicist, proposed accelerating charged par-
ticles using alternating electric fields [1, 2]. His proposed accelerator configura-
tion consisted of a straight glass tube under vacuum that housed a sequence of 
metallic tubes with holes for the beam to drift through them, and hence these 
tubes are called “drift tubes” and this accelerator structure is called a drift-tube 
accelerator. The particles are accelerated by the field existing in the gaps between 
the drift tubes, as shown in Figure 1.8. The accelerating field was established by 
Figure 1.6  Schematic for the betatron.

the pulsed voltage applied across adjacent drift tubes and were generated by a 
capacitor discharge at electrode F, in Figure1.8. In order for the applied voltage 
to be synchronized with the particles moving downstream, the transmission

10 
RF Linear Accelerators for Medical and Industrial Applications  
lines a1,a2,a3 were chosen with different lengths to add the proper delay from the 
voltage source to each of the drift tubes.
It is to be noted that although Ising used a series of timed dc pulses, he 
could as well have used an RF (radio frequency) oscillator to provide the voltage 
across successive gaps. A young Norwegian engineering graduate student, Rolf 
Wideröe, who was earning his Ph.D. in Aachen, Germany, in 1927, realized 
this fact. An alternating voltage powered his linear accelerator, and thus he is 
considered the inventor of the world’s first RF linear accelerator (linac). His ac-
celerator propelled potassium ions through an 88-cm-long glass tube, achieving 
an energy gain equivalent to twice the peak voltage he used. The basic concept 
of the Wideröe accelerator is depicted in Figure1.9.
In order for the Wideröe linac to accelerate electrons to velocities close to 
the speed of light, the accelerator had to be either very long, or the wavelength 
of the driving RF voltage had to be short. Thus, practical uses of this type of ac-
celerator had to wait until after World War II to benefit from the advancement 
in microwave sources. Since that time, there have been several variants of accel-
erating structure design, although the underlying principle remains unchanged. 
We will discuss the concept of operation of RF linear accelerators with their 
different design configurations in the next chapter.
In the remaining two sections of this chapter we list some of the applica-
tions of accelerators, including the medical and industrial applications; both are 
discussed in more detail in other chapters of this book.
1.3  Cancer Radiation Therapy
Cancer is a major public health problem in many parts of the world. In the 
United States, cancer is the second leading cause of death (more than half a 
million deaths in 2009 were due to cancer) [10]. Fortunately, cancer death 
rates have been decreasing lately. New advances in the diagnosis, screening,

and treatment of cancer in the last few decades have contributed effectively to 
the discovery and curing of this disease. The most common cancer treatment 
modalities include surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. 
Radiation therapy (RT), also known as radiotherapy, is an effective method 
of treatment for many different forms of cancer using ionizing radiation. About 
half of all cancer patients receive radiation therapy, either alone or in com-
bination with one or two of the above-mentioned treatment modalities. The 
ionizing radiation in this type of cancer treatment is produced from machines 
based on an electron linear accelerator (linac) or from a radioactive material. 
The goal of most radiation therapies is to destroy cancerous tissue. There are 
basically two types of RT, namely, brachytherapy and external radiation therapy. 
Brachytherapy is a type of radiation therapy in which radioactive materials are 
placed close to or inside the patient’s body. External radiation therapy is any 
type of RT in which the radiation source is located at a distance from the pa-
tient’s body. By referring to radiation therapy or RT in the remaining pages of 
the book, we mean the externally applied radiation produced by accelerator-
based machines, since this is the focus of this book. In this medical application, 
more than 10,000 linacs are used around the world. Cancer radiation therapy 
based on linacs will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 5. Radiation therapy 
facilities using protons accelerated by synchrotron accelerators are covered in 
Chapter 7. 
One challenging objective of RT is to maximize the radiation dose to the 
tumor while minimizing the effects of radiation on the surrounding healthy tis-
sue. This is most critical when the tumor’s surroundings include sensitive tissues 
such as eyes, spinal cord, or lungs. Achieving this objective is very dependent 
on the accuracy and precision of the process of dose delivery. In Chapter 5, we 
will discuss the requirement for RT machines and type of linacs used, as well as 
new advances in beam delivery.
1.4  Market for Industrial Accelerators
The size of the market for industrial accelerators more than matches that for 
the radiation therapy discussed briefly above. It is estimated that the number 
of industrial accelerators sold so far is more than18,000, with annual sales ex-
ceeding 900 units. This translates into an annual market of $2 billion [11]. 
Originally, the designs of many of the accelerators used in industrial applica-
tions were developed in research laboratories for physics experiments. However, 
once the technology was proven, these accelerators were put to use for different 
applications. In Chapter 6, we discuss in more detail some of examples of these 
applications. Let us briefly look at some of these applications.

12 
RF Linear Accelerators for Medical and Industrial Applications  
1.4.1  Producing Medical Radioisotopes for Imaging and Nuclear Medicine
Over 10,000 hospitals worldwide use radioisotopes in medicine with about 
90% of the procedures for diagnosis and about 10% for treatments. In the 
United States, there are some 18 million nuclear medicine procedures done per 
year using radioisotopes [12]. The short-lived isotopes are used as radioactive 
tracers that emit gamma rays from within the body, permitting specific physi-
ological processes to be scrutinized to provide information about the function-
ing of a person’s specific organs or to treat certain diseases. It is expected that the 
demand for nuclear medicine procedures using radioisotopes will continue to 
increase, especially in developing countries. Artificially made radioisotopes, in-
cluding those for medical use, are mainly produced by research reactors. Some 
facilities producing isotopes utilize particle accelerators, mostly circular accel-
erators (cyclotrons) and some linear accelerators (linacs).
1.4.2  Electron Beam Sterilization of Medical Disposables and Food Processing
Although electron beam (EB) sterilization processing of medical devices was 
used in the 1950s, it was not widely used until the 1970s, when the accel-
erators used became more efficient and reliable. In this application, accelera-
tors produce high-energy electrons. The high-energy electron beam penetrates 
through the packaging and destroys the DNA chains of the microorganisms, 
thus sterilizing the product in its final packaging. This sterilizing technique is 
the approach of choice for many medical disposable manufacturers, offering the 
lowest cost of sterilization for large capacities.
In many countries, high-energy electron and X-ray beams are used to irra-
diate food. The purpose of radiation preservation of food is to prevent undesir-
able changes in the food during shipment and for longer shelf life. In addition 
to preservation, radiation processing can also provide a means of disinfecting, 
by destroying any pathogens present. 
1.4.3  Nondestructive Testing (NDT)
Standard X-ray tubes have been used for several decades to inspect thin objects 
to detect hidden defects or flaws. However, they are typically effective only for 
the inspection of thin articles. For thick objects, higher energy X-ray beams are 
needed for effective radiographic inspection. For example, a 250 mm–thick of 
steel plate or a 1 meter–thick concrete wall can be inspected with the help of 
high-energy X-ray beams. These are normally produced by electron linacs using 
tungsten targeted to produce X-rays capable of penetrating thick objects.

1.4.4  Ion Implantation in Semiconductor Chip Fabrication
Ion implanters are used in the integrated-circuit manufacturing industry. The 
ion beam implanter function is to alter the near-surface properties of semicon-
ductor materials by implanting dopant ions that change the electrical character-
istic of the semiconductor. A typical ion implanter used in the manufacture of 
electronic devices involves generating and accelerating an ion beam and steering 
it into the semiconductor substrate so that the ions come to rest beneath the 
surface at a specified depth. Among semiconductor-processing techniques, ion 
implantation is nearly unique in that process parameters, such as concentration 
and depth of the desired dopant, are specified directly in the equipment settings 
for controlling the implant dose and energy, respectively. The progress made in 
electrostatic accelerators in the 1960s made the Van de Graff electrostatic ac-
celerator a practical reliable and source of ions for the semiconductor industry 
as discussed in Chapter 6 of this book.
1.4.5  Processing of Polymers
The radiation source for processing polymers may be an electron beam accel-
erator or a radioactive source, such as Cobalt-60. However, EB accelerators 
are more commonly used for commercial radiation modification of polymers. 
Their dose rate is much higher, and they allow more efficient movement of 
the product in front of the radiation source. Thus, it is generally a more cost-
effective way of delivering dose to the product. The energy of the electron beam 
determines its depth of penetration into the product. 
1.4.6  Security and Inspection Applications
In many of the world’s ports we can now find high-energy X-ray linear accelera-
tors. These accelerators can reliably generate the energies required to penetrate 
loaded containers while retaining the sensitivity to discriminate among different 
materials and to provide high quality images for cargo inspection requirements. 
In the last decade multiple countries have started R&D programs at their re-
search centers and universities to develop systems for border security, airline-
cargo inspection, and first response in the investigation of unknown packages.

Linac Basic Concepts and Constituents
In its simplest definition, an RF linear accelerator (linac) is a device that uses 
electromagnetic waves, in the microwave range, to accelerate charged particles 
such as electrons. Some of the medical and industrial applications employ the 
resulting accelerated high-energy particle beams. In many other applications, 
the final useful output of the linac is a beam of high-energy X-rays resulting 
from the collision of the accelerated electron beam with heavy metal target. Fig-
ure 2.1 shows a simplified functional diagram of a linac that receives electrons 
from an electron gun and accelerates them to produce high-energy X-rays. This 
beam is accelerated in a series of accelerating cavities by forces exerted on the 
electrons by the fields of a microwave, which is fed from an external microwave 
source such as a klystron or a magnetron.
We will discuss different types of accelerators used in medical and indus-
trial applications in Chapters 5 and 6, respectively. In this chapter, I will guide 
you in developing an understanding of the fundamental concepts of operation 
of these accelerators. Formal analysis of linacs would require solving Maxwell’s 
equations governing the electromagnetic fields in the linac subjected to their 
boundary conditions. In most cases computer simulation is a must for any de-
sign of a linac. Here, I rely on describing the concepts behind the physics with 
the help of explanatory illustrations and a few basic formulae, as needed. Read-
ers wanting to learn about linacs in more depth can consult one of the accelera-
tors books [1–3].
I begin by using the simplest accelerator arrangements, such as the dc 
two-electrode and the RF single-cavity accelerating configurations, to introduce 
the essential definitions and fundamental concepts we need. Most of the RF lin-
acs can be viewed as a chain of coupled cavities. To understand the underlying 

16 
RF Linear Accelerators for Medical and Industrial Applications 
 
physics of the linac operation, I employ the coupled-circuit model to establish 
many of the linac operational concepts and parameters. Also in this chapter, I 
discuss other linac constituents such as the electron gun and the X-ray target.
2.1  Fundamental Concepts and Definitions
Let us begin first by reviewing some of the simple concepts and definitions that 
we are going to need. I will start with the simplest configuration one can use to 
accelerate charged particles. It is comprised of two plates (electrodes) with a dc 
voltage, Va, applied between them, as shown in Figure 2.2. 
A particle with a positive charge q existing in the space between the two 
electrodes would experience a force Fq. This force is proportion to the charge

and (b) acceleration of an electron.

between the electrodes.

The term ( )

 in (2.1) is called the electric field E and its strength is mea-
sured in volts per meter (V/m). We sense the presence of an electric field by the 
force it exerts on a charged particle. The direction of the electric field, as indi-
cated in Figure 2.2, is marked by an arrow pointing in the direction in which a 
positively charged particle would move in the presence of this field. 
If the charged particle is starting at rest at one plate, then the accelerated 
particle would leave this simple accelerator on the other side with output energy 
U0:

If the accelerated particle is an electron, as a negatively charged particle 
it would then move opposite to the direction of E (see Figure 2.2(b)), and our 
electron in this simple electron accelerator would be accelerated from rest to an 
output energy of U0

(2.3) 
where e is the charge of the electron 1.6 × 10–19 C (coulomb). For this reason 
it is common to express the energy of accelerated particles (electrons, protons, 
ions, etc.) using the unit of electron-volt (eV). Thus, an electron-volt is the en-
ergy an electron gains when accelerated by an accelerating voltage of one volt. 
In most of the applications we cover in this book, the energy is measured in mil-
lions of electron-volts; so the energy unit commonly used is the megaelectron-
volt (1 MeV = 1 × 106 eV). In many high-energy physics research accelerators 
the energy is measured in billions of electron-volts; so the energy unit used is 
the gigaelectron-volt (1 GeV = 1 × 109 eV). 
Now, let us imagine that the dc voltage applied between the electrodes 
would be one million volts; then it is more fitting to measure the electric field 
strength in M V/m, megavolts/meter. Actually, our “virtual” accelerator would 
not work if the distance between the electrodes is, say, less than 0.3m. The 
reason is that, although air is normally a good insulator, air begins to break 
down at electric field strength of about 3 MV/m. So let us enclose our simple 
two-plate accelerator and evacuate that enclosure to avoid breakdown. Another 
benefit for keeping the accelerator under good vacuum is to minimize the scat-
tering of the accelerated charged particles by reducing the chances of collision 

18 
RF Linear Accelerators for Medical and Industrial Applications 
 
between the particles being accelerated and any residual gas molecules in the 
path of the accelerated particle.
We can even move closer to our practical linac by replacing our dc voltage 
source by an alternating voltage source, V(t). This will result in a time-varying 
electric field E(t). We then will notice that, as we increase the frequency of our 
source towards the radio frequency (RF) range, we lose a lot of energy that 
would radiate away. So let us enclose our electron in a metallic cavity, which we 
can evacuate to keep under good vacuum (Figure 2.3).
If an electromagnetic wave is launched inside such a conducting cavity, its 
interior metallic surfaces reflect the wave back and forth. When a wave having 
a specific frequency, called resonant frequency, that is resonant with the cavity 
enters, it bounces within the cavity with low loss. As more wave energy enters 
the cavity, it combines with and reinforces the bouncing wave, increasing its 
intensity. Such resonant cavities can be used to efficiently accelerate a charged 
particle, provided that the particle is inserted in the cavity at a time when the 
electric field in the cavity is at or near its peak. Actually, the resonant cavity is 
the most fundamental element in a linac and constitutes the building block for 
the majority of RF accelerators.
Now, let us look at the parameters we use to characterize an accelerating 
cavity. The first one is the resonant frequency f0. In order for our cavity to be 
a resonator, the dimensions of a cavity should be of the order of the RF wave-
length lRF, which is related to the RF frequency f RF by the speed of light c,

(2.4)
A common approach to analyze an accelerating resonant cavity is to solve 
Maxwell’s equations governing the electromagnetic fields in the cavity and 
subject to its boundary conditions. However, to keep our analysis less depen-
dent on differential equations, we use here the equivalent circuit approach in 
Figure 2.3  A simple RF cavity.

modeling our resonant cavity [2, 5]. The equivalent circuit is shown in Figure 
2.4. The cavity is modeled as a parallel RLC resonant circuit driven by a time-
varying source.
The inductance L models the magnetic properties of the cavity when 
hosting the electromagnetic fields. The capacitance C is a representation of the 
electric properties of the cavity. The resistance R models the losses due to RF 
power dissipated in the cavity walls. Let us now consider some of the parameters 
commonly used to characterize such a resonant circuit. The resonant frequency 
is expressed in terms of the circuit elements, its inductance L and its capacitance 
C (assuming the resistance R is small), as given in (2.5),

where V0 is the peak voltage across the parallel circuit. The condition of reso-
nance in our RLC circuit occurs at the frequency at which the energy stored in 
the inductance in one half of the RF cycle is equal to the energy stored in the 
capacitance in the other half of the cycle. Similarly, our RF cavity would reso-
nate when the energy stored in the electric field in half of the RF cycle is equal 
to the energy stored in the magnetic field in the other half of the RF cycle. So 
we can express the energy stored in a cavity in terms of its electric field E or its 
magnetic field H by integrating each of these fields over the volume of the cav-
ity v as demonstrated in (2.7).

(2.8)
In the RF cavity, power loss is proportional to the strength of the magnetic 
field at the cavity walls and the surface resistance of the cavity. For this reason, it 
has been established that oxygen-free high-conductivity (OFHC) copper is the 
preferred material for room temperature RF cavities for its very low resistivity. 
In order to complete the analogy between the RF cavity and its RLC model, let 
us define a parameter that would correspond to the resistance R in the circuit. 
This parameter is called the cavity shunt impedance Rsh. It determines how 
much acceleration one gets from the cavity for a given wall dissipation.

(2.9)
It is to be noted that sometimes the shunt impedance is defined without 
the factor of 2 in the denominator, as in (2.9) above, so be careful. From the 
definition of Rsh we see that in order to maximize acceleration for given cavity 
loss Pcav, one must maximize the shunt impedance. This is done by the choice 
of a low-loss material for the cavity walls and by optimizing the cavity design, 
since Rsh depends on the cavity material and its geometry.
An important parameter for any resonator is the ratio of the stored energy 
in it to the power dissipated in it in one cycle. This important parameter is 
called the quality factor Q, which is given by:

A typical value of Q for a normal conducting copper cavity is of the order 
of QCu = 104 (note that a superconducting cavity can have the quality factor of 
about Qsc = 1010).

 
Linac Basic Concepts and Constituents 
21
Even if we use a good material for our cavity (a high Q) and a good design 
(a high Rsh), we are limited in the maximum acceleration we can deliver to the 
particle being accelerated using a single cavity. The limitation comes from the 
highest electric field that can be sustained in the cavity without arcing (even if 
we maintain good vacuum in the cavity). The obvious solution then is to use 
multiple successive cavities so the accelerated particle, such as an electron, can 
gain more energy as it passes from one cavity to the next. However, we need to 
make sure that our electron would be in the center of each cavity when the elec-
tric field in each cavity has the right polarity to keep the electron accelerated in 
the direction it is traveling. We then have to synchronize all the RF sources that 
energize the individual cavities. A better approach is to feed all cavities from one 
source and connect, or couple, these cavities together. 
2.2  Coupled Accelerator Cavities
Let us consider first the simple example of two coupled cavities shown in Figure 
2.5. An analogous mechanical system would be two pendulums connected with 
a weak spring (see Figure 2.6.) This mechanical system can oscillate in two dif-
ferent ways (modes) with two different frequencies. One mode of oscillation is 
when pendulums are swinging “in phase,” (Figure 2.6a). We call this the zero 
mode. The other mode is when they swing in opposite directions (assuming that 
they do not collide); we call this the π mode (Figure2.6b). The same effect ex-
ists in a two-cavity system: fields in adjacent cavities can have the same (Figure 
2.5a) or opposite directions (Figure 2.5b). Similarly, these two modes are called 
zero mode and π-mode, corresponding to the phase shift between fields in neigh-
boring cavities. Difference in frequencies of the two modes is larger if the cou-
pling (the spring) between two cavities (pendulums) is stronger. The strength of 
the coupling between the two cavities is represented as a dimensionless factor k.
The next step is to analyze a chain of three coupled cavities (see Figure 
2.7). Here we also represent the strength of the coupling between every two 
adjacent cavities by the dimensionless factor k.
Figure 2.5  Two coupled RF cavities: (a) zero mode oscillation, and (b) π mode oscillation.

22 
RF Linear Accelerators for Medical and Industrial Applications 
 
The coupled cavities are usually analyzed by using the equivalent circuit 
representation of a chain of resonant RLC circuits magnetically coupled [2, 5]. 
When the results of the analysis are applied to our three coupled cavities, we get 
three modes; each one has a specific RF field configuration and a corresponding 
frequency. If we assume that the three coupled cavities are identical and each 
has an uncoupled frequency f0 and normalized field of amplitude of unity, then 
the resulting three modes, in order of increasing frequency, are:
The zero mode. It is called the 0 mode because all cavities have zero relative 
phase difference between each other.

We notice that we can deduce the coupling factor k in terms of the lowest 
frequency f0 (the zero mode frequency), the highest frequency fp (the π-mode 
frequency), and the middle frequency (the π/2-mode frequency). Equation 
(2.11), below, gives this formula (for k << 1, which is the case in many of the 
practical cases).

Each of the above natural modes of oscillation represents a possible steady-
state operation for the three-cavity chain where each mode has a resonant fre-
quency and a corresponding field pattern with a particular phase shift from one 
cavity to next. Figure 2.8 gives simplified presentations of field orientations 
for the three modes. By choosing the excitation frequency of an external RF 
source, we can decide in which mode to operate this chain. For example, if the 
exciting frequency matches the zero mode, , then the three-cavity chain would

mode, and (c) π mode.

24

operate in the zero mode and the fields in the three coupled cavities would have 
the same amplitude and they would all be “in phase.” If we excite the π mode, 
we will have the field in each cavity of the chain 180° “out of phase” form the 
adjacent cavity. We will discuss this mode further since it is usually the working 
mode for superconducting accelerators. It is interesting to note that if the π/2 
mode is excited, then the middle cavity in this chain is not excited (i.e., having 
zero field). We will learn more about the unique characteristics of the π/2 mode 
when we discuss some linacs that operate at this mode, such as those used for 
cancer radiation therapy. 
Let us now extend our analysis to a chain of seven coupled cavities. Simi-
lar to the above analysis, solving we get seven modes of oscillation. In Figure 
2.9, we only show the presentations of field orientations for the mode with the 
lowest frequency (0 mode) and the highest frequency mode (π mode). It is to 
be noted that the arrows are just a presentation of the directions of the electric 
filed at one instant, but these fields are varying sinusoidally with time. In Figure 
2.10, we plot frequencies of all seven modes versus the cavity-to-cavity phase 
shift for each mode. The resulting graph is a cosine-like curve and is called the 
dispersion curve, where the first point represents the 0 mode and the seventh 
point corresponds to the π mode. The seven modes would be: 0 mode, π/6 
mode, π/3 mode, π/2 mode, 2π/3 mode, 5π/6 mode, and π mode. Similarly, a 
chain of N-coupled cavities will always have N-modes of oscillation. 
Before we go further, let us pause here and look at the mechanisms of cou-
pling between cavities. There are two ways to couple a chain of cavities together:
Electric coupling: The cavities are coupled by the electric field shared by 
every two adjacent cavities through the coupling apertures along the com-
mon axis (Figure 2.11).
Figure 2.9  A chain of seven coupled RF cavities: (a) 0 mode, and (b) π mode.

26 
RF Linear Accelerators for Medical and Industrial Applications 
 
Magnetic coupling: Here we have to open slots or apertures in the common 
wall between every two adjacent cavities in the regions of high magnetic 
field. The cavities are coupled through the magnetic flux linking both 
adjacent cavities (Figure 2.12).
Coupled cavities are used in accelerators to host the electromagnetic fields 
needed to accelerate charged particles. The electric field component is respon-
sible for exerting the accelerating force on the particles being accelerated. We 
can make our accelerator more efficient by concentrating the electric field on 
an axis by introducing nose cones as shown in Figure 2.13. Another improve-
ment would be to make the opening for the beam as small as possible. This later 
change would limit the coupling through the axial bore. For this reason, many

27
accelerators designs use off-axis apertures to connect adjacent cavities, such as 
those shown in Figure 2.12.
2.3  Linac’s Different Configurations
The function of the linear accelerator, or linac, is to host electromagnetic waves 
that efficiently deliver energy to the charged particles being accelerated. There 
are two conditions that have to be satisfied in the linac structure for it to be 
successful in achieving the above function. These are:
1.	 The electromagnetic waves in the linac should have an electric field 
component along the direction of motion of the accelerated particle.
2.	 The particle and the wave must move in synchronism. For this reason 
the particles are first bunched together upon entrance into the linac. 
Then the “bunch” of particles can move in synchronism with the ac-
celerating fields. 
There are two ways to describe the operation of a linac. In the first, we 
analyze its operation as a chain of coupled resonant cavities operating at a given 
resonant mode satisfying the above two requirements. In the second, we view 
the linac as a hollow cylindrical waveguide having an array of discs to slow 
down the waves propagating in it to match the velocity of the particles’ bunch 
and where the electric field component of the propagating mode have the right 
orientation.
The two most common linac configurations used for medical and indus-
trial applications are the standing-wave (SW) linac and the traveling-wave (TW) 
linac. I will use the coupled-cavity approach to describe the operation of the 
SW linac and keep the waveguide description for the TW linac. Thus the reader 
can be exposed to both approaches without the risk of repeating the analysis.
2.3.1  Standing-Wave Linacs
We have learned from the above coupled resonator analysis that a chain of N-
coupled cavities will have N-modes. Each mode is characterized by a specific 
frequency and a field pattern with a corresponding phase shift from one cavity 
to next. A standing-wave (SW) linac is formed of a chain of coupled cavities 
where the microwave is fed into one of the cavities (normally close to the mid-
dle); see a basic schematic in Figure 2.14. The electromagnetic waves propagate 
from one cavity to the next leaving behind some energy as they pass by. The 
waves get bounced back at the two conducting walls at each end of the linac. 
They continue traveling back and forth and building up the fields in the cavities 

28 
RF Linear Accelerators for Medical and Industrial Applications 
 
until the fields reach their full values. As the waves propagate in both directions 
and get reflected back and forth, they build up standing-wave patterns in the 
structure and, hence, the reason for the name used for this type of linac.
Let us now consider an SW linac of, for example, nine coupled cavities 
(such as the one we sketched in Figure 2.14). We will then have nine possible 
modes at which to operate. By choosing the excitation frequency that matches 
one of these nine modes, we can decide on which mode to operate the structure 
at in order to have a particle accelerator. 
One possible mode for accelerating a charged particle in an SW linac 
would be the π mode. The corresponding field pattern for the π mode in an 
SW linac with nine coupled cavities can be presented schematically as shown 
in Figure 2.15.
In order to achieve acceleration effectively, we need the particle (or bunch 
of particles) to be at the center of the cavity when the field in the cavity is at 
its peak, and by the time the RF field has changed by 180 degrees, the particle 
(or the bunch of particles) has traveled to the center of the next cavity. Thus 
the particle (or the bunch) would always see an accelerating field with the right 
polarity and at the peak. The condition for this synchronism would be that the 
cavity length d and the particle velocity v would be related to the RF wavelength 
by the relation:

To achieve synchronism between the particles accelerated and the RF field 
in a linac, it is essential that we group the particles into bunches. The phase of 
each bunch can then be adjusted to be at the center of the cavity when the RF 
filed is at its peak.
The synchronism condition in (2.12) requires that the cavity length d 
would be increasing from one cavity to the next to match the increase in the 
particles’ velocity v. However, in many practical electron linacs, the electron 
velocity would approach the speed of light after the first few cavities. The rest 
of the cavities downstream would be of fixed length corresponding to the half-
wavelength of the RF.
Since protons are about 2,000 times heavier than electrons, they would 
take much more energy, compared to electrons, before approaching the speed 
of light. Thus in practical proton accelerators, successive cavities have to be of 
increasing length, since the particle velocity v is increasing along the accelerator.
The π mode is implemented in many practical accelerators, especially 
those linacs made up of few cavities. However, if we keep increasing the number 
of cavities in our SW linac, we soon run into a problem if we are using the π 
mode. As we increase the number of coupled cavities in the linac, the number 
of modes will correspondingly increase. The modes become closer to each other 
in frequency. The dispersion curve shown in Figure 2.16 is for a linac with 50 
coupled cavities. The frequency spacing between the π mode and the closest 
mode is small because the π mode and the next nearest-neighbor mode are at 
a region on the dispersion curve where the slope of the curve is close to zero. 
Thus the RF power from the generator can excite both modes rather than hav-
ing all power in the desired accelerating mode, π mode, compromising the 
performance of the linac.
In the above dispersion curve (Figure 2.16), we notice that the π/2 mode 
lies in the center of the linear region and enjoys the largest mode spacing with 
its nearest neighboring modes. For this reason, that mode is employed in many 
of the SW linacs. The field pattern for an SW linac operating at this mode is 
shown in Figure 2.17(a). Although the linac would operate stably in this mode, 
this operation would not be an efficient one since every second cavity does 
not carry any electric field and thus produces no energy gain for the particles 
being accelerated. The logical solution would be to make these zero field cavi-
ties shorter, as shown in Figure 2.17(b). This configuration represents a class 
of SW linacs that is called on-axis biperiodic standing-wave linacs. It can be 
viewed as comprised of two groups of cavities. The normal length cavities are 
the accelerating cavities, also called the main cavities. The shorter cavities make 
up the second group. They have no field; hence they do not participate in the 

30 
RF Linear Accelerators for Medical and Industrial Applications 
 
acceleration. However, they participate in passing the RF power along the linac 
and they couple the accelerating cavities together. They are called the coupling 
cavities, or the auxiliary cavities. We can even make this linac shorter in length 
by moving the coupling cavities to the sides and away from the beam chan-
nel, as shown in Figure 2.17(c). This is the configuration of the side-coupled 
standing-wave linac [5, 6].
The fact that the coupling between the accelerating cavities is not just 
through slots but rather through cavities [the coupling cavities, see Figure 2.17(b, 
c)] enhances the coupling and makes the linac more stable. The coupling is larg-
est when the coupling cavity is at resonance. Conversely, at other off-resonance 
frequencies the coupling is orders of magnitude smaller. This mechanism of 
coupling through the auxiliary cavities is called resonant coupling. Actually, we 
can make the side cavities smaller in size and still maintain the same resonance 
frequencies by adding posts in the coupling cavities as shown in Figure 2.18. 
The posts add to the capacitance in the coupling cavity, thus compensating for 
the reduction in size and maintaining the same resonant frequency.

Linac Basic Concepts and Constituents 
31
Figure 2.18 shows a partially sectioned “side-coupled” SW linac. The cav-
ities on the beam axis are the accelerating cavities. The cavities on the side, the 
coupling cavities, nominally have no field but help stabilize the linac operation 
against perturbations from manufacturing errors.
As we discussed above, the electrons in a linac get accelerated in bunches. 
We will discuss how the electrons cluster into bunches later in this chapter. For 
now, let us follow a bunch of electrons as the bunch gets accelerated down a 
side-coupled SW linac. Referring to Figure 2.19, if the electron bunch is at the 
center of cavity A, the bunch gets accelerated under the force of the electric field 
wave E, as it is in a negative excursion. The reader would recall that electrons 
are accelerated in opposite direction of an electric field. During that time, the 
E wave of the adjacent cavity B is positive and electrons would actually be de-
celerated if they were in cavity B at this instant. However, as the electron bunch 
progresses from cavity A to cavity B, the E wave has switched polarity and now

RF Linear Accelerators for Medical and Industrial Applications 
 
is in its negative excursion, and the electron bunch continues to be accelerated. 
This process continues until the electrons attain their final energy. Here we see 
the need for accurate machining and tuning of each cavity, such that the bunch 
is at the center of the cavity when the RF field is at its peak and with right polar-
ity as the bunch progression from one cavity to the next. 
2.3.2  TW Linacs
In the TW linac, the microwaves enter the accelerating structure on the elec-
tron-gun side and propagate toward the high-energy end of the accelerator, 
Figure 2.18  Side-coupled linac [3].
Figure 2.19  Acceleration mechanism in a side-coupled SW linac.

 
Linac Basic Concepts and Constituents

where they are either absorbed without any reflection or exit the accelerator to 
be absorbed in a resistive load, as shown in Figure 2.20. As mentioned before, 
we need to slow down the waves propagating in a linac to match the velocity 
of the particles being accelerated. This can be done in a variety of ways, but the 
most common approach is to insert irises or disks into the linac at a specific 
periodicity chosen in such a way that the accelerated particles move in step with 
the wave [7]. This configuration results in what is known as the disk-loaded 
traveling-wave linac. The principle of operation of the TW linac is straight-
forward. The electromagnetic wave is launched at the first cell of the linac; the 
wave propagates along the beam axis, and a beam of particles is injected from 
an electron gun along the axis. The electrons are grouped into bunches, which 
are accelerated by the force of the electric field of the electromagnetic wave. 
The conducting walls of the linac and the beam absorb the RF power. Thus, 
the RF field amplitude gets attenuated along the linac. At the end of the linac, 
the remaining RF power is absorbed by resistive material fused to the wall of 
the last cavity or delivered to an external load, as shown in Figure 2.20. In either 
case, no RF power should be reflected to avoid any possibility of establishing a 
standing wave in the linac. An analogy that is often used to convey the concept 
of the operation of a TW linac is that of a person surfing on an ocean wave. The 
surfer rides the forward edge of the crest and travels in step with wave. Similarly, 
the accelerated bunch of charged particles travels on the front of the advancing 
electromagnetic wave.
The TW linac is mostly used for accelerating electrons that would reach 
speeds close to the speed of light once they gain energies higher than 1 MeV, 
which can be attained by the third or fourth cell in many practical TW linacs. 
This is not the case for heavier particles, such as protons, since they travel at 
much slower velocities that would not allow synchronism with the electromag-
netic wave in the TW linac. Another difficulty with accelerating protons or 
Figure 2.20  A basic schematic for a traveling-wave linac.

34 
RF Linear Accelerators for Medical and Industrial Applications 
 
ions in a TW linac is that the velocity of the heavy particle would be continu-
ously increasing as they get accelerated, which would require the TW cells to 
be changing in length from one cell to the other, making it harder to design 
and manufacture. In contrast, in many commercial TW electron linacs only the 
first few calls need to be gradually increasing in length and the rest of the cells 
would be of fixed length.
A note about the terminology related to the linac. Users of the linac in 
the field widely employ such jargon as waveguide accelerator or, even more com-
monly, waveguide. Clearly the term waveguide is a misnomer. Strictly speaking, 
a waveguide is a metallic pipelike section that is used in transmitting microwave 
power. However, it is easy to understand the origin of this lingo that has been 
traditionally used in the trade. As we mentioned previously, the TW linac can 
be viewed as a hollow cylindrical waveguide having an array of discs to slow 
down the waves propagating in it to match the velocity of the particle.
2.3.3  Bunching Mechanism
As we pointed out earlier, in order to be able to achieve synchronism between 
the particles accelerated and the RF field in a linac, we group the particles into 
bunches (see Figure 2.21). The phase of each bunch can then be adjusted to be 
at the center of the cavity when the RF field is at its peak.
To explain the bunching mechanism we use Figure 2.22, and to simplify 
the explanation, we will consider positively charged particles in a cavity-hosting 
electric field. Let us consider three particles: particle S is the synchronous par-
ticle (the center of the bunch), particle L is a late particle, and particle E is an 
early particle. The late particle L sees larger electric field and hence gets more 
boost than S. Similarly, the early particle E sees less field and gets less push. As 
a result they all eventually bunch together.
Figure 2.21  The grouping of charged particles into bunches.

 
Linac Basic Concepts and Constituents 
35
This process would be carried out in the first two or three cavities. Once 
the bunch is formed, its phase is adjusted to be “riding” on the crest of the 
electric field wave to get the maximum acceleration form each cavity. The same 
principle applies to electrons, except that the electron would be bunched and 
accelerated by a negative electric field. Actually, when the electrons are injected 
from an electron gun into the first cavity of the linac, those that enter the linac 
in the retarding phase (electric field positive) are rejected and would not be part 
of the bunches being formed.
In many medical and industrial linacs, electrons injected from the elec-
tron gun would have only energy of tens of kiloelectron volts (10–50 KeV). The 
electrons gain energy as they pass through the first few cavities of the linac and 
gradually approach the speed of light. For example, in some of the short linacs 
electrons gain such energy by the third cavity. In this example the accelerator 
designer will make the first three cavities of different lengths and shorter than 
the rest of the linac. Each of the three cavities will be longer than the preced-
ing one. The fourth cavity and all the cavities following would be the standard 
length to achieve synchronism with a relativistic electron bunch having a speed 
close to the speed of light. 
2.4  Electron Gun Operation
The source of electrons for any electron linac is called the electron gun or E-gun 
for short. The majority of E-guns are based on thermionic emission, where heat 
is used to free electrons from emitting surfaces. Thermionic E-guns have been 
Figure 2.22  Bunching mechanism.

36 
RF Linear Accelerators for Medical and Industrial Applications 
 
used extensively for many years in diverse applications such as linacs, cath-
ode ray tubes (CRT), microwave sources such as klystrons, and other vacuum 
devices. 
A schematic for a typical thermionic triode electron gun is shown in Fig-
ure 2.23 [3]. The gun is comprised of a cathode that emits electrons when heated 
by a heater, a grid to control the flow of electrons, focusing electrodes to provide 
the proper electrostatic boundary conditions to shape the electron beam, and 
an anode. In many cases, the anode is the first cavity in the linac, which is obvi-
ously kept at ground potential. The cathode is enclosed in a ceramic body and 
well insulated, since it is kept at a negative high voltage (-10 to -50 KV). The 
power to the heater determines the amount of current emitted from the cath-
ode. The grid regulates the current to the linac. In the standby mode of the linac 
operation (beam-off), the grid is at a negative potential (-100 to -200 V). The 
negative potential on the grid repels the electrons emitted from the cathode. 
During the beam-on mode, the grid is pulsed with positive potential (300V–
500V), allowing the passage of electrons and controlling the linac current.
For the cathode to be a good electron emitter when heated it has to have a 
relatively low value of a parameter called the work function (the minimum ener-
gy needed to remove an electron from a solid to a point immediately outside the 
solid surface). Over the last six decades different improvements were added to 
the cathode, which normally is made of tungsten, to lower the work function of 
its emitting surface. We will list below two of the important improvements [8]:
Impregnation. The tungsten cathode is impregnated with work function–
lowering chemicals. Common cathode impregnate compositions include 
Figure 2.23  Schematic of a linac electron gun. 

 
Linac Basic Concepts and Constituents 
37
the mixture of barium oxide (BaO), calcium oxide (CaO), and aluminum 
oxide (Al2O3) compounds. Different mixes of these three compounds are 
used in E-gun cathodes, and the most commonly used have relative mo-
lar percentages of BaO, CaO, and Al2O3, respectively, as 5:3:2, 4:1:1, or 
3:1:1. Barium atoms and barium oxide molecules are produced by chemi-
cal reactions and thermal decomposition. These gaseous species diffuse 
through the cathode pores to the cathode-emitting surface, lowering the 
emitter work function. For the barium to diffuse through the tungsten 
cathode, it has to be porous. Most cathodes are made of approximately 
80% dense metal matrix tungsten with pore area of about 20 µm2 and 
pore diameter of about 5 µm.
Emitting surface coating. An important improvement to the electron gun–
impregnated cathode was employing a coating of an alloy of platinum 
group metals, such as osmium-ruthenium alloy (Os-Ru coating), on the 
emissive surface to lower the work function by approximately 20%. This 
type of cathode is known as M type cathode. As a result, this emitter can 
be operated at lower temperatures than the uncoated impregnated cath-
ode for the same current density. It can operate 100°C cooler, which can 
result in a reduction of up to 85% in barium evaporation rate as well as 
a 35% saving in heater power and extending the cathode life 10 times. 
An electron gun used with medical linacs is shown in Figure 2.24.
2.5  X-Ray Generation and Target Design
In many linac applications, including cancer radiation therapy, the linac output 
is an X-ray beam rather than an electron beam. The most common technique 
for the generation of an X-ray beam using a high-energy electron beam is to 
Figure 2.24  Typical electron gun used with medical linacs. (Courtesy of Altair Technologies, 
Inc. [9].)

38 
RF Linear Accelerators for Medical and Industrial Applications 
 
impinge the e-beam on a metallic X-ray target. The process taking place in the 
target in which the energy of electrons is transformed into X-ray photons is 
called bremsstrahlung, which literally means in German breaking radiation.
2.5.1  Mechanism of Conversion
The process of bremsstrahlung is the result of interaction between high-energy 
electrons and nuclei of the target material atoms. An energetic electron, while 
passing near a nucleus, may be deflected from its path by the action of Cou-
lomb forces of attraction and lose energy (see Figure 2.25). As a result, a part 
or all of its energy is dissociated from it and propagates as electromagnetic ra-
diation (photons). Since this interaction may result in partial or complete loss 
of electron energy, the resulting photon may have any energy up to the energy 
of the incident electron. Thus, the resulting photon beam has an upper en-
ergy limit equal to the energy of the impinging electron beam. This conversion 
process is not very efficient since many of the electrons do not partake in this 
process. The efficiency of conversion is given by the ratio of the total power of 
the X-ray beam to the total power of the impinging electron beam. Typically 
this conversion efficiency is less than 5%. Therefore we expect that a lot of heat 
would be generated in the target and cooling measures should be incorporated 
in the X-ray target design.
2.5.2  X-Ray Target Design Requirements
Most X-ray linacs use transmission-type targets in which the electrons bombard 
the target from one side and the X-ray beam is produced on the other side with 
Figure 2.25  Bremsstrahlung process of photon generation.

 
Linac Basic Concepts and Constituents 
39
a relatively narrow forward cone around the direction of the incident electron 
beam. The higher the energy of the electron beam, the narrower the X-ray for-
ward cone. From the above description of the conversion process, one can list 
some of the material requirements for an efficient target:
1.	 Since the bremsstrahlung is based on the deflection exerted on a pass-
ing electron by the Coulomb forces, then the larger the nucleus of the 
target material atoms, the more efficient the process. Hence, It is desir-
able to use a high atomic number (high Z material). Tungsten, gold, 
platinum, and tantalum are possible material choices for linac X-ray 
targets.
2.	 Since the process has a limited efficiency and many of the impinging 
energetic electrons do not contribute their energy to the conversion, 
a lot of energy is dissipated as heat into the target. For this reason the 
target material should have a high melting point, such as refractory 
metals. Tungsten and tantalum are good examples of refractory metals 
that are used as X-ray targets.
3.	 It is preferable that the target material has good thermal conduction 
to facilitate the transfer of the heat generated to the cooling medium 
incorporated in the target design.
2.5.3  Target Design Approaches
Different target design approaches have been implemented in medical and in-
dustrial linacs. The target can be internal or external to the linac. It can be a 
fixed or moving target. Since not all the electrons contribute to conversion 
process, some electrons pass through the target. Provisions are usually provided 
downstream from the target to absorb such electrons in order to have a non-
contaminated beam of X-ray. Therefore, the target layer is usually followed by a 
layer of low atomic number (low Z) material, such as carbon or aluminum, in 
which any remaining electrons are absorbed and filtered out of the X-ray beam. 
Internal Versus External Target
In some linac designs, the target is an integral part of the linac and included 
within its vacuum envelope. In others, the target is a separate component out-
side the vacuum envelope and gets attached downstream of the linac. The later 
approach would require the linac to have a beam exit window that would seal 
the vacuum but allow the passage of the electron beam impinging toward the 
external target with minimum loss to the beam. Some linacs use titanium or 
similar metal as the exit window. The thickness should be a tradeoff between 
durability (thicker window is preferred) and beam attenuation (thinner window 

40 
RF Linear Accelerators for Medical and Industrial Applications 
 
is preferred). For many linacs, an exit window thickness of 50–150 µm would 
be a good trade-off.
Fixed Versus Moving Target
It is a simpler design to have the target made of nonmoving parts. In these con-
figurations, a high thermal conductivity material such as copper is incorporated 
in the target design to help draw off heat generated in the high Z target layer. 
However, this approach is not sufficient in some linac applications with high 
beam intensity. In a fixed target the heat generated is concentrated in an area 
equal to the beam spot size at the target (a couple of millimeters in diameter in 
many cases). This can cause concentrated thermal stresses as well as mechanical 
fatigue in the target layer. An alternative approach is to distribute the location 
of beam incidence on the target by having the target spinning around an axis off 
the beam line. Thus the locus of beam incidence would be in the form of ring of 
width equal the beam diameter at the target. Figure 2.26 is extracted from one 
of the U.S. patents by Siemens Medical Systems, Inc. [10]

Linac Supporting System
In Chapter 2, we discussed the fundamental concepts of operation of differ-
ent types of the linear accelerator (or linac) and its main constituents. In this 
chapter we describe other essential auxiliary components of the linac and a 
typical linac-based RF system such as those used in machines for medical and 
industrial applications. Some of these applications are discussed in Chapter 5 
and Section 6.3.1.
3.1  Introduction—The Linac as a Source for Electron and X-Ray 
Beams
Medical and industrial linac applications use machines built around a linac that 
generates high-energy electrons beams or high-energy X-rays needed for cancer 
treatment or industrial processing. In Figure 3.1, we show a basic presentation 
of the linac as a source for X-rays [1].
As we discussed in Chapter 2 , the main constituents of an electron linac 
as a source of X-rays are:
1.	 The electron gun, where the electrons are generated;
2.	 The main linac body, which is comprised of a series of coupled cavities 
where the electrons are bunched and accelerated;
3.	 The X-ray conversion target, where the X-rays are generated.

44 
RF Linear Accelerators for Medical and Industrial Applications 
 
The operation of the linac requires an RF source to provide the micro-
waves whose fields accelerate the electrons, the means for achiving a good vacu-
um in the linac, and a system for water cooling to maintain the linac tempera-
ture for a stable operation of the linac. In Figure 3.2, we show schematically 
the main consiuents of a linac (E-gun, accelerator body, and the X-ray target). 
Figure 3.1  The linac as a source of X-rays.

Linac Supporting System 
45
Additionally, we show two of the auxiliary subsystems, namely, the linac’s vacu-
um system and the water-cooling system. 
3.2  Linac Auxiliary Systems
3.2.1  Linac Vacuum System
There are three reasons to keep the linac under high vacuum. First, the particles 
being accelerated (electrons, protons, or ions) should be able to travel free of 
any deflections caused by collision with gas atoms or molecules in the linac. 
Second, the high electric field needed to accelerate the particle beam can ion-
ize any remnant atoms or molecules floating inside the linac proper, resulting 
in arcing and breakdown. Third, it is important to avoid the precipitation of 
impurity gases on the surface of the electron gun’s cathode. This may cause 
contamination of the cathode, known as cathode poisoning. Such precipitation 
of foreign atoms and molecules on the cathode surface causes electrochemical 
reactions that can reduce the efficiency of emission from the cathode surface 
and, ultimately, reduce the useful life of the electron gun.
It is therefore desirable to maintain in a linac a vacuum level better than 
10–6 Torr. In fact, many linac manufacturers build accelerators with vacuum 
better than 10–8 torr. The torr is a unit for describing gas pressure. It corre-
sponds to 1/760 of the standard atmospheric pressure. Since it is a relatively 
small unit of pressure, it is commonly used to describe vacuum levels.
To achieve good vacuum in a linac, four points have to be fulfilled. They 
are:
1.	 The linac should be well sealed to ensure no external leaks;
2.	 The inner surfaces of the linac should have low outgassing (release of 
trapped gas atoms and molecules) rates;
3.	 The linac inner surfaces should not have pockets of trapped gas, which 
cause what is known as virtual leaks;
4.	 The linac should be connected to a vacuum pump with a sufficient 
pumping speed; 
5.	 The linac design should provide for adequate vacuum conductance be-
tween different sections of the linac. 
In medical and industrial accelerators an ion pump is normally connected 
to the waveguide section between the RF window and the cavity in the linac 
to which the RF is fed (see Figure 3.3). The ion pump serves to maintain high 
vacuum through gas ionization. It is connected to a high-voltage power supply 
(3–5 KV) to provide the voltage difference necessary for the ionization process 

46 
RF Linear Accelerators for Medical and Industrial Applications 
 
to take place inside the pump [2]. By monitoring the current drawn from the 
power supply, we can gauge the vacuum pressure of the system. In many linac 
applications, the ion pump current is used as a parameter to interlock the radia-
tion system. So in case of vacuum failure due to excessive outgassing, vacuum 
leak, or ion pump malfunction, vacuum control interlock will stop the linac 
irradiation.
3.2.2  RF Vacuum Window
In the basic linac shown in Figure 3.4, a component is marked as RF window at 
the port where the RF is fed into the linac. The function of the RF window is 
to separate the linac vacuum on one side from the pressurized gas (such as sulfur 
hexafluoride, SF6) in the transmitting waveguide on the other side. At the same 
time, the RF widow provides a good RF match for electromagnetic transmis-
sion. The reason for filling the waveguides with pressurized gas is to prevent arc-
ing in the waveguides when they are transmitting high-power microwave from 
the RF source to the linac, as will be discussed in Section 3.3.2 on RF Power 
Transmission Subsystems.
The RF window is made of ceramic, which is normally a high-purity 
aluminum oxide (Al2O3), also known as alumina, which is characterized by its 
Figure 3.3  Linac with an ion pump for maintaining its vacuum level.

 
Linac Supporting System

low RF loss and low outgassing in vacuum. In many RF windows, the ceramic 
is coated with a thin layer of titanium nitride (TiN) on the vacuum side to re-
duce secondary electron emission from the inner surface of the ceramic. An RF 
window for an S-band linac is shown in Figure 3.5 [3].

RF Linear Accelerators for Medical and Industrial Applications 
 
Failure of the linac’s RF window is rare. However, if the window fails it 
could seriously damage the linac, since this can result in loss of vacuum integ-
rity and leak of the pressurized gas from the transmitting waveguide into the 
linac. The most common failure mode is thermal-stress failure resulting from 
excessive localized heat. The sources of window heating are:
1.	 Dielectric loss. The ceramics used in RF windows such as aluminum 
oxide are good insulators so normal conduction loss (representing the 
flow of actual charges through the dielectric) is very low. However, all 
dielectrics (except vacuum) have another mechanism for loss, which is 
the dielectric loss. This is caused by movement or rotation of the atoms 
or molecules in an alternating electric field in the dielectric. The reader 
may realize that dielectric loss in water is the mechanism we exploit for 
heating food and drink in a microwave oven.
2.	 Resistive loss. This loss mechanism can take place in the titanium ni-
tride (TiN) coating layer. For this reason, it is important to control 
the thickness of the TiN film deposited on the ceramic of the RF win-
dow. This loss mechanism can also exist in any conducting impurities 
embedded in the RF window ceramic. In view of that, the purity of 
the dielectric ceramic in the RF window is an essential requirement 
especially for high-power linacs.
3.2.3  Linac Water-Cooling System
Stable operation of a linac requires maintaining the frequency of operation at 
its nominal value. Actually, in copper linacs the power dissipated as heat in 
its structure is generally comparable to or greater than the beam power in the 
linac [4]. This heat, through thermal expansion, causes the linac dimensions to 
change. As a result, the linac’s operating frequency drifts away from its nominal 
value. For example, the frequency of a linac operating in the S-band (2–4 GHz) 
would decrease about 50 KHz for a temperature rise of one degree C. For linacs 
operating in the X-band frequency range such as those operating at 9 GHz, the 
decrease in linac’s frequency would be 150 KHz for a temperature rise of one 
degree C. The sensitivity of the linac’s frequency to temperature varies depend-
ing upon its design and the frequency band within which the linac operates.
To maintain a precise linac temperature control, a cooling water system is 
needed. In Figure 3.6, we show the linac with its water cooling channels. Cool-
ing water is supplied by a specially controlled water-cooling system. The water-
cooling system should be free of scaling, corrosion, or bacteria growth. For this 
reason, it is common to use low conductivity deionized (DI) water.

 
Linac Supporting System

The water-cooling passages are occasionally designed to be integrated 
within the linac’s copper structure. However, the majority of linac designs use 
water pipes that are brazed to the outer surface of the linac.
One of the accepted choices for water temperature in a linac cooling sys-
tem is 40°C. Operating the linac at a temperature that is above the ambient 
temperature makes the operation of the linac less sensitive to ambient tempera-
ture fluctuations. Additionally, having the cooling water’s temperature consid-
erably above the heat exchanger’s water temperature would mean more efficient 
heat transfer. 
3.3  Radio Frequency (RF) System
Linac-based machines for radiation therapy or industrial applications utilize the 
linac as the source of electron or X-ray beams. In such machines, the linac is 
part of an RF system similar to the one shown in Figure 3.7. The main function 
of the RF system is to generate and deliver to the linac the microwave power 
needed to accelerate its electron beam. In addition to the microwave source

(klystron or magnetron), the RF system is comprised of the waveguides needed 
to transmit the RF power, a circulator that controls the flow of the RF power 
and protects the source from any reflected power, high-power load to absorb 
the reflected power, a modulator to provide the high current and high voltage 
pulses to the microwave source, and an automatic frequency control (AFC), 
which is basically a feedback system to synchronize the frequency of the source 
with that of the linac. 
3.3.1  RF High-Power Sources
There are two types of high-power RF sources that are commonly used to pro-
vide the microwave to medical and industrial linacs. One source functions as 
an “oscillator,” which is the magnetron, and the other is a high-power amplifier, 
the klystron. 
3.3.1.1  The Magnetron
The magnetron is used in many of the radiation therapy or industrial units, 
especially with the units employing linacs with electron-beam energy less than 
10 MeV. In Figure 3.8, we show as an example an S-band magnetron MG5193, 
a product of e2v [6]. Peak output power of this pulsed magnetron is 2.6 MW, 
and it is mechanically tuned over frequency range 2,993 to 3,002 MHz. 
The mechanism of any high-power RF source is based upon two funda-
mental requisites. These are the existence of accelerated electrons (in vacuum) 
Figure 3.7  An example of an RF system for an X-ray radiation unit.

 
Linac Supporting System 
51
and resonant cavities. DC voltages and currents are required to provide the 
energy needed to accelerate the electrons. If the source is an oscillator such as 
the magnetron, no input RF signal is needed in general. This simplified concept 
is depicted in Figure 3.9.
The basic structure of the magnetron is an anode made of a number of 
identical cavities arranged in a cylindrical pattern around a central cylindrical 
cathode, as shown in Figure 3.10, and the space between the cathode and anode 
is evacuated [7, 8]. The cathode is indirectly heated by an inner tungsten fila-
ment and the electrons are generated by thermionic emission, the same emis-
sion mechanism discussed before in our description of the linac’s electron gun. 
When the magnetron is pulsed, the anode is at a high positive voltage Va relative 
to the cathode. Also, the whole structure is immersed in a static magnetic field 
provided by two poles of an electromagnet. Thus, a uniform magnetic field B0 
is applied parallel to the axis of the cylindrical cathode and anode. The elec-
trons emitted from the cathode are then accelerated toward the anode under 
Figure 3.8  MG5193 tunable S-band magnetron by e2V [6].
Figure 3.9  Simplified fundamental concept of the magnetron.

52 
RF Linear Accelerators for Medical and Industrial Applications 
 
the forces of a radial electric field, but the presence of the magnetic field B0 
produces an azimuthal force in the φ direction. The combined electrical and 
magnetic forces make the electron to follow a curved trajectory, as shown in  
Figure 3.10. As the electrons move close to the anode cavities, they radiate some 
of their energy in the form of microwaves. The cavity geometry and dimensions 
determine the central frequency of the magnetron. The generated RF pulses are 
coupled out of the anode cavities via a loop to the external waveguide through 
a glass window. The cylindrical waveguide then connects to the rest of the RF 
system of the radiation unit.
Since anode cavities interact together as coupled resonators, they can os-
cillate at different modes. The usual mode employed in a magnetron is the π 
mode, where the phase difference between adjacent cavities is 180o. A sketch of 
the electric field lines in two adjacent cavities is shown in Figure 3.10. To reduce 
the possibility of oscillation in other possible modes, magnetron manufacturers 
use strapping. The straps connect alternate cavities that are of equal phase and 
pass over adjacent cavities which, at mode frequency, are 180o out of phase, to 
ensure the operation of the magnetron in the π mode. In Figure 3.11, we show 
a cutaway magnetron picture and a schematic diagram to illustrate different 
parts of the magnetron. The figures show the strapping as well as the output loop 
used to couple the output RF power from the anode cavities to the cylindrical 
waveguide acting as the output port of the magnetron.
3.3.1.2  The Klystron
The klystron is used as the RF source in many of the linac-based radiation units, 
especially with these units employing linacs with electron-beam energies larger 
than 10 MeV. It is used as an RF power amplifier that amplifies its input of low-
power RF, which is generated by a low-power RF source commonly called the 
RF driver. Similar to other high-power microwave tubes, and as we pointed out 
Figure 3.10  Electric field and magnetic field in a magnetron [7].

 
Linac Supporting System 
53
for the magnetron, we need the existence of accelerated electrons (in vacuum) 
and resonant cavities. DC voltages and currents are needed to provide the en-
ergy required for accelerating electrons. This basic concept behind the klystron 
is depicted in Figure 3.12.
The simplest klystron has two resonant cavities: the first cavity, called 
the buncher cavity, which is energized by low power microwaves from the RF 
driver, and the second cavity, called the catcher cavity, which extracts the micro-
wave power from an energetic beam and emits the high-power RF output. A 
cross-sectional drawing of an elementary two-cavity klystron is show in  Figure 
3.13. The cathode receives dc pulses from a special power supply called the 
modulator. These pulses make the cathode at a negative potential with respect 
to the cavities. Electrons produced by the heated cathode would then accelerate 
toward the buncher cavity and arrive with uniform velocity. When electrons 
pass through the gap in the buncher cavity, they are either accelerated or de-
celerated by the oscillating RF field generated in this cavity, which is fed from 
the RF driver. As a result, some of the electrons would get faster while others 
Figure 3.11  A schematic diagram to illustrate different parts of the magnetron.

54 
RF Linear Accelerators for Medical and Industrial Applications 
 
would be slowed down. Thus, the velocity of the electrons is altered by this ac-
tion, resulting in velocity modulation of the electron beam to gradually bunch 
together as they travel in the drift space between the buncher and the catcher 
cavities. When these electron-bunches arrive at the second cavity (catcher cav-
ity), they induce charges on the ends of the cavity and thereby generate a retard-
ing electric field. Under the influence of this field, the electrons decelerate and 
some of their kinetic energy is converted to the electromagnetic energy in the 
catcher cavity. The microwave power generated in the catcher cavity is coupled 
out to the rest of the RF system powering the linac. The electrons then continue 
moving past the catcher cavity with reduced velocity and deposit the rest of the 
kinetic energy into the collector, where it is converted to heat [8, 9].
One example of the klystrons used in radiation therapy is the Thales’ S-
band klystron TH 2157, shown in Figure 3.14. It produces pulsed microwave 
power with a central operating frequency of 2998.5 MHz, output peak power 
of 7.5 MW, pulse width of 6 μS max, and average power of 8 kW. Typically, It 
operates with beam current of 105A and cathode voltage of 150 kV, which are 
furnished by the modulator in the RF system.

A note about the choice of magnetron versus klystron for linac-based ra-
diation units:
Most of the radiation units using low- to mid-energy linacs (4–10 MeV) 
use magnetrons, which are capable of furnishing the peak power needed (less 
than 5 MW). Compared with klystrons, the magnetrons are physically smaller 
and run at lower cathode voltages, so they do not need extra electrical insula-
tion, such as an oil tank. They also do not require an RF driver. Therefore, mag-
netrons can be mounted in moving radiation units such as the rotating gantries 
in radiation therapy machines, thus simplifying their designs. An additional 
advantage of magnetrons over klystrons is their lower prices. 
On the other hand, klystrons are generally used in high-energy linacs (10–
25 MeV) where power over 5 MW peak is needed, and they are generally more 
stable than magnetrons. Klystrons are larger in size than magnetrons, operate 
at higher voltages, require an RF driver input signal, and their cathode must be 
mounted within a tank of insulated oil.

3.3.2  RF Power Transmission Subsystems
3.3.2.1  Circulator 
The circulator is a passive microwave component with three or four ports [8, 
11], where power is allowed to flow in one direction and not in the reverse, as 
shown symbolically in Figure 3.15. Thus, microwave power applied to one port 
will only emerge at the next port.
The power flow for the three-port circulator is illustrated in Figure 3.16(a): 
power entering port 1 exits at port 2, while port 3 is isolated (decoupled) and 
sees no power out; power entering port 2 exits at port 3, while port 1 is isolated; 
and power entering port 3 exits at port 1, while port 2 is isolated. The same 
pattern applies to the four-port circulator as shown in Figure 3.16(b). 
If we go back to Figure 3.7 for the overall RF system, we see that the cir-
culator is placed between the RF source, the magnetron (or klystron), and the 
linac. If it is a four-port circulator, the power flow is consistent with the nota-
tion marketing in Figure 3.16. The four ports of the circulator are connected 
to the source at port one, the linac at port two, a high-power (H-P) load to 
port three, and a low-power matched load to port four. In this configuration

circulator.

rite Microwave Technologies, Nashua, NH.)

the RF power flows from the magnetron (port 1) to the linac (port 2). Any 
power reflected from the linac would flow to the high-power load (port 3). Any 
power reflected from the high-power load would flow to the low-power load 
connected to port 4. The circulator thus prevents any reflected power from be-
ing returned to the RF source (magnetron or klystron). Thus, the source would 
always see a matched load independent of the accelerator operating conditions. 
Additionally, the circulator would also prevent any build-up of standing wave 
in the waveguide transmission line, which can potentially cause arcing. As an 
example of high-power four-port circulator used in radiation therapy machines, 
we show, in Figure 3.17, a circulator made by Ferrite (Nashua, NH).
3.3.2.2  Waveguide Transmission
The waveguide transmission system is used to transport the RF power from the 
magnetron (or klystron) to the linac in radiation units. Conventional trans-
mission lines (wires and cables) develop too much loss at microwave frequen-
cies. Metallic hollow waveguides present an alternative at these frequencies [8, 
11]. They are made of metals with good electrical conductivity, such as copper, 
brass, or aluminum. The waveguides used in a linac-based radiation machine 
would commonly have a rectangular or circular cross-section as shown in Figure 
3.18. In this figure the solid arrows represent the ordination of the electric fields 
propagating down the waveguide. The dashed arrows represent the ordination 
of the electric fields a half-wave length away, 180o out of phase.
Depending on the operating frequency, the common types of waveguides 
used in radiation units are:
Figure 3.17  A high-power four-port circulator by Ferrite (Nashua, NH).

58 
RF Linear Accelerators for Medical and Industrial Applications 
 
• The rectangular waveguide for S-Band (2–4 GHz) is “WR 284,” where 
the number 284 represents the inner wider dimension (in hundredths 
of an inch);
• For the C-Band (4–8 GHz), the waveguides “WR 187” and “ WR 137” 
are used;
• For the X-Band (8–12 GHz), the waveguides “WR 112” and “WR 90” 
are used.
In many RF systems of radiation machines, waveguides change directions 
at several points. For this reason, we need to include in the RF transmission 
system special waveguide components known as waveguide bends, such as those 
shown in Figure 3.19. The concept behind these bends is to keep the cross 
section uniform to avoid reflections, which usually result from a change in the 
waveguide cross section.
To accommodate slight misalignments between components in linac RF 
systems, to reduce stress on the components, and to allow for easier manufac-
turability, flexible waveguide sections are usually incorporated in the RF power 
transmission system. Figure 3.20 shows a cut-through view of a corrugated flex-
ible waveguide.
The RF transmission system (including the circulator) is filled with pres-
surized gas, such as the sulfur hexafluoride (SF6). Its main purpose is to prevent 
RF breakdown (arcing) in the waveguide transmission system. A by-product 
benefit is that the gas helps cool the system. The SF6 sections are separated from 
the vacuum in the magnetron by its glass dome and from the vacuum in the 
linac by a ceramic window. Similarly, a vacuum window is used when the RF 
source is a klystron. The operating pressure is typically twice the atmospheric 
pressure. The max RF power that can be transmitted through a pressurized 
RF system is enhanced by a factor of 4 when using SF6 versus air at the same 
pressure.

As a protective provision, the pressurized-gas system normally includes a 
pressure gauge that causes an interlock, inhibiting the generation of the high-
power RF if the gas pressure drops below a specified value.

Manufacturing Techniques of 
Accelerators
4.1  Overview of Manufacturing Processes
Precise operations of medical and industrial linear accelerators impose certain 
demands on both materials used and fabrication techniques utilized. They both 
need to be compatible with ultra-high vacuum, high-power RF, and the pres-
ence of particle beams. In this chapter, I will briefly discuss materials compat-
ible with these demands and then I will lead you in a guided tour through 
the sequence of processes of manufacturing a typical commercial linac. After 
selecting the right material that would constitute the cavities of the linac, our 
manufacturing tour starts with the special machining used to cut the linac cavi-
ties. We then stop by the chemical cleaning process, since the linac has to sus-
tain ultra-high vacuum as well as hosting very high electric fields. Once we are 
done with chemical cleaning, we will move with the clean parts to a clean room, 
where we will observe the precise assembly, joining the parts, tuning the linac, 
mounting the source of electrons (the electron gun), and sealing the linac. The 
linac then will be put in a chamber where it will be pumped down to evacuate 
the sealed linac to the desired vacuum level while the linac is kept at tempera-
tures high enough to free up gases trapped on or in the inner surfaces of the 
linac. Before we can start supplying full RF power into our linac, we need to 
do two more steps. First, prepare the electron gun for emitting a steady flow 
of electrons; we call this step gun activation. Second, we need to condition the 
inner surfaces of the accelerator to be able to stand high fields without arcing 
or breaking down. This conditioning step is done by increasing the RF power

input to the linac slowly and gradually. Now, we can safely test the linac at the 
full operating power it is designed for. 
Although I will focus exclusively on the manufacturing of conventional 
room-temperature copper linacs, many of these manufacturing techniques ap-
ply also to the manufacturing of superconducting niobium linacs, except for a 
few special processes. Readers interested in superconducting linacs can consult 
some of the dedicated publications, such as the excellent references [1, 2].
As an overall guide, I have mapped for you the flow of the linac manufac-
turing processes in Figure 4.1. Now we should be ready to learn about each of 
these processes; let us begin.

4.2  Material Requirements
The proper operation of a linac depends on several factors. One significant fac-
tor is the selection of the material used in fabricating the linac cavities. Some of 
the requirements for the choice of such material are as follows:
1.	 Electrical conductivity. This is the most important parameter for the 
linac material. For a given geometry and frequency, this parameter 
determines the power loss of the linac’s walls and hence the linac’s 
efficiency. For this reason, it is always recommended to use OFE (Ox-
ygen-Free Electronic) copper. Another common name linac manu-
facturers use is OFHC (Oxygen-Free High-Conductivity) copper. 
The oxygen content in the OFE copper is normally restricted to 5 
parts-per-million (ppm). The electrical conductivity of OFE copper 
is around 5.8 × 107 1/(ohm-cm). This is superior to aluminum [3.7 
× 107 1/(Ohm-cm)] or stainless steel [1.5 × 106 1/(ohm-cm)] [3]. Al-
though silver has an electrical conductivity of 6.2 × 107  1/(ohm-cm), 
which is better than copper, copper is used more commonly in linac 
manufacturing for obvious economical reasons. 
2.	 Thermal conductivity. This is the second important parameter in 
choosing the linac material. It determines the rate of transfer of heat 
into the cooling system for a given power dissipation in the linac’s 
walls. Again, copper is chosen because of its high thermal conductiv-
ity, 4.0 (W/cm/°C). The electrical and thermal conductivities for OFE 
copper, aluminum, stainless steel, and silver are listed in Table 4.1 [3]. 
One can notice from the table that the values of electrical conductivity 
and of thermal conductivity are closely correlated for these metals. 
3.	 Vacuum outgasing. The rate of outgasing from the linac inner surfaces 
determines the sustainable vacuum levels in the sealed linac for a given 
installed vacuum pump. Thus, materials used for the construction of 
linacs should have low outgasing (release of trapped gas atoms and

molecules) rates. Copper used for linac cavities are normally mechani-
cally worked by rolling or extruding to eliminate porosity and reduce 
grain size, which help reduce outgasing rates.
4.	 Mechanical stiffness and machinabilty. This property affects the 
elastic deformation of the linac cavities under external pressure. 
Unintended deformation can perturb the linac frequency. The 
parameter quantifying this property is Young’s modulus of elas-
ticity. Additionally, the ease of machining the material is anoth-
er consideration. Copper can be cut quickly and easily to obtain a 
good surface finish without wearing down the cutting tool much. 
  Although OFE copper is soft after annealing, it work-hardens rap-
idly when distorted. For this reason, we will see when we discuss the 
tuning of cavities in Section 4.6 of this chapter, that tuning needs to 
be performed in as few operations as possible because the work-hard-
ening requires the use of greater and greater force on each successive 
operation.
5.	 Cost. Obviously, this factor should be considered in deciding on which 
material to use for making commercial linacs. For example, we saw 
above that the electrical and thermal conductivities of silver are supe-
rior to copper. However, as a trade-off almost all linac manufacturers 
use copper, given the price difference. 
6.	 Electron secondary emission yield. The electron secondary emission 
yield (SEY) describes the number of electrons emitted from the inner 
surfaces of the linac for each electron incident on the surface. Copper 
has a comparatively low secondary emission yield. 
7.	 Other requirements. We briefly listed above the general linac material 
requirements. However, special linac applications may compel the lin-
ac manufacturer to consider additional material properties. Examples 
are: magnetic permeability, mechanical creep resistance, and mechani-
cal fatigue.
Given the above requirements, it has been established that because of its 
high electrical conductivity, the OFE copper is the preferred material for room-
temperature linacs. Additionally, it can be machined to high precision and good 
surface finish, it is compatible with ultra-high vacuum (UHV), is an excellent 
heat-conductor and can be conditioned with high power RF to prevent RF 
breakdown, and it has a comparatively low secondary emission yield. Its main 
disadvantages are its relatively low strength and that it becomes soft after ther-
mal annealing at high temperatures. 

 
Manufacturing Techniques of Accelerators 
65
4.3  Cavity Machining
The preferred machining operation for linac cavities is the lathe turning. For-
tunately, most linac cavity designs have cylindrical symmetry and thus lend 
themselves to turning as the preferred machining operation for linac cavity cut-
ting. Most of the machines used are of the computed numerically controlled 
(CNC) type. Coolant and machining lubricants used in this operation should 
be water-based, not oil-based. These machines should have filters to continu-
ally filter the machining fluids, which also should be changed periodically. This 
machining process should result in surfaces with no sharp ridges or burrs. The 
roughness of the resulting surfaces is characterized by a parameter called the av-
erage roughness (Ra), expressed in one of two units: the microinch (μ″), which 
is one-millionth of an inch, or the micrometer (μm), which is one-millionth of 
a meter. Basically, the Ra is the average difference between the peaks and valleys 
of the surface over a certain length. Typically, the resulting surface roughness is 
about Ra = 12 - 16 μ″ (0.3 to 0.4 μm). A well-controlled turning machining 
process, including the choice of tool, feed per spindle rotation and speed of 
rotation, machine geometry, degree of vibration isolation, and environmental 
conditions can result in surface roughness of Ra = 8 - 10 μ″ (0.2 to 0.25 μm). 
These surface finishes are normally obtained using polycrystalline diamond tool 
bits. For even more superior surface finish, Ra ≈ 2 - 4 μ″ (0.05 to 0.1 μm), 
single-crystal diamond is used as the cutting tool and sophisticated turning 
techniques are employed [4].
4.4  Chemical Cleaning
Since the linac inner proper will be under high vacuum, it is important that 
the inner surfaces be clean and that most of the gases adsorbed on or absorbed 
in the surfaces are removed. Actually, on every exposed copper surface, a thin 
oxide layer forms, and it is usually this porous oxide layer in which gases are eas-
ily trapped. For this reason, it is important that the chemical cleaning process 
involves removing the oxide layer from the inner surfaces of the linac cavities. 
One possible chemical cleaning process for OFE copper is used in European 
Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) [5] and is as follows:
1.	 Vapor degreasing in percholroethylene (C2Cl4) at 121°C.
2.	 Alkaline soak with ultrasonic agitation for 5 minutes in an alkaline 
detergent at 50°C.
3.	 Tap water rinse.
4.	 Pickling in HCL (33%) by volume with H2O 50% at room tempera-
ture for 1 to 5 minutes.

H2SO4 (Sulfuric acid) 3 cm3/l
	
This is done at room temperature for 30 seconds to 1 minute.
9. Running tap water rinse
10.	 Cold deionized (DI) water rinse.
11.	 Dry with filtered air or dry filtered N2.
12.	 Wrap in Al foil.
4.5  Assembly and Bonding Techniques
After chemical cleaning, the clean cavities and other linac components are 
moved (wrapped in aluminum foil or lint-free tissue) from the chemical clean-
ing room to the clean room, where they will be assembled. Extra care should 
be given to this step to ensure the clean handling of parts, such as wearing the 
proper clean room attire and masks, and using clean gloves, as shown in Figure 
4.2
The techniques commonly used to bond the cavities are brazing and dif-
fusion bonding. In both techniques, extra attention should be paid to ensure 
precise alignment at assembly to produce an accurately straight linac. 
4.5.1  Brazing
The prevailing technique for joining the linac’s constituent cavities and parts 
is brazing. The brazing process involves the use of brazing fillers (for example 
copper-gold alloy) that are inserted into the joints between adjacent cavities 
before mounting them in a brazing furnace. Thus, brazing is different from 
welding, where two parts of the same metallic material are heated locally above 
the melting temperature of the metal. In brazing, the components to be joined 
are placed in a furnace such as that shown in Figures 4.3 and  4.4. The brazing 
furnace provides heat to melt the brazing filler that solidifies later to form the 

 
Manufacturing Techniques of Accelerators 
67
vacuum-tight joints. The filler can be a metal or an alloy that has a melting 
temperature lower than the two parts to be joined. The filler can be in the form 
of brazing foil or a brazing wire. During the brazing cycle the joint is heated to 
a certain temperature lower than the melting point of the parts but high enough 
to melt the filler material. The brazing filler then melts and wets the joining 
surfaces flowing by the capillary action through specifically designed gaps and 
small channels. In the cooling phase of the brazing cycle the filler solidifies, cre-
ating a strong bond at the joint. It is advisable to perform leak tests of subassem-
blies once they are brazed before getting to the next assembly step. One of the 
common vacuum-leak checking techniques is to use helium leak detectors [7]. 
With this technique the operator can spot the points of leak, and the part can 
be rebrazed and rechecked for leak before proceeding to the next assembly step.
The conditions for a good braze are as follows:
• The melted filler material wets the joint surface well and in a controlled 
way.
• The pieces to be joined do not “float” out of their position while the 
brazing alloy is the liquid phase.
Figure 4.2  Assembly of linac parts in a clean room [6].

68 
RF Linear Accelerators for Medical and Industrial Applications 
 
• The liquid brazing alloy does not penetrate into the cavity (a phenom-
enon known as blushing) and coat parts of the surface inside, which 
would change the resonant frequency of the cavity. Figure 4.5 shows an 
example of blushing.

It is to be noted that the cleaning processes mentioned above are critical in 
insuring that the joining surfaces are free of grease and oxide layers in order for 
the molten brazing filler to wet the joint during the brazing cycle. The brazing 
gap at the joint is typically 1 to 2 mils (a few hundredth of a millimeter). It is 
recommended that the brazed joint would be designed such that on cooling the 
joint is under some compression rather than in tension. 
Different brazing alloys behave differently when becoming liquid and it 
requires experience and exact temperature control to attain the desired result. 
Some of the common brazing alloys used in Cu-Cu joints are listed in Table 
4.2 [3]. The difference in brazing temperatures for different alloys allows the 
manufacturing engineer to design a process with multiple brazing cycles on the 
same component with successively reduced brazing temperatures. Actually, it is

possible, in some special cases, to do more than one braze at the same tempera-
ture using the same filler alloy. The reason we are able to do the successive braze 
with the same filler is that some fillers change their composition during brazing 
by alloying with the base material of the joining parts. Thus, the melting point 
of the new alloy moves to a value higher than the original melting temperature 
for the filler but is still lower than the melting point of the parts being joined. 
Therefore, the second braze would not melt the previous brazing.
The brazing is usually done in a dedicated furnace, which is either evacu-
ated (vacuum of 10-6 torr or better) or filled with hydrogen. The vacuum braze 
helps in removing the hydrogen trapped in the linac parts and hence reduces 
the time needed to outgas the surfaces in the subsequent process of bake-out. 
In order to obtain uniform heating of large parts, the furnace must be equipped 
with a number of independent heating zones (typically molybdenum pan-
els) whose temperatures are precisely controlled. The temperature control (by 
monitoring the readings from a sufficient number of thermocouples connected 
to the parts) must allow temperature homogeneity and precision within a few 
degrees. It is also possible to produce high-quality braze joints in a hydrogen at-
mosphere due to its reducing effect of the surface oxides. Hydrogen brazes help 
in getting more rapid and uniform heating of the components in the furnace. 
However, the hydrogen tends to remain in grain boundaries near the surface, 
which subsequently requires long bake-out to outgas this trapped hydrogen in 
order to attain good vacuum.
4.5.2  Diffusion Bonding
Brazing is used routinely in the assembly of linacs operating in the L (1–2 GHz), 
S (2–4 GHz), and C (4–8 GHz) frequency bands. For X-band (8–12 GHz) and 
higher frequency linacs, the ability to produce high quality brazed joints in a 
consistent way for small cavities has been a major concern. Excess flow of braze 
from the joints into the cavity leads to a local degradation of the surface finish 
and can produce an unpredictable change in cavity volume leading to frequency 
changes. These difficulties lead some accelerator research groups to develop the 
use of copper/copper diffusion bonding in the assembly of linacs [8, 9]. This 
process involves heating the mating surfaces in a furnace at about 1,000°C 
while the joining parts are kept under pressure. The contacting surfaces should 
be very clean and have superior flatness and surface finish. A good diffusion 
bond would be manifested by having the grains of one part grow into the other 
part across the bond joint at the joining surface, as shown in Figure 4.6. The 
research and development effort for about a decade, from the mid-1990s to the 
mid-2000s, helped in optimizing the conditions for diffusion bonding of linac 
copper cavities. In the early prototypes, the requirements on surface flatness and 
finish were very stringent, but after a decade of development these requirements 

 
Manufacturing Techniques of Accelerators 
71
were relaxed since it was found that we can increase the pressure exerted on the 
parts under the same heating conditions without the fear of introducing sig-
nificant deformation to the linac cavities (resulting in detuning). In Table 4.3, 
diffusion bonding conditions at earlier linac prototypes are compared to more 
relaxed surface requirements after a decade of development.
In the diffusion bonding example shown in Figure 4.6, the OFE copper 
samples had a flatness of 200 μ” and surface finish of 8 μ”, the pressure used 
was 20 psi and the temperature was 1,015°C (personal communication, Chris 
Pearson, SLAC).
4.6  Tuning of Linacs
During brazing, some of the molten brazing alloy can make its way inside the 
linac cavities, resulting in variation in the volume of these cavities, which in 
turn can change the resonant frequency characteristics of the linac. For this 
reason, it is a common practice to manually tune the individual cavities after 
the brazing step in order to bring the resonant frequencies of individual cavities

to their nominal design values. This is usually done by a skilled tuning techni-
cian who has to affix the linac on a fixture, perform a series of measurements 
[11], and modify the cavities as needed by deforming the physical structure of 
each cavity (dimpling it with a small hammer) until the desired frequency is 
achieved. The tuning can be done with the help of a computer program that 
uses explicit instructions and diagrams to lead the operator through a tuning 
sequence. The measurements are carried out using a Network Analyzer that is 
controlled by a computer using graphical programming environment such as 
LabVIEW©, a software by National Instruments [12]. Figure 4.7 shows, as an 
example, a computer screen for a computer-assisted tuning system for a side-
coupled linac. In this example, the positions of measuring probes and auxiliary 
cavity inserts are displayed on the computer screen as a guide to the operator 
in tuning a specific cavity, the second cavity in this example. After the cavity is 
tuned, the program would display new positions corresponding to the next cav-
ity to be tuned. The position indicators continue to move sequentially from one 
cavity to the next until the operator is done tuning all the linac’s cavities. Such 
an automation approach of the low-power RF measurements for tuning proved 
to be effective in increasing the accuracy and consistency of the tuning process 
and at the same time reducing the tuning process cycle-time [11].
In order to be able to adjust the frequency of a linac cavity up and down, 
a small pin is sometimes brazed into the outer wall of the cavity. Then, a slide-
hammer can be latched to the pin and used to “pull” or “push” the cavity wall, 
thus decreasing or increasing the cavity frequency, respectively. However, this 
Figure 4.7  A computer screen for a computer-assisted tuning system [11].

 
Manufacturing Techniques of Accelerators

additional provision of using a brazed tuning pin adds substantially to the cost 
and time of the linac production. Therefore, it is more common to machine 
the cavities to a slightly larger diameter and dimple the cavity wall to raise the 
frequency as needed. 
As mentioned earlier in this chapter, copper work-hardens rapidly when 
distorted. For this reason, the tuning needs to be performed in as few dimples 
as possible and spread the dimpling around the surface of a cavity if possible. 
This is done because the work-hardening requires the use of greater and greater 
force on each successive dimpling at the same location. 
It is to be pointed out that since the measurement of the cavity frequency 
is done in air under atmospheric pressure, the measured frequencies must be 
corrected for the dielectric constant of air and also for the ambient temperature, 
which may be different from the temperature at which the linac will be oper-
ated. For example, the dielectric constant of air at 20°C and 60% humidity 
is approximately 1.0006, which would lower the frequency by 0.3% from its 
vacuum value. The ambient temperature influences the dimensions of the linac, 
and hence, the frequency. As the temperature of the linac rises, the cavity vol-
ume is bigger and its frequency decreases. As a rule of thumb, the approximate 
change in frequency for S-band linacs (e.g., operating at 3 GHz) is 50 KHz/°C. 
For linacs operating in the X-band frequency range, such as those operating at 
9 GHz, the decrease in linac’s frequency would be 150 KHz/°C. The sensitivity 
of the linac’s frequency to temperature varies depending on its design and the 
frequency band within which the linac operates. 
4.7  Thermal Outgasing (Bake-Out)
The linac has to be sealed and kept under high vacuum for two reasons. First, 
the particles (electrons, protons, or ions) being accelerated should be able to 
travel free of any deflection caused by collision with gas atoms in the linac. 
Thus the interior space of a linac must have a low enough density of gas mol-
ecules to allow free passage of the accelerated particles. Second, the high electric 
field needed to accelerate the particle beam can ionize any remnant atoms or 
molecules floating inside the linac proper, resulting in arcing and breakdown. 
It is therefore desirable to maintain a vacuum level better than 10-6 torr. In fact, 
many linac manufacturers build accelerators with vacuum in the mid 10-8 torr 
scale. To achieve this level of vacuum in manufactured linacs, it is important to 
heat the linac inner surfaces while the linac is being evacuated. This process is 
called thermal outgasing or bake-out. 
Normally, exposed copper surfaces would have a thin oxide layer. This po-
rous layer can contain some gas species at concentrations more of than the Cu 
bulk. The rationale behind the bake-out process is based on providing thermal 

74 
RF Linear Accelerators for Medical and Industrial Applications 
 
energy to gas molecules adsorbed on the surface or absorbed in the inner surface 
of the linac cavities to free these gases. In order to liberate these bound mol-
ecules, the thermal energy provided should be higher than the binding energy 
for each gas. This binding energy is exponentially dependant on temperature. 
Thus, the more we increase the copper temperature, the more outgasing we 
achieve. Typical bake-out temperatures for copper linacs would be in the range 
of 300°C to 500 °C. Typical gases that would be desorbed from the linac’s inner 
surfaces are H2, H2O, CO, CO2, and CH4. It is also recommended that a device 
be attached to the system to analyze the type of gases that are being outgased 
from the inner surfaces of the linac. The device is called a residual gas analyzer 
(RGA), which contains a mass spectrometer for identifying different gas spe-
cies. It is used to monitor the quality of the vacuum and easily detect minute 
traces of impurities in the low-pressure gas environment of the accelerator. It is 
a useful diagnostic device when the outgasing system does not achieve its nomi-
nal target vacuum level in the linac in the typical time duration for this process. 
The RGA can show specifically which gases are limiting the pump-down. This 
enables the accelerator manufacturing engineer to trace the source of the excess 
gas or contaminants present and take the appropriate corrective action in order 
to return the linac manufacturing processes to normal operation.
Bake-out is a slow process that has a relatively longer cycle-time in the 
linac manufacturing flow compared to other processes. It may take 20 to 30 
hours to attain vacuum levels of 10-8 to 10-9 torr. One way to optimize the bake-
out cycle-time is to end the process based on attaining a certain vacuum level 
that is sustained for a specific period of time. This is a better approach than just 
assigning a certain fixed duration for the outgasing process. Also, some outgas-
ing furnaces can be built to accommodate two or three linacs to be processed at 
the same time, increasing the throughput of the process. 
After the linac has been evacuated to the desired vacuum level, the linac is 
disconnected from the pumping system of the bake-out station. The connect-
ing vacuum port is flanged, sealed, or pinched off. Now, the vacuum level of the 
linac is sustained with a small vacuum pump mounted on the linac. Typically 
this is an ion pump, since these pumps are the appropriate type of pumps for 
low-pressure systems such as the linacs vacuum systems.
4.8  Electron Gun Activation
The next step in the linac manufacturing progression is to prepare the electron 
gun for emitting a steady flow of electrons. Usually, this process is called gun 
activation or gun conditioning. As mentioned in Chapter 2, the electron gun 
is the part of the linac that supplies the stream of electrons, usually as a well-
defined beam. It consists of a cathode, a heating filament, and a grid assembly. 

 
Manufacturing Techniques of Accelerators 
75
In many cases, the anode for the gun is the linac copper body. Specifically, this 
step involves activating the cathode of the electron gun by heating it by means 
of applying a voltage across the heating filament. The heating is done in gradual 
steps at the beginning of the process to allow the linac’s ion pump to pump 
away gases breaking away from the cathode and the internal surfaces of the 
electron gun. The goal of this cathode activation is to promote the formation of 
a layer on the cathode surface that emits electrons easily and steadily during the 
linac’s normal operation. By applying heat during gun activation, the chemicals 
impregnated in the cathode tungsten body diffuse to the emission surface to 
form a uniform layer that has a low work function, making it a good electron 
emitter. The end of the gun activation process is usually verified by plotting the 
gun emission curves. These curves are plots of the measured current emitted 
versus filament voltage (which is proportional to the cathode temperature), as 
simulated in Figure 4.8. From these plots we can differentiate between a fully 
activated gun (Plot 1) and a partially activated gun (Plot 2). A fully activated 
gun would exhibit a flat region with constant emission, called the space-charge 
region. Operating in this region ensures the stability of the current emitted 
against variations in the cathode’s temperature.
Some of the pitfalls inherent in gun activation when done improperly are 
as follows:
• Incomplete gun activation. This results in an uneven emission from dif-
ferent regions on the cathode surface. This would be manifested in the 
gun emission plots as the Plot 2 in Figure 4.8. Here we notice that we 
do not get the nice flat region, and hence we lose the stable operation 
of the gun.
Figure 4.8  Simulated emission plots for an electron gun.

76 
RF Linear Accelerators for Medical and Industrial Applications 
 
• Overheating the cathode. This would cause loss of the impregnation 
emission material prematurely through evaporation. This can also result 
in the deposition of some of this emission material on linac surfaces, 
with the accompanying lowering of the work function of the linac cop-
per surfaces coated with this material. These linac surfaces would now 
emit electrons under the forces of the high RF fields during normal 
operation. The adverse effect of that is manifested as a current emitted 
in the linac even when the electron gun is off. We call this undesirable 
current dark current.
4.9  High-Power RF Conditioning
Before we can begin supplying the full RF power into our linac we need to 
condition the inner surfaces of the accelerator so that it would be able to stand 
high fields without arcing or breaking down. This conditioning step is done by 
increasing the RF power input to the linac slowly and gradually. This process is 
usually known as RF conditioning or RF processing.
A newly fabricated linac will break down (i.e., experience arcing) fre-
quently at high accelerating fields. The presence of high electric fields near the 
copper surface can give sufficient energy to electrons in the copper that are near 
its surface to escape from that surface. This phenomenon is known as high-field 
emission. The freed electrons then get accelerated by the RF fields and can col-
lide and ionize atoms or molecules floating inside the linac, resulting in arcing. 
As the linac is operated, the arcing rate at a given field strength decreases gradu-
ally. When we increase the field strength or the RF pulse width to new higher 
values, the arcing rate increases again. This cycle of RF processing is repeated 
until at some point no further significant progress (reduction in the arcing rate) 
can be made in a reasonable time of processing. The simple explanation of the 
mechanism of conditioning is that RF processing vaporizes, or “polishes away,” 
small surface features or whiskers on the inner surfaces of the linac. Actually, in 
the process, some molten metal splashes from the vaporization spot to nearby 
ones, forming new features. The size of the new feature depends on the strength 
of the RF field in the linac during processing. For this reason, it is important 
that input RF power would be increased gradually and in small increments to 
avoid the creation of new features that would cause further arcing. Increasing 
the pulse width should also be done very carefully, since the pulse width deter-
mines the amount of RF energy available to sustain an arc once it is initiated. 
Generally speaking, the above procedure is a slow and lengthy process. 
For this reason, it is recommended to automate the process whenever feasible. 
An example for the conceptual algorithm behind a linac automated condition-

 
Manufacturing Techniques of Accelerators 
77
ing system is described in the publication [13] and depicted in Figure 4.9. In 
this technique, three parameters are controlled, namely:
• Peak RF power;
• Pulse repetition frequency (PRF);
• Pulse width.
These parameters are stepped up automatically in increments until reach-
ing the maximum power rating for the specific linac being conditioned. This is 
done with the help a feedback system that continually monitors two feedback 
parameters: arc counts and ion pump current (indicating the vacuum level).
It is to be noted that some of the linac manufacturing processes preceding 
the conditioning step impact the length of time needed to fully RF condition a 
linac. Two of these factors are:
• Scratches, machining marks, or sharp features on the inner surface of 
the linac. These act as points of field enhancement, and hence they be-
come more susceptible to high-field electron emission. 
• Impurities and contaminants on the inner surface of the linac. These 
can emit electrons under the effect of high field easier than the copper 
(i.e., they may have a lower work function compared with pure copper).
Figure 4.9  Conceptual algorithm for a linac automated conditioning system [12].

78 
RF Linear Accelerators for Medical and Industrial Applications 
 
From the above, it is clear that a linac process engineer needs to pay atten-
tion to the machining process of the copper to ensure that the inner surfaces are 
free from scratches, visible machining marks, or sharp features. Also he or she 
should carefully guard the cleanliness of the linac components through all steps 
of the linac manufacturing.
4.10  Linac’s Beam Tests and Test Bunkers
After the linac has been conditioned to operate under high RF power, it goes 
into a set of beam tests to ensure that it meets its operational specifications. 
The linac is tested under conditions simulating its normal operation in the field 
(whether in a cancer treatment unit or in some industrial application). The 
output electron (or X-ray) beam is tested for its energy, dose rate, and stability. 
The input RF power needed to achieve the specified output is also measured. 
In certain linac applications it is important to identify and record the beam’s 
transverse profile. The results of the beam tests should be documented and sent 
to the user of the linac with other documentations accompanying the shipped 
linac.
The linac conditioning and beam tests are carried out in a specially shield-
ed room. The goal is to limit radiation exposures to acceptable levels for the test 
operator and the supporting ��������������������������������������������������
technicians by running the linac tests from a con-
trol console outside this test cell or bunker. The shielding material absorbs the ra-
diation according to the density of material. Concrete is usually the material of 
choice, providing a good compromise between cost and effective radiation ab-
sorption. However, if space is at a premium, then special high-density concrete 
or high-density metals, such as steel or lead, can be used. The thicknesses of 
the concrete should be commensurate with the maximum energy of the beam 
used during testing. To guard against air pockets, it is customary to vibrate the 
concrete mix as it is poured. Ideally, the concrete should be formed in one pour 
to avoid seams between different layers. The test bunkers are usually located on 
the periphery of the linac manufacturing complex to avoid radiation exposure 
to other workers located in high-occupancy areas. Actually, in some facilities, 
the linac testing is done in rooms below ground level to save on shielding costs 
and reduce radiation leakage to the surrounding working areas.
In order to reduce the radiation dose near the entrance, a restricted access 
passageway leading to the test bunker may be incorporated in its layout. This 
passageway is termed the maze (see Figure 4. 10). Another advantage of a maze 
is a route for ventilation ducts and electrical conduits without compromising 
the shielding walls.

 
Manufacturing Techniques of Accelerators 
79
The door to the test bunker must be interlocked to the accelerator test 
setup, such that the irradiation will be terminated to prevent an exposure if a 
door is inadvertently opened. The interlock should be fail-safe so that safety 
is not jeopardized in the event of failure of any one component of the system. 
Also, it is recommended to have an emergency beam turn-off switch installed 
in appropriate location in the accelerator test room.
The test control area, where the operators control the linac tests, should 
be close to the entrance to the test bunker so that the operators can view the 
entrance area. It is also recommended that an illuminated warning sign be dis-
played at the entrance to the test bunker, which is illuminated when the beam 
is turned on and delivering radiation.
It should be noticed that ducts and conduits between the test cell and the 
outside control console must be adequately shielded to prevent any radiation 
leakage through them. This includes ducts for cables necessary to control the 
test unit and physics equipment, as well as heating and ventilation ducts.

4.11  Common Manufacturing Issues and Imperfections
We are now essentially done with our guided tour of the linac manufacturing 
facility. Nevertheless, as many process engineers know, it is expected and ac-
cepted that the above linac manufacturing processes inherently and inevitably 
encompass some degree of deviation from the nominal process specifications. 
For those working in this industry, I cannot overemphasize the importance of 
cleanness of the parts and the manufacturing environment. Also important is 
having a quality system in place to avoid the common linac manufacturing is-
sues and potential defects. Therefore, it is the role of the process engineer to: 
• Understand the predictable manufacturing imperfections and system-
atic variations in each process and the impact on subsequent processes 
and on the performance of the final product, the linac. 
• Implement various quality system (QS) provisions such as quality con-
trol (QC), quality assurance (QA), and statistical process control (SPC), 
and integrate them into different linac manufacturing processes. 
• Continuously implement different process improvements. The process 
engineer can always benefit from measures and approaches derived from 
the Six Sigma methodology [13].
In this section, I list some of the linac manufacturing processes’ imperfec-
tions and deficiencies and their typical impact on the quality of the linac. These 
are tabulated in Table 4.4. Quality measures and some examples of QA, QC, 
and SPC relevant to linac manufacturing are discussed in the next section.
4.12  Quality Systems in Linac Manufacturing
Many of the commercial linacs are used as part of radiation therapy machines 
used in treating cancer. Consistent high quality and defect-free products are 
clear requirements in the field of medical devices. Manufacturing reliable ac-
celerators and, hence, reliable radiation therapy machines requires accurate, ef-
ficient, and well-controlled processes throughout the steps of the accelerator’s 
manufacturing. Thus, the linac manufacturing processes normally encompass 
built-in QSs that are applicable to the general medical device industry, a heav-
ily regulated industry. In the United States, these processes benefit from the 
guidelines offered by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In this 
section, I highlight briefly some of the built-in QC and QA measures as well as 
SPCs that can be implemented in the manufacturing of medical and industrial 
linacs. These measures should result in processes that are stable, predictable, 

 
Manufacturing Techniques of Accelerators

and guarantee the production of linac-based machines that are of high quality, 
cost-effective, and in compliance with regulatory requirements.
4.12.1  Examples of QC and QA Measures
4.12.1.1  Cell Machining QC
Because the linac cavities host very high fields during the linac operation, and 
to avoid arcing and breakdown, the cavity’s inner surfaces should be free of 
scratches. For this reason, it is not recommended to verify the dimensions of the 
machined copper cells using a stylus or a tool that would touch the inner sur-

face of the cells. An alternative technique to confirm that the cell is machined to 
specifications is to verify the frequency of the machined cells [15, 16]. A typical 
set-up would be based on a computer-controlled network analyzer to measure 
the resonant frequencies of individual cells as they come out of the lathe. In this 
setup, the cell is placed on a clean metallic plate that acts as a conducting wall 
to close up the cell to form a resonant cavity (Figure 4.11). The plate has holes 
where RF probes are protruding to excite and pick up the signal inside the cav-
ity. The feedback from this technique is used to “tune” the lathe for each batch 
and also periodically during the day to compensate for tool wear or temperature 
variations. The frequency of each cell and its serial number are recorded. 
4.12.1.2  Bead-Pull Technique as a QA Measure
Tuning a linac would confirm that the frequencies of the linac cavities are at 
the correct value. However, it is also important to make sure that the electric 
field distribution inside the linac is as specified by the linac design. This is done 
using a perturbation technique known as bead-pull [17]. This measurement 
technique is based on the fact that a small object (a bead), when placed inside 
any of the linac cavities, will change the energy stored in the electric field in this 
cavity. This is because the bead has dielectric properties different from those of 
air and thus perturbs the electric field at its position. This results in a change 
in the resonance of this cavity. A simplified, and actually an approximate, view 
of the effect of the bead is that its presence changes in the capacitance of the 
cavity under the assumption that the fields outside the bead are hardly altered. 
The change in cavity capacitance means a change in the electrical energy stored 
in the cavity and at the same time a change in the cavity frequency. Thus, the 
relative change in frequency is proportional to the relative change in the electric 
Figure 4.11  Single-cell QC. (From: [15].)

 
Manufacturing Techniques of Accelerators

energy stored in a cavity. Since the electric energy is proportional to the square 
of the electric field, we can construe that the strength of the electric field can 
be plotted as a function of position along the linac by detecting the change in 
frequency (Δf ) of the cavities as the bead moves along the linac. If we call the 
unperturbed energy stored in the cavity U and the unperturbed electric field 
E, then we can describe the concept behind the bead-pull mathematically as:

The electric field amplitude distribution for a standing-wave accelerator 
resulting from a bead-pull measurement is portrayed in Figure 4.12.
A typical bead-pull setup uses a network analyzer to measure the change 
in frequency as a function of the position of the bead in the linac. A small bead 
is normally affixed to a thread that moves inside the linac with the help of a sys-

bead-pull system [18]. Note that the linac shown in this setup is of the traveling 
wave type and the reader may notice that this linac, as with all TW linacs, has 
two RF ports, an input port and an output port.

4.12.2  Examples of Statistical Process Control
One of the techniques that can be used to monitor different accelerator manu-
facturing processes and provide useful feedback to the process engineer is SPC 
[19]. Analysis of the data resulting from the SPC is used to initiate actions to 
maintain and improve the capability of the process. SPC is used to control 
the process by signaling when adjustments may be necessary, thus preserving 
consistent and high-quality process performance. SPC uses control charts as 
a graphical means for monitoring critical process parameters. A control chart 
allows the operator to monitor trends occurring in a process by plotting the 
values of a chosen process parameter as a function of time or sample number. A 
process is in “a state of control” if this plotted parameter lies between the upper 
and lower control limits of the process. The upper control limit (UCL) and the 
lower control limit (LCL) are determined by evaluating the dispersion (variabil-
ity) in process (see Figure 4.14). In a well-controlled process, these limits can be 
chosen to be equal to μ ± 3σ respectively, where σ (sigma) is the process stan-
dard deviation and μ is the process mean. These statistical limits are normally 
called the 3-sigma control limits. In a normal (Gaussian) distribution, 99.73% 
of the parameter-tracked values lie in an interval of width 6-sigma.

4.12.2.1  Possible SPC Parameters in the Manufacturing Processes of a Linac
As a guide to the linac process engineer, I list below some of the linac manu-
facturing parameters that can potentially be good candidates for SPC tracking:
Receiving inspection parameters. Tracking some of critical parameters of 
the received components and subsystems is important for evaluating and 
ensuring the supplier’s quality.
Cavity frequency “as-machined.” This is a measure of the consistency of 
machining and also helps detect any adverse trends (such as tool wear or 
lathe misalignments).
Cavity frequency “as-brazed.” This parameter reflects the consistency of the 
brazing process. For example if there is internal blushing (excess braze 
material), it would be manifested as an increase in the cavity frequency.
Tuning parameters. These parameters indicate the overall quality of tuning 
the accelerator.
Bake-out time. The bake-out process time needed to achieve the specified 
vacuum level, as indication of completion of the process, is monitored 
and recorded as an SPC parameter. This parameter can be used as an in-
dication of the level of cleanliness of the preceding processes. If an RGA 
is attached to the bake-out station, one could also track the level of a 
particular gas at a particular point in time, say at the beginning or end of 
bake-out.
Figure 4.14  General form of a control chart for SPC.

86

E-gun activation time. This would allow the process engineer to track the 
consistency of the performance of the electron guns and, hence, the con-
sistency of the manufacturing processes at the E-gun supplier.
RF conditioning time. This parameter can be used as an indication of the 
level of cleanliness of the preceding processes as well as internal surface 
finish.
In Figure 4.15, I show a flow chart for linac manufacturing and mark pos-
sible processes for which tracking their characteristic parameters by SPC can be 
implemented.
4.13  Guidelines for Linac Buyers and Users
In addition to reviewing linac’s manufacturing processes, we also discussed in 
this chapter the linac manufacturing processes’ imperfections and deficiencies 
and their typical impact on the quality of the linac. It is hoped that this would 
help buyers of linacs for medical or industrial use understand explanations giv-
en by linac manufacturers about why a particular linac may not be performing 
up to its full specifications.
Another goal of this chapter is to help potential linac buyers and users in 
assessing the merits of alternative linac suppliers. In choosing a linac supplier, 
one can consider the following list of guiding remarks and points:
1.	 Records for QC and QA data provided by the linac supplier.
2.	 The extent and consistency of tracking quality parameters of the man-
ufacturing processes. A good linac manufacturer would implement a 
quality-tracking system, such as SPC tracking.
3.	 Examination of the material specifications and certifications indicat-
ing the type of copper used and its purity and chemical contents. 
4.	 Cleanliness practices in handling and transporting linac parts prior to 
the linac final assembly.
5.	 Indications of excessive tuning, such as a disproportionate number of 
tuning dents and markings.
6.	 Excessive overflow of brazing material on the external surfaces of the 
linac (blushing). As mentioned in Section 4.6 of this chapter, this 
would indicate the existence of internal blushing, which results in 
changes in the resonant frequencies of the linac cavities.
7.	 Indications of repeated or excessive welding. This can result in changes 
in frequency of cavities bordering the weld region. Normally, it is dif-

 
Manufacturing Techniques of Accelerators 
87
ficult to measure and correct the frequency variation in an assembled 
linac subsequent to the tuning process and sealing the linac.
Figure 4.15  Flow chart of linac manufacturing processes with possible SPC monitoring.

88 
RF Linear Accelerators for Medical and Industrial Applications 
 
8.	 Checking the vacuum integrity of the linac. Poor vacuum in the linac 
can be indicated by higher than normal current reading on the ion-
pump power supply.
9.	 Excessive arcing as indication of less-than-perfect cleaning process, in-
complete thermal out-gazing, or incomplete RF conditioning.
10.	 Some linac manufacturers prefer to use bolted flanges to mount the 
electron gun. Others avoid flanges and use welding to mount the elec-
tron gun. The former approach has the advantage of giving the man-
ufacturer’s technicians the ability to change the electron gun in the 
field. The later approach avoids any risk of compromising the vacuum 
integrity by breaking vacuum in the field. However, it requires sending 
the linac back to the manufacturer for electron gun replacement.

Role of Linear Accelerators in Cancer 
Radiation Therapy
5.1  Basic Radiation Therapy Concepts and Definitions
Radiation therapy or radiotherapy (RT) describes the clinical process that uses 
ionizing radiation to kill cancerous cells. It is one of the major medical mo-
dalities used in treating cancer. Other widely used cancer treating modalities 
are surgery and chemotherapy. Actually, more than half of all cancer patients 
receive radiotherapy, either alone or in combination with surgery or chemo-
therapy. The power of the radiation therapy is its ability to ionize atoms and 
molecules inside the nuclei of the biological cells of the tissue to which the ra-
diation is applied, thus killing the cancerous cells by damaging their DNA. The 
radiation can either damage the DNA directly or create charged particles (free 
radicals) within the cells that can in turn damage the DNA.
A patient may receive radiation therapy before, during, or after surgery, 
depending on the type of cancer being treated. Also, some patients may receive 
radiation therapy in combination with chemotherapy. In certain cases both 
radiation therapy and chemotherapy are used after surgery. In a few number 
of cases, other cancer treatments are used, such as those employing nonioniz-
ing radiation. Examples are the photodynamic (light) therapy or hyperthermia 
(heat) treatment.

92 
RF Linear Accelerators for Medical and Industrial Applications 
 
Depending on the stage of cancer, RT is used either as a curative treat-
ment or as a palliative treatment, relieving some of the symptoms of the disease 
and reducing the suffering caused by it, thus improving the quality of life of 
cancer patients. The ultimate goal of radiation therapy is to deliver an accurate 
dose of ionizing radiation to a well-defined targeted tumor volume and, at the 
same time, satisfy the challenge of minimizing the dose of radiation absorbed 
by the surrounding healthy tissue. 
In general, radiation is classified into two main categories, nonionizing 
and ionizing. The distinction is based on the ability of the radiation to ionize 
the absorbing material (see Figure 5.1). Ionization is the ejection of an orbital 
electron from the absorber atom. Medical (and industrial) applications of lin-
acs utilize the ionizing radiation. Ionizing radiation can ionize matter either 
directly or indirectly:
• Directly ionizing radiation are charged particles: electrons, protons, and 
ions. They deposit energy in the medium through direct Coulomb in-
teractions between the charged particles and orbital electrons of atoms 
in the medium.
• Indirectly ionizing radiation are photons (X-rays and gamma rays) and 
neutrons. The effect of this type of radiation is done in two steps. First, 
the incident radiation creates charged particles: photons release electrons 
or positrons, and neutrons release protons or ions. Second, the released

Role of Linear Accelerators in Cancer Radiation Therapy

charged particles deposit energy to the medium through direct Cou-
lomb interactions with orbital electrons of the atoms in the medium.
Most radiotherapy treatments are carried out with photon beams; how-
ever, some are carried out with electron beams. Electron beams are especially 
used for superficial tumors (less than 5 cm deep). For this reason, many of the 
linac-based RT machines provide the option of using photon beams as well as 
electron beams for cancer treatments. 
Ionizing radiations used in conventional linac-based RT units are high-
energy electron beams, and X-rays, and are the subject of this chapter. Ra-
diation therapy techniques using protons and carbon ions have some unique 
characteristics but require higher energy accelerators. They are based on circular 
accelerators, such as cyclotrons or synchrotrons, and hence this type of RT is 
offered in larger facilities, some of which are discussed in Chapter 7.
X-rays and gamma rays are electromagnetic waves. The discrete quan-
tity of electromagnetic radiant energy is the photon. When a photon collides 
with an atom’s orbital electron, it knocks this electron out of position, ionizing 
the atom. These newly freed electrons can ionize other atoms and molecules 
in the irradiated tissue. Although one cannot distinguish between X-rays and 
gamma rays if they both have the same energy, it is customary to apply the term 
X-ray to ionizing electromagnetic radiation produced by machines. The term 
gamma rays is applied to the similar radiation produced by radioactive isotopes 
(radionuclides).
The parameter that quantifies the biological impact of ionizing radiation 
on irradiated tissues is the absorbed dose or simply dose. The unit of the dose is 
the rad (which is derived from radiation absorbed dose). It is equivalent to the 
deposition of 100 ergs of energy per a gram of irradiated material. The SI unit 
of dose is the gray (Gy), which is the absorption of one joule (J) of energy per a 
kilogram of absorbing material. The dose rate is specified in rads per minute or 
centigray per minute.
Recalling that, 1 joule = 104  ergs, then we get:
1 rad = 100 ergs/g = 10-2  J/kg
1 Gy = 1 J/kg
1 rad =  10-2  Gy = 1 cGy
Thus, one rad is equal to one centigray (cGy) 
Note that because the biological effects of radiation depend not only on 
dose but also on the type of radiation, the parameter used in dosimetry relevant 
to radiation protection is the dose equivalent. The unit for the dose equivalent 
is the sievert (Sv). To take into consideration the type of radiation, the dose is 

94 
RF Linear Accelerators for Medical and Industrial Applications 
 
multiplied by a dimensionless weighing factor W to get the dose equivalent. 
One sievert is equal to one gray times the factor W.
	
1 Sv = 1 (Gy) * W	
For X-rays, gamma rays, and electrons this weighing factor W is one. 
Thus for X-rays, gamma rays, and electrons, we can treat the Sv as one Gy, or 
100 rads. The factor W takes larger values for radiation of heavier particles, 
such as protons and carbon ions.
The dose equivalent is commonly expressed in units smaller than the Sv. 
In the United States, the units rem and mrm (millirem) are used frequently.
1 rem = 0.01 Sv = 10 mSv
1 mrem = 0.001 rem = 0.01 mSv = 10 μSv
When a beam of electrons passes through a medium, the electrons suffer 
multiple collisions with orbital electrons as well as change in their direction of 
travel (i.e., scattering) due to Coulomb force interactions between the incident 
electrons and the nuclei of the medium. These two effects cause the electron 
beam to lose some of its kinetic energy as it travels through the medium. Thus, 
for an incident electron beam of electrons, the dose is reduced with depth. Sim-
ilarly, a photon beam propagating through a medium is affected by attenuation 
and scattering of the photon beam inside the medium. The variation of dose 
with depth is normally described by the beam percentage depth dose (PDD). It 
is the ratio of the dose at a given point on the central axis of a beam (electron

MeV and (b) photon beams with 6 and 15 MV [1].

or X-ray) to the maximum dose on the central axis, multiplied by 100. Typical 
PDD curves in water for both electrons and X-rays are shown in Figure 5.2.
5.2  Radionuclides-Based Radiation Therapy
There are two principal approaches for delivering ionizing radiation to the tu-
mor. In the internal radiotherapy, a radiation source is placed inside or in a 
close proximity to the area of the targeted tumor. This approach is known as 
brachytherapy. This is in contrast to external beam radiotherapy, also known as 
teletherapy, in which the ionizing radiation originates from a machine outside 
the body and is directed towards the tumor. 
5.2.1  Brachytherapy
Brachytherapy is based on placing a radioactive source in close proximity to 
the tumor. In this mode of therapy, a high dose of radiation can be delivered 
locally to the tumor with rapid dose fall-off in the surrounding healthy tissue. 
Most of the sources used in brachytherapy are artificially produced radioactive 
isotopes such as cesium 137 (137Cs), iridium 192 (92Ir), gold 198 (198Au), iodine 
125 (125I), and palladium 103 (103Pd). The implanted radionuclides can be re-
moved after a period of time (temporary implant) or remain forever (permanent 
implant). Brachytherapy is used alone or combined with external beam radio-
therapy. About 5% to 15% of patients receiving radiation may be candidates for 
brachytherapy. Further coverage of brachytherapy is beyond the scope of this 
book. Readers interested in more information will find numerous books on the 
subject [2–4].
5.2.2  Cobalt Teletherapy
In this category of external beam radiotherapy, gamma rays are emitted from 
radionuclides as they undergo radioactivity disintegration. The isotope cobalt 
60 (60Co) proved to be the most suitable radionuclide to be employed in this 
type of RT machines. The 60Co emits gamma rays, which constitute the useful 
treatment beam. 
The isotope 60Co is produced when cobalt 59 (59Co) is placed in a nuclear 
reactor in which the nucleus captures a neutron to become unstable and hence 
turn into a radioactive isotope. The isotope 60Co has a half-life of 5.27 years and 
emits two gamma rays with energies of 1.17 and 1.33 MeV, corresponding to 
an average energy of 1.25 MeV. 
The 60Co source, which is usually in a form of a solid cylinder, discs, or 
pellets, is typically sealed inside stainless-steel capsules housed inside a steel 
shell with lead for shielding purposes. The housing of the radioactive source 

96 
RF Linear Accelerators for Medical and Industrial Applications 
 
is a part of a gantry to facilitate the rotation of the source about a horizontal 
axis, referred to as the machine isocenter axis. In addition to the source housing, 
the gantry comprises a beam collimator and source movement mechanism for 
bringing the source in front of the collimator opening to produce the clinical 
gamma-ray beam. A cobalt teletherapy unit is shown in Figure 5.3 [5, 6]. 
The cobalt unit has the advantage of reliability because of the relatively 
straightforward configuration. However, the margins of the gamma-ray beam 
have a less well-defined border than the X-ray beams from linacs. The lack of 
definition of the beam margin, known as the penumbra, is the result of the 
relatively large physical size of the cobalt source, which is of the order of 2 cm 
in diameter, compared with RT units using linacs that have a focal spot size 
of about 1–2 mm. The closer the radiation source’s size to a point source, the 
smaller the penumbra. The larger penumbra results in fuzziness at the edges of 
the radiation field and, hence, the possibility of a higher level of irradiation of 
tissues adjacent to the treated volume. This can be an important factor in limit-
ing the discrimination between the targeted tumor and the surrounding healthy 
tissue in delivering the radiation using the cobalt units. Another problem with

cobalt units is their decaying source, which results in gradual reduction in out-
put. This in turn results in progressively increasing treatment times with the 
associated continued reduction in patient throughput. Generally, the cobalt 
source needs to be replaced every 5 to 7 years, with the accompanying cost and 
additional provisions needed for the disposal of the spent source. 
Today, the overall use of such radionuclide-based treatment units has de-
creased in many countries around the world and many have been replaced with 
linac-based radiation therapy units. Some of the reasons for this decline are 
mentioned above, but perhaps the most important reason is the risk associated 
with the storage of radioactive sources in a hospital and the disposal of the spent 
cobalt. In contrast, medical linacs contain no inherently radioactive materials.
5.3  Accelerator-Based Radiation Therapy
The development of both the cobalt-based teletherapy units and the linac-based 
radiation therapy machines started roughly at the same time in the midfifties of 
the last century. However, the linac-based RT machines eventually eclipsed the 
cobalt units and became the most widely used radiation source in the present 
day. Linear accelerators can produce higher energy beams than cobalt units and 
operate at higher dose rates. With their compact and efficient designs, linac ma-
chines offer excellent versatility with a wide range of energies. They can provide 
either electron or X-ray therapies with megavoltage beam energies. 
In addition to the conventional radiation of electrons and X-rays, accel-
erators can be used to accelerate heavier particles, such as protons and ions of 
certain elements, to treat cancer. This recent effort to develop particle therapy 
has produced several treatment centers around the world. Particle therapy con-
tinues to benefit from a rigorous effort of research and development to make it 
a viable and an affordable cancer therapy option. We will cover particle therapy 
in Chapter 7.
In the conventional therapy, the majority of treatments use X-rays and 
a smaller number uses the electron beam or a combination of both therapies. 
In the X-ray therapy, they can produce photon beams in the range of: 4 to 25 
MV, and in the electron therapy the treatment electron beam can cover the range 
of: 6 to 25 MeV. The length of the linac depends on the final electron kinetic 
energy, and ranges from ~30 cm for 4 to 6 MeV linacs to ~150 cm for the 25-
MeV linacs. The linac is mounted on a gantry. As the gantry is rotated, so is 
the accelerator and the resulting treatment beam, so that the radiation can be 
delivered to the tumor from multiple directions. In Figure 5.4 we show one of 
Siemens’ radiation therapy machines, the Primus™. This radiation oncology 
machine offers both X-ray and electron beams and at multiple energies. It uses 
the longer type linac that is located in the gantry parallel to the gantry’s axis of 

98 
RF Linear Accelerators for Medical and Industrial Applications 
 
rotation. A beam transport system is then used to transport the electron beam 
from the accelerator to the treatment head including a 270o bending magnet.
5.4  The Medical Linac Requirements
The electron linear accelerator is the source of the ionizing radiation in the 
prevailing majority of radiation therapy units. It can be a standing-wave or 
traveling-wave accelerator. As described in Chapter 3, microwave power needed 
to accelerate electrons in a medical linac is generated in an RF source, which is 
part of the RF system of the RT unit. The RF source can be a magnetron for 
low- to mid-energy linacs (4 to 10 MeV) or a klystron for high-energy medical 
linacs (10 to 25 MeV).
Medical linacs differ from other commercial linacs, such as those used 
in industrial applications, and from those built for high-energy physics experi-
ments, in that they have to satisfy certain requirements to achieve the necessary 
performance in a radiation oncology treatment unit. Some of these require-
ments are:
1.	 Dose-rate output. Higher dose-rate helps in shortening the treatment 
session with the accompanying more convenience for the patient and 
increase in treatment facility throughput. The dose-rate output de-

Siemens. (From: [7].)

 
Role of Linear Accelerators in Cancer Radiation Therapy 
99
pends on the linac design and its efficiency and is limited by the power 
capability of the RF source.
2.	 Output stability. The consistency of dose-rate output is very essential 
since it directly affects the amount of radiation dose delivered to the 
tumor that has to follow accurately the treatment plan for a given 
patient. This requires a dose-rate that is consistent and stable with 
time during the treatment and also stable with the gantry rotation. To 
achieve this stability, the linac cooling water is held and regulated at 
a nominal temperature (30o to 40oC, depending on the system). Ad-
ditionally, the output dose-rate is sensed by a dose monitoring com-
ponent (such as an ionization chamber) that is a part of a feedback 
system that changes the beam parameters, such as its pulse repletion 
frequency or the pulse width.
3.	 Precision of output beam. The treatment fields (X-rays or electrons) 
need to match the tumor volume precisely at the 1mm level. In order 
for the beam shaping techniques to work best, the beam spot at exit 
from the linac should be as small as possible, preferably in the range of 
1 to 2 mm, but not more than 3 mm. The ultimate and ideal source 
of radiation would be a point source, which is an aim to design for but 
obviously a theoretical limit.
4.	 Size and length of the linac. To achieve good mobility of the gantry 
structure, as well as ease in shielding the linac, it is important to opti-
mize the design of the linac and the choice of the operating frequency 
to accomplish this requirement. For these reasons, as will be pointed 
later in this chapter, some of the specialized RT machines, such as the 
robotic-based CyberKnife and the mobile intraoperative Mobetron, 
use linacs operating at the X-band frequency range (8 to 12 GHz) 
while the majority of RT machines that use linacs operate in the S-
band frequency range (2 to 4 GHz). Although the S-band linacs are 
larger than the X-band ones, they have the advantage of the avail-
ability of S-band RF sources with more power capabilities than the 
X-band RF sources currently available for such RT machines. A small 
number of RT machines use linacs operating in the C-band frequency 
range (4 to 8 GHz), with linac sizes smaller than the S-band and larger 
than the X-band ones [8]. 
5.	 Cost of manufacturing. It is a known fact that there is an unsatisfied 
demand for radiation therapy machines, especially in many of the de-
veloping countries. So it is my hope that the up-and-coming new gen-
eration of accelerator designers will fulfill this need. They should help 
cancer patients around the world with new designs of linacs that lend 

100 
RF Linear Accelerators for Medical and Industrial Applications 
 
themselves to more manufacturability and the use of robotic assembly 
to allow for linac production in large quantities and at a reasonable 
cost.
5.5  Clinical Use of Linacs in Radiation Therapy
5.5.1  Clinical Requirements
Modern radiation therapy is now one of the most powerful tools for the treat-
ment of localized tumors. However, there are certain clinical requirements that 
have to be satisfied to achieve successful treatments. The most fundamental 
requirement is to deliver the necessary dose to kill the cancer cells and at the 
same time minimize the dose to the surrounding healthy tissue.
Some of the organs adjacent to a tumor can be relatively sensitive to radia-
tion damage, such as the spinal cord, salivary glands, lungs, and the eyes. These 
must be given special consideration during treatment and in the treatment-
planning phase. This is a challenging requirement since, to eradicate tumors 
within the human body using ionizing radiation, the radiation beams usually 
traverse normal tissue with the consequent possibility of damaging normal cells 
and the potential for complications as a result of treatment. 
The radiation therapy machine should be capable of delivering a dose that 
has the following characteristics:
1.	 The dose should be sufficient to destroy the tumor, to stop the cancer-
ous process, and to prevent the relapse of the disease. 
2.	 The dose should be as uniform as possible over the targeted area to be 
irradiated.
3.	 As low a possible dose should be delivered to the healthy tissue sur-
rounding the tumor.
4.	 The dose rate should be high enough to minimize the time of irradia-
tion and the chances of patient movement.
Other requirements for a radiation therapy machine, in addition to the 
above, include the stability and repeatability of its dose rate, reliable perfor-
mance of dose delivery with minimum downtime, the ability to vary the energy 
of its X-ray or electron treatment beam, and, of course, the patient’s safety 
against any mechanical injury.
Over the last forty years, a great deal of development has occurred and 
new approaches have been implemented to improve efficacy, safety, and ac-
curacy of dose delivery to the cancer patient. In this chapter, we cover briefly a

101
number of these techniques. Some of them are now common in the every day 
radiation therapy treatments offered, and some are more specialized. 
5.5.2  Treatment Planning and Simulation
The beam delivery step is only one step within the process of radiation therapy. 
Some of the other essential steps in this process are as follows:
1.	 Diagnosis and clinical evaluation. This step confirms the existence of 
the tumor and determines at what stage it is.
2.	 Modality decision making. The options include surgery, chemothera-
py, radiation, or a combination of two or three of these.
3.	 Obtainment of the necessary images to use in treatment planning. 
The sources of imaging can be computed tomography (CT), mag-
netic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasound, single-photon emission 
computed tomography (SPECT), or positron emission tomography 
(PET). With recent advancement in medical image processing, it has 
become possible to fuse images from more than one of the image mo-
dalities to form a comprehensive three-dimensional image.
4.	 Target volume localization. In this crucial step, the tumor boundaries 
are defined as the targeted volume to be irradiated.
5.	 Simulation. A machine called the simulator is used to emulate the ge-
ometry of the treatment unit. It uses diagnostic X-rays to localize the 
planning target volume and also the critical normal tissues. It also 
helps determine the optimal placement of the radiation beams on the 
patient.
6.	 Radiation treatment planning. In this step, the data obtained from 
the preceding steps are used to design the treatment fields’ geometry, 
to calculate the dose distribution for each field, and to devise the dose 
fractionation plan. In many cases the treatment plan includes the use 
of a variety of beam energies and field sizes. In general, treatment 
planners attempt to optimize the dose distributions achievable with a 
given treatment strategy to deliver an effectual dose of radiation to a 
target volume, while minimizing the amount of radiation absorbed in 
healthy tissue.
5.5.3  Dose Fractionation
There are multiple approaches followed in radiation therapy aimed at sparing 
healthy tissues. One of the most effective approaches is fractionation. In this 

102 
RF Linear Accelerators for Medical and Industrial Applications 
 
protocol, the overall dose is delivered in fractions, or sessions, over a protracted 
period of time. The dose per fraction is chosen during treatment planning, at 
an optimal value in order to achieve a high probability of curing the tumor 
and reasonably low probability of affecting normal tissue. It is clear that the 
probability of tumor cure increases with increasing radiation dose. However, a 
careful choice of dose for each fraction takes advantage of the difference in re-
sponse to irradiation between the tumor tissue and the normal tissue, as shown 
in Figure 5.5 [9].
Fractionation takes advantage of the differential ability between the tu-
mor cells and the healthy cells for repair. Let us consider two groups of cells, 
namely, the abnormal group of cells (tumor tissue) and a normal group of cells 
(healthy tissue). We will assume that they both got the same dose in their daily 
fractions. After a fraction of the dose is delivered, and during the normal break 
between radiation sessions (24 to 48 hours), the normal cells in general have 
a better ability to recover than the abnormal cells. This differential advantage 
becomes more and more effective with repeated sessions and the breaks between 
them. Figure 5.6 [10] demonstrates this effect after several successive fractions 
(e.g., seven fractions). As can be seen in this illustrative example, a large per-
centage of normal tissue survives while the majority of tumor cells are destroyed 
when fractionation is employed. Thus, it is clear that in fractionated radiation 
therapy, if the normal cells receive sublethal radiation, the damage can be re-
paired more efficiently during prolonged treatment course.

dose. (From: [9].)

5.5.4  Rotational Therapy
In rotational therapy, the gantry rotates through a given arc or a full 360o around 
the patient who lies on a treatment couch. The patient is positioned such that the 
center of the tumor is located at the isocenter, a point defined by the orthogonal 
intersection of the axis of rotation of the gantry (which is parallel to the patient) 
and the therapy beam axis (which is normal to the patient). 
There are two basic configurations for the RT machine. In one configura-
tion, shown in Figure 5.7(a), the linac is mounted in the gantry perpendicular 
the patient. This is the simplest configuration for a radiation therapy machine. 
It eliminates the need for an intricate beam transport system. This is typically 
used in photon therapy for treatment photon energies between 4 and 6 MV. 
On the other hand, in higher energy machines, the linacs, which are longer, are 
located in the gantry parallel to the gantry axis of rotation, as shown in Figure 
5.7(b). An intricate beam transport system is then used to transport the electron 
beam from the accelerator to the treatment head. This configuration is usually 
used in RT machines delivering both X-ray or electron beams and at multiple 
energies.

and the healthy cells. (From: [10].)

5.6  Conformal Radiation Therapy
The goal of conformal radiation therapy (CRT) is to deliver a high dose to a 
volume that closely conforms to the shape of the patient’s tumor volume and 
at the same time minimize the dose to any neighboring sensitive organs. This 
translates to accurately identifying both the exact shape and location of the 
tumor. The development of conformal radiation therapy allowed the use of the 
maximal applicable tumor doses without increasing radiation-induced compli-
cations for the patients. This requires good imaging, accurate radiation dose 
calculation, computer-optimized treatment planning, and computer-controlled 
delivery of precisely directed treatment beams.
Figure 5.7  Two basic configurations for radiation therapy machines. (Modified from: [9].)

 
Role of Linear Accelerators in Cancer Radiation Therapy 
105
Conformal radiation therapy became possible with some of the recently 
developed techniques. Tumors usually have an irregular shape, but thanks to 
those techniques, the radiation oncologist is capable now of shaping the target-
ed volume exactly to the size and shape of the tumor. Some of the most effective 
tools and techniques are the multileaf collimators (MLCs), intensity-modulated 
radiation therapy (IMRT), adaptive radiation therapy (ART), image-guided ra-
diation therapy (IGRT), stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), and tomotherapy. We 
will discuss in this section the first three since they go together and complement 
each other. We will discuss image-guided radiation therapy and tomotherapy in 
later sections.
5.6.1  Multileaf Collimators (MLCs)
As mentioned before, a major limitation to the efficacy of radiation therapy 
is the risk of creating undesirable complications by the irradiation of healthy 
tissue. Conventional radiation therapy machines have been using collimation 
and shaping techniques to be able to conform to the tumor shape. Downstream 
from the beam source, sets of high atomic-number metal, such as tungsten, are 
used to shape the X-ray field into rectangular shapes with different sizes. These 
collimators (commonly referred to as jaws) usually remain stationary during 
treatment. Additional beam shaping is accomplished through the use of a com-
bination of these jaws and secondary custom beam blocks attached to the treat-
ment head downstream from the collimators.
More recent RT machines have been using computer control to change 
the position of the jaws from one treatment field to another. The next ad-
vancement was to replace the field-shaping beam blocks with the MLCs. They 
consist of a large number of collimating shielding blocks or leaves that can 
be driven automatically, independent of each other, to generate a field of any 
shape, conforming the beam to each patient’s tumor and, thus, sparing normal 
tissues. The MLCs have benefited many hospitals offering radiation treatments. 
They save time and cost compared to the use of specially shaped beam blocks. 
Additionally, the patient setup time has decreased, allowing greater patient 
throughput. Similar to the jaws, the leaves are made of high atomic-number 
metal, such as tungsten. Figure 5.8 shows a schematic simplified representation 
of the MLC and its position downstream from the two sets of jaws (the upper 
jaws, or Y-jaws, and the lower jaws, or X-jaws). Only a few leaves are shown and 
one of the Y-jaws has been omitted for clarity [11].
The larger the number of leaves and the smaller the width of each leaf, the 
more closely the radiation field at treatment will conform with the contour of 
the field specified in the treatment plan and the smoother that contour can be. 
For this reason, the number of leaves has been increasing and their width has 
been decreasing. Typically MLCs used to have 20 to 80 leaves and a width of 1 

106 
RF Linear Accelerators for Medical and Industrial Applications 
 
cm. More advanced MLCs now have 120 to 160 leaves and a width of 5 mm. 
I list here two examples: 
1.	 One example of an MLC is the Millennium MLC offered by Varian 
Medical Systems. One of the options has the following characteristics: 
120-leaf collimator, field size 40 × 40 cm, and a 5-mm leaf width 
(projected at isocenter). (See Figure 5.9 [12].)
2.	 Siemens offers different types of MLC, including the 160 MLC™ 
Multileaf Collimator. It has 160 leaves, each has the width of 5 mm 
(projected at isocenter). (See Figure 5.10 [7].)
5.6.2  Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT)
The computer-controlled MLC discussed above is an essential tool to modulate 
X-ray beams for IMRT as a means of providing dose distributions that conform 
to target volumes. Through the use of IMRT, the radiation oncologist is capable 
of increasing the radiation dose to the areas that need it and reduce radiation 
exposure to specific sensitive areas of the surrounding normal tissue. MLC are 
used in conjunction with elaborate computer programs that calculate the re-
Figure 5.8  A simplified schematic showing the MLC as the third set of collimators. (From: 
[11].)

quired number of beams and angles of the radiation treatment and determine 
the sequence of leaf positions used to produce the desired modulation. In the 
IMRT technique, the radiation beam can be looked at as if it is broken up into 
many beamlets, and the intensity of each beamlet can be adjusted individually. 
The MLCs can be stationary or can move during treatment, allowing the inten-
sity of the radiation beams to change during treatment sessions. The sequence

108 
RF Linear Accelerators for Medical and Industrial Applications 
 
of treatment field segments adds up to the desired dose distribution. This kind 
of dose modulation allows different areas of a tumor or nearby tissues to receive 
different doses of radiation. 
Figure 5.11 shows a simplified example of IMRT. The treatment is com-
prised of five treatment fields at different angles. Each field is the sum of three 
segments.
5.6.3  Adaptive Radiation Therapy (ART)
The position of the tumor and its shape can change during a patient’s radiation 
therapy sessions or throughout the course of treatment, which can be a few 
weeks long. Some of the sources of variations are: 
1.	 Tumor shrinkage;
2.	 Weight loss or gain;
3.	 Changes in hollow organ or cavity filling;
4.	 Respiratory motion of the lung and adjacent organs.
Because of new advancements in RT, adaptive radiation therapy can 
handle these variations. ART is basically a closed-loop process in which the 
treatment plan can be modified using a systematic feedback of measurements 
that confirm the precise position of the patient’s tumor during the individual 
session and over the course of therapy. This requires the accurate determination 
of the position of the target tissues. This is done by the implantation of what 
are known as fiducial markers, or the use of imaging techniques, such as CT and 
MV or KV X-ray imaging. Also, it is important to verify the actual delivered 
Figure 5.11  A simplified example of IMRT.

 
Role of Linear Accelerators in Cancer Radiation Therapy 
109
dose of radiation in each session. There are multiple RT delivery systems that 
combine the imaging with radiation. ART thus allows the radiation oncologist 
to increase the amount of radiation that can be delivered to the tumor while 
reducing the risk of excess radiation of tissues surrounding or near to the tumor. 
Two examples of these systems are Accuray’s Hi-Art® TomoTherapy system 
and the CyberKnife® system; both are covered in the following section.
5.7  Image-Guided Radiation Therapy (IGRT)
The success of cancer radiation therapy delivery is founded on maximizing the 
radiation dose to the tumor while minimizing the effects of radiation on the 
surrounding tissue. This is most critical when the tumor’s surroundings include 
sensitive tissues and organs such as eyes, spinal cord, or lungs. Achieving this 
objective is very dependent on the accuracy and precision of dose delivery. One 
of the recent advancement in RT dose delivery techniques to achieve the im-
proved accuracy and precision is IGRT. 
5.7.1  Need for IGRT and Treatment Verification
As mentioned before, radiation therapy for most patients involves a series of 
RT sessions administered, typically, for five days per week for as long as five or 
six weeks. During those weeks the patient can gain or lose weight. Also, the ac-
curacy of treatment can be compromised by patient’s motion between sessions 
(such as changes in how the patient is positioned on the treatment couch from 
one session to the next) or during the treatment session (for example movement 
due to pain or breathing motion). IGRT is a technique that is used in combina-
tion with other methods, including CRT and IMRT to improve the accuracy of 
treatment and compensate for sources of variation in the tumor position during 
treatment. IGRT is based upon the concept of incorporating one of the imag-
ing tools into the radiation treatment machine in order to improve the target-
ing accuracy of radiation therapy and ensure that the patient will be in exactly 
the same position every day relative to the machine delivering the treatment. 
Different techniques are used to implement the IGRT efficiently. We cover in 
this section two of the recently developed examples representing RT machines. 
These are the TomoTherapy®unit—the Hi-Art® and the CyberKnife®. They 
are both produced by Accuray and both represent RT machines that are inher-
ently IGRT systems. Before we discuss these recent techniques, let us first re-
view some of the techniques that have been developed over the last few decades 
to improve imaging and treatment verification. 

110 
RF Linear Accelerators for Medical and Industrial Applications 
 
5.7.2  Portal Films
In the beginning, the only method that was commonly available for verifica-
tion of the proper positioning of the patient was the use of the megavoltage 
treatment beam and radiographic film, known as a portal film, to produce a 
radiograph once the patient was positioned on the treatment couch [13]. The 
primary purpose of port filming is to verify the treatment volume under actual 
condition of treatment. It provides only a minimal level of detail about the pa-
tient’s position based on bony landmarks, and cannot visualize tumors within 
soft tissues. The image quality with the megavoltage X-ray beam (especially for 
photon energies greater than 6 MV) is poorer than the diagnostic KV X-rays, 
which offer higher contrast for soft-tissue. Other limitations of portal film in-
clude the delay in viewing because of the time required for processing; in many 
cases, it is actually impractical to do port films for each treatment. 
5.7.3  Electronic Portal Imaging Devices
Many different devices have been explored since the early 1980s as alternatives 
to portal films, and a few were eventually implemented. As a result, these days 
more and more of the radiographic films are being replaced with electronic portal 
imaging devices (EPIDs), which overcome some of the shortcomings discussed 
above. With the EPID it is possible to view the portal images instantaneously 
on a computer screen, providing real time, digital feedback. Daily imaging for 
treatment localization and verification are becoming more feasible [13]. These 
images can then be stored for later viewing, distribution, or archiving. EPIDs 
are typically attached onto the gantry on the opposite side of the isocenter rela-
tive to the radiation source.
5.7.3.1  TV Camera-Based EPIDs
One of the common electronic portal imaging approaches is based on the use 
of a TV camera. In this video-based system, the beam transmitted through the 
patient excites a metal fluorescent screen. A front-silvered mirror, placed diago-
nally, reflects the fluorescent light by 90o into the video camera, as shown in 
Figure 5.12. The images are acquired and digitized, and the data can be further 
processed to improve the image quality.
5.7.3.2  Flat-Panel EPIDs
One of the recent developments in the EPIDs is the use of an imaging system–
based amorphous silicon flat-panel comprised of arrays of photodiodes. Within 
this unit, a scintillating screen converts the X-ray incident on it to visible light. 
The light generated by the X-ray converter (scintillator) is detected by the array 
of photodiodes implanted on the amorphous silicon panel (see Figure 5.13) 
[14]. The photodiodes integrate the light into charge captures that can be dis-

charged during readout, allowing a current to flow from the photodiodes to the 
external circuit.
The flat panel-based system has superior image resolution compared to 
the video-based systems. This helped improve the efficiency and the overall 
quality IGRT and treatment verification.

RF Linear Accelerators for Medical and Industrial Applications 
 
5.7.4  Tomotherapy
Tomotherapy a is term derived from tomography and therapy. Literally, it means 
slice therapy. TomoTherapy® machines built by Accuray Inc. combine the pre-
cision of CT and the capabilities of IMRT into a single radiation therapy unit, 
known as the Hi-Art® system. This makes it a truly IGRT machine. 
Two possible approaches can be used to achieve both the imaging and the 
therapy beam delivery. The first approach uses a megavoltage X-ray radiation 
source, a linac, for therapy and a kilovoltage X-ray source for the CT imaging. 
In the second approach the linac is used as the source of radiation for both the 
treatment phase as well as the CT imaging. 
The first approach is shown schematically, as an artist’s conception, in 
Figure 5.14. The machine consists of a CT-like gantry with a kilovoltage X-ray 
source and a linac both rotating around the patient. There are two detectors: 
one for the KV beam and one for the MV beam. The linac’s megavoltage x-ray 
beam is used to deliver the IMRT treatment [15, 16].
The inclusion of an onboard kilovoltage CT expands the possibility of 
planning, positioning, and verification. However, the use of onboard kilovolt-
age X-ray source increases the cost and complexity of the unit. For this reason 
the Hi-Art® shown in Figure 5.15 implements the second approach, namely, 
using the linac as the source of radiation for both treatment and imaging phases.

apy machine.

During the treatment the patient is translated in a precise, controlled way, 
using a couch that moves in synchronism with the gantry rotation to realize 
helical delivery. Figure 5.16 illustrates the concept of helical beam delivery.

114 
RF Linear Accelerators for Medical and Industrial Applications 
 
TomoTherapy® uses a two-step process that incorporates image-guided 
targeting of the tumor together with radiation treatment in one seamless pro-
gression. The two-step process usually takes about 15 minutes and is as follows:
1.	 Image-guided positioning. Before each treatment, a CT image is ac-
quired on the TomoTherapy® unit. This localizes a patient’s anatomy 
(identifies the tumor size and shape) and verifies the target location 
against previously stored CT images, resulting in a high accuracy of 
pretreatment positioning and tumor targeting. If the tumor size or 
shape changes, then treatment parameters can be modified to adapt to 
these changes.
2.	 Treatment delivery. After the targeting procedure has verified the target 
location, the TomoTherapy Hi-Art System® uses a helical 360o rotat-
ing beam of radiation, whereby the intensity of the radiation treat-
ment beam is continuously modulated to conform to the shape of the 
tumor while minimizing radiation exposure to vital structures that 
may be nearby.
5.7.5  Robotic Radiosurgery: CyberKnife®
The CyberKnife® [16,17] is a radiosurgery system designed to treat well-de-
fined tumors. It is most often used to treat malignancies located in the brain, 
spine, head, and neck. However, more recently, this RT machine has been suc-
cessfully used to treat tumors at different parts of the body. 
The CyberKnife® made by Accuray Inc. [16] uses image guidance and a 
robot to achieve the precision of delivery, and thus it is particularly useful for 
tumors that are close to critical structures. The system’s X-ray cameras monitor 
movement during treatment by tracking small markers implanted in the tumor 
or by tracking the body’s skeletal structures. The robotic arm is fitted with a lin-
ac and can aim many small radiation beams at the tumor from multiple differ-
ent angles (see Figure 5.17). This allows the radiation oncologist to give a high 
radiation dose to the tumor and at the same time maintain a low radiation dose 
to the surrounding normal tissues. The robotic arm automatically compensates 
for any movement to ensure accurate delivery of each radiation beam. The linac 
used can fit in the robotic arm because it operates in the X-band frequency 
range (8–12 GHz). This makes the linac smaller in length and volume and 
uses a smaller magnetron compared with most linacs used in radiation therapy, 
which operate in the S-band frequency range (2–4 GHz).

 
Role of Linear Accelerators in Cancer Radiation Therapy 
115
5.8  Stereotactic Radiosurgery
Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), also known as stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT), 
is a technique that allows the radiation oncologist to precisely focus beams of 
radiation to destroy certain types of tumors, both benign and malignant. It 
delivers high doses of radiation to small tumors with well-defined edges. The 
SRS delivers radiation therapy in fewer sessions than the conventional RT. It 
uses smaller radiation fields that can be delivered in just one session or in a 
few sessions. Because of the high dose delivered in each session, SRS units use 
extremely accurate image-guided tumor targeting and precision patient-posi-
tioning systems. This is done sometimes with the help of rigid immobilizing de-
vices, such as with a head frame in the treatment of brain tumors. Examples of 
SRS systems are the CyberKnife®, discussed above, and the Gamma Knife™, 
which we discuss next. 
5.8.1  Gamma Knife™  Radiosurgery
The Gamma Knife™, shown in Figure 5.18, is one example of radiosurgery 
machines [18]. It is typically used for treating brain tumors by accurately focus-
ing many beams of high-intensity gamma radiation to converge on the targeted 
tumor (see Figure 5.19). Each individual beam is of relatively low intensity, so 
the radiation has little effect on intervening brain tissue and is concentrated 
only at the tumor itself. This machine typically contains 201 cobalt 60 sources 
Figure 5.17  Accuray’s CyberKnife System®. (Courtesy of Accuray.)

placed in a circular array in a heavily shielded assembly. The patient wears a spe-
cial helmet that is surgically fixed to the skull, so that the brain tumor remains 
stationary at the target point of the gamma rays. Thus, the tumor receives a sub-
stantial dose of radiation, while surrounding brain tissues are relatively spared.

Role of Linear Accelerators in Cancer Radiation Therapy 
117
5.9  Intraoperative Radiation Therapy
Intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) is the use of radiation therapy during 
a surgical procedure. In this special RT technique, a radiation dose is delivered 
in a single session to a surgically exposed internal tumor bed after the removal 
of the tumor by a surgeon. Thus it allows the delivery of high radiation doses, 
which can be as high as 10 Gy, to a tumor while sparing the nearby normal tis-
sues. During the surgical procedure, the surgeon shows the radiation oncologist 
the areas of the tumor bed where tiny fragments of tumor may remain. After 
the surgeon removes most or all the visible parts of a tumor, there is always 
the chance that microscopic cells are left behind in the tumor bed. These cells 
would most likely repopulate the tumor mass and eventually causing recurrence 
of cancer. Before the delivery of radiation, the sensitive normal tissues are either 
shielded or displaced out of the radiation field, and then the radiation oncolo-
gist directs a single high dose of radiation to the area most at risk for residual 
disease. 
Because the target area is exposed, electron beam radiation is more suit-
able for IORT than X-ray radiation. IntraOp Medical Corporation (Santa 
Clara, CA) has developed a dedicated IORT machine, the Mobetron [19]. The 
Mobetron is a mobile unit dedicated for IORT that produces only electron 
beams and can be moved among several operating rooms. Figure 5.20, shows 
the Mobetron. 
The accelerator system in the Mobetron consists of two collinear linacs. 
Each linac is of the standing wave-type operating at 9.3 GHz. The use of X-
band technology in the Mobetron [20] makes its linacs significantly lighter 
and smaller than S-band linacs used in most of the conventional RT machines. 
The Mobetron treatment head houses the X-band linacs, the magnetron, the 
modulator, RF loads, the circulator, and other RF circuitry. The beam stopper 
shown in Figure 5.20, above, is an integral part of the Mobetron and is always 
positioned to intercept the bremsstrahlung radiation generated in the forward 
direction of the electron beam. The unit can produce electron beams with four 
nominal energies of 4, 6, 9, and 12 MeV at two dose rate settings (250 cGy/
min and 1,000 cGy/min). 
The small size of the X-band SW linac used in the Mobetron allows for 
lead shielding that is placed inside the treatment head. However, as an addi-
tional precaution to avoid the exposure of the surgical and oncology staff to any 
radiation leakage, the staff leaves the surgical suit for the few minutes during the 
application of the dose. The control of the dose is done through a controlling 
unit placed outside the operating room while monitoring the patient through a 
glass window and TV cameras.

5.10  Concluding Remarks
The RT linac application covered in this chapter represents one of the classic 
examples of how a device that was initially developed for basic research, the RF 
linac, had made its way to hospitals and oncology centers to offer a significant 
contribution in the fight against cancer. As was presented in this chapter, in ad-
dition to the availability of the linac, it took a succession of new ideas and new 
technologies especially in the field of medical imaging to develop the current 
radiation therapy machines. These advanced RT units are now capable of se-
lectively targeting tumors with great precision in three dimensions or even four 
dimensions (with time/motion being the fourth dimension).
A growing number of research centers are working on developing the up-
and-coming field of particle therapy, which uses protons or carbon ions instead 
of X-rays to target cancerous tumors. The chief advantage of particle therapy is 
the ability to more precisely localize the radiation dosage when compared with 
the conventional RT using X-rays. We discuss particle therapy in Chapter 6.

Accelerator-Based Industrial 
Applications
It is a fact that the original motivation for scientists and engineers to build high-
energy accelerators was to probe deeper into the structure of matter. However, 
eventually accelerators became the enabling technology for many industrial 
applications. Thanks to technology (and also people) transfer from research 
centers and national laboratories to industry in several countries around world, 
we now have multiple established industries and commercial markets based on 
the use of accelerators. In this chapter, I try to give you, the reader, a glimpse 
at some of uses of electron beams and X-rays in manufacturing of many of our 
everyday-life products. 
6.1  Use of Accelerators in Material Processing
The largest industrial use of electron-beam (EB) accelerators is for material pro-
cessing. Radiation has been used for more than 50 years to improve both bulk 
and surface properties of polymer resins. Originally the radiation-processing 
source had been based on a radioactive source, such as cobalt 60. However, 
electron-beam accelerators offer much higher dose rate and are generally a more 
cost effective way of delivering dose to the product. The electron-beam linac 
lends itself to more efficient movement of the product in front of the radia-
tion source and offers more flexibility. Additionally, EB units do not face the 
security, transportation, and disposal issues that confront the use of radioactive 
isotopes. It is estimated that there are more than 1,400 high-current EB units 
in commercial use around the world providing an estimated added value to nu-
merous products of more than $85 billion US [1]. This industrial application is 

122 
RF Linear Accelerators for Medical and Industrial Applications 
 
based upon the use of accelerated electron beams for the modification of poly-
mers by cross-linking, which is basically joining one polymer chain to another 
to form three-dimensional chemical links between adjacent polymer segments. 
Cross-linking renders materials with enhanced properties and characteristics 
better than the original non-cross-linked materials. 
One example of EB cross-linking end-use applications is the implemen-
tation of the electron beam in the curing of rubber. A second example, which 
makes up a large share of the electron-beam market, is the cross-linking of 
heat-shrinkable films, most widely used in food packaging. Such films extend 
the shelf life of meat, produce, poultry and dairy products, and provide tam-
per-resistant packaging. Other examples of the utilization of high-current in-
dustrial EB accelerators include surface curing, polymeric precursors used in 
inks, coatings, and adhesives, insulation on electrical wires, and heat-shrinkable 
tubing for protecting wire and cable connections, making these products more 
flame-retardant. 
6.1.1  Electron Beam Current and Energy Requirements
In material processing applications of industrial electron beams, we need to de-
sign and control two fundamental properties of the accelerated electron beam. 
The first requirement is concerned with the accelerator beam current. High 
beam current is desired in industrial linacs because it permits the irradiated 
product to be exposed to the required dose in a shorter time. Thus, the moving 
conveyer (carrying the product being processed) can be moved at faster speeds 
transverse the beam and hence achieves more product throughput. The second 
requirement is the beam’s energy needed to match the type of industrial appli-
cation. Electrons’ penetration into materials are limited by their energy and by 
the density of the material being processed. Figure 6.1 shows the distribution 
of the absorbed dose (the energy deposited) for beam energies between 1.0 and 
5.0 MeV at different depths (in centimeters of water) as derived from computer 
simulations [2]. In order to be able to use this curve for different materials, the 
absorbed dose is described as the normalized energy deposition. It is the energy 
deposited, divided by the normalized depth. Note that the normalized depth is 
the depth multiplied by density and thus its unit then is cm Xg/cm3 = g/cm2. 
Thus the normalized energy deposited is measured in MeV over the normalized 
depth, and its unit is then MeV cm2/g. 
From the graph in Figure 6.1, we can see that the higher the beam energy, 
the deeper the penetration. Thus for different EB processing application, the 
manufacturer should choose the accelerator with the appropriate beam energy. 
Table 6.1 [1] lists some of the EB applications, their typical beam penetra-
tion requirements, and the corresponding electron energy range to realize such 
depths of deposition. An example of a 10 MeV EB industrial linac used in 

 
Accelerator-Based Industrial Applications 
123
processing (produced by MEVEX, in Canada) is shown in Figure 6.2 [3]. Note 
the beam fan-out provision (the scan horn) used to create a “shower” or “cur-
tain” of directed electron beam, thus covering relatively large areas of the mate-
rial to be irradiated.
It is to be noted that electron beams cross in air for processing and suf-
fer some scattering from colliding with air molecules. However, these effects 
are normally taken into consideration in designing the EB processing system, 
including the dose rate used and the distance between the scan horn and the 
conveyer carrying the product to be processed.
6.1.2  Main Applications for Polymer EB Cross-Linking
6.1.2.1  Surface Curing
Electron-beam processing is an effective surface curing technique especially 
when dealing with high-volume throughput on a continuous basis. Electrons in

EB curing affect chemicals that are added to cure inks and coatings, often more 
quickly and less costly than by other methods. 
In EB curing surface coatings, the electron beam penetrates down to the 
substrate irrespective of pigment color. The energy of the electron beam deter-
mines its depth of penetration into the product. For curing of thin coatings, a 
low-energy beam (less than 1 MeV) is satisfactory. However, for thicker prod-
ucts, including bulk polymers in open trays or on continuous belts, a medium-
energy (1 to 5 MeV) or a high-energy beam (5 to 10 MeV) would be required.
Both the ultraviolet (UV) and EB curing processes are types of radiation 
that have been used extensively in surface curing. They both provide the energy 
needed to polymerize and solidify the dilutant in the coating material. This 
reactive dilutant is used to provide the viscosity needed to easily apply the coat-
ing. EB surface curing has certain advantages over other alternative manufactur-
ing processes, as follows:
1.	 In the EB processing, the energy is delivered directly to the polymers 
being cured not through heat applied externally. Energy emitted from 
an EB unit is directly absorbed in the coating and causes the chemical 
changes that convert a liquid coating into a dried and cured mate-
rial. Thus it is an efficient process for coating operations that helps 
the manufacturing facilities in reducing their energy consumption. 
The energy efficiency of EB processing can be contrasted with con-
ventional uses of solvent drying or water-based technologies. When 
comparing the energy demand needed to dry a water-borne coating, 
EB curing would require two orders of magnitude less energy to attain 
comparable properties. 
2.	 In the EB surface curing technologies, the products do not lose any 
mass through evaporation and thus avoid volatile organic compounds 
Figure 6.2  A 10 MeV industrial linac from Mevex. 

 
Accelerator-Based Industrial Applications 
125
(VOCs) that can be created as a result of other alternative manufactur-
ing processes. This feature is particularly important with the increas-
ing awareness by manufacturers of the effects of greenhouse gas emis-
sions and their efforts to reduce air pollution. 
3.	 Because electron beam processing is not a thermal means of energy 
transfer and takes place at near-ambient temperatures, EB drying of 
inks can be used on heat-sensitive substrates, such as plastic films, 
minimizing concerns over film distortion. The EB technique is also 
used on a variety of substrates with low heat requirements necessary to 
achieve a certain finish.
4.	 Some of the above useful features are shared with UV curing. How-
ever, an advantage to EB surface curing and cross-linking of coatings 
over the use of ultraviolet radiation is that electrons have the ability to 
penetrate pigments, whereas UV does not. 
6.1.2.2  Wire and Cable Insulation and Heat-Shrinkable Films
One of the applications of the electron beam cross-linking is in the manufac-
turing of the insulation jacketing on wires and cables. Cross-linking prevents 
insulation from dripping off an over-heated wire, as could result from a short 
circuit, or when exposed to the high heat of an automotive engine or even a fire. 
Normally, there are specialized fixtures to transport the wire under the electron 
beam using multiple passes. The entire process can run at several hundred me-
ters per minute [4].
EB cross-linking of heat-shrinkable films makes up a large share of the 
electron-beam market. Such films extend the shelf life of meat, produce, poul-
try and dairy products, and provide tamper-resistant packaging. Some of the 
advantages of EB treatment of flexible packaging are: 
• No Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) or emissions;
• Instant drying at high production speeds;
• High chemical resistance;
• High abrasion resistance;
• High gloss;
• No softening after curing;
• Low odor and off-taste.
6.1.2.3  Tire Rubber Treatment
The tire industry uses electron-beam to treat its rubber. The rubber is extruded 
and then irradiated to produce chemical cross-links between polymer chains, 

126 
RF Linear Accelerators for Medical and Industrial Applications 
 
bringing them to a gel state. In that gelled state, the elastomers (elastic poly-
mers) gain more elasticity as the chains stretch under stress and retract on re-
lease of the stress. This makes the rubber tougher than the noncured rubber 
and prevents tire cord distortion or strike-through during subsequent molding 
operations [5]. The ability to tightly control electron beam exposure enables 
tire manufacturers to only partially cure or cross-link elastomers to the degree 
desired.
6.1.2.4  Gemstone Irradiation
Electron beam irradiation is used to alter the color of some gemstones so as to 
enhance their commercial value. An example of frequently irradiated gemstones 
is topaz. Its linac-irradiated material becomes an attractive “sky blue” after sub-
sequent heat treatment of the greenish or brownish product. Other gemstones 
that are irradiated for similar effect are: rubellite, quartz, citrine, amethysts, and 
even diamonds. Since very high doses are often required, care is taken not to 
overheat the gems while they are being irradiated. High temperatures can cause 
undesirable changes in the color of the stones, while thermal shock will crack 
or shatter them. For this reason, the gem materials are water-cooled to prevent 
elevated temperatures and thermal shocks. Also, some gems must be set aside 
for weeks or even months to allow for the decay of any induced radioactivity, as 
small as it may be [6]. 
6.1.3  Industrial Material Processing Using X-Ray Radiation
In addition to providing electron beams for material processing, accelerators 
are also used as sources of X-rays for industrial processing of materials. The 
availability of high-current accelerators made it possible to produce X-rays with 
dose-rates compatible with industrial applications. The dose-rate for such ap-
plications is more than 3 orders of magnitude larger than those used for the 
cancer radiation therapy discussed in Chapter 5. X-rays, as with gamma rays, 
can penetrate an order of magnitude deeper than the typical penetration of 
commercial electron-beam sources. Since these commercial X-ray sources are 
generated by accelerators, they share the advantage of EB processing units over 
the gamma-ray sources, as we discussed before. We show in Figure 6.3 a com-
parison of typical penetrations between gamma rays from a cobalt 60 source, 
an EB unit (10 MeV accelerator), and an X-ray unit (7.5 MeV accelerator) [7]. 
Note that the depth here is the normalized depth (density X depth), and thus 
its unit is g/cm2. Similar to the industrial EB units, the commercial accelerators 
producing X-rays for material processing are normally designed for acceleration 
energies below 10 MeV to avoid inducing radioactivity in the materials being 
processed.

 
Accelerator-Based Industrial Applications 
127
The greater depth of penetration of X-rays allows for treatment of prod-
ucts with large volumes, such as pallet loads of packaged medical devices and 
food. Since the X-ray irradiation is not accompanied by a significant rise of 
temperature of the product being sterilized, it eliminates adverse effects on ma-
terials due to heat. Thus it is suitable for temperature-sensitive products, such 
as frozen food. 
6.2  Sterilization of Medical Products and Food Irradiation
As early as the end of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth 
century, it was realized that the “newly discovered” X-ray radiation (discovered 
by W. C. Röntgen in 1895) would kill microorganisms. However, the use of 
this fact had to wait for more than a half century before it started to find com-
mercial application in sterilization and disinfection. Nowadays, electron beams 
and X-rays derived from electron-beam systems are used in the sterilization of 
medical products as well as preservation of food products in many countries 
around the world.
6.2.1  Medical Product Sterilization
Conventional sterilization techniques for medical equipment have mainly used 
gases, such as the ethylene oxide (Et O), high-pressure steam (autoclave ster-
ilization), or gamma rays. Ethylene oxide gas leaves toxic residue on sterilized 
items, so a lengthy purging process usually follows it. The autoclave sterilization 
is unsuitable for heat-sensitive objects. Accelerators offer effective alternative 
sterilization techniques. Either a beam of electrons or X-rays can be used, but 
EB sterilization is used more commonly than the X-rays. It is a safe and reliable 
method for sterilization, especially for disposable medical products. It offers a 
cost-effective and high throughput alternative by sterilizing medical products 
Figure 6.3  Comparing material penetration for EB, gamma rays, and X-rays.

128

in their final packaging with no hazardous chemicals used in the process. It has 
the fundamental advantage over the gamma sources in that the EB unit can be 
turned on or off, as required with no need for radioactive waste disposal issues. 
Accelerators used for EB sterilization produce electron beams with energies up 
to 10 MeV. Many of the packaged devices have a low bulk density so that the 
penetration of electrons is sufficient. If needed, packages can be irradiated from 
two sides, thereby increasing the beam penetration to more than double the 
single-beam penetration by taking advantage of the overlap of the tail ends of 
the two depth-dose profiles, as shown in Figure 6.4. To attain more uniform 
dose distributions in large pallet loads of packaged products, a turntable can be 
used to rotate the pallet in front of the EB accelerator scan horn.
Figure 6.5 shows a 10 MeV electron beam accelerator produced by L-3 [8] 
and used for sterilization of medical products. Such a linac would be installed in 
a special facility shielded with thick concrete walls, as shown in the computer-
generated model in Figure 6.6. The shielding requirements and specifications 
of such facilities are similar to those discussed in Chapter 3 of this book in the 
Figure 6.4  Benefit of applying irradiation from two opposite sides.

section that covers linac high-power testing. It is to be noted that the shielding 
walls have been cut away in the figure to show the path of the conveyer.
6.2.2  Electron Beam Food Processing by Irradiation
Similar to the sterilization of medical products described above, the electron 
beams and X-rays generated by linac systems are used in the preservation of 
food products. This ionizing radiation is capable of eliminating food-borne 
pathogens such as Escherichia coli (E. coli), Salmonella, and Listeria, from meats, 
poultry, and other food products, and can also disinfect grains, spices, and ani-
mal feed.
Although there are several food decontamination methods, irradiation 
is considered a high throughput, environmentally clean, and energy-efficient 
process. One unique feature of radiation decontamination is that it can also be 
performed when the food is in a frozen state.
6.2.2.1  Required Doses for Food Irradiation
It is important to ensure that food is exposed to enough doses to achieve the 
required results, and at the same time, that the dose is within the permissible 
limits. For this reason the dose should be measured precisely and routinely. 
The absorbed dose in a product depends upon the intensity of radiation, the 
distance from source, speed of conveyer, and the characteristics of the product 
being irradiated. Table 6.2 shows different food irradiation applications and the 
Figure 6.6  A model for a sterilization facility for medical products by L-3 [8].

130 
RF Linear Accelerators for Medical and Industrial Applications 
 
doses used [9]. In order to achieve some of these doses, it is required sometimes 
to use two sources from both sides of the conveyer carrying the food containers, 
as explained in Section 6.2.1 and as shown in Figure 6.4.
6.2.2.2  Acceptance of Irradiated Foods
It is an unfortunate fact that the pathogens found in the food supply chain, such 
as Listeria, Salmonella, and E. coli, have been causing illnesses and deaths and 
have resulted in major recalls of foods by producers. It is also a fact that today we 
have available to us diverse and powerful food processing technologies, such as 
food irradiation, that can help prevent food-borne illnesses. However, there are 
still some regulatory roadblocks to food irradiation in several countries, in addi-
tion to the controversial stigma of radiation issues that somewhat affect consum-
er acceptance and, hence, the growth in the EB irradiation market. It is hoped 
that further public awareness will overcome these barriers in the near future.
6.2.3  Mechanism of Killing Pathogens
The effectiveness of EB or X-rays in sterilization and food decontamination 
processes stems from the role of ionizing radiation in killing harmful micro-
organisms by breaking the double strand of the DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) 
[10]. DNA’s double helix encompasses long chain molecules that are also held

together by hydrogen bonding as shown in Figure 6.7. The molecular architec-
ture of DNA is self-replicating and, thus, forms the basis of life and genetic en-
coding. The ionizing radiation generates both free radicals and, in the presence 
of water, a constituent of all living matter, highly reactive short-lived hydroxyl 
radicals. Both can lead to the breaking of single- and double-strand, as well 
as intra-strand cross-links, thus damaging the DNA. With but a few double-
strand breaks, the DNA would be no longer able to repair or replicate itself. 
Thus ionizing radiation can be effective in eliminating pathogens, such as a 
bacterium or fungus, that can contaminate medical and food products.
6.3  Environmental Applications of Accelerators
Some of the emerging applications for radiation processing can benefit the 
environment by reducing water and gas pollutants. Radiation processing can 
remediate polluted waters wastewater in a nonchemical safe way. Flue gas treat-
ment based on electron beam technology can help to mitigate environmental 
degradation.
6.3.1  Wastewater Treatment
Rapid population growth and increased industrial development have led to the 
generation of large quantities of polluted industrial and municipal wastewaters. 
In addition to the conventional wastewater treatment techniques, researchers 
in several countries around the world have been recently developing techniques 
Figure 6.7  DNA double helix.

132 
RF Linear Accelerators for Medical and Industrial Applications 
 
that employ ionizing radiation for wastewater and industrial waste treatment, 
reduction of sewage sludge sanitary contamination, and solid agriculture waste 
transformation [11–13]. Radiation treatment techniques are capable of degrad-
ing water pollutants at a rate faster than conventional treatment techniques. 
The ionizing radiation can be produced by the use of a gamma radiation source, 
such as cobalt 60 (60Co) or Cesium 137 (137Cs), or the use of an accelerator gen-
erating a high-energy electron beam. Because of advantage mentioned in other 
sections of this chapter, the EB-based units are at the present time used more 
than the radioactive isotope gamma sources.
Water is not normally reactive, but when it is subjected to ionizing radia-
tion, it produces highly reactive species. As the high-energy electrons impact 
flowing polluted water, the electrons slow down, lose energy, and react with the 
water to produce three reactive species (hydrated electrons, hydroxyl radicals, 
and hydrogen atoms) that are responsible for organic compounds’ destruction. 
These short-lived radicals drive both oxidation and reduction reactions at the 
same time. High-energy electron beam irradiation is the only process that is 
capable of forming both highly oxidizing and highly reducing reactive species in 
aqueous solutions at the same time and in approximately the same concentra-
tions. Furthermore, no other advanced oxidation process has the capability of 
generating as high an overall free-radical yield per unit of energy input and in a 
controlled way as high-energy electron beam treatment. 
To insure the effectiveness of the EB treatment, the delivery system at 
the EB-wastewater interaction zone should provide for uniform dose distribu-
tion as well as delivery of large amounts of wastewater for EB exposure. Three 
different schemes for wastewater delivery to the interaction zone are shown in 
Figure 6.8 [13]. 
We can see that radiation water processing offers the following advantages:
1.	 Strong reducing and oxidizing agents;
2.	 Process controllability;
3.	 Compatibility with conventional methods.
Since radiation treatment technology represents a viable solution to the 
problem of wastewater treatment, several countries have already taken the ini-
tiative of implementing electron beam in the irradiation of wastewater. Ex-
amples are in the Russian Federation [14], the Republic of Korea [15], the 
United States [16], and Brazil [17]. It is expected that the spread of use of this 
technology will provide the impetus for the accelerator industry to produce 
linacs specially designed for this application. It is hoped that the increase in 
number of units produced would help the cost of such technology to decline to 
a level that makes it affordable and economically attractive to many countries. 

 
Accelerator-Based Industrial Applications 
133
This can have a large impact in countries in which water is in short supply and 
which can benefit from the reusage of treated wastewater for irrigation.
6.3.2  EB Treatment of Flue Gases—Reduction of Acid Rain
Power plants that are using coal and oil to generate electricity and run factories 
around the world are also producing acid rain by emitting sulfur and nitrogen 
oxides. These gases are converted to sulfuric and nitric acids in the atmosphere 
by reactions with water vapor activated by ultraviolet radiation from the sun. 
Figure 6.8  Different schemes for EB-wastewater interaction.

134 
RF Linear Accelerators for Medical and Industrial Applications 
 
There are several conventional technologies for treating flue gases, which 
are aimed at controlling the emission of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrous ox-
ides (NOx ) into the environment. Some of these technologies are the wet, dry, 
and semi-dry flue gas desulphurization (FGD) and selective catalytic reduction 
(SCR). These conventional gas-cleaning technologies are complex chemical 
processes that result in the generation of wastewater and undesired byproducts. 
These drawbacks can be avoided with the use of the EB technology to treat flue 
gases [13, 18–21].
The EB flue gas processing is based on the formation of acid vapors under 
controlled conditions within the power plant. These acidic gases can then be 
neutralized by injecting ammonia vapor to produce fine particles of ammo-
nium sulfate ((NH4 )2 SO4 ) and ammonium nitrate (NH4 NO3 ), which can 
be removed from the gas stream by conventional collectors such as electrostatic 
precipitators (ESPs) or filters. A simplified diagram of EB flue gas processing is 
shown in Figure 6.9 [21]. The proof of principle of EB treatment of flue gases 
was demonstrated by Japanese scientists in the 1970s and was further developed 
to pilot and large scale facilities by researchers in Germany, Japan, Poland, Bul-
garia, China, and the United States [18]. 
The flue gas treatment using EB accelerators has several advantages over 
currently used conventional methods [21]:
1.	 It simultaneously removes sulfur dioxide and nitrous oxides efficiently;
2.	 It is a dry process that is easily controlled and has excellent load-fol-
lowing capability;
3.	 The pollutants can be converted into useful agricultural fertilizers;
4.	 The process has relatively low operating cost requirements.

6.4  Nondestructive Testing
The goal of nondestructive testing (NDT) is to determine the absence or pres-
ence of conditions or discontinuities that may have an effect on the useful-
ness or serviceability of the object under test without changing or altering that 
object. Some of the NDT techniques include the use of X-ray radiographic, 
ultrasonic, eddy current, and thermal infrared testing [22]. NDT can be an 
important part of quality control (QC) or quality assurance (QA) processes in 
the manufacturing of critical components. One example where the NDT ra-
diographic techniques are used in the manufacturing of critical components is 
the detection of flaws that could cause a malfunction in solid-propellant rocket 
motors. 
Historically, early radiographics used gamma rays from radioactive iso-
topes such as cobalt  60 (60Co), cesium 137 (137Cs), or iridium 192 (92Ir). Be-
cause of recent developments in reliable and compact linacs, linac-based NDT 
devices are replacing many of NDT devices based on radioactive isotopes [23, 
24]. NDT linacs (typically in the range of 1 MeV to 15 MeV) have the ad-
vantage of the ability to produce megavoltage X-rays. Thus, they can be used 
in the inspection of thick sections of materials that cannot be inspected using 
standard X-ray tubes, which are only capable of producing kilovoltage X-rays. 
Linac also can produce higher dose-rates resulting in improved image capability 
and shorter exposure times, thus increasing throughput and productivity. That 
is in addition to eliminating the risk and cost associated with the storage and 
the disposal of the spent radioactive material, as discussed before in other appli-
cations. Most of the NDT linacs operate in the S-band frequency range (around 
3 GHz). However, the development of higher frequency linacs operating in the 
X-band (around 9 GHz) with their small sizes made the portable radiographic 
system a reality [25–27]. The portable linac systems are used in NDT field 
inspection of pipelines, ships, bridges, and other critical civil infrastructures. 
They can also easily be moved to inspect large sections of materials in factories. 
In linacs used in the nondestructive testing, the high energy electrons 
impinge on a metallic target to be converted into X-rays by the bremsstrahlung 
process (as described Chapter 2, Section 2.5). The target is commonly made of 
a material having a high atomic number, such as tungsten, tantalum, or gold. 
The conversion efficiency of electron to X-ray is relatively low and the major-
ity of the electron beam energy (more than 90 percent) is converted into heat. 
For this reason the target has to be able to tolerate the heat and to dissipate it 
fast. Consequently, the target is normally water-cooled, and some of the NDT 
linacs use a layered target comprised of either tungsten or gold and brazed to 
copper for better heat transfer. One important parameter in the design of the 
NDT linacs is the spot size of the X-ray emerging from the target. Ideally this 

136 
RF Linear Accelerators for Medical and Industrial Applications 
 
should be as close as possible to a “point source.” However, there are design 
limitations on minimum spot size due to scattering of electrons in the target 
material. The thinner the target is, the smaller the spot size. So using “thin” 
target is recommended for NDT applications. However, it is important to en-
sure that any “unconverted” electrons that pass though the target are trapped 
in some manner, either by a magnetic field or in a low-density material such as 
carbon. Another desirable feature in the X-ray beam is to have a uniform X-ray 
field projection on the object. To achieve this, some NDT units use flattening 
filters similar to the X-ray radiation therapy machines.
Some of the NDT applications require multiple energies for complete 
inspection of a single part. Hence, a single machine with linac capable of pro-
ducing multiple energies is desirable for economic radiographic inspection of 
a wide variety of industrial products. There are several techniques that can be 
used to accomplish energy variations [28]. These include employing a mechani-
cal switch [29, 30] or an electronic switch [31] built in the linac. However, 
these add to the linac’s complexity and manufacturing costs. The following are 
two alternative ways of changing the linac energy:
Changing the RF power. As was explained in Chapter 2, the energy of the 
output X-ray in a linac system is dependent upon the strength of the ac-
celerating field in the linac used. The strength of this field is a function 
of the RF power fed into the linac. The RF power can be changed by ad-
justing the operating point of the RF source (a klystron or a magnetron) 
driving the linac. It also can be adjusted through a variable mismatch con-
nected to waveguide feeding the RF to the linac. A combination of both 
typically works best since there is a limit as to how much you can adjust 
the energy using either technique alone.
Beam loading. An alternative way to change the output energy of a linac 
is to change the electron-beam current. The beam current has a loading 
effect on the linac. When the beam current is increased, the fields in the 
linac have to do more work to accelerate the additional charge carriers, 
and this loading effectively reduces the net field in the linac. Thus, the 
output energy of the accelerated electrons is reduced. 
X-ray NDT radiography has benefited from recent developments in 
medical imaging. One example is the incorporation of the concept of com-
puted tomography (CT). There are two approaches for the implantation of 
CT scanning in NDT units. In one approach, the linac as the X-ray source and 
the detector (both on opposite sides of the inspected object) rotate around the 
inspected object. In the alternative approach, both the X-ray source and the 

 
Accelerator-Based Industrial Applications 
137
detector are stationary while the inspected object is being rotated and translated 
between the source and the detector. Many of the new advancements in NDT 
are being shared with the use of linacs for cargo inspection, and vice versa, as 
discussed in the next section.
6.5  Security and Inspection Applications
Many ports around the world rely on X-ray scanners to inspect cargo for nucle-
ar materials or weapons and to prevent contraband from entering their coun-
tries. Conventionally these have been gamma-ray scanners based on radioactive 
isotopes such as cobalt 60 or the common dc X-ray tubes. In spite of the recent 
advancement in X-ray tube technology, they still are limited in energy output 
to about 450 KeV. This energy level limits the penetration power to less than 
10 cm of steel. For this reason, an increasing number of ports are nowadays 
turning to linac-based high-energy X-rays cargo scanners. These are based on 
the same concepts as the linac-based nondestructive testing applications dis-
cussed in the previous section of this chapter (Section 6.4). In cargo inspection 
applications, linacs are used to accelerate electrons to energies of 3 to 9 MeV 
capable of producing high-energy X-rays that penetrate deep and give the port 
inspectors information about the nature of the cargo. The denser the object, 
the more the attenuation of the projected X-ray is and the darker the image 
produced for such an object. Thus, the X-ray scanner reveals the basic shapes 
of objects and differentiates between different objects inside a cargo container. 
The optimal energy needed depends on the X-ray detector used, the size of the 
cargo container to be inspected, and the overall scanning system design. How-
ever, many cargo screening system manufacturers have found that 3 to 6 MeV 
linacs produce the best tradeoff for overall performance and cost [32]. If the 
energy of the linac is below 2 MeV, the X-ray penetration is low for a densely 
loaded container. On the other hand, linacs accelerating electrons to energies 
significantly above 9 MeV would require extensive shielding and could produce 
neutrons, an undesired by-product.
Another consideration in designing linacs that are used in cargo scanners 
is the choice of the rate at which the X-rays are emitted, given that the objects 
being inspected are moving with respect to the linac-based X-ray source. Be-
cause of power considerations, linacs used in this application are pulsed linacs 
and not continuous-wave (CW) linacs. The pulses are about 4 microseconds 
long and have adjustable pulse repetition frequency (PRF) between 50 and 500 
pulses per second. Such relatively high PRF allows for reasonable speed of scan-
ning and, hence, acceptable flow of cargo without compromising the quality of 
the images.

6.5.1  Scanning Units
There are two approaches for inspecting railcars and cargo containers in high-
volume operations using the scanning unit based on linacs:
Stationary scanning units. In this inspection approach, the truck that is 
carrying the cargo container pulls up to a scanning station (which looks 
like a car wash construction) that has a linac, with the target produc-
ing the X-ray on one side and a detector on the other side. While the 
truck is moved slowly through the unit the fan of X-rays that has passed 
through the truck and its cargo is detected by a linear array of scintilla-
tion detectors. A transmission image is built up in real time, revealing 
what is inside the container. As an example, we show in Figure 6.10 a 
system built by Rapiscan Laboratories (Sunnyvale, CA). It is based on 
6 MV X-ray linac imaging system that is capable of penetration up to 
340 mm (13.9 in) in steel. This makes it possible to check the content 
of shipping containers or trucks with steel walls in the loading area. A 
linac producing higher energy X-ray would be able to reveal more clearly 
the contents of containers with more dense objects. An example is the 
Eagle F9000 system by Rapiscan, which is based on a 9 MV X-ray linac. 
Its imaging system is capable of penetrating more than 400 mm (16 in) 
of steel. In Figure 6.11 is shown a truck inside the stationary unit. The 
contents of the truck are revealed in Figure 6.12. Another example of 
the detected images is shown in Figure 6.13, which depicts a picture of a 
container concealing three smuggled cars detected by a fixed system [33].

  The use of a fan X-ray beam has several advantages. First, the X-rays 
that are scattered out of the fan by the cargo would miss the narrow detec-
tor, thus avoiding interference with the detected image. Second, spreading 
the beam into a fan makes the radiation dose low, protecting any stow-
away from a dose more than the generally accepted radiation dose. Third, 
this radiation configuration makes it easier to design the shielding of the 
unit, resulting in low leakage levels outside the inspection tunnel and thus 
protecting the general public. 
Mobile Scanning Units. In the second approach, a mobile scanning system 
is mounted on a special vehicle. During operation the mobile scanning 
system pulls right up to the truck that is carrying the cargo container be-
ing inspected. The mobile scanner unit moves up and down parallel to the 
container. The mobile scanner has the linac and its X-ray target on one 
side and a detector on the other side of the truck. An image is collected 
based on the X-rays that have passed through the truck and its cargo. Fig-
ure 6.14 shows a still truck being scanned by a moving scanning bridge. 
6.5.2  Recent Advancements in Cargo Inspection
The cargo inspsction and ports security fields have benefitted from the advance-
ment in imaging and pattern recognition techniuqes that have been developed 
recently. Most of these advanced techniques were originally developed for im-
proved medical diagnostics and enhanced images for nondestructive testing. 
Examples of these techniques are the X-ray computed tomography, the use of 
dual energy X-ray systems, and combining these two techniques into dual-ener-
gy CT imaging. Additionally, recent advancements in the X-ray detectors have 
resulted in more sensitive, lower cost, and higher resolution imaging systems.
6.5.2.1  X-Ray Computed Tomography 
X-ray computed tomography is widely used for medical diagnostic, NDT, and, 
more recently, for security purposes like baggage inspection. In this technique

Accelerator-Based Industrial Applications

cross-sectional images, or slices, of an object are numerically reconstructed from 
X-ray projections at various angles around the object. Using specialized com-
puter programs, these cross-sectional images are combined to produce a two- 
or three-dimensional image (as in medical CAT scans). CT scanners measure 
the attenuation coefficient of the scanned object. The attenuation coefficient 
depends on the material being scanned and is also a function of the energy of 
the incident X-ray photons. In most current cargo inspection CT systems the 
scan is performed with an X-ray source of a specific energy spectrum, and it is 
not possible to determine the chemical composition of the scanned materials. 
Fortunately, some cargo inspection systems started recently to use dual energy 
X-ray systems. These systems yield material discrimination through the com-
parison of the attenuation of X-ray beams having two different energy spectra. 
6.5.2.2  Dual-Energy X-Ray Systems
Recently, dual high-energy X-ray systems have been proposed for the detec-
tion of special nuclear material in cargo containers [33–35]. They use a linac 
that can be switched between two modes of operation to produce two different 
energies. In one mode of operation, 6 MeV electrons are generated producing, 
through the bremsstrahlung effect, X-rays with energies from 0 to 6 MV. In the 
other energy mode, the linac generates 9 MeV electrons, and thus producing 
X-rays with energy spectrum from 0 to 9 MV. Photons of two different energy 
levels interact with matter differently. The high atomic number (Z) materials 
are much more opaque to 9 MV photons than to 6 MV photons, so high Z 
materials, such as uranium and plutonium, can be recognized. Then, a special 
computer algorithm calculates the size and atomic numbers of individual ob-
jects and, based on that data, determines the level of concern and the possibility 
of the inclusion of such dangerous materials. We can get higher electron energy 
with higher RF power and lower electron current, and vice versa for lower en-
ergy X-rays. Thus, we can achieve the interlacing dual energy X-ray delivery 
by controlling and changing two variables, the injected beam current and the 
power of the RF source’s (magnetron or klystron) from pulse to pulse. Figure 
6.15 shows an RF scheme as an example for varying the electron beam energies 
from pulse to pulse [35]. However, an important requirement to achieve mate-
rial identification is to have very stable dose rate X-ray pulses for both energies.
6.5.2.3  Dual-Energy CT Imaging
Dual-energy CT combines the above two advanced approaches into one tech-
nology, where the object is scanned with two different X-ray energy spectra. It 
allows not only the reconstruction of two-dimensional images of the objects 
in the container, but can also be used to estimate the density and the effective 
atomic number of different objects. In the security domain, these numbers, 

142 
RF Linear Accelerators for Medical and Industrial Applications 
 
along with other features like volume and texture, can lead to accurate detection 
of explosives and dangerous materials, such as uranium and plutonium.
6.5.2.4  Advancement in the X-Ray Detector
The X-ray detector is where the photons, transmitted through the cargo, are 
converted into visible light (scintillation) and measured by sensitive photo-de-
tector elements. The field of X-ray detectors for cargo scanning has benefitted 
significantly from advancements achieved by design and manufacturing engi-
neers building detectors for medical diagnostics. Some of the improvement for 
cargo detectors [32] can be summarized as follows:
1.	 Modular approach in design and manufacture. In this approach the de-
tector is comprised of arrays of smaller modules. This concept allows 
the designer to optimize each module for performance and at the same 
time achieve cost-effective manufacturability. Another benefit is being 
able to make the active area of the detector as small as possible, thus 
improving the detector’s resolution.
2.	 Improvements in sensitivity. The sensitivity of the detector is a measure 
of the smallest change in signal that can be detected. The enhance-
ment in detector sensitivity came as a result of the detector circuitry 
improvements that reduce the influence of noise and scatter on the 
quality of the detected signal. 
3.	 Larger dynamic range. This parameter describes the ratio of the highest 
to the lowest signal that the detector can produce. Improvements in 
this detector parameter have resulted in more precise imaging for both 
empty and fully loaded containers.

6.6  Ion Implantation in Semiconductor Chip Fabrication
The use of accelerators in the manufacturing of integrated circuits represents 
a significant market for industrial accelerators that is comparable in size to the 
market of medical linacs [24]. The ion implanter is used to alter the near-sur-
face properties of semiconductor materials [36]. Doping or otherwise modify-
ing the silicon and other semiconductor wafers was done earlier by thermal 
diffusion of deposited dopants. During the 1960s improvements were made 
in the electrostatic accelerators such as the Van de Graff and some of its modi-
fied versions such as the Pelletron developed by Herb and collaborators, which 
became available from the National Electrostatics Corporation (NEC) [37]. 
These improvements and the progress in building compact electrostatic acceler-
ators pioneered the development of commercial ion implanters. Gradually, the 
use of ion implanters for doping started to replace doping by thermal diffusion. 
Meanwhile, experience gained in building research accelerators improved the 
hardware reliability of ion implanters and generated new techniques for purify-
ing and transporting their ion beams. Thus, by the early 1970s the ion implan-
tation using electrostatic accelerators started to become the technique of choice 
for doping semiconductors. Among semiconductor processing techniques, ion 
implantation is nearly unique in that process parameters, such as concentration 
and depth of the desired dopant, are specified directly in the equipment settings 
for the dose and energy, respectively, of the implant ion.
Doping and modifying silicon and other semiconductor wafers by ion 
implantation encompasses generating an ion beam and steering it into the 
substrate so that the ions come to rest at a specific precise depth beneath the 
surface. Some of the most commonly implanted ions are arsenic, phosphorus, 
boron, indium, and antimony. The ion energies of ion implanters must be vari-
able over a wide range to allow for different depths for different dopant ions. 
In Table 6.3, we list the common ranges of current and energy sorted in three 
categories: high-current, medium-current, and high-energy.
6.6.1  Concept of Operation
The ion implanter generates the appropriate dopant ions and selects, accelerates, 
and scans them. A simple scheme of an ion implanter is shown in Figure 6.16.

In this figure we show the main constituents of the ion implantation system 
schematically, where the sizes of different subsystems are not in proportion, just 
for illustrative reasons.
In the ion, source gaseous species are ionized to produce the dopant ions. 
An analyzing magnet selects the specific ion to be implanted. The strength of 
the magnetic field of the analyzing electromagnet is set to provide the specific 
field that corresponds to the ion mass and charge. A slit allows only the chosen 
ions to pass to an electrostatic accelerator. At this step, the ions are accelerated 
to attain the desired kinetic energy commensurate with the nominal depth of 
implantation. In the scanner, the beam is scanned horizontally and vertically, 
and precisely in order, to provide a uniform dose of ions to the specific area to 
be doped on a silicon wafer. 
6.7  Concluding Remarks
We reviewed briefly in this chapter some of the industrial applications of accel-
erator-based electron and X-rays beams, from the treated rubber for tires on our 
cars, to the sterilized medical disposables we use, to the computer chips that run 
our computers, to the securing of our ports all over the world. We make use of 
these applications in our daily lives and in many cases we may not be aware of 
the technology behind it. The use of accelerators in these applications provides 
the unique trait of allowing for treatment of objects in large volumes and at the 
same time providing precise control of the doses delivered.
In the next chapter we discuss facilities and applications using large accel-
erators. One group of these facilities is based on the production of synchrotron 
radiation. Beside the multiple scientific applications of this technology, it has

proved to hold unique qualities that have been recently exploited in some im-
portant industrial applications. Examples of such fields are the pharmaceutical 
industry and the semiconductor fabrication Industry. Some of the applications 
of synchrotrons, including the current and potential ones, are discussed in the 
next chapter. In Chapter 8 we look at accelerator-based technologies that are 
at the frontier and hold the promise to shape the future of scientific as well 
as commercial accelerators. Two examples that have current and potential in-
dustrial accelerator-based applications are the free-electron lasers and neutron 
spallation sources.

Large Accelerators
Almost all the advancements in the accelerator technology originated 
from the research and development achieved in national laboratories and re-
search centers developing the larger and more complex scientific accelerators. In 
this chapter, we will discuss examples of large accelerators in three areas:
1.	 Gigantic beam colliders built by high-energy physicists to reveal the 
fundamental forces and particles of nature;
2.	 Synchrotrons as user-facilities for biologists, physicists, and chemists;
3.	 Particle therapy circular machines developed for precise cancer proton 
and ion radiation therapy.
7.1  Large Accelerator Facilities for High-Energy Physics
From the beginning and for almost a century now, the motivation for building 
large accelerators has been to accelerate particles to higher and higher energies 
in order to probe deeper and deeper into the structure of matter [1]. It starts by 
accelerating electrons or protons to smash them into a fixed target. The target 
is surrounded by a large detector that measures the emission angle, the energy, 
and momentum of the particles emitted from the target as a result of the col-
lision. From simple physics, one would realize that we get more impact if we 
have two opposite particle beams colliding in a head-on collision. In this case all 
the initial particle energy is available for creating new particles and giving them 
momentum.
There are two basic configurations for colliders. In the linear collider, the 
two opposite beams are accelerated through sections of linear accelerators. In 
the circular collider, the two beams are accelerated in circular accelerators, such 

150 
RF Linear Accelerators for Medical and Industrial Applications 
 
as a synchrotron. In this section we describe briefly the distinctive features of 
three examples of high-energy colliders that reveal recent developments in ac-
celerator technology.
7.1.1  Linear Colliders
Linear colliders accelerates beams collinearly in opposite directions before col-
liding them in a specific spot called the interaction point (IP). This configura-
tion mitigates some of the issues associated with circular colliders such as the 
energy loss due to synchrotron radiation. This loss is more notable for circular 
electron colliders where the orbiting electrons lose a lot of energy in synchro-
tron radiation (as will be discussed later this chapter). For this reason, linear 
colliders are better configurations for smaller particles, such as electrons and 
their antiparticles; positrons and circular colliders are preferably used to acceler-
ate heavier particles, such as protons or ions (both of which are part of a group 
called hadrons), since the associated synchrotron radiation loss is less than that 
for circulating electrons.
One example of linear colliders is the Stanford Linear Collider (SLC), 
which was the first linear collider of its generation [2, 3]. It was built in 1989 
utilizing the already existing SLAC two-mile linear accelerator [4]. The SLC 
operated for nine years until 1998 and produced important high-energy phys-
ics results. The SLC is a folded version of a linear collider, in which bunches 
of both electrons and positrons (antielectrons) are accelerated in a single pass 
through the linear accelerator to 50 GeV each. At the end of the two-mile linac, 
they are bent into two separate semicircle arcs (see Figures 7.1, 7.2). The arcs 
are 600-meter loops that bend the beams of electrons and positrons using sets of 
magnets. The oppositely charged particles are then brought to a head-on colli-
sion at the IP located in the center of a very large particle detector with a center 
of mass energy of 100 GeV.
In a collider such as the SLC, the probability for a particular process varies 
with what is known as the luminosity—a figure of merit quantifying the per-
formance of a collider concerning its rate of collisions. It depends on the beam 
intensities, beam transverse cross-section, and repetition rate. For higher lumi-
nosity, we need to squeeze the maximum number of particles into the smallest 
amount of space around the interaction region. To increase the luminosity, one 
must either increase the beam intensity or decrease the beam size. SLC features 
very small beam spots, less than 2 microns across in the transverse directions at 
the IP; its repetition rate is 120 pulses per second, and the beam hosts 4 × 1010 
particles per bunch [5]. This allows enough luminosity for the SLC’s experi-
ments to contribute effectively to most of the high-energy physics research in-
terests it was built to explore.

7.1.2  Circular Colliders
In a circular collider, two beams of particles travel in opposite directions in 
a ring-shaped accelerator (called the storage ring). The circulating beams are 
brought to collision at an IP in the middle of a large detector that senses the 
results of the collision.
One important limitation of circular colliders is the associated loss of en-
ergy. A circulating charged particle beam emits energy in the form of electro-
magnetic radiation called synchrotron radiation. As the velocity of the circulat-
ing charged particle approaches that of light, the loss of energy by the particle 
multiplied by the number of particles in the beam rises sharply, making the 
beam lose enormous power that can reach megawatts. The amount of synchro-
tron radiation power P emitted in a ring of fixed radius r scales as the fourth 
power of the beam energy U and inversely as the third power of the beam par-
ticle’s mass m, as shown in (7.1).

Thus, for electrons, which are about 1,800 times lighter than protons, 
synchrotron radiation becomes a severe constraint. To limit energy loss due 
to synchrotron radiation, the bending radius of an electron storage ring must 
increase approximately linearly with energy, and thus the size and cost increase 
as the energy squared. This constraint dictates that high-energy electron circular 
colliders must have a very large and gentle radius. An example is the circu-
lar electron-positron (e- - e+) collider built by the European Organization for 
Nuclear Research (CERN) and discussed briefly below.
7.1.2.1  Large Electron Positron Collider
The Large Electron Positron (LEP) synchrotron collider was built in 1989 at 
CERN, a multinational center for research in nuclear and particle physics near 
Geneva, Switzerland. LEP was a circular collider with a circumference of 27 
kilometers (17 miles) built in a tunnel 100 meters deep and straddling the 
border of Switzerland and France [6, 7]. The reason for such a large radius is 
to reduce the synchrotron radiation loss that, as shown in (7.1) above, is in-
versely proportional to the square of the orbit of the circulating particles. The 
power and cost of the RF system is determined to a large extent by the need to 
replace the energy lost by the particles due to synchrotron radiation. The first 
beam collisions at LEP took place in summer 1989 at beam energy of 46 GeV.

The original RF accelerating system used room-temperature copper cavities. To 
reduce the electrical power consumption and to be able to upgrade to higher 
colliding energies, LEP added superconducting RF accelerating cavities. In the 
upgraded LEP machine, electron and positron beams, each with energy of 100 
GeV, traveled around the circular tunnel to achieve a collision with a center of 
mass energy of 200 GeV.
LEP was considered the most powerful electron accelerator ever built un-
til now. It was used for eleven years, from 1989 until 2000, and it was later 
decommissioned to make room in the tunnel for the construction of the Large 
Hadron Collider (LHC).
7.1.2.2  Large Hadron Collider
The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is a circular collider near Geneva, Switzer-
land [8]. Its name reflects its main three features: Large (its size is approxi-
mately 27 km in circumference); Hadron (because it accelerates protons and 
antiprotons); and Collider (because these particles form two beams travelling 
in opposite directions and collide at specific interaction points). The European 
Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) built the HLC with the intention 
of testing various predictions of high-energy physics. It uses the tunnel used by 
LEP collider, discussed briefly above. The LHC spans the border between Swit-
zerland and France, about 100 m underground (see Figure 7.3). It is the world’s 
largest and highest-energy particle accelerator built so far. This synchrotron is 
designed to collide opposing particle beams of protons and antiprotons at en-
ergy of 7 teraelectron volts (7 TeV; one TeV is 1012 electron-volts). It is expected 
to address some of the most fundamental questions of physics, advancing the 
understanding of the deepest laws of nature. Its size is related to the maximum 
energy obtainable. As with all circular colliders or storage rings, the energy is a 
function of the radius of the machine and the strength of the magnetic field that 
keeps particles in their orbits.
After operating for a few days in September 2008, a serous fault caused 
this gigantic machine to shut down. It resumed operation in November 2009 
and demonstrated its first planned collisions between two 3.5 TeV beams, a 
new world record for the highest-energy man-made particle collisions. The 
LHC will continue to operate at half power for some years; it will not be run-
ning at full power (7 TeV per beam) until 2014.
As in any collider, the most important parameters are the beam energy 
and its luminosity. Similar to our discussion of linear colliders, luminosity of 
a circular collider such as the LHC is used to indicate the probability for a 
particular process. It depends on the number of particles in each bunch, the 
frequency of complete turns around the ring, the number of bunches, and the 
beam cross-section. Basically, we need to squeeze the maximum number of par-
ticles into the smallest amount of space around the interaction region. In the 

154 
RF Linear Accelerators for Medical and Industrial Applications 
 
LHC, under nominal operating conditions, each colliding beam will consist of 
nearly 3,000 bunches of particles, and each bunch will contain as many as 100 
billion particles! The particles are so tiny that the chance of any two colliding is 
very small. When the bunches cross, it is predicted that there will be only about 
20 collisions between 200 billion particles. Bunches will cross on average about 
30 million times per second. Thus, the LHC will be able to generate up to 600 
million particle collisions per second. Some of the major design parameters of 
the LHC are listed in Table 7.1, below.
7.1.3  Use of Superconductivity in Large Accelerators
The linac applications reviewed in Chapters 5 and 6 are all based upon accelera-
tors using copper cavities. In large accelerators, where large RF power is needed

circumference of 27 km.

to accelerate the charged particles to high energy, a large amount of power is 
dissipated in the ohmic resistance of the copper cavity walls. The cost of gen-
erating this additional power and also disposing this power through cooling is 
a dominant part in the power budget of the operation of any large accelerator 
and, hence, a major cost for any of these large accelerators. 
Since the resistance of a normal conductor increases as its temperature 
rises, one would think that the solution is to refrigerate the copper cavities to 
cryogenic (extremely low) temperatures. However, the resistivity of cryogenical-
ly cooled copper is reduced by less than an order of magnitude. From a power 
budget point of view, this is not practical, since the power used to refrigerate the 
copper cavities is more than the power saved by reducing the copper resistance 
by cooling.
A more practical approach is to build high-power RF cavities of a su-
perconductor material such as niobium [9, 10]. Superconducting cavities are 
characterized by having small energy losses and large stored energy. In a super-
conductor below a certain temperature called the transition temperature (Tc), 
there is virtually no resistance to the current flowing in such a material. This re-
markable property of superconductivity is attributed to the fact that in a super-
conductor below Tc, and below a critical magnetic field, electrons bind in pairs 
known as Cooper pairs. At low temperatures these electron pairs contribute to 
the moving of electric charge freely within the lattice of atoms in the supercon-
ducting material. Thus, the resistance of a superconducting material can drop 
six orders of magnitude between the Tc of the material and zero temperature, 
as shown in Figure 7.4 [11].
Superconducting cavities have found successful application in a variety 
of large accelerators spanning a wide range of accelerator requirements. Super-
conductor cavities are commonly used in high-luminosity, high-energy physics

CERN moved to superconducting RF cavity when it upgraded the LEP col-
lider to its second phase. Three hundred superconducting four-cell RF cavities 
were built for this application. To build 300 such units there were considerable 
savings in material cost by fabricating the cavity out of copper and coating it 
with niobium by sputtering. The frequency of choice was 350 MHz. Figure 7.5 
shows a typical 4-cell module [12].

7.2  Synchrotrons Sources
In previous chapters, we covered many applications for X-rays. In Chapter 5 we 
discussed the use of X-rays in cancer radiation therapy (RT). We have reviewed 
some of the very diverse industrial applications for X-rays in Chapter 6. In this 
section, we look at X-rays as one of the main probes that extend our current 
capability to analyze molecular properties of materials. This is attributed to the 
availability of synchrotron radiation with its exceptional properties.
7.2.1  Synchrotron Storage Rings
Synchrotron radiation was seen for the first time by the researchers at General 
Electric in the United States in 1947 in an accelerator they called the synchro-
tron, and hence the name coined for this type of radiation. It was first consid-
ered a nuisance because it caused the particles to lose energy in synchrotrons 
used for colliders. However, soon after it was recognized as a useful electromag-
netic radiation, usually called the synchrotron light, with exceptional properties. 
Tens of synchrotrons have been built around the world solely as sources for this 
type of radiation, extending from infrared to hard (short wavelength) X-rays. 
The generic name light source is used often to describe these user facilitates, 
where scientists from universities and industry use this powerful tool for re-
search in many fields.
The synchrotron is a circular accelerator (also called a storage ring) that 
guides charged particles, such as electrons, into an orbit at almost the speed of 
light. When electrons are deflected through magnetic fields, they emit high-
intensity electromagnetic waves that are produced as a high-flux narrow beam. 
An electron circulating in the ring is thus like a moving torchlight, producing 
a narrow photon beam in the direction tangential to the ring (see Figure 7.6). 
Typically, several beamlines are installed around the storage ring to receive the 
Figure 7.6  Generation of synchrotron radiation.

158

resulting radiation (see Figure 7.7; note that the electron injector is not shown, 
for simplicity). 
In a typical user-facility synchrotron, different experimental setups are 
normally established along each beamline to carry out material investigations 
exploiting the unique properties of synchrotron radiation. In Figure 7.8, we 
show an example of layout of a synchrotron (Lawrence Berkeley National Labo-
ratory). In Figure 7.9, we show a beamline in the same synchrotron, with the 
typical associated experimental setups [13].

Let us now consider how this radiation is produced. When electrons are 
accelerated, whether they are gaining speed along a straight line or traveling at 
a constant speed on a curved path, they emit electromagnetic waves (see Figure 
7.6). This process has the same basic principal behind the mechanism by which 
radio waves are emitted from an antenna. Electrons in an antenna of a radio 
emitter are oscillating, and their velocities are changing with time, thus radiat-
ing electromagnetic waves (radio waves in this case). Similarly, in a synchro-
tron, bunches of electrons being accelerated (changing their direction as they 
are constrained in the circular pass in a synchrotron ring) emit high-intensity 
photons. However, these two similar mechanisms differ in that electrons oscil-
lating in a radio antenna emit basically one frequency, or a single wavelength. 
However, in the case of synchrotron, electrons circulating in the ring illuminate 
each beamline only for a very short period of time, producing a short pulse in the 
form of a burst of photons. A short pulse in time corresponds to a wide band 
of frequencies. In the case of synchrotron radiation, a wide band of frequencies 
also means a wide band of wavelengths from which any desired wavelength can 
be selected with special filtering devices call monochromators. Figure 7.10 shows 
how a beamline is used to transport photons to the sample under test and the 
spectra filtering using a monochromator [13, 14].
Figure 7.9  A typical synchrotron beamline with scientist establishing experimental setups to 
use the synchrotron radiation.

RF Linear Accelerators for Medical and Industrial Applications 
 
Synchrotron radiation produces photons with wavelengths that extend 
from the infrared to hard X-rays with energies of hundreds of keV with unique-
ly high photon intensities. The part of the electromagnetic spectrum that syn-
chrotron radiation can occupy is shown in Figure 7.11. Note that VUV stands 
for Vacuum UV, and it describes a range of UV with wavelengths around 100 
nanometer and of energy in the neighborhood of 10 eV. It is so named because 
it is absorbed strongly by air and is, therefore, used only in vacuum.
7.2.2  Wigglers and Undulators
Early synchrotron radiation facilities were basically circular rings where the ra-
diation resulted from the bending of the electron beams under the effect of 
the bending magnets. They generally had an electron beam of relatively large 
cross-section and angular divergence. Modern user-facilities are dedicated to 
Figure 7.10  Transporting and filtering synchrotron radiation from a storage ring.

broad scientific uses that are optimized to offer collimated beams with high 
brightness. This is done by the inclusion of many long, straight sections fitted 
with wigglers and undulators.
Undulators are periodic magnetic structures producing sequences of alter-
nating, relatively weak, magnetic fields—that is, north-south, south-north, and 
so on. This periodicity causes the electron to experience oscillations as it moves 
along the axis of the device. The resulting motion is characterized by small 
angular excursions called undulations [13]. Since the magnetic field is relatively 
weak, the amplitude of the undulations is small, resulting in a narrow radiation 
cone as shown in Figure 7.12. An undulator produces X-ray with a few orders of 
magnitude in brightness more than the synchrotron light which are produced 
in conventional synchrotron storage rings by bending the electron beam using 
bending magnets, as discussed above in Section 7.2.1.
Wigglers are also periodic magnetic structures, the same as undulators, but 
they are characterized by a relatively stronger magnetic field. They produce ra-
diation cones with broader angles than those produced by undulators. Another 
difference between the undulator and the wiggler is that the undulator results 
in a longer pulse of light, rather than a series of short bursts, as in the wiggler. 
The longer pulses are characterized by the emission of photon energies con-
centrated over short bands of wavelengths. In constrast, the wiggler produces 
photons that have a continuum of wavelengths similar to that of bending mag-
net radiation, but increased by the number of magnetic pole pieces. A photo of 
a 2-meter-long wiggler with 55 poles of permanent magnets from Stanford is 
shown in Figure 7.13 [15].
7.2.3  Examples of Synchrotron Radiation Applications
As was mentioned above, the high-intensity synchrotron radiation produces 
photons with wavelengths that extend from the infrared to hard X-rays, with 
Figure 7.12  Radiation beam resulting from undulating effect.

162

uniquely high-photon intensities that can be used to determine the composi-
tion and properties of materials using a variety of techniques. The fields of 
material and chemical science have benefited greatly from the application of 
synchrotron radiation–based analytical methods [16, 17]. These include re-
search in the areas of materials chemistry, surface science, magnetic materials, 
and chemical dynamics. Samples of useful applications include the magnetic 
properties of hard discs for memory storage, wear of aircraft turbine, and the 
study of catalysts in chemical processes. Synchrotron radiation can be used to 
measure atomic separation to a hundredth of an angstrom. In any material, ad-
jacent atoms are bonded by the action of outermost electrons orbiting around 
each atom. The energies available from synchrotron radiation are well suited to 
studying those bonds. For example, industries developing corrosion-resistant 
surfaces or catalytic converters would be interested in analyzing the bonding 
mechanisms of different gases with metallic surfaces. Another example is the 
use of X-ray diffraction technique in studying the crystallographic structure and 
physical properties of materials and thin films. This technique is based on ob-
Figure 7.13  A permanent magnet wiggler [15].

serving the scattered intensity of an X-ray synchrotron beam hitting the sample 
as a function of incident and scattered angles, polarization (orientation of the 
electromagnetic fields in the wave), and wavelength. A third analytical tech-
nique is based on analyzing the X-ray emitted from a material when subjected 
to strong synchrotron radiation. It is called synchrotron-radiation-induced x-ray 
emission (SRIXE). This technique is used to determine elemental concentra-
tions through the detection of characteristic X-rays produced by the interaction 
of the synchrotron X-ray beams with the sample material.
There are many ways that synchrotron radiation is used for study of bio-
logical materials. The most prominent example is the application of X-ray dif-
fraction methods for determination of protein and DNA structures and under-
standing biological structure and function. This is an extremely active field of 
research pursued at many synchrotron facilities by scientists from universities, 
as well as industrial and government laboratories. Multiple synchrotron facili-
ties have been involved in the Human Genome Project (a project to determi-
nate the base sequence of the human genome).
Other examples include the use of synchrotron radiation in the design of 
drugs and in the configuration of enzymes for various industrial processes. One 
technique used is to crystallize complex biological molecules and then scatter 
the powerful synchrotron beams of X-rays off the atoms in the crystal to reveal 
its three-dimensional structure. This technique is known as macromolecular 
X-ray crystallography [18]. This technique has opened the door for gaining de-
tailed knowledge of macromolecular structure and for probing large, complex 
biological molecules. The availability of such new analytical tools is providing a 
new approach for drug design by the pharmaceutical industry.
The manufacturers of integrated circuits face a challenging analytical 
problem since these integrated circuits are three-dimensional structures with 
features that have submicrometer dimensions. One of the effective techniques 
meeting this challenge is computed microtomography (CMT) using synchrotron 
radiation. It is a nondestructive technique that can be used to determine the 
microstructure of materials in integrated circuits with spatial resolutions of the 
order of 1 micrometer.
7.3  Cancer Particle Therapy
We have discussed in Chapter 5 conventional radiation therapy based on the 
use of linacs in treating cancer by producing high-energy electron or photon (X-
ray) beams. In this section, we deal with cancer particle therapy (PT) [18–22]. 
The ionizing radiation in PT is accomplished by beams of particles heavier than 
electrons, such as protons or ions (mostly carbon ion), and employs relatively 
large circular accelerators. In general, the heavier the particle, the greater is its 

164 
RF Linear Accelerators for Medical and Industrial Applications 
 
effectiveness in ionizing the tissue it traverses. For example, the proton has a 
mass 1,800 times the mass of an electron, and hence, a beam of protons would 
be more effective in destroying a cancerous tissue. Additionally, protons and 
carbon ions can target tumor tissue much more precisely than X-rays, possibly 
allowing the delivery of higher doses of radiation to a tumor. The majority of 
PT facilities are using protons. (Actually, the acronym PT is also sometimes 
used for proton therapy. An alternative name is hadron therapy, since hadron 
would cover both proton and ions.) Investigating different ions for cancer PT 
has shown that carbon ions represent a good alternative to protons. It has sharp-
er stopping points and is more effective in killing malignant cells [21].
7.3.1  Advantages of Particle Therapy
In radiation therapy, proton beams differ from photon beams mainly in the way 
they deposit energy in living tissue. Whereas photons deposit energy in small 
packets all along their path through tissue, protons (or ions) undergo little scat-
tering when penetrating in matter and deposit less energy along the way and 
give the highest dose near the end of their range (called the Bragg peak), just 
before coming to rest (Figure 7.14). 
Thus, the depth-dose curves of proton and carbon ion beams are differ-
ent from those of photons. After a short build-up region, conventional X-ray 
radiation shows an exponentially decreasing energy deposition, with increasing 
depth in tissue. In contrast, protons (and hadrons in general) show different 
depth-dose distribution characterized by delivering much of their energy to 
tissue just over the last few millimeters of their range, at the Bragg peak (Figure 
7.15). It is clear from comparing the depth-dose curves of proton and carbon 
ion to those of typical conventional RT that protons and carbon ions can target 
Figure 7.14  Typical dose deposition as a function of depth for a proton beam.

 
Large Accelerators 
165
tumor tissue much more precisely than X-rays and penetrate deeper into the 
body with less harm to healthy tissue it traverses before and past the tumor 
site. This characteristic of protons results in an obvious advantage of proton 
treatment over conventional radiation because the region of maximum energy 
deposition can be positioned within the target for each beam direction. Chang-
ing the energy of the penetrating proton beam can change the precise position 
of the Bragg peak. The protons will stop at a particular depth, dependent on 
their inital energy.
Thus, it is possible to adjust this dose peak to within tenths of milli-
meters. Actually, the position of the Bragg peak is so sharp that it is generally 
smaller than the tumor. Consequently, it is possible to cover the tumor volume 
with high accuracy by varying the energy during the irradiation in a controlled 
way and superimposing many narrow Bragg peaks, to obtain a spread-out Bragg 
peak (SOBP). This is shown in Figure 7.16, with depth-dose distributions for 
an SOBP, its constituent pristine Bragg peaks, and a conventional RT X-ray 
beam (10-MV photon beam). The dashed lines indicate the clinical acceptable 
variation in the plateau dose of ±2%, showing the achievable uniformity of dose

[22].

166 
RF Linear Accelerators for Medical and Industrial Applications 
 
delivery over the area covered. Also an important feature is the absence of dose 
beyond the distal fall-off edge of the SOBP. Clearly, this is not the case with the 
photon beam.
Due to their relatively large mass, protons have little lateral side-scatter in 
the tissue; the beam does not broaden much, stays focused on the tumor shape, 
and delivers small dose side effects to surrounding tissue. This feature, and the 
fact that very few protons penetrate beyond the Bragg peak range, make proton 
therapy of particular interest for those tumors located close to critical organs 
and tissues, where a small local overdose can cause serious complications. Ex-
amples would be tumors close to the spinal cord, eye, or the brain, as well as in 
pediatric tumors.
7.3.2  Particle Therapy Circular Accelerators
In contrast to the conventional radiation therapy, which uses relatively com-
pact linacs, PT systems are huge and much more expensive. In order to reach 
deep-seated tumors, proton or carbon ion beams must be accelerated to high 
enough energy. For example, to treat a tumor at a depth of 25 cm, the energy 
needed would be 200 MeV for a proton beam. Producing such energetic beams 
requires the use of large circular accelerators. PT facilities use either cyclotron 
or synchrotrons as accelerators. Each of these two approaches has its advantages. 
We will discuss both and point out a hospital-based facility as an example for 
each type of circular accelerators.

7.3.2.1  Cyclotron Accelerators for PT
As explained briefly in Chapter 1, a cyclotron is a circular accelerator that ac-
celerates charged particles in a spiral path. It consists of two semicircular elec-
trodes (called the dees). In the center of the machine, an ion source emits a 
beam of ions or protons. The protons move inside the dees in a spiral trajectory 
under the combined effect of an electromagnet designed to produce a region 
of uniform dc magnetic field and the RF electric field produced across the gap 
between the dees by an oscillating voltage. As they spiral around, particles gain 
energy. Thus, they trace a larger arc, with the consequence that it always takes 
the same time to reach the gap. The size of the magnets and the strength of the 
magnetic fields limit the particle energy that can be reached by a cyclotron.
As an example of hospital-based proton treatment center using a cyclo-
tron, we consider the Northeast Proton Therapy Center (NPTC) of the Mas-
sachusetts General Hospital (MGH) in Boston, Massachusetts. It is a cyclotron-
based system manufactured by Ion Beam Applications (IBA). The cyclotron 
(Cyclone 235) delivers protons with energy of 235 MeV. A photo of the Cyclone 
235 is shown in Figure 7.17. The cyclotron produces the proton beam at a fixed 
energy. In order to provide energy variability to the system, the cyclotron is 
followed by an Energy Selection System (ESS). It is based on the use of a carbon 
stepped-wedge as an energy degrader, followed by a slit. The ESS transforms 
the fixed-energy beam extracted from the cyclotron into a variable-energy beam 
Figure 7.17  The cyclotron installed at the NPTC produced by IBA [24].

RF Linear Accelerators for Medical and Industrial Applications 
 
in the 235 to 70 MeV range. It can achieve a 10% energy variation within two 
seconds [24].
Although the cyclotron is only capable of providing accelerated protons 
for PT applications in fixed energy, it is generally a less expensive and a more 
compact option than the other PT alternative circular machine—namely, the 
synchrotron.
7.3.2.2  Synchrotron Accelerators for PT
The use of a synchrotron as the proton accelerator allows the production of 
proton beams with a variety of energies (unlike the cyclotron, which has fixed 
extraction energy). A small linear accelerator is often used to preaccelerate par-
ticles before they enter the ring. A synchrotron allows beam extraction for any 
energy, providing a more flexible solution. 
The world’s first hospital-based proton therapy center was commissioned 
in 1990 in the Loma Linda University Medical Center (LLUMC) [25–27]. 
The accelerator and the beam delivery system were designed by, and built with 
the help of, the U.S. Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab). A 250-
MeV synchrotron was chosen as the proton accelerator. Protons are injected 
into the synchrotron at energy of 2 MeV. The synchrotron provides a pulsed 
beam to the designated treatment room every 2.2 sec. In the synchrotron stor-
age ring, the protons gain energy as they pass through an RF cavity with each 
turn, until they reach the desired energy, ranging from 70 to 250 MeV, de-
pending on the desired depth of penetration in the patient. At this point the 
magnetic dipole field and the RF frequency are held constant until the protons 
are extracted from the storage ring and transported to the treatment rooms. 
After extraction, the magnetic field returns to injection level for the next patch 
of protons.  
The treatment facility at the LLUMC includes three gantries (one with 
robotic patient positioning) and one research room, as shown in Figure 7.18. 
I discussed above two of the particle therapy facilities, one using a cyclo-
tron and the other using a synchrotron. Although the operation of such facili-
ties started only about two decades ago, this trend has been growing rapidly. As 
of May 2011, there are now 32 PT centers in operation and treating cancer pa-
tient around the world. Twenty-eight centers are treating with proton and four 
are using carbon ions. Up to that date, 73,804 cancer patients have been treated 
by proton beams and 6,661 patients treated by carbon ion beams [7, 28]. In 
spite of the size and cost associated with PT, it provides unique capabilities in 
treating specific case of cancer. As we discussed in this section, PT offers highly 
conformal treatment of deep-seated tumors with millimeter accuracy, while de-
livering minimal doses to the surrounding tissues. This distinctiveness makes 
this technique an effective cancer treatment that complements the conventional

radiation therapy based on linear accelerator to produce energetic electrons for 
both electron and X-ray therapies.

Recent Developments and Future Trends 
in Accelerator Technology
In this short chapter we look ahead at the current activities in the field of ac-
celerators that are on the frontier and that are expected to be a major part of 
the future of scientific as well as commercial accelerators. Although these ac-
celerators do not produce the highest energy beams and are not the largest in 
size, they are at the technology frontier and hold the promise to affect the future 
lives of many. In the previous chapter we covered briefly samples of “large accel-
erators.” In this chapter we cover some of the accelerator technologies that are 
being developed or have been recently realized in a full scale. Some of these are 
still considered large accelerators, at least at this phase of development, such as 
the free-electron laser (FEL) Accelerators, covered in Section 8.1, and Accelerator-
Based Neutron Sources, discussed in Section 8.2.
In all the linac applications that we have covered in this book so far, the 
basic force accelerating the particles is electromagnetic fields. In this chapter, we 
will touch on two different mechanism of acceleration. One comes from fields 
generated in plasma, called plasma-based accelerators, covered in Section 8.3. 
These plasma wakefield acceleration (PWFA) techniques could ultimately lead 
to powerful tabletop accelerators for science, medicine, and industry. The other 
novel acceleration mechanism is based on controlled discharge in transmission 
lines, as discussed in Section 8.4 on dielectric wall accelerators. One application 
being developed is building a proton therapy machine based on this technology.
The intent is to give the reader a quick glance at what is being devel-
oped—rather than a detailed and comprehensive coverage of these accelerator 
technologies—and to provide adequate references for readers who want to learn 
more about these new trends in the accelerator technology. Let us have a quick 
look.

RF Linear Accelerators for Medical and Industrial Applications 
 
8.1  Free-Electron Laser
Free electron lasers (FELs) represent an increasingly important kind of light 
source with a brightness that can be up to nine orders of magnitude (109 times) 
higher than that of ordinary synchrotron light (described in Section 7.2).
The basic principle of a free-electron laser is as follows [1]. Electrons are 
first brought to high energies in a linear accelerator. The tightly bunched beam 
of electrons is then fed into an undulator. As described in Section 7.2, the 
undulator is a long array of high-quality magnets with special arrangement of 
alternating polarity, as shown in Figure 8.1. When the electron beam passes 
through the undulator, magnetic fields of the undulator wiggle the electrons 
from side to side. This transverse acceleration causes the electrons to radiate 
photons in the forward direction similar to synchrotron radiation described in 
the last chapter. The higher the energy of electron beam, the higher the result-
ing photon energy. As electron bunches propagate down the undulator, they are 
bathed in the same light they generate. As they wiggle back and forth through 
the magnets and interact with the electric field of this light, some gain energy 
and some lose energy, depending upon their phase relationship with the light 
and the magnetic fields. As a result, the electrons begin to form microbunches 
separated by a distance equal to the wavelength of the light they generate. The 
light waves emitted by the electron bunches will line up in phase. This means 
that the waves’ peaks and valleys overlay each other to reinforce and amplify the 
light’s intensity coherently, thereby giving rise to light with properties charac-
teristic of conventional lasers. By varying the energy of the linac electron beam, 
this laser wavelength can be varied over a wide range. The reason this photon 
source is called free electron laser is that the preceding process is similar to how 
the light from laser stimulates further emission of light within the laser medium 
(gas or solid). The difference is that this lasting effect in the case of the FEL is 
done in vacuum and there is no need for a physical medium for the electrons to 
amplify coherently the light produced—hence, the word free in the name FEL.
Figure 8.1  Simplified presentation of the operation of the FEL.

 
Recent Developments and Future Trends in Accelerator Technology 
175
The FEL generates light in ultra-short pulses with the extremely high-
peak intensity that can be used for strobelike investigations of extremely rapid 
processes. The FEL can be widely tunable in wavelength of the produced pho-
tons to cover frequencies ranging from microwaves, through terahertz radiation 
and infrared, to the visible spectrum, to ultraviolet, and to X-rays.
There are facilities that are built or currently being developed specifically 
as sources for high-brightness, high-coherence X-ray free electron laser (XFEL). 
Some of these facilities are in the United States, Europe, and Japan [2–4].
One example of the FEL new facilities that are designed specifically to 
produce FEL X-rays, is the linac coherent light source (LCLS) built at the Stan-
ford University’s SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory [2]. SLAC has con-
verted its giant two–mile linac into the world’s first X-ray laser, which started 
being available for research in late 2009. LCLS provides much shorter and 
much more intense X-ray pulses than ever available before. Scientists are now 
able to use the X-rays from FEL in observing chemical reactions, in which mol-
ecules join or split, that take place in a fraction of a nanosecond. The ultrafast 
LCLS X-ray flashes can capture images of such events with a “shutter speed” of 
less than 100 femtoseconds (1 femtosecond is one thousandth of a nanosecond 
or equals 10-15 of a second). LCLS is the first source to produce X-rays that are 
both very intense and clumped into ultrafast pulses. Some of the parameters of 
the SLAC’s LCLS are listed in Table 8.1 [1].
From this brief review, we can see that the main aspects of the X-ray free-
electron lasers are the extremely high-peak intensity combined with ultra-short 
pulse durations. One can put it simply that the FEL will allow the scientists to 
probing the ultra-small and capturing the ultra-fast.

8.2  Accelerator-Based Neutron Sources
Every atom has in its nucleus neutral particles, the neutrons, and positively 
charged particles, the protons. Neutrons and protons have about the same mass, 
and both can be extracted from the nucleus and exist as free particles away from 
the nucleus. Neutrons are used as a research tool, such as in scattering experi-
ments and other material analysis applications. Since neutrons can penetrate 
deeply into most materials, scientists use neutron scattering to probe the bulk of 
materials. Low-energy neutrons have energies of several tens of millielectron-
volt (meV), corresponding to wavelengths of a few angstroms (note that par-
ticles can be viewed to act as waves under the right conditions). With these 
wavelengths, which are comparable to X-rays, neutrons scatter into diffraction 
patterns much as those seen in synchrotron radiation probing techniques. The 
two techniques often yield complementary information: neutron scattering 
(which is sensitive to the positions of the nuclei) and X-ray diffraction (which 
is sensitive to the positions of the orbiting electrons) are powerful probes of the 
structure of materials.
Neutrons have a greater sensitivity for light elements (elements with low 
atomic number), such as hydrogen and oxygen. One example of how scien-
tists used this capability is their success in determining the critical positions 
of light oxygen atoms in yttrium-barium-copper oxide (YBCO), a promising 
high-temperature superconducting ceramic. Because neutron beams can be 
produced with energies that match the energies of atoms in motion, neutrons 
can be used to track molecular vibrations, movements of atoms during catalytic 
reactions, and changes in the behavior of materials subjected to outside forces, 
such as rising temperature, pressure, or magnetic field strength. Another useful 
characteristic of the neutron is that it has a magnetic moment (i.e., it acts as a 
very minute magnet). This property has been exploited in studying microscopic 
magnetic structure and developing magnetic materials and their applications, 
such as magnetic recording.
8.2.1  Neutron Spallation Sources
In general, spallation is a process in which fragments of material (spall) are 
ejected from a body due to impact. Neutron spallation is the process by which a 
particle accelerator is used to produce a beam of neutrons by impacting a target. 
Although it is more expensive way of producing neutron beams than by a chain 
reaction of nuclear fission in a nuclear reactor, it has the advantage that the 
beam can be pulsed with relative ease and in a well-controlled process.
Generally the production of neutrons at a spallation source begins with 
a high-powered linear proton accelerator, followed by a synchrotron to accu-
mulate the proton beam bunches to produce an intense beam of protons that 

 
Recent Developments and Future Trends in Accelerator Technology 
177
is then is focused onto a target [5, 6]. The target material should have high 
mass density to produce large neutron flux. It should also have high thermal 
conductivity to dispose easily the heat generated from the impact as well as high 
melting point (for solid targets). Solid targets of choice are tantalum or tung-
sten. Liquid mercury can be also used as target in neutron spallation. Spallation 
processes taking place in the target produce the neutrons, initially at very high 
energies. These neutrons are then slowed in what are called moderators, which 
are filled with liquid hydrogen or liquid methane. This step brings down the 
energies of the neutrons to the energies that are needed for the analytical tech-
niques using neutrons.
There are already a few neutron source facilities that are operating around 
the world, such as the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) [6, 7] in United States, 
ISIS [8] in United Kingdom, Swiss Spallation Neutron Source (SINQ) [9] in 
Switzerland, and there are a few in the pipeline, such as the Japan Proton Accel-
erator Research Complex (J-PARC) [10] in Japan and the European Spallation 
Source (ESS) [11] to be built in Sweden.
We will consider here the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) [6, 7] as an 
example of neutron source facilities.
8.2.2  The Spallation Neutron Source (SNS)
The Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) is built on 80 acres in Oak Ridge, Ten-
nessee (Figure 8.2). It is managed by Oak Ridge National Laboratory. It became 
the most powerful neutron source in the world in September 2009 by achieving 
a new world record when 1 MW of proton beam power was delivered to the 
target.
The design and the construction of the SNS was a multi-laboratory proj-
ect involving five U.S. national labs: Argonne National Laboratory, Brookhaven 
National Laboratory, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Los Alamos Na-
tional Laboratory, and Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Figure 8.3 shows a 
schematic layout of the main constituent facilities of the SNS and the main 
contributor to the design of each part.
The acceleration is done in the linear accelerator system to attain 1-GeV 
beam energy. The accumulator is a storage ring where the pulse of proton is 
compressed from 1 m sec pulse to 1 micro sec pulse. The bending magnets of 
the SNS’s storage ring are shown in Figure 8.4. Then the neutrons go through 
the moderator to slow down and reach thermal equilibrium. This moderation 
process takes some 10 to 20 microseconds. Therefore, the pulse length of the 
incoming proton beam from the accumulator should be much less than 10 
microseconds. The resulting intense pulsed neutron beam is then provided for 
different scientific research and industrial developments.

8.3  Plasma-Based Accelerators
Particle accelerators discussed so far have relied on the force of RF electric fields 
to accelerate electrons and other particles. However, these RF accelerators, es-

pecially colliders for high-energy physics studies, have been pushing against an 
upper limit for field strength of tens of MeV per meter. At higher energies, the 
RF electric fields can break down and could even generate enough heat to melt 
accelerator components if not sufficiently cooled. So the only way to get more 
energy from RF accelerators is to build longer, more expensive ones. Fortunate-
ly, accelerator physicists have been working hard to find alternative mechanisms 
for acceleration. One alternative technique is the plasma wake field accelera-
tion. Experiments indicate that plasma wakefield machines could generate tens 
of GeV per meter—as much as 1,000 times more acceleration potential per 
length of accelerator than the conventional RF field acceleration [12–14].
8.3.1  Basic Concept of PWFA
Plasma simply can be looked at as a soup of ionized gas in which electrons are 
stripped from atoms. It can be generated by subjecting a diluted gas to heat, a 
powerful laser beam, or an electron beam. Similar to the wakes commonly seen 
behind moving boats, speeding electrons or a laser pulse can create a charge 
wake in a sea of ionized gas, or plasma. Since the atoms are already ionized in 
a plasma, the limit of breakdown and ionization is not of concern for charged 
particles accelerated in plasma.
In a plasma accelerator an intense particle beam is used to drive a longi-
tudinal wave, which trails the driving beam at close to the speed of light. The 
electric fields formed between the peaks and troughs of these plasma waves can 
be orders of magnitude larger than those used in conventional RF accelerators.
Let us consider a case of a plasma wake generated by the passage of a near-
light speed electron bunch as it is simpler in concept as well in implementation. 
Let us consider Figure 8.5 [15]. In (a) we show a plasma, made of positive ions 
and free electrons, before an electron bunch enters. As the electron bunch enters 
the plasma in (b), it repels the free electrons from its path, and attracts the posi-
tive ions. The moving electron bunch leaves a wake of positive ions behind it as 
it passes. Now we see in (c) that the displaced free electrons are attracted to the 
mass of positive ions behind the electron bunch. In (d), one can visualize how 
the free electrons in their new position can propel electrons in the trailing part 
of the bunch and accelerate them.
Figure 8.4  Magnets in the storage ring at the SNS (courtesy of the Oak Ridge National Labo-
ratory).

180 
RF Linear Accelerators for Medical and Industrial Applications 
 
The above effect can be demonstrated in two routines. In the single-bunch 
routine, the bunch is propelled by its own wake. The head of the bunch creates 
the plasma and drives a wake of charge. The wake is driven out of the path of 
the incoming electrons, creating a charge imbalance that pulls it crashing back 
in behind the passing electron bunch. This effect produces a strong field that 
accelerates particles in the back of the bunch. The system effectively operates as 
a transformer, where the energy from the particles in the head is transferred to 
those in the back, through the plasma wake. An energy gain of more than 42 
GeV is achieved in a plasma wakefield accelerator of 85 cm length, driven by a 
42 GeV electron beam at the SLAC Stanford Linear Accelerator Laboratory [16].
The physics is similar if there are two bunches rather than one. Here, the 
first bunch creates the wake (called the “drive” bunch) and a trailing bunch 
(called the “witness” bunch) that would get accelerated by the wake of the drive 
bunch. It should be pointed out that the process of energy transformation that 
takes place in the plasma wake field accelerator is consistent with the principle 
of conservation of energy. The process is based on taking energy from a large 
number of electrons in the drive bunch and using it to accelerate a smaller num-
ber of electrons in the witness bunch to a much higher energy. 
Plasma wakefield acceleration is one of the promising approaches to ad-
vancing accelerator technology. For this reason, several national laboratories 
and universities are investigating and developing this new technology. At SLAC 
National Accelerator Laboratory, a specialized test facility is being established. 
The Facility for Advanced Accelerator Experimental Tests (FACET) [15] uses 
two-thirds of the famous two-mile-long linear accelerator at SLAC.
8.4  Dielectric Wall Accelerators
A compact dielectric wall accelerator (DWA) with field gradient up to 100 
MV/m is being developed by a group of scientist at the Lawrence Livermore 
National Laboratory, in California [17–19]. It uses fast switched high-voltage 
transmission lines to generate pulsed electric fields on the inside of a high gra-
Figure 8.5  Simplified illustration of the basic concept of plasma wakefield acceleration [15].

 
Recent Developments and Future Trends in Accelerator Technology 
181
dient insulation acceleration tube. The goal is to be able to accelerate proton 
bunches for use in cancer therapy treatment [20, 21].
8.4.1  Basic Concept of DWA
As its name implies, the DWA is an accelerator where the beam pipe, or the 
inside of the accelerator, is made of a dielectric. This dielectric hosts a high-gra-
dient tangential electric field that is parallel to the axis of the accelerator tube. 
Hence, it can exert a force on a charged particle, such as a proton, and accelerate 
it. Vacuum insulators composed of alternating layers of metal and dielectric, 
known as high-gradient insulators (HGIs) are used as the dielectric wall of the 
accelerator. It withstands electric fields higher than conventional insulators.
Now, we need an arrangement to supply the dielectric wall with the tan-
gential electric field that is used for acceleration. A pulse forming line, called 
Blumlein, provides this. It is basically a transmission line that is charged to a 
certain voltage and then discharged in a controlled manner. To discharge the 
transmission line arrangement, we need a switch that can close fast.  The ideal 
closing switch for this application would be capable of high gradient operation 
with a very long lifetime and a low resistance when conducting. A good switch 
has been found to be silicon carbide (SiC) photoconductive switches [17]. A 
laser light is directed into the SiC switch to activate it to close. At the closing 
of the switch, the line starts to discharge, marking the beginning of a pulse. A 
pulsed electric field is formed at the inside of the accelerating tube. An accelera-
tor can be fabricated by stacking many of the Blumleins that are terminated on 
one side with the SiC switches and on the other side with the HGI dielectric 
(Figure 8.6).
Figure 8.6  A stack made of the Blumlein terminated at SiC switches and the HGI [17].

182 
RF Linear Accelerators for Medical and Industrial Applications 
 
By controlling the timing of the closing switches in the pulse forming 
lines, a traveling tangential electrical field can be applied to the inside dielectric 
wall. The speed of this field can be adjusted to keep pace with a co-moving 
charged particle, such as a proton, so that the particle is continually accelerated 
through the structure. Figure 8.7 [20] shows a simplified schematic of a proton 
accelerator based on the DWA.
One promising application for the DWA is to be able to dramatically 
reduce the size and cost of proton therapy machines (see Figures 8.8 and 8.9). 
The accelerator is expected to have an average acceleration gradient in the range 
of 100 MeV/m, and potentially can be fitted in a single treatment room [19–
21]. The reader may recall from the coverage of proton therapy machines in 
Section 7.3 that these proton machine are based on cyclotrons or synchrotrons, 
where both circular machines typically have large footprints, and hence they are

relatively expensive to build. The ultimate objective of developing the DWA 
is to provide proton machines that can fit in a local clinic to provide proton 
therapy and make them more affordable.
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California has a Coopera-
tive Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with Compact Particle 
Acceleration Corporation (CPAC), a subsidiary of Accuray, a radiation therapy 
company in the United States, to develop a compact proton DWA for radiation 
therapy.
8.5  Concluding Remarks
In this brief chapter, we reviewed some of the novel acceleration methods and 
their current and potential applications. Some of the recent developments have 
been put to use already, such as the neutron spallation sources and free-elec-
tron lasers. Conversely, other innovative acceleration ideas, such as the plasma 
wakefield acceleration and the dielectric-wall accelerators are not ready yet for 
implementation and require further research to overcome some of the current 
challenges. It is hoped that the accelerator researchers will continue pushing 
these advancement further, making these accelerators smaller and more afford-
able. This should open the door for more applications than we can envision at 
this time.
