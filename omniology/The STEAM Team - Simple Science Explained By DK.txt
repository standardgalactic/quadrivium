Introduction
This book is about science and how it’s used. 
Science is about trying to understand our 
surroundings—the world and universe around  
us and all the things and creatures in it, from 
atoms to huge mountains, from tiny bacteria to 
large whales. As we learn more, we find so 
much that is puzzling. What lies outside the 
universe we can see with a telescope, and  
how does the brain think and feel love?

It is important to know as much 
about science as we can so that we use 
our inventions, our technology, wisely. They 
can be used for the good of everybody,  
but science used in the wrong way can be 
harmful. You are fortunate because we now 
know so much more than when I was a child, 
and books like this did not exist. Properly used, 
the knowledge that science brings helps us  
be healthier and live better lives.

Meet the
STEAM Team
The STEAM Team is made up of different  
subjects that work together to show you how  
the world works.
Science
is all about asking questions 
and discovering the answers 
to explain how things work. Technology
uses science to create new 
machines and more effective 
ways of doing things.
Engineering
is all about finding and designing 
solutions to problems—using 
science, technology, and math.

7
Math
is about numbers,  
patterns, and  
problem-solving. 
Art
is all about using your 
imagination and style to 
create brilliant new things.
We’ll be here to 
help you with 
handy tips!

The
universe
The universe is everything around us.  
Some of this we can see, but most we 
cannot. It is a huge expanse of mainly  
empty space, with billions of galaxies,  
each containing millions of stars. 
The Big Bang
Astronomers believe the universe 
exploded out of a tiny point about 
14 billion years ago. This is known 
as the Big Bang. Before this, the 
universe did not exist. It is still 
continuing to expand today. 
There are more stars  
in the universe than  
grains of sand on all of  
the beaches on Earth. 
Light travels really fast, but space is so 
enormous that it takes time to reach us. This 
means that when we look into the universe, we 
are only ever viewing the past! Light travels 
nearly 6 million miles (10 trillion km) a year. 
Scientists call this a light-year, and use it to 
measure the huge distances in space.

9
Our solar system was 
formed billions of years 
after the Big Bang. 
The Hubble Telescope  
travels 370 miles (600 km) 
above the Earth. It took this 
photo of the universe!
It can get really cold  
in space because the 
stars and galaxies  
are so spread out.  
Astronomers are 
scientists who  
study space.

The solar
system
The solar system is made up of our nearest  
star, the sun, and everything that orbits, or 
travels around, it. This include planets, moons, 
comets, asteroids, smaller rocks, and dust.
Our star
The sun is a medium-
sized star. The sun’s 
powerful force of  
gravity pulls on the 
planets, keeping them  
in orbit around it.
Venus has thousands  
of volcanoes on its surface.
Mercury is the 
smallest planet in 
the solar system.  
It’s a little bigger 
than our moon.
Earth is the only 
planet that we 
know for sure  
has life on it.
Many spacecraft have 
visited Mars to study 
its weather, surface, 
and rocks.
The sun is a kind  
of star that scientists  
call a yellow dwarf.
Scientists think the 
asteroid belt contains 
the leftover rocks 
from when the planets  
were formed.

Mars is known as  
the “Red Planet”  
because its dusty surface 
contains rust.
People have  
invented ways to study 
and travel around our 
solar system.

Milky Way
Our solar system is part of a galaxy called  
the Milky Way. It is spiral in shape and has  
more than 100 billion stars. Scientists think there  
is a huge black hole, sucking in dust, gas, and 
light, at its center.
You are here!
Jupiter is by far the 
largest planet in our 
solar system. It is 
made mostly of gas 
and has more than 
60 moons orbiting it.
Neptune is the  
farthest planet from  
the sun, so it is  
freezing cold!
Saturn has more  
than 50 moons. It  
is most famous for  
its rings, which are 
made of lumps of  
ice and rock.
The Kuiper belt is  
a very distant part of  
the solar system. It is 
the home of icy dwarf 
planets and comets.

Launched in 1977, the 
space probe Voyager 2 
reached Neptune in 1989.
Unlike the other  
planets, Uranus spins  
on its side. This might 
have been caused by  
a collision with an 
Earth-sized object.
Pluto is the largest 
dwarf planet in the 
Kuiper belt.
If it were possible, it 
would take a jumbo jet 
about 400 years to fly 
from Earth to Neptune.
Jupiter is so huge that  
all the other planets  
in the solar system  
could fit inside it.

The surface of the sun  
is a sizzling hot 11,000°F 
(6,000°C). That’s 30 times 
hotter than an oven!

At the sun’s core, 
temperatures 
soar to around  
27 million °F  
(15 million °C)! 
Solar flares
Gigantic explosions on  
the sun’s surface blast 
energy outward. These  
are called solar flares. 
Sunspots
Dark, cooler patches that 
develop on the sun’s 
surface are known as 
sunspots. They often 
appear in pairs and  
last a few weeks. 

13
Life on Earth
Animals and plants depend on energy 
from the sun to survive. Technology, 
such as solar panels, has been 
developed to absorb the sun’s  
energy and turn it into electricity.
Lightning  
speed
Light travels really fast, but it still 
takes time to get to us on Earth. A 
light-year is the distance a beam  
of light would travel in one year. 
Solar prominences
Huge eruptions from the  
sun’s surface are called  
solar prominences. They  
form loops due to the sun’s 
invisible magnetic field. 
It takes eight minutes 
for the sun’s light  
to reach Earth. 
Solar panels
Some sunshine is good  
for us. We need it to make 
vitamin D, which helps our 
bones stay healthy.
8 minutes
Total solar eclipse
A total solar eclipse 
occurs when the moon 
passes in front of the 
sun and covers its face 
perfectly. This blocks 
out most of the light, 
making it appear as if 
it were nighttime.

Seasons
We have different seasons on  
Earth because the planet is slightly 
tilted. This means that at different 
times of the year different parts of 
the planet are closer to the sun. 
Sun rays
The middle of the planet, 
the equator, gets a fairly 
constant amount of 
direct sunshine.
Earth’s axis is tilted  
at an angle of 23.5˚. 
Countries near the equator 
have a wet and a dry season, 
rather than spring, summer,  
fall, and winter.
Summer happens in  
the northern half of the 
world when that part is 
tilted toward the sun.

Everything on Earth is made 
from materials that were created 
when dying stars exploded. Even 
you are made of stardust!

Inside the Earth
The Earth is made many different layers, 
a bit like an onion. The rocky outer 
layer is the crust. The upper and lower 
mantles consist of hot rock, while the 
outer and inner cores are hot metal.
Oceans make up most 
of the Earth’s surface, 
so our planet looks  
blue from space. 
The Earth spins around an 
imaginary line through its middle, 
called an axis, once a day. This is 
why we have day and night. 
It is colder in the winter 
because the sunlight  
is weaker.
Land takes up  
about one-third of 
the Earth’s surface. 

16
Auroras happen  
when tiny particles from  
the sun hit particles in  
our atmosphere.
The Earth’s 
atmosphere
The atmosphere is a blanket of gases that surrounds  
and protects the Earth. It keeps us warm, blocks 
some of the sun’s harmful rays, and helps 
stop space rocks from hitting us.
Auroras
These dazzling colored lights 
dance in the night sky in places 
close to the North and South 
Poles. They are also called the 
northern and southern lights.
Meteorites
Space rocks that make it 
through our atmosphere and  
hit the ground without burning 
up are called meteorites.
Airplanes
Planes usually cruise at about 
6–8 miles (9–12 km) high. There 
are often strong winds at these 
heights, which can make flights 
turbulent, or bumpy.
Weather balloon
Launched every day, 
weather balloons help 
forecasters predict the 
weather. The balloons 
carry small tools to 
measure things, such  
as air temperature  
and wind speed.
Planes fly high up, where  
the air is thinner. This means 
they can travel easier and 
faster, and burn less fuel.

17
Astronauts have flown out 
several times to service the 
Hubble Space Telescope.
Exosphere
Scientists divide our atmosphere  
into five main layers. The exosphere 
is the outermost layer before outer 
space begins.  
Mesosphere
Most space rocks that enter  
the atmosphere burn up in  
the mesosphere. The top of  
this layer is the coldest part  
of the Earth’s atmosphere.
Stratosphere
The stratosphere contains the ozone 
layer. Ozone is a form of oxygen.  
It stops harmful ultraviolet rays from 
the sun reaching the Earth.
Troposphere
All of our weather happens  
in the troposphere. It contains 
most of the air we breathe and  
a lot of water, including clouds.
Thermosphere
This layer protects us by 
absorbing a lot of the 
dangerous energy from  
the sun, such as X-rays. 
Hubble Space Telescope
Launched in 1990, this  
space telescope travels 
around the Earth, taking 
amazing photographs of 
distant stars and galaxies.
International Space Station
This space station has a crew of up 
to six astronauts. Each stays about 
six months, looking after the station 
and doing experiments. It orbits the 
Earth once every 90 minutes. 
Venus’s atmosphere
Venus’s atmosphere contains thick layers  
of deadly sulfur-containing clouds. Heat  
from the sun becomes trapped below  
these clouds. This makes Venus the  
hottest planet in the solar system.
Venus’s clouds trap heat  
below them.
The gas carbon  
dioxide makes up 96.5%  
of Venus’s atmosphere.

Orbiting the Earth
The moon travels around the Earth about 
once every 27 days. The moon appears  
to change shape in the sky depending  
on which parts of it are lit by the sun.

Rocket power
To get to the moon, humans 
had to first develop a rocket 
powerful enough to launch the 
Apollo spacecrafts into space.
The heat produced 
by a rocket could 
heat 85,000 homes 
for a day!
Rockets travel at about 
22,000 mph (35,400 kph). 
That’s pretty fast!
There is no air on the 
moon, so astronauts have 
to wear spacesuits so they 
can breathe.

The
water cycle
All the water on Earth moves around in a 
cycle. It rises into the air as moisture and 
clouds. Rain and snow bring it back to the 
Earth. It then flows along rivers into the 
oceans, and the cycle goes on.
Evaporation
Oceans, rivers, and lakes are 
warmed by the sun. As they heat  
up, liquid water at the surface turns 
into water vapor, which is a gas. 
This process is called evaporation.
Clouds
As water vapor rises, it cools 
into tiny liquid droplets, which 
gather to form clouds. This 
process is called condensation.
Water has been used to 
transport people and goods 
for thousands of years.
Water droplets 
freeze into ice 
crystals in very 
high clouds.
The sun plays a key part  
in the water cycle. It heats 
the Earth, causing liquid 
water to become gas.
20
Seawater contains 
minerals, which is why 
it tastes very salty.

Rain and snow
When a cloud holds enough 
water droplets or ice crystals, 
it makes rain or snow. This 
water falls back to Earth.
Back to the sea
Rainwater flows over and under 
the Earth, slowly making its way 
back to the oceans. The water 
picks up minerals on its journey.
Dams are built to break 
the flow of rivers. We  
do this to create lakes, 
generate electricity,  
or prevent floods. 
Winter sports  
such as skiing rely 
on a good amount 
of snowfall!
Rainwater is almost pure 
water, except where it has 
been polluted by fumes from 
vehicles and factories.
Groundwater is water in 
the soil or rocks in the 
ground. It may flow in 
underground rivers.
21

22
Liquids
If you can pour something, 
then it’s probably a liquid. 
Liquids take on the shape  
of the container they’re in. 
However, they’re hard to 
squash down. 
Solids, liquids,
and gases
The molecules in a 
liquid are close but 
aren’t held together 
as strongly as in a 
solid. This lets them 
move past each 
other, or flow.
Everything around us is a solid, 
liquid, or gas. They are all made  
of something we call “matter.” 
This, in turn, is made up of 
tiny particles called atoms 
and molecules.

Solids
Solids feel firm and are  
hard to squash. This book is 
solid, and so are things that  
you can hold, wear, or sit on.
Gases
Gases are all around us—the air is 
made up of gases. A gas will fill 
any container and can be squashed. 
Most gases are invisible.
Evaporation 
When they are heated, 
molecules jump out of 
liquids and become 
gas. This is called 
evaporation. 
Melting
When a solid heats up, its particles 
vibrate. When it reaches a temperature 
called the melting point, its particles 
break free and become liquid.
Freezing
A liquid freezes to a 
solid at a temperature 
called the freezing point.  
The particles in a solid are 
packed together so tightly 
that they make a fixed shape. 
Gas molecules are  
spread out and move  
around very quickly.
Condensation
When a gas cools, it 
turns into a liquid. 
This is condensation.  
If you breathe out 
water vapor onto a  
cold surface, such as  
a window, it condenses 
into water droplets.
23

The
weather
The weather affects what people do 
everyday. One of the reasons it happens 
is because the sun heats up the air, 
causing it to move around. This creates 
lots of different types of weather.
Snow
When cloud temperatures are 32°F 
(0°C) or below, water droplets in the 
clouds freeze. They form delicate ice 
crystals and fall as snow!
Rain
Clouds are made up of 
millions of water droplets 
that fall as rain when they 
get too heavy. Rainbows 
form when it is raining and 
sunny at the same time!
Thunder  
and lightning
Thunderstorms are electrical storms 
that normally happen in hot, humid 
weather. Lightning is like a giant 
electrical spark. Thunder is the 
sound caused by lightning.
Snow chains are put  
on tires in winter to give 
vehicles more grip. 
24
Snowplows clear 
heavy snowfall to 
make travel easier. 
Can you paint all  
the colors of  
the rainbow?

Fog
Tiny water droplets hanging in 
the air create cloud at ground 
level. This is called fog and it is 
a form of water vapor. Thick 
fog can make it hard to see 
into the distance.
Wind
Wind is caused by warm air 
rising and cold air rushing in 
to take its place. 
Sun
Some parts of the Earth get 
more sunshine than others. 
That’s why it’s cold at the 
North Pole and hot in the 
Caribbean.
Weather 
satellites
Weather satellites help 
forecasters to see what 
the weather is doing.  
This makes it easier to 
predict how it might  
move or change in  
the near future. 
These satellites watch 
storms as they move 
across the Earth.
Special instruments 
help pilots land 
planes safely in fog.
25
Large solar panels 
and batteries  
power satellites. 

26
Dangerous
planet
The top, rocky layer of the Earth  
is made up of gigantic plates that 
float on a layer of hot rock. Where 
these plates meet, earthquakes and 
volcanoes are common.  
Earthquakes
When plates collide or 
scrape against each other, 
pressure builds up. After  
this pressure is released, 
shock waves travel through 
the ground. This is known as 
an earthquake and it can be 
very dangerous.
Tsunamis
Earthquakes happen underwater, 
too. When they occur, it can cause 
water levels to rise and create 
gigantic waves called tsunamis. 
They travel at great speeds and  
can cause a lot of destruction. 
The point on the ground 
directly above the red dot is 
the epicenter. This is where 
the most damage occurs. 
Earthquake strength is 
measured using the Richter 
scale. Over eight on the scale 
is a very strong earthquake!
In places where earthquakes are 
common, buildings are designed 
to wobble but not collapse.
Seismographs 
record the 
movement of  
the Earth.
The red dot is called  
the hypocenter.  
This is where an 
earthquake begins. 

27
Volcanoes
Volcanoes are openings in the 
ground where hot, melted rock, 
called magma, escapes from deep 
underground. It’s best not to be 
near a volcano when it’s erupting! 
A magma chamber  
is a pool of hot,  
melted rock. 
Lava can ooze  
from cracks in 
the sides of  
a volcano.
The main vent  
is the biggest  
opening for 
magma to escape. 
When magma 
flows out of a 
volcano it is 
called lava.
A thermometer measures  
lava temperature, which  
gets as hot as 1,300-2,400°F 
(700-1,300°C)!
Scientists take measurements 
of changes in the volcano’s 
shape, vibrations, and gases to 
try to predict when the next 
eruption might be.

28
Animals
There are millions of different types of animal 
in the world. Scientists divide them into two 
groups—vertebrates and invertebrates. 
However, all animals have things in common, 
such as breathing air, moving around to  
find food, and sensing the world.
Vertebrates
These animals have a  
backbone and a skull. A strong 
skeleton inside their bodies lets 
them grow larger than 
invertebrates.
Mammals
Mammals have hair and  
are warm-blooded. They give  
birth to live babies, which they 
feed with milk. You are  
a mammal!
Birds
Birds have feathers, wings,  
and a hollow skeleton. Most can  
fly, but some, such as penguins, 
cannot. Birds lay eggs and  
are warm-blooded.
Reptiles
Reptiles have scaly skin 
and are cold-blooded. Most 
lay eggs. Apart from snakes, 
almost all other types of  
reptiles have four legs.
Amphibians
Amphibians, such as frogs  
and newts, live in water and  
on land. They are cold-blooded 
and have moist skin.
Fish
Fish live in water, breathe  
in oxygen using gills, and are 
cold-blooded. They have fins  
to help them swim.
Cold-blooded 
animals sunbathe 
to warm up  
their bodies.
Pandas spend  
16 hours each day  
eating bamboo.
Less than 5% of all the 
different types of animal 
are vertebrates. There are 
many, many more types  
of invertebrates.

29
Invertebrates
These animals don’t have a 
backbone, or spine. Some, such 
as slugs, are soft and squishy. 
Others, such as insects, have  
an exoskeleton, which is a  
kind of shell.
Insects
Insects have six legs, two 
antennae, or feelers, on their  
head, an exoskeleton, and many 
can fly. There are more than 
one million known types  
of insects.
Mollusks
Mollusks have soft bodies. Many, 
including snails and clams, have 
hard shells. Most live in water— 
for example octopuses—but  
those living on land must 
keep damp.
Crustaceans
Most crustaceans, such as  
crabs, lobsters, and shrimps,  
live in or around water. They 
have hard shells.
Arachnids
Spiders, ticks, mites, scorpions,  
and daddy longlegs are all  
types of arachnids. They all  
have eight legs.
Echinoderms
These spiny-skinned animals do 
not have brains! They include 
starfish and sea urchins, and 
live on the ocean floor. 
If a starfish loses one 
of its arms, it can grow 
a new one to replace it!
Small and tall
Animals come in all shapes and 
sizes. Some are so small you need a 
microscope to see them. Bumblebee 
bats are the smallest mammals, 
while giraffes are the tallest  
animals in the world!
Octopuses are the 
cleverest invertebrates. 
It’s been found that they 
can solve problems to  
get food.

Plants
From daisies to palm trees, there are  
thousands of different types of plants  
in the world. They provide us with 
oxygen to breathe, many kinds of food, 
and wood to make homes and furniture.
Plant parts
Many plants are made 
up of similar parts. They 
have roots in the soil,  
strong stems, leaves  
growing from the stems,  
and sometimes flowers.
Farming
Farmers grow crops, such as corn, 
wheat, fruit, vegetables, and cotton. 
They give their crops fertilizers, 
which are extra nutrients, to make 
them grow bigger and faster.
Stem
The stem supports the 
plant, and both water and 
food travel along it. We get 
wood from tree stems.
Leaves
A plant’s leaves absorb sunlight, 
which is used to make food for 
the plant. The leaves also  
release oxygen into the air.
Roots
The roots anchor  
the plant and absorb 
water and nutrients 
from the soil.
Stamens
These parts of the 
flower make a fine 
powder called pollen.
Plants get their  
energy from sunlight.
Engineers and scientists 
change crops to improve 
them—for example, so  
they don’t get diseases.
Stigma
This part of the 
flower has a skicky 
end. It collects pollen 
to make seeds. 
30
Some plants have 
flowers, some lose their 
leaves in the winter, and 
some even eat insects!

Insects
Insects spread pollen between flowers 
so that they can make seeds. Many 
flowers attract insects with a sweet 
liquid called nectar. When they come 
to drink it, the pollen sticks to them.
Fruit
Fruit have seeds inside them. 
When animals eat fruit, the 
seeds come out in their feces. 
This way, the seeds are 
carried to new areas, where 
they grow into new plants.
Butterflies can 
carry pollen  
long distances.
Bees are the 
most important 
pollen carriers.
Fungi
Mushrooms and toadstools are not 
plants. They belong to a kingdom of 
living things called fungi. They feed 
on living or dead plants and animals 
and soak up their nutrients.
Mushroom
31
Machinery lets farmers 
plow, sow, or harvest huge 
fields of crops quickly. 
Apples, nuts, tomatoes, 
grapes, cucumbers,  
and pumpkins are all  
types of fruit.

32
Evolution
Over time, animals and plants change, or 
adapt, so they can survive in their environment 
for longer and have more babies. This is  
called evolution. Evolution isn’t a quick  
process—it takes millions of years!
Pakicetus
Pakicetus lived on land, possibly 
near water. It had four hoofed  
feet and sharp teeth for chewing  
flesh or plants. 
Darwin
Charles Darwin was a scientist  
who studied how animals and  
plants changed over time. He  
came up with the theory of  
evolution to explain what he saw. 
Short legs and 
padded feet were 
perfect for paddling 
in water. 
Natural selection means 
that some living things 
are better at surviving 
than others.
Whale evolution
Incredibly, the ancestors of whales  
lived on land! Over time, they grew 
bigger and bigger and moved to 
different places, including the ocean.
Ambulocetus
Ambulocetus evolved from  
pakicetus. It lived in water  
and hunted like a crocodile. 
The powerful 
long tail helped 
to steer in water.

Breeding
It’s hard to imagine that a 
chihuahua evolved from a  
wolf, but it did! Humans breed 
dogs for herding, security, 
companionship, and even for 
their appearance.
Paleontologists are scientists  
who study fossils—the remains  
of ancient animals and plants.
Bowhead whale
By the time the bowhead whale evolved, 
it had grown enormously in size, with 
an appetite to match. They feed 
on a massive 220,000 lb 
(100,000 kg) of 
plankton a year!

Twelve million years later, 
the front feet had evolved 
into flippers and had 
become webbed.

The Arctic
food web
Animals need food to give them the 
energy they need to move and think. A 
food web shows what different animals 
in a particular place, or habitat, eat—
and how they all link together.
Polar bear
Polar bears are apex 
predators, which means 
they eat other animals, 
such as ringed seals, but 
no animals eat them.
Arctic tern
These seabirds catch fish by 
diving into the water at great 
speeds. Adults are safe from 
predators, but their eggs and 
chicks are not. 
Killer whale
Killer whales hunt in  
the ocean and also grab 
unsuspecting seals near  
the water’s edge. They  
are apex predators, too. 
Polar bears have white 
fur so they blend into 
their surroundings. 
The killer whale  
is also known  
as an orca.
34

Draw your own
To draw your own food web, start 
by choosing a habitat, such as a 
forest or a desert. Now think about 
what the animals in that habitat eat 
and show how they link together.
Arctic cod
These fish are a food source  
for many marine animals.  
Arctic cod eat plankton,  
shrimp, marine worms, and 
sometimes even each other!
Ringed seal
This meat-eating animal 
eats fish, shrimp, and 
plankton, but is hunted 
and eaten by polar  
bears and killer whales.
Plankton
Tiny drifting animals and 
plants called plankton are 
eaten by Arctic cod and 
coldwater shrimp. 
Coldwater shrimp
Coldwater shrimp live near  
the ocean floor and mostly  
eat plankton. They make a  
tasty snack for seals. 
Some plankton are so 
small they can’t be seen 
with the naked eye.
35
Plant plankton  
rely on the sun  
for energy.

36
Ecosystems
Plants and animals live and interact  
with each other and their surroundings  
in communities called ecosystems. 
Ecosystems can be as small as a tree  
trunk or as large as a rain forest.
American desert
The deserts of southwest US  
are extremely hot but lots of 
animals and plants live there. 
Animals avoid the heat of the 
day by hunting at night, and 
plants can survive a long time 
without any rain. 
The biggest coral reef  
is the Great Barrier 
Reef off the coast of 
eastern Australia.
Coyotes survive 
in many different 
places because 
they will eat 
whatever is 
available! 
The organ pipe 
cactus opens its 
flowers at night.
The great horned owl 
makes its nests on saguaro 
cactuses, where its eggs 
will be safe from predators.
The saguaro 
cactus is the 
largest cactus 
in the US.
This rattlesnake will shake 
the rattle on the end of its 
tail if it feels threatened.
The sharp spines  
will put off any  
egg thieves!

37
Under the sea
Coral reefs are amazing underwater 
structures formed by living creatures. 
They grow in warm, shallow waters in 
tropical regions and are home to a 
dazzling variety of life.
...while clownfish 
scare off fish who 
want to eat the 
anemone!
Reefs are home to 
all sorts of fish.
Golden eagles have incredible 
eyesight for spotting prey  
from great distances. 
The banded sea 
krait is a type of 
sea snake.
This type of coral is 
called table coral.
Mountains
The Himalayan mountain range 
in Asia is a tough place to live. 
Animals and plants have to 
cope with extreme cold, storms, 
and living at great heights.
Mount Everest in the 
Himalayas is the world’s 
highest mountain.
Wild goats, like this 
markhor, munch 
plants and spread 
seeds in their dung. 
Pikas are hunted 
by golden eagles. 
Snow leopards are 
incredibly rare. They eat 
wild sheep and goats. 
A stinging 
anemone provides

Inside a
rain forest
Tropical rain forests are made up  
of four different layers. Each one  
provides a home for different  
types of animals and plants.
Canopy 
The canopy is a thick layer 
of treetops that is home to 
animals, birds, and lots of 
climbing plants.
Understory 
Short trees and  
shrubs provide cover  
for small animals as 
well as predators  
such as jaguars.
Forest floor 
This is the darkest part of the 
rain forest. It’s muddy and 
covered in leaves that have 
fallen from the trees above.
Emergent layer
The tallest trees can reach 
heights of up to 180 ft (55 m). 
That’s a long way up!
Tree frogs 
rarely leave  
the canopy.
Sloths move  
very slowly.

Polluted planet
Fossil fuels, such as oil and coal, are the buried 
remains of ancient plants and other living things.
Burning them releases harmful gases, especially 
carbon dioxide (CO2), into the air. These gases 
heat up and pollute our planet.
40
Climate
change
Climate is the general weather conditions over  
a large area. It changes naturally over long 
periods of time. However, recently Earth’s climate 
has been getting warmer faster than usual.
Factories
Over the last few 
hundred years, many 
coal-burning factories 
were built. They pumped 
more CO2 into the 
atmosphere.
Chopping down forests
Trees soak up CO2 like a big sponge. By 
chopping down forests for lumber or to 
make farmland, we take away one of the 
best ways to remove CO2 from the air.
Motor vehicles
Cars and trucks use diesel and 
gasoline as fuel. These fuels are 
made from oil. Burning them 
releases CO2 into the air.
Carbon dioxide is called a 
“greenhouse gas” because it 
traps the sun’s energy in our 
atmosphere, heating the planet.

A greener future
Scientists and engineers now look for ways to 
make energy that do not burn fossil fuels. They 
are especially interested in energy sources that 
won’t ever run out, such as wind and sunlight. 
Flooding
Melting Arctic sea ice
41
Wind farms
Wind turbines make 
electricity from wind 
power rather than by 
burning fossil fuels. 
Groups of turbines 
are called wind farms.
Trees
Planting trees helps to fight 
climate change because plants 
absorb CO2 from the air. They 
use the carbon to make their 
own food and grow.
Solar panels
Solar panels absorb  
sunlight to make  
electricity and heat. 
Electric cars
These cars run on rechargeable batteries, 
rather than petrol. Because of this, they 
don’t pollute the air with CO2 and other 
harmful gases.
Experts predict that by 
2040, one-third of all cars 
bought will be electric cars. 
Every tree makes a 
difference. This little one 
could live for 200 years!
Effects of  
climate change 
A warmer climate can lead to extreme 
weather. Big storms are becoming 
more common, often causing flooding. 
Climate change is also melting the sea 
ice covering the Arctic Ocean.

42
Microlife
There are billions of very tiny living 
things around us, on us, and even  
inside us! Our eyes can just about  
see some of this microlife. However,  
we need to use a microscope to see  
how amazing they really are. 
Head lice
These tiny insects live in hair, 
usually children’s. They bite  
the scalp to feed on blood. 
However, apart from  
causing itching, they 
are not harmful. 
Dust mites
These blobby creatures eat bits 
of dead skin found in house 
dust and mold. They’re very 
hard to see because they’re tiny 
and almost see-through.
Tardigrades
Also called water bears, these 
little animals live in wet places, 
such as mud. They are super 
tough, can survive in space, 
and can go without food and 
water for more than 30 years!
Head lice glue their 
eggs, called nits,  
to shafts of hair.
Dust mites have  
many little hairs, 
called setae.
Head lice have two 
antennae, or feelers, 
on their heads.
Tardigrades have four 
pairs of chunky legs with 
tiny claws. Their name 
means “slow stepper.”

43
Viruses
Viruses are tiny things  
that can make people, 
animals, and plants sick.  
They enter cells and then 
make copies of themselves. 
Flu, colds, and measles are 
all caused by viruses.
Bacteria
Bacteria are microscopic living things, made 
of just one cell each. They are much smaller 
than the cells that make up our bodies. In 
fact, our bodies contain billions of bacteria! 
Some of these bacteria are useful, 
supplying us with important nutrients. 
However, others can cause nasty diseases.
This bacterium has 
started to split into 
two new cells.
Plankton
Plankton are living things that drift 
about in oceans, rivers, and lakes. 
Some are microscopic, or really 
tiny, but others, such as jellyfish, 
are much bigger. Many sea and 
freshwater animals eat plankton. 

44
The human
body
An adult human body  
contains 206 bones, 650 
muscles, and trillions of tiny 
building blocks called cells. 
Each part of the body has 
a different job to do, but 
they all work together 
to keep the body 
running smoothly.
Organs
Our body is made up of lots of 
different organs. The organs that 
help us digest food include the 
stomach, the liver, the intestines, 
and the kidneys. Even our skin  
is an organ!
X-rays are  
not just used to  
look at bones, they  
also scan luggage  
at airports. 
The liver has more than  
500 jobs. We wouldn’t be 
able to survive for more 
than two days without it!
The human body is made up  
of systems. The nervous system 
controls how we think, feel, and 
move, the immune system fights 
sickness, and the digestive system 
turns food into energy.
Lungs transport 
oxygen from the 
air into our 
bloodstream.

Bones
Newborn babies have more than 300 
bones. By the time we reach adulthood, 
some bones have joined together to 
make 206 in total. They fit together to 
form the skeleton, protecting our inner 
organs and keeping us upright. 
Muscles
Muscles are the stretchy cords 
connected to our bones that  
allow us to move. Some muscles 
work without us having to think 
about them, while others are 
controlled by our brain.
Skin
Skin is the waterproof outer layer 
that stops us from injuring or infecting 
our insides. It is the biggest organ  
in the human body, making up  
15% of our weight!
Blood
The heart pumps blood around 
our body through tubes called 
blood vessels. Blood transports 
oxygen to parts of the body 
and fights germs.
X-rays allow us  
to see what our 
bones look like. 
Veins and arteries 
are blood vessels 
that carry blood to 
and from the heart. 

46
Two sides
The brain has two sides.
The left side controls the 
right side of our body, 
while the right side is in 
charge of the left side of 
the body!
Think
about it
Your brain may look like a big wobbly 
ball of jelly, but it works like an amazing 
supercomputer. It sits in your head and 
allows you to see, hear, talk, move, feel, 
think, imagine, and remember.

This part of your brain is 
where you keep all of your 
memories, like the first 
time you rode a bike or 
your last birthday party.
This part of the brain is 
in charge of how we move 
our bodies. It can tell us 
to walk, run, or dance!
The front part of the 
brain is all about your 
personality—how you 
behave, and what you 
like and don’t like.
This part of our 
brain allows us to 
speak to each other.
The more wrinkly

Coordination
This bit of the brain helps 
us to move smoothly. It’s 
useful for things such as 
walking and writing. 
The spinal cord carries messages 
to and from the brain.
Every time you touch 
something a message goes 
to this part of the brain. 
Being able to understand our 
surroundings helps us make 
good decisions about how to 
move around.
Understanding 
emotions, like 
happiness or sadness, 
helps us respond well 
to other people. 
Our brain receives 
information from our 
eyes and makes sense 
of what we’re seeing.
Artificial intelligence
Computers can be taught to think and 
make decisions like humans. This is 
called artificial intelligence (AI). Mobile 
phones use AI to help answer any 
questions you might have or tell you 
what’s on your calendar.
Nervous system
We have a huge network of 
nerves inside us, which link the 
brain and the spinal cord to 
the other parts of the body.
What’s the weather 
like today?
It’s raining. Take 
an umbrella!

The senses
Our senses let us understand the world  
around us. They tell us what’s safe and what’s 
dangerous, and let us see and hear each  
other. Special receptors in our bodies help  
us to sense our world. 
Sight
A lens inside each of  
our eyes focuses light 
onto the back of the 
eye. There, receptors 
sense brightness  
and colors.
Touch
The skin contains 
many receptors  
that react when  
we touch things.
Taste
Taste buds on the top of the 
tongue sense five different 
flavors. These are salty, sweet, 
sour, bitter, and a savory 
flavor called umami.
Smell
Tiny receptors inside  
the nose pick up many 
different odors. Smell 
is closely linked to the 
sense of taste.
The main senses
Sight, smell, touch, taste, and 
hearing are our five main 
senses. However, we also 
have other senses that  
help us survive.
48

Hearing
Sounds travel into the ears 
and are sensed by receptors 
in the inner ears, inside our 
head. The inner ears also give 
us our sense of balance.
Other senses
There are many other kinds  
of receptor in our bodies, 
checking what’s happening 
outside and inside us.
Heat
Receptors in the  
skin let us feel heat.
Needing the toilet
Receptors deeper inside our 
bodies let us know when it’s 
time to go to the toilet.
Pain
We have receptors 
in our bodies that 
let us feel pain.
49
Echolocation
Bats have a special sense called echolocation, which 
they use to catch flying insects at night. They make 
calls and listen for echoes as the calls bounce off the 
insects. This tells the bats exactly where the insects 
are. In a similar way, submarines use technology 
called SONAR to find other objects under the sea.
Bat
Submarine
A human eye contains 
more than 125 million 
receptors.

50
Technology
Technology uses science to create inventions. 
Often the aim of these inventions is to make our 
lives easier. Engineers use a series of steps to 
come up with new and exciting products. 
A problem
The first thing to do is to find the  
problem that needs solving. Ask  
questions to find out as much as  
you can so that you can properly 
understand the whole problem.

Ideas
Think of as many 
different ideas as  
you can at the start. 
Write or draw them all 
down so you can see 
everything in front of 
you. It’s great to work  
in a team to come up 
with as many ideas  
as possible. 
Research
Once you’ve decided 
on your best idea, it’s 
time to research. Find out 
what materials you will  
need to build your design.
Building
The first thing that you build is 
called a prototype. You’ll be able 
to see your idea coming to life 
and be able to spot anything you 
can tweak to make it better.
Improving the design
After you’ve made your 
invention, test it over and  
over again. You might come  
up with new ideas for how to 
make an improved version!
Next time we could try 
to design a vacuum 
cleaner without a cord.
Someone could trip 
over a cord or wire.
Engineers  
use lots of 
different tools.
Building your 
invention in stages 
makes it easier.
Wheels will make  
it easier to move  
a heavy object.

52
Simple
machines
Machines help us transport, fix, and power 
things. We have designed lots of different 
types of machine to carry out jobs, and  
many are surprisingly simple. 
Screw
Pointed metal screws hold 
things together. They are 
placed inside both parts 
that you want to join. You 
use a screwdriver to twist 
and push them in. 
The screw turns 
into place.

Wheel
These round parts help 
machines to get around. 
Different wheels are used for 
different surfaces. Grooved 
wheels suit slippery ground.

53
Pulley
If an object is very 
heavy, you can use a 
pulley to lift it. A rope is 
passed over the top of a 
wheel and attached to 
the weight. You pull  
on the rope to lift  
the weight.
Wedge
A triangular wedge is 
used to split things in 
two. The wedge is 
swung downward  
into the object.
Ramp
To raise or lower an object  
that is too heavy to lift,  
we can push it along 
smooth ramps that slope 
upward or downward. 
Lever
You use a lever to 
lift things. An example 
of a lever is a plank 
balanced on a single  
point called a fulcrum.
You wouldn’t be 
able to lift these 
weights by hand.
The weight is 
hooked onto 
the pulley.
This wheel is 
too heavy to 
move by hand.
The fulcrum is 
near the middle.
A wheeled cart 
carries the object.
If I push down 
here, the weights 
lift up!
An ax is a 
type of wedge.
Gears
Gears are connected wheels 
with sticking-out bits called 
spokes. A smaller, lighter 
wheel is turned by hand.  
The spokes catch the heavier  
wheel to push it around.

Time
We use time to work out when things 
happen—from dates in history to  
what time you have to get up in the 
morning. We measure time in seconds, 
minutes, hours, days, and years.

Body clock
We, and other animals, 
have a built-in, natural 
body clock. This tells  
us when we should be 
awake and when we 
should sleep. Our body 
clock is linked to light 
and darkness.
Time zones
The world is divided into 24 different 
time zones, one hour apart. When 
you’re having your breakfast, someone 
else in the world is having their dinner. 
Russia is so big it has 11 time zones! 
What’s the time? Well, that 
depends on where you are on 
Earth. It can be midnight in one 
place and midday in another!

Telling time
People have been telling 
the time for thousands of 
years. But it wasn’t until 
quite recently—1884  
to be exact—that time 
zones were established.
How shall I tell the time? 
Sundials use shadows, analog 
clocks have faces and hands 
that tick, and digital clocks 
display the time on a screen. 
If I walk from one time 
zone to another, am I  
time-traveling?
The International Date Line
Calendars help us 
keep track of days 
and months.
Months and years
One year on Earth is 365 days 
long. This is the time it takes the 
Earth to travel around the sun. 
One month is roughly how long 
it takes for the moon to travel 
around the Earth.

Measuring
Temperature
We measure temperature 
with thermometers. They 
tell you exactly how hot 
something is.
Time
In the past, people told the 
time using the sun and  
the moon. Today, we use  
clocks as our main 
timekeeping device. 
Height
How tall are you? Get 
someone to measure  
you with a tape measure. 
Now measure a friend. 
Who is taller?
Water boils at 
212°F (100°C).
We divide time  
into seconds, 
minutes, and hours. 
56
Tape measures, 
rulers, and even 
digital lasers 
measure height 
and distance. 
Chefs must use  
precise measurements  
of temperature and  
time when cooking. 
To find out how hot, how big, or how heavy 
something is we have to measure it. Special 
tools help us get accurate measurements.  
This is especially important when building  
a house or baking a cake! 

Volume
Volume is the amount of 
space something takes up. 
Volume measures size, not 
weight. Two objects might 
have the same volume but 
very different weights. 
Keep a record
Scientists note down measurements 
regularly, so they can see how things 
change over time. They use graphs 
and charts to compare measurements.  
Weight
Weight tells us how heavy 
something is. If you have a 
bathroom scale at home 
you can weigh yourself!
Kitchen scales 
help us weigh 
ingredients  
for cooking. 
Pints and cups  
are used to  
measure liquid.
Graphs make it 
easy to see how 
things are changing. 
57
In the US, 
people often 
use cups to 
measure 
volume. 

Using
numbers
We use numbers to count, measure, and 
compare amounts. Scientists and engineers 
have to be good at math—or their 
experiments and inventions won’t work!
Counting 
Counting different things  
allows us to compare them.  
For example, you could 
compare the number of spots 
on different ladybugs to see 
which type is the most common.
This could take a while... 
Ladybugs’ spots  
can vary in number. 
Tally charts 
have been 
used since  
the Stone Age!

Addition
Addition is usually the first 
type of math we learn. 
When adding numbers,  
it doesn’t matter what 
order they are in, the 
answer will be the same.
Subtraction
To subtract means to take away 
or make smaller. You have  
to take the second number 
away from the first number  
to get the answer.
Positions
Ordinal numbers tell you 
about the position, order, or 
sequence of something. 1st, 
2nd, and 3rd are examples 
of ordinal numbers.
2nd place  
is the silver 
medal position. 
This is called the 
minus sign.
The equals sign means 
that the sum and the 
answer are the same.
This is the answer.
This is the answer. 
This plus sign means add  
the two numbers together. 
Sports events  
reward 3rd place, too.

Materials
Everything around us is made of materials. 
Different materials have different qualities. 
Some, such as metals, are hard and strong. 
Others, such as plastics, can be easily 
molded, or shaped. Engineers, scientists, 
and designers create and use materials in 
lots of different ways. 
Ceramics
Ceramics are hard but break 
easily. They can cope with really 
high temperatures—space shuttles 
have ceramic tiles to protect them 
from extreme heat.
Glass
Glass is made from 
sand. It’s useful in 
windows because it 
can keep the weather 
out but still allow us  
to see through it. 
Metal
Metals are usually strong and easy 
to shape when heated. They are 
conductors, which means electricity 
and heat can travel through them. 
Some metals are magnetic.
Plastic
Plastic is a human-made 
material that has many 
different qualities. It is 
light, waterproof, and 
can be hard or soft.
People have been making  
ceramic pots and vases  
for thousands of years.
At very high  
temperatures, metals 
become soft and can  
be reshaped. 
60

Wood
Wood is a natural material 
that comes from trees. It is 
used to make homes and 
furniture. Different types of 
wood have different colors  
and grains, or patterns.
Fabric
Fabrics can be made 
from natural things, such 
as sheep’s wool, or be 
created in a factory. 
Scientists have created 
protective fabrics that  
are waterproof or that 
block the sun’s rays.
Composites
Combinations of two or more materials  
are called composites. They have the best 
qualities of the materials used to make them.
Plastic is easy 
to mold into 
lots of different 
shapes.
Wood is used to 
make paper and 
toilet paper, too! 
Carbon fiber  
is a very strong 
composite used to 
make surfboards. 
Fabrics can be 
dyed or patterned  
to make beautiful 
clothes.
61
Uh-oh! I’ll be in 
pain if I break  
this pane! 

62
Cantilever
A cantilever is a structure 
that is only supported  
at one end. To create  
a cantilever bridge, lots  
of these structures are 
joined together. 
Cable-stayed
A cable-stayed bridge has one  
or two towers. Cables fan directly 
down from these towers to the 
bridge base, holding it up. 
Log bridge
A log bridge is the most ancient 
form of bridge. It is made from 
trees that have fallen or are cut 
down on purpose. 
Suspension
In a suspension bridge, steel wires 
connect two tall towers that are sunk 
deep into the ground. The crossing 
hangs from these towers.
The cables can make 
interesting patterns.
Suspension  
bridges can span 
great distances.
Building
bridges
Bridges are designed by engineers to get 
us from one place to another as quickly 
as possible. They can cross canyons, 
rivers, roads, and train tracks.

63
Beam
A beam bridge is the simplest  
sort of bridge, combining  
a strong plank 
with supports 
at either end.
Arch
Arch bridges became popular  
during the Roman Empire. The arch 
transfers the weight of the bridge  
to the supports at either end. 
Bascule
A bascule bridge has one  
or two parts that can move 
upward to allow boats  
and ships through. 
These bridges  
take a long  
time to build. 
A bascule bridge  
is sometimes called  
a drawbridge. 
These piers support  
the bridge and go  
deep into the water.
More than 50 designs 
were suggested for 
London’s Tower Bridge.  
Arch bridges get 
stronger over time!

64
Take to
the skies
In order to fly, you have to overcome the force 
of gravity pulling you toward the ground. 
Helicopters and airplanes use rotors, wings, 
and engines to soar through the air.
Drag
Drag, or air resistance, is the 
force that pulls the helicopter 
backward. Drag increases as the 
helicopter moves faster.
Without a tail rotor  
the helicopter would  
turn in circles! 
In a hovering 
helicopter,  
all the forces  
balance exactly.
Dreams of flying
The Italian artist and inventor 
Leonardo da Vinci was fascinated 
with flying. He studied birds and 
drew many imaginary flying 
devices, such as a wing-flapping 
machine for humans.

Forces of flight
There are four main forces working on a 
helicopter as it flies. Drag tries to slow it down, 
gravity tries to bring it back to Earth, lift raises 
it upward, and thrust propels it forward. 
Tail rotor

65
Lift
Lift holds the helicopter in the  
air and is created by its rotors. 
It is the force that is the 
opposite of gravity.
Thrust
Thrust is the force that 
pushes the helicopter 
forward. It is created by 
the helicopter’s engine.
Gravity
Gravity pulls the 
helicopter in a downward 
direction, toward the 
center of the Earth. 
Cockpit
The cockpit 
contains all of the 
instruments and 
controls that allow the 
pilot to fly the helicopter.
Sycamore seeds 
are also called 
“helicopter seeds” 
because of the  
way they spin. 
Search and rescue 
helicopters have  
night-vision cameras. 
Planes use 
their wings 
to create lift.
Main rotor

66
Floating
A huge metal ship can 
float because it’s full  
of air. The amount of 
space the ship takes up 
weighs less than the 
equivalent, or same, 
amount of water.
Sinking
Objects sink if their weight is 
greater than the force of the 
water pushing them upward. 
Dense materials, such as metal 
and stone, usually sink, unless 
they have air inside them. 
Water pushes against 
the weight of the ship. 
The upward force of 
the water is greater 
than the ship’s weight, 
so the ship floats.
The weight of the metal  
ship, plus the air inside  
it, is less than the upward 
force of the water. 
The upward force 
of the water is less 
than the weight  
of the anchor.
The heavy, dense, metal 
anchor is specially 
designed to sink in water.
Scuba divers use inflatable 
jackets and weights to move 
up or down, or stay at the 
same depth underwater.
Why does the 
anchor sink while 
the ship floats? 

67
Floating and 
sinking
Why is a massive ship able to float when 
a small pebble quickly sinks? It depends 
on which is greater—the weight of the 
object in the water or the upward force 
of the water pushing against it.
Changing  
weight
Submarines can change their weight. 
They have tanks that can be filled with 
water to make the submarine heavier, 
or filled with air to make it lighter. This 
way, they can sink or rise.
Archimedes
Archimedes was a scientist 
in ancient Greece. He noticed 
that sinking objects push 
aside water. He worked out 
that an object will sink if it 
weighs more than the water 
it pushes aside. If it weighs 
less, it will float.
Going down
When the submarine takes  
water into its tanks, the extra  
weight makes the submarine heavier 
compared to the water around it.  
The submarine then sinks.
At the surface
The submarine’s tanks are filled with 
air when it’s floating at the surface. 
Tanks fill with  
air to make the 
submarine rise.
Tanks fill with  
water to make the 
submarine sink.
Submarines can stay 
underwater, with people 
living on them, for  
many months!
The largest submarines  
are 575 ft (175 m) long and  
have 160 crew members.
Eureka!
Archimedes figured out why things 
float or sink while having a bath!

68
Friction
When two surfaces rub against 
each other it creates a force called 
friction. Let’s take a look at a  
bicycle to see friction in action. 
How friction works
No surfaces are completely smooth— 
up-close they are covered in tiny  
bumps. When these catch on each  
other they slow down the moving  
object, in this case a tire, helping  
it grip the road. 
Rubber or metal 
pedals create friction 
to stop your feet 
from sliding.
Bike chains are 
greased with oil.
The wheel 
moves across 
the ground. 
Friction with the ground 
slows the wheel. 
Friction between the brake 
pads and the wheels slows 
the bike down. 
There’s friction between  
your clothes and the  
seat. This stops you  
from falling off!
Oil reduces friction so the 
chain moves smoothly.
Rubbing your hands 
together creates 
friction, which 
produces heat. 

69
Overcoming 
friction
Skis are flat, smooth,  
and lightweight. This  
allows them to slide over  
icy surfaces easily, because 
less friction occurs when 
surfaces are smooth.
As a parachute falls, the air 
pushes back up against it. 
This is a type of friction 
called air resistance. 
Tires are now often made  
from Kevlar® to prevent punctures. 
Kevlar® is a very strong and  
light manmade material. 
Handlebars are often 
textured to create  
friction. This makes  
them easy to grip.
Mountain bikes have 
thick, grooved tires to 
grip uneven trails. Racing 
bikes have thin, smoother  
tires to move fast on roads.
The lighter the  
bike, the quicker  
it moves!

Electricity
Electricity is a type of energy that is used to 
power many everyday objects, from light bulbs 
to TVs. Take a look around your home and see 
how many electrical devices you can spot. 
Batteries
Batteries are small 
objects that can create 
their own electricity. 
They’re often used for 
remote controls, radios,  
and flashlights.  
Without electricity, 
vacuum cleaners 
wouldn’t be able to 
suck up dirt.
70
Electrical gadgets make my  
life easier at home! Although  
I wish someone else would  
do the vacuuming… 
Power lines carry 
electricity over long 
distances—from 
power stations  
into our homes. 

Wires
Metal is a conductor. This 
means that it lets electricity 
pass through it. Wires  
have metal inside them  
and plastic on the outside. 
The plastic is an insulator  
that stops electricity  
from escaping.
Light bulb
Can you imagine life  
before the light bulb?  
It wasn’t so long ago that 
people used candles and  
oil lamps to work once it got 
dark. Now we have light  
with the flick of a switch!
Switch
Switches control most electrical 
things around the home. Turn them 
on to start the flow of electricity,  
or turn them off to stop it.
Lights should be 
turned off when  
not needed! 
Tablets, computers, 
and cellphones give 
off light, too.

The battery in my toothbrush 
can be recharged and used 
many times, so my teeth are

During storms, water particles in 
clouds bump into each other. This 
can create electricity in the form 
of lightning.
Solar panels absorb sunlight  
to make electricity. This is  
a renewable, or replaceable,  
source of energy. 

72
The
Internet
The Internet is a worldwide network of 
computers that are connected together. Using 
the Internet you can chat with friends in 
faraway places, buy a new pair of shoes, 
watch the latest blockbuster, and much more!
Social networking
Social networking is a way of using 
your computer to talk to other people 
all over the world. It’s important to 
stay safe online, so only connect with 
people you know and never give out 
personal details, such as your 
address or phone number.
Maps
Smartphones have clever 
systems that can tell exactly 
where you are on Earth. 
From this, they can tell you 
the best way to get from one 
place to another using maps.
We can use the 
Internet to make 
video calls—even  
to people in space!
Most smartphones 
can tell you how 
long it will take you 
to get somewhere!
A smartwatch links to 
your smartphone using 
the Internet and lets you 
make calls, pay for things, 
and play music.
Webcams can be used to 
video chat with people, 
or can be set up to  
study areas, like nature 
reserves, for a long time. 
Smartphones  
are computers 
that we carry in 
our pockets.

73
Shopping
Lots of people use the Internet to  
buy food, clothes, books, and more 
without having to leave the house.  
It can all be ordered, paid for, and 
delivered straight to your front door! 
Speedy parcels
Viruses
When a computer virus 
spreads it can slow a 
computer down or stop 
it from working 
altogether. One of  
the main ways a  
virus spreads is when 
we download things 
from the Internet.  
Research
The Internet lets  
us find out more 
information on our 
favorite subjects and  
learn more about the  
things that interest us.
Streaming
We can use the Internet to watch 
TV shows, films, and funny cat 
videos, or listen to music by our 
favorite singers or bands.
Vans drive all over 
the world with 
Internet deliveries.
You can buy  
presents and get  
them delivered  
right to your 
friends and family.
You can even get 
same-day delivery!
Pick a topic and 
see how much you 
can find out about 
it online.
Since its invention, the 
Internet has completely 
changed the way we live!

Robots
Robots are machines that can do jobs for 
us. They can be programmed by a computer 
to work alone, or they can be controlled  
by humans. Robotics is one of the most 
exciting areas of technology, with new 
robots being invented all the time.
Humanoid robots
Some robots are designed to 
copy the way humans look, 
move, and feel. These humanoid 
robots can do basic tasks and 
keep people company. 
Entertainment
Robots can entertain us. Some robots sing, 
dance, or play musical instruments. Pet 
robots are very popular, and some theme 
parks have huge robot dinosaurs.
Robotic dogs act like 
real dogs. They wag 
their tail and bark.

Body parts
Robotic body parts are attached to 
people with missing arms or legs. 
This lets them carry out everyday 
activities that they might not have 
been able to do before.

Domestic robots
Robots can perform the boring chores 
we don’t always enjoy doing. They can 
wash floors, clean windows, iron shirts, 
and even clean a cat’s litter box!
Security robots
Security robots are fitted with 
cameras and sensors. They can 
patrol large areas, such as 
shopping centers, on their own 
at any time of day or night.
Mobile robots
Robots are perfect for working 
in extreme conditions. They can 
go down cracks in glaciers, 
travel to the bottom of the sea, 
and even work in space!
A robotic vacuum 
cleaner moves  
around by itself.
A drone is a flying robot 
that can take photographs 
and videos.
If this roving security  
robot detects an intruder,  
it will alert its owner.
