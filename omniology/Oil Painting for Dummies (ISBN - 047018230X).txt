About the Authors
Anita Giddings is an artist and educator living in Indianapolis, Indiana. She holds a
Bachelor of Fine Arts degree from Herron School of Art and Design and a Master of
Fine Arts degree from Indiana State University. Giddings’ education and training is in
painting but her work also includes sculpture, photography, and installation.
Giddings began formal education in fine art when her high school art teacher, the late
Mrs. Elizabeth McCallister, made her go to art school. After graduating from Herron
School of Art in Indianapolis, she went to graduate school and received her Master of
Fine Arts degree in painting.
Giddings began teaching community education classes more than 20 years ago. She
particularly enjoys teaching painting and introducing her students to a greater appre-
ciation of art through art making. She is currently a faculty member of Herron School
of Art and Design in Indianapolis and also runs a program of studio classes for non-art
students on the campus of Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis.
Giddings met Sherry Stone Clifton when she returned to Herron to teach, and the two
have been friends ever since. When the opportunity came to write this book, Giddings
asked Stone Clifton to collaborate with her because of their shared philosophy of
teaching.
Sherry Stone Clifton grew up in a family dotted with self-taught artists. Her great-
grandfather made little paintings of animals and landscapes on scraps of cardboard
cut from box lids. Her mother dressed up furniture and other odds and ends around
the house with paintings. Her father retired from a career as a draftsman to work in
stained glass.
A scholarship landed her the opportunity to attend art school at Herron School of
Art and Design, where she studied printmaking and painting. She graduated with a
Bachelor of Fine Arts degree. After graduation, she taught non-art majors courses
in painting and drawing at Herron, beginning a teaching career that has spanned
20 years. She taught community outreach courses for all ages at Herron and the
Indianapolis Museum of Art. For several years now, she has been a Lecturer in
Foundation Studies at Herron, where she teaches drawing, color, 2-D design, and
creative processes for first-year art students. She has earned awards for teaching at
Herron and regularly speaks at conferences and publishes articles about teaching
beginning art students.
She says that she is first and foremost an artist. She believes that her artwork
enhances her teaching and that her teaching enhances her artwork. She has this to
say about teaching art:
“This book reflects the ideas about teaching art that I use in my classroom every day:
Learn to make art by making it. It’s important to look at actual art by the masters —
both old and contemporary. Read about art ideas and techniques. Drawing a little
every day and studying design and color will give your painting a strong foundation.
An open mind and healthy curiosity about the world is good. Beginning students are
very special to me. They have wonderful hopes and dreams, and I love helping them
make progress toward achieving them.”

late Mrs. Elizabeth McCallister. —AG

Oil Painting For Dummies 

Introduction
O
il painting. The words themselves bring to mind centuries of art. From
the masterpieces of the Renaissance to the charming landscapes that
you see in a shop on vacation, the rich, glowing colors are fascinating. Oil
painting makes it all look like magic. As an artist’s material, it both attracts
and intimidates with its possibilities. In this book we set out to introduce you
to this enduring medium. We want to give you as much information as we can
to make oil painting a part of your life.
Whether you’re trying oils for the very first time or you’re an experienced
painter, this book walks you through the ins and outs of oil painting. We
cover the basics, and we offer some information for those of you who have
pursued this wonderful endeavor for some time.
We include as much information as we can — both in technical matters as
well as how to see the world as an artist, as a painter. We know that there are
many books on oil painting. What sets this book apart are the step-by-step
projects that lead you to the fluent use of color in your paintings. We show
you how to depict three-dimensional forms and create dramatic and powerful
images. We also include a section that covers design in painting to guide you
in the creation of innovative and original artwork. Design is a part of every
painting, but we teach you how to hone your natural design instincts for
more effective and creative compositions.
Oil paint is the queen of materials for artists. Painting is what you go to see at
the museum; it’s what you think of when you hear the word “artist.” But oil
painting, with its 500-year history, can be intimidating. We give you as much
information as possible to get you off to a great start.
Writing this book follows very closely our philosophy as artists and teachers.
We firmly believe that the best way to gain an appreciation for fine art is to
share in the experience of art making. Learning to paint gives you firsthand
experience into what it means to be an artist. You learn not only to paint but
also to see the world as artists do. A whole world of painting will open up 
to you.
About This Book
It’s not uncommon for people to teach themselves how to draw. You pick up a
pencil and paper and go. But painting often seems like a mystery. Mixing
colors, the oils and solvents, so many brushes — where do you start? You
see programs on television, but the paintings all seem to come out looking
the same. We designed this book with you in mind. Through the lessons in
this book we teach you to paint the way YOU paint. We cover the basics of

honing your skills and lead you to develop new ones as you learn color, com-
position, and how to use oil paint.
Our book has an easy-to-follow format. After some basic lessons based on
working from direct observation, you have a chance to create your own
designs and approaches to making an oil painting. We try to include every-
thing that you need to learn to paint and to continue to explore painting for
years to come.
Our advice to you: Be patient with yourself, and give yourself room and time
to experiment. And have fun. Our philosophy is simple. We believe that anyone
can learn to paint. If you want it enough, if you can devote a bit of time 
(two to three hours a week) to this endeavor, and if you’re motivated enough
to buy the materials and set up an area to work, you can learn to paint.
Now, we’ll be honest with you. You have to tolerate being a rookie for a while.
You may have some lovely paintings right from the start, but expect to make
some awkward, funny-looking paintings until you get the hang of it. But the
rewards are great. When you’re first learning to paint, every painting shows
your increased knowledge.
Conventions Used in This Book
To help you navigate this book we set up a few conventions:
 We use italics for emphasis and to highlight new ideas and terms that we
define within the reading.
 We use boldface text to indicate a set of numbered steps (you follow
these steps for many of the projects). We also use boldface to highlight
keywords or phrases in bulleted lists.
 The main painting projects in the book have their own project headings
so that you can easily identify them as you flip through the chapters.
Ancillary projects are flagged with the Try It icon.
 Every project tells you what you need, when you need it. Before you
start any project, read all the way through the steps to make sure that
you have the supplies you need.
What You’re Not To Read
We wrote this book so that you can find information easily. We put absolutely
everything that we could think of into this book and we believe that it’s all
essential information to help you learn to paint with oil. But you can skip
over some material. Some info is more technical or describes a particular
approach that may not apply to every situation. Feel free not to read the 
following:
2
Oil Painting For Dummies 

 Text in sidebars: Sidebars (those gray-shaded text boxes) allow us to
include every possible thing associated with oil painting. Although they
include useful information, they aren’t entirely necessary reading.
 Anything with the Technical Stuff icon attached: This information is
interesting but not critical to your understanding of the topic at hand.
In addition, we know that you probably won’t read this book in exact sequen-
tial order. In fact, for most of you, skipping over Part I completely and going
to Part II first is the best way to proceed. This method gets you started paint-
ing right away. You can use Part I as a reference for any questions that you
have about supplies, tools, your work area setup, and so on.
We want to believe that you’ll soak up every word we wrote. But we know
that much of it may be too arcane to absorb in the initial reading. We hope
that you keep this info in mind as your skills develop and use our book as a
resource in the future.
Foolish Assumptions
In writing this book, we made some assumptions about you, our dear reader:
 You have the desire to pursue fine art painting, creating your own
images, and attempting to make the type of paintings that you see in a
museum or in art history books, as opposed to using oil paint for craft
applications.
 You’ve had experience with drawing, either self-taught or from lessons
you received at some point in your life. We assume that you can look at
something and draw a recognizable image of it.
 You may know little about art history, but you have an interest and an
appreciation for what you have encountered.
 You know nothing about painting or you may have tried to figure out 
oil painting on your own and not made much progress. We assume that
you may have tried to paint with oils on your own but are looking for
direction.
This book is basic enough to help the rookie painter painlessly figure out the
ins and outs of painting with oils. If you’re nervous about your drawing skills,
it’s possible to learn to paint while you develop your drawing skills.
If, on the other hand, you know a bit about this topic already, you’ll still find
something challenging to pursue. We also include projects and approaches
for the individual with more art experience. Check out the chapter headings
to look for specific topics or painting projects to hone your skills. And if you
have painted before, don’t be surprised if you find some info in the basic
lessons that fill in any gaps in your knowledge.

Introduction

How This Book Is Organized
This book is set up intentionally to be user-friendly. We try to cover topics
from buying supplies to step-by-step painting projects to developing paint-
ings with creativity and originality. Each part focuses on a different piece of
the painting process.
Part I: Getting Your Feet Wet in Oil Paint
In this section you find an overview of everything you need to get started,
from buying the materials to setting up a place to work. We also cover the
painting process and setting goals for learning to paint. We cover some of
these things in more detail later in the book, but start here to get the big 
picture.
Part I isn’t intended to be a step-by-step lesson; instead, it’s more of a refer-
ence to get you started with your supplies, paintings, and all the physical
things that you need to get in order to paint. If you want to start painting
right away, you can start with Part II, but be sure to flip to Part I when you
need to look up details.
Part II: Break Out the Brushes 
and Start Painting!
You really get down to painting in this part. If you’re an absolute rookie, you’ll
find our step-by-step projects clear and straightforward. If you have some
background in painting, you’ll still find the information valuable. We include
many things about oil painting that we’ve discovered in our years of painting,
most of which weren’t covered in our first painting classes.
We fill the chapters in this part with painting projects that we call studies.
These quick, informal paintings focus on the use of a particular set of colors
used in specific ways. They help you to build your knowledge and use of
color, leading you to a greater degree of fluency in the use of color in your
work.
Part III: People, Places, and Things
In this part we lead you through the main subjects of painting — the still life,
the landscape, and the portrait. You learn to paint a variety of objects in the
still life projects in Chapter 9; you discover several ways to tackle the most
popular topic in painting, the landscape, in Chapter 10 when we cover trees,
water, buildings, and depicting objects in the distance. It’s a comprehensive
chapter.

Oil Painting For Dummies 

We also walk you though how to paint a portrait in Chapters 11 and 12.
Within several projects, we show you how to proportion a face, the best
angle for a portrait, how to mix accurate flesh tones, and more.
Part IV: Color and Design
Painting is all about self-expression and communicating ideas in a visual way.
In Part IV, we help you begin to express your own ideas in painting by talking
about how to plan your painting and get your ideas down on paper, and look-
ing at ways you can use photographs as resources. We talk about good design
and show you ways to avoid the mistakes beginners make. We show you how
you can enhance your expressiveness by looking at ways that you can tie the
way you compose your painting to your ideas. Finally, we give you all the
tools you need to be an expert at using color in your painting.
Part V: The Part of Tens
This part covers what to do and where to go with your new interest. Check
out these chapters if you want to build on your new skills and get some inspi-
ration from other artists. 
Icons Used in This Book
In the margins of almost every page of this book, you find icons. They serve
the purpose of directing you to some particular types of information.
This icon saves you time and energy by letting you know an easier method
for doing something, or telling you where to look to find more information on
the topic we’re discussing.
Important information is present whenever you see this icon. It serves to
remind you that you need to remember this informative item for later.
Although the info in this book is user-friendly, sometimes we just have to
supply some very important details about oil painting. This icon indicates
some specialized information and may not be entirely necessary for the pro-
ject at hand, so feel free to skip over these sections.
This icon tells you what not to do and why, and when to expect those bumps
in the road. Its purpose is to save you time and energy — you have to learn
some lessons yourself, but when you can, learn from the mistakes of genera-
tions of painters!
5
Introduction

We use this icon to point out and define technical terms and other jargon that
you may hear when you’re immersed in the art world. Some of the terminol-
ogy behind these icons even helps you to become literate in the language of
art known in some circles as artspeak.
We use this icon to point out fun and informative exercises in the book. Try
these exercises to really embrace the lessons and become a better painter.
Where to Go From Here
You don’t have to go through this book in sequence. Part I is an overview 
of lots of practical information, and you can use it as a reference. If you’re
just starting out, we strongly encourage you to go through the projects in
Part II, step by step. If you’ve been painting for a while, check out Part II for a
refresher or to make sure that you know the basics. When you’re ready for
more of a challenge, head to Part III.

get started painting, from buying the materials to
putting your signature at the bottom. We also give you
some projects to put your skills to use along the way. This
section gives you a good overview of what it’s like to
paint. When you ﬁnish reading it, you’ll feel much more
conﬁdent about starting to paint.
We, your humble authors, believe in you. Our goal, more
than anything, is to teach you how to paint and give you
all the information and support that you need as you

picking up where you left off years ago, or beginning a
serious pursuit of painting, this is the place to begin.

Chapter 1
So You Want to Paint
In This Chapter
 Examining the history of oil painting and why it has endured for 500 years
 Discovering what it’s like to paint with oils
 Finding the materials and space you need to start painting
 Developing your skills for a lifelong interest in painting
T
here you are, standing in front of a painting in a museum or gallery or art
fair, and you have the desire to create a work of art. You may have had
this feeling for quite some time but you don’t know where to start. Or maybe
you’ve had lessons or a class in the past and it just didn’t work out. We know
that for many people, learning how to paint is a lifelong goal. And we firmly
believe in your ability to reach that goal.
To make a painting or other work of art is to become a part of the cultural
expression of your society. It is to create something personal, something of
beauty or significance that is your vision alone. We also know that for many
people, learning to make art is the best way to gain a true appreciation for
the arts. During this process you learn not only to paint but also to see the
world around you with an acute sense of perception. You grow to understand
the working process of painting and are able to see its evidence right on the
surface of a canvas.
If you’ve decided to learn to paint and you don’t know where to begin, we can
help. In this initial chapter, we give you an overview of this book and walk
you through the process of learning to paint, step by step. We try to make the
process understandable, painless, and fun. Collectively, we have more years
of experience than we care to admit, and we know that with patience, we can
open up this world to you. We’re unabashed promoters for learning to make
art and we’re very excited to have this opportunity to work with you in this
process. Take a few minutes to look over this chapter before you go running
off to the art supply store. And get ready for an enjoyable experience.
What It’s Like to Paint with Oils
Oil paint is made up of pigment, the stuff that gives the paint its color, and oil,
which allows it to flow off the brush well and to dry in a slow and measured
way. The oil in the paint is usually linseed oil, which dries slowly, but it does

dry (unlike mineral oils, which never thoroughly dry). Oil paint dries through
chemical action, as opposed to the process of evaporation in water-based liq-
uids. You need to understand this process in order to utilize all the proper-
ties of the oil paint to their best advantage.
The great thing about oil paint is that it’s creamy and dries slowly so that you
have time to paint an image. You can experiment with brushstrokes, blending
new colors, and expressing yourself with a wonderful art medium.
Please be aware that oil paint does have an odor. The smell of oil paint isn’t
acrid; it’s more of a nutty scent. After you’ve been painting for a while and
you set up your own studio, the smell of linseed oil when you open the door
to your studio in the morning can be very welcoming, but some people can
have an allergic reaction or otherwise find it undesirable.
If you suspect that you may have a negative reaction, purchase a tube of inex-
pensive color and test it. Find an inexpensive color, such as yellow ochre, and
take it home. Open the tube, squeeze a dime-sized pool of paint onto a paper
plate, and leave it nearby while you watch TV or do another quiet activity. If
your eyes become irritated and you wear contacts, try not wearing them
while you try the oil paint and be sure to have ventilation in your work area.
Some people have a reaction on their skin from the paint; if this is the case,
you can use latex gloves. 
Also be sure to test the solvent used with oil paint. Purchase a bottle of
Gamsol and put it to the same test. If the smell of the solvent is the problem,
you can try water-mixable paints such as Max oil paints made by Grumbacker
(there are other brands as well). If the oil paint itself bothers you, you may
want to try a water-based acrylic paint instead.
Gathering Your Materials
You need to know a few things about oil paints before you buy your paints
and supplies, so be sure to familiarize yourself with their general characteris-
tics before firing up your charge card. In this book, we get you started with
standard oil paints, but as you shop, you run into odd versions of oil paints,
such as the fast-drying alkyd paints or water-mixable oil paints. When you
have more experience, experiment with these kinds of oils, but for now, stick
with the more-traditional materials.
Some major brands are Daler-Rowney Georgian, Gamblin’s Sketching Oils,
Winsor Newton’s Winton series, Grumbacker’s Academy colors, and Shiva.
These brands are all student grade or inexpensive colors and are perfect for
the projects in this book. The paints we use in this book are a mix of these
manufacturers. Purchase tubes based on price, available colors, and the sizes
of the tubes available. The exact list of colors that you need is in Chapter 3.
In addition to the paints themselves, you need other equipment and supplies.
Here’s a quick overview:
10
Part I: Getting Your Feet Wet in Oil Paint 

 Solvent (use Turpenoid or Gamsol)
 Brushes
 A palette and palette knife
 Canvases to paint on
 An easel or something to support your painting while you work
Other useful items include a paint box for storing and carrying your supplies,
jars for your solvent, and special easels for outdoor painting. A complete
starter list of colors and all supplies is discussed in detail in Chapter 3.
Finding a Space to Paint
An important factor that you need to consider is where exactly you’re going
to get your painting done. Here’s what we advise:
 You need a space that’s approximately 8 x 8 feet. This minimal space
does well for the small painting projects that we lead you through in 
this book.
 Be sure to have good lighting, cleanable floor surfaces, and tabletops (in
case of spills).
If you’re working in a room with carpet, a plastic mat designed for home
offices works very well. Many artists get started by creating a studio in a
garage, a screened-in porch, or a utility room. A table, chair, and some inex-
pensive clamp lights or lamps can nicely transform a basement room into
your own studio.
Safety issues
The first thing we want to stress is that oil paint is an art material for adults,
not children.
Oil paints are quite safe to use, but you must be able to take safety seriously
in order to have an enjoyable experience and protect your health. You need
to be aware of two areas of concern: air quality and exposure to the skin.
Some oil paints contain toxic elements that your skin can absorb, so you must
handle them with safety in mind. Wearing disposable latex gloves is always a
good idea. If you’re allergic to latex, try some of the similar alternatives or
barrier cream. You can obtain appropriate gloves at any hardware store.
Ventilation is the first thing to consider for the area that you’re going to work
in. If you have windows that open and a fan to move the air out of your studio
area and living space, you can work comfortably. Paying attention to good
ventilation means that you aren’t exposing yourself and your family to annoy-
ing and potentially harmful odors from solvent vapors. You can also limit
your exposure if you habitually work with low-odor solvents like Turpenoid
and Gamsol.
11
Chapter 1: So You Want to Paint

To avoid fire hazards and protect the environment, properly handle and dis-
pose of solvents and solvent-soaked rags. You have many options for the safe
use and disposal of your discarded art materials. Call your local fire depart-
ment for specific instructions for your area to find out how to safely dispose
of solvents and other hazardous wastes. For more tips and ways you can
recycle your materials, refer to Chapter 3.
Also remember to maintain good studio habits. Cleaning up as you go, keep-
ing the paint off your skin, refraining from eating while you paint, and paint-
ing with your brushes — not your fingers — makes oil painting a safe pursuit
for you.
Painting in shared spaces
If you have children in the area where you paint, take precautions to make
sure that the materials are safely used and put away when you’re not there.
We can’t stress enough that good ventilation is critical — especially if chil-
dren are around. Be sure that you’re using low-odor solvents and keep the air
moving out of the room. Solvent vapors are heavier than the air in a room, so
they fall toward the floor. Children playing on the floor are therefore exposed
to the vapors more than you are.
Children love to paint too, so avoid tempting them by storing your paints and
supplies in locked cabinets above their reach, just as you would your kitchen
and bathroom cleaners. Store wet canvases well above their reach as well. If
they’re old enough, distract them with a supply of age-appropriate art materi-
als of their own.
Oil paints can also be a danger to pets. Set up a system to put your materials
and your wet paintings out of reach.
If good ventilation isn’t possible, you don’t have to give up on the idea of oil
painting. You can find several lines of high-quality water-mixable oils that
have nearly all the qualities of standard oil paints. Many artists who can’t tol-
erate working with standard oils and solvents use them with great results.
You can follow all the lessons in this book with water-mixable oils.
Keep all oil paint materials out of the way of anyone or anything that may be
harmed by touching, tasting, or smelling them. Be sure to handle and dispose
of solvents and used rags safely to avoid fire hazards and to protect the envi-
ronment. Oil painting is safe as long as you’re aware of how to properly
handle and care for your materials and paintings.
Starting Your Painting Adventure
To get started, you need to find an art materials supplier. If you live in a city,
paints and other materials are likely available from many suppliers in your
area, and you may be lucky enough to have a couple of well-stocked art
supply stores that cater to the specific needs of artists. Not every town is big
12
Part I: Getting Your Feet Wet in Oil Paint 

enough to support an art supply store, though, but hobby shops, craft and
fabric stores, and even “big box” discount stores often carry a selection of oil
painting materials.
You can find good sources for materials online as well, and sometimes the
discounts are very good. Many of these suppliers had well-known, mail-order
businesses before going online and carry a vast selection of art materials.
Checking out these suppliers is worth your while, even if you don’t like to
buy online, because they often provide information to help you make your
selection of materials.
Of course, in terms of helpful guidance, nothing beats a local art supply store
that’s owned or staffed by artists. A face-to-face discussion with a live human
being can be well worth the slightly higher price.
Shop around. Online prices can be very seductive, so be sure to factor in 
the shipping charges as you compare online prices with those of your local
sources.
We encourage you to explore different options for suppliers, but we advise you
to stick to the materials list in Chapter 3 to make sure that you get the right
supplies. We price out the basic set of materials that you need to get started
at $90 to $100. This initial investment sets you up with the materials that you
need for a long time. For the first few months, canvas should be the only mate-
rial that you use up. You may have to purchase another tube of paint from
time to time, but for the most part, the materials should last quite some time.
Chapter 3 outlines how to save money on your supplies, but you want to be
sure to get good-quality materials to make your artistic work enjoyable. Poor-
quality paints and brushes cause frustration and disappointing results.
Getting yourself organized to paint
Consider how much time, space, and funds you need to get started and what
you’re willing to commit to this endeavor. You can skimp on space and money,
but to improve, you need to make a consistent investment of time.
We suggest that you set aside two to three hours a week for a period of eight
to ten weeks in order to get a good start. That allows you to move smoothly
though the painting projects in this book, have enough time to enjoy the
work that you do, and develop some solid skills.
You need space to paint as well; we outline that info earlier in this chapter so
that you can consider your options. Also read over the section in Chapter 6
on setting up your workspace to paint.
The initial cash investment can be expensive. The budget that we suggest for
a solid supply list can give you a lot of flexibility, but don’t let lack of money
discourage you from painting. Remember that you can build your set of
paints in stages by buying only what you need for each set of assignments.
There’s no harm in spending a few months making black and white paintings.
You can call it your Gray Period!
13
Chapter 1: So You Want to Paint

Another important organizational skill is to take good care of your equipment
and supplies. Put the lids back on your tubes, clean your brushes and other
tools, and tidy your area to save time and money for your hobby.
Understanding the painting process
Before you begin painting, spend a bit of time looking over the basics of the
painting process. You’ll be working in a manner that artists refer to as general
to specific. This means that you lay out the basic shapes and colors of the
overall image before diving into the details. Painting in layers is one of the
main attributes of oil painting. The how-to section that covers applying paint
to canvas is good to read as well (see Chapter 6). And finally, proper cleanup
and storage of your equipment means that you can get started again quickly
and your materials will last a long time.
Developing the discipline to enhance your skills
Many people believe that artistic ability is based solely on talent — an inher-
ent quality that you’re born with. This isn’t the case. Some people do have a
keen interest in art that leads them to naturally devote time to developing
their skills even when they’re quite young. But at any point in your life you
can discover and choose to develop your artistic skill. Art is a discipline and
requires practice in order to increase skills and develop understanding and
the ability to express yourself artistically.
Some important parts of this process are having goals for what you want to
achieve with your painting and working toward those goals in stages. Don’t
be discouraged by those lovely 30-minute paintings that you see on TV. That
kind of painting is primarily about learning clever techniques — which you
can also learn — but bringing out the true painter in you takes patience.
Tolerate being a rookie for a while. You’ll enjoy the process and create some
nice pieces if you can relax and take it step by step. Learning to paint is like
learning a new language, sport, or how to cook; you have to start with the
basics and then work up to the special techniques. In painting, simple sub-
jects allow you to get used to the materials and build your skills so that you
can go on to more-complex subjects. At any point in the learning process you
can stop and repeat a project, using different colors or objects to work from.
Practice is important for any artistic pursuit, and honing your skills allows
you to successfully go on to more-demanding subjects, such as landscapes
and people.
Setting aside time to paint
As with any discipline, setting aside time to develop your skills is important.
Decide how much time you can devote to your painting, and then make a
schedule and stick to it. A two-hour session once or twice a week is good.
This is your time — don’t allow anything to interfere with your work. If you
can’t actually work on a painting, go to the library and check out some books
on art or go to a gallery or museum.
14
Part I: Getting Your Feet Wet in Oil Paint 

Set realistic goals for your work. Your first painting may look a little simple,
but remember to be patient. This book starts with simple paintings and
works through to more-complex subjects. At every point, we outline how to
evaluate each project or painting and how to gauge your progress. You must
tolerate being a rookie. Pay attention to the basic goals for each project and
you’ll be rewarded.
Developing Painting Skills
One common question is whether you need to learn to draw first. Drawing
skills are useful for painting, but you don’t have to have training in drawing
before you start to paint. If you’re self-taught in drawing and you think you
can make a reasonable image of something, you can start painting. If you can
draw something that you see from real life (as opposed to working from
photos or other artwork) and other people can recognize what it is, you’re
fine. Throughout this book, we give you tips to help you with the drawing
process while you’re leaning to paint.
The process of beginning a painting is to sketch in the various parts in a
wash first, and then apply paint to block in the major light and dark areas.
The next step is to make refinements to the colors and shapes. You can see
this process in the painting in Figure 1-1, which is a great example of an oil
painting done in layers. You start with a thin layer and gradually use more
paint, letting colors in the lower layers peek through.

15
Chapter 1: So You Want to Paint

The following steps outline the basic process of painting with oils:
1. Start with a simple sketch.
Your initial marks on a canvas make up the drawing in a wash, a thin,
fast-drying mixture of paint and solvent that’s easy to correct. During
this stage of the painting, you can make changes to your drawing of the
individual objects very easily. Each change in your sketch goes over the
last until you have the proper sizes and placement of all elements on
your canvas. Don’t ever try to erase or to clean marks off with solvent; it
only makes a mess. Just wait until it dries a bit and paint over the area.
2. Plan your design.
After you sketch the image on the canvas with your wash, you can see
the overall effect and predict how the painting will turn out. This all hap-
pens in the first 20 to 30 minutes of the painting. Our painting projects
lead you through the assessment of your efforts and guide you on how
to tell whether you have a good, solid design for your painting. At this
early stage you can still make changes in the layout of the image and
improve the overall design of the elements.
3. Apply the major colors.
After you have a good drawing and a solid design, you can start to block
in the major colors. Apply the appropriate color to each form on your
painting while making adjustments to the forms as you go. As you apply
the color to each form on your canvas, it takes on a more fleshed out
and substantial appearance. You also apply these colors in a thin mix-
ture of paint and solvent.
4. Work in layers.
At this point you have the basic colors — the lights and darks —
blocked in. Start to apply a heavier layer of paint to each of the forms.
This layer may be exactly the same color as the first layer, or you may
make subtle adjustments to the color, allowing the differences to peek
through and add complexity to your painting. The painting process is
fun and relaxing as you develop your painting layer by layer. We walk
you though this process in detail in the first painting projects. In later
projects, we introduce ways to make these layers work for you to create
beautiful effects.

W
hen you arrive at the art supply store or when you shop online, you
encounter a vast collection of paints, solvents, varnishes, and the 
like. You see displays with paint sets, individual tubes, and jars of goodness-
knows-what. This chapter covers the basic characteristics of oils and related
materials, including solvents, mediums, and other additives, and how to work
with them. Knowing what your paint is made of and how to use it allows you
to work with oil like a pro.
For the most part, the information we present here is for the beginner. But,
we know that you encounter a number of mystifying materials at the art
supply store; therefore, we also include some other, more-complex, materials.
Becoming familiar with all the different types of materials is important,
whether you’re a beginner or an advanced painter. When you know a mater-
ial’s purpose, you know whether it will be of any real use to you.
The Basics about Oils
Oil paint developed in the early 15th century in northern Europe. Up until
that time, artists primarily used tempera, an egg-yolk-based paint, for their
paintings. Artists who were using egg tempera added linseed oil to it to make
the colors transparent. And thus discovered oil paint.
This discovery was a great leap forward for artists. The linseed oil allowed
for a buildup of transparent layers of paint to create subtle and glowing
colors. Oil paint has been the epitome of painting ever since.
The main ingredients: Pigments and binder
The paint that you purchase in the store is a blend of pigment — the material
that gives paint its color — and binder, which “glues” the pigment to the sup-
port. In the case of oil paint, the binder is linseed oil. When you buy a tube of

paint, the proportion of pigment to binder, the quality of the pigments used,
and the way these two substances are mixed together determine the quality
of the paint.
You have the benefit of centuries of experimentation at your disposal. You
have so many grades, colors, and types of paint to pick from, and almost all
are top-quality paints. In years past, artists were subject to unstable paints
that changed color over time, as well as some very toxic pigments! The popu-
larity of oil painting and the good work of the American Society for Testing
and Materials (ASTM) have provided you with the assurance that your paints
are tested and safe.
Some toxic colors are still available. They have unique qualities that can’t be
perfectly substituted with safer materials. Artists who use materials such as
lead white or Naples yellow must be aware of the dangers of the materials
and take precautions. You have no reason to expose yourself to toxic materi-
als to pursue oil painting. Oil paint is safe and easy to work with if you always
look for the seal of the ASTM on the tubes of paint that you purchase and if
you handle the paint in the appropriate manner. The ASTM D 4236 seal
assures you that the product is properly labeled for health hazards. You can
also take precautions as you work. No matter what you see Van Gogh do in a
movie, don’t eat your paint.
Here are some precautions to take as you work with oil paints:
 Don’t eat anything while you’re painting.
 Don’t drink anything while you’re painting.
 Don’t smoke while you’re painting.
 Use adequate ventilation.
 Never sand an oil painting; the dust particles from the pigments are par-
ticularly dangerous.
 Don’t paint with your fingers.
The first three activities in this list may seem harmless to you, but they all
increase the chances of paint accidentally getting into your mouth.
The difference between the cheap 
and the expensive stuff
One of the types of paint that you see when you make your first purchase is
student-grade paints. Student-grade paints have a higher proportion of oil to
pigment than professional- or artist-grade paints. The cost is lower, which
allows you to do some serious experimentation without worrying that your
tube of paint costs as much as a dinner at a nice restaurant!
Some manufacturers may add fillers to the paints, especially student-grade
paints. These fillers shouldn’t affect the way the paint behaves as you use it.
Fillers aren’t necessarily a bad thing. They’re also used for pigments that
18
Part I: Getting Your Feet Wet in Oil Paint 

have tremendous tinting strength to make the paint more workable for the
artist. Fillers primarily affect the brilliance of the paint, but you generally
don’t notice it until you have more experience with color or until you com-
pare swatches of the student and professional grades side by side.
Another way that the manufacturer can make inexpensive student-grade
paints is to use substitute pigments. These colors have the word “hue” in the
pigment name. Some examples of hue colors are cadmium red light hue and
cerulean hue. These colors are identical to the originals in hue, but they may
not be quite as bright or opaque. Until you work with the original and the
substitute, you may not notice the difference.
You may also see colors such as Naples yellow hue and lead white hue, which
manufacturers made because the original versions are highly toxic. Again, the
hues behave in much the same way as the originals with regard to tinting
strength, opacity (hiding power), and so forth. Their color is almost impossi-
ble to detect as a substitute unless you’re an expert.
Occasionally when you first open a new tube of paint, a lot of oil comes out of
the tube, separated from the pigment. This is just linseed oil that has settled
out of the paint. Put the lid back on and knead the tube just a little to mix the
paint and oil back together again. If a lot of oil comes out of the tube, it’s up
to you whether to use it or take it back to the store.
Student-grade is great when you’re just starting out. You can go through as
much of the cheap stuff as you like and switch to the better pigments and
grades after you hone your skills.
How oil paints behave
Oil paint has a creamy, smooth consistency right out of the tube. Sometimes
the paint is denser in consistency — titanium white is one example — but
you can use most paints right out of the tube. For ease of use and creating
thin layers, use a combination of solvent and medium to modify the paint.
The solvent dilutes the paint, and the medium adds oil back into the paint to
achieve a creamy consistency and bind the pigment particles.
You’re likely to notice how slowly your paint is drying. The drying time for a
color varies depending on how thick the paint is, how much solvent you used,
and how much medium you added. You can also adjust the drying time by
using substances specially made to decrease the drying time of your paints.
The slow drying time of oil takes some getting used to. Keep in mind that the
slow drying time ensures that your painting is curing properly. Oil paint 
doesn’t dry the way that most people think of things drying, by evaporation
of liquid. Oil paint dries through the chemical process of curing. The paint
develops a skin of dry surface initially, but the paint itself takes quite some
time — maybe months — to dry completely. The process of curing also cre-
ates a hard film of dried linseed oil on the surface of the painting. This pro-
tects the painting and ensures that it will last for many, many years.

Chapter 2: Getting to Know Your Oils

Taking care of your paint
Here are some tips on caring for your tubes of paint:
 If a tube springs a leak along its side, you can save it by wrapping it in
heavy-duty aluminum foil. When you’re making such a mess with it that
you want to pitch the whole thing, go get a new tube.
 If you have lost or broken caps, you can again use foil to keep the paint
from setting up in the tube. In the end, you may have to throw it away.
Whenever you discard a tube of paint, keep the cap for these types of
problems.
 Keep the openings of the tubes clean. Wipe them off with a paper towel
to keep hard, dried paint from gumming up the threads of the screw top.
Clean out the lid in the same way so that it fits back on tightly. Keep a
set of pliers in your paint box for paint tubes that are difficult to open.
That should keep you from twisting the tube so much that the tube
breaks from the stress.
 One last thing, and maybe it goes without saying: Never use your teeth
to open a tube of paint!
The Characteristics of Pigments
Some manufacturers give you a lot of information on the tube. You may be
able to see what the pigment is, what type of oil is used to prepare the paint,
and whether the color is transparent or opaque — all very useful! But what
does all this information mean to you? Read on for a rundown of the topics
that you may see listed on the tube, on a display at the store, or in the suppli-
ers’ brochures.
The first thing you see is the name of the paint. Some names are classics,
such as cadmium or ultramarine, while others are specific to a brand or are
odd mixtures of several other colors. It can get confusing. Monostral blue is
also known as phthalo blue, thalo blue, or phthalocyanine blue. (Oh, and
they’re pronounced the way they’re spelled.) Sometimes colors vary from
one manufacturer to the other. Cadmium red light is one example; it can look
very orange in some brands and bright red in others.
You can also see other qualities of the paint. These include the texture of the
paint when you’re working with it, whether it’s coarse and gritty or very fine.
You see some qualities, such as the gloss of transparent colors and the dull
look of opaque colors, as the paint dries. Some of these qualities are an asset
to the finished painting. Some may need to be adjusted by applying the paint
differently or by adding different types of substances to paint.
Is it opaque or transparent?
One of the first qualities that you notice when you start working with your
paints is that some of them seem to need lots of coats in order to cover the
canvas, and others have a lot of hiding power. In this case, you’re seeing the
20
Part I: Getting Your Feet Wet in Oil Paint 

quality of transparency versus opacity. To find out which is which for a par-
ticular paint, read the labels or check out the chart in Figure 2-1 or at the
store. Or you can just test it yourself.
The degree of transparency or opacity is important because one of the chief
features of oil paint is the ability to work in transparent layers. Of the many
transparent pigments, you can find opaque and transparent versions of just
about any color that you want. Working transparently means that you can
create depth and complexity to the colors that you put in your painting.
Table 2-1 is a transparency chart that shows most of the paint that you’ll
encounter.

Just about all sources agree on whether a color is transparent or opaque. But
it can be a judgment call as to whether a pigment is only partially transpar-
ent. You can find conflicting information depending on the manufacturer or
the book you consult. In the end you have to decide how the paint works for
you. Here’s a project to examine this quality.
21
Chapter 2: Getting to Know Your Oils

Project: Painting in layers
The nature of painting dictates that two colors mixed together don’t look the
same as they do when they’re applied in two separate overlapping layers.
This project demonstrates how colors look when they’re applied in layers as
opposed to mixtures of two colors. See Figure 2-1 for an illustration of this
project, and follow these steps:
1. Use a #4 and/or a #6 flat or bright paintbrush to mix a quarter-sized
pool of cadmium yellow with solvent until it’s the consistency of 
Kool-aid; apply it to one side of your canvas paper or paper primed
with gesso.
Don’t cover more than half the canvas.
2. Clean your brushes, and then wait a day or two until the yellow is
completely dry.
The paint dries this quickly because of the amount of solvent and
because you applied it in a thin layer. See Chapter 3 for details on brush
cleaning.
3. Use the same techniques you use in Step 1 to mix a quarter-sized pool
of cadmium red light with solvent.
4. Apply the red mixture over the yellow.
5. If the red covers the yellow too completely and just looks red, wipe
some of the red away with dry paper towel.
You can see the yellow under the red. Looks like a sunset, eh?
6. For the second half of the experiment, make a mixture of the cadmium
yellow light and the cadmium red light; apply this mixture to the
other half of the canvas.
Try to have as much yellow in the color as red. You can try different pro-
portions of red or yellow, thick or thin, but it just won’t look like your
first experiment of layered colors. On the first side you can see both the
Figure 2-1:

two layers
of color as
opposed 
to using a
mixture of
two colors.
22
Part I: Getting Your Feet Wet in Oil Paint 

yellow and the red at the same time. The color is orange but you can see
the layers. On the second side the colors look solid orange without the
layers. We expand on this idea in Chapter 8 when we talk about all the
different ways to apply paint to canvas.
Tinting strengths
Most of the paint displays and brochures show the colors of the paint so that
you can select the color that you need. The swatch of color shows the paint
as it comes from the tube as well as a lighter version of the color. The lighter
version is the color mixed with white, usually on a one-to-one ratio — this is
the paint’s tinting strength.
If you have a color with a high tinting strength, test it before you use it in
quantity. Some colors have such a tremendous tinting strength that they get
in your way and hamper your work. When working with these strong colors,
start gradually, adding a small amount at a time to another color.
Phthalocyanine green is notorious for its tremendous tinting strength.
Coauthor Anita Giddings used it on a painting while in college. Everything on
the canvas turned the color of blue-green Tupperware: green buildings, green
streets, green sky. The professor took the tube away and forbade her to ever
use it again. 
Project: Studying your paint
Painters and printmakers use a process to study their paints and inks. You
can easily use the same process. You do these studies on index cards, so you
need at least one for every tube of paint you have.
1. Set out your paints, palette, palette knife, solvent, and paper towels.
2. Set a plain index card vertically, and write the name of a color at 
the top.
Leave room below the name for the three color samples you will apply
to the card.
3. Squeeze a small dot of that color to one side near the top of the card
under the written name.
4. Use your palette knife like a squeegee to scrape the paint as thinly as
you can down the length of the card.
This is called a draw down.
5. Beside the draw down at the top, paint a spot of color straight from
the tube.
6. Mix equal parts of your color and white and paint a spot of the color
next to the spot of tube color.
7. Look closely at the color of the draw down to determine whether the
color is transparent, opaque, or semi-transparent; write the result on
the card.
23
Chapter 2: Getting to Know Your Oils

If you see a lot of white paper showing through the paint, the color is
transparent. If you don’t, it’s opaque. It could also be in between, or
semi-transparent. Write what you see on the card anywhere.
8. Compare the color of the draw down to the painted color from the
tube to determine its undertone; write “no undertone,” “undertone is
warmer,” or “undertone is cooler” on the card as appropriate.
Some — but not all — colors have undertones. The thinned color of the
draw down will look warmer or cooler than the painted color. For exam-
ple, alizarin crimson has a warm undertone. The color of the draw down
looks more orange than the color of the body or mass of the paint. If the
color of the draw down and painted color match, the color has no
undertone.
9. Determine the tinting strength of your color by comparing the color of
the tube with the spot of color you mixed with white; write this info
on your card.
If the spot of color you mixed with white is only slightly lighter than 
the color from the tube, your pigment is very strong and has a high tint-
ing strength. If the white changed it significantly, your color has a low 
tinting strength.
Repeat this with each of your colors. Just doing this exercise will help you
learn the properties of each color. You can continue this experiment with any
new color you purchase as well.
The drying speeds of pigments
Oil paints by their nature are slow drying. This attribute is an asset to the
artist because it allows you to make subtle changes in your work, gradually
modifying the color or texture or apparent brushstrokes. Of course, it can
also make for some frustrating messes while you get used to it.
Different colors also vary as to the time that it takes to dry. Table 2-2 is a list
of paints and their relative drying speeds.

Try to be patient while you get used to the drying time of oil paints. If this
quality is really making you nuts, you can use drying mediums (we describe
them in the upcoming section “Mediums: Standard, glazing, drying, impasto,
and alkyd”). These mediums decrease the drying time for your oil paint to
days rather than weeks.
Remember that the slow drying time of oil paints is a normal characteristic
and is a part of the chemical curing action of the oils. If you work with your
paints in a normal way, they should dry to the touch in a few days.
Be careful about rushing the drying time of oil paint. Don’t try to speed the
drying by using heat or directing forced air on the painting. Not only is it bad
for the painting, but you may also burn your house down.
Adding Other Materials to Your Oil Paint
You can use oil paints right out of the tube, but the consistency is stiff. Paint
can have so much body that it feels like you’re painting with ice-cold butter.
Adding other materials to the paint — either to dilute the paint or to thin the
body of the paint by adding more oil — increases the variety of ways that you
can work with it.
So, aside from the actual paint that you work with, you also use a liquid to
help mix the paint, thin it, and improve the overall flow of the paint from the
brush onto the canvas. Read on to find out what to add when.
25
Chapter 2: Getting to Know Your Oils

Working fat over lean
Because of the way oil paint dries, you have to apply it in layers that don’t
interfere with the curing action of the paints. You can paint in a manner
called alla prima, a fancy Italian term meaning a painting that’s done all in
one sitting. If you intend to work on the painting for a longer period of time,
however, you must use the fat-over-lean method.
Working fat over lean means that you start the painting with a lean mixture of
paint and solvent. You use only solvent as a wetting solution. Then, for the
next layer of paint, you change to a mixture that uses a combination of sol-
vent and linseed oil. For the last layers, you use the fattiest mixture, using
more of the linseed oil to paint with.
What happens if you put a lean mixture of mostly solvent over a fatty layer of
paint mixed with a lot of linseed oil? It doesn’t work well. You may achieve a
nice effect initially, but later, when you look at the painting, you see a whitish
haze on the surface. This is called blooming, and it can’t be removed.
Another problem that can happen if you ignore the fat-over-lean rule is crack-
ing and crazing (also called alligatoring). A painting that cures unevenly will
crack and age prematurely.
Solvents
Turpentine is the traditional liquid that artists use to dilute oil paint, mix
painting mediums, and clean brushes. It has been the standard for centuries.
Unfortunately, most of the noxious smell associated with oil paint comes
from this liquid.
In place of traditional turpentine, we recommend that you use one of two
brands of odorless mineral spirits as a solvent: Gamsol or Turpenoid. These
two products are inexpensive and available in a convenient size (16 ounces is
good). They’re available just about everywhere:
 Turpenoid mineral spirits has been around for many years and may be
more widely available than Gamsol. It’s practically odorless, and you can
use it to make washes, mix with oils, or clean brushes. Be sure to buy
regular Turpenoid, not Turpenoid Natural, which has a stronger smell.
 Gamsol mineral spirits is made by Gamblin and has the least smell. You
can use it, too, to make a wash and to mix with oils and resins to make a
painting medium. It also cleans your brushes at the end of the day.
We strongly advise you not to use regular turpentine or mineral spirits that
are available at a hardware store. These are stinky, stinky substances and
they aren’t appropriate for oil painting on canvas.
Getting the solvent can open
Opening a can of Turpenoid or Gamsol can make you a little crazy. The manu-
facturer puts a metal lid inside the screw top to keep the cans from leaking in
the transit. The problem is getting it out. One way is to pry up the edge of the
26
Part I: Getting Your Feet Wet in Oil Paint 

metal plug and use needle-nosed pliers to pull it out. You may need an old
butter knife or painting knife to pry up the edge. You can also try to punch a
hole in the lid and then use your needle-nosed pliers to pull it out.
If you use an awl to punch two holes through the interior lid insert, you can
avoid removing the insert. Punch one hole for pouring, and punch the other
above it to allow air into the can so that the solvent can flow. You can pour
only small streams, but you shouldn’t need more than that.
Be patient, don’t get in a hurry, and have paper towels on hand for spills.
Working with solvents as you paint
Keep your solvent in two jars as you paint. Use one jar of solvent as a wetting
solution to dilute the paint in the early stages of the painting. Use the other
for cleaning your brushes as you work and at the end of the day before you
clean them with soap and water. Using two separate jars prevents the unin-
tentional mixing of colors.
Never leave your brushes standing in a jar of solvent. The bristles warp and
the glue holding the bristles in the brush deteriorates. You have no need to
keep your brushes in solvent — the paint on your brushes stays wet for
hours. Letting your brushes sit in solvent ruins your brushes very quickly.
Keep your brushes out of that jar of solvent!
Oil paint that you dilute with solvent dries very quickly, depending on how
much paint you use and the pigments (drying times vary with each color).
This quick-dry tendency allows you to create a quick oil sketch that you can
correct or use as an underpainting for the final painting. Sometimes you’re
happy with this quick sketch — it looks something like a watercolor painting.
The effect may be pleasing, but the painting isn’t stable. The solvent dissolves
the binder, the linseed oil in the paints, to such a degree that the pigments
don’t stay on the canvas. You can brush them off like dust. So you have to
add another layer of paint with oil in it for the painting to be complete.
Be sure that your canvas is properly prepared and primed. Painting with a
wash of odorless mineral spirits on a faulty canvas causes the oil paint to
soak through the canvas. Oil on raw canvas eventually rots.
Being safe with your solvents
Never use any solvent to clean your skin. Use soap and water only. If you
have a lot of paint on your skin, use baby oil to clean it. All solvent, whether
turpentine or odorless mineral spirits, works as a degreaser to your skin. 
It removes the natural oils of your skin; those oils function as a barrier to 
the harmful elements in paint and solvent. The solvents are also very toxic
themselves. They can be absorbed through the skin and cause serious health
problems.
You can apply a number of effective barrier creams to your hands before
painting. Not only do they prevent the absorption of toxic substances, but
they also make your hands easy to clean.
27
Chapter 2: Getting to Know Your Oils

Putting your old solvent to good use
After your solvent is completely dirty, you may wonder how to dispose of it.
This method is the most environmentally friendly: Don’t dispose of it at all.
If it gets too dirty to use, put a lid on the jar and set it aside in your painting
area. After a few weeks, the paint solids settle out of the solvent. Then you
can decant the clear solvent into another jar to use for painting. Some artists
actually like this substance. It contains a bit of the dissolved linseed oil from
the paints and has a creamier consistency than straight solvent. If you don’t
want to paint with it, you can use it to clean your brushes in your cleaning
solvent jar. Put the lid back on the jar that originally held the solvent, and
then you can dispose of the sludge as you would dispose of old house paint.
Contact your local Household Hazardous Waste disposal service for more
information.
Mediums: Standard, glazing, 
drying, impasto, and alkyd
A painting medium is an oily liquid that you use to adjust the body of the oil
paint. It can thin the paint, make it dry faster or slower, or make the paint
transparent or matte in appearance. It can even thicken the paint to the con-
sistency of cake icing! The most common type of medium for oil paint is what
the paint already has in it — linseed oil. The following premade mediums are
commonly available:
 Standard: A standard medium is a mixture of materials, usually turpen-
tine, linseed or other oils, and a resin. Each of these materials adds a
characteristic to the medium, whether it’s to aid in the drying, to pro-
vide a durable finish, or to keep the painting flexible on the canvas. You
can find various types of mediums in stores from the same suppliers
that make your paints.
 Drying: Some mediums speed drying of the painting; sometimes the
painting will dry overnight. These mediums have the addition of driers
that are tested for stability of the finished painting. Use care when you
use these mediums. If a painting dries too rapidly, it may crack or
develop fine hairline cracks over time.
 Glazing: You can use a glazing medium to create transparent layers of
color. The mixture is also fast drying to allow repeated buildup of layers
of glaze. You can apply a glaze to a painting in several ways. We describe
them in Chapter 8.
 Impasto: Impasto is a way of painting in thick layers. You can apply the
paint itself in a thick manner or you can use an impasto medium or gel.
Add the impasto medium to the paint on your palette to create a thick,
buttery mixture. Impasto mediums use either natural or synthetic oils
and resins to give the paint a thick body.
 Alkyds: Several companies make painting mediums with synthetic
resins known as alkyds. These mediums are very fast drying. Mediums
made with alkyd synthetic resins were invented in the last 50 years 
and now come in a variety of consistencies from thin to thick impasto
mixtures.
28

Special oils
The standard oil that’s used as a binder or to mix oil paints is linseed oil. It’s
the best choice because of cost, stability, and ease of use. But it does have its
drawbacks. Linseed oil yellows and darkens with age and dries too quickly
with some fast-drying pigments. In this case, the pigments are mixed with saf-
flower or poppy seed oil by the manufacturer. Take a look at the label of your
titanium white; it may use one of these two oils.
You can use safflower or poppy seed for any work that you want to remain
wet. Here’s a list of other oils and their characteristics:
 Stand oil: A polymerized linseed oil that yellows less than untreated lin-
seed oil; slow drying
 Walnut: Yellows less but must be used fresh; will turn rancid; slow
drying
 Sun-thickened linseed oil: Linseed oil that’s been exposed to air; a fast-
drying oil that’s preferable to refined linseed oil
 Refined linseed oil: Dries slowly and yellows over time
Varnishes and resins
You also sometimes see varnishes and resins available. These materials are
used to ensure the formation of a tough, durable skin on the paintings. You
can use them to make painting mediums or to make a final varnish. These
materials are a bit more-complex in their use and nature. If you really want to
know more about how to use them, we suggest that you enroll in classes.
What Not to Buy When 
You’re Starting Out
Some paints and materials aren’t necessary when you’re first starting out.
Either they’re too complex in the way that they must be used, or they’re too
costly. Either way, they interfere with the learning process. In the store, you
see an absolutely bewildering array of special paints, varnishes, resins, oils,
driers, mediums, thinners — most in expensive 2-ounce bottles! We cover
some of the items here and encourage you to think before you buy:
 Very cheap paints: Be careful buying very inexpensive paints, especially
if the brand is unknown. Generally, student-grade is great for starting
out, but you don’t want to invest a lot of money and time on paints that
are faulty. If you’re in a regular art supply store, you can ask whether the
store is familiar with the brand, how it differs from other brands, and
whether the line of paints has any drawbacks.
 Varnishes: You have no reason to varnish a painting unless you plan to
hang it in a smoky kitchen or bar. And in any case, varnishing a painting
too soon after it’s painted seals in the curing action and interferes with
the process. See Chapter 5 for more information on the care of paintings.
29
Chapter 2: Getting to Know Your Oils

 Soft body paints: This product is just paint with more oil in it. The most
common type of paint you see is a soft body white. White is usually
thicker and heavier than other tube paints. If you want a paint that flows
more or has a smoother consistency, you don’t need to purchase these
soft body paints. Just add some linseed oil to the regular paint on your
palette.
 Really big or small tubes: Sometimes getting a large tube of white paint
is a good idea, because you use so much of it. But oil paint lasts forever
(coauthor Anita Giddings has some tubes that are 30 years old). If you
get the large tubes, the repeated opening of the tubes stresses the metal,
causing it to break open. And then you have 100 ml of paint in your box.
Yuck! We recommend that you get the regular 37 ml tubes. And don’t
buy the little tubes unless they’re on sale; they aren’t worth the bother.
 Toxic pigments: Always look for the ASTM D 4236 seal on every tube of
paint that you buy. Don’t buy lead white, Naples yellow, or cobalt violet.
Plenty of other colors have a similar appearance and are also safe sub-
stitutes to these colors. Look for hue in the name and read the label for
warnings.

 Choosing basic safety equipment and other miscellaneous tools
A
fter you have a bit of information about your materials, it’s time to go
shopping. But even if you feel well informed, going to the art supply
store can be intimidating. You have to face all those brands, colors, sizes, 
and various types of materials. Where to start? This chapter gives you an
overview of the material you need and guidance on how to equip yourself for
this grand endeavor.
Buying Your Materials
You can find art supplies in many places today. You can go to a specialized
art supply store, but you can also find painting supplies and equipment at the
following locations:
 Craft shops
 Fabric stores
 Big box discount stores
 Online art suppliers
 Educational supply stores
Start with the phone book to see what’s available in your area. Specialized art
supply stores offer a wide array of supplies, and you can usually find a knowl-
edgeable staff to help you make your selection. But specialty shops can be
more expensive, and they aren’t in every town.
On the other hand, craft shops and discount stores have great prices, but
they may offer very little information. Either way, your best bet is to do a
little research in advance and go equipped with a list.

Making a supply list
Start with the supply list from the Cheat Sheet in the front of this book. In this
chapter, we give you more info about the materials in that list so that you can
make a decision depending on what you find in your area and your budget.
The supplies that we discuss in this section are the ones we recommend and
use when we teach painting. You can see an array of the these items in Figure
3-1. These supplies are the bare essentials that you need to get started.
Deciding on a budget
You have a choice about how you pursue painting. You can choose among
the many grades of paint and supplies, and you can decide individually what
your budget is. We want to be honest with you — painting can be an expen-
sive hobby. We have some tricks, however, to make it less expensive and still
end up with lovely results. We priced out the supply list at art supply stores
and online retailers and came up with a cost of between $70 and $90 in 2007.
You may be able to find other ways to cut costs as well.
We don’t want you to spend a fortune, but being economical with your sup-
plies isn’t always a good idea. Low-quality art supplies make the learning
experience more difficult. The paint doesn’t behave properly, the brushes
lose their hairs, and your palette knife may break. At the same time, we don’t
encourage you to be too extravagant with your budget. Being too careful with
your expensive equipment and paints may inhibit your learning as well. You
also run the risk of ruining some high-priced supplies that you don’t know
how to use quite yet.

ment you

Here are some options to save money:
 Do some research in your area for the best prices. Your area may not
have enough supply stores to create competition, so shopping online or
by telephone is also an option. Some well-known retailers are Michaels,
Dick Blick, Pearl Paints, ASW, and Daniel Smith. You can also find
smaller, locally-owned retailers in most medium-sized cities.
 Look for paint kits that have almost all the colors from our list. Be sure
to get regular-sized tubes (37 ml). Shop for a set that has most of the
colors from our list and then buy extra tubes of the missing colors. You
want to get exactly the colors that we recommend for our projects in
Chapter 7. And always make sure that the set is a good bargain.
 Paint on canvas paper instead of stretched canvas. Fredrix and other
brands make canvas paper pads.
To be more generous with your hobby:
 Invest in good-quality brushes.
 Obtain a nice paint box to carry and store your supplies.
 Use stretched canvases — your paintings will look so authentic!
 Invest in an easel; choose from either a full-sized or French easel (to take
outside) — both are good options.
 Buy frames for your completed work.
Start simple and then buy higher-quality equipment after you’re more familiar
with the process.
Choosing your colors wisely
This list includes the colors that are the most useful and the most economi-
cal for what you need. Some well-known name brands are Windsor Newton
Winton line, Grumbacher Academy colors, and Gamblin. Always buy the 37
ml tubes; the little guys (about the size of your little finger) just aren’t worth
the bother — unless you see them on sale for $1 each.
 Cadmium yellow light (hue): A brilliant light yellow. Buy the exact color
(not just plain old cadmium yellow; it must be “light”). If you can find a
hue version, all the better. Hue indicates that the manufacturer has used
substitute pigments. The substitutes are great for beginners because the
result looks just the same as real cadmium. The hue allows you to
indulge in some brilliant color without worrying about the cost.
 Cadmium red light (hue): A brilliant, opaque, bright red. Again, don’t
buy cadmium red hue unless it’s “light.” The regular versions are too
dark, and you can’t be as flexible in how you use them.
 Alizarin crimson: A transparent wine-colored red that’s used to make
violets and reds.
33
Chapter 3: Assembling Your Materials

 Ultramarine blue: A deep transparent blue. You may see it as French
ultramarine, which is the same color, but it’s made with substitute pig-
ments (and it sounds fancy). You can buy either one; the cost and
appearance are almost the same.
 Titanium white: A dense, opaque, and inexpensive white
 Mars black: An opaque black
Here are some optional colors you may also want to consider:
 Cerulean blue hue: This color is a lighter, more opaque blue than the
ultramarine; you may want it for a beautiful sky-blue or for water. Always
start out with the “hue” version so that you feel free to use as much as
you like.
 Yellow ochre: This mustard color of yellow makes the browns, natural
yellows, and oranges that you see in nature.
 Dioxazine purple: A deep, transparent blue-purple. This color is great
for mixing a wide range of violets, and it works well as a complementary
color for dulling oranges.
Choosing brushes
The brushes we recommend for the beginner are china bristle brushes. They’re
tough and durable, and they make a strong mark on the canvas. They’re tough
enough to stand up to the oil paint and still clean up nicely. China bristle
brushes are made from natural hair from pigs, and the fibers are a pale beige
color.
You can also find synthetic bristle brushes that work very well, but make
sure that they’re made for oil paints. Technology has greatly improved the
quality and affordability of brushes in the past several years. You can now
find a wide variety of synthetic bristle brushes that work for oil paints and
provide years of service at a good price.
Don’t let low cost rule the choices that you make. You can find inexpensive
brushes, but don’t get the bargain multi-pack brushes that you may find in
stores. The hairs will warp in all directions or fall out and become a perma-
nent part of your painting. They’re no bargain.
Aside from china bristle brushes, you’ll also see sable brushes. They’re softer
and more delicate and very expensive. The brushes are made with animal hair
or synthetic versions of those fibers. Sables are great for blending, glazing,
and making soft, less-defined marks. They take more care than the china bris-
tle brushes. After cleaning them, you have to reshape the bristles to prevent
the hairs from becoming permanently warped.
The two characteristics you notice in any brush are shape and size. The dif-
ferent shapes allow to you load paint onto the brush and apply the paint in
specific ways. Choose the size of the brush according to the size of your
painting.
34
Part I: Getting Your Feet Wet in Oil Paint

Selecting brush shapes
Here’s a list of the brush shapes that will be most useful to you:
 Flat: This brush has a clean, straight edge for applying color evenly to
an area.
 Bright: A bright is similar to a flat, but it has shorter bristles and makes
a distinct calligraphic mark.
 Round: You generally use this brush for drawing and any type of line.
 Filbert: Filberts are interesting almond-shaped brushes that make an
ovalish mark; they look like the round and the flat got together and had
a baby.
You can also find other types of brushes that are used for specific purposes.
For example, fan brushes are used for blending and textures, and long liner
brushes are used for lettering. You can experiment with the brushes and find
the size and shape that suit your working methods.
Brushes are sized by numbers based on the width of the brush at the ferrule,
the metal sleeve that holds the hairs in place. For the projects in this book,
your best choices are a #2 round and two or three others brushes — either
filberts, flats, or brights in sizes #4 through #8.
Choosing the right brush size
The size of the brush has a relationship to the size of your painting surface,
so you need a brush that makes a mark in proportion to the overall size of
the format. That means that a brush that’s 2 inches wide is designed for a
canvas that’s at least 2 or 3 feet in either direction. For a 14-x-18-inch canvas,
sizes #3 to #6 are best. For a 6-x-9-inch canvas, you need smaller brushes, and
for a large canvas of 3 x 4 feet or more, you need very large brushes.
The way you apply paint, your preferred size of brush, and the shape of the
brush are very much individual choices. We suggest that you start with the
four brushes we describe in “Selecting brush shapes.” These brushes will get
you started, and after three or four paintings, you’ll find that you prefer a par-
ticular shape. Then go out and get more! You’ll still need a variety of shapes.
Rounds are great for drawing lines, but not for filing in large areas of color. A
large flat fills in areas very well, but you have little control over the types of
marks it makes.
Choosing palettes
A palette is a portable surface that you use to hold your paint while you’re
working. You use the palette to create a blend of tube colors, to test colors,
and to create your selection of colors to use for a painting. The surface must
be smooth and impermeable to keep the paint from soaking into the surface.
The color of the palette must be neutral (white is best) so that you can see
and accurately judge the color that you’re making.
35
Chapter 3: Assembling Your Materials

The classic palette is a kidney-shaped wooden panel with a hole for your
thumb. This panel would be seasoned by applying oil to make the surface
smooth and impermeable. But today, most artists use a glass palette. The
glass palette has smooth, rounded edges and an enameled backing of white
paint. For the sake of convenience, many beginners use a disposable palette.
You can buy a glass palette or a disposable palette from art suppliers.
Disposable palette pads are made up of tear-off sheets for easy cleanup. They
come in various sizes — 11 x 14 inches is good — and are very convenient.
They do generate a lot of trash, and you have to keep purchasing more.
Finding the right palette knife
A palette knife is a necessary tool for every painter. We urge you to get a
metal palette knife, not a painting knife (which is very different) in either 
of the two shapes you see in Figure 3-2. Both types work very well. The 
spatula-shaped knife is more readily available. Its angled shape makes it easy
to mix the paint on the palette. The spade-shaped knife costs a bit more, but
it allows you to have more control while you mix the paint. After you use one
for a while, you can get different shapes and sizes, but artists commonly use
only one for years.
Don’t get a plastic palette knife — it’s worse than useless. It’s impossible to
clean, and it will break on you when you need it the most.
Choosing Surfaces to Paint On
Whether you’re using canvas, paper, cardboard, or whatever, the term for
what you put your image on is called a support. In this section, we give you 
a description of various types of supports and discuss the pros and cons 
of each.
Traditional supports include canvas, paper, cardboard, or a rigid panel, such
as Masonite. Stretched canvas is the most common. Any support must be
Figure 3-2:

shaped

36

primed before you apply any oil paint, but luckily, pre-made canvases, canvas
papers, and canvas pads come already primed and ready to go.
Pre-made supports are the easiest for beginners to use. Canvas panels,
stretched canvas (note the wooden stretcher bars visible on the back), and
canvas paper that comes in pads are great for their quality and convenience.
Canvas panels and stretched canvas are rigid and easy to use on a tabletop
or just propped up on a work table. Canvas paper isn’t rigid after you take it
off the pad, so you need something to tape or clip it to while you work. If you
use canvas paper, we suggest that you get a canvas panel (such as the type
made by Fredrix) one size bigger than your canvas paper, and either tape the
paper to the back of the panel or clip it with butterfly clips. You can also
work on the canvas paper while it’s still on the pad, but it’s messy to handle
when you want to take it off the pad.
Other Painting Equipment You Need
There’s more to painting than just paint, brushes, and canvas. This section
covers other tools and supplies that you need or may find useful depending
on your working style.
An easel
You need an easel. Get the heaviest one you can find so that it doesn’t walk
away from you as you paint. Some other options are floor easels or Julian (or
French) easels for outdoor painting. Prices for this piece of equipment are
$20 for a tabletop and over $100 for a full-sized easel. If you’re resourceful,
you can rig up something that works for you.
Positioning your painting surface at the correct angle for working is
absolutely necessary. When you look at your canvas, the surface should be
parallel to your face (see Chapter 5 for details). So, an easel, or something
you rig up yourself that does the same thing, is essential. Here are some
options for easels:
 To begin with, try propping your canvas against a heavy box on your
work table. If your work surface is slick and the painting is sliding, try
making a stop by duct-taping a piece of wood to the table.
 Look for paint boxes with easels built into them.
 A floor easel is great, but it can be expensive and it takes up a lot of
room if you don’t have a separate area for your work. If you find an inex-
pensive model made of three sticks that are 1 to 2 inches in thickness,
don’t bother wasting your money. This model skitters around the floor
as you work and collapses unexpectedly. Go to an art supply store and
try out the floor easels to see which works best for you.
37
Chapter 3: Assembling Your Materials

Painting tools
The following tools are useful for storage and cleanup:
 Jars: Use glass jars with lids to hold your solvents and painting medi-
ums. You need at least two: one for clean solvent that you use as a wet-
ting solution, and one for dirty solvent that you use to dissolve paint
from your brushes. You can use old recycled pickle jars (sized to hold
about 1⁄2 to 1 cup), or get fancy with specially made jars with a wire spiral
inside them. You can find them at most art suppliers. The wire helps you
clean the paint solids from your brush. The jar must be glass — solvent
eats through some plastics, so use glass to be safe.
 Pliers: Use this tool for hard-to-open tubes of paint.
 Paint box: Use this box to store and transport your tools and paints.
Some come with their own easel on the lid, which is handy to work from
and to transport the painting. A plastic bin with a handle works nicely,
too. Toolboxes sold at hardware stores are often more economical than
a paint box sold at art supply stores. They just don’t have all the fancy
compartments.
 Soap: You can use a bar of soap in a plastic container (as for traveling)
to clean your brushes and hands. You can buy special soap for cleaning
brushes that does a terrific job as well.
 Aluminum foil: Use this everyday item when you can’t clean your
brushes right away. Wrap the brushes until you can clean them (always
clean within an hour or so).
Health and safety
We talk more about health and safety in Chapters 2 and 4, but here are some
things that provide you some protection:
 Gloves: We recommend either latex or synthetic rubber gloves to keep
paint completely off your hands.
 Barrier cream: This hand cream creates a barrier to outside elements.
Avon’s silicone glove is one example. Barrier cream isn’t as good 
as gloves are, but it aids in your body’s natural defense to outside 
elements.
 Apron, old shirt, or something similar: You want something to keep the
paint off your clothes. An apron or old shirt will save your clothes from
paint, cleaner, or solvent accidents. Just let the paint dry on the fabric.
Sighting tools
The two main sighting tools are the viewfinder, to help you establish your
format, and a stick or paintbrush handle to help you find relative sizes and
proportions. We provide you with the viewfinder (check out the Cheat Sheet
at the front of this book), and you have the paintbrush handle in your regular
equipment.
38
Part I: Getting Your Feet Wet in Oil Paint

Viewfinder
A viewfinder allows you to set the format of your image — just like a
viewfinder on a camera. You can use the one from this book or you can make
one. Here are two options if you’re making your own:
 A bracketed viewfinder. This viewfinder is made of two mat board “L”
shapes (corners) that you clip together with paperclips, butterfly clips,
or tape. See the directions in Chapter 14 on how to make this type of
viewfinder.
 An index card or similar piece of cardboard with a rectangular
window cut into it. You can enhance this viewfinder with threads that
are taped in place to create cross hairs to aid in specific sighting (see
Figure 3-3 for an example).
The shape of the viewfinder’s opening must correspond to the shape of your
canvas. You have two ways to check this:
 Stand back from your canvas and look through the viewfinder. Make sure
that the edges of your canvas visually touch the edges of the window in
your viewfinder.
 Lay the viewfinder on the corner of your canvas. Lay a ruler or other
straight edge diagonally across the canvas so that the corners are con-
nected. If the straight edge passes exactly through the corner of your
viewfinder, it will work.
Skewer or other stick
You can use the handle of your paintbrush as a sighting tool. (See Chapter 6
for an explanation of how it works.) You can also use a pencil, a chopstick, a
kabob skewer, or anything that’s about 8 inches long, thin, and straight.

Chapter 3: Assembling Your Materials

Miscellaneous supplies
You can find lots of toys in the art stores, some useful to you and others not.
Here are a few:
 Wet canvas carrier: If you want to go somewhere to paint, whether it’s a
class or outside, these carriers are useful. You can carry your canvas
home without smudging your work.
 Fabric sleeve for brushes: These sleeves keep the bristles of your
brushes from becoming bent in your paint box. The sleeve is essentially
a piece of canvas with pockets sewn into it. You place your brushes in
the pockets, roll up the canvas, and store it. You can purchase one pre-
made or easily make your own.
 Adjustable plastic viewfinder: A little expensive for what it is, this
viewfinder looks a lot like a photo slide mount. It’s fairly handy but
smallish, which limits its use to distance work. It’s great for landscape
work, but limited for still life close-ups.
 Wooden mannequins/models: These tools are tabletop, humanlike fig-
ures made of geometric forms, and they’re usually wooden. You can use
them for still life objects if you want to, but they’re no substitute for
drawing from a real person. Get friends and family to model for you and
save your money.
 Specialty palettes: You can find any number of beautiful white palettes
made from ceramic or plastic. Nearly all are for watercolor painting and
aren’t appropriate for oil painting. Use your money for a good oil palette,
or use the disposable paper palette until you can get one.
 Specialty sketchbooks: Almost nothing is as tantalizing as a beautiful
sketchbook! Go for it!
 Canvas pliers: If you decide that you want to stretch your own canvases
on a regular basis, go out — no, run out — to get yourself a pair of canvas
pliers. You may find them only at art supply stores or online, but do the
work to find them. They’re relatively inexpensive — in the $15 range —
but they save you a lot of raw knuckles, and nothing gets your canvas
more taut. They’re specially designed to grip the canvas and pull it to
the backside of the stretcher so that you can staple it. (P.S. That hornlike
shape on the business end of the pliers acts as a fulcrum for pulling the
canvas.)

In This Chapter
 Finding a place to work
 Organizing your workspace
 Setting personal goals for you artwork
S
hopping for materials and tools is fun, but you need to consider other
things as you prepare to paint. You must set up your workspace so that it
serves your needs. Look for ways to minimize the impact painting has on
anyone sharing your living space. Establish a self-directed state of mind for
your endeavor by making a plan for studying painting. Each of these items on
your to-do list is just as important as obtaining your equipment.
In this chapter, we help you find a place to work. When you find this space,
you want to organize it to make it comfortable and inviting for you, while
making sure that it’s safe for everyone in your house. We help you establish
some personal goals for your work as you prepare yourself mentally for this
creative endeavor. As we say in Chapter 3, how much you want to invest in
this artistic pursuit is an individual decision. This chapter helps guide you
through some of the decisions that you make along the way.
Setting Up Your Space to Paint
Whether you get your impressions of an artist’s studio from old movies about
Van Gogh or the set designs for La Boheme, you’re probably starting with a
romanticized idea of the space you need to paint — most people do. A ram-
shackle room with an easel, a bare window, drapery and other props in the
corner, and broken furniture — and everything spattered with paint — is
many people’s fantasy of a “real” artist’s studio.
If you do have a spare room with some natural light, that’s lovely, but you
don’t need an ideal space to get started. Any space where you have adequate
light and ventilation, and are warm or cool enough to work, will do. What fol-
lows is a basic set of points to consider when selecting a place to work. We
also give you some practical suggestions.

When you start to work, you begin to discover your own priorities for your
studio. Some things to consider are:
 Ventilation
 Size of the space
 Attractiveness
 Type of light
 Noise level
 Privacy
 Permanence of working area (whether you have to put things away
every time)
 Cost of rent or cost of remodeling (if applicable)
 Ease of use (whether getting to or setting up for your work is difficult)
We discuss several of these factors in the following sections.
Make a list of characteristics that you want to see in a studio. Try to keep it
down to only what’s necessary. Prioritize the list for your own preferences
and make adjustments. You may find that after you paint for one or two
weeks, your priorities change. Maybe setting up in the family room wasn’t
such a good idea. Some options around your house are spare rooms, the
basement (be sure you have ventilation!), a three-season porch, a little-used
dining room (cover the table with a vinyl tablecloth or sheet laminate), or a
laundry room, utility room, or mudroom. You can also have a transient or
less-permanent space.
Deciding how much space you need
Initially, you have some practical size considerations for your space. You
need enough space to set up your tools, paint, and canvas, as well as enough
space to work. You also must be comfortable and safe while you work and
have enough space to back away from your painting to assess your progress.
A space that’s 6 x 6 feet, plus some extra room to back up from your work, is
a minimum. Figure 4-1 shows that you really don’t need a whole lot of space
to get your work done.
Safety, lighting, and overall size are major concerns, but you may want to
consider how friendly your space is. If you feel isolated, claustrophobic, or
otherwise uncomfortable, you’re less likely to use the space and pursue your
goals successfully. If the space is small, consider a mirror or mirror tiles to
give the illusion of space, especially if you can place them across from a
window. A plant, an art poster, and music to mask the other noises can make
a space more habitable.

Deciding where to set up
Whether you need privacy or don’t mind an audience is an individual prefer-
ence. Painting is an interesting pursuit (just look at Saturday afternoon public
television for an example), and you may find that you’re an irresistible force
when you’re working. People who live with you (both children and signifi-
cant others) may want to talk to you while you work, and you may find con-
centrating difficult. Pets are interested in you, too. You may have to consider
whether you’re going to have a cat in the middle of your palette, or someone
swatting your brushes or pawing your arm for attention. You may have a
space that you can use at a time when everyone else in the house is occu-
pied, or you can establish house rules that the basement, spare room, or
garage is off limits during your work time. Lockable doors or baby gates help
cut down on traffic, too.
Permanent or transient space?
Permanence is great if you value leaving your work, tools, and painting in
place until you return. After all, you can devote less time to putting things
away and taking them back out again. When you want to work, your equip-
ment is there, waiting for you. A studio can be an attractive space and a valu-
able addition to your home, as well. A work area with a painting in progress
and interesting paraphernalia can become an attractive part of the design of
your home, as you can see in Figure 4-2.

Chapter 4: Preparing to Paint

If having permanent space isn’t possible, and you’re resigned to being a
nomadic artist, you can make some adaptations. A toolbox to put things
away, a shelf dedicated to your painting equipment, and a couple of nails in
the wall to hang a painting transform a kitchen or laundry room into a studio.
A glass palette wrapped in foil keeps your paint fresh for days. (See Chapter 3
for details.)
Wherever you work, you need access to a sink for cleanup. You can use a util-
ity sink, a bathroom sink, or a kitchen sink. Along with being tidy in your
work habits, being tidy when you clean up pays off as well. You don’t have to
leave smears and stains of paint at the sink. Review the directions about
cleanup in Chapter 5 to cause the least amount of irritation for yourself and
your living companions. Learning to properly dispose of trash in a way that
doesn’t endanger your household or the planet is absolutely essential for the
environment.
The following is a list of pros and cons to consider when figuring out where
to set up your painting space:
 Basement: Permanent to semi-permanent. A basement usually has lots
of room, but it can be dark and unventilated. Be sure to have lots of
light, paint the walls white, and install mirrors, if necessary, to visually
expand the space.
 Three-season porch: Permanent to semi-permanent. This space has
great light, but temperature is an issue (for you, not the paint — 
the paint will be fine). Bonus: You can pretend that you’re painting 
outside — without bugs.
 Garage: Permanent to semi-permanent. A garage is similar to a base-
ment, but it has great ventilation. It can be cold or hot and dark. Paint
the walls white and make sure that you have lots of lights.

homey, no?
44
Part I: Getting Your Feet Wet in Oil Paint 

 Utility/mudroom/laundry room: Transient. These spaces are used for
storage and work, so they usually have lots of shelf space and light.
 Spare room or bedroom: Permanent to transient. Protect the floor with
plastic floor mats from an office supplier, and cover surfaces with vinyl
tablecloths.
 Kitchen: Transient. Protect surfaces with newspaper and vinyl table-
cloths. Pay extra attention to cleanup in this area where you prepare
food and eat.
 Off-site: Permanent to transient. You have to factor in rent, zoning, park-
ing, gas, and drive time, but you have a studio.
And what about having a real, dedicated studio?
If you’re lucky enough to have the space, you may be able to design a studio
to suit your needs and desires. If so, spend a bit of time reviewing the infor-
mation here to help you decide what your work area needs.
Two key things to try to incorporate into your studio are a sink and a sepa-
rate air source or exhaust fan. Windows provide natural light and give a
sense of expanded space. Being able to see out is important for some people,
and it can keep you focused and feeling good about where you are. Also, plan
for your lighting needs by wiring the space for artificial lighting to go along
with the natural light.
A regular-sized room (say 12 x 14 feet) is good, but bigger is better. The same
goes with ceiling heights. Eight feet is fine, but space above your head leaves
lots of room for ideas — and lifting large canvases. For furniture, find a sec-
ondhand table and an overstuffed chair to go along with your easel and
props, but keep it sparse. Don’t allow anything else to be stored in your
space if you can help it. Figure 4-3 shows an example of a full-blown studio.

Chapter 4: Preparing to Paint

Getting the basic furniture
You need some furniture so that you can set out your materials, supplies, and
work. You can find many variations on this setup, but your basic furniture
should accommodate a place to set up your painting, an area for your palette,
a spot for your still life setup, and a place for your lights. Oh, and something
for you to sit on. A table, lights, easel, and a stool should do the trick. These
furnishings are traditional, but if you’re creative, you can minimize not only
the amount of space that you need, but also the cash that you have to lay out
to get set up.
You can save space by using a wall as your easel. A stretched canvas can
hang on two nails, and you can work on the painting while it hangs. If you’re
using canvas paper or a canvas panel, hang a drawing board on the wall and
attach the paper or panel to the board with butterfly clips or tape. You
wouldn’t be the first person to staple the canvas directly to the wall, either,
but be prepared to lose your security deposit if you do.
Your tabletop can function as a place to put your palette and still life, but 
you may also be able to set up a tabletop easel or prop your canvas against
your paint box on it. (See Chapter 3 for more about easels.) You can use an
old table or desktop, and you should be able to tolerate smeared paint and
spilled solvent on it. Frequenting secondhand stores or garage sales and 
driving around the neighborhood the night before heavy trash pickup are
great ways to recycle old furniture into new, glamorous incarnations as
studio furniture.
You can protect your tabletops by investing in a piece of thin laminate that
you can use and put away when you aren’t working. Simply go to your local
builder’s supply store and ask the employees to cut it for you.
You need good lighting for working and for your setup. Natural light supple-
mented with artificial light is great. Arrange to have more light available than
you think you need. Clamp lights, floor lamps, and shop lights work well. The
Italian word for studio is laboratorio, and you need your space lit up like a
medical lab in order to work safely and effectively.
Taking care of your safety needs
One important thing that you need to consider is the safety of your work
area. Ventilation is your first concern. Changing the air in your place keeps
you and anyone else on the premises comfortable and healthy. Operable win-
dows, doors, fans, or exhaust hoods can provide fresh air and allow you to
circulate airflow through your space. Be aware and sensitive to the fact that
oil paint can be an irritant to some in your household.
Look over your space for fire hazards. Eliminate overloaded electrical outlets
or wires on the floor (which can also trip you and visitors). Maintain a fire
extinguisher in your work space as well.

Another safety concern is how to put your supplies and equipment away
when not in use. Keep lids on jars of solvent and place them out of reach of
children. Put paints away, clean your brushes, and place any paintings out of
reach as well. Your children and pets can be very curious about your hobby
when you aren’t around! The paint stays wet for a long time. Small children
put everything in their mouths, and you may have pets who like to “help.”
Concentrate on tidy working methods and habits to keep everyone happy
and safe.
The following are some tips on tidy and safe work habits:
 Cover surfaces that are difficult to clean with dropcloths.
 Keep paint off your skin and clothes.
 Keep a rag to wipe up excess paint to avoid generating paper towel
waste.
 Clean your brushes in solvent, wiping off excess solvent before you
wash them with soap and water.
 Cover your palette with foil.
 Prepare a secure place to put wet paintings where they won’t tip over 
or fall.
 Keep clutter off your work surface to avoid accidents.
 Make sure that jars for solvent are heavy to prevent tipping over.
 Keep paper towels handy for emergency cleanups.
 Keep lids on solvent jars and paint tubes when not in use.
Other considerations for your workspace
Even if you have a dedicated space in which to work, it may seem uninviting,
or the hurdles may seem like too much to overcome. You don’t have to invest
in a remodeling project to make do with a space. If lighting is a problem and
the walls are dark, paint the walls white. White reflects the most light and
makes your space open up. Another issue with lighting is the type of light.
Regular incandescent lights are yellowish and can affect the color in your
work. Try GE Reveal bulbs that cast a cooler light than the regular kind.
Fluorescent lighting is good, especially if you have a full spectrum lamp in
your fixture.
Other items to include in your space are a bulletin board to pin up pictures
and art postcards, reference books and other art books and magazines, and a
trashcan. If you start to sell your artwork, you may need a desk and office
supplies to keep records. Having an extra chair for visitors is polite. Photos
of scenes you want to paint, and objects with vivid colors and interesting
shapes can also find a place in your studio area and serve as inspiration for
your work.
47
Chapter 4: Preparing to Paint

If your space is transient, you can make portable setups for your still lifes by
arranging the items in a cardboard box. Cut away the top and one or two
sides (see Figure 4-4 for an example). Fix your items down with tape rolls so
that you’re able to move the box to a shelf when you aren’t using it.
Developing Strategies for 
Growing as a Painter
Occasionally, by the time an individual actually starts to paint, he or she
expects success in five easy steps. Some painting programs on TV instill
unrealistic expectations. Sparkling mountaintops and trees appear in 30 
minutes! Remember that those folks have many years of experience, and
their results often depend on specialized techniques. In this book, we 
intend to teach you to paint from the basics forward so that you’ll be able 
to paint anything you set your mind to. The following advice should help:
 Keep it simple. Your study of painting should progress from simple to
more complex, allowing you to build on your experience. Think of your
artistic goal and then break it down to the simple, basic parts.
 Give yourself permission to make mistakes. Making art is putting your
artistic heart on your sleeve, and it hurts when it doesn’t come out per-
fect. That’s why we call the initial projects in this book “studies” rather
than “paintings.” Of course, they are paintings, but if you refer to them 
as studies, it doesn’t seem as risky or as distressing when they don’t turn
out as well as you’d like. Always remember when you’re beginning to paint
that you’re a rookie. As such, you have permission to make mistakes!

 Forget the great American masterpiece. You have some fine paintings
ahead of you, but learning to paint is about the process, not the product.
So the learning is a far better indicator of your success than a single fine
accomplishment. Besides, learning to paint is fun and the learning curve
is straight up. Every piece you do will show improvement. You may create
some awkward looking paintings, but everything falls into place with
practice.
 Make a commitment. Making a plan for your work and sticking to it are
important. This requires a commitment of time, especially in the begin-
ning, so we suggest setting aside time to work each week. Two to three
hours is ideal. Schedule it out and write it down in your daily planner 
or on your calendar. That serves as a promise to yourself to fulfill your
commitment. Two hours at a time is minimum to allow for getting out the
supplies, setting up your still life or other image sources, and sitting down
to work. You also need at least 10 to 15 minutes for cleanup. In the long
term, make a commitment of 6 to 12 months to be happy with your work.
Deciding What to Paint
So where to you start? How do you decide on an image? The first few works
you make should help you become familiar with the paint, the process of
applying it with the brushes, and the rudiments of making a simple image
without tripping you up with techniques.
Start easy
Easy-to-see shapes, without details or texture, are best. These shapes also
help you concentrate on the mechanics of painting. Some of the subjects we
start you with in the very beginning are white objects. You use only black and
white to paint them, giving you a comfortable start. Some ordinary subjects
are eggs, white boxes, and white ceramic coffee cups. Then you move on to
objects with color. Again, choose non-shiny geometric forms with little detail
first, and then move along in complexity.
Paint simple subjects from 
around the house
You can find many sources for subject matter for your work. Your painting
can communicate a particular idea through the objects represented. A collec-
tion of things from a vacation, the garden, or desk items can tell the viewer
something about the personality of the individual painter.
Take your viewfinder around the house and outside to find an interesting
composition of shapes. Look for scenes from your home, a view out a window,
or a sleeping dog. Snapshots from a trip or the old family homestead make nice
mementos as well.
49
Chapter 4: Preparing to Paint

Try simple landscapes
Landscapes are very popular, and you can start a project the same way. Start
with something simple, like one or two trees, and continue from there. Add
texture to your landscape after you experiment with making a variety of
greens for the foliage and blues for the sky. In general, forms that have one
color throughout, such as a tree with relatively uniform green leaves, are
best. Save that Maples in Autumn painting until you have summer down pat.
See Chapter 10 for more on this topic.
Copy a master
Another strategy is to copy a master painting. This technique for learning has
hundreds of years of tradition in painting. Artists such as Durer, Raphael, and
Van Gogh used this method in their work to study technique and composition.
Attempt a self-portrait
In addition to water, another troublesome subject is people. People aren’t so
difficult to paint, but it’s distressing when the painting doesn’t come out per-
fectly. You don’t have to be an art critic to spot a less-than-perfect portrait.
Any slight variation from a true likeness stands out. If you mess up a painting
of an apple and it looks like a peach, you can just call it a peach. Mess up a
painting of your mom, and you can’t bear to look at it. Approach portraits the
same way: Start simple with a self-portrait and continue from there. Another
thing to remember is that people are easier to paint the older they are.
(Babies are almost impossible!) In Chapter 11, we walk you through this 
topic step by step.

Chapter 5
Walking Through the 
Painting Process
In This Chapter
 Going step by step through the painting process
 Preparing your image
 Underpainting and painting in layers
 Evaluating and caring for your work
A
painting on display in a museum can be so compelling that it looks like
it was created by magic. All the parts of the image work so well together
that you just can’t stop looking at it.
Oil paintings are created in layers, and if you understand this process, you
can make it work to your advantage. The logic isn’t all that different from
painting any surface. It involves the proper preparation of the surface and
applying the paint in one or more coats. An oil painting just has a few more
steps. You must also create the image and make it presentable for viewing.
This chapter walks you through every step of the process of creating a paint-
ing. We provide an overview of all the steps — from setting goals for your
work to framing the finished painting. We also address some questions that
you may not have considered yet. How do you solve problems? What about
titles? What do you need to know to take care of the painting? We cover these
topics while we take you from the first marks on the canvas to the signature
at the bottom.
Preparation
How many times have you heard someone say that good preparation is
essential to the success of a project? It’s true in painting as well. In painting,
preparation is more than just squirting some paint out on a palette and pick-
ing up a brush. Here are some things that you need to do before you even
think about putting paint on a canvas:
 Set a goal for the painting.
 Make preparatory drawings.

 Decide what surface you want to paint on.
 Assemble your materials.
By spending a little time on each of those steps, you lay a good foundation
for your painting, and the process is a lot more productive and enjoyable.
Setting goals for your work
To prepare for any journey, you must know where you are and what your des-
tination is before mapping out a route. Painting is a similar journey. You pre-
pare by taking stock of your skills and abilities and deciding on your goals. It
also helps you decide what you’re going to paint, how big it will be, what it
will look like, and your strategy for executing it.
Assess where you are
Look at the art that you’ve created and try to assess where you are with your
artistic skills. Don’t be hard on yourself! Be objective, but don’t be overly crit-
ical. At this point, you’re either starting a completely new endeavor or build-
ing on the knowledge you have from previous paintings. Either way, it helps
to have a clear idea of where you are and set reasonable goals for your work.
You may judge your work harshly because you don’t have anything to com-
pare your work to — other than some master reproductions in books and
magazines. That’s pretty stiff competition, wouldn’t you say? Instead, keep it
simple and break it down to just a few questions you can ask yourself:
 How’s your drawing? Are the forms in your drawing believable? Your
drawing doesn’t have any problem that being more observant won’t
solve. Most of the time, the problem is simply that the forms are too gen-
eralized. In other words, the shapes you’ve drawn are only generally like
the actual form of the object. If you look closer at them, you can draw
the shapes more true to their actual forms. This is true of painting the
forms as well.
 Are you painting your forms flat like cartoons, or can you make them
look three-dimensional? Being able to make them look three-dimensional
is an indication that you can work with different values of paint.
 If you’ve been painting a while, do you rely on stylized techniques to
paint the forms in your artwork? For example, are you flipping the
brush a certain way or picking up colors on your brush in a prescribed
manner? You should be working naturally and concentrating on develop-
ing patterns, textures, and colors, not focusing on narrowly defined
ways of using your brush or applying color.
 Do the colors look fresh and clear? Have you ventured beyond painting
colors straight out of the tube? If your painting looks too vivid, you may
need to be a little more adventurous with your color mixing.

Part I: Getting Your Feet Wet in Oil Paint 

As you read over these questions, what do you think about your work? Maybe
you do well in some areas but not in others. None of these areas is worth
beating yourself up over. These questions merely help you establish a base-
line for developing your goals and show you how you can break down your
goals into specific areas to work on.
As with any set of goals, you want a specific main goal for your overall paint-
ing endeavor that can be broken down into sets of smaller goals. You can
choose to emphasize any of these goals in each painting.
Early goals to improve your skills
Set a goal for your work as you begin each painting so that you can plan the
steps you need to take for success. Is your goal to experiment with strong
color? Tackle a complex subject? Work on a large canvas? Deciding on just
one main goal for each painting helps you stay focused. Be tolerant of 
yourself on other issues aside from this main goal until you have more 
experience.
Beginning goals for your painting don’t have to be lofty. Here are some
sample goals for a painting that you can set for yourself:
 I will draw from observation so that I can become more confident in my
drawing skills.
 I will make the forms in my drawing more believable.
 I will paint my forms more accurately.
 I will make my forms less stiff.
 I will use color more effectively.
These are beginning-level goals. You’re either just starting to draw or paint,
or you’re picking it back up again after a long hiatus. You have some great
work ahead of you, but setting your goals is important so that you can
improve your skills step by step.
As your skills develop and your work improves, concentrate on these three
things:
 Work from life. That means looking at something and painting a picture
of it. Don’t work from photos or other images. Just concentrate on work-
ing from the thing that’s sitting right in front of you.
 Concentrate on working general to specific. This is our (and every
other art instructor’s) mantra. It means that you generally sketch an
image and then go back to refine it. We speak of this in many places in
the book. Refer to Chapters 7, 13, and 14 for more info.
 Be patient. The process is a lot of fun, but you’re going to be a bit
clumsy for a while. Concentrate on getting the basics down solidly
before you try to dive into painting complex subjects.
53
Chapter 5: Walking Through the Painting Process

Intermediate goals when you have skills to build on
When you’ve taken a class or been working for a while, you have some skills
to build on. You can begin to set some intermediate goals. At this point, you’re
ready to explore new ways to paint or set some personal goals for your work
to take it to the next level. Here are some questions you may ask yourself to
determine whether you’re ready for intermediate goals:
 Am I confident in my paint-application skills?
 Am I able to tackle a number of different subjects?
 Do I feel confident working with color?
 Have I met a previous goal, and am I looking for new challenges?
 Would I like to work with more expression in my painting?
 Do I have an interest in exhibiting my work, selling my paintings, or
enrolling in an art program?
Advanced goals that challenge
If you decide that you’re ready to give yourself more of a challenge, here are
some things that you can do to advance to the next level:
 Start to experiment with different materials. Trying different types of
media, supports, or brush and knife techniques keeps the learning
process fun.
 Start to explore new subject matter. Think of the things that you
haven’t had a chance to work on yet, and set new goals.
 Familiarize yourself with the art organizations and institutions in 
your area. You can find like-minded individuals, a painting group, or an
exhibit that will give you more ways to enjoy your hobby. Art can be a
solitary pursuit, but finding others who share your interests is always
enjoyable.
 Work from life, but go to the museum, too. Another way to help you 
set a goal is to take some time to look at art. Your local library and the
Internet have lots of resources, but nothing compares to seeing the 
real thing. When you look at real paintings, you can see how paintings
are made.
When you go to a museum, take your sketchbook to make drawings or notes.
Pencils are the only drawing or writing instrument allowed in museums.
Absolutely no ink pens! Also, be careful to keep your distance as you look at
the paintings. Of course, never touch a painting. Artists often become overly
enthusiastic and lean in too close to the works. At minimum, you make the
security guards nervous, and you may set off a few alarms! (We’ve been guilty
of that a few times, but we haven’t been thrown out yet!)
Also, familiarize yourself with art centers and galleries in your area. Attend
their exhibitions and artist lectures. Another resource that may be available
to you is the art department of your local college, which may have exhibi-
tions and visiting artist lectures free to the general public. You can find 
54
Part I: Getting Your Feet Wet in Oil Paint 

informal resources by checking bulletin boards at an art supply store and
talking to local artists at art fairs. Don’t be afraid to consult high school art
teachers and instructors at museums or art centers. (Expect that some
people will be more generous with their time and knowledge than others.)
Teachers of any sort are usually interested in passing on any information
they have, but if you’re inclined to take a lot of their time, ask whether you
can hire them for a consultation or periodic private lessons or critiques.
Making preparatory drawings
Another key way to prepare to paint is to make drawings. Working out your
compositional problems on a small scale is easier than working them out on
your canvas, or worse, finding yourself disappointed in your final results.
You don’t have to excel in drawing. As a matter of fact, the best drawings to
use for painting are quick thumbnail sketches that are quite rough. They
don’t have to be refined at all. You can develop your drawing skills as you
paint. Just be aware that your skills are developing in this area and your work
may not be as sophisticated as you’d like.
Here are some basic methods to use (for an in-depth discussion, consult
Chapter 13):
 If you’re drawing from observation, use the viewfinder from the Cheat
Sheet in the front of this book. It helps you set your format to vertical or
horizontal and to see simple shapes in your subject matter. Make sure
that the picture frame of your drawing is the same proportion as your
viewfinder. Draw what you see in the viewfinder.
 When you make rough thumbnail sketches, you can use any type of
paper, pencil, or pen you like. You may want to get a small sketchbook to
keep your drawings and ideas for painting.
 You can also practice with photos. Make a tracing or grid enlargement of
the large shapes you see (ignoring the details) onto your painting sur-
face. Don’t assume that you have to paint everything in the photo. Crop
or mask out the area you want to use and eliminate anything in the
image area that isn’t contributing to the success of the work. Make sure
that the shape of your photo and the shape of your painting (their pic-
ture frames) are proportionate with each other.
Deciding what surface to paint on
Each project has a different goal, and it determines the shape, form, and size
of your support. Some of the options include canvas panels, canvas paper,
canvas pads, prepared paper or cardboard, stretched canvas, and prepared
Masonite. (See Chapter 3 for an in-depth discussion of painting supports.)
Throughout this book, we suggest a canvas or board for each painting, but
the following sections tell you how you can make decisions yourself.
55
Chapter 5: Walking Through the Painting Process

Informal practice projects or studies
Initial paintings, such as the black and white study in Chapter 6, the color
studies in Chapter 7, and practice projects are best done on inexpensive sup-
ports. Use canvas paper, paper or cardboard primed with gesso, or a canvas
panel. Inexpensive supports are great when you just feel like messing around
with the paint. They’re inexpensive and if you don’t like the results, you
haven’t risked much.
The only caveat to this guideline is experimenting with impasto painting (see
Chapter 8). This heavy, gooey paint application needs a rigid support. Be
sure to use a canvas panel or prepared Masonite for impasto painting.
Formal projects
At some point, you move from initial paintings to serious efforts — paintings
that you want to keep for a long time, frame, or give as gifts. In other words,
real paintings. These projects should be painted on stretched canvas or pre-
pared Masonite. The sturdiness of the support makes framing, hanging, and
storing your painting easier. A canvas panel may work nicely for this kind of
project, but the cardboard base for the panel can be permanently ruined if
the panel gets damp or if it’s dropped on its corner.
If you happen to make a nice painting on paper or another less-rigid support,
don’t despair. Just frame it and hang it up. A frame provides the best protec-
tion for your work. See the section titled “Frame the painting” later in this
chapter for instructions on framing.
Assembling your materials
Consult Chapter 3 to determine what you need. Think through what materi-
als and equipment you need and carefully organize your space. Being orga-
nized helps you avoid disruptions in your painting while you pick up missing
supplies.
First, locate all your supplies and lay them out within easy reach. Painting
can be a messy business, and you don’t want to tip things over as you reach
for something. Be sure that you have good lighting and a close, unobstructed
view of your subject. Sitting or standing, you must be able to look at your
canvas and your setup by just shifting your eyes from one to the other.
Starting to Paint
Before you put any marks on your canvas, be sure to adjust the position of
the canvas. Whether it’s on an easel or leaning against a toolbox, the painting
surface must be parallel to your face. Think of it like a TV screen or a com-
puter monitor. This step is crucial to avoid any distortion in your image. 
Now you’re ready to start.
56
Part I: Getting Your Feet Wet in Oil Paint 

You can use one of two basic approaches to beginning your work on the
canvas. In the first approach, you begin drawing directly on the canvas with
your brush and paint. Another method is to draw with charcoal on the
canvas and then begin to paint. After the drawing, you proceed to under-
painting. The following sections tell you more.
Laying out the drawing
Drawing with paint directly on the canvas maintains a fresh look on the
canvas and requires no additional steps or materials. When you begin a
painting by drawing with paint, you aren’t tempted to spend too much time
erasing, redrawing, and over-refining the image. In the initial projects in this
book, we emphasize this method of painting.
The first marks on the canvas are done with a very thin wash of paint and sol-
vent in a light color. Paint thinned with solvent dries quickly and allows for
changes. After you draw the initial image on the canvas, stop and take stock
of the image (this step takes only two to five minutes to get all the parts in).
You can make changes to the drawing by switching to a slightly darker or
more intense color. If you see any mistakes, just apply a new drawing over
the top of the first lines. You can see an example of this in Figure 5-1. You can
also wipe over the marks with a paper towel.
Never try to wash marks or paint off your canvas with solvent or anything
else. It will damage the canvas and just spread the problem all over you and
your work surface. If you have to remove heavy paint, scrape off anything
you can with a palette knife. Then wipe away excess paint with a paper towel.
Set the canvas aside to dry and then restart the project.
Figure 5-1:

57
Chapter 5: Walking Through the Painting Process

Another approach is drawing on the canvas with a charcoal pencil and then
finalizing it with thinned paint. This method is often reserved for painting
projects that are planned out. The downside of this process is that the char-
coal can mix into the paint and dull the colors. The advantage is that your
drawing can be more precise and you can make corrections without remov-
ing paint from the canvas.
Don’t use graphite as a drawing material for your painting unless you intend
for the look of a graphite pencil to be a part of the work. Like charcoal,
graphite can mix with your paint and dull the colors, but that isn’t the pri-
mary reason you should avoid using it. Graphite bleeds through your paint
like a felt-tip marker on a pristine wall. Like markers, graphite is especially
persistent and can reappear years after it has been covered.
Underpainting
Next comes the underpainting. This is literally the first coat of color for the
painting. Basic colors, without fussy details, are applied in large areas in a
thin wash. Just like the drawing, this step allows you to experiment with the
layout of your painting and still be able to make changes. Again, stand back
from the painting and assess your progress. We show you an example of this
stage of a painting in Figure 5-2. We blocked in the colors for the lighthouse,
trees, water, and sky in a general manner to achieve the underpainting.
Underpainting also allows you to establish the basic colors of the forms.
They can match the final layer of paint exactly or they can be contrasting,
with small points of contrasting paint peeking through the later layers.

58
Part I: Getting Your Feet Wet in Oil Paint 

At key stages of a painting, take stock of your work. Stop and back up from
your painting to assess your progress. Don’t be overly critical. Your drawing
should look something like a thumbnail sketch done in color. The underpaint-
ing looks like a very simplified version of your goal. We give you more ways
to assess and evaluate your painting at the end of this chapter.
When you finish the areas of flat color, back up at least 6 feet from the
canvas. Use your imagination to envision how the painting will look when you
add the lights and darks. Now is the time to critically assess your work.
Check for lines that should be level, relative sizes of items, and the placement
of forms. You can use your viewfinder to look at both the painting and the
image that you have to help you focus. You can use your paintbrush handle
to check the baselines of objects and the axis of an object. See the black and
white study painting in Chapter 6 for illustrations of how to use these tools.
If you aren’t happy with the underpainting, changing it is easy. But remember
never to try to wash paint off your canvas with any liquid or solvent. If you
have a huge thick mistake, scrape if off with your palette knife and then let
the scraped surface dry before painting over it.
Make any changes you need to at this stage. You should have only about 
20 minutes of painting time invested in this, so don’t be afraid of changing
your forms.
Laying on the Paint
When you have the basic forms blocked in, you can begin to apply another
layer of paint to develop the image. You’re working in a manner that’s
referred to as general to specific. That just means that you’re putting down
general shapes and colors and then gradually refining what you’ve made. At
each stage of the painting, you begin adjusting and refining the main subject
first, and then you move on to less-prominent parts of your composition.
Enhancements to the painting begin with the focal point of the painting. So
whether your focal point is the big red apple in a still life or a line of trees in a
landscape, you concentrate on that focal point. Then you make adjustments
to the parts of the painting that hold a secondary role, and so on. Usually
foreground is the most important, and the middle and background are
adjusted to harmonize with the main focal point.
Bringing it all up in layers
The paint application gradually becomes heavier and more varied, and 
your working method becomes slower as you refine the image. You have a
chance to add a variety of color, brushstrokes, and detail to the image. In 
our lighthouse painting in Figure 5-3, you can see how we’re developing 
the image with a variety of colors and brushstrokes to depict the detail of 
the scene.
59
Chapter 5: Walking Through the Painting Process

You can leave some areas with broad strokes or thin layers while others take
on a rich, dense, and complex appearance. See the background of the paint-
ing in Chapter 1 for an example of this. The variety adds to the complexity of
even the simplest subject.
Deciding when it’s finished
Whether you’re making a rough sketch or a highly refined and formal paint-
ing, your work isn’t complete until all parts of the painting are fully resolved
and together they create a harmonious whole. That can be difficult to deter-
mine! Much of what the art community admires about late 19th and early
20th century painting appears to be rough and spontaneous. At the time,
some of the paintings weren’t considered to be complete enough to be pub-
licly shown.
You can find a lot to appreciate in a well-done study. The quickness and fresh-
ness of the mark of the brush and the directness of the color can hold drama
that’s lacking in an overly refined painting. But you must also consider that
the study itself can be the base of a more-complete painting. Van Gogh some-
times completed a painting in less than an hour, but Leonardo da Vinci would
sometimes spend years on a painting. In the end, it’s up to you to decide
what works best for you.

Part I: Getting Your Feet Wet in Oil Paint 

Evaluating Your Work
After the painting is done, or even while you’re still working on it, assess the
work. Of course you’re assessing on a continual basis while you’re working.
You make corrections and try variations of each stroke. You stand back to
assess a color or the placement of a form. But you can use a method to evalu-
ate your work to help you progress to your goal and achieve even more.
Stand back and take a gander
We mention this tip several times, but it’s a great device. It’s easy to use while
you’re working and helps you get perspective on your work. You’ve probably
had the experience of going to a museum and finding yourself walking back-
ward away from a painting or walking right up to a painting for a closer look.
Every artwork has a viewing distance and it exerts a force on you to move to
that position. Find the viewing distance of your painting and then walk back
from it until the details start to blur together, usually 6 to 10 feet for the pro-
jects in this book. The distance is greater for larger paintings.
When you stand back the proper distance, examine each area of the painting
with your viewfinder and ask yourself whether you made a decision about what
you see. Did you just fill in an area of the background? Be sure that you have
something going on, something for the viewer to see, in all parts of the painting.
Turn the painting upside down
Viewing a painting upside down is a good way to check your total composi-
tion. Flip your work upside down or sideways and look at it from a distance.
This trick helps you focus on the shapes in the painting and less on the sub-
ject. Assess the overall composition for balance and check for dead areas in
your painting.
Try the mirror trick
This method is like the upside-down trick, only it helps you spot almost all
problems, big or small. Either use a hand mirror and look at the painting over
your shoulder or hold the painting up in front of you while looking in a
mirror. Wobbly ellipses, leaning doors, and uphill horizon lines all jump out at
you. When you get that quiet sense of unease about your work or just can’t
seem to solve a problem, try this strategy.
Ask for someone else’s opinion
Asking for another opinion is a delicate choice because you’re exposing your-
self to the judgment of another. We give you a few reasons for doing this:
61
Chapter 5: Walking Through the Painting Process

 They have a better perspective because they haven’t been working on
the painting for hours. And they see things fresh that you don’t see.
 They can spot something incongruous. Be prepared to hear something
like, “Wow, that orange really stands out!” when you didn’t notice that
you had created something day-glo in your painting.
 Art is about communication. Just like writing or playing music, you 
want your work to be enjoyed and appreciated by others. So it helps 
you in the long run to have someone help you check your work, just 
like you have someone proof your writing or check your sound in a 
large hall.
Get a critique
Critique (pronounced: Crit-eek!). Definition: A review of a creative work with
comments on its qualities. Because of the similarity to the word criticism,
many people think that a critique focuses only on negative qualities. But the
word actually is open and not specific in the type of comments it may con-
tain. It can be written, like a movie review, or in person, as is done in most art
classes.
A critique is when an individual (or a group of people) talks about your work
and assesses all parts of your painting. In the best possible situations, the
person acts as a stand-in for the public, your audience. He or she tells you
when you have a problem with your drawing and when your colors sing. A
critique can be painful, but it helps you grow as an artist and get to know
your work and yourself.
When you’re in an English class and you get a term paper back with red
marks all over it, you don’t take it personally. You see each of the typos and
grammatical mistakes and you make corrections. That paper isn’t you — it’s
a paper. Same goes with your artwork. When something doesn’t work in a
painting, it doesn’t have anything to do with you. If you don’t agree with the
assessment, ask someone else’s opinion and then listen.
Cleaning and Storing Your Tools
Here’s how to clean your brushes every time you use them:
1. Wipe off any paint solids from your brushes onto a paper towel.
2. Swish the brushes in the solvent jar and knock off the excess solvent
on the outside edge of the jar.
You’ll see the solvent running down the inside of the jar; it should look
transparent. Never leave your brushes standing in a jar of solvent. It
warps the bristles and ruins the shape of the brush.
62
Part I: Getting Your Feet Wet in Oil Paint 

3. Put a small amount of liquid soap in your hand and swish the brushes
in soap, shampooing and rinsing until the suds are white.
4. Rinse the brushes thoroughly, wipe them dry, and allow them to air
dry completely until you use them again. 
Remember to wipe up any paint with a paper towel before it has a
chance to dry.
5. Store the brushes so that the bristles are protected from being bent.
Either roll them in a canvas sleeve or towel to keep the bristles in good
shape.
Never put any solvent on your skin or clothing. If you get a little paint on your
clothing, don’t worry. Just apply a little dishwashing liquid with water and it
washes right out. Then launder as usual. If you get any paint on your skin, wipe
off the big gobs with paper towel and then simply wash with soap and water.
When you’re ready to store your palette and brushes, you have a couple of
options. If you know that you’ll paint again within the next two days, you can
keep your paint on the palette. If you have a glass palette, cover it with heavy
aluminum foil. The paint will stay liquid for a day or two and you’ll save your
paint. If you’re using a disposable palette, tear off the top sheet, turn it over,
and put it down on the next sheet. You can store it as is.
If you aren’t going to paint again for a few days, you can dispose of your paint
this way:
 For disposable palette pages, allow the paint to air dry and simply tear
out the page and throw it away.
 For glass palettes, allow the paint to dry for one day and then scrape it
off using a razor tool (the same type of tool you’d use to clean paint off a
window pane). If you need to clean your palette before the paint dries,
use the razor tool to scrape the paint off and wipe it onto a paper towel.
Never use solvent or water on your palette; it only spreads the mess
everywhere. And never put any solvent or paint in a sink drain — it’s
very bad for the environment and your pipes!
Wrapping It All Up
When your painting is complete, you want to make it presentable to others.
Framing the painting, signing it, and giving it a title help you to show the work
to its best advantage and make it identifiable to the public. These steps aren’t
absolutely necessary, but they allow you to share your work with others.
Come up with a title
The title may be descriptive, like Sunny Day in Michigan or The Ceramic Jug
with Pears. It may give the viewer the idea behind the painting, like Memories
63
Chapter 5: Walking Through the Painting Process

of Summer or Lost in Thought. Many artists don’t title their work. You see
many untitled works or paintings with numbers, such as Composition #46, in
museums. We suggest that you either title the work or mark it with the date
to help you keep track of it, but it’s completely up to you. Just remember that
if all your pieces have the same title or no title, you won’t be able to keep
them straight.
Sign the painting
Look at the work of some famous artists. Albrecht Durer created a symbol
with the initials A and D locked together. Some artists sign only their first
name, and some don’t sign the work at all. Each piece should be identified
somehow, even if the work is signed somewhere that isn’t readily visible.
Points to remember:
 Practice on bare pieces of canvas. You can use a very small brush, or if
you paint with thick paint, you can scratch your signature in the wet
paint with the tip of your palette knife.
 The signature shouldn’t dominate the overall effect. Use a color that
almost matches the part of the canvas that the signature will be painted
on — just one shade darker or lighter or a slightly different version of
the same color.
 The signature shouldn’t be too big. The viewer must see your painting
first, not the signature. The effect to aim for is “Oh, what a lovely paint-
ing! Who made it? Oh, here’s the signature, I found it . . . ”
 Don’t use pencil or ink to sign the work. It should be the same oil paint
that you use for the work.
Frame the painting
If the painting is on a stretched canvas, it’s possible to just hang the painting
from the wooden stretcher bars on the back, but this isn’t a good idea. It 
isn’t stable, and it puts undue stress on the stretcher (especially bad for large
paintings). And it looks cheap. A solid frame protects the canvas and rein-
forces the structure of the canvas. If the painting falls, the frame takes the
impact.
The frame should make the painting look good and not compete with the art-
work. Remember that it will be seen as a part of the completed artwork, just
like every other element in your painting. Be careful of bright colors, ornate
molding, and overly large profiles.
Take a look at your favorite paintings in museums. Do you notice the frame
first or the painting? The artwork should always come first. That said, you
64
Part I: Getting Your Feet Wet in Oil Paint 

don’t have to spend a fortune on good frames. You have many options open
to you:
 Buy a pre-made frame at discount shop or secondhand store. This
option is the least expensive. Some artists buy secondhand frames 
and then paint over any scuffs or odd colors to harmonize with their
own work. Make sure that the frame is strong and stable. It shouldn’t
wobble — it should be made of strong wood or metal.
 Look for frame-it-yourself places. Some frame shops sell you the materi-
als and teach you how to build a frame for your painting and save
money on the labor. They can help you decide on the profile of the wood
frame and the color to go with your work. These places also frame it for
you for a low price.
 Art supply stores and online retailers will sell you pre-made frames or
frame kits, some that you can buy at a volume discount if you know that
you need a lot.
 At the higher end, you can find galleries that provide framing service
and take care of everything for you.
After the painting is framed, you can attach a fastener (either a wire or a clip
designed to hang paintings) to the frame to hang it. If you use a wire, it
should be attached solidly to the frame with an eye screw or something simi-
lar. Secure the eye screw a third of the way down each side of the frame and
attach the wire to hang the painting at a good angle.
Don’t put glass over a painting. It interferes with the curing, or drying, of the
painting. The only exception is if the painting is old and you intend to hang it
in a smoky bar or a busy kitchen. The glass prevents tobacco and food from
sticking to the painting. If you must use glass, be sure to use a spacer under
the glass to prevent it from resting directly on the canvas.
Take care of your paintings
You put your heart and soul in your work, so of course you want your paint-
ings to last. Here’s some advice to help make that happen:
 Don’t varnish your canvas for at least a year or two — oil paintings
aren’t completely cured for months. Varnishing the painting too early
seals in the curing action and creates some unsightly effects on the
painting surface.
 Don’t hang the painting in direct sunlight. Your colors are lightfast, but
the sun will bake them and damage the painting over time.
 Don’t hang the painting near an air vent. Heat or cold blowing on the
painting leads to cracks.
 Hang the painting in a sturdy, solid manner to prevent the work from
falling down.
65
Chapter 5: Walking Through the Painting Process

Keep records of the work you make — even if you think of yourself as a
Sunday painter. At least take a snapshot of your work before you give it away
or sell it. Artists call this documenting their work. Don’t assume that you’ll
never need it. Something may come up where you need to show a portfolio of
work and you’ll be sorry that you didn’t keep a record.

and you’re ready to begin this exciting journey.
In this part you really get down to painting. We show you
how to set up a subject to work from, how to lay it out on
your canvas, how to apply paint, and all the stages of the
painting process.
If you’re a beginner, this part has easy, step-by-step

T
he best way to start learning how to paint is to make a simple oil study in
black and white. This study gives you the chance to use your paints and
equipment, and you can try out your work area to determine whether it’s
comfortable and whether it will work for you. A study is less formal than an
oil painting, and it’s intended to be completed in one sitting. If it doesn’t turn
out well, you’ve invested only a small amount of time in the project, and
you’ve learned a few things about drawing on the canvas and blocking in the
main darks and lights.
In this chapter we discuss, step by step, all the items that go into this study.
When you’ve worked with black and white to your heart’s content, move
directly on to the next chapter — painting with color!
Starting Simple: A Black 
and White Painting
An oil study is just a quick painting, similar to a sketch. Making a study
allows you to practice a bit and take the pressure off the idea of making an
Oil Painting. By doing a study, you give yourself permission to make all those
mistakes that you need to make while you’re learning to paint.
Before you get started, make sure you have the following supplies:
 14-x-18-inch canvas
 Palette
 1⁄4-inch flat or bright bristle brush
 1⁄2-inch flat or bright bristle brush

 #1 round bristle brush
 Oil colors in white and black
 Viewing square
 Palette knife
 Turpenoid or Gamsol in a small jar
Setting up your still life
Start by scouting around the house to find some simple objects to paint from.
Anything white will do: Eggs, paper towel or toilet paper rolls, Styrofoam
cups, plastic bottles, and small boxes covered with white paper make good
subjects. Collect five to ten objects so that you can experiment with different
arrangements. Don’t select objects that have a lot of print on them; plain
objects are best.
Although white objects may not be glamorous, painting them simplifies your
task while you’re learning how to work with the paint. You have to think only
about their forms and light and shadow; working with color brings a lot of
other stuff to the table.
For the study that we use to illustrate the process in this chapter, we chose a
box, an egg, and a coffee cup — nothing elaborate.
Here are a few rules to follow when arranging a still life:
 Use an odd number of objects: Three objects in a setting make a fairly
balanced composition, as you can see in Figure 6-1.
 Vary the size of the objects: Objects that are small, medium, and large
work nicely, although you can merely use one or two of the same type of
item if you like (check out the different sizes in Figure 6-1).
For this still life, make an arrangement of the objects on a white cloth, and
put a strong light on it so that the objects cast long shadows. A clamp light or
lamp with an adjustable shade is perfect for this study. Group the objects
together so that you can see each object, but don’t group them so tightly
together that you don’t have any space between them. Try to arrange them
to get interesting shadows as well.
A still life has a foreground and a background, and both are important. Many
beginners concentrate so much on the objects that they’re painting that they
forget to think about their backgrounds. Arrange your objects so that the
areas around them (the negative space) make interesting shapes as well.
You must be able to see the objects and paint without moving around too
much, so position yourself and your canvas so that you’re comfortable. You
should be able to see the objects, your canvas, and the palette without shift-
ing your body in a major way. Be sure to place your palette, paint, solvent jar,
and brushes so that they’re within easy reach.
70
Part II: Break Out the Brushes and Start Painting! 

You should be relatively still while you paint, moving only your eyes from the
objects to your canvas. For more complete information on getting comfort-
able with your setup, see Chapter 4.
Using your viewfinder: Seeing things 
like a pro
Now that your work area is set up, you’re ready to select an area of your still
life to paint. A viewfinder is a handy tool that helps you compose strong pic-
tures. You can find one in the Cheat Sheet at the very front of this book.
A viewfinder acts like a window onto your still life setup. It crops away the
parts of your setup that you aren’t going to use, making it easier to see what
you’re going to paint. To use it, hold it with your spare hand (that hand you’re
not painting with) and find an interesting section of your setup. If your view-
finder has marks, use the marks to help you transfer what you see in the
viewfinder onto your canvas. The marks help you establish where the
halfway and quarter points are, both in the viewfinder and on the canvas.
Think of it like a grid of windowpanes.
Draw the shapes the same size and in the same position as you see them in
the viewfinder. If an object is in the middle of the window in the viewfinder,
put it in the middle of your canvas. You can also visually measure how tall
and wide the object should be by comparing it to the marks on the
viewfinder.
The height and width of the viewfinder window must be proportionate to the
height and width of your canvas. If the window is horizontal, the canvas must
be horizontal. If they aren’t proportionate, your viewfinder will be about as
much help as a carrot stick — and not as tasty!
Don’t change the distance of the viewfinder from your eyes while you’re
laying in the drawing (see the upcoming section “The initial sketch” for more
details on drawing); it will change the sizes of the objects in the window. If
you must put it down, compare the view inside the window with the marks on
the viewfinder and the objects in your drawing to help you reestablish the
position.
As you lay in your drawing, make sure that all your vertical lines are parallel
to the sides of your canvas, and that all your horizontal lines are parallel to
the top and bottom of your canvas. Lining it up makes your drawing look
much more solid, even if the shapes and proportions are off.
The initial sketch
Now that you’re ready to start laying in the drawing on your canvas, you’re
going to be adventurous and begin by drawing with your brush and paint
directly on the canvas.
71
Chapter 6: A Study in Black and White

You don’t want to draw with graphite pencil on your canvas. The graphite
will eventually bleed through the paint just like a marker bleeds through the
paint on a wall if you paint over it.
Follow these simple steps to complete your initial sketch:
1. Put a pool of white paint and a pool of black paint on your palette.
Each pool of paint should be about the size of a quarter.
2. Use your palette knife to take a small amount from each pool and
make a third pool of paint that’s medium gray.
Be sure to wipe off your palette knife to avoid transferring and adulterat-
ing your colors.
3. Dip your round brush into the solvent to dampen it, knock off the
excess solvent on the side of the jar, and then touch the brush to your
rag to take off the last drip.
4. Take a small amount of gray onto the brush.
Because the solvent is already on your brush, you end up with a wash of
gray that’s about the consistency of chocolate milk.
5. Sketch in the egg (or the object that’s closest to the bottom of the
scene) with this wash.
You can see in Figure 6-1 how the wash is used to draw in the shape of
the item. The placement of the egg toward the bottom of the scene tells
you that it’s closest to you. The egg appears roughly oval and horizontal,
which indicates that it’s lying on the table.
Make the egg and all other objects about life-size or larger. The hardest
thing to paint is a miniature!
6. Still using the wash of gray, sketch in the cup on the right, and then
sketch the box on the left.
Go back to your palette and pick up more wash whenever you need to.
When you run out of the mixed wash, you have to dip your brush into
the solvent and then the gray paint from time to time, mixing as you go
to maintain the consistency of the wash.
7. Use the wash to draw a line that indicates the back edge of the table.
This drawing stage — Steps 5 through 7 — should take only a minute 
or two.
8. Lean back in your seat and take a look through your viewfinder to
check the positions.
The points where the objects overlap one another tell you which objects
are in front and which are behind. Check to see that the intersecting
points are correct from your point of view. Look at the bottom of all the
objects in your setup; the point where they rest on the table is called the
baseline. Check to see whether your objects’ baselines match the
objects in the setup. Check to see whether the relative positions are cor-
rect now. It’s early in the painting, and you can make corrections easily.
72
Part II: Break Out the Brushes and Start Painting! 

9. Make corrections with a slightly darker shade of gray, drawing right
over the top of the first marks.
Mix up a new pool of gray that has a bit more black in it this time. Use
your solvent to make a wash as you did before. You can use the same
brush without cleaning it because the colors are so similar.
Draw right over the top of your previous drawing. Don’t try to wipe out
mistakes or use any solvent on the canvas to make corrections. As you
continue to develop your painting, the mistakes will disappear under the
additional layers of paint.
Sighting and measuring
It’s a good idea to check your drawing on your canvas by using a technique
called sighting and measuring. You don’t need any special equipment — you
can easily do this with just your paintbrush handle.
Sighting is a way of checking to see whether your objects are drawn correctly.
You use your paintbrush handle (or anything that’s straight and about 12
inches long) to visually compare the actual object to the painted object.
Follow these steps to give it a try:
1. Find an edge of a table or an edge of a box to practice on.
2. Hold out your paintbrush handle at arm’s length and visually lay it
along the edge of the item.
Figure 6-1:
The initial
sketch.
73
Chapter 6: A Study in Black and White

3. Close one eye to get rid of the double image.
4. After you’re sure that you have the correct angle, lock your wrist and
open your other eye. That’s the angle that you’re trying to draw on
your canvas.
Blocking in major shadows
Find the shadows in your setup, and lay the basic value pattern for your
painting. A value pattern is the basic arrangement of darks and lights in a
painting.
1. Look at the still life and note the direction of the light.
Because you have a bright light shining on one side of the object (if you
don’t, check out the “Setting up your still life” section earlier in the chap-
ter), each object should have a light side and a darker side. Notice how
only the change in lightness and darkness distinguishes one object from
another. The edges of many of the objects are defined by the difference
between how light or dark the object is and the lightness or darkness of
whatever is behind it.
Squint as you look at your setup to help you see the patterns of dark and
light more easily.
2. Pick up the 1⁄2-inch brush, dip it into the solvent, and knock off the
excess — but, this time, leave it fairly wet.
3. Pick up some of the gray wash you used for your initial sketch, and
paint in the dark side of the egg, the cup, and the box (in that order).
4. Locate the shadow inside the cup and lay in that shadow as well.
Notice how the shadow inside the cup is on just one side (the opposite
side of the shadow on the outside of the cup). This indicates that the
cup is empty.
5. Lay in the shadows cast by each object on the tabletop or any dark-
ness in the background.
In Figure 6-2, you can see the cast shadows of each item. The shadows
start at the bottom of each item and are roughly parallel. This indicates
the source of the light. The background of this scene was outside of the
reach of the light, so it’s darker than the shadows in the setup.
6. Back away from your canvas and take stock of your work.
This manner of creating a painting is called working general to specific. You
establish all the big shapes and patterns first. Don’t get bogged down in
painting details in the beginning stages of the painting. Or the middle stages.
Working general to specific means that you start with all the big shapes and
patterns of the composition, and with each layer of paint, the form of the
objects becomes more defined. You think about how the whole composition
is developing rather than concentrating on small areas.
74
Part II: Break Out the Brushes and Start Painting! 

Developing the image
The rhythm of the painting process is that you paint the main objects first,
and then the secondary areas (in this case, tabletop and shadows), and then
the background. Don’t try to blend colors; just apply the paint in a blocky
fashion until you fill the scene completely.
Now is the time to start using more brushes and different colors of gray. As
you develop the image, you apply the paint in a thicker manner than you do
in the initial sketch. The paint will be about as thick as a thin layer of butter
on bread.
1. Mix three versions of gray (light, medium, and dark), and use a differ-
ent brush for each.
Use the different brushes to avoid cleaning a single brush every time
you use it.
2. Locate the areas of your scene that have middle gray shadows, and
apply the medium gray to those areas first.
The side of the box or a cast shadow of the cup may be middle gray in
your particular setup. Block in all the areas that have similar values.
3. Find the areas of your still life that are the darkest, such as the area
behind the edge of the table, and fill them with the darkest gray.
Filling in the background value helps you define the edge of the objects
in the middle ground and the foreground. At this point, you don’t have
Figure 6-2:
Adding 
in the
shadows. 
75
Chapter 6: A Study in Black and White

to work all the way to the edge of the canvas — just block in the area
around the main objects for this step.
4. Now that you have the major values blocked in, continue to lay in
more paint to indicate all the values that you see.
Don’t blend the shades of gray just yet; leave them as they are.
Adjust the amount of gray for each area as you go. Use the lightest gray
to fill in those areas that are light and the medium and dark grays for the
darker areas. Don’t paint every last detail of any object — just block in
the values in a general manner. You can work on the entire painting as
you do, so that the image develops as a whole.
5. Continue to develop and refine the image, making adjustments to the
shape and values as you go.
Pick up more paint and apply a heavier layer of paint over the entire
scene, item by item. Continue to use one color of gray with each brush
to keep the values distinct and to keep things from getting confusing.
You’re learning the rhythm of painting general to specific. As you develop the
painting, you make changes to the main subject of the painting first. Then
you adjust and resolve the secondary items to match the main subject’s level
of completeness. Then you do the same for the background. You’ll find your-
self naturally switching brushes and colors as you paint. This process contin-
ues until the painting is complete. Figure 6-3 shows the completed painting.
Figure 6-3:
The black
and white
study is
complete.
76
Part II: Break Out the Brushes and Start Painting! 

Paint all the way to the edges and cover all parts of the canvas. Don’t leave
the white of the canvas showing, even in the area of your setup that’s all
white. If any part of the white primer is left uncovered, it will eventually
yellow and ruin the effect of your painting. Establish light, medium, and 
dark areas on all the objects, the tabletop, and the area behind the objects.
Find any cast shadows and be sure to include the background. Now that
you’ve established a pattern of lights and darks, stand back and note your
efforts.
Assessing Your Work and 
Making Corrections
After you’ve completed a still life study, it’s time to assess your work. As you
begin to paint, you may find that you’re unsatisfied with your work but you
can’t identify why. Something just seems to be wrong. Lots of artists go
through the same thing. Here we offer some points about how to look at your
work and check the drawing and composition for your painting:
 Look though the viewfinder to determine whether the shapes, sizes, and
positions of the objects look correct. Do they look like they were drawn
from the correct eye level? Often just looking through the viewfinder
makes the mistakes apparent.
 Use your paintbrush handle to sight the angles and sizes of the objects
as described in the “Sighting and measuring” section earlier in this chap-
ter. You can also use this sighting technique to find the central axis for
the geometric objects, and check to see whether the objects look plumb.
Use the paintbrush handle held horizontally to check the baselines for
each object and compare them to the baselines in your painting for the
relative positions of the objects. 
 Do the sizes of the objects have a proportional relationship to the size of
the format? Do they look like they’re lost in space, or are they too
cramped within the edges of the canvas?
Checking the painting:
 Did you create a wide range of value? Can you find dark grays, middle
grays, and light grays in your composition?
 Did you pay attention to the background and other parts of the painting,
aside from the objects?
 Have your objects been painted as a series of areas of different values?
They shouldn’t look outlined and filled in like objects in a coloring book.
Remember that this project is a learning device or an experiment. If you see
things that you want to change, here are some tips:
77
Chapter 6: A Study in Black and White

 You can redraw through the wet paint with the tip of your palette knife.
Just use it to scratch the correct line. Then you can paint up to that
edge.
 If you have excess paint of the wrong color in an area, you can remove
the paint with either a palette knife (if it’s very thick) or with a rag (more
likely). Don’t apply any solvent to the canvas — it will only create a
mess. Cover your finger with the rag, and wipe the excess paint off. As
you wipe, turn the rag to expose a fresh, dry area, and continue to
remove paint until you’ve removed the excess. You may have to wait
until the canvas is a bit dry to repaint.
Relentlessly picking at a painting is like beating a dead horse. Paintings
should look fresh. If you can’t leave the painting alone, get another canvas
and do another study of the same setup.

ixing and matching colors can be daunting. When you try to duplicate
the colors of a juicy apple, you use your instincts and make red with
black and white, but the results are dull and lifeless. Between trying to draw the
apple and match the colors, the results can be frustrating. In this chapter we
guide you through several projects that show you different ways to mix color.
We think that the best way to learn to mix color is to make a color chart. You
can use a lot of colors and concentrate on making various tints and tones
without worrying about making the colors match something real. A color chart
is usually a big, labor-intensive project, but we have an abbreviated version
that still walks you through all the spectrum colors and shows you how to
make subtle variations of each color.
After you make a color chart, take the time to put your knowledge into practice
with some oil studies (a study is just a quick informal painting). We instruct
you to paint some studies with a limited palette, meaning that you don’t use
every color you have. You discover how to make lights and darks with color
instead of black and white; this technique helps you avoid making the dreaded
muddy colors that most beginning artists make on their first paintings. The
studies are fast and increase in complexity with each project. We finish off
the chapter with a painting using all the colors possible.
Project: Using the Color Chart 
to Mix the Color You Want
When you’re ready to paint, start with a color chart — a user-friendly way to
get to know color. By making a color chart, you can learn how to mix the tube
colors that you purchased and begin to get a feel for applying paint to the
canvas in a uniform manner.

Create a grid
The first step in this project is to create a grid. Mark off a 14-x-18-inch canvas
with a grid of squares (see Figure 7-1 for an example). The chart is 12 x 12
inches, 6 squares high and 6 squares across. Each square is 2 x 2 inches. Use
a 12-inch ruler and draw the squares lightly with a #2 pencil.
Don’t use a charcoal pencil or a graphite pencil that will make heavy black
marks; it will interfere with the color chart.
Across the top, label the columns as you see in Figure 7-1: Hue, Tint, Shade, Tone,
Shade, and Tone. The following list gives you more information on each label:
 Hue: The hue is the color’s name (such as red, green, blue, or another
color) and refers to the color’s position on the color wheel. You may
want to think of these hues as sports teams’ colors, like Bengals Orange,
Colts Blue, or Cardinals Red. A pure hue is the brightest version of a hue.
 Tint: A tint is a lighter version of a hue. You make it by adding white to a
pure hue.

Part II: Break Out the Brushes and Start Painting! 

 Shade: A shade is a mixture of the pure hue plus black. Another way to
make a shade is to use the hue’s complement rather than black in these
mixtures. A complement is the hue directly across the color wheel from
the hue that you’re working with. In this project you mix shades with
both black and the complement.
 Tone: A tone is a mixture of a shade plus white, or you can think of it as
the pure hue plus black and white. You can also use the complement
rather than black in the mixture. For a more complete discussion of
color mixtures, see Chapter 17.
Down the left side, label the rows from top to bottom like this: Yellow,
Orange, Red, Violet, Blue, and Green. Figure 7-2 shows a completed grid.
Work on a table or other flat surface for this project. Open your book on your
work surface so that you can clearly see the instructions and the example.
For the rest of this project, arrange your equipment so that your palette is
right in front of you. Concentrate on the palette so that you can mix the colors
accurately. Place your canvas with the grid marked on it off to one side and
position your book on the other. Follow the directions in the following
sections step by step.

Chapter 7: Mixing Color and Three Oil Studies

Paint a hue
Because we can’t be there with you to demonstrate how to paint the color
chart, we describe the process step by step. To start filling in your grid,
follow these steps:
1. Start with cadmium yellow light.
Yellow is the easiest color to begin mixing because it’s perfect right out
of the tube. The first square of the top row starts with a pure hue — the
pure unadulterated color of yellow.
2. Onto your palette, squeeze out a half-dollar-sized pool of the cadmium
yellow light that’s about 3⁄8 of an inch thick.
This amount should be enough to last through the entire yellow row.
3. Use your 1⁄2-inch bright or other square-ended brush to pick up a small
amount of yellow and paint the first square.
Refer to Chapter 6 for step-by-step tips on applying paint to canvas.
The first square falls in the row labeled yellow and the column labeled
hue. Lay the paint on so that it completely covers the canvas and no
white shows through.
Paint a tint
The next square is a tint, which is a lighter version of the pure hue. Follow
these steps to paint the tint:
1. On your palette, take a small, dime-sized amount of the yellow and
put it over to one side.
2. Put a nickel-sized amount of titanium white on your palette.
3. Use your palette knife to pick up a very small amount of white (about
the size of half a pea) and add it to the yellow.
4. Mix the yellow and white with your palette knife until the color is 
uniform.
Use the flat side of your knife to scrape the paint toward the center of
the pool of color. If it isn’t light enough, add a bit more white, but be
careful to use a clean palette knife to pick up the color. You don’t want
any yellow in your white.
You’re learning the strength of the color as you go along. Adding colors
together in small amounts means that you see the changes gradually
and avoid making huge mistakes. You can always add more if it isn’t
enough, but you can’t take it out of the mix, so take it slow.
5. When you have a tint of yellow, apply it to the second square that cor-
responds to yellow and tint.
Do you feel like a painter yet?
82
Part II: Break Out the Brushes and Start Painting! 

Paint a shade
The next color that you mix is a shade of yellow. Use your knowledge of
painting tints from the previous section and check out these steps:
1. Take a small, dime-sized amount of the pure yellow and put it over to
one side on an open area of your palette.
2. Add a very small amount of mars black.
Black is a strong color, so add it in tiny bits at a time.
Your color will look green! It shouldn’t be too dark; it should be a kind of
pale green. If it’s too dark, just add more yellow until you get it right. See
Figure 7-2 if you’re not sure whether you have it right.
Sometimes when you mix a color, it’s so far off that you find yourself
using a ton of paint just to fix it. In these cases, cutting your losses is best.
Correct a too-dark color by putting a small amount of the bad mixture off
to one side and then mixing more of the hue with it until you get a better
color. Don’t discard the bad mixture; you may be able to use it later.
3. Use the shade of yellow that you just made to paint the next square
that lines up on your chart with yellow and shade.
Paint a tone
A tone is a combination of the hue with black and white. You can mix this one
just as you mixed the tint and the shade, by starting with pure yellow, but
you may have enough of the yellow tint or the yellow shade left over to use
one to make the tone.
If you have enough shade, just add white to it. If you have enough of the tint
left over, add a tiny touch of black to it. This tone of yellow will look like a
dull institutional green. Apply it to the tone square.
Pay attention to what you’re doing because it’s easy to lose your place by
mixing the color on your palette and forgetting to actually put it on the chart!
Try yellow with complements
The next square in the yellow row is also a shade, but this time you don’t use
black; you use the complementary color to create a shade. Yellow’s complement
is violet (also known as purple). So at this point, you make violet according to
the recipe from the chart. Just follow these steps:
1. Mix together equal parts of alizarin crimson and ultramarine blue.
The color will be so dark that you’ll have trouble telling exactly what
color you have.
2. Add a tiny bit of white (about the size of an ant) to the violet until you
see the color (see the violet square in Figure 7-2).
This is the color you use to make a shade of yellow.
83
Chapter 7: Mixing Color and Three Oil Studies

3. Put a quarter-sized pool of pure yellow on your palette and then add
a tiny amount of violet to make a shade of yellow.
Violet is a very strong color, so add it only in tiny amounts until you get
something that looks like army green. You need enough for this square
and the next, so make a pool about the size of a quarter, 3⁄8 of an inch thick.
4. Paint the yellow shade square.
5. Take what you have left over, add a little white to make a tone, and
paint the last square.
Now your yellow row is complete. But wait, if you’re going to do this work
with the violet, you may as well just do the violet row! Check out the next set
of directions to do that.
Make a violet row
Make enough violet (as you do in the previous section) to make a pool of
color the size of a half dollar and about 3⁄8 of an inch thick. Go through the
same steps as you do with the yellow:
 The first square is pure violet hue according to the recipes you see 
in Figure 7-1.
 For the next square, take a dime-sized bit of violet and add a little white
to make a tint.
 To make a shade for the following square, take some of the pure violet
and mix in a little black. It will be really dark!
 Make a tone for the fourth square by mixing the hue with black and white.
 At this point, you need some yellow to make violet’s complementary
shade. You should still have some on your palette. If you don’t, the
yellow that you need is fine right out of the tube.
Use the yellow and violet to make a mixture that looks like a dull violet.
If it looks greenish, you added too much yellow. To fix it, just take away a
small amount of this bad color and add in more violet hue to it. Then
you can paint in the next square.
 Finally, fill in the last square with the tone. Check the squares that
you’ve completed to be sure that each square has a good coat of paint
and that no white canvas shows through. You can make corrections now
while you still have paint on your palette.
Take a break
Sit back a moment and take a break. You’ve completed two rows of your color
chart. We hope that you can see the sequence that we’re walking you through.
You’re learning how to make a pure color and how to use it to make five other
versions of that color. Now you can continue on. Clean your brushes in a glass
jar of Gamsol or Turpenoid and wipe them off well so that no residue from the
old colors remains. Make sure that you have enough space on your palette to
84
Part II: Break Out the Brushes and Start Painting! 

make the next set of rows. If not, get out another sheet of palette paper (if
you’re using disposable sheets) or use your razor tool to scrape off a clean
area on your glass palette.
Complete the remaining rows
Consult the color chart in Figure 7-1 for the recipes for each color that you need
to create the hue column. The chart also includes the recipe for each of the
tints, shades, and tones. Do the orange row next, followed by its complement,
the blue row. Then complete the red and the green rows. At each stage, make
the hue, the tint, the shade, the tone, and so on until you finish the row. Try
not to stop your painting session in the middle of a row. Completing a row
during a single painting session ensures that your color is harmonious and
uniform. Compare your completed chart with the one in Figure 7-2. Don’t
worry if your color chart is lighter or darker overall. That’s part of working
with your own judgment.
Sit back and assess
To assess your work, note the following:
 Each row should go together. The yellow row has colors that look yellow
and green, and the orange row has colors that look orange and others
that look like a brownish color, but otherwise they all look like versions
of the original hue.
 Vertically, the hue column looks very intense. The tints column looks pale
or light. The shades look intense, but darker than the hues, and the tones
look dull.
 If you find that the last two squares of a row look very different, like they
don’t belong in that row, you likely added too much of the complement.
Don’t worry about it. You’re learning how to mix color, and if isn’t just
right, you have plenty of time for more practice with color in Chapter 17.
Project: Finding Your Local Color: 
An Analogous Painting
Painting objects in color can be tricky for the beginner. Your instincts tell you
to use black to make a color darker and white to make it lighter, but the effect
just kills the intensity of the color. The problem with black and white is that
they neutralize the color, and everything starts to look rather gray and blah.
In this section, we tell you how to use closely related colors to make things
appear sculptural and three-dimensional without killing the color. We describe,
step by step, how to use analogous color to make things appear lighter or
darker.
85
Chapter 7: Mixing Color and Three Oil Studies

This is a study — not a serious painting — so making mistakes is fine. We just
want you to feel comfortable trying out new ideas.
You’re learning to use color to make the objects you’re painting appear lighter
and darker. For this painting you won’t use any black or white. Put the tubes
away so that you aren’t tempted to use them. We recommend a 14-x-18-inch
canvas for this project.
Set up your still life
If you want to follow along with us, gather a green apple, an orange, and a
lemon. The fruit should be real, but if you use fake fruit, be sure that it looks
realistic. Funny-looking fruit makes a funny-looking painting! Arrange the pieces
of fruit on a cloth similar to the one you see in the example in Figure 7-3. Set
up your arrangement and your lighting as closely as you can to the photo-
graph of our setup.
You may be tempted to work from Figure 7-3 rather than your own setup, but
we can’t stress enough the importance of working from observation. Painting
from observation is like learning a new language, and like language, practice
is important.
If you want to work with different objects, look for objects that are only one
color. The citrus fruit and the green apple are good because they’re the same
color top to bottom. Objects that are medium or light in color are best for
this exercise, so avoid eggplants, dark red apples, and other dark fruits and
vegetables. We walk you through working from these types of items later in
this chapter. You can also use boxes covered in plain, vividly colored paper.
Figure 7-3:

photo, you

and ready to

86
Part II: Break Out the Brushes and Start Painting! 

For the table and background, select bright fabrics. Felt is good choice, but
any non-shiny fabric will do. (Avoid using satin. It’s pretty, but it will make
you crazy if you haven’t painted before.)
For this exercise, limit your setup to three items and light it with a strong
spot from a low angle (see Chapter 16 for more info on lighting). Study the
example in Figure 7-3 to see how to do this.
Frame and sketch
Use a viewfinder to frame your scene — if you’ve already done the black and
white painting in Chapter 6, you’ve had some practice at framing your scene.
Next, you begin sketching in paint with a light color. Cadmium yellow is a good
choice. Make a wash of the color with your solvent, and use the wash to draw
the objects out — again, just like in the black and white painting (see Chapter 6).
Be sure to make the objects nice and big, at least life-size. (See Figure 7-4 for
an example of the still life with some color blocked in.)
Now put down your brushes and study your drawing. Ask yourself the following
questions:
 Are the objects running off the edge and cut off by the edge of the
canvas? Redraw so that most of the objects fit.
 Are the objects nice and big? If you’re using small items, make sure that
each item is about the size of the palm of your hand but no larger than the
size of your entire hand.
Having a good setup is half the battle! Make corrections to your drawing by
choosing a color slightly darker that the first. As you can see in Figure 7-4, we
use cadmium yellow for the initial drawing, and then switch to yellow ochre.
Be sure that the mixture is thin; it will look like colored water, not paint.
Using a different color helps you keep track of which line to use when you
begin to develop the painting.

Chapter 7: Mixing Color and Three Oil Studies

Find the local color
Look at the objects you have and ask yourself what colors they are. The
green apple is more yellow-green than green; the orange is, of course, orange;
and the lemon is yellow. This is called their local color, the natural color of an
object as it appears in normal light. Don’t worry about the effects of lights
and shadows yet; just concentrate on the local color.
Now mix a small pool of color to match the local color of one of your objects.
You need about the same amount that you use for each square of the color chart
(see “Project: Using the Color Chart to Mix the Color You Want” for details).
The recipes from the color chart will help you get the color you need. Start
with the orange, and mix a color similar to the orange on the color chart. You
may have to adjust the actual color by using more cadmium yellow light or
cadmium red light to get the color just right.
To match color perfectly, put some of your paint on your palette knife and
hold it up to the object. Make sure that you hold it up to the side of the orange
that’s evenly lit — not the shaded side or the highlighted side. If you see a
color in the object that’s missing on the knife, add that color. For example, if
your orange (the fruit, not the color) looks more yellow than the paint on the
knife, add yellow; if it looks more reddish, add red. Experiment with the cadmium
yellow light and cadmium red light as well as yellow ochre to get it just right.
It takes practice, but like tasting soup for enough salt, you try and try and
add just a little bit at a time until you get it right.
Choose analogous colors
Refer to the color wheel from the Cheat Sheet in the front of this book. Find
the color that comes the closest to the color of the orange in your still life.
What colors are on either side of it? For orange, you see yellow-orange on one
side and red-orange on the other. If you go one more step out, you see yellow
on one side and red on the other. These colors are analogous, or closely related,
to orange. Find the tubes of colors that match these colors and put them 
on your palette as well. You don’t have to mix anything at this point — just
squeeze out small amounts, about the size of a dime, and arrange them on
your palette about 3 to 4 inches apart. If you’re concentrating on the orange,
you have cadmium yellow light, cadmium red light, yellow ochre, and alizarin
crimson.
Begin applying color
Take the orange paint that you made and apply a thin wash to the orange on
your canvas. Cover the middle and shaded side of the orange with this color.
As you get to the part of the orange that’s lighter, pick up some cadmium yellow
with the same brush and add it right to the canvas. It will look yellow-orange;
you can also add more pure yellow to the exact point where the light hits the
orange.
88
Part II: Break Out the Brushes and Start Painting! 

For the shaded side, make a color that’s more red-orange. Use a fresh, clean
brush to apply it to the underside of the orange on your canvas. Now your
orange fruit is orange with yellow highlights and a red-orange shaded side.
You can use a red that has a bit of alizarin crimson for the very bottom of the
orange.
Don’t blend the colors. Apply them in a blocky fashion. Don’t get too picky —
just block in the colors and leave them. Don’t remove the color from your
palette; just leave the paint on your palette and move on to the next object.
Paint objects with analogous colors
You can use any related color as an analogous color. You can paint an orange
by using cadmium yellow light, cadmium red light, yellow ochre, or any
yellow-orange-red type of color. You can paint a green apple by using cad-
mium yellow light, yellow ochre, or any green made with a blue and a yellow.
Continue with the rest of the painting
Now you can work on the remaining elements of the painting.
Lemon
The lemon is a little tricky because its local color is cadmium yellow light
right out of the tube, and that’s the lightest color you have. Yellow is the
lightest color on the color wheel, so it functions as the highlight. With yellow
objects, you have to figure out which direction to move on the color chart to
find the analogous color (a color similar to yellow) to create a shadow of
yellow that looks like it belongs on a lemon. Paint the entire lemon cadmium
yellow light, and then move on to the shaded side.
Your analogous color options are green and orange. When you look closely at
the lemon on the shaded side, you notice that it looks greenish on the darker
side. So use yellow for the highlight and yellow-green for the shaded side.
Experiment with different greens for your lemon. You may have a tube of
green, or you can make green using yellow and a blue — either ultramarine or
cerulean. You can try yellow ochre or some of the orange types of color, but
the color may end up looking more like a squash than a lemon.
Green apple
Move on to the green apple. Your sketchy line is going to be basically round,
but you know that the shape of an apple is significantly different than that of
an orange. The stem comes out on the top through an indention. Refer to
Figure 7-5 and follow these steps:
1. Using a yellow wash for your drawing, adjust the shape of the apple.
It may be more squat than a perfect circle, or it may have tapered sides.
89
Chapter 7: Mixing Color and Three Oil Studies

2. Find the little indention at the top of the apple, and use your yellow to
make a mark.
Too low or too high? Change it with the next analogous color (like
yellow-green).
3. Use yellow to establish the structure of the apple by making a center
line right through the middle of the apple like you’re stabbing it.
4. Draw an ellipse on the top of the apple (as you see in Figure 7-5), and
then make a second ellipse to mark the shoulders of the apple.
You’ve established the structure of the apple.
A green apple’s local color is yellow-green, so mix that up first. The apple also
has yellow highlights and a green-shaded side. Use cadmium yellow, and a
tiny bit of both ultramarine blue and cerulean blue. These colors are analo-
gous to the apple’s local color of yellow-green. See how that works?
Find the shaded side that’s away from the light, and paint it in with a thin
wash of yellow-green. Continue to fill in the lights with yellow and the shaded
side with green. The green is in the top indention and also off to one side of
the indention. Use yellow or a lighter version of yellow-green to fill in the
lightest part of the green apple.
The cloth and background
Establish the correct color for the cloth and for the cast shadows on the
cloth. We use a blue cloth, but you may have something different. Identify the
local color of your cloth first, and then the analogous colors. Don’t get fancy.
The right answer to the question could be what you’d hear from a 5-year-old,
“What color is it? It’s blue.” If your cloth is blue, refer to your color chart to
Figure 7-5:
How to
draw an
apple.
90
Part II: Break Out the Brushes and Start Painting! 

help you mix the color on your palette. For our cloth, we use cerulean blue
and ultramarine blue. Find all the blues, blue-greens, and blue-violets that
may work for your cloth. The shadows cast by the objects onto the cloth are
a darker version of the color of the cloth; they have nothing to do with the
color of the object casting the shadow.
Don’t worry about the effects of light on the cloth. If you’re getting some
shine off the material, just ignore it for this study.
Take the color of the cloth and the color for the cast shadows and apply
them to the painting in a thin wash.
The final area you need to consider is any of the background that hasn’t been
painted yet. No matter what you see beyond your setup, you want to paint it
very simply. For the purposes of this exercise, choose a dark, cool color, such
as blue or blue-violet, and fill in the background with a thin wash.
Assess your work
Stand back about 6 to 8 feet and assess the result of your still life. Remember
that this is a study; don’t worry about details. The painting will appear
bright, vivid, and rather gaudy, as you can see in Figure 7-6.
Ask yourself these questions:
 Can I tell the direction of the light?
 Is the lighting consistent and believable looking?
 Can I tell what each object is? That’s a bonus!
Figure 7-6:
Not bad. At
least you
can tell
what the
objects are,
and the

91
Chapter 7: Mixing Color and Three Oil Studies

You have a successful study. Now you can go back and apply a heavier layer of
paint on each item, the cloth, and the background. As you work, you can vary
the color that you put on the items to create more complex color. In each case,
try the analogous colors to experiment with the tube colors that you have.
Project: Using Complementary Colors
Complementary colors are colors that are opposite each other on the color
wheel. The opposite of orange is blue; the opposite of green is red. Use com-
plementary colors to add depth and complexity to your paintings.
For this study, start out the same way you do for the previous project on finding
local color. Draw the items on the canvas so that they’re life-size or larger by
using a light version of the local color. Continue painting by blocking in the
major colors and highlights as you do in the analogous painting. But in this
painting, you add complementary colors to the mix. This is how it works:
 For the middle value of each object, use the local color, as you do in the
previous project.
 For the highlights, use the lighter analogous color to indicate the direction
of the light.
 For the shaded side, use the darker analogous color plus a little of the
complementary color to make a shade of your local color, just like you
do on the color chart in the first project in this chapter.
Start this project with the same objects, equipment, and supplies that you used
in the previous project. You’re still using only colors — no black or white.
Think about the colors
You may have to figure out what complementary colors you’re using. Oranges
are easy — the complement is blue — and lemons are yellow, so their com-
plement is violet. But what about that green apple? It’s more yellow-green
than true green. The complement is the color directly across the color wheel
(see the Cheat Sheet in the front of this book). In this case, the complement is
red-violet. In every case use a little of the complement for each color in the
shade. Learn as you go and experiment.
Paint your study
1. Start your complementary painting as you do the analogous painting
(“Project: Finding Your Local Color: An Analogous Painting”).
Start with a wash of yellow (or live dangerously and try another light
color, such as yellow-green or cerulean blue) and sketch in all the objects
in your setup.
92
Part II: Break Out the Brushes and Start Painting! 

2. Continue the painting with the local color for each object, and use the
analogous color that’s lighter for the highlights.
Don’t go forward with the cloth just yet — concentrate on the fruit for
this step.
3. Start with the orange and mix up some orange paint with a little bit of
blue paint; apply this color to the underside of the orange.
See the color chart from Figure 7-1 for more info. The result should look
brownish; if it’s going toward green, add a tiny bit of red until you have
something that looks like dark orange.
4. Adjust the colors on the orange until you have a broad range of value
and the color looks true, as shown in Figure 7-7.
Fine-tune your colors
In each case, mix the local color of the object and the analogous colors to
create a variety of lights and middle color. Then add a bit of the complement
for the shaded areas. Here are some tips:
 For the green apple, try cadmium red.
 For lemons, try violet made with ultramarine and alizarin crimson.
 For red peppers, use a green made with ultramarine blue and yellow.
 For green peppers, use alizarin crimson (the cadmium red is too light
and it won’t create a shadow).

Chapter 7: Mixing Color and Three Oil Studies

Now paint the cloth by using the complement for the shadow, and paint the
background simply as you do in the previous project on finding local color.
Assess your work
Sit back and assess your work. You’re giving the oil paint a chance to set up a
bit, and you’re gaining some perspective on what you’ve achieved. Some
objects will look pretty good, and some may look a bit iffy. Don’t worry, and
don’t hold yourself to too high a standard. You’re still practicing!
Consider these questions: Are the objects well drawn? Can you tell the direc-
tion of the light?
The colors are way over-the-top bright on both the analogous painting and
the complementary painting. It looks like Matisse in North Africa. The sun is
intense and it lights up all the colors until it’s difficult to look at them. Whew!
Did you cover all parts of the canvas? Touch up any blank areas and then put
them aside to dry.
Project: Full Color Painting
Now you’re ready to start on a painting that includes all the colors. Use the
same-size canvas, equipment, and paints as you do in the other projects in
this chapter, but now you can use black and white paints, too.
Set up your still life
You can use the same objects for your still life setup, or you can branch out
and try something different. We use a white sugar canister, a red apple, and a
lemon on a blue box and it all sits on a green cloth.
Paint with all the colors
Refer to Figure 7-8 to see the initial sketch for this project. The following
steps walk you through this painting:
1. Begin with a wash of color for your drawing, and then add a wash of
the local color of each object, the analogous color for the highlight,
and the analogous/complementary color for the shaded side.
For example, we start with the apple at the stage where it has color all
over it and it’s sitting on a cloth with a cast shadow. (Skip forward to
Figure 7-8 to see what we mean.) The colors are all blocked in, and it’s
super bright.

Part II: Break Out the Brushes and Start Painting! 

2. Make up the color that you use to apply a thicker coat.
We have red for the middle area and red-orange for the highlight.
Add a little white to the red-orange — just enough to look like a high-
light. The wash for the underside of the apple has some red-violet plus
some blue. It may look just great as it is! But experiment and make up
the same color again — red, red-violet with a little blue — and then put a
touch of black in it. Apply this to the apple. Does it improve the effect, or
does it look dull and weird? That’s the issue with black.
Many artists for many years have said that black shouldn’t be used in
painting. They say that it kills the intensity of the colors, makes things
look dull, and is an easy crutch to making paint darker. Most artists use
the complement to make a color darker or a combination of other dark
colors mixed with the local color along with the complement. This is a
truism that you’ll hear, and many people get really intense about this
issue. But sometimes you just have to use black to either correctly
match a very dark color or to depict a color that isn’t brightly lighted.
The important thing to remember is that it’s your painting, and you can
decide for yourself whether using black is effective or not.
3. Continue with this approach for the canister, the lemon, the box, and
the cloth.
Use the analogous colors first. Adjust them with some white in the high-
lights and in the complementary color on the shaded side. You may or
may not want to add some black in the shadows. Some of the objects
present some challenges.

Chapter 7: Mixing Color and Three Oil Studies

4. Paint the canister — or any other white object that you use — just like
you do in the black and white painting (see Chapter 6).
As an object with no color of its own, it picks up some reflected color
from other surfaces (see Figure 7-9). See how the underside of the canis-
ter picks up just a bit of the green? You can also see a bit of red reflected
from the apple.
5. Paint the darker objects — like the dark red apple — by using a
combination of everything we tell you about in this chapter.
The apple’s local color is made with alizarin crimson and cadmium red
light. The highlights have white, and the shaded side has the local color
plus ultramarine blue and viridian. These colors are all transparent (see
Chapter 2 for more information); you may have to add a touch of black
to make the paint opaque. This will happen whenever you use the trans-
parent colors.
6. Complete the rest of the painting as you do in the projects throughout
this chapter.
Use all the colors you have and experiment a bit to become familiar with
the way they interact. Be sure to cover the entire canvas with paint — leave
no bare areas of canvas showing. You can repeat any of these studies for
more practice, but you’re ready to move on to some other subjects.

Brushstrokes and Glazing
Techniques
In This Chapter
 Using basic brush techniques and different types of brushes
 Glazing and other fancy tricks
 Trying a painting technique project
You’ve most likely painted something in your life: a kitchen, a garage, or a
poster for a school event. So, you know that brushes pick up paint and
then spread it evenly over a surface. But fine art painting is more than just
covering a wall or lettering a sign. Artists’ brushes can do many things, from
making a clean edge to showing the texture of foliage to blending the blush
on a baby’s cheek.
In this chapter, we cover all the brushes out there, including sizes, shapes,
and their uses. We explain some basic ways to use brushes and then move on
to some interesting ways of creating layers of color.
Painting with Your Brushes
At this point, we assume that you have your equipment and have already made
a few paintings. After the first three or four paintings, every artist begins to
develop a preference for a particular brush. You’ll catch yourself staring at
the brush and saying endearing things to it. Maybe it’s the shape or the size
or just that it’s a different (better quality) brush than the others you picked
up. You’re getting to know brushes and what they can do.
Working with a good brush that suits your painting methods means that the
painting process feels more natural. So, make a note of the shape, size, and brand
of your favorite brush. Write it down. When it’s time to go brush shopping, you
can make some informed choices. In the following sections, we go over some of
the basic features of your brush so that you know what to ask about.

Paintbrush basics
A paintbrush is made up of bristles, the handle, and the ferrule (that little
sleeve of metal) that holds the bristles to the handle. Brushes are usually
about 12 inches long, which allows you to vary the brushstrokes just by
changing the way you hold the brush. Here are some examples:
 By holding the brush down by the ferrule, you use the small muscles of
your hand and fingers and have fine control over the strokes.
 By holding the brush farther away from the ferrule, you have a looser
hold on the brush for loose, expressive strokes. Some artists make specific
use of the brush to get this quality. Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti
attached extensions to his brush handles to make them as long as possible
in order to have the least control over his brushstrokes.
The handle also makes a convenient tool for measuring and sighting. Use the
handle of the brush as a bridge to steady your hand while you work. Balance
the end of a dry, clean brush against the side of the canvas or easel to support
your hand while you paint with another brush. Mahl sticks are tools made
especially for this purpose.
The size and shape of the bristles determine what type of mark the brush makes:
 A short, square-ended bright makes square corners and tight edges. You
can easily control it. This brush is great for geometric shapes or man-
made objects.
 Long, floppy filberts make elegant, organic, lozenge-shaped marks, perfect
for organic, natural objects.
 In addition to regular bristle brushes, you also see brushes with sable or
synthetic fibers. These brushes are more delicate than the bristle
brushes and leave less of a mark. So, you have a choice of shape, size,
and type of bristle.
Choosing the right brush
Brushes come in four basic shapes: filbert, flat, bright, and round (see Figure 8-1).
Each makes a distinct mark and is useful, so get one of each! Check out the
following list for more info on each brush:
 Filbert: Paint natural organic forms, leaves, clouds, and living things
with this brush.
 Flat: Paint large areas of color, geometric forms, square corners, and
clean crisp edges; or make blocky marks for a cubist manner of painting.
 Bright: This brush is shorter and stubbier and holds less paint than a
flat, but you use it in a similar manner.
 Round: You can use this brush like a filbert, but it’s also great for drawing
lines.
98
Part II: Break Out the Brushes and Start Painting! 

In addition to the basic shapes, you may also be enticed by some fancy
brushes and even brushes that aren’t intended for oil painting at all.
Cosmetic brushes may even find their way into your box. Many artists use
unorthodox tools to get the job done. Here are some of the not-so-basic tools
that you may want to try:
 Fan brushes: Use these brushes for fine blending. They aren’t absolutely
necessary for blending, but many artists find them useful.
 Extra long filberts: These brushes make very loose, expressive marks.
 Watercolor brushes: Although they aren’t made for oil paint and the
solvent eventually damages the fibers, some artists use them anyway.
 Stencil brushes: Chubby and round, you can use a stencil brush for dry
brush.
 House painting brushes: These come in large sizes for big projects.
Latex house painting brushes are great to apply gesso when you’re
preparing your canvas. House painting brushes can be used for blending
and dry brush as well.
 Foam brushes: These brushes aren’t made for fine art painting, but you
can use them to pick up excess paint and for dry brush.
 Painting knives: A painting knife is a palette knife that’s more rigid. Use
it to pick up paint and apply it to the canvas like a trowel. Painting
knives come in various shapes and sizes.

Chapter 8: Putting Paint to Canvas: Brushstrokes and Glazing Techniques

In Chapter 3, we recommend that you get only china bristle brushes. They have
stiff, off-white bristles. They’re tough and no-nonsense and stand up to the
abuse of a rookie painter. After you’ve painted for a while, try out some of
these other types of fibers that are available:
 Sable: Use these for soft blends. They’re delicate and need more care
than bristle, but they create a quieter kind of mark, or no mark at all.
 Synthetic brushes: These brushes come in soft fibers similar to the natural
sable, as well as stronger fibers. They aren’t as tough as natural bristle,
but they aren’t as soft as sables either. They behave much like sables,
but they’re a bit more durable.
A soft bristle brush, whether natural sable or synthetic, allows you to make
soft gradual blends and work with more delicacy. Only you can decide
whether this is a key part of the way you paint.
Once upon a time, using synthetic brushes with oil paint wasn’t recommended.
The solvent damaged the synthetic fibers, and the brushes ended up bald or
hard as a rock. Synthetics were for acrylic only. Now, the new synthetic bristles
are tough and as long lasting as hog bristle. But always check when you buy
them to make sure that your brushes are designed for oil painting.
Examples of brushstrokes
In Chapter 10, we cover several ways to apply paint to canvas in an immedi-
ate, direct painting manner. This manner of painting is also called alla prima,
meaning “from the beginning” or “all at once.” Alla prima paintings are com-
pleted in one session. We painted Figures 10-5 and 10-9 on small 8-x-10-inch
canvases, so we had to use relatively small brushes. Remember that the
brush size depends on the overall size of your format. Generally speaking,
you use small brushes on small canvases and larger brushes on larger can-
vases. The size of the mark they make has a proportional relationship to the
size of the canvas. Check out the figures in Chapter 10 and this list for some
examples of how this works:
 Figure 10-5 is a simplified painting of a building. We painted the three sides
using a #1 flat brush for the corners and a #4 flat to fill in the color for
each side. Use a #6 and a #8 flat for a 14-x-18-inch canvas.
 A study of grasses is in Figure 10-9. We painted all the various blades of
grass with a #2 round. Use a #4 round for a 14-x-18-inch canvas.
 A painting of a bush in Figure 10-9 shows how to apply paint in small
dabs of color. We painted the leaves and small bits of shadow using #2
and #4 filberts. Use #4 and #6 filberts for a 14-x-18-inch canvas.
 A painting of two pine trees, also in Figure 10-9, shows how to apply
paint in patches of color. We used a #4 filbert. Use a #4 or #6 filbert for a
14-x-18-inch canvas.
We started each of the landscape paintings with larger brushes in the darker
colors, and then we added middle values with smaller brushes. We added the
highlights last with the smallest brush.
100
Part II: Break Out the Brushes and Start Painting! 

For example, in Chapter 7, Figure 7-6 is a still life on a 14-x-18-inch canvas. We
applied the patches of color for the shadows on the fruit by using a #4 and #6
bright. We established the local color and painted it in with the larger brush,
and then we added the shadows with the smaller brush.
This really isn’t a science. Your humble authors each have a preference for
the type of brush that we use. One of us paints almost everything with round
brushes and the other prefers flats and brights. You know what brushes you
prefer after working on three or four paintings. Trust your gut instinct and
buy the brushes that you know you’ll use the most.
Exploring Different Types of Glazing
One of the advantages of painting in oil is that you can work in layers of color.
The big overall term for this technique is glazing. Glazing is one of those con-
fusing art terms that has two meanings:
 Glazing can refer to any type of painting that allows you to see two distinct
colors at the same time. You can see this definition in layers of color
thinned with medium, or when paint is scraped or scratched off a sur-
face. You can also see it when paint is stippled in small spots of color.
 Glazing also refers to the particular type of painting in thin layers where you
dilute a transparent color with a painting medium. We do this experiment in
Chapter 2 when we tell you about the different properties of oil paint.
Up to this point, we’ve concentrated on establishing a good uniform layer.
Now you can explore some other properties of oil paint. As a bit of history,
oil painting owes a lot of its knowledge to the Renaissance artists. So, now
you get to learn some fancy Italian terms for painting as well.
Bringing out the undertones: Imprimatura
Imprimatura refers to starting with a colored surface instead of a white ground.
Use it to establish the undertones. You can achieve imprimatura through two
different methods:
 Method 1: When you make your own canvas, tint the last coat of gesso
with acrylic paint (not oil paint — it won’t mix). Keep the color subtle. The
color you choose has an effect on how the overall color of the painting
turns out.
 Method 2: When you have a pre-made canvas, stain it with a fast-drying
coat of paint. You can leave a uniform field of color or wipe some color
off in a pattern for your initial drawing for your image. (In our example in
Figure 8-2, we applied a wash of yellow ochre to the canvas.) Allow the
paint to dry just a little bit, and then take a rag or a clean, dry paintbrush
and wipe away some of the paint to establish the light areas of your image.
Let it dry completely before continuing with the painting. This technique
works a lot like a subtractive drawing (drawings made by covering the
paper with charcoal and using an eraser to pull out the light areas of the
drawing rather than laying in dark areas as the way you normally do).
101
Chapter 8: Putting Paint to Canvas: Brushstrokes and Glazing Techniques

Painting with transparent paint 
(also called glazing)
To create a glaze, you need a glazing medium. Follow these steps:
1. Start with a transparent color, and dry the paint by letting it rest on a
piece of paper until you see a ring of oil on the paper (it should take
about two hours).
2. Transfer the stiff paint back to your palette and use your palette knife
to mix the paint with a glazing medium until you have a syrupy 
consistency.
3. Apply this glaze with a soft, dry brush in a thin uniform coat over dry
paint.
Glazes are usually a dark color applied over a light color. You may have
to work on a flat surface if your glaze is too syrupy and drippy.
In Figure 8-3, artist Michael Schulbaum used a classic glazing method on this
still life painting. He painted the entire image — bottles, cloths, and gold
medallions — in shades of gray only. After the paint was dry, he added the glazes
over parts of the images so that the gray remains visible but you see the
images through the thin layers of color. Look closely at the bottle with the red
liquid. On the top half of the bottle you see the glass in grays only; the artist
added the liquid by painting a glaze of vermilion and other reds over the gray.
You can still see the lights and darks of the gray underpainting while you see
the red liquid at the same time. The artist used the same method to paint the
yellow bottle and the cuff links.

Scumbling and sgraffito
Scumbling is a thin or transparent layer of paint that’s rubbed or scraped off.
Start with an area of your painting that’s dry and apply a thin wet layer of oil
paint. Then rub or scrape off enough so that only a residue is left behind. This
technique works well with opaque colors, especially a light color over a dark
color.
Sgraffito is similar to scumbling but you scratch off the paint to make definite
marks, lines, or textures.
Figure 8-4 shows an example of both scumbling and sgraffito.

Chapter 8: Putting Paint to Canvas: Brushstrokes and Glazing Techniques

Trying the dry brush technique
Dry brush is the application of a stiff, dried paint with a dry brush on a dry
surface (see the earlier section, “Painting with transparent paint [also called
glazing]” for more information). The effect is small specks of paint that stand
up on the surface.
Use a light touch and a stiff, dry brush as you drag the brush over the paint-
ing. Hold the brush at a shallow angle in relation to the canvas. The paint
sticks only to the parts of the painting that are prominent. A rough-textured
surface is more effective than a smooth canvas, and it produces more specks.
This technique works best when applied with a slightly hard brush over a
textured surface. In our example in Figure 8-5, the artist used dry brush to
paint the light and dark creases of the denim jeans. The close-up of the
details is shown as well.
Adding texture with impasto
Impasto is painting with thick paint to add texture to an image. You can apply
impasto with a painting knife or with brushes. Use the paint right out of the
tube or make it heavier and stiffer by adding purchased impasto mediums to
the paint. You can also dry the oil paint before application by first mixing the
approximate color that you want to use, and then leaving the paint to sit for
an hour or two until it becomes more firm. You can also dry the paint as
described in the earlier section, “Painting with transparent paint (also called
glazing)”. After an hour or two, transfer the paint to your palette and apply it
with a brush or a knife to the canvas.

As you can see in the self-portrait painting in Figure 8-6, impasto painting can
add quite a bit of energy to your work. With impasto painting, the vigorous
marks of the brush or knife stay apparent on the canvas. 
The paint sticks up above the surface (see Figure 8-7 for the detail) and adds
dimension to the painting. It creates an expressive and fragmented dramatic
quality in the work.

Chapter 8: Putting Paint to Canvas: Brushstrokes and Glazing Techniques

Project: A Study Trying Different Strokes
The project in this section allows you to try as many of the fancy ways of
putting paint on a canvas as possible. The best way to try various brushstrokes
and glazing methods is to work on an old painting. By now, you probably have
a canvas that didn’t turn out well — maybe an abandoned first effort, or a
painting that you completed but just isn’t strong. Be sure that the canvas is
completely dry. It can’t be tacky or even a bit soft. The experiments that you’re
going to do can soften the old paint up again and interfere with your tests. See
the before version of our painting in Figure 8-8. Then follow these steps to com-
plete your own project (and check out our completed version in Figure 8-9):
1. Assess the overall painting.
In our example, the underpainting on most parts of the canvas is good,
but the lower portion is completely bare and the color is inconsistent in
the sky. The image is good, and nothing needs to be corrected in the
drawing, so we started the painting from this point.
If your drawing or image needs to be corrected, you can go ahead and
start the project anyway and make the changes in the drawing or image
as you go. This is a great project to try to save an otherwise discarded
painting.
2. Start your painting by adding color to areas that need a change or an
additional layer of color.
In our example, we started the painting by adding a new layer of pale blue
to the sky and parts of the water. We thinned the light blue with a painting
medium to allow the underpainting to show through in places. We also
Figure 8-8:

106
Part II: Break Out the Brushes and Start Painting! 

painted over the water with a glaze of Prussian blue, viridian, and cobalt
blue. For the reflection of the green hill in the middle of the painting, we
used a glaze of viridian and Prussian blue to paint over that area of the
lake. In your painting you may want to start with an area of color that you
can adjust in a similar manner, such as a background in a still life.
3. Find an appropriate place in your painting to practice flat, horizontal
brushstrokes.
When you’re painting anything that lies on the face of the earth, such as
water or roads, try these flat, horizontal brushstrokes. They make the
surface lie down and look believable. We applied the brushstrokes for
the water in strokes parallel to the horizon. This can also work for the
flat surface of a table in a still life.
You can also add other types of brushstrokes if you don’t have some-
thing flat in your painting. For example, you can enhance the appear-
ance of the leaves of a tree or flower by adding spots and dashes of
color to improve the look of the texture of the form.
4. Practice the scumble technique.
We applied a scumble to the face of the dune. For the sand, we mixed
together raw sienna, burnt umber, and white. The color was too vivid, 
so we grayed it down a touch with some purple that was left over from a
previous painting. We applied the scumbling and then scraped it off with
a palette knife to give the sand dune its distinctive texture.
5. Practice dry brush techniques.
For this layer, we started with the same paint we used for the scumbling
in Step 4. For the dry brush techniques, we added more white to this sand
color, and we applied it to the sand dune using a dry brush.

Chapter 8: Putting Paint to Canvas: Brushstrokes and Glazing Techniques

6. Hold the brush loosely to achieve a natural look.
We made the tree at the top left of our painting by using a small round
brush that we twisted between our fingers to make the limbs and leaves
appear random. When you’re painting something natural, making it look
like it grew in a normal way can be difficult. The more you try to get it
right, the more control you exert, and the tree ends up looking fake. By
holding the brush loosely and slightly twisting it in your fingers, you have
the least control, and your form has a more natural look.
7. Dry some paint, transfer it back to your palette, and apply the stiff
paint to your painting with a palette knife.
We made the dark green in the foreground with burnt umber, viridian,
Prussian blue, and a little cadmium yellow light. We put this paint on a
piece of drawing paper (computer paper works too) and let it dry for two
hours. Then we transferred it back to the palette and used it to paint the
dark green juniper shrubs. We scratched some of it away using the sgraffito
method. We applied the rest of the texture with a combination of dry
brush and sgrafitto and then blended a bit with a dry brush.

In this part . . .
W
e cover three of the main categories of painting,
often called genres. We cover each topic — the still
life, the landscape, and the portrait — in a separate chap-
ter with a project or two to help you master the speciﬁc
challenges of each. Whether it’s the reﬂection in a body of
water or challenges of painting a portrait, we show you
the special methods of drawing, color mixing, and paint
application that are appropriate to each genre.
You’re now getting into the real substance of painting. Be
sure to take some time to visit museums and galleries
while you continue your progress through this part.
Seeing real paintings (not images in books or on the
Internet) allows you to see a wide variety of techniques,
brushstrokes, and compositions that are possible for
these fascinating subjects.

Chapter 9
Tricky Still Life Subjects 
Made Easy
In This Chapter
 Discovering the basics of painting metal and glass
 Working with a painting medium
 Practicing with plants and flowers
 Painting expressively
T
he world is full of beautiful things. You see sparking light and complex
colors on the surfaces of flowers, glass, and metal. The world is all opening
up to you as you build your skills in painting. Painting difficult subjects is a
feat — a test of your skills — and you’re ready for the challenge.
After you complete the projects in the previous chapters, you know color and
how to use it to create the illusion of a three-dimensional form. After you work
through the previous chapter, you have a variety of ways to apply color to
anything that you choose.
We present here three subjects that cover a wide range of surfaces — both
man-made and natural. These projects explain how to capture the glimmer of
glass and the glowing patina of metal. The last project covers plants and flowers
so that you can learn to paint natural-looking organic shapes. This chapter
sets the stage for experiments with working expressively with your materials
and allows you to put something of yourself in your paintings.
Metal and Other Shiny Objects
A tin can is a quite humble thing. However, a painting of a tin can has all the
complexity of a 19th-century tea set — but without all the pressure. It also
has the advantages of being readily available, doesn’t need polishing, and
comes in an easy-to-draw geometric shape.
You can try other shiny metal items: chrome appliances, scissors, flatware, or
tools. The shapes are more complex, and they may trip you up a bit as you try
to get the forms just right, but they make good subjects. All have the quality
of being reflective. Some may have an inherent color to work with as well —
brass, for example. And all these items add to your repertoire of objects that
you can paint.

112
Part III: People, Places, and Things 
To tackle painting metal in easy steps, though, we start with that humble tin can.
Project: A Tin Can
The tin can you need for this project is, of course, cylindrical, rather small,
and has ribs on it. You may find cans without ribs and some with dozens of
ribs. Find a medium to small can (6 to 15 ounces) with some ribs, but not too
many (ten is ideal). Otherwise, painting all those lines just gets too confusing.
You can paint an image of the can by itself, or make a small still life with the
can. Place the can on a surface with some color and experiment with the
lighting and placement of other items around the can. Anything near it will be
reflected on the metal. Put some pencils in the can, place a brightly colored
object nearby, and play with the reflections. Don’t place more than three
items in the setup — that way, you can concentrate on painting the can. Refer
to our examples in Figures 9-1 through 9-3 while you review the steps, and
then get started on your own painting.
As with every painting, you have to be able to easily see your setup and your
canvas. The still life should be about 2 to 4 feet away from you. You should
have good lighting for the surface of your canvas, as well as for the objects
that you’re painting. Be sure to make yourself comfortable as you start to
work. (Review Chapter 5 for details.) A good setup for your still life and your
work makes a more successful painting.
This painting takes more than just one session. Make sure that you can leave
your setup in one place without the items being moved.
Figure 9-1:

Drawing
Start by drawing the tin can and any other objects in your setup on the
canvas. In the example in Figure 9-1, we used a wash of yellow to draw the
can and box. We laid in the can, its cast shadow, and the box with light
sketchy lines so that we could easily correct them.
1. On a 14-x-18-inch canvas, draw the tin can by making ellipses for the
top and bottom and then connect them for the sides.
This step uses the transparent construction method that we describe in
Chapter 13. The tin can is just a cylinder with ribs. Remember that
ellipses are best made by keeping your hand steady and making a circu-
lar motion using the muscles in your upper arm.
2. At the top of the can, make several ellipses, one on top of the other,
and then select the best one and darken it to emphasize it.
3. Repeat Step 2 for the bottom of the can.
4. Sketch in more ellipses for the top and bottom ribs, and then draw the
ones in between.
This step allows you to evenly space the remainder of the ribs. Keep
your hand steady and try to mimic the ellipses that you drew for the top
and bottom of the can.
Draw the entire ellipse even though you see only the forward edge in the
finished painting. When you fill in the other ellipses, they’ll look stacked.
This creates the ribs of the can.
5. As always, continually assess your work; take a moment to check that
the verticals are nice and straight.
They should be parallel with the sides of the canvas. Use your paint-
brush handle for sighting and your viewfinder to help you focus and
check the forms in your painting.
6. Sketch in a horizontal line across the top ellipse to make sure that it’s
level.
7. Divide the ellipses by sketching in a vertical line through the center
of your can.
Is your ellipse symmetrical? Making the corrections now is easy; doing it
now rather than later saves you tons of time.

Finding the patches of color
So, what color is steel? When you look at the can, you see gray, but you also
see the reflection of other colors. Look at the shapes and patterns of the
different values and colors in the can. Try to see it as a paint-by-number painting
where you have larger shapes of color that break down into smaller shapes.
In the tin can, you also see bands of colors that move around its contour 
(as shown in Figure 9-2).
Don’t forget the process. Even though the focus of this project is painting a metal
can, you don’t want to abandon the normal process of painting; don’t focus
solely on painting the can. As the rhythm of the painting develops, you paint
the main subject, your can, and then work on the other areas of the painting. 
The whole painting should come up at the same time, in layers (see Chapter 5).
1. Apply the colors that you see in a thin wash.
Look at the example again. Notice how the light and dark on the ribs
creates a series of dashes? Across the ribs of the can, they stack up like
bricks. Does your can have a similar pattern?
2. Paint the patterns that you see on your can as patches of color —
don’t blend anything.
Painting metal is about painting patterns. Painting without blending is
what makes metal look like metal.

Part III: People, Places, and Things 

3. As you paint, look at the can and examine the reflections that you see
on its surface.
Take a moment to try to locate what’s being reflected. It could be a light
from a window, the cloth the can is sitting on, or even you! Knowing
what’s reflected helps you identify the colors that you see on the can.
4. Add the reflection in the dashes along the ribs and be sure to match
the color to its nearby source.
5. After you lay in the basic colors and values of the surrounding area of
the still life, stop to assess your work, making corrections and continu-
ing to develop the patterns by using the colors that you see and
adding them in spots and patches.
If you continue to shift your attention back and forth from the subject to
the background, you also allow the paint to dry a bit. That makes it
easier to work with the paint if you have a really wet painting.
Ending the first session
After you have all the colors blocked in and you have a couple of layers of
paint on the canvas, you’ve arrived at a stopping point. You can set the canvas
aside to dry a little before you continue. You can tell when you reach this
point because you have a good, solid drawing, the colors are all blocked in,
and you have a good coat of thin paint on all parts of the canvas. You can
start to work on it again the following day or two days later.
When you come back, the paint will still be wet but it won’t be as greasy and
messy to work with. Some parts of the painting may feel completely dry while
others have started to develop a tacky surface. They’ll be wet again as soon
as you add more paint. That allows you to blend and mix your colors right on
the canvas.
Working with a painting medium
From this point on in this painting, you must use a painting medium rather
than solvent as your wetting solution for your brushes and paint. A painting
medium is a mixture of linseed oil and other liquids that allows the painting to
dry properly. Whenever you spend more than one session on a painting, 
you must switch to using a painting medium rather than straight solvent.
A painting medium adds back in a little of the linseed oil that the solvent
dissolves out. Using a painting medium allows you to paint with fluid strokes
and to blend, but most importantly, it slows the drying time of your painting.
If an oil painting dries too quickly, it damages the layers of paint, causing the
painting’s surface to crack. This process is called working fat over lean. You
can find more information on this topic in Chapter 2.
115
Chapter 9: Tricky Still Life Subjects Made Easy

You can either make your own medium using linseed oil and Gamsol or
Turpenoid, or you can use a commercially prepared painting medium. If 
you make your medium, a 50/50 mixture of Gamsol and linseed oil is fine. 
If you buy a commercially prepared medium, just get a regular painting
medium, not “fast drying,” or “slow drying,” or anything fancy.
Use the painting medium to wet your brush as you work. The medium makes
your paint fluid and creamy. It’s very different from working with plain sol-
vent, which can make your paint runny and drippy. The oil in the medium
also helps to remoisten the previous layers, which allows the new layers to
bond with the previous layers.
The second session
When you return to work on the painting, continue to apply paint to the
canvas, gradually building up the layers.
1. Try to work with patches of color as you did before, developing and
refining the patterns of values and colors as you work.
2. Keep blending to a minimum so that you can maintain clear edges and
convincing reflections.
If you have an area that needs a blend, as in our example on the tin can’s
metal rim (see Figure 9-2), experiment with blending in a finite area to
get the hang of using the medium.
3. Continue to apply a new layer of paint to all parts of the canvas,
developing the image as you go.
4. Build up the layers of paint by applying your brushstrokes in one
direction and then the other, crisscrossing each other.
If you have an area where it just doesn’t seem like you can get the paint
to cover the canvas, you may be using a transparent color. Ultramarine
blue and alizarin crimson are transparent. If you’re using either of these
or any of the other transparent colors, you have to mix the color with
something opaque to make it cover well. White is an obvious choice, but
other colors are opaque as well. In our example, the blue boxes are ultra-
marine blue, which is a transparent color. By adding titanium white and
cerulean blue, the problem is solved. See the section on oil pigments in
Chapter 2 for a complete list of transparent colors.
Finishing off
The last bits you add to finish off the painting are the glints of light on the
surface of the can. These glints are white and may stand up pinpoint-like from
the metal. To create these glints, take up a little dab of white with a small dry
brush with no solvent on it at all. Applying glints feels more like putting the
icing on a cupcake than stroking on paint. Just touch the brush to the point
you need and leave it alone. You can see the finished work in Figure 9-3.

Part III: People, Places, and Things 

Glass: Transparent, Reflective, Difficult
If you look at a glass, whether clear or color, it seems impossible to know
where to start. It’s transparent, but it bends and distorts the things you see
through it. It catches the light and reflects it back to you with intensity, but it
can also include dark spots where the glass is dense. Sometimes, you see a
line, an edge along the side of the glass, and sometimes the edge just seems
to disappear. You can also pick up reflections on the surface of the glass from
objects in the room. The glint of light you see on the bottle is a light fixture in
the ceiling or a window. Look closely and you see a reflection of yourself in it,
too! It’s like a crystal ball capturing the world in miniature.
For this project, start the way you do with the tin can project earlier in this
chapter, with a relatively small canvas and a simple setup. You may want to
limit the painting to just the glass item. Call it a study and give yourself the
space to make it a practice piece.
But what piece of glass should you paint? Some of our favorite objects for
this project are wine bottles, with the labels removed, and glass vases. A
drinking glass also works for this project; a plain glass, without any pattern
or decoration, like a juice glass in a restaurant, is best. A clear glass is okay,
but glass with color is better.

Chapter 9: Tricky Still Life Subjects Made Easy

Project: Painting Glass
This painting is a single green or blue wine bottle or plain vase with no orna-
mentation. We used a green wine bottle for our example.
Take a minute to look at the glass, really look. Look at the shapes of the colors
you see in glass — they’re like amoebas of color. Jump forward and look at the
example in Figure 9-6. Find the shapes in the glass: the dips, swirls, and liquid
freeform shapes. Those shapes are what make glass look like glass.
Start this painting as you do the painting of the tin can earlier in this chapter.
The object that you’re working from — a glass, a bottle, or a vase — is likely a
cylinder, so you have a chance to work on your ellipses again. (If you skipped
the tin can project, flip back to it and read about drawing your object.)
Sketch it in with a wash, check it, and make corrections as needed. See Figure
9-4 for the drawing of our wine bottle. Then follow these steps:
1. After you have the bottle and other parts of the still life drawn in, find
the three largest shapes in the glass and draw them in.
They’re freeform shapes and they probably look rather goofy. Sketch in
only the largest shapes at this time.
As you establish the major shapes in your bottle, try to identify the
sources of the reflections that you see. For example, if you see the reflec-
tion of a window in your bottle, notice how the shape of the window is
distorted by the glass.

118
Part III: People, Places, and Things 

When painting glass objects, draw and paint the objects from as close to
the same point of view as possible. Every time you move, the shapes of
the reflections in your objects change, sometimes dramatically. If you
maintain the same viewpoint, the shapes are easier to capture.
2. Mix washes for the color of the glass bottle and the other parts of your
setup and apply the colors to each area as we did in Figure 9-5.
Here are some tips to help you with this step:
• Concentrate on the largest shapes and ignore the small bits for
now.
• Some areas inside the bottle are a mix of both the color of the
bottle and the color from behind the bottle. Make up these colors
and apply them as you see them.
• Save the highlights (the reflections from light sources on the bottle)
for last.
3. After you block in the major shapes in the bottle, find the medium
shapes and then the smallest shapes and block them in.
4. Continue to develop the other parts of the canvas so that you have a
consistent surface over the whole painting.
5. At this stage you may need to let the painting rest overnight or for a
day or two.

Chapter 9: Tricky Still Life Subjects Made Easy

6. When you start again, use the painting medium to go back and refine
the application of color to the glass (see “Project: A Tin Can” for
details on painting mediums).
For the second (or third) session with the painting, you can apply a
relatively thick application of paint to make your bottle look more fluid
and more glass-like.
7. Find the highlights and apply them with tiny points of white paint (see
the points on Figure 9-6 at the base of the neck of the bottle).
In our example, you can also see a more-subtle highlight. The big patch
of light on the right side of the bottle is the reflection of a window.
8. Complete the painting by developing all areas of the painting to the
same degree.

Organic Shapes: The Life 
That Surrounds You
Making lifelike plants, trees, and flowers is a goal for many beginning artists —
most are fascinated by the beauty and variety of natural forms. For centuries,
artists have strived to create an image of nature as a symbol of the ideal. You
can start by practicing with individual examples of nature in your studio. 
Up to this point, you’ve worked with geometric forms. But nature is made up
of organic shapes, things that are freeform and follow their own symmetry.
These natural forms are also perfect for your first experiments at working
expressively in painting.
You may already have good drawing skills and feel confident in your ability to
draw flowers and other natural forms. If not, here are a few steps that you
may want to take to prepare for your painting:
1. Carefully select the items that you’ll paint from.
Painting a plant with lots of leaves can be daunting. Start with a small
houseplant. An artificial plant or flower is a good choice. It won’t wilt
under a spotlight, and you can bend it into the shape that you like.
2. Practice drawing the item first.
One way to get the hang of making organic shapes is to trace the shadow
of the flowers and leaves. Put a bright light on the plant and place it
close to a wall. Put a piece of paper on the wall and trace the shadow.
Notice how the leaves, stems, and flower shapes overlap one another.
This is the shape you’ll draw for your painting.
3. Set your plant up against a wall so that it casts a shadow that you can
draw.
See our painting up ahead in Figure 9-9. The shape of the shadow mimics
the shape of the flower and leaves.
Project: Painting a Natural Form
For this project, we recommend painting a silk flower in a small bottle. Pin a
sheet to the wall and put a strong light on it to create interesting shadows.
Take a look at our example in Figure 9-7.
121
Chapter 9: Tricky Still Life Subjects Made Easy

Procedure
You work on this project the same way you do the others in this chapter.
Start with the drawing, block in the colors, and finally refine the painting. Be
sure to take time to set up your items and light them well. Experiment with
this stage to get just the right scene, and then follow these steps:
1. Sketch your setup on paper.
This step gives you a chance to try out the composition, including the
orientation of the canvas (either vertical or horizontal), and to see
whether you need any extra items to augment your setup. An interesting
shadow can balance and stimulate an otherwise simple setup.
2. Sketch in the shape of the flower, leaves, and bottle using a wash of a
light color on your canvas. (We used blue for the example in Figure 9-7.)
The lines for organic objects should be fluid and loose. The shapes of
the shadows imitate the shapes in your objects.
3. Block in the basic colors, using a separate brush for each color so that
the colors remain bright and clear (see Figure 9-8).
As you paint, study and paint the shapes of the patterns of value and
hue that you see. Don’t blend anything at this early stage of the painting.
Figure 9-7:
The drawing
stage for the
lily-in-a-
bottle

122
Part III: People, Places, and Things 

4. After you block in the basic colors and shapes of your objects and their
shadows, fill out the rest of the composition with white and very light
versions of any other colors you see reflected onto your background.
Painting in the negative space, or background, last allows you to correct
any drawing problems that come up while you’re working.
5. Allow your painting to rest before you work back into it.
Read over the following discussion of our example before continuing on
with your own painting.
Examining our example
Of course, the colors in your setup may be a little different from our example
in Figure 9-9. The colors in the Asiatic lily are alizarin crimson and white. We
painted the bottle by using a mix of ultramarine blue and a little Cerulean,
which makes it a more opaque color. The greens were made using all the
tubes and colors in our box.
Green is a great color. Every shade of green in a landscape is different! Tree
leaves aren’t the same color as grass. Grass in May is a different color than
grass in August. If you consult your color chart in Chapter 7, you know that
you can make green with ultramarine blue and cadmium yellow light, but you
can also make green with cerulean blue or with yellow ochre. That gives you
four combinations of very different greens.
Figure 9-8:

123
Chapter 9: Tricky Still Life Subjects Made Easy

Then you have the various hues of green, yellow-green, and blue-green. What
if you use both the yellow ochre and cadmium yellow with one of the blues?
And you haven’t even tried the permanent green light or the viridian yet.
Don’t forget the tones and tints and shades of green. Remember that you can
tone down the green by adding a touch of red or even orange. Sooner or later
you’ll rediscover that yellow and black make a green as well. This can go on
and on. Here’s what you should work on in your painting:
1. Closely examine the leaves in your setup and find the various colors
of green.
You likely have some bright greens that are well lighted. They may have
yellow in them like the buds of the lily in our example. You also have
some medium greens, like the leaves. These greens could have a little bit
of white in them where the light hits the leaf. You also have some darker
greens. You see these greens on the underside of the leaves, or maybe
they’re the actual colors of the leaves.
2. Experiment by using more ultramarine blue or viridian green, if you
have it, to make the dark areas.
Don’t blend these colors in your painting; apply them in a blocky fash-
ion. Now move on to the rest of the canvas.
In our example, we used blue-gray for the shadow on the wall of the flower
and bottle. We made the color with cerulean blue, cadmium red light, and
white. We drew the shadow for the flower and filled it in with the wash of
gray. We covered the background with white, which allows the opportunity to
cover up any mistakes made in the drawing of the shadow. At that point the
painting was pretty wet, and it needed to dry a bit before we continued on it.
Cover the entire canvas with paint, even if you’re painting white oil paint over
the top of your white canvas. The canvas has been covered with a priming
coat of gesso. The gesso turns yellow over time if it’s exposed to light and air.
So always be sure to put paint everywhere on your canvas.
The next day, the paint in our example still wasn’t dry, but it was much easier
to work with. We mixed a painting medium — a 50/50 mixture of Gamsol and
linseed oil — to continue the painting. Some areas of the painting looked very
good with the loose brushwork and some areas needed adjusting.
The petals of the lily were only one color of pink and needed more variety, so
we added a touch of ultramarine blue to make the shadows that fall across the
petals. The pink of the petals looked a bit dull because it was a combination of
alizarin and white. Sometimes putting two colors together gets you unexpected
results! Some colors dull down very quickly when you add white to them. You
get the value that you want, but not the intensity of the color. We corrected this
problem by making a glaze of alizarin and adding it to the petals to brighten the
color. To make a glaze, you simply mix a tiny amount of the color you want with
the painting medium. In this case, it was easy to do because alizarin is a trans-
parent color anyway. You can find more details about glazing in Chapter 8.
The cast shadow had too many different versions of gray, so we simplified
and lightened it. The blue bottle was made almost entirely of ultramarine
blue. The cerulean blue didn’t match the color of the bottle. We applied an
124
Part III: People, Places, and Things 

ultramarine blue glaze, and the result was a clear color that also looked fluid.
We blended the edges of the cast shadow slightly to make them appear fuzzier.
That allowed the bottle and the lily to be the main focal point of the painting.
Getting back to your painting
Now that you know the history of our example, you can apply some of the
strategies to your own work and complete the painting. You can see our com-
pleted work in Figure 9-9.
1. Mix up a painting medium that’s one part Gamsol and one part lin-
seed oil, and use it as your new wetting solution for your paint and
brushes.
2. Work back into your objects, developing and refining their patterns
and colors.
Be sure to continue to look very closely at your setup and incorporate
what you’re seeing into the work. Becoming involved in the painting
without looking at what you’re painting is easy to do and can lead to
mistakes.
3. As you work into the background, look closely for the nuances of
color that may be reflected onto the backdrop.
4. Check the brilliance of the colors and make glazes for areas that need
them.
5. Find your areas of highlight and lay them in (check out “Project: A Tin
Can” for more on highlights).

Chapter 9: Tricky Still Life Subjects Made Easy

Working Expressively
Expressionism is a term that many are familiar with even before studying art.
It’s a big term that encompasses many types of art from many parts of the
world. To define it in concise terms for painting, expressionism is a way of
working that allows the artists to depict their responses to things instead of
showing only a visual description.
So the emphasis is on how the artist feels about the subject and not just on
what the objects look like. An artist can show how he or she feels about some-
thing through the handling of the paint itself or by distorting the forms in the
painting. Other characteristics in expressionist paintings are exaggerated
brushstrokes and heightened color. Here are some examples of distortion:
 Color can be distorted by using exaggerated color or a substitution of
another color. (Example: Yellow sky and red trees in a landscape.)
 Distortion of form changes the shape of an object. Form can be distorted
by exaggerating the scale or by stretching the form.
 Materials can be distorted by using thick paint strokes, or by scratching
into the paint.
The overall goal is to make an emotional impact on the viewer. Some well-
known examples of expressionism in painting are Van Gogh’s Starry Night and
Edvard Munch’s The Scream.
Expressionism doesn’t mean that just anything goes. It isn’t an excuse for
self-indulgence. For expressive art to be successful, it needs to heed the same
criteria for success in other artworks. That means a harmonious combination
of color, value, form, space, and so forth.
This topic can quickly become a subjective argument. One way to think of
expressive art is to ask yourself how well it connects with the viewer. If the
viewer finds something to admire in the work — the idea behind the work,
the expressive use of color or brushstrokes, or the subject matter depicted,
for example — then the work is successful.
You may find that working expressively with your paintings is something that
connects with you personally. But art doesn’t have to be expressive to be
good. The flipside of expressionism is formalism, and that may describe your
working methods more closely. Sometimes artists work in a blend of these
two approaches. We have examples of both types of artists in Chapter 19.
126
Part III: People, Places, and Things 

Project: Experiment with Expressionism
For this experiment with expressionism, find a subject that you feel comfortable
with. It can be something that you’ve painted before, but in any case it should
be manageable. It can be another setup of organic shapes — even exactly the
same thing that you paint in “Project: Painting a Natural Form” earlier in this
chapter. Rearrange the lighting and the backdrop to give it a fresh look.
We use five wine bottles in this example. (Jump ahead to Figure 9-12 to see
the completed work.) We have a variety of shapes and colors, and they’re fun
to work with (all those ellipses!). You need all the standard supplies for this
project, including your painting medium. Our example is done on canvas
paper taped down to a Masonite board.
You’re going to make three drawings of your setup, one on top of the other,
right on your canvas. Make each drawing in a different color.
1. Start the first drawing by using a wash of an unexpected color.
In our example in Figure 9-10, we used cadmium red light for the first
drawing. The red contrasts with the dark glass of the wine bottles, and it
sets the tone for a bright painting. We drew ellipses for the bases, the
shoulders of the bottles, and the mouths. We drew centerlines for each
bottle and sketched in the edges.
2. Use a second color for the second drawing, making corrections as you go.
We used ultramarine blue over the top of the first drawing. We made cor-
rections and added the pattern of the shadows and the edges of the
table that the bottles are sitting on.
As you draw your own painting, hold your brush loosely, back from the
tip so that you have less control. Draw over this image, going outside
the lines and through the image each time. You can also exaggerate the
forms and distort them.
3. Choose a third color and make your last drawing.
We did the last drawing in permanent green light. We drew the bottles in
the example so that they’re taller than they actually are. This sets the
stage for something that’s experimental and loose.
The position of the bottles changed a bit as they we drew them, but we
left the red of the first drawing on the canvas. Leaving some of the color
from the drawing adds a random, expressive effect.
127
Chapter 9: Tricky Still Life Subjects Made Easy

4. Block in the forms with a wash of color.
We painted each section of the bottles a slightly different color in Figure
9-11. With each color, we painted up to, but not over, the lines in the
drawings. We blocked in colors for the background, the table, and the
cast shadows. These colors are brighter than what was actually there.
5. Adapt the colors and shapes to fit the demands of the composition.
Be flexible while you work. You may find that your original plan is too
conservative to be called expressionistic.
6. Complete the painting by applying successively heavier layers of
paint.
If you like the lines from the drawing stage and they start to disappear,
draw over the top of them again. If it gets too wet to keep your colors
clear, let it rest and go back to it another day. As always, apply the later
layers of paint with a painting medium, not just the solvent.

happy with the results. Our completed work is shown in Figure 9-12.

N
othing evokes the romance of painting like setting up an easel in a beau-
tiful locale and putting a brush to canvas. If that’s your entire motivation
for taking up painting, it’s a good one. It can be one of the most rewarding of
the painting genres. What beats going outside on a beautiful day and losing
yourself in a landscape painting?
This chapter helps you make the transition from working in the studio to
painting the natural environment. We provide you with the tools to deal with
its special challenges and look at ways you can bring the outside back into
your studio for longer projects. At the end of the chapter, we give you step-
by-step directions for painting your own one-day landscape painting.
The Nuts and Bolts of Painting Outdoors
You have to think about the same sorts of things when you paint outdoors as
you do when you paint in the studio. Painting outdoors does have some special
challenges, however. Thinking ahead so that you have what you need on-site
and setting up so that you’re comfortable are primary concerns. Dealing with
changing conditions and subject matter of which you have little experience
are others. With a little thought, patience, and perseverance, however, you
can experience thoroughly satisfying painting sessions.
How working outdoors is different
from working in the studio
When you paint in your studio, you have a relatively controlled environment
with comfortable furniture and all your supplies nearby. You can set up some-
thing to paint and light it however you want to. You can shut the door if you
want privacy. You have snacks and drinks in the fridge.

Painting outside can be inspiring, relaxing, engaging — you name it. You can set
up in the shade of a tree and spend hours absorbed in painting and enjoying
the environment. Life is rarely better for a landscape painter.
It can also be hot and sweaty, buggy, and physically demanding. You can
forget your brushes or other critical materials. People can look over your
shoulder. You can get hungry and thirsty, or worst of all, you may have to go
to the bathroom when none is nearby. Your back can hurt, and, to add further
insult, a sudden shower can soak you.
All these problems can be overcome, though. Painting outside can be one of
your most rewarding experiences, but you must plan ahead.
Painting scenery outdoors from direct observation is called plein air painting.
En plein air is a French term that means “in open air.” Even though artists had
always made paintings of outdoor scenes, it was the Impressionists in the
latter half of the 19th century who popularized painting outside the studio.
Deciding where you’re going
Take a little time to prepare for your outing and it will be much more
successful. Have an area in mind before you head out so that you can
prepare. Consider these criteria as you select a spot:
 Does it have an interesting landscape or area to paint? It doesn’t have
to be Yellowstone National Park, but it should have potential for a great
painting.
 Is it public or private? If it’s private, be sure to ask for permission to
work on the owner’s property. Also, have a good idea of what the property
is used for. If you accidentally wander onto a shooting range, you could
have some real problems! Here are some good possibilities for public
areas to paint: parks, trails, nature reserves, cemeteries, museum
grounds, riverbanks, scenic rest stops, and beaches.
 What kinds of accommodations are available? Are food and water
available? Is a restroom within a reasonable distance? (Bushes 
don’t count.)
 Does the area have seating that you can use? If picnic tables are
available, you can set up a makeshift easel on them; otherwise, you have
to consider other options.
 If a companion who doesn’t paint is coming with you, will he or she
have something to do while you’re working? You’re there to work, not
to entertain someone else. Consider this your time and make sure that
your companion can respect that.
Deciding what to take
Unless you’re going to paint in your backyard, you have to do a little more
than throw some things in a bag and take off to paint. The obvious things that
132
Part III: People, Places, and Things 

you need are your paints, brushes, equipment, and something to paint on,
but you need to consider a few other things, especially for painting outdoors.
An easel and stool — or not
Much like your initial investment in painting, you can invest as little or as
much as you want to in pursuing this genre. Packing everything you need in a
canvas bag is possible, and you may do fine working on a picnic table. Or you
can lay out $100 to $200 for a field easel with storage for your paints and
palette and a stool. If you want to paint outdoors regularly, investing in a field
easel and stool may be worthwhile. Here are some ways to set up an on-site
work area with items you already may have available:
 Set up on a picnic table. Prop your canvas or board against your art
box. Stand or sit to paint. You have a ready-made work area.
 Sit on a blanket spread out on the ground and prop your canvas
against your art box or a tree. The ground can be hard, but if you were
ever associated with a Girl Scout, you know what to do: make a “sit-
upon.” Take a few sections of newspaper, stack them neatly, and tuck
them into a trash bag. Fold the bag around the newspapers and duct
tape it in place. Voilà! A seating pad. (We won’t make you decorate it.)
 If you can park your car nearby, you can bring any transportable
easel and a lawn chair.
 Try tailgating if you have a vehicle with a tailgate. Artists have a long
tradition of pulling over to the side of the road and painting as they sit in
their cars. Open the doors for a nice breeze and you’re in business. (Be
sure to turn off the interior light so that you don’t run down your battery.)
If you get a shallow metal butcher’s tray (available at art supply stores)
or even a shoebox to hold your solvent jar and other potentially messy
items, you won’t get paint or solvent on your seats. Throw a tarp or
sheet over them to avoid inadvertent drips.
A painting surface
Any painting surface is possible, but some are easier to handle in the field
than others. These are our recommendations:
 Canvas paper. If you tape canvas paper by the corners to the backside
of a drawing board, you can carry it around easily by its handle. It props
up well against your tackle box for a comfortable work surface. You have
to paint the corners under the tape after you return home.
 Canvas board and other prepared boards. Bring newspaper to put
under the bottom edge of the painting so that you don’t get paint on
other surfaces. Leave a small section on a corner unpainted so that you
can carry it back to the car without damaging it.
 Pre-stretched canvas. You can carry it securely by the stretcher bar and
prop it against your tackle box easily. You can paint to the edges of the
canvas.
133
Chapter 10: Take It Outside: Landscapes

The rest of your supplies
Here’s the rest of the stuff you need:
 Paints. Because of the variation of greens in the environment, you may
enjoy picking up a tube of permanent green light at the art supply store.
It gives you a brighter set of greens to fill out the range of greens you
can mix with your other colors. For browns, good choices are raw
umber, burnt umber, and burnt sienna.
 Solvent. Pour about an inch of solvent into a small jar with a tightly fitting
lid. A short, wide jar is best because it won’t turn over.
 Palette. Bring an unbreakable palette or a disposable palette and cover
any paint you want to bring back with foil. Dispose of unwanted paint
properly.
 Brushes and a container to hold them.
 Sketchbook and charcoal pencils. Use your sketchbook to make thumb-
nails, but also use it to record information that you may need to con-
tinue painting when you go home.
 Other supplies. Some of the following aren’t the first things that may
come to mind when preparing for an outdoor painting session, but
they’ll probably come in handy:
• Paper towels
• Barrier cream for your hands
• Tackle box and canvas bag
• Suntan lotion
• Lip protection
• Mosquito repellent
• Spray bottle of water
• Snacks and water or other drinks
• Trash bag
• Foil
 Optional stuff. You may also need plastic sheeting, a poncho, or trash
bags in case of rain. If you want to be reached, carry a cellphone. And if
you want to keep the sun off your head, wear a hat.
Working comfortably and safely
Taking care of your health when you go out on these outings is important.
Follow these tips to stay safe and comfortable:
 Be sure to put on suntan lotion and reapply it during the day.
 Wear mosquito repellent if the little critters are around to make you
miserable.
134
Part III: People, Places, and Things 

 Apply barrier cream to your hands.
 Consider wearing a wide-brimmed hat or a bill to shade your face and
your eyes. Sunglasses are an option, but they affect the way you see
light and color.
 Check the weather. If you see a chance of rain, bring something to cover
you and your work area in case of sudden showers.
 Cool yourself off by misting yourself with water from your spray bottle.
 Bring a snack or lunch and drinks if you’re going to be out for several hours.
Your safety is also important. People who paint outdoors are magnets for
people who are curious. Treating everyone with suspicion isn’t necessary.
Just keep your radar up, and if something seems like it isn’t right, it probably
isn’t. Here are some suggestions for taking care of your personal safety:
 If you’re going out alone, tell someone where you’re going and approxi-
mately when you’ll return.
 Get a painting buddy, take someone with you, or join an outdoor
painters group.
 Try to paint in populated areas. If you’re isolated, be aware of your sur-
roundings and the people approaching you. Don’t attract attention to
yourself.
 Bring only what you need in terms of money, credit cards, and 
identification.
 If you have a cellphone, juice up the battery before you go and keep the
phone within easy reach. Take it out and put it in an inconspicuous place
next to you.
Protecting the environment
Do your part to protect the groundwater by taking your discarded paint and
solvent with you and recycling it or disposing of it properly.
Under no circumstances should you pour solvent out on the ground.
You’re someone’s guest everywhere you go to paint. Be considerate. Don’t
leave trash behind. Don’t steal their stuff. (If it’s on their land, it’s their stuff.)
Setting up your work area
Just as you do at home, set up so that you have a clear view of your subject
matter and have to move only your eyes to see your scene as you paint. Make
sure that you have a spot where you have a clear view of the scene you want
to paint.
135
Chapter 10: Take It Outside: Landscapes

Look under the “An easel and stool — or not” section in this chapter for ways
that you can set up your painting surface. Arrange the rest of your space
around that.
Consider whether you want to set up your space in the sun or shade. Even
shade is best. Dappled shade on your painting can be very distracting. The
sun does move, so you may set up in a great shady spot and find yourself in
full sun an hour later. Try to predict the path of the sun and set up 
accordingly.
Transporting your work
You can find products that are designed to protect your work while you carry
it. Some field easels and backpacks have built-in carrying devices, while
other devices allow you to carry stretched canvases independently.
Prepare a place in your car for your wet canvas before you set off to paint.
Ideally, you should lay it flat so that it’s well supported and unlikely to slide,
fall, or tip. So clean out the trunk, fold down the backseat, or otherwise make
room. Don’t lay your canvas on objects that are likely to poke into it from the
back. Don’t lean it against the backseat of your car, because it can tip or slide
if you brake suddenly.
When you arrive home, immediately put your painting in a safe place to dry.
Developing a Strategy for Painting
Outdoor Scenes
You want to have a strategy for painting when you arrive at your site. You can
choose from several possibilities, including the following:
 Make sketches or paint the scenes as single-session paintings. Sketches
and single-session paintings are the best way to start when you’re working
with a new subject.
 Paint longer multi-session paintings.
 Take photographs, make sketches in the field, and bring them back to
the studio for longer painting projects.
 Do a mix of blending your outdoor work with your studio work.
Painting on-site is working from observation, which is always the most desir-
able way to work. It isn’t always possible, though. If you’re on vacation or had
to travel some distance to the spot, painting on-site over several sessions can
136
Part III: People, Places, and Things 

be a luxury or impossibility. In that case, the more information you can collect
while you’re there, the more you have to work with when you get back to the
studio.
Gathering the information you 
need to work from later
When you plan to work on a painting away from the site, you need to collect
as much information as possible. It may seem that taking a few photographs
of the area is all you need, but photographs have limitations. Cameras don’t
focus on the subject matter the way your eyes do, so what you see isn’t
necessarily what you get in the photograph.
Cameras are excellent tools, but you need to complement photographs with
other material. Here’s a list of information you can collect that will support
your painting:
 Photograph the scene from the same point of view as your painting. Try
to match the scene of the painting as closely as possible.
 Make additional detail photographs of objects.
 Make a sketch of the entire scene and write notes about vegetation,
lighting, colors, and anything else that will remind you of the scene. (See
Figure 10-1 for an example of how you can incorporate information into
your drawing.)
 Make color swatches or spots of color that are close to the colors you’re
observing. Most people’s memories of color are notoriously bad.
 Make a sketch of anything that you think will cause you trouble in the
studio. That way you can work out the problems while you have the
scene in front of you.
 If you plan to work solely from photographs, you need one good photo-
graph that can serve as a master for your scene. You should still take
supplementary photographs and make sketches and notes as we discuss
throughout this list so that you have plenty of material to cover what
you can’t see in your master photograph.
The visual material you collect to work from as you make your painting is
called reference material.
137
Chapter 10: Take It Outside: Landscapes

Finishing in the studio
If you plan to finish your painting in the studio, you should work back into it
within the next few days. The scene will still be still fresh in your mind and
you’ll still have some enthusiasm for it.
The first things you want to do when you come back to it are set up the painting
and assess what you’ve done. Some areas will be quite good while other areas
will still need to be resolved. Don’t assume that the whole thing needs a layer
of paint.
Lay out the reference material you brought back with you so that you can see
it while you paint. Refer to it as you make a plan to resolve the areas that still
need work. Usually, it’s best to work on your worst problem first.
Don’t try to copy the photographs; you’re using them only for information to
complete what you’ve already done. Paint those areas the same way you
painted the areas from observation.
Painting from photographs
Even if you don’t plan to do any painting on-site, you should still do some
sketching from observation there. It provides a good foundation for your
painting and allows you to work out any potential problems before you start.
It also allows you to bring the experience of being there to the painting. You
can’t get that by working only from photographs.
Figure 10-1:
Make a
working
sketch with
notes to
work from
later.
138
Part III: People, Places, and Things 

Rather than trying to copy the photograph, try to think of it as a starting
point for your painting that provides a general composition, value pattern,
and color palette that you can build on. Your painting will be your own inter-
pretation of the photograph. (In the painting in Figure 10-2, the artist began by
referring to a photograph but then moved away from the photo to develop
and complete the painting.)
Put all your reference material out where you can see it the entire time that
you’re painting. It will inspire you, but you’re also more likely to use it if it’s out.
Finding a Subject
When you arrive at your locale with your equipment, what are you going to
paint? If you have the luxury of time, a scouting trip minus your equipment is
a good idea. Otherwise, narrow the general area down to a spot with good
potential and use your viewfinder to find the scene you want to paint.
When you first look for areas to paint, focus on the colors and value patterns
rather than a specific kind of subject matter. Some beginning artists go out
looking for a quaint landscape scene to paint. If you do, you may be looking
for a very long time. For now, concentrate on scenes that will help you
develop your painting skills rather than finding the perfect landscape.
Figure 10-2:
Paint your
own
interpre-
tation of the

139
Chapter 10: Take It Outside: Landscapes

Here are some other characteristics to look for:
 A mix of large, broad fields and clusters of trees and bushes
 A variety of light and dark greens and blues
 A mix of different kinds of leaf textures
For now, avoid painting leafless trees. They require too much detailed work
at the expense of the rest of your painting. Stick with leafy trees that have
interesting shapes.
Painting Your Landscape
When you find a spot, you’re ready to set up to paint. Start by drawing in the
major shapes with your thinned paint. (Refer to Chapter 5 for information
about laying in your drawing.) As you work, avoid drawing the individual
leaves of trees and bushes. Instead, draw the overall shapes of the trees and
bushes without details.
Next, start to lay in the colors of the major shapes, working general to spe-
cific, and paying special attention to the value pattern. As you build each suc-
ceeding layer of paint, refine and define the shapes until the painting is
finished.
Dealing with light and time
When you paint the vegetation in a landscape, you notice that everything has a
dark side and a light side. The light side, obviously, is lit by your light source —
the sun. While you paint, look for the patterns of light and shade that the sun
creates, and paint the shapes of patterns in these areas rather than trying to
paint individual leaves.
140
Part III: People, Places, and Things 
Take a page from Monet
Claude Monet was an Impressionist whose paint-
ings of his garden are well known. Capturing color
and light was the goal of Impressionism, so many
of Monet’s paintings are flooded with light and
sparkle with color.
Monet was interested in capturing a variety of 
different kinds of light and would paint the same
subjects at different times of day and in every
season. His Haystack series is particularly inter-
esting. He painted a single haystack in a field in
every season — even in the dead of winter — and
he painted it in every kind of light that you can
imagine. When you see several of them together
on a wall, you notice that they all have nearly iden-
tical compositions, but some are cool in color,
while others are warm. Some have strong light and
contrast, while others have the similarities of value
that you see at twilight. They’re simple, beautiful,
and remarkable in the use of color.
From Monet you can learn to make simple compo-
sitions and revisit them as many times as you like.
Your goals for each can be different and you can
learn something new with every experience.

Observe how light affects the color in your scene. Rather than mixing a dark
green for your patterns of shadows and then adding white to it for the sunlit
light patterns, think about using a range of analogous colors. Use cooler greens
on the dark-shadowed side (or even blue-violet in the deepest, darkest shadows)
and a range of warmer greens on the light side. Also, consider using shades,
darker tones, or even tints of an area’s local color when a shadow is cast upon
it. For example, a shadow cast across a green lawn may be painted with a green
shade mottled with green tones and tints, and variations of other analogous
colors. (Check out Figure 10-3 to see how the shadow is shades and tones of
green when it falls on grass but changes to violets as it crosses a path.) Read
Chapter 17 for more information on color.
Light and time present special challenges in landscape painting. In the studio,
the lighting is fixed. Outdoors, the lighting changes as the sun moves across the
sky. That means that the drawings of your trees and bushes remain constant, but
their light areas and the shadows that they cast are undergoing constant change.
You can deal with this challenge by creating a set drawing for your painting
and quickly laying in the shadowed areas that you want to remain dark. While
you paint and the shapes of the shadows change, refer to the characteristics
of the colors in the current light and shadowed areas to paint the areas that
have changed from their original shape. Keep the shapes of the objects and
shadows in your painting the same as you paint, but refer to the landscape
for the kinds of colors to use. Keep in mind that you’ll see some subtle differ-
ences throughout the day. Sunlight in the morning and evening is a warmer
color than sunlight at noon, so noontime colors are more true to the actual
color of the object.

colors.

Chapter 10: Take It Outside: Landscapes

Depicting distance
Creating deep space is one of the special challenges of painting outdoors.
This is where you put your knowledge of atmospheric perspective to work. A
few tips to remember:
 In the areas that are closest to you, paint strong lights and darks,
brighter colors, and more detail.
 To depict areas that are farther away, drop your darkest and lightest
colors so that you work only with a range of middle values of light and
dark. Blur the edges and details for areas that are farther away.
In Figure 10-4 you can see the change in colors as they move toward the hori-
zon line. They become duller and change value. When the objects are added,
you can see how the values of the objects in the distance are similar to the value
of their backgrounds. When the objects are closer, you have more contrast.
Refer to the discussions of atmospheric perspective in Chapters 16 and 17 for
more in-depth information.
Painting buildings and people
Buildings and people may seem to be special challenges, but they don’t need
to be. Applying what you know from doing still life painting can be helpful in
each.
When painting buildings and people, forget what they are and break them
down into simple forms. Refine them more if they’re closer in the scene and
less if they’re farther away.

142
Part III: People, Places, and Things 

The buildings in your landscape
To ensure that your buildings look right, do these things:
 Make sure the perspective is right.
Just check these three things:
• The building is placed correctly in relation to your eye level.
• The lines for the sides of the building seem to converge on that line.
• The verticals are plumb.
 Check your lighting. Did you light the building on the same side as the
light from the sun? Is the other side darker? Do you have a different value
of color on every plane of your building? (Figure 10-5 shows how the
values and the intensities of colors change on each side of a building.)
 Simplify your shapes. Don’t try to put more detail in the building than
you can actually see in person. Just because you know it’s there doesn’t
mean that you have to put it in. Too much detail can make your building
inconsistent with its surroundings or reality.
Painting people in the landscape
Unless human figures are seen close-up, keep them simple. This is the time to
simply observe and avoid stressing over what subject you’re painting. Keep
these points in mind:
 Break the figure down into basic shapes and patterns.
 Don’t paint any details that you can’t see from where you’re sitting. That
means that you may paint only a glove shape for a hand. The face may
be a simple pattern of lights and darks.
See Figure 10-6 for examples of how you can refine or limit the refinement to
show figures at different distances.

Every plane

building is a

value.
143
Chapter 10: Take It Outside: Landscapes

Depicting trees and bushes
Trees and bushes (along with clouds and water — discussed later) have no
specific geometry to work with, so they may seem to be more difficult, but
they don’t need to be. You can approach them by analyzing their patterns,
but their textures are different. Vary the sizes and kinds of brushstrokes 
you use.
Drawing trees and bushes
Because trees seem to be so complex, many people tend to generalize them
instead of looking at their real shape and breaking it down into smaller
shapes.
Here’s a good way to draw a tree (see Figure 10-7 for an example):
1. Draw the basic overall shape of the tree.
Don’t start at the trunk and work up the branches. Find its height and
width and shape first.
2. Refine the shape of sections of the tree and the visible lower trunk.
3. Draw the big negative spaces where you can see sky through the tree.
4. Add only the sections of trunk and roots that you can see.
5. Mark the pattern of the shadowed areas of the tree.
Figure 10-6:
Refine the
shapes
more in
figures that
are closer to
you and less
in figures

farther
away.
144
Part III: People, Places, and Things 

These steps make drawing bushes a breeze (Figure 10-8 accompanies this list):
1. Look at the shape of the bush’s silhouette and ask yourself if it’s more
like a circle, triangle, or rectangle.
2. Lightly draw the geometric shape.
3. Refine the geometric shape so that you can see the true shape’s variation.
Think of the geometric shape as a block of marble, and you’re going to
carve away the sections that you don’t need.
4. Mark the pattern of the shadowed area.

a bush.

Chapter 10: Take It Outside: Landscapes

Brushstrokes that work for all those leaves on trees and shrubs
You can use general strategies for most trees and shrubs, but what sets one
apart from another is the type of brushstrokes you use to create the texture
of each. You can use long, linear strokes for tall stands of grasses, for exam-
ple, while you may use short, choppy strokes for evergreen shrubs. At the
same time, you don’t want to immerse yourself in too much detail. Think of
the painting as a collection of textures that becomes softer and more blended
the farther away the objects are.
See Figure 10-9 for examples of strokes that you can use.
Your landscape painting skills will come very easily to you if you keep these
three ideas in front of you at all times: value pattern, texture, and atmos-
pheric perspective.

Capturing water and clouds
Water and clouds can drive everybody a little crazy because they’re in con-
stant motion.
Water
Here are a few tips for tackling water:
 Make sure that any distant water horizon is level and that no water looks
like it’s running uphill.
 Deep areas of water are darker and more violet-blue than shallow areas.
 Reflections are mirror images of objects that look like they’ve been jiggled
and broken up by blue ripples. A simple way to tackle them is to paint the
object mirrored in the water, curve the lines, and add blue ripples (Figure
10-10 shows you this approach). Look closely to see what exists in your
own scene. Sunlight and cast shadows may complicate it. The secret is to
simplify.
 Most large expanses of lake water are choppy and have a variety of light
and dark blues and analogous colors. If you think of them as little waves,
the crests are light and the low areas are darker. Look for lines of little
waves moving toward the shore. Use linear strokes, unless you’re viewing
the water from above and capturing the patterns. If you want to do a
little research, look at Monet’s water scenes for inspiration.

Chapter 10: Take It Outside: Landscapes

Clouds
In a scene in the movie, Girl with a Pearl Earring, the artist Vermeer describes
the colors in a cloud for the maid who cleans his studio. Blues, violets, and
yellows shimmer in the cloud on the screen. Of course, the scene was fictitious,
but you can clearly see the same colors in the clouds in the real Vermeer’s
paintings.
Clouds seem pure white, but they’re made of water vapor, which is the same
stuff that makes the colors in a rainbow. It makes sense that you can see the
entire spectrum in a cloud. Blues and violets make up the shadowed areas of
the clouds, while red-violets, oranges, and yellows appear in the sunlit areas.
You can see several different kinds of clouds, and each kind has a particular
shape associated with it. Look at the clouds in the sky and paint what you
see rather than painting your notion of what a cloud should look like.
Clouds change over a short period of time, so capturing them quickly is
essential. Here are the steps to painting beautiful clouds, and check out
Figure 10-11 for an example:
1. Draw the larger shapes of the cloud and then break down the large
shapes into smaller shapes.
If you have a typical fair-weather cloud, it may be made of large circular
sections surrounded by smaller circular sections.
2. Note whether the cloud has a flat bottom and how much of it you can
see; draw the shape of the bottom of the cloud if you can see it.
A flat bottom is more typical of clouds that are close than clouds that
are distant. You see only straight lines for the bottoms of distant clouds
in cartoons.
3. Draw the shapes of the darker values.
Just like anything else, a cloud is lit on one side by the sun and has
patterns of shadowed areas. The bottom of the cloud is the darkest if
the sun is high in the sky.
4. Fill in the color.
Use grayed blues and blue-violets for the shadowed areas. Use violets
for transitional areas between shadow and light, and use very light oranges
and yellows for lit areas. Save the white for the lightest areas of all.
5. Paint the blue sky so that it defines the edges of your cloud.
Because clouds can be wispy, allow the edges to blur in areas.

Part III: People, Places, and Things 

Regarding seascapes
Much of what we say about landscapes applies to seascapes, but we can say
a few things about differences in approach, dealing with distance, and paint-
ing those frustrating waves.
You can use one of two general approaches to painting seascapes:
 The most common is the combination of land, sea, and sky, which you
can paint as you would any other landscape.
 The second is an atmospheric approach that emphasizes sea and sky,
primarily painted in blues, violets, and greens. These paintings are
simple in composition but rely heavily on sophisticated use of color.
In atmospheric seascapes, you achieve the appearance of distance by using
the rules for atmospheric perspective, but it can be difficult because you
have only the color and texture of the sea and sky to work with. If you have
waves crashing on a beach, you have a little more to work with because you
have a contrast of light and dark and details in the surf. Otherwise, you have
to rely on color and texture to create distance.
Here are some ways to create distance in seascapes:
 The closer the surface is to the viewer, the greater its texture. It
smoothes out as it approaches the horizon.
 The colors of the sea and sky are brighter the closer to the viewer they
are and become grayer as they approach the horizon. This is true
regardless of whether the sun or moon is near the horizon.
Painting waves can be very challenging because they’re always moving, and
they can vary from beach to beach. Of course, you can always take a snapshot,
but if you’re on your own, here’s a process that you can follow:
1. Spend some time relaxing and watching the waves come in.
Don’t try to paint them. Just observe and analyze their shapes, colors,
and movement. You’ll notice that each wave is similar to the ones that
follow.
2. Pick the point of the wave coming in that you want to depict and, as
you watch each wave roll in, take a mental snapshot of what it looks
like at that point.
Some waves are rounded mounds at a distance, becoming peaked as
they approach shore, and finally tumbling over themselves. Others may
be a series of oversized ripples.
3. As you develop your mental picture, start to look for the dark areas in
the wave and details you can use.
4. Now you can begin to paint.
You may be surprised at how easy it is.
149
Chapter 10: Take It Outside: Landscapes

Keep these things in mind as you paint your waves:
 Keep your brushstrokes loose and fluid. You especially want to avoid
making them look stiff and frozen.
 The brushstrokes for ripples and the top sides of the waves should run
generally parallel to the shore. When the wave crests and breaks, run the
brushstrokes in the same direction that the water is moving.
Evaluating your outdoor paintings
For the most part, you evaluate your outdoor paintings the same way you
evaluate your other paintings, but with the goals of landscape painting in
mind. Here’s a checklist that you can use:
 How is the drawing? Do the objects in your landscape look reasonably
realistic?
 Can you see depth or distance in your landscape? Did you treat the
foreground differently than the background?
 Are the colors in your background duller than the colors in your
foreground?
 Are the objects in your foreground more detailed and do they have
sharper edges than the objects in the background?
 Does everything in your painting seem to have the same source of light?
Is everything light on the same side and dark on another side?
 Did you vary your colors by using analogous colors and contrasting
warm and cool colors rather than by adding only white and black?
Project: A One-Day Landscape Project
Gather your stuff and go out to paint! Find a spot, set up your outdoor studio,
and you’re ready for your first plein air experience.
1. Use your viewfinder to find the scene you want to paint.
2. Begin your drawing with a brush and thinned ultramarine blue (see
Figure 10-12).
Refer to Chapter 5 for info about drawing on your canvas. Set your
canvas aside as soon as you’re happy with the drawing.
3. Prepare your palette of colors.
Look at your scene and mix five to seven stock colors that represent the
major colors in its palette. You’ll modify each of these colors with white
and other colors as you paint. For example, you could use two blues
(one leaning toward green and the other leaning toward violet) for sky
and water; yellow-green, green, dark green, blue-green, and dark blue-
violet for trees, shrubs, and shadows. Also squeeze out a little of each of
your tube colors.

Part III: People, Places, and Things 

To improve your use of color in your painting, don’t wait until you need
it to put paint out on your palette. You’re more likely to use it if it’s
already out. Don’t worry about wasting paint; you’re more likely to
shortchange your painting than your pocketbook.
4. Go back to your canvas and, starting with the areas of the landscape
that are closest to you, do your underpainting.
The underpainting is the thin coat of paint that you lay in first (you can
read more about it in Chapter 5). With your darker green, lay in the pat-
terns of shadows on the forms that will be green with thinned paint. Do
the same on the objects that have different local colors.
5. Lay in the sunlit areas on your objects with thinned light versions of
your colors.
Yellow-green may be appropriate for these areas.
6. Paint the bodies of the objects with their local color and brush the
colors together slightly using a stroke appropriate to the texture of
your objects (see Figure 10-13).
Don’t blend the colors or lose your dark areas by brushing too much of
the lighter colors into them.
7. Move to your middle ground and background.
Lay in the darker areas of the forms using a lighter, duller version of the
colors you used for shadowed areas of the objects in your foreground.

Chapter 10: Take It Outside: Landscapes

One approach that creates distance is mixing the pale blue you use near
the horizon with the colors you use in the foreground to make the colors
you use in the middle and backgrounds. For example:
• If you paint a tree in the middle ground, you might mix one part
blue with two parts green for the leaves.
• If the color is in the far distance, you may choose three parts blue
to one part green. This will work only with a pale sky-blue color.
The brighter blues you use in the sky at the top of your painting, representing
the areas closest to you, are too bright to help you achieve distance.
8. For the sunlit areas, mix a slightly duller, darker version of the light
colors in your foreground; paint those areas in.
9. Mix duller versions of the local colors than you have in the
foreground and paint the bodies of the objects.
Loosely brush them together so that they have less texture than the
objects in the foreground.

colors of

10. Paint your sky.
Starting at the top of your canvas, loosely brush together the brightest
versions of your blues. As you move closer to the horizon, slightly dull
and lighten the colors and add violets to the mix.
11. As you paint around trees, treat the sky as negative space (see 
Figure 10-14).
Use it to help you shape the trees. If trees are in the background, blur
the edges slightly.
12. Go back to your foreground and continue to develop the textures and
values of the objects closest to the viewer (see Figure 10-15).
Make sure that the shadows of these objects are darker and deeper than
the shadows in the background.

mages of the human form have been a part of art since the very beginning.
Whether it relates to a record of historic event, an allegory, documentation
of a powerful individual, or the communication of human expression, other
people are fascinating.
Painting the human face is also one of the most challenging things you can
do. Actually, painting a likeness isn’t that difficult, but everyone has very high
standards. If the eyes don’t line up right or if the mouth is a bit off, you spot it
right away. Even people who have no interest in art become art critics when
they see a less-than-perfect likeness.
Although painting portraits can be a bit frustrating in the beginning, with
practice you can develop the skills necessary to create a true likeness and a
beautiful painting. We offer some basic points to consider as you pursue this
subject.
Doing Some Prep Work for Portraits
The layout of the proportions of the face may look familiar to you already.
You’ve seen an oval divided up for placement of the eyes, nose, mouth, and
so on. Therefore, whether from drawing lessons, a book, or your own experi-
ence, the placement of the features is easy to figure out. If you’ve ever had an
interest in sketching faces, you’ve probably tried this already.
If portraits are new to you, or if it’s been a while since you tried to draw an
image of someone, practice drawing the features of the face a bit first. You
can start by drawing from the upcoming diagrams in Figures 11-1 and 11-2 to
teach yourself how to make the different features of the face. You can draw
from photos or from your image in the mirror. Practice drawing eyes, noses,
and mouths until you feel comfortable with them.

156
Part III: People, Places, and Things 
Practicing the proportions of the face
Before you start painting, examine your face a bit to see whether the features
are always in the same place. Take a look at the illustration in Figure 11-1 and
follow these steps:
1. Gather your materials — a mirror, piece of paper, pencil, and a long
paintbrush handle or a skewer to use for a measuring tool.
You can use the mirror in your bathroom or a wall-mounted mirror.
2. Draw an oval on the paper and then look straight at the mirror to see
a full-face, frontal point of view.
3. Take one of your long paintbrushes and put the handle right down the
middle of your face, touching your nose; adjust the placement of the
brush so that the top end of the brush stops exactly at the point at the
top of your head.
4. Pinch the other end of the brush so that your thumb and index finger
mark the bottom of your chin.
This is the length of your head.
5. With your other hand, pinch a place on the handle right between your
eyes.
This marks your eye level. When you look at the paintbrush, do you
notice how your eye level comes almost exactly halfway between the
top of your head and your chin?
6. Mark your eye level on your oval.
7. Place the handle so that it measures from your eye level to your chin
and find the point for the base of your nose; mark this point on the
oval.
8. Do the same for the position of the mouth, using the opening of your
mouth as the measuring point.
If you compare your measurements to those in our illustration, you probably
find that they’re a little different. No one’s face is exactly the same as some-
one else’s. Everyone has measurements that vary from the standard bench-
marks you find in books about art techniques, but these benchmarks give
you a general idea of the placement of the features of the face.

Chapter 11: Basic Portrait Painting 101

Choosing the best point 
of view for a portrait
If you look through art books or go to the museum, you see portraits in many
different positions. For the most part, you see the head slightly turned to one
side. In a three-quarter view, the sitter is recognizable and looks natural. On
the other hand, you’re least likely to see profiles. A profile is the easiest point
of view to depict, because most of the likeness is tied up in the contour of the
face. If you get that contour right, the rest works out quite well. The problem
with profiles, however, is that the position looks unnatural. A full-face portrait
is another option, but it’s the most difficult because the nose is pointed
directly at the viewer, which makes it very difficult to capture. In addition, if
the symmetry of the face is even slightly off, it’s very apparent.
We think your best option is to try the three-quarter view. Place the brush
before your nose (see the preceding section for details) and turn your head a
quarter-turn to the left. Notice how the eye, nose, and mouth level are the
same, but your centerline is off to one side. The centerline isn’t a straight line
anymore — it curves and follows the contours of the face. This curving line
starts in the middle of your forehead and ends in the middle of your chin, but
it gently bends to the left to follow the line of the nose. The right cheek is a
wide surface, but the left cheek is reduced to a sliver.
Finding the relative position of the features is easy when you use the land-
marks of the face. Use your paintbrush handle to find some of these land-
marks. Hold it horizontally or vertically and see what parts of your features
line up with others. Again, every face is different, but here are some examples:
 The inside corner of the left eye is right above the middle of the lips.
 The inside corner of the right eye is right above the right corner of the
mouth.
 The bridge of the nose is higher, lower, or exactly in line with the eye
level. Where is it on your face?
 The top of the ear lines up with the level of the eyes, and the bottom of the
earlobe lines up with the lip line.
Project: A Self-Portrait 
in Black and White
As we emphasize throughout this book, a study is just an informal painting.
This study is a little experiment in black and white. As with any new subject,
simplifying the elements for the first try is best.
Your first study is a self-portrait. Now, don’t panic. We know that painting your-
self may make you feel self-conscious, but we have a couple of good reasons
for doing self-portraits. The model is always available when you are, and if it
doesn’t turn out as well as you’d like, you disappoint no one but yourself.
158
Part III: People, Places, and Things 

Also, self-portraits have a long and esteemed history in art. Many artists
create self-portraits during their careers, and it’s a very well-respected tool
for teaching students the basics of painting and drawing people.
Work through the following steps to get started, and then move through the
steps in the upcoming sections to create your self-portrait:
1. Gather your supplies.
You need a face-sized canvas — approximately 10 x 12 inches — a mirror
that’s at least 12 x 12 inches (or park yourself in front of the bathroom
mirror), black and white paint, a variety of brushes, solvent in a couple
of jars, a palette, and a palette knife.
2. Set up so that you have a three-quarter view of yourself in the mirror,
and arrange a clear light source directed at your face from the side.
You need this light source in order to see the contours of your face. A
lamp with the shade tilted toward you or a bright window works well.
3. Mix up some light gray paint to make a wash and draw an oval on
your canvas; use the steps for drawing that are in the earlier section,
“Practicing the proportions of the face.”
The oval should be about the same size as your face; don’t make it
smaller. Anything small is always more difficult to paint.
4. Make a very light line for the level of the eyes, nose, and mouth, and
draw the location of the hairline.
Check your work and make any necessary corrections.
Drawing the big contour 
of the edge of the face
After drawing in the proportions of your face, you add a line for the contour
that you see on the far side of the face. This contour line is important for
finding the placement of the facial features. Follow these steps and use Figure
11-3 as an example to add this contour line to your self-portrait:
1. Start at the top of the forehead, and curve the line outward to the
brow.
2. Dip the line in to follow the hollow of the eye socket.
3. Curve the line out for the cheekbone and down along the line of the
cheek, gently curving in to the chin.
4. Curve the line of the chin in to join the neck.
Don’t be concerned if the chin extends beyond the initial oval that you
drew. You’re still sketching in the basic form.
If you wear glasses, ignore them until later in the study. We give you instruc-
tions on how to make glasses at the end of this project.
159
Chapter 11: Basic Portrait Painting 101

Filling in the back of the head
The next step is to add some volume to the back of the head for the brain-
pan. Follow these steps:
1. Start at the top of the head near the hairline and draw a circular
shape that connects with the head at a point that’s even with the
bottom of the ear.
The connection point may be hidden by the hair, but it’s there. You can
make this point at approximately the bottom of the ear. You’re still drawing
and you can refine it as you work. You can also line up this point to the
level of the lip line to be more precise.
2. Sketch in the contour of the neck under the chin and draw another
line from the back of the head.
Looking rather human, yes?
Working on the contour of the nose
Make another line with your wash to indicate the contour of your nose. This
line runs from your left eyebrow to the base of your nose. These steps walk
you through the process:
Figure 11-3:
Developing
the contours
of the face.
160
Part III: People, Places, and Things 

1. Start at the point where the eyebrow extends the farthest, close to or
meeting the contour of the side of your face.
2. Follow the contour of your eyebrow to the bridge of your nose, down
the angle of the nose, and end at the base of your nose.
3. If yours is apparent, add the philtrum, that funny little vertical groove
under your nose that leads from the base of the nose to the lips.
Adding in the features
Now you add the other features of the face: the eyes and the mouth. Take a
moment to really look at your features. If you mentally simplify your face, you
see it as some lines and some dark spots or light spots. Notice how the
whites of the eyes aren’t really white. Your eyelashes aren’t big, curling
things, but a rather jagged dark line. Many people exaggerate the features,
and the face ends up looking pretty wacky with big false eyelashes, outlined
lips, and huge nostrils. Concentrate on painting what you see, not what you
know, and check out Figure 11-4.
Just about everybody has made an eye at one point or another. An eye is
shaped sort of like a football with a round iris in the middle and a little black
dot for the pupil. These eyes are at three-quarter view, however, and you’re
Figure 11-4:
The details
of the face
take shape.
161
Chapter 11: Basic Portrait Painting 101

concentrating on drawing just what you can see, so hold off on drawing those
football shapes. Keep working with the wash so that you can easily make cor-
rections while you follow these steps:
1. Find the iris of the eye on the far side of your face and put it in using
the contour of the nose to help you place it.
See how your iris is tucked into the bridge of your nose? Although every
face is different, it probably seems to be resting right in the inside
corner.
2. Add the line that you see on the top eyelid and the line that you see
on the bottom lid if it’s clear.
Whether you can see the bottom lid clearly depends on whether you
have fair or dark skin or if you have heavy lashes on the bottom eyelid.
3. Find a landmark on your face and draw a line to help you locate the
corner of the lips.
Use the features that you’ve already made to find the position of the
mouth. Compared to a full front view, the far side of your lips is smaller
and the nearside may appear to be a bit bigger. To use other parts of
your face to locate the position of the lips, see whether the far corner of
your lips lines up, for instance, with the tip of your nose. Or maybe it’s
right below the edge of the left iris.
4. Find the points for the corners of the mouth, and then locate the
centerline; make the line of the lips by connecting the two corners.
The centerline is a continuation of that little divot below your nose, the
philtrum.
5. Use the near corner of your lips to line up the position of the near eye.
The corner of the near eye is above the corner of the mouth.
6. Measure the base of the nose or the width of the mouth and use the
measurement to find the width of the near eye.
7. Carefully observe their shapes while you draw in the iris and the eyelids.
Don’t be shy about putting the dark circles under your eyes or the bump on
your nose. It’s a part of you and it needs to be in your self-portrait. Failing to
observe well and idealizing your image undermines your goal of capturing
your likeness.
Evaluating your image
Take a minute to assess the sketch you just made. Back up and use your
paintbrush to line up the forms. Then check the position of your own face.
Make any corrections that are glaring, but don’t overdo it. This is only for
practice.
The next step in your portrait is developing the lights and darks of your face.
Follow these steps:
162
Part III: People, Places, and Things 

1. Mix two pools of gray paint in light and medium values, using a different
brush for each.
You use two brushes, one for each pool of gray paint, so that the values
stay true to your mixes.
2. Find the shapes of the darkest areas of your face — the shaded side,
the upper lip, the background, and maybe your eyes if they’re dark —
and paint the medium gray in those areas.
3. Find the lightest areas — where the light hits your face on a cheek-
bone, the whites of the eye closest to the iris, and along the nose —
and indicate those areas with the lighter gray.
Don’t blend, just work up the face in patches of light and medium gray.
4. Fill in the middle tones that you see by picking up a little of both the
light and medium grays and adding it to the face.
You usually see the middle values in the middle of the cheek and forehead,
on the bottom lip, and around the eyes.
5. Cover the rest of the face with the appropriate grays.
Adding the finishing touches
Stand back and assess your results. Play with the values a while. Your canvas
will be very wet, and you have to stop working when the wet paint gets too
difficult. Leaving the study incomplete is fine, but you can also experiment
with other parts of the study — the background, the hair, or maybe an ear —
while the wet areas are drying a bit.
Glasses
At this point, you can put in glasses if necessary. The trick is to avoid giving
yourself Groucho Marx-style glasses — unless you wear Groucho glasses.
Take a minute to look at your glasses and concentrate on what you really see.
Then follow these steps:
1. Find the points where you see the light glinting off the frames, and
add them in with light gray paint.
That glint doesn’t go all the way around the glasses, just on a small portion.
2. Find the darkest part or area of your glasses, and add it in with the
darker gray paint.
It doesn’t go all the way around either, just a portion near your nose or
along the temples over your ear. You may see points along the frames of
your glasses where seeing the edges is difficult.
3. Continue to paint only the little glints and lines, not the entire frame.
Don’t try to connect the light lines and the dark lines. Take a look at
Figure 11-5 for an example.
163
Chapter 11: Basic Portrait Painting 101

Hair
Finally, paint in your hair. Paint it as patterns of light and dark shapes, not as
individual hairs and not as a solid color; otherwise, it will look like you have a
bowl on your head! Many people have darker hair around the nape of their
necks, and everyone has light areas around their crowns, either because of
the effect of light or because their hair is naturally lighter there. (Well, maybe
not naturally, but you know what we mean!) Pay attention to your light source,
because your hair will be lighter on that side and darker on the other.
If you like, you can experiment with textures that simulate the texture of your
hair. Everyone’s hair is different. Long fine hair looks smooth, and coarse hair
looks more textural.
Try to put some paint on every part of the canvas. When you’re finished,
evaluate your work. Again, don’t pick at it. Doing another study is better than
obsessing over a study and trying to make it perfect.
Preparing for a Color Portrait
After you’ve had a chance to experiment with black and white, try a portrait
in color. There are, of course, many colors of skin in the world, and each indi-
vidual has different colors in his or her skin. Skin tones are also affected by
exposure to sun, wind, and temperature. Throughout history, artists have
experimented with many different colors to create rich, complex, and authen-
tic skin color.

Part III: People, Places, and Things 

Recipes for mixing flesh tones
Human skin is made up of reds, yellows, and blues. You’ll encounter that basic
formula in any research that you do. You also may recognize these as the
primary colors. When you mix the primary colors together in the right propor-
tion, you get a rich, natural brown. Other variations give you a variety of muted
red and yellow-oranges that can serve as the basis for many different skin tones.
Depending on the darkness of the skin, you may also use titanium white to
bring out the contours of the face and the highlights on the skin. So, now the
only issue is which of the reds, yellows, and blues do you use?
 Yellows: Yellow ochre is a wonderful old color that’s been used as an art
pigment since the beginning of human history. Another yellow that some
artists use is Naples yellow, which was created specifically for portrait
painting, but it’s made with lead and is very toxic. You can also use raw
umber or burnt umber for dark skin.
 Reds: Cadmium red light is perfect for a florid complexion, and alizarin
crimson works well for dark skin tones. Examine the reds that you see in
the lips, try to determine whether you see orange-reds or red-violets,
and then experiment!
 Blues: Ultramarine blue is a warm blue that works well to dull the
brilliance of the orange that you make by mixing red and yellow. When
you mix the blue and orange, the resulting color makes a natural-looking
skin color. You can also try other blues, such as cerulean.
 Titanium white: This is the perfect white to use. The old masters used
lead white, but you should avoid it because of its toxicity.
Review the oil pigments in Chapter 2 for more details about these colors and
possible substitutions (like cadmium red light hue instead of true cadmium
red light).
A basic formula for skin
For lighter skin types, you can start by adding small amounts of cadmium red
light to yellow ochre until you have a bright orange color. Check the orange
against the skin tone you’re painting and modify it if it needs to be more red
or yellow. Add white until you have a color similar to what you see on the
inside of the arm or the lower portion of the cheek. Your mixture will be close
to what you want, but the color will be extremely bright, like stage makeup.
Add just a touch of ultramarine blue until you have something that looks
more natural.
For darker skin tones, start the same way, checking your orange against the
skin tone that you’re painting to see whether it leans toward red or yellow.
Then, rather than adding white at this point, start adding ultramarine blue
until you have a color near the value of the skin tone that you’re looking for.
Finally, add white to lighten the color and make it look more natural. You can
also experiment with using raw umber and burnt umber in your mixtures.
165
Chapter 11: Basic Portrait Painting 101

The main mistake that people make when working with darker skin tones is
relying solely on white to lighten the color. White may make the color too dull
and ashen to look natural for many people. Keep a stock of your orange set
aside to brighten the color if it becomes too dull as you lighten it.
To get a feel for the kinds of colors that you need for darker skin, look at your
model’s face and hands in bright sunlight. The exaggerated light helps you
see how the colors change as the skin gets lighter. Often, the color of the skin
is warmer when it’s lighter and cooler when it’s darker. When you see areas
of sunlit hot spots (spots of bright light reflecting on the skin), you need more
white without warming the color, but don’t use it exclusively.
The colors for all skin types get warmer as they get lighter, except in hot
spots, and cooler as they get darker. This warming of the skin color is less
noticeable in light skin tones.
Other formulas incorporate more than just the three primaries. Some formu-
las use greens instead of blues. Some use a complex formula based on a
double split complementary set of colors. With practice, you’ll find yourself
picking up many different colors as you develop your color instincts for
painting portraits.
Project: A Portrait in Color
For this project, you can use yourself as a model again and make a self-por-
trait. Of course, you can ask someone else to sit for you, but sitting for your-
self is the most convenient way to work on this project. You know your own
face the best, and you can peer into the mirror as closely as you want to
examine your own eye or ear; it may seem creepy to do that to a model. You
can indulge in a little ego-tripping, as well. If, however, you ask someone else
to sit for you, remember that adults are easier to paint than children are, and
they don’t get bored sitting still for a while.
When you’re ready to begin, follow these steps:
1. Use a wash of a light color to make your drawing on a small canvas.
You start your color self-portrait the same way you do the black and white
portrait. Look at “Project: A Self-Portrait in Black and White” earlier in
this chapter for more info on setting up your lighting and mirror. A
canvas that’s 14 x 18 or 16 x 20 works well.
Try to draw the head on the canvas so that it isn’t in the dead center.
Place it so that you have a little more negative space in front of the face
than behind the head. That way you don’t look like you have your nose
pressed against the edge of the canvas, and it makes a more-pleasing
composition for your portrait. Figure 11-6 shows the initial sketch for
our finished color portrait.
Make your drawing with a light color — yellow ochre, for example. Make
the oval and the lines for the features, and correct them as you work. Draw
and assess until you feel that you have the position for all the features
and contours of the face.
166
Part III: People, Places, and Things 

2. Begin to prepare your palette of colors by mixing up your medium
flesh color.
Try to match the tones on the lower cheek. This pool of paint is your
main stock. From it, you mix pools of the other major tones that you
need. Your pool of medium flesh color should be about the size of two
tablespoons. Use all the usual painting materials and colors, but make
sure that you have yellow ochre, cadmium red light or alizarin crimson,
ultramarine blue, and titanium white.
3. Separate about a nickel-sized portion from the pool of medium flesh
color and add a little white to it.
Use this color for lighter areas of the face.
4. Section off a dime-sized amount of the medium flesh color and add a
tiny bit of the red that you used to make the flesh color.
Use this color for your lips and the areas around your eyes.
5. Take another dime-sized amount of the stock flesh and mix in a bit of
blue.
Use this color for the shadows.
You now have four pools of paint to use for the major areas of the face.
You can also modify small amounts from these pools when you need
lighter, darker, warmer, or cooler colors for the face and neck. Because
you modify your paint as you go, be sure to squeeze out small amounts
of your tube colors so that they’re available when you need them.

Chapter 11: Basic Portrait Painting 101

6. Before you begin to paint, study the value patterns of the light and
dark areas of the face.
You’ll notice that their shapes generally follow the changes in the planes
of the face. As you study the face, note the direction of the lighting and
how it affects the values and coloring.
7. Start laying on the medium tones for the major planes of the face, like
the lower cheek, middle forehead, and nearside of the nose.
Ignore the features for a while as you start working general to specific.
Block in the colors in the shapes of the patterns that you see without
doing a lot of blending (see Figure 11-7). Don’t paint in details like pink
lips or blue eyes until later. Concentrate on just the medium skin tones
on the major planes of the face.
8. Add light values on the cheekbones and on the plane down the ridge
of the nose, lightening the color for highlighted areas.
9. Lay in your darker color for the shadows in the hollows of the eyes
next to the nose, the underside of the nose, and under the chin.
If you see a shadowed area cast by the nose on the far cheek, add that as
well.
Throughout the painting process, make sure that you continue to observe
the shapes of the values and colors of the face. At this stage, you can
easily get absorbed in what you’re doing and forget to look at your subject.

10. Add the pink on the lips, cheeks, edges of the eyes, and anywhere else
you see it.
Notice that the upper lip is darker than the lower lip. You can pick up a
little more red and maybe blue with your brush and mix it to create this
color. The lower lip has a highlighted area as well. Just add a little more
white to the pink for this area.
11. Paint the eyes by following the procedure that we describe in the
black and white portrait.
Here are some tips for working in color:
• Use a dark version of your flesh tone to define the upper lid and a
lighter version for the lower lid.
• Don’t paint the color of the iris too brightly or make the whites of
the eyes too white. The upper eyelid casts a shadow on the iris
and whites of the eyes, so that area is darker than the lighted area.
The iris and white of a shadowed eye are darker than the same
areas of the eye in light.
• Here’s a mix that you can use for the white of the eye: Take a bit of
your darker flesh color and add more white and blue to it. The mix
should look like a slightly pinkish gray-violet. That alone may work
for the darkest areas of the white that you need. If it’s too dark,
add a little white. Add more white for the light areas of the white of
the eye.
• The highlight on the iris isn’t white. It’s a lighter version of the
white of the eye.
12. Paint the rest of the nose.
The underside of the nose is triangular, with the sides of the nose wrap-
ping around the nostrils. You may have already painted a darker value
on the underside of the nose.
13. Study the shapes and tilts of the nostrils; mix a dark blue-violet
(almost black) and paint their shapes.
14. Paint the hair by following the suggestions in the black and white study.
Make sure that you approach hair as a pattern of dark and light versions
of the color of the hair. Use your brushstrokes to emulate the texture of
the hair.
15. Continue to develop and refine the face with mixtures of all the colors.
If you lose the position of any of the features, take a moment to reestablish
the position. Check out Figure 11-8 to see an example of a completed
color self-portrait.
You’re working on a small canvas, so if it gets too wet to work, spend some
time on the position of the neck or the hair texture, or take a break from it for
few minutes.

Chapter 11: Basic Portrait Painting 101

Sometimes you may feel that the work is getting too intense, and you’ll get
antsy and nervous. Stop and take a break. Use the time to wash your hands
and reapply barrier cream, leave the room for a few minutes, and do some-
thing else. When you return, you’ll be ready to tackle the painting again.
Don’t try to blend the colors too much — you’re making a sketchy painting,
like Van Gogh’s self-portraits. If you want to refine the study into a more-
complete painting, let it dry for a day or two and then return to it. The paint
will be dry enough at that point that you’ll be able to blend the edges of the
colors, or try some glazing techniques that you can see in Chapter 8.
After you have all parts of the canvas covered (no gesso showing), wrap your
palette in foil, clean your brushes, and leave the painting for a day or two.
You can leave the painting as it is, a study, or you can go back into the painting
and refine it. The great thing about working general to specific is that you can
stop at any point for a study or continue for a very polished work. As with
everything, if your goal is to develop good portraits skills, the key is practice,
practice, practice.

I
n this chapter, we discuss painting from a model. We show you how to work
on a general approach to painting people to get you started in this fascinating
area. We help you build some basic skills that will enable you to paint your friends
and family, and we also show you areas that can be problematic.
As you begin this work, you should realize that building skills in painting
people is a lifelong endeavor. Don’t be discouraged if your first efforts don’t
live up to your hopes. If you work regularly and with consistency, you’ll con-
tinue to progress.
Working with a Model
The idea of working from a live model often conjures up all kinds of romantic
notions. In reality, little is glamorous about it. The work is hard for both the
artist and model.
Painting people as your subject matter is known as figure painting. Your
model may also be called the figure.

Setting up your model for a painting
Setting up your model for a painting is like setting up a good still life. You have
all the same considerations that you do when you set up a still life: lighting,
background, color, composition, and so on. Here are some things that you
should think about when you set up your model:
 The best point of view for a seated figure is a three-quarter view, especially
if you’re thinking about a full-figure portrait.
 Lighting is one of your most important concerns. Try several lighting
situations before finalizing your setup.
Natural light may be attractive, but remember that it’s constantly changing.
Light from a window on the north side of a building provides the most
constant illumination.
 Consider how the colors in your model’s clothing relate to the rest of the
colors in the scene.
 Look at your background. It can be plain or active, but it shouldn’t
distract attention from your model.
 Use your viewfinder to check your scene while you put it together.
 If you plan to work for more than one session, be sure that you can
rebuild your scene easily. Also, make sure that your model can maintain
the pose for the duration.
Taking care of your model
Your model is a living being. Getting involved in your work and forgetting to
take care of your model’s comfort is easy to do. Here are some things you
should do to set up a good working environment for your model:
 First and most importantly, don’t torture your model by making him or
her pose endlessly without a break. Get an inexpensive kitchen timer
and set it for no more than 20-minute sessions. Let your model take a
break of at least 10 minutes between sessions.
When it’s time to take a break, mark the positions of the model’s feet,
arms, and seat with strips of masking tape. Ask the model to remain
seated while you outline the positions of the feet on the floor and run
strips along the sides of the hips on the seat of a chair, and on the arms
of the chair, if applicable. Use your drawing to help the model get back
into position.
 Don’t let the entire working session run too long. Working longer than
two to three hours is very taxing for the model.
 Make sure that the temperature of the room and other conditions are
comfortable for your model.
 When you set your lighting, keep it out of your model’s eyes.
172
Part III: People, Places, and Things 

 Make sure that the model is sitting in a position that will remain
comfortable for the entire work session.
 Some models are chatty, but others fall asleep. If chatting bothers you,
arrange to have some entertainment, such as television or music, for the
model.
 Be a good host.
Young children aren’t good models for beginning figure and portrait paintings
and shouldn’t be expected to sit for them.
A few words about nude models
If you decide that you want to focus on painting the human form, you eventu-
ally should take some figure drawing courses where you can work from a
nude model in a class environment. If you want to understand the underlying
structure of the body and the way it moves, working from a nude model is
necessary. Trying to learn to paint people only while they’re clothed is like
learning to paint hands only when they’re gloved.
If you take a course, you work with an experienced instructor and model in a
professional, dignified environment. This is an established part of artists’
training that’s many centuries old.
Most students are nervous before their first session, but within minutes
they’re more worried about their drawing than the fact that they’re drawing
from a nude model. From then on, they think nothing of it. Many students
even have a sense of pride and accomplishment that goes along with it.
They’ve walked across the bed of hot coals and survived to tell about it!
You can find figure drawing and painting courses through your local arts
organizations and junior colleges or universities. Most art schools also have
community outreach programs that offer courses.
Setting Up Your Work Area
After you arrange your setup and decide how you want to paint your model,
let your model relax or do something else for a bit while you prepare your
work area.
When you work from a model, you pull together everything you learned from
doing still life painting and self-portrait into one painting. Don’t think of this
painting as something completely different. Use those skills to set up your scene
and your work area. If you need to refresh your memory, read the sections in
Chapter 4 on setting up your work area, Chapter 7 on setting up a still life,
and Chapter 11 on the colors to mix.
173
Chapter 12: Beyond Portraiture: More on Painting People

Figure 12-1 shows how the work area and model were set up for the painting
in Figures 12-2, 12-3, and 12-4. Here are some important points to remember
when you set up your own model:
 Set up your work area so that you have a clear view of the model without
having to peer over your canvas or across your painting arm. Set up
your palette on the same side of your body as your painting arm.
 Space yourself far enough away from the model that you can see the
entire scene you plan to paint without tilting your head down or turning
to either side.
 Mix pools of paint that you’ll use for the major areas of the painting
before you seat your model. These pools include major flesh tones, as
well as clothing and background colors.
Project: How to Block In 
and Paint the Figure
One of the biggest mistakes beginners make when they first begin to paint
people is to paint them too small in their compositions. You can control this
easily when you first begin the drawing for your painting.
The first marks you make on the canvas establish how big your figure is going
to be and where it will be on the composition. If you can arrange the figure to
touch any two sides of the picture frame in your composition, you’ll never
paint a figure too small in the composition.

Part III: People, Places, and Things

When you paint the full figure, working larger is easier than working on a
small canvas. Choose a prepared stretched canvas or canvas board that’s at
least 18 x 24 inches. A good size may be 24 x 30 inches. When you’re ready to
begin, follow these steps:
1. Choose or mix a very light color to start your drawing.
Because painting figures is new to you, using a light color allows you to
make corrections with a darker color.
2. Start drawing the figure like a stick figure.
By drawing the interior directions of the body first, rather than the out-
side contours, you can control the positions much more easily. Refer to
Chapter 13, where we describe this process for drawing the figure.
3. On top of those simple directional lines, make geometric shapes for
the major parts of the body.
4. Refine the geometric shapes to look more like the organic forms of
the body and clothing.
5. After you complete your drawing of the figure, draw its background.
See an example of a completed drawing in Figure 12-2.
6. Block in the major value patterns.
Lay in the shapes of the darker values in the scene with dark versions of
the colors of the clothing or with the darker, cooler flesh tones in the face
and body. This step helps you set the value pattern for your painting and
gives you an idea of what your general composition is going to look like.
Be sure to lay in any dark areas of the background that will help you
define the light edges of the figure. Define edges this way rather than
drawing a dark line to define the area.

Chapter 12: Beyond Portraiture: More on Painting People

Don’t paint the figure as if you’re coloring a page out of a coloring book —
your work will look flat. As you paint, think about painting the forms
edge-to-edge and plane-to-plane rather than painting lines and filling in.
This way, you paint patterns and planes that make your work look more
three-dimensional.
7. After you paint your dark patterns, block in your middle value colors,
and finally the light areas (don’t add highlights until the painting is
nearly finished).
When you work on the face, hands, or feet, keep them very general in
the beginning. Don’t fuss over them and neglect the rest of your canvas.
Just concentrate on capturing their basic planes and patterns. In Figure
12-3, you can see how we blocked in the major forms.
Clothing has many different weights and textures. Concentrate only on
painting the basic value patterns that you see rather than focusing on
the details and minutia of the cloth.
8. After you block in the basic value patterns, begin to refine the forms.
Again, don’t get tied up in knots over the face and hands. Treat them just
as you do the rest of the canvas. The shapes in those areas will probably
be smaller than the shapes in most of the other areas of your picture,
but the way you paint them is the same. You just need smaller brushes.
Be especially careful not to make the hands or feet look too worried and
overworked. Take a breath and look closely at the patterns and shapes.
Use the correct shapes, but don’t paint them so that their complexity
detracts attention from the face or other important parts of the compo-
sition. Keep the forms simple yet true to their shapes.

Part III: People, Places, and Things

See the sections on troublesome body parts and painting fabric later in
this chapter for more information about painting these areas.
9. As you refine the forms, be selective about which areas you refine —
those areas will have more detail and come into focus more than
other areas.
Stand back and evaluate your work often.
10. Add highlights and darkest darks last. Figure 12-4 shows our finished
portrait.
Special Concerns in Figure Painting
Painting figures is a complicated process, and you’re bound to have trouble
in one area or another. This section presents some tips for dealing with these
problems.
Proportions and realistic body positions
Everyone makes a big deal about proportions. Getting them right is impor-
tant, but memorizing a set of standard proportions isn’t really that useful.
Most are idealized sets of body proportions that resemble the kennel club
standards you’d use for breeding dogs.
Everyone is different from any given set of standards, and if you try to
impose them on the figure in your painting, your painting will never look like
the model. The only practical way that you can apply them is if you have
someone modeling for you in a standing position.

into focus.
177
Chapter 12: Beyond Portraiture: More on Painting People

Sighting the figure
The best way to establish proportions is by observation. A tool that can help
you find your directional lines, as well as measurements of different parts of
the body, is a sighting stick. We discuss this tool in Chapter 6, but we also
give you a brief description here as it relates to painting from a model.
The best object that you can use for a sighting stick is a skewer, but you can
also use a pencil or paintbrush. When you look for the angles of your directional
lines, you compare the angular lines of the body against a horizontal sighting
stick. When you use the sighting stick as a measuring device, you compare
other parts of the body to a specific part of the body, such as the width of the
shoulders. This measurement is your “given” or “known” measurement, and
you compare everything else to it.
Getting the proportions right
A few simple guidelines may be helpful. Check out Figure 12-5 as you look
over them.
Because many beginning artists make the legs too short, here are two guide-
lines that may help:
 The distance from the top of the head to the hipbones is equal to the
distance from the hipbones to the heels of the feet.
 The distance from the hipbone to the middle of the knee is equal to the
distance from the knee to the heel of the foot.
Figure 12-5:
Some
simple
proportions
that may
help guide
you.
178
Part III: People, Places, and Things

Because making the hands too small is a common problem, keep these guide-
lines in mind:
 The length of the hand is equal to two-thirds the distance from the crook
of the arm to the wrist.
 When arms are relaxed at the sides of the body, the wrists hit at the
hipbones and the tips of the fingers hit at the halfway point between 
the hipbones and the middle of the knees.
You’d be amazed at how many people on television have big heads — physically,
that is. Here’s a proportion that you can use to check it:
 The head is one-third the width of the shoulders.
These guidelines are useful only if the model poses in a standing position. Most
of the time, however, the model is posed so that you’re looking at the body in
any number of inconvenient angles. That’s when things get interesting.
Understanding foreshortening
In foreshortening, an object appears to become shorter as it changes from
being parallel to the viewer to pointing toward or away from the viewer.
Foreshortening is the reason that you need to learn how to sight angles and
measure lengths. You have to deal with foreshortening any time any object
sits on an angle toward or away from you.
Try this exercise to better understand foreshortening:
1. Stand in front of a mirror with your arms resting at your sides.
2. Keep your right arm straight, and swing it out to the side until it
reaches shoulder level.
Notice how the length of your upper arm and the length of your lower
arm remain the same as they were when your arm was at your side.
Their lengths don’t change as long as they remain parallel to your body.
3. Keep your arm at shoulder level and slowly swing your arm toward
the mirror until you can point your finger at yourself in the mirror.
Notice how the lengths of your upper and lower arm appear to become
shorter and shorter until your arm nearly disappears behind your point-
ing finger. If you continue to swing your arm until it crosses your body,
you’ll see the lengths start to become longer again.
You can use a two-part strategy for drawing foreshortened limbs and other
parts of the body. We call it the “inside-outside” technique, and we show it in
Figure 12-6. Here’s what you need to know:
 The inside: Imagine that you can see the bone inside and draw a line
that represents its angle and length. Use your sighting stick to help you.
 The outside: Imagine that the foreshortened limb is a jigsaw puzzle.
Visually break the limb down into a few basic shapes that can be put
together like a puzzle. Draw the shapes so that they fit together on top
of the line you drew to represent the inside.
179
Chapter 12: Beyond Portraiture: More on Painting People

Troublesome body parts
Guess what? They’re all troublesome!
Okay, we hear that, and we urge you to be patient. We give you a lot to do and
a lot to think about in this chapter. It doesn’t come right away or all at once.
With every painting, you gain more skill. If you work consistently, you see a
lot of progress in a short time. Keep working and you’ll surprise yourself.
In the meantime, we offer some help with the parts of the body that give
beginning artists the most trouble.
Putting some meat on those bones
Breaking the body down into manageable parts is easier if you have some
understanding of human anatomy. Don’t freak. You don’t have to memorize
any muscles or bones. You already know the parts that you need to know to
get started. You just need to look at them more closely.
Rather than drawing and painting arms and legs that look like noodles, give
them some shape. When you can see them, draw the elbow and knee bones
and the major muscles, like calves and biceps. Muscle and bone also affect
how clothing drapes over them, so you need to have some understanding of
what’s underneath the fabric.
To start, you can use some basic oval shapes for the muscles that most affect
the shapes of the arms and legs. In Figure 12-7, we show you how to draw the
shapes of the muscles, and how to draw the patterns of the values and paint
them in.

“inside-
outside”
strategy to

ening
problems.

Part III: People, Places, and Things

To help you see the anatomy of the legs better, look in a mirror, feel your own
legs to check them out, or take a look at Figure 12-8. This list includes some
additional tips:
 The ankle bone on the inside of your leg is higher than the ankle bone on
the outside of your leg.
 The calf of your leg bulges out higher on the outside of your leg and
lower on the inside of your leg.
 You can see an “H” shape on the backside of your leg at the knee.

Chapter 12: Beyond Portraiture: More on Painting People

Depicting hands and feet
The secret to drawing hands and feet is to break them down into simple parts.
Follow these steps to get an idea of how to draw hands, and refer to Figure 12-9:
1. Draw the hand like a mitten, but rather than drawing it as a generalized
mitten-like shape, draw it as though the mitten is tight and you can
see the positions of the fingers.
2. Draw the negative spaces between the fingers.
3. Break down the flat of the hand and the fingers into planes.
4. Paint the value patterns in the hand.
Feet are a little more complicated to describe. In essence, you need to draw a
large basic shape from which you can build the rest of the foot. For example,
you can draw triangles for the front and outside views of the foot and modify
them to make the toes or heel. For the inside view, you can use an arch shape
and add the toes and heel. For the back view, you can use a triangle for the
Achilles’ heel and tendon and then add the ankles and visible parts of the foot
on either side. It’s probably easiest if you simply take a look at some pictures
of shapes that you can use for back, front, and side views — that’s what
Figure 12-10 provides.

Problem areas in the face
Becoming comfortable painting the features of the face takes a little practice.
The following sections provide some pointers.
Eyes
Take a look at Figure 12-11 and keep these points in mind:
 Structurally, the eyes are balls set into sockets.
 The lids wrap around the top and bottom of the eyeball and they have
thickness.
 The eyelashes and upper lids cast a shadow on the iris and whites of the
eyes.

183
Chapter 12: Beyond Portraiture: More on Painting People

Ears
You can paint an ear in three steps (as shown in Figure 12-12):
1. Use the darker values of the hair to define the outside shape of the ear.
It’s roughly shaped like an organic looking “C.” Include the ear lobe.
2. Use the dark area of the ear canal to define the squareish shaped flap
of cartilage that protects it.
3. Paint the rest of the ear by looking at the shapes of the dark values.
Noses
Noses are essentially triangular tent shapes that you can refine into the
shape of a nose. Check out Figure 12-13 and follow these steps:
1. Draw a tent shape first, and then slice off the narrow ridge of the nose
(unless you need it) so that you have a flat plane running down the
ridge.
2. Mark where this plane changes angles, if it does.

Part III: People, Places, and Things

3. On the triangular underside of the nose, draw the shapes of the openings
of the nostrils.
They’re more or less shaped like beans.
4. Draw the curved sides of the nostrils and refine the rest of the shapes
of the nose.
5. Look very closely at the value patterns and then paint them.
Each change of plane is a different value. Often, the underside of the
nose is the darkest area.
Mouths
Mouths don’t have to be difficult. If you keep a few things in mind and refer to
Figure 12-14, you can paint a great mouth every time:
 Don’t outline and fill in the lips as if you’re applying lipstick. Treat the
upper and lower lips differently.
 The center line that represents the opening of the lips is the darkest line.
 In most cases, the entire upper lip is darker than the lower lip.
 The center third of the bottom lip’s lower edge is darker than the rest of
the lip.
 The corners of the mouth are dark.

How to paint clothing
Painting clothing can be an overwhelming task, but if you remember to work
general to specific, you can break it down into manageable parts — and that
makes it much less confusing.
If you study the fabric your model is wearing, you find that you have two
different kinds of shapes in the fabric: smooth, rolling shapes and angular
shapes. When you paint the rolling shapes, paint even transitions from one
value to another. The angular shapes are easier to paint, but they look more
complicated. Break down large shapes into a series of smaller triangular
shapes. Paint each shape a different value from the shapes around it, as
shown in Figure 12-15.
You achieve texture by matching your brushstrokes and values to the type of
surface that you’re emulating. Use smooth, blended strokes and a wide range
of values from very light to very dark for shiny satin fabrics. On the other
hand, a matte fabric with a texture may require short, choppy strokes and
limited range of values.
Pay a lot of attention to the value pattern in the fabrics of the clothing your
models are wearing and you can paint realistic clothing.

W
e begin by talking about how to plan your painting
and how to start making decisions about the way it
will look. Painting is more than slapping paint on a canvas.
A good painting is designed well. In Chapters 15 and 16,
we talk about the core concepts of good design and tell
you how you can avoid the mistakes that beginners make.
We show you how to tie the way you compose your paint-
ing to the ideas that you want to express. We also help
you recognize how your personality shows up in the way
you put your painting together and how you can harness
that knowledge about yourself to beneﬁt your painting.
We end this part by beeﬁng up your knowledge of color.
We show you how to use color to create depth and direct
your viewer’s attention around your canvas. Finally, we
provide strategies for choosing color schemes that will
result in mesmerizing color in your painting.

N
othing is as tantalizing — or as frightening — as a blank canvas. It’s
brimming with possibility for exhilarating success, miserable failure,
and everything in between. If you paint a lot, you’ll have many successes, but
in the beginning, you’ll also have some frustrating “learning experiences.”
Painting is a process that begins well before you start putting a brush and
paint to canvas. Although your main concern may be how realistic you can
paint that vase of irises, you undermine your efforts when you don’t stop to
do a little planning before you start. There’s a time for diving in and painting
directly on the canvas, but at other times you need to slow down and do some
drawing or make rough color sketches before you begin painting on the canvas.
The fate of the final work can be decided by the time you apply the first layer
of paint to the canvas. You can maximize your chances for a successful painting
if you think through what you need to do before you get your brushes out.
In this chapter, we talk about the things you need to think about or do before
you actually start painting: setting up a good still life and making rough
sketches. We give you some simple drawing lessons, show you how to transfer
a thumbnail sketch to your canvas, and talk about how to keep a sketchbook.
We also give you some strategies for working more creatively by developing
images from collage. 
Working from Observation
Working from observation can be tricky because most people have a tendency
to focus more on how to draw or paint the individual objects than the appear-
ance of the overall picture. Throughout this book, we encourage you to work
general to specific. When you’re more concerned with how to paint individual
objects at the expense of the total composition, you’re literally too bogged
down in the specifics to see the big picture.

192
Part IV: Color and Design
Designing off the canvas
The design process that happens prior to working on the canvas can involve
any combination of these steps:
 Researching an artist or a technique
 Gathering interesting objects or arranging for someone to model for you
 Arranging the objects or seating the model in an interesting manner
 Making thumbnail sketches to test different compositions
 Making rough color sketches to try out different color compositions
 Transferring the drawing to the canvas
Having compelling things to paint and arranging them in an interesting way
are essential preparation for all observational work. The others are optional
based on the needs of the work you’re doing.
Setting up a successful still life
Your painting is only as good as your setup, so the process of designing the
look of your painting starts with the choices you make. What objects are you
going to paint, and how are you going to arrange them? Here, we give you
some basic guidelines to follow.

 Choose a collection of objects that combines similar shapes with a variety
of shapes. A mix of basic shapes that resemble circles, rectangles, and
lines (or cylinders, boxes, and linear forms) works well.
 Use an odd number of objects. An odd number is usually more effective
than an even number, but this isn’t a rigid rule.
 Use your viewfinder to find the best framing for your picture. Look at the
areas near the outer edges of the composition. Are they so empty that
your objects look like they have a big halo around them? If so, stop and
spread them out, or, if you like their positions, frame the picture in
closer so that they fill the frame better.
Your viewfinder must be set to the same proportions as your canvas if
you want your painting to resemble what you see.
 Consider your shadows important shapes. Use an inexpensive clip-on
light to create shadows that have character. Lighting your still life from
the side gives you better shadows than lighting it from above does. Play
with the clip-on light to find the best shadows for your setup.

Avoid:
 Bunching your objects together like football players in a huddle. Spread
them out. Look at how the space around the objects is shaped by their
placement. Give them some air and look at the shape of that space while
you try different placements.
 Clustering objects to the sides of the picture with empty space in the
middle.
 Making pyramidal arrangements, unless you have a good reason for
doing it. They work great for crucifixion scenes, but it’s best to avoid
using them for your everyday fruit and wine bottle still life.
 “Police lineup” arrangements, unless you have a reason for it.
 Lining up the bottoms of all the objects on a horizontal line.
 Washing the whole setup with light.
We can’t give you a single, perfect way to set up your objects to paint. You’ll
discover many different kinds of compositions and ways to arrange your objects.
Ideally, you should arrange your objects to convey a certain mood or idea
that you’re trying to communicate. Chapters 14 and 15 discuss these
concepts more thoroughly and help you begin to think about tying your 
ideas to your arrangements.
Making Preparatory Drawings
Taking a few minutes to make a rough sketch of your setup before you start
painting is the most valuable action you can take to prepare for your painting.
It’s quick and gives you the opportunity to make important decisions about
the composition of the painting before you actually start working on the canvas.
After you start applying paint to the canvas, making changes can be difficult
and time-consuming because the paint dries so slowly. Of course, you always
have the option of wiping out areas with a rag, but it’s messy, inconvenient,
and wasteful. A little sketching beforehand is worth every minute.
You can use several approaches to making preparatory drawings:
 You can actually sketch on the canvas with charcoal or draw with
thinned paint and a brush.
 You can make small thumbnail sketches, which aren’t quite as small as
the name implies, but are still miniature in relationship to the size of the
canvas. Artists often keep sketchbooks where they make their thumbnail
sketches and collect ideas for paintings.
 You can make a rough sketch that’s the actual size of the painting. This
approach is good to use for a smaller painting, but if you’re making a
large painting, make this approach your second stage of preparation,
after making thumbnail sketches. The Renaissance artists, like
Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci, made actual-size drawings of the
figures they planned to paint so that they could transfer the drawings to
the areas they were painting. These drawings were called cartoons.

Chapter 13: Planning Your Painting

Deciding to draw directly on the canvas
The only real reason to draw directly on the canvas is speed. Speed is an
advantage when you’re making studies and single-sitting paintings. You want
to get in quickly and start painting. The painting itself is like a sketch.
Speed also makes a painting look very fresh, as long as you don’t work on it
too long. Some artists dislike paintings that look very finished and enjoy the
directness of beginning with sketching on the canvas. It takes practice and
doing a lot of quick paintings to learn when to stop working on an individual
painting.
Keeping a sketchbook
Sketchbooks are great tools for artists. In a lot of ways, they’re at the heart of
what it is to make art. You may think that sketchbooks are just for drawing,
but it’s better to think of them more like a journal. Regardless of whether an
artist works in it every day or very sporadically, it’s the place where the
artist works out problems, makes notes, keeps a diary, and, yes, draws!
Here’s a list of the kinds of things you might find in a sketchbook:
 Thumbnail sketches
 Ideas for artwork
 Drawings of objects and people for practice and skill building
 Research about subject matter
 Color samples
 Clippings of articles, photographs, and other printed materials
 Poetry and prose written by the artist
 Collages
 Notes about the daily activities of the artist
Many artists recommend that you work in your sketchbook every day. Frankly,
the more you work on your drawing, the faster your painting improves and
the less you struggle with the drawing in your painting. If you consistently
practice the instructions we give you for making thumbnail sketches for 20
minutes a day, you should make great progress. Much more so than if you
draw only to make your paintings.
Making thumbnail sketches
As the name implies, thumbnail sketches are small, quickly made drawings.
Artists usually make them to work out ideas for every kind of artwork, including
three-dimensional art, such as ceramics and sculpture.
194
Part IV: Color and Design

Don’t agonize over details in thumbnail sketches. Just work quickly to capture
the general shapes, sizes, and positions of the objects that you’re drawing. The
idea is to estimate the general proportion and scale of the objects in relation
to each other and the way you’ll arrange them within the space of your canvas.
See the example in Figure 13-1, and follow these steps to create your own:
1. Arrange your setup and figure the size of your thumbnails.
You can approach this step in two ways:
• If you already have a canvas or other surface to paint on, make
sure that you keep your thumbnails the same proportion as that
surface. The forms you’re drawing won’t fit the same way into a
space with different proportions. If the proportions don’t match,
you’re wasting your time. Take the measurement of the canvas you
have, and find a small rectangle the same proportion as the mea-
surement of your canvas. For example, if you have a 16-x-20-inch
canvas, use a 4-x-5-inch rectangle. For an 18-x-24-inch canvas, use a
3-x-4-inch or 6-x-8-inch rectangle.
• If you want to plan your composition and then decide the size of
your canvas, choose a rectangle for your thumbnails that trans-
lates into a standard size. Squares are also good, and you can
choose any size square because the proportions are always the
same (thanks to the fact that all four sides are equal).
2. Draw a few rectangles so that you can try more than one composition;
consider both horizontal and vertical formats.
3. Set your viewfinder to a rectangle that’s the same proportion as your
thumbnails, and test several possible compositions.
Figure 13-1:
An example
of a

sketch.
195
Chapter 13: Planning Your Painting

4. Begin to draw with a sharp pencil using very loose, free lines.
Draw lightly at first and then darken the lines when you’re sure that you
want to keep them. Don’t spend more than five to ten minutes on each
drawing.
Here are some additional tips for drawing thumbnails:
 If all that math in the preceding steps is making your eyes glaze over, a
proportion wheel is a handy, inexpensive tool that you can pick up at
your local art supply store. By simply lining up the numbers on two con-
centric wheels, you can easily figure the measurements for enlarging or
reducing the sizes of rectangles in proper proportion. It’s easy!
 If the enlargement isn’t going to be bigger than the sheet of paper that
you’re making your rough sketch on, you can find the size of the enlarge-
ment very easily. Simply draw a diagonal through the bottom-left and
top-right corners of the frame that you’re using and then continue it out-
side the rectangle of the frame. Mark a new height or width and draw the
new line down or out so that it meets the diagonal you drew. Where
these two lines meet is your new top-right corner, so all you have to do
now is draw the last line of your rectangle. Measure the size of the new
rectangle to get the size of your enlargement. (See Figure 13-2.)
 If you draw the objects in your thumbnails as though you can see through
them, you prevent objects from looking like they’re intertwined with each
other. In Figure 13-3, notice that the two objects on the left seem too tightly
placed together. Many people will look at it and think that something is
vaguely wrong, but they won’t quite be able to put their fingers on it. If
you draw your shapes as though you can see through them, as in the two
figures on the right in Figure 13-3, you can see that the problem is that the
two objects are trying to occupy the same space.

Drawing box shapes
Your drawings will always appear fairly structurally sound if you make sure
that all the vertical lines are parallel to each other as well as to the sides of
your frame. It’s like making a building plumb so that it doesn’t collapse. Also
ensure that all lines that are meant to be horizontal are parallel to the top
and bottom of your frame.
To draw a box as though you can see through it, follow these steps (see
Figure 13-4):

Chapter 13: Planning Your Painting

1. Draw the leading edge (the vertical edge closest to you).
2. Draw the side of the box to the left of the leading edge, making sure
that your vertical lines are plumb.
3. Draw the side of the box to the right of the leading edge.
4. From the farthest-top corner of the left side, draw a line that runs
slightly longer and nearly parallel to the top line of the right side of
the box.
Make sure that the space between the lines doesn’t get wider as you
draw it. The space should stay the same or become slightly narrower.
5. From the farthest-top corner of the right side, draw a line that runs
nearly parallel to the left side of the box until it crosses the line you
drew from the left corner.
The lines cross at the back corner of the box.
6. Draw a light vertical line down from the back corner; make it very
slightly shorter than the length of your leading edge.
7. Lightly draw a line from the farthest-bottom corner of the left side to
the bottom of the vertical you just drew.
8. Draw a light line from the farthest-bottom corner of the right side to
the bottom of the vertical.
This step completes the box.
9. To clarify the shape of the box, darken the lines of the edges that you
would be able to see.
Drawing bottles, cans, and other cylinders
Bottles, tin cans, and many other containers are cylinders. A cylinder is a set
of ellipses attached with lines. Here are some tips that will make your cylinders
look great every time:
 Many beginners do a good job with the tops of their cylinders but make
the bottoms look flat. Always draw a full ellipse at the bottom to get a
better-looking cylinder. (Figure 13-5 shows you how the ellipse at the
bottom should look.)
 Make a true ellipse. Football, almond, and racetrack shapes aren’t
ellipses. Figure 13-6 shows you the three common mistakes beginners
make when they draw ellipses.
 Follow Figure 13-7 and these steps for a simple way to draw any cylinder:
1. Draw its profile as if it’s a flat shape.
2. If the lines change direction the way they do with a wine bottle,
draw a horizontal line across every point where they change 
direction.
3. On every horizontal line, draw an ellipse. 
Make sure that each ellipse is narrower at the top of the bottle and
that the set of ellipses becomes progressively wider at the bottom.

Chapter 13: Planning Your Painting

Drawing people
Making a good, rough drawing of a person takes practice, so don’t be too
hard on yourself if it doesn’t look as good as you’d like right away. The best
strategy is to lightly plot out the position of the person as a stick figure first
and then build the flesh and clothing of the figure on top of that drawing.
Don’t worry about the details of the face and hands; just try to capture the
general shapes. 
This drawing should take no more than five minutes. Don’t torture your
model by drawing longer. Let the model rest and then try other poses. The
more poses you draw, the better and faster you’ll get. Follow these steps for
practice and check out Figure 13-8:
1. Have your model stand in a relaxed position, and take a second to
look at him or her before you begin drawing.
Note the angles of the lines of the shoulders and hips. Also look at the
directions of the lines of the arms and legs. Especially look at the posi-
tion of the feet in relationship to the shoulders and hips.
2. Don’t start with the head — instead, lightly draw lines for the angle of
the shoulders, spine, and hips.
Of course, you can’t actually see the spine, so estimate it with a straight
or curved line, depending on the pose.
3. Look at where the knees and feet are in relation to the shoulders and
mark their positions, lightly drawing straight lines to note the direc-
tions of the legs and feet.
4. Draw lines to represent the arms and hands.
5. Find the position of the chin in relation to the shoulders and draw an
egg shape for the head.
6. Add a nose if you’re working with a profile.
7. Lightly draw almond shapes for the rib cage, and a U shape for the
pelvis.
8. Loosely draw the clothing.
Don’t bother with details. Just draw the basic shapes.
9. Block in the shape of the hair.
You can use this process for sitting poses as well. Just make sure that you
carefully observe the angles and lengths of the sections of the arms and legs.

Part IV: Color and Design

Using collages and tracing paper for painting
Sometimes you make a set of sketches and none is exactly what you want.
One section of one sketch may look great, and another section of another
sketch may look good, but none really has it pulled together. Rather than 
redrawing everything, you can use collage techniques and tracing paper to
make corrections and put together the parts of the drawings that are working.
You can use several strategies:
 Use rubber cement to fit blank paper into a drawing and rework the area.
 Trace the parts of a drawing you want to keep and continue the drawing
on the tracing paper.
 Trace parts of several drawings onto one tracing paper, or tape tracings
from several drawings together into one drawing.
 Compose tracings together to make a realistic still life, or collage parts
together to make a painting that appears to be a collage.
After you collage the parts of the drawings together for any of these options,
photocopy it so that you can clearly see your resulting drawing.
Making a master sketch from thumbnails
After you rough out several possible thumbnails for your painting and choose
the drawing that you want to paint, you need to make a master sketch and
decide which method you’ll use to transfer it to the canvas.
Refining the drawing into a master sketch can be as involved as you want to
make it, but keep in mind that the object is to develop and refine the shapes
and positions of the objects that you’re painting so that you don’t have to
make corrections on the canvas. Adding a lot of detail makes transferring the
drawing tedious, so keep it simple. You can add the details when you move to
the canvas. You also want to clarify the lines of the drawing as much as possi-
ble so that you don’t have any question about the directions and positions of
the lines when you’re transferring them. The rough nature of the thumbnails
serves their purpose quite well, but they can be confusing when you try to
transfer a drawing.
Figure 13-8:
Making a

sketch of a

201
Chapter 13: Planning Your Painting

To make sure that you have a clear drawing to transfer, use a fine-point
marker to establish the lines you want to transfer after you clean up the
thumbnail sketch.
The master sketches can be three different sizes:
 Thumbnail: If you want to use this size, simply attach a piece of tracing
paper to your thumbnail, and use a pencil to make the shapes more
clear and correct. Adding a lot of detail to a small sketch is useless, so
continue to keep it simple.
 Intermediate: Another approach is to transfer the thumbnail to a larger
drawing for refinement. You don’t have to make the new drawing as large
as the canvas. Think of this size as a step between the thumbnail and the
larger painting. In this drawing, you can develop more detail if necessary.
 Actual size: If you’re very particular about getting everything just right,
make a drawing that’s the same size as the painting. This ensures that
you see exactly how the relationships of the objects will work in the
painting. The positions of the objects of the smaller drawings can seem
different when the drawings are enlarged to the size of the paintings.
Sometimes you need to make changes to correct problems that appear
in enlargements.
Making enlargements for master drawings
Enlarging drawings is fairly easy, and you have some choices. The most
accessible method is the grid enlargement, but photocopiers and art projec-
tors are great tools to use when they’re available to you.
Photocopy enlargements
Photocopies make simple enlargements up to 11 x 17 inches very easily. In just
a few steps, you can enlarge your drawing and transfer it to another surface.
1. Make a sample copy to see whether your drawing is dark enough to copy.
If your drawing is very light to begin with, you may need to darken it
before you start. Otherwise, use the adjustment on the copier to darken
the image as much as necessary.
2. Determine what size you want the enlarged copy to be.
Most photocopiers ask you to punch in a number up to 200 percent. You
also can experiment by trying different sizes and measuring them with a
ruler.
3. Check the copy with a ruler to make sure that it’s the right size.
4. At this point, you have some choices based on the size and surfaces
that you’re working with:
• Enlargements for intermediate sketches: Cover the back of the copy
with graphite from a pencil or 2B graphite stick, and trace the drawing
onto a new sheet of drawing paper. A sharp 2H pencil is better for
tracing than a #2 pencil because it gives you a more precise line.
202
Part IV: Color and Design

• Enlargements for small, smooth painting surfaces: The procedure
is similar to the one for intermediate sketches, but use a fine coating
of charcoal rather than graphite. Avoid using graphite on painting
surfaces, because it bleeds through to the surface of the 
painting for years after the painting is finished.
• Enlargements for all other painting surfaces: Grid off the photocopy
and the canvas in proportionate squares and draw what you see in
each square. (See the simple enlargement in Figure 13-9. Instructions
for doing grid enlargements appear later in this chapter.)
Projection enlargements
Art projectors are indispensable tools if you’re planning to paint large canvases
or work regularly from photographs. You place small drawings and photographs
in the projector, and it projects the image onto your canvas. You can focus and
adjust the projection to fit the canvas and then simply draw the image onto the
canvas with a charcoal pencil. Many projectors also reduce images for you.
These projectors are valuable tools, but they can be costly. Inexpensive ver-
sions are available, but carefully research them to make sure that they fit
your needs.
Grid enlargements
Grid enlargements are a great low-tech way to make any sort of enlargement,
even enlarging a thumbnail drawing to the size of a mural on the side of a
building! It’s simple and requires little more that a ruler and a pencil. This is
how you do it:
1. Refine your thumbnail sketch so that it has clear, simple lines.
Use a fine-point marker for the final lines if you like.
2. With a ruler and pencil, draw a grid of 1-inch squares on top of your
drawing.
It’s okay if you don’t end up with a grid of whole squares. Mark off the
squares from left to right and top to bottom, with partial squares to the right
and bottom rows. (See Figure 13-9 for an example of a grid enlargement.)
3. On your canvas, divide the space into a grid of squares that corre-
sponds to the number of squares in your drawing.
If your small drawing has six squares across and four down, your canvas
should have the same. Make sure that they’re all squares — not rectangles.
If you can’t match the number of squares to the canvas, your frames are
different and you need to adjust your thumbnail drawing to match the
proportions of the canvas.
4. In each square, use your charcoal pencil to draw the lines that you
see in the corresponding square on the thumbnail.
Pay extra attention to the points where lines cross the sides and corners
of the squares.
5. Make corrections in areas where the drawing deviates from your orig-
inal, and check the total drawing to see whether you need to make
any final changes before beginning to paint.
6. Add the details that you need for painting but were too complex to
use in the preparatory drawings.
203
Chapter 13: Planning Your Painting

Project: Working Past Your 
First Idea, Step by Step
This project pulls together all the information we present in this chapter into
one process for preparing to paint.
1. Collect ten objects that you want to try to paint.
Later on, you’re going to narrow it down and choose five to paint.
2. Spend some time trying different combinations of objects in still life
setups.
3. Choose the five objects you want to paint based on the way they look
together in the still life setup.
4. Set the rectangle for your viewfinder.
If you already have a canvas, set your viewfinder to the same proportions
as your canvas. If you don’t, consider the shape you want. Is it going to
be square or rectangular? Remember to set it so that you can use a stan-
dard-size canvas if you plan to purchase something ready made.
5. Draw six rectangles — all the same size — to use as frames for your
thumbnails.
6. Arrange the objects in six different setups, making a thumbnail sketch
of each before going to the next.
Try both vertical and horizontal sketches. Fill the frame with each drawing.
7. If you don’t like the setups, make changes until you find one that you
do like.
8. Make corrections or use collage techniques to work out any problems
on a drawing you like.

Part IV: Color and Design

9. Tape a piece of tracing paper over the thumbnail drawing you want to
use for your painting.
10. Trace the drawing onto the tracing paper, working to refine the edges
of the objects in the drawing.
11. When the edges are clear, trace the lines with a fine-point marker.
Don’t forget to trace the frame. This is your master drawing.
12. Draw a grid of 1-inch squares on the master drawing.
13. Grid the canvas, dividing it into the same number of squares as the
master drawing.
14. Using a charcoal pencil, draw the lines in each square of the master
drawing into the corresponding square on the canvas.
15. Stand back and check the overall drawing; make corrections and add
details as necessary.
Now you’re ready to paint.

Shape, Space, and the Surface
of Your Painting
In This Chapter
 Choosing the shape of your painting
 Looking at your subject and its background
 Designing an interesting composition
I
f you plan to build a house, at some point you have to move from tinkering
with blueprints to digging a foundation. When you dig the foundation, you
set the footprint for the basic structure of the house. You set its size, basic
design, space, and other characteristics that won’t change as the house is
built. If you skip this step and start building on bare earth, eventually the
house will fall down.
Just as you’d design and dig a foundation for a house, you make design deci-
sions for the foundation of your painting. Shape, size, surface, and space are
four design decisions that artists make about every painting. They’re the first
decisions that you make, and they determine the most basic look of your fin-
ished work. This chapter helps you make these decisions deliberately instead
of building your painting on bare earth.
Thinking about the Size of Your Painting
In Chapter 13, we talk about the preparations that you need to make before
you begin your canvas. As you begin these preparations, one of the first deci-
sions you have to make is the shape and size of your painting. Ideally, you
should tie these decisions to the way you want your viewers to respond to
your subject matter, but other factors can influence these decisions as well.
When you think about the size of your painting, think about how its scale
affects your subject matter and the way your intended audience will respond
to it. A large painting can have a powerful impact just because it’s big, but a
painting the size of a postcard can be very powerful as well.
Here are a couple of size-related terms to keep in mind:
 Scale is the size of an object, especially in relation to other objects.
 Proportion is the size of a part of an object in relation to other parts of
the same object.

Here are some things to consider when you’re deciding the size of your
painting:
 What size is appropriate for your subject matter? Ideally, you want to
size your painting so that its size is part of the way you want your viewer
to respond to the work. Small paintings pull your viewer in. They invite
your audience to step closer to them. Large paintings can have a power-
ful presence. It’s not often someone says a painting is too large, but a
painting can easily be too small. A small painting seduces its audience
into moving closer to look at it, but at a great risk of disappointing them.
 Where will this painting be displayed? Of course, having grand aspira-
tions that your work will be collected by museums is nice, but your work
doesn’t have to be large to be collected by a museum. It’s more impor-
tant to concentrate on quality than size. Beyond that, what you’re really
considering is who your audience will be. If your audience is your family
and friends, size the work to hang in a home. On the other hand, if your
painting is intended for a public space, like the lobby of a concert hall, it
needs to be large enough to create a presence in the space. Otherwise, it
will be lost.
 What’s your skill level? When you first start out, working in the small to
medium range is best — at least until you understand what you’re doing.
Very large and very small paintings take more skill. Complex subject
matter, like a complicated still life, is easier for you to tackle on a larger
canvas. A simpler subject, like a portrait, may be easier to paint at a size
between two-thirds and life size.
 How much time do you have to paint your painting? Large paintings
and very tiny paintings generally take a lot of time to do right. Being
ambitious is good, but remember that in the beginning, your skills will
advance more quickly if you do a lot of work instead of getting bogged
down in one large painting for a long time.
 What kind of budget have you set aside for painting? Large canvases
and paints to cover them are expensive. If you’re on a smaller budget,
you’ll make more progress doing a series of small works that don’t cost
as much.
 How much space do you have to paint and store large canvases?
Paintings take up space. If your space is limited, you have several
options other than giving up large canvases. Staple canvas to the wall to
paint it and roll it up after it dries. You can also work on gesso-covered
paper or on pieces of paper pieced together. If you must insist on
stretched canvas, you may have to downsize the work or become very
generous to your friends and family.
Framing Your Painting
Most people think of picture frames as actual wood or metal that you put on
a finished painting. Another kind of picture frame represents the shape of
your picture. Picture frames can be the edge of your canvas or the rectangle
you draw to make a rough sketch. They define the edges of your pictures.
208
Part IV: Color and Design 

A picture frame contains your subject matter into a specific area. Sometimes
the picture frame is the edge of the artwork. Other times, the picture frame is
a specific line drawn around the image area. A picture frame can be square,
rectangular, or any other shape you can imagine. The shape of your picture
frame should have a connection to your subject matter.
The edge of your canvas is always the picture frame for your painting, but
you have to think about it a little differently when you’re making a drawing to
plan your painting. If you don’t actually draw a picture frame to define your
image area, the entire sheet of paper can become your image area. Making
drawings without drawn picture frames is possible, and often desirable, but
when you’re making preparatory drawings for your painting, working with a
drawn frame is best.
Your viewfinder also acts as a picture frame. When you hold it up to view
your setup, it eliminates everything except the area that you plan to paint or
draw. In this case, its inside edge acts as the picture frame.
Classic shapes
The shapes of some picture frames recall certain types of images before you
even start making rough sketches for them. That doesn’t mean that they’re
the only kinds of pictures that you can put in those particular frames; it just
means that you’ve seen enough paintings of that type of image and shape
that you’ve begun to associate them with each other. For example:
 An oval frame is associated with portraiture.
 A long, horizontal frame is associated with a panoramic landscape.
 A tall, vertical frame is associated with tall subjects, such as skyscrapers
and trees.
 Circular frames don’t suggest specific objects, but they do suggest that
you may see a strong focus on something, as if through a telescope.
Figure 14-1 shows examples of classic frames.
Neutral shapes
Some shapes are so neutral that they’re like vanilla ice cream; you can put
anything in them.
Of course, you can find many variations on rectangles, but not all are neutral.
The preceding section mentions two that are very suggestive. The panoramic
view and the tall vertical have extreme differences between height and width.
Almost all rectangles are neutral, however, and you can use them either direc-
tion. The most common neutral rectangle you can find is your 12-x-16-inch
drawing pad, which is a 3 to 4 ratio.
209
Chapter 14: Shape, Space, and the Surface of Your Painting

Squares are interesting shapes that have much of the flexibility of rectangles,
except that you can’t turn them in different directions. (Well, you can, but
you won’t be able to tell the difference!) They’re a little more difficult to work
with, but the resulting compositions can be very pleasing. 
Figure 14-2 shows examples of neutral frames.
Irregularly shaped images
Artists have always painted images within frames that aren’t exactly classic
shapes. The surfaces that artists want to paint on aren’t always configured in
convenient rectangular forms. Some paintings conform to the shapes of exist-
ing spaces in church architecture; others are circular or arch shaped. In con-
temporary times, some artists have made abstract art on shaped canvases.
Other artists have pared away the backgrounds in their paintings so that all
that’s left is their subject matter.
A shaped canvas is any painting without a rectangular picture frame. The
term has a long history of being applied to circles, ovals, diamonds, and
other traditional shapes that aren’t rectangular. But in the last two decades,
it’s been closely associated with extremely irregular shapes. All, however, are
shaped canvases.

Part IV: Color and Design 

Although most traditional picture frames are like windowpanes onto a scene,
the irregularly shaped canvas has had an active part in how people view the
painting. The picture frame actually contributes to the message that the artist
is trying to convey. Frank Stella, Alex Katz, and Elizabeth Murray are good
artists to study if you’re interested in doing an irregularly shaped canvas.
Project: Experimenting with your
viewfinder to decide the shape 
of your painting
Use this exercise to help you choose the right shape and size for your paint-
ing when you don’t already have a canvas on hand. For this exercise, you use
another type of viewfinder.
First you’re going to make a bracketed viewfinder. This viewfinder is two “L”
shaped pieces of cardboard that you can position to make any rectangle you
like. You can also set it up in the same proportions as the picture frames of
your sketches and canvases. Make sure that you use a stiff board so that it
doesn’t droop over while you’re using it.
1. Use your pencil and ruler to measure and draw a line 3 inches from
the outside edge of a 15-x-20-inch piece of stiff board in a neutral
color; you end up with two “L” shapes, as shown in Figure 14-3.
2. Cut out the two “L” shapes.
If you’re cutting them with a utility knife, protect your table by putting a
cutting mat or piece of board under your cutting area. This protection
also gives you a cleaner, neater cut. If your board isn’t very heavy, you
can use scissors to cut out the “L” shapes.
3. Line up your ruler on each inside edge of the “L” so that the zero is
on the inside corner and mark off the inches, half inches, and quarter
inches.
Mark the measurements on both “L” shapes.
4. Set your viewfinder so that the corners are square, and tape them
together with two pieces of masking tape.
If you want to set up your viewfinder for a 12-x-16-inch picture frame, set
your “Ls” so that they make a rectangle crossing at the 3- and 4-inch
marks. Always attach them using a temporary method, like tape, so that
you can reuse them in different configurations.
5. Set up a still life with any objects you want to use and try several pos-
sible frames for paintings.
Set up your viewfinder as squares, long horizontal rectangles, long verti-
cal rectangles, and other variations on rectangles. Also, try looking at
the still life from different points of view.

Chapter 14: Shape, Space, and the Surface of Your Painting

Considering Both the Background
and Subject
After you make your rough sketches and you know the size and shape of your
painting, you’re ready to start drawing your subject matter onto the surface
of your canvas. As you start drawing these shapes on your canvas, you make
decisions about how you want your viewer to understand the space in your
painting. Your painting is two-dimensional. It has a height and width, but no
depth — only the surface. When you make marks on your canvas to create a
subject and background, you start to create an illusion of depth in the image,
and you divide the surface of the painting into patterns.
Illusion of depth means that viewers “read” a two-dimensional picture as having
depth when it’s clearly flat. Pattern is the relationships of the lines, shapes,
values, and colors in the design of your drawings and paintings. For example, a
value pattern is the relationship of the lights and darks in your painting.
Working with positive and negative space
When you begin to draw your subject onto the surface of your canvas, you
divide the space in your painting into subject and background. If you expand
this idea a bit, you can consider your subject matter to be the foreground and
everything behind it the background. In the image on the left in Figure 14-2,
you can see that the black silhouette of the girl is the subject, or foreground,
and the white space around her is the background. In the image on the right,
the black and white is reversed but the girl is still the subject and foreground,
while the black area behind her is the background.
When you speak in these terms, you’re talking about your image as though it
has three-dimensional qualities. What if you squished the whole thing flat like
a bug, though, so that it all seemed to exist on one paper-thin surface? Then
you’re thinking of your image as being more like a design of abstract pat-
terns. Everything that would have been your subject matter becomes the pos-
itive space, and your background becomes the negative space. In the images
Figure 14-3:
Use this
layout to cut
out a
bracketed
viewfinder.
212
Part IV: Color and Design 

in Figure 14-4, the silhouettes are flattened, abstract forms that have no
three-dimensional qualities. The black figure in the image on the left is the
positive space in the composition. The black background in the image on the
right is the negative space in the composition.
Positive space is the shape and pattern made by the subject in a composition.
Synonyms for the positive space are figure and foreground. Negative space
refers to the shape and pattern of the background. A synonym for the nega-
tive space is the ground.
The interaction of the patterns made by the shapes your positive and nega-
tive spaces is the heart of what makes your painting designed well. They are
two parts of a whole and you want them to relate to each other in a comple-
mentary way, like a good marriage. When viewers enter a room and see your
painting from a distance, they see the design and the way the patterns inter-
act with each other in an abstract way long before they see your subject
matter or how well you painted it.
If you look at your composition as a set of white shapes against a dark field,
you can easily see how your positive and negative spaces interact with each
other. If these patterns are interesting, you likely have a strong composition.
If they put you to sleep, you may have some work to do.
We encourage you to work general to specific. If you establish strong basic
patterns in your positive and negative spaces early in the painting process,
the composition of the painting will be strong when you’re ready to refine the
details in the painting.
Activating the entire composition
We advise you throughout this book to arrange your compositions so that
objects touch the edge of your picture frame or seem to continue outside the
painting. By giving you this advice, we’re trying to encourage you to activate
your entire composition. When we say activate, we merely mean that you
should arrange the parts of your composition so that it looks like you consid-
ered every area of the composition, including the outer edges, as you
designed it.

Chapter 14: Shape, Space, and the Surface of Your Painting

Plopping your subject matter in the middle of your composition and starting to
paint is so easy, but it rarely makes a strong composition. Sometimes that sort
of composition looks like a photograph taken from too far away. The subject
looks lost or as if it’s floating in a void. The background can overwhelm or com-
pete with your subject matter so that it looks weak. For example, if you jump
forward to Figure 14-6 you see how a cluster of objects can seem to float in the
composition, but if you make the change shown in the image on the right in the
figure, framing the image in closer, the entire composition is active. 
Shaping your background
One of the most effective things that you can do to make a strong composi-
tion is pay attention to the shapes in the negative space in your setup.
Focusing on the arrangements of your objects may seem more logical, but
you can’t rely on that method alone. Ideally, you should alternate between
looking at the relationships of your objects and looking at the shapes that
you’re making with your background.
The simplest way to check the relationship between your positive and nega-
tive spaces is to make a rough thumbnail sketch of your setup and blacken in
the background or negative space by filling it in with a soft graphite pencil.
Don’t be satisfied with whatever result you happen to get. The only way to
improve is by challenging yourself. Be objective, examine your sketch, and
answer these questions:
 Is your sketch compelling? Does it hold your attention? Can you point
to areas that are particularly effective?
 How much black is in the composition? If more than half of the compo-
sition is black, look at the shapes and determine whether they’re appeal-
ing. If the black shapes are large and lackluster, they can act like a black
hole, sucking the energy out of your work. You may need to tweak the
positions of your objects to make the shapes more varied or add some
objects to break the spaces up.
 Does the black negative space touch large sections of, or the entire,
picture frame? Long channels of negative spaces that run down the sides
of the composition without breaking are called gutters. If your sketch has
gutters, you may need to frame the composition closer to your subject
matter to improve the balance of positive and negative spaces.
 Do you have a variety of shapes in the composition? Can you find a bal-
ance of large areas versus small, broken-up areas? Or can you find areas
that have mass versus areas that are linear?
Figures 14-5, 14-6, and 14-7 show some examples of negative space problems
and simple fixes.

Chapter 14: Shape, Space, and the Surface of Your Painting

Here are some general guidelines that you can use to create strong interac-
tions between your positive and negative spaces:
 Make a conscious effort to create interesting shapes in your negative
space.
 Look for ways to break up large, uninspiring areas of negative space.
 Try to create an interesting pattern that balances large shapes with
smaller, broken-up shapes.
 Try to create a balance of shapes that have mass with shapes that have
linear qualities.
 Pay attention to the edges of your composition, especially the sides.
Pulling It All Together: Shape, Space,
and Surface at Work
In the previous section, you look at positive space as the subject and nega-
tive space as the background. You divide positive and negative space into
black and white areas based on whether the area is an object or the area
around an object. In the thumbnail sketches, you leave the objects white and
fill in the background with black. This method is extremely helpful in organiz-
ing the placement of your subject matter, but you need to take it a step fur-
ther to be able to fully apply it to your painting.
You aren’t likely to make paintings of white figures on a black background, so
you have to use these concepts in a slightly different way. When you look at
paintings by Caravaggio and Rembrandt, you see that they painted striking
contrasts between light and dark areas. The value patterns are very strong,
but the dark values aren’t confined only to the figures or only to the back-
grounds. You find dark areas in both, and sometimes the values in areas of
the figure and areas of the background are so similar that finding the edge of
the figure is difficult.
Chiaroscuro is a term that refers to the way artists use values of light and
dark to make an object or figure look three-dimensional. Tenebrism is a dra-
matic form of chiaroscuro, where the range of values is limited to very light
lights and very dark darks, almost like a high-contrast photograph. The artist
Caravaggio is known for using tenebrism in his work.
These patterns of light and dark provide another opportunity for you to look
at positive and negative spaces in your painting. Making a rough thumbnail
sketch of your setup and then paring down the value patterns to the extreme
lights and darks gives you a chance to examine the overall pattern in your
composition. (Check out Figure 14-8 a little later in this chapter.) You evaluate
this new sketch by using the same questions we give you in the earlier
“Shaping your background” section, but this time you have a better sense
of what your final painting will look like.
216
Part IV: Color and Design 

Project: A high-contrast sketch
In this project, you work through the process of making a sketch that concen-
trates on value pattern in addition to figure and ground.
1. Arrange a still life setup with light-colored objects.
2. Darken the room and put a strong, directed light on your setup from
the side.
The lighting for this exercise is important, so arrange it carefully.
(Consult Chapter 13 for help setting up a still life.)
3. Use your viewfinder to find the area you plan to sketch.
4. Determine the size of your thumbnail sketch, and lay out the picture
frame for your sketch on a piece of paper.
The information we provide earlier in this chapter will help you.
5. With a 4B or softer 6B pencil, make a rough sketch of your setup as
you look through your viewfinder.
See Figure 14-8 for an example and Chapter 13 for additional help.
6. Observe the shapes of the shadows in the setup and lightly draw the
shapes of all the shadows that are darker than middle gray and fall on
the objects in your rough sketch.
7. Draw the shapes of all the shadows cast by the objects.
Figure 14-9 shows you how the shapes of the shadows were drawn into
the rough sketch. In some areas the shadows change gradually without a
clear edge. Use your best judgment in finding the shape, or change your
lighting to get higher contrast between the light and dark areas.
Figure 14-8:
Make a

your setup.
217
Chapter 14: Shape, Space, and the Surface of Your Painting

8. Blacken in all the areas that are middle gray and darker. 
If you have dark areas in your background — from cast shadows or
simply a dark background — there may be some shadowed areas of your
objects that blend with the dark background. That’s okay. It’s tenebrism
at its best. If, however, you lose too much of the form of the object, look
closely to see if you can use a bit of white edge in the form to separate
the object from its background.
Figure 14-10 shows you what your finished high-contrast drawing might
look like. If you like, outline these areas to more clearly define the
shapes before you fill them in.
9. Examine your value pattern drawing using the questions from
“Shaping your background,” earlier in this chapter, and make
changes as needed.

How the Parts of a Composition
Work Together
In This Chapter
 Looking at the core concepts of good design in painting
 Arranging more-compelling compositions
 Creating strong focal points
W
hat is your most beautiful possession? Maybe it’s art, but it could just
as easily be furniture, a dress, or a sports car. Look at it and consider
what qualities most mesmerize you. Is it the curve of its line, the contrast of
its colors, or the way its shapes fit together? Whatever those characteristics
are, they share elements of design that are part of everything people make,
whether it’s an everyday object or the finest painting. Design is about creat-
ing and arranging the parts of an object.
Talented designers have abilities that may seem magical, but those abilities
aren’t magic. Designers have skills that can be learned. The same is true of
painters. Paintings aren’t just painted, they’re designed. The skills that you
need to design a painting can also be learned, and with practice, you can
design an impressive painting as well as anyone.
This chapter lays out the basics of arranging the parts of your composition
and discusses how to see those parts.
Getting the Big Picture
In art schools, sometimes you hear it said that a museum visitor spends only
about eight seconds in front of any given painting. We could quibble over the
number of seconds, but the major point is true. Artists have a very limited
amount of time to snag their viewers’ attention and entice them to linger in
front of their artwork.
Think about what happens when you enter a gallery. You immediately scan
the room for something enticing. You don’t necessarily want to walk to the
nearest painting and work your way around the room spending equal
amounts of time in front of each one. How do you accept or eliminate the
works that you want to view in just a split-second glance?

You make these decisions the same way that you’re able to recognize your
best friend walking halfway down a beach. When you look at paintings, or
anything else for that matter, you see its overall patterns of shapes, values,
and colors — its design — before you see the details. If you create a painting
that has a strong overall design and carries well at a distance, you can engage
your viewer quickly.
The whole is greater than 
the sum of the parts
The success of the compositions of your paintings relies on creating relation-
ships that glue the parts together. Without these relationships, your composi-
tions can seem chaotic and disorganized, like a roomful of people playing a
game without rules.
Think of a time when you were part of a successful group effort. Maybe it was
a sports team or a project for a charity. Everyone had a job to do, and every-
one did those jobs well. As a result, the group’s efforts rose above what each
person may have contributed individually.
You can see this effect in the classroom as well. The energy of a group of stu-
dents working in the same room is much greater than the energy of the same
group working independently. So much so that the stronger skills of the group
actually raise the skills of those who are weaker.
Of course, these examples refer to experiences, but they relate closely to the
way you understand what you see. It’s all about relationships. People working
together rather than independently accomplish more, even if they’re doing the
same work. When you look at a building, you see its whole before you see its
parts because those parts have a structural relationship. You see the whole of
anything at first glance because the relationships of the parts are gluing them
together. You have to make an effort to see most things as individual parts
strung together.
The term for the study of how people process what they see and experience
is gestalt, a German word referring to “pattern” or “form.” It’s generally con-
sidered to include the way you experience the whole of something before the
parts. Artists have borrowed a number of ideas from Gestalt psychology to
explain how viewers see the parts of a composition. The majority of this
chapter is devoted to gestalt concepts and how you can use them to create
better compositions for your paintings.
The devil in the details
You can easily be seduced into concentrating on painting just the objects
when you’re first learning to paint. You’re still finding your way, and some-
times the challenge of trying to get something “right” just takes over. Moving
to another area is hard when things are going well with the area you’re work-
ing on. But none of this is in the best interest of your painting or your
progress as a painter.
220
Part IV: Color and Design 

It bears repeating that you’re more likely to create a strong design if you work
general to specific. When you develop your big shapes and patterns and
slowly refine them down to specific details, you’re creating the relationships
you need to hold the composition of your painting together. We’ve made it
our mantra because it’s one of the hardest habits to develop as a beginning
painter. If you allow yourself to concentrate on the details at the expense of
the total design, your painting will be weak.
You may argue that you can paint only one object at a time. That’s true, but
you want to bring your painting up in layers, like building a house. You visit
every part several times, rather than once or twice. A construction crew
doesn’t finish the front of the house before putting sheathing on the other
sides; the workers add layer after layer over the entire building. To make your
painting strong, build your painting the way you’d build a house, layer by layer.
Project: Blurring details to see 
the overall composition better
Blurring paintings and photographs is a good way to learn to see the basic
design rather than concentrating on details. If you’re computer savvy and
have access to Adobe Photoshop, you can posterize the image to pare it
down to the basic shapes and patterns (Figure 15-1 shows an example). When
you posterize an image, you turn it into something similar to a paint-by-
number image. The computer breaks the image down into a specific number
of values, which you select. To give it a try, follow these steps:
1. Scan or open your image as a Photoshop document.
2. Make a copy that you can play with by choosing File ➪Save As.
Don’t work on your original document.
3. Convert your image to grayscale by choosing Image ➪Mode ➪
Grayscale.
4. Posterize your image by choosing Image ➪Adjustments ➪Posterize.
When you select Posterize, you’re asked to select the number of steps
from white to black that you want to see. When you plug in a number, you
immediately see the effect of the posterization. Plugging in “2” makes a
high-contrast black and white image. Plugging in “3” gives you black,
white, and middle gray. Experiment with several different numbers.
5. If you want to save and print your posterized image, do so.
If working with a computer isn’t your deal, you can do this project a couple of
alternative ways:
 If you’re working with a still life setup and have a camera that you can
manually focus, try looking at your setup out of focus.
 Make rough pencil sketches of pictures in a manner similar to the
painted value pattern sketch of a master work described in Chapter 14.
Rather than painting the image, use a soft pencil (4B or softer) to make a
high-contrast black and white sketch concentrating on basic shapes.
(Figure 15-2 shows you an example of this kind of sketch.)
221
Chapter 15: How the Parts of a Composition Work Together

How You See the Parts
Fortunately, you don’t have to rely solely on your intuition to be able to make a
solid arrangement for your painting. Human brains are wonderful machines,
and they do act in somewhat predictable patterns. Scientists and psychologists
have been able to identify specific ways that the brain processes what the

contrast

photograph.
222
Part IV: Color and Design 

viewer sees. Artists have always used these ideas when they made their
artwork, but only relatively recently has a scientific basis for their work been
established.
You need to know only a few gestalt concepts to help you create solid compo-
sitions for your painting. They aren’t hard to understand. Chapter 14 tells you
how to use picture frames in your artwork. That discussion is about the
gestalt concept of containment. You need to know only a few others: similar-
ity, proximity, and continuation. As you work through this chapter, you will
see how you can use these concepts to create strong compositions.
Harmony or chaos?
Human brains are natural sorters. During the course of your day, your brain
constantly sorts what you see into what’s known and familiar and what’s dif-
ferent and unfamiliar. Things that are different catch your eye, while you may
simply glance over something that you’re familiar with.
Most people like a little predictability. The similarity of your daily routine gives
you stability in your life. Similarity creates harmony and peace. Too much simi-
larity, however, creates monotony and boredom. Having cereal and milk for
breakfast may be part of your routine every morning, but what if you had to eat
cereal and milk for lunch and dinner every day, as well? Your diet needs some
constants, but you also need variation to make it interesting and healthy.
On the other hand, too much difference is chaotic and upsetting. What if you
lived in a war zone and had no idea what might happen next or where your
next meal might come from? The only constant is that there is no constant.
Too much difference is chaos.
As in life, paintings need some similarity to create harmony and hold the
parts together, but they also need difference to create a little spice. One way
that you can use this concept in a composition is by balancing objects and
shapes that are similar to each other with some that are different. Those
objects that are similar to each other help hold the composition together,
while the objects that are different make it interesting.
The parts of a composition that have similar characteristics tend to group
and help hold a composition together. This gestalt concept is called
similarity. Similarity creates harmony in the composition. Too much similar-
ity, however, creates monotony. It is best to balance similarity with difference
to create interest.
In Figure 15-3, you see three compositions. On the far left is a composition
made only of similar objects. In the middle is a composition made of very dif-
ferent objects. On the far right is a composition that attempts to create a bal-
ance between similar objects and different objects.
Keep in mind that the ideas of harmony and chaos aren’t limited to objects.
They apply also to color, value, line, and texture. For example, using a single
hue can create a monotonous painting, but varying its values and intensities
and adding a contrasting hue can make a striking painting.
223
Chapter 15: How the Parts of a Composition Work Together

Project: Composing similar objects 
and different objects
In this exercise, you create three compositions that are similar to those you
see in Figure 15-3. After creating a setup for each composition, draw it if you
like, or simply photograph it with a digital camera. For each setup, select and
arrange five objects for a possible still life painting.
1. Decide on a picture frame size and shape for all three compositions.
You will use the same picture frame for all three compositions.
Make sure that you orient them the same direction, horizontal or verti-
cal. Refer to Chapter 14 for more information if you need help setting up.
2. Select five objects that are exactly the same — the same size, shape,
and color — and arrange them in a setup.
3. Draw or photograph your first setup.
4. Select five objects that aren’t similar in any way — not in shape, size,
or color.
Make these objects as different as possible.
5. Arrange the five dissimilar objects in a setup and draw or photo-
graph it.
6. Choose five different objects for the final setup, but look for similari-
ties in three of them.
You may want to choose different objects that have similar shapes. For
example, maybe they’re all cylindrical containers, but they’re different
sizes and have variations in the cylindrical shapes.
7. Arrange these five objects in a setup and draw or photograph it.
8. Compare your drawings or photographs.
Does each fit the criteria well? The answer affects how you see them.
Which is more interesting to you? Why?

Part IV: Color and Design 

The glue that holds the parts together
The next time you go to a park, look at the people. Some are likely walking in
pairs or groups while others are sitting or walking alone. What kind of
assumptions do you make about these people? You may think that the groups
of people are family or friends on an outing, or you may assume that the
people off by themselves have no relationship to the others and actually
want to be left alone. What clues lead you to think that? Your most important
clue is the proximity of the people to each other. If all the people were evenly
spaced from each other, it would take you a while to determine what their
relationships were. Or maybe you’d assume that they’re all together, because
it would be unlikely that they arranged themselves that way on their own.
This gestalt concept is called proximity. When you place objects in your paint-
ings close to each other, you see them as a group. Their closeness causes them
to form a bond that’s very similar to two magnets attracting each other. If you
space the objects too far apart, they can seem farther away from each other
than they actually are. Even worse, they can form a void, or big hole, in the
composition. Figure 15-4 shows you objects that form a group on the left, and
objects that are so far apart that they create a void on the right.
You don’t want to overdo this concept. If you cluster your objects together
like a litter of puppies, your objects may seem too much like a single mass
and you won’t be able to take advantage of what your negative spaces can
contribute to the composition. (Figure 15-5 shows you the problem with plac-
ing your objects too close together; on the right, you see how to combat this
problem and create interesting negative space.) Ideally, you should space
your objects closely enough to create an interesting tension in the work, but
not so closely that you’re doing all the visual work for your viewer. It’s okay
for some of the objects to touch each other, but spread out most of the
objects. Experiment to see how far away from the others you can place an
object and still maintain its membership in the group.

225
Chapter 15: How the Parts of a Composition Work Together

Always consider the shapes of the negative spaces in your composition when
you try various placements for your objects.
Project: Spacing objects
together and apart
This exercise is an experiment in seeing what you can get away with. You cut
several silhouettes of objects out of black paper and place them in various
positions within a picture frame. Then you position them in the frame, trying
different placements. Some placements cause the silhouettes to group. See
how far apart you can place them and still maintain a relationship with the
rest of the silhouettes. See the example in Figure 15-6, and follow these steps:
1. Use a ruler and pencil to rule a 9-x-12-inch picture frame on a sheet of
drawing paper, and then set it aside.
2. Choose five still life objects that work well together, and draw their
silhouettes without interior details on black paper.
Any sort of black paper will do. Make sure that you don’t make your
objects too big. The largest should be no larger than 6 inches and the
rest should be sized in relationship to the largest one.
3. Use scissors to cut out the silhouettes.
4. Start positioning silhouette shapes in your picture frame by playing
with that magnetic characteristic that shapes develop when they’re
placed near each other.
Not sure how to do that? Follow these guidelines:
a. Choose your large silhouette shape and put it to the left in your
frame.
b. Choose a medium-sized shape and place it next to the large shape.
c. Pull the medium shape a little farther to the right. Does it still look
like it is grouped with the large shape? Unless you pulled it too far
away, it should.

d. Pull it a little farther away. Does it still look like it is grouped?
e. Keep pulling the medium-sized shape away until you’re certain that
they look like two independent shapes. See how far away the two
shapes can be and still look like they’re grouped together. At what
point does the shape change from grouping with the large shape to
being an independent shape?
5. Gather the rest of your shapes and make some really bad compositions.
The goal is to just get it out of your system!
a. Group the objects together as a cluster in the center; look at the
shapes of the cluster and the negative space.
b. Divide the group so that you have a smaller group of three touch-
ing the left edge and another group of two touching the right edge.
More than likely you have a big space in the middle that isn’t doing
anything. Does it look like you scraped everything to the sides?
c. Line up your shapes in a row. The top half of your composition
may have some interesting negative space, but the white space
below the line of the shapes probably isn’t doing anything. It’s a
dead area in your composition.
6. Try to make at least six interesting compositions.
We can’t tell you where to place the shapes because we can’t see your
shapes, but try some ideas while you work. Try to be adventuresome.
It’s only paper and you can push it around! Try some of these tips:
• Let some of the shapes go outside your picture frame.
• Position the shapes so that none of the negative spaces between
them are equal.
• Try to make the negative space in the bottom half of the composi-
tion as interesting as the top half.
• Mix narrow, linear negative spaces with wide, irregular negative
spaces.
• Try not to allow more than three shapes to touch each other in one
group.

Chapter 15: How the Parts of a Composition Work Together

How the parts interact with each other
Compositions are living things. While you’re working on them, the way you
perceive the relationships of the parts is constantly changing. Every time you
add a shape, color, value, line, or texture, the relationships within the compo-
sition change.
Focal points are areas of the composition that attract the eye. Major focal
points or primary focal points are the areas that attract the eye first and usu-
ally are associated with the main subject matter or idea of the painting.
Secondary focal points are areas that keep your eye moving through the com-
position and elaborate on the main idea of the painting.
When you look at a composition, your eye begins in one area — the major
focal point — and then moves to other areas around the composition. Some
of these other areas are secondary focal points. When you have more than
one secondary focal point, what determines where you look after you see the
major focal point? 
Proximity can determine where the eye moves away from the major focal
point to a secondary one, but another factor is the gestalt concept of continu-
ation. It’s a lot like a magic trick. Your eye makes things seem whole by clos-
ing up or making a leap across spaces when nothing is there. A very simple
example is the idea of the implied line. In Figure 15-7, you can see that the line
seems whole even though a big chunk is missing out of it.
Another example refers to what you assume when two shapes overlap. (In
Figure 15-8, you assume that the shape in the back continues to the other
side of the shape in the front.) You assume that a shape continues behind the
object and directly out the other side, but nothing there says that it didn’t
take a little side trip in the meantime. Human brains close up those areas,
making them seem to continue uninterrupted.
Figure 15-7:

whole even
though large
portions are

228
Part IV: Color and Design 

When you look at a composition, the combination of primary and secondary
focal points and the kinds of visual lines you establish with your shapes lead
your eye around. An example is Michelangelo’s God Creating Adam on the ceil-
ing of the Sistine Chapel. A line is established by the figures with their out-
stretched arms, but their hands never touch. You mentally make a leap across,
closing up the two sides of the composition. In a more extreme example, try
having two friends point at each other. (Make sure that you can see them both
at the same time.) You’ll see an implied line connecting the two of them.
You can establish lines with edges of forms, pointing fingers, the limbs of a
tree, a row of street lamps — anything that establishes a direction for your
eye to follow. These linear elements work subliminally to create movement in
the work and lay a path for your eyes to follow while you explore the work.
Continuation is a gestalt concept that refers to the way your eyes close up
areas that are visually fragmented, making them seem to be whole.
Avoiding common errors in placement
The following sections show you how to avoid some common errors when
you’re creating your arrangement. Of course, the minute you set up a “rule,”
someone finds an exception to it. These are general guidelines. Feel free to
take any of them and make an interesting painting out of it.
Avoid lineups
Don’t line up shapes so that their edges seem to continue from one to
another. Offset them a bit to separate them and shape your negative space
better (see Figure 15-9).

Chapter 15: How the Parts of a Composition Work Together

Stay out of the corners
Avoid placing shapes in the corners of your picture frame — they’ll look
glued there. Bring them away from the corner a bit (see Figure 15-10).
Watch your small shapes
Avoid cropping shapes too narrowly outside the picture frame. The small
shapes it creates direct your viewer’s eye outside your work (see Figure
15-11). Remember that you’re trying to keep your viewers engaged — not
send them packing to the painting next to yours.
Along the same line, avoid bringing distracting little shapes in from the sides
(see Figure 15-12). Small shapes, no matter whether they are singles or clus-
ters, attract the eye. You don’t want to inadvertently establish a focal point
at an edge of your composition. It will direct the viewer’s eye outside the
composition.

Keep off the bottom
Avoid lining all your objects up on the bottom of your picture frame (see
Figure 15-13). Occasionally you can break this rule if you have a good reason,
like you’re painting a shelf of bottles.
Also avoid placing all your shapes at the bottom of your frame and leaving a
lot of empty space at the top — unless of course you’re painting a landscape
with a lot of sky (see Figure 15-14).

Strive for balance
Don’t cluster all your shapes to one side without balancing the composition
in some way on the other side (see Figure 15-15).

Part IV: Color and Design 

Watch the background behind people
If you’re painting people, be aware of the positions of the things behind and
around them (see Figure 15-16). You don’t want anything to appear to be
growing out of their heads.
Place objects with authority
Don’t make wishy-washy, careless placements (see Figure 15-17). If you mean
to place something in the middle of your composition, make sure it looks like
it’s in the middle. If you want to place it to the side, make sure that it doesn’t
look like you wanted it to be in the middle.
Creating Effective Focal Points
Most paintings have some sort of system of focal points, but not all. Jackson
Pollock, who dripped paint on canvas laid out on the floor, made many paint-
ings without obvious focal points. In fact, many contemporary artists make
paintings without any focal points at all. Most of these artists make abstract
work.
Almost all realistic work has focal points because it has recognizable subject
matter. Viewers naturally look for the main idea of the painting, and a well-
designed system of focal points steer them toward understanding what the

placements.

233
Chapter 15: How the Parts of a Composition Work Together

work is about. It also helps them find their way around the painting and
enrich their viewing experience.
Making realistic work without major focal points is possible. Think of wallpa-
per. It’s designed to provide a background for your furnishings — even the
boldest wallpaper you can find probably doesn’t have a major focal point. If a
wallpaper design provides a major focal point for the room — and some do —
you have to design the room around it. Some realistic artwork reads much like
wallpaper. (And that’s not a statement about the quality of the work!) An exam-
ple in book illustration is the Where’s Waldo? series. The work has some minor
focal points, to be sure, but if it was composed the way you normally compose
an image, there wouldn’t be much of a series. You’d find Waldo quite quickly,
and that would be the end of it.
Shiny objects and other devices that
demand your attention
Why are your eyes attracted to sparkling diamond rings, strobe lights, yellow
school buses, waving arms, and fluorescent-colored paper? In short, they’re
very different from their surroundings. Glittery objects reflect more light than
their surroundings. Bright colors also do that, but to a lesser degree.
Movement stands out in an area that’s static. Human brains are constantly
evaluating their surroundings for what’s similar, and thus familiar, and what’s
different. If something is different, your eye goes to it. This characteristic
keeps you out of a lot of trouble, but it also enriches your life, keeping it from
being too mundane.
When you look at paintings and other artwork, this same behavior deter-
mines how you experience the work. If artists want an area of a painting
to catch your eye, they make that area different from the other areas.
Sometimes, they make the value different or use a brighter color. Maybe that
area has more texture or detail. On the other hand, if they want an area to be
quiet or to recede into the background, the artists make everything in that
area similar. The range of lights or darks may be very narrow. The colors may
be rather dull. There may be very little detail. The contrast in the artwork
determines where you look as you experience a painting.
Contrast simply means “difference.” Little contrast means that there isn’t
much change between two areas. A lot of contrast means that there’s a big
change.
The role of contrast
After you understand how to use contrast in your painting, you’ll rule the
way others see your work instead of allowing the painting to rule you. You
can use contrast in several ways, and the choice of how you’re going to use it
depends on what you’re painting. In the meantime, we give you some ways to
create contrast.
234
Part IV: Color and Design 

Value
Value is the most important, overriding way that you can create contrast.
Difference between light and dark values catches the eye. On the other hand,
the eye skims over similar values. See Figure 15-18 for an example.
Color
Color is the second-most important way that you can create contrast. In two-
dimensional compositions, bright, intense colors attract attention, while dull,
muted colors tend to recede. Placing bright colors against duller colors cre-
ates contrast (see Figure 15-19). You can also create contrast by playing com-
plementary colors against each other. Using colors that are similar to each
other is less likely to attract attention. (See Chapter 17 for more in-depth
information.)
Shape
Contrasting different sizes of shapes against each other attracts the eye (see
Figure 15-20). In a similar manner, you can use areas that have mass con-
trasted against areas of line, or large unbroken areas against areas of detailed
shape.

Chapter 15: How the Parts of a Composition Work Together

Texture
The obvious idea here is to contrast areas with and without texture (see
Figure 15-21), but you can also contrast bold or rough textures against areas
that have refined textures.
Line
Contrasting different kinds of lines can be effective for both your drawing and
your painting (see Figure 15-22). These contrasts can involve using lines that
have different weights, which is art jargon for lines that can be thick and thin
or sharp and wide. It can also apply to a contrast of a heavy-handed stroke
against a delicate stroke.

Part IV: Color and Design 

Directing the eye around the composition
You can use this information in very practical ways, but first you need to
think about what you want to accomplish. Answer these questions:
 What do you want to emphasize in your painting?
 How much depth do you want to show in your painting?
 How do these choices affect what the viewer may think is happening in
the painting?
If you don’t have some idea of what you want your viewers to experience when
they look at your painting, you may be working without a sense of direction —
which means that you can get lost very easily in the process of painting.
Wandering through making a painting and intuitively coming up with some-
thing very beautiful is possible, and you can even manage to simultaneously
learn some things along the way. If you consider how you can use various
forms of contrast to achieve your goals, however, it frees you to experiment in
a more productive way and you don’t make as many rookie mistakes.
Here are some problems that you can create if you don’t use contrast well:
 Creating a contrast on an insignificant portion of the composition con-
fuses your viewers. They wonder why you emphasized the area and
what its significance is.
 Creating contrast on the outer edges of the composition without signifi-
cant contrast in other areas leads the viewer’s eye outside your painting.
 Too much contrast throughout the painting can be chaotic. If you want a
busy, energetic composition, that may be a good thing. You should still
consider whether you need more emphasis in some areas than others.
Figure 15-22:
Contrasting
lines.
237
Chapter 15: How the Parts of a Composition Work Together

Consider how much contrast you need. We can think of a few Monet paint-
ings that would be ruined if he had added more contrast of value. The con-
trast of cool and warm colors made them sparkle enough. Use the right
amount of contrast for what you’re trying to accomplish. Little contrast is
okay if it serves your purpose.
Here are some specific situations where you can apply contrast to your
compositions:
 To attract attention to specific areas, use a contrast of very light and
very dark areas against each other. Don’t do this in the background of
your paintings if you want the appearance of depth, because it flattens
the painting out. If you want the eye to move to the background, use a
less extreme combination of lights and darks.
 To bring areas forward in the composition, use contrast of value,
brighter colors than the background, and more detail (smaller shapes).
 To make areas seem farther away, make the values and intensities of the
colors similar to each other. The duller the colors are, the farther away
they seem. Be careful not to make the colors too dull for the situation
that you’re painting.
For more information about how you can use color in your composition, see
Chapter 17.
Project: Keeping your viewer’s attention:
Contrast at work
For this project, you create an abstract painting that explores depth. Design a
simple shape, and then repeat it in different sizes and paint it so that some
seem to be closer and others seem to be farther away. See the example in
Figure 15-23.
1. Prepare a 12-x-12-inch square, preferably smooth painting surface as
necessary, and then set it aside.
A prepared board and gesso coated heavy paper both work well.
2. Design a simple shape that you can easily trace and paint, avoiding
detailed shapes and linear shapes.
3. Make rough sketches to explore different shapes.
Make your sketches with a 4B, 6B, or Ebony pencil in your sketchbook.
4. Pick the best shapes and roughly compose them in square picture
frames to see how they look.
Use the three different sizes, three to six times each.
5. Choose a shape and refine the design into a master sketch.
6. Photocopy your master sketch in several different sizes and pick
three sizes to use in your painting.
7. Use scissors to cut out your shapes so that you can use them as
templates.
238
Part IV: Color and Design 

8. Use a sharp charcoal pencil to trace the shapes onto your painting sur-
face, consulting your rough sketch for positions.
9. Check the composition and make adjustments as desired.
10. Use your paints and painting equipment to paint the composition by
using the following guidelines:
• Paint the background a cool, rather dark color. Don’t paint it black.
Choosing colors and painting is easier if you do the background first.
• Paint the largest shapes the lightest, brightest colors that you want
to use.
• Paint the middle size shapes slightly darker, duller colors than the
colors of the large shapes.
• Paint the smallest shapes colors that are slightly lighter and
brighter than the background color.
For further information on how to choose and mix colors, see Chapter 17.
Try to evaluate the colors as you go, but if you want to make any big
changes, allow the paint to dry for a couple of days, and then paint a different
color over the old color.
When you finish, look at the composition and evaluate whether you can see
depth in your composition. If it needs improvement, read over the section on
contrast and see whether you can adjust any areas.

A
s you become more comfortable in the painting process, you naturally
want to look for ways to add more difficulty and to be more creative.
You also start wanting to speak to your viewers with your painting. If you’ve
ever said that you just want to make people happy with your painting, you’ve
expressed a desire to speak to your viewers about beauty. Everyone has
something that he or she wants to say. It may be a personal story, a political
statement, a view of life, or simply a statement about the act of painting, but
when you paint, you’re communicating your ideas.
In this chapter, we talk about developing an awareness of the way your com-
position speaks to your viewers, and we tell you how you can consciously
compose your painting to express your ideas creatively.
The Right Composition for the Job
The way you arrange the parts of a painting communicates ideas. If, for exam-
ple, you line up the objects in your painting like a bunch of little soldiers,
your composition may be seen as rigid or formal. On the other hand, if you
scatter the objects in a random manner, your composition may be seen as
casual or possibly chaotic.
Every society has a certain clothing “language” that its people understand.
You make decisions about what to wear based on that shared language.
Painting also has a certain “language” that people understand, regardless of
how much they know about art. You bring to painting all kinds of things that
you’ve experienced and know about the world. Some of these things include
the way that you respond to color, your physical awareness of gravity and
balance, and what you share with other people within your culture. When
you “read,” or look at, a painting, you respond not only with your senses and
perception, but also with your knowledge and life experiences.
Visual language refers to the common ways that people see and understand
an image. These common ways include what you see and understand in the
world around you, as well as the way you relate to shared experiences.

Because people have this shared visual language, they tend to understand
paintings in relatively similar ways, regardless of what the artist’s intent is.
For example, if you don’t paint a building perfectly vertical and plumb, every-
one will agree that the building looks like it’s falling down. Color is another
part of this language. People associate certain colors with particular moods
or ideas. You may think of yellow as cheery, while blue is calm or melancholy.
All the ways that you perceive what you see become a part of your visual
language. (For further information about visual perception, read Chapter 15.)
Developing Awareness of Your
Composition Decisions
As you arrange your compositions for your paintings, think about your ideas
and what you’re trying to accomplish. Avoid designing your composition
with eyes blind to what each decision is doing to your composition.
Most people tend to be either analytical thinkers or intuitive thinkers, but
everyone has the capacity for both. The way you solve problems influences
the way that you naturally make compositions, so knowing whether you’re
more analytical or more intuitive is helpful. You may think that being intuitive
is necessary for being an artist, but you can be a very fine painter no matter
what. If you understand your natural tendencies and can work objectively,
you can use both to support your efforts.
You probably already have some idea of whether you lean toward being ana-
lytical or intuitive, but here are some characteristics of each:
 Analytical problem-solvers are rules-oriented and like structure. They
like to have everything clearly outlined, and will do research to collect
as much information about what interests them as they can. They like to
have definite, correct answers to questions. Their solutions to problems
converge toward one clear, well-considered solution.
 Intuitive problem-solvers work by trial and error. They like to feel their
way through a problem. They think that rules are more like guidelines,
and will research by following their noses in whatever direction their
interests take them. Their solutions to problems are divergent, having
multiple possible solutions.
Try to find your place on a continuum instead of trying to decide whether you
fit into one style or another. Figure 16-1 shows a simple continuum with analyti-
cal problem-solvers on one end and intuitive problem-solvers on the other end.

Part IV: Color and Design 

Structured compositions
Structured compositions are easy to identify because they have distinct char-
acteristics. They look formal and planned because they were put together
according to a devised set of rules.
If you think of your composition as a grid, everything in your composition is
placed on the grid according to a math-like plan. All linear shapes line up par-
allel to or on a diagonal with the picture frame. Other shapes are organized in
a geometric pattern. In Figure 16-2, you see two structured compositions. The
objects in the composition on the left are plotted on the grid. Notice that 
the objects in the composition on the right relate to a grid but also line up
parallel to the picture frame.
Structured compositions that conform to geometric forms or formulas based
on grids are also called architectonic compositions.
Traditional Christian crucifixion scenes are examples of structured composi-
tions. Jesus becomes the major focal point at the top of a triangle formed
with mourners and Roman soldiers at the base. In another example, Andy
Warhol composed many of his paintings in a structured manner, including the
soup can paintings and many of his portraits of celebrities. Figure 16-3 shows
additional examples of structured compositions.

Chapter 16: Communicating Ideas Visually

Dynamic compositions
As its name implies, dynamic compositions are active compositions that have
a lot of movement. Because no rules are in place to lock the parts into static
relationships, they’re flexible and casual in feeling.
Once again, if you think of your composition as a grid, the rule is that there
are no rules — except that nothing can line up with the grid or picture frame.
You feel your way through a dynamic composition. You start with an object
and, through trial and error, add objects and take objects out, moving things
around until it works. In Figure 16-4, you see the same objects from Figure
16-2 repositioned in a dynamic manner.
Make dynamic compositions by composing objects so that they have no rela-
tionship to a grid. Instead, put objects together and evaluate how they look
with the rest of the composition.
Most traditional still life and landscape paintings are dynamic compositions.
Many of the paintings that you make in the beginning will probably be
dynamic compositions. See Figure 16-5 for examples.

Part IV: Color and Design 

Symmetrical and Asymmetrical
Compositions
You can approach making compositions in a number of ways. Structured and
intuitive compositions are examples based on mental approaches that you
can map on a grid. Other approaches are based on different strategies, but
they all provide a platform for making strong compositions. You use the strat-
egy that works best for the way you’re most comfortable working and for
your idea and composition.
Balance is one of the most common approaches to composing artwork. It’s
based on the idea of gravity. That probably seems completely crazy — after
all, no special gravitational forces apply only to artwork! It does make sense if
you consider the way that people understand what they see, though. You
bring what you know about the world to the way that you understand art-
work, and that includes the idea that something can fall.
Look at Figure 16-6. The object seems completely stable when it sits near the
bottom of the picture frame in the example on the far left. When the object
sits higher in the frame, in the next two frames, it seems heavier, as if it’s in
the act of falling. The higher an object is in the frame, the heavier it seems.
The interesting thing is that if you change the object into something that
you expect to see higher in the frame, the feeling of weight disappears.
Seeing objects that you expect to float or fly up high seems perfectly natural.
Figure 16-7 illustrates this change.

245
Chapter 16: Communicating Ideas Visually

When you use the principle of balance, you take the concept of weight further.
You divide your image area into two side-by-side halves that are “weighed”
against each other as if they’re on a teeter-totter. The parts of your composi-
tion on the left are weighed against the parts of your composition on the right.
Examples appear later in Figures 16-8 and 16-10.
Bilateral symmetry is a term for all the kinds of balance that weigh the parts
of the left half of a composition against the parts of the right half. This is an
umbrella term for both symmetric and asymmetric compositions.
Symmetric compositions
An easy way to describe symmetric compositions is to say that about the
same amount of stuff is on either side of the composition. If you think of it as
a bunch of kids on a teeter-totter, you have different kids on both sides, but
each side weighs about the same. In a composition, the parts of the left side
appear to have a similar weight to the parts on the right side. (See Figure 16-8
for an example of a symmetric composition.)
There are two types of symmetric compositions. Most symmetric composi-
tions fall under the general description we just gave you. The second type is
called mirror image.
In mirror image compositions, the parts on the left side are mirrored on the
right side. That means that the parts on the left are duplicated and flipped
over to complete the whole composition. (Figure 16-9 shows you an exam-
ple.) Think of it as one side of your body being mirrored on the other side. If
someone gives you only one side of a mirrored composition, you know
exactly what the other side looks like. Because mirror image compositions
have one overriding rule — what’s on the left is mirrored on the right — all
mirror image compositions are structured compositions.
Figure 16-8:
Both sides
of the
composition
have about
the same
weight.
246
Part IV: Color and Design 

Asymmetric compositions
In asymmetric compositions, you have one side that’s a lot heavier than the
other side, but the entire composition still needs to be balanced. As you can
see in Figure 16-10, it’s like having a big kid and a little kid on the teeter-totter. If
they both sit on the ends, the big kid can sit all day with his end on the ground
while the little kid is stuck stranded in the air. Of course, you probably learned
on the playground that if you move the kids around, the board evens out. You
can move the big kid in toward the middle and the little kid stays out toward
the end. Everybody’s happy. 
You have one overriding rule in asymmetric compositions. A major focal
point must be located to one side of the composition. It’s never in the middle
of the composition. Beyond that, you have to move things around to get the
composition to balance (just like the big kid and little kid on the teeter-
totter). It’s an intuitive process of starting with your major subject matter
and then composing everything in relationship to each other. Figure 16-11
shows you how to balance an asymmetric composition by positioning a
major focal point on one side of the composition.

Flat and Illusionary Compositions
When you look at paintings from the Renaissance like da Vinci’s The Last
Supper, the space seems so realistic that you could reach right into the com-
position. Other paintings, like Robert Indiana’s Love, are so flat that they
hardly seem to have any depth at all.
Paintings like The Last Supper are illusions of reality. The surface they’re painted
on is flat, yet they appear to have depth. The artist uses special spatial devices
to make the space seem real. Devices such as overlapping and linear perspec-
tive are easy-to-learn tools that create any sort of depth you want.
A spatial device is a specific way of placing or drawing the objects in your
composition to show different kinds of space or depth.
Paintings that appear to have little realistic depth and are relatively flat are
generally abstractions. They tend to hug the picture plane. Some abstract
paintings are about the act of painting, and are made purely of color, line, or
shape. Other types of abstract paintings are about simplifying realistic sub-
ject matter. To abstract something means to simplify it. For example, a car-
toon or manga character is an abstraction of a human form. Even very
realistic portrait drawings are slight abstractions of the actual person.
Think of illusionary and abstract images as being on a continuum, with illu-
sion on one end and abstraction on the other. (Figure 16-12 illustrates this
continuum.) The most “real”-looking work falls on the extreme end. This end
may include trompe l’oeil painting, a term for a super-realistic kind of art that
means “fool the eye,” and Photorealism. At the other end are forms of
abstraction that have no relationship to actual objects. Everything else falls
on the line in between, depending on how simplified the image is compared
to the actual object. Monet’s Waterlilies lies on the abstract half of the line,
while Andy Warhol’s soup cans are probably positioned toward the middle.

Part IV: Color and Design 

You can use several devices besides linear perspective to show space in a
composition. Artists across time have used them in different combinations,
which accounts for differences in the way you see space in them. These vari-
ous combinations of devices cause the different kinds of space that you see
in ancient Egyptian art and Renaissance art, for example, or traditional art
from Asia and the Middle East.
Unlike the past, you live in a time when you have many choices in the way
you can make art. You can make art as flat or as illusionary as you like. The
question is what works best to communicate your message, and then what
devices you should use to make the work.
Working on flat compositions
Ancient Egyptian art and the cover of your favorite magazine have a lot in
common. Both have celebrities, intriguing storylines, and flat design. In flat
design, you treat the picture plane like a table upon which you move the
parts of your composition around as you compose it. You can think of it as
composing a painting the same way you would lay out the front page of a
newspaper. Beyond that, the following sections give you a few devices that
you can use. These devices still give you flat space, but they make it a little
more interesting.
Flat pattern
Flat pattern is fairly self-explanatory, but you can think of it as decorative
parts of the composition that really do lie flat to the picture plane — like
words to a page. In ancient Egyptian art, that’s exactly what the hieroglyphics
are, but the lotus flowers, reeds, and other repeated elements you often find
in the art are flat pattern as well.
You can find many examples of flat pattern in print design. The text and head-
lines form blocks that act as flat pattern. The front cover of this book and
most of the interior is flat pattern.
Transparency
Transparency is an interesting device that allows you to show more than the
viewer would normally be able to see. It has a shallowness to it, but you can
build up layers of imagery and make it very interesting. Picasso used this
device extensively. A still life on a table with transparent areas may expose the
grain of the wood in the tabletop and even the pattern of the wallpaper behind
it. (Check out Figure 16-13 to see an example of transparency in a composition.)

Chapter 16: Communicating Ideas Visually

Ambiguity
Ambiguity is a device that’s often associated with transparency, but you can
attain it by using other strategies. The basic idea is that you execute the area
in such a way that you can’t tell what’s in front and what’s in back. That’s
easy to do with transparency, but you can also achieve it by balancing light
and dark areas so evenly that the positive and negative spaces switch domi-
nance depending on how you look at them. In Figure 16-14, the subject and its
background are interchangeable, creating ambiguous space.

Part IV: Color and Design 

Creating depth in your composition
Throughout time, artists have used combinations of devices to show depth.
They commonly combined overlapping, diminishing size, and vertical location
to create depth. Linear perspective has been used in art only since the begin-
ning of the Renaissance, less than 600 years ago. Even so, it was primarily used
in Western cultures until relatively recent times. Today, artists everywhere use
the spatial devices in various combinations according to their needs.
The following sections outline the devices that you can use to help show
depth in your artwork.
Overlapping
Overlapping is the simplest device that you can use to show depth. If you
want one object to appear to be behind another, overlap them. Draw the
object in front so that it covers up part of the object in back. Figure 16-15
shows you an example of overlapping in the drawing on the left.
If you want one object to look like it’s behind another, make sure that you
paint its edges right up to the edges of the object in front. If you don’t, the
front object looks like it has a halo around it and the space looks flat, as you
can see in the drawing of the objects on the right in Figure 16-15.
Diminishing size
Diminishing size is a device in which you make the objects in your composi-
tion larger if they’re close to you and smaller if they’re farther away. (See
Figure 16-16 for an example.)
Figure 16-15:
Overlapping

object in
front of
another.
251
Chapter 16: Communicating Ideas Visually

Vertical location
In vertical location, you show objects that are closer to you toward the bottom
of the composition, and you place objects that are farther away higher in the
composition. (Figure 16-17 shows the vertical location device in action.)
Linear perspective
Linear perspective is a structural method of drawing that gives you the most
lifelike sense of space. It assumes that you’re viewing your subject from a
single point of view, standing in one spot with one eye shut.
When you use this method, you establish a line on your paper that represents
the level of your eyes if you look straight ahead. Everything else you draw has
a relationship to that line. For example, boxes are made of sets of flat planes. If
you extend the lines of the sides of a box indefinitely, the lines eventually con-
verge at points on the eye level line. These are called vanishing points.

Part IV: Color and Design 

Atmospheric perspective
Have you ever noticed how a hazy summer day, city smog, or even fog affects
what you can see in the distance? Water and dust in the atmosphere cloud
how clearly you can see distant objects. Even on a clear day, you can see
everything near you much more clearly than anything farther away.
You can use atmospheric perspective to create depth in your composition in
the following ways (see Figure 16-18 for an example):
 For objects close to you, use brighter colors with a full range of value,
from very dark to very light. Give these objects more detail than objects
that are farther away.
 For objects farther away from you, use duller colors. Limit the use of
darks and lights so that you use only the middle range of values.
See Chapter 17 for more information about how you can choose colors for
atmospheric perspective.
Isometric projection
Isometric projection can seem to be similar to linear perspective, but they’re
very different. In isometric projection, the lines you’d use to draw the sides
of your boxes remain parallel to each other. They never converge at a point
on an eye level line — there is no eye level line. You also draw the lines on
the same degree angle throughout the drawing. The box in Figure 16-19 is
drawn using isometric projection.

Chapter 16: Communicating Ideas Visually

This type of drawing is used for industrial design and has a long history of
use in traditional Asian art. It can be useful to you in drawing close-up still
life objects. They’re so close that you don’t see as much of the effect of linear
perspective. If you’re having trouble making lines that diverge rather than
converge, this device can help you solve it.
Multiple perspective
While linear perspective assumes that you’re looking at a scene from one
position with one eye shut, multiple perspective allows you to combine more
than one point of view into one painting.
A simple example of multiple perspective is the ancient Egyptian figure whose
face and lower half of the body turn to the side, while the eye and shoulders
face the viewer. The Cubists — Picasso and Braque, for example — took this
device to another level. They rejected the stationary view of reality that came
out of the Renaissance with linear perspective. They said that it was more real
to show what you see when you look at an object from different sides or even
through it. So, they worked out a way to combine different points of view in
one painting. (Try the upcoming project on multiple perspective painting.)
You can use multiple perspective in your painting in other ways. Here are
some possibilities:
 If you want to do a panoramic landscape, use different points of view
that have a common horizon. Take photographs each time you turn a
little until you make a full circle. Your eye level stays the same, but each
view is different. Then patch all the photographs together, matching the
horizon lines.
 Make a painting that repeats the same subject from different points of
view in one composition.
 Photograph a subject in fragments, collage the photographs together,
and then paint the resulting image.

Part IV: Color and Design 

Project: A multiple perspective painting
A simple way to do this version of multiple perspective is to create a different
layer of drawing for each point of view, combine the layers, and then choose
to paint parts to emphasize different layers and create focal points. It’s
always a good idea to look at the work of other artists before you begin a
painting. It can help you focus on your goals for your painting. For this paint-
ing, take a look at Picasso’s or Braque’s still life paintings from the early 20th
century. When you’re ready to tackle this project, check out Figure 16-20 for
an example and then follow these steps:
1. Prepare to paint by setting up your work area, paints, and palette; you
need a painting surface that’s about 16 x 20 inches.
2. Set up your still life, and be sure to consider your lighting.
3. Choose two analogous colors to use for the preliminary drawing for
this painting.
Examples of analogous colors are blue and violet, or blue and green. One
should be noticeably lighter than the other.
4. Make a wash of the lighter analogous color and draw the entire still
life on your canvas with that color.
Be sure to use your viewfinder to help you see the composition.
5. Move a few steps to the side so that you have a different point of view
of the still life, and use the darker color to draw the new view of the
still life on top of the first drawing.
Figure 16-20:
An example
of a multiple
perspective
painting.
255
Chapter 16: Communicating Ideas Visually

Note that when you move a few steps to the side, you may want to move
the table with the still life to make painting easier. Ignore the former
drawing as you work. Allow the forms to fully overlap each other.
6. Look at your drawing and decide what you want to emphasize in the
painting, and consider where your patterns of dark and light might be.
Maybe you want to emphasize an interesting overlap of two cups, or a
pattern overlapping a shape.
7. Begin your underpainting by painting every shape made by the over-
lapping drawings a different color.
Don’t do this arbitrarily. Look at your still life as you work. If the shape
of a cup is divided in two by the drawing from the other point of view,
try painting it two similar values or hues. If you want to paint it two very
different values, but you want to keep the shape of the cup, paint the
lines of the drawing of the cup a light or dark color. (See Figure 16-21 for
two ways to treat a multiple perspective cup.) This painting process is
intuitive; paint an area and constantly assess how it works with the rest
of the composition.
8. After you cover your surface with paint, continue to develop the
painting in layers.
Feel free to try adding texture to your work by using your painting knife
or different kinds of brushstrokes. Experiment!
9. As you paint, step back every now and then and ask yourself these
questions:
• Where are my focal points? Do they direct the eye to appropriate
parts of the composition, or do they direct the eye to the outer
edge or off the canvas?
• What does my overall value pattern look like? Is the total value pat-
tern interesting?
• Where are my areas of contrast? Does the composition look spotty
or well designed?
• Is the color vibrant or dead? Are all the colors dull, bright, or a
nice mix of both?
• Does the total composition look well resolved or does your eye go
to parts that that seem off?

Working in your sketchbook
Working in your sketchbook is an essential part of learning to paint. Your
sketchbook is a place to try out new ideas, experiment, and study. In these
exercises, you put what you read in this chapter to work. You may not be
interested in making a painting about every spatial device we discuss — nei-
ther are we — but these exercises help you recognize the devices and dissect
how an artist has put together his composition.
Did you ever collect leaf specimens for science class when you were a child?
It was a good project. It helped you learn to identify various kinds of trees.
You can do a little of that for this sketchbook work so that you can learn to
recognize different kinds of compositions. Start by going through some art
books and photocopying “specimens” of paintings that represent various
types of compositions. Glue them into your sketchbook and label them. 
Thinking about point of view
Every time you paint from life or make other realistic images, you make a
choice about the point of view. Ideally, you’re always looking for something
interesting, but if you really want to give your work impact, unusual points of
view can deliver it. You do want to consider what angle is best for getting
your point across, however. Impact for the sake of impact may not be appro-
priate. For example, if you’re making a movie and you use the points of view
in a romantic comedy that you typically find in a horror movie, you may have
some very confused viewers!
Mouse eye views are a lot of fun and make very dramatic compositions. The
idea is merely that you capture a point of view that’s as low to the floor as
possible. If you have a tabletop setup, you may capture your point of view as
low to the top of the table as possible. The objects in these compositions
often seem larger than life, or at least life as you normally experience it. This
point of view is common for young children and babies, but it’s outside most
people’s day-to-day way of looking at things.
Bird’s eye views, as the name implies, are aerial views. The viewer hovers
over the scene at a height you determine. The point of view can be as low as
if the viewer is standing over a setup or any reasonable height above.
You can easily stand over a setup that you place on the floor and then draw
it. If you want it to appear that you’re working from a greater height, think
about how much you need to reduce the size of the drawn setup to get the
desired appearance of height that you want. The smaller the setup is, the far-
ther away it appears to be. (Figure 16-22 shows an example of each view.)

H
ave you ever been disappointed with the color you painted a room?
Most people have at one time or another. Maybe you did all the right
things: You picked up a set of paint chips from the hardware store. You held
them up to the wall and chose the one that you liked the best. You bought the
paint that matched the chip. It wasn’t like you picked up the first gallon of
paint you could put our hands on. What went wrong?
Well, the truth is that color is very tricky and deceitful, more so even than that
old boyfriend or girlfriend you had in high school. Color is strongly affected
by the colors around it. You think you have the right color, and, whoops! It
slips right by you. If you want to get a handle on color while you learn to
paint, the best thing you can do is commit to understanding it really well.
In this chapter we tell you all the secrets of color and how to apply them to
your own painting.
Describing Color Clearly: 
Hue, Value, Intensity
What color is “peach?” Well, if you look at a real peach, its color is a range of
hues like red, orange, and yellow-orange, and some of the colors are dark while
others are very light. So, what do people mean when they call a color “peach?”
Most color names like “peach,” “cornflower,” or “forest green” are subjective
names that tell you very little about what a color really looks like. What if you
had never seen a peach, a cornflower, or a forest? These names tell you more
about an experience than what a color looks like.
Being able to see and describe color accurately is important. If you can
describe a color, you can mix it.

Every color has three characteristics that can help you describe it. The word
color actually means more than whether a color is red or blue. It also includes
how light or dark a color is, as well as how bright or dull a color is. Read on
for more on these three characteristics:
 Hue: You can begin describing a color by looking at its hue, which
merely refers to its position on the color wheel. Hue names are simple:
red, blue, green, red-orange, and so forth. Look closely, though. A red
may be a warm red that looks a little red-orange, or it may be a cool red
that looks a little red-violet. Look at the color wheel on the Cheat Sheet
in the front of this book. You see many possible hues that could lie
between the hues we provided.
 Value: The second characteristic of a color is value, which refers to how
light or dark a color is. Light colors are closer to white in value, while
dark colors are closer to black. A pure red or green is similar in value to
middle gray. Look at Figure 17-1 to see where some colors on the color
wheel lie on a grayscale.
To see the value pattern of the objects that you’re painting, squint while
you look at them. Squinting allows you to see their values but not their
intensities. If you’re worried that squinting will land you in the plastic
surgeon’s office sooner than you want to be there, just drop your eyelids
and look through your eyelashes.
 Intensity: The third characteristic of a color is intensity. This refers to
how vibrant or bright a color is on the high end, or how dull or gray or
neutral a color is on the low end. Some colors are naturally more intense
than others. This is their temperature. For example, warm colors like reds
and oranges — the colors you associate with fire — are naturally more
intense than cool colors like blues and violets — the colors you associate
with ice.
Another factor that affects intensity is how saturated, or pure, a color is,
which means how free the color is of white, black, or other hues. A pure
orange has no white, black, or blue in it. On the other hand, the color of
an oak floor is a less-saturated, less-intense version of orange and would
be mixed by adding white and other hues or black to an orange pure
hue. See Figure 17-2 for two colors that have the same value of orange
despite one being much duller than the other.
Beginners often confuse brightness with lightness. Use this simple activity to
help you develop your ability to detect intensity.

that falls

Collect a stack of magazines or advertising supplements from your Sunday
paper and then follow these steps:
1. With a utility knife, cut out swatches of as many variations of yellow
as you can find and spread them out on white paper.
Collect swatches that are at least 1⁄4 inch wide.
2. Sort the swatches that seem to “glow” into a group on a separate sheet
of paper.
Look at your pool of yellow swatches. Which yellows seem to “glow”
more than the others? These swatches appear to be more vibrant and
clear; they’re free of white, black, or other hues.
3. Sort the swatches that seem hazy or dull onto another sheet of paper.
4. Study the remaining swatches; if any seem to belong in the other two
groups, place them in those groups; the remaining swatches make up
their own group.
5. Study each of the three groups, sorting each group into pools of
brighter and duller swatches.
6. In your sketchbook or on a piece of white bond paper, glue each
group of swatches down as a long, rectangular strip making a scale or
transition from bright to dull.
Use rubber cement because it doesn’t warp the paper like white glue
does.
7. Slice off the sides and ends of your scale using a ruler and the utility
knife to make it look neat.
8. Glue the strip down to another sheet of paper.
9. Compare your strip to the example in Figure 17-3.
How did you do? A good exercise will remind you of a ray of light from a
flashlight, bright on one end and defused at the other.

Chapter 17: Using Color with Confidence

The Four Basic Kinds of Colors: Pure
Hues, Shades, Tones, and Tints
As discussed in Chapter 7, you learn to mix paints by making a chart of
colors. You make pure versions of basic hues and then add white to them to
make tints. You make shades by adding black or complementary hues to the
pure hues. To those shade mixtures, you add white to make tones. As you add
white, black, and complementary colors to your pure hues, you change their
values and their intensities in very specific ways.
Complementary hues are the hues directly across from each other on the
color wheel. For example, the complement of blue is orange.
The color wheel in Figure 17-4 includes pure hues, shades, tones, and tints.
Notice how the values and intensities change from one ring to another.
 The pure hues, the outer ring on this wheel, are the brightest, most
intense forms of a hue. The brightest warm hues, like yellow, yellow-
green, and yellow-orange actually seem to vibrate. The cool colors, like
blue and blue-violet, have a quiet glow about them. Their values can run
from very light, like the yellow, to very dark, like the blue and blue-violet.
 The shades, the second ring, are always darker and duller than the pure
hues, but they often seem bright compared to other colors. Shades are
very much like the colors of fall leaves.
 Tones, the third ring, are the most versatile of colors, with a wide range
of values and intensities. Their values can range from dark to light, and
their intensities can range from bright to dull. Nearly all the colors that
you use in your palette are likely to be tones.
 Tints, the inner ring, are always lighter in value than pure hues. The
recipe for them is pure hue plus white. They look like spring colors and
tend to be a little bright. If you compare a tint and a tone of the same
hue and value, you notice that the tint is brighter than the tone.

Part IV: Color and Design 

Paint store samples can help you learn to see color. Ask the employees at
your local paint or hardware store for old or discontinued sample books that
they’re planning to throw away.
One way you can use samples is to simply place them on the objects that
you’re planning to paint to help you identify the local color. Sometimes, how-
ever, the local color is so strongly affected by the colors surrounding it that it
can fool you into thinking that it’s a totally different color than it really is. Use
a white index card with a hole punched in it to isolate the local color so that
you can compare it to your color samples.
Of course, none of this makes any difference if you can’t mix a color similar to
the color sample that you matched the local color to. Choose a color sample
from a book or collection of color samples, and try to match your paint to it.
Here’s how to approach it:
1. Hold a color sample against the color wheel in Figure 17-4 and find
the closest hue to your sample.
If your target hue is between two hues on the wheel, decide whether
your hue lies exactly halfway between the two or leans toward one hue
or the other. If you aren’t sure, view your color through a white index
card with a hole punched in it.
2. Make a pool of paint as close to your hue as you can.
If you’re mixing one of the oranges, ask yourself if it needs to be more
red or more yellow. If you’re mixing a green, ask if it should be more blue
or more yellow. And if you’re working with violet, ask if it needs to go
more red or more blue.
Theoretically, every color on the color wheel is made of only one or two
primary hues: red, blue, or yellow. You learn in grade school that you
can mix the primary colors to get the secondary colors — orange, green,
and violet. It worked pretty well as long as you were mixing to get
orange and green, but it fell apart when you mixed red and blue and got
a dull, grayed-down violet. The theory didn’t fail you; your pigments did.
You did mix violet; it just wasn’t a pure hue of violet. Pigments have limi-
tations and sometimes you need to buy a pigment similar to the hue you
need in order to get the brightest version of a hue.
3. Determine the value of your target color and use your complemen-
tary mixture, black, or white to darken or lighten it.
Decide whether your target color is lighter or darker than the pure hue
you have. Use the complementary mixture or black to darken it; add
white to lighten it. When the hue and value are similar to your target
color, move on to the next step.
4. Check the intensity of the color and make it duller or brighter to
match the target.
Is your color brighter or duller than your target color? If your color is
brighter than your sample, you need to add the complement or black to
dull it. That will probably make it too dark for the value you want, so
you’ll also need to lighten it back to the earlier value by adding white.
If your color is too dull or appears washed out, add some of your pure
hue back into it to brighten it up.
263
Chapter 17: Using Color with Confidence

All this color creation can make you a little crazy, but just remember that get-
ting the right color is merely a balance of three things: the pure hue, white,
and the complement or black.
Cutting the Light: How Complementary
Colors Work
So why bother talking about complementary colors when grabbing that tube
of black paint is so easy when you want to darken or gray-down a color? Black
is fast and it does the job, but if you really want to improve your use of color,
you need to get to know your complementary colors and how they work.
First, take a quick trip back in time to your fifth-grade science class. The
color you see around you is subtractive color. White light from the sun strikes
an object that you’re looking at, and all the colors of the spectrum — that
rainbow that shows up after an afternoon thunderstorm — are absorbed by
the object except the color we see, which is the local color. So, if you’re 
looking at a blue bowl, all the colors in a ray of light are being absorbed
except blue, which is reflected to your eyes. That’s why wearing a black 
t-shirt on a summer day is so much hotter than wearing a white t-shirt. Black
absorbs all the light, and thus much of the energy, while white reflects all the
light and absorbs less of the energy.
So black pigment particles absorb light, and when you mix black into a pool
of pure hue, you dilute the amount of the hue’s light that can be reflected for
you to see. It’s like pulling a window shade partially down.
You can mix a very nice black by mixing the primary colors together in the
right proportions. The three primaries cancel each other out by absorbing
the light rays of the others, so very little light is reflected. These proportions
aren’t equal; they’re approximately two parts blue, one part red, and one part
yellow, depending on the pigments you use. (You wouldn’t want to use one of
the lighter blue pigments like cerulean blue, for example. A dark blue like
phthalocyanine blue works better.) So, try mixing a black as an interesting
alternative to tube black. Rather than the dull, dead black that comes out of a
tube, you’ll have a black that shimmers with the colors you mixed to make it.
Using black is an effective way to adjust colors for value and intensity, but
beware of these two problems with it:
 If you use black too much, your paintings have an all-over grayness about
them that makes them seem dull and lifeless.
 There is no perfect black, so when it’s added to many colors, it changes
their basic hue. For example, orange is notorious for turning greenish
when you add black to it.
Look at the examples in Figure 17-5. On the left, you see a pure orange hue
and its shade, which we made by adding black to it. Compare that set with
the set on the right — a pure orange hue and its shade, which we made by
264
Part IV: Color and Design 

adding the true complement of orange. The orange shade on the left looks a
little greenish, while the orange shade on the right looks more reddish in
comparison. How do you know which is correct?
An easy technique for checking to see whether you maintained the hue of the
original color is to cast a shadow across the original hue and compare it to
the new mixture. It doesn’t matter how light or dark your shadow appears;
you’re checking to see whether the hues appear to be the same.
So, hold your finger over each pure hue in the example and compare the
shadows you’re casting over them with each of their shades. The shade made
with the complement is much more like the shadow than the shade made
with black.
Complements work by completing the set of three primaries you need to
make black: red, blue, and yellow. For example, if you’re working with green
and you want to make a green shade, here’s what you do:
1. Think of the primaries that you use to make green — yellow and blue.
2. Ask yourself what the missing primary hue is — red.
3. Red is the complement of green.
4. Mix red into the green mixture.
5. The red combines with some of the yellow and blue in the green mix-
ture, in effect making black, and resulting in a darker green shade.
Here’s an interesting combination: Suppose you want to make a violet shade.
Violet is made of red and blue primaries; therefore, its complement is yellow.
Yellow is a very light color, but if you add a small amount of yellow to violet,
the resulting violet shade is darker than the original violet, despite the addi-
tion of the lighter color. Cool, huh?

Chapter 17: Using Color with Confidence

This is a fun project that plays with the idea of using shades:
1. Hang a 12-x-16-inch (or similar) prepared painting surface on the wall
and shine a strong light on it.
2. Ask someone to form a shadow puppet with his or her hands in the
light, casting the shadow onto your painting surface.
You may have to experiment with the position of the lights and your
model to make the shadow the right size and sharpness on your surface.
3. Trace the shape of the shadow with a charcoal pencil.
4. Mix a bright pure hue for the background color and paint it in the
background areas.
The example in Figure 17-6 is yellow-green. (Use the recipes for colors in
Chapter 7 if you need help with the pure hue and shade.)
5. Find the complement of your pure hue and mix its shade.
The complement of yellow-green is red-violet, making a yellow-green
shade.
6. Paint the shade flatly into the outline of the puppet shadow.
7. Use a brush to blur the edges of the shadow and background.

How Color Interactions Can Mess
with Your Mind
We talk a lot about how colors change when you mix them together, but the
appearance of a color is in constant change because colors strongly influence
each other. We discuss five rules in this section that describe how colors
influence each other’s value, hue, and intensity.
Look at the color squares in Figure 17-7. They appear to be very different
colors, but they’re actually the color you see to the far right. Check it by iso-
lating the colors with a punched index card.
Rule 1: Value and size
The smaller an area of color is, the darker and brighter it appears to be.
This color rule helps you to predict how colors can change. For example,
remember the example of the paint chip you brought home from the store
and how disappointed you were in the color of the room after you painted it?
It’s because the color you painted your room appears to be significantly
lighter and duller than the color chip you used to pick your paint. That’s the
effect of this color rule.
Rule 2: Value
A color surrounded by a lighter color appears to be darker, but if it’s sur-
rounded by a darker color, it appears to be lighter.
Look at Figure 17-8. Both small squares are the same color, but the square on
the dark background on the left appears to be lighter, and the square on the
light background on the right appears to be darker.
Figure 17-7:
The three
small
squares
appear to be
different,
but they’re
all the same
color.
267
Chapter 17: Using Color with Confidence

Rule 3: Hue
If a color is surrounded by one of its primary hues, it appears to be more
like its other primary pure hue.
This concept is a lot like a subtraction problem. Violet is made of the pri-
maries red and blue, so violet “take away” (or surrounded by) red equals
blue, and violet “take away” (or surrounded by) blue equals red.
Look at Figure 17-9. On the left, you can see a square of the original hue of
violet. Compare it to the small squares in the figure. In the left large square,
the small violet square is surrounded by a blue tone, but the surrounded
violet appears more red than the original violet. In the right large square, the
violet square is surrounded by a red tone, but the violet appears to be more
blue than the original violet.
Rule 4: Intensity — Complement Sets
Complementary colors placed next to each other make each other look
brighter, but similar hues make each other look duller.
Look at Figure 17-10. On the left, you can see a small orange square sur-
rounded by its complement, blue, and on the right, you see the same orange
square surrounded by an orange tone. The orange surrounded by blue is sig-
nificantly brighter than the orange surrounded by orange.

268
Part IV: Color and Design 

Rule 5: Intensity — Relative 
Intensity Sets
Any brighter color makes another color look duller, and any duller color
makes another color look brighter.
This rule is important to consider as you choose colors for your subjects and
backgrounds. A bright background can kill the color in your subject and
make the depth in the painting look flat. On the other hand, a duller back-
ground can add to the depth in your painting, making the space seem very
real. It can also make the colors in your subject appear much more vibrant.
Color and Focal Points: Using Contrast
for Emphasis
Color can help you emphasize the areas of your paintings that you want your
audience to see first. Most of the time, these areas are the main subject
matter in your painting, but sometimes you may want to emphasize other
areas as well. Treating all the areas of your painting the same isn’t a good
idea because it can confuse your viewers.
Contrast is one of the most important tools you can add to your toolbox.
Contrast merely means difference. People tend to notice things that are differ-
ent. If you walk into a room and the décor is blue, you’re likely to notice a
couple of big, red pillows. If you’re wearing a light t-shirt, you’re likely to
notice the black paint smeared across the front.
Contrast of value
You can use different kinds of color contrasts, or differences, to draw atten-
tion to important parts of your painting. The strongest contrast you can use
is contrast of value. A light subject on a dark background can be striking, but
if the values of the subject and background are similar, the subject blends
into the background. Think about the way animals are protected by camou-
flage. Their hides and furs are so similar to their environment that you could
look right at them and never see them. So, if you want your subject to stand
out from the rest of your painting, make it a different value.
Figure 17-10:
Colors

by their
complement
appear to be
brighter.
269
Chapter 17: Using Color with Confidence

Contrast of hue
Another kind of contrast that you can use is contrast of hue. Complementary
colors are contrasting hues that make each other brighter, and they’re nat-
ural choices for creating emphasis. Near complements are good choices as
well. As a matter of fact, many artists use warm and cool hues, a variation of
a complementary palette, in their paintings. Warm colors naturally dominate
cool colors. If you paint your subjects in warm colors, people will notice
them before they see their cool colored counterparts.
Who wants to paint all their subjects in reds, oranges, and yellows, though?
That could get old really fast! Here’s a guideline that allows you to take
advantage of changes in intensities while using any hues you like: Bright
colors are always noticed before dull colors, no matter what their hues are.
Therefore, a bright blue can make a great color choice for a subject if the
background is a duller, warm color.
Are you noticing a theme here? Once again, the three characteristics of color —
hue, value, and intensity — are your guiding concepts, this time in creating
emphasis in your paintings.
Choosing the Right Colors 
for Your Painting
You can play with colors to give your paintings depth and drama, and that’s
what the next two sections cover. But you don’t want to go overboard, so we
conclude this section with a discussion of how to provide some order to your
color choices with the use of chords.
We talk a lot about how contrast, or difference, makes your painting more
interesting, but using color is like making music. Too much difference is like
banging on a piano. You end up with no organization, no musicality.
Color chords are like playing chords on a piano or a guitar. They’re system-
atic organizations of hues, creating harmonies that add beauty to a work. You
choose these hues because they have a particular relationship to each other
on the color wheel. After you choose these hues, mix various values and
intensities of those hues to make the painting. Often these color chords are
merely a starting point for making a painting, and most artists feel free to
deviate from their choices according to the needs of their painting.
We mention a few color chords in this and other chapters of the book: com-
plementary colors, warm and cool colors, and analogous colors. Here are
some other color chords.
Triadic chord
Choose three colors by placing an equilateral triangle on the color wheel as
seen in Figure 17-11. Use the colors located at the three points of the triangle.
The primary colors — red, blue, and yellow — are a triadic chord. So are the
270
Part IV: Color and Design 

secondary colors — green, orange, and violet. The other two possible sets
are red-orange, yellow-green, and blue-violet and red-violet, yellow-orange,
and blue-green.
Split complement
In this chord, you choose a set of complementary hues. You use one comple-
ment, but instead of using the other complement, you choose the two hues
next to it. See Figure 17-12.
Double split complement
This one is fun! In this chord, you choose a set of complements, but you don’t
use either one. You use the colors next to each of the complements. See
Figure 17-13.

Chapter 17: Using Color with Confidence

Project: Pulling It Together in a Dramatic
Still Life Painting
For this project, you set up a simple still life and apply some of the ideas about
color that we talk about earlier in this chapter. The goals for the project are to
use color to create strong focal points and a feeling of depth in the painting.
Choose three or four objects for your still life. Look for objects whose basic
geometric shapes are different from each other and can make interesting
shapes in your background. Try to find objects that have analogous or com-
plementary color relationships. For example, maybe your objects are red and
green complementary colors.
Set your still life up on colored fabric or paper and put a strong light on it.
Pay particular attention to the direction and shape of the shadows. Look for
shadows with distinct shapes rather than fuzzy shapes for this project.
Before you start, look at the example we provide in Figure 17-14. The objects
in the still life are a small rubber plant in a clay pot, an umbrella, and an
apple. If you analyze the colors of the objects and map their relationships on
the color wheel, you see that the painting has a double split-complementary
palette. The umbrella is red-violet and the apple is yellow-green; the two
colors are complements. The red-orange clay pot is a complement to the
blue-green fabric. The colors are neighbors to the complementary colors red
and green, making a double split.
You’ll notice that the composition includes other hues as well, and that’s fine.
Color chords are just starting points for a painting. The handle of the
umbrella is wood, which is mixed from yellow-orange. The rubber plant is a
mix of greens and yellow-greens. A lot of blue-violet is in the shadows cast on
the fabric. If you look closely, you see that each of the objects has a major
local color, but we painted them all with colors analogous to the main color
as well.
Now, look at the value pattern in the painting. Squint at it so that you can see
the values better. Notice the strong difference between the values of the
apple and its background. You can also see strong value differences in the
center area of the painting, although not as strong as that around the apple.
Toward the top of the painting, the umbrella and the fabric have very little
value difference.
When you use value to show depth, you create more contrast in areas closest
to the viewer and less contrast in areas meant to be farther away.
Finally, look at where the brightest colors are. The yellow-green apple is quite
bright in the foreground and the next brightest colors lay in the red-orange
pot and the greens of the rubber plant. The dullest colors are located in the
background and far end of the umbrella. In fact, if you look along the
umbrella, you see that it’s brighter and has more detail in the areas closest to
the viewer, while on the opposite end, the shadows aren’t as dark and the
colors are duller.
272
Part IV: Color and Design 

Now you’re ready to paint. Set up your still life and follow these steps:
1. Use your viewfinder to find an image that fills your canvas well.
We recommend a canvas between 14 x 17 inches and 16 x 20 inches.
2. Draw your objects with thinned paint and then draw the shapes of the
shadows that you see.
3. Mix pools of the local colors of each of your objects and the 
background.
These colors are the stock colors for your painting. Make them a little
brighter than you think you need.

273
Chapter 17: Using Color with Confidence

4. Squeeze out some of each of your other tube colors, except black.
For this one, you’re going to mix your dark colors. Consult the recipes
for shades, tones, and tints in Chapter 7 as you work.
5. Begin your underpainting by laying in the local colors in thinned
paint on the lit areas of your objects; in the shadowed areas, paint
darker tones and shades of the local colors.
• As you work, you’re establishing the basic value pattern for the
work, so be aware of the value contrasts in the foreground of the
painting and limit them in the background.
• Don’t worry about painting the perfect value and color at this point.
The variety of colors is going to expand as you develop the painting.
The cast shadows are darker versions of the color the shadow is cast
on. If the shadow crosses two objects that are different colors, the
shadow changes color. It holds together as a single shadow if you make
the values similar. Don’t make all your shadows the same color.
6. After you cover all of your canvas with paint, stop and look at your
setup.
Note that all the shadows have variations of value within them and that
the light areas have variations as well.
7. When you begin to paint again, try to follow these outlines:
• In the light areas, paint lighter, warmer colors that are analogous to
the major color of the body of the object. For example, we painted
the light areas of the pot in our example colors that are more orange
than the red-orange of the pot. Use tints and tones in these areas.
Try not to lighten red objects with white because they turn pink
and dull. Use warmer orange colors and as little white as possible.
• In the shadowed areas, paint darker, cooler colors that are analo-
gous to the major body color of the object. Very dark, deep shad-
ows can go dark blue-violet. You can see it in the dark shadows
cast by the clay pot in our example. The shadows on the fabric are
shades and tones of blue-green and blue-violet. We painted the
shadowed area of the pot in shades and tones of red-orange, red,
red-violet, and a little blue-violet.
8. Continue to develop your painting by observing and refining the
value patterns of the painting.
When the paint starts to get harder to manage, work on another area.
9. As the painting starts to come together, start evaluating and develop-
ing it by asking these questions:
• Does the painting have very light and very dark areas in the near
areas of the scene? Are the areas in the background painted with
middle range values?
• Are the brightest colors in the areas near the foreground of the
painting?
• Is the background noticeably duller than the foreground?
274
Part IV: Color and Design 

• Do the foreground objects have clear edges and the background
objects soft edges?
• Do the background objects have less noticeable details than the
foreground objects?
10. In the final stages of the painting, lay in your brightest colors and
highlights.
Use them only in areas that are meant to draw the eye and to be closer
to the viewer. Make sure that you use them very sparingly so that they
can do the jobs they were meant to do — create strong focal points and
bring objects forward in the composition.

Improve Your Painting

rtists don’t paint in a vacuum. They do a number of things to improve
their painting skills, and many don’t involve brushing paint on a canvas.
They also have strategies for improving, such as making numerous paintings
in a short period, which can show results very quickly. Making quick paint-
ings, looking at both old and new artwork, studying techniques and technical
information, and drawing on a daily basis all become part of an artist’s
lifestyle. Painting is a process of lifelong learning, but utilizing even a few of
the strategies artists use can provide immediate improvement. In this chap-
ter, we talk about how you can employ these strategies yourself.  
Crank Out a Lot of Work
In the beginning, one of the best things you can do to improve your painting is
to crank out a lot of short-duration paintings. By painting often, you give your-
self a wide variety of experiences with handling paint and experimenting with
color and composition.
Cranking out a lot of work can be difficult for some people because beginners
have a tendency to conserve materials — they are expensive! This inclination to
conserve can undermine your progress, though. If your budget for painting is
slim, move to one of the fine student-grade lines available and paint on prepared
paper until you develop some skill.
Working with speed and giving yourself permission to make mistakes helps you
learn to handle a brush efficiently and expressively, and the color in your paint-
ings looks fresher, too. Your painting will look like it has some life to it instead of
looking overworked. Better yet, you start thinking more in terms of what your
total painting is going to look like rather than getting bogged down in details.
Some of your paintings will be very good, while others may be so bad that even
your grandmother wouldn’t like them. The secret is to be objective and look for
each painting’s strengths and weaknesses. The time spent on the weaker work is
worth it if you learn from it.

Take a Drawing or Painting Class
Taking a drawing or painting class offers a lot of advantages. It’s the most effective
action you can take to speed your improvement. A good instructor giving you
feedback can shave years off the time it takes trying to learn to paint by yourself.
Studio classes are like group learning communities where you learn from
the instructors, but you also learn from your fellow students, and they learn
from you.
Taking a class ensures that you paint regularly. Painting is scheduled into your
week, and the discipline to do it is as simple as showing up.
Another advantage to taking a class is the exposure to a variety of techniques and
approaches for painting and drawing. Beware the instructors who teach only their
own specialized painting style. As compelling as they may be, you won’t learn as
much as you would with an instructor who nurtures everyone’s natural ability.
The reasons for taking drawing and painting are fairly similar, but drawing is the
basis for all painting. Learning the basics of drawing makes your painting skills
so much better.
If you take a class and decide that you want to continue, try to take a variety of
classes from a variety of instructors. What you get out of each class is a little bit
like eating at a buffet. You pick up a little bit of this and a little bit of that, and
the flavors blend to make your own distinct style.
Know Your Craft
This idea may seem fairly obvious, but in the rush to paint, it’s probably the
most ignored. Learning the nuts and bolts of art just isn’t as glamorous as
throwing paint at a canvas! Taking time to learn the basics is much more reward-
ing, however. It not only naturally reinforces your own way of working, but also
helps you analyze what other artists are doing much more easily. It makes you a
smarter artist!
Know your materials
Oil painting is based on a chemical process, and if you don’t understand it, your
paintings will break down. For example, if you use oils and solvents that aren’t
made for painting on canvas, your painting won’t dry properly. If you don’t work
“fat over lean,” the surface of your painting will crack. And if you put too much
linseed oil in your paint, it will dry very slowly and interfere with the painting
process. We cover a lot of this information in Chapter 2, but much of what you
learn about oil painting comes from experience.
You also need to learn how your pigments interact with each other and what
their limitations are. Try out different materials and brushes so that you find
what gives you the best results. Knowing your materials enhances your enjoy-
ment of painting and helps you create beautiful, sound paintings that last.
280
Part V: The Part of Tens 

In Chapter 2, you can read more about the technique of working “fat over lean”
and other characteristics of your pigments.
Pay attention to good studio habits
There is no romance in keeping an unkempt studio. Besides being unhealthy
and a fire hazard, all that visual clutter keeps you from seeing what’s really hap-
pening in your painting. A clear area around your painting — free of objects and
anything that competes for your attention — makes it easier to study your
painting and make good decisions.
So clean up as you work, and when you’re finished for the day, put things away
properly, as we discuss in Chapter 5. Try to keep things organized so that you
don’t have to waste time looking for them or buy new supplies because you lost
them.
Take Time to Prepare
Any time you begin any sort of project, you have to prepare, and this rule is true of
painting as well. Even the most intuitive abstract painting takes preparation.
Don’t ignore the surface
The stability of any painting project is dependent on proper preparation — even
if you’re painting your house! Preparation helps the paint adhere to the surface
you want to paint on. It primes a porous surface, sets up a toothy surface for the
paint to stick to, and makes sure that the paint won’t flake off. Preparation also
saves money because you don’t lose paint if it isn’t absorbed into the canvas or
paper that you’re working on. A prepped surface is much more pleasant to paint
on, too. The brush glides across the surface instead of dragging sluggishly
across. You’ll be able to see the difference in your final work.
Another reason for properly preparing the surface is to make sure that your
work lasts over time. You may not like a particular painting, but a loved one or a
collector may value it very much. A properly prepared surface sets up a barrier
between the paint and your canvas or paper that prevents acidic paints from
breaking down the material that you’re painting on.
Get the drawing right
The drawing is the basis for your painting, so you want to try to get it as right as
you can. Standing back from your painting and checking it for problems is criti-
cal. Imagine putting a lot of work into a painting, standing back to admire it, and
finding that you put two left feet on your model. So discouraging!
Because most drawing problems in a painting start with the first marks you
place on the canvas, stand back from the canvas early in the process and often
thereafter to check your work. It also helps to enlist a trusted friend or a
281
Chapter 18: Ten Strategies to Immediately Improve Your Painting

member of the family to look over your work with a fresh pair of eyes. They may
not be artists, but you’d be surprised at how sharp they can be at pointing out
the solution to a problem you’ve been struggling with.
Drawing is an integral part of painting, so practicing your drawing outside of your
painting activities is one of the best things that you can do to support your paint-
ing progress. Spending as little as 15 to 20 minutes per day with your sketchbook
drawing objects or people from observation will pay off with amazing results.
Take care to design the composition well
It’s so tempting to just start painting in your eagerness to get started, but the
design of your painting can make or break the final work. Take time to do a few
rough sketches before you start. They can help you work out problems before
you get so far into the painting that you’re too invested in it to change anything.
Painting is about much more than painting individual objects and people. It’s
also about the background, how you arrange the parts, your value pattern, and
a multitude of other things. Anyone walking up to your painting is going to see
the effect of the whole piece long before they notice how finely you painted your
mom’s crystal goblet.
Be Willing to Sacrifice Any Part 
for the Good of the Whole
Nothing is precious! This guideline is the hardest of all to follow. You aren’t alone.
Painters everywhere spend way too much time on that one little area of the paint-
ing at the expense of everything else. They love that one little area because it’s
perfect, but it doesn’t go with the rest of the painting at all. What’s a painter to do?
Well, first, chalk it up to a learning experience. Working on the entire composi-
tion at once gives you a more cohesive painting. You want to bring it up in
layers instead of painting in concentrated areas that seem to grow like a fungus
on your canvas.
In the meantime, photograph that one perfect area for posterity and paint over it,
or just crop it down and start another canvas — this time thinking in layers.
Even if you do everything right, you may have to paint over an area you really
like for the sake of the whole. It’s all part of the process, painful though it may
seem at times.
Paint from Real Life: It’s 
the Best Way to Learn
Photographs are great tools for an artist, but they go only so far in providing
useful information for you as you draw or paint. They don’t capture reflected
282
Part V: The Part of Tens 

light or shadows well. Most importantly, they flatten out the depth and the
three-dimensional qualities of your objects. The information they provide is lim-
ited enough that it’s easy to spot work made by an artist who has painted only
from photographs.
If you work from life as much as you can, you learn how to make objects look
more three-dimensional than you do if you work only from photographs. After
you work from life for a while, you’re able to bring your knowledge to the work
you do from photos, and your paintings become much more dimensional.
Look at Art — Real Art
Throughout this book we encourage you to go to museums and galleries to look
at real paintings. Looking at art history texts and magazines is important for you
to do as a painter as well, because you benefit from being exposed to a lot of dif-
ferent kinds of artwork. Nothing compares to looking at the real thing, though.
What you can’t see in reproductions
The first thing you notice when you see a famous work is its size. It’s like run-
ning into celebrities; they’re always taller or shorter than you imagined. In a
book or magazine, all the paintings look like they’re in the same size range, but
they’re often vastly different in scale.
Another characteristic you can’t see in photographic reproductions is the tex-
ture of the surfaces of the paintings. Photographs of art have problems captur-
ing the appearance of the layers of paint and the brushstrokes of the artists.
Some painters use a combination of matte and glossy surfaces, which doesn’t
appear in photos. In addition, photos rarely pick up evidence of drawing in the
painting. Some artwork is difficult to photograph altogether, so you won’t have
an accurate picture of the painting at all.
Finally, capturing the true color of a painting is difficult in photography. Even if
the photographer does capture it well, it’s even more difficult to capture the
color when it’s printed. Because of the cost, few publications are able to go to
the trouble to accurately reproduce the true color of a painting.
Let the masters teach you
What you’re looking at when you stand in front of a painting is the hand of the
artist and what he or she was thinking when making the work. Master artists
weren’t gods; they were human beings just like you. When you look at their
works, look for their hand in it. Look for evidence of drawing and the under
painting. Look at the brushstrokes. What size and shape brush did they use?
How did they use color? If you look at paintings with the eye of a fellow artist,
they’ll give up their secrets.

Join an Art Group or Start
Your Own Group
Artists have a long history of getting together to talk about painting and share
ideas, and it continues today. That’s how art movements get started. A few
artists get together to talk about approaches to working, do some painting, and
critique each other’s work. Making art can be a very lonely endeavor without
objective feedback from a few trusted friends. You don’t have to be a master to
take advantage of this idea. Famous artists were as unknown as anyone else
when they first started working.
Attend Art Events
Earlier in this chapter, we mention going to museums and galleries to look at art,
but the nice thing about getting involved in the art community is the social
aspect. Join a museum or get on the mailing list of a gallery and you’ll be invited
to the openings of new exhibitions, lectures by artists, and all sorts of events
that get you connected to other people with your interests and provide oppor-
tunities to learn about painting.
Subscribe to Art Publications
Many good publications about art are available to help you learn about painting.
On a national scale, you can find magazines that focus on topics of interest to
several different kinds of art audiences. The most helpful for you at this point
are magazines devoted to techniques for artists, but other magazines that focus
on work by contemporary artists, art theory, or specific media are good sources
of information. Some areas of the country have magazines that focus on a partic-
ular kind of art made in that region; those magazines may be of interest to you.
You can also go online to browse Web sites devoted to painting. You can begin
with the Web sites of the major museums and then check out the new online
museums and galleries. While you’re at it, look at the Web sites of major art
schools to view their online student galleries, which can give you insight into
what young painters are doing. The National Portfolio Day Web site, at www.
portfolioday.org, provides links to art schools in any geographic area on the
North American continent. Many major art schools belong to this organization
and meet at school sites around the country to review portfolios of potential 
students.
A number of Web sites provide a wealth of technical information for new
painters and can be very helpful to you. You can find these Web sites by typing
a subject such as Oil Painting Techniques into the search engine. One fine Web
site for beginners is the Art Studio Chalkboard (http://studiochalkboard.
evansville.edu) associated with the University of Evansville. You can 
also find a wealth of technical information at the Web sites of Gamblin Oils,
Winsor & Newton, and other paint manufacturers.

Chapter 19
Ten Artists You Should Know:
The Painter’s Painters
In This Chapter
 Examining influential artists of past generations
 Discovering the works of some contemporary artists
 Studying art with a focus on technical and conceptual approaches
You already know painters such as da Vinci, Georgia O’Keefe, and Monet,
but this chapter presents some well-known artists that you may not be
so familiar with. Each of these painters has something special to contribute
to your learning to paint. Some have ideas about subject matter and painting,
while others have unique approaches to technique. Look them all up and
don’t pass over any just because you don’t like to paint the same subject
matter. Be like a sponge and soak up what they can teach you.
Rene Magritte (1898 – 1967)
Belgian artist Rene Magritte (ma-GREET) was a Surrealist like Salvador Dali,
but we like him better. Both artists were talented realistic painters. Dali
painted eerie landscapes with melting clocks. On the other hand, Magritte
combined unrelated objects and ideas in creative, unusual ways.
Locomotives emerge from living room fireplaces. Cloned men in bowler hats
seem to rain from the sky. He created mysterious paintings that seem like
dream images.
Surrealists loved to shock people with their paintings. Combining unrelated
images and ideas often changed the original meanings in clever ways. More
often, they created the sort of absurd images you might dream up after eating
something that didn’t sit well with you.
We think Magritte’s paintings are imaginative and innovative. He used color
masterfully to make solid, realistic forms and establish moods that range
from fun and lighthearted to dark and sinister. Looking at how he combined
images in creative ways can help you boost your own creative abilities.

Wayne Thiebaud (b. 1920)
We think that you’ll enjoy looking at Wayne Thiebaud’s paintings. They’re full
of cakes, pies, cupcakes, hot dogs, and ice cream cones. He lays the paint on
thick; he paints these images as though they’re on display, ready for you to
buy and eat. He’s also painted landscapes and people.
Wayne Thiebaud (TEE-bo) is a California artist identified with the Bay Area
Figurative painters. Although he’s often associated with Pop artists, his ideas
are more about ways to paint everyday objects than they are about Pop Art.
His work is interesting because he lays down paint very simply, yet he’s able
to make the objects look very realistic. The surface of his paintings has a dif-
ferent texture than you see in paintings by other artists. It may remind you of
the icing on the smooth body of a cake. Unfortunately, you can’t see this tex-
ture unless you see one of his paintings in person.
He can teach you a lot about color as well. When you look at his paintings,
examine the colors he uses, especially the colors he uses in the shadows.
Mary Cassatt (1844 – 1926)
Mary Cassatt (ca-SAHT) was an American painter associated with the French
Impressionists. Although she was a part of the Impressionist group, she was
female and didn’t have the same freedoms to move about as her male col-
leagues did. She painted scenes of home life because she was determined to
paint in spite of the barriers she faced as a woman. Her paintings are peopled
with members of her family going about their daily routines. She’s especially
known for the tender manner in which she painted children.
Cassatt’s work shows how you can bring something of your life to your own
painting. We want you to look at Cassatt’s work for the sheer beauty of her
color and brushwork. She had a sensitive, descriptive stroke that captured a
lot of information about her subject with seemingly little effort.
When you look at her work, pay particular attention to her colors. Look at
the overall color composition. Also look at the colors she used in light and
shadowed areas of flesh tones or in the folds of fabrics. Beautiful!
Jan Vermeer (1632 – 1675)
If you saw the movie Girl with a Pearl Earring, you know Vermeer’s work. The
movie may be a totally fictionalized story about a maid in Vermeer’s house-
hold, but the tone and look of the movie is completely Vermeer.
Jan Vermeer (ver-MEER) lived and worked in the same era as his more-
famous colleague, Rembrandt. Dutch painters of that time specialized in
painting specific kinds of images, called genres. These were landscapes,
domestic scenes, portraits, still lifes, and so forth, which they sold to the
286
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Dutch middle class for their homes. Vermeer specialized in domestic scenes,
but he painted a couple of beautiful landscapes as well. His paintings are
heavily symbolic and often seem to tell a story.
We like Vermeer because of the patterns of light and dark in his paintings and
his use of color to create mood. The patterns in his paintings are so strong
that you could reduce many of his paintings down to just pattern and you
would have beautiful abstract paintings.
It would be a good exercise to look at Vermeer paintings and then see how
the basic look of the paintings — the values, colors, forms, and so forth —
was re-created in the movie to achieve the same look.
David Hockney (b. 1937)
An artist of great versatility, David Hockney is an English artist who has lived
and painted in Southern California for many years. His work is playful, but not
childlike. It reflects his knowledge of art history and his love to experiment.
To say that he’s known for any one attribute would be difficult. Here are some
groups of work that we think would be important for you to look at:
 A master of portraiture, he’s able to capture the nuances of his model’s
personality in his paintings. He also has the unusual ability to show how
the people in his paintings relate to each other. When you look at his
work, you want to look at how he draws and paints people, as well as
how he composes his portrait paintings.
 His somewhat abstracted paintings of landscapes and interiors are inter-
esting experiments in adding time to a painting. The interiors may repre-
sent a walk through a friend’s home. Many landscapes represent a drive
down a road. When you view the paintings, look at how he patches
together the views that you may see on that drive.
Hockney is also generous in sharing how he works. Besides books, a number
of videos are available that you can borrow from a library with a good art
video collection. These aren’t how-to videos; generally, they’re videos about
Hockney as an artist. You’re lucky to be able to see him work and hear him
describe his working process.
Richard Diebenkorn (1922 – 1993)
Like Wayne Thiebaud, Richard Diebenkorn (DEE-ben-korn) was a Bay Area
Figurative Painter. They shared some of the same ideas about making art, but
we want you to look at them for different reasons.
Diebenkorn’s simple still life paintings are perfect examples of how you can
take a simple subject, such as a tomato cut in half, and make a precious gem
out of it. The still life paintings are small, expressive, and elegantly designed.
They show that you don’t need complex subject matter to make a fine painting.
287
Chapter 19: Ten Artists You Should Know: The Painter’s Painters

We have ulterior motives for asking you to look at these still lifes, however.
We’re using them to lure you into looking at his abstract paintings. Many
abstract paintings are derived from sources in the artist’s environment. This
is the case with Diebenkorn’s abstracts. You can see a clear connection
between his abstract paintings and his paintings of interiors and views out-
side his window. These inside-outside scenes from his studio were simplified
and pared down to their basic forms and colors. You can see the lines of his
drawing through the paint. The shapes are so simplified, however, that you
may not get it right away unless you know the connection.
Besides our very logical reasons for wanting you to look at them, we want
you to look at Diebenkorn’s appealing use of color and the painterly manner
in which he applied the paint.
Euan Uglow (1932 – 2000)
Euan Uglow (U-won U-glow) was a British painter who painted still lifes and
nude figures. The still life paintings are very realistic with solid-looking forms
and beautiful color. They’re simple, elegant compositions.
Interestingly, he treated his models as still life subjects as well. He posed
them in simple positions that they wouldn’t necessarily have taken them-
selves. Design is a strong element of this work. You can see that he was think-
ing about all the elements of good design when he posed his models.
You can learn a lot about still life and figure painting when you look at his
paintings. His process was very analytical. He worked from observation and
used a network of measurements to plot out his figures. You can see the
marks of the charcoal on his paintings and how he used them to find the
planes of the body. As you examine them, you’ll also be able to see what
colors he chose to show changes in light and shade.
You may not want to paint exactly as he did or work with nude models, but
his methods will help you paint stronger still life images, portraits, and parts
of the human form, such as hands and feet. You can use his methods as a
jumping-off point for developing your own.
Paul Cezanne (1839 – 1906)
Paul Cezanne (say-ZAHN) is an influential French painter who worked during
the same period as Vincent Van Gogh. At one time, he painted in the
Impressionist manner. He decided, however, that Impressionism was too lim-
iting. He saw that objects had no solid form and that it was difficult to depict
depth. He had studied the paintings in museums and said that he wanted his
paintings to have the same staying power as the works he had seen there.
Cezanne’s landscape paintings are well known, but he also painted many still
life paintings of fruit. The fruit in these paintings are casually arranged and
lush with color.
288
Part V: The Part of Tens 

He continued to paint with a broken stroke, as the Impressionists did. He also
tried to develop more structure in the objects he was painting. His emphasis
on planes in the structure of his subjects influenced many later artists. He also
continued to use the brighter palettes that the Impressionists introduced.
When you study his paintings, look at the attention he paid to the various
planes of the objects he painted. They look structural, but they’re also
expressive. Especially pay attention to how he used color, both in his objects
and in the overall compositions.
Look for his incomplete still life paintings that show the general to specific
painting method. The still life paintings are the best. The colors glow and he
used the method of outlining the forms in the complementary color to make
the colors more intense. Seeing the still life paintings in person will teach you
a lot about how to paint.
Wolf Kahn (b. 1927)
Wolf Kahn is a German-born American who paints landscapes that straddle
the line between realism and abstraction. They look like landscapes, but they
emphasize fields of color rather than details. He makes paintings in oil and
pastel about the same size as the paintings you are probably making.
His colors are rich and saturated. He studied under Hans Hoffman, whose
ideas about color have guided many contemporary artists. The colors in
Kahn’s paintings relate to the natural colors in the environment, but they’re
much stronger than the colors you see when you actually look at the environ-
ment. For example, subtle violet shadows become strikingly electric under
his hand. Patterns of dark and light are more than values. They sizzle with
the interaction of vibrant warm and cool colors.
When you look at Kahn’s work, examine the kinds of shapes and color
choices he made. His shapes are similar to those you might make if you’re
working general to specific, but stopped before you developed the specifics.
He keeps his colors fresh and immediate, without overworking or muting
them too much.
Frida Kahlo (1907 – 1954)
If you’re looking for unusual ways to do portraiture, you’ll like Frida Kahlo. She
was a Mexican Surrealist who painted self-portraits loaded with symbolism.
Her paintings are autobiographical portraits. She used her painting to work
out the frustrations and challenges in her life. Due to a terrible accident when
she was a young woman, she struggled with back problems and other physi-
cal ailments for the rest of her life. She wore an iron back brace and painted
289
Chapter 19: Ten Artists You Should Know: The Painter’s Painters

while she was confined to bed. Most of her paintings refer to the constant
presence of her physical problems. She also had a stormy marriage with
famous muralist Diego Rivera, who was another source of consternation —
and subject matter.
She was a political person as well. To show support for the Mexican working
class, she wore traditional costumes and painted portraits of herself dressed
in them.
Kahlo’s work is good for you to study because you can see how you can
incorporate symbolism and aspects of your own life into your painting. It’s a
good way to learn to develop your subject matter and reflect on your life and
goals as you work.
