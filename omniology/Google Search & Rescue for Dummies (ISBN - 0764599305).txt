Author’s Acknowledgments
Every book is a partnership of author and editor. Susan Pink is the editor of
this book and a collaborator in other projects as well. Her keenness, careful
reading, and incisive comments shine through every paragraph . . . except for
the extra chapter I slipped in at the last second. You’ll know it when you see
it. Besides being an unusually fine editor who makes me look a lot better than
I would without her, Susan has a gift for remaining calm during the most
intense deadline crises. She also laughs at all the right times. 
Colin Banfield had the challenging job of technical editor. His insights were
invaluable.
Many thanks to Tom Stocky at Google for his unflinching willingness to
answer my seemingly endless, detailed questions.
Melody Layne at Wiley Publishing nursed this project from the start, getting
it off the ground quickly and helping shape its focus. I’m very thankful.
Mary Corder pulled me into the For Dummies family several years ago, and is,
by now, sick of seeing her name pop up in my acknowledgments. But I am for-
ever grateful, so she’ll have to deal with it.
Many thanks to all the copy editors and production experts who pored over
every page of the manuscript.
Finally, I’d like to thank the Pulitzer Committee for this fine honor. Oops . . .
that speech is from an alternate reality.

Introduction
F
ew Internet phenomena have rivaled Google. Not even Yahoo! of 1994
and 1995 could claim the importance in so many lives that Google can
claim. Amazon, eBay, Napster — all are milestones, but Google is a uniquely
big wheel. It has been adopted quickly, its user base is of global scope, and it
has influence on society at large. (A marketing survey reported that Google
was a more recognized brand than Coca-Cola and Starbucks.) No online activ-
ity has become as deeply embedded in our culture and language as Googling.
The first wave of euphoria has ended. Google was launched, took over the
world of Internet searching, became a public company, and settled down to
life as an established Internet powerhouse. Google’s millions of users were
ecstatic over the uncannily useful search results and no-fluff interface, and
Googling became part of the language and part of the Internet lifestyle. Google
enlightened the online citizenry, and other Internet companies, by demon-
strating that online searching could be profoundly rewarding and profitable.
Google is now entering a second major phase of its existence.
Now a new stage begins. Users take for granted Googling and its great results.
Competitors have wakened from their slumber and are battling Google fiercely
for mindshare and search traffic. New search-related services are being intro-
duced at a record pace. Innovation is in the air. Standards of search accuracy
and relevance have been raised, and consumers know that the next great
development might not come from Google.
The result of this increased competitiveness has been remarkable at Google.
Always a brainy outfit that values invention for its own sake, regardless of what
the marketplace seems to need, Google has expanded its Ph.D.-encrusted staff
and dramatically increased the pace of its development of new products. Since
the publication of Google For Dummies, Google has launched Google Local,
Google Video, Google Suggest, Google Scholar, Gmail, Google Deskbar, and
Google Desktop Search. The company has made extensive overhauls to Google
Toolbar, Froogle, Google Groups, Blogger.com, and Google Free. Google has
acquired photo-editing company Picasa and satellite-imaging company
Keyhole. Google has been busy.
Google has matured and is driving forward quickly on all cylinders. Nearly
from the start, more power has been under the hood than was generally rec-
ognized. Now, it is downright absurd to be using Google only as a simple Web
search engine, hitting the home page with simple keyword strings, oblivious

to the many features and services beneath the service and around its edges.
It never fails: When somebody asks me how I can stretch Googling into an
entire book, the conversation ends with them saying, “I didn’t know that!”
This book is that conversation.
About This Book
My intent in these pages is to reveal the inner depths and hidden features
of the Googling lifestyle, and to rescue you from the overwhelmed feeling of
information overload. Actually, this book’s title has a double meaning: As
Google rescues its users from a hopeless glut of online content, so does it
save information from being lost in poor, wrongly worded searches. Google
accomplishes that last part by providing many specialized features and tools,
all of which are available to us, but many of which are not publicized much.
Most people are unaware of Google’s most powerful and precise tools. Even
in the core service — the Web search engine — Google silently and without
hype includes features that, when known, make daily Googling faster, more
powerful, and more targeted.
Most people are astonished when they discover these brilliant Google fea-
tures. Getting fast stock quotes or word definitions; finding shops in the local
neighborhood; searching through pages in thousands of mail-order cata-
logues; finding files on government and military sites; locating certain file
types; Googling over the phone; navigating search results without using the
mouse; searching only the titles of Web pages; playing Google games at innu-
merable Google fan sites; plumbing the amazing Google Groups (one of the
most remarkable reference resources in the world); using Google as a phone
book; highlighting a word on any Web page and launching a Google search
from that page; using the Google Toolbar to block pop-up ads . . . I could go
on. And, in fact, I do for the next few hundred pages.
So, what is this book about? Without conceit, I can tell you that these pages
are about your virtual life, your online intelligence, and your informed citizen-
ship in the Internet nation. Whichever translation of this book you are read-
ing, whatever country you live in, the beneficent informational power of
Google belongs as much to you as to anyone.
Conventions Used in This Book
I despise conventions. All that walking; the bad food. Fortunately, that has
nothing to do with the conventions used in this text, which are layout styles
and typefaces designed to identify certain kinds of information. To make fol-
lowing along easier, this book is consistent in how it presents these items:

What You’re Not to Read
This book is not technical, so I don’t need to warn you away from difficult
parts. But don’t feel as if you must read straight through from start to finish.
This isn’t a novel. Google’s many services fall naturally into distinct chapters,
and it’s natural to be interested in some things more than others.
For the Google beginner, Chapters 1 and 2 are probably the most important.
But if you have lots of experience with basic Googling, those two chapters
might be the least important. However, don’t blow off Chapter 2 too quickly.
It contains power-search information that can teach practically anyone some-
thing valuable about making Google’s results more targeted and precise. That
said, experienced users should pick and choose from the Table of Contents.
Many readers are probably interested in Google’s new services, especially
those introduced after the publication of Google For Dummies. They are
Google Local, Google Maps, and Keyhole (all three bundled into Chapter 8,
the local search chapter), Google Video, Google Suggest, and Google Scholar
(packed into Chapter 11, the Google Labs chapter), the Google Deskbar
(Chapter 12), and Gmail (Chapter 14).
Part V is mostly for Web site owners and bloggers, though it might be of inter-
est if you aren’t aware of Google’s business services. The three chapters in
this section contain a great deal of new information about AdWords, AdSense,
and the general business of getting a site into Google, keeping it there, and
pushing it up the results page. These topics are thoroughly summarized; for
in-depth coverage of exhaustive (or is it exhausting?) detail, please look at
Building Your Business with Google For Dummies.
If I were to point regular Google users to two chapters (and it looks as if I’m
going to), I would say that Chapter 8, which covers local searching, and
Chapter 12, which describes Google Toolbar, offer the most essential reading.
But the back cover is also quite rewarding.

Introduction

Foolish Assumptions
Google has so few requirements that, in writing about it, I don’t need to make
many assumptions. Which is a good thing, because I have a long track record
of mistaken assumptions. For example, right now I’m assuming that you’ve
taken this book to the bookstore coffee bar, and are dripping caramel macchi-
ato all over the pages. That’s what I’d be doing if I were you.
More realistically, I do assume that you can get on the Internet and operate a
Web browser. Occasionally it’s helpful to check which browser you’re using,
including the version number of that browser, and I blithely assume you can
do that. Basic Internet navigation skills — such as visiting a Web site, filling
in online forms, and following on-screen download instructions — are useful
when exploring Google’s many services. I’m quick to assume that you know
all that stuff. You also need to know how to install programs if you are to use
Google Toolbar, Google Deskbar, Keyhole, and a few others. Fortunately, most
modern computers make installation quite easy, and Google provides instruc-
tions on its download pages.
So I guess I am assuming a fair amount about your ease of movement online,
but honestly, nothing in this book is difficult. If Google were hard, it wouldn’t
be so popular.
How This Book Is Organized
This book employs a new and startling organizational system by which words
are gathered into sentences, which in turn form paragraphs, and the whole
shebang is printed on pages. Just turn the page, and . . . more words! I’ve col-
lected thousands of the finest words in circulation, and strung them together
in a manner that occasionally approaches coherence.
The book’s chapters are organized into five parts, as follows.
Part I: Jumping Into Google
The two chapters in Part I present a detailed look at Google’s most basic 
services — searching the Web from Google’s home page. Here you get an
overview of the entire Google landscape in Chapter 1, and then delve into
basic and advanced searching in Chapter 2.
4
Google Search & Rescue For Dummies 

Throwing keywords hastily into Google is easy enough and delivers some-
what successful results. Studies have shown, however, that a surprising
number of searchers are unsatisfied with the first page or two of results, and
generally don’t look deeper than that. Indeed, searching page after page of
search results is often a waste of time; it’s better in many cases to start a new
search. That’s where search operators and other tricks come in handy. These
advanced (but easy) features give you better ways to narrow your search,
often making that second attempt unnecessary.
This part is not merely a summary. To the contrary, I get very detailed about
search operators (they can improve your life, trust me), finding certain types of
documents, the Advanced Search page, and individualized preferences. Don’t
skim past these chapters if you know basic Googling! This part is stocked with
tips and little-known facts about Google’s underpublicized features.
Part II: Taming Google
In Part II you discover image search, Google Directory, Google News, Froogle,
and Google Groups. In addition, Chapter 3 covers the many ways in which
Google can be used as an answer engine. An answer engine differs from a
Web search engine by directly delivering basic facts instead of links to Web
pages that might, or might not, contain the basic facts you’re looking for.
Many people don’t realize that Google can dish out answers and facts in ways
that make your information-stoked life much easier.
Chapters 4 through 7 are focused on the main non-Web engines operated
by Google — the ones linked from the home page. Those other engines are
Google Images (photos galore), Google News (an interactive global news-
stand), Google Groups (an archive of nearly twenty-five years of Internet dis-
cussion groups), Froogle (a shopping directory and search site), and Google
Directory.
Part III: Specialty Searching
Part III goes somewhat farther afield to Google’s outlying services. Chapter 8,
which discusses local searching with three relatively new Google services, is
particularly important and interesting. The other three chapters cover spe-
cialty categories of Internet searching such as universities and government
sites, each of which has a dedicated Google engine; the Google Answers ser-
vice, which delivers professional-level research for a small fee; and the
sprawling cauldron of experimentation known as Google Labs. Google Labs
contains the new services Google Video, Google Suggest, and Google Scholar,
each of which is a distinct search engine.

Introduction

Part IV: Putting Google to Work
Part IV starts by describing two ways in which Google can be put to work in
uncommon fashion. First, and for many most importantly, Google can attach
to Web browsers in various ways, offering one-click searching from anywhere
on the Web. I venture to say that the Google Toolbar is the single most impor-
tant Google service beyond the basic search engine, and I strongly recom-
mend that you read Chapter 12. The second method of searching from afar is
the Google Deskbar, which resides on your computer desktop, independent
of the browser.
Speaking of the desktop, Chapter 13 explores Google Desktop, a major new
service that allows users to search their own computers, Google style. Google
Desktop requires an easy download and is free.
Gmail created more Google-related fuss than any other service to come out
of Google in the last two years. There is good reason for all the commotion;
Gmail provides a new way of tackling Web-based e-mail and offers a ton of
storage. It works beautifully, and Chapter 14 explains all the ins and outs.
Finally, Chapter 15 illuminates the simple method by which site owners can put
a Google search box on their pages and customize how search results appear.
Part V: The Business of Google
Part V is about Google’s business services, so it is mostly about advertising.
Chapter 17 covers AdWords (a way of advertising to searchers using key-
words that relate to the advertiser’s products), and Chapter 18 centers on
AdSense, a way for professional Web sites of all types to run Google AdWords
ads and make money doing it. Before those productive chapters, Chapter 16
explains how Google trolls the Web for sites to include in its massive index,
and how your Web site can get favorable treatment.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
Part VI is almost all recreational. Chapters 19 through 22 take you all over the
Web, trying Google-related sites developed by individuals who took advantage
of Google’s standing invitation to build alternate search interfaces. Google’s
index is available to any programmer, and some of the results are spectacu-
larly successful — improvements, even, on Google’s own pages. There are
even Google-related games; if you’ve ever wondered what Googlewhacking is,
head to Chapter 21. The book’s final chapter (and I won’t tolerate any high-
fiving at the mention of the final chapter) points to sites and Weblogs about
Google — even highly critical ones.

Icons Used in This Book
See how big these pages are? We have to put something in these wide mar-
gins, so we came up with icons. Figuring that they might as well be more than
just decorative, we assigned meaning to the pictures you see marking some
paragraphs.
This book is full of these things. They remind you to tip your waitress. Also,
these icons indicate that the paragraph contains an especially usable nugget
of information.
I throw in a lot of these, too, but I forget why. It’ll come to me.
Rarely, I slip into the kind of technobabble that makes people avoid me at
parties. Just slap me when I get like that. And feel free to ignore these para-
graphs if you’re not interested — they don’t contain anything you need to
know.
Using Google is considerably safer than leaping out of an airplane with a sack
full of bowling balls, so I don’t often have reason to issue warnings. But when
I do, get the kids to a safe place and board up the windows.
Where to Go from Here
I don’t know about you, but I’m going to lie down. It’s 2 in the afternoon, for
goodness sake, and time for a nap. If you’re in the mood to keep reading, do it
quietly.
Starting at the beginning never hurts, but if you’re ready for the advanced
stuff, I suggest leaping to the section on search operators in Chapter 2. In the
mood for fun, straight off? Go to the chapters in Part VI. I know I’ve men-
tioned it before, but Chapter 8 is a great place to discover something new
from Google — local searching.
Wake me for dinner, and happy Googling.

Jumping Into
Google

In this part . . .
I
n the first part of Google Search & Rescue For Dummies,
I introduce Google’s basic search functions, which any-
body can try by going to the Google home page. Ah, but
by introduce, I mean that this part dives into keyword
skills of which most people are unaware, to reveal dozens
of ways to maximize your daily Google experience.
Google is good when you know just the bare minimum.
Imagine how much better it can get for a laser-minded,
Web-addicted power user who can blast apart a results
page with a few simple search operators. Are you ready
for this? Because that’s what Part I is all about. 
Chapter 1 sets you up with the overview; Chapter 2 goes
way beyond basic keyword plodding by revealing search
operators, the Advanced Search page, and Google Prefer-
ences. Get ready to hone your skills, sharpen your results,
and project your mind over the vast global information
matrix, diving down like a hawk to spear your personal
bits of wisdom as they scurry through the tangled under-
growth of hidden knowledge. Oh, the power of simple
tools . . . like the home cappuccino maker, for example,
which I’ve been using rather too much lately. But forget
that. The simple tools at hand are single-word commands
that bend the mighty Google to your will and rescue once-
lost information from the abyss of ignorance.
If you’re a Google beginner — which is to say, either a
newcomer or a long-time casual user — reading the two
chapters in Part I will make you more knowledgeable
about Google than anyone you know. More important,
doing so will make you smarter, better informed, con-
nected to sharper resources, and a more skilled online cit-
izen. Brew your coffee and let’s get going. [Editors’ note:
Brad Hill has promised to switch to decaf by the time you
reach Part II.]

In This Chapter
 Getting an overview of Google’s many services and search realms
 Uncovering the hidden side of Google’s business services
 Introducing Google’s tools for programmers
 Understanding why Google is better . . . much better
You’re about to embark on an adventure that will stimulate your mind
and gratify the most urgent desires of your soul. Then, when you’ve fin-
ished watching American Idol, you’ll start discovering Google.
I know what you’re saying: You’ve already discovered Google. Who hasn’t? Not
since the early Web days of 1994 and 1995, when everybody surfed through
Yahoo!, have people flocked so overwhelmingly to a search engine as they
do to Google. Google not only revitalized the search industry but also saved
worthy information from obscurity and rescued countless users from the frus-
tration of futile searching.
During the time since Yahoo! got the ball rolling, many keyword-oriented
search engines have come. Many have gone. Some remain, offering specialty
searches or emulating Google. (Imitation and flattery — you know the drill.)
Now, with Googling a common term in the mainstream vernacular, general
searching of the Web has become standardized into a universal ritual. Anybody
wanting to find an online destination follows this three-step process:
1. Go to Google.
2. Type a few words related to the search goal.
3. Click the search results to visit relevant Web sites.
All well and good. Google is lightning fast and devastatingly accurate. And
the chapters in Part II dismantle general searching to help you maximize your
basic Google experience. But as it turns out, general Web searching is just the
tip of the Google iceberg.

Note: The Google home page is located, naturally, at this URL:
www.google.com
Any user, worldwide, can use that page to get the American version of
Google. However, Google operates national versions of its service, using the
domain suffix unique to those countries. Again, each of these national ver-
sions can be called up by anyone in any country. Here are a few examples:
www.google.ca (Canada)
www.google.fr (France)
www.google.co.uk (England)
Beyond Keywords
The term search engine, so apt for the lumbering, early-generation monsters
that crunched through the Web looking for sites, seems only fractionally fit-
ting for Google. Rather, Google should be called an information engine. Or a
knowledge life-form. The stuff you get from Google might come from its vast
and smart index of Web pages, or it might come from other indices seam-
lessly woven into the core data dump. Some of the usefulness that you can
pry out of Google, such as Weblogging, comes from autonomous companies
that Google has acquired and put under its service umbrella. However you
use Google, greater awareness of what’s under the hood is certain to make
your online life easier, better informed, and more fluid.
The following sections furnish a quick survey of Google’s information engine,
including and beyond general keyword searching.
Finding all sorts of stuff
In Google, basic Web searching couldn’t be simpler. The next chapter covers
the basics, plus powerful ways of grabbing the information you want quickly.
In addition to offering traditional Web searching, Google blends other types
of searching into the basic keyword process:
 Google Directory: Yahoo! set the standard of integrated searching
(through a keyword engine) and browsing (through a topical directory).
In the beginning, Yahoo!’s search engine searched the directory, which
was carefully hand-constructed by a staff of editors. Yahoo! still builds
its directory manually. Google also presents a topical directory for
browsing, and you can search it separately from the basic Web search.
See Chapter 7.

Part I: Jumping Into Google 

 Newsgroup reader: Newsgroups make up the portion of the Internet
called Usenet, which is far older (and probably still bigger in some mea-
sure) than the Web. It has more than fifty thousand groups, organized
by topic, covering everything from astrophysics to David Letterman.
Usenet is a hangout for academicians, pornographers, armchair pundits,
and nearly everyone else. It’s a wild-and-wooly realm that’s normally
accessed through a dedicated computer program called a newsgroup
reader. Outlook Express and other e-mail programs contain newsgroup-
reading features. Google got into the act by purchasing the old Deja
News, the groundbreaking company that first put Usenet on the Web.
Google presents a deep archive of searchable newsgroup messages.
Furthermore, it lets you establish an identity and post messages to
groups, all through your Web browser. See Chapter 6.
 Image finder: The Web is a picturesque place. Every photograph and
drawing that you see on a Web page is a distinct file residing at a specific
Internet location, and Google knows how to search that tremendous
store of images. See Chapter 2.

Chapter 1: Google Saves the Day, Every Day
Life without Google
In my life as an online citizen (no, I don’t get out
much), two destinations are indispensable. One
is Yahoo!, a gargantuan domain that provides
more free services than a sane person would
try to count. The other is Google, which makes
my virtual movements faster and more exact
than ever. Online life without either is incon-
ceivable. The amazing thing is that Google has
been around only since the fall of 1999. Yahoo!
has been building its reputation and service
platform for more than ten years. (May 1, 2005,
was Yahoo!’s tenth birthday.) And it can be
argued that Google has embedded itself into the
lifestyles of ordinary Internet citizens and the
business practices of companies more pro-
foundly and securely than Yahoo! has. Whereas
Yahoo! spent millions on the “Do you Yahoo!?”
ad campaign, everybody started saying “Google
this” and “Google that” with little or no formal
advertising from Google.
Yahoo! is certainly more diversified than
Google, with a portion of its empire devoted to
nearly every activity in which a person could
engage online: playing games, booking travel,
researching stocks, meeting a soul mate, chat-
ting about nothing, watching music videos — on
and on and on. Yahoo! operates the most popu-
lar G-rated, legal, free activity platform on the
open Internet; in March 2005 Yahoo! had 165
million registered users and 345 million unique
monthly visitors. With all this, Yahoo! has, until
recently, forsaken its roots as a search engine
and left the fertile field of keyword matching
open to Google.
I wrote Yahoo! For Dummies and Google For
Dummies. Each service is a cornerstone of the
Internet. Prediction is a risky business, but
when I’m in a divining mood, I can easily see
Google becoming the most important online ser-
vice in history, approaching the geek-idealist’s
dream of indexing every bit of human knowl-
edge and virtual expression, with an awareness
of the surrounding context and with each con-
tribution ranked by its peers and instantly
accessible. A foolish vision? The surprising part
is how closely Google is chasing it already.
Life without Google? With each passing day, the
thought becomes more inconceivable.

 Shopping assistant: This is one of Google’s huge, underappreciated
strengths. For a long time, Froogle was unknown by just about every-
body (who hadn’t read Google For Dummies, that is). Then Google
moved it from obscurity to the home page of the British and American
sites, and everybody saw the light. Comparisons to Yahoo! Shopping are
difficult to avoid. The two services differ crucially, in that you never
actually buy things through a Google transaction system as you some-
times can in Yahoo!. (For example, Google has no Google Wallet for stor-
ing credit card information for one-click purchasing.) Google has two
main shopping services, Froogle and Google Catalogs. You use Froogle
to find shopping sites that sell things you want. Google Catalogs —
arguably the more fun of Google’s two shopping services — gives you a
paper-free sense of accessing a mail-order universe. See Chapter 4.
 Local search engine: Most search pundits and consumer focus groups
agree that local searching will eventually be just as important as global
Web searching. By local searching, I mean a searching for stuff that exists
in a physical neighborhood — on streets near your home. All the big
search engines are getting into local action, and Google is flat-out win-
ning the race as of this writing. I’m not saying so to sell this book;
nobody else has put together a combination of local search, local map-
ping, and local photography as Google has — and this is just the begin-
ning. See Chapter 8.
14
Part I: Jumping Into Google 
The mythical Internet library
The World Wide Web was developed to bring
order to the chaotic Internet, which had been
lurking in academia and the government since
the 1960s. Because the Internet was regarded
primarily as an information source — more than
an entertainment medium or a community
space — it was natural to imagine the quick
construction of a universal, all-inclusive online
library. Through the years, I’ve often heard
people mistakenly speak of the Internet as an
information realm in which one could find any-
thing, read any book, and access all knowledge.
But the truth splintered away from that ideal.
First, the Web became a distinct and
autonomous entity with its own content, disre-
garding for the most part the academic material
that was already online. Second, regular folks
who stormed into the new virtual playground
were interested in other, more recreational pur-
suits than learning. So the mecca of unlimited
access to knowledge withered away from 
reality — and even from the imagination.
I am not going to imply that Google single-hand-
edly manifests an Alexandrian library of human
knowledge (yet). However, through the astound-
ing accuracy of its search results, Google does
ease access to an unprecedented breadth of
knowledge. (And the nascent Google Print pro-
gram, which seeks to digitize entire libraries of
books for searching, certainly contributes to the
“Internet library” ideal.) To whatever extent the
Internet comprises the communal content of the
human mind, Google illuminates the gray matter
with clarity and usefulness. Want to know
something? Google it. That’s the modern recipe
for learning in this information-saturated age.

 International newsstand: In one of the most dramatic additions to the
Google spectrum of features, Google News has replaced Yahoo! News as
the default headline engine on countless screens. Almost unbelievable in
its depth and range, Google News presents continually updated links to
established news sources in dozens of countries, putting a global spin
on every story of the day. See Chapter 5.
These features (except for Google Directory) hook into Google’s home page,
and it is easy to transfer a search from one of these engines to another. (Just
click the links above the keyword box after entering a keyword.) At the same
time, each of these engines stands on its own as an independent search tool.
Other features, sketched next, exist more in the background but are no less
important than the high-profile search realms.
Hidden strengths
You might be surprised to find what Google can tell you if prompted in cer-
tain ways. Active Googlers stumble across some of these features in the
course of daily rummaging, because Google spits out information in unre-
quested configurations when it thinks you need it. (Yes, Google does seem
like a thinking animal sometimes.) Other chapters describe exactly how to
coax explicit types of search results from the site. Here, my aim is to briefly
summarize power features you might not be aware of:
 Document repository: Most people, most of the time, search for Web
pages. But many other types of viewable (or listenable) pieces of con-
tent are available on the Internet. For example, almost every modern
computer comes with the capability to view PDF files, which are docu-
ments such as articles, white papers, research texts, and financial state-
ments that retain their original formatting instead of being altered to fit a
Web page. Google includes documents other than Web pages in its gen-
eral search results and also lets you narrow any search to a specific file
type. See Chapter 2.
 Government and university tracker: Not to get all paranoid on you, but
if you’re into watching your back, the first of these features could prove
helpful. More benignly, Google reserves distinct portions of its search
engine for government domains and another for university domains.
This arrangement has uses explored in Chapter 9.
 Scholarly resource: If you ever imagined that Google was a sort of
library card catalogue to the Web, Google Scholar brings that idea closer
to home. This dedicated index digs up academic papers and scholarly
books — though not to read, in all cases. The Google Scholar engine is
great for finding both titles and citations to those titles in other papers
and books.
15
Chapter 1: Google Saves the Day, Every Day

 Keyword suggestion tool: One of the great (if unrecognized) difficulties of
high-quality Internet searching is finding the useful keyword or keyphrase.
Google Suggest offers productive keyphrase suggestions as you type in
the keyword box.
These and other new aspects of the Google experience came from a dedi-
cated technology incubation project called Google Labs. Remember when
entire businesses were built solely on cultivating online ideas? Most of them
crashed and burned, adding to the rubble of the exploded Internet bubble.
Google is modestly, but importantly, continuing the incubating tradition by
evolving ways of enhancing its information engine. See Chapter 11.
Answers of all sorts
One problem with the Web as an information source is the question of authen-
ticity. Anybody can put up a Web site and publish information that might or
might not be factual. True expertise is difficult to verify on the Web.
Two solutions exist to the verification problem: standard reference sources
and on-demand professional research services. Neither is likely to be found
on a typical Web site, professional and authoritative though that site might
be. The desire for reference-style answers has given birth to dedicated
answer engines such as Answers.com (formerly Gurunet).
Google, recognizing that its users sometimes need a quick answer rather than
a list of Web sites that might (or might not) contain that answer, has built
answer-engine capability into its Web engine. In some cases Google delivers
the answer directly; in other cases it links you to an outside site that displays
your answer. Some of the answers supplied by Google include eminently
practical information such as stock quotes, the weather, movie show times,
calculator functions, word definitions, phone book information, delivery ser-
vice tracking, and airport status.
The second solution to the verification problem, on-demand professional
research, is provided at Google Answers. Google Answers is . . . well, the
answer. Staffed by a large crew of freelance researchers in many subjects,
Google Answers lets you ask questions and receive customized answers —
for a price. How much? That’s up to you; an auction system is used whereby
you request an answer for a specified price, and individual researchers either
take on your question or not. See Chapter 10.
One nice touch: Google maintains a directory of previously asked and
answered questions, sorted by topic. Browsing through the archives is a
nice way to audition the quality of the service (it’s good), and you might find
that your query has already been solved.
16
Part I: Jumping Into Google 

Portable information butler
Google provides excellent results for the lazy, one-stop Internet searcher.
And don’t we all deserve a search engine that works hard on our behalf? Well,
Google goes beyond the call of duty by following you around even after you’ve
left the site. Only if you want it to, of course.
You can rip the Google engine right out of its site (so to speak) and take it
with you while traipsing around the Web in three main ways:
 Google Toolbar: If you’re aware of Google Toolbar, you’re probably
using it. You should be, anyway. If this is the first you’ve heard of it,
today is the first day of the rest of your online citizenship. Internet life
will never be the same. Google Toolbar bolts right into your browser, up
near the top where your other toolbars reside. It enables you to launch a
Google search without surfing to the Google site. I bet that in some dic-
tionaries a picture of the Google Toolbar is next to the definition of cool.
See Chapter 12.
 Google Deskbar: Deskbar takes independence even further by separat-
ing Google from the Web browser entirely. Google Deskbar sits right on
your computer desktop, and displays search results in its own window.
See Chapter 12.
Google searching is made easy and portable by Mozilla browsers — Firefox
and Netscape, which incorporate search bars within the browser that are 
naturally configured (and can be customized) to take your search queries
directly to Google.
Google’s portable features insinuate the service into your online life more
deeply than merely bookmarking the site. Google will take over your mind.
But that’s a good thing.
And now for something 
completely different
The Google empire is young and relatively small compared to the Yahoo!
powerhouse. In building itself out, Google has made a few key acquisitions:
 Blogger.com: One of the most used platforms for Weblogging (easy
online journaling), Blogger.com provides easy tools for creating online
journals and amateur news sites.
 Picasa: Picasa is an image-sorting and image-editing program that was
popular when Google got its hands on it, and then became much more
popular when Google eliminated the price and gave the program away.
17
Chapter 1: Google Saves the Day, Every Day

 Keyhole: A satellite-imaging company, Keyhole offers a subscription ser-
vice through which users can view the earth and zoom down to see
details with amazing precision.
All three of these companies operate somewhat independently of Google,
while definitely being under Google’s direction. For the Google user searching
with Google, Blogger and Picasa don’t play any part in the Google experience.
Keyhole is somewhat integrated with Google Local (see Chapter 8).
Google the Business Partner
With the Google AdWords program, Internet advertising has been brought to
the masses — and boy, people are eating it up.
AdWords (see Chapter 17) is a revolutionary system that lets anybody with a
Web site advertise for a reasonable cost on the Google search results page.
This exposure, on one of the Internet’s most highly trafficked domains, was
inaccessible and unthinkably expensive in the past.
AdWords is stunningly innovative but also complicated. Here’s the gist: You
hook a small ad to certain keywords and assign a price you’re willing to pay.
That price is based on clickthroughs, which occur when a Googler conducts a
search with one of your keywords, sees your ad on the results page, and
clicks the ad to visit your Web site. Other site owners might have hooked
their ads to the same keyword(s); if they offered a higher price per click-
through, their ads are listed above yours. No matter how much you pay, your
final bill is determined by actual visits to your site, and you can set a limit to
the total amount you pay.
All this is handled automatically, making AdWords a surprisingly sophisti-
cated system. The complexities are explained in Chapter 17. AdWords isn’t a
search service, but the program is definitely part of the Google lifestyle for
entrepreneurial types with Web sites ready for increased traffic.
Note: You might be wondering whether the AdWords system destroys the
famous integrity of a Google search. Have hordes of Internet advertisers pur-
chased placement in the search results pages, warping the accuracy of
Google’s engine? It’s a good question because other search engines have
been in public-relations trouble over this issue. The answer, emphatically, is
no — Google AdWords don’t pollute the purity of search results. The ads are
placed over to the side, easily visible but not mingled with search results.
And higher-priced sponsorships are placed above the search listing, in a
manner that clearly differentiates them from the objective results.
18
Part I: Jumping Into Google 

Google for Programmers
All search engines operate by building an index of both Web pages and the
content of those pages. This index is constructed with the help of bots (soft-
ware robots), sometimes called spiders or crawlers. The index is a search
engine’s prime asset, the ever-shifting body of information that the engine
matches against your keywords to deliver results. The formula that each
search site uses to compile and search the index is a closely guarded secret.
Although Google doesn’t breathe a word about its indexing formulas, it does
do something else that’s unprecedented and exciting. Google has released its
application programming interface (API) to the public. An API enables soft-
ware programmers to incorporate one program or body of data into another
program. For example, Microsoft releases its Windows APIs to authorized
developers who write stand-alone Windows software. Google’s API lets soft-
ware geniuses write programs that can access Google’s index directly, bypass-
ing the familiar interface at Google’s site.
The public API is more important than it might seem at first. In the short time
that the API has been available, many alternate Googles have sprung up, each
a legitimate and authorized new method of Googling. A few people have cre-
ated instant-message conduits to Google, so you can launch a search while
chatting in certain IM programs. Some graphic presentations of Google search
results that are being developed are, frankly, mind-blowing. These and many
other Google stunts are explored in Chapters 19 and 20.
Google’s expansion through third-party development lends variety to a search
experience that is basically a rather drab chore — no matter how skillfully
accomplished. And, like other Google innovations, the public API will probably
serve to drive Google even deeper into the mass consciousness of the Internet
community. Google will take over your soul. This, too, is a good thing.
If you’re of a particularly geekish mindset or have some programming skills,
you should know about Google Code, a clearinghouse for the publication of
Google APIs. Check it here:

The Greatness of Google
In this chapter, I serve a sample platter of Google’s buffet of services. But one
central question remains: What makes Google so great in the first place? How
did it become so rampantly popular that it started a new era of competition
among search engines? Those, of course, are two questions, not one, and my
inability to count is one reason Stephen Hawking doesn’t return my phone
19
Chapter 1: Google Saves the Day, Every Day

calls. (In typing that little quip, I wasn’t sure how to spell Hawking’s first name.
Naturally, I Googled it.)
Google’s success depends to some extent on the size of its index, which has
long passed the billion-page mark — Google claims to have the largest Web
search index in the world.
But the big index is hardly the entire story. More important is a certain intelli-
gence with which the index interprets keywords. Google’s groundbreaking
innovation in this department is its capability to not only find pages but also
rank them based on their popularity. The legendary Google page rank is deter-
mined largely by measuring how many links to that page exist on other sites
all over the Web. The logic here is simple and hard to refute: Page A links to
page B for one reason only, and that is because page B contains something
worthwhile. If pages C, D, E, F, and G also link to page B, odds increase that
page B has something important going for it. If five-hundred thousand pages
link to page B, it is without question truly important in some way.
This explanation is grossly simplified, and Google isn’t divulging details. But
the backlink feature is the advantage that makes Google search results so 
fantastic. Google can still dish up a clunker from time to time, frequently
because of poor keywords entered by the user. And dead pages haven’t been
eliminated. But when it comes to finding basic information or Web destina-
tions, Google delivers stunning results with incredible speed and accuracy.
Beyond Google’s legendary indexing algorithm lies another aspect to its suc-
cess. Users like Google not only for the quality of its results but also for the
speed and reliability with which they are delivered. In Google’s early days,
as I was getting to know the service, my first and strongest impression was
speed! Google receives hundreds of millions of daily search queries. It distrib-
utes the ponderous computing strain placed upon its system by using a
gigantic global network of computers. How many? Google doesn’t say, but the
figure is certainly in the tens of thousands. Google values numbers more than
pricey quality, and its computers are average machines. The software linking
them keeps the system robust, and when a computer fails (which happens
every day), others pick up the slack. So part of Google’s winning formula lies
in raw computing horsepower and resiliency to system failures.
Google calmly digests keywords in almost ninety languages. Googling is the
one activity that unites the entire Internet citizenry, and Google has forever
altered the Internet landscape and the ease with which we move through it.

T
his is where we get down to business. Searching for sites, finding files,
wrangling with results, and generally raiding Google for all it’s worth. You
might be thinking, “I know how to search Google. You type a few words, press
Enter, blink rapidly, and view the results.” I won’t comment on disturbing facial
tics, but that process is essentially correct. And if you’re impatient to explore
more esoteric stuff, feel free to skip this chapter. I won’t be hurt, bitter, or
resentful. (And if I am hurt, bitter, or resentful, you’ll never know it, so don’t
trouble yourself over my misery.)
Now, for those of you remaining, I’m going to send you each a million dollars.
Which pales beside the wealth of useful information that follows in these
pages. I get the basics out of the way quickly and lead you straight to the finer
points of the search results page, advanced searching, narrowing your search
results in various ways, and other life-altering techniques.
So read on. Your check is in the mail.

Setting Preferences
Many people breeze through Google umpteen times a day without bothering
to set their preferences — or even being aware that there are preferences to
set. A recent Internet study asked users whether they would rather set Google
preferences or get bathed in chocolate syrup. Sentiment was overwhelmingly
against setting Google preferences. But I’m here to tell you that the five set-
tings on the Preferences page (see Figure 2-1) enhance the Google experience
far more than the effort required to adjust them.
To adjust Google preferences, click the Preferences link on the Google home
page or go here:
www.google.com/preferences
If you set your preferences and later return to the Preferences page by manu-
ally entering the preceding URL, your browser displays an unadjusted
Preferences page (without your settings). That’s because your Preferences
page has a distinct URL with your preferences built in to it. For example, after
selecting English as Google’s default language for your visits, the URL
appears like this:
www.google.com/preferences?hl=en

Your best bet for reaching the Preferences page after first setting your prefer-
ences (when you want to readjust them, for example) is to use the Preferences
link on the home page.
A single basic process changes one preference or several. Just follow these
steps:
1. Go to the Preferences page.
As mentioned, just click the Preferences link on the home page or go
directly to www.google.com/preferences.
2. Use the pull-down menus, check boxes, and radio buttons to make
your adjustments.
3. Click the Save Preferences button.
4. In the confirmation window (which merely says “Your preferences
have been saved” and is unnecessary), click the OK button.
The next sections describe what you can accomplish on the Preferences page.

Chapter 2: Reclaiming Your Time from Wasteful Searching
How Google remembers your preferences
When you set preferences in Google, the site is
customized for you every time you visit it, as
long as you’re using the same computer through
which you set the preferences. To provide this
convenience, Google must place a cookie (a
small information file) in your computer. The site
and the cookie high-five each other whenever
you visit Google, and then the site appears
according to your settings. For this system to
work, the reception of cookies must be turned
on in your browser.
Some people are militantly anti-cookie, claim-
ing that the data files represent an invasion of
computer privacy. Indeed, some sites plant
cookies that track your Internet movements and
identify you to advertisers.
The truth is, Google’s cookie is fairly aggressive.
It gets planted when you first visit the site,
whether or not you visit the Preferences page.
Once planted, the Google cookie records
your clicks in Google and builds a database of
visitor behavior in its search results pages. For
example, Google knows how often users click
the first search result and to what extent they
explore results lower on the page. Google uses
this information to evaluate the effectiveness of
its service and to improve it.
As to privacy, Google does indeed share aggre-
gate information with advertisers and various
third parties and even publicizes knowledge
about how the service is used by its millions of
visitors. The key word is aggregate. Google’s
privacy policy states that individual information
is never divulged except by proper legal proce-
dure, such as a warrant or a subpoena, or by
individual consent. The privacy policy is pub-
lished on this page:
www.google.com/privacy.html
I have no problem with the Google cookie or
with cookies in general. The convenience is
helpful, and I don’t mind adding to the aggregate
information. It’s rather comforting being a data
droplet in Google’s information tsunami.

The international Google
If you’re reading the English-language edition of this book, you probably
enjoy Google in its default English interface. If you’re reading the Icelandic
edition of this book, please send me a copy — I want to see whether my jokes
are funnier in a chilly language. Whatever your native language, you should
know that you can get Google to appear in one of dozens of languages unpro-
nounceable by George W. Bush (besides English, I mean).
Interface Language is the first Google preference, and it adjusts the appear-
ance of certain pages — specifically, the home page, the Preferences page,
the Advanced Search page, and many Help pages and intrasite directories.
Changing the interface language does not alter the language on the search
results page or the search results themselves. (To change the language on
those pages, you use the Search Language preference, up next.)
The Interface Language preference changes the Interface Language list in the
pull-down menu! So if you choose an obscure language that uses an unfamil-
iar alphabet while playing around (it’s irresistible), you might have trouble
finding your way back to the mother tongue by means of the drop-down
menu. But Google does provide a link to Google in English on the home page
of most non-English language interfaces.
Google is nothing if not occasionally silly, and Interface Language offers a few
must-try languages:
 Elmer Fudd: First on my favorites list, Elmer Fudd (or should I say
Ewmew Fudd) capriciously changes all Rs and Ls to Ws. On the home
page, Groups is now Gwoups, and Directory has been cartoonized to
Diwectowy. Most hilariously of all, the I’m Feeling Lucky button is dena-
tured to I’m Feewing Wucky. Before changing the language menu back to
its original state, be sure to ponder the difference between Twaditional
and Simpwified Chinese.
 Pig Latin: Ouyay owknay owhay isthay orksway.
 Hacker: Changes alphabet letters to numerals and symbols wherever
possible (pretty much everywhere), rendering a semicoherent page best
comprehended after several bags of potato chips and a six-pack of soda.
(See Figure 2-2.)
 Interlingua: A vaguely Euro blend of tourism-speak roughly understand-
able by nearly everyone.
 Klingon: If I have to explain it, you don’t watch enough Star Trek. In fact,
the folks at Google should bone up on their reruns, too, because the
term is Klingonese, not Klingon. (Have they no honor?)
All right, stop playing around with the languages. Let’s move on.
24
Part I: Jumping Into Google 

Most non-English interface languages present a version of the Google home
page tailored to that language. In some cases, the Froogle and Desktop links
are missing, à la 2004 — or the Google News link might be missing. It’s a
shame, because I long to see “Fwoogle” in the Elmer Fudd language. If you
usually navigate Google from the home page, have some familiarity with
English, and are trying to decide between your native language and English,
you might get more convenience from English.
Searching for non-English pages
After you have the Google interface speaking your language, you can turn
your attention to searching for Web pages written in certain languages.
The language you search for doesn’t need to match the language you search
in. In other words, the first two preferences can be set to different languages.
Furthermore, you can select more than one language in the Search Language
setting, whereas the Interface Language preference, naturally, can be only one
language at a time.
Use Search Language to narrow your search results by language. Choosing
French, for example, returns Web pages written only in French. Use the check
boxes to select as many languages as you want.
Figure 2-2:

the mythical
Hacker
language.
25
Chapter 2: Reclaiming Your Time from Wasteful Searching

If you don’t select any languages, leaving the Search Language preference in
its default setting, your search results do not discriminate based on language.
You’re likely to see an international array of pages if you rummage through
enough results.
G-rated searching
Google uses a filter called SafeSearch to screen out pornography from Web
page and image searches. In its default setting (moderate), SafeSearch applies
fairly strict filtering to image searches and leaves Web search results unedited.
Change the setting to strict for harsher filtering of images and clean Web page
searches. You can turn off the filter entirely for an unbiased search session. You
select the filtering strength on the Preferences page, as shown in Figure 2-1.
SafeSearch operates automatically but can be modified manually by the
Google staff. They accept suggestions of sites and images that should be sub-
ject to the adult-content filter. If you come across any objectionable material
through a Google search (with SafeSearch set to moderate or strict), feel free
to send a link to the offending page or image to the following e-mail address:
safesearch@google.com
Opening the floodgates
You can increase the number of search results that appear on the page, rais-
ing it from the default ten results. I think it’s a good idea, so I keep my prefer-
ence set at the maximum — one hundred results per page.
Google reminds you that shorter pages are displayed more quickly, which is a
good point for people who hit the site for lightning-quick searches many times
a day. Google’s results are so uncannily accurate that you might usually need
only ten results. Still, I like the higher number because the long page of search
results arrives more rapidly than shorter pages at competing search engines.
Furthermore, I have the impatient attitude of a demanding Web surfer, and I
never like calling up a second page of search results. If the content I want isn’t
on the first page of results, I usually try new keywords, so stocking the results
page with one hundred hits gives me a better chance of quick success.
You might not agree with my reasoning, in which case you should leave the
number or results set to the default or choose a medium number of results
from the drop-down menu.
26
Part I: Jumping Into Google 

Google is fast no matter how many results per page you request. The only thing
that might hold you back is your modem speed. If you access the Internet using
a high-speed connection (cable modem, DSL, corporate, or university connec-
tion), you might as well set the results number to 100 and be done with it.
New windows
The Results Window setting is an important preference setting in my life. It
consists of a single check box which, when checked, opens a Web page in a
new window when you click a search result. This is a useful way of staying
anchored in the search results page, from which you might want to sample
several Web pages that match your keywords. Without this preference, your
browser opens the Web pages in the same window that Google is in, forcing
you to Back-button your way back to Google if you want to see the search
results again. And if you drill deeply into a site, it becomes even more diffi-
cult to get back to Google.
If you dislike multiple browser windows cluttering your desktop, leave the
Results Window box unchecked. If you prefer a hybrid experience in which
you sometimes want to anchor at Google while exploring several search hits,
leave the box unchecked and get in the habit of right-clicking search result
links when you want a new window. Choose Open in New Window from the
right-click (shortcut) menu that your browser displays.
If you use a browser that displays Web pages in tabs within a master window,
such as Firefox, Netscape, or Opera, Google can still open results in a new
window for you. The Google search aids in Firefox (one of which is built in to
the browser and the other of which is a version of the Google Toolbar called
Googlebar) also can be set to open Google’s search results in a new tab — my
favored setting. But that setting works only when you enter keywords into
the built-in Google keyword box or the Googlebar. See Chapter 12 for the
whole deal about Google toolbars.
Basic Web Searches
Searching the Web is when you draw close to the life-form called Google.
Entering a keyword is like venturing near the multilimbed Goddess of
Knowledge and basking in the blazing glory of her wisdom. Or something. It’s
just a Web search, but with results so astute that you can’t help wondering
whether a person — a person who knows you very, very well — is lurking
inside the machine.
27
Chapter 2: Reclaiming Your Time from Wasteful Searching

The Google home page is a reactionary expression against the 1990s trend
that turned search engines into busy, all-purpose information portals. (See
Figures 2-3 and 2-4.) Yahoo!, Lycos, Excite, and others engaged in portal wars
in which victory seemed to depend on which site could clutter the page with
the most horoscopes, weather forecasts, news headlines, and stock market
bulletins. This loud and lavish competition resulted from the failure of plain
search engines to earn the traffic and money necessary to keep their busi-
nesses afloat. They piled more features onto their pages and, in some cases,
ruined their integrity by selling preferred placement in search results. During
this mad gold rush, some specialty engines retained their primary focus on
Web searching.
These days, in the reborn era of pure search, Google is not the only engine
with a streamlined, gunk-free home page. In fact, major competitors such as
Yahoo! and MSN Search have followed Google’s design lead on their search
engine pages. In the former case, it’s not too much to say that Yahoo! has
explicitly copied Google, as you can see here:
search.yahoo.com

Google has embraced the purity of searching with an ad-free, horoscope-
absent home page that leaves no doubt that searching is the task at hand.
And its search results are so good that it has singly reshaped the search
industry. Lycos, Excite, Netscape, and others barely register on anybody’s
radar as search engines, attractive though they may be as broad Internet 
portals. Some of them use the Google engine to deliver Web search results.
In fact, until 2004, Yahoo! used Google search results in response to user
queries. Since then, Yahoo! has developed its own search engine. Still, for mil-
lions of people who discovered or rediscovered the rewards of Internet
searching through Google, to search something is to Google it.

Chapter 2: Reclaiming Your Time from Wasteful Searching
How insensitive!
Rules dictating when to use uppercase or low-
ercase letters have taken a beating in the
Internet’s linguistic culture. The prevailing dialect
of chat rooms, message boards, and e-mail dis-
cards the uppercase start to sentences as if it
were an outgrown fad. Fortunately, nobody has
to spruce up their typing habits for Google’s sake
because the search engine is oblivious to case
issues — the technical term is case-insensitive.

So let’s get to it. A six-year-old would find the Google home page easy to use.
When you log on to Google’s home page, the mouse cursor is already waiting
for you in the keyword search box. Type a word — any word. Or more than
one. Or type a sentence in plain English. Press Enter or click the Google
Search button. The results are on your screen within seconds.
Note the I’m Feeling Lucky button next to the Google Search button. Clicking
it instead of the Google Search button takes you directly to the top search
result’s Web page instead of to the search results page. Only Google could
dare to invite its users to skip the search results page and make it work out
so well, so often. Try it. Remember: It’s not a random-search button, and it
works only when you’ve typed a keyword.
The links atop the keyword box — Web, Images, Groups, News, Froogle,
Local — take you to the home pages of those sections when clicked. (A
Desktop link also appears if you’ve installed Google Desktop, described in
Chapter 13.) If you’re on a search results page and click a tab, however, you
get results from that link’s engine instantly. So, the tabs shuttle between
home pages when you don’t have search results yet and shuttle between
search results pages when you have one set of results in any area.
On to the search results page. That’s where the action is.
30
Part I: Jumping Into Google 
Choosing the right keywords
Google is possibly the most forgiving search
engine ever created. You can type just about
any darn thing into it and get good results.
Sometimes you can even get away with sloppy
spelling — Google often catches it and sug-
gests the correct spelling. Much of the crafty
keywording I wrote about in Internet Searching
For Dummies goes out the window in Google,
which turns vague hints and plain-English
queries into gold. Still, the first reason for dis-
appointing search results is poor keyword
choice, so some tips apply.
The golden rule in Internet searching is that
more keywords deliver fewer results. So pile
them on to narrow your search. With that tech-
nique, however, you run the risk of having con-
flicting or obfuscating keywords, creating a
mixed bag of search results. Ideally, you want
to concisely convey to Google what you need.
I’ve found that two or three is the golden
number of keywords to use in Google searches.
Tracking software on my Web sites tells me
which search queries get to my pages, and usu-
ally the two-word strings reach my best stuff.
On the other end of the spectrum, many people
get good results by typing entire sentences in
the keyword box. Google eliminates certain
little words such as what and why, which
might seem to devalue questions but doesn’t in
practice.
Beware of words that have more than one
meaning, especially if you search for one key-
word at a time.
For power searching, in which the goal is not
more results but fewer, better results, use the
Advanced Search pages or the search opera-
tors, both described later in this chapter.

Understanding the Google Results Page
Every Google search results page for a Web search includes at least three
basic types of information:
 A summary of the search results
 The search results themselves
 A few things you can do with the results
Note: Many (but not all) search result pages contain additional types of infor-
mation, such as sponsored links (text ads on the right side of the page and
sometimes also above the search results), news links from Google News
when your keywords are newsworthy, Froogle results when Google interprets
your keywords to be oriented toward products, and results from your own
hard drive if you are running Google Desktop (see Chapter 13).
As you can see in Figure 2-5, a Google results page can bristle with information
when operating on all cylinders. The results summary is located in the shaded
bar, above and to the right of the results list. The summary tells you how many
total results for your keywords exist in the Google index and how long the
search took. (Rarely does a Google search require more than two seconds.)
Next to the results summary, your keywords are displayed as links. When you
click one of those links, you go to Answers.com for a definition of the word.
This seems a bit gratuitous — if you didn’t know what a word means, why
would you use it as a keyword? But don’t underestimate the variety of ways
that people use Google, including as a dictionary. Answers.com also func-
tions as a thesaurus, so if a certain keyword isn’t delivering good results, per-
haps a synonym (derived from Answers.com) would. Note that the links to
Answers.com appear only when Google’s language is set to English — natu-
rally enough, because Answers.com is primarily an English dictionary.
The search results consist of the page name, which is hyperlinked to the page
itself. Below that is a short bit of relevant text from the page. Below the text
you can see the page’s URL, which is there for information value and is not a
link. Next to the URL is a number indicating the size of the page. Glancing at
the page size helps you decide whether or not to visit it; pages more than 50K
(that’s 50 kilobytes) are too large for a quick visit if you don’t have high-speed
Internet access.
The Google staff doesn’t compose the page title or the accompanying text,
which explains why they’re a little goofy sometimes and incoherent other
times. The page title is created by the page developer. Some page designers
forget how important the page title is, or they pack in lots of words to try
and get the page higher on the search results pages of search engines such
as Google. (The tactic generally doesn’t work in Google, as I explain in
Chapter 16.)
31
Chapter 2: Reclaiming Your Time from Wasteful Searching

The text below the result link is not necessarily descriptive of the result page
or even cogent. Google clips sentences and fragments that contain your key-
words and presents them as evidence that you have a good hit. This is more
useful than you might think. In fact, it’s absolutely amazing how often a
glance at the first few results and their accompanying text answers a search
query without even visiting an outside page.
Note: The result link does not identify where on the result page your key-
words are located. Not uncommonly, you link to a page and must then search
in that page for relevant information — a headache when the page is long.
You can always use your browser’s Find feature to locate specific words on
any Web page. However, the problem is solved more elegantly by the Google
Toolbar, as described in Chapter 12.

Breaking Down Web Search Results
Three other elements are found on nearly every search results page. They are
 The Google cache
 Similar pages
 Indented results
These features enhance the value of the results page. The first two, in partic-
ular, represent hidden power that many people don’t take advantage of.
The Google cache
A cache (pronounced “cash”) is a storage area for computer files. Google
maintains an enormous cache of Web pages. Don’t confuse the cache with
Google’s Web index (which I describe more fully in Chapter 16). Actually, for
practical purposes, it doesn’t matter whether you confuse them or not, but
they are different.
The index is a database of Web page content, stripped of its formatting. The
cache contains the pages themselves. By and large, clicking the Cached link
provides a quicker display of the target page because you’re getting it from
Google’s computer instead of from the Internet at large.
So why would you ever not use the Cached link instead of the main page title
link? Mainly because the cached page is not necessarily up-to-the-minute,
especially with pages that change frequently (such as Weblogs and news
sites). If you view the cached version of a page that you know changes fre-
quently and is dated, such as the front page of a newspaper site, you can see
that Google’s cache is a day or more behind. For users without high-speed
Internet access, it’s more convenient to pull from the cache when looking for a
big page (about 50K or so) that doesn’t change much. You might also use the
Cached link if the page title link refuses to display the page for some reason.
One disadvantage to pulling up a cached search result is the Google notice
that appears atop all cached pages (see Figure 2-6). That is one bulky notice,
taking up about two vertical inches of screen space on a screen resolution of
800 x 600. Besides being an eyesore, the notice sometimes makes additional
scrolling necessary if you want to see the entire page. If you get tired of the
notice, click its link to the uncached page.
33
Chapter 2: Reclaiming Your Time from Wasteful Searching

The cache link comes in handy when you want to take a brief trip back in
time, to view a Web page that you know has changed or has been taken away.
Once, David Letterman, on his late-night show, complained that the CBS site
displayed a picture of Letterman’s rival, Jay Leno. Letterman’s show is taped
in the afternoon, and by the time the show aired CBS had removed the
offending image. Many people, including myself, wanted to preserve the
amusing gaffe, and we did so by calling up the old page in Google’s cache.
Similar pages
The Similar Pages link is interesting although not always tremendously
useful. Clicking this link starts a new search for pages that somehow resem-
ble the original search result. Sorry to be vague, but Google isn’t very talka-
tive about its Similar Pages formula.
The results are interesting and more diverse than you might expect. You’d
think the search would yield a narrowed set of results, but my experience is
to the contrary. Search for Britney Spears, for example, and you get a solid
set of results including fan sites. Click the Similar Pages link under britney
spears.com, and you get a far-ranging assortment of pages, including unoffi-
cial fan pages and sites dedicated to other singers and bands.

Part I: Jumping Into Google 

Searching with Similar Pages is a bit of a crapshoot — or perhaps I should say
it’s an adventure. Sometimes a pointless one. So when should you use Similar
Pages? It’s useful to get a sense of the network lurking around a Web page.
Part of what the engine does with Similar Pages is explore outgoing links from
the target page. On my site, for example, if I have a link to an article I wrote
on another site, Similar Pages for bradhill.com will list that other site. Last
time I checked, though, Similar Pages to my site also listed a Web page titled
Amish Tech Support. There’s no connection that I can see, though I respect
the Amish and some day would like to try plowing a field. So, whenever you
use Similar Pages, do so with an open mind.
Indented results
Some search results are offset from the main body of results with an indenta-
tion (look back to Figure 2-5). These indented sites are located in the same
domain as the target page above them. (In Figure 2-5 the domain is www.
domain.com.) They are indented to remind you that it might be redundant to
click both the target page and an indented site.
Google refrains from listing all pages in a single domain that match your key-
words. But you can see more results from that domain by clicking the More
results from www.domain.com link in any indented search result. Doing so is a
great way to perform a minisearch within any domain that has already proved
useful to you.
Searching in a large Web site (also called a domain) can be accomplished
another way: by using a special search operator called the site operator. This
operator tells Google to apply your keywords to a specified domain. You type
the site operator, the domain, and the keywords in a single glop of instruc-
tions. For example, if you want to search the New York Times for stories that
mention Condoleeza Rice, you could do so with a single entry:
site:www.nytimes.com condoleeza rice
You can reverse the order of the syntax by placing the keyword(s) before the
site operator and domain, without affecting the search results.
Using Advanced Search
Later in this chapter, I cover the use of special query terms (similar to the site
operator just described), general search operators that can be used with key-
words, and searching for specified types of documents. All these tricks and
more are consolidated on the Advanced Search page, which is shown in
Figure 2-7. To get to this page, click the Advanced Search link on the Google
home page.
35
Chapter 2: Reclaiming Your Time from Wasteful Searching

Use Advanced Search for any one of three reasons:
 You want to focus a search more narrowly than a general keyword
search.
 You don’t want to bother with the complexity and thorny syntax of
search operators.
 You want to combine more than one search operation.
As you see in Figure 2-7, the Advanced Search page bundles many keyword
boxes and drop-down menus to launch a finely targeted search. You don’t
have to use everything this page has to offer. In fact, you may conduct a
simple, one-keyword search from here, although that would be like using a
race car to buy groceries.
Following is a review of the Advanced Search features. After setting any com-
bination of these features, click the Google Search button to get your results.
Using multiple keywords
At the top of the Advanced Search page are a series of keyword boxes
grouped in a shaded area called Find results. (See Figure 2-7.) You use the
Figure 2-7:
Google’s

page.
36
Part I: Jumping Into Google 

four keyword boxes in this area to tell Google how to manage multiple key-
words. If you have just one keyword, type it in the top box. The instructions
next to each keyword box correspond to Boolean operators, which are typed
shorthand instructions covered later in this chapter. The Advanced Search
page gives you the laser exactness of Boolean searching without all the typing.
Use these keyword boxes in the following ways:
 With all of the words: Putting keywords here forces Google to scour
for pages that contain every word, with no exceptions. It has the effect
of narrowing search results. For example, if you type alan greenspan fed-
eral reserve, you won’t see irrelevant pages that contain only alan or
only federal.
 With the exact phrase: This is like using quotation marks in most
search engines and delivers pages that contain your keywords in the
exact order and with the exact spelling that you used. You might use this
option for people’s names (david hyde pierce), sport teams with their
cities (los angeles dodgers), and colloquial phrases (jump the shark).
 With at least one of the words: This option is useful when you’re less
picky about matching your words. It has the effect of widening search
results. For example, if you’re conducting broad research about building
string instruments, you might type violin cello viola in this box, with
instrument building in the top box.
 Without the words: Much confusion can be avoided with this keyword
box, which instructs Google to eliminate matches that contain certain
words. This command is useful when one of your keywords is often asso-
ciated with other words. It has the effect of narrowing search results and
making them more accurate. For example, if you’re looking for pages
about giants in fairy tales, you can stack words into this box that would
match with pages about certain sports teams, such as new york san fran-
cisco baseball football. You’d also need to place the giants keyword in the
top box and fairy tale in the exact phrase box.
Here’s something to keep in mind: Google’s general search results are so
useful that Boolean commands are usually unnecessary. It all depends on your
level of searching. If, during a general search, you find yourself looking beyond
the first page of results (given thirty or fewer results per page), the Advanced
Search keyword boxes might speed your searches along. Using the Advanced
page is also simply fun and helps focus the search goal in your mind.
You can see how your Find results entries translate into Boolean operators
by looking in the keyword box atop the search results page (and also in the
blue summary bar). In the preceding example about instrument building, the
Boolean search string comes out as
instrument building violin OR cello OR viola
37
Chapter 2: Reclaiming Your Time from Wasteful Searching

Examining the search string on the results page is one way to get the hang of
Boolean language on-the-fly. The appearance of the string also gives you a
chance to adjust it for a new search without returning to the Advanced
Search page.
Other Advanced Search features
The central portion of the Advanced Search page contains six settings
designed to narrow your results. They are
 Language: Similar to the Search Language setting on the Preferences
page (see the “Setting Preferences” section previously in this chapter),
this pull-down menu instructs Google to return search results only in the
specified language. The default setting is any language. Whereas the
Preferences page has check boxes, allowing you to select multiple target
languages, this menu limits your choice to a single language (or all lan-
guages). And whereas your settings on the Preferences page affect all
your Googling until you change them, the Advanced Search setting
affects just one search at a time.
 File Format: Google recognizes certain distinct file formats, such as
Microsoft Word documents (which end in the .doc extension) and
Adobe Acrobat (pdf) files. You can use the File Format setting to include
or exclude selected file formats. Use the drop-down menu to select Only
(to include your selected format) or Don’t (to exclude your selected
format). Then use the second pull-down menu to select the format. Feel
free to ignore this setting if you’re conducting a general Web search.
When Any Format is selected in the second drop-down menu, your
search results include all file types recognized by Google and will mostly
consist of Web pages. When you get a search result in non-Web format,
you can read it in its original form if you have the program associated
with the file type. Or, conveniently, you can view Google’s translation to
Web-page format (HTML).
 Date: Google’s index crawler can determine when a page was last
changed. A page update might be as trivial as changing one word, or it
might involve a massive content revision. The drop-down menu for this
feature doesn’t give you fine control over the update time — you may
select pages updated in the past three months, past six months, and
past year. That might seem useless, but one purpose of choosing three
months over the default setting (anytime) is to reduce the occurrence of
dead links (pages that no longer exist) in your search results.
 Occurrences: This powerful and useful setting whisks away question-
able search results and gives you control of how important your key-
words are to the matched page. The purpose is not to determine where
your keywords exist in the page’s text (that is, how near to the top of the
38
Part I: Jumping Into Google 

page they occur), nor is it to help you avoid scrolling the page. This 
feature culls pages in which your keywords appear in the page title, in
the page URL, or — amazingly — in the page’s incoming links. (Again,
Google’s capability to sense the network surrounding each page is
astounding and helpful.) Use the title or URL choice to powerfully
narrow the search results, returning high-probability matches.
 Domain: Like the Occurrences setting, you can use this feature to include
or exclude matches with certain properties. In this case, you’re allowing
or eliminating a certain domain, which is the portion of a site’s URL after
www. When typing the domain, you may type the www or leave it out.
So, for the New York Times domain, you could type www.nytimes.com or
nytimes.com. Use the first drop-down menu to choose Only (includes the
selected domain and no others) or Don’t (excludes the selected domain
and admits all others).
 SafeSearch: The default position of this setting turns off SafeSearch if
you have it turned on in your preferences. You can activate SafeSearch
on a per-search basis by using this feature of the Advanced Search page.
No matter what you do here, it doesn’t affect your preference setting for
Google searches launched from the home page.
Following are the two page-specific Advanced Search features:
 Similar: Identical to the Similar Pages link on the search results page,
this feature finds pages related to the URL you type in the keyword box.
 Links: This one is addictive and shows off Google’s extreme network
awareness. Type a URL here, and Google finds Web pages that contain
links to that page. The URL of your specified page is the keyword you
type in the box. Because most large sites link to their own home pages
from every other page, these searches yield a lot of tedious results from
within the domain. However, it’s fun to try with an inner page from a site.
Google provides the Advanced Image Search page for fancy picture search-
ing. I describe it later in this chapter, in the “A Picture Is Worth a Thousand
Keywords” section. The Advanced Search page just described relates to Web
searches, not image searches.
Note: Google started including a Froogle keyword box on the Advanced Search
page in 2004, after moving the Froogle link to the home page as one of Google’s
primary engines. Froogle is a product-based shopping engine. You may cer-
tainly start a Froogle search from here, but there is little reason to, save in
those moments when you suddenly must find the cheapest Razor scooter in
the midst of a search for articles about Condoleeza Rice in the New York Times.
Chapter 4 is all about Froogle.
39
Chapter 2: Reclaiming Your Time from Wasteful Searching

Searching Shorthand: Using Operators
There’s no need to detour to the Advanced Search page if you know about
keyword modifiers called search operators. Standard search operators are
not unique to Google; most search engines understand them and require the
same symbols and syntax when typing them. Search operators are typed with
the keywords right in the keyword box. You do have to type neatly and make
sure you don’t add spaces in the wrong places or use the wrong case (small
letters instead of capital letters).
Standard search operators fulfill the same functions as the Find results por-
tion of the Advanced Search page. (These operators are known as Boolean
operators, or Boolean commands. Dr. Mellifluous Boolean was a 17th-century
explorer who discovered the island of Quiqui, brought lemons back to the
Old World, and prophesied the Internet. None of which is true.) You don’t
need to learn search operators to get advanced results. But they’re not hard
to master, and doing so saves you the trip to Advanced Search and the
bother of finagling with all those keyword boxes. Using operators, you can
quickly type an advanced search query in the simple keyword box on
Google’s home page (or in the Google Toolbar or Google Deskbar, both
described in Chapter 12).
Google understands standard search operators that have been in common
use for years, but it also provides special commands for Google only. These
unique keyword modifiers take advantage of Google’s extraordinary index
and bring to life Google’s under-the-hood power. The next section covers
standard Boolean commands. The section after that details the unique
Google operators.
Typing standard search operators
If you’re familiar with Boolean search operators and use them in Google or
other search engines, feel free to skip this section. (Like you need my permis-
sion. By the way, be home by 11:30 tonight.) The four major Boolean opera-
tors work in Google’s keyword boxes as follows:
 AND: The AND operator forces Google to match the search results
against all your keywords. The operator is signified by a plus sign (+).
The effect is to narrow search results, giving you fewer and more accu-
rate hits. Place the plus sign immediately before any word(s) you want to
force into the match, without a space between the symbol and the word,
for example: dog +chew +toy +slobber. Keep in mind that Google naturally
attempts to match all keywords without being commanded to. It always
lists complete matches first, followed by Web pages that match fewer
keywords. So the AND operator is well used with long keyword strings to
force a single-word match even when other words in the string are not
40
Part I: Jumping Into Google 

matched. An example of the latter is recipe cookbook ingredients +vege-
tarian. In this example, vegetarian is the main focus, and every matched
page must contain that word. Whether it’s a page about recipes or cook-
books or ingredients is less important.
 NOT: The NOT operator excludes words that might otherwise bring up
many undesirable page matches. The effect is to narrow search results.
The symbol is a minus sign (-). Like the AND operator, place the symbol
immediately before a word. In using it, you should think of anti-keywords
that would thwart the mission of your pro-keywords. For example, you
might type kayak lake -canoe -whitewater. (Nothing against canoes, but if
you haven’t tried kayaking, what on earth are you waiting for?)
 OR: Not as wishy-washy as you might think, the OR operator is helpful
when using obscure keywords that might not return much of value if
used singly. It also neatly divides a search along two concurrent avenues
of exploration. There is no symbol for this one; simply type OR (use cap-
ital letters) before a keyword and leave a space between the operator
and the following keyword. Google then accepts matches to the keyword
preceding the operator or following the operator, such as wintry climate
maine OR antarctica.
 Quotes: Identical to the Exact phrase feature of the Advanced Search
page, the quote operator tells Google which keyword sequence or key-
word phrase to leave untouched. Google can’t assume you have mis-
spelled something, and it can’t change the word order to create a match.
Whatever you type within the quotes is interpreted and matched liter-
ally by Google. The quote operator is best used with keyword groups in
which each word could return its own set of irrelevant results, for exam-
ple: “old town” canoes prices.
If you forget to close the quotation at the end of the quotes-applied keywords,
Google will extend the quote operator to the end of your keyword string, pos-
sibly reducing your matches to zero.
One operator that stands between basic and special functionality is the syn-
onym operator, which is activated by typing a tilde (~). Placing a tilde imme-
diately before a keyword (no space) commands Google to match not only the
keyword, but its synonyms. So this keyword string:
~auto ~purchase
would match Web sites as if you had typed, for example, auto buy or car 
purchase.
Mix up search operators as much as you like. Here are a few examples:
television –cable –satellite “rural living”
“brad hill” +dummies –idiots
chocolate +dark OR bittersweet
stepdaughter +delinquent OR evil “why me”
41
Chapter 2: Reclaiming Your Time from Wasteful Searching

Understanding special Google operators
Now this is fun. Google has invented its own search operators that work in
the Google index. They enable fancy search tricks, some of which are also
represented on the Advanced Search page. Knowing these operators takes a
bit of memorization, and using them gives you power over the Google home
page, circumventing Advanced Search.
Google-specific operators use a colon to separate the command from the key-
word string. The format is like this:
operator:keyword string
Some Google operators require that you leave no space between the colon and
the first keyword, as in the preceding. It doesn’t matter with other operators.
Because I don’t want to remember which is which, I always crush the first key-
word up against the operator’s colon (this sounds like a medical condition).
You may use Boolean operators in the keyword string when the string is pre-
ceded by a Google operator, like this:
allintitle:new times –york
There are several Google-specific operators:
 cache: If you know the Web page address, use this operator to pull up
Google’s cache of that page. By itself, not too useful. But the cache oper-
ator has an intriguing hidden feature. If you type a keyword after the
page URL, Google highlights that word throughout the cached document
that it displays. For example, try cache:www.lycos.com music.
 link: This operator performs the same function as the Links feature on
the Advanced Search page, finding pages that contain a link to whatever
URL you specify. For example, link:www.dummies.com displays sites that
contain a link to www.dummies.com. If you operate a site, running a
search with this operator lets you check who is linking to your site — a
great tool if you operate a Blogger site.
 info: An operator that consolidates informational links about a site, info
is paired with a URL keyword. The result is the Google index entry for
that page, plus links to view the cached page, similar sites, and pages
that link to that URL. For information about the Google home page, for
example, type info:www.google.com.
 filetype: Google can search for twelve types of document besides HTML
documents that make up Web pages. One of the most common file types
people want to find is PDF, a format that you can read with Adobe
Acrobat Reader. Many official forms and academic papers are created in
42
Part I: Jumping Into Google 

the PDF format. Finding tax forms using the filetype pdf operator com-
mand is a breeze when that command is part of a keyword string that
also contains the form name or number. Other commonly searched file
types are text (txt), Microsoft PowerPoint (ppt), Microsoft Excel (xls),
and Microsoft Word (doc). Google can’t find MP3 or video files with this
operator.
 related: Use this operator in place of the Similar Pages link. The related
operator is paired with a site URL. A keyword string including this opera-
tor might look like this: related:www.cdbaby.com.
 site: Use this operator in your keyword string to limit results to a speci-
fied domain. It’s a good way to search online newspapers, such as alan
greenspan site:www.usatoday.com. Combined with the quote operator,
you can get pretty specific results in a newspaper site, for example, “axis
of evil” site:www.nytimes.com. This operator even works with domain
extensions, such as .gov and .edu, without using a domain. Knowing this,
you can search for keywords matching university or government pages,
such as “code orange” site:gov.
 intitle and allintitle: These operators restrict your results to pages in
which one or more of your keywords appear in the page title. The intitle
command affects the single keyword (or group of keywords in quotes)
immediately following the operator. All other keywords following the
first might be found anywhere on the page. For example, intitle:tiger
woods golf assures that result pages are about Tiger Woods, not Bengal
tigers. The allintitle command forces Google to match all your keywords
with page titles. This operator can severely narrow a search. For exam-
ple, the last time I checked, the allintitle:carrot top nobel prize search
string returned no results. On the other hand, it’s great for homing in on
useful pages, as when searching for product reviews (see Figure 2-8).
 intext and allintext: Using these operators, Google restricts the search
to the text of pages, excluding the URL, title, and links. Use the intext
operator mainly for single keywords: intext:labradors. Use allintext for
keyword strings: allintext:labrador retrievers. Had the intext operator
been used in the second example, Google would have matched only the
keyword labrador to the text of found pages.
 inanchor and allinanchor: Restricting a search to link anchors is a
potent search technique. Link anchors are the visible portions of hyper-
links that you see on Web pages. If a link appears as Click this link, the
phrase “Click this link” is the anchor. You can restrict your search to the
link anchors of pages. Fascinatingly, this puts your results one step back
from normal keyword matches. Instead of matching pages that are rich
with your keywords, you are likely to match pages that explicitly link to
keyword-rich pages. Use inanchor with single keywords and allinanchor
with multiple keywords when you want each keyword in the string to
match link anchors.
43
Chapter 2: Reclaiming Your Time from Wasteful Searching

 inurl and allinurl: These function similarly to intitle and allintitle but
restrict search results to pages that contain one or more of your keywords
in the page’s URL. The result is a drastic narrowing of search results, but
it’s an interesting way to discover new sites with great domain names.
For example, inurl:diaper returns www.dog-diaper.com as the first result.
Another example is allinurl:purple elephant, which displays results, believe
it or not. Note that using allinurl with two or more keywords is likely to
match pages deep within Web sites with very long URLs.
Power Googling is all about knowing the operators and skipping the
Advanced Search page. The more authority over the Google index you can
wield on the home page, with its simple keyword box, the quicker you’ll be
on your way with great search results.
A Picture Is Worth a Thousand Keywords
Image searching in Google is less complex than Web searching and is fun
in different ways. For example, you can search for pictures of people you
haven’t seen in years, for postcard-like images of travel destinations, or for
pictures of yourself.

Part I: Jumping Into Google 

Google’s task is a tricky one. It must match your keyword(s) with pictures —
a far harder task than matching words with text. At best, Google can make
educated guesses about the identity or subject matter of a picture based on
the file name of the picture, the URL address of the image, the surrounding
text, and any caption. So the results are bound to be erratic. Fortunately,
Google errs on the side of abundance, delivering truckloads of possible
photos and other images in response to your keywords.
Simple searches are identical to Web searches. From the Google home page,
click the Images tab, enter a keyword or two, and press Enter. You can even
use the site, intitle, allintitle, inurl, and allinurl operators described in the pre-
ceding section when searching for images.
It’s in the search results that things differ from Web searches. Image results
come in the form of thumbnails — small versions of images. Click any thumb-
nail to see a larger version of the image, along with the Web page on which it
resides. Google reproduces the image above the Web page containing the
image — arguably a big waste of space. (Click the Remove Frame link at the
top right of the page to get rid of it.) This second reproduction of the image is
usually a thumbnail, too, albeit a somewhat larger one. You may click this
thumbnail to see a full-size version of the picture. Or you can scroll down the
page to see the picture in context.
In November 2004, some enterprising Google users began making noise about
not being able to find images of the Iraq war in Google Images. They made
enough noise to prompt a confession from Sergey Brin, one of Google’s
founders. “We are embarrassed that our image index is not updated as fre-
quently as it should be,” Sergey stated. “Expect a refresh in the near future.”
Indeed, the update came along, but the currency of Google Images was dam-
aged. On the day I wrote this paragraph, Google Images failed to display a pic-
ture of the iPod Shuffle, a wildly popular MP3 player introduced two months
earlier. If you can’t find a current events photo in Google Images, try perform-
ing a photo search in the Google Web index, which turns up photos when
asked for them. Use the word photos in your keyword string. This trick some-
times works, but not always — indeed, it failed to show the Shuffle.
Advanced Image Searching
As with Web searches, Google provides a collection of enhanced search tools
on the Advanced Image Search page (see Figure 2-9). Follow these steps to
reach that page:
1. Go to the Google home page.
2. Click the Images tab.
3. Click the Advanced Image Search link.
45
Chapter 2: Reclaiming Your Time from Wasteful Searching

The Find results portion of the Advanced Image Search page is nearly identi-
cal to the Advanced Search page for Web searches. (See the “Using Advanced
Search” section earlier in this chapter.) The difference is that the keyword
modifiers here relate to images by matching file names, captions, and text
surrounding the images. Use the keyword boxes to add search modifiers to
your keywords, but don’t expect exact textual matches as with a Web search
because images are not text.
Below the Find results portion of the Advanced Image Search page are five
settings that determine the type and location of the images you are seeking:
 Size: Use the drop-down menu to restrict your search to images of cer-
tain sizes. Admittedly, the choices are vague: icon-sized, small, medium,
large, very large, and wallpaper-sized. By themselves, these choices are
nearly meaningless. They refer generally to image dimensions, not file
size. A wallpaper-sized picture can be contained in a smaller file size
than a medium picture.
 Filetypes: Use this drop-down menu to select JPG, GIF, or PNG files. As a
practical matter, these file formats are nearly interchangeable. Whatever
you plan to do with your found images, you can probably do equally well
with any one of those three types. Accordingly, I always leave this fea-
ture set to its default, which is any filetype.
Figure 2-9:

46
Part I: Jumping Into Google 

 Coloration: Here you can choose to locate black-and-white pictures,
grayscale images, or full-color art. Full-color images are usually the
largest file sizes.
 Domain: Use this keyword box to specify a Web domain that you want
to search for images. This is a helpful way to search online newspaper
graphics.
 SafeSearch: With the three SafeSearch options, you can determine the
level of filtering Google will apply to your image search. The choices are
identical to the SafeSearch preference settings (see the first section of
this chapter), but apply to only one search at a time.
In nearly all cases, the images you find through Google are owned and implic-
itly copyrighted by other people. There is some buzz among copyright schol-
ars about the capability of search engines to display other people’s property
on demand. Google itself puts a little copyright warning about using the
images dished up in its search results. If you’re wondering whether you can
download and apply a photo as desktop wallpaper, for example, the quick
legal answer is no in most cases. The search results are meant to be informa-
tional, and Google is not intended as a warehouse of downloadable images.
How you choose to approach online intellectual property is your business,
but respect for the property of others strengthens the online community.
Besides, in Google of all places, it’s not too hard to find images whose owners
invite downloads. Try using the keywords public domain or free download on
the Advanced Image Search page to find images that you can legally reuse.
You may use search operators in Google Images, just as you do in Google
Web searches. Some Web search operators, such as intext and info, don’t
apply to images. The best image operators to use are
 intitle: Find photos in Web pages that contain certain keywords in the
page titles.
 filetype: Use this operator to find certain image file types, specifically
JPG, GIF, and PNG. (Most people find no practical value in discriminating
between these file types.)
 inurl: Find images in Web pages whose URLs contain your keywords.
 site: Restrict your image search to certain site domains or specific pages.
These operators help narrow a search but do not eliminate the fundamental
problem, which is that most photos posted online are not named in a way
that allows Google to easily identify them or match them with intelligent key-
words. Constant experimentation and persistence are required.

nrecognized power. That’s what this chapter is about, because most
people I talk to have no idea that Google is so smart in so many ways.
Some of the features highlighted in this chapter have been talked up since
the publication of Google For Dummies, and you might be aware of them. But
others, like instant stock quotes and the valuable Google Q&A, have been
introduced recently. I think this chapter holds something new for every
reader.
Most of the features in this chapter demonstrate Google’s ability to deliver
factual information directly to the results page, rather than forcing you to
click through to another page. A few features still require clicking through to
another site, but are useful nonetheless. Every feature represents Google’s
attempt, when faced with a factual question that would normally be answered
by a reference source, to behave more like an answer engine than a Web
search engine.

Search Engines and Answer Engines
Google is a search engine. You know that. But there exists another species of
keyword searching called an answer engine. Answer engines differ from
search engines by displaying direct answers to queries, as opposed to lists of
Web sites. When using a search engine, your hope is that you’ll find some
useful pieces of Internet content. You might be seeking information or enter-
tainment, knowledge or communication. Web sites offer many experiences,
and search engines such as Google specialize in cataloguing Web sites.
Answer engines sometimes acknowledge the Web by presenting links to 
other sites in search results, but those links and other sites are not the main
course. Answers are the main course, taken either from Web sites or from 
reference sources. Either way, the distinguishing characteristic of answer
engines is that you don’t click search results to get what you want; the infor-
mation you’re after is given to you directly.
One simple example of an answer engine’s function is a word definition. If you
look up a word in a dictionary, you don’t want the book to direct you to
another book — you just want the word’s spelling and meaning. By the same
token, you don’t want a search engine pointing you to another site for a
simple answer. Google used to link its users to another site for simple word
definitions; now it defines the word directly. That’s an example of Google
taking on the characteristics of an answer engine.
It has become competitively important for search engines to provide quicker
answers to reference queries of many sorts. The following sections describe
several (sometimes surprising) ways that you can hit Google with a fast
query and move on with the answer in hand, without unnecessary linkage.
What, Where, When, and How in Google
After introducing a variegated selection of fact-based services, Google
launched a highly informed, nicely integrated answer service called Google
Q&A in April 2005. Don’t confuse Google Q&A with Google Answers, the paid
answer service described in Chapter 10. Google Q&A is an automated service
that you access directly from Google’s home page (or from the Google
Toolbar or Deskbar); Google Answers is staffed by human researchers and is
located on its own pages. Google Q&A is not a well-defined service; it works
to one degree or another depending on the wording of your query. Basically,
if you ask a question in the right way, Google delivers an answer above the
regular search results. Figure 3-1 shows Google Q&A in action.
52
Part II: Taming Google 

Note that you do not need to put a question mark in your keyword string to
denote a fact-based query. Pretend you’re a zombie asking the question with
no inflection whatsoever. A zombie with a thirst for knowledge.
If at first Google does not succeed, keep pestering it. In the example shown in
Figure 3-1, the query is who is van cliburn, referring to the legendary
American pianist who achieved stardom by winning the Tchaikovsky
Competition in Moscow in 1958. Alternate queries, including when did van
cliburn get famous and when did van cliburn win the tchaikovsky competition,
got me nowhere. With a little bit of knowledge, you can get better instant
information with a non-questioning keyword string. Figure 3-2 shows the Web
results for van cliburn moscow. If you know that Van Cliburn did something
important in Moscow, the first search result in Figure 3-2 gives you more
information than the who is van cliburn query.

Chapter 3: Recovering the Facts: Using Google as an Answer Engine

Preceding all your Google Q&A questions with questioning words such as
what, where, or who helps Google understand that you’re asking a question. 
A question mark is not necessary. In some cases (try population of japan),
questioning words are also not necessary. But they never hurt and often help.

Leaning on Wikipedia
Where do Google’s answers come from? From
a range of reference sources, not least of which
is Wikipedia. In fact, if you use Google Q&A sev-
eral times, it becomes apparent that Wikipedia
enjoys prominence in the answers. (As Figure
3-1 illustrates, the answer source is cited imme-
diately below the answer. Click that link to see a
complete entry from which Google extracted
the answer.) Wikipedia is a remarkable online
encyclopedia written and edited by its readers.
Anyone can post an entry, add to an entry, or
edit an entry. With everybody chipping in and 
no formal editorial control, you might wonder
how authoritative Wikipedia is as a reference
source. The truth is that it’s pretty good, thanks
to dedicated work by some enthusiastic volun-
teers. Certainly good enough for basic Q&A.
Answers.com, a more traditional collection of
reference sources, and a partner site to which
Google turns for word definitions (described
later in this chapter), is not used for Google Q&A
answers as of this writing.

Knowing Your Words
The most elemental type of reference question involves word definitions.
Google provides three methods of finding out what words mean:
 Using the define operator
 Using the glossary keyword in a keyword string
 Using the definition links that appear on nearly every search results
page
The define operator is fast and useful. Its presence before a keyword forces
Google to reach into its glossary (which is not really a built-in glossary, but
don’t worry about that) and pull out relevant definitions. Figure 3-3 shows
Google responding to the keyword string define:blade server, a type of com-
puter. Note that multiple definitions are presented when available. Often the
competing definitions give a rounded understanding of the word without
clicking through any of them. Note, also, the presence of Wikipedia as a
source (see the “Leaning on Wikipedia” sidebar).
Figure 3-3:
Using the
define
operator
brings up

from
multiple
sources.
55
Chapter 3: Recovering the Facts: Using Google as an Answer Engine

The define operator generally works best with words and phrases that have
specific meanings, but you can get lucky using it with search phrases. For
example, the keyword string define:labrador dog works well, as does define:
labrador retriever. You can also use the operator to flesh out your knowledge
of something — for example, if you’re familiar with memory cards but don’t
know the names of available types, search this: define:memory card. More
than a dozen definitions spill the beans on Compact Flash, SmartMedia, and
other types.
Using glossary as a keyword brings up useful results, but of a different type.
The word isn’t a search operator, and you’re not using it with operator syntax
(the colon following the word and preceding other words). So, the results are
links to Web pages that probably contain explanations of your words. Using
the memory card example in the preceding paragraph, try this keyword
string: glossary memory card. Figure 3-4 illustrates the results, which link to
Web-based definitions. This method of discovering word meanings is not as
concise as using the define operator and often requires clicking through to an
outside page. The upside is that you might get a deeper discussion or exami-
nation of your words.
Figure 3-4:
Adding 
the word
glossary to

56
Part II: Taming Google 

The final method of defining words is to rely on the definition links that
appear in the summary bar of most search results pages. Look at Figure 3-4,
in the shaded area just above the results, on the right. Each word — glossary,
memory, and card — is linked. Those links take you to Answers.com, a great
reference and word-definition site. The fact that each word is individually
linked demonstrates the downfall of relying on this method. Google is provid-
ing the opportunity to define each of those words, including glossary, which,
of course, was used merely to bring up Web sites with definitions. And
memory card is treated not as a phrase but as two unrelated words. (Even if
you had used the phrase operator, putting memory card in quotes, Google
would have ripped the words away from each other and linked them 
individually.)
Because Google’s link to Answers.com doesn’t recognize the meaning of
phrases, the Answers.com links are best used with individual keywords, after
the act of searching when you want clarification of a keyword’s meaning.
Let’s go back to the blade server keyphrase. Search on this string: glossary
blade server. Figure 3-5 shows the results. At this point, perhaps you realize
that you need to enhance your understanding of the term server to fully
appreciate definitions of blade server. Click the linked word server in the 
summary bar. Figure 3-6 shows the Answers.com page that comes up — the
fifth definition is the one you need.

Invading People’s Privacy
This should be fun. Two of Google’s great and long-standing features are its
phone book and reverse phone book. And they are drastically underused;
even people who turn to Google ten times a day don’t know they exist. 
(The features, not the people.)
If you type a person’s name and address into the keyword box, Google will
divulge the phone number — listed numbers only. You don’t even need to
know the entire address. Or the entire name. Last name and zip code do the
trick. So do other combinations, including:
 First and last names, plus city or state or area code or zip code
 Last name, plus city and state or area code or zip code
Note that if you don’t know the first name, you need the city and state, not
either by itself. You should also know that Google understands names in
order, but wimps out if you put the last name first.
Figure 3-6:
Answers.
com is an
excellent
reference
site used by
Google to
define
keywords.
58
Part II: Taming Google 

Now for the good part. Google reverses the process, delivering a name and
address if you can dredge up the phone number. The area code is required.
Don’t put any prefixes (such as 1) before it, and don’t type parentheses
around the area code, and don’t worry about putting in spaces. Just type ten
straight digits.
Google is at least one year behind in phone listings. There’s no gentle way to
say it. The feature is useless for new numbers.
Forget about names and phone numbers; try typing an address. Google recog-
nizes addresses even when they’re incomplete, and offers to link you to a
map. (With egalitarian spirit, Google offers a choice of its own mapping serv-
ice and two others.) Zip codes by themselves trip the map invitation, as do
street names without numbers (followed by city and state or zip code). Even
telephone area codes work by themselves. In some cases, an address brings
up phone book results, especially of businesses whose names contain a
street name, such as East Street Bistro. Figure 3-7 shows an example of this
dual result: map and phone book results.

Chapter 3: Recovering the Facts: Using Google as an Answer Engine

Tracking Packages
Many online retailers allow their customers to track the delivery of packages,
either by providing a tracking service at the e-commerce site or by linking
them to UPS, FedEx, or the U.S. Post Office site. Google simplifies these multi-
ple destinations by providing a single location for putting in numbers related
to all three delivery services. Google doesn’t display the tracking information
on its own pages; it merely provides a link to the appropriate service when
you enter a tracking number.
Of course, you must have a tracking number for Google’s feature to work.
When supplied by an e-tailer, the number is usually on an order confirmation
page or in an e-mail sent by the online store. You can also track outgoing pack-
ages that you’ve sent; the tracking number is found on the receipt you get after
dropping off the package. Simply type the number into Google’s keyword box.
Google at the Movies
Google’s involvement with movie information started recently. You can get
movie information in a standard Google search in three ways:
 Display movie times for theaters in your location
 Display information about a particular movie
 Use the movie operator to find movie-related information about your
keywords
The simplest movie search you can perform is to type movie as a keyword.
Google prompts you for a location by zip code. After you enter the zip,
Google displays movie showtimes by film or theater — the latter usually
being the more useful (see Figure 3-8).
Typing a movie title likewise cues Google to deliver movie-specific informa-
tion, in the form of movie times for that title in the zip code you typed before.
(If you didn’t yet enter your zip, Google asks for it.)
The movie operator is the most productive path into the Google movie index.
You can be fairly imprecise with your keywords and get good results. For
example, at the time of this writing, Woody Allen’s latest movie (Melinda and
Melinda) was playing, and I wanted to read reviews but couldn’t remember the
title. Was it Melissa and Melissa? That didn’t turn up anything useful. The key-
word string movie:woody allen’s latest delivered the page shown in Figure 3-9,
which is representative of the type of result obtained with the movie operator.
Click the movie title and you get something like Figure 3-10, which is a handy
resource. Google sorts reviews into positives, negatives, and neutrals, and
links to actors associated with the movie.

Stock Quotes, Math, and the Weather
Google has always dabbled in stock quotes, but until recently it merely linked
to finance sites when you entered a ticker symbol as a keyword. It’s a bit of a
mystery why Google didn’t deliver the information directly sooner, but no
matter — Google eventually came around. Now you can see stock quotes and
simple price charts atop the Google results page, as shown in Figure 3-11.
The Google calculator is another widely unrecognized feature. Using your
keyboard to type numbers and arithmetical operators, you can perform alge-
braic, trigonometric, and logarithmic equations. I can hardly believe I just
used the words algebraic, trigonometric, and logarithmic in a sentence. I must
lie down for a bit, but before I go, make note of this page:
www.google.com/help/calculator.html
Figure 3-10:
Google sorts
a wide
range of

62
Part II: Taming Google 

That page gives complete instructions in using the Google Calculator. Some
operations are simple enough to be intuitive, such as 2+2, typed directly into
the keyword box. (You never need to type an equal sign; Google knows you
want the answer.) Other operations are more complicated, and if I attempt an
explanation I’ll have to nap for the rest of the week.
Handily, Google Calculator performs conversions from one measurement
system to another. For example, the keyword string 5 feet in centimeters
yields the result in centimeters. The word in informs Google that you’re
asking for a conversion.
One final Google informational perk: the weather. Use the weather oper-
ator paired with a zip code to get a four-day forecast, as shown in Fig-
ure 3-12.

In This Chapter
 Introducing the Google shopping portal
 Searching and browsing in Froogle
 Special Froogle search operators
 Advanced searching in Froogle
 Introducing the dazzling Google Catalogs
 Browsing mail-order catalogs with the Google Catalogs control bar
G
oogle, the world’s most intelligent search engine, has an academic,
ivory-tower sheen. The science behind its index and the insightfulness
of its results lend Google an otherworldly feeling. Except . . . shopping! Shop-
ping is a common denominator of the Web — everybody likes to buy stuff.
Google turns its all-seeing eye to the swarming, steamy jungle of e-commerce.
Yes, Google is a shopping portal, but not of the sort you might be familiar
with in AOL and Yahoo!. Google provides two shopping directories and
applies its insightful, destination-ranking intelligence to them. The result is a
sharp, objective, results-oriented, virtual window-shopping experience.
This chapter covers the details of Froogle, a keyword-empowered shopping
directory, and Google Catalogs, an online mail-order browsing environment.
Both are delightful — and more powerful than many people realize. The fol-
lowing sections cover basic keywords and clicks, and then introduce a few
tricks I use in Froogle and Google Catalogs.
Neither Froogle nor Google Catalogs is a new service; earlier versions of both
were covered in Google For Dummies, which was published when most people
had not heard of either one. Froogle has become much more recognized and
used since Google moved its link to the home page. Most people I speak to
are still unaware of Google Catalogs.

Froogle and Google Catalogs are still in beta, meaning they are still being
tested by Google and its users. There’s no danger here, because nothing new
gets installed in your computer. If you have specific suggestions, complaints,
or words of adulation about Froogle or Google Catalogs, voice them by using
these two e-mail addresses:
 For Froogle: froogle-support@google.com
 For Google Catalogs: catalog-support@google.com
Google’s Approach to Online Shopping
The main difference between Google’s shopping services and those in other
major portals is that Google doesn’t get its hands on the money. You don’t
buy anything through Google. Both Froogle and Google Catalogs function
purely as directories to products, sending you elsewhere to buy the goods.
Google has no revenue-sharing association with e-commerce retailers (in
Froogle) or mail-order companies (in Google Catalogs). The search results
you get in both services are pure; Google does not sell preferred placement in
the search results lists.
The inevitable comparison is between Froogle and Yahoo! Shopping. (Google
Catalogs is unique and can’t be compared to anything else online.) Yahoo!
Shopping is a virtual mall whose directory and search results list Yahoo!’s
stores and non-Yahoo! stores. Banners for featured stores hog a portion of
the front page. Yahoo! hosts many of the most important online retailers in
the business. Yahoo!’s search engine shows off some smarts, breaking down
many searches into brand listings. It also has a nice price-comparison engine.
Keeping a multitude of stores under one virtual roof has other advantages,
first among them being a shared shopping cart and payment wallet. You can
load up products from multiple stores, and then pay for them all at once. You
provide your credit card and shipping information just once; the information
is then stored on Yahoo!’s computer. AOL and MSN have similar programs.
Systems like this are purchase oriented, whereas Google is search oriented.
Google is not (currently) interested in handling purchase transactions, taking
payment information, or hosting stores. There is no “Google Wallet.”
When it comes to buying through Google, through is the right word (as opposed
to from). Froogle search results are like Web search results, insofar as they
link you to target sites, in this case e-commerce sites with their own shopping
carts and payment systems. Google Catalogs provides mail-order phone num-
bers and — where possible — links to Web sites.

Searching and Browsing in Froogle
Your Froogle experience starts on the Froogle home page:
froogle.google.com
Before Google moved Froogle to the home page on Google’s American site,
Froogle displayed a directory-style browsing interface. Things have changed —
I suppose because Google discovered that people were searching with key-
words more than browsing directory categories. It’s worth noting that Google
has removed the Web directory link from its home page. Certainly, in Froogle,
it is easier to cut to the chase, querying directly for the type of product you
seek, than to drill slowly through directory levels.
As you can see in Figure 4-1, Froogle now presents a bare search engine, 
with a constantly changing array of recent Froogle searches, presumably for
inspiration.
Figure 4-1:
The Froogle
home page.
67
Chapter 4: Froogle and Google Catalogs Rescue Your Gift List

Actually, a Froogle directory still exists, and you can dive into it from the
Search within portion of the left navigation bar on search result pages. That
explanation is a bit opaque, so let me step through finding the Froogle direc-
tory using a sample search for the keywords tennis rackets:
1. Go to Froogle and search for tennis rackets.
2. On the results page (see Figure 4-2), look for the Search within header
in the left sidebar.
Three directory categories are listed: All Categories, which is the level of
your current search (Froogle’s entirety); Sports & Outdoors; and Tennis
& Racquet Sports.
3. Click the Sports & Outdoors category.
Clicking the category performs another search of Froogle, this time
restricted to that category. The results might not change much, since
Froogle is good at delivering properly categorized results from the 
home page. (You could also have clicked the Tennis & Racquet Sports
category; either will get you to the next step.) Remember: If you conduct
a new search with new keywords from this page, you remain in the
Figure 4-2:
A Froogle
results
page. Note
the many
sorting
options in
the left
sidebar.
68
Part II: Taming Google 

Sports & Outdoors category. Shifting gears with non-sports keywords on
this page would lead to interesting and baffling results.
4. On the Sports & Categories page, click the Browse Sports & Outdoors
link.
This click brings up a directory page, as shown in Figure 4-3.
Once in the directory at any level, you can stay in the directory and surface
to the top level by clicking the Browse All Categories link. There, you see an
overview of the whole Froogle product universe.
After you get into the directory, your search options change. From the home
page, your search encompasses all of Froogle. On any directory page, you
may opt to limit your search to the subcategory at hand. The options below
the keyword box (see Figure 4-3) default to limiting the search, but you can
search all of Froogle by clicking the other radio button.
In Froogle, a keyword search is by and large more rewarding than directory
browsing. Presumably, when shopping, you have an idea of what you’re look-
ing for, and using a keyword gets you to that product page faster than push-
ing down into the directory.

Chapter 4: Froogle and Google Catalogs Rescue Your Gift List

Search results in Froogle
Whether through browsing or keyword searching, you eventually reach a
Froogle product page (refer to Figure 4-2). The product page is where you see
individual items for sale. They are for sale only through their host sites — not
through Google.
The product page contains several main features:
 Keyword box: You may launch a new search from any Froogle directory
or product page.
 Results summary: This familiar feature tells you how long the search
took and how items were found. Most searches reveal two result totals:
confirmed results and total results. Confirmed results represent those
products submitted by merchants, not found by Froogle during its Web
crawl. Total results include everything — submitted and found results.
Confirmed results are more valuable because of their near-guaranteed
accuracy, so Froogle always presents them first.
 View: You may display the results in a list or a grid. Figure 4-2 shows the
grid display, which I prefer because it shows more results on the screen.
These controls are on the left side of the page.
 Sort by: The default setting here is Best match, which brings up results
that most closely match your keywords, regardless of price. Use the
other links to order the results by price: low to high or high to low.
 Price range: This is useful, especially when gift shopping with a budget
in mind. Specify a price range and click the Go button.
 Search within: This feature invites you to enter new keywords that
search within the current results.
 Search by store: Results pages list the top stores selling the products
matching your keywords. Click a store to see all matching items sold by
that store.
 Product name and photo: In the main portion of the page, the product
name is the main link to its page in the host store. You may also get
there by clicking the photo.
 Product price and store name: Here you find the basic stats: price,
store name, and short product description.
 Sponsored links: In the right sidebar, text ads related to your keywords
are displayed. These ads are of the same type as on the results pages of
Web searches. In Froogle, the ads tend to be exceptionally relevant and
useful; you can sometimes get better search results by clicking a Froogle
ad than you can from nonsponsored Froogle results.

Price comparisons in Froogle
Froogle can become a handy price-comparison
search engine if you know the brand and model
number of the item you’re shopping for. Even if
you don’t know that information going in,
Froogle can help you compare prices of any
product you find while searching. Here’s how 
it works:
1. On the Froogle home page, start a search
for some type of product.
To follow along with the example, search for
digital camera.
2. On the search results page, identify a prod-
uct you’re interested in.
Suppose the product is the CANON
Powershot A95. (This is not an endorsement
of the CANON Powershot A95. That camera
showed up first on a recent results page. Of
course, if CANON were to send me an A95
in consideration of this publicity, it would be
rude of me decline it.)
3. In the search box, type the product brand
and model number.
To follow along with the example, type
canon powershot a95.
4. Press Enter or click the Search Froogle
button to launch your search and view the
results, as shown in the figure.
The search results list contained 393 hits on that
product name. Scanning down the list gives you
a good idea of the range of retail prices. You can
further hone the results by identifying a small
price range in the Price Range fields.

Froogle notices and obeys your general Google settings on the Preferences
page (see Chapter 2). If you’ve set Google to display the maximum one hun-
dred listings per results page, Froogle will do so too. Also, if you follow my
recommendation and set Google to open a new browser window for the
target page, Froogle will do so when displaying an online store that carries
the product you clicked. This keeps you anchored at Froogle while you shop
around in the target site.
This issue of loading one hundred listings per page could be a problem for
telephone modem users because Froogle results pages display thumbnail pic-
tures next to nearly every product. A one-hundred-item page is likely to con-
tain ninety to one hundred pictures, slowing down the page load considerably.
Adjusting your preferences just to use Froogle might not be worthwhile. My
advice is to press the Esc key on your keyboard (which stops the page load
in most browsers) when you get impatient with a page-loading delay. In most
cases, you will have loaded all the listings but only some of the accompanying
pictures. You can always click the Reload button (Ctrl+R in most browsers) if
you decide you need the entire page with pictures.
The downfall of sorting results from low price to high price is that you’re likely
to get accessories to the product you want, not the product itself. This phenom-
enon occurs often when searching for moderately expensive stuff, such as
iPods or digital cameras. Sort those search result pages by price, and the low
end is likely to be glutted with earphones or camera cases. In this case, use
the Price Range feature to determine a low price that is above the price of the
accessories. (You don’t need to fill in the upper portion of the price range.)
Any Sponsored Links that appear above or to the right of your search results
are not part of Froogle’s objective search. They are ads purchased by online
retailers and information sites and keyed to appear on certain search results
pages. However, that’s not to say you should necessarily ignore them.
Froogle search operators
Froogle adds a new entry to Google’s arsenal of search operators. Chapter 2
introduces Google-specific search operators: words in your keyword string
that tell Google how to interpret your keywords. Standard operators that
work in all search engines (AND, OR, NOT, and the quotes, or exact phrase,
operator) mix with Google-specific operators listed in Chapter 2 to yield
highly targeted search results.
In Froogle, three operators (one of them peculiar to Froogle) narrow your
shopping search with great effectiveness:
72
Part II: Taming Google 

 store: The store operator limits matches to particular stores. The .com
part of a store’s address is not required by this operator; for example, it
understands amazon or tigerdirect. But Froogle does need correct
spelling and spacing — for example, tiger direct (with a space between the
two words) does not work. (This is not an endorsement of TigerDirect.
But if that fine establishment were to send me all the items in its catalog
in consideration of this publicity, it would be rude to decline them.)
 allintext: The allintext operator limits matches to product description text.
 allintitle: The allintitle operator limits matches to product names.
We’ll consider the store operator first because it is special to Froogle and is
one powerful little bugger. Using it, you can instantly browse one store’s
inventory in any product category. For example, type
“digital camera” store:bestbuy
That search returned 188 results, which can be narrowed by price or by model
number. Figure 4-4 illustrates the results after narrowing the preceding search
to a price range between $199 and $250. Searching this way saves you the
effort of searching in many steps; you can leap from the Froogle home page
directly to a list of items in you price range and sold in a specific store. (This
is not an endorsement of Best Buy, but I’m never rude about receiving gifts.)

73
Chapter 4: Froogle and Google Catalogs Rescue Your Gift List

The store operator is designed to work when the keyword following it is
mashed up against it. In other words, don’t put a space between the operator
and the keyword.
To effectively use the store operator, you must know the Internet domain
name of the store. Froogle doesn’t understand store names per se if they
differ from the domain names. For example, Home Shopping Network has an
e-commerce Web site, and its URL is www.hsn.com. Froogle doesn’t know any-
thing about Home Shopping Network as a store name, but it does recognize
hsn as a keyword related to the store operator.
You can use the store operator in a general way, without using keywords to
define a product type, like this:
store:bestbuy
This search displays every Froogle listing for bestbuy, which isn’t practical. 
If you want to search the entire store, it makes more sense to visit the
BestBuy site.
The allintitle operator forces Froogle to match your keywords to product
names. I find this more useful when using descriptive keywords than when
using identifying keywords. For example, the identifying keywords digital
camera are likely to be in relevant results titles anyway. But if I’m searching
for a certain type of digital camera, using the following search string narrows
the results beautifully:
allintitle:4 megapixel
In fact, the preceding search string is all you need to get a nicely target list of
digital cameras because megapixel is a term closely related to digital cam-
eras. You can further narrow the search to a single store like this:
allintitle:4 megapixel store:opticsplanet
This string yields two 4-megapixel digicams currently on sale at
OpticsPlanet.com. (Not an endorsement, but if gifts arrive, you know what
I’m going to do.)
The allintext operator works similarly to allintitle but forces Google to look in
the product description when matching your keywords. Going for the text
instead of the title widens the search and lengthens your results. Use it when
you’re using keywords that describe product features and those features
aren’t likely to be part of the product name.
Note that many retailers squeeze lots of information into their product headers
in an attempt to get the product positioned higher on search results lists,
because Google and other engines are swayed to some extent by whether
keywords appear in titles. So when using allintext, your keywords might
74
Part II: Taming Google 

appear both in the text and in the title. Don’t be frustrated — this reality
merely encourages you to associate more esoteric keywords with the 
allintext operator.
Think in plain English when you’re considering allintext keywords. Imagine
you’re talking to a salesperson in the store, describing features you want to see
in a product. Here’s an example that continues the digital camera expedition:
allintext:preprogrammed exposure mode
That search recently delivered 122 confirmed results, ready to be narrowed
by price or store.
You may combine the store operator with allintitle and allintext. Doing so
hones your results effectively. Try this:
allintext:preprogrammed exposure mode store:megacameras
At the time of this writing, that search string delivered a streamlined page with
ten confirmed results (see Figure 4-5). Remember, though, that your search
results with allintext are not conclusive of what’s available. A lot depends on
how stores describe their products and, therefore, how their listings appear
in Froogle.

Froogle Advanced Search
If you prefer avoiding the use of search operators typed by hand but want to
make your searches more powerful, go to the Froogle Advanced Search page.
(See Figure 4-6.)
The first section of the page, shaded in green and labeled Find products, oper-
ates identically to the Advanced Web Search page described in Chapter 2.
This section employs standard search operators to include, exclude, and
group keywords in certain ways.
The next five Advanced Search features jockey your keywords in ways
described earlier in this chapter:
 Use the Price fields to define a price range within which products must
fall to enter your search results.
 Use the Occurrences drop-down menu to specify whether your keywords
should appear in the product name and description (the default selection),
or just one or the other (the allintitle or allintext operator, respectively).
 Use the Category menu to limit searches to a single Froogle directory
category.

About Google Catalogs
Most of Google’s great ideas depend on behind-the-scenes technology. But
one Google service relies more on hard work and continual maintenance than
great programming: Google Catalogs, a searchable directory of mail-order cat-
alogs, is brilliant in conception and execution. And keeping it going requires a
monumental scanning effort.
Unlike Google’s Web index, which crawls through Web sites and reduces their
content to a tagged database controlled by retrieval algorithms, the Google
Catalogs index leaves the content in its original format. What you see in this
directory are scanned catalog pages, laid out exactly as they would appear at
home. Well, you probably are at home. But you know what I mean — you’re
reading the catalog magazine on the screen.
But there’s more. Merely presenting scanned catalog pages would be interest-
ing but ultimately frustrating and unproductive. Google can search every
word of the scanned catalog pages, deliver targeted results, and even con-
trive to highlight your keywords when they appear on the pages. Google has
also designed a control bar for thumbing through the catalogs, turning your
browser into a specialized e-zine reader.
All in all, Google Catalogs is one of the most underrated features Google
offers. You almost never hear people talking about it. Part of the reason is
that Internet shopping is sexier than old-fashioned mail-order. But mail-order
is thriving, partly in reaction to the impersonality of e-commerce.
And here’s the beauty of it: Google Catalogs is most useful to people who
already get a lot of catalogs and enjoy shopping that way. Why? Because
nobody gets the range of catalogs Google makes available. (If you do receive
all the catalogs Google does, you need to reconsider your life. Seriously.) And
Google Catalogs solves the one problem of catalog shopping — namely, the
passiveness of an experience that depends on waiting for a catalog to arrive,
and then reading it through to find what you want. Google brings searching to
a realm that has always been limited to browsing. So whether you’re using
the Google Catalog viewer to examine a catalog that you receive regularly or
one you’ve never heard of, you get more out of that catalog.
I can’t hide the fact that, at the time of this writing, Google Catalogs was slip-
ping into a state of neglect. In the spring of 2005, I could not find a single cata-
log with a 2005 cover date. Google was behind in its scanning. The service is
still useful enough and cool enough (in my view) to warrant coverage here.
77
Chapter 4: Froogle and Google Catalogs Rescue Your Gift List

The tremendous scope of mail-order firms represented in the Catalogs data-
base is valuable, and it’s easy enough to link from an outdated catalog to the
company’s Web site. Perhaps it’s no surprise that Google is sloughing off in
the Catalogs service; it was always a quirky blend of old media and new media.
Searching Google Catalogs
As in Froogle, Google Catalogs presents a topical directory and keyword
searching. After you get into the directory, you can limit further searching to
that directory category or launch a global Catalogs search. Start at the
Google Catalogs home page (see Figure 4-7):
catalogs.google.com
The directory tempts by listing a few mail-order companies in each main cat-
egory. Feel free to leap into the directory by clicking either a catalog or a
topic on the home page. (Clicking a store name on the home page brings up a
one catalog for that store, not a list of catalogs; in most cases, that one cata-
log is not the most recent. I don’t recommend clicking store names on the
home page.) Drill down to subcategories.

Part II: Taming Google 

Figure 4-8 shows the directory page for Photography in the Consumer
Electronics category. Note that each catalog is represented by its cover, title,
short description, date, and Web link. Google maintains an archive of past
catalogs, which can gum up the works when browsing the directory. The
Advanced Search page (described shortly) lets you specify current catalogs,
but some of them are a bit dusty, too.
Click any catalog cover to see the catalog in the Google Catalogs viewer (see
Figure 4-9). You get miniature presentations of each two-page spread. Notice,
also, the viewer control bar atop the page. Some control bar features appear
dimmed in Figure 4-9, but they spring into action when you click one of the
pages to see a full-screen representation. I get to that in a minute.
Searching by keyword provides a somewhat different experience. Starting at
the Catalogs home page, I entered the keyword string digital camera, which
displayed the page shown in Figure 4-10. Here, for each result, you get the
catalog cover, a thumbnail of the page matching your keywords, and a
zoomed-in shot of the portion of that page containing your keyword.
Keywords are highlighted in the Catalogs viewer.

Chapter 4: Froogle and Google Catalogs Rescue Your Gift List

Here’s a rundown of the control bar’s features:
 Title bar: Atop the control bar is a summary of where you are and how
to purchase things. It includes the catalog title, its publication date, the
company’s mail-order phone number, and the company’s Web address.
Remember that the Web sites for mail-order companies are not necessar-
ily e-commerce sites. Even when they are, the Web site sometimes carry
different inventory and prices than the catalog.
 Page indicator: To the left of the control buttons, this indicator tells you
what catalog page you’re currently viewing.
 Page buttons: Click the arrow buttons to move forward and backward
by one page. (Or move by two pages, if the two-page view is selected, or
by four pages if the four-page view is selected.)
 Zoom buttons: Use these buttons to zoom in to, and out of, the page.
Zooming in (the plus sign) magnifies a portion of the page. Click any por-
tion of the page to zoom in this fashion. You can zoom in twice.
 Page view buttons: You can view one page at a time, two-page spreads,
or thumbnails of four pages at once. I prefer the two-page spread, zoom-
ing in as necessary. Large monitors running at high resolutions (at least
1024 x 800) are particularly suited to the two-page view (see Figure 4-12).

 Jump to page: Enter a page number and click the Go button. Using this
feature is akin to flipping through a published catalog. If you’re viewing
in two-page or four-page thumbnail view, Google keeps that view, with
your selected page as the first page of the spread.
 Search: Using the drop-down menu, you can launch a search of the cata-
log at hand or all catalogs — or you can leap over to a general Web search.
Google Catalogs recognizes your general preferences settings, which govern
the behavior of Google Web search. If you set the number of results per page
at one hundred (the maximum), you’ll get one hundred search results in
Google Catalogs, which is probably the most graphics-intense portion of
Google. Even with a high-speed connection, loading a results page with three
images per result can cause delays. The solution, as I suggested previously
when describing Froogle, is to stop the page load before it’s finished (press
the Esc key in Internet Explorer), and reload the page if you end up needing
the entire page of results.
You can request the addition of any catalog you don’t find in Google Catalogs.
Use the online request form located here:
catalogs.google.com/googlecatalogs/add_catalog.html
Or you can mail a request, using an archaic institution called the post office,
to this address:
Google Catalogs
171 Main St. #280A
Los Altos, CA 94022
Before requesting additions to the Google Catalogs index, be sure your request
doesn’t already exist in the index. Don’t count on browsing or haphazard
search results — search directly for the catalog by name. In fact, searching for
catalogs, not products, is a good way to review all recent issues of that catalog.
Advanced Searching in Google Catalogs
The truth is, advanced searching in Google Catalogs isn’t as powerful as
other Advanced Search pages. The reason for the simplicity of advanced
searching is that the Google Catalogs search engine doesn’t offer any special
search operators. So the Advanced Catalogs Search page, shown in Figure
4-13, is useful mostly for invoking standard search operators without having
to know them. Chapter 2 describes these operators (AND, OR, NOT, and the
quotes operator) in detail.
83

In This Chapter
 Understanding Google News
 Searching for news
 Customizing Google News
W
e have more ways of receiving news than ever before, online and offline.
Nearly every print publication runs an online edition, and a new breed
of amateur journalists publishing Weblogs adds a powerful new voice to profes-
sional news reporting and commentary. In addition, the mechanics of news
distribution have evolved rapidly over the last ten years. New, free tools such
as RSS feed aggregation and podcast downloading have made it ever easier to
receive a highly customized selection of news sources onto your screen (and
into your ears). Don’t worry if you aren’t aware of RSS or podcasts; you don’t
need to know them.
Google News is a virtual newsstand of astounding scope. It was revolutionary
when first introduced, and now, if not as novel, it continues to be as important
in the areas in which it specializes. Google News is a completely automated
search engine for daily news. That automation sets it apart from a major com-
petitor for your eyeballs: Yahoo! News, which uses a combination of news
crawlers and human editors. (Google News is not 100 percent automated,
because humans can add sources to the engine. But the selection of stories
and the arrangement of those stories on the Google News site are accom-
plished entirely by software.)
Google News sticks to its strong points and does not attempt to keep up with
new trends. This means if you’re deeply into reading Weblogs and assembling
RSS feeds in a newsreader (again, don’t panic if you’ve never heard of RSS),
Google News might not be a big part of your day. But as a news portal and
keyword news searcher, Google News remains unparalleled. Its index holds
new and dated news stories from more than forty-five hundred publications
around the world. It’s all free, and it’s all available with a few clicks.

Remarkably for such a mature and stable service, Google News remains in
beta (official test mode) as of this writing. Other Google services, such as
Google Desktop, flew through beta quickly, but Google has earned a reputa-
tion for withholding official releases seemingly forever. Google News sits at
the forefront of that reputation, but don’t be fooled by its beta status. Google
News has been ready for primetime for years, and there’s no risk in using it.
Googling the Day’s News
Google News is amazing — in certain ways. At the time of this writing, Google
News had not become involved with RSS news feeds, which represent a dis-
tinctively useful method of gathering news from many sources into one
window on your screen. But Google News is, itself, an extraordinary portal
that pulls news from many publishers, without any effort on your part.
Furthermore, Google News furnishes keyword search of articles from an
astounding number and range of publications.
There’s a good reason why the Google Toolbar (see Chapter 12) contains a
dedicated button linking to the News section. After you get a taste for Google’s
news delivery style, you’ll go back for more throughout the day. The front
page (see Figure 5-1) is a good place to turn for headlines or in-depth current
events. And I don’t mean just among Web sites. I prefer Google News to TV,
radio, newspapers, and magazines. No other news portal approaches its
global scope, intelligent organization, and searchability.

86
Part II: Taming Google 

Start at the beginning — the front page. It contains five main features:
 Searching: As in each of Google’s main information areas, Google News
presents a keyword box for searching. (More on this in the next section.)
Use the Search News button to confine the search to Google News. Use
the Search the Web button to toss your keywords over to the Web index.
 News categories: The left sidebar contains seven main news categories:
World, U.S., Business, Sci/Tech, Sports, Entertainment, and Health. Each
of these subject divisions has its own portion of the front page — scroll
down to see them. Clicking a sidebar link takes you to a dedicated news
page for that news topic.
 Headlines and leads: When you click a headline, the source page opens.
This method differs from Yahoo! News, Google’s main competitor, which
reformats its sources in the Yahoo! style. Google does not pursue the
same type of licensing arrangement as Yahoo! does, preferring to simply
link to a large pool of online newspapers and magazines. Accordingly,
your browser’s performance when displaying Google News stories varies
depending on the source’s capability to serve the page when you click it.
Slowdowns can also be the result of attempting to display a publication
from halfway across the world (the Web is not instantaneous when thou-
sands of physical miles must be traversed.). The brief description fol-
lowing a main headline is taken from the story’s first paragraph. In a
later section of this chapter I describe how to eliminate those leads if
you prefer seeing only headlines.
 Alternate sources: Google selects a few different, and usually divergent,
news sources below each headline. Click a source to see a story from
that source’s perspective.
 Related stories: This is where the scope and thoroughness of Google
News shines. Click any related link to see an amazing range of publications
covering that story. The related articles are listed on as many pages as it
takes to fit them all (often there are hundreds), and each listing includes
the first line or two of the published story. Figure 5-2 shows a portion of
one of these pages. Observe the timing notes; Google News indicates how
fresh the story is by calculating how long ago it was posted. Links in the
upper-right corner invite you to sort the list by relevance or date. My
experience is that the most recent hits are usually the most relevant.
87
Chapter 5: Saving Yourself from TV News with Google News

Unlike Google Directory, your Google preferences do apply to Google News.
This means that if you have Google Web search set to open a new window
when you click a search result (recommended in Chapter 2), Google News
likewise opens articles in new windows.
If you prefer a less graphic presentation of news, find the Text Version link in
the upper-right corner. The text format has the same features as the graphical
version, but without any photographs or columns, as shown in Figure 5-3.

Tracking a story over time
Using the related stories feature, you can track
the evolution of a current event. Here’s how:
1. On the Google News front page, click the
related link associated with any headline.
2. On the next page, click the Sort by date
link.
3. After the page reloads, scroll to the bottom
and click the last results page listed.
4. On the last page, view the oldest headlines
related to the story.
Move forward in time by clicking the
Previous link at the bottom of each page.

Searching for News
Searching for news really brings Google News to life. It’s amazing, when you
think about it; with a few keystrokes, you have keyword access to every arti-
cle published by forty-five hundred news sources around the world.
You search Google News with the same set of tools described in Chapter 2 for
searching the Web. Keywords go in the keyword box. (Click the Search News
button or press Enter to begin the search.) Google attempts to streamline
your results by filtering similar articles and presenting the top-ranked hits for
your keywords. Figure 5-4 illustrates a News search results page.
When searching Google News, you may use the standard search operators
(AND, NOT, OR, and the quotes operator) which are described in Chapter 2,
as well as these Google operators, also described in Chapter 2:
 intext and allintext: Use the intext operator to restrict a keyword match
to the text of a news article. Use the allintext operator to force a match
of all your keywords.
Figure 5-3:
The text
version of
Google

89
Chapter 5: Saving Yourself from TV News with Google News

 inurl and allinurl: Use the inurl operator to find a keyword in a story’s
Web address. This tactic narrows results and usually makes them
extremely relevant. Use allinurl to further tighten results by forcing a
match of all your keywords. The ultimate honing of results would be
putting keywords in specific-phrase quotes, and limiting matches to the
URL, like this:
allinurl:”social security reform critics”
However, this drastic measure usually eliminates all results. The prob-
lem with using inurl and allinurl is that story titles and keywords do not
usually appear in the URLs of publication Web sites. For better results,
use the intitle and allintitle operators, described next.
 intitle, allintitle, and quotes: The intitle operator works well because
keywords representing news topics tend to appear in story titles —
more so than in story URLs (see the preceding). Use allintitle to force a
match of all your keywords, and use the quotes operator to ruthlessly
narrow your results, like this:
allintitle:”podcasting popularity”
 source: This operator is specific to Google News and is useful for finding
articles in certain publications. Not every publication in the world (or
on the Web) is represented in Google News, so using this operator to
find a specific source might be an exercise in guesswork. But many of
the majors are in there, and of course you can narrow a search to any
source you’ve spotted in Google News using this operator. Use the full
title of the publication, and place underscores between words. Do not
abbreviate, even if the source’s Web URL is abbreviated, such as
www.nytimes.com. The correct key string for finding stories in the New
York Times is
keyword string source:new_york_times
 location: You may also narrow a Google News Search by region. Remem-
ber, you are determining the location of the source publication, not the
location of the story. Google does not recognize municipalities more
local than U.S. states. Use the Post Office’s state abbreviations, like this:
princeton township budget location:nj
As you can see in Figure 5-5, that search string brings up plenty of sto-
ries in local Princeton newspapers, a nice solution to Google’s inability
to search a town’s location as a region.

If the default U.S. version of Google News doesn’t pertain to your geography
or nationality, try one of the approximately two dozen other national editions
linked at the bottom of the front page. (More country-specific versions are in
development.) Alternatively, if you haven’t done so already, change your
Google preferences to your native language (see Chapter 2 to discover how
to make the change). If that language is one that Google News uses, the news
will automatically appear in that language. Changing the language from
English might reduce the number of sources harvested for news, because
Google is restricted to outlets publishing in that language. Figure 5-6 shows
Google News in Spanish.

Part II: Taming Google 
Submitting a news source
If forty-five hundred news sources just aren’t
enough, or if your favorite offbeat publication
never seems to be represented, you can sug-
gest a news source to Google. The submission
method is informal. Just send your suggestion
by e-mail to this address:
news-feedback@google.com
You may submit any site you like, but blog fiends
(and bloggers) should know in advance that
Google News scours few Weblogs, at least that
I know of. Google concentrates on traditional
news sources that publish on the Web. That
includes online editions of newspapers and
magazines and online news organizations such
as CNET.

Customizing Google News
Recently, Google added customization features to Google News. Customization
allows you to personalize the look of the Google News home page by rearrang-
ing the display order of main news sections, eliminating sections altogether
and inventing new sections based on search terms. It’s a whoppingly (if I may
use a technical term) useful improvement to the Google News experience.
If you refer to Figure 5-1, you can see a big Customize this page link on the
right side of the Google News home page. Figure 5-7 illustrates what happens
if you click that link: Your computer explodes! Kidding, kidding. You get upset
too easily. The Customize this page panel opens, embedded in the Google
News page.
Six customization options are available:
 Drag news sections: You can rearrange the order in which standard
news sections are arranged in the window by simply clicking one and
dragging it to a new position. (Drag by left-clicking a section and moving
the mouse while holding down the mouse button.) Figure 5-8 shows a
customized layout, but it is badly done. All the sections (except for the
Top Stories section, which remains on the left side of the page) have
been pulled to the right side, and Google translates this customization
literally, placing all the headlines in a long column stretching down the

Chapter 5: Saving Yourself from TV News with Google News

right side of the page, wasting the left side. Better to rearrange the order
of news sections in two columns, in the same general design as the
default page display.
 Delete a standard section: This option is not immediately apparent on
the customization panel, but you can do it easily. Click any standard sec-
tion, and a new panel opens. Click the Delete section box, and then click
the Save changes button.
 Add a standard section: Use this option when you’ve previously
removed a standard section. Eight standard news sections are available.
 Add a custom section: This is the best part. Create an original news sec-
tion to save any keyword search, and have that section appear on your
Google News home page automatically. Click the Add a custom section
link, and a custom section panel opens (see Figure 5-9). Enter your key-
word(s), and then click the Save changes button. Remember, you may
use any of the search operators described earlier in this chapter, or any
standard operators discussed in Chapter 2. Figure 5-9 shows a key
phrase with the quotes (specific phrase) operator.

 Show headlines only: This option clears out the leads below headlines.
It streamlines the page, at the expense of not seeing snippets of the 
articles.
 Reset page to default: If you’ve created many topical news sections, and
they’re getting out of date, the quickest way to start over is to click the
Reset page to default link. It’s also the quickest way to erase a lot of hard
work if you’re not careful. So be careful.
When adding a custom section, use the Advanced link in the customization
panel to see a few additional options, one of which is particularly useful: the
label option. If your keyword string is on the long and complex side, assign-
ing a label to the customized section keeps your display neat and coherent.
See Figure 5-10 for an example.
When you’ve finished customizing your page, click the Save layout button.
Doing so ensures that you will see the layout every time you return to Google
News on the computer on which you created the customization. Click the
close link to collapse the customization panel.

messages posted to Usenet newsgroups, which make up the native bulletin
board system of the Internet. You could look up messages posted years ago,
relive old flame wars, track down participants in e-mail, review somebody’s
entire Usenet output across all newsgroups, and perform a slew of other
newsgroup tricks. You could even use the site to post messages to groups —
an innovative, if clunky, departure from the traditional use of a stand-alone
newsgroup program.
Then, disaster. Deja News crumbled, a victim of the Internet boom-and-bust
period. Much grief was felt across the online nation. But redemption was at
hand in February 2001, when Google purchased Deja News and its catalog.
The renamed Google Groups performed essentially the same functions as 
Deja News did, but with Google’s advanced searching sensibility and lightning-
quick page delivery. Then, in December 2004, Google launched a second ver-
sion of Google Groups (still in public beta testing when this book went to
press), incorporating a massive overhaul of features and appearance.

Because of the word beta in the URL in this chapter’s figures, you might think
that you have a choice of using the new (beta) or old (not beta) version of
Google Groups:
groups-beta.google.com
You don’t. The official Google Groups URL takes you to the groups-beta thing:
groups.google.com
Don’t ask me why. I don’t know why. Stop asking. Some things in life must
simply be accepted. This is one of them. Be at peace with it.
This is a large chapter that takes you through basic Usenet information
before describing how to navigate Google Groups. If you’re a newsgroup vet-
eran, feel free to skip the first three sections without worrying about my
crumbling feelings. If you’re familiar with the previous version of Google
Groups, you might want to take a hard look at this chapter because the new
version is very different.
In Praise of Usenet
If you’re unfamiliar with Usenet, this chapter might seem like a big nuisance. 
I implore you to mellow such a harsh attitude and ease into these pages with
an open mind. Usenet is incredible. Google Groups is magnificent. The encom-
passing newsgroup culture is, to my mind, an indispensable part of online cit-
izenship. Let me tell you a little story.
Some time ago, one of my Internet service providers, a local cable-TV com-
pany that provided high-speed Internet access through a cable modem, sold
my town’s franchise to another cable company. There was no problem with
my TV service after the transition, but I suddenly couldn’t log on to the old
company’s Usenet service, naturally enough. I called the new company and
asked for the new server address that would enable me to get my news-
groups. To my astonishment, the representative told me that they would not
be offering Usenet service to their inherited customers. This was like hearing
they wouldn’t be providing e-mail service. I immediately cancelled my
account and got another ISP. Internet life without Usenet is inconceivable.
I won’t do business with an ISP that refuses basic services such as Usenet,
but the truth is I could have continued my newsgroup habit through Google
Groups. So if this scenario happens to you, don’t feel like you have to leave in
a huff as I did. If you learn one thing from my tragic (well, annoying) experi-
ence, let it be to floss daily. Oh, and that Usenet newsgroups should be an
important part of everyone’s online lifestyle.

Part II: Taming Google 

So, what the heck is Usenet and its newsgroups, anyway? Read on. This chap-
ter gives you a bit of history, and then moves to the practical stuff of using
Google Groups to begin — or, for the more experienced, to enhance — your
Usenet participation.
Welcome to the Pre-Web
Usenet is older than the World Wide Web and quite possibly bigger. It’s hard
to measure their relative sizes because the Web consists of pages with text
and pictures and Usenet consists of posted messages. Usenet is more closely
related to e-mail, which is why many e-mail programs (such as Outlook
Express) read public Usenet messages as well as private e-mail messages.
Usenet is the original bulletin board system of the Internet. You’re probably
familiar with some type of online message board. If you use AOL, you’ve most
likely seen or used AOL’s private message board system. If a favorite Web site
includes a discussion forum, you’ve probably read or posted messages in
that format. Both examples are bulletin boards, but neither is Usenet. The
crucial difference lies in back-end technicalities that are unimportant here.
However, it is important to understand the three major differences between
Usenet and specially built systems such as AOL or a Web site forum:
 Usenet is public: Anybody with Internet access, on any computer, can
view and participate in Usenet. Google makes it easy to stay connected
with Usenet even if your ISP puts up a barrier, you don’t have Usenet
software, or you’re traveling and are away from your home computer.
 Usenet is threaded: Threading is a layout style that clarifies conversa-
tional flow. On a threaded message board, you can see at a glance who is
responding to whom. AOL’s message boards are famously primitive in
the threading department, discouraging depth of conversation. Many
Web-based forums are likewise flat and unthreaded.
 Usenet is unregulated: This is a whopper. Nobody owns Usenet and
nobody even tries to regulate it. Message board behavior is uncon-
trolled. Usenet is not a place for children. I am not being critical; the
simple fact is that Usenet reflects the scope of human nature, in conver-
sational format, much as society does in offline formats. People are
mean, kind, ill-tempered, good-humored, stupid, smart, inarticulate, elo-
quent — and you see it all on Usenet. Language is spicy. Hundreds of
groups are dedicated to pornography. Fortunately, the Usenet realm is
organized and avoiding undesirable newsgroups is easy.

Usenet glossary
Know what you’re talking about when the con-
versation turns to newsgroups. More impor-
tantly, know what I’m talking about in this
chapter. Following are some essential terms
regarding Usenet and newsgroups:
 Alias: see Screen name.
 Article: Traditionally, a newsgroup message
is called an article. This terminology is a
holdover from the days when newsgroups
were about news and academic discourse.
Now, messages are usually called mes-
sages or posts. This book doesn’t refer to
newsgroup articles, but the Help pages at
Google Groups do.
 Binaries: Media files posted to Usenet.
Discussion newsgroups usually discourage
posting binaries such as pictures, music
files, and video files. Even HTML posting is
frowned on — plain text is the preferred
format. But thousands of newsgroups are
devoted to binary postings, from music to
movies to software to pornography. These
groups are usually identified by the word
binaries
somewhere in their Usenet
address.
 Cross-post: A message sent to more than
one newsgroup simultaneously. Although
typically a low-level type of spam, cross-
posting is sometimes used legitimately to
ask a question or make a comment across
related groups. Capricious or spammy
cross-posts are loathed, partly because
many people, when responding to a cross-
posted message, inadvertently post the
response to several newsgroups, com-
pounding the disruption. Generally, cross-
posting is bad form. If you do it, acknowl-
edge the cross-post in the message.
 Expired messages: Usenet messages stay
on their servers, available for viewing, for a
certain time. Then they expire, which is
sometimes called scrolling off or just
scrolling. The amount of time varies from
server to server and even from group to
group on one server depending on the
group’s traffic. When messages expire,
Google Groups swings into action by archiv-
ing the content that would otherwise be lost.
 FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions. Many
newsgroups maintain a FAQ file, which is a
long message spelling out the customs and
basic facts of the group. It’s acceptable to
post a message asking where the FAQ file
is located. Google Groups can also locate
FAQs for individual groups — just search
for FAQ within a group. Ignore the FAQ at
your peril.
 Flame: A message posted with the intent to
hurt. Flames are personal attacks, launched
in response to spam or other behavior con-
trary to community interests or just because
somebody is in a bad mood. Flaming is an
art form and can be funny or frightening
depending on the practitioner.
 Lurking: Reading without posting. In any
message board community, lurkers greatly
outnumber active participants. There’s
nothing illicit about lurking; newsgroups are
for recreational reading as well as conver-
sation. Anyone can delurk at any time to
post a message and then slip back into
lurker mode or stay out to talk.
 Message: Similar to an e-mail message and
often composed in an e-mail program, a
Usenet message is posted to a newsgroup,
where it can be read by anyone in the group.
 Newsgroup server: Usenet newsgroups are
distributed 
through 
a 
network 
of
autonomous, networked computers called
servers. That’s how the entire Internet
works, in fact, and newsgroup servers are
a specialized type of Internet computer.

101
Chapter 6: Preserving Online Conversations with Google Groups
Each newsgroup server administrator
decides which newsgroups to carry as well
as the duration of messages in the groups.
 Newsgroups: Topical online communities
operating in message board format.
Newsgroups don’t necessarily have any-
thing to do with news; many groups are
purely social. Technology companies such
as Microsoft often use newsgroups to pro-
vide customer service.
 Newsreader: A stand-alone program inter-
face to Usenet, often paired with e-mail
functions. Outlook Express, primarily an
e-mail program, is the best-known news-
reader. Some specialized programs deliver
only newsgroups, not e-mail messages.
Google Groups provides a Web interface to
Usenet and needs no program besides your
browser.
 Post and posting: Posting a message (often
called a post) places it on the public mes-
sage board. Usenet software, operating
behind the scenes, positions the post in cor-
rect thread order as long as you don’t
change the thread title.
 Quote-back: Portions of a previous mes-
sage repeated in a new message, to sustain
continuity in a conversation. Google Groups
provides quote-backs automatically, indi-
cated by the > symbol before each line of
the quote.
 Screen name: The online identity of a
Usenet participant, the screen name is also
called an alias. You find a great deal of
anonymity in newsgroups — and also lots
of real names out in the open. In Google
Groups, you set your screen name when
establishing a Groups account.
 Spam: One message, usually promotional 
in nature, posted (or e-mailed) to many 
destinations simultaneously. Less formally,
any repetitive and self-serving behavior is
regarded as spam. Spamming is considered
a diabolical sin in Usenet and is met with
flames.
 Subscribe: Bookmarking a newsgroup in a
newsreader is called subscribing. Unlike a
newspaper subscription, there is no charge
and nothing is delivered to your screen.
Subscribing is an easy way to keep the
newsgroups you follow handy. Google
Groups doesn’t have a subscription feature,
but you can use your browser’s bookmark
function to tag your favorite groups.
 Thread: A series of messages strung
together into a single newsgroup conversa-
tion. Sometimes called a string. A thread
might consist of two messages or hundreds.
Initiating a new conversation on a news-
group message board is called starting a
thread. Google calls threads conversations.
 Threaded: Online conversations whose
message headers are graphically displayed
to clarify the evolution of the discussion.
Threaded message boards make it easy to
see who is responding to whom.
 Troll: Newsgroup disrupters, trolls post
deliberately offensive or off-topic messages
in an apparent desire to get noticed at 
any cost. Some practitioners have taken 
the art of trolling to a high level of imagina-
tion and are regarded with some admiration
and even occasional affection. By and
large, though, trolls are reviled by Usenet
inhabitants.
 Usenet: A network of Internet-based bul-
letin boards called newsgroups, used 
primarily as discussion forums and secon-
darily as repositories of media files.

The Usenet system contains more than fifty thousand newsgroups. The Google
Groups archive holds about one billion messages and is expanding daily, even
hourly. Size isn’t everything, though, and the issue is really what value Usenet
has, or could have, in your life. I find newsgroups irresistible in four major ways:
 Community: The online realm has long been prized for its capability to
connect like-minded people without regard to geography, time zone, or
any other factor that keeps people from meeting face-to-face. A news-
group is created for practically every area of human discourse, from phi-
losophy to specific television shows. Finding a home in one of these
groups, and getting to know people from the inside out — without the
distracting clues upon which we usually base our likes, dislikes, and
judgments — is a unique experience. It is this quality of interaction that
first drew me to online services many years ago, and it is still, despite
the advances of the Web, the best thing about the Internet. Every morn-
ing I check my e-mail and my newsgroups, before setting foot on the Web. 
 Expertise: When I have a technical question, especially about comput-
ers, Usenet is the first place I turn. Thousands of people hang out in the
.comp groups (and others) for no purpose other than to help answer
questions and share knowledge about computers. Some of those helpful
souls are amateurs; others are professionals. A recent persistent glitch
in my home network was solved by an expert at Microsoft, who posts
dozens of newsgroup messages every day, outside his job, assisting
people like me.
 Recreation: Newsgroups are just plain fun — the rants, the humor, the
childishness, the astuteness, the complex threads. I browse through
Google Groups sometimes, searching on various keywords that come to
mind, just to get out of my well-worn newsgroup ruts and see what
people are saying in other parts of the vast Usenet landscape.
 Learning: Besides getting technical questions answered, I regularly read
certain newsgroups (especially in the .sci cluster) to eavesdrop on profes-
sional chatter. I have an amateur’s interest in physics and cosmology —
quarks and black holes and other unseemly phenomena — and it’s fasci-
nating to listen in on conversations among people who really know what
they’re talking about. Being a Usenet lurker in any knowledge field adds
a dimension to learning that you can’t find in books and magazines.
Google provides an excellent introduction to Usenet, and its searchable
archive throws open the doors to Usenet history. You might not choose
Google as your primary interface when posting, subscribing, and reading
every day. Stand-alone programs are quicker and sleeker, and they have
better tracking features than any Web interface can. But every longtime
Usenet pilot I know occasionally uses Google Groups for searching or when
traveling.
102
Part II: Taming Google 

Usenet Newsgroups versus Google Groups
The new version of Google Groups incorporates several changes, the biggest
being this: You can now create your own group. The first version of Google
Groups served exclusively as a Usenet archive. The second version continues
that tradition, but deemphasizes historical searching. The focus is now on
current-day communicating, and group creation is designed to gather clus-
ters of people who already know each other or who share an interest. Of
course, that’s what Usenet is for, and with more than fifty thousand existing
newsgroups, you wouldn’t think any more were needed. But creating a group
gives you control, which is fun and useful. You determine who is in and who
is out; you control the mailings that can go to the group’s members.
The coexistence of Usenet groups and homemade Google groups adds a layer
of complexity. One way to clarify this complexity would be to define it clearly
by separating Usenet groups from Google Groups. The risk, though, lies in
forcing users to approach Google Groups as if it housed two distinct domains.
Google prefers to offer an integrated experience, so it mixes the homemade
groups right in with the Usenet groups. In fact, the word Usenet is not found
much at the site — all groups are simply Groups. They are all bundled into
103
Chapter 6: Preserving Online Conversations with Google Groups
Accessing newsgroups on and off the Web
Some people use Google Groups as their only
interface to Usenet for reading and posting
messages. They have no choice in some situa-
tions, such as when a user doesn’t own a com-
puter and accesses the Internet on a public
computer. When there is a choice, though, my
recommendation is to perform most of your
active Usenet participation using a stand-alone
newsgroup reader. This program might not be
the same as your e-mail program. (They’re not
the same for AOL users.) Outlook Express, prob-
ably the most popular e-mail program, offers full
newsgroup functionality. In addition, many ded-
icated newsreaders are available as freeware
and shareware downloads. The Netscape
browser/e-mail/newsgroup program is free and
quite advanced. X-News is another good (and
free) one.
It might seem strange to advise against using
Google Groups for your daily Usenet lifestyle.
Let’s be clear about its strengths and weak-
nesses. Google Groups is best at archiving and
presenting a searchable database of Usenet
history. It functions also as an interface for post-
ing and daily reading, but its interactive features
fall way behind those of a stand-alone program.
Also, importantly, your ISP’s newsgroup server
is likely to be more up-to-the-minute than
Google’s server, and that factor definitely
affects the Usenet experience.
So, my advice is to use Google Groups for
searching and when traveling or forced away
from your own computer. Otherwise, use a
desktop program for subscribing to, reading,
and posting to the current day’s Usenet.

the same interface, so when you build up a volume of favorite reading mater-
ial, it is likely to come from a mixed bag of sources, some in Usenet and some
in Google. You are not supposed to notice this, and indeed, there is no point
dwelling on the difference.
However, there is one important distinction between Usenet newsgroups and
Google groups: Homemade Google groups can’t be seen outside Google
Groups. Usenet newsgroups can be accessed in a stand-alone newsgroup
reader and in many e-mail programs. Homemade Google groups can be
accessed only through the Web-based interface of Google Groups (or through
an Atom feed, which I get into later).
Signing In and Joining Up
Google Groups is all about membership. You have to start a Google account
to post a message in any group. Furthermore, Google’s homemade groups
require individual memberships to post messages. In fact, when you sub-
scribe to a Usenet newsgroup (see the “Usenet glossary” sidebar), Google
says you have “joined” the group, even though no such thing as joining really
exists in Usenet. Subscribing to a newsgroup is more like bookmarking than
joining; it just keeps the newsgroup on your page so you don’t have to search
for it every day.
These are the two levels of joining in Google Groups:
 Using a Google account enables you to post in a Usenet newsgroup.
Once signed in, you may post to any Usenet newsgroup without joining
it (subscribing to it). Besides allowing you to subscribe to newsgroups,
the account enables you to mark conversations (threads — see the
“Usenet glossary” sidebar). You also must have a Google account to join
homemade groups.
 Joining a homemade Google group allows posting to that group. (Some
groups act only as announcement boards, and you can never post to
those groups.) You must be signed in to your Google account before you
join the individual group.
If you have a Gmail account (see Chapter 14), it serves as your Google Groups
account. Gmail and Google Groups are closely allied and have similar interfaces.
Google Groups prompts you to sign in, or create an account, if you try to post
a message when signed out. Or cut to the chase by going to this account page:
www.google.com/accounts/newaccount

Part II: Taming Google 

Browsing and Searching Google Groups
Just as with the Web, Directory, and News portions of the site, Google Groups
allows you to both browse its content in directory style or search it with 
keywords.
Browsing the Groups directory
Because Google Groups has shifted its focus from the historical Usenet to a
mix of Usenet and homemade groups, it has altered its Groups directory. This
alteration is a major change since Google For Dummies was published. Now is
a good time to look at Figure 6-1, which shows the Google Groups home page
when a user is not signed in. (When you are signed in, the directory doesn’t
appear on the home page.) Note that the directory is organized by topics. In
the previous incarnation of Google Groups, the directory was organized by
Usenet address divisions, such as alt., sci., and comp. Those Usenet categories
still exist, and it’s possible to search Google Groups along those divisional
lines, but doing so is not easy.
Figure 6-1:
Google
Groups as 
it appears
when 
you’re not
signed in.
105
Chapter 6: Preserving Online Conversations with Google Groups

Topical browsing through the Groups directory turns up a mix of Usenet and
homemade groups. Drilling into the directory, you begin finding homemade
groups by the third level. At that level and lower (where the topics are fine-
tuned), it’s not unusual to find directory categories entirely populated by
homemade groups. Creating a group in Google is much easier than creating a
group in Usenet; as a result, homemade groups are nimbler in responding to
current events that people want to talk about. Homemade groups about spe-
cific movies, music groups, and new TV shows are common. In Usenet,
movie-specific newsgroups are rare, and a band or TV show must be long-
running to get Usenet coverage.
Figure 6-2 shows a third-level directory page containing links to four groups —
two Usenet groups and two homemade groups. Several aspects of the Groups
directory page are evident here:
 Google tracks where you are in the directory in the common “Top Level >
Second Level > Third Level” format. This linked display makes it easy
to hop back to the top level or any higher level. In Figure 6-2, I selected
high-traffic groups (the ones with most messages posted) in the Arts and
Entertainment category. You can also select lists of groups from the Topic
or Region category.

106
Part II: Taming Google 

 Usenet groups are identified by the “Usenet, public” tag below the group
listing. Usenet newsgroups are, by loose definition, public groups. (It’s pos-
sible to set up a private group using Usenet technology, but those groups
are mostly invisible.) Homemade groups are identified by their member
counts; Usenet newsgroups do not have membership rosters. And home-
made groups generally have longer descriptions than Usenet groups.
 Note that one of the groups is written in German, emphasizing the inter-
national reach of homemade groups (in this case) and all groups.
 Several groups are listed below My recent groups (in the left sidebar).
The header is a misnomer, and Google should change it. Those are actu-
ally subscribed groups. Google does present a single recently visited
group in the left sidebar, but only while you’re visiting that group! Oh
well, as of this writing, Google Groups is still in beta (the testing phase),
so room for improvement can be expected.
Browsing Usenet exclusively
Although Google Groups goes to some length to hide the traditional Usenet
structure of newsgroups, it’s possible to browse Usenet exclusively, leaving
out homemade groups. The link you need is Browse all of Usenet, which is
located on the Google Groups home page. If you’re signed in to Groups, that
link (with the topical directory of mixed groups) is at the bottom of the home
page. If you’re not signed in, the directory and that particular link are in the
middle of the page (refer to Figure 6-1).
Searching Google Groups with keywords
Using keywords in Google Groups is no different than in other Google indexes,
but, of course, the results pages contain entirely different content. Keyword
boxes are located at the top and bottom of pages. When conducting a simple
search, it’s important to remember that Google returns results that match all
parts of a message. In a simple search, you’re searching for messages, not for
groups — though, of course, every message resides in a group. You’ll likely
find interesting groups through interesting messages. Google matches your
keyword(s) against group names, message titles, message texts, and the screen
names of people who posted messages.
Figure 6-3 shows a Groups results page. What you see is a list of messages.
Each header links to an individual message. Below the header is an excerpt of
the message that contains your keywords, and below that is a link to the front
page of the message’s group. You can also see a time stamp, the author’s name,
and the number of messages in that post’s thread. Google helpfully lists related
groups (usually homemade groups) atop the results.
107
Chapter 6: Preserving Online Conversations with Google Groups

A quick glance at Figure 6-3 shows outdated search results. Google sorts
results by relevance first, and gives you the option to sort by date, with
newer messages listed first. (Use the Sort by date link.)
When you sort by date, the quality of your results frequently goes all to hell:
Google is no longer ensuring relevance as the first priority. Figure 6-4 illustrates
this phenomenon; I was searching for references to the physicist Brian Greene,
and the date-sorted results deliver many other Brians and Greenes. At this
point either more specific keywords (such as brian greene physicist) or an
advanced search is needed. The problem with changing the keyword string and
searching again is that Google sorts, again by relevance first. Damn Google and
its insistence on relevant results! Oh, wait, that’s what makes it so great. But I
wish Google Groups would stick to date sorting after that option is selected.
Using Advanced Groups Search
Google provides an Advanced Search page for Groups as it does for its other
indexes. And, as with the others, it offers a user-friendly way to employ
search operator functions without knowing the operators. As you can see in
Figure 6-5, the Advanced Search for Groups page looks very much like the
other advanced pages. The Find messages section works just as it does with
a Web search (see Chapter 2). Use the four keyword boxes in this section in
combination, forcing Google to treat your keywords in certain ways.

Chapter 6: Preserving Online Conversations with Google Groups

The Advanced Search page also includes the following search parameters
exclusive to Google Groups:
 Group: Use this box to specify a particular newsgroup for searching, or
even part of a newsgroup name. Feel free to include the asterisk if you
don’t know the entire name. This feature replaces using the group operator.
 Subject: Use this box for keywords that you want to appear in the thread
title. This feature replaces using the intitle and allintitle operators.
 Author: Use this box to specify an author’s screen name or e-mail address.
In the latter case, this feature replaces using the author operator. Using the
author operator with a screen name yields uneven results, which this
Advanced Search page works out through fancy operator syntax.
 Language: Usenet is international, just like the Web. Use the drop-down
menu to specify a language.
 Message Dates: This is da bomb. Here’s where the advanced action is in
Google Groups. The Groups archive is precisely historical in a way that
the Web index can’t be because each one of the eight hundred million
catalogued Usenet posts is stamped with a date and time. Use these
drop-down menus to specify a date range for your search. Google Groups
stretches back to 1981, though not all newsgroups are that old. This fea-
ture does not replace a search operator that can be typed into a keyword
box. However, very handily, Google places the drop-down menus below
the keyword box on the search results page (see Figure 6-6), so you can
adjust the date range without returning to the Advanced Search page.

 SafeSearch: This feature applies the same content filter as in Web
searches. (See Chapter 2.)
 Message ID: This rarely used feature searches for a Usenet message ID,
which you can glean from a message header.
Using operators in Google Groups
Chapter 2 covers search operators that sculpt Web search results in various
ways. A search operator specific to Google Groups is the group operator. Using
it forces Google to match your keyword(s) against newsgroups in a single
group. Normally, the group operator is used to find content in Usenet news-
groups because remembering the name of a homemade group is difficult and
unlikely. Usenet newsgroups have more generic names, and those names
reflect how Usenet is divided into categories of groups — groups of groups,
you might say. The most well-known example is the alt category, which con-
tains thousands of recreational, community-oriented newsgroups. Some large
technology companies operate customer-support newsgroups; Microsoft, for
example, operates hundreds of them.
You can use the group operator to ferret out newsgroups in these divisions.
For example, when searching for a Windows XP support group in the
Microsoft newsgroups, this keyword string is effective:
windows XP group:microsoft.*
The result of this search is illustrated in Figure 6-7. The asterisk in the keyword
string opens the door to results from all newsgroups in the microsoft division.
111
Chapter 6: Preserving Online Conversations with Google Groups
Up to the minute, more or less
Google puts a time stamp on every message it
displays and every message it archives. The
time stamp indicates the date and time (in
Pacific U.S. time, regardless of where you’re
located) when the message traveled through
Usenet and hit Google’s newsgroup server.
Keep in mind that time stamps for the same
message differ from server to server. Also,
Google has a reputation for being slower than
ISP (Internet service provider) servers. Since
the great overhaul of Google Groups, I have
monitored latency (which means the time delay
between posting a message and seeing it
appear in Google Groups) with uneven but
improving results. When this beta test was first
launched, the latency was a disastrous nine-
teen hours according to my testing, which com-
pared selected newsgroups both in Google
Groups and in a dedicated newsgroup reader.
(That reader accessed the newsgroup server of
a large national Internet service provider.) Since
then, Google has really snapped to it, dramati-
cally improving server performance. Delays are
measured in minutes now, not hours.

When using the group operator, always place a period and asterisk after the
division name you’re searching for, if you know (or are guessing) an exact
division. Neglecting the period-wildcard combination leads to quirky and less
specific results.
Operators usually work in reverse as well (see Chapter 2). Such is the case
with the group operator and the -group operator. The group operator, immedi-
ately preceded by a minus sign (no space), tells Google to exclude groups in
the newsgroup division that follows. Suppose you want to find discussions
about Windows XP and want to avoid Microsoft-sponsored newsgroups. The
following string is productive:
windows xp –group:microsoft.*
I can’t stop talking about the group operator. I want to make sure every reader
understands that it’s not just for defining top-level newsgroup divisions such
as alt., soc., and microsoft. You can use the operator to define a single news-
group, if you know its name. Let’s go back to the windows xp example. Perhaps
you want to avoid Microsoft newsgroups, but you also don’t want to trudge
through a hundred miscellaneous groups in which your keywords might be
mentioned. If you’ve received good results in the past from the newsgroup
comp.windows.misc, your keyword string should look like this:
windows xp group:comp.windows.misc
Figure 6-7:

Part II: Taming Google 

Note that there’s no need for the wildcard asterisk because you’re defining
the entire newsgroup name. Now if the reverse is true, and you want to elimi-
nate results from that particular newsgroup, here’s your search string:
windows xp –group:comp.windows.misc
Yet another special Google search operator lets you troll the Groups index for
messages written by a single person. The operator in question is the author
operator. This one is useful when searching within a single newsgroup or
across Usenet globally. The operator needs to be paired with an e-mail
address, not with a screen name. (You can, however, search for a screen name
without an operator.) As usual with Google operators, don’t put a space
between the operator and the address. Here’s the correct syntax:
author:name@email.com

Chapter 6: Preserving Online Conversations with Google Groups
Basic search operators in Google Groups
Google Groups understands most of the search
operators you use when searching the Web
(see Chapter 2). The standard operators —
AND (+), NOT (-), OR, and “ “ (exact phrase) —
work fine in modifying your keywords in Google
Groups. The exact phrase operator (quotation
marks around the phrase) is especially useful
when searching Usenet, which is full of collo-
quial speech. Suppose you want to look back at
Usenet posts about the famous Seinfeld
episode that introduced “master of your
domain” into the vernacular. This search string
is productive:
“master of your domain”
group:*seinfeld*
In addition to specifying the exact phrase, you
are defining a Seinfeld-related newsgroup,
even if you don’t know any exact names of such
newsgroups. The two wildcards (asterisks)
allow Google to search for newsgroup names
containing seinfeld. My results were 259 highly
targeted messages, mostly from the alt.tv.sein-
feld newsgroup and posted between 1993 and
1998.
One of the Google search operators discussed
in Chapter 2 also works well in Google Groups.
It is the intitle operator, which forces Google to
find only search results whose titles contain
your keywords. The intitle operator includes
only the first keyword after the operator. Use
allintitle to include all your keywords in the title.
The simpler intitle operator also allows you to
include entire exact phrases with quotes sur-
rounding them.
Working with the Seinfeld example again, you
can narrow the first search with the intitle oper-
ator, like this:
intitle:”master of your domain”
group:*seinfeld*
That search string narrowed the original 112
results to a trim, extremely relevant 11 results,
each of which contained the specified phrase
in the thread title. I should mention that Google
always attempts to find keywords in the thread
title, assuming that they are the most relevant
hits, and groups those results toward the top of
the search results list. Using the intitle operator
gets rid of extraneous results.

Reading Messages and Threads
When you click a message title, Google throws you into a different sort of
page that shows an entire newsgroup message (finally!) and various options
that affect how you perceive and interact with the entire thread. It’s from this
page that you can post a message (see the following section for posting).
Figure 6-8 shows a full Usenet post from the previous search on brian greene
“string theory”. Note that the keywords are highlighted in the message. Note,
also, that this particular message occurs in the middle of a long discussion
thread, and the thread itself appears as a list of links in the left frame. You can
click No frame to obliterate that list of links, but do so cautiously. The thread
(which Google calls a tree) is a valuable aid to navigating the conversation. A
few more things to note: The target message appears at the top of the page;
the next message in the thread appears below the target message; and, if the
target message is short, a few other messages might appear below it.
If the left frame showing the thread tree doesn’t appear, click the view as tree
link to conjure it up.
Figure 6-8:

114
Part II: Taming Google 

The size of a thread frame is adjustable. Position your mouse cursor over the
border between the two frames until the double arrow appears, and then click
and drag to the left or right. When dealing with long and complex threads that
are sharply indented (as in Figure 6-8), the left frame needs to be widened to
view the entire thread. Figure 6-9 shows the same page as Figure 6-8, but with
the thread frame widened to clarify navigation.
In certain circumstances, Google displays messages without their corre-
sponding threads in a left frame. When that is the case, a view as tree link
snaps the left frame back into place.
Complicated? It sure is. Fortunately, most people never have cause to remove
a message from Google Groups. And remember — doing so does erase your
message not from the Usenet universe but only from Google Groups.
115
Chapter 6: Preserving Online Conversations with Google Groups
Keeping your own stuff out of the archive
You can restrict Google from including your
Usenet posts in the Groups archive in two ways:
by preventing Google from archiving a post to
begin with or by removing an archived post.
You can use the Usenet software to prevent
archiving by typing a single line of code either
in the message header or in the first line of the
message body:
X-No-archive: yes
The line must be typed exactly as it appears
here, with a single space between the colon
and yes. Placing the line in a message header
is less conspicuous than positioning it in the
message body but much harder for most folks
to accomplish. So, when posting a message that
you want to keep out of the archive, just place
that line in the message itself. Make sure it is
the first line, above the quote-back that Google
places in all response messages.
Removing an already archived post is more
complicated. Follow these steps:
1. On the Google Groups home page, click the
Help link in the upper-right corner.
The Google Groups Help page appears.
2. Click the question, How do I remove my
own posts?
3. Click the removal tool link.
4. Enter the e-mail address used to post the
message you want removed, and then click
the Continue button.
5. Enter the message ID(s) or Google Groups
page address(es) of the message(s) you
want removed, and then click the Continue
button.
The easier of these two options is to find the
offending message in Google Groups, click
the show options link, and then click the
Individual Message link. When the mes-
sage appears alone on the page, copy the
page address (URL) and paste or type it into
the form here.
6. On the verification page, click the Continue
button.
7. On the validation page, fill in all forms and
then click the Finish button.

Posting Messages through Google Groups
Google allows posting to newsgroups, but you must register as a Google
Groups user to do so. This necessary step is not the typical Web site registra-
tion forced upon you to get an e-mail address, which is then sold to Internet
marketing companies. The main reason you must register is to establish a
screen name that is then used to identify your posts. I explain signing up for a
Google Groups account earlier in this chapter.
This issue of posting messages in Google Groups, and reading them in Google
Groups, can stir up confusion. Here are the essential points:
 You may post a message to a Usenet newsgroup from any Usenet access
point — your ISP, for example, probably runs a newsgroup server and
allows you to read messages on and post messages to that server using
Outlook Express or a newsgroup program. (AOL has discontinued its
newsgroup service. But I’m talking about real Internet service providers.)
Messages posted in this manner are visible in Google Groups, as well as
in your newsgroup program.
Figure 6-9:
Widen the
thread
frame to

116
Part II: Taming Google 

 Likewise, you may post a message to a Usenet newsgroup from Google
Groups. This message is visible in Google Groups and in any other news-
group program.
 You may post a message to a homemade Google group (after joining that
group) only from Google Groups. That message would be visible in
Google Groups but not in another newsgroup reader.
Registration is not required to browse, search, or read newsgroups through
Google Groups. In fact, Google doesn’t encourage or even display a path
toward registration until you first attempt to reply to a newsgroup message
or start a new thread.
You can post a message in two basic ways:
 Reply to a post
 Start a new topic
Replying to a message
When replying to a post, two methods present themselves, and, unfortunately,
the more obscure of the two is the better option. Figure 6-10 shows a thread
with two messages displayed. Each has a Reply link below it. Clicking that link
opens a box in which to compose your response, along with Preview and Post
buttons. This would be fine if only Google provided quote-backs of the original
message — it’s standard in groups to respond to a message phrase by phrase
or at least by quoting the entire original message above or below your
response. This technique allows readers to follow the discussion better.
In the preceding paragraph, it might seem as if I’m making too much of a
small point. But let me tell you something. When AOL discontinued its news-
group service in early 2005, many thousands of users decided not to dump
AOL entirely, for some reason, and swarmed into Google Groups to satisfy
their newsgroup cravings. Naturally enough, they started using the Reply
link below messages, and the resulting epidemic of unquoted messages 
disrupted newsgroup communities right and left. I’m telling you honestly,
you risk getting flamed to a cinder if you jump into conversations without
quotes — people won’t know what you’re responding to and will thrash you
for wasting their time.
So, now that I’ve frightened your socks off, here’s the solution. Instead of
clicking the Reply link below the message, click the show options link above
the message (refer to Figure 6-10). Figure 6-11 shows the options displayed
above both messages.

Now look at Figure 6-12, which shows what happens when you click the Reply
link in the exposed options panel. Note that the original message is quoted
back, allowing you to compose a response above it, below it, or interpolating
responses within it.
The other options revealed by the show options link are these:
 Find messages by this author: This link reveals other public messages
by the person who wrote your target message.
 Reply to Author: This link provides a direct communication between you
and the message author; your response is sent to that person’s e-mail
address.
 Forward: Click this link to send the message to anybody’s e-mail address.
 Print: This, of course, prints the message.
 Individual Message: An option I rarely (okay, never) use, this link displays
the message on an empty page, all by itself.
 Show original: This option strips the message of all formatting and reveals
the entire routing header. Figure 6-13 shows the result. Most people find
little reason to use this option.

 Report Abuse: This link displays a complaint form that, when filled out,
goes to Google. It’s important to remember that Google does not own or
regulate Usenet newsgroups. The company can disable a user’s Google
Groups account, and it can remove messages from the Google Groups
archive of Usenet. But those messages would still be visible through
other interfaces and that excluded person would still be able to post
by other means.
Starting a new topic
Anyone may start a conversation by initiating a thread in a Usenet newsgroup
(or in a homemade group in which the person is a member). You must be on
that group’s page to start a topic — you can’t do it from a search results
page. Simply click the Start a new topic link on any group page. Doing so
brings up a message composition page similar to the reply page shown in
Figure 6-12. Simply fill it in and post it.

Keeping Track of Your Groups Activity
Some people use Groups occasionally for research or to answer the occa-
sional question; others use it daily (hourly, even) to engage with vibrant
online communities. In all cases, and especially in highly participatory cases,
Google makes it simple to track your groups, threads, and messages. The new
system, in fact, is the single greatest improvement in the new Google Groups
over the old version.
Google provides two convenient links for managing your Groups activity:
 My Groups
 My starred topics
121
Chapter 6: Preserving Online Conversations with Google Groups
Fun and flames: newsgroup etiquette
To a greater extent than other portions of the
Internet (except perhaps chat rooms), Usenet
embodies a distinct, autonomous culture.
Embarking on a Usenet journey is not unlike vis-
iting another country. You might know the lan-
guage, but that doesn’t mean you know the
customs. It’s easy to make gaffes. And unlike
polite society in many countries, Usenet citizens
don’t hesitate to pound your virtual self to the
ground when you make a mistake. Rudeness?
Yes, but it’s more than that; Usenet is ancient, by
Internet standards, and proud of its traditions.
An unspoken requirement is that a newcomer
must learn the local ways before opening his or
her mouth.
Perhaps the most important rule is this: Lurk
before you leap. Even if you’ve been around
online communities before, get to know any
individual group before jumping in with your
own posts. Read the board for a few weeks to
get the flow of inside jokes, to understand its
topical reach, and to learn the personalities and
social power structures of the group. Google
Groups can compress this process by allowing
you to read back in time, covering a lot of
ground quickly.
Always put the community first. Newsgroup
stars develop through eloquence and intelli-
gence, not by pushiness. Don’t ever use news-
groups to promote products — even free
products such as Web pages. (Placing a link to a
personal Web page below your signature is per-
fectly acceptable.) Don’t spam, cross-post, or
generally attempt to mine Usenet’s traffic for per-
sonal gain. Go there to contribute to the common
good. If your contributions are worthy, attention
will accrue to your entire online package.
Flame with discretion. I am not a Usenet
peacenik who believes that all flaming repre-
sents an abuse of online anonymity. But nothing
is more foolish (or worthy of reciprocal torch-
ing) than a misinformed flame attack. Make sure
you have some standing in the newsgroup, and
get your facts right. The most cogent and enter-
taining flames go after another poster’s content,
not the other poster’s personality.
Overall, keep a giving attitude. No matter how
you manufacture your Usenet personality —
caustic, loving, intellectual, argumentative,
whatever — make contributions that somehow
enhance the group. It’s all about community.

These two bookmark lists are located in the left sidebar until you click a mes-
sage header — then they disappear. To get them back at any time, click the
Google Groups logo in the upper-left corner. Figure 6-14 shows the Google
Groups home page as it appears to an active user immediately after signing in
(or clicking the Google Groups logo).
The My Groups folder (it doesn’t look like a folder, but that’s a good way to
think of it) displays message topics to which you have posted replies, if those
threads have received more messages since you last signed in. The My starred
topics folder displays threads that you’ve bookmarked by clicking star icons
on group pages. Figure 6-15 shows a Groups page with two topics selected.
By using My Groups (for following discussions in which you take part) and
My starred topics (for following discussion you’re reading, without necessar-
ily posting), Google provides a quick way to keep track of your Groups life
without navigating to each group in which you’re active.
Do not confuse My Groups with My recent groups; the latter is a list of groups
to which you have subscribed. My Groups should be changed to something
like My Conversations, and My recent groups should be changed to My
Subscribed Groups. But has Google asked for my opinion? Nooo.

Creating a Group
Creating a homemade group in Google is a three-step process, assuming you
have a Groups account (see my explanation near the start of this rather long
chapter). This is how you do it:
1. On the Google Groups home page (be signed in), click the Create a
new group link.
2. On the Create a group page, fill in the name, group description, and
access level (see Figure 6-16).
Most groups are public, but some are used for mailing lists only; in fact
Google itself uses that mechanism to send press releases. The Restricted
option is good for a friends-and-family group that you wish to keep pri-
vate and invisible to strangers. When you’re finished, click the Create
my group button.

3. On the next page, add members, select an e-mail distribution method,
and write a welcome message, and then click the Done button.
You needn’t add members right now; you can do that anytime.
Everything you do on this page can be changed later by clicking the
Manage group link within your group. It’s probably a good idea to select
No Email, at least to start; many group members do not like receiving
e-mails of posted messages, and prefer to keep their Groups activity
within the group.
A newly created group looks just like any other group in Google Groups —
Usenet or homemade — except it contains no messages. Go ahead and post
one. You don’t want your members to be staring at a blank page, do you?

 Understanding Google Directory
 Browsing and searching the directory
 Visiting Open Directory Project
 Submitting a site to the directory
G
oogle is primarily known as a search engine, but it offers good brows-
ing, too. You search Google with keywords, and you browse topical cat-
egories in the Google Directory. (You may also use keywords in the directory,
in which case all results come from directory listings.) Searching is for when
you know what you’re after; browsing is for when you’re in a less demanding
mood. Searching is like going to the store for a gallon of milk; browsing is like
strolling through town looking in all the windows.
Google Directory represents a landmark achievement in human cooperation
and virtual cataloguing. Google takes its basic listings from the Open
Directory Project database, a large volunteer organization determined to
assemble the largest and most useful classified index of Web sites. More than
twenty thousand real-life editors evaluate and select Web sites for this pro-
ject, which was started in 1998. Listings created by Open Directory Project
are used by certain other Web directory sites, including Google Directory (as
well as Lycos, AOL Search, Netscape Search, and HotBot). Google takes Open
Directory as a kind of raw ingredient, and cooks it by adding PageRank formu-
las. The result is an enhanced directory experience.
Relaxing into Browsing Mode
After a hard day of Googling, there’s something comforting about putting on
the slippers, lighting up the pipe, and cruising around Google Directory. And if
that scenario isn’t weirdly retro-tech enough for you, throw in a dog bringing

you the newspaper. Browsing can be more relaxing than searching. Trolling
the directory leads to unexpected discoveries as opposed to the routine preci-
sion of Google’s Web search. Google’s search index is so precise and uncannily
helpful that it’s easy to lose track of the directory entirely — especially since
Google removed the directory link from the home page. Clearly, Google has
been deemphasizing the directory since 2004.
Nevertheless, Google Directory and directories in general are fun. If you’ve
been around the Web from the beginning, you probably remember the thrill
of Yahoo! when it was a new directory mapping out the infant World Wide
Web. The Web is hardly an infant now, and most of us — no matter how long
we’ve been online — are somewhat jaded about our virtual activities. By
encouraging newness and discovery, directory trolling enlivens an online life
that has become just another rut in our lives.
If you liken Google searching to finding a needle in a haystack (and a whop-
ping big haystack, at that), browsing the directory is like shining a giant spot-
light on broad topic areas of Web content. Search the index to be productive;
browse the directory for fun.
126
Part II: Taming Google 
Google versus Yahoo!
The comparison is inevitable. The two best-
known Web directories pitted against each
other in a titanic struggle to the death . . . in my
imagination, anyway. A competitive atmosphere
does surround these two Internet giants gener-
ally and Web directories in particular. Yahoo!
essentially invented the directory format that
became standard, and Google is now the fore-
most search-and-browse site. Hence the battle
imagery. And in this case, I give the edge to
Google’s Web directory.
Don’t get me wrong. I wrote Yahoo! For
Dummies and am the world’s biggest fan of the
Yahoo! experience. If Yahoo! disappeared, I’d
turn off my computer and step outside for the
first time in years. I pray it won’t come to that.
But when it comes to trolling Web directories,
Google’s ranking and general presentation put
Yahoo! in second place.
Google prevails for two reasons. First, Google’s
directory listings come from Open Directory
Project, a large Web directory maintained and
updated by thousands of volunteer editors.
Yahoo!’s in-house staff, diligent though it be,
cannot crank the numbers competitively. Bigger
isn’t always better, but with Google’s page
ranking — which sorts the gigantic directory
intelligently — I’ll take the bigger directory in
this case. Google Directory also displays more
neatly and coherently than Yahoo!’s.
The other reason for Google’s dominance is its
PageRank system, which prioritizes and
enhances the already stellar listings compiled
by Open Directory Project.
So, Yahoo! Directory, I visit you only occasion-
ally. You gave me my first tours of the Web in
1994, during a thrilling time that is no more. Now,
when the urge to troll comes over me, I head for
Google Directory.

The directory has its productive uses, too. In particular, Google Directory
serves as an alternate search engine for those who don’t like using search oper-
ators (see Chapter 2) to narrow the search field. The directory is all about nar-
rowing, from broad category to thin subcategory. Drilling into the directory, and
then using the within-the-category search function, is a fantastic way to bring
up high-quality sites with a minimum of hassle and technical search knowledge.
Here’s an example of directory productivity. If you’re searching for an online edi-
tion of your hometown newspaper, you could drill into the directory’s News cat-
egory, select Newspapers, select Regional, and search for your town’s name in
the Regional directory. This method avoids search operators in the Web index.
Understanding Google Directory
First things first. Google Directory, like most other directories, is self-
explanatory on the face of it. You just need to visit the Google Directory
home page to get started. Google used to link the directory to the Google
home page but removed the link in 2004. There is no question that Google
has deemphasized the directory: no link on the home page and no directory
links in search results, as once occurred. Now, you get to the directory by vis-
iting the URL directly. Here it is:
directory.google.com
Note: You can also get to the Google Directory by clicking the More link on
the Google home page, and then finding the directory on the following page,
which lists all of Google’s services. That More link is handy; I use it all the
time so I don’t have to remember specific Web addresses for Google pages.
127
Chapter 7: Mapping the Web’s Terrain
Open Directory Project
Open Directory is open to the extreme. Modeled
on the open source software movement, in
which resulting software programs are not
owned and anybody can contribute to their
development, Open Directory is distributed
free of charge to many of the most important
Web destinations, including Netscape (which
acquired the Open Directory organization in 1998
and oversaw development of this free directory),
Lycos, and of course Google. Accordingly, you
can view the nearly identical directory (allowing
for minor differences due to distribution time lag)
at several online destinations, including the
Open Directory home page:
www.dmoz.org
Google adds unique value to Open Directory and
makes it its own (as Randy Jackson would say on
American Idol) by imposing its PageRank structure
on the Open Directory template. That means the
site selections in each category and subcategory
are ordered by Google’s popularity and importance
formulas. In other locations, including its home
site, Open Directory is organized alphabetically.

Figure 7-1 shows the home page of Google Directory.
Click a main category link or a subcategory link to get started. Many more sub-
categories exist in directory strata beneath the Google Directory home page.
However, you needn’t dig deep before encountering results: Most main cate-
gory pages list primary Web sites for that category in addition to the first level
of subcategories for that topic. Figure 7-2 illustrates how this structure works.
Figure 7-1:

128
Part II: Taming Google 
Directory preferences (not)
On the subject of preference settings for Google
Directory . . . there aren’t any. Lack of global set-
tings isn’t a problem because directory brows-
ing is a simpler matter than Web searching,
which is subject to preference settings (see
Chapter 2). On one point, though, you might
expect the Web-search preferences to cross
over to the Directory experience: namely, the
ability to open a new window when you click an
outside Web link. This preference is extremely
useful in the search engine because it keeps
one browser window anchored on the search
results while you’re off in another window
exploring a result site.
Don’t expect Google to open a new window
when you click a directory link, even if your
search preference is set that way. Instead,
right-click any directory link and choose the
option to open a new window (or a new tab in
the Netscape, Firefox, or Opera browsers).

The directory runs deep — it’s not hard to drill down six levels in many sub-
jects. Don’t give up early. Searching in a lower-level category can yield inter-
esting results.
You might think that searching in a narrow subcategory is pointless because a
quick scroll down the page shows you what sites are listed. But when Google
searches a category, it doesn’t match your keywords against only the words
on the category page; it searches the content of the listed pages. This throws
the door wide open, but in a small topic area. Searching in a narrow directory
category results in extremely rewarding hits.
Figure 7-3 shows a subcategory page, in this case a third-level page in the
Society category. Two items on subcategory pages are worth noting:
 The directory path is displayed above the Categories banner. Figure 7-3
is a third-level page with a short path. Lower-level pages have longer
paths, and each step you climb down is linked, so you can leap back
upward along the path.
 The Related Categories section, under the Categories banner, links to
directory categories that share some degree of topicality with your cur-
rent category.

Chapter 7: Mapping the Web’s Terrain

Submitting a Web Page to the Directory
Anyone may submit a site for inclusion to Google Directory or offer correc-
tions of currently listed sites and their descriptions. When doing so, you
deal not directly with Google but with Open Directory Project, from which
Google obtains its listings. Google provides links for interacting with the
Open Directory Project submission forms, but I think it’s easier to operate
from the Open Directory site.
Most people do not sit in front of their computers trying to find interesting
sites that aren’t represented in Google Directory. If you do find yourself burn-
ing hours that way, you might consider becoming an Open Directory Project
editor. (Click the Become an Editor link at the bottom of any Google Directory
page.) Site submissions are usually made by site owners hoping to get more
exposure for their pages. Nothing wrong with that, but be aware that Open
Directory Project is a hand-picked, edited directory, and it is not obligated to
list a submitted site. Nor are the ODP editors known for their speed in accept-
ing new listings. Some categories are quicker than others; it depends on the
editor.
Figure 7-3:

Part II: Taming Google 

You submit a site by filling in an on-screen Open Directory Project application
that asks for the site address, a description, the proposed directory category
for inclusion, and your contact information. Google provides links to this
application at the bottom of some category pages. Look for the Submit a Site
link at the bottom of any directory page.
The Submit a Site link is convenient, but there’s a problem. Open Directory
Project is in charge of deciding which categories and subcategories are open
to new submissions. Not all of them are — especially upper-level directory
pages. Google doesn’t distinguish between open categories and closed cate-
gories, so it places the Submit a Site link at the bottom of all pages. When
you click that link on a category page open to new submissions, you get the
application form with any special instructions that apply to that category.
When the category is closed, clicking the Submit a Site link displays the gen-
eral information page about submitting to Open Directory Project.
Because of this confusion, I recommend starting your submission from Open
Directory’s home base. Go to this URL for the Open Directory’s home page:
www.dmoz.org
Figure 7-4 shows the Open Directory main page with its top-level categories.
They’re the same categories as in Google Directory, but the layout is different.

As you drill into the directory, keep an eye on the upper-right corner of the
page. Notice that some pages carry no reference to adding or correcting
a URL, while others offer the suggest URL link, or both. Figure 7-5 shows a
third-level directory page with both links. Click the add URL link to see the
application for that subcategory.
Generally, the broad categories closer to the top of the directory are unavail-
able for new submissions. Open Directory is particular about where new list-
ings are placed, and your submission is better received if you take the time to
research appropriate categories.

Part III
Specialty
Searching

In this part . . .
T
his part deals with specialty searching, some of which
is a bit quirky. Search through a university’s Web
pages when you’re feeling studious. Limit your queries to
government sites when you’re feeling paranoid. Hey,
indulge the mood.
Chapter 8 is anything but quirky; it introduces the hottest
field in the Internet search industry: local search. This is
where you grab the blazing spotlight that is Google, refine
its wattage to laser-thin accuracy, and point it at your own
little residential domain. Or somebody else’s little residen-
tial domain. The point is to link online searching with
offline results, and then get in your car and go buy some-
thing. Local searching in Google is an incredible experi-
ence. If you think I’m overstating the case, you really need
to read Chapter 8.
Chapter 9 covers Google’s preset specialty categories,
which make your whole paranoia trip as easy as look-
ing over your shoulder. Chapter 10 gets all professional 
on you by describing one of Google’s most unusual and
little-known services: Google Answers. This little corner of
the Google realm features a staff of professional researchers
standing (sitting, actually, and wearing tweed) ready 
to answer your research queries. Keywords are not 
necessary — you actually talk to these people on your
screen — but money is required. You bid fairly small
amounts for their attention and expertise. There’s more to
it than that, so don’t skip Chapter 10. Chapter 11 delves
fearlessly into Google Labs, where all sorts of weird exper-
iments are curdling. Some are of dubious day-to-day value,
but others, such as Google Suggest and Google Scholar,
are delightful and promising.
You’ve come this far; in your soul’s core you know you
must not turn back. The transformation of online life is in
process, and its momentum grips us all with the gleaming
vision of new possibilities, new realities, new virtual
selves. [Editors’ note: Brad Hill has become clinically caf-
feinated. An intervention has been scheduled. We hope for
a return to normalcy by Part IV.]

T
he Internet has a disembodied quality to it. Useful as it is, and woven
as it has become into our everyday lives, the Internet exists in a realm
parallel to the physical world, representing it in ways but always floating
above it autonomously. Sometimes I conceive of the Internet Nation as a real
(if intangible) land with borders made of electrons and a citizenry that inter-
acts without regard to real time or geography. In there, we even have a distinct
written dialect (if u no wh4t I mean), specialized customs, different standards
of acceptable behavior, and a particular sense of place defined by e-mail
addresses and Web site URLs. The notion of locality has a bizarre Einsteinian
relativity online, where everything is the same distance from everything else —
one click away.
When we Google something, we usually are searching for information, for Web-
stored content (such as a video clip), or for a service (such as an online travel
agency). What we seek, and what we find, has little or no bearing on the loca-
tion of our home, neighborhood, or town; the time of day, or other real-world
factors that define life away from the computer. For a long time, Internet search
engines were content to scour the virtual landscape. Recently, the idea of link-
ing Internet search with physical locales has taken hold with a competitive
frenzy. Local search is a new frontier of online search engines, and they are
stumbling over each other to be the most accurate and easiest to use. If the
idea is to make up for lost time, the engines have accomplished that; seemingly
overnight, local search has matured as a power tool.
And going local is fun! This is one of the most entertaining chapters in the
book, partly because local searching is so useful and partly because Google’s
tools are exquisite. Google approaches local searching with three discrete

services that can be used individually and that link together in certain ways.
These three services are
 Google Local: The flagship service for local searching, Google Local
was launched in 2004 and is linked on Google’s home page. Google
Local is designed to find offline businesses and services that lack a Web
presence — dry cleaners, restaurants, toy stores, dentists, and so on.
 Google Maps: Launched in 2005, Google Maps is a joy to use and is great
for mapping a region of any size, from the entire United States to the
intersection closest to your home. Google Maps is meant to compete
with Mapquest and Yahoo! Maps, and like those two venerable services,
it provides routes between two points and driving directions. Google
Maps also duplicates Google Local in certain ways, though the graphics
are different (and impressive). One can productively launch a search for
a local business from Google Maps.
 Google Earth: Google Earth is a satellite-imaging and flyover service —
and don’t worry, this chapter totally explains what that cryptic descrip-
tion means. Briefly, Google Earth is a control panel that you download
and install, and it lets you zoom into satellite pictures of any place on
earth. You can see cities, streets, houses, and cars. Through this
dynamic interface you can conduct Google Local searches, the results of
which are overlaid on the terrain.
This chapter covers each of these three elements, in the order listed.
136
Part III: Specialty Searching 
The promise and reality of local search
To be sure, finding brick-and-mortar stuff using
the Internet is not new. Online yellow-page ser-
vices have existed for years. Retail outlets have
linked their in-store shopping with their e-com-
merce shopping (some better than others) for a
few years. Local movie listings are a snap. But
an idealized version of local search would
enable the user to find anything related to the
physical world, not just business listings or
retail products. How about locating a state park
in North Carolina, or all the elementary schools
around Austin, Texas? Or perhaps you need a
graphic layout of the local airstrips in central
New Jersey. On a one-night layover in a strange
town, it might be useful to see a map of all the
convenience stores, gas stations, movie rental
shops, coffee houses, and ATMs in the area.
This is the sort of local searching long promised
(and unevenly delivered) by PDAs (personal dig-
ital assistants such as Palm Pilots and Windows
CE devices) and GPS (global positioning system)
receivers. The delivery isn’t altogether consis-
tent in Google or other search engines, either,
but the exciting part is that local search is trick-
ling down to ubiquity. You no longer need spe-
cialized equipment (a PDA or a GPS receiver) to
launch effective local searches. And in the case
of Google, the pieces are in place to weave the
online and offline worlds to an amazing extent.

Finding the What and Where
in Google Local
Google Local is basically a fancy online yellow pages. As with a normal Google
search, you enter keyword(s) and browse results. In Google Local, the results
are close to a location that you enter as keywords. Google claims to match
your keyword against its gigantic Web index, and then filter the matches with
business directory information (which means yellow pages databases from var-
ious sources) to display your regionally relevant results. The actual formula by
which all this takes place is undisclosed, in typically secretive Google fashion.
The results are generally impressive, notwithstanding certain glitches that I’ll
get to later.
The home page for Google Local is located here:
local.google.com
Actually, you can activate Google Local from the main Google home page by
including a location with your keywords, such as austin bar to find some of
the famous musical night spots on Austin’s 6th Street, or coffee 10001 to
search for coffeehouses in midtown Manhattan.
When conducting a local search from Google’s home page, local results are
presented above non-local Web results, as shown in Figure 8-1. Three local
results are summarized briefly below a link that leads to the full page of local
results at the Google Local site. Note also that Google Desktop results appear
above the local results (see Chapter 13 to read about Google Desktop).
Using Google’s main home page for a local search is convenient if you happen
to be on the home page when a local search occurs to you. Likewise, including
a town or zip code in a basic search from the Google Toolbar (see Chapter 12)
is probably easier than clicking the Google Local button on the Toolbar before
entering keywords. (Users of the Firefox browser enhanced with Googlebar, an
emulation of the Google Toolbar, do not have a Google Local option, so using
the keyword-plus-town method is essential.) But for serious local searching,
the Google Local page is the place to start.
Identifying the address in Google Local
As you can see in Figure 8-2, the Google Local page contains two keyword
boxes, one for the “what” and one for the “where.” Put your search keywords
in the What box and the location in the Where box. That location may be a
town or zip code, but nothing broader (such as a state without a town name).
If you do enter a state as the only geographical locator, Google whimpers and
refuses to cooperate.

Part III: Specialty Searching 

If you enter a town name without a zip code or state as your geographical
identifier, Google will try its best to understand where you mean, but will not
always succeed. When Google is forced to choose between two town names,
it will often go with the larger. Such is the case if you enter Jacksonville —
Google chooses the Florida town over the one in North Carolina. (In this case,
Google has deemed that the Florida town is more important, based on the
large number of instances of that town name in Google’s Web index.) In cases
of multiple small towns matching your entry (such as Anderson, which exists
in South Carolina, California, and other states), Google cries out in pain:
“Unable to understand anderson. Please try another address.” Simply add the
state or zip code, and all will be forgiven.
I know you’re wondering about the “Remember this location” check box
beneath the Where keyword box. Many people think that checking that box
enables Google to keep a history list of your search locations, and then auto-
complete saved locations when you begin typing them later. That would be a
good feature, but it’s not this feature. Check the Remember this location box
139
Chapter 8: Searching the Neighborhood
Choosing keywords for a local search
Keyword choice is always important, no matter
which Google index you’re working with.
Google Local seems especially picky and
unpredictable when giving results to common-
sense queries. The difficulty is reminiscent of
the experience of figuring out in which category
a type of store is listed in the yellow pages. You
don’t browse categories in Google Local as you
do in a yellow pages book. But you still must
sometimes play around with keywords to bring
up the best results.
For example, when looking for local Starbucks
outlets, I have found that searching for coffee
gets me better results than searching for coffee
houses or cafes. Both unsuccessful keywords
seem more promising than coffee, which is
what I might use if I wanted to find cans of
coffee. But the most popular cafe in my town,
located right in the center of the commercial
neighborhood, drops out of Google Local results
when I search for coffee houses or cafes.
Sometimes Google fails to recognize a local
search when launched from the main Google
engine or the Google Toolbar, even when a town
is included. After all, entering a town as part of
a keyword string is not new; people were doing
that long before Google Local was introduced.
In those cases, there is the risk that Google will
deliver normal Web results without the Google
Local results atop them. An example is austin
music clubs, which fails to shake out local
results from the Google Web engine. However,
in Google Local, using austin as the Where and
music clubs as the What works perfectly. Back
in the Web engine, austin music and austin
clubs each succeeds in triggering Google Local
results atop the Web results. (All these out-
comes might differ if you try the searches
because of the time lag between when the book
was written and when you’re reading it.)
The lesson here is this: Don’t give up right away
if a local search delivers unsatisfying results or
fails entirely, whether you launch it from Google
or Google Local. Tinker with the keywords, and
move from Google to Google Local to improve
the results.

when you want Google Local to default to the location currently in the Where
box. It may be a street address (with town), town name (possibly with the
state), or zip code. In the future, when you return to Google Local, that saved
location will be waiting for you. Google saves only one location at a time.
Working with Google Local results
Within a second or two of launching a Google Local search, you see the
results page. The Google Local results page (see Figure 8-3) contains four
main elements:
 Business listing: This is the company name, phone number, and
address.
 References: References are instances of the business name appearing in
Web sites. If the listing has a dedicated Web, that site is linked as the
first reference. Click the 7 more >> link (the number varies) to see all site
references to the listing.
 Distance and directions: For the most part, Google Local lists results by
proximity to your location, with closest results first. Sometimes, though,
you can spot a more distant result placed higher on the page than a
closer result. In those cases, Google determines, through its PageRank
system, that the more distant location is more important to your search
than the closer one. The Directions link is there to provide driving direc-
tions from any point to the search result listing. (Google assumes you’re
starting from the location you entered in the Where keyword box.)
 Map: Google Local positions the first ten results (lettered A through J)
on an interactive map; this feature is boffo. (Sorry; I time-warped to the
1950s for a second. I’m back.) Unlike Yahoo! Local, which makes the user
click away from the results page to see a map of the results, Google
Local puts the map in your face. Click any lettered map point to see the
name of the store or business it represents, plus the address, the phone
number, and links to driving directions. (More about driving directions
in the section on Google Maps later in this chapter.) Double-click any
part of the map (not a lettered result point) to recenter the map at that
position. Boffoest of all, click and drag the map to see past its edges.
Note: The shaded blurbs above the search results are sponsored ads gener-
ated by Google AdWords (see Chapter 17). Do not confuse them with local
search results. But that’s not to say that you shouldn’t click them if they
interest you. Many AdWords advertisers specify region-specific placement of
their ads, depending on where the user is physically located (determined by
IP address) and what the user is searching for locally. So, those ads might be
relevant to your local search.
140
Part III: Specialty Searching 

I’ve found it useful to conduct local searches of my hometown with various
keyword combinations. You can get acquainted with Google Local’s quirks
when you know what the results should be. In the previous sidebar I note
that coffee is a better keyword for finding coffeehouses than either coffee
houses or cafes. I learned that by searching my town, where I know all the
coffee places, and now I know the best way to search for Starbucks when I’m
away from home.
The maps are zoomable. You can widen your view by zooming out or get
down to street level by zooming in. Use the zoom guide (the plus and minus
signs) in the upper-left corner of the map.
Clicking a search result takes you to a page dedicated to that search result, as
shown in Figure 8-4. This page repeats the basic information (the company
name, address, and phone number, the distance from your specified search
location, and a map). Below the basic information there often appears a list
of site references; these are Web pages that mention the company or store.
The list of references, and links to reviews where available, are the only fea-
tures that distinguish the single-listing page from the search results page.

Chapter 8: Searching the Neighborhood

A final thought about Google Local
I don’t use Google Local much. You heard me. Let me explain.
Google Local was launched in March 2004, after Google For Dummies was
published. After its launch, I was all over Google Local, using it constantly.
Then Google Maps was launched in February 2005. As you can read in the
next section, Google thoughtfully bundled the Google Local engine right into
Google Maps. With great graphics and beautifully integrated driving direc-
tions, I now find little reason to get my local joy from Google Local. But that’s
just my taste.
The truth is that Google has made both sites nearly identical: Google Local is
more keyword-centric; Google Maps is more map-centric. They use the same
engine and deliver identical results. Use either, to your taste.
The one distinguishing feature of Google Local is the listing page containing
reference sites and (sometimes) reviews. That’s a significant distinction from
Google Maps, but one that isn’t important to me.

Using the Glorious Google Maps
Have you used Yahoo! Maps? Kiss it goodbye. Are you a Mapquest devotee?
Break off the relationship now. Good. You’re single again, and I want you to
build a love affair with Google Maps. It won’t be hard; I think you’ll be seduced
as easily as I was. Walk right up and introduce yourself:
maps.google.com
If you start poking around (which is no way to treat a new partner), you might
forget to come back here and absorb the many tips in this section. But when
you’re ready, I’ll be here with the step-by-step on how to manipulate the maps,
conduct local searches, and get driving directions.
Note: Google Maps works in all recent version of Web browsers (version 5.5 or
later of Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator; version 1.0 of later of Firefox;
version 5.5 or later of Opera).
Dragging, zooming, and otherwise
having too much fun
As you see in Figure 8-5, Google Maps starts you off with a large U.S. map. It’s
important (and rather entertaining) to find out how to control the map before
starting any searches.
143
Chapter 8: Searching the Neighborhood
Other local search engines
Google is hardly the only search company delv-
ing into local search, though it does seem to be
the most ambitious runner in the field, bringing
three distinct tools into the mix. Two other local
engines are worthy of mention: Yahoo! Local
and A9 Yellow Pages. The first is operated by
Yahoo!, of course, and the second is owned and
operated by Amazon.com. Here are the two
Web addresses:
local.yahoo.com
www.a9.com/optical
Yahoo! Local operates similarly to Google Local
but makes the mistake of putting the results
map on a different page from the actual results,
forcing users to click to find it. (And the maps
aren’t nearly as cool as Google’s maps.) A9
Yellow Pages is unique. A9 drove slowly through
the streets of several major American cities
taking photographs every few feet, and then
stitched those millions of photos into an enor-
mous, metropolis-wide slideshow. Every local
query at A9 (if it lies within a covered city) yields
standard search results accompanied by
photos of the actual storefront and the sur-
rounding real estate. The A9 system is intrigu-
ing, exciting, and has stimulated quite a bit of
buzz. It’s worth a try.

Single-clicking the map does nothing, which might make it seem unrespon-
sive to those accustomed to one-click recentering at Yahoo! Maps. Actually,
the Google Maps is interactive in several ways:
 Double-click anywhere to center the map around that point.
 Grab the map and drag it around with your mouse. (Move the mouse
while holding down the left button.)
 Zoom in and out using the zoom guide on the left. Although it looks like
a slider, the zoom guide is a 15-point incremental zoomer; you can grab
it and scroll it up and down like the scroll bar of a Web page, but the
map does not zoom in and out smoothly. Simply click any point along
the zoom guide or the + or – sign (above and below the zoom guide,
respectively) to revise the zoom perspective. Alternatively, you can
zoom using the + and – keys of the keyboard.
 Use the arrow button above the zoom guide to move the map from side to
side, or up and down, in half-screen increments. This method of moving
the map around is less flexible and intuitive than dragging it with the
Figure 8-5:

Maps starts
you off with

Drag it,
zoom it, and

144
Part III: Specialty Searching 

mouse, but there it is. You may also use the arrow keys on the keyboard
(press one and hold it), but they scroll the entire Web page first, and then
move the map. For wider panning around the map, use the Page Up and
Page Down keys (for moving up and down), and the Home and End keys
(for moving left and right).
 Click the center button in the middle of the four arrow buttons on the
zoom guide to return the map to the position of your original search
result. (I’ll get to searching in a bit.) This button is fantastically useful.
You can drag and zoom to your heart’s content without worrying
about getting lost. Cruise your way from Florida to Louisiana, and
then return to the original location, and zoom position, from which
you started.
You may also zip to a location in Google Maps by simply typing the location
in the keyword box. Try a zip code, or a town and state combination, or a
street address with the town and state. (Oddly, Google Maps doesn’t recog-
nize a state name by itself, even though the map can easily zoom to a level
that would display a state.)
By now you should be in love with Google Maps, and you haven’t even seen
the search results yet. Read on.
Local search in Google Maps
The smooth and clear graphics in Google Maps would be enough to sway me
away from Yahoo! Maps and Mapquest. But then Google turned a very good
service into a killer service by packing the Google Local engine into Google
Maps. More than 90 percent (92.427 percent, to be imaginary) of my local
searches are conducted in Google Maps, not Google Local. Superior graphics
provide one reason for my loyalty; another reason is that Google Maps com-
bines the two keyword entry boxes of Google Local into one. So instead of
entering separate What and Where queries (see the preceding section), you
enter single keyphrase queries such as pet stores in annapolis or hotels near
mco (mco is an airport code).
On the right side of the Google Maps home page, sample searches are pre-
sented in the three service areas: Maps (see “Go to a location”), Local Search
(“Find a business”), and Directions (“Get directions”). Those example search
categories correspond to the links above the keyword box (Maps, Local
Search, and Directions), which direct your search to one of those three serv-
ices. I already covered using the map; here I focus on local searches.
145
Chapter 8: Searching the Neighborhood

After you get the hang of the type of language needed by Google Maps, using
the engine is natural, and it is difficult to stump it. Following are three time-
saving tips:
 When keying your search to an airport, the word near becomes impor-
tant. The search string hotels ewr results in a zoomed-out map showing
hotels all over north-central New Jersey, not just hotels closely surround-
ing Newark International Airport. (EWR is the code for that airport.)
Changing the search string to hotels near ewr zooms the map in to a tight
view of the airport and the hotels surrounding it (see Figure 8-6). Using
near as a qualifier does not necessarily have this focusing effect when
searching towns and cities.
 Save your fingers some effort by using zip codes when you know them.
Typing 10010 is a lot easier than typing new york, ny. Beyond that simple
convenience, zip codes are more precise when searching a large city that
contains multiple codes. In those cases, when you enter a city name,
Google simply chooses a zip code by some undisclosed formula. For
example, the keyword string coffee new york ny brings up a map of a
neighborhood in lower Manhattan and its many coffeehouses. If you
were hoping to find a midtown Starbucks, that map is a couple of miles
off the mark. Using the string coffee 10001 shows you caffeine choices
around Madison Square Garden, in a closely zoomed map (see Figure 8-7).
To get a tight view in cities with multiple zip codes but populations not
as dense as New York’s, search a street address, complete with city and
state.
 Lacking a locator of any sort, Google Maps matches your keyword(s) to
the current map center. Big deal, right? Well, this feature becomes handy
when you’re expanding your search beyond its original locator. Let’s stay
in Manhattan (see the preceding bullet). Double-click anywhere in
Manhattan, centering the map around that point, and then search for
coffee. Now drag the map to recenter it, or double-click another point.
Click the Search button to find coffeehouses in the newly centered neigh-
borhood. (Your keyword remains in the keyword box for as long as you
continue this exercise.) The map remains zoomed at the level you set
when searching in this manner; I like to zoom out a bit to make my
sequential double-clicks reasonably far from each other. For some reason,
I enjoy prowling around the landscape searching for coffeehouses, pet
stores, restaurants, whatever. I admit I’m easily entertained. I admit I have
no life. But I bet you get hooked on neighborhood-hopping, too.
If you prefer zooming the map with the + and – keys on the keyboard, remem-
ber that you must single-click the map (anywhere on the map) after conducting
a search for those keyboard commands to work. Immediately after searching,
the mouse cursor remains in the keyword box. You must get it out of there (by
clicking the map) before Google Maps can respond to your scroll keys.

Chapter 8: Searching the Neighborhood

Google Maps does more than dumbly pinpoint business locations. After a
search, click any pointer to see details about that listing. (The right side of
the screen displays the phone number for each listing.) A pop-up window
(see Figure 8-8) divulges the phone number, the street address, the Web site
(or the first in a list of reference sites that mention the business), and a link
to driving directions. More on driving directions in the next section.
Atop the right column are three options:
 Print: Click this to bring up the standard printer control box used by
your printer.
 Email: Clicking this link brings up a Compose window for your default
e-mail program, with a link to the current map placed in the message
body. You must enter a recipient in the To field, and (if you choose)
change the default message title from Google Map to whatever you
please.
 Link to this page: This link provides a permanent address to the current
map. If you left-click the link, the map redraws with the permanent
address in the browser’s destination bar. You may also right-click the
link and choose the Copy Link Location selection in the drop-down
menu; then you’re free to paste the map’s permanent URL into an e-mail,
blog entry, or anywhere else.

Part III: Specialty Searching 

Finding your way from here to there
Google Maps furnishes three methods for getting driving directions:
 Enter a request for directions in the keyword box.
 Click one of the Directions links (To here or From here) in the pop-up
information window for any search result (refer to Figure 8-8).
 Click the Directions link above the keyword box and fill in the Start
address and the End address (see Figure 8-9).
As automated search engines go, Google Maps is exceptionally intelligent
when it comes to understanding a request for directions in a language that
approaches normal English. Rather than making you type information into
several From and To fields, as in Yahoo! Maps and Mapquest, Google Maps
accepts from . . . to queries in the same keyword box. You can even leave out
the from — it’ll still work. Try the following keyword string:
from 141 one mile road cranbury nj to 14 witherspoon street 08542

It brings up a splendid map with step-by-step driving directions on the side
(see Figure 8-10). As with other mapping sites, you may reverse the direc-
tions (click the Reverse directions link) and print them (with the Print
link).
In a typical sequence of events, you would search for a local business, and
then get driving directions from your home to that business. Google Maps
makes it easy:
1. On the Google Maps home page, enter your search string and click the
Search button (or press the Enter key on your keyboard).
2. On the search results map, click any pinpointed search result.
You may click on the map or on the right sidebar. An information
window opens over the map.
3. In the information window, click the To here link.
A different information window pops up (see Figure 8-11).

4. In the second information window, enter your start address.
Use the same rules described in the preceding section to define your
start location. Your start location may be as broad as a zip code, in
which case Google determines a specific start address for you. Of
course, you may enter a specific street address with town and state.
5. Click the Get Directions button.
Voilà. Notice that when getting directions by this method, Google puts your
start address and destination into the Start address and End address boxes
above the map. When you get directions with a long keyword string that con-
tains both locations, Google doesn’t separate the keyword form into two
boxes. In the latter case, Google seems to assume that since you used only
one keyword box for your query, that’s all you’ll ever need. But when you get
directions from a search result, entering a destination separately, Google
takes pity on your troubled self and provides the two keyword forms.
If you look at the right side of the page in Figure 8-10, and in any driving direc-
tions provided by Google Maps, the list of direction points is marked by
linked numbers. When you click any numbered step, a pop-up box illustrates
a zoomed-in view of the step.

Seeing the Real Picture
with Satellite Images
The maps in Google Maps are impressive, as online maps go, but you can also
see a far more realistic view of your search results by using the Satellite link
near the upper-right corner of search results pages or the Google Maps home
page. Figure 8-12 shows what the opening view of North America looks like in
the satellite view. The image is subject to exactly the same dragging and
zooming techniques described previously for the nonsatellite maps.
Any search result displayed in map view can be redisplayed in satellite view
simply by clicking the Satellite link. Conversely, you can switch back to the
map view with the Map link. Back and forth you go — map, satellite, map,
satellite . . . try to do something constructive today, would you?
The satellite view is more concrete than the relatively abstract map view.
Figure 8-13 shows a close-up of search results for coffee in Princeton, N.J.
Anyone familiar with the town would be able to precisely identify the loca-
tions of the pointers.

Part III: Specialty Searching 

The satellite view might or might not be more useful than the map view, but it
is inarguably more fun. Several Web sites have sprung up to list unusual,
beautiful, and otherwise impressive satellite images turned up in Google
Maps. Anyone can share a link to a great image. Just use the Link to this page
link, as described earlier in this chapter, to copy the page’s Web address, and
then paste it into your own Web page, Weblog, e-mail, or whatever. The trick
is to find great images. Success comes from exploring, and choosing likely
interesting sites such as airports, stadiums, or coastlines. One excellent site,
understandably called Interesting Google Satellite Maps, contains links to
hundreds of outstanding images. Check it out here:
perljam.net/notes/interesting-google-satellite-maps/
Another excellent resource is Google Sightseeing, located here:
www.googlesightseeing.com
Even with satellite images, when it comes to seeing the world on your com-
puter screen, Google Maps is just the beginning. The next section describes a
Google service that lifts the information you get from Google Maps to a
higher level — orbital, in fact. Your life might never be the same. Certainly,
your conception of how the Internet can link with the physical world is about
to change.

Local Searching from Orbit:
The Wonders of Google Earth
When I first downloaded and started using Google Earth, I embarked on a lost
weekend of which I have few explicit memories. Time passed in a haze of
exploratory intoxication. All I know for sure is that someone stuck an intra-
venous line in my arm so I wouldn’t expire from dehydration.
Google Earth: What it is and isn’t
As I mentioned at the start of this chapter, Google Earth is a satellite-imaging
and mapping service. The images and the program in which you view them
come from a company called Keyhole, which Google acquired in late 2004.
Google Earth is the first product to be released under Google’s ownership,
and the information in this section comes from a preview release given to
Keyhole subscribers before the official release of Google Earth. That was
then, and this is now, and as you read this Google Earth is available to every-
one as an official product. As of this writing, I do not know whether a sub-
scription fee will be charged.
According to promotions, Google Earth contains the only three-dimensional
rendering of the entire planet available on the Internet. The program calls up
an astonishingly smooth presentation that seems to whisk users, airborne,
over the planet’s terrain as they glide from one location to another.
The claim of three-dimensional rendering deserves a reality check. When
viewing cities, Google Earth delivers photos, pure and simple. The program
conveys a certain 3-D-ish look, as any photo does, but when you view the
images from ground level (which I’ll get to later), flatness prevails. Do not
expect to see the canyons of Wall Street rise up around you when zooming
into Manhattan. But some natural elements are rendered with a more realistic
3-D appearance, and mountains do indeed seem to rise above you when
plunging into the hills southwest of Sausalito, for example.
Reality distortions notwithstanding, don’t let any disappointment creep in,
and don’t dismiss Google Earth prematurely. The program is fabulous. I was
kidding about the lost weekend, but when I first got my hands on Keyhole,
and then later on Google Earth, I did do a lot of out-loud exclaiming. My wife
came in to see what was wrong, and soon she started exclaiming. (Our dog
was indifferent, but she has always been unimpressed by the Internet.)
154
Part III: Specialty Searching 

This is a good time to mention that you need a fairly muscular computer and
online connection to handle Google Earth’s heavy graphics load. Google
Earth is for Windows computers only, and minimum requirements include
Windows 98, a Pentium III (or equivalent) processor, and 200 megabytes of
space on the hard drive. Those are minimum requirements, and I think
Google Earth would bog down significantly on that computer. Recommended
is a machine running Windows XP, a Pentium 4 or equivalent, and 2 gigabytes
on the hard drive. A high-speed connection is not listed as a requirement, but
a good deal of graphics streaming takes place, and the soaring Google Earth
experience would be somewhat grounded without a DSL or cable connection.
The Google Earth cockpit
Learning to use Google Earth is like learning to fly. When you first start the
program, Google Earth displays a far-orbital shot of the earth and gradually
zooms you toward it, stopping at a respectful distance. (See Figure 8-14.) This
image of the earth’s globe is called the default view. From there, the controls
are in your hands. You can fly around the globe, dive down into the atmos-
phere, skim low and fast above the ground, hop from city to city or street to
street, and lazily float above your hometown.

Chapter 8: Searching the Neighborhood

Google Earth does not operate in real time. You are not viewing current
images, and you are not manipulating the camera lens of an orbiting satellite.
You are manipulating images stored in the Google Earth database, some of
which are rather on the old side. Google Earth responds to world events to
some extent; views of Fallujah, Iraq, were updated fairly frequently in late
2004 and early 2005. The views of some major cities were three years old at
the time of this writing. My town started construction of a new library three
years ago; Google Earth shows the old library and no sign of construction. In
a test that involved flying over real estate listings, I discovered that Google
Earth was not aware of some streets that were built two years ago and could
not find those listed addresses.
The first things to note about Google Earth, when you can tear your eyes away
from the graphics, are the control panels below and to the left of the graphic
display. (See Figure 8-14 again.) The bottom panel contains image controls for
panning, tilting, and swiveling the image — I’ll get to these a bit later. Also on
the bottom panel are check boxes that activate information overlays; that’s
where you can find the Borders control activated in Figure 8-14. The Roads
box overlays lines and street names on the terrain, as shown in Figure 8-15.
The Lodging and Dining boxes create instant search results, again overlaid.
The left panel features three panes used for multiple controls: determining
flyover destinations, local searching, getting driving directions, storing book-
marked locations, and activating a wide range of overlay information.
Figure 8-15:

156
Part III: Specialty Searching 

Basic flying techniques
The top pane of the left control panel contains a Fly To tab (refer to Figure
8-15), and that is where you enter a destination. Simply type your destination
in the entry box (as described next), and then press the Enter key or click the
Search button.
Entering destinations in Google Earth
The main navigation technique in Google Earth, aside from aimlessly floating
around (which can be quite enjoyable), is entering a destination. Unlike
Google Maps, unspecific queries are welcome. Google Earth accepts coun-
tries, states, cities, zip codes, street names, and numbered street addresses.
Google Earth flies to the destination and zooms to a level appropriate to the
specificity of your query.
Note: Google Earth always presents the first view of the destination you enter
with the compass on the lower-left of the viewing screen showing north as
straight up. Therefore, if you’ve spun the view around (more on that later),
the flight to a new destination is delightfully dizzying as Google Earth
smoothly recalibrates.
Anytime you zoom off to a Fly To destination, Google Earth puts the destina-
tion you entered in the space immediately below the Search button (see
Figures 8-14). You can right-click that destination and select Add To My
Places. The My Places pane in the left control bar stores a list of Fly To desti-
nations (as well as Local Search and Directions searches); think of them as
bookmarks. In future sessions, you can double-click any Fly To destination to
revisit that view.
Zooming, panning, tilting, rotating, and possibly getting airsick
Google Earth offers four basic ways to manipulate a destination view. Each of
these controls is located on the bottom control panel; hover your mouse
cursor over the panel controls to see their functions. Two of the four maneu-
vers listed next (zooming and panning) can be controlled also with the
mouse, as I describe a bit later.
 Zoom: The zoom control changes altitude. Zooming in, you move closer;
zooming out, you move farther away. Google Earth lets you zoom out to
nearly 40,000 miles, from which point the earth appears as a large
marble. You can zoom in to about 35 feet, at which altitude cars and
highway lane dividers are easily visible, and people are sometimes dis-
cernible. Resolution is always somewhat blurry when zoomed in all the
way. I find that useful zooming bottoms out at about 250 feet. (See the alt
indicator in the lower control panel, just under the image to the far right.
Note that the image in Figure 8-15, which shows building and trees
clearly, represents an altitude of 3355 feet.)
157
Chapter 8: Searching the Neighborhood

 Pan: Remaining at a constant altitude, you may move the view side to
side, or up and down. Visually, it sometimes seems as if you are moving,
not the image.
 Tilt: Google Earth lets you tilt the angle at which you view the ground.
From a viewpoint straight above your destination and staring straight
down, you may gradually tilt the distant horizon downward (more dis-
tant from your vantage point) as the foreground moves upward (closer
to your vantage). The effect is remarkable (see Figure 8-16) and arguably
depicts flying more naturally than the flat view.
 Rotate: Finally, you may spin the image around without affecting zoom or
tilt levels. This maneuver effectively spins the compass (located in the
lower-left corner of the view) so that you may see a destination from any
direction. Rotating is particularly effective when combined with a tilt.
The zooming range I mentioned (down to about 35 feet) applies to screens
running at the relatively high resolution of 1280 x 1024. (Right-click your
desktop, select Properties, and then select the Settings tab to see and adjust
your screen resolution.) Those numbers refer to the number of pixels (dots
of light) displayed by your monitor. The higher the numbers, the more pixels
are squeezed onto the screen and the finer the graphic resolution. Google
Earth benefits from high resolution, and gives you clearer low-altitude zooms
at the 1280 x 1024 setting than at a lower resolution. Because of book produc-
tion requirements, the screen shots on these pages were taken at the 1024 x
768 setting, which blurs the close-up graphics somewhat. Google Earth looks
a lot better at the higher resolution, which is supported by most monitors
built in the last three years and some older ones.
Panning can be controlled by dragging with the mouse. Simply grab the
image and drag it around. (Hold down the left button and move the mouse.) If
you release the mouse while it is moving — sort of flinging the image — the
panning motion continues and you can sit back while the earth moves below
you. This technique is worth practicing: hard flings move the terrain at a
quick pace; soft flings make it crawl.
Also worth practicing is zooming by dragging the mouse. You can use the
zoom control in the lower control panel, but once you get the knack of drag-
ging (use the right mouse button, not the left one), you’ll never go back. (You
can also zoom with your mouse’s scroll wheel if it has one. That style of
zooming is quick and incremental, as opposed to the smooth motion of drag-
ging.) As with panning, use the fling trick to set a zoom in motion, and watch
as you hurtle toward the earth or shoot upwards, away from it. Use hard or
soft flings to moderate the zoom speed. Unfortunately, Google Earth doesn’t
allow the image to pan and zoom at the same time, perhaps fearing that the
addictive giddy enjoyment would cause users to ignore all practical aspects
of their lives, such as jobs and families.
158
Part III: Specialty Searching 

The Tilt slide in the lower control panel is an important feature. Very often,
the flat default setting looks artificial and even disturbingly wrong. That
wrongness is caused by a conflict between the flat viewpoint and the angle at
which the photographs were taken by the orbiting satellite. The photo-
graphic angle can naturally produce a somewhat sideways view of tall build-
ings, and it’s disconcerting to look straight down and see buildings pitched at
an angle. Also, the lower part of the view can seem to be fading away from
you in a way that induces mild vertigo. I find that a moderate tilt (the control
works in only one direction: background down and foreground up, as if the
earth were tilting away from you) brings beauty and order to the view. When
flying low over mountain ranges, a substantial tilt is essential to get the most
of the 3-D effect — the Terrain check box in the lower panel must be checked
to activate that 3-D effect.
Use the Rotate left and Rotate right buttons to change the compass setting
relative to your position as the viewer. Because you can’t move, the rotation
is accomplished by spinning the earth below you. Try it, and then enter a
new destination. Google Earth rears back, arcs upward, and launches toward
the new location while spinning the earth back to north pointing upward —
the effect can be vertiginous, but I find it pleasing.

159
Chapter 8: Searching the Neighborhood

As Google Earth homes in on a destination, the image resolution gradually
improves; this process can take a minute or so if you zoom in quickly. The
images you see aren’t stored in the program; they’re streamed to the program
over the Internet. (Google Earth doesn’t work if your computer is not con-
nected.) You can note the progress of the resolution improvement by watch-
ing the Streaming indicator in the lower control panel. When it reaches 100
percent, the image is as clear as it’s going to get at that zoom level.
Global village: Local searching
in Google Earth
Google Earth would just be eye candy if not for the other two tabs in the
upper pane of the left control panel. Those two tabs are Local Search and
Directions. This section explains how to use Google Earth to get the same
results as in Google Local and Google Maps, and have those results overlaid
on the Google Earth terrain.
At the basic level, there is not much to explain. Click the Local Search tab,
enter a keyword or keyword string, and click the Search button. Google Earth
does the rest. As in Google Maps, you may enter the entire search string (for
example, italian restaurant orlando fl) in the top entry box or put the location
in the bottom entry box.
Figure 8-17 illustrates the result of a local search for coffee 08542 — it’s an
example I used several times previously in this chapter to find coffeehouses
in Princeton, N.J. The Google Earth view of this search defaults to a fairly
high view (more than 50,000 feet in altitude); you can zoom in to see geo-
graphical features more clearly. Note that in Figure 8-17, I turned on the
Roads overlay in the bottom panel to orient the results better. Clicking any
lettered result overlay on the terrain (A, B, C, and so on) pops up an informa-
tion panel, just as in Google Maps and Google Local.
After you perform a local search in Google Earth, you can see how Google’s
three local services — Local, Maps, and Earth — are tied together. They are
three different environments for displaying identical results. The displays
differ, but the results come from the same index and are the same.
The results of Local Search in Google Earth can be tilted, zoomed, panned,
and rotated just like any Fly To destination. Figure 8-18 illustrates a 1300-feet-
up view of coffeehouses in a Manhattan neighborhood, with the view tilted
and rotated.

Chapter 8: Searching the Neighborhood

When you conduct a local search, Google Earth displays the results as a
simple list below the Search button in the left panel (see Figure 8-18). Double-
click any one of those results to zoom in to it in the view window; uncheck
any check box to remove that result from the view window. You can also
right-click the search, or any individual search result, and select Save To My
Places; doing so puts that search (or individual result) in the My Places pane
of the left control panel. Once there, the search can be launched afresh in the
future by double-clicking it.
Plotting your course
As in Google Maps (though not in Google Local), Google Earth allows you to
order up driving directions from any one address to another. In the top pane
of the left control panel, click the Directions tab. You have two entry boxes
here, one for the starting location and one for the destination. Fill ’em in.
Click the Search button.
As with Local Search and Fly To searches, the Directions search puts its
results not only in the view screen but also in the Directions pane just below
the Search button. Right-click the search result (or any of the points in the
directions list), and then choose Save To My Places to bookmark the search.
Most people print driving directions they get online, and Google Earth
meshes nicely with Google Maps to accomplish this. When the result of your
Directions search is displayed, click the Printable view link in the directions
list located in the left control bar. Doing so opens a new pane below the main
view showing the directions search in Google Maps (see Figure 8-19). In that
pane, as in a browser window viewing Google Maps, you can use Print to
make a printout of your directions. (Click the X in the upper-right corner of
the new pane to close the Google Maps display.)
Now the fun begins. Look at Figure 8-19, and notice the Play button (actually
called the Play Tour button) next to the Clear button below the driving direc-
tions. Clicking this button sets Google Earth in motion, driving you along
your Directions route. The program moves from point to point, spinning
around to position your perspective correctly, zooming up and down, tilting
the image, all to convey a sense of driving along the route. Play Tour is one of
the most delightful features in Google Earth.
When driving along with Play Tour, click the Roads check box and the Dining
check box to get your bearings during the drive-through. Use the Pause or
Stop button to . . . well, pause or stop the tour.

Miscellaneous Google Earth features
Limited space prevents a thorough rundown of every single aspect of Google
Earth. In this section I want to touch upon a few important features not cov-
ered earlier.
Printing an image
The Print button is located in the lower control panel. Clicking it brings up a
small panel offering four print resolutions: Quick, Medium, High (1400 pixels),
and High (2400 pixels). Higher resolutions take longer for the printer to set
up. In all cases you get the view pane without the surrounding control panels.
Adding a placemark
Clicking the pushpin icon in the lower control panel starts the process of
adding a placemark, which also looks like a pushpin stuck into the image
window. Placemarks are automatically added to My Places, and you can visit
them with a double-click in future sessions. Follow these steps:
Figure 8-19:

163
Chapter 8: Searching the Neighborhood

1. At any destination, click the Add a placemark button.
2. In the drop-down menu, click Placemark.
3. In the pop-up window, type a name for your placemark, and then
click OK.
The placemark is listed in your My Places panel. Check or uncheck the box
next to that placemark to make the placemark appear or disappear from the
image view when the image includes that destination. (For example, when
zoomed out to view the entire North American continent, a placemark of a
street address does appear when that placemark is checked.) This trick with
the check boxes works for all items in My Places.
Using layers
Layers are preset overlays representing common search items such as banks,
coffeehouses, ATMs, shopping malls, railroad tracks, airports, bodies of
water, stadiums, grocery stores, schools, and many other community and
geographic destinations. Click the check box next to any layer to overlay that
feature on any image view. Figure 8-20 illustrates how crowded a view can be
with many layers checked; the view is of a portion of Los Angeles. I leave
most layers turned off during normal operation as I fly around the world,
turning them on one or two at a time as needed.

The Upshot of Local Search in Google
This chapter covers a lot of ground and introduces three relatively new serv-
ices, all launched after the publication of Google For Dummies. I can imagine
that anybody who has read straight through this chapter is struggling with
the sudden onset of mental instability. No, that’s not what I mean . . . anyone
who has gotten to this point might be wondering what the final recommenda-
tion might be. Google Earth is impressive but requires an investment of time
and computer resources. Google Local has received lots of publicity but
seems less advanced than Google Maps. Where should a person turn first and
last for high-quality, fast local searching?
I say, go to Google Maps. It stands between the high-tech glitz of Google Earth
and the basic search-and-map functionality of Google Local. The maps might
seem drab after soaring around in Google Earth, but they are, in fact, unusu-
ally clear and usable. Search results and integrated driving directions could
hardly be more intuitive and friendly. Google Earth is for special occasions,
and Google Local has, in my mind, been mostly supplanted. Google Maps is
the centerpiece of local searching in Google.

 Finding your way to Google specialty searches

 Searching the Linux and BSD worlds
 Using the Apple Macintosh and Microsoft search engines
 Schooling yourself in university searching
T
ake Google’s hand and let it lead you into a specialized universe or two.
Or three, or four, or five. Google has created alternate search engines
whose results are limited to certain subject areas. Google accomplishes this
topical restriction by choosing the source sites that can contribute to the
search results. Google pulls these sites out of the main Web index, and then
pools them into specialized indexes.
On the technical side, Google has isolated the worlds of Linux and BSD (both
computer operating systems), Apple Macintosh, and Microsoft. Each of these
areas enjoys a dedicated engine that searches sites provided by these organi-
zations or related to them. On the nontechnical side, Google invites searching
for government sites, including the related fields of military, local government,
and global government. (Google playfully refers to this search engine as
UncleSam.)
Rounding out the specialty categories is a large group of university-specific
search engines, each of which prowls through a single college or university
Web site. This mission is less limiting than you might think, because students
and professors stash all kinds of documents on their school’s computer. This
engine is also less innovative than the other specialty engines because the
searches are accomplished by simply adding the site operator (see Chapter 2)
to your queries. You could do that yourself if you knew the domain name of
the school you wanted to search.

This chapter is mostly recreational, unless you have a professional interest in
one of these subjects. The sites are Google experiments that you get to play
with. Having said that, though, I find myself returning to the UncleSam engine
over and over for truly productive specialty searches.
Finding the Specialty Searches
Following its quiet tradition of refusing to promote its fringe features, Google
buries its specialty services, perhaps discouraging regular use. You can get to
the search engines described in this chapter through the main Google home
page, but you have to know where to click, and the procedure is tiresome.
Your online lifestyle is too busy for excessive mouse clicks. You have virtual
places to go and ephemeral people to meet. Chips to devour and soda to
drink. This section provides some tips for quickly reaching the government,
BSD, Linux, Mac, Microsoft, and university search pages.
First, the URLs of the specialty search pages. The direct Web addresses are
so easy to remember (with the exception of the university page) that your
preferred method might be to simply type the URL in your browser’s address
bar. Here are the addresses, which point self-evidently to their respective
search pages:
www.google.com/bsd
www.google.com/linux
www.google.com/unclesam
www.google.com/mac
www.google.com/microsoft
The university page is perplexingly more obscure, but if you have a good
memory it doesn’t pose much of a problem:
www.google.com/options/universities.html
Yes, you do need to type the .html at the end. Another option is to leap
directly to the search page for a specific university by constructing a URL
like this:
www.google.com/univ/princeton
www.google.com/univ/nyu
Notice that some universities are abbreviated, requiring some guesswork on
your part. But most names are fairly obvious. Frustratingly, this address
www.google.com/univ
does not deliver the main university search page, though it is the basis of
specific university pages.
168
Part III: Specialty Searching 

U.S. Government Searches
Arguably, the most useful of Google’s specialty search areas is that devoted
to the U.S. government. Actually, this distinct search engine is both larger
and smaller than the name implies. This engine is global in reach. At the same
time, it reaches below federal government sites to the state and municipal
level.
You might think that this entire search engine merely replaces the site:.gov
operator:keyword combination described in Chapter 2. Not so. In fact, site:.gov
remains quite useful in the UncleSam search because the results pages dish up
a hearty mix of gov, mil (for military), and com sites that bear some relation to
government, public policy, law, defense, and other fields of administration, the
judiciary, and the legislature. All domain extensions are represented here.
The best way to get a feel for the blend of results you get in the U.S. govern-
ment search is to throw in some keywords and let it rip. Don’t think too hard
about it — any keywords will do. Try generic, common words that you’d use
in a general Web search, such as internet or music or paris vacation. Or
choose newsy words such as bush or terrorism or treaty.
Use the results of your search to find Web sites that you can later search with
the site operator. You can perform such a search in a general or UncleSam
Web search. In fact, some of these discovered sites might make it to your
bookmark list for regular visitation. The following are some examples of inter-
esting sites that turn up in UncleSam searches:
speaker.house.gov
freedom.house.gov
democraticleader.house.gov
memory.loc.gov
gop.gov
Many related domains are too numerous and related to list, such as state gov-
ernment sites and the sites of individual House members.
Searching on issues and hot phrases can reveal who in the government
(individuals, agencies, committees) is involved in that issue. Some examples
include:
pledge of allegiance
fcc deregulation
abortion legislation
These searches display sites of agencies and members of Congress, in addition
to more general information pages. See Figure 9-1 for an interesting search.
169
Chapter 9: Shining the Search Spotlight on Specialty Categories

All the specialty search engines recognize the same search operators you use
in a normal Web search (see Chapter 2). I often use the filetype operator to
search for PDF files in the U.S. government area, plumbing a rich trove of
Congressional hearing transcriptions, court judgments, and other official docu-
ments that are customarily posted online in PDF format. Using filetype:pdf
transforms any search; try adding it after any keyword string. For example:
music hearings filetype:pdf
housing starts filetype:pdf
testimony military filetype:pdf
consumer confidence filetype:pdf
The intitle and allintitle operators also work well in UncleSam searches. In
fact, combining the power of those operators with the filetype:pdf combina-
tion is particularly fruitful because PDF files are usually titled so carefully —
far more carefully than Web pages. Get specific with the title words. These
examples have worked well to sharply narrow results:
allintitle:bush social security filetype:pdf
allintitle:social security future filetype:pdf
allintitle:iraq reconstruction filetype:pdf

Part III: Specialty Searching 

The preceding examples also work nicely — and quite differently — without
the filetype:pdf addition.
Think about using keywords that are applicable to different fields of inquiry,
such as testimony or “congressional hearing” or policy. Putting almost any-
thing after one of those yields fertile results; try music, movies, abortion,
taxes, airlines paired with one of them.
Linux and BSD Searches
Linux is the open-source operating system that has been making waves for the
past few years. Linux is much older than that, but only in recent years have
developers created ready-for-primetime versions of Linux that have been
loaded into computers selling in mainstream stores. Linux loyalists regard their
operating system as a dynamic competitor of Microsoft Windows. Nobody
owns Linux, though several companies own their respective operating system
products based on Linux. Accordingly, Linux really refers to a family of operat-
ing systems, all built on the same foundation and with similar features.
BSD is also an open-source family of operating systems based on Unix. BSD
got its start at Berkeley, and the acronym stands for Berkeley Software
Distribution. BSD has less prominence in the consumer marketplace than
Linux does, but BSD servers (operating systems for Internet and intranet
computers) are in fairly wide use.
The term open source refers to any software authoring project operating in
the public domain. Anyone may grab the code of such a project and alter it.
Normally, open-source projects are organized to some extent by volunteer
programmers who work on the program either as a hobby or as a potential
profession. By definition, open-source software code is not owned. But in
most cases, an individual or company is free to make a commercial product
from a tailored version of open-source software.
If you have no interest in Linux, BSD, operating systems, or the open-source
movement, the Linux and BSD specialty search areas might not be of much
interest. If you want to take an interest, either search site is a good place to
find out about the history and current state of Linux or BSD. As with the U.S.
government search site, the BSD and Linux engines both forage in a
restricted universe of relevant Web sources.
One fun experiment, even for those with merely a passing interest in these
subjects, is to search for microsoft windows in the Linux engine. One recent
search turned up, as the first result, a source site for obtaining Windows
refunds. (No bashing intended — I run a Windows-only household. I’m just
easily amused.)

Chapter 9: Shining the Search Spotlight on Specialty Categories

Mac and Microsoft Searches
Apple Macintosh and Microsoft Windows: two operating system behemoths
representing a fundamental polarity in the computer world. Nobody can
claim that the Mac is a behemoth in terms of market share, because Apple
sells less than 5 percent of all new computers. But when it comes to ferocious
loyalty and PR stamina, Apple has world-class clout. Google has assembled
a trove of Web sources relating to each system and segregated them into
distinct search engines.
A favorite game of mine (I am very easily amused) is to open two browser
tabs (or two windows in Internet Explorer), one for the Mac search engine
and one for the Microsoft search engine. Then I search both for the same
terms. Try internet explorer, ipod, “steve jobs”, and “bill gates”. Compare
results for mind-twisting alternative perspectives. Good times!
Because Apple and Microsoft both maintain substantial Web domains, the
pages of those domains tend to appear disproportionately. Get around this by
using a minus sign, which is the symbol for the NOT operator (see Chapter 2).
When searching the Mac engine, blot out microsoft.com, and when searching
the Mac site, eradicate apple.com. Here are two example search strings:
itunes specifications -site:apple.com
windows xp networking -site:microsoft.com
You can override the limitations of the Mac and Microsoft search engines by
using the site operator, pointing it to any site. This is a marginally useful tip,
granted, but there might be a time when you want to break out of Macland or
Microsoftville by searching another site without tracking your way back to
the Google home page. Of course, this point is superfluous if you use Google
Toolbar. Are you using the Google Toolbar? You should be. See Chapter 12 for
more tiresome exhortations.
University Searches
High-school seniors take note: Google has your search engine. The university
specialty searches let you rummage through a single university’s Web site
with the power of Google’s search algorithms and operators.
University search operates differently than the other specialty searches
described in this chapter. Google does not aggregate many university sites
for searching. And this is not a search engine for getting information about
universities in general. Instead, Google has actually created dozens of small
search engines, each dedicated to a single university Web domain.
172
Part III: Specialty Searching 

Useful? Well . . . this specialized search helps if you repeatedly search in a
certain college site. Or, if you learn the URL syntax I divulge in the first section
of this chapter, you can seamlessly surf from one specialty university engine
to another.
You can avoid the inconvenient trip to Google’s university search pages by
using the site operator, assuming you know the university’s URL. Virtually all
university site domains end with the .edu extension, so you need to know the
primary domain name, which is often easy to guess. Let’s say you want to
search for keywords matching inside Princeton’s site. A simple (and correct)
guess of Princeton’s domain is princeton.edu. So this keyword string
admissions policies site:princeton.edu
gets you the links you want from the Google home page or the Google
Toolbar.
Remember, also, that you can conduct a search across all educational
domains by using the edu extension with the site operator, like this:
undergraduate stress site:edu
But let’s not diverge too far from the straight and narrow. You can always
approach the university specialty search sites the way Google intended:
1. Go to the following page:
www.google.com/options/universities.html
2. Click the university link you want to search.
All university links are contained on this single, long page. Scroll down
or click an alphabet link to leap ahead.
3. On the resulting search page, launch your search in the regular
fashion.
All results point to pages in that university’s Web site.
Not all colleges and universities are represented in these search engines, by a
long stretch. I sometimes visit Rollins College in Winter Park, Florida, and am
disappointed that it’s missing from Google’s college list. But this is when using
the site operator is handy. Because I know the Rollins domain is rollins.edu,
I can search it from Google’s home page or the Google Toolbar at any time.
The university search engines are not affiliated with the universities. Go
directly to the university Web site for a glossier presentation of the school.

I
n the background, behind your screen, next to the heaving mass that is the
living Google index, resides a freelance staff of human researchers approved
by Google to track down answers to specific queries. Whereas keyword search
queries display automated search results — basically page after page of
links — Google Answers queries result in conversations and expert answers.
Google rigorously screens this staff of researchers for informational agility
and communicativeness. They are paid 75 percent of the fees assigned by
users to their posted questions. Google gets the other 25 percent.
Researchers are not assigned to certain questions; they claim them, based on
their areas of expertise and their willingness to tackle the query’s needs.
The only Google-branded consumer service that isn’t free, Google Answers
lets you set the price for expert advice, facts, and linkage. No other portion of
Google lives up to this book’s title — Search and Rescue — more than Google
Answers, which can be an informational lifesaver when your search is too
exotic or academic for the free engines.
This chapter covers every aspect of Google Answers — from creating an
account to posting a question, from setting a price to rating the answers.
Don’t blow off this chapter, no matter how against the Google grain it might
seem. Even if you’re a veteran Googler who never needs research assistance,
knowing your way around Google Answers (if only its directory archive of
previously posted queries) can be invaluable. And if you’re a budding
researcher with no interest in paying someone else, this chapter shows you
how you can sharpen your skills by observing Google Answers in action.

Creating an Account and Logging In
This section establishes how you create a Google Answers account. Creating
an account allows you to participate in one free aspect of Google Answers:
posting comments to questions. (Later in the chapter, I offer guidelines for
this type of participation.) Creating the account does not obligate you to pay
a research fee or post a question. In fact, there’s no need to provide credit
card information until you post your first question, at which point you’re
prompted for it.
A Google Answers account is different from a Gmail account, but if you
have Gmail, your username and password can be used for Google Answers.
(Gmail is Google’s Webmail service; check out Chapter 14.) However, it
doesn’t work the other way around: having a Google Answers account does
not open a Gmail account. Google’s account system is a little confusing —
or more than a little. But the need for multiple accounts is understandable
when you consider that payment information is required in some but not
others. Hence, Gmail (which is free) uses a different account structure
from Google Answers, AdWords, and AdSense, all of which involve financial
transactions.
Anyway, if you want to ask a question in Google Answers, you need a Google
Answers account. You don’t need an account to browse the Answers data-
base. The account ID enables you to post a comment to somebody’s question
and be recognized by the system. Then, when you’re ready, you can add pay-
ment information to your account and post your own question.
If you have Gmail, just go to the Google Answers home page (see Figure 10-1)
and click the Create a Google Account link. Google Answers is located here:
answers.google.com
Depending on your computer’s cookies, Google might recognize you and
place your Gmail address on the screen; if so, simply enter your password
and click the Sign In button. On the next page you select your account nick-
name (which identifies you whenever you post a contribution or question),
and select whether you want e-mailed notifications of responses to your
questions. You also must agree to a Terms of Service document. The state-
ment includes warranty information, details on how your account is billed,
the refund policy, a lot of disclaimers about the nonprofessional nature of
the service’s financial and medical information, and a declaration that,
should you become stupider by using Google Answers, Google will not
supply you with smart drugs.
176
Part III: Specialty Searching 

Note: You may use a non-Gmail e-mail address to establish a Google
Answers account, even if you have a Gmail address. If Google recognizes
your Gmail address and puts it in the sign-in box, click the If you are not
you@gmailaddress.com, click here link to start fresh.
If you don’t have a Gmail account, create a Google Answers account by going
to this page address:
https://www.google.com/accounts
On the Google Accounts page, click the Create an account now link, and
follow the instructions.
Creating a Google Answers account does not authorize Google to collect fees
from you. Google does not require your credit card information to establish
the account. However, you can’t post a question (see the following section)
without providing payment information.
Note: Whenever your Google Answers nickname appears on the screen, the
following hyphenated suffix is attached to it: -ga. So if your chosen nickname
is mynickname, your onscreen nickname is mynickname-ga. This alteration
identifies you in the Google Answers portion of your Google Account, which
covers a few different services.

Chapter 10: The Professional Rescue Team at Google Answers

Posting and Canceling Questions
Posting a question to Google Answers is simple enough, but never free. For
putting a question in play, the minimum charges are
 A $0.50 listing fee
 A fee between $2.00 and $200.00, determined by you and paid to the
researcher
So the least you can pay to get a question on the board is $2.50. The listing
fee is credited to Google at the time of posting. The researcher’s fee is
charged when an expert answers your question — no answer, no payment.
Your credit card is charged on a schedule determined by your balance and
the time of month. If you run up listing fees and researchers’ fees come due of
$25.00 or more, your credit card is hit for the full amount. If your due balance
stays under $25.00, Google collects the dough once a month. Remember,
researchers’ fees come due not when you ask a question, but when you get
an answer.
When you created your Google Answers account you did not provide credit
card information or any other way for Google to bill you. Google Answers fees
are always paid by credit card. You can’t post a question without providing
that information. There’s no point in providing it before you want to ask a
question, so the following steps assume that you’ve sat down at the com-
puter, opened up your browser, and want to post your first question to
Google Answers.
1. Go to the main Google Answers page at answers.google.com.
2. Click the Log in or Create a Google Account link.
This step is not necessary if you’re already logged in to your Google
account (for example, if you used Gmail during the current browser
sessions and didn’t sign out).
3. Log in to your Google account with your e-mail address and password.
4. On your account page, click the Ask a Question link, located at the top
right.
You can also begin setting up your payment information by clicking the
My Profile link. But proceeding directly to Ask a Question takes you
through the credit card process, too.
5. On the Ask a Question page (see Figure 10-2), fill in the Subject,
Question, and Price fields, and select a Category.
178
Part III: Specialty Searching 

This seems a lot like work, doesn’t it? It’s worth it. For more about how to
fill in these fields and maximize your chances of getting the answer you
need at the price you want to pay, see the next section of this chapter.
6. Click the Continue to payment information button.
You might be asked to enter your Google Account password again. No
need to include the -ga suffix.
7. On the Google Answers: Enter Payment page, fill in your credit card
and billing information.
8. Click the Pay listing fee and post question button.
If you click this button, the listing fee of 50 cents immediately becomes
collectible by Google. You may also use the Go back and edit question
button to reword your query or set a different price. The preview post-
ing of your question as currently worded and priced is displayed below
the buttons.
That’s it — your question is immediately posted. Click the View your question
link on the confirmation page to see what you did. Figure 10-3 shows a posted
question. Note that the time of posting and the expiration date are both listed.
Questions remain posted, unanswered, for one month. Answered questions
remain in the Google Answers directory permanently.

Chapter 10: The Professional Rescue Team at Google Answers

The View Question page contains enough features to warrant a closer look:
 You might see sponsored links on your View Question page (see
Figure 10-3). Other Googlers see them, too. Google’s AdWords program
(see Chapter 17) positions these paid links throughout the service, not
just on the search results page, where they are prevalent.
 Use the Edit Question Parameters button to adjust the wording of your
question or the price you’re offering for an answer. You may continue to
tweak your words and price until the moment a Google researcher
claims the question. Once claimed, the question is locked in place, and
you may not make changes to it.
 Use the Clarify Question button to add information to your question that
would help a researcher better answer it. You can do so at any time.
 Use the Close Question button if you change your mind and no longer
want to receive a paid-for answer. On the following page, simply click the
Yes, Close Question button. Or if you’re truly indecisive and now want to
keep your question alive, click the No, Keep Question button. If you
close the question, it remains posted, but researchers can’t claim it. And
although you don’t have to pay for an answer, you do still owe Google 50
cents for posting the question in the first place.

 Below your posted question is space for the answer (which, when it
comes in, is as publicly viewable as your question) and space below that
for comments from other Googlers. You don’t pay for comments from
the peanut gallery.
You may post as many questions as you like. Manage your questions, billing
profile, and invoice information on your Google Answers account page, which
is available through the My Account link on every Google Answers page.
A fair amount of dialogue can ensue between the person who posted a ques-
tion and the researcher(s). In some cases, a second researcher joins the
party. Researchers may seek to clarify questions, just as users may seek to
clarify answers, so more than one researcher might be attempting to clarify a
question before one of them finally claims and answers it.
Figure 10-4 illustrates a posted question with a researcher’s request for clari-
fication, followed by the questioner’s clarification.
Farther down the page (see Figure 10-5), the expert asks for further clarifica-
tion, and answers the question while doing so. The questioner acknowledges
that the expert has “nailed it.”

Still farther down the page (see Figure 10-6), the researcher repeats the
answer in the proper space and includes an explanation of the research. The
questioner rewards the high-quality work with a substantial tip. Tips are
encouraged and frequently seen, but they are not required.
Note: Questions with relatively high monetary bids ($20 and over) are likely
to generate the most interest among researchers, naturally enough. I have
notices also that those high payers tend to be generous with tips, also. You
can see all bid prices listed with questions in the Google Answers directory,
as shown in Figure 10-7.

Locked questions
A posted question is locked when a researcher
has claimed it and is working on the answer.
The lock remains in place for two hours, during
which time a small padlock icon appears next
to the question in the Answers directory. If the
researcher doesn’t post an answer after two
hours, the question reverts to open status.
Locked questions do not prohibit comments,
though, so if you have something worthwhile to
contribute to a posted and locked question, go
for it. Just click the question, and then click the
Add a Comment button to display a form in
which you type your comment. More on this
later in the chapter.

Chapter 10: The Professional Rescue Team at Google Answers

If only this tip were about tips. That would be so clever and hilarious. Never
mind. What I do want to recommend is this: Browse Google Answers for
research techniques. Most experts divulge their research paths when answer-
ing questions, and reading through the answers is like taking a crash course
in online research. To be sure, these experts sometimes use specialized tools
that aren’t easily available to most people. But much of their work takes
place right within Google’s various engines.
Comments and Conversations
A lot of clarifying goes on in Google Answers, both before and after a
researcher gets hold of your question. The system is devised to encourage
conversation and cooperation between user and researcher. It’s not Jeopardy!
Flexibility is built in to the system to increase the chance of satisfaction on
both sides. Because of the conversational nature of the Google Answers
system, combined with the eagerness to share knowledge shown by Google
researchers and other users browsing posted questions, you can often find
the information you want (or some of it) without getting a formal answer to
your posted question.
Anybody can add a comment to a posted question, and the authors of added
comments are not identified as researchers or regular users. The result is an
information milieu in which everyone is sharing what they know. The trick is
to distinguish between good information and bad information — an issue that
can be universally applied to the Internet. Many Google Answers comments,
and nearly all official answers, are documented with links to research sites,
which helps establish their authenticity.
Figure 10-8 shows an open question followed by two comments that effec-
tively answer the question. The figure isn’t large enough to reveal that, in
fact, four comments were posted to the question, which still doesn’t have an
official answer. The question is a scientific one and apparently easy to
answer. The offered payment was low, discouraging any researcher from
claiming it before others jumped in. The comments appear to answer the
question; it is often the case that interesting questions get answered quickly,
and free of charge, before experts become involved.
Your question might be answered by comments, without an official
researcher’s answer. This development is somewhat rare in the case of spe-
cific, data-oriented questions, which researchers jump on with dizzying
speed. But it’s not so uncommon when a question requires deep research,
has multiple answers, or is priced low.
184
Part III: Specialty Searching 

If you’re satisfied with the posted comments your question has attracted and
no longer need an official answer, feel free to close the question by following
these steps:
1. Click the My Account link on any Google Answers page.
2. Click the link to your question.
You might have more than one posted question. Use the drop-down
menu to narrow your list, if necessary, by choosing Questions Awaiting
Answers.
3. On your question’s page, click the Close Question button.
The page reloads with a confirmation notice at the top, asking whether
you’re sure that you want to close the question.
4. Click the Yes, Close Question button.
After closing a question, that question appears on your Google Answers
account page, with CLOSED in the Status column (see Figure 10-9).

Chapter 10: The Professional Rescue Team at Google Answers

All the back-and-forth discussion following a posted question can make Google
Answers seem almost like a message board. Almost. The conversations are
not threaded as a message board is, meaning you can’t see at a glance who is
responding to whom in Google Answers. However, the similarity to message
boards brings up an interesting point: If you can get good information from
informal comments in Google Answers, maybe you can likewise get questions
answered on message boards elsewhere. That, in fact, is partly what Usenet
newsgroups are all about, and Google provides a Web interface to Usenet news-
groups. Chapter 6 dives in to Google Groups in excruciating detail. The point
here is that, in general, informal knowledge sharing on the Internet can be as
good as paid expertise and can be found in many venues.
The great values of Google Answers are these:
 Speed: Google staffs the Answers section with hundreds of researchers,
each waiting to pounce on a question and claim its payment. Most ques-
tions, unless they are hopelessly obscure, start drawing information
within hours — sometimes minutes.
 Accuracy: Google Answers pops into my mind when I have an extremely
detailed question. Surfing the Answers directory, you can see that such
questions receive hard work and good results from researchers, who
seem to enjoy sinking their teeth into a sharply defined information
challenge.
Figure 10-9:

186
Part III: Specialty Searching 

Newsgroups can also be fast and accurate, but they yield a more slapdash
experience, replete with conversational sideshows and a generally impatient
and grumpy attitude. Google Answers is a cleaned-up, more polite, and far
more literate arena for extracting information than Usenet newsgroups.
You get what you pay for, I suppose, with the bonus that sometimes Google
Answers does its best work for nothing more than the 50-cent listing fee.
Clarifying Questions and
Evaluating Answers
You can interact with the Google Answers service on three levels:
 Waiting for an answer: You’ve posted a question and await a
researcher’s answer.
 Received an answer: You’ve posted a question, and a researcher
answered it.
 No question: You’re browsing questions posted by others.
Each level offers options, covered in this section.
Clarifying and modifying a question
Previously in this chapter, I described how to formulate and post a question.
Doing so is the first of four options available to the Answers user requesting
expertise:
 Ask: Posting a question is always the first step.
 Modify: You may change the title, category, or pricing of your question
while it’s still in open status. Click the question title on your account
page, and then use the Edit Question Parameters button.
 Clarify: You may adjust your question while it’s still in open status. Click
the question title on your account page, and then use the Clarify
Question button.
 Comment: You may respond to comments posted to your question, as
long as the question’s status remains open. Click the question title on
your account page, and then click the Add a Comment button. This
button appears only after somebody comments on your question.
187
Chapter 10: The Professional Rescue Team at Google Answers

Fine-tuning and rating answers
When you receive an answer to a posted question, your have four options:
 Request clarification: If an answer isn’t satisfactory, you may request
further work from the researcher. Use this option with great discretion!
Its purpose is not to squeeze out more information than you originally
asked for. If your question was unclear, you can acknowledge such and
ask for a bit more writing from your expert. Likewise, if the answer is
unclear, you have every right to ask for a clarification. Click the question
title on your account page, and then use the Request Answer
Clarification button.
 Rate the answer: Usually, the final step in the conversation between you
and the researcher is to rate the answer. For some reason, most people
don’t feel motivated to assign a rating other than five stars. If you’re
unsatisfied with the answer, the best approach is to request clarification.
But no matter how you feel at the end, you’re free to rate the experience
you paid for. Click the question title on your account page, and then
click the Rate Answer button.
 Tip your expert: You might feel that an exceptional answer deserves
more than you originally agreed to pay. A tipping system is built in to
Google Answers. Tip amounts can be between $1 and $100. The money

Refunds and repostings
In the rare event that a Google Answers expert
lets you down completely, your recourse is to
apply for a price refund. You have two options,
actually:
 Apply for a refund. Getting a refund closes
the question to all further activity, including
comments.
 Apply for a credit for the amount of your
expert payment, plus a reposting of the
question. Getting the credit automatically
reposts the question for research by a dif-
ferent expert. The second 50-cent listing fee
is waived.
Both options are included in one online form.
You must go to this page:
http://answers.google.com/

If you don’t want to copy that long URL, find the
link by clicking the Answers FAQ link, which is
listed at the bottom of every Answers page.
Choose the Repost My Question or Request a
Refund radio button, and explain why you think
either option should happen. You need to include
the question ID, which is located on the question’s
page, not on your account page. (Figure 10-8
shows a question ID, in the upper-right corner.)

is charged to the same credit card you have on file in your Answers
account. Click the question title on your account page, click the Rate
Answer button, and then fill in the amount of your optional tip. Click the
Submit Rating button to post your rating and authorize your tip. Both
the rating and the tip amount are publicly viewable.
 Request reposting or a refund: For the truly disgruntled user, requesting
a refund is the last resort. You may issue the complaint and be finished
with it, or you may ask for a price credit and also for your question to be
reposted as a new, open question.
The tip is optional. Even though it’s bundled onto the rating page, do not feel
pressured to issue a tip with your rating — they are different, independent
options.
Adding a comment
When cruising through Google Answers as an interested observer, with no
open questions of your own, you may participate by posting comments to the
queries of others. You can join the conversation on both open and closed ques-
tions, whether they have been answered by a researcher or not. Everyone in
Google Answers is of equal status when it comes to posting comments. Simply
click the title of any question, and then click the Add a Comment button.
It might sound obvious, but don’t add a comment unless you have something
worthwhile — and germane — to say. This isn’t a message board in the Net-
culture sense, so don’t indulge in “Me too!” posts or in merely expressing
your interest in the question at hand. Contribute information that helps
answer the question, clarifies the subject, or somehow increases knowledge
for everyone reading, especially the person who posted the question.
Good Questions at the Right Prices
The best way to maximize your Google Answers experience is to ask the right
question, at the right price. Asking a difficult, multipart question and offering
$2 for its answer might not attract the best — or any — researchers. Offering
$30 for the answer to a simple question will create a researcher feeding
frenzy but leave you feeling ripped off. Additionally, posting an unclear ques-
tion (even though it can be corrected with the Clarify feature) is liable to gen-
erate timewasting clarifying conversations, perhaps leading to the researcher
feeling ripped off or you feeling obligated to tip heavily.

First off, certain types of question head straight into a dead end because of
Google’s legal restrictions. In some cases Google will even delete the question
from public view. So keep in mind the following:
 Don’t place any personal contact information in your question. Don’t
ask researchers to phone you or e-mail you privately. Google Answers is
an open forum. While you’re at it, avoid putting up anyone else’s contact
information, too. I have seen researchers answer questions in part by
providing phone numbers or addresses. But for regular users, the only
contact information permissible is the Google Answers user ID name.
 Don’t ask for help doing something questionably legal or outright ille-
gal. For example, requesting assistance in making unauthorized music
downloads would probably get your question removed or at least incite
warning comments from researchers.
 Don’t spam. If you try to use the Google Answers space to promote your
Internet business or sell products, you’ll get bumped off for sure.
 Don’t get X-rated. References to porn, and especially links to it, are over
the line.
 Don’t cheat on your tests. Google Answers encourages student use
while doing homework, but getting a researcher to answer a test ques-
tion is against the rules. The two uses are separated by a fine line, to be
sure, and questions stay or go at Google’s discretion.
Questions spawn related questions all too easily. Asking multipart questions
isn’t against the rules, but you should know what you’re doing. Don’t ramble
on with every query that enters your head. Be aware, too, that you’re essen-
tially bidding for a researcher’s time, and the more complex your questions,
the more money you should offer. Researchers are generous, and chances are
good that you’ll get a bit more than you asked for in a simple query.
If you want to hit several points of a query subject, try breaking the subject
apart and posting a few low-priced queries. This clarifies your needs to the
researchers, and gives them a chance to focus on specific questions rather
than grapple with a bundle of them. It doesn’t hurt, too, to spell out explicitly
the parameters of the answer you need. Include what you already know, and
explain what you need to know.
The Google Answers directory is a virtual laboratory of questions, comments,
and answers, in which you can discover what works and what doesn’t. Surf
the directory by following these steps:

1. Go to the Google Answers home page.
To do so, click the Google Answers Home link on any Answers page or
use the Google Toolbar (see Chapter 9).
2. Scroll down the page to see the Answers directory topics.
3. Click any subject category.
You can also click a link under Recently answered questions.
4. On the category page (see Figure 10-10), click a subcategory, and then
click a question.
The right columns show the date and price of each question.
You can discover a lot just by glancing down a main category page. Many
question titles are explanatory; the price is right there in the far-right
column, and you can see the Comment and Answer traffic each question has
attracted. Click a few questions, too, to see how researchers handle various
types of questions. You might be amazed at the detail and depth of the
answers. Notice the star-rated answers — most ratings are five stars, signify-
ing an extremely successful transaction between seeker and expert (and also
signifying a customer who took the time to apply a rating). Asking a good
question is half that equation.

Chapter 10: The Professional Rescue Team at Google Answers

Creating a descriptive heading for your question and placing the query in an
appropriate category are both as important as the phrasing of the question.
As I write this, an open query requests information about activity in Saudi
Arabia immediately following the 9/11 terrorist attacks and is vaguely titled
“current events.” After a day, no answers or comments were attached to the
question. When creating the query title, don’t worry about crafting a good
sentence. You can even word the title as if it were a Google search string.
(While you’re at it, you might want to try Googling your query in the Web
index before posting to Google Answers.) Do whatever it takes to convey
the subject of your query precisely.
Putting your money where your query is
Setting your own price for the Google Answers service might seem awkward,
and it’s best to avoid the temptation to bottom-line your every query.
Likewise, don’t pay too much for simple questions because you’re reluctant
to appear cheap. Google recommends estimating how long it will take to
research your question and then pricing it accordingly. This advice, although
relevant to the researchers, is nearly pointless to regular users who aren’t
information experts and can’t anticipate the type of research needed. A
better bet is to gauge, roughly, how demanding your question is based on two
factors:
 Speed: Do you have a deadline or are you just impatient? Then attract-
ing a quick answer has more value to you.
 Complexity: If your query contains more than one part or more than
three sentences, chances are you’re requesting more than $2 of expertise.
If you have plenty of time, one pricing strategy is to start at the bottom and
work your way up. Post a $2 question and see what it brings in. Interested
users post comments regardless of price, because they’re not getting paid.
If your $2 post doesn’t get the attention you want, raise the stakes to $5,
and so on.
The overwhelming majority of questions are priced at $20 or less. Browse
through the directory (see the preceding section, “Good questions = good
answers”) to get a feel for the type of questions being answered at certain
price points.

G
oogle is a brainy company, and its many Ph.D. employees are always
conceiving new ideas. Google itself — the main Web index and search
algorithms — was a college experiment turned corporate, in the finest tradi-
tion of Internet entrepreneurism. Many of Google’s now-standard features
began as tentative experiments that survived testing and arrived on the home
page. At this writing, Google News — one of Google’s anchor services — is still
a beta product, meaning that it’s still officially in the testing phase. Same with
Froogle. (Both seem to work pretty darn well to me.)
Some of Google’s newest brainstorms get piled into Google Labs, an open
testing area that any user can play with. You enter this area at your own risk,
but honestly, the risk is minimal. In most cases, all that can really go wrong is
that something you try won’t work as advertised, and even that is rare. All
the Google variants described in this chapter except one (Google Compute)
operate on Google’s computers, not yours. You interface with them through
your browser, just like regular Googling.
When I wrote Google For Dummies, Google did not promote Google Labs
experiments, and the entire Labs area lurked in the shadows. More recently,
Google has been forthcoming about its Labs projects, and new Labs launches

often receive lots of publicity. Because of the attention now shone on all
Google projects, Labs experiments cross less of a dividing line when “gradu-
ating” from Google Labs. I mention this because some of the major features
of this book — such as Google Maps, My Search History, and Site-Flavored
Google Search — are still (as of this writing) Google Labs experiments. Yet I
treat them as if they were fully mature products, and indeed, they operate as
such. This chapter covers Labs projects that have not found a place else-
where in the book.
Be sure to check the Google Labs page at the following URL from time to time
to see if anything’s new:
labs.google.com
Keyword Suggestions
Many considerations go into determining the perfect keyword string. Frequent-
ly, tapping into the greatest number of results is not the goal — and, in fact, can
be detrimental to finding the best results. But when searching a topic with
which you are not familiar, suggestions based on a large set of results can be
useful. That’s the idea behind Google Suggest, an interactive keyword sugges-
tion tool that responds to every character you type in the keyword box.
Google Suggest is easy to try and requires no setup. Just go to the Google
Suggest site here:
www.google.com/webhp?complete=1&hl=en
That URL is a drag to copy; you can also go to Google Labs and click Google
Suggest.
Figure 11-1 shows Google Suggest in action. Each letter that you type alters
the drop-down list of ten suggestions. Use the up and down arrow keys to
select one of the suggestions. That’s really all there is to it. Useful? I haven’t
found many reasons to return to Google Suggest. But I’d like to see this tool
bundled into Google Local (see Chapter 8), where it could come in handy
completing names of businesses. Until then, Google Suggest is a mere novelty.
Google Suggest works with recent browsers only — they include Internet
Explorer 6 or later, Netscape 7.1 or later, and Firefox 0.8 or later.

Standing on the Shoulders of Giants
Isaac Newton’s famous admonition to “Stand on the shoulders of giants” is
the catchphrase of Google Scholar, a search engine that purports to uncover
scholarly resources off the commercial Web. Google Scholar is Google’s first
stab into the hidden Web — the enormous untapped virtual library of books
and academic resources that remains untouched by the Web. Google Print,
which seeks to digitize books in major institutional libraries, is another effort
in a similar direction. But whereas Google Print is a digitizing project whose
results will eventually be incorporated into the main Google index, Google
Scholar crawls resources that are already digitized and gathers them in a sep-
arate index. That index is located here:
scholar.google.com
Searching for previously unavailable material sounds more exciting than it
actually is. The unfortunate fly in the ointment is that academic and scholarly
resources are still mostly unavailable, hidden behind subscription services,
academic firewalls, and password protections. Google Scholar reveals locations
but often cannot reveal actual documents. This is one Google Labs project that
is mostly theoretical.
Figure 11-1:

Suggest

195
Chapter 11: Experimenting in Google Labs

But all is not lost. For one thing, searching in Google Scholar does sometimes
bring up entire documents, especially when using the filetype operator (see
Chapter 2) to find PDF files. Using filetype:pdf yields different — but not nec-
essarily better — results in Google Scholar than in the Web index.
Google Scholar works best for those who have access to the type of elec-
tronic resources available through a university library, such as JSTOR (a
database of academic journals), or access to the physical shelves of a univer-
sity library. In that case, Google Scholar can help identify and locate authors
and titles relevant to a research project. In particular, the lists of citations
provided by Google are convenient. Figure 11-2 shows a Scholar results page.
Note that each result contains a Cited by link, which leads to a list of books
and papers that refer to the search result. Each citation contains its own list
of citations. Following these leads reveals, in typical Google fashion, a living
network of scholarly resources surrounding a topic.
Google Scholar rewards persistence. Try many searches and click through
many search results. I have found wonderful, full-text results amidst the many
protected abstracts that typically populate the search results.

Part III: Specialty Searching 

Video without the Video
Google Video is one of the most curious Labs projects. Launched as a beta-
testing feature in January 2005, it was perceived by many (including myself)
to be a response to Yahoo! Video. Yahoo! Video searches for video files stored
on the Internet. Google Video, inexplicably, does not have any videos in its
index. This dedicated engine searches for closed-caption transcripts of TV
shows.
Why, you might ask, is a TV-transcript search engine called Google Video? If
only I had the answer. The service is not without its uses, but it is definitely
misnamed. However, it might eventually live up to its name. At this writing,
Google is soliciting homemade videos from all comers. Google is attempting
to assemble a massive index of authorized video content, which would
remove the service from the danger of copyright infringement, a danger that
Yahoo! courts with its video engine. I don’t see where TV transcripts fit in,
but I can envision a fun and useful index of uploaded video from amateurs,
semi-pros, and professionals.
Google’s video uploading page is here:
https://upload.video.google.com
Anyway, let’s get to Google Video as it currently operates. The feature is
located here:
video.google.com
Enter a keyword, and off you go. Figure 11-3 shows search results for the key-
word letterman. Each result is a TV show on a certain date; the match is of
your keyword to some portion of a show’s transcript. Click any result to see a
detailed log of those mentions, as shown in Figure 11-4. Each reference is
given in context, surrounded by about a paragraph of closed-caption tran-
script. Although still shots are provided, there is no video in the search
results as of this writing.
You can’t be blamed if you think this is pretty lame. The real problem, as
mentioned before, is the feature’s name: Google Video. I admit that Google
Closed-Caption Transcripts doesn’t have a ring to it, but nobody forced
Google to come up with this strange service. As a research tool, however,
Google Video isn’t all that strange. Students who want to cite television news
programs, for example, can find their quotes more easily and accurately in
Google Video than by any other means.

Part III: Specialty Searching 

A new twist to Google Video was introduced in April 2005, a few months after
the closed-caption site was launched. Switching direction, the added service
invites video producers of all stripes — amateur, professional, and everything
in between — to upload their videos to Google Video for inclusion in a big,
searchable index. There is even a mechanism in place for assigning a price
for your video, if you think somebody would be willing to pay for a shaky
look at your cat playing with string. Or perhaps you have a more refined
product. Whatever; it is come one, come all. The upload page with instruc-
tions is located here:
hupload.video.google.com
Real-Time Rides
After viciously dissing Google Video in the preceding section, I’m glad to
bubble with enthusiasm over Google Ride Finder, which uses Google Maps to
help you find a nearby taxi. Working with taxi companies in selected cities,
Google tracks the movements of individual cabs in eleven cities (at this writ-
ing; more cities on the way) and places their locations on Google Maps. (See
Chapter 8 for more on the wonderful Google Maps.)
Google Ride Finder is easy to use; get started here:
labs.google.com/ridefinder
On the front page (see Figure 11-5) you see a map of the entire country with a
few pins stuck in it. Don’t do anything on this map — those pins aren’t useful.
Either click a city to the right of the map or enter a street address (in one of
the selected cities) in the keyword box.
Clicking Houston, TX, brings up the map shown in Figure 11-6. That zoomed-
out map doesn’t help much in locating cabs, so use the map slider to zoom
in. Figure 11-7 shows a detailed view of a Houston neighborhood; each col-
ored pin represents a taxi on the move. You cannot immediately see that they
are on the move; use the Update Vehicle Locations button below the map to
track the movement of taxi.
So, here’s the question about Google Ride Finder: Is it useful or merely cool? I
can imagine a brainy Google engineer developing this thing after some diffi-
culty getting a ride. But knowing where a cab is driving doesn’t necessarily
get you into that cab. Listing the phone numbers of taxi companies might be
the most useful part of Ride Finder. But there is something undeniably fun, in
a geekish way, in peering down into the taxi traffic of a city.

When you want to update a map to see cab movement, do not use your
browser’s Refresh (or Reload) button. Doing so reloads the entire Google
Ride Finder site, and throws you back to the zoomed-out view of the United
StatesInstead, use the Update Vehicle Locations button below the map.
Building Google Sets
A peculiar experiment in creating related keywords, Google Sets is marginally
fun and occasionally useful. I can imagine the appeal of this idea to Google
researchers because it turns the tables on most search enhancements.
Usually, Google Labs is occupied with improving search results. Google Sets
concentrates on using the Google index to enhance keyword selection.
Google Sets is easier to try than to describe. You can try it here:
labs.google.com/sets
Figure 11-8 shows the Google Sets page, which contains five keyword boxes.
Type a word or a phrase into at least one box. Then press Enter, or click the
Large Set and Small Set button. The results (see Figure 11-9) consist of other,
related keywords. Click any keyword result to conduct a Google Web search
on that keyword.

Part III: Specialty Searching 

Frankly, Google Sets has limited appeal to most daily Google addicts. I know a
few writers and journalists who use Sets as a sort of research tool to increase
their awareness of key concepts related to an assignment topic. In that way,
Sets could be a homework helper, too. But honestly, it’s a stretch to imagine
Google Sets fitting into most people’s lives. As one bewildered user posted to
the Google Sets bulletin board, “Who is using Google Sets?”
Actually, there are uses for Google Sets. For one, you can use Sets as a rough
sort of thesaurus: Type a word, select Large Set, and see what synonyms pop
up. Anyone who has a limited English vocabulary might find this use espe-
cially rewarding. Google Sets also works well with brand names — type one
car manufacturer, for example, and get a list of others.
You might also try Google Sets as a sort of esoteric recommendation engine
with a mind of its own. Because Sets accepts phrases, try typing one or two
movie titles and see whether it recommends others. The results lead to exer-
cises in six degrees of separation, as you try to figure out how Google con-
nected the disparate titles in the resulting set. A request for a set built on
Remains of the Day and Silence of the Lambs, two Anthony Hopkins films,
returned Fargo, Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, Goodfellas, and The Shawshank
Redemption. (By the way, if you haven’t seen Shawshank, rent it soon.) It
might be difficult to connect the dots between all those movies, but what’s
not fun about lists of movies? Try the same thing with books and music.
The Mythical Internet Library
Comes to Life
Way back in Chapter 1, I discuss the fabled idea of the Internet Library, which
was often suggested as a rationale for the very young World Wide Web. It was
thought that in time, the Internet would make libraries obsolete. The truth is
that online academic resources have changed the function of university
libraries in some ways, to the great troublement of those campus administra-
tors. But to regular folks — consumers — the Internet has not begun to replace
libraries and has certainly not become an alternative venue for reading books.
Just now, that state of affairs is starting to change, and Google Print is behind
the change. Google Print is an ambitious initiative to digitize enormous
libraries of books, both scholarly and not-so-scholarly. Google is aiming to
scan every book in the New York Public Library, the libraries of Harvard
University and Oxford University, and many others. Google Print has two
branches: Google Print for Publishers (which approaches publishers individ-
ually to gain licensing rights to scan their books) and Google Print for
Libraries (which takes a broader approach and gives publishers a way to opt
out of the whole-library scan).
203
Chapter 11: Experimenting in Google Labs

Google Print is still in its nascent stages; the enormous project will take a
long time to complete, if it is ever completed. But partial as it is, a dedicated
Google Print engine exists to service your book-oriented queries, and it is
located here:
print.google.com
Enter any keyword or keyword string and click the Search Print button. Your
search results probably look a lot like Figure 11-10 but with different books
appearing on the left side of the page. Click any book title or thumbnail cover
image to see results for that individual book.
Figure 11-11 shows the results page for an individual book after I searched for
a phrase within that book: key signatures. I entered that phrase in the Search
within this book keyword box. The result of that search is a list of pages, by
page number, that contain those keywords.
There’s one more step before you actually read within the book, and that is
to click a page number. Doing so displays a page of the book, with your
“Search within the book” keywords highlighted in yellow on the page. (See
Figure 11-12.) Note the arrows above the page; clicking them allows you to
browse two pages in either direction from your search results page.

Chapter 11: Experimenting in Google Labs

You can continue searching within the book and clicking other search results
pages in the book, but two things happen eventually:
 Google requests that you sign in to your Google account if you are
not signed in already. After signing in, you can continue searching
and browsing book pages. (If you don’t have a Google account, go to
www.google.com/accounts.)
 Google prevents you from viewing any more pages in the currently
displayed book. How many pages you get varies; Google has different
copyright agreements with different publishers. I have read as many as
fifty pages before being shut down. When Google lowers the boom, you
are free to conduct another search and browse through another book.
Google Print is fun to use and a valuable research tool, small though the
available library is at present. The catalog of available books is growing all
the time, and the service promises to get better and more useful.
Horrors! A New Home Page!
In May 2005, the unfathomable happened: Google changed its home page.
But the change is optional, and you get to decide whether to see a new home
page or the traditional one. The new home page can be personalized to your
taste. If you ignore this new feature, nothing changes; Google does not force
any screen clutter upon you.
This new feature doesn’t have a name, oddly. The personalization of the
home page is part of an initiative called Fusion. Presumably, other products
will come into the Fusion portfolio; the personalized home page is the first.
The idea behind Fusion is to tie together Google’s many disparate services.
Comparisons to Yahoo!’s personalization feature, called My Yahoo!, are
inevitable — and unflattering to Google so far. (Google suffers by comparison
at this writing, but perhaps will have made the features more robust by the
time you read this.) My Yahoo! benefits not only from Yahoo!’s much larger
platform of features and services, but also from Yahoo!’s more flexible and
up-to-date customization of news from a huge number of sources. Google
News allows personalization, as I describe in Chapter 5, but very few news
sources are available in the home-page personalization as of this writing.
That will change — probably at about the time this book is published.
Start at the beginning: right on Google’s home page. Figure 11-13 shows the
home page as somebody with a Google account sees it when signed in to that
account. For the remainder of this section, I will call this view Classic Home,
as Google does. If you don’t have a free Google account, go here to start one:
www.google.com/accounts
206
Part III: Specialty Searching 

Note the Personalized Home link in the upper-right corner of Figure 11-13.
(Also note the My Search History link, referring to a service covered in the
next section.) If you click Personalized Home, a similar home page is dis-
played, with a big Further personalize your home page link on it. Click that
link to see Figure 11-14. At the time of this writing, twelve blocks of informa-
tion were offered; clicking any check box assigns that information block to
your Personalized Home and, as shown in the figure, offers a bit of additional
customization in some cases. Your information options are limited. This page
will doubtless change as the service evolves.
After checking boxes, click the Save Personalization button. Doing so returns
you to your Personalized Home view, as shown in Figure 11-15. Quite a
change from the chaste classic view, isn’t it? It’s almost shocking to see
Google’s home page in this state, but I must say that Google does a good job
keeping everything looking clean and fairly uncluttered. No advertisements
pollute the Googly goodness of the page.
Want to make changes to your Personalized Home view? Scroll the page down
to the Further personalize your home page link and edit away. When you’re
finished, click the Save Personalization button.

Keeping a Record of Your Searches
Google’s relatively new service, My Search History, was introduced in May
2005, partly in response to search-history tools offered at some other search
engines. My Search History works behind the scenes, often without you being
aware of it. You need a Google account to use this feature. If you don’t have
an account, go here to create one:
www.google.com/accounts
When you have an account and have signed in with that account to a Google
service (for example Gmail, Google Groups, the personalized home page, or
Google Print), My Search History keeps track of your queries and your click-
throughs to result pages. Google does this without you needing to turn it on.
Being signed in to your account is the only on switch.
It is important to understand the meaning of Google’s automatic tracking of
searches. I have placed a rare Warning icon next to this paragraph to drive
home its importance. If you use a shared computer, you might not want to
publicize the content of your searches. Many people couldn’t care less; for
them, searching is utilitarian and not especially personal. But it’s easy to
imagine many innocent scenarios in which a person wouldn’t want his or her
searches divulged to another. Imagine a husband searching Google for an
anniversary present for his wife. My Search History makes it uncomfortably
easy for his wife to view those searches and the results her husband clicked.
Because of the preceding warning, I want to explain how to turn off My
Search History, before showing what it looks like. You can avoid having your
searches tracked in four ways:
 Do not create a Google account if you don’t have one already. This solu-
tion is drastic and prevents you from posting in Google Groups, personal-
izing the home page, browsing at length in Google Print, and using Gmail.
 Make sure you are signed out of your Google account when you conduct
private searches. (Use the Sign out link on the home page.) This solution
is inconvenient and prone to failure. Most Google users have become
accustomed to searching quickly, without fussing over settings. The
speed bump caused by this extra step, and the likelihood of forgetting to
do it, is chiefly what recommends the next solution.
 If you have an account, click the My Account link on the home page
when you are signed in, and then click the Delete My Search History link.
The irreversible nature of this action recommends the final solution.
209
Chapter 11: Experimenting in Google Labs

 You can pause My Search History by clicking the My Search History
link on the home page, and then clicking the Pause link. The feature
remains inactive until you choose the Resume link that takes the place
of the Pause link.
When you use My Search History, Google keeps track of your queries and
clickthroughs, and organizes the list by date. Figure 11-16 illustrates the
historical list of searches; note the calendar on the right that invites you to
click a day to see that day’s searches. 
Clicking the Remove items link puts check boxes next to each item on the list
so you can select which to delete from view.

Putting Google 
to Work

In this part . . .
L
ike a supportive parent, Google is there when you
need it but wants you to soar on your own.
You might think of Google as the ultimate search engine.
You go to it, you humbly feed it your keywords, you heed
its magisterial declamations, and you surf where it bids
you. We live online lives guided, influenced, even deter-
mined by Google. All this is true and good. Yet Google
stands ready to serve no less than it commands. The
Google Toolbar is a loyal information butler that never
strays from our side. Likewise, the Deskbar and Google
Browser buttons. These hand servants are explained in
Chapter 12.
Chapter 13 introduces Google Desktop Search, a relatively
new service that allows you to apply Google’s powerful
indexing and retrieving technology to your computer’s
hard drive. Desktop Search is local search with a new
meaning, and Google Desktop can solve the shambles into
which your computing life has disintegrated. (No offense.)
Chapter 14 exposes Gmail as the landmark e-mail system
that it is. You have to think a little differently about how
mail is organized and presented to feel comfortable in
Gmail, but the slight effort is worth it. Chapter 15 is all
about putting Google on your site, if you have one.
The chapters in this part encourage you to build a deeper
relationship with Google. It is almost a marriage, really:
constant companionship, cooperative prosperity, and a
partnered relationship with the larger community.
Prepare to have your horizons widened and your world-
view expanded. You’re going far afield in this part, from
e-mail to your own hard drive. The atmosphere is heady
with innovation, and you are a pioneer in the Googlesphere.

f Google is your most important online destination, launching your searches
from the Google.com home page can be a nuisance. Even if Google isn’t the
most frequently visited page in your Internet life, it would be convenient to
have a gateway to Google lurking by your side at all times. There are two such
gateways:
 Google Toolbar
 Google Deskbar
Google Toolbar clamps onto your browser with an always-ready search box
and many other features. It’s a fairly complete Google bag of tricks that fol-
lows you around the Web.
Google Deskbar is even more independent, attaching itself to the Windows
taskbar with a search box and easy gateways to many of Google’s distinct
engines. Deskbar doesn’t need a browser, even to display search results — it
uses its own pop-up window to furnish a complete search experience, includ-
ing clicking through to target sites.
I can hardly overstate the importance of these two free products. They stream-
line the Google lifestyle tremendously. Of the two, I prefer the Toolbar for its
range of features and seamless performance. The Deskbar operates a little 
sluggishly, even on my fastest computer. But I do like its browser-independent
nature. The upshot? I run them both constantly. In so doing, I’ve noticed that
I use the Toolbar for deep searches that are likely to result in lots of mouse
clicks. I incline toward the Deskbar when I think the search will be a hit-and-run
affair, perhaps using Google Q&A features that don’t require any clicks to get
the information I want. (See Chapter 3 for a rundown of Google Q&A.)

Note: This chapter covers the Google Deskbar as an independent product, and
it is. But the Deskbar is also bundled into Google Desktop, a separate product
that indexes and searches your computer’s hard drive (see Chapter 13). It
doesn’t matter how you acquire Deskbar; the two packages (independent and
bundled with Desktop) are identical.
Installing the Google Toolbar
If you’re not (yet) using Google Toolbar, you must begin immediately. I mean
it. I’m not cutting any slack on this point. It will change your life. It will con-
solidate awesome information power that’s only a click away at all times. It
will both deepen and streamline your relationship to Google.
Google Toolbar is built for the Internet Explorer browser, versions 5.0 and
later. If you use the Firefox browser, Google has no toolbar product for you,
but don’t be discouraged — I cover your options later.
Figure 12-1 shows the Google Toolbar installed, ready for action. The keyword
box is evident, over to the left. There’s much more to the Toolbar than a
portable keyword box, though. This following section describes installing
the Toolbar; the section after that explains its many options.

Part IV: Putting Google to Work 

The Toolbar installation process is almost completely automated. You just click
your way through a few buttons before Google takes over. Follow these steps:
1. Go to this page:
toolbar.google.com
2. From the drop-down menu, scroll down and select a language.
3. Click the Download Google Toolbar button.
A dialog box pops up, enabling you to choose a location for the file
you’re about to download.
4. Select a location on your hard drive, and then click the Save button.
The Toolbar installer downloads to your computer and is stored in your
selected location. You need to double-click the file after it downloads, so
don’t forget where you put it.
5. Double-click the downloaded file (probably called
GoogleToolbarInstaller.exe).
The installer pops open a new window on your screen.
6. Click the Agree & Continue button.
You are agreeing to a Terms and Conditions document presented at
the bottom of the window. The legalese specifies that Google owns the
Toolbar, that Google is not responsible if it blows up your computer
(it won’t), and that you can’t try to make money from the Toolbar (for
example, by charging admission to watch you Google with it, which
sounds a little disgusting). Other options can be set in this window
before clicking the button. Select a national version of Google as your
default engine if you are not in America, or if you prefer a non-English
language. The check box to make Google the default search engine in
Internet Explorer does not affect Toolbar functions; it enables you to
launch a Google search from the browser’s Address bar. It doesn’t really
matter whether or not you uncheck this box; the purpose of the Toolbar
is to initiate a Google search. Finally, the installer asks to close Explorer
windows as part of the installation but gives you the choice of closing
them yourself. I always let the installer do it.
7. Use the radio buttons to choose whether or not you accept the Toolbar
features that require sending your surfing information to Google, and
then.
The information sent to Google is anonymous; it is not connected to you
personally. I enable these features, but many people prefer to not com-
municate their surfing destinations to Google, even anonymously, and
choose Disable advanced features. You will not see the PageRank indica-
tor if you disable the features at this point.
215
Chapter 12: Lifelines: Googling from Anywhere

8. Click the Finish button.
Google Toolbar bolts onto your browser, and Internet Explorer opens.
Figure 12-1 shows the Toolbar with the advanced features, which refer to
the PageRank display and its corresponding tracking of the browser’s
movements on the Web. All browsers using this feature of the Google
Toolbar contribute to PageRank by telling Google what sites are visited.
You’re ready to go. Try a search immediately by typing a keyword in the key-
word box of the toolbar and pressing Enter. It’s that easy. At first, search results
appear in the current browser window, even if your Google Preferences are set
to open a new window, as I suggest in Chapter 2. The following section shows
you how to make that same setting for the Toolbar.
The appearance of your Google Toolbar might not correspond to Figure 12-1,
depending on your settings, browser, and screen resolution. The next section
reviews your configurable options.
Choosing Toolbar Options
Google offers a great deal of configurability in the Toolbar. To see your
choices, click the Google logo at the left side of the Toolbar, and then click
the Options selection. The Toolbar Options dialog box pops up on the screen,
as shown in Figure 12-2. Note that this dialog box provides three tabs —
Browsing, Search, and More — each filled with choices.
Figure 12-2:

216
Part IV: Putting Google to Work 

Navigation and productivity options
The first tab in the Toolbar Options dialog box, called Browsing, presents two
groups of personalization features. The first group relates to navigation:
 Address bar browse by name: This navigation feature encourages you
to type company names, brand names, or Web site names into the
browser’s Address bar. If Google divines where it is you want to go, it
takes you directly there. If something about what you type is ambiguous,
Google runs a search.
 Popup blocker: The pop-up blocker prevents free-floating ads from
sprouting atop and behind your browser. In certain conditions, this
blocker doesn’t touch the ads streamed directly to the desktop in
Windows XP, as I explain more fully later. The feature does block ads
associated with Web sites.
 PageRank display: For those interested in the ranking of Web sites in
the Google index, the PageRank display is essential. In fact, the Toolbar
provides the only glimpse of PageRank offered by Google — and it is
only a glimpse. A glimpsed approximation, actually. PageRank is a com-
plex measurement, and the simple PageRank display is (as they say in
car ads) for comparative purposes only.
The next group of options in the Browsing tab relates to productivity:
 SpellCheck: Now, this is handy. The built-in spell-checker (it’s the ABC
check button) corrects typing mistakes in Web site forms. This feature
might not help if you mistype your address, but it has great application
in Weblog comment forms.
 WordTranslator: You point to English words on a Web page with your
mouse and receive a translation to the language of your choice. The fea-
ture was not enabled in Google Toolbar at the time of this writing.
 AutoFill: This feature works identically in Toolbar 3.0 as in Toolbar 2.0
(see the preceding section).
 AutoLink: This is a controversial one. Google uses AutoLink to change
certain text on Web sites into links. For example, if the toolbar detects
an address on a Web page, AutoLink turns that address into a link to
Google Maps, which, if the new link were clicked, would display a map of
the address. Many Google pundits were up in arms when AutoLink was
introduced because it dared to change the content of a Web site (turning
unlinked text into linked text). Google doesn’t own the Web sites you
visit, so this feature can easily be deemed intrusive. AutoLink must be
enabled manually; the button appears on the Toolbar by default, but you
must click it to activate the feature on any Web page. At the time of this
writing, Google was under pressure to remove AutoLink.
217
Chapter 12: Lifelines: Googling from Anywhere

Search options
Under the Search tab of the Options panel, you can select half-dozen toolbar
behavior characteristics when searching, and also select which search but-
tons appear on the toolbar:
 Open a new window to display results each time you search: I always
keep this option checked. It leaves my original browser window anchored
at its current site, while displaying Google search results in a fresh
window.
 Drop-down search history: Select this option to see previous searches
beginning with the same letters you type in the search box. Clicking the
downward-pointing arrow next to the search box drops down a list of all
previous searches. Normally, this search history is erased when you
shut down the browser. But the next option saves your searches even if
the browser is shut down or crashes.
 Save the search history across browser sessions: Check this box to pre-
vent your search history, described above, from being erased when you
close Internet Explorer. (You can always clear the search history manu-
ally by selecting Clear Search History under the toolbar’s Google
button.)
 Automatically search when you select from the search history: This
option is great for recurring searches. Selecting this option forces
Google into action when you select a previous search from the drop-
down search history list, without the need to press Enter or click the
Search Web button.
 Remember last search type: Select this option to make your search
choices persist from one search to the next. Select which Google engine
to search using the drop-down Search menu to the right of the keyword
box. If you use the Toolbar to run an Images search, for example, the
Toolbar will default to the Images index in future searches until you
make a new choice.
 Use Google as my default search engine in Internet Explorer: Didn’t
you deal with this selection during installation? Yes, you did. The option
persists now. Checking this box enables you to launch a Google Web
search from the browser’s Address bar.
The remaining options in the Search tab offer five search buttons that can be
placed on the Toolbar. Three of the buttons correspond to Google engines:
Images, Groups, and Froogle. Another is the famous I’m Feeling Lucky button,
which takes your browser directly to the top search results before displaying
the results. The Search Site button is extremely useful: It matches your key-
word against the contents of the site currently displayed in your browser.
218
Part IV: Putting Google to Work 

More options
The final tab in the Options panel is the More tab. Most of these options
place buttons on the toolbar:
 Highlight button: This dynamic and extremely helpful button highlights
your keywords, each in a different color, on any Web page displayed
since your last Toolbar search.
 Word-find buttons: This feature places a button on the Toolbar for each
of your keywords. (The buttons appear after you launch the search, not
as you type the words.) If you have your options set to deliver search
results in a new window, the word-find buttons follow you to the new
window. Furthermore, they stay with you when you click search results,
even if your Google Preferences cause yet another window to be opened.
It’s when you’re at a search results site (not the search results page) that
the word-find buttons become useful. Click any one of them to make a
highlight bar jump from one instance of that keyword on the page to the
next. These buttons should be used with the Highlight button, which
accents all instances of all keywords. (Honestly, the Highlight button is
the more useful of the two. But word-find buttons are great, too, if only
to remind you what your keywords are.)
 BlogThis!: This button is for users of Blogger.com, Google’s recently
acquired Weblog service. Clicking the BlogThis! button enables users to
post an entry to their Weblog that automatically refers to the Web page
currently displayed.
 News button: Simple and indispensable, the News button surfs you
directly to Google News, the essential current events portal of today’s
Internet.
 Up button: Cryptically named, this button keeps track of the layers you
travel through a Web site and stands ready to jettison you back up to
the home page or to an intermediary page. Click the small triangle next
to the Up button to display a list of higher levels in the site. Click one of
the list items to begin moving toward the surface.
 Next and previous buttons: These arrow-shaped buttons swing into
action when you leave the search results page to visit a result page.
After poking around a bit, you can click the next button to surf directly
to the next hit on the search results list, without backtracking to the
search results page. Of course, if your Google Preferences are set to
open a new window when clicking a search result, you always leave one
browser window anchored on the search results page, making the next
and previous buttons superfluous.
219
Chapter 12: Lifelines: Googling from Anywhere

 Voting buttons: when these buttons are on the toolbar, click the smiling
or frowning face to vote for or against a page — even a Google search
results page. Google compiles these votes and . . . does something with
them. At this writing, nobody outside the company knows what. Call me
cynical, but I’m waiting to see what votes get me before exercising my
Googly democratic right.
 Options: This selection places the Options button on the toolbar,
making it easy to invoke the Options panel.
 Page Info button: The Page Info menu button offers the cached (stored)
version of the current page, similar pages, backward links to the current
page, and a translation of the current page into your default language.
These same options are in the right-click menu.
The final options allow you to select whether the toolbar buttons are identified
with full text labels, shorter text labels, or remain unidentified by text labels.
Using AutoFill
If you register at as many sites and shop online as much as I do, filling out
online forms is a tedious hassle. The AutoFill function in Toolbar 3.0 invites
you to fill in your crucial information just once, and then let the Toolbar
handle any forms you encounter.
Use the AutoFill Settings button in the Browsing tab of the Options panel to
enter your information, as shown in Figure 12-3. You may add your name,
e-mail address, phone number, two mailing addresses, and one credit card.
(AutoFill would become much more useful if it accepted multiple credit
cards.) Credit card information is protected by a password — and remember,
all Toolbar information, including AutoFill, is stored on your computer, not on
an Internet computer.
Conveniently, the Toolbar highlights the portions of an online form that it’s
capable of filling in. You may proceed to fill them in manually if you choose or
just click the AutoFill button on the Toolbar to complete those fields all at
once. AutoFill never fills in username and password fields, which can change
from site to site. Not so conveniently, AutoFill takes the extra step of telling
you what it’s about to do, instead of just doing it. That confirmation window
gives you a chance to review your information in a concise format, but it also
gets annoying after a while.
220
Part IV: Putting Google to Work 

The toolbar pop-up blocker
Like many toolbars these days, Google’s includes a pop-up ad blocker that
creates a less commercial Web site experience. After you add the pop-up
blocker to the Toolbar (you can remove and add it at will through the
Toolbar Options dialog box), the blocker destroys pop-up browser advertise-
ments before they hit your screen, makes a proud little noise for each
blocked ad, and keeps track of the total number of killed pop-ups.
If you want to allow pop-ups from a certain site, simply click the Pop-up
Blocker button after you arrive at that site. Google reloads the page, this time
allowing the ads to pop up. The button changes appearance to notify you
that pop-ups are enabled for that site and keeps track of your selection. Any
time you return to that site, pop-ups are allowed, and the button tells you so.
The liberation of pop-ups pertains to the entire site. When you surf away
from the liberated site, the button reverts to its original appearance, and ads
are blocked as normal.
Note: Google’s pop-up blocker does not block pop-up browser windows
launched by any spyware and adware that might be infecting your computer.
It can be difficult to distinguish pop-ups launched by the Web site you’re
Figure 12-3:

tions,

221
Chapter 12: Lifelines: Googling from Anywhere

visiting from pop-ups launched by hidden software buried deep in your com-
puter. If you’re tormented by pop-ups while running Google Toolbar with the
Pop-up Blocker, it’s a good indication that your machine is hosting spyware
that tracks your movements around the Web and flashes ads based on your
site visits. Run a Google search for spyware solutions and adware solutions;
several free and inexpensive programs help clean infected computers.
Googling in the Firefox Browser
Firefox users are shut out of the pure Google Toolbar experience. But the
Mozilla Foundation, which develops Firefox, has built a Google toolbar called
the Googlebar. The Googlebar is sanctioned by Google and can be down-
loaded here:
googlebar.mozdev.org
The Googlebar (shown in Figure 12-4) contains most of the basic features of
the Google Toolbar, plus some original ones. For example, a direct link to
Gmail is incorporated in the Firefox toolbar.
Figure 12-4:
The
Googlebar, a
Google-
sanctioned
alternate

222
Part IV: Putting Google to Work 

Firefox users have much more control than IE users over certain features
such as highlight colors and keyboard control of the Googlebar’s functions.
However, the PageRank display, one of the most important features to some
users of the IE toolbar, is missing. Some Webmasters say that the PageRank
display is the only feature of the Internet Explorer experience that keeps
them tied to that browser.
Searching from the Desktop
with the Deskbar
The Google Deskbar offers a scaled-down version of the Google Toolbar that
is free of the browser. The Deskbar does not contain the toolbar’s more
exotic features such as PageRank display, pop-up blocking, spell checking,
AutoFill, and AutoLink. But the Deskbar does accomplish basic searching and
display of search results without opening a browser (if it’s closed) or disturb-
ing its current display (if it’s open).
Go here to get the free Google Deskbar:
deskbar.google.com
Figure 12-5 shows the Deskbar quietly lurking in the Windows taskbar, where
it lives. The Deskbar sits to the right of your program tabs and to the left of
the system tray. Using the Deskbar is simple enough; type a keyword into the
search box and press Enter. The Deskbar mini-viewer pops up to display
search results (see Figure 12-6). The mini-viewer operates similarly to a
browser window, but it’s not Internet Explorer, Firefox, Netscape, or any
other browser.
Clicking a search result in the mini-viewer displays the target page in the
mini-viewer, unless you determine in the Toolbar Options that a browser
window should be opened to display target pages. To see the Toolbar
Options dialog box, click the small arrow next to the Deskbar, and then click
the Options selection.
Alt+Shift+G puts your mouse cursor in the Deskbar search box. Pressing that
combination and then typing a search query is an unbeatable, streamlined,
quick way to launch a Google search.

Reclaiming Your Lost Stuff:
Google Desktop to the Rescue
In This Chapter
 Understanding desktop search
 Downloading and installing Google Desktop
 Using and personalizing Google Desktop
I
n 2004 momentum was building in the search industry for a push into two
frontiers: local search and desktop search. Google’s impressive innova-
tions in the former are covered in Chapter 8. The desktop searching frontier
presented unexplored territory for Google, but it was no less urgent that the
company release a product enabling users to Google their own hard drives.
Microsoft was planning such a thing for its next version of Windows. Smaller
search companies had already launched impressive desktop products. In
October 2004, Google announced the availability of Google Desktop Search.
Google Desktop is deliberately integrated with Google Web searches, but it
can also be used independently. This chapter explains the dual nature of the
product and steps you through downloading and installing it. You might
notice that many of the screen illustrations in this book showing Google
search results reveal Google Desktop Search results from my computer above
the Web results. Those results come from the Google Desktop program
installed on my computer, which places relevant results from my hard drive
atop relevant search results from the Internet.
That slick integration is one of the selling points of Google Desktop, but it
also points to the ever-present nature of the program. When Google Desktop
is installed and running, it is always lurking and working, indexing the contents
of your computer and waiting for opportunities to contribute to your Web
searches. This constant vigilance and participation in your online searches
makes Google Desktop an awkward program for use on shared computers. It
should never be used on public computers; do not download it at a library, for
example. (Most public computers do not allow installations of new software.)
At home, use Google Desktop only on computers that harbor no secrets.

The In(dex) and Out(put)
of Desktop Searching
Do not confuse Google Desktop with Google Deskbar. The Deskbar (described
in Chapter 12) conducts online searches from the desktop. Google Desktop
conducts computer searches from the desktop. Both programs reside in the
Windows taskbar. The search term desktop, referring to finding content on
the computer’s hard drive, is an odd one. Application programs of all types
operate on the computer desktop. Understand that Google Desktop doesn’t
search the desktop; it searches the entire hard drive.
There are five stages in the operation of Google Desktop:
1. Download and install the program.
2. Allow the program to index the contents of your hard drive.
3. Run the program while you go about your normal computing life.
4. Activate the Google Desktop window when you want to launch a search
of your hard drive.
5. Allow the program to contribute computer content to your Google Web
searches.
The only speed bump in your use of Google Desktop occurs when the program
indexes your hard drive. The process is not unlike Google’s index-building
crawl of the Web (see Chapter 16). If you have a large hard drive with plenty
of files, Google crunches through the process in bits and pieces during idle
computer time. The indexing does not interfere with your work or play on
the computer, but it might be several hours before you can effectively use
Google Desktop. The program becomes fully functional when the indexing is
complete. You can conduct a search before the indexing is complete; Google
Desktop provides results from its partial index.
The ideal use of Google Desktop allows it to run continuously, all the time.
(However, it’s easy to pause its operation at any time.) Desktop watches the
computer hard drive and incorporates new files into the index. Those files
could be things that you create, such a business letter written in a word-
processing program, or things that you download, such as e-mail stored
on the computer through programs like Outlook Express. Those files could
also be online material that you access and that are placed in your computer
invisibly, such as Web pages cached by your browser. Google Desktop’s ambi-
tion (though it is not fully realized) is to match your search keyword to any
piece of digital content captured by your computer.
Searching with Desktop involves clicking its icon, which opens a window that
looks rather like Google’s home page. This gets a little confusing — are you
online or offline? That’s exactly the boundary that Desktop hopes to erase.
226
Part IV: Putting Google to Work 

Google wants you to think of the online and offline realms of your computer
as an undivided landscape of content. Google will help you find anything in
that landscape.
Anyway, when starting a search in that activated Desktop window, the pro-
gram explicitly searches your hard drive and returns results only from the
hard drive. It is when you search the Web (using the Google site, the Google
Toolbar, or the Google Deskbar) that hard-drive results get mixed with Web
results.
What Google Can and Can’t Find
in Your Computer
Most likely, Google Desktop can’t index every single file on your hard drive.
At the time of this writing, the Desktop’s original (and fairly limited) functions
had been expanded to include the recognition of many basic, common types
of computer content. These file types include the following:
 Text files
 E-mail accessed with Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Outlook Express,
Netscape Mail, and Mozilla Thunderbird
 Cached browser pages viewed in Microsoft Internet Explorer, Netscape,
and Firefox
 Microsoft Office files created in Word, Excel, and PowerPoint
 IM chat transcripts recorded in AOL Instant Messenger
 Adobe Acrobat files (PDF files)
 Standard music-file formats, including MP3, WAV, OGG, and WMA
 Standard image formats, including JPG and GIF
 Standard video formats, including MPG and AVI
In addition to file recognitions built in to Desktop by Google, independent
developers are permitted and encouraged to create plug-ins that add function-
ality to the program. Many Desktop plug-ins add obscure features that the
developers personally need; they create the enhancement mostly for them-
selves and then give it to Google as an afterthought. But others are excellent
additions with broad appeal. One such plug-in adds several graphic file for-
mats omitted in the original Desktop. Another replaces the entire Desktop
interface with a more flexible one. The universe of plug-ins is growing quickly
and getting more impressive; the development in this area reminds me of the
alternate Google interfaces I describe in Chapters 19 and 20.
227
Chapter 13: Reclaiming Your Lost Stuff: Google Desktop to the Rescue

After you install Google Desktop (which I cover in the next section), you can
survey the available plug-ins here:
desktop.google.com/plugins.html
Downloading and Installing
Google Desktop
Google Desktop is free and is easy to download and install. Start by going to
the Desktop page:
desktop.google.com
Then follow these steps:
1. Click the Agree and Download button.
If you’re one in a million, you will first read the Terms and Conditions doc-
ument. This legal harangue is much like the terms and conditions
attached to the Google Toolbar. The most important point to most
people relates to privacy. Google Desktop has the ability to collect non-
personal information about your computer use and give that information
to Google. You can opt out of this function during installation.
2. Download the setup file, which is probably named
GoogleDesktopSetup.exe or something similar.
3. Double-click the downloaded file.
The installation procedure begins automatically. In most cases, the
installation program requests permission to shut down some applica-
tions. Save any work in progress before agreeing. After Google Desktop
is installed, the program opens your default browser to an Initial
Preferences page.
4. On the Initial Preferences page, choose your options.
At the time of this writing, four initial options were presented:
• Searching AOL Instant Messenger chat transcripts
• Searching secure pages viewed in your browser
• Displaying a Google Desktop search box on the taskbar or floating
on the desktop
• Sending usage data to Google
228
Part IV: Putting Google to Work 

When setting initial preferences, think over the first two. Allowing
Google Desktop to index AOL chat transcripts and secure Web pages
could reveal personal information (such as online bank statements) to
anyone using your installation of Google Desktop. That person wouldn’t
have to search for online bank statements or compromising chats; a
search keyword would merely have to match any word in a bank state-
ment or chat transcript.
Note that in the third preference, the search box (on the taskbar or float-
ing on the desktop) is distinct from the Google Deskbar; if you run
Deskbar already, you’ll end up with two search boxes (see Figure 13-1).
That last preference is the controversial feature I mentioned earlier; now
is your first chance to opt out if it makes you uncomfortable.
5. Click the Set Preferences and Continue button.
Initial indexing of your computer begins now.
6. Click the Go to the Desktop Search homepage button.
This is the page that opens whenever you double-click the Desktop icon.
Right now, it indicates the progress of the initial indexing, which could
take hours in big, file-laden computers. Figure 13-1 shows this page.
Figure 13-1:

229
Chapter 13: Reclaiming Your Lost Stuff: Google Desktop to the Rescue

Once installed, Google Desktop reveals its presence with a swirly icon in the
system tray of the Windows taskbar (shown in Figure 13-1). If you selected a
search box on the Initial Preferences page, that too announces the presence
of Google Desktop.
The Google Desktop search box (on the taskbar or floating on the desktop)
conducts both Web searches and hard-drive searches. For many people, that
makes the Google Deskbar irrelevant. However, the Deskbar can launch a
Google search into the Images index, Froogle, Google News, Google Groups,
and other autonomous Google engines. The Deskbar is more of an online-
search agent than Google Desktop. I run them both. I also run the Google
Toolbar.
Daily Use of Google Desktop
Google Desktop Search is thoroughly integrated with the Google experience.
You can initiate a hard-drive search in three ways. Each is no more than one
click away from extending that search to the Web:
 Type keywords into the Google Desktop search bar (on the taskbar or
floating on the desktop, if you enabled it), and then press Enter. Doing so
takes your browser to Google, where the results of a Web search are dis-
played with Desktop results above them. (You must be online.) You can
also configure the Desktop search box to search only your hard drive;
click the small arrow next to the search box and select Search Desktop.
 Double-click the Google Desktop icon in the system tray of the taskbar.
Doing so displays a Google Desktop search page that looks pretty much
like the Google.com home page, except for the slightly different Desktop
logo (see Figure 13-2). However, you’re not viewing an online page at this
point; the page is manufactured by Google Desktop, not taken from
Google servers. Note that your keywords can be applied to a Web
search, or Images, or Froogle, or any of the main Google indexes.
 Go to the Google.com home page, type your keywords, and click the
Desktop link. This might be the coolest integration of all. Google knows
that you’re a Desktop user and serves up a different version of the
Google home page that accommodates your potential need to search
your hard drive.
The result of this integration is confusion over whether you’re online or
offline: exactly what Google wants. Increasingly, residential computers stay
online all the time, connected to high-speed Internet links. To Google, which
once meant to search the Internet, now means to search an unbounded realm
that encompasses the Internet and your personal computer.

Personalizing Google Desktop
To change your Google Desktop preferences, right-click the Desktop icon in
the system tray and choose Preferences. A page like the one in Figure 13-3
opens in your browser (the page is actually stored on your computer). On
this page, you can select and unselect file types to be indexed.
One of the most interesting options is the Don’t Search These Items box,
where you type local file paths and Internet domains, the content of which
will be avoided by Google Desktop. You can set up a folder on your hard
drive for storing files that you don’t want appearing in Desktop search
results; then type the path to the folder in the Preferences page. Click the
Save Preferences button when you’re finished.
Also on this page, you can decouple the tight integration of Desktop results
and Google Web results. To do so, uncheck the box next to Google
Integration.

Giving it a rest
At any time while running Google Desktop, you can pause its relentless index-
ing. If you’re going to encounter online material that you don’t want indexed,
or you know you’re getting mail that you don’t want crawled, simply pause
Desktop. Right-click the system tray icon and choose Pause Indexing. Doing
so creates a fifteen-minute rest period. You can repeat the process (choosing
Pause for fifteen more minutes). When you’re ready to resume indexing, right-
click and choose Resume Indexing.

G
oogle introduced Gmail on April 1, 2004, and at first many people
thought it was a joke. The service was difficult to verify because it
wasn’t opened to a public beta-testing period as most other new Google serv-
ices are. Gmail was (and remains, at this writing) an invitation-only service.
But it was for real, and it was immediately apparent on April 1, 2004, that
Google had accomplished a significant reinvention of Web-based e-mail.
It’s important to be clear on the distinction between Web-based e-mail (often
called Webmail) and e-mail viewed through a non-browser program such as
Outlook Express. Webmail is presented within a Web browser, and you must
be online to read the mail. By contrast, you can read mail in Outlook Express
while offline — though you have to go online to get the mail. That last point
illustrates another key difference. Outlook Express (and other stand-alone
e-mail readers) downloads the mail from its temporary storage location on a
Web server. Webmail keeps the mail permanently on the server, allowing you
access to that server for reading, sorting, and replying.

Why Webmail, and Why Gmail?
Two other popular Webmail services are Yahoo! Mail and Hotmail. (AOL users
have something similar to Webmail inside the AOL program.) The three pillars
of the Webmail movement — Gmail, Yahoo! Mail, and Hotmail — make the
case for using a Web-based service instead of (or in addition to) using a stand-
alone mail program to access your ISP’s e-mail service. The main advantages
of using Webmail are these:
 You can access your account and read your mail from any Internet-
connected computer in the world.
 Webmail offers a single, consolidated e-mail location for people who 
routinely use multiple computers.
 Your mail is immune to crashes or breakdowns of your computer.
Countering those advantages are the disadvantages of Webmail:
 The display of Webmail messages is slower than in stand-alone pro-
grams accessing downloaded mail that resides in your computer.
 Webmail features are generally not as powerful as features in stand-
alone programs.
 Webmail does not offer as much storage as a typical computer hard drive.
 Webmail services put advertisements on your e-mail pages.
That’s a lot of disadvantages. Yet, Webmail is extraordinarily popular. One
reason, besides the compelling nature of its advantages, is that you don’t
need an Internet account to use Webmail. Basic Webmail is free. You must be
willing to do your computing in public places such as libraries, and that
might explain why so many library screens display Webmail in progress.
(Walk around with an eagle eye at any large library to see what I mean.)
Google has introduced innovations that make Gmail especially attractive. I’ve
dabbled in many Webmail systems, but Gmail is the only one that has earned
any degree of loyalty in my Internet life. My Gmail account is not my primary
e-mail location, but it’s a strong secondary inbox. I move some types of mail
into the Gmail environment exclusively. In particular, I find e-mail discussion
lists work especially well in Gmail’s conversational format. (More on that con-
versational format later.) Also, the easy searchability of stored e-mail (this is
Google, after all) convinced me to move much of my business correspondence
to Gmail as well.
234
Part IV: Putting Google to Work 

The three broad, compelling features of Gmail are storage (there’s a lot of it),
display (the conversational format I keep promising to describe), and search-
ing. Combine these features with the inherent advantages of Webmail, and
Gmail becomes a service that hard-core Internet lifestylers must take seri-
ously as a long-term e-mail solution.
Gmail Availability
I’ve written this chapter with the assumption that by the time you read it, or
soon thereafter, or at some point before humanity is destroyed by rampaging
turtles, Gmail will be an open service available to all comers. At this writing,
Gmail exists as an invitation-only Webmail platform while the service is
undergoing testing.
235
Chapter 14: Saved by a Thread: Reinventing E-mail with Gmail
Elbow room for your e-mail
When Gmail was introduced, its most startling
aspect was the amount of available mail stor-
age. Each Gmail account came with 1 gigabyte
(1000 megabytes) of storage. Typical Webmail
services at that time furnished somewhere
between 5 and 100 megabytes. Google’s propo-
sition was unprecedented, and it rattled the
industry. Other services, notably Yahoo! Mail
and Microsoft’s Hotmail, scrambled to catch 
up — not only to provide comparable storage
but to emulate Gmail’s fast page displays and
generally slick performance. But massive
upgrades can’t be accomplished overnight, and
Yahoo! and Microsoft fell behind their own
promises. When they finally began to draw
close to Gmail’s features, Google threw in
another gigabyte.
That second gigabyte demolished any notion of
parity in the Webmail business, at least in the
storage department. Google didn’t stop with the
second gigabtye; it announced that every Gmail
account’s capacity would gradually increase
over time like a rising thermometer. Indeed, as I
write this, my Gmail capacity stands at 2174
megabytes, and it inches up every day. I have
187 megabytes of stored mail, equaling 9 per-
cent of today’s capacity. Google’s intent is clear:
to make storage issues irrelevant. Neither of the
other major Webmail providers have dared
match this pioneering value. Google is propos-
ing that you adopt Gmail for life, and is seems to
promise that you’ll never run out of room.
Of course, 2-plus gigabytes of storage is a small
chunk of digital real estate by the standards of
modern computers, with hard drives holding
hundreds of gigabytes. But 2 gigs is huge in the
context of Webmail, which is both free and
immune to hard-drive crashes and other home-
computing problems. Indeed, people use Gmail
as an archive location, forwarding files not
related to e-mail simply to protect them. Such
strategies were unthinkable when Webmail
could barely hold all of one’s mail.

Most Gmail account holders are given some number of invitations to distribute
as they choose. At the beginning, five invitations, at most, were given to any
single account. Believe it or not, an underground trading movement began,
with people all over the Internet offering to pay or trade for a Gmail invita-
tion. The number of invitations per account grew to fifty, and the frenzy to get
on the inside died down. While it lasted, that intense seller’s market (actually
selling a Gmail invitation is forbidden by Google) was great publicity for the
service. In fact, the entire method by which Gmail was launched — encourag-
ing the April 1 hoax rumors and frantic efforts to acquire accounts — seems
brilliantly sly in retrospect.
Most people who want to try Gmail have been able to locate an invitation by
this point, so I proceeded with this chapter with the thought that most readers
are already in or can find their way in — or, as I mentioned before, that Gmail
will be entirely public by the time this book gets into your quivering hands.
And if your hands are really quivering, dial back your coffee consumption.
One handy clearinghouse for free Gmail invitations is the isnoop Web site, at
this location:
www.isnoop.net/gmail
Volunteer donors have given away many thousands of invitations.
It’s All About Conversations
Although Gmail’s capacious storage received most of the launch publicity, in
my opinion that’s not really Gmail’s strongest feature. Gmail’s most original
innovation is the manner in which it strings together related e-mails. This fea-
ture lends a conversational feel to reading e-mail. Unlike other Webmail sys-
tems and typical mail interfaces, which throw each incoming letter into a
queue, one after another, Gmail keeps intact the natural connections between
responses. The result is that an incoming message, even if a month has
passed since you wrote the letter to which it responds, is tied to your original
outgoing letter and displayed with it. This display logic overcomes time,
making it seem as if the response arrived moments after your letter was sent.
Figure 14-1 illustrates the conversational display style at work. In this particu-
lar view, the conversation is collapsed: Each message preceding the last of
the string is compressed to a single line showing the sender and the first line
of the message. The dates show the time span during which this conversa-
tion transpired. The entire conversation takes on the appearance of a series
of folders in a file cabinet — to me, at least. My editor disagrees. Who are you
236
Part IV: Putting Google to Work 

going to believe, her or me? Well, it doesn’t matter what they look like, the
point is that collapsed messages concisely illustrate who has participated in
the conversation, and the message snippets sometimes effectively summa-
rize the discussion.
Click any collapsed message to expand it and read it. Gmail keeps track of
your reading history and presents read messages in collapsed mode and
unread messages in expanded mode. (The exception is the final message of
any conversation, which is always shown in full.) You can collapse any
expanded message and expand any collapsed message. Moreover, the
Expand all link — look to the right of the page — lets you expand the entire
conversation or, in reverse, collapse every message in the conversation.
237
Chapter 14: Saved by a Thread: Reinventing E-mail with Gmail
The advertising issue
On the right side of the page in Figure 14-1, note
the presence of advertisements (under
Sponsored Links) and other stuff (under Related
Pages). Those ads, just like the ones on search
results pages, come from the Google AdWords
program. Nearly all Webmail services place ads
on the page, so why did Google’s ads cause a
storm of controversy when Gmail was intro-
duced, and why are they still despised by some
people? The perceived problems result from the
way in which Google selects the ads, which is
identical to the way Google selects ads that
appear on the Web pages of AdSense pub-
lishers. (See Chapter 17 and 18 for more on
AdWords and AdSense.)
When you call up an e-mail to read, Google
crawls that e-mail, determines its context, and
places relevant ads (and related page links,
which are not sponsored) in the margin. To
some people, opening your mail to a Google
crawl is little different from allowing strangers
to read your mail. This attitude is fallacious 
on two counts. First, humans at Google do not
read your mail. Second, there is no such thing
as ironclad privacy with any e-mail service,
especially Webmail, in which all mail is stored
on the service company’s computers.
Another issue that troubles people, especially
people in business, is that Google places rele-
vant (and perhaps competing) content on mail.
Imagine you’re a lawyer writing to a client, and
that client uses Gmail. When the client reads
the lawyer’s letter, advertisements appear in the
margin — including, perhaps, an ad from a
competing law firm. Google is so adept at deter-
mining context and regionality that such a thing
is eminently possible. Fearing and resenting
such possibilities, a few people and firms refuse
to send mail to Gmail addresses. The Boycott
Gmail movement took on some steam in the
early days, but fizzled.
As for appearances, Google’s advertising style
is much easier on the eyes than flashing ban-
ners (look at Yahoo! Mail sometime). Unlike the
ads on Google search pages, which I often read
and click, I find that Gmail ads seem invisible 
to me. That’s not good news for advertisers, but
it makes the Gmail experience feel decidedly
noncommercial.

Gmail’s inbox display is shown in Figure 14-2. (Actually, the figure shows the
contents of the inbox as sorted by a label. More on labels in a bit.) The conver-
sational format is established in the inbox, before opening any conversations.
This format is quite different from many other e-mail systems, which list every
message as a distinct entity, unrelated to other messages. In Figure 14-2, the
number in parentheses in some of the headers indicates the number of mes-
sages in that conversation. Dark shading indicates that all messages in that
conversation have been viewed; if a new response comes in, the shading is
removed from that conversation, and it is moved to the top of the inbox. The
stars are activated with a single click, and make an easy way to highlight con-
versations (or single messages) that you want to find quickly again later. (Use
the Starred link to view all your starred messages.)
The check box next to each message, when checked, signals that you want to
take some action on that message (or conversation). Use the More Actions pull-
down menu to see what actions are available. They include moving the message
to another part of Gmail, marking a read message as unread (removing the shad-
ing), applying a label (I promise to cover labels soon), or moving the message to
the trash. Google discourages throwing out any mail. With so much storage at 
Figure 14-1:

sation.
238
Part IV: Putting Google to Work 

your disposal (so to speak), there is little reason to trash anything. I occasion-
ally do discard items, though, if I’m certain I’ll never want to look at them again.
Do not throw out spam, though; check the check box next to any piece of spam
that finds its way into your inbox and click the Report Spam button. Gmail files
away the information on that e-mail and removes it from your account.
Writing Mail
Enough about reading mail; put down your chips and write somebody a
letter. Click the Compose Mail link to see the page shown in Figure 14-3. As
you type a recipient’s address in the To field, Gmail searches your address
book and suggests possible recipients; use the arrow keys to scroll down that
suggested list. Gmail automatically adds the recipient’s address to your con-
tacts list (that’s what Gmail calls the address book) when you write some-
body. If you’re new to Gmail, you don’t have any contacts stored, and Gmail
will not suggest names as you type.

Chapter 14: Saved by a Thread: Reinventing E-mail with Gmail

The quickest way to build up your contacts list in Gmail is to import your
address book from another e-mail program you’ve been using for a while.
There are too many e-mail programs floating around, each with its own meth-
ods, to attempt a step-by-step explanation of how to do this. The main thing
to know is that Gmail accepts imported address books in the CSV format —
that’s the Comma Separated Values format. CSV is a database format that sep-
arates each entry with a comma. In your e-mail program, find the export fea-
ture, and choose CSV as the export format. The program will allow you to save
the address book in that format. Having saved it, follow these steps in Gmail:
1. Click the Contacts link.
2. Click the Import Contact link.
The Import Contacts window pops open.
3. Click the Browse button.
4. Find and select your saved CSV file, and then click the Open button.
5. Click the Import Contacts button.
In the Compose Mail window, you may use rich formatting to add color, alter-
nate typefaces, boldface, italics, underlines, bullets, and other style elements
to your outgoing mail. Keep in mind that not all e-mail programs interpret
rich formatting conventions in the same manner. This inconsistency has long
Figure 14-3:
Use this
page to
compose 
an e-mail.
240
Part IV: Putting Google to Work 

been a problem, especially with mail systems (such as AOL) that encourage
their users to gunk up . . . I mean, enhance their mail with extra formatting.
These systems are meant to work well when members mail each other, but
don’t always look pretty when mail leaves the system. So, have fun ruining . . .
I mean, distinguishing your mail with nontext formatting but be aware that
others could see a different result. (My bias against formatting comes from
nearly fifteen years as a text-only e-mail writer. E-mail historically is a text
medium, and incompatible platforms make nontext formatting problematic.
Now leave me alone and let me be a curmudgeon in peace.)
If you don’t have time to finish an e-mail, click the Save Draft button. Your
work-in-progress is stored in the Drafts folder. You can return to it later and
undo the horrible rich formatting. All right, that was uncalled for.
Sorting with Labels
In this section I finally discuss labels. Gmail labels are the primary sorting
device, and one of Gmail’s great innovations. Developed just as the tagging
frenzy of sites such as Flickr and Del.icio.us was gaining momentum, Gmail
labels work by tagging messages and conversations as a grouping mecha-
nism. Labels take some getting used to. Most people reach a point when a
light goes off (not literally; I’m being metaphorical), they yell “Eureka!” (no
they don’t; I’m exaggerating for effect), and then they kiss their monitors
(nobody does that; I’m just going for cheap laughs now).
Labels in Gmail take the place of folders in traditional e-mail and Webmail
programs. In Gmail, instead of dragging a message to a labeled folder, you tag
it with a label. Importantly, any message or conversation can be tagged with
multiple labels. Multifaceted tagging is what gives tagging sites their great
appeal; each tagged item is important in different ways and shows up on dif-
ferent lists depending on which tag is activated. In Gmail, your list of created
tags is displayed on every page. Click any label to see all message and con-
versations tagged with that label.
Another part of Gmail’s label system is that you can filter incoming mail by
label, if you can predict common elements of that incoming mail. This is one
reason discussion lists work so beautifully in Gmail. I belong to one high-
volume list called Pho, and although I read it every day, I don’t want its steady
stream of e-mail cluttering the main (which is to say, unlabeled) display of my
inbox. Since I know that every e-mail from that list contains the word Pho in the
subject line, I can tell Gmail to tag all such mail with the Pho label and imme-
diately archive it. That way, I don’t see any of it unless I click the Pho label.
Filtering incoming mail by label is so important a feature that I want to walk
through it in detail. It’s not hard! Follow these steps:
241
Chapter 14: Saved by a Thread: Reinventing E-mail with Gmail

1. Click the Create a filter link next to the keyword search box.
2. Fill in the criterion or criteria that will identify incoming messages to
be labeled.
You can specify a sender or a recipient. If the recipient is you, all mail
will be filtered, which is probably not your goal. Perhaps you frequently
receive mail copied to your partner and want to label it; identify that
incoming mail by typing your partner’s name or e-mail address. In this
example, I am using the Subject field to identify the Pho discussion list,
as shown in Figure 14-4.
3. Click the Next Step button.
4. On the next page, choose what should be done with identified incom-
ing mail.
I’m labeling identified mail and archiving it, as you can see in Figure 14-5.
You may also choose to automatically forward such mail, mark it with a
star, or throw it out.
5. Click the Create Filter button.
Now, identified mail will be immediately labeled and archived, and will
not appear in the unlabeled inbox.

Customizing Gmail
Gmail is not as powerful or flexible as desktop e-mail programs. That obser-
vation is not a criticism; the same is true of all Webmail. However, Gmail does
offer a few personalization features. Click the Settings link to see your
options. Figure 14-6 shows the general settings.
All the settings in the General tab are self-explanatory, but the keyboard
shortcuts deserve special mention. Google experimented with keyboard
shortcuts as a Web search feature but discontinued that particular Google
Labs experiment. Only a small band of loyal users developed around the
search shortcuts, but Gmail might tell a different story. People are in their
e-mail accounts so often, and for such long periods, that keyboard shortcuts
make life easier for those who dislike mouse movements. When you turn on
the shortcuts, you have a choice of using the mouse or the keyboard to navi-
gate Gmail.

One more feature to point out: POP access to your Gmail. POP, an acronym
for Post Office Protocol, is the technology that allows mail delivered to one
e-mail system to be accessed and read in another e-mail system. If you want
to download and read your Gmail in a desktop program such as Outlook
Express, you need to enable POP downloading in the forwarding and POP tab
of the Mail Settings page. Then you need to configure your e-mail program to
go get your Gmail. Each mail program differs in this process; you might need
to check the Help files of other documentation. Click the Configuration
instructions link for help with three popular e-mail programs.
If you’ve been using Gmail for a while and are storing a lot of mail, be certain
to choose Enable POP only for mail that arrives from now on. If you select the
other option (Enable POP for all mail), your mail program will reach into
Gmail and download everything.
You have another decision to make regarding POP access of Gmail, and that
is what to do with the mail after you download it. You download copies of 
the mail; it’s not like physical mail which is either here or there. Use the pull-
down menu in the Mail Settings under Forwarding and POP to choose whether
Gmail leaves downloaded mail in the Inbox, archives it (removes it from the
Inbox but preserves a copy), or deletes it.

In This Chapter
 Getting Google Free on your site
 Customizing Google Free
 Tailoring Google searches
G
enerously, Google allows site owners to put Google search boxes on
their sites, and many thousands of Webmasters do it. This gift of Google
is not sheer generosity, though; it results in greater traffic for the search
engine and more exposure to its advertising. Google doesn’t really care where
a search originates from: the Google home page, the Google Toolbar, the
Deskbar, or your site.
When you offer your visitors a Google search box for general Web searching,
you are inviting them to leave your site — that’s one drawback for some
people. However, that Google search box can be configured to search your
own site, not the Web at large. That way, even though Google gets your visi-
tors briefly when they view the search results page, you get them back if they
click through to a destination on your site.
You can place Google on your site in three ways:
 Google Free: Actually, all three methods are free; this plan is the original
one. It places a keyword box on your page(s), with the option of making
results specific to your site. That option is in the hands of your visitors.
You can’t make the search box exclusively about your site.
 Customizable Google Free: This option provides the same service as
basic Google Free but with tools to make the search results look more
like your pages. Google still serves the results; you can place your logo

at the top of the page and determine the page’s color scheme. You
cannot, however, place navigation items such as sidebars of JavaScript
on the search results page.
 Site-flavored Google search: This Labs experiment builds a general pro-
file of your page, and then delivers results influenced by that profile. Your
visitors get results that might be aligned with their interests, assuming
they’re interested in the topic of your site. If they’re not interested in
your site, you’re lucky that they visited. Or perhaps you’re unlucky;
maybe they’re sending you hate mail. Let’s not think about that now.
Using any of these three services is fairly easy, and they’re all similar. For 
all three services, you need to know how to cut and paste HTML into your
page’s source document.
Your site must conform to typical Terms of Service guidelines — the same
sort of content restrictions as those for AdSense (see Chapter 18). Nothing
illegal, nothing immoral, no hate content, no copyright infringement. The
complete Terms of Service document is linked on the Google Free site. No
application procedure is required to use Google Free or its spinoffs. It’s gen-
erally unknown how much Google polices the many sites using Google search
boxes. Violating the Terms of Service and getting caught will result in a letter
from Google demanding that you remove its branded search box from the site.
Free Google on Your Site
The first step in obtaining a Google search box is to visit the Google Free page:
www.google.com/searchcode.html
On that page, you have three choices represented by three snippets of HTML
code:
 Google Free Web search: This option provides the basic search box;
your users Google the Web index.
 Google Free SafeSearch: This option is the same as the basic option but
with SafeSearch protection built in to all searches originating at your site.
 Google Free Web search with site search: This option gives your users
a choice of searching the Web or just your site.
Figure 15-1 shows the Google Free page with one of its blocks of HTML code.
Each code snippet is followed by an illustration of the resulting search box.
246
Part IV: Putting Google to Work 

Proceed like this:
1. Decide which type of Google Free you want by scrolling down the
page and looking at the examples.
2. Scroll down the page to see the corresponding HTML code.
3. Press Ctrl+A to highlight and select the entire code block.
4. Press Ctrl+C to copy the code.
5. Go to your Web page’s source document, position the cursor where
you want the search box to appear, and press Ctrl+V to paste the code
into your Web page’s source document.
Customizing Your Free Google
Google acknowledges how jarring it could be for visitors who search from your
site, and are then yanked away from it to a Google results page. If you have
lovingly designed your pages and labored over perfect color combinations,

Chapter 15: Giving Your Visitors a Leg Up: Google on Your Site

tossing your users into the stark black-blue-white world of Google seems
almost cruel. Doing so breaks the continuity of your site experience and is
especially galling if your users are using the Google keyword box to search
for content within your site.
Google makes up for this discontinuity, at least partly, by allowing you to
determine the color scheme of result pages generated from your search box
and allowing you to place a graphic logo at the top of the page. The result
rarely looks exactly like a site page, but it does look distinctive and reminds
the user of where he or she came from (your site).
Start customizing by going here:
www.google.com/services/free.html
Starting on that page, follow these steps:
1. Click the Start here to customize Google for your site link.
2. Under Step 1 of 4, click which Google Free service you’re customizing,
and then click the Continue button.
For simplicity, I chose the second choice, simple Google Free.
3. Under Step 2 of 4, fill in any box corresponding to a page element you
want to customize.
Figure 15-2 shows this page. Notice that Google offers a choice of site
search, even though you clicked simple Google Free. Whatever. Ignore it
or fill in a site domain. All boxes below that field are optional. If you have
a page logo, enter the location and filename (on your Web server) of the
graphic file. When choosing colors, use names or hex numbers. (You can
find the hex numbers of your background color, links color, and other
element colors in your page’s HTML source document.) If you use a
background image instead of a solid color, put the exact Web address of
the background image in the Background URL box.
4. Click the Preview button to see the results of your choices.
Figure 15-3 shows one result. Unfortunately, Google does not allow you
to precisely change the background color of the huge Google logo, so
that always stands out. In this case, as on many pages, the logo has its
own background color, which doesn’t look very good. I subsequently
changed the page’s background to match that color. It then became nec-
essary to change the text and link colors. The better result is in Figure
15-4. These multiple changes demonstrate how easy it is to tweak the
color scheme before moving away from the Step 2 of 4 page; simply
close the Preview window, make changes to the customization fields,

Site-Flavored Google Search
The third option for Google on your site slants search results toward the con-
tent of your page. If you operate a Web site about the local music scene, for
example, Google can skew search results to favor music-related sites and sites
about your region. To accomplish this tailoring of results, Google crawls your

site and attempts to determine its subject matter. Whether it is successful or
not, you have a chance to alter the profile of your site.
To start with site-flavored search, go here:
www.google.com/services/siteflavored.html
From that page, follow these steps:
1. Click the Start here to customize Google for your site link.
2. On the next page, enter the URL of your site.
Actually, you can use any URL; no matter what you enter, chances are
good Google will fail to build a profile. I recently tried the address for the
New York Times site, and Google could not figure out what it was about
(understandably, as a major news site is about everything).
3. Use the directory links to build your site’s profile.
This is fun. Click a broad category, and then select a subcategory. The
second choice shows up under your profile, as shown in Figure 15-5.
Repeat with as many profile entries as you like. Some subcategories are
further divided, but for the most part your profile is broadly defined.

The Business 
of Google

In this part . . .
M
ost of this book deals with the consumer side of
Google — the search engines we know, love, and
use daily. Increasingly, regular folks are becoming aware
of, and interested in, Google’s other side, the business 
services. That’s where this part comes in.
Google’s business side is mostly about advertising. You
can participate in two main ways: by advertising your
business and by running other people’s ads on your Web
site as a business in itself. Chapters 17 and 18 cover these
adventurous possibilities. As a great populist force, Google
has singly brought targeted, high-powered Internet adver-
tising to amateur and semipro Webmasters the world over.
Chapter 16, the first chapter in this part, is a general tutor-
ial for Webmasters (which means anyone with a Web page)
about getting into the Google index and staying there, so
people searching for your subjects can find you in Google.
You meet the Google spider, understand when and how it
crawls, and find out how to create pages that attract the
spider and make it like you.
The business of Google contributes an extra dimension to
the Googling experience, like the unearthly theoretical
dimensions of cosmic string theory. (Note: It’s not really
like that at all. I just wanted to mention string theory in
this book.) You might not think advertising has any rele-
vance to your life, but even nonadvertisers should under-
stand how Google displays ads, why it does, and how to
distinguish the ads from search results. [Editors’ note:
Brad seems reasonably lucid for the first time in this book.
We have no explanation and only hope that he finishes the
manuscript before undertaking his next mochaccino binge.]

 Building a link network for higher Google ranking
 Optimizing your site for the Google spider
 Avoiding Google’s wrath
F
rom the inception of the Web, it has been the goal of every person with
even a modest Web page to attract visitors. Advertising, reciprocal link-
ing, word of mouth, getting listed in directories — all have been tools in the
mad scramble for traffic. In the Google era, getting into the index has become
the single most important task of Webmasters large and small.
Search engine listing has always been crucial. Page owners have spent hours
submitting requests to innumerable directories and engines. Coding a page in
a way that attracts a search engine crawler and puts the page high on the
search results list became a crafty art form in the late 1990s. Google has
become so dominant in the search field that if your page can’t be Googled, 
it might as well not exist — that’s today’s presumption.
Some people resent Google’s power as the main determining factor of a site’s
visibility. The complaint that Google rewards popular sites, making them even
more popular at the expense of worthy competitors, has some legitimacy. But
there is good news. Google’s index is so huge (over eight billion Web pages at
this writing) and its indexing computations are so precise that Google can
create niches of visibility that didn’t exist before. If your site does one small
thing well, and you take the necessary steps to make it Google friendly, you
can be rewarded with a top-ranked site in your niche. It’s probably not impor-
tant to be visible to everyone; it is important to be highly visible to the people
who match your site’s mission.

Getting your site into the Google index requires patience and networking skill,
but it’s not hard. Improving your position in the index — how high your site
places on search results lists — can be trickier, but success likewise depends
on fairly simple steps. Old coding tricks don’t work in Google, which means
bad news and good news. The bad news is that there are no shortcuts to
prominence in Google. The good news is that the index is utterly democratic,
affording any Web site, large or small, a chance to gain good positioning
based on merit.
This chapter covers how Google crawls the Web, how a new page can get into
the index, and how a new or established site can improve its position in
Google’s search results.
The Google Crawl
As with most search engines, Google’s work has two parts: searching the Web
and building an index. When you enter a search request, Google doesn’t
really go onto the Web to find matching sites. Instead, it searches its index for
matches. Google is special at both ends of its work spectrum: first in the
scope of its Web searching (and therefore the size of its index) and second in
the method by which it matches keywords to Web pages stored in the index.
256
Part V: The Business of Google 
All about PageRank
Google’s secret sauce is PageRank, a mathe-
matical formula that grades every Web page in
Google’s gigantic Web index. When you search
in Google, the results are listed first by relevance
to your keyword(s), and then according to
PageRank, with the higher-ranked pages placed
above lower-ranked pages of equal relevance.
PageRank is responsible for the usefulness of
Google searches; it is the intelligence of the
engine. PageRank is also of ferocious interest to
Webmasters, many of whom are fanatically con-
cerned with raising the PageRank of their sites
and pages. The higher the ranking, the more vis-
ible is the site on relevant search results pages.
Changes in PageRank, up or down, mean
sudden prosperity or disaster for commercial
Web sites.
The PageRank formula is a closely held secret
and one of Google’s most valuable corporate
assets. Nobody outside the company knows
exactly how it works, but Google has divulged
certain core values in a Web site that lead to
high PageRank. These values — high-quality
incoming links, user-friendly page optimization,
and avoiding violations dictated by Google —
are what this chapter is all about.

Most search engine indexes start with an automatic, wide-flung search of the
Web, conducted by automated software fancifully called a spider or crawler.
Google’s crawl is farther-flung than most, resulting in an index that includes
over eight billion Web pages, as of this writing. (The current total is specified
in small print on Google’s home page.)
Google performs two levels of Web crawl. The main survey, often referred to
as Google’s deep crawl, is conducted roughly once a month. Google’s spider
takes slightly more than a week to accomplish its profound examination of
the Web. Then, as a bonus, Google launches a fresh crawl much more fre-
quently. The fresh crawl is an update to Google’s index that runs every day, or
several times a day, or not quite every day, depending on the site and at the
company’s discretion. Don’t think of the fresh crawl as a scheduled event; it
is a term that denotes Google’s determination to pick up new material from
sites that change often. Material gleaned from the fresh crawl is added to the
main Google index.
Webmasters can see the fresh crawl in action by searching for their new con-
tent in the main Google index. The continual index shifting is sometimes called
everflux, and the big index shift that happens after a deep crawl is called the
Google dance. Eager Webmasters should never forget that the everflux is unpre-
dictable, and that they should never pin their hopes on the Google dance.
The Google index has no guarantees, including one saying that any particular
site must be included in any crawl. Hold fast to persistence and patience. The
daily crawl is by no means designed to provide the Google index with a daily
comprehensive update of the Web. Its purpose is to freshen the index with
targeted updates.
Getting into Google
You can get your site into the Google index in two ways:
 Submit the site manually
 Let the crawl find it
Both methods lead to unpredictable results. Google offers no assurance that
submitted sites will be added to the index. Google does not respond to submis-
sions, and it does not promise to add or discard the site within a certain time
frame. You may submit and wait, or you may just wait for the crawl. You may
submit and wait for the crawl. Submitting does not direct the crawl toward you,
and it does not deflect it. Google is impassive and promises nothing. But Google
does sometimes add sites that would probably not be found by the crawl.
257
Chapter 16: Bringing Google and Its Users to Your Site

If you have added a new page to a site already in the Google index, you do
not need to submit the new page. Under most circumstances, Google will find
it the next time your site is crawled. But you might as well submit an entirely
new site, even if it consists of a single page. Do so at this URL:
www.google.com/addurl.html
The submission form could hardly be simpler. Enter your URL address, and
make whatever descriptive comments you feel might help your cause. Then
click the Add URL button — which is a bit misleading. Submitting a site is not
the same as adding it to the index! Only the Google crawler or a human
Google staffer can make additions to the index.
Luring the spider
The key to attracting Google’s spider is getting linked on other sites. Google
finds your content by following links to your pages. Links that lead from
other pages to your site are called incoming links (they are incoming from
your viewpoint). With no incoming links, you’re an unreachable island as far
as the Google crawl is concerned. Of course, anybody can reach you directly
by entering the URL, but you won’t pluck the spider’s web until you get other
sites to link to you.
258
Part V: The Business of Google 
Checking your status
How do you know whether your site is in the
Google index? Don’t try searching for it with
general keywords — that method is hit-and-
miss. You could search for an exact phrase
located in your site’s text, but if it’s not a unique
phrase you could get tons of other matches.
The best bet is to simply search for the URL.
Make it exact, and include the www prefix. If
you’re searching for an inner page of the site,
precision is likewise necessary, and remember
to include the htm or html file extension if it
exists.
The link operator (see Chapter 2) is invaluable
for checking the status of your incoming links
and, by extension, the health of your PageRank.
Use the operator followed immediately by the
URL, like this: link: www.bradhill.com.
The search results show pages containing a link
to your URL. When you try this operator with an
inner page of your site, remember that you most
likely link to your own pages with menus or nav-
igation bars, and Google regards those links as
incoming links, artificially inflating your incom-
ing link count. Incoming links within a domain
do not contribute to PageRank. You need to get
other sites linking to you.

In theory, any single page currently crawled by Google (that is, in the index)
that links to your page or site is enough to send Google’s spider crawling
toward you. In practice, you want as many incoming links as possible, both to
increase your chance of being crawled (sounds a little uncomfortable, doesn’t
it?) and to improve your PageRank after your site is in the index.
Keep your pipes clean. Don’t make life difficult for Google’s spider. That is to
say (how many different ways can I say this before I finally make myself
clear?), host your site with a reliable Web host, and keep your pages in good
working order. The Google crawl attempts to break through connection prob-
lems, but it doesn’t keep trying forever. If it can’t get through in the monthly
deep crawl and your site isn’t included in the fresh crawl, you could suffer a
longish, unnecessary delay before getting into the index.
Don’t expect instant recognition in Google when you add a page to your site.
If your site is part of the fresh crawl, new page(s) show up fairly quickly in
search results, but there’s no firm formula for the frequency of the fresh
crawl or the implementation of its results. If the spider hits your site during
the deep crawl, the wait for fresh pages to appear in the index is consider-
ably longer. The same factors apply if you move your site from one URL
address to another (but not if you merely change hosts, keeping the same
URL). Complicating that situation is that your site at the old address might
remain cached (stored) in Google’s index, even while search results are
matching keywords to your site at the new address. This confusion is one
reason some Webmasters don’t like the Google cache — when they make a
change to a site or its address, they don’t want the old information living on
in the world’s most popular search index.
259
Chapter 16: Bringing Google and Its Users to Your Site
Index or directory?
Most of this chapter is devoted to getting a
foothold in Google’s Web search index, which
should not be confused with Google Direc-
tory. Although the search index is largely auto-
mated, Google Directory consists of hand-
picked sites selected by a large volunteer staff.
Chapter 7 describes Open Directory Project,
which Google uses and upon which Google
imposes its PageRank formula.
Getting into the directory is more direct than
getting into the search index but not necessar-
ily quicker. You must go to the Open Directory
Project, not to Google, at this URL:
www.dmoz.org/add.html
Follow the instructions there. See also the
“Submitting a Web Page to the Directory” sec-
tion in Chapter 7.

On your own
Creating the Google index is an automated procedure. The Google spider
crawls through more than eight billion pages in its surveys of the Web. Some
sites (small ones in particular) might be tossed around by the Google dance,
even to the extent of dropping out of the index for a month at a time and then
reappearing. PageRank can fluctuate, influencing a site’s position in search
results. Some sites have trouble breaking into the index in the first place.
Although Google receives and attends to URL submissions, as described in this
chapter, the company does not provide customer service in the traditional
sense. There is no customer contact for indexing issues. The positive aspect
of this corporate distance is that the index is pure — nobody, regardless of
corporate size or online clout, can obtain favorable tweaking in the index.
The downside is that you’re on your own when navigating the surging tides of
this massive index. Patience and diligent networking are your best allies.
Keeping Google Out
Your priority might run contrary to this chapter, in that you want to prevent
Google from crawling your site and putting it in the Web search index. It does
seem pushy, when you think about it, for any search engine to invade your
Web space, suck up all your text, and make it available to anyone with a
matching keyword. Some people feel that Google’s cache is more than just
pushy and infringes copyright regulations by caching an unauthorized copy
of a site.
If you want to keep the Google crawl out of your site, get familiar with the
robots.txt file, also known as the Robots Exclusion Protocol. Google’s spider
understands and obeys this protocol.
The robots.txt file is a short, simple text file that you place in the top-level
directory (root directory) of your domain server. (If you use server space
provided by a utility ISP, such as AOL, you probably need administrative help
in placing the robots.txt file.) The file contains two instructions:
 User-agent: This instruction specifies which search engine crawler must
follow the robots.txt instructions.
 Disallow: This line specifies which directories (Web page folders) or
specific pages at your site are off-limits to the search engine. You must
include a separate Disallow line for each excluded directory.
260
Part V: The Business of Google 

A sample robots.txt file looks like this:
User-agent: *
Disallow: /
This example is the most common and simplest robots.txt file. The asterisk
after User-agent means all spiders are excluded. The forward slash after
Disallow means that all site directories are off-limits.
The name of Google’s spider is Googlebot. (“Here, Googlebot! Come to Daddy!
Sit. Good Googlebot! Who’s a good boy?”) If you want to exclude only Google
and no other search engines, use this robots.txt file:
User-agent: Googlebot
Disallow: /
You may identify certain directories as impervious to the crawl, either from
Google or all spiders:
User-agent: *
Disallow: /cgi-bin/
Disallow: /family/
Disallow: /photos/
Notice the forward slash at each end of the directory string in the preceding
examples. Google understands that the first slash implies your domain address
before it. So, if the first Disallow line were found at the bradhill.com site,
the line would be shorthand for http://www.bradhill.com/cgi-bin/, and
Google would know to exclude that directory from the crawl. The second for-
ward slash is the indicator that you are excluding an entire directory.
To exclude individual pages, type the page address following the first forward
slash, and leave off the ending forward slash, like this:
User-agent: *
Disallow: /family/reunion-notes.htm
Disallow: /blog/archive00082.htm
Each excluded directory and page must be listed on its own Disallow line.
Do not group multiple items on one line.
You may adjust the robots.txt file as often as you like. It’s a good tool when
building fresh pages that you don’t want indexed while still under construc-
tion. When they’re finished, take them out of the robots.txt file.
261
Chapter 16: Bringing Google and Its Users to Your Site

Building Your PageRank 
Through Networking
Earlier in this chapter, I explain that getting into Google is best accomplished
by incoming links from other sites. Google regularly crawls every site in its
index, and when links from one (or more) of those sites are added to their
pages, Google automatically sniffs you out. There is more to the story of
incoming links than merely getting your foot in the door. It turns out that
Google depends on the quantity and quality of those links to help it deter-
mine your site’s PageRank. That means that the effort you put into network-
ing your site among other Webmasters affects how visible you are in Google.
There are two aspects of your site’s exposure in Google: appearing under the
correct keywords and appearing high up in the listings. This section deals
with the latter — improving your PageRank so that you get the best possible
positioning wherever you appear. (Actually, these two topics are not com-
pletely divided. Achieving a good PageRank is partly the result of proper key-
word positioning.) The first aspect of Google exposure — making your site
appear on relevant search results pages — is covered later in this chapter in
the site optimization section.
Incoming links and PageRank
Google is secretive about the details of PageRank. Most people wouldn’t under-
stand the equations if they were divulged, but other search engine operators
would, so you can’t blame Google for protecting a major corporate asset.
One aspect of PageRank that Google has always been forthcoming about is
incoming links. The number and quality of incoming links plays the largest
part in a site’s PageRank. So, to gain greater visibility in Google, you need to
increase and upgrade those incoming links, or backlinks.
Webmasters seeking to drive traffic to their sites through Google spend
immense portions of their time networking to develop their backlink network.
(The backlink network is simply the surrounding sites that link to the
Webmaster’s site.) This networking is often accomplished the old-fashioned
way, by introducing oneself and talking to other site owners.
Human networking
Building a vibrant backlink network involves contacting other sites, introduc-
ing yourself, and asking to be linked — it’s as simple as that. Offering to link
to that site in return smoothes the way to a reciprocal agreement in many cases.
262
Part V: The Business of Google 

When networking, it’s important to keep things relevant. That means approach-
ing sites that overlap your site’s topicality to some extent. Believe it or not,
Google’s algorithm does know when backlinks are irrelevant, and they carry
little weight in the PageRank equation. In fact, by accumulating many irrelevant
incoming links, a site can be punished with a lower PageRank. So approach-
ing high-profile sites merely because you want your PageRank boosted by
their powerful ranking can be a waste of time, and even dangerous.
For the most part, you want incoming links to point to your top page or home
page, sometimes called the index page. Whatever page offers the broadest
introduction to your entire site is the best landing destination for visitors
coming across on incoming links. The risk of developing a backlink network
that points to all sort of inner pages is that you could end up with an unfo-
cused assortment of incoming links scattering visitors all over your site.
From a PageRank perspective, such a disorganized backlink network does
you little good. The goal is to get your main page — the page with all your
navigation links — as high in Google as possible. Like a rising tide, it will lift
your other pages.
263
Chapter 16: Bringing Google and Its Users to Your Site
Blog backlinks
Weblogs (also called blogs) are popular online
journals; at this writing some forty million of
them exist. Blogs add a new twist to acquiring
incoming links, and Google has had to work
hard to master the blogging trend in its index.
Blogs are rich in both outgoing and incoming
links, thanks to their link-intensive style of writ-
ing and their blogrolls — traditional sidebar lists
of selected Weblogs. Google does not deny
blogs their space in the Web index, and running
a blog is a good way to network. However, the
advantages of intensive linking come with a
price, which is hard, relentless work. The best
and most-linked blogs are updated daily at
least; sometimes many times each day. You
must have a lot to say about a subject to devote
a Weblog to it, and this is not a casual way to
build content or backlink networks.
But once you are up and running with a blog,
networking is easier than with a collection of
static Web pages. Inserting yourself in the blog-
osphere generates backlinks as a matter of
course, simply by being part of the wide con-
versation in your topic. Leaving comments on
other blogs usually includes leaving a backlink.
If you become fairly well known, other bloggers
will put your site in their blogrolls, which get
replicated on each page of the Weblog. The
result is that good, authentic Weblogs can zoom
up the PageRank ladder faster than traditional
Web sites.
The key word is authentic. It’s pointless to try
fooling Google or other bloggers. If you’re in the
blogging game just to build PageRank, and you
start littering the blogosphere with unsubstan-
tial or meaningless comments (most of which
will be removed), you will be scorned by other
bloggers and get nowhere in Google.

Certain sites are set up to automatically facilitate backlinking. Called link
farms, these clearinghouses have attained reasonably (sometimes very) high
PageRanks, and placing an incoming link on one of them presumably lifts your
own site’s PageRank. Google dislikes automated link farms and claims to have
the ability to distinguish links that come from them. These places often pay
no heed to the relevance of links. Google would rather reward sites with sub-
stantial human-placed linkage that reflects true value on both ends. Most
conscientious and successful Webmasters avoid using link farms.
Trading content
Trading links with relevant sites is fine; even better is trading content. Every
site needs relevant content. Article exchanges make participating sites better
destinations, with the secondary PageRank-building effect of placing links in
both directions. In fact, three types of link are possible with each article you
place on another site:
 A byline link
 An attribution link, which might come immediately after the byline or at
the article’s end
 Embedded links to your site in the article text
Just as you should avoid link farms (see preceding section), you should also
sidestep article farms, which are automated upload sites where anybody may
place content stuffed with backlinks. Beware: Google either knows or will
soon know. The company is continually working to keep its index clean and
its PageRank honest.
Optimizing Your Site for Google
The field of search engine optimization (commonly shortened to SEO), is
pretty old by Internet standards and can be as simple or as complex as you
want it to be. The purpose of SEO is to get placed accurately on search
engine results pages. High ranking is also a goal, but the core emphasis of
SEO is identifying your site with certain keywords, so that when people
search Google (or another search engine) with those keywords, your pages
appear in the results.
SEO doesn’t enjoy an entirely positive reputation, thanks to unscrupulous
consultants who have attempted, and sometimes succeeded, to game the
system by cheating. Cheating implies rules, and indeed, Google has them.
264
Part V: The Business of Google 

Violation of those rules can result in the worst punishment possible for a
Web site in search of traffic: expulsion from the Google index. Don’t think of
this as an abstract threat; it happens all the time.
But basic site optimization, which on many points is just good design and
common sense, helps everyone. A well-optimized site helps Google catego-
rize it properly; helps visitors make the most of the site; and helps the
Webmaster gain the type and amount of traffic desired.
This section covers the basic points of ethical SEO.
It’s all about keywords
When building a highly optimized site, you should always be thinking about
keywords. Keywords are the kernels of your site’s content. The process ide-
ally begins before you build pages and put content into them, but any time is
a good time to get aware of the what and where of each page’s keywords.
Imagine that you’re searching for your own site. You are your site’s ideal visi-
tor — perfectly interested in, and attuned to, its mission and content. How
would you search? What keywords would you use? Those are the keywords
around which your content should hang. Those essential words and phrases
should be embedded in your page’s text in a few crucial ways:
 In headers
 In the page title
 In the page’s meta tags
 In the page’s text, but not so much that your readers feel hit over the
head with them
(See your page design software for information about filling in the keyword
meta tag.)
Keywords are the battleground in the fight for Google exposure. If your site is
not appearing on the correct result pages but similar sites are, or if your site
is not appearing high enough to attract traffic, your keyword optimization prob-
ably needs work. Remember, also, that certain keyword have greater value and
more daunting competition than others. If you’re fighting for space around the
keywords music downloading, you’re more likely to get clobbered than if you
find a niche of your own, such as icelandic electronica. Deciding on your site’s
keywords is, essentially, deciding on your site’s position in the universe — at
least, in the Google universe. You’re not optimizing for the whole world; you’re
optimizing for a certain type of visitor with certain defined interests.
265
Chapter 16: Bringing Google and Its Users to Your Site

Effective site design
An important element of search engine optimization is using design elements
that don’t confuse, frustrate, delay, or anger the Google spider. The following
SEO principles are widely known to get a site smoothly integrated into the
Google index:
 Place important content outside dynamically generated pages: A
dynamic page is one created on-the-fly based on choices made by the
site visitor. This method of page generation works fine when the visitor
is a thinking human. (Or even a relatively thoughtless human.) But when
an index robot hits such a site, it can generate huge numbers of pages
unintentionally (assuming robots ever have intentions), sometimes
crashing the site or its server. The Google spider picks up some dynami-
cally generated pages, but generally backs off when it encounters
dynamic content. Weblog pages do not fall into this category — they are
dynamically generated by you, the Webmaster, not by your visitors.
 Don’t use splash pages: Splash pages (which Google calls doorway
pages) are content-empty entry pages to Web sites. You’ve probably
seen them. Some splash pages employ cool multimedia introductions to
the content within. Others are static welcome mats that force users to
click again before getting into the site. Google does not like pointing its
searchers to splash pages. In fact, these tedious welcome mats are bad
site design by any standard, even if you don’t care about Google index-
ing, and I recommend getting rid of them. Give your visitors, and Google,
meaningful content from the first click, and you’ll be rewarded with hap-
pier visitors and better placement in Google’s index.
 Use frames sparingly: Frames have been generally loathed since their
introduction into the HTML specification early in the Web’s history.
They wreak havoc with the Back button, and they confuse the funda-
mental format of Web addresses (one page per address) by including
independent page functions within one Web page. However, frames do
have legitimate uses. Google itself uses frames to display threads in
Google Groups (see Chapter 6). But the Google crawler turns up its nose
when it encounters frames. That’s not to say that framed pages neces-
sarily remain out of the Web index. But errors can ensue, hurting both
the index and your visitors — either your framed pages won’t be included,
or searchers are sent to the wrong page because of address confusion. If
you do use frames, make your site Google friendly (and human friendly)
by providing links to unframed versions of the same content. These links
give Google’s diligent spider another route to your valuable content and
give us (Google’s users) better addresses with which to find your stuff.
And your visitors get a choice of viewing modes — everybody wins.
266
Part V: The Business of Google 

 Divide content topically: How long should a Web page be? The answer
differs depending on the nature of the page, the type of visitor it attracts,
how heavy (with graphics and other modem-choking material) it is, and
how on-topic the entire page is. Long pages are sometimes the result of
lazy site building, because it takes effort to spin off a new page, address
it, link to it, and integrate it into the overall site design. From Google’s
perspective, and in the context of securing better representation in the
index, breaking up content is good, as long as it makes topical sense. If
you operate a fan page for a local music group, and the site contains
bios, music clips, concert schedules, and lyrics, Google could make more
sense of it all if you devote a separate page to each of those content
groups. Google also likes to see page titles relating closely to page con-
tent. Keeping your information bites mouth-sized helps Google index
your stuff better.
 Keep your link structure tidy: Google’s spider is efficient, but it’s not a
mind reader. Nor does it make up URL variations, hoping to find hidden
content. The Google crawler is a slave to the link. If you want all your
pages represented in the index, make sure each one has a link leading to it
from within your site. Many site-building programs contain link-checking
routines and administrative checks to diagnose linkage problems. Simple
sites might not warrant such firepower; in that case, check your naviga-
tion sidebars and section headers to make sure you’re not leaving out
anything.
The folly of fooling Google
For as long as search engines have crawled the Web, site owners have engi-
neered tricks to get the best possible position on search results pages.
Traditionally, these tricks include the following:
 Cloaking, in which important, crawl-attracting keywords are hidden from
the view of site visitors but remain visible to spiders
 Keyword loading, related to cloaking, in which topical words are loaded
into the page’s code, especially in page titles and text headers
 Link loading, through which large numbers of incoming links are fabricated
Spider-manipulating tricks have worked to some extent in the past thanks to
the automated nature of search crawling. Google is highly automated, too,
but more sophisticated than most other spiders. And as a company policy,
Webmaster chicanery is dealt with harshly. Obviously, you’re not breaking
any laws by coding your pages in a certain way, even if your motive is to fool
267
Chapter 16: Bringing Google and Its Users to Your Site

Google. But Google doesn’t hesitate to banish a site from the index entirely if
it determines that its PageRank is being artificially jiggered. No published
policy states when or if a banished site is reinstated. Google is serious about
the integrity of PageRank.
The best rule is this: Create a site for people, not for spiders. Generally, the
interests of people and Google’s spider coincide. A coherent, organized site
that’s a pleasure to surf is also a site that’s easy to crawl. Keeping your priori-
ties aligned with your visitors is the best way to keep your PageRank as high
as it can get.

H
ow do you define Google — as a search engine? Fair enough, but that’s
just half the story, and perhaps the lesser half. The hidden side of
Google is its advertising business. Since the company’s initial public offering,
that hidden half has come into the light, but normal Google users going about
their online lifestyles do not necessarily understand everything that tran-
spires on the advertising side.
Google doesn’t make money by simply fulfilling your search requests. (Have
you sent in a check lately?) Google makes almost all its money from advertis-
ers who place ads on Google’s result pages and on other sites that partner with
Google in running those ads. This advertising is not the traditional sort of adver-
tising you see in a magazine, or on TV, or even as flashing banners on a Web
site. Google advertising is mostly connected to the search requests processed
by Google and is designed to connect people searching with companies pro-
viding goods and services, at the very moment that the need is greatest.
Companies still pay good money for banner placement and for the develop-
ment of new interactive features within banners. But the effectiveness of 
banners has been devalued in many marketing scenarios and in the Web’s
amateur, semi-pro, and small-business space. A new way of reaching individ-
uals with targeted, relevant links is what’s needed. The natural placement 
of a highly relevant promotional link is on a search results page because the
person viewing that page is obviously looking for something and is ready to
click through to another online destination.

Purchasing placement on a search results pages is not new, and the history of
this business strategy is rife with disrepute. Many a pre-Google search engine
ruined its reputation by polluting its search results with advertisements that
were difficult to distinguish from the real listings.
Google aggressively sells space on its search results pages. But several
aspects of Google’s ad business distinguish it and make it amazingly popular:
 The ads are clearly separated from search results, keeping Google’s
integrity untarnished.
 Google enforces language and style guides that create accurate promo-
tions in the true spirit and tone of the search results page.
 Anybody can get in on the game, at a price of their own choosing.
 The ads are distributed across all Google search areas and a wide net-
work beyond, enhancing their impact and effectiveness.
 The ads running on Google’s pages are text-only presentations, which
don’t slow the display of search results. Ads running on the wide net-
work beyond Google’s pages may be either text or nonflashing banners.
 Most ads are not charged upon display. Advertisers pay only when an ad
works — that is, upon clickthrough. This policy differs from traditional
online advertising, which is billed by impressions — in other words,
whenever an ad is displayed. (At the time of this writing, Google had just
inaugurated a pay-per-impression program designed for large compa-
nies. Smaller companies and individuals are expected to continue using
the pay-per-click system.)
 The process of purchasing an ad is almost totally automated and inter-
active, putting all control of price and display frequency in the hands of
the advertiser.
This chapter concentrates on traditional AdWords — the pay-per-click system
using text ads. This book has space for only a basic outline of features. Readers
who are intrigued by the possibilities might want to look at my Building Your
Business with Google For Dummies (published by Wiley), which devotes five
chapters to Google AdWords.
Understanding the AdWords Concept
A business of any size, even an individual just starting out, may purchase
AdWords. There is no exclusivity based on type of business, amount of rev-
enue, promotional budget, or any other criterion. You do need a Web page.
You do not need to be selling something, though there is probably a low limit
on the amount of money anybody would spend on advertising a hobby site.
Still, many Webmasters use AdWords to promote sites which make their
money by running advertising.
270
Part V: The Business of Google 

Beginning an AdWords campaign consists of four main steps:
1. Sign up for an AdWords account.
2. Write an ad.
3. Choose keywords with which your ad will be associated.
4. Price your ad and decide on an overall payment budget.
You may create the account and your ads before committing to the program.
Step 3 — choosing keywords — is crucial. AdWords operates by displaying
ads on search results pages generated by users querying with keywords that
match the advertisers’ keywords. To put it another way, your ads are trig-
gered when somebody searches on the ad’s keywords. Choosing keywords
relevant to your ad and to your landing page (the page viewed by anybody
who clicks your ad) is of supreme importance. If your keywords are off the
mark, you probably won’t get many clickthroughs, and the visitors you do get
from your ad will probably be mismatched to your content.
AdWords text ads are nothing more than blurbs. With no graphics and mini-
mal text, they fit concisely along the right side of search results pages. Figure
17-1 shows a results page with several AdWords placements.

Chapter 17: Stimulating Your Business with AdWords

The essential item that you create in an AdWords campaign is the ad group.
An ad group contains one ad, its keywords, and its underlying cost structure.
(In truth, an ad group may contain more than one ad, but just one set of key-
words targeted by the ads. In the interest of keeping things simple, this sec-
tion considers an ad group as containing a single ad.)
Following is a breakdown of every element in an ad group:
 Headline: Each ad starts with a headline that links to the target page.
 Description lines: Two very short lines. That’s all you get in the way of
descriptive content. Concise writing is crucial.
 Destination URL: Each ad spells out the target page address, which is
the same as the Headline link address.
 Keywords: Every ad is associated with search keywords that cause its
appearance on a results page. Keyword phrases may be used. You can
change the keywords at any time.
 Cost-per-click (CPC): You decide how much the ad is worth by deciding
the price you’ll pay whenever somebody clicks it. Google enforces mini-
mums for some keywords. (The total CPC price range for all ads is $.05
to $50.00.) Your ad competes with other ads associated with the same
keyword(s), and advertisers willing to pay more get better (higher) posi-
tioning on the page.
Google’s international sensibility is reflected in AdWords; you may specify a
language and a country for your ads. (More specifically, you may also deter-
mine a metropolitan region of the United States.) Google determines, more or
less successfully, the country (or region) from which each user’s computer is
logged in. The language requirement is more certain: Google shows your ad
to users whose Preferences language setting (see Chapter 2) matches your
chosen language.
You control the cost of your advertising in two ways: by establishing a CPC
(cost-per-click) price for each ad you create and by creating a daily expendi-
ture budget. If you get many clickthroughs on a certain day and hit the top of
your budget, Google pulls your ad for the rest of the day.
Here’s how it all works. You create an ad (or ads). You choose one or more
keywords (or phrases) to associate with each ad. You decide how much to
pay for visitors clicking through each ad. You establish a limit on your daily
expenditure on Google advertising. Then, if and when you activate your ad,
Google places it on search results pages when people search for keywords
associated with your ad. Your ad’s visibility (placement on the results page)
depends on your CPC price compared to that of other advertisers sharing
272
Part V: The Business of Google 

your keyword(s). Higher bids generally get higher placement on the page,
though the ad’s success also influences placement. (See the sidebar titled
“Google’s placement formula.”) In many cases, the placement of an ad varies
over time as advertisers come and go, or as they adjust their CPC prices.
The CPC price you set is a maximum price. Google charges less if it can. Over
time, in most cases, your average CPC price is less than the price you set. In
this regard, AdWords is like an eBay auction, in which you’re bidding for high
placement on a Google search results page. By setting a maximum CPC price,
you authorize Google to go up to that price for the top spot. But in reality,
273
Chapter 17: Stimulating Your Business with AdWords
Google’s placement formula
Nothing succeeds like success, the old saying
goes — and it holds true for ad placement on
Google’s search results page. The cost you
assign per clickthrough is a big part of the story,
but it’s not the only part. Google rewards suc-
cessful ads by placing them higher on the page
and reducing their clickthrough costs. Success
is measured by clickthrough rate — that is, the
number of clickthroughs an ad attracts com-
pared to its display rate.
Google rewards high clickthrough rates by low-
ering the effective CPC price assigned to that
ad. This means the more popular ad might get
top placement even when competing with an
advertiser who bid a higher CPC price. Google
does not divulge the exact formula that deter-
mines ad placement. Generally, though, ad
placement depends on a combination of CPC
price (your bid) and clickthrough rate (your ad’s
success).
This formula has a flip side. Just as Google
rewards success with higher placement, it pun-
ishes failure with reduced distribution. That
means if an ad doesn’t generate a certain click-
through level (usually one percent for new
advertisers, but lower in some circumstances),
Google reduces the rate at which it’s displayed.
This measure might seem harsh, but Google is
primarily concerned with the experience on
people using the search engine, so it wants
useful, magnetic ads appearing in the right
column of its results pages. If the clickthrough
rate gets too low, Google assumes that the ad
isn’t relevant to its keywords and doesn’t want
the ad on its pages.
Google sends a notice to the control center of
any advertiser whose ad has been knocked into
reduced circulation. You can restore full deliv-
ery with a button click, and Google provides
tools and tips for improving the clickthrough
rate. If Google again pushes aside your ad, and
you restore full delivery a third time, Google
charges a $5 reactivation fee. More drastically,
Google doesn’t hesitate to knock your ad off the
pages of certain keyword results entirely if,
after one thousand impressions, the click-
through rate isn’t up to par. After a keyword in
an advertiser’s campaign has been disabled in
this fashion (meaning that the advertiser’s ads
no longer appear on that keyword’s results
page), it’s very hard to reactivate that keyword.
Google plays tough.

you pay only one penny more than required to get that top spot (in other
words, one penny more than the top CPC rate set by competing advertisers).
If your top bid is less than the top CPC price of two other advertisers, for
example, you earn third place in the placement sweepstakes.
You control your Google advertising activity through a personal set of report-
ing and management tools attached to your account. There, you activate and
deactivate individual ads, change keywords, adjust cost settings, pause and
restart portions of your overall campaign, and develop new strategies.
Creating an Account and Your First Ad
Feel free to check out the AdWords tools before deciding whether you want
to advertise. You can open an account and create ads without making a com-
mitment. Your ads don’t go into play until you activate the account.
Get started by beginning an AdWords account:
1. Go to the following Welcome to AdWords page:
adwords.google.com
After you create your account, you can continue to use this page for 
logging in.
2. Click the Click to begin button.
Google gets you started by creating an ad group. Nothing about this
process requires money or payment information.
3. Under the Step 1 of 4 banner (see Figure 17-2), select your language
and type of geographic targeting.
These options determine who will see your ads. Users whose Preferences
settings match your language selections see your ads. Google uses the
computer’s IP (Internet Protocol) address, which is roughly accurate, to
determine a person’s location by country. You may select more than one
language by pressing the Ctrl key while making selections. If you select
the Regions and cities regional targeting class or the Customized target-
ing class, Google displays two extra pages on which you choose specific
countries and metropolitan regions. In this example, we’re choosing the
Global or nationwide option.
4. Click the Save & Continue button.
274
Part V: The Business of Google 

5. Under Step 1b, select one or more countries with the Add button, or
select All Countries, and then click the Save & Continue button.
6. Under the Step 2 of 4 banner (see Figure 17-3), choose a name for your
ad group and create an ad.
This is where you write a headline, description, and target page URL.
The display URL may be different from your target URL. Google offers
this flexibility so the ad isn’t cluttered with a long, complicated URL.
Display URLs are usually short, containing the domain only, eliminating
whatever long address might actually take the visitor to the destination
page. Take some time here. Google has strict editorial guidelines that
must be followed; click the Editorial Guidelines link to understand them.
The limited description space requires you to be extremely concise, and
I can tell you from personal experience that pithiness is a lot harder than
wordiness. Take the time to make every word count.

7. Click the Continue button.
8. On the next page, choose your keywords.
People searching on the keywords you place here will see your ad. Type
one keyword or phrase per line; press the Enter key to add each subse-
quent keyword. Later, you’ll be able to adjust your keyword selections
based on Google’s estimate of how much your choices will cost. Assigning
keywords is a crucial part of the success and budgeting of an AdWords
campaign, but the words you type on this page are not etched in stone;
you can change them later.
9. Click the Save Keywords button.
10. On the next page, choose the monetary currency to use to pay for
AdWords and choose the maximum CPC for your keywords.
You are not committing any money at this point, nor are you activating
your ad. Google opens this page with a suggested CPC price; that
number is a competitive price based on other advertisers who are using
your keywords. Feel free to override the suggested price (which is usu-
ally arbitrary and insanely high) and lower it.
11. Click the Calculate Estimates button.
Google reloads the page with the CPC chart filled in with estimated costs
of your ad campaign, broken down by keyword. Google estimates the

number of clickthroughs based on current data from advertisers using
the same keywords. In the Average Cost-Per-Click column in Figure 17-4,
note that the estimates are lower than the assigned maximum cost that
you set above the table — quite a bit lower. These numbers are based on
competitive prices from other advertisers and give you an opportunity
to adjust your maximum accordingly. (Remember, Google will always
charge you the least amount below your maximum to deliver the top
spot on the page.) The cost estimates are your first indication of how
you should budget your campaign.
12. Click the Save & Continue button.
Before continuing, Google gives you a chance to create another ad, start-
ing this process over. Feel free to do so. I’m moving on to the daily
budget section.
13. Click the Continue to Step 3 button.
14. Under the Step 3 of 4 banner, enter a daily maximum you want to spend.
Creating a daily budget instead of using a longer time frame keeps your
ad’s exposure fairly even throughout the month (Google’s billing period)
even if you don’t want to spend much. Notice that Google displays this
page with a figure already loaded, and that it’s higher than your estimated
daily expense shown in Step 10 of this list. The higher amount is meant

277
Chapter 17: Stimulating Your Business with AdWords

to give you some breathing room and ensure that your ads appear maxi-
mally. Feel free to lower the number.
15. Click the Save & Continue button.
16. On the next page, scroll down to the Step 4 of 4 banner and fill in the
fields below it.
Nothing on this page, including clicking the button in the following step,
commits you to running your ads. This page creates the account that
holds the ads you just created, which may remain inactive for as long as
you want.
17. Click the Create my AdWords account button.
Google send a verification letter to your e-mail address. It should arrive
within seconds.
18. In the e-mail you receive from Google, click the provided link.
Clicking the link displays an AdWords welcome page in the browser
window you were using or a new one, depending on your browser and
e-mail settings.
You’re set. From this point on, log in to your control center by going to the
AdWords login page:
adwords.google.com
There, type your e-mail address and password to enter your account.
Activating Your Account
The AdWords account is activated by providing credit card information for
payment. When your credit card is verified (which takes mere seconds), your
ads immediately begin running.
Given Google’s continual tidal wave of search traffic, chances are good that
your ads and their potential clickthroughs will start appearing before you
make any adjustments to your campaign. Therefore, you should make those
adjustments before giving Google your billing information. If you’re confident
of your campaign expenses, go ahead and activate the account. But if you
created an ad as an experiment and are unsure whether to proceed, do not fill
in your billing information.
Activate your account with these steps:
1. Go to your control center at adwords.google.com, type your e-mail
address and password, and then click the Login button.
2. Click the Edit Billing Information link.
278
Part V: The Business of Google 

3. On the Edit Billing Information page, fill in your credit card and
address information.
4. Using the drop-down menus, choose a primary business type.
5. Click the Record my new billing information button.
Google charges $5 to activate your AdWords account.
Managing Your Campaigns
The AdWords control center lets you control five main areas of the AdWords
experience:
 View the details of your ads and campaigns
 Display activity reports showing your ad impressions and clickthroughs
 Change keywords and prices
 Create ads and campaigns
 Track expenses and manage your billing arrangements
This section gives you a brief tour of the control center; the main page of the

Viewing your campaign reports
Google provides a summary of all your campaigns on one page. This summary
view appears whenever you first enter the control center (see Figure 17-5).
The following elements go into the summary report:
 Campaign selector: Use the top drop-down menu (it displays the default
selection “Show all but deleted campaigns”) to select which campaign
you’d like summarized. The default selection shows summaries of all
current campaigns. Clicking a single campaign automatically reloads the
page with a full report of the selected campaign.
 Date range: Use these drop-down menus to select a date range for which
Google will summarize your report. Click the lower radio button to
choose your own date range.
 Campaign Summary table: In this green-highlighted table are vital sta-
tistics of your campaign’s performance, detailed in the following items.
 Clicks: The numbers in this column represent clickthroughs on your ad.
See the full report for a breakdown of clickthroughs per keyword. 
 Impr.: This abbreviation stands for impressions and is a measure of the
number of times your ad has been displayed on search results pages.
 CTR: This all-important figure represents your clickthrough rate. The
CTR is expressed as a percentage; if one out of a hundred people who
are shown your ad click it, your clickthrough rate is 1 percent. If that
rate falls too low, Google restricts the distribution of your ad.
 Avg. CPC: This dollar (or other currency) figure tells you the average
cost-per-click accounted to your ad.
 Cost: This column displays the total cost of your clickthroughs to date.
 Conv. Rate: Google helps you track not only clickthroughs but also your
site’s success at convincing visitors to take a planned action. You decide
what that action is — perhaps signing up for a newsletter or buying a
product. Google provides HTML code for Webmasters to place on the
result page of that action; such a page might be a thank-you for newslet-
ter sign-up or an order-confirmation page after a purchase. That HTML
code then reports back to your AdWords account and translates your
accumulated conversions over time to a cost-per-conversion figure. If all
this seems too complex for a simple marketing campaign, feel free to
ignore it. You do not need to use the feature or pay attention to the
Conv. Rate column.
 Cost/Conv.: Google computes how much you spent per conversion in that
campaign, helping you manage your AdWords expenses and profit margin.
Google’s reporting is reasonably quick but hardly instantaneous. Take into
account a time lag that could be as long as three hours.

Editing your campaign
Click any campaign title to see a full report for that campaign. The full report
contains all the information in the summaries, but itemized by ad group, as
shown in Figure 17-6. Further, from the report page you can make changes to
the campaign’s ad text, keywords, costs, and timing.
Following is a rundown of editing features you can launch from the report page:
 Edit Campaign Settings: Click this link to alter crucial basic information
about the campaign, including its name, daily budget, start and end
dates, language and country settings, and network distribution settings.
These are the settings you established before activating the account;
you always have the opportunity to adjust them. Figure 17-7 shows the
options on the Edit Campaign Settings page.
 Delete Campaign: This self-explanatory link not only halts the campaign
from running (see the Delete item in this list) but erases your ad and all
campaign settings. Although Google allows you to view deleted content
in AdWords, it doesn’t allow you to restore deletions. So be careful. If
you want to stop advertising but preserve the campaign for later reacti-
vation, use the Pause Ad Group option.

Chapter 17: Stimulating Your Business with AdWords

 Pause: Clicking this button instantly removes the ads associated with
the currently displayed keywords from distribution. Big brown letters
indicate that the ad group is paused, wherever the ad group is listed or
referred to in the control center. Click the Resume Campaign link to get
it going again.
 Delete: A dangerous button, this one eradicates any checked ad group in
the currently displayed campaign.
 Create New Ad Group: This link takes you to the same ad-creation page
you went through before setting up the account. There, you can write a
new ad (headline, description, and URLs) to associate with a new set of
keywords.
Keywords and cost-per-click remain constant across an ad group, regardless
of how many ads are in the group. You may use the same ads in different
groups, associated with different keywords and costs. In fact, doing so is a
good way to test the performance of certain ads when displayed against dif-
ferent keyword sets.

Starting a new campaign
In the control center (refer to Figure 17-5), click the Create new AdWords
Campaign link to start a new set of ad groups. Remember the hierarchy in
AdWords: one or more ads in an ad group (all associated with the same key-
words and cost-per-click), and one or more ad groups in a campaign.
Creating a new campaign takes you through the same process (assigning lan-
guages and countries, writing the ad, and establishing costs) described previ-
ously in this chapter.
More About Keywords
AdWords places a huge emphasis on choosing effective keywords. Getting
your ad on the right results pages, where it can be noticed by the right people,
is the free method of increasing your clickthrough rate. (The only other
method is to raise your placement level, which usually costs more money.)
When choosing keywords, an inherent tradeoff is at work between traffic and
placement. Here’s how it works. If you choose popular keywords, you have
more competition from other advertisers. That means you must bid with a
higher cost-per-click price to get good placement. If you choose more
obscure keywords with less competition, you can get higher placement more
cheaply, but you sacrifice the raging river of traffic searching for high-profile
keywords. Of course, with Google’s overwhelming level of traffic, even a rela-
tive trickle might be sufficient.
The answer to this tradeoff is to think in terms of precision, not popularity.
Spend time finding the exact match between keywords and what you’re offering.
Just as Google understands certain search operators when trolling the Web,
Google AdWords understands certain keyword modifiers when applied to
your ad groups. Of course, you may list single keywords and multiple-word
strings. In addition, remember these conventions:
 Quotes: Exact phrase quotes work in AdWords as they do in the search
area. Put quotation marks around any set of two or more keywords to
denote an exact phrase. Google places your ad on results pages that
searched for that exact phrase plus any other words the user might have
included in his or her search string. For example, “leather belts” would
283
Chapter 17: Stimulating Your Business with AdWords

force the ad to display on results pages for leather belts and also leather
belts handbags.
 Brackets: Use square brackets around any phrase to keep it exact and to
exclude any other words in a search string. This tactic limits the appear-
ance of your ad to results pages for your phrase standing alone as the
entire search string. For example, [leather belts] forces the ad to appear
only on results pages for leather belts.
 Negative keywords: Exclude keywords by placing a minus sign directly
before them. This modifier is identical to the NOT search operator (see
Chapter 2). When the excluded keyword is used by someone searching
Google, your ad does not appear on the results page. For example,
“leather belts” -handbags means the ad won’t appear on results pages for

n Chapter 17 I observe that Google is like two companies: a search engine
and an advertising company. As you might guess from the name, AdSense
is part of the advertising side. AdSense is related to AdWords; it is a program
in which a far-flung network of Web sites displays AdWords ads.
When an advertiser signs up for AdWords, that advertiser has two broad
choices: to limit the placement of ads to Google search results pages, as dis-
cussed in Chapter 17, or to broaden the placement of ads beyond Google to
thousands of other sites. Most of those other sites belong to what Google
calls the content network. It is so called because Google determines the con-
tent of those sites before placing relevant ads on them. Ads that appear on
Google search results pages are determined by the keywords searchers use
to bring up results pages. Ads that appear on the content network pages are
determined by Google’s interpretation of those pages’ subject matter.
There is no shortage of advertisers choosing to broaden their reach by
having Google place ads on the content network. And, as you know if you’ve
searched around the Web much, there is no shortage of sites eager to run
those ads. Figure 18-1 and 18-2 show two pages — one a large news site and
the other a personal Web journal — that participate in AdSense. The now-
famous “Ads by Goooooogle” (don’t ask me about all the o’s) is a sign of an
AdSense content site.

This chapter covers the essentials of AdSense in theory and practice, while
regretfully omitting some of the deeper complexities to save space. Any read-
ers interested in a full treatment might want to look at my Building Your
Business with Google For Dummies (by Wiley).
The AdSense Overview
Google AdSense is an extension of AdWords that allows Web sites to earn
advertising revenue. At best, AdSense is a nearly effortless way to make good
money. At worst, AdSense requires a little time to figure out, takes some space
on your pages, and ends up paying almost nothing. Your fortunes with AdSense
depend on three factors:
 How well optimized your site is (see Chapter 16)
 How much traffic your site has
 What subjects your site is focused on
That second one — your traffic volume — is usually the most important.
AdSense publishers (the Webmasters who participate in the AdSense program)
are credited every time a visitor clicks a Google ad displayed on their sites.
The advertiser pays Google for every clickthrough (see Chapter 17 for an
explanation of AdWords), and Google shares that money with the Webmaster.
It might seem incredible that Google can keep track of all this on thousands
of sites, but it’s not a problem. That kind of tracking technology has been in
place for years.
The big question is this: How much of the clickthrough payment does Google
give to the Webmaster — what’s the split? Nobody knows. Oh, I suppose
somebody knows, perhaps Alan Greenspan or the Dalai Lama. But nobody
else outside Google knows, and this secrecy has been a point of contention
since the start of AdSense. However, Google does not appear to be stingy.
AdSense publishers are forbidden (by the Terms of Service agreement) to
divulge their clickthrough volume or clickthrough payments, but they are
allowed to reveal overall revenue earned through AdSense. Some publishers
are doing very well, to the tune of thousands of dollars a month. You need to
be processing a great deal of Web traffic to accumulate that kind of payout —
along the lines of hundreds of thousands of visitors per month or more. But
the point is that Google has built AdSense into a successful program by shar-
ing generously with its publishers.
The subject of your site has some bearing on the AdSense payout. Google
places relevant ads on your pages, and some subjects are in great demand
among advertisers who are willing to pay high clickthrough rates. For exam-
ple, at this writing, the mortgage industry was paying high premiums for
clickthrough advertising, so a mortgage site running AdSense might enjoy
287
Chapter 18: Rescuing Your Revenue with Google AdSense

high payouts per clickthrough. At the same time, competition is high in that
field, so building traffic is more of a challenge. (Please see Chapter 17 for a
fuller discussion of how advertisers bid for ad rates in AdWords.)
Site optimization is important to AdSense success. (Please attempt to say
“AdSense success” quickly, several times. Thank you.) If you follow the prin-
ciples laid out in Chapter 16, your site will draw ads from Google that relate
closely to your page content. Your visitors will find them relevant and inter-
esting; some visitors will click through. Irrelevant ads are your biggest enemy,
so make sure every page upon which you place AdSense ads is fine-tuned and
focused. Check the ads (don’t click them; just look at them) to see if they are
relevant. If not, the problem might be that the Google AdSense crawler doesn’t
understand the page, and that’s probably an optimization issue.
What You Need to Know to Run AdSense
Once put in place, AdSense runs itself for the most part. The money you make
with AdSense is called passive income for a good reason: You remain passive
(perhaps reclining with a glass of wine) while the money rolls (or trickles) in.
I don’t want to mislead anybody. AdSense is not a get-rich-quick scheme. The
Webmasters making the most money have paid their dues in numerous ways.
For most publishers, AdSense revenue is like found money: not very much
but gladly received. Serious publishers with modest but substantive sites can
reasonably hope to pay for their domain and Web-hosting expenses through
AdSense.
In exchange for this easy money, you must know enough HTML (the basic
underlying language of Web sites) to insert the AdSense code into your
pages. If you build your pages using a graphical program such as Macromedia
Dreamweaver or Microsoft FrontPage, the HTML can remain hidden. Most
programs allow you to see and directly manipulate the HTML code, but if you
don’t know what you’re doing, your AdSense ads might appear on the wrong
part of the page until you get it right. You do not need to know how to write
HTML. The process involves copying and pasting about a dozen short lines of
code from your AdSense account to your Web page(s).
Determining Your Site’s Eligibility
Before you get stars in your eyes, dreaming about earning money for posting
pictures of your cat, you should know that Google reserves AdSense participa-
tion for serious content sites. That doesn’t mean you must be a professional
Webmaster. Google is pretty accommodating, but there is an acceptance
process, and some sites get rejected. After all, Google is trying to provide value
to its advertisers, so the publishers in the content network must provide the
type of page likely to deliver viable clickthrough business to the advertisers.

Chapter 18: Rescuing Your Revenue with Google AdSense
AdSense for feeds: Money for Weblogs
Just before this manuscript was completed,
Google launched an AdSense experiment
called AdSense for feeds. AdSense for feeds is
designed for bloggers — the millions of individ-
uals who write online journals called Weblogs,
or blogs. There are two ways to read a blog:
Visit the blog site and read the entries, or use a
program called a newsreader to display the
blog’s feed. A feed is a type of syndication; in
short, it brings Web sites to you so you don’t
have to click your lazy way to them. Just kidding
about the laziness; feeds are extremely conve-
nient, and if you’re not using them now, I can
promise that eventually you will be using them.
Feeds are now used by nearly all major news
outlets in addition to personal bloggers. For
many people, the feed-displaying newsreader
has become the new home page.
Because feeds are a new type of online publi-
cation, and some forty million people author
blogs as of this writing, it makes sense for
Google to provide an opportunity to make a little
money from the feed, just as Google does for
Webmasters running traditional sites. That goal
is the point of AdSense for feeds, which simply
places AdWords into the feeds displayed in
newsreaders. The figure in this sidebar, show-
ing the feed of my Google blog, illustrates what
those ads look like.
Participating in AdSense for feeds requires a
separate application process from AdSense (for
Web sites). Of course, a blog is also required,
and Google is currently requiring a certain level
of feed distribution to qualify (as of this writing;
it could change). In other words, if you can’t
demonstrate that more people beyond your
mother and best friend read your blog, you
might not be accepted. Eventually, though, I
expect AdSense for feeds to be as open as
AdSense. To apply, go here:
services.google.com/ads_inquiry
/aff

Here are the important points to remember:
 Vanity sites are not allowed. Generally speaking this is true, but with
important exceptions. Confused yet? Well, AdSense eligibility is not an
exact science. The site should convey information beyond the strictly
personal. Pages devoted to photos of your college buddies will probably
not make the cut. But a hobby page about Civil War reenactments cer-
tainly would be admitted. AdSense sites don’t have to be commercial,
but they must contain content of some substance. Weblogs have added
an interesting twist, because any blog is likely to vary greatly in quality
from page to page, and entry to entry. Many blogs run AdSense. I haven’t
heard any complaints of rejection from bloggers. However, you need to
control the code of your blog pages, so hosted solutions that prevent
direct access to the page’s HTML code do not provide an AdSense
opportunity.
 Keep it appropriate. The usual rules apply to your content, the same as
you’re likely to see on any hosting service. Google’s guidelines prohibit
running AdSense on sites that promote illegal behavior, pornography, or
gambling. Excessive profanity can be a problem. Espousing hate and vio-
lence can get the site in trouble. Avoid copyright infringement.
 Keep the site functioning. All links must work. The site itself must be
available to visitors without undue delay. If Google can’t crawl the site
after you apply to AdSense, the site will be rejected.
 Don’t mention the ads. This is important: Do not reference the AdSense
ads in your page content. Do not plead with your visitors to click them.
Do not click the ads yourself. (More on this last point later.) Do not offer
incentives to click ads. Simply do not talk about the ads at all. You prob-
ably get what Google is driving at here. Google’s advertisers need to
know that clickthroughs derive from genuine interest in the ad, not from
coercion. The advertiser is paying for each clickthrough, so each one
must be legitimate. If you dilute the quality of your clickthroughs and
Google detects it (yes, it has ways), Google will cut you off like a stern
bartender at closing time.
The quickest way to get kicked out of AdSense is to click your own ads. You
might be tempted. Each click earns you money, and who’s to know? Google
knows. Click fraud is a serious topic in search advertising, and Google takes
serious measures to detect it and remedy it. Don’t click any ads that appear
on your pages. Don’t tell your friends to click them. Don’t tell your site visi-
tors to click them. Generating fraudulent clicks is considered a heinous 
abuse of the AdSense system, unworthy of lenience or second chances. 
Out you would go.

Part V: The Business of Google 

Getting Started: Opening 
an AdSense Account
The first step in becoming an AdSense publisher (besides owning a Web site)
is applying for and starting an AdSense account. Opening the account doesn’t
obligate you in any way and doesn’t cost a dime. In fact, nothing about
AdSense ever costs anything.
You don’t need to provide credit card information to join the AdSense network,
but you must supply tax information so Google can pay you. That information
consists of your EIN (Employer Identification Number) or Social Security
number. Most people don’t have an EIN, so they provide the SS number.
If Google doesn’t know you through AdWords (if you are not a Google advertiser
in that program), you must apply for an AdSense account. The application
process is brief, but the acceptance process can sometimes stretch out for a
few days. (Getting in is sometimes much quicker. It’s unpredictable.) If you’re
an AdWords advertiser, your AdSense account becomes verified immediately.
To get going, follow these steps:
1. Go to the AdSense page here:
www.google.com/adsense
2. Click the Click Here to Apply button.
3. Fill in the Email address and Password boxes, and then click the
Continue button.
If you have an AdWords account, you can use that information here. If
not, create a password; it may be the same password you’ve used for
other Google accounts, such as Gmail or Google Groups. For this series
of steps, I assume you do not have an AdWords account.
4. Use the radio buttons to choose whether you are the sole proprietor 
of your business or will be entering an EIN. Then click the Continue
button.
5. Fill in all the contact information on the displayed page, and then
click the Submit button.
Google sends a verification e-mail to the address you supply.
291
Chapter 18: Rescuing Your Revenue with Google AdSense

6. Open the verification e-mail from Google and click the supplied link.
This step is a standard verification process and lets Google determine
that you are real. If you are not real, it’s probably time you came to grips
with that.
7. Wait for Google’s acceptance e-mail.
When you receive the acceptance, you can log in to AdSense with the
password you chose in Step 3.
You may publish AdSense ads on more than one site. I don’t mean multiple
pages within a site; I mean multiple domain names. If that is your intent, you
must still open just one AdSense account. If you start a new account for each
site and Google connects the dots between them, Google might close all your
accounts. Use reporting channels (covered later in this chapter) to keep
track of AdSense results across different pages and sites.
Useful AdSense Terms to Know
After your AdSense account is active, your AdSense experience will be
clearer, and this chapter will make more sense if you’re familiar with several
important terms. Either read through this section or refer to it as needed.
Ad layout: An ad configuration for AdSense publishers. Google offers ten ad
layouts; you can choose horizontal or vertical layouts containing one, two,
four, or five ads. AdSense publishers can’t alter the configuration of ads
within the bars and banners that constitute ad layouts, but they may change
the colors in which text and borders are displayed.
Ad unit: One set of AdSense ads displayed in an ad layout.
AdSense code: The snippet of HTML and JavaScript that Webmasters paste
into their pages to begin serving AdWords ads.
AdSense channel: A tracking division that allows AdSense publishers to sep-
arate their revenue statistics according to page, site, ad style, or other distin-
guishing factors.
Alternate ads: AdSense publishers may specify non-Google ad sources for the
space occupied by an ad unit, in preparation for those occasional times when
Google can’t deliver ads. Once specified, the alternate ad source is bundled
into the AdSense code, and the replacement of Google ads by alternate ads
occurs automatically if Google has no relevant ads to serve. (See Chapter 13.)
292
Part V: The Business of Google 

Banner: One type of ad layout. Three banners are available, one vertical and
the other two horizontal. Each banner contains multiple ads.
Button: A type of ad layout that holds a single ad.
Clickthrough rate (CTR): Calculated by dividing the number of clicks by the
number of displays (impressions). AdWords advertisers are charged for
clicks through their ads. AdSense publishers are paid for clicks through the
ads they host, sharing the revenue with Google.
Color palette: Individually adjusted colors for each of five elements in
AdWords ads: headline text, ad text, URL text, border, and background.
Google supplies several preset color palettes.
Content-targeted advertising: The generic name for Google’s distribution of
AdWords ads to AdSense sites. The AdSense network is also known as the
content network. The word content is important in this context because
Google uses its analysis of an AdSense page’s content to determine which ads
should be served on it.
Cost-per-click (CPC): A monetary amount charged by Google, and paid by the
advertiser, when a user clicks through an ad. Advertisers bid for placement by
offering a maximum CPC per keyword; Google charges the minimum amount
beneath that amount (called the actual CPC) required to hold the best possible
page position for the advertiser. (See Chapter 17 for more on this fine point.)
AdSense publishers are paid an undisclosed percentage of the actual CPC.
Cybersquatting: The practice of unfairly capitalizing on ownership of a
domain name that infringes a trademark or copyright. Google doesn’t allow
AdSense publication on a cybersquatting Web page.
Destination URL: An underlying URL in an AdWords ad that specifies the des-
tination of clickthroughs. The destination URL is not necessarily the same as
the URL displayed on the ad (called the display URL). When you set up a URL
filter, the destination URL is blocked (see Chapter 13).
Distribution preference: Set by AdWords advertisers to include, or exclude,
the content network of AdSense sites. AdSense publishers run AdWords ads
only when those advertisers opt to have their ads appear on those publish-
ers’ pages.
Double serving: The practice of placing AdSense code in more than one loca-
tion on a single page. Doing so violates Google’s terms of service and is
grounds for a warning and possibly expulsion from AdSense.
293
Chapter 18: Rescuing Your Revenue with Google AdSense

Image ads: Optional replacements of text ads, image ads are banner adver-
tisements created by some AdWords advertisers and allowed by some
AdSense publishers.
Impressions: Ad displays. AdSense measures and reports the impressions of
all your ad units.
Inline rectangle: A type of ad layout meant to be placed within bodies of
text, not in sidebars. Google offers four configurations of inline rectangles.
Leaderboard: A type of ad layout featuring four AdWords ads arranged hori-
zontally. Leaderboards are designed to be placed at the top of Web pages but
can be placed anywhere on the page.
Public service ad (PSA): Used to fill an AdWords ad before an AdSense site is
crawled for the first time or if topical relevancy can’t be established for some
reason.
Publisher: An AdSense account holder and operator of a content site.
Skyscraper: A vertical arrangement of ads. Two skyscrapers are available;
one holds four ads and one holds five.
Towers: All the vertical ad layouts: two skyscrapers and one vertical banner.
Towers are usually placed on AdSense pages in the sidebars.
Typosquatting: The practice of purchasing and capitalizing on a misspelling
of a prominent domain name, such as googal.com.
URL filter: A means of blocking specific AdWords ads from displaying on an
AdSense site. This feature is normally used to prevent competitors from
advertising on your site and taking away your visitors. Webmasters need to
know the destination URL of any ad to block it. (See Chapter 13.)
Creating Your AdSense Ads
Strictly speaking, you don’t create the ads that appear on your AdSense
pages. The AdWords advertisers create the ads, Google determines which
ones are appropriate for your site, and Google serves the ads to your pages.
Your part in this is to decide what style of ads will appear and make some
color choices. (You also must determine where on your pages the ads will be
placed, but you do that part in your page-designing software, not on the
Google site. This section is about using the AdSense account to create the
code that you insert in your pages.)
294
Part V: The Business of Google 

AdSense is a simple, automated program. You need only place a snippet of
code into your page’s HTML, and then let the ads appear. When your page is
visited and loads into a visitor’s browser, the code reaches into Google and
pulls the appropriate ads onto your page. As with other ad servers, your
page content comes from two locations. The editorial content originates from
your server, and the ads come from Google’s server. This mechanism is invisi-
ble to the visitor, and Google ads load extremely fast, thanks to the absence
of graphics (if you choose to run text ads).
As I walk you through the creation of AdSense code and describe how to
paste that code into your page, you might get the impression that you may
use only one code sample. Far from it! You may use variously altered versions
of the basic code throughout your site — a different layout and different
colors on each page, if you like.
Choosing an ad type and ad layout
When you first visit your AdSense account pages, the Reports section is dis-
played. At the beginning there is nothing to report, so your Reports section is
empty. Start building your AdSense participation by clicking the Ad Settings
tab. Figure 18-3 shows the Ad layout code page of the Ad Settings tab, where
you create the code that will eventually get inserted into your page(s). Many
AdSense publishers return to this page again and again to create different
code snippets for different pages, or to create code that will alter the appear-
ance of ads already running. This page is your workshop for choosing a
layout style (horizontal, vertical, or single-ad), the ad type (text, images, or
links only), and a color combination.
You have two basic choices of ad type:
 Ad unit
 Link unit
Ad units are horizontal, vertical, or single-unit blocks that contain between
one and five text ads. Some (but not all) ad unit designs may also contain
image ads. Look back at Figures 18-1 and 18-2 to see examples of ad units.
Link units contain no text except that contained in the links; they are extremely
compact advertising designs. Link units are less attention-grabbing than ad
units, but they also look less like ads, which might increase their clickthrough
attractiveness on some pages. Figure 18-4 illustrates the several styles of link
unit available.

Part V: The Business of Google 

All ad design possibilities are illustrated at the following page:
www.google.com/adsense/adformats
Choose an ad layout style that fits your page, but remember that no decision
is ever carved in stone. You may change ad styles anytime. Experimentation is
often necessary to find the right style. Furthermore, “the right style” is partly
determined by observing which styles generate more clickthroughs. Finally,
some Webmasters change styles periodically simply to freshen up their pages
and to combat “ad blindness” — the tendency of frequent site visitors to block
out ads if they know where they are and what they look like. When you do
change an ad style, remember that making the settings on this page is not, by
itself, going to do it. You must clip the resulting code and insert it in your Web
page. (The code resulting from your selections on this page is presented at the
bottom of the page. You can’t see it in Figure 18-3; scroll down to find it.)
Overall, you want to strike a balance between attracting attention to your ads
and irritating your visitors. If you overwhelm the page with large ad units or
banners, you might achieve nothing more than driving away your visitors. In
that case, you might retain your traffic and get better clickthrough rates with
link units, inconspicuous as they are.
If you choose ad units, not link units, you face another choice. Do you want to
run text ads, image ads, or both? If you choose both, Google will unpredictably
send both; you’ll never know which type of ad will appear on any given page
view. Image ads fit into only certain ad unit designs: leaderboard, banner, sky-
scraper, medium rectangle, and wide skyscraper.
After choosing an ad type, select your layout. The choices available to you in
this second portion of the Ad layout code page are determined by what you
selected for an ad type. Use the pull-down menu to see the available selections.
Click the View samples link to see illustrations of all selections.
Choosing colors
If you chose Image ads only as your ad type, you don’t get to choose colors.
Sorry. Spend this free time overcoming your bitterness; nobody likes a sour-
puss. The rest of you: pay attention.
AdSense color palettes determine the hues of the ad unit’s border, the back-
ground color, and the colors of the text, title, and URL. Click any preset com-
bination in the scrollable color palette list to see the resulting combination
next to the list. Each time you select a preset combination, the HTML code at
the bottom of the page changes to reflect that change. When you make a final
(for now) selection, you need do nothing to lock it in; the HTML code has
incorporated your choice.
297
Chapter 18: Rescuing Your Revenue with Google AdSense

Click the Manage color palettes link to have more control of the color of each
element. Figure 18-5 shows how this works; you pinpoint a hue for the border,
background, text, title, and URL.
At this point, having selected an ad type, an ad layout, and a color combina-
tion, you’ve done everything you need to do before clipping the code, placing
it in your page’s HTML, and sitting back and waiting for the big bucks to roll
in — that is to say, watching ads appear on your pages and hoping that over
time you’ll earn a bit of extra cash. So . . . clip the code! Do this:
1. Scroll down to the bottom of the Ad layout code page.
2. Click anywhere in the Your AdSense code box.
3. Press Ctrl+A.
Doing so selects and highlights all the text in the box. Using the keyboard
combination is safer than dragging the mouse, which risks missing a bit
of highlighting.
4. Press Ctrl+C.
Doing this copies the code to the Windows clipboard.

298

5. Press Ctrl+V to paste the code into your Web page’s HTML source code.
Before pasting, position the mouse cursor at the position in your page’s
source document that will properly place the ad on the finished page.
AdSense Channels and AdSense Reports
AdSense gives you one hundred channels for tracking the effectiveness of
your AdSense publishing. A channel allows you to gather ad units into distinct
reporting groups. Say you have two sites residing at two different domains.
Each site can be assigned a channel, enabling you to track earnings of the two
properties separately. Now imagine that you have one site containing fifty
pages; you may use channels to individually track the effectiveness of ads on
each of those fifty pages. One more mental exercise: Imagine you have five
hundred pages in your site, and you plan to run an AdSense ad unit at the top
and bottom of each page. You may assign all the top-of-page ad units to one
channel, and assign the bottom units to a second channel, letting you track
the effectiveness of top and bottom placement across the entire site.
Each AdSense channel is defined by shared code. That’s the HTML code you
snip and clip into your page. If you select a channel on the Ad layout code
page while selecting your ad layout and color scheme, that channel selection
gets embedded in the code. That single line of code enables Google to track
the performance of those ad units separately from differently coded ad units.
Creating a new channel is as easy as naming it, which you do on the Channels
page under the Ad Settings tab in your AdSense account. Google suggests that
you name your channels with URLs, but doing so is not necessary and doesn’t
make sense if one page contains ad units belonging to two different channels.
After you have created (named) one or more channels, those channels
appear in the drop-down menu next to Channel on the Ad layout code page.
When creating your code (ad type, ad layout, and colors), also select a chan-
nel. That channel selection gets embedded in the code, and any ad unit
resulting from that pasted code, anywhere on your site, is reported in that
channel.
AdSense reports break down the number of impressions (displays), the
number of clicks, the clickthrough rate, earnings, and other information. The
presentation is fairly flexible. You can sort the information by day, time
period, and channel. AdSense rules prevent me from showing a report with
actual numbers in it, but Figure 18-6 shows the Ad Performance page in the
Reports tab with no performance data displayed.
299
Chapter 18: Rescuing Your Revenue with Google AdSense

Removing Ads and Exiting the Program
Just as adding new pages and sites is hassle-free, Google puts up no barriers
to exiting the AdSense program or reducing your involvement with it. AdSense
is entirely configurable on this point; you may publish ads on one page of a
large site, on all pages, on some pages, or across as many domains as you
deem productive.
Simply remove the AdSense code from any page that you want to be ad-free.
Removing a page from the program doesn’t penalize other pages or change
the quality of ads delivered to your pages. To stop your involvement with
AdSense altogether, dump all the code. There’s no way to close your AdSense
account, nor is there any need to. It remains there, in case you decide to pub-
lish ads again in the future.
When you remove AdSense code, remember to adjust your page code to fill
the hole you’ve just ripped in it. If you created a table cell to hold your ad
unit, for example, eliminate the cell or put something else in it.

The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
T
he book draws to a reluctant close here. Unless you’ve
come to this part first, in which case . . . well, hi! Do
you walk backwards, too? Actually, I often start reading a
For Dummies book with The Part of Tens.
This part contains two chapters that will open your eyes
to new ways of Googling. Google freely gives away its most
valuable asset: access to its index. The result is a host of
alternate Google sites that deliver the same search results
as Google.com but through a variety of different interfaces.
The TouchGraph browser described in Chapters 19 and 20
will twist your mind into a new perspective on the living
network surrounding every Web site. Chapter 21 lightens
the intensely determined mood in which most of us
search by presenting online games based on poking the
Google index in new ways. You would never think the
Googlebeast was so playful. Chapter 22 is devoted to sites
about Google: Weblogs and resource sites that are both
praiseful and critical.
If you read this book from start to finish, these pages will
top off the renovation of your Googling mindset. If you’re
reading this book out of order, perhaps the items in these
chapters will motivate you to explore other chapters.
Either way, drink plenty of coffee and remember: Don’t let
an entire day happen without Google. [Editors’ note: Brad
has slipped into a fitful slumber, tormented by caffeine-
generated dreams of battling the ferocious thrashing ten-
tacles of the Google index. We pity him and hope for
regained coherence before he writes his next book.]

ost of this chapter, and the next, strays outside Google, yet remains
within. Googles have sprouted up all over the place, delivering authen-
tic Google results from search pages that don’t look much like Google. These
alternative Google interfaces are not endorsed by Google, for the most part,
and don’t enjoy any official relationship with Google, the company. But every
search engine described in this chapter enjoys a close relationship with the
Google index, which disgorges its treasures to any developer with the know-
how to program into it.
Think of this chapter as a big, unofficial Google Labs, whose experiments are
transpiring on the desktops of individuals and small companies. We, the lucky
users, get to try them out. And let me tell you something startling: A few of
these things are better than the original in certain ways. Google’s innovative
power resides in the index and the intelligence algorithms that power it. But
as an interface design company, Google is more efficient than elegant, more
brusque than thorough. If these characteristics can be called weak spots,
they represent an opening for resourceful programmers.

For this chapter and the next I selected sites that are free to use, mostly easy,
and worth whatever small efforts are required to use them. Some of these
alternative Googles concentrate on delivering a single Google service better
(or differently) than Google does. A few rope together many of Google’s
engines into a single glorious interface.
Onward, then, into realms of Googleness that you never dreamed of!
Bare-Bones Results
www.google.com/ie
You wouldn’t think Google could be simplified. The home page is spare to the
point of being stark, with no ads or miscellaneous graphics whatsoever. But
there is room to make it simpler still, by removing the Images, Groups,
Directory, and News tabs. Then strip away the links to Advanced Search,
Preferences, and Language Tools. And get rid of the miscellaneous corporate
links. Finally, clear out everything on the search results page except the
target site links — no descriptions, ads, summaries, or anything else.
This first destination in a mostly non-Google chapter is an official Google page.
But it’s one that Google doesn’t promote, and in that sense it’s an alternative
search experience.
Figure 19-1 shows what a search looks like through this interface. You don’t
get much information, but you also don’t get a heavy page load. This point is
important if you have your Preferences set to deliver one hundred hits per
results page (see Chapter 2).
This simplified search format supports the search operators described in
Chapter 2 and the specialized operators explained in other chapters. Basically,
you can conduct any search on this page that you can on the regular Google
home page. The phone book and dictionary described in Chapter 3 work
here, too.
Run your mouse cursor over the compact results to see a snippet from each
target page in a small pop-up blurb. This tip works in compact search results
in other sites, too.

Finding the Freshest Google
www.researchbuzz.com/goofresh.shtml
Google is not particularly strong at letting you determine the freshness of
search results. The vagueness surrounding page freshness is due to several
reasons:
 Google uses more than spiders to crawl the Web, and more than one
type of spider. (See Chapter 16 for more about spiders and Web crawl-
ing.) These crawlers operate at different speeds and different depths. It’s
possible for a newly created Web page to go undetected by one crawl
and then turn up in the index two weeks later after a deeper crawl.
 Google uses more than one server (Internet computer) to deliver search
results. The servers are not perfectly synchronized. At any moment, one
server might give slightly different search results from another server.
 The freshness of a page is determined by the time it was created, or the
time it was added to Google’s index, or both.
Figure 19-1:
A bare-
bones
search
result.
305
Chapter 19: Ten Alternative Googles

Google does enable a certain degree of freshness filtering on the Advanced
Search page in a Web search. (An advanced search in Google Groups lets you
specify dates because newsgroup posts are dated more precisely than Web
pages. See Chapter 6.) On the Advanced Search page, you can ask for Web
pages updated within the past three months, six months, or year. These large
time frames are safe for Google because the three variables just listed cause
confusion only within time periods shorter than three months.
An alternate Google engine called GooFresh invites you to fine-tune the fresh-
ness setting by drastically narrowing the time frame. GooFresh accomplishes
the time-narrowing trick by using the daterange operator. I don’t discuss this
operator much in this book because daterange doesn’t understand dates for-
matted in a typical fashion — month, day, and year. Google understands only
the Julian date system, which involves long and cryptic strings of numbers.
Assuming that your freshness needs aren’t too precise or imperative, GooFresh
is a fine alternative. Figure 19-2 shows the GooFresh page ready to launch a
search. The search results look completely normal and are drastically nar-
rowed compared to an undated search. A recent search for the keyword inter-
net, which normally returns hundreds of thousands of results, yielded only
three when GooFresh looked for pages added on the current day.

306
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Widen your search results by enlarging the time frame. Selecting Today from
the drop-down menu (see Figure 19-2) delivers the fewest results. Also,
because of the restricted time frame, you get better (or, at least, more)
results by using fewer keywords. At the same time, limit your use of opera-
tors, especially when choosing Today or Yesterday. In other words, give
Google some breathing space: Be less demanding in your keywords when
you’re more demanding about the time frame.
GooFresh provides results based on when pages were added to the Google
index, not when the pages were created.
The Amazing TouchGraph
For a truly unusual and stunning graphical representation of Google search
results, dig into this section and get familiar with TouchGraph GoogleBrowser.
TouchGraph uses the Java programming language to create alternative dis-
plays for databases. When you type a URL in TouchGraph, it displays sites
related to the URL — just as if you had clicked the Similar pages link of a
Google search result.
In this section, you first explore TouchGraph GoogleBrowser, which displays
Google’s Related Sites feature (see Chapter 2) in an entirely new way. After
exploring the TouchGraph Google Browser, I discuss a similar site, Google-
set-vista, created by different individuals but using the TouchGraph browser
technology.
Visualizing related sites
www.touchgraph.com/TGGoogleBrowser.html
You should understand one thing from the start: TouchGraph GoogleBrowser
does not perform keyword searching. You do not get a visual representation of
a standard Google search here. The TouchGraph system is all about displaying
related items (Web pages, in this case). In a keyword search, all the hits relate
in the same way: They match the keywords. TouchGraph reveals constella-
tions of sites surrounding the related sites, and you can extend the model out-
ward again and again. This type of multiple-universe display doesn’t lend itself
to straight keyword matching, but I hope to be proven wrong very soon.
For now, though, go to TouchGraph to see URL relationships that aren’t easily
apparent in a long list of text links — and for the sheer delight of playing with
one of the coolest Java interfaces around.
307
Chapter 19: Ten Alternative Googles

When typing the TouchGraph GoogleBrowser URL in your browser, note the
uppercase letters in TGGoogleBrowser. Because they are part of a filename
(not part of a domain name), they must be typed exactly as they appear here.
Otherwise, the page will not load. And your computer will explode. (Sorry,
my inner demons made me say that.)
TouchGraph requires a certain Java component called a plug-in (specifically,
Java plug-in 1.3). Fortunately, you don’t need to know whether you have that
component; if you don’t, the site tells you and helps you get it. So, in blessed
ignorance, hop over to the TouchGraph GoogleBrowser site, type a URL in
the search box, and click the Graph it! button.
A URL consists of three parts separated by periods: the www part, the domain
part (often the name of the site or a company), and the domain extension part
(such as .com or .org). An example, pulled randomly from the millions of Web
URLs, would be:
www.bradhill.com
TouchGraph GoogleBrowser allows elimination of the www part, just like
most Web browsers do. But don’t leave off the extension.
If you don’t have the Java plug-in 1.3 component, a Security Warning window
pops open, asking whether you want to install and run Java plug-in 1.3. The
required Java plug-in is free of charge and third-party hassles. It’s a safe
download and installs easily with the assistance of a few mouse clicks on
your part. TouchGraph GoogleBrowser is one good reason to get the 1.3 plug-
in, but not the only reason: If you surf a reasonable amount, you’re bound to
find other sites that use it.
On some computers, the download proceeds without the Security Warning
pop-up, but that is rare. Assuming you do get the Security Warning window,
proceed as follows:
1. In the Security Warning box, click the Yes button.
The plug-in is more than 5 megabytes in size, so if you’re using a dial-up
telephone modem, now is a good time to brew a double mochaccino.
After the download, an autoinstallation program runs.
2. In the Select Java Plugin Installation window, choose a locale and
region, and then select Install.
3. In the License Agreement page, click the Yes button.
It’s always a good idea to read the terms before agreeing. In this case, I
doubt you’ll find anything objectionable.
308
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

4. In the Choose Destination Location window, click the Next button.
Use the Browse button if you want to change the default location of the
Java plug-in. I don’t see much point to changing it — this isn’t a stand-
alone application that you access outside the browser.
5. In the Select Browsers window, check one or more boxes and click the
Next button.
There’s no harm in selecting all listed browsers, but at least select the
browser you’re currently using.
At this point the Java plug-in installs. After a few seconds, the installation
program disappears, and you’re returned to the TouchGraph browser
window. This window is a new one, leaving your original window anchored at
the TouchGraph Web site.
This rigmarole might seem like a lot of work to experience an alternate
Google, but it’s worth it. And I should emphasize that many browsers have
the necessary Java plug-in. If the site doesn’t tell you that anything is missing,
you’re good to go; ignore the preceding instruction list.

Chapter 19: Ten Alternative Googles

The TouchGraph display is interactive. As you run the mouse over its screen,
two things happen to indicate relationships between sites (called nodes in
the TouchGraph system):
 The strands connecting nodes light up when a strand or a node is
touched by the mouse cursor.
 When you touch a node, the node label expands to show the full site title
(as long as the node label is in URL or Point mode, as I describe a bit later),
and the strands between the touched node and its related nodes light up.
Pink strands indicate outgoing links. Blue strands indicate incoming links.
A small green info button also appears above any mouse-touched node
label. Click that button to see more information about the site.
You may click and drag any node. You must try this, in fact, — it’s fun to see
the entire web of related sites shift, like a living being, to accommodate the
dragged node’s movement.
Figure 19-4 shows lighted strands of relatedness and the information window
that opens when you click the info button of the expanded label. The informa-
tion window contains some of what you’d get in a regular Google search result,
without the capability to display a cached page. Because the TouchGraph dis-
play is all about showing similar pages, there’s no link to display similar pages.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 

You can order up a new constellation of related sites around any node on the
graph by simply double-clicking the node. When you do, a small red tab pops
up from the node, titled 0-10. TouchGraph receives the first ten results from
Google and displays them. If you double-click that node again, the red pop-up
reads 11-20, and so on for every double-click. Keep doing this, or move from
node to node opening new clusters of relatedness, and you can end up with a
seething mass of nodes and connecting strands (see Figure 19-5).
The display of node clusters might extend beyond the window, especially on
small monitors or screens running low resolutions, such as 800 x 600. The
illustrations in this section were taken on an 800 x 600 screen and, as you can
see, the TouchGraph strands reach out beyond the window’s boundaries. My
larger screens aren’t big enough either, after I start double-clicking nodes.
Notice the scroll bars at the bottom and right edges of the TouchGraph
browser. Use them to scroll from side to side, and up and down.
Use the Zoom bar in the TouchGraph toolbar to pull back, getting all your
node clusters into view. Figure 19-6 shows a zoomed-out screen with all
nodes labeled as points instead of titles or URLs. Note the radio buttons in
the TouchGraph toolbar with those choices. The point labels display the first
two letters of the site’s title. Run your mouse cursor over any abbreviated
node to see its title.

stellations

Chapter 19: Ten Alternative Googles

Other control features of the toolbar follow:
 Back: The Back button highlights the previously highlighted node.
 Add URL: Use this search box to launch a new search. If you don’t click
the Clear button first, TouchGraph puts the new search results right on
top of the old graph. There might be no relatedness whatsoever between
the two sets of results, in which case the graph holds them both with no
connecting strands between the two sets of constellations.
 Node label shows: Use the options here to determine how the node
labels appear. The Title setting creates the most cluttered display. The
URL setting shortens most node labels a bit. The Point setting displays
only the first two letters of the site title and is great when the screen
gets packed with nodes. Run your mouse cursor over the nodes in URL
or Point mode to see their titles.
 Number of lines: Note the drop-down menu whose default selection
reads 3 Lines. Use it to select 1 Line, 2 Lines, 3 Lines, or All Lines; these
choices determine the number of text lines appearing in TouchGraph
node labels; some titles and URLs are quite lengthy, and you might not
want to see the node labels stretched to accommodate them.

 Back Color: Click one colored box to change the graph’s background
color. If you stare at this thing for as long as I do, the change of hue
relieves the eyes.
 Clear: Beware of this button. It clears the entire screen, potentially
wiping out a long session of playing around . . . I mean, of productive
searching.
 Advanced: This button toggles the advanced controls on and off.
 Show Singles: When checked, this feature expands the node clusters by
displaying those nodes with only a single link to the central URL in addi-
tion to the nodes with multiple links to the central URL. Uncheck this
box to reduce screen clutter.
 Radius: This setting determines the number of edges surrounding the
URL you’ve searched. Reducing the number lowers the number of
related constellations around your main cluster.
 Show first: This option determines how many search results are dis-
played. I usually keep this set to All, greedy searcher that I am.
 Min Inbound: The lower this number, the more numerous your results.
The default setting is 0. The setting determines the minimum number of
incoming links a site must offer to register on the graph. When no incom-
ing links exist from one site to another, Google sometimes assigns relat-
edness based on other factors in the index.
In addition to being insanely fun, TouchGraph GoogleBrowser provides a
good way to find new Web destinations of interest. When you click an info
tab, the pop-up box always displays a link to that Web site, and clicking that
link opens a new browser window for that site.
The next section discusses the same TouchGraph technology as applied to
Google Sets.
Visual keyword sets
www.langreiter.com/space/google-set-vista
Keyword sets are discussed in Chapter 11. One of Google’s technology experi-
ments open to the public, Google Sets are collections of related keywords.
Type one or more words (presumably related in some way), and Google finds
many other words related in the same way. (Reminiscent of the standardized
tests you took in high school, isn’t it? Don’t panic. You’re not being graded.)
Google Sets provides a perfect application for TouchGraph viewing, which
specializes in showing relatedness. Launching the TouchGraph viewer and
313
Chapter 19: Ten Alternative Googles

installing the Java plug-in are identical here as with TouchGraph GoogleBrowser,
described in the preceding section. If you installed the Java plug-in 1.3 com-
ponent for GoogleBrowser, you don’t need to install it again here (or ever
again at any site).
This Google Sets tool, created by Christian Langreiter, is called google-set-
vista. Easy as it is to use, it differs in important ways from TouchGraph
GoogleBrowser and from the Google Sets home page at Google. Follow these
steps to get started:
1. On the google-set-vista home page, type a word in the box marked Term.
Type not a search keyword but a word or phrase that will generate
related words. The results are not Web pages; they’re groups of words or
names. It is important that you start with either just one word or a
phrase — not unrelated words. Google lets you enter several related
words, but google-set-vista doesn’t understand multiple words and
thinks they’re one big hybrid word.
2. Click the Set me some! button.
The site activates the Java applet (which takes a few seconds) and dis-
plays results (see Figure 19-7). Notice that google-set-vista displays the
TouchGraph viewer within the browser rather than opening a special
window.
Figure 19-7:

set-vista in

Einstein, the
name of a
music
group.
314
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

The google-set-vista tool makes substantial changes to the TouchGraph
viewer as deployed in GoogleBrowser. The basic display is the same, in that
you can grab a node (a word in this case, not a Web site) and drag it around,
pulling the whole set with it. The strands connecting words do not behave
with the same color-coded responsiveness as in GoogleBrowser, naturally,
because a Google Set has no incoming and outgoing links. The same scroll
bars are found along the bottom and right edges, for viewing portions of a
large array of sets.
There’s no Clear button in google-set-vista, as there is in GoogleBrowser. 
Nor is there an entry box. So, you can neither clear the screen of its current
search nor launch a new search within the TouchGraph window. To start a
new search, click your browser’s Back button, returning to the google-set-vista
home page. Unfortunately, this process requires a reload of the Java applet
with each new search. (That’s not the same as downloading Java plug-in 1.3,
which you do only once. Loading the applet takes just a few seconds.)
As in GoogleBrowser, google-set-vista nodes can be expanded. Simply double-
click any node to create a set around that word. It’s interesting to see how
two sets are connected — in other words, which words belong to both sets.
Continue expanding nodes repeatedly to get a complex web of Google Set
connections (see Figure 19-8).

Chapter 19: Ten Alternative Googles

The Zoom bar atop the google-set-vista viewer has three functions, only one
of which is displayed and functional at any time. Set the function of the Zoom
bar with the drop-down menu to its left. Its three functions are
 Zoom: Set the slider here to zoom in and out of your field of nodes.
 Rotate: Handily, you can use the slider to rotate the entire network of
nodes. Doing so can bring a partially hidden field into view without
zooming.
 Locality: This is where I normally keep the scroll bar set. Moving the
Locality slider to the left folds the node groups into themselves, one by
one, simplifying the screen. Moving it to the right expands the node clus-
ters again, revealing all connections.
When I first encountered google-set-vista, I thought it was a poor second
cousin to TouchGraph GoogleBrowser. My prejudice was due partly to my
disaffection for Google Sets, which seemed like one of the more boring
Google Labs experiments, and partly because google-sets-vista didn’t have all
the toolbar bells and whistles of GoogleBrowser. I quickly changed my mind,
though, and now I turn to the two TouchGraph sites equally. The google-set-
vista tool refreshed my attitude about Google Sets, which I now use often as a
way of discovering new bands, books, movies, and ideas. But I never use the
official Google interface — only google-set-vista. I only wish the right-click
menu included a Search option for launching a Google keyword search.
Google by E-mail
www.google.com/alerts
If you repeatedly search Google with the same keyword strings, you might
wish for a way of receiving search results without having to visit Google
every day, or week, or however frequently you remember to repeat the
search. Google recently launched a service that provides updates to previ-
ously seen search results for your keyword or keyword string. The updates
are delivered as e-mails. Furthermore, because repeated search queries are
often news-oriented, Google offers the choice of repeatedly search Google
News, or Google Web, or both.
Figure 19-9 shows the Google Alerts page. You do not need a Google account
to sign up for a Google Alert, but having an account, and signing in to it, enables
better management of your alerts. You can set up multiple alerts, each with
its own frequency (from a list of three choices), source (Web, News, or both),
and — naturally — its own keyword or string.
316
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

If you don’t have a Google account, simply fill in the fields shown in Figure
19-9, and click the Create Alert button. Google sends you a verification e-mail.
When you click the verification link in that e-mail, Google accepts your alert
and starts sending them to that e-mail address at your specified frequency.
If you do have a Google account, click the Sign in to manage your alerts link
near the bottom of the Google Alerts home page (shown in Figure 19-9). After
signing in on the next page, you see a page resembling Figure 19-10. There,
you can define new alerts, change the features of existing alerts, and delete
existing alerts. Use the pull-down menus to set the alert source (Type) and
frequency (How often).
Google Ultimate Interface
Google offers advanced search pages in most of its engines. But the Web-
search advanced page lacks power, as anyone would agree after seeing
Google Ultimate Interface and Soople (see Chapter 20). In a reasonably con-
cise format, the Google Ultimate Interface reaches into the Google index with
Figure 19-9:

317
Chapter 19: Ten Alternative Googles

exceptional flexibility. If this page were represented on the Google Toolbar,
you’d probably use it routinely as your primary Google interface. In fact, you
might use this page every day even though it’s absent from the Toolbar. For a
quick, darting search, it doesn’t make sense. But when you want nearly all of
Google gathered onto a single page, the Google Ultimate Interface site lives
up to its name.
Google Ultimate Interface is located here:
www.faganfinder.com/google.html
The preceding address is for the Internet Explorer browser. If you’re using
Firefox or Netscape, go here:
www.faganfinder.com/google2.html
Figure 19-11 shows Google Ultimate Interface in its default state. This view is
just one of the available forms. You’re two clicks away from equally impres-
sive forms for launching searches into Google Groups, Images, Directory,
Answers, Glossary, Froogle — nearly every Google engine documented in 
this book.

The following points discuss the important features of the Web search form
shown in Figure 19-11. Advanced features that duplicate Google’s Advanced
Search page in a Web search are described in Chapter 2:
 Scope: Use the upper-right drop-down menu (shown in Figure 19-11 with
all as a default setting) to select compact results, one of the specialty
searches introduced in Chapter 9, or even a specific Google server.
 File Format: Use these menus to include or exclude certain file formats.
 Window: Use the Open Results In menu to choose whether to open a
new window for search results or use the original window. I strongly rec-
ommend using a new window, especially because using the Back button
to retrace your steps from the search results page is sluggish. (The com-
plex and form-intensive search page takes time to reload.)
 Date: This feature seals the deal. The Google Ultimate Interface is where
you come for easy, intuitive date-range Web searching. The top menu
(labeled in the last) duplicates the broad ranges Google provides on its
Advanced Search page. For more precision, click the between option and
use the drop-down menus to determine a date range within which your
search results must fall.

Chapter 19: Ten Alternative Googles

 Country and Language: Google’s Advanced Search page provides a lan-
guage setting but not a country setting. (Both settings are included in
Google Ultimate Interface.)
 Duplicates Filter: Use this menu to toggle Google’s filter for removing
duplicate and near-duplicate search results.
 Keyboard: In a fantastic, even show-offy stunt, Google Ultimate Interface
provides special characters to include in your search string. Click any
one of them, and it appears in the keyword box. This feature is great
when searching for pages in some non-English languages.
This interface reaches into the Google engine, of course, so search results are
identical to those in a standard Google search.
When searching within a date range, Google can determine only when a Web
page was added to its index, not when the page was created. There can be a
lag of weeks between the two dates.
Now look at that Web menu below the search box. Pull it down to choose one
of Google’s other search engines. Click a selection, and Google Ultimate
Interface changes its configuration, becoming an advanced search page for
that search engine.
For basic, thorough searching, Google Ultimate Interface is the site in this
chapter that should be taken most seriously. I find it indispensable.
GAPS, GARBO, and GAWSH
That section title should get your attention. The GAPS, GARBO, and GAWSH
search engines are presented by the same site and provide three distinct
search experiences, each valuable in its own fashion.
If you have a Google license key (see the “Getting the Google license key”
sidebar), have it handy as you cruise among the sites in this section. Very few
alternate Googles insist on a bring-your-own-license policy, but some request
that you “pay” your own way, and others surreptitiously position an entry
box for the key number with the hope that you’ll use it. Be polite to other
users and put your searches on your own key’s quota, thereby saving the
site from burning quickly through its own quota and shutting down until the
next day.
Unlike too many alternative Google sites, this one provides detailed explana-
tions of its features. Click the Read Me link on the GAPS, GARBO or GAWSH
pages to get some help with the particular engine. The following sections
convey the basics, certainly enough to get you started.
320
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

321
Chapter 19: Ten Alternative Googles
Getting the Google license key
Google offers a free license to software devel-
opers to access the Google Web index. This
license enables alternate Google sites to deliver
Google search results through new interfaces.
Developers download a software kit that
includes the Google Web API (Application
Programming Interface). An API is necessary
whenever one program or Web site hooks into
a necessary underlying system, such as Google
or the Windows operating system. If your com-
puter runs Windows, every application program
you have uses the Windows API. Similarly,
every alternate Google interface uses the
Google API.
Developers using the Google API also must
obtain a Google license key, which is used
every time somebody conducts a search
through the alternate site. If Google doesn’t
“see” the license key (which is just a string of
letters and numbers), it will not perform the
search.
All this might seem irrelevant if you’re not 
planning to develop a new Google search site.
But anybody can get a license key, even people
with no intent to program. The license key is
separate from the developer’s kit. And it’s a
good idea — even good manners — to own a
free license key. The reason is that each license
key allows the owner a certain number of
searches per day. That number is currently set
at 1000, which might seem like a lot. But in a
public site, a daily quota of 1000 searches can
be used up quickly, disabling the site for other
users until the next day. So many sites in this
chapter provide a space for entering your
license key. By doing so, you “pay” for your own
searches out of your quota. (All this is com-
pletely free of charge, of course.)
You don’t need to download a developer’s kit to
get the license key; you merely need to create a
Google account in the Web APIs section. Follow
these steps:
1. Go to the Google Web APIs page here:
www.google.com/apis
2. Scroll down to Step 2, Create a Google
Account, and click the create a Google
Account link.
3. Enter an e-mail address and password, and
then type the word verification.
If you’ve already created a Google account
for Google Answers (see Chapter 10) or
Google Groups (see Chapter 6), click the
Sign in here link at the bottom of the page
and use the username and password 
you established then. You must sign in (or
create a new account) from the Google
Web APIs page before Google sends you a
license key.
4. Click the “I have read and agree to the
Terms of Use. Create my account.” button.
If you create a new account this way, or if you
sign in to an existing Google account through
the Web APIs page, Google sends your license
key to your e-mail address. The e-mail includes
the Terms of Service for the Web API program,
which are distinct from the Terms of Service you
(presumably) read and agreed to when creating
a Google account.
The license key contains more than thirty char-
acters, so obviously you shouldn’t try to memo-
rize it. Keep it in a safe place in your computer,
ready to copy and paste into alternate Google
sites that request it.

Proximity searching with GAPS
www.staggernation.com/cgi-bin/gaps.cgi
Google API Proximity Search (GAPS) invites you to search for two keywords
that occur within a certain proximity. This tool strikes a useful middle ground
between two extremes: keywords that might be located anywhere on the
page, and keywords located directly next to each other, as in the case of an
exact phrase. Putting the keywords close to each other but not necessarily
next to each other encourages relevance without the restriction of an exact
phrase. Figure 19-12 shows the GAPS form.
Follow these steps to design and launch a GAPS search:
1. In the Find search boxes, type a single keyword in each box.
2. Use the drop-down menu between the keyword boxes to select a 
proximity range.
The GAPS engine is currently limited to finding keyword pairs separated
by no more than three intervening words. Google doesn’t insist on this
limitation, but GAPS enforces it to contain search results.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 

3. In the first drop-down menu, choose In either order.
The alternate choice, In that order, reduces results by forcing Google to
match your first and second keywords in that order.
4. In the next drop-down menu, choose Sort by ranking.
Ranking is Google’s assessment of relevance. You may also sort by URL,
page title, and keyword proximity. It’s easy to reset the search parame-
ters after you see the results.
5. In the Additional terms box, type any other keyword that you want as
part of the search string.
Here you may use operators, exact phrases, and multiple keywords.
6. In the Show menu, select how many results you would like overall.
I leave this setting in its default All state.
7. In the next drop-down menu, choose how many results should be
listed for each query.
This might seem confusing. With a proximity search using these fea-
tures, you’re forcing Google to perform multiple searches, one for each
combination of keyword order and proximity. The two keywords can be
three words apart, two words apart, one word apart, or next to each
other — and furthermore, they could match any of those conditions
with their order reversed. This setting determines how many search
results you see for each of those distinct searches.
8. Click the Filter each query option.
This setting refers to Google’s duplicate filter, which eliminates multiple
hits from the same site.
9. Click the Search button.
GAPS displays results in normal fashion, with no separation of individual
searches. Your sorting option determines how the results are ordered.
Conveniently, GAPS reproduces the entire search form atop the search
results page, so you can modify your parameters or launch a new search
without backtracking.
You may use the exact phrase (quotes) operator in either of the two proxim-
ity keyword boxes. Google treats the phrase as a single keyword that must
exist within a certain proximity to the other keyword. The two keywords 
can both be phrases, for that matter. I like doing that to search for articles
about two closely paired public figures. Try searching this way for “Carrie
Underwood” and “Bo Bice,” the two most recent (as of this writing) American
Idol winners.

Chapter 19: Ten Alternative Googles

Relation browsing with GARBO
www.staggernation.com/garbo/
The GARBO engine performs the same sort of search as TouchGraph
GoogleBrowser, described previously in this chapter — namely, searching 
for sites related to a certain Web domain. Google API Relation Browsing
Outliner (GARBO) adds a twist by also enabling you to search for sites that
link to a certain page (using Google’s link operator). Instead of displaying
results in an interactive graphical spread, GARBO delivers text results that
are unusually customizable. In fact, the intelligence of the results display
makes GARBO particularly useful.
As with TouchGraph GoogleBrowser, you type a URL, not keywords, 
into GARBO.
The search form, shown in Figure 19-13, contains three main elements:
 Search box: Type a URL here.
 Related pages or linking pages: You can select related pages (Google’s
Similar pages feature) or linking pages (which delivers sites containing
links to your search URL). Google allows one of these searches at a time;
you can’t do both.
 Snippets and URLs: I prefer to keep the search results clean in GARBO,
so I leave both these options unchecked. (Snippets and URLs both
appear in search results derived from Google.com. Snippets are bits of
content containing your keywords from the result site, and the URL is
the result site address.) GARBO then displays a concise and useful
folder-like results page.
The beauty of eliminating snippets and URLs is revealed on the search results
page, which comes up with economical élan. The results look and behave like
a list of folders. Click a triangle next to any item to open it, revealing more
detailed results within.
Engagingly, GARBO encourages secondary searching on the search results
with the View in Google link next to each opened folder when you search
without snippets and URLs. Doing so conducts a relation search (or a link
search, if that’s how you started) on the result URL. That is cool.
324
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Search by host with GAWSH
www.staggernation.com/gawsh/
Rounding out this invaluable trio of alternate Googles is Google API Web
Search by Host (GAWSH). This engine takes the folder approach to results
available in GARBO and makes it the default, irrevocable result format. Here,
you search by keyword (with operators) and get results organized by Web
domain. Each domain in the search results list can be opened, like a folder,
revealing matching pages that come from that site. These revealed inner
results are displayed in traditional Google format, within the opened GAWSH
folder.
GAWSH is not as trivial as its description might sound — or as it might look
when you first visit the search page. The search form consists of nothing
more than a keyword box and a Search button. The action is in the results
page, shown in Figure 19-14. In this screen shot, I expanded one of the folders
to illustrate the mixture of GAWSH formatting and Google formatting.

325
Chapter 19: Ten Alternative Googles

GAWSH is fantastic for bundling essential search result information into a
small space for quick scanning. Most of us prefer getting information from
favorite sites but don’t want to specify those sites every time we search.
GAWSH reveals at a glance which sites have pages matching your keywords,
enabling you to zoom into favored domains for exact matches. Every time
you click an expanding folder triangle, GAWSH launches the search again, 
limiting it to the selected domain.
GAWSH provides the perfect environment in which to use the negative site
operator (see Chapter 2). Eliminating obvious host matches makes the result-
ing host list even more valuable. Try this search:

Chatting with Google
Is no medium safe from Googling? Well, instant messaging isn’t, that’s for
sure. Instant messaging is a popular online discussion medium through
which people chat in pop-up windows that appear on the screen. As with
e-mail, most instant messaging users keep a list of contacts, to whom they

can shoot a “Hello!” or “How are ya?” at any time. The transmission of these
lines is, well, instant.
At least three developers have contrived to let you conduct a basic Web
search in Google, through one of the three major IM programs:
 AOL Instant Messenger (AIM)
 MSN Messenger
 Yahoo! Messenger
Each one works the same way. You use your IM program’s features to see
whether the Google search service is online, and then simply send your key-
word string as an instant message. The problem is, these services are very
often not online. Remember, this isn’t Google itself, which is always available.
These instant-messaging searches are third-party services, alternate Googles,
and the developers are regular folks who go online and offline just like you
and I do. (Actually, I never go offline. Nor do I venture outside. I am fed intra-
venously and hunger for simple human touch that I will never receive. But
enough about me.)
Following are the three IM-search providers and the IM services in which
they operate.
 Googolator: This one works in AIM. Add Googolator to your Buddy list
and send keywords whenever it’s online. Five results are returned.
 Googlematic: This one works identically in AIM and MSN Messenger.
Again, five results. In MSN Messenger, you need an entire e-mail address
to locate a new contact. Look for googlematic@interconnected.org.
 YIMGoogle: This one is set for Yahoo! Messenger. The YIM stands for
Yahoo! Instant Messenger, even though that’s not really the name of the
program. YIMGoogle is the screen name to look for and add to your
Friends list. Query when it comes online to get five results.
To try any one of these, open the corresponding IM program and use the
name from the list as a contact. In other words, send your keyword(s) as an
instant message to that name.
Flash with Floogle
www.flash-db.com/Google
Here’s an alternate Google with no added functionality. Floogle is an experiment
in programming, and it delivers Google search results in the Flash environment.
327
Chapter 19: Ten Alternative Googles

Flash is a multimedia programming language usually used to display moving
images and sound. In this case, it delivers static Google search results. The
site does make fun beeping sounds, though, when the mouse cursor touches
the Result Page numbers atop search results.
Searches are launched and results delivered within the same Flash frame resid-
ing in the Web page. You need Flash 6 for this to work. If you don’t have Flash 6,
the page tells you immediately and downloads it for you if you approve. Down-
loading and installation are transparent and automatic; just wait a minute or so
(depending on your connection speed) until the search engine appears on the
Web page. Figure 19-15 shows Floogle and its search results.
Simply enter a keyword string and click the Search! button. Note that press-
ing the Enter key to launch a search doesn’t work here; doing so merely
clears the keyword box.
Search results look fairly Googlish but without the Similar pages and Cached
links. Oh, and without the entire top-page summary that Google provides.
Floogle dishes up pure results and nothing but. Even the AdWords and spon-
sored links are missing. Click any result link to see the target page, opened in
a new window. See results beyond the first ten by clicking a numbered button
above the results pane — this is where the beeps are located.

Quotes with Your Search Results 
The next entry, Boogle, is somewhat fun, undeniably trivial, and appears in
this chapter more for the sake of comprehensiveness than because I particu-
larly recommend it. 
Boogle (www.boogle.com) provides a straight, simple Google Web search
but adds a picture and a quote to the search page. The attribution of the
quote is searchable — that’s a nice touch. Click refresh to see a new picture
and quote.  Also stop into the forum linked on the front page. You might get
hooked on the lively discussions and quote suggestions posted by fans.
Fabulous Searches with Xtra-Google
www.xtragoogle.com
I saved one of the best for last. Xtra-Google is a meta-search environment for
Google, which simply means that you can access many different Google
engines from one page. In that respect, Xtra-Google is like the Google Toolbar
(see Chapter 12). But Xtra-Google goes beyond the Toolbar in its ability to
fashion original and uniquely useful searches using combinations of search
operators added automatically to your keyword or search string. (See
Chapter 2 for more on search operators.)
Figure 19-16 shows the Xtra-Google home page. If you want to search the
Google Web index, simply enter a keyword and click the Google Search
button. There’s no advantage in doing that over going to Google.com. You can
see which Google engines are accessed by Xtra-Google by running your
mouse cursor over the icons while keeping your eye on the Google logo; the
logo changes to indicate which engine corresponds to that icon. (Figure 19-16
illustrates how the page looks when you touch the newspaper icon on the top
row. Although you can’t see the mouse cursor in the screen shot, you can see
the Google News logo.) When searching non-Web Google indexes, use the
icons as Search buttons: Enter a keyword, and then click the icon corre-
sponding to the index you want to search.
Now consider two unusual icons that don’t correspond with any Google
engine covered in this book. They are the two icons at the left end of the
bottom row. Run the mouse over them, and you’ll see that one is MP3, and
the other is Clips. MP3 is a music format. The Clips icon represents several
types of video formats. Google doesn’t have MP3 or movie indexes, and you
can’t perform a Google.com Web search for those file types using the filetype
operator (see Chapter 2 for more about operators). So what gives?
329
Chapter 19: Ten Alternative Googles

Xtra-Google is doing something clever. By manipulating the keyword string
with various operators that Google does support, it manages to produce 
Web-search results that often uncover MP3 and video files stored around the
Internet. Some of these files are not meant to be found by search engines;
Xtra-Google is tricking certain types of storage areas into revealing them-
selves. In particular, the altered search strings are designed to pry into FTP
(file transfer protocol) locations that are not, technically, part of the World
Wide Web, and are often used to store personal files. Downloading these files
can technically break copyright laws, very much like all the file-sharing of
music that you might have read about.
So if you’re a law-abiding copyright citizen, you might wish to tread carefully
or forget about these shenanigans altogether. On the other hand, the MP3
and Clips searches sometimes turn up completely legal, authorized music or
movie destinations that you might not find by another means.

id you look at the previous chapter? Fun, eh? Well, I’m not finished yet.
Nobody does fun like me. This chapter contains ten more sites that
twist the Google we know and love into barely recognizable configurations. If
anything, this collection is even more resourceful, ingenious, and visual than
the previous group.
Google Cartography
richard.jones.name/google-hacks/google-cartography/google-
cartography.html
Google Cartography is probably the number-crunchingest Google alternative in
the book. This application scours Google for references to any street address,
builds a database of what it can glean about intersecting streets, and delivers a
map (of sorts) that charts the tangled relationship of streets. Chapter 19
described the TouchGraph GoogleBrowser, which graphically displays net-
works of related sites. Similarly, Google Cartography displays networks of
related streets.

Two points of note apply here. First, do not expect a normal-looking map. (See
Figure 20-1.) Second, the intense gathering and collating of site references take
time; a recent search required nearly five minutes to complete. One other
point — all this is fairly useless. But remember what I said about fun? Well,
here it is. You might have trouble recognizing it, but trust me: This is fun.
Google Cartography insists that users deploy their API License Key. These keys
are available to anyone — you don’t need to be a developer. See Chapter 19 to
find out how to get one, and to cash in on the rampant fun of that chapter.
The Cartography site doesn’t do a bang-up job leading new users through the
application-launching process. Please follow these steps:
1. Click the Cartography menu item in the left sidebar.
2. Scroll way down the page until you see a map with a Your Area link
beneath it, and click that link.
3. Fill out the boxes in the pop-up panel (see Figure 20-2).
Enter your license key in the top box, and leave the two filled-in boxes 
as they are. Put a street name in the fourth box, and use the bottom box
for a town and state combination. Use the post office abbreviation for
the state.

4. Click the OK button. And wait.
Keep waiting. Make some coffee; I’ll take a cup, too. Watch your finger-
nails grow. Plant a field of wheat and harvest it. The Cartography “map”
will pop up when it’s ready.
Your computer needs a recent version of the Java plug-in to run Google
Cartography. If the application fails for lack of that plug-in, a notification
appears. See the Google Cartography home page for a download link of the
required plug-in. Most recent browser versions have the necessary plug-in
built in.
Newsmap
www.marumushi.com/apps/newsmap/newsmap.cfm
Newsmap is a fabulous interface that reinvents Google News as a graphic
map of current events. Figure 20-3 shows a snapshot of Google News through
the Newsmap filter. The display is much more colorful than you can see on
this page. Each news section is represented by a different color, with darker
hues representing older stories. Hover your mouse cursor over any item in
the map to see the complete headline and a clip of the lead sentence, as in
Google News (see Chapter 5). Click any item to visit the source news page.

333
Chapter 20: Ten More Alternative Googles

Newsmap archives seven days of Google News headlines, at four times during
each day. Use the grid in the lower-left corner to change your point in time.
Along the top, you can select different national editions of Google News.
The default layout shows squares, but you can also show the map as a series
of vertical strips arranged in horizontal bands representing news sections.
(Forget that confusing description and see Figure 20-4.) This arrangement,
oddly, is called the standard view, and can be invoked using the link in the
lower-right corner.
Thumbshots and Open Directory
open.thumbshots.org/
As I explain with tedious detail in Chapter 7, Google Directory is a repackag-
ing of Open Directory, a nonprofit, all-volunteer Web-mapping project. A com-
pany called Thumbshots creates another repackaging of Open Directory in
which search results are accompanied by thumbnail pictures of the target
sites. The point is not to avoid clicking through to the target sites entirely but
to get a gist of the target before clicking. Some disagreeable content can be
avoided in this manner. More to the point, after you’ve tried the Thumbshots
version of Open Directory, you might be unsatisfied with the ungraphical
standard view.
Figure 20-3:

334
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Note that Google’s PageRank indicators are missing from the Thumbshots
display, which isn’t really the Google Directory. However, listings and search
results are identical to Google’s version. And it has pictures. This is all part of
the ongoing fun.
Browsing the directory works just as well as searching; any page with site
listings in Thumbshots Open Directory displays thumbnails.
SketchWeb
blog.outer-court.com/sketchweb/index.php
SketchWeb resembles a lightweight version of the TouchGraph Google Browser,
described in Chapter 19. SketchWeb results are fewer and graphically simpler
than in TouchGraph, as you can see in Figure 20-5, and the modules do not
divulge any information when you double-click or right-click them.
The idea here is to show simple networks of related sites on a platform that
doesn’t require special software or a powerful computer. Is SketchWeb less
fun than TouchGraph? Please. The contents of this chapter provide unri-
valled fun. Complexity isn’t everything.

BananaSlug
www.bananaslug.com
The fun attains feverish intensity at BananaSlug, which adds random words
to your search string. Related to the random searchers featured in Chapter
19, BananaSlug adds a layer of sophistication by allowing you to select a cate-
gory from which the random word is selected. The entire keyword string con-
sists of your words plus a category word.
The results can be startlingly interesting, as ideas that you might never have
thought to combine get mashed together in the keyword string. Unlike other
random-keyword generators, BananaSlug doesn’t go for obscure words, which
limit results to odd sites. The random word here is usually a common one,
leading to substantial results that would be hard to find by normal means.
In one recent search, I chose alan greenspan for my keywords, and selected
the Laws of Spirit button for the random word, which turned out to be unity.
The results were startling and funny. Whenever you don’t like the results, just
choose another (or the same) category — your original keywords stay in play.

YaGoohoo!gle
www.yagoohoogle.com
The idea is simple. Smash the Yahoo! and Google search engines together.
Begun as an April Fool’s joke, YaGoohoo!gle has attained status as a
metasearch engine with a great display. Figure 20-6 shows a typical search
result.
One interesting feature of YaGoohoo!gle is the side-by-side display, which
encourages you to compare how Yahoo! and Google package their search
results. How many ads, news results, and miscellaneous information are
crammed into the top of the page? The answer often depends on the search
string. Things get really interesting when you want atypical results atop the
page, such as reference answers and other basic facts (see Chapter 3).
YaGoohoo!gle lets you put both engines to the test in head-to-head competi-
tion. (Beware: YaGoohoo!gle randomly switches the positions of the two sets
of results.) Look at Figure 20-7 for an example: The point goes to Yahoo!’s
immediate display of an address map.

LostGoggles
www.lostgoggles.com
If you like thumbnail-enhanced browsing as provided by Thumbshots, you
might be attracted to LostGoggles, which extends the same sort of display to
the entire Google Web-searching experience. LostGoggles used to be called
MoreGoogle, but Google objected — to the name, not the application.
LostGoggles is a little program that works only with Internet Explorer (ver-
sion 5 or later). You download and install it like any other program, and it
takes residence quietly within Internet Explorer, waiting for a visit to Google.
Then, whenever you perform a Google Web search, the results are displayed
with accompanying thumbnail images of the target sites (see Figure 20-8).
LostGoggles is free, and absent of adware and spyware. The program has
been around since August 2004 and enjoys a good reputation.

Soople
www.soople.com
Soople is spectacular; that is the simple truth. Chapter 19 describes the
Google Ultimate Interface, which is a wonderful advanced search screen that
outshines Google’s own Advanced Search page (see Chapter 2). But nothing
comes close to Soople for unleashing the power of Google. I fully expect some
readers, finding out about Soople on these pages, to substitute Soople for
Google entirely. If Soople ever built a toolbar, I think Google would have to
buy the company. Soople’s results come from the Google engine and are pre-
sented on Google pages. But Soople’s search forms go way beyond Google or
any other interface in flexibility and idea generation.
Some studies have indicated that most people’s searching success is hobbled
by poor keyword selection. (To improve your keyword skills, see Chapter 2.)
Soople helps by dividing operators into separate search fields, suggesting

Chapter 20: Ten More Alternative Googles

many topics to search, providing a wide array of keywords, aggregating groups
of sites to search, and allowing you to save a personal page that displays just
the tools you need. 
Figure 20-9 shows the front page, which is just the beginning. Even so, you can
see the breadth of search intelligence presented and the attractiveness of the
design. You can launch a basic Google Web search here, but do yourself a favor
by exploring all the options; clicking the explain link for feature descriptions.
The three main feature innovations at Soople are these:

 Personalized page
Click the Topics tab to see how Soople handles search topics. The site has
assembled about fifty popular search subjects, some of which are visible 
in Figure 20-10. Click any topic, or use the keyword box to search for a 
Soople topic.
Figure 20-11 shows a topic page — note that you can select individual key-
words by checking boxes or bundles of keywords with a single click. When
you’re ready to run the search, simply click the search button near the
middle of the page. (You must either check at least one check box or type a
keyword into the Your own Keywords box to get any results.)

Searchsets are Soople’s preset bundles of topic-relevant sites. In the Searchsets
tab, you can find all the presets and build your own sets. You need to register
for this, but it’s free and painless. (Registration is required so that the site can
remember your sets between visits.) Creating a searchset is a simple matter of
assigning Web sites and naming the group. Using a custom searchset is a pow-
erful way to keep up-to-speed in topics of interest, using sites you trust. Figure
20-12 shows the Searchsets tab with a couple of personal sets placed in it.
Click any set to view the sites in that set. Use the corresponding keyword box
to search any set.
Use the My Soople tab to assemble a page with your favorite Soople tools.
Only preset tools are available — in other words, any specific search function
on the home page (the General tab). Topics and searchsets must be selected
in their respective tabs.
WebCollage

WebCollage is a big poster that plucks pictures from Google Images, softens
their edges, and displays them as a collage. The page automatically refreshes

every minute or so, changing one or two of the pictures. After about ten min-

(In fact, don’t bring up this page at work. Keep your kids away from it, too.
WebCollage is not “safe searching” by any means.)
Click any image in WebCollage to visit the site from the image was taken.
Babelplex
www.babelplex.com
Babelplex is a multilingual marvel that takes a search query typed in one lan-
guage, translates it to another language, and then displays Google results in
both languages. The two sides of the search are separated into frames.
The value of Babelplex is not merely linguistic. The site actually searches
international editions of Google, so the non-American results are very differ-
ent from the English side of the page, if English is one of your languages. It
needn’t be the starting language; use the drop-down menu on Babelplex’s
home page to choose your two languages.

oogle users and third-party developers are an imaginative, playful

impressed by the ingenuity of regular folks who take something as monolithic
as a search engine, and turn it into an ingredient of a game.
In this chapter, you find a collection of Google games that whack and skewer
the great index in deliriously time-wasting ways.
In Pursuit of the Googlewhack
www.googlewhack.com
It started a few years ago and has grown as an underground-cum-mainstream
time-waster. The game is called Googlewhacking, and its goal is to obtain just

one Google result for a two-word keyword string. A few legendary triumphs
(they’re not mine) follow:
ambidextrous scallywags
squirreling dervishes
fetishized armadillo
anxiousness scheduler
More recent milestones are
kneeboarding skywards
confluence urping
quakeproofed woman
naptime quaalude
You’d think that last one might return more than one Google result. And, by
the time you read this, it might.
There is nothing official about Googlewhacking, so rules might seem exces-
sively officious. But you won’t get a whack recorded on the Googlewhack site
unless it conforms to certain guidelines:
 No quotes: Using the exact phrase operator (see Chapter 2) makes it too
easy to get a whack. Forcing unrelated words to exist right next to each
other, as a phrase, instantly reduces results. Letting the words exist any-
where on the Web page brings in many more hits, making the game
tougher.
 No other search operators: Although not listed as a Googlewhacking
rule, it makes sense. Any of the operators described in Chapter 2, stan-
dard or specific to Google, narrow results artificially and should be con-
sidered cheating. Use pure, unfettered keywords thrown into the entire
Web index.
 No scripts allowed: If you’re resourceful enough to write a little software
program that automatically queries Google with randomly combined
words, don’t use it. It violates the spirit of the game, but more important,
this sort of quasicheating takes the fun out of cudgeling your brain for
almost-impossible search strings.
 Web searches only: You might want to experiment with image searches,
Groups searches, or news searches (Directory searches are too easy),
but as of now, results of these variants are not considered true whacks.
346
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

 Real keywords only: The Googlewhack arbiter is Dictionary.com.
 Real result(s) only: If you manage to produce a single result (which is
harder and more gratifying than finding a four-leaf clover), that result
page must be legitimate and meaningful. Pages that contain mere lists of
words, or gibberish, don’t constitute a whack.
Play the game at Google, but visit the Googlewhack site for inspiration, history,
and to read successful whacks and their humorous definitions. The inventive
definitions of whack strings are almost the best part of Googlewhacking. In
one particularly brilliant set of whackinitions, the site fabricated all-Enron
explanations for recent whacks (see Figure 21-1). Reading through the whack-
tionary is both amusing and inspiring.
If you are so lucky (talented?) as to successfully whack Google, go to the
Googlewhacking site and click the Record Your Whack! link. Googlewhack
provides Google search boxes to verify your success. Don’t use these boxes
to try out new whacks. Their only purpose is to verify whacks already estab-
lished through Google.
Figure 21-1:

347
Chapter 21: Ten Google Games

Unfortunately, whacks are rarely permanent. Their transience is due not to
the ever-changing Google index but to the urge to brag. If you promote your
own whack, or record it on the Googlewhack site, that instantly creates a
second page with your two keywords. Google will probably find it eventually.
The Googlewhack site is already in the index, of course, so within a month at
the longest (the usual length of Google’s major update cycle) your whack will
be ruined.
Googlewhackers are a strict bunch, but they look kindly on artificially ruined
whacks as described in the previous paragraph. In fact, the name Heisenwhack
has been applied to such disruptions in the quantum whackfield, after the
physicist Werner Heisenberg. He, along with Niels Bohr, theorized that nothing
exists without measurement, and the sheer act of measuring a phenomenon
alters it. Hence, there is no objectivity. (This, however, is not the Heisenberg
Uncertainty Principle, despite what some Googlewhacking sites tell you. The
Uncertainty Principle is about the impossibility of measuring both the position
and momentum of a particle.) The lack of objectivity relates to the unwhack-
ing of keywords through the simple act of observing them (mentioning the
whack on a Web page).
You can cut through a ruined whack by searching for the two keywords with
the added negative keyword -googlewhack (using the NOT operator as
described in Chapter 2). That should deliver the original single search result,
verifying the un-Heisenwhacked whack.
The Random Googlelaar
www.northernlake.com/googlelaar/
In the preceding section on Googlewhacking, I mentioned that using auto-
mated, random-word search generators was cheating. Googlelaar, which gen-
erates one-word, two-word, and three-word searches in English or Dutch,
provides perfect examples of why these things don’t yield legitimate whacks.
When I first encountered Googlelaar, I got a Googlewhack in my first random
search: pained pentanone. Cheating or not, it’s amazing to see that “1 of 1” in
the summary bar.
Googlelaar, and other random-word Google interfaces, are frivolous to the
extreme. But there’s something trivially satisfying about making Google chase
its tail. Figure 21-2 shows Googlelaar’s page — it’s simple enough. Click the
drop-down menus to select the number of words and language, and then click
the Hit me! button. Google delivers the search results. Click the Back button
to try another search.
348
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Googlelaar prowls through Webster’s Second International Dictionary to find
its keywords, and presumably the entire dictionary is in its memory. Most of
the words I get are unfamiliar — and I know a lot of words. This means that
either English has more exotic words than I realized or Googlelaar skews the
keyword selection toward obscurities. In any event, a common results total
for two- or three-word searches through Googlelaar is 0.
Another frequent result is Google asking if you didn’t mean a slightly different
spelling of your keyword string. I find this amusing. Recently Googlelaar gen-
erated the phrase artiad skirted unbenetted. Google responded — did you
mean: artiad skirted unbelted? Yes, of course! That’s what I meant!
Using Googlelaar for one-word random searches is more diverting. And this is
where a little keyboard tip gives the exercise some rhythm. Googlelaar launches
a search with a press of the Enter key — you don’t need to click the Hit me!
button. So you can bounce back and forth between Googlelaar and the search
results page with repeated Enter-Back-Enter-Back sequences. There’s never a
need to type a keyword, of course.

Chapter 21: Ten Google Games

Googlism
www.googlism.com
Googlism uses tricky (and undivulged) keyword manipulations to ascertain
what Google “thinks” about people, places, and things. Although the keyword
chicanery is hidden, the results are clearly scraped from actual Web pages
Google finds in relation to your keyword(s). But don’t mistake this site for an
information resource — it’s mostly entertainment. Googlism swept through
the Usenet newsgroups when it was introduced, and everyone was delighted
to discover the supposed revelatory truth about their online acquaintances.
Googlism works in plain fashion. Figure 21-3 shows the Googlism home page.
Type a keyword, click the appropriate option (Who, What, Where, or When),
and then click the Googlism! button. What follows is a list of sentence frag-
ments and occasional complete phrases lifted from Google search results.
The amusement factor is due to the phrases being taken out of context, as if
they were always meant to be as declamatory as they appear in Googlism.
Take, for example, this short sample from the Googlism on Microsoft:
Microsoft is calling you
Microsoft is losing its grip
Microsoft is calling you a lab rat
Microsoft is
The last one seems complete unto itself.
Run a Googlism on yourself, but remember that results must come from Web
pages that include your name. Of course, getting hits on your name that
belong to an identically named stranger is fun, too.
Want to know where a particular Googlism comes from? Even the silliest sound-
ing ones are not made up; they come from some Web page. Simply type the
Googlism into Google (not into Googlism) and check the results. Put quotes
around the Googlism if the original search results show any confusion.
Capture the Map
www.capturethemap.de
One of the more recent, and most ingenious, Google games yet created,
Capture the Map pits two players (one of which can be the computer) in a
350
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

game of world domination. Where does Google fit in? You capture portions of
the world by craftily generating search results that include Web sites located
in those portions of the world. It’s not easy to think of keywords with this
strategy in mind. Simply entering names of places doesn’t always work as
well as you might hope. The keyword strategizing is toughest when the game
is in the late stages and a few remaining territories are up for grabs.
Figure 21-4 shows a game in progress. A magnifying glass can be dragged
around the world map for a close-up view of each player’s holdings. Any held
territory can be captured by the opponent, unless it covers an area of three-
by-three squares.
Squabbling Keywords
Google’s reputation as an arbiter of cultural relevance makes it the perfect
source for a game that pits keywords against each other. Who is more impor-
tant, Sean Connery or Harrison Ford? And if one gets more Google results
than the other, does that really tell us something? The question seems ludi-
crous on the face of it, but considering the size and scope of Google’s index,
and the depth with which it catalogues human interest as expressed on the
Web, there might be something to the idea.
Figure 21-3:

Chapter 21: Ten Google Games

Anyway, nobody is trying to write a doctoral dissertation on the thesis.
Again, the point here is entertainment. Here are the three sites in question:
 GoogleFight at www.googlefight.com
 Google Smackdown at www.onfocus.com/googlesmack/down.asp
 Google Duel at www.googleduel.com
The three sites are more similar than different, but each has strong and weak
points. Figure 21-5 illustrates the home page of Google Smackdown. As with
the others, the interface invites you to enter two keywords, phrases, or
names. The engine then tabulates the results totals and throws away the
actual results, leaving you with a count of the number of hits for each of the
competing keywords or keyword strings.
This is great fun. During a political season, pit one American Idol candidate
against another. Who is really more popular, Carrie Underwood or Bo Bice?
(Hint: Count those telephone votes again.) Plug in any two names, concepts,
expressions, objects, or locations. Put your hometown against your friend’s
hometown. Let Plato and Socrates fight it out in the Google index.
Figure 21-4:

Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Astute Google users might be tempted to put quotes around their keyword
phrases to keep them intact, yielding more accurately competitive results. 
No need. Each of these three sites automatically adds quotes to your phrases
(though you don’t see the quotes) when they throw the search into Google. 
If you add your own quotes, around the invisible quotes, Google ignores the
whole mess and treats your keywords individually. Then you get more but
less accurate results.
Google Smackdown and Google Duel request that you use your own Google
developer’s key; it’s only polite to provide your own key when a site pro-
vides space to enter it. (See Chapter 14 for information about getting a key.)
Googlefight has a pleasing interface that puts your two keyword phrases in
different colors.
When it comes to displaying results, my favorite is Google Duel, which ren-
ders an illustrative graph of the results, in addition to dishing up the raw
numbers (see Figure 21-6). Notice the link to an advanced version of Google
Duel called GoogleDuel Ultra, which encourages users to enter descriptive
adjectives in addition to names (see Figure 21-7). The results are filtered by
the extra information.

Overall, when in the mood for a keyword fight, I find myself going to Googlefight
more than the others. The interface is the least pleasant, in my opinion, but I
like the archive of interesting and amusing keyword matchups.
More Random Searching
Earlier in this chapter I describe Googlelaar, which randomly generates key-
words and shows you Google’s search results for those words. In this section,
I introduce three engines that also randomly contrive keywords but take the
happy meaninglessness of random searching to the next level by leaping
directly to the first result site for those words.
Two main features distinguish the best of these sites from the not-as-good:
 Keyword customization: Even though it’s the engine’s job to generate
random keywords, the sites below all allow the user to specify the
number of keywords used. Clearly, the greater flexibility in this depart-
ment, the more fun the engine is. One of the sites described here even
lets you set the maximum length of the keywords.
 Frames: Frames on Web pages can be a disagreeable design choice, but
in this case they really help. Some sites throw the target page into your
browser window without an anchor frame, forcing you to backtrack if
you want to try a new random search. The better designs display the
randomly found page below a horizontal frame containing the means to
launch a new search.
The danger of random searches — besides being a stultifying waste of time —
is that you’re likely to stumble into site types that you’d ordinarily avoid. If you
don’t like opening PDF files, for example, you might be upset when one comes
screaming in, unannounced. Adult sites are not out of bounds, either, unless
you click the SafeSearch box — provided the search engine furnishes one.
Mangle
www.mangle.ca
Mangle — nice name for a site, isn’t it? And not really descriptive: Mangle
doesn’t destroy keywords; it invents them. Hoping to please everyone, Mangle
offers a choice of interfaces — frames or no frames. On the search page (see
Figure 21-8), you can choose up to five keywords (the default setting is three).
You can also select a country and language, or leave the gates wide open for
everything. (Use the Region Mangle and Custom Mangle links.) Random
searches become particularly useless if conducted in a language you don’t
understand. The engine is naturally biased toward English and generally
delivers English-language sites in default mode.
355
Chapter 21: Ten Google Games

Note a few features of the Mangle search frame:
 Click the cat picture (upper-right corner) to launch a search. Pressing
the Enter key doesn’t do it.
 Check the Safemode box to apply Google filtering to Mangle’s search
results.
 Use the drop-down menu to change the number of keywords. You may
choose between one and five keywords.
 The keywords used by the engine are displayed just below the drop-
down menus.
 The displayed page’s link is below the keywords.
For truly empty-headed searching, click the archive search link on Mangle’s
home page. You get a random page from Mangle’s storehouse of previously
randomized results. So not only are you searching in the dark, you’re taking
random results from other people’s blind searches. Good times!
Random Google page
www.bleb.org/random
One of the simplest random search pages is appropriately named the Random
Google page. Two distinguishing features mark this site. First, you can generate
Figure 21-8:
Mangle in
search
mode,
displaying
the first
search
result from
randomly
chosen
keywords.
356
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

up to ten keywords. That many keywords, more often than not, leads to zero
results, but what’s more fun than trying over and over until you find a page
that matches ten keywords? The second feature is a list of recent search
results (including yours) at the bottom of the home page. Each link allows
you to recreate the search, as if once weren’t enough.
Random Web Search
www.randomwebsearch.com
If there’s one site that puts together all the important features of the others,
and adds some of its own, for a thoroughly time-wasting and gloriously unpro-
ductive Google experience, it’s the Random Web Search page. Figure 21-9
shows the options available on the home page. This site can act as a stan-
dard Web-search interface to Google. Just type your keywords and click the
Google Search button. For random searching, click the Generate Random
Word(s) button. You get one word most of the time, but the engine will throw
you a phrase when you least expect it. And you can add your own keywords
to the randomly generated word.

Chapter 21: Ten Google Games

Click the Google Search button for standard results or the I’m Feeling Lucky
button to see the first result site. Frames are not used when displaying target
sites, so click the Back button to return for another search.
Click the Add Word tab to contribute a brilliant keyword to the site’s archive.
That word will begin appearing, randomly, on other people’s screens.
Best of all, click the Found tab to see randomly found Web pages with short
descriptions. This collection justifies the entire random-search movement.
Maybe. At the very least, when using Random Web Search, you will be — as
the site proclaims — “Wasting your time more efficiently.”
Google Backwards
www.alltooflat.com/geeky/elgoog/
elgooG emulates Google in every respect, but in reverse. This site puts a literal
spin on the concept of mirror site. Most mirror sites replicate their originals
in every detail. elgooG replicates Google as a mirror image. Go to the elgooG
page and try a search (see Figure 21-10) to see what I’m talking about.
Figure 21-10:
This is not a
printing
mistake!
elgooG
mirrors

358
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

The reversal is thorough. Search results pages come out as backwards as the
home page. elgooG used to make users type their keywords in reverse but,
perhaps having mercy on us, now reverses the characters after we type them
in the correct order. (Typing backward still works, too.)
elgooG carries this conceit through all Google interface pages — Advanced
Search, Preferences, Language Tools, the whole lot. News, Groups, Directory —
all backwards. (In the Directory and Google Groups, pages that are at the
second level and lower revert to a normal display.) Oh, and search results are
reversed, too. When you click any result to leave Google, your screen reverts
to its normal display.
Of what possible use is elgooG? The same might be asked of. In both cases,
science has not yet found an answer.
Gettin’ in the Hood with Gizoogle
www.gizoogle.com
Of the many Google games I’ve suggested in my Google Weblog, this one has
received the most enthusiastic response. Gizoogle translates normal Google
results to the brand of rap-speak invented and popularized by Snoop Dog.
Figure 21-11 illustrates what you can expect from a Gizoogle search.
Figure 21-11:
Gizoogle

359
Chapter 21: Ten Google Games

Gizoogle isn’t a G-rated site, just as hip, urban, rap-influenced speech isn’t
always wholesome. You might not want to enjoy the snappy and scatological
phrases peppered through Gizoogle results with kids looking over your
shoulder, or at work.
Gizoogle translates any material that you dump into it. Click the Textilizer
link and type or paste sentences or paragraphs into the entry box, and then
click the Tranzilate This Text button. When I did so with the paragraph pre-
ceding this one, I got this result:
“Gizoogle isn’t a G-rated site, just as H-to-tha-izzip, urban, rap-influenced
speech isn’t always wholesome. You miznight not wizzay ta enjoy tha snappy
n scatalogizzles phrases peppered through Gizoogle results wit kids look’n
over yo cracka or at wizzork.”
Isn’t that what I said the first time?
A Google Time Machine
Google hasn’t been in existence for very long in the grand scheme of things.
But since it indexes many pages dealing with historic events, the Google
brain can express the arc of human events to some extent. Describing that
arc is the purpose of the FindForward engine. FindForward is a misnomer,
because the engine actually finds backward, reaching into one of two fifty-
year blocks of time (1900–1950 or 1950–2000). The FindForward site contains
several search options; this time-machine gadget is merely the one I’m inter-
ested in here.
Start by going to the FindForward site:
www.findforward.com
On the front page, pull down the menu and select one of the two time peri-
ods. Generally, I find that better results come from the more recent period:
1950–2000. When I say “results,” I don’t mean typical Google listings. Instead,
FindForward delivers a graph representing the newsworthiness of your key-
words in each year of the time period. Figure 21-12 shows the results for the
key phrase moon landing. Note that the year 1969 shows the peak of interest
in those keywords, corresponding to the first manned lunar landing. Then,
sadly, interest declines.
It takes a little while (up to a minute sometimes) for FindForward to display
results. The site is not broken. Just cool your Internet-fueled jets and wait.

Google Poker
www.library.vcu.edu/cfapps/jbc/instruct/google/game
At the site, this game is blandly (and self-importantly) called Google Game.
But it’s actually a sort of poker in which you bet whether your hand (provided
by the site — you don’t have to do anything) will beat the site’s hand. A hand
consists of three keywords, and one of the site’s keywords is hidden. You bet
on the high or low side, depending on your confidence that your hand of key-
words will yield more or fewer results than the opposing hand. Each set of
three keywords is thrown into the Google index as a single search string, not
as three separate searches.
Figure 21-13 illustrates the results of one hand, and the setup of the next one.
I bet low and won, and I’m going high in the next hand. (I won again. I rule.)

This book is mostly concerned with hands-on, heady interaction with the

range from the technical to the journalistic, from the critical to the laudatory.
The Unofficial Google Weblog
google.weblogsinc.com
This one is mine, and I’ll keep the plug brief. The Unofficial Google Weblog is
part of Weblogs Inc., where I cover the search industry and a few other topics.

This blog is where I dump my daily commentary on Google news (a couple of
examples of which are shown in Figure 22-1). It’s a good place to keep up-to-
date with new Google features and discover what other bloggers and journal-
ists think of them. I, and occasional guest bloggers, take a broad approach to
the subject, reporting and analyzing everything from perceived changes in
the index to the evolution of Gmail, from Google stock to the rare utterances
of Sergey Brin and Larry Page, Google’s founders.

Google Watch
www.google-watch.org/
Google Watch is an extremely critical and well-researched site that offers a
tonic to blind Google mania. Google Watch believes in its words, “There’s a
struggle going on for the soul of the web, and the focal point of this struggle
is Google itself.”

Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Google Watch has problems with Google’s dominance and the influence it
wields. The site also takes issue with the PageRank system, claiming that it
unfairly adds to the prominence of popular sites that don’t necessarily deserve
their popularity. Further, Google Watch dislikes Google’s use of cookies to
track user behavior through the site. Google Watch even believes that Google’s
cached copy of Web sites is illegal, not to mention problematic for Webmasters.
Google’s general secretiveness is raked over the coals at Google Watch.
Google Watch is an investigative site, a scathing indictor of Google’s opera-
tions, an explainer of technical arcana, and a loud whistleblower. At the same
time, the site’s importance is diminishing. Google Watch is not updated fre-
quently and not varied enough. Its in-depth negative treatment of Google
issues prevents the sort of quick, down-and-dirty treatment Google gets from
blogs. Google Watch is starting to seem old, dated, and whiny.
Furthermore, Google-bashing is no longer a novelty. Google’s initial stock
offering brought the company and its products to the forefront of media cov-
erage for several months, during which all remnants of reverence were
stripped away from most people’s perception of the company and its ser-
vices. That’s not to say Google isn’t still greatly admired, but it is also com-
monly criticized, just like any other highly visible media company.
Google Watch probably won’t make it in the next edition of this book. But
now it is still worth a visit.
Webmaster World: Google
www.webmasterworld.com/forum30
Webmaster World’s Google forum is one of the most visited sites for serious
Google watchers. This forum is populated by Webmasters — site owners
trying to maximize their exposure in the Google index and on search results
pages. Much of the conversation is fairly advanced and technical.
Topics in this forum include bettering one’s PageRank; understanding and
coping with the Google dance; anticipating the deep crawl and preparing a
site for it; and luring the Google spider, making it happy, and enduring its
occasional wrath.
Webmaster World has developed several forums for discussion of Google fea-
tures, including separate pages for messages about AdWords, AdSense, and
Froogle. Use the following link to see the index of all Google-related

Google PageRank
pr.efactory.de
PageRank is arguably the most important search technology to hit the Web 
in years. The ranking of Web pages based on popularity, as defined by the
amount of backlinking directed toward them, lies at the heart of Google’s
effectiveness. Yet determining PageRank is not a simple matter of counting
links. Google deploys algorithms that are both highly technical and partly
secret.
This site explains PageRank with a depth only a truly ambitious Google
fanatic can appreciate. Here you find a mathematical description of the
Google algorithm as taken from the university papers of Google’s founders.
Eight other sections delve into the details of how PageRank is implemented,
the role of incoming and outgoing links, ranking distribution issues, and quite
a bit more, the description of which would make me appear quite foolish.
Google Weblog
google.blogspace.com
The Google Weblog provides a simple, nontechnical update of Google news.
There’s nothing controversial or difficult here. Even the typeface is childishly
huge. Pro-Google perhaps to a fault, the Google Weblog is nonetheless objec-
tive enough to be a credible news source.
Elgoog
www.elgoog.nl
It’s Google spelled backwards, get it? I didn’t think it was clever, either. But
Elgoog is a potent directory to Google-related sites. Prefaced as an “ode to
Google,” the site is less poetic than methodical and is possibly the most com-
prehensive directory of online Googlish destinations.
The inner workings of the directory exhibit a somewhat slapdash organiza-
tion, with considerable duplication among the subjects. But never mind that.
Many riches lurk within.

Googlepress
groups-beta.google.com/group/googlepress/
Google distributes press releases to anyone who wants them. These bulletins
contain news about Google’s services and features, and are, of course, free.
Curiously, Google uses a Google Group to collect memberships in the distrib-
ution list. Normally, Google Groups is used to build online communities
around a certain topic, and it enables message-board discussions, chat rooms,
shared calendars, posted pictures, and other fun features. Google has all
those features turned off and uses the group strictly for e-mailing newsletters.
You sign up for Google’s press releases by joining the Googlepress group.
Please get your head into Chapter 6 if you have questions about navigating
around Google Groups.
Search Engine Showdown
www.searchengineshowdown.com
If only the Search Engine Showdown site were updated more frequently. If
only all the nations of the world would just get along. Oh well. Search Engine
Showdown combines reviews, tutorials, and comparison charts to give visi-
tors an intriguing view of the topography of the keyword-query industry. The
topography of the keyword-query industry? Where do I come up with this
buzzbabble? I’m just frustrated because the nations of the world don’t get
along. Anyway, my point here is that Search Engine Showdown is a great
place to compare which search operators work in different engines, which
search indexes are larger than others, and how to make better choices and
conduct better searches. There is also a blog, but it’s not updated frequently,
and it rarely discusses world peace. I’ve got to get off this conflict of nations
thing — it’s depressing.
Google Blog — Live
www.google.com/googleblog/
New since the first edition of this book is Google’s own blog, written by com-
pany employees. This is where you go for new product announcements and
glimpses into the daily life at the Googleplex — Google’s corporate campus.

Chapter 22: Ten Sites and Blogs about Google

Oddly, Google’s in-house blog isn’t that good. It compares unfavorably, in my
opinion, with the blog written by engineers at Yahoo! Search. Google’s blog is
fluffy, often lacking substantial information and even more bereft of thought-
provoking entries. You’d think that one of the most intense aggregations of
brainpower in corporate America could do better, but Google Blog — Live is
too often about promotion. It uses the word cool with uncool frequency, like a
parent trying too hard. The blog is often behind the news curve, even about
its own products.
Still, there it is — uniquely Google’s. It must reside in your newsreader or
bookmark list.
Google also produces a monthly newsletter. Well, almost monthly. Not quite
monthly. Not even close to being monthly. Fourteen months elapsed between
the last two editions, as of this writing. But the archives make interesting
browsing (on a slow day), and I am told that the newsletter might awaken to
a more frequent schedule. Here is the archives page:
www.google.com/googlefriends/archive.html
Click the Google Newsletter link on that page to find the e-mail subscrip-
tion form.
Google Blogoscoped
blog.outer-court.com
One of the great, landmark, Google-centric blogs, Google Blogoscoped is a
daily source of news and comment for many unquenchable Google watchers.
More than an information source, Google Blogoscoped produces a multitude
of Google tools and API developments, such as The Google Family Tree and
The Google Encyclopedia, as well as the FindForward engine described in
Chapter 21. Everyone who follows Google as an interest, an obsession, or a
professional requirement is in touch with Google Blogoscoped.
