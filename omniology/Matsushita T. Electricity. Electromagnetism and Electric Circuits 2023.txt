Preface 
The electric circuit is an essential topic in electric engineering and electronics. Its 
behavior is based on electromagnetism and gives the basis for electronic circuit. So, 
it is especially important for students who learn hardware systems such as large-
scale integration (LSI) that are composed of electronic circuits. It is also useful 
for students in other ﬁelds who learn electric control systems, mechanical systems, 
artiﬁcial intelligence, or even bioinformatics. This book is written for such students 
in other ﬁelds who need some knowledge of electric circuits. 
In this book students will learn ﬁrst electromagnetism and then move to elec-
tric circuits. Electromagnetism is the basis for exactly understanding the features 
of circuit elements such as the resistor, capacitor, and coil that compose electric 
circuits. In particular, an understanding of electromagnetism is essential to quanti-
tatively determine the resistance, capacitance, and inductance of circuit elements. 
The relationship between the current and voltage in each element is also obtained 
by this study. Electromagnetic induction, which is a basic principle of the electric 
generator and the transformer, is also a key phenomenon of electromagnetism. In 
addition, Kirchhoff’s laws, which are extremely important laws in electric circuits, 
are directly derived from electromagnetism. A careful argument is needed to apply 
Kirchhoff’s laws to AC circuits from viewpoint of electromagnetism. In this book, 
the treatments of electromagnetism and electric circuits are compactly packaged, 
and the correlation between them is described in detail. This is the largest advantage 
of this book. Each volume of electromagnetism and electric circuits is suitable for 
lectures over a semester. Thus, it is effective to give lectures on both over a year. It 
is also possible to give lectures on each part independently. 
Characteristic points on electromagnetism and electric circuits in this book are 
introduced. The E-B analogy is now commonly used in electromagnetism. In partic-
ular, the superconductor is introduced as a kind of magnetic material to strengthen the 
E-B analogy: Magnetic phenomena around superconductors, which show that B = 
0, are compared with electric phenomena around conductors, which show that E = 0. 
This contributes to strengthening the analogy between electricity and magnetism with 
the correspondence between electric phenomena in dielectric materials and magnetic 
phenomena in magnetic materials. In addition, the introduction of superconductors

Preface
is expected to be useful to study superconducting circuits that will be realized in 
the future. From a technical viewpoint, integral formulae, which are mostly used to 
solve problems, are adopted to assist the readers in easily gaining understanding. 
The deferential formulae that are useful to characterize the ﬁeld and potential are 
described in Appendix. 
In the treatment of electric circuits, we ﬁrst learn about DC electric circuits 
composed of resistors and DC voltage sources. Here, the intuitive and analytic solu-
tion methods are compared to strengthen the importance of ﬁnding the essential point. 
Then, the transient and steady-state responses of AC electric circuits are treated. In 
the transient response we learn about the energy stored or dissipated in each circuit 
element. After that, AC circuit theory is introduced for describing the AC steady-
state phenomena in circuits. In particular, we learn the characteristics of various types 
of ﬁlter from the frequency response. In addition, the advantages of using complex 
electric power are also introduced. In electric circuits, the electromotive force gener-
ated by electromagnetic induction is not treated as an electromotive force, but as a 
voltage drop. This treatment, which is an extension of Kirchhoff’s second law to 
AC circuits, is explained in detail from the viewpoint of electromagnetism. Finally, 
theoretical treatments such as the branch current method, closed current method, and 
node potential method are introduced to show the validity of the solution methods 
that have been used in the book. Not only analytic methods, but intuitive methods 
are also used to solve some problems, since it is a good exercise to ﬁnd the essential 
points in problems. 
Many examples and exercises are arranged in each chapter to yield a deeper 
understanding. The answers to exercises are explained in detail at the end of the 
book. It is highly desirable to use them effectively. Finally, the author would like to 
acknowledge Dr. Tania M. Silver at Wollongong University for editing the English 
in the book.

Chapter 1 
Electric Phenomena in Vacuum 
Abstract This chapter covers electric phenomena in vacuum due to electric charges. 
The Coulomb force works between electric charges. This electric reaction is consid-
ered to be caused by an electrical distortion in space that is produced by other elec-
tric charges, and this distortion is called the electric ﬁeld. The local electric ﬁeld 
is described by Coulomb’s law. On the other hand, the global relationship between 
the electric charge and the electric ﬁeld is described by Guass’s law. This law is 
sometimes useful to determine the electric ﬁeld strength. The electric ﬁeld can be 
regarded as caused by an electric potential, which is equal to the mechanical work 
to carry a unit electric charge under the reaction by the electric ﬁeld. The electric 
potential is derived by a curvilinear integral of the electric ﬁeld. The electrostatic 
energy is equal to the product of the electric charge and the electric potential. 
1.1 Electric Charge in Vacuum 
The substance that causes various electric phenomena is electric charge, and innu-
merable protons with positive electric charge and electrons with negative electric 
charge exist in materials. The effects of these electric charges are cancelled and 
electrically neutral states are the result in most cases. When this balance is broken, 
electric phenomena appear. The amount of electric charge that one proton has is the 
elementary electric charge: 
e equals 1.602 1 76 634 tim
es 10 Superscript negative 19 Baseline upper C comma
where the unit [C] is coulomb. The amount of electric charge of electron is negative e. 
There are two kinds of electric charge that cause electric phenomena: One is 
true electric charge, which can be transferred outside a substance, and the other 
is polarization charge, which cannot be transferred outside due to locally binding 
around nuclei. The former appears on the surface of a conductor, and its ﬂow gives 
a current, while the latter appears on the surface of a dielectric material. 
The principle of conservation of charge holds, i.e., the total amount of electric 
charge is constant in a closed system. Even when positive and negative charges cancel

each other, the algebraic sum of electric charge is unchanged. For example, when a 
piece of amber is scrubbed with a silk cloth, positive charge appears on the amber, 
and the corresponding negative charge appears on the silk cloth. The total sum of the 
electric charge is zero and is the same as before scrubbing. When the system is not 
closed and the total sum of electric charge changes, movement of electric charge, i.e., 
an electric current, occurs. A conservation relationship holds between the electric 
charge and current, which will be described in Sect. 3.1. 
1.2 Coulomb’s Law 
The electric force between electric charges is the Coulomb force. There are the 
following characteristic points between two electric charges in vacuum: 
• The force between two electric charges of the same kind is repulsive and that 
between electric charges of different kinds is attractive. 
• The magnitude of the force is proportional to the product of the two electric 
charges. 
• The magnitude of the force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance 
between the two electric charges. 
• The direction of the force lies on the straight line connecting the two electric 
charges. 
This is called Coulomb’s law: The force that electric charge q staying at position bold italic r
experiences from the electric charge q prime at position bold italic r prime is:

that q prime experiences from q is obtained by replacement of bold italic r by bold italic r prime as negative bold italic upper F. In the above 
the constant epsilon 0 is the permittivity of vacuum,

where c is the light speed in vacuum.
When there are more than two electric charges, the total Coulomb force is given 
by the sum of each individual Coulomb force. For example, the force on electric

When electric charge upper Q is placed in space, the Coulomb force is exerted on another 
charge q. It can be considered that this force is caused by an electrical distortion 
in space produced by the electric charge upper Q. Universal gravitation is also a nonlocal 
interaction similar to the Coulomb force. We are living under the Earth’s gravity, and 
it can be regarded that this force is caused by a gravitational distortion produced by 
the large mass of the Earth. If we denote by upper G, upper M, and uper R 0 the constant of gravitation, 
the mass, and the radius of the Earth, the force that a particle of mass m on the surface 
of the earth receives is:

where g equals 9.8 0665 m slash s squared is the gravitational acceleration due to the Earth and minus bold italic i Subscript r
is a unit vector directed towards the center of the earth. The distorted property of 
space that gives rise to gravitation is called the gravitational ﬁeld. 
The electrical distortion caused by existing electric charges is called the electric 
ﬁeld. When the force on the electric charge q placed at bold italic r due to the electric charge 
upper Q at the origin is expressed as 
bo ld i ta
lic upper F equals q bold italic upper E comma
the vector bold italic upper E is called the electric ﬁeld strength. The unit of the electric ﬁeld is 
[N/C]. This also expressed as [V/m] using the unit [V] (volt) of electric potential, 
which will be deﬁned later. Hence, the electric ﬁeld strength is equal to the Coulomb 
force on a unit charge (1 C) that is placed at the aimed position. In the above case, 
we have

Equations (1.9) and (1.10) for the electric ﬁeld strength are also called Coulomb’s 
law. 
We can use electric ﬁeld lines to visualize the electric ﬁeld, which help us to 
understand the condition of the electric ﬁeld. Such a line is deﬁned so that the 
direction of a tangential line at any point on the electric ﬁeld line is the same as that 
of the electric ﬁeld bold italic upper E, and its line density is equal to the magnitude of bold italic upper E. Examples 
of electric ﬁeld lines are shown in Fig. 1.4.

where r S ub script upper A Baseline equals StartAbsoluteValue bold italic r Subscript upper A Baseline EndAbsoluteValueand r S ub script upper B Baseline equals StartAbsoluteValue bold italic r Subscript upper B Baseline EndAbsoluteValue. Hence, the needed work is determined only by 
the starting point A and the terminal point B but is independent of a route of inte-
gration. This result holds generally, also for the case where many electric charges 
are distributed in space or the electric charge is distributed continuously. Here, we 
introduce a quantity deﬁned by

 bold italic r right parenthesis equals minus integral Underscript bold italic r 0 Overscript bold italic r Endscripts bold italic upper E dot d bold italic r comma
which is called the electric potential. bold italic r 0 is a reference point at which the electric 
potential is zero and is usually taken as at inﬁnity. The unit of the electric potential 
is [V]. The value of the electric potential is determined by the starting point and 
terminal point only and is independent of the route. Hence, the electric potential at 
an arbitrary point is equal to the work necessary to carry a unit charge from inﬁnity. 
Thus, the work given by Eq. (1.12) is generally expressed using the electric potential 
as

The difference in the electric potential between two points, such as phi left parenthesis bold italic r Subscript upper B Baseline right parenthesis minus phi left parenthesis bold italic r Subscript upper A Baseline right parenthesis, 
is called the voltage. If  phidoes not change while carrying q from inﬁnity to bold italic r, the  
work is written as

This can be regarded as the potential energy of electric charge q in the electric

Using Eq. (1.14), we have

for an arbitrary closed loop C, where the integral shows a circular integral. The ﬁeld 
with such a property is called a conservative ﬁeld. This means that the work needed 
to carry an electric charge along a closed loop is zero, which is equivalent to the 
zero mechanical work needed to carry a mass along a closed loop in the gravitational 
ﬁeld. 
Here, we determine the electric potential in space when electric charge upper Q is placed 
at the origin. The electric ﬁeld is given by Eq. (1.8). Using Eq. (1.14), we have

A virtual surface on which the electric potential has the same value is called the

as follows: The work necessary to carry electric charge q by a small distance normal upper Delta bold italic r

in electric ﬁeld bold italic upper E is min us  q bold italic upper E dot normal upper Delta bold italic r. When normal upper Delta bold italic r is on an equipotential surface, this work

where uper E Subscript n is the normal component of the electric ﬁeld directed outward on upper S (see 
Fig. 1.10). 
upper N in Eq. (1.22) is called the number of electric ﬁeld lines that go out of upper S. Since 
the electric ﬁeld lines do not terminate or appear halfway, the surface integral is the 
same as if it is calculated on a sphere uper S Subscript 0 of radius a with its center at the position 
of the electric charge q. The electric ﬁeld bold italic upper E is parallel to the elementary surface d bold italic upper S

the electric ﬁeld lines that go into upper S surely go out, and hence, upper N is zero.

where upper V is the volume surrounded by upper S. Equations (1.24) and (1.25) are called 
Gauss’s law. 
Here, we show an example of how to determine the electric ﬁeld strength using 
Gauss’s law. Suppose that electric charge is uniformly distributed with density rho
inside a sphere of radius a. Although it is not easy to determine the electric ﬁeld 
strength due to this electric charge with Coulomb’s law, we can easily determine it 
with Gauss’s law. In the beginning, we shall determine the electric ﬁeld strength at a 
point at distance r left parenthesis less than a right parenthesisfrom the center of the sphere. We assume a concentric sphere 
upper S of radius r, as shown in Fig. 1.12a. Then, the observation point is placed on upper S. If  
we apply Gauss’s law on upper S, the electric ﬁeld vector has only the radial component, 
and its value upper E is constant on upper S from symmetry. Hence, the left side of Eq. (1.25) 
leads to

On the other hand, the total electric charge inside upper S is left parenthesis 4 divided by 3 right parenthesis pi r cubed rho. Hence, the electric 
ﬁeld strength is determined to be 
up pe r E equals StartFraction rho r Over 3 epsilon 0 EndFraction period

 E equals StartFraction rho r Over 3 epsilon 0 EndFraction period
Next, we shall determine the electric ﬁeld strength outside the sphere. We assume a 
concentric sphere with radius r left parenthesis greater than a right parenthesis, as in Fig.  1.12b and apply Gauss’s law on this 
spherical surface. In this case, the left side of Eq. (1.25) is the  same  as  Eq. (1.26),

It is found that Eq. (1.28) is identical to Eq. (1.8) if we use the total electric charge, 
up per Q equals left parenthesis 4 divided by 3 right parenthesis pi a cubed rho. That is, the result is same as in the case in which all the electric 
charge is concentrated at the origin. This corresponds to the fact that the gravity on 
a matter on the Earth is the same as the gravity when all the mass is concentrated on 
the center of the Earth, as shown in Eq. (1.6).

Solution 1.5 Assume a closed cylindrical surface, upper S, of radius a and height 2 h,

are directed normal to the plane, and there is no electric ﬁeld line that goes out of 
the side surface. So, all the electric ﬁeld lines go out of the top and bottom surfaces. 
The electric ﬁeld strength on the surfaces is denoted by upper E. Then, the surface integral 
in Eq. (1.25) is  2 pi a squared upper E. Since the total electric charge inside upper S is pi a squared sigma, Eq.  (1.25)

Chapter 2 
Conductors and Dielectric Materials 
Abstract This chapter covers electric phenomena in electric materials, which are 
classiﬁed into conductors and dielectric materials. When an external electric ﬁeld 
is applied to a conductor, the electric ﬁeld strength is zero inside the conductor due 
to induced electric charges on the surface. Conductors are equipotential. When an 
external electric ﬁeld is applied to a dielectric material, the electric ﬁeld penetrates 
the dielectric material, although its strength is weakened by polarization charges, 
which cannot move freely due to bonding to nuclei. The refraction of electric ﬁeld 
lines at an interface between different dielectric materials is explained. Capacitors 
made of such dielectric materials are introduced and we learn the capacitance of 
capacitors, which is the electric charge that can be stored by a unit electric potential 
difference, 1 V. 
2.1 
Conductors 
Electric materials are classiﬁed into conductors that can easily transport current 
and insulators that can hardly do so. Representative conductor materials are metals. 
Their electric properties originate from free electrons, i.e., true charges, that can 
move freely in the material. On the other hand, electrons in insulators cannot move 
freely because of their bonding to atomic nuclei. Hence, the electric behavior is quite 
different between conductors and insulators. Electrons in a conductor can move due 
to the Coulomb force in the electric ﬁeld and are distributed on the conductor surface 
in a steady state. In this case the applied electric ﬁeld and the electric ﬁeld produced 
by the distributed electric charge cancel each other, resulting in zero electric ﬁeld 
inside the conductor. If a part of the electric ﬁeld remains, it surely drives true charges, 
resulting in a contradiction of the hypothesis of a steady state. If some true charges 
remain in the interior of the conductor, they produce an electric ﬁeld, resulting in a 
similar contradiction. Such an induction of electric charges on the conductor surface 
under an applied electric ﬁeld is called electrostatic induction.

Conductors and Dielectric Materials
Fig. 2.1 Condition of 
electric ﬁeld near the surface 
of a conductor 
In an insulator in an applied electric ﬁeld, electric charges are slightly displaced 
by the Coulomb force but cannot move freely. Thus, the electric ﬁeld cannot be 
shielded completely and penetrates the material. Insulators are also called dielectrics 
or dielectric materials. 
As shown above, the electric ﬁeld strength and electric charge density are zero 
inside a conductor: 
bo ld i
talic upper E equals 0 comma

Equation (2.1) leads to 
phi equals c l
eft parenthesis const period right parenthesis period
That is, the conductor is equipotential. So, when an electric ﬁeld exists around a 
conductor, is must be normal to its surface, as illustrated in Fig. 2.1. 
Here, we assume the case in which electric ﬁeld upper E is applied normal to a conductor 
in the form of a wide slab. Before application, positive and negative electric charges of 
equal density are distributed uniformly, and an electrically neutral state was achieved. 
Positive and negative electric charges are slightly displaced in opposite directions by 
the applied electric ﬁeld, as shown in Fig. 2.2a. Thus, the electrically neutral state 
is maintained in the region where the distributions of positive and negative electric 
charges are overlapping, and electric charges appear on the surfaces of the conductor, 
as shown in Fig. 2.2b. We denote by plus or minus sigmathe densities of electric charges that appear 
on the surfaces of the conductor. Here, we determine the relation between sigma and 
the applied electric ﬁeld strength upper E. We apply Gauss’s law on a closed surface, as 
shown in Fig. 2.3. The electric ﬁeld strength is upper E outside the conductor and 0 inside 
the conductor. Since the electric ﬁeld lines do not go out of the side surface, the 
surface integral of the electric ﬁeld strength is equal to upper E upper S, where upper S is the area of 
the conductor surface inside the closed surface. Since the total electric charge inside 
the closed surface is sigma upper S, we have

The electric charges with densities plus or minus sigmaon the surface cancel the applied electric ﬁeld

Here, we consider the case in which an electric charge upper Q is given to a spherical 
conductor of radius a. Electric charge is uniformly distributed on the surface of the 
conductor, so the electric ﬁeld does not appear inside the conductor. From symmetry, 
the electric ﬁeld is directed radially outward, and we can determine the electric ﬁeld

The obtained results for the electric ﬁeld strength and electric potential are shown in 
Figs. 2.4 and 2.5, respectively. 
Next, we treat the case in which electric charge upper Q is given to the inner conductor of 
concentric spherical conductors, as shown in Fig. 2.6. The electric charge is uniformly 
distributed on the surface of the inner conductor, as discussed in the above example.

Then, electric charge appears on the inner surface of the outer conductor (r equals b) so  
that the electric ﬁeld does not penetrate the outer conductor. This electric charge is 
denoted by upper Q Subscript b. Here, we assume a concentric virtual sphere of radius r le ft p arenthesis b less than r less than c right parenthesis
and apply Gauss’s law on it. Since the virtual sphere is inside the outer conductor, the 
electric ﬁeld strength is zero on it. Thus, the total electric charge inside the sphere, 
up per Q plus upper Q Subscript b, is zero, and we have up e r Q Subscript b Baseline equals negative upper Q. Since no electric charge is given to the 
outer conductor, the electric charge that appears on the outer surface r equals c is upper Q. 
Thus, electric charges negative upper Q and upper Q are uniformly distributed on the surfaces of r equals b

Here, we considered the case in which the outer conductor is grounded (see 
Fig. 2.8). Grounding is a method to make the electric potential of a conductor zero 
by connecting it to the ground. Since the ground is sufﬁciently large, electric charge 
that can move is transferred to the ground. In the present case, the electric charge at 
r equals c is transferred to the ground. The electric charge at r equals b does not transfer, 
since it shields penetration of the electric ﬁeld into the outer conductor. The electric 
ﬁeld strength and electric potential in this case are

These results are shown in Fig. 2.9. 
The latter example shows that, when electric charge is surrounded by a grounded 
conductor, the effect of the inner electric charge does not appear outside. Or if some 
area is completely surrounded by a grounded conductor, the electric effect from 
outside does not go into the area. This is called electrostatic shielding.

Example 2.1 Suppose that electric charges uper Q 1 and uper Q 2 are given to the inner and 
outer conductors of the concentric spherical conductors in Fig. 2.6. Determine the 
electric ﬁeld strength and electric potential in each region. 
———————————————————————————————— 
Solution 2.1 First, we determine the distribution of electric charges. Electric charge 
uper Q 1 is uniformly distributed on the surface of the inner conductor (r equals a). The electric 
charge induced on the inner surface of the outer conductor at r equals b is determined 
to be negative upper Q Subscript 1 using Gauss’s law, and the principle of conservation of electric charge 
implies that the electric charge on the outer surface at r equals c is up er Q 1 plus upper Q 2. Thus, the 
electric ﬁeld strength is obtained to be

Solution 2.2 We denote by uper Q Subscript x the electric charge that appears on the right surface of

is up per Q minus upper Q Subscript x and the total electric charge that exist on the right side of this conductor is 
up per Q plus upper Q Subscript x. The two electric charges must be the same so that no electric ﬁeld appears 
in this conductor. Thus, we have

So, the electric charge on the left surface of this conductor is upper Q. The electric charge 
distribution in the right conductor can also be obtained in a similar manner, and the 
electric charges on each surface are upper Q, 0, 0, and upper Q from the left. Thus, the electric

2.2 
Image Method 
It is supposed that an electric charge q is placed at a distance a from an inﬁnitely wide 
conductor surface, as shown in Fig. 2.11a. The opposite electric charge is induced on 
the conductor surface to shield the inside against the electric ﬁeld produced by the 
applied electric charge. It may seem to be difﬁcult to determine the electric charge 
distribution on the conductor surface and the electric ﬁeld strength in the space. 
There is a special effective method to solve this problem, however. This is the image 
method, in which we use the equipotential property on the conductor surface and 
Eq. (2.4). 
Here, we use Cartesian coordinates with the x-y plane (z equals 0) on the conductor 
surface and the origin, O, at the foot of a perpendicular line from the electric charge. 
If there were no conductor, we would only have to place the opposite electric charge 
negative q at the position symmetric with respect to the conductor surface, as shown in 
Fig. 2.11b, to satisfy the condition of equipotential at the position of the conductor 
surface. Such a method of virtual removal of the conductor accompanied by placing 
an opposite electric charge at a mirror image position with respect to the conductor

which is now the position of the conductor surface, is equipotential, as shown in 
Fig. 1.8b. The virtual electric charge is called the image charge. The electric ﬁeld 
strength and electric potential obtained by this method are correct only in vacuum 
(z greater than 0). The electric ﬁeld strength on the conductor surface produced by the given 
electric charge and image charge is normal to the surface, as shown in Fig. 2.12, and

So, it is found that the total electric charge is equal to the image charge. 
Next, we shall calculate the Coulomb force between the given charge and the 
electric charge induced on the conductor surface. First, we determine the force due

Example 2.3 The electric charge on the conductor surface was determined above 
using the image method. Prove that the interior of the conductor is completely 
shielded by the induced electric charge given by Eq. (2.12). 
———————————————————————————————— 
Solution 2.3 The electric charge induced on the conductor surface also produces the 
electric ﬁeld inside the conductor. This electric ﬁeld is symmetric to that in vacuum 
with respect to the surface. Hence, the electric ﬁeld in the conductor produced by the 
induced electric charge is equal to that produced by an electric charge negative q placed at 
the position of q. Namely, the total electric ﬁeld strength is equal to that produced by 
q and negative q at the same place, i.e., the electric ﬁeld strength when no electric charge 
is given. Thus, the zero electric ﬁeld strength in the conductor can be proved.

2.3 
Capacitor and Capacitance 
Elements used to store electric charge in electric circuits are called capacitors or 
condensers. A capacitor is composed of two conductors. Since electric charge stays 
only on conductor surfaces, usually conductors have plate shapes with wide area. In 
addition, the distance between two plate conductors is kept small in order to store 
electric charges effectively with a small voltage, as shown in Fig. 2.13. A capacitor 
of such a type is called a parallel-plate capacitor. Usually, the distance between 
the two plate conductors, which are called electrodes, d, is much smaller the size of 
an electrode, upper S Superscript 1 divided by 2, where upper S is its surface area.

Conductors and Dielectric Materials
Fig. 2.13 Structure of 
parallel-plate capacitor 
Suppose that we give electric charge upper Q to one electrode of a capacitor, and ground 
the other electrode. Then, electric charge moves to the other electrode from the ground 
due to electrostatic induction. The electric charges are uniformly distributed facing 
each other on the two electrodes, as shown in Fig. 2.14. The density of electric charge 
on the upper electrode is upper Q divided by upper S, and if we apply Gauss’s law on a closed surface (a) 
shown by dotted line, it can be easily derived that the electric charge density on the 
lower electrode is equal to negative upper Q divided by upper S. That is, since the upper and lower surfaces are 
inside the conductor and the electric ﬁeld is parallel to the side surface of the closed 
surface, the electric ﬁeld lines do not go outside. This shows that the total electric 
charge is zero inside the closed surface. Thus, the electric ﬁeld is limited to within 
the narrow region between the two electrodes. If we add electric charge negative upper Q to the 
lower electrode instead of grounding it, we have the same condition. 
Here, we shall determine the capacitance, i.e., the electric charge that can be 
stored in a capacitor with a unit electric potential difference. Assume again that we 
give electric charge upper Q to one electrode and that the other electrode is grounded, as 
shown in Fig. 2.14. When we apply Gauss’s law on the closed surface (b), the electric 
ﬁeld strength in the space between the electrodes is determined to be 
up pe r E equals StartFraction upper Q Over epsilon 0 upper S EndFraction period
uppe r
 E equals StartFraction upper Q Over epsilon 0 upper S EndFraction period
This result can also be derived from Eq. (2.4). Thus, the electric potential difference 
between the two electrodes is

electric charge in the two 
electrodes and the electric 
ﬁeld between them

up p

The unit of capacitance is [C/V] and is newly deﬁned as [F] (farad). Hence, it is 
common to enlarge the area upper S and reduce the distance d, to obtain a large capacitance. 
It is also useful to ﬁll the space with a dielectric material with a dielectric constant
epsilon larger than epsilon 0. 
We regard the concentric spherical conductors in Fig. 2.6 as a kind of capac-
itor and determine its capacitance. When we apply electric charge upper Q to the 
inner conductor and ground the outer conductor, the electric potential is given by 
Eq. (2.10). Hence, the electric potential difference between the two conductors is 
up per V  equals left parenthesis b minus a right parenthesis upper Q divided by left parenthesis 4 pi epsilon 0 a b right parenthesis, and the capacitance is given by 
up per C equals StartFraction 4 pi epsilon 0 a b Over b minus a EndFraction period
up per C
 equals StartFraction 4 pi epsilon 0 a b Over b minus a EndFraction period
When the distance between the electrodes, d equa ls b minus a, is sufﬁciently small, 4 pi a b
is roughly equal to the area of the electrode upper S. Hence, it can be understood that this 
result agrees with the result for the parallel-plate capacitor, Eq. (2.18), in such a limit.

When the distance between the electrodes is sufﬁciently small that delta equals 1 minus b divided by a is 
much smaller than 1, the capacitance is approximately given by u p per C asymptotically equals 2 pi a l epsilon 0 divided by a delta, 
where we used the approximation, log le ft p a renthesis 1 plus delta right parenthesis asymptotically equals delta. Since 2 pi a l and a deltarepresent the 
area and distance of the electrodes, respectively, this result corresponds to that in 
Eq. (2.18).

2.4 
Dielectric Materials 
As described in Sect. 2.1, electrons are bonded to nuclei in a dielectric material, and 
hence, they cannot move freely to shield perfectly the material from applied electric 
ﬁeld. The dielectric material is shielded to some extent, however, due to displacement 
of bonded electrons. 
When an external electric ﬁeld is applied to a dielectric material, bonded electrons 
are displaced in the opposite direction, and nuclei with positive charges are displaced 
in the direction of the applied electric ﬁeld. Such a couple of positive and negative 
charges of equal magnitude that are displaced in the opposite directions to each other 
is called electric dipole. The quantity that expresses its strength quantitatively is 
electric dipole moment. When electric charges plus or minus q are displaced and the position 
vector directed from the negative charge to the positive charge is bold italic d (see Fig. 2.16), 
the electric dipole moment is given by

2.4 Dielectric Materials

alic p equals q bold italic d period
When many electric dipoles exist, the resultant electric dipole moment in a unit 
volume is called electric polarization and is denoted by bold italic upper P. Its unit is [C/m2]. Such 
a phenomenon of movement of different electric charges with opposite directions is 
also called electric polarization. 
When electric charges inside a dielectric material are displaced by an external elec-
tric ﬁeld, as shown in Fig. 2.17a, the electric ﬁeld inside the material is neutral because 
of cancellation, but some charges appear on the surfaces as shown in Fig. 2.17b. This 
is similar to the case of a conductor (see Fig. 2.2). The difference is that the electric 
charge on the surface is not true charge that can be transferred outside. This electric 
charge is called polarization charge. We denote the positive polarization charge 
density and the relative displacement by rho Subscript normal p and d, respectively. Then, the density of 
the positive polarization charge on the surface is sig ma Subscript normal p Baseline equals rho Subscript normal p Baseline d. On the other hand, the 
electric dipole in a unit volume is given by up per P equals rho Subscript normal p Baseline d from the deﬁnition, and hence,

we have

Namely, the magnitude of electric polarization is equal to the polarization charge 
density on the surface for a uniform electric polarization. 
When the electric polarization occurs, it produces an electric ﬁeld. This is the 
same as that produced by true electric charge. If it is denoted by bold italic upper E Subscript normal p, we have  
bol d  italic upper E Subscript p Baseline equals minus StartFraction bold italic upper P Over epsilon 0 EndFraction period

Note that the electric polarization weakens the applied electric ﬁeld. We denote by 
bold italic upper D divided by epsilon 0 the electric ﬁeld strength produced only by true electric charge. Then, the total 
electric ﬁeld is given by 
bo ld  i talic upper E equals StartFraction bold italic upper D minus bold italic upper P Over epsilon 0 EndFraction period
bol
d
 italic upper E equals StartFraction bold italic upper D minus bold italic upper P Over epsilon 0 EndFraction period
Then, bold italic upper D is given by 
bo l d ita lic
 upper D equals epsilon 0 bold italic upper E plus bold italic upper P
and is called the electric ﬂux density. The unit of electric ﬂux density is the same as 
that of electric polarization, [C/m2]. In general, bold italic upper P is, and hence, bold italic upper D is also proportional 
to the electric ﬁeld strength bold italic upper E. So, we can write it as 
bo l d  i
talic upper D equals epsilon bold italic upper E comma
where epsilon is called the dielectric constant. When we write epsilon as
e p silon
 equals epsilon 0 epsilon Subscript r Baseline comma
epsilon Subscript normal r is called the relative dielectric constant. The relative dielectric constants of 
various materials are listed in Table 2.1. Since bold italic upper D divided by epsilon 0 is the electric ﬁeld strength 
produced by true electric charge, Gauss’s law, which was given by Eq. (1.25), is 
written as

The surface integral of the electric ﬂux density given by the left-hand side is called 
the electric ﬂux. In other words, the electric charge density on the right-hand side 
of Eq. (1.25) includes the polarization charge.

Example 2.5 Assume that electric ﬁeld of strength uper E 0 is applied normal to the wide

Solution 2.5 Assume a closed surface S, as shown in Fig. 2.19a. We apply Gauss’s 
law, Eq. (2.27), on S. Since true charge does not appear on the surface of the dielectric 
material, the normal component of the electric ﬂux density is continuous between 
vacuum and the dielectric material. The electric ﬂux density in vacuum is epsilon 0 upper E 0. So, 
if we denote the electric ﬁeld strength in the dielectric material by upper E, the above 
continuity leads to epsilo n  0 upper E 0 equals epsilon upper E. Thus, we have

Since e p silon greater than epsilon 0, the electric ﬁeld strength is weaker inside the dielectric material, 
and the inside of the material is weakly shielded (see Fig. 2.19b). Thus, the electric

From Eq. (2.21), the polarization charge density on the surface is sig m a Subscript normal p Baseline equals negative upper P, taking 
account of the direction of the electric ﬁeld. Note that rhoincludes the polarization 
charge density in Eq. (1.25).

From the result of Example 2.5, it is shown that the normal component of the 
electric ﬂux density is continuous at the interface between materials with different 
dielectric constants, when there is no true charge on the interface. We denote by upper D Subscript 1 normal n
and upper D Subscript 2 normal n the normal components of the electric ﬂux density near the interface. Then, 
we have 
uppe r D Su

When a true charge exists on the interface, the continuity does not hold. Assume that 
true electric charge of surface density sigmaexists on the interface. Then, we have

where bold italic upper D 1 and bold italic upper D 2 are the electric ﬂux densities in materials 1 and 2, respectively, and

Here, we assume a closed rectangle C that contains the interface between two 
materials with different dielectric constants with both sides parallel to the interface, 
as shown Fig. 2.20. The electric ﬁeld strength in each dielectric material is denoted 
by bold italic upper E 1 and bold italic upper E 2, respectively. If we apply Eq. (1.17) on C in the limit h right arrow 0, we have

Here, we discuss the refraction of electric ﬁeld lines at the interface between 
different dielectric materials. Assume that electric ﬁeld strength uper E 1 is applied in 
material 1 with dielectric constant epsilon 1 in the direction of angle theta 1 from the normal 
direction to the interface, as shown in Fig. 2.21. The electric ﬁeld strength uper E 2 and its 
angle theta 2 in dielectric material 2 with epsilon 2 are determined using the boundary conditions. 
From the continuity of the parallel component of the electric ﬁeld strength given by 
Eq. (2.31), we have

Suppose that the space between the electrodes in a parallel-plate capacitor in 
Fig. 2.13 is fully occupied by a dielectric material with dielectric constant epsilon, and 
that the electric ﬁeld strength uper E 0 in Example 2.5 is produced by electric charges 
plus or minus upper Q. Then, the electric potential difference between the electrodes is obtained from 
Eq. (2.28) to be

When we apply a voltage to the capacitor, the electric ﬁeld strength in each region 
cannot be obtained in Exercise 2.6. When we give an electric charge to the capacitor, 
the charge density on the surface of the electrode facing each material cannot be 
obtained in Exercise 2.7. Thus, we have used the above solution methods. 
2.5 
Electrostatic Energy 
We suppose a process to transfer electric charge to a capacitor of capacitance upper C
using a power source. When the output voltage of the power source is u pper V prime, the electric 
charge of the capacitor is up per Q prime equals upper C upper V prime. On increasing the output voltage of the power 
source by de lta upper V prime from this condition, the electric charge, delt a upp er Q Superscript prime Baseline equals upper C delta upper V prime, is transferred to 
the capacitor. The work necessary to transfer this amount of electric charge is given 
from Eq. (1.16) by  
del ta u ppe r 
W equals upper C upper V prime delta upper V Superscript prime Baseline period
So, the work necessary while increasing the voltage from 0 to upper V is given by 
up pe

upper W 
equals integral Subscript 0 Superscript upper V Baseline upper C upper V prime normal d upper V Superscript prime Baseline equals one half upper C upper V squared period
Since this is the work done from the condition of no electric charge, i.e., the condition 
of no electric energy, we can regard this as the electrostatic energy that charged 
capacitor has. Using the relationship of Eq. (2.18), the electrostatic energy can also 
be expressed as 
up er U Subscript normal e Baseline equals one half upper C upper V squared equals one half upper Q upper V equals StartFraction 1 Over 2 upper C EndFraction upper Q squared period
upper U  Subscript normal e Baseline equals one half upper C upper V squared equals one half upper Q upper V equals StartFraction 1 Over 2 upper C EndFraction upper Q squared period
up per  U  Subscript normal e Baseline equals one half upper C upper V squared equals one half upper Q upper V equals StartFraction 1 Over 2 upper C EndFraction upper Q squared period
up er U
 Subscript normal e Baseline equals one half upper C upper V squared equals one half upper Q upper V equals StartFraction 1 Over 2 upper C EndFraction upper Q squared period
When the electrostatic energy of the parallel-plate capacitor in Fig. 2.13 is 
expressed using the corresponding electric ﬁeld strength in Eq. (2.17), we have 
up er U Subscript normal e Baseline equals one half epsilon 0 upper E squared upper S d comma
upper U Su
bscript normal e Baseline equals one half epsilon 0 upper E squared upper S d comma
where upper S d is the volume of the space in which the electric ﬁeld is concentrated and 
has a constant strength. So, we can consider

Steady Current 
Abstract This chapter covers electric phenomena when there is a steady current 
ﬂow. When a current is applied to a substance, an electric potential difference appears, 
and there is a proportional relationship between the current and the electric potential 
difference. This relationship is known as Ohm’s law on electric resistance. In this 
chapter, many examples of how to calculate resistance are shown. We learn also 
about the Joule loss that occurs when a current is applied to a substance with electric 
resistance. To realize a steady current in a closed circuit, we need an electric power 
source with an electromotive force. The fundamental principles on the behavior of 
electric circuits known as Kirchhoff’s law are given by the relationship between 
the electromotive force and the potential drop due to electric resistance, and by the 
fundamental feature of steady current. 
3.1 Current 
There are innumerable electrons that can move freely in a conductor such as a metal. 
When we impose an electric potential difference on a conductor, the electric ﬁeld 
drives electrons. Thus, the motion of electric charge, i.e., the current, occurs. To 
distinguish such a current from magnetizing current and displacement current, a 
current due to the motion of true charges is called true current. 
Current is a vector with magnitude and direction. When electric charge normal d upper Q passes 
through a cross-section of the conductor within a small time-interval normal d t, its magnitude 
is given by 
up per I equals StartFraction normal d upper Q Over normal d t EndFraction period
up e
r I equals StartFraction normal d upper Q Over normal d t EndFraction period
The unit of current is [C/s] and is newly deﬁned as [A] (ampere). The quantity that 
expresses the strength of the current is the current density bold italic i. Its direction is the same 
as that of the current, and when current normal d upper I passes through a cross-sectional area normal d upper S
perpendicular to the current direction, the magnitude is given by

Suppose that electric charge is distributed with density rhoinside region V. The 
principle of conservation of electric charge means that the increase in the total 
electric charge in the region in unit time is equal to the inﬂow of the current into the 
region. This is expressed as

where S is the surface of V, and normal d bold italic upper S is an elementary surface vector on S directed

3.2 Ohm’s Law 
It is necessary to apply a voltage to a material such as a metal so that a steady current 
ﬂows in it. In this case, it is empirically known that a proportional relationship holds 
between the voltage upper V and the current upper I: 
up per V
 equals upper R upper I comma
where the proportional constant upper R is called the electric resistance or simply resis-
tance. Electric resistance is determined by the shape and electric properties of the 
material. This is called Ohm’s law. The unit of electric resistance is [V/A] and is 
newly deﬁned as [normal upper Omega] (ohm). When the length and the area of the uniform cross-
sectional area are l and upper S, respectively, the electric resistance of the material is given 
by 
up per R
 equals rho Subscript normal r Baseline StartFraction l Over upper S EndFraction comma
up p
er R equals rho Subscript normal r Baseline StartFraction l Over upper S EndFraction comma
where rho Subscript normal r is a constant inherent to material called the resistivity or speciﬁc resis-
tance. Its  unit is [normal upper Omega m]. Values of the resistivity of various materials are listed in 
Table 3.1. There is no other material constant that varies as widely as the resistivity, 
and the electric property changes dramatically due to the difference in the resistivity. 
Materials with the resistivity less than 10 Superscript negative 6 Baseline normal upper Omegam that can easily transport a current are 
classiﬁed as conductors, those with resistivity above 10 Superscript 8 Baseline normal upper Omegam that can hardly do so are 
insulators, and those with intermediate resistivity are semiconductors. The constant,

Steady Current
Fig. 3.2 Small region in 
which current ﬂows under an 
electric potential difference 
is called the electric conductivity. Its unit is [S/m], where S is siemens.
Suppose that there is a small region in which a current ﬂows due to an electric 
ﬁeld, as sown in Fig. 3.2. The length of this region along the current is normal upper Delta l, and the 
cross-sectional area normal to the current is normal upper Delta upper S. When the electric ﬁeld strength 
and the current density are upper E and i, respectively, the electric potential difference and 
the current in this region are nor mal upper Delta upper V equals upper E normal upper Delta l and nor mal upper Delta upper I equals i normal upper Delta upper S, respectively. Hence, the 
electric resistance is 
up p er R equals StartFraction normal upper Delta upper V Over normal upper Delta upper I EndFraction equals StartFraction upper E Over i EndFraction dot StartFraction normal upper Delta l Over normal upper Delta upper S EndFraction period
up er  R equals StartFraction normal upper Delta upper V Over normal upper Delta upper I EndFraction equals StartFraction upper E Over i EndFraction dot StartFraction normal upper Delta l Over normal upper Delta upper S EndFraction period

up e
r R equals StartFraction normal upper Delta upper V Over normal upper Delta upper I EndFraction equals StartFraction upper E Over i EndFraction dot StartFraction normal upper Delta l Over normal upper Delta upper S EndFraction period
On the other hand, the electric resistance is deﬁned as 
up per 
R equals rho Subscript normal r Baseline StartFraction normal upper Delta l Over normal upper Delta upper S EndFraction period
up e
r R equals rho Subscript normal r Baseline StartFraction normal upper Delta l Over normal upper Delta upper S EndFraction period
Thus, we have the local relationship: up pe r E equals rho Subscript normal r Baseline i. Since the directions are the same 
between the electric ﬁeld and the current, this relationship is written as 
bo ld it
alic upper E equals rho Subscript normal r Baseline bold italic i
or 
bo ld ital
ic i equals sigma Subscript normal c Baseline bold italic upper E period
These are also called Ohm’s law. 
Electric behavior in such materials is quite different from that in vacuum. Electric 
charges are accelerated by an electric ﬁeld, and no steady state can occur in vacuum. In 
a material, on the other hand, electric charges move steadily without being accelerated 
in an electric ﬁeld. That is, electric charges, mostly electrons, are deaccelerated every 
time that they collide with atoms in the material. As a result, if averaged for a longer 
time, the speed is approximately constant, and a steady state is realized. Even in such 
a case, the electric potential can be deﬁned as in vacuum.

where upper S and sigma Subscript normal c are the cross-sectional area and electric conductivity of the circuit, 
and Eq. (1.17) was used. Thus, we have up per I equals 0, which contradicts the assumption of 
the steady current. 
As can be seen easily, it is necessary to have an electric power source to realize 
a steady current. The electric potential difference generated by the electric power 
source is the electromotive force, and its unit is [V]. Practical electric power sources 
and kinds of electromotive force are listed in Table 3.2. The electric energy of the 
electromotive force provided by the source is transformed from chemical, mechan-
ical, thermal, or optical energy. The electromotive force of electromagnetic induction, 
which is purely an electromagnetic phenomenon, as will be treated in Chap. 6, will 
be discussed from the viewpoint of electric circuits in Chap. 11. Here, we discuss 
a common electric power source that is not based on the electromagnetic induction 
and will treat only its output voltage. 
Suppose that there is a closed circuit with an electric power source of electromotive 
force upper V Subscript e m, as shown in Fig. 3.5. We denote the part containing the electric power

Thus, a steady current is realized by the electric power source. The electric potential

the circuit and is called the voltage drop. The features discussed above give the

basis of Kirchhoff’s law, which is s fundamental law of electric circuits and will be 
introduced in Chap. 11. 
3.4 Joule Loss 
When a current ﬂows in a usual material with electric resistance by applying a 
voltage, electric charges are not accelerated, and there is a steady current ﬂow. That 
is, the kinetic energy of the electric charges does not increase even when energy 
is supplied. So, the given energy is dissipated. Suppose that current upper I ﬂows under 
a potential difference upper V between the two edges of a material of some length. The 
amount of electric charge that is transferred during a small period normal upper Delta t is nor mal upper Delta upper Q equals upper I normal upper Delta t. 
The work done in this period is given by Eq. (1.16):
nor mal  up per  Del
ta upper W equals upper V normal upper Delta upper Q equals upper V upper I normal upper Delta t period
Hence, the work done, i.e., the energy dissipated, in unit time is 
up p er P equals StartFraction normal upper Delta upper W Over normal upper Delta t EndFraction equals upper V upper I period
up er P 
equals StartFraction normal upper Delta upper W Over normal upper Delta t EndFraction equals upper V upper I period
This is called the electric power. Its unit is [VA] and is deﬁned as [W] (watt). The 
dissipated electric power changes to heat, and such a loss is called the Joule loss. 
Using Ohm’s law, the electric power is rewritten as 
up per P e qual s upper R upper I squared equals StartFraction upper V squared Over upper R EndFraction period
up p
er P equals upper R upper I squared equals StartFraction upper V squared Over upper R EndFraction period
We assume the case of a material of length l and uniform cross-section of area upper S. The  
dissipated electric power in a unit volume, i.e., the dissipated electric power density 
is given by 
p eq uals StartFraction upper P Over l upper S EndFraction equals StartFraction upper V Over l EndFraction dot StartFraction upper I Over upper S EndFraction equals upper E i period
p e quals StartFraction upper P Over l upper S EndFraction equals StartFraction upper V Over l EndFraction dot StartFraction upper I Over upper S EndFraction equals upper E i period
p eq uals StartFraction upper P Over l upper S EndFraction equals StartFraction upper V Over l EndFraction dot StartFraction upper I Over upper S EndFraction equals upper E i period
p equal
s StartFraction upper P Over l upper S EndFraction equals StartFraction upper V Over l EndFraction dot StartFraction upper I Over upper S EndFraction equals upper E i period
Using the local Ohm’s law, this is rewritten as 
p equals s igma Sub

Current and Magnetic Phenomena 
Abstract This chapter covers magnetic phenomena in vacuum due to current. The 
Lorentz force works between currents. This magnetic reaction is considered to be 
caused by a magnetic distortion in space that is produced by other currents and this 
distortion is called magnetic ﬁeld. The magnetic ﬂux density is used as a quantity 
that expresses the strength of the magnetic ﬁeld. The local magnetic ﬂux density 
produced by currents is described by the Biot-Savart law. On the other hand, the 
global relationship between the current and the magnetic ﬂux density is described by 
Ampere’s law. This law is sometimes useful to determine the magnetic ﬂux density. 
4.1 
Magnetic Phenomena Due to Current 
The Lorentz force acts between currents. This is similar to the Coulomb force between 
electric charges. Hence, we can presume that currents also produce some ﬁeld in space 
similar to the electric ﬁeld produced by electric charges. This ﬁeld is the magnetic 
ﬁeld. Although the magnetic ﬁeld can also be produced by magnets rather than 
currents, only currents can be quantitatively deﬁned, and the magnetic interaction 
due to currents is described here. We use the magnetic ﬂux density to express the 
strength of the magnetic ﬁeld instead of the magnetic ﬁeld itself. The magnetic ﬁeld 
will be deﬁned in Chap. 5.

The magnitude of this force corresponds to that of the Coulomb force between linear

The unique difference is the difference of the directions of the forces. 
4.2 
The Biot-Savart Law 
The conditions of magnetic ﬂux lines can be visualized using magnetic particles such 
as iron ﬁlings. The structure of magnetic ﬂux lines produced by a straight current 
is schematically shown in Fig. 4.2. The magnetic ﬂux density vector is on a plane 
normal to the current, perpendicular to the radial vector, and forms vortices around it. 
This is completely different from the condition of the electric ﬁeld shown in Fig. 1.5. 
This difference is related to the fact that the source of the ﬁeld, i.e., the current, is a 
vector, while the source of the electric ﬁeld, i.e., the electric charge, is a scalar.

where the integral is a volume integral with respect to bold italic r prime. 
Magnetic ﬂux lines are deﬁned for the magnetic ﬂux density similarly to the 
electric ﬁeld lines for the electric ﬁeld. Since a magnetic ﬂux line is a closed line, as 
can be seen from the example in Fig. 4.2, when we integrate on an arbitrary closed 
surface S, it is expected that we have

This is because any magnetic ﬂux line that goes into a closed surface surely goes 
out from another position, since the line never terminates halfway. In fact, Eq. (4.8) 
is proven to be valid. This is a different point from the electric ﬁeld lines given by 
Eq. (1.25).

Forces on Currents 
The force on a current can be regarded as a force due to a magnetic distortion, i.e., the 
magnetic ﬂux density in space, similarly to the Coulomb force on electric charges. 
The force on an elementary current upper I normal d bold italic s in the magnetic ﬂux density bold italic upper B is 
nor mal d b old

This is called the Lorentz force and this relation is known as Fleming’s left-hand

Here, we shall determine the force between two parallel straight currents in Fig. 4.1a. 
The magnetic ﬂux density that current uper I 1 produces at the position of current uper I 2 is 
up per B equals mu 0 upper I 1 divided by left parenthesis 2 pi d right parenthesisand its direction is shown in Fig. 4.6. Hence, the force on current 
uper I 2 in a unit length is given by Eq. (4.1) and is attractive for uper I 1 upper I 2 greater than 0. 
Current is a ﬂow of particles with electric charges. If we denote the electric charge, 
number density, and velocity of a particle by q, n, and bold italic v, respectively, the current 
density is written as

Since bold italic upper B is parallel to normal d bold italic s, we have simply  bo ld it alic upper B dot normal d bold italic s equals upper B normal d s. In addition, the value of upper B
is given by up per B equals mu 0 upper I divided by left parenthesis 2 pi upper R right parenthesisfrom Eq. (4.9). Thus, we obtain
c
on
to ur in tegral 
Underscript normal upper C Endscripts bold italic upper B dot normal d bold italic s equals mu 0 upper I period
This result does not depend on the radius of the circle. In addition, the result is the 
same, even if C is not a circle but an arbitrary circuit that includes the current. When 
the current does not penetrate C but ﬂows outside C, the circular integral is zero. 
This is called Ampere’s law, and corresponds to Gauss’s law on the electric ﬁeld 
produced by electric charges. 
When current ﬂows with density bold italic i, Ampere’s law is written as

where S is the surface surrounded by C, and normal d bold italic s and normal d bold italic upper S follow the right-hand rule. 
That is, when a screw driver is rotated to the direction of normal d bold italic s, normal d bold italic upper S is directed in the 
direction of motion of a screw. 
Here, we show an example of determination of the magnetic ﬂux density using 
Ampere’s law. Suppose that a current of density i ﬂows uniformly along a long 
cylindrical conductor of radius a. In this case, we can easily calculate the magnetic 
ﬂux density using Ampere’s law, while it is not easy to use the Biot-Savart law. First, 
we shall determine the magnetic ﬂux density at a point of distance r left parenthesis less than a right parenthesisfrom the 
center of the cylinder. Suppose a virtual circle C of radius r on which the observation 
point is located, as shown in Fig. 4.10a. When Ampere’s law is applied on C, the 
magnetic ﬂux density has only the azimuthal component and takes on a constant 
value. Hence, the left side of Eq. (4.17) leads to

On the other hand, the total current through C is pi r squared i on the right side. Thus, the

up

er B equals StartFraction mu 0 r i Over 2 EndFraction period
Next, we shall determine the magnetic ﬂux density outside the cylinder. We apply 
Ampere’s law on a virtual circuit of radius r left parenthesis greater than a right parenthesiswith the origin on the central axis. 
The left side of Eq.  (4.17) is the  same  as  Eq. (4.18). The total current through C is 
pi a squared i. Thus, we have 
up per B equals StartFraction mu 0 a squared i Over 2 r EndFraction period

If we use the total current, up per I equals pi a squared i, it is found that the result of Eq. (4.20) is the  
same as that of Eq. (4.9). That is, the magnetic ﬂux density is the same as that in 
the case where all the current is concentrated on the center. The distribution of the 
magnetic ﬂux density is shown in Fig. 4.11.

Solution 4.4 Suppose a rectangle C that includes point A with two sides of length l
parallel to the plane and the other sides normal to the plane, as shown in Fig. 4.12. 
We apply Ampere’s law on C. We follow the right-hand rule for the direction of the

4.4 Ampere’s Law
69
circular integral with respect to the current direction. The direction of the magnetic 
ﬂux density is parallel to the plane, and hence, to the two sides. Hence, it is perpen-
dicular to the other two sides, and there is no contribution to the integral from these 
sides. Since the distance from the plane is the same for the two parallel lines, the 
magnitude of the magnetic ﬂux density is the same, which is denoted by upper B. Then, 
the left side of Eq. (4.17) is  2 l upper B. 
On the other hand, the current penetrating C is tau l. So, from Eq. (4.17) we have  
up per B equals StartFraction mu 0 tau Over 2 EndFraction comma
up per B equals StartFraction mu 0 tau Over 2 EndFraction comma
which is independent of the distance a from the plane. This is similar to the electric

Superconductors and Magnetic Materials 
Abstract This chapter covers magnetic phenomena in magnetic materials, which 
are classiﬁed into superconductors and magnetic materials in the narrow sense. When 
a superconductor is placed in a magnetic ﬂux density, the magnetic ﬂux density is 
zero inside the superconductor due to a current ﬂowing on its surface, similarly 
to electrical phenomena in a conductor in an electric ﬁeld. On the other hand, the 
internal magnetic ﬂux density is increased due to an effect of the internal magnetic 
moment for a magnetic material in a given magnetic ﬂux density. The magnetic 
ﬁeld is deﬁned as a quantity that corresponds to a magnetic ﬂux density produced 
only by true current. The refraction of magnetic ﬂux lines at an interface between 
different magnetic materials is explained. Coils made of such magnetic materials are 
introduced, and we learn the inductance of coils, which is the magnetic ﬂux that can 
be stored by unit current, 1 A. 
5.1 
Superconductors 
Magnetic materials are classiﬁed into superconductors and magnetic materials in 
the narrow sense, based on their magnetic behavior, which is similar with the classi-
ﬁcation of electric materials into conductors and dielectric materials (insulators). For

behavior of conductors represented by Eqs. (2.1) and (2.2). The perfect diamagnetic 
state given by Eq. (5.1) originates from true current ﬂowing on the superconductor 
surface. This current is called the Meissner current.

Superconductors and Magnetic Materials
Here, we assume that current is applied to a superconductor. When current of 
surface density tauis applied along the y-axis on the surface x equals 0 of the supercon-
ductor that occupies x greater than or equals 0, as shown in Fig. 5.1, the magnetic ﬂux density appears 
in a parallel direction to the superconductor surface. Here, we assume a rectangle 
C with sides parallel to the superconductor surface, and apply Eq. (4.17) on it. If 
we denote by l and upper B the length of the side of the rectangle along the y-axis and 
the magnetic ﬂux density on the surface, respectively, the left side is given by mu 0 tau l. 
Hence, we have [1] 
up per B 
equals mu 0 tau period
When an external magnetic ﬂux density upper B is applied parallel to a superconductor 
surface, the surface current of the density given by Eq. (5.3) ﬂows and the interior 
of the superconductor is shielded. This relationship corresponds to the relationship 
of (2.4) for a conductor. 
Thus, it is a common point between the conductor and superconductor that 
the source which shields the interior is true electric charge and its ﬂow, i.e., true 
current, both of which can be transferred outside. The perfect diamagnetism of 
superconductor can be described with the vector potential (see Appendix A.2). 
It is well known that the electric resistivity of superconductor is zero. Here, we 
shall prove it. Assume that a current is applied to the superconductor. Then, the 
current ﬂows on the surface of the superconductor as shown above. We suppose a 
rectangle C located inside the superconductor, where one side is placed on the surface 
and parallel to the current, as shown in Fig. 5.2. When the current is integrated along 
C, the integral is not zero, while the current is zero on the three sides inside the 
superconductor. Thus, we have

This contradicts Eq. (1.17), which describes the fundamental property of the 
electrostatic ﬁeld. So, the zero resistivity of a superconductor can be proved [1]. 
Here, suppose that current upper I is applied to a long superconducting cylinder of radius 
a. We shall treat the magnetic ﬂux density around the superconductor. Note that this 
is different from the case treated in Sect. 4.4, in which we apply the current to a usual 
long cylinder. The current does not ﬂow uniformly but ﬂows only on the surface of 
the superconductor. Assume circle C of radius r perpendicular to the central axis 
with the center on the axis, as shown in Fig. 5.3. We determine the magnetic ﬂux 
density at point A on the circle using Ampere’s law. The left side of Eq. (4.17) is  
equal to that of Eq. (4.18). Since the current that penetrates C is upper I, the right side of 
Eq. (4.17) is  mu 0 upper I. Thus, we have

b magnetic ﬂux lines outside the superconductor 
The magnetic ﬂux density outside the superconductor is the same as in the case in 
which all the current is concentrated on the central axis. It is easily derived that the 
magnetic ﬂux density inside the superconductor (r less than a) is zero. The magnetic ﬂux 
distribution around the superconductor is shown in Fig. 5.4. 
The value of the magnetic ﬂux density on the superconductor surface is mu 0 upper I divided by 2 pi a
and the surface current density there is tau equals upper I divided by 2 pi a. So, the relationship of Eq. (5.3) 
holds.

superconductors in the coaxial superconducting transmission line shown in Fig. 5.5.

Solution 5.1 Current ﬂows uniformly on the surface at r equals a, so that the inside is 
completely shielded in the inner superconductor. Then, current also ﬂows uniformly 
on the surface at r equals b to shield the outer superconductor. We assume a circle of

radius r lef t pa renthesis a less than r less than b right parenthesiswith the center on the central axis, and apply Ampere’s law 
on this circle. Since the magnetic ﬂux density is zero on the circle, the total current 
inside the circle is zero. Thus, the current that ﬂows on the surface at r equals b is minus upper I 1. 
Hence, the current that ﬂows on the outer surface of the outer superconductor at 
r equals c is up er I 1 plus upper I 2. 
Based on the above current distribution, the magnetic ﬂux density is obtained to

Solution 5.2 We denote by uper I Subscript x the current that ﬂows on the right surface of the

So, the current on the left surface of this superconductor is upper I. The current distribution

Image Method 
Suppose that current upper I ﬂows at a distance a from inﬁnitely wide superconductor 
surface, as shown in Fig. 5.7a. The current is induced on the superconductor surface 
to shield the inside against the magnetic ﬂux produced by the applied current. It 
may seem to be difﬁcult to determine the current distribution on the superconductor 
surface and the magnetic ﬂux density in the space. There is a special and effective 
method to solve this problem, however. This is the image method introduced in 
Sect. 2.2, and we use the property that the magnetic ﬂux density is parallel to the 
superconductor surface. 
Here, we use Cartesian coordinates with the x-y plane (z equals 0) on the supercon-
ductor surface. The y-axis (x equals 0) is deﬁned at the projection of the applied current 
on the surface. If there is no superconductor, we have only to place the opposite 
current negative upper I at the position symmetric with respect to the superconductor surface, 
as shown in Fig. 5.7b. The method of placing an opposite current at the position 
of the mirror image after virtual removal of the superconductor is also called the

The magnetic ﬂux density produced by the given and image currents satisﬁes the 
condition that the magnetic ﬂux density is parallel to the surface (up er B Subscript z Baseline equals 0) on the  
superconductor surface (z equals 0), as shown in Fig. 5.8. So, the magnetic ﬂux density 
produced by the two currents is correct in the vacuum area (z greater than 0). The magnetic 
ﬂux density on the superconductor surface is directed towards the x-axis and its value

Example 5.3 The current induced on the superconductor surface was determined 
using the boundary condition on the superconductor surface in the above. Prove that 
the interior of the superconductor is completely shielded by the induced current given 
by Eq. (5.8). 
———————————————————————————————— 
Solution 5.3 The current induced on the superconductor surface also produces 
the magnetic ﬂux density inside the superconductor. This magnetic ﬂux density 
is symmetric with that produced in vacuum with respect to the surface. Hence, the 
magnetic ﬂux density produced by the induced current in the superconductor is 
equal to that produced by a current negative upper I placed at the position of upper I. Namely, the total 
magnetic ﬂux density is equal to that produced by upper I and negative upper I at the same place, i.e., 
the magnetic ﬂux density when no current is given. Thus, the zero magnetic ﬂux 
density in the superconductor can be proved.

Suppose that a surface S is surrounded by closed loop C. The surface integral of the 
magnetic ﬂux density bold italic upper B on S is the magnetic ﬂux that penetrates C (see Fig. 5.9):

This is determined by C but is independent on S. The unit of magnetic ﬂux is [Tm2] 
and is newly deﬁned as [Wb] (weber). 
When a current is applied to a closed loop, the magnetic ﬂux that is thus produced 
penetrates the closed loop. The resultant magnetic ﬂux normal upper Phi is proportional to the current 
upper I and is expressed as
n ormal
 upper Phi equals upper L upper I period
The proportional constant upper L is a positive quantity determined by the shape of the 
closed loop and is called the inductance. The unit of inductance is [Wb/A] and is 
newly deﬁned as [H] (henry). 
The electric device used to store the magnetic ﬂux is the coil. It is usual to make 
a coil by winding wires in many turns to store a large amount of magnetic ﬂux, as 
shown in Fig. 5.10. A coil with a cylindrical shape is called a solenoid coil. Here, we 
shall determine the inductance of a long solenoid coil with radius of the cross-section 
a, length l, and total number of turns upper N. When current upper I is applied, the magnetic 
ﬂux is produced along the axial direction, as shown in Fig. 5.11. Here, we apply 
Ampere’s law on a closed rectangle inside the coil as in (a) in the ﬁgure. Since there 
is no magnetic ﬂux penetrating the rectangle, it can be said that the magnetic ﬂux 
density inside the coil is uniform. The same result can be obtained outside the coil. 
Since it is not realistic that the magnetic ﬂux density takes on a ﬁnite value even at a 
far distance, the magnetic ﬂux density outside the coil is concluded to be zero. Then, 
we apply Ampere’s law on a closed rectangle such as in (b) in Fig. 5.11. If we denote 
the magnetic ﬂux density inside the coil by upper B, the left side of Eq. (4.17) is  b upper B. Since 
the number of turns inside the rectangle is b upper N divided by l, the current penetrating it is b upper N upper I divided by l. 
Thus, we have up per B e quals mu 0 upper N upper I divided by l. The magnetic ﬂux penetrating one turn of the coil is

In the above upper L 11 and upper L 22 are self-inductances, and upper L 12 and upper L 21 are mutual 
inductances. For mutual inductances, the following relationship holds:

Magnetic Materials 
When an electric ﬁeld is applied to a dielectric material, electric dipole moments 
are induced due to the movement of polarization charges, and electric polarization 
takes place. If we apply an external magnetic ﬂux density to a magnetic mate-
rial, magnetic moments appear due to various mechanisms, and characteristic 
magnetic phenomena occur. This magnetic behavior is called magnetization, which 
is compared with electric polarization in dielectric materials. Electron spins and the 
orbital motion of electrons are known as the main origins of magnetic moments. It is 
well known that such magnetic properties can be equivalently expressed by a virtual 
closed current called magnetizing current, which cannot be transferred outside. 
On the other hand, the magnetization known for superconductors is caused by true 
currents. The magnetic moment in a unit volume is also called the magnetization, 
and is represented by bold italic upper M. 
Suppose that current upper I ﬂows on closed loop C, as shown in Fig. 5.15. If we  
represent by bold italic upper S the surface vector of this closed loop, which has a magnitude equal 
to the area of the loop and points along the direction of a screw when we rotate it in 
the current direction, the magnetic moment is given by 
bo ld i ta
lic m equals upper I bold italic upper S period
Suppose that a slab of a magnetic material is magnetized uniformly in the direction 
normal to its surface. When this slab is divided into small regions, as shown in 
Fig. 5.16a, the magnetic moment in each region can be expressed by the magnetizing 
current around it. These currents cancel out between adjacent planes, leaving only 
the magnetizing current ﬂowing on the periphery of the slab, as shown in Fig. 5.16b.

Here, we assume that a magnetic slab is uniformly magnetized by applying a 
parallel magnetic ﬂux density, as shown in Fig. 5.17. We determine the magnetic 
moment of the magnetic slab. An equivalent magnetizing current ﬂows on the surface 
of the magnetic material. We denote its surface density by tau Subscript m. Then, the total current 
is tau Subscript m Baseline upper L, and the total magnetic moment is tau Subscript m Baseline upper L upper S. Since the volume of the magnetic 
slab is upper L upper S, from the deﬁnition, the magnetization is given by 
up per M
 equals tau Subscript m Baseline period
Namely, the magnitude of the magnetization is equal to the surface density of the 
magnetizing current ﬂowing on the surface. The unit of magnetization is [A/m]. 
The permanent magnet is known as one type of magnetic materials. There are N 
and S poles in a permanent magnet. The like poles of two magnets repel each other, 
while as attractive force works between different poles. So, the magnetic interaction 
between magnets may seem to be caused by particles much like electric charges. 
Such an imaginary charge is called a magnetic charge. In reality, magnetic charge 
does not exist. If a magnet is divided into small pieces, it is not possible to pick up 
one type of magnetic charge, and two types of magnetic poles exist, as shown in 
Fig. 5.18a. This situation can be explained by the equivalent magnetizing current, as 
shown in Fig. 5.18b.

When a magnetic material exits, the magnetic ﬂux density may be produced not 
only by true current, but also by magnetizing current. We denote by bold italic upper B Subscript m the magnetic 
ﬂux density produced by magnetizing current, then, we have

If the magnetic ﬂux density due to true current is given by mu 0 bold italic upper H, the total magnetic

rials, except for ferromagnetic materials, etc., bold italic vis proportional to bold italic upper H, and hence, bold italic upper B
is also proportional to bold italic upper H. Then, we can write bold italic upper H as

Solution 5.6 Suppose a closed rectangle C, as shown in Fig. 5.20a. We apply 
Ampere’s law, Eq. (5.28), on C. Since true current does not ﬂow on the surface of the 
magnetic material, the parallel component of the magnetic ﬁeld strength is contin-
uous between vacuum and the magnetic material. As the magnetic ﬁeld strength in 
vacuum is upper B 0 divided by mu 0, if we denote the magnetic ﬂux density inside the magnetic material 
by upper B, the above continuity leads to upper B 0 divided by mu 0 equals upper B divided by mu. Thus, we have  
up pe r B equals StartFraction mu Over mu 0 EndFraction upper B 0 period

B equals StartFraction mu Over mu 0 EndFraction upper B 0 period
Since m u  greater than mu 0, the magnetic ﬂux density is larger inside the magnetic material (see 
Fig. 5.20b). This is different from the smaller electric ﬁeld strength inside a dielectric 
material due to the shielding by polarization charges, as argued in Example 2.5. Thus, 
the magnetization is determined to be

From Eq. (5.21), the magnetizing current density on the surface is tau  S ubscript m Baseline equals upper M. This  
can be directly derived from Eq. (4.17) (Note that bold italic i includes the magnetizing current 
density.).

From the result of Example 5.6, it is shown that the parallel component of the 
magnetic ﬁeld strength is continuous at the interface between materials with different 
magnetic permeabilities, when there is no true current on the interface. If we denote 
by upper H Subscript 1 t and upper H Subscript 2 t the parallel components of the magnetic ﬁeld strength in each material 
near the interface, we have

where bold italic upper H 1 and bold italic upper H 2 are the magnetic ﬁeld strengths in materials 1 and 2, respectively,

material 1. 
Here, we assume a small closed surface S that contains part of the interface 
between two materials with different magnetic permeabilities with two wider surfaces 
parallel to the interface, as shown in Fig. 5.21. The magnetic ﬂux densities in the two 
magnetic materials are denoted by bold italic upper B 1 and bold italic upper B 2, respectively. If we apply Eq. (4.8) on  
S, we have

where upper B Subscript 1 n and upper B Subscript 2 n are the normal components of bold italic upper B 1 and bold italic upper B 2, respectively. Thus, the 
normal component of the magnetic ﬂux density is continuous on the interface. This 
condition is independent of the surface current. Equation (5.32) can be generally 
expressed as

Here, we discuss the refraction of magnetic ﬂux lines at the interface between 
different magnetic materials. Assume that magnetic ﬂux density uper B 1 is applied in 
material 1 with magnetic permeability mu 1 in the direction of angle theta 1 from the normal 
direction to the interface, as shown in Fig. 5.22. The magnetic ﬂux density uper B 2 and 
its angle theta 2 in the magnetic material with mu 2 are determined using the boundary 
conditions. From the continuity of the normal component of the magnetic ﬂux density 
given by Eq. (5.32), we have

Solution 5.8 We apply current upper I to the superconducting transmission line. The 
magnetic ﬂux density in the space between the two superconducting plates is parallel 
to the plates. So, the magnetic ﬂux density is continuous across the interface from 
the boundary condition given by Eq. (5.32). This yields a difference of the magnetic 
ﬁeld strength between the two magnetic materials, resulting in a difference in the 
current density ﬂowing on the superconductor surface between the regions facing 
different magnetic materials. This is similar to the difference in the surface electric 
charge density on a conductor surface between the regions facing different dielectric 
materials in the capacitor treated in Example 2.7. Such a situation can be realized 
only for a superconductor in which Ohm’s law does not hold. If we denote by upper B the

Time-Dependent Electromagnetic 
Phenomena 
Abstract This chapter covers electromagnetic phenomena that change with time. 
One of them is expressed by Faraday’s law on electromagnetic induction. We learn 
about magnetic energy as an equivalent electric energy by using this law. We also learn 
the principles behind the generation of electricity and transformers. Another one is the 
displacement current, which appears in a capacitor: Although true alternating current 
does not ﬂow across the space between the electrodes, the displacement current ﬂows 
instead of it. Maxwell’s theory is completed with these new items. The skin effect and 
electromagnetic wave are treated as examples of these new items. We also learn the 
important law of reﬂection and Snell’s law for refraction of electromagnetic wave. 
6.1 Electromagnetic Induction 
In a steady state in which electric and magnetic ﬁelds do not change with time, the 
electric ﬁeld strength is given by the electric potential, and Eq. (1.17) holds for any 
closed loop C:

When the magnetic ﬂux normal upper Phi penetrating C changes with time, however, the electro-
motive force appears:

Such a phenomenon is called electromagnetic induction, and upper V Subscript em is the induced 
electromotive force. Equation (6.2) is called  Faraday’s law. In the above, the direc-
tion of normal upper Phi is taken to be positive, when it points to the direction of motion of a screw 
under a rotation of a screw driver in the direction of the current in C (see Fig. 6.1). 
Thus, Eq. (6.2) shows that the electromotive force occurs to reduce a change in

Eq. (6.2) includes the variation of the magnetic ﬂux density and/or that of C with

appears in the circuit. Since other parts besides the bar ab does not move, the elec-
tromotive force is speculated to occur in ab. Hence, the induced electric ﬁeld upper E has 
a magnitude upper B vand is directed from b to a. This is written in the form of a vector as

which is known as Fleming’s right-hand rule.

change with time, this equation holds generally.

Solution 6.1 When current is applied to the coil in the direction shown by the

ﬂux penetrating one turn of the coil is phi equa ls a  b upper B cosine omega t. Hence, the total magnetic

and this is called self-induction. Suppose that there are two coils, as shown in

Coil A of number of turns uper N Subscript upper A and coil B of number of turns uper N Subscript upper B are wound on 
a magnetic material of cross-sectional area upper S and large magnetic permeability mu, as  
shown in Fig.  6.4. Suppose that current up er I  Sub script upper A Baseline equals upper I sine omega t is applied to coil A and coil B is 
short-circuited. Then, we shall determine the current ﬂowing in coil B. The magnetic 
ﬂux in the magnetic material produced by the current in coil A is n ormal up er P hi equals mu upper S upper N Subscript upper A Baseline upper I sine omega t. 
Since the magnetic permeability is large, this magnetic ﬂux penetrates coil B and the 
electromotive force in coil B is

Then, uper I Subscript upper B is determined to be

Solution 6.3 The electric ﬁeld induced in sides AB and CD is perpendicular to

This is called the magnetic energy. Using the relationship in Eq. (5.13), the magnetic 
energy is also expressed as

When current upper I is applied to a solenoid coil of radius a, length l, and number 
of turns upper N, as shown in Fig. 5.10, the magnetic energy is given by Eqs. (5.16) and 
(6.15). When this is expressed using the magnetic ﬂux density, up per B e quals mu 0 upper N upper I divided by l, we

permeability mu, we can replace mu 0 in Eq. (6.17) by  mu.

6.3 Displacement Current 
We have treated steady currents which do no change with time and magnetic 
phenomena caused by steady currents. Here, we treat the case in which current 
changes with time. Suppose a closed line C that forms the boundary of two different 
hemispherical surfaces S1 and S2, as shown in Fig. 6.7a, b. Ampere’s law given by 
Eq. (5.28) holds for each of S1 and S2. If we sum up Ampere’s law for each case, the 
sum of the circular integral on C is naturally zero, since the direction of the integral 
is opposite between (a) and (b). The corresponding sum of the surface integral is the 
surface integral on the closed surface formed by S1 and S2, which is now denoted by 
S12 (see Fig. 6.7c), and we have

and Eq. (3.5) for a steady state is derived. This means, however, that Ampere’s law

instead of Ampere’s law, there is no contradiction, where S is a surface on C. The 
second term, partial differential bold italic upper D divided by partial differential t, in this equation is called the displacement current and is 
different from the true current, i.e., a ﬂow of true charges. This equation leads to 
Ampere’s law in the steady state. Hence, there is no problem. Equation (6.20) is  
called the generalized Ampere’s law. 
Here, we show an example of the displacement current in a capacitor. When 
current upper I ﬂows into a capacitor, as shown in Fig. 6.8a, electric charge upper Q on the 
electrode changes. We assume a closed loop C around a wire through which the 
current ﬂows and surface S1 as in this ﬁgure. Then, the displacement current is zero, 
and only current density bold italic i exists on the right side of Eq. (6.20). Thus, the right side 
of the equation leads to the current upper I. 
Next, we assume another surface S2 that does not contain the wire, as shown in 
Fig. 6.8b. On this surface, bold italic i is zero and the right side of Eq. (6.20) is

phenomena. Suppose that an alternating electric ﬁeld of amplitude uper E 0 and angular 
frequency omegais applied parallel to the surface of a semi-inﬁnite material that occupies

trates into the material. We denote the dielectric constant, magnetic permeability, 
and electric conductivity by epsilon, mu, and sigma Subscript c, respectively.

Equation (6.23) holds. 
Since the external electric ﬁeld is applied in the direction of the y-axis, we can 
assume that the interior electric ﬁeld has only the y-component. In addition, we can 
also assume that the quantities are uniform in the wide y-z plane, which allows us 
to presume that they vary along only the x-axis. It is found from Eq. (6.23) that the 
magnetic ﬂux density has a component normal to the electric ﬁeld. Equation (6.26) 
shows that it is the z-component as follows: Suppose a rectangular parallelepiped 
with each surface normal to the x, y, or  z-axis for S' in Eq. (6.26). If the magnetic 
ﬂux density has an x-component, its value must be a constant up to inﬁnity, which 
is not realistic. 
Suppose a rectangle C in the regions from x to x p lus normal upper Delta x and from y to y p lus normal upper Delta y in 
Eq. (6.23), as shown in Fig. 6.10. If normal upper Delta x and normal upper Delta y are sufﬁciently small, the left side

ﬁeld strength propagates along the depth from the surface while decaying. Thus, the

6.6 Electromagnetic Waves 
Here, we shall treat electromagnetic waves in vacuum. Suppose that the electric ﬁeld 
strength has only a y-component. There is no electric charge (rh o equals 0) in vacuum, 
and Eq. (6.25) is reduced to Eq. (6.31). Thus, it can be shown that the electric ﬁeld 
strength does not depend on y. Namely, if we assume a rectangular parallelepiped 
with each surface normal to the x, y, or  z-axis for S', there are contributions only 
from the surface normal to the y-axis to the integral, but these are zero. It is shown 
by Eq. (6.23) that the magnetic ﬂux density has a component normal to the electric 
ﬁeld. We assume that the magnetic ﬂux density has a z-component. We suppose C 
as shown in Fig. 6.11, and then, Eq. (6.23) leads to Eq. (6.33).

Here, we treat the reﬂection and refraction of planar electromagnetic wave. 
Suppose a planar interface z equals 0 between media 1 and 2 with dielectric constants epsilon 1
and epsilon 2 and magnetic permeabilities mu 1 and mu 2, respectively, as shown in Fig. 6.13a, 
and a planar electromagnetic wave propagates from medium 1 to the interface. The 
plane formed by the propagation direction and the direction (z-axis) normal to the 
interface is called the plane of incidence. We deﬁne the x-axis as the line at which 
the plane of incidence and the interface meet and the y-axis on the interface in such 
a way that it is normal to both the x- and z-axes. 
In this case the incident and reﬂected waves are in medium 1, and the transmitted 
wave is in medium 2. We denote by bold italic k, bold italic k double prime, and bold italic k prime the wavenumbers of the incident,

reﬂected, and transmitted waves, respectively. Each wave propagates in the direction 
of its wavenumber vector and these wavenumber vectors lie on the plane of incident 
(x-z plane). The angles of the wave numbers, bold italic k, bold italic k double prime, and bold italic k prime, from the z-axis are 
denoted by theta, theta double prime, and theta prime, respectively, as shown in Fig. 6.13b. The variation of each 
wave with time is the same, and the phase is given by omega t. The incident, refracted, 
and transmitted waves are expressed as

The electric ﬁeld strength bold italic upper E and the magnetic ﬂux density bold italic upper B are perpendicular to 
each other, and both lie on a plane normal to the propagation direction. For example, bold italic upper E
and bold italic upper B are normal to bold italic k for the incident wave. Here, we treat the boundary conditions 
to be satisﬁed for bold italic upper E and bold italic upper B. These are given by Eqs. (2.30), (2.32), (5.31), and 
(5.33). When there is no electric charge and no current on the interface, the parallel 
components of the electric ﬁeld strength and magnetic ﬁeld strength are continuous, 
and the normal components of the magnetic ﬂux density and electric ﬂux density are 
continuous across the interface. That is,

Direct Current Circuit 
Abstract In this chapter, we treat direct current circuits composed of resistors and 
direct current power sources (voltage source and/or current source), and determine 
the current and combined resistance. Intuitive and analytic solution methods are 
described and compared for deeper understanding. The Wheatstone bridge, which 
is a fundamental bridge circuit to measure unknown resistance, is introduced. We 
also learn the condition of matching, under which the maximum output power can 
be obtained from an electric power source with internal resistance. 
7.1 
Resistance and Ohm’s Law 
Suppose that when we apply voltage upper V [V] to a circuit element as shown in Fig. 7.1a, 
current upper I [A] ﬂows through it. If upper V and upper I obey Ohm’s law given by 
up per V
 equals upper R upper I comma
this circuit element is called resistor. The proportional constant, upper R, is the  resistance. 
When we express this relationship as 
up per I 
equals upper G upper V comma
up per G equals 1 divided by upper R is called the conductance. Its unit is [S] (siemens). 
The resistor is represented by a symbol shown in Fig. 7.1b. The arrow for the 
voltage upper V shows that the electric potential at terminal A is measured from the refer-
ence point B, and is related to the direction of the current. When the direction of the 
current is reversed with an unchanged arrow for the voltage, the current is up p er I equals negative upper V divided by upper R. 
Suppose that resistors with resistances uper R 1 and upper R 2 are connected as shown in 
Fig. 7.2. This connection is called connection in series. It is assumed that current 
upper I ﬂows when voltage upper V is applied between the terminals. In this case the voltage 
applied to each resistor is up er V 1 equals upper R 1 upper I and up er V 2 equals upper R 2 upper I. So, the total voltage is

the currents ﬂowing through the resistors are up er I 1 equals upper V divided by upper R 1 and up er I 2 equals upper V divided by upper R 2. So, the

7.2 
Electric Power Source 
An electric power source is an element of electric circuits that has electromotive 
force. There are direct voltage sources and direct current sources in direct current 
(DC) circuits. The electric power source in alternating current (AC) circuits will be 
mentioned in Chap. 8. 
7.2.1 
Direct Voltage Source 
When a load is connected to the two terminals, a direct current (DC) voltage source 
provides a constant electromotive force with time independently of the resistance of 
the load. The symbol of a DC voltage source is shown in Fig. 7.6a, where upper E is 
the electromotive force and the ﬁgure shows that the electric potential is higher at 
terminal A. Although it may be consistent to use upper V Subscript em for the electromotive force as 
done in Chap. 3, we use  upper E from now on, based on the custom for electric circuits. 
Note, however, that it is different from the electric ﬁeld strength. When a resistor 
with resistance upper R is connected to a direct voltage source of electromotive force upper E, 
as shown in Fig. 7.6b, the current that ﬂows through the resistor is 
up pe r I equals StartFraction upper E Over upper R EndFraction period
up p
er I equals StartFraction upper E Over upper R EndFraction period
In this case, the voltage between the two terminals of the resistor, i.e., the voltage 
drop is 
up per V  equ
als upper R upper I equals upper E comma

Direct Current Circuit
Fig. 7.6 a Symbol of DC 
voltage source and b the case 
in which a DC voltage source 
is connected to a resistor 
as shown in Fig. 7.7, and it is equal to the electromotive force of the DC voltage 
source. 
In practical cases, when the resistance of the load becomes small, the relation 
given by Eq. (7.9) does not hold, and the current becomes smaller than the expected 
value as 
up p
er I equals StartFraction upper E Over upper R plus upper R 0 EndFraction period
up per I
 
equals StartFraction upper E Over upper R plus upper R 0 EndFraction period
This is because there is a power loss even in the electric power source through which 
current ﬂows, and uper R 0 in Eq. (7.11) is called the internal resistance. The equivalent 
circuit of a DC voltage source with an internal resistance is shown in Fig. 7.8. An  
ideal DC voltage source without internal resistance cannot be shunted, as shown 
in Fig. 7.9a, since the current diverges. When the voltage source contains internal 
resistance, it is possible, as shown in Fig. 7.9b. When a resistor with resistance upper R is 
connected to a DC voltage source of electromotive force upper E and internal resistance 
upper R 0, as shown in Fig. 7.10, the current is given by Eq. (7.11), and the voltage across 
the resistor is

Thus, the internal resistance must be sufﬁciently smaller than the load resistance to 
realize an ideal voltage source that can apply voltage upper E to the load resistor. Or, the 
resistance of the load resistor must be sufﬁciently larger than the internal resistance 
of the voltage source to use it as an ideal source. 
We do not suppose that there is internal resistance in DC voltage sources, except 
in the designated cases.

Direct Current Circuit
7.2.2 
Direct Current Source 
When a load is connected to the two terminals, a direct current (DC) source provides 
a constant current with time independently of the resistance of the load. The symbol 
of a DC current source is shown in Fig. 7.11a, where upper J is the current supplied by 
the current source, and the ﬁgure shows that the current ﬂows from B to A. When a 
resistor of resistance upper R is connected to a DC current source, as shown in Fig. 7.11b, 
the voltage across the resistor is 
up per V
 equals upper R upper J period
When the load resistance becomes large, it is not possible to give a constant current 
upper J. In an extreme case where the two terminals of the current source are opened, current 
must be zero. So, we assume also an internal resistance uper R 0 for direct current source, 
as shown in Fig. 7.12. Suppose that a resistor of resistance upper R is connected to the 
DC current source, as shown in Fig. 7.13. We denote the current ﬂowing through the 
resistor by upper I, while the current ﬂowing through the internal resistance is up per J minus upper I. Since 
the voltage across each resistance is the same, we have upp er R up per I equals upper R 0 left parenthesis upper J minus upper I right parenthesis. Then, the 
current is given by 
up pe
r I equals StartFraction upper R 0 upper J Over upper R plus upper R 0 EndFraction equals StartFraction upper J Over 1 plus left parenthesis upper R divided by upper R 0 right parenthesis EndFraction period
up per I
 
equals StartFraction upper R 0 upper J Over upper R plus upper R 0 EndFraction equals StartFraction upper J Over 1 plus left parenthesis upper R divided by upper R 0 right parenthesis EndFraction period
up per I equa
ls StartFraction upper R 0 upper J Over upper R plus upper R 0 EndFraction equals StartFraction upper J Over 1 plus left parenthesis upper R divided by upper R 0 right parenthesis EndFraction period
Thus, the internal resistance must be sufﬁciently larger than the load resistance to 
realize an ideal current source that can apply current upper J to the load resistor, or the 
resistance of load resistor must be sufﬁciently smaller than the internal resistance of 
the current source to use it as an ideal source.

In fact, the current given by Eq. (7.11) becomes up per I e qu als upper E divided by upper R 0 equals upper J for a DC voltage

voltage source acts as a current source. 
We do not suppose internal resistance in DC current sources either, except in the 
designated cases.

Suppose that resistances uper R 1 and uper R 2 are known and uper R 4 is unknown. If we adjust uper R 3
so that current does not ﬂow through BC, we can determine uper R 4 from Eq. (7.21) by  
substituting the values of upper R 1, upper R 2, and upper R 3. The Wheatstone bridge is used for the 
measurement of unknown resistances in this way. 
Here, we compare the two resistor circuits shown in Fig. 7.15a, b. Then, it can be 
easily found that the voltages across and the current ﬂowing through each resistor 
are the same. The circuit in Fig. 7.15a has the same structure as that in Fig. 7.14, 
and the circuit in Fig. 7.15b is realized by connecting points B and C in the circuit in 
Fig. 7.15a. It can be seen that the voltage between B and C is zero, using Eq. (7.21). 
This is the reason why current does not ﬂow between B and C, even if the two points 
are connected. In addition, the same result is obtained even if B and C are connected 
through a resistor with any resistance.

Solution 7.3 Since the voltage across the 4 normal upper Omega resistor is 6 V, the other 6 V is applied 
across the 6 normal upper Omega resistor. Hence, current of 1 A ﬂows through this resistor. This means 
that the current that ﬂows through resistor upper R is 0.5 A. Thus, we can obtain the solution 
without determining the unknown resistance upper R, which is 12 normal upper Omega. It is possible to solve 
the problem after determining upper R. In this sense, this problem is imperfect. On the 
other hand, we can effectively solve the problem, as shown here. It is important to 
see the essential point without being affected by custom.

and the voltage of 4 V is applied to it. Then, the voltage across 2 upper R is 8 V, and upper R prime must 
be equal to upper R. Thus, we obtain upper R s quared plus 2 upper R minus 24 equals 0. This leads to lef t paren thesis upper R plus 6 right parenthesis left parenthesis upper R minus 4 right parenthesis equals 0,

Here, we shall determine the combined resistance between A and B in the tetra-
hedral resistor circuit composed of 6 resistors with resistance upper R shown in Fig.  7.18. 
If we ﬁnd that the voltage between C and D is zero due to symmetry when we apply 
a voltage between A and B, we can solve this problem easily. Since current does not 
ﬂow through the resistor between C and D, we can remove it. Then, three resistor 
branches with resistances upper R, 2 upper R through C, and 2 upper R through D are connected in 
parallel between A and B. Thus, the combined resistance is determined to be upper R divided by 2.

which points C and D are short-circuited is the given connection. This is because 
the electric potential difference is zero between C and D. Since the resistance of the

We solved the problem in Example 7.5 using a symmetry condition. Such a method 
is not always successful, however. Then, it is necessary to solve the problem analyt-
ically with unknown variables. Suppose that voltage upper V is applied between the two 
terminals. Then, three currents are used as unknown variables, as shown in Fig. 7.21. 
There is a relation, up er  I 1 equals upper I 2 plus upper I 3, among the three currents upper I 1, upper I 2, and upper I 3. The  
current ﬂowing through branch AC must be upper I 2, and that ﬂowing through branch BC 
must be upper I 3, since no current ﬂows from the lower half from symmetry. Since the 
voltage between upper C prime and C through A and that through B is common, we see that 
up er I 2 equals upper I 3. Thus, the voltage between upper D prime and D through A is given by 
up per V equals upper R upper
 I 1 plus 2 upper R upper I 2 plus upper R upper I 1 equals 3 upper R upper I 1 period
Since the total current in this resistor circuit is up per I equals 2 upper I 1, the resistance of the circuit 
is determined to be 
StartFraction upper V Over upper I EndFraction equals three halves upper R period
St artFraction upper V Over upper I EndFraction equals three halves upper R period
St ar
tFraction upper V Over upper I EndFraction equals three halves upper R period
It may be necessary to use many unknown variables depending on the problems. 
We discuss the number of necessary variables in Chap. 11. 
Next, we shall determine the current ﬂowing through branch BC in the circuit 
shown in Fig. 7.22. In this case the voltage between B and C is unknown, and it is 
not easy to determine the current. So, we use unknown variables. We denote by uper I 1
and uper I 3 the currents ﬂowing through the resistors uper R 1 and upper R 3, respectively. The current 
upper I is deﬁned to ﬂow from B to C. Then, from the continuity of currents, the currents 
uper I 2 and uper I 4 ﬂowing through the resistors of uper R 2 and uper R 4 are respectively given by

7.3 Resistor Circuit
135
Fig. 7.22 Resistor circuit 
Since all the currents ﬂowing through each resistor can be given, the voltages across 
each resistor can be obtained. Since the unknown variables are upper I, upper I 1, and upper I 3, we need 
three independent conditions. First, the voltage between A and D through B is equal 
to upper E. Thus, we have  
uper R 1 uppe r I 1 plus
 upper R 2 left parenthesis upper I 1 minus upper I right parenthesis equals upper E period
Next, the voltage between A and D through C is also equal to upper E: 
uper R 3 uppe r I 3 plus
 upper R 4 left parenthesis upper I 3 plus upper I right parenthesis equals upper E period
Another condition is for the voltage between A and C, which is given by 
uper R 1 u pper I 1
 plus upper R upper I equals upper R 3 upper I 3 period
We have other conditions. The number of independent conditions is three, however, 
and we can solve the problem with the above conditions. 
Using Eq. (7.25), uper I 1 is expressed as 
up er  I  1 equals StartFraction upper E plus upper R 2 upper I Over upper R 1 plus upper R 2 EndFraction comma
up er I 
1
 equals StartFraction upper E plus upper R 2 upper I Over upper R 1 plus upper R 2 EndFraction comma
and using Eq. (7.26), uper I 3 is expressed as 
up er  I  3 equals StartFraction upper E minus upper R 4 upper I Over upper R 3 plus upper R 4 EndFraction period
up er I 
3
 equals StartFraction upper E minus upper R 4 upper I Over upper R 3 plus upper R 4 EndFraction period
Substitution of these equations into Eq. (7.27) leads to

Thus, if the condition uper R 2 upper R 3 equals upper R 4 upper R 1 is satisﬁed, the voltage between B and C is 
zero, and current does not ﬂow through the resistor upper R in this case also. 
Problems can be solved effectively using unknown variables, as shown above. This 
method is useful for complicated circuits. Such solution methods are systematically 
introduced in Chap. 11.

Electric Power in Resistor 
In the condition where current upper I ﬂows through a resistor of resistance upper R under voltage 
upper V , the electric power given by Eq. (3.22) is not stored as energy but is dissipated, 
resulting in a Joule heat. That is, the electric power in this case is the energy dissipated 
in unit time (1 s). 
Suppose that a resistor upper R is connected to a DC voltage source with electromotive 
force upper E and internal resistance upper R 0, as shown in Fig. 7.25. The current ﬂowing through 
the resistor is up per I e quals upper E divided by left parenthesis upper R plus upper R 0 right parenthesisand the electric power is

Chapter 8 
Transient and Steady Responses 
of Electric Circuits 
Abstract In this chapter we learn the relationships between the applied voltage and 
the current for each element of the circuit, i.e., resistor, capacitor, and inductor coil. 
Then, we learn analytic methods to solve the response of the circuit composed of 
these elements, such as the transient response when a DC voltage source is switched 
on and the steady response when an AC voltage source is connected to the circuit. 
We also treat the energy in each circuit element. The energy stored or dissipated in 
each circuit element in the transient and steady states will be determined. 
8.1 
Each Circuit Element 
The resistor, DC voltage source, and DC current source were treated in the last 
chapter. There are other elements that compose electric circuits: These include capac-
itor to store electric charge, which we learned about in Chap. 2 and coil to store 
magnetic ﬂux, which were discussed in Chap. 5. AC voltage sources and AC current 
sources are also included. The fundamental properties of these elements are discussed 
in this chapter. Since a linear relationship holds between the voltage and current for 
each element, these are called linear circuit elements. This does not necessarily 
mean a proportional relationship, however. 
8.1.1

The current ﬂowing through depends on the circuit element that is connected to the

Fig. 8.5b.

The voltage across the connected circuit element depends on the element itself. There 
are DC current sources that provide a constant direct current and AC current sources 
that provide a sinusoidal current.

Electric Power and Energy in Circuit Elements 
We will derive the electric power and energy in each circuit element, except for power 
sources. 
8.2.1 
Resistor 
Suppose that we apply voltage up per V left parenthesis t right parenthesisacross a resistor with resistance upper R. The current 
ﬂowing through the resistor is upper I le ft parenthesis t right parenthesis equals upper V left parenthesis t right parenthesis divided by upper R, and the electric power, i.e., the electric 
energy, that goes into the resistor in unit time is given by 
upper P l eft parenthesis t right parenthesis equals upper V left parenthesis t right parenthesis upper I left parenthesis t right parenthesis equals upper R upper I squared left parenthesis t right parenthesis equals StartFraction upper V squared left parenthesis t right parenthesis Over upper R EndFraction period
up
p
er P left parenthesis t right parenthesis equals upper V left parenthesis t right parenthesis upper I left parenthesis t right parenthesis equals upper R upper I squared left parenthesis t right parenthesis equals StartFraction upper V squared left parenthesis t right parenthesis Over upper R EndFraction period
For example, in the case of DC voltage, a constant electric energy continues to pene-
trate the resistor, but the electric state does not change. So, this energy is dissipated. 
In fact, the energy changes to a Joule heat and the law of conservation of energy 
holds in a wide sense.

Suppose that we apply voltage up per V left parenthesis t right parenthesisacross a capacitor with capacitance upper C. The

which agrees with the electrostatic energy given by Eq. (2.42). If the variation stops 
when the voltage reaches upper V , the energy ﬂow into the capacitor stops, and the electric 
energy is stored in the capacitor. When the voltage across the capacitor is reduced to 
zero, the electric power is negative, the energy comes back to the power source, and 
the electric energy in the capacitor decreases to zero. Thus, the energy can be stored 
in the capacitor but is not dissipated. This is essentially different from the case of the 
resistor. 
8.2.3

Suppose that we apply current upper I left parenthesis t right parenthesisto a coil with inductance upper L. The electric power

which agrees with the magnetic energy given by Eq. (6.15). If the variation stops 
when the current reaches upper I, the energy ﬂow into the coil stops, and the electric 
energy is stored in the coil. When the current is reduced to zero, the electric power is 
negative, the energy comes back to the power source, and the electric energy in the

coil decreases to zero. Thus, the energy can be stored in the coil but is not dissipated, 
similarly to capacitors. 
8.3 
LRC Circuit 
Suppose a typical electric circuit in which a coil, resistor, and capacitor are connected 
in series, as shown in Fig. 8.7. The voltage drop due to each circuit element is given 
by Eqs. (8.8), (8.1), and (8.5), and the balance with the electromotive force of the 
voltage source is given by

The form of this equation is well known as a dynamic equation of motion for 
mechanical systems. Suppose the case in which a solid body of mass m connected 
to a spring with spring constant k is moving in a viscous medium of viscosity eta, as  
shown in Fig. 8.8. The equation of motion of this matter is given by 
m StartFraction d squared x Over d t squared EndFraction plus eta StartFraction d x Over d t EndFraction plus k x equals f comma

where f is an external force and x is the displacement of the mass from its equilibrium 
position. The ﬁrst term is the force needed for acceleration, the second term is the 
viscous force, and the third term is the spring force. If we use the velocity of the 
mass,

So, this equation has the same form as Eq. (8.17). Thus, it is effective for under-
standing various phenomena to know the property of this electric circuit. Here, we 
will investigate the behavior, especially the transient response and steady response, 
of the electric circuit. 
8.3.1

In the case of up per R equals 2 left parenthesis upper L divided by upper C right parenthesis Superscript 1 divided by 2, the denominator of uper K 1 and uper K 2 is zero, and the

Alternating Current Circuit 
Abstract In this chapter we learn about alternating current (AC) circuit theory, i.e., 
the theoretical method in which the common time-dependent factor is abbreviated, for 
the case of application of sinusoidal AC voltage or current. The impedance is deﬁned, 
which corresponds to the resistance in DC circuits, and we learn the relationship 
between the impedance and the energy for each circuit element. We treat various 
circuits composed of AC power source, resistor, capacitor, and coil, and learn the 
analysis method to determine the current. We also learn the characteristics of various 
types of ﬁlter from the frequency response. The advantage of using the complex 
electric power, which is composed of the effective electric power and reactive electric 
power, is introduced. 
9.1 
Sinusoidal Variation with Time 
The voltage or current commonly changes with time in electric circuits, as discussed 
in Chap. 8. It is well known that an arbitrary variation with time can be expressed as 
a sum of sinusoidal alternating functions as

This is called the Fourier series. Constants uper A Subscript n and uper B Subscript n can be determined as follows:

Hence, if we know the response to a sinusoidal AC voltage or current, any variation 
with time can be obtained by superimposing each response. Thus, understanding of 
the response to a sinusoidal variation is essential. For this reason, we treat here the 
cases in which the voltage or current varies sinusoidally with time.

This agrees with the result obtained in Sect. 8.3.2. Thus, the analysis clearly becomes 
easier by the use of complex notation. 
We use the real part of the complex notation to go back to the real phenomenon. It 
is also possible to use the imaginary part. The latter corresponds to the case in which 
the voltage of the source is given by up er E  Subscript m Baseline sine omega t. 
Since the complex notation holds when we analyze phenomena in AC circuits, it 
is possible to understand the phenomena directly from the complex notation without 
going back to the real part in each case. In addition, the common factor e Superscript i omega t can 
be eliminated. In fact, the relationship between the current and the voltage can be 
obtained without this time-dependent factor, as is seen in Eq. (9.10). The obtained 
relationship between the current and the voltage can be understood as the relationship 
for peak values or effective values. 
We treated the above example based on the condition that the initial phase of the 
voltage of the power source is zero. In the case of an electric circuit connected in 
series, the applied voltage is different for each element, while the current ﬂowing 
through each element is common. So, it is more convenient to analyze based on the 
current, and hereafter we follow this style.

Impedance 
When current upper I normal e Superscript normal i omega t ﬂows through a circuit element as shown in Fig. 9.3, the voltage 
on it is denoted by up per V normal e Superscript normal i omega t and the relation between them is expressed as 
up per  V
 equals upper Z upper I period
In this case upper Z is called the impedance. On the other hand, if the above relation is 
expressed as 
up per  I 
equals upper Y upper V comma
where upper Y is called the admittance.

upper R and upper X are similarly expressed using upper G and upper B (see Exercise 10.3). 
Thus, the reactance upper X has a positive or negative value: It is called the inductive 
reactance for up per X greater than 0, and the capacitive reactance for up per X less than 0.

Alternating Current Circuit 
We learned about circuits composed of resistors and DC power sources in Chap. 7. 
We can similarly analyze the response in alternating current (AC) circuits composed 
of coils, resistors, capacitors, and AC power sources. In this case resistances are 
merely changed to impedances. For example, assume the electric circuit shown in 
Fig. 9.9. The impedance of each circuit element is denoted by upper Z 1, upper Z 2, upper Z 3, and upper Z 4. 
If these are replaced by resistances upper R, upper R 2, upper R 3, and upper R 4, and an AC voltage source 
is replaced by a DC voltage source, this reduces to the resistor circuit shown in 
Fig. 7.14. So, we will repeat the corresponding analysis here.

Hence, the whole current is given by up pe r I equals upper E divided by upper Z. If we denote by uper I 1 and uper I 2 the 
current ﬂowing through the coil and resistor and that ﬂowing through the capacitor, 
respectively, as in the ﬁgure, we have up pe r I  equals upper I 1 plus upper I 2. Another condition is that the

Frequency Response 
There are many cases in which variation with time is not simply sinusoidal or not 
steady. Even in such cases, any variation with time can be realized by superim-
posing sinusoidal variations with different frequencies, as stated in Sect. 9.1. So, it 
is important to understand the difference in the response of AC circuits for different 
frequencies. We will treat the frequency response of various circuits in this section. 
We ﬁrst compare the frequency response of each circuit component. The 
impedance of the resistor is given by Eq. (9.16) and is unchanged when the angular 
frequency omegachanges. The impedance of the capacitor is given by Eq. (9.18) and its 
magnitude becomes small when omegaincreases. On the other hand, the impedance of 
the coil is given by Eq. (9.20) and its magnitude becomes large when omegaincreases. So, 
electric circuits composed of these components may have complicated dependencies 
on omega. 
Here, we treat the frequency response for the circuit composed of a coil, resistor, 
and capacitor, as shown in Fig. 9.13. The impedance of this circuit is

We suppose that the angular frequency becomes very small. In this case StartAbsoluteValue upper Z EndAbsoluteValueis 
approximately given by 1 divided by omega upper C, and the magnitude of the current is approximately 
given by 
Sta r tAbsol
uteValue upper I EndAbsoluteValue asymptotically equals omega upper C StartAbsoluteValue upper E EndAbsoluteValue period
Thus, it becomes very small and its phase is approximately equal to pi divided by 2. On the  
contrary, if omegabecomes very large, StartAbsoluteValue upper Z EndAbsoluteValueis approximately equal to omega upper L, the magnitude 
of the current is very small as 
Sta r tAbsoluteValue upper I EndAbsoluteValue asymptotically equals StartFraction StartAbsoluteValue upper E EndAbsoluteValue Over omega upper L EndFraction comma
Sta r
tAbsoluteValue upper I EndAbsoluteValue asymptotically equals StartFraction StartAbsoluteValue upper E EndAbsoluteValue Over omega upper L EndFraction comma
and its phase is approximately equal to negative pi divided by 2. In the middle area of omega, the current 
takes on a large value and its phase takes on a middle value. Most notably, the 
reactance is close to zero. The current takes on its maximum value, StartAbsoluteValue upper I EndAbsoluteValue equals StartAbsoluteValue upper E EndAbsoluteValue divided by upper R, 
and its phase is zero at

The angular frequency dependences of the magnitude and phase of the current are 
shown in Figs. 9.14 and 9.15, respectively. The sharpness of the resonance depends 
strongly on the value of upper Q Subscript f. uper Q Subscript f is called the quality factor, or  Q value.

1 divided by StartRoot 2 EndRoot of its peak value at omega e q uals omega 0 minus normal upper Delta omega. Since the

When omegais very small, the magnitude of the current is approximately constant and 
takes on a value of about StartAbsoluteValue upper E EndAbsoluteValue divided by upper R, and its phase is approximately zero. When omegais very

These dependencies on omegaare shown in Figs. 9.17 and 9.18. Although the total current 
is zero at omega equals omega 0, the electromotive force is fully applied to the coil and capacitance,

Thus, the right side is almost equal to 1 for o m ega much less than omega Subscript c. On the other hand, for o m ega much greater than omega Subscript c, 
the right side is almost given by left parenthesis omega Subscript c Baseline divided by omega right parenthesis squared and decreases with increasing omega. This  
angular frequency dependence is shown in Fig. 9.21. Such a circuit that passes only 
a signal of frequency lower than omega Subscript c and cuts that higher than omega Subscript c is called a low-pass 
ﬁlter and omega Subscript c is called the cut-off angular frequency. So, f S ubscript c Baseline equals omega Subscript c Baseline divided by 2 piis the cut-off 
frequency.
The reason why such a characteristic is obtained is that the voltage on the resistor 
becomes lower due to the increase in the impedance of the coil in addition to the 
shortage of resistance due to the decrease in the impedance of the capacitor at high 
angular frequencies. 
Next, we treat the electric circuit shown in Fig. 9.22. The impedance of the resistor

For o m ega much less than omega Subscript c, the right side is approximately equal to left parenthesis omega divided by omega Subscript c Baseline right parenthesis squared and becomes almost 
zero for small omega. For  o m ega much greater than omega Subscript c, the right side approaches 1. The obtained angular 
frequency dependence is shown in Fig. 9.23. Such a circuit that passes only a signal 
of angular frequency higher than the designated value and cuts a signal with a lower 
angular frequency is called a high-pass ﬁlter. omega Subscript c in this case is also called the cut-off 
angular frequency.

frequency characteristic of 
high-pass ﬁlter 
The reason why such a characteristic is obtained is that the voltage on the resistor 
becomes lower due to the increase in the impedance of the capacitor in addition to 
the shortage of resistance due to the decrease in the impedance of the coil at low 
angular frequencies.

Example 9.6 The circuit shown in Fig. 9.24 is a band-pass ﬁlter that passes only 
signals within a designated range of angular frequency. This circuit is designed so that 
the voltage on the resistor is lowered when the angular frequency is higher or lower. 
To realize this condition, it is necessary to adjust the capacitance of the capacitor.

Alternating Current Power 
When AC voltage is applied to a resistor, the electric power is given by Eq. (8.12), 
and the electric power is dissipated as discussed in Example 8.1. This is shown by 
the fact that the power is always positive and is continuously supplied by the power 
source, while the situation does not change. On the other hand, the electric power is 
not dissipated in capacitors or coils and goes back and forth between these elements 
and the power source, as shown in Sects. 8.2.2 and 8.2.3. 
This can be shown by the fact that the power takes on a positive or negative value 
depending on the situation. The applied voltage and ﬂowing current have the same 
directions in the phasor notation for the resistor. But those are perpendicular to each 
other for the coil and the capacitor, as shown in Figs. 9.5 and 9.6.

9.8 Alternating Current Power

It should be noted that the phasor natation cannot be used for the electric power, 
since its variation with time contains a sinusoidal term of angular frequency 2 omega. For  
this reason, it is necessary to treat practical variation with time for the electric power. 
When upper I is a phasor notation of the current that ﬂows through a load with the 
impedance and admittance given by Eqs. (9.27) and (9.28), respectively, the phasor

is called the reactive power, and the quantity common to both the effective and

When the voltage and current are upper V and upper I for a circuit or a load, it is convenient

Chapter 10 
Transformer Circuit 
Abstract In this chapter we learn about the characteristics of the transformer, which 
is one of circuit components. Transformers are classiﬁed into voltage transformers 
that change voltage and current transformers that change current, depending on the 
magnitude of the impedance of the load connected to the transformer. The function 
of a transformer that involves transforming the load impedance is also introduced. It 
is possible to represent a circuit with a transformer as an equivalent circuit without 
a transformer. We treat various phenomena of AC circuits with transformers. 
10.1 
Transformer 
A device used to change magnitudes of AC voltage or current is the transformer, 
the function of which was learned in Sect. 6.1. Suppose a transformer composed 
of two coils that are coupled magnetically, with the self-inductances of the primary 
and secondary coils denoted by uper L 1 and upper L 2, and the mutual inductance between them 
denoted by upper M, as shown in Fig. 10.1. When the voltages on these coils are uper V 1 and uper V 2
and the currents are uper I 1 and upper I 2, the relations between these quantities are described 
by 
Sta rtLayout 1 st Ro w 1s

d Column equals i omega upper L 1 upper I 1 plus i omega upper M upper I 2 comma 2nd Row 1st Column upper V 2 2nd Column equals i omega upper M upper I 1 plus i omega upper L 2 upper I 2 comma EndLayout
where resistance is disregarded. These equations are rewritten as 
Sta rtLayout  1st Ro w 1st Col umn upp
er V 1 2nd C olumn equals i  omega 
left parenthesis upper L 1 minus upper M right parenthesis upper I 1 plus i omega upper M left parenthesis upper I 1 plus upper I 2 right parenthesis comma 2nd Row 1st Column upper V 2 2nd Column equals i omega upper M left parenthesis upper I 1 plus upper I 2 right parenthesis plus i omega left parenthesis upper L 2 minus upper M right parenthesis upper I 2 period EndLayout
These conditions can be realized by a circuit without the transformer, as shown in 
Fig. 10.2. So, the circuits shown in Figs. 10.1 and 10.2 are equivalent to each other.

As discussed in Chap. 6, the self-inductances uper L 1 and uper L 2 are deﬁned to be positive, 
i.e., when the directions of the currents are deﬁned, the directions of the magnetic 
ﬂux are designated. On the other hand, the mutual inductance takes on a positive or 
negative value. There is a relation among these inductances given by 
up er M sq
uared less than or equals upper L 1 upper L 2 period
If we write this as 
up per M equals k
 left parenthesis upper L 1 upper L 2 right parenthesis Superscript 1 divided by 2 Baseline comma
StartAbsoluteValue k EndAbsoluteValueis called a coupling coefﬁcient, which satisﬁes StartAbsoluteValue k EndAbsoluteValue less than or equals 1. The coupling in the case 
of StartAbsoluteValue k EndAbsoluteValue equals 1 is called tight coupling. 
Suppose that a load of impedance uper Z 2 is connected to the secondary winding, as 
shown in Fig. 10.3. In this case, the condition,

equals minus upper Z 2 upper I 2
is added. Then, elimination of uper V 2 from the second equation of Eq. (10.1) yields 
up e r

The impedance viewed from the primary coil, i.e., the input impedance, is given by 
up er Z 1 equals StartFraction upper V 1 Over upper I 1 EndFraction equals normal i omega upper L 1 plus StartFraction omega squared upper M squared Over normal i omega upper L 2 plus upper Z 2 EndFraction identical to normal i omega upper L 1 plus upper Z comma

equals Start
Fraction upper V 1 Over upper I 1 EndFraction equals normal i omega upper L 1 plus StartFraction omega squared upper M squared Over normal i omega upper L 2 plus upper Z 2 EndFraction identical to normal i omega upper L 1 plus upper Z comma
and the corresponding equivalent circuit is shown in Fig. 10.4. So, the impedance is 
changed from uper Z 2 to uper Z 1 by inserting a transformer. Thus, the transformer has another 
function, to transform impedance.
Suppose that StartAbsoluteValue upper Z 2 EndAbsoluteValueis very large. Then, we have up er V 1 equals normal i omega upper L 1 upper I 1 from Eq. (10.7) and 
up er V 2 equals normal i omega upper M upper I 1 from Eqs. (10.5) and (10.6). Thus, we obtain 
up er  V 2 equals StartFraction upper M Over upper L 1 EndFraction upper V 1 period
up
er 
V 2 equals StartFraction upper M Over upper L 1 EndFraction upper V 1 period
Such a transformer used to change the voltage on a load is called a voltage trans-
former. On the other hand, if StartAbsoluteValue upper Z 2 EndAbsoluteValueis much smaller than omega upper L 2, Eq.  (10.6) leads 
to 
up e r  I 2 equals minus StartFraction upper M Over upper L 2 EndFraction upper I 1 period

Fig. 10.4 Equivalent circuit 
of Fig. 10.3. upper Z is deﬁned in 
Eq. (10.8)
Such a transformer used to change the current ﬂowing through a load is called a 
current transformer. 
Here, we estimate the energy stored in the transformer in Fig. 10.1 when the 
currents uper I 1 and uper I 2 are applied to the primary and secondary circuits, respectively. 
To make current u p
per I prime 1 ﬂow through the primary circuit against the electromotive force 
opposing it, it is necessary to apply an additional voltage u p
pe r V pr i
me 1 equals upper L 1 normal d upper I prime 1 divided by normal d t. The power 
supplied by the power source is u p
per  
V prime 1 upper I prime 1. Hence, the stored energy in the primary circuit 
when current uper I 1 is applied is

Then, we apply current uper I 2 to the secondary circuit. The energy supplied by the power 
source in the secondary circuit is similarly given by 
uppe r U Subscript normal m Baseline 2 Baseline equals one half upper L 2 upper I 2 squared period

cript normal m Baseline 2 Baseline equals one half upper L 2 upper I 2 squared period
In the meantime, the electromotive force, minu s

which works to change the primary current. So, the power source in the primary 
circuit must supply additional energy by

to keep the current uper I 1 ﬂowing in the primary circuit. In the meantime, since the current 
in the primary circuit does not change, the electromotive force does not appear in 
the secondary circuit. As a result, the total stored energy is given by

Chapter 11 
Theorems for Electric Circuits 
Abstract In this chapter we learn about various theorems for electric circuits for a 
greater understanding of the solution methods we have used. First, we learn Kirch-
hoff’s law for the DC resistor circuit, and the branch current method, the closed 
current method, and the node potential method, which are used to determine ﬂowing 
currents, are introduced. These methods can be extended to AC circuits. The principle 
of superposition, Thévenin’s theorem, and Norton’s theorem are also introduced, and 
the uses of these theorems are shown for various examples. 
11.1 
Kirchhoff’s Law 
Many problems have been solved for various DC and AC circuits. In this chapter, 
such solution methods are reviewed using fundamental analytic methods, and some 
theorems are introduced. These provide the basis for the solution methods that we 
have already used, and are useful to solve complicated problems. 
Fundamental features of electric circuits are described by Kirchhoff’s law. Here, 
we deﬁne the terms used in the law, before we go into details about the law. There are 
points at which currents pass through an electric circuit composed of power sources 
and circuit elements, and such points are called nodes. There is a passage for currents 
between adjacent two nodes, and these passages are called branches. An example 
is shown in Fig. 11.1. We can deﬁne a path which starts at a node, passes through 
each node and branch once, and goes back to the starting node. Such a path is called 
a closed path. The current that ﬂows through each branch is a branch current, and 
the electric potential difference between two adjacent nodes is a branch voltage.
Kirchhoff’s law consists of two laws, and the ﬁrst law states as follows: 
(a) The algebraic sum of currents entering or exiting an arbitrary node is zero. 
Here, a current that passes out is counted as positive. That is, if we denote the 
current passing out of the node through the i-th branch by uper I Subsc r i p t  i Baseline left parenthesis i equals 1 comma 2 comma ellipsis comma n right parenthesis, 
as illustrated in Fig. 11.2, we have

This holds also for AC currents, and is derived by applying Eq. (3.5) to a closed 
surface that includes a corresponding node. The second law is stated for DC electric 
circuits as follows: 
(b) The algebraic sum of branch voltages is zero in an arbitrary closed path 
composed of branches in an electrical network. Hence, the sum of electromotive 
forces is equal to the sum of voltage drops. If we denote by uper E Subscript i Baseline left parenthesis i equals 1 comma 2 commae l l i psis comma m right parenthesis

This can be derived by application of Eq. (3.18) to the indicated closed path. In 
power sources the direction of the electric ﬁeld is opposite to that of the current. The 
extension of the second law to AC circuits will be mentioned later.

Circuit Equation 
In the former sections we used the currents ﬂowing in each branch. These branch 
currents can be expressed by superimposing currents ﬂowing in closed paths. Suppose 
that an electric circuit is composed of 4 nodes and 6 branches, as shown in Fig. 11.4a. 
There are six branch currents, but these are expressed by superposition of three closed 
currents, upper I 1, upper I 2, and upper I 3. Namely,

Theorems for Electric Circuits
This results from the fact that all the branch currents are not independent of the others 
due to the relation given by Eq. (11.1). For example, when upper I 12 and upper I 14 are given, upper I 13
is determined, and if upper I 34 is given, the remaining upper I 23 and upper I 24 are determined. When the 
numbers of nodes and branches are n and b, respectively, there are n node equations. 
Since when all the node equations are summed, the sum is reduces to zero. So, the 
number of independent node equations is n minus 1. The number of independent branch 
currents is reduced by this number of independent node equations and is given by 
b minu s n plus 1. We have  n equals 4 and b equals 6 for the circuit shown in Fig. 11.4a, and the 
number of independent branch currents is 3. This is the reason why we can express 
all the branch currents with a smaller number of closed currents. So, it is in general 
easier to use closed currents as unknown variables. The choice of independent closed 
currents is not unique and we can use u p
per I prime 3 instead of upper I 3, as shown in Fig. 11.4b. It is 
required that all the branches must be passed by some currents and that all the closed 
currents must be independent of the others. 
From the above points, we have the branch current method and the closed 
current method for describing circuit equations. Another method is the node poten-
tial method in which the node potentials are used as independent variables. In the 
following sections, these methods are introduced. 
11.2.1 
Branch Current Method 
Here, we determine the currents using the branch current method for the circuit shown 
in Fig. 11.5. Since the number of nodes is 2, the number of independent Eqs. (11.1) 
is 1. So, if we denote the branch currents as shown in the ﬁgure, the equation on node 
A is given by 
Fig. 11.5 DC circuit

The equation on node B is the same one with different signs. In the case of the closed 
paths for Eq. (11.2), the number of independent closed paths is 2, and we use ABC 
and ABD. Equation (11.2) for  ABC is  
up er E 1 e quals up

and that for ABD is 
up er E 2 e quals up

Eliminating uper I 3 by using Eq. (11.4), Eqs. (11.5) and (11.6) lead, respectively, to

The electric circuit in Fig. 7.22 contains 4 nodes and 6 branches. Hence, the 
numbers of independent currents and closed paths are 3, and the problem can be 
solved using three currents, upper I 1, upper I 3, and upper I. Equations (7.25), (7.26), and (7.17) describe 
the second law for a closed path including the power source and ABC, including the 
power source and ACD, and including ABC, respectively.

Thus, in the case where the current source is included, the current is directly given, 
while Eq. (11.2) cannot be used, since the electromotive force of the current source 
changes depending on surrounding resistances. Kirchhoff’s second law holds as a 
result, however. 
11.2.2 
Closed Current Method 
Here, we introduce the solution method with closed currents. Since the paths of closed 
currents are closed, the conservation law of current, Eq. (11.1), holds automatically, 
even when superimposing them. We denote the closed currents as shown in Fig. 11.8 
for the circuit shown in Fig. 11.5. Then, along the path for closed current upper I Subscript normal upper A, the  
second law is described as

Similarly, we have

11.2.3 
Node Potential Method 
It is also possible to solve problems by using electric potentials at each node instead 
of branch currents or closed currents. In this case, Eq. (1.17) holds for a closed loop, 
and it is not necessary to use the second law. Each branch current is determined by 
the electric potentials on both sides, the electromotive force of the voltage source, 
and the resistance in the corresponding branch. 
Suppose the circuit shown in Fig. 11.5. We denote the electric potential at node 
A by  upper V , setting the electric potential at node B to be 0. Then, currents upper I 1, upper I 2, and uper I 3
are given by left  par enthesis upper E 1 minus upper V right parenthesis divided by upper R 1, left  par enthesis upper E 2 minus upper V right parenthesis divided by upper R 2, and upper V divided by upper R 3, respectively. Hence, Eq. (11.4) 
leads to

Then, the currents in Eq. (11.9) are determined. The equation describing the relation 
on currents, such as Eq. (11.17), is called a nodal equation.

Fig. 11.10 DC circuit 
In the case where the number of nodes is n, there are n minus 1 independent node 
potentials. So, these unknown variables can be solved by using n minus 1 nodal equations. 
If the power source is a current source, the branch current is given by the current of 
the current source, independently of the potential difference between the two nodes. 
If there is a voltage source only in a branch, as shown in Fig. 11.10, the potential 
difference between the two nodes is determined by the electromotive force of the 
voltage source, but the branch current is not simply determined. This is because 
there is no voltage drop due to the branch current. That is, even if we describe the 
second law for a closed path including the voltage source with upper E 1, branch current 
uper I 1 does not appear in it. The value of this current is determined by the values of 
the resistances around it. Here, we show the concrete solution method. You should 
solve this problem with both the branch current and the closed current methods (see 
Exercises 11.4 and 11.5). We set the electric potential at node B to zero. Then, the 
electric potential at node A is upper E 1. Then, currents uper I 2 and uper I 3 are determined to be 
up er I 2  equals left parenthesis upper E 2 minus upper E 1 right parenthesis divided by upper R 2 and up er I 3 equals upper E 1 divided by upper R 3, respectively. So, the current uper I 1 is determined

Extension to AC Circuit 
We have learned the characteristics of AC circuits in Chaps. 8–10. Here, we properly 
extend Kirchhoff’s law used in DC circuits to AC circuits. 
Since the conservation law for currents holds also for AC, the ﬁrst law, Eq. (11.1), 
still holds. On the other hand, the electrostatic potential cannot be used because of 
electromagnetic induction. That is, since Eq. (1.17) is not satisﬁed, the second law 
does not hold. For example, in the circuit shown in Fig. 11.12, the electrostatic ﬁeld 
integrated along the left closed path leads to

From a theoretical viewpoint, since the third and fourth terms are electromotive 
forces, these terms should be moved to the left side. But these terms are regarded 
as potential drops caused by the power source to maintain current upper I 1 left parenthesis t right parenthesisagainst the 
electromagnetic induction. Thus, we obtain an equation of the same form as the 
second law by rewriting the induced electromotive forces as potential drops. In this 
case, the equation for the right closed path in Fig. 11.12 is similarly written as

11.4 
Principle of Superposition 
The systems that we have treated are linear ones: In these systems, if the electromotive 
force of the voltage source is doubled, the current is also doubled. Hence, if there are 
some voltage sources in a circuit, the total current is given by the sum (superposition) 
of the current given by each voltage source. The same thing can be said for current 
sources. Thus, the following law holds [1]. 
Suppose 
that 
voltage 
sources,
upper E  1  c omma upper E 2 comma ellipsis comma upper E Subscript m Baseline, 
and 
current 
sources, 
upper J Sub s c r i pt m plus 1 Baseline comma upper J Subscript m plus 2 Baseline comma ellipsis comma upper J Subscript m plus n Baseline, are included in a circuit. The branch voltage uper V Subscript i and 
branch current uper I Subscript i in the i-th branch are respectively given by the sum of up p er V Subscript i j and up p er I Subscript i j
with respect to j, where up p er V Subscript i j and up p er I Subscript i j are the values of the branch voltage and current 
when the effects of power sources except for the j-th source are eliminated. That is,

sigma summation Underscript j equals 1 Overscript m plus n Endscripts upper V Subscript i j Baseline comma upper I Subscript i Baseline equals sigma summation Underscript j equals 1 Overscript m plus n Endscripts upper I Subscript i j Baseline period
In the above, the elimination of the effect of power sources means assuming short 
circuit for voltage sources and removal of current sources, leaving an opening in 
their place, to make the electromotive force and the current zero. This law is called 
the principle of superposition. 
Here, we show that this law holds for the circuit shown in Fig. 11.5. The circuit in 
which voltage source uper E 1 remains and voltage source uper E 2 is short-circuited is shown 
in Fig. 11.14a, and the circuit in which voltage source uper E 2 remains and voltage source 
uper E 1 is short-circuited is shown in Fig. 11.14b. Each branch current in Fig. 11.14a is  
easily solved as 
Fig. 11.14 a DC circuit in which voltage source uper E 2 is short-circuited and b DC circuit in which 
voltage source uper E 1 is short-circuited

Thévenin’s Theorem 
Suppose that electric circuit N0 shown in Fig. 1.16a contains power sources inside 
it and that the voltage between the terminals a and b is upper V 0. When the effects of the
Fig. 11.16 a Circuit N0 with power sources, b condition in which the effects of internal power 
sources are eliminated, and c condition in which circuit N of impedance upper Z without internal power 
sources is connected

230

Theorems for Electric Circuits
internal power sources are eliminated by short-circuiting the voltage sources and by 
removal of the current sources with opening as shown in Fig. 11.16b, the impedance 
between the terminals a and b is assumed to be upper Z 0. When electric circuit N of 
impedance upper Z that does not contain power sources is connected to the terminals a and 
b as shown in Fig. 11.16c, the current that ﬂows from the terminal a to the circuit N 
is given by
up p
er I equals StartFraction upper V 0 Over upper Z 0 plus upper Z EndFraction period
up er I  
equals StartFraction upper V 0 Over upper Z 0 plus upper Z EndFraction period
This is called Thévenin’s theorem [1]. 
This theorem is proved here. The electric circuit shown in Fig. 11.16c is the  same  
as the circuit with insertion of two voltage sources of electromotive force uper V 0 with 
opposite directions, as shown in Fig. 11.17. The principle of superposition proves 
that this circuit is equal to the superposition of the two electric circuits shown in 
Fig. 11.18a and b. All power sources in circuit N0 are active in Fig. 11.18a, and 
all power sources in circuit N0 are killed in Fig. 11.18b. Since the voltage between 
terminals a and b is zero in the circuit in Fig. 11.18a, the current u pper I prime that ﬂows from 
terminal a into circuit N is zero. On the other hand, the left side of terminals a and b 
is just an impedance uper Z 0 in Fig. 11.18b. So, the current u pper I double prime that ﬂows from terminal a 
into circuit N is given by upper V 0 divided by left parenthesis upper Z 0 plus upper Z right parenthesis. Then, we have up per  I  equals upper I prime plus upper I double prime from superposition 
[1]. Thus, Eq. (11.33) is proved. 
Thévenin’s theorem shows that any circuit can be regarded as a power source 
with an electromotive force and an internal impedance, if we look inside from two 
arbitrary terminals. Figure 11.19a shows its equivalent circuit, and Fig. 11.19b is  
another expression with a current source.

Here, we determine current uper I 3 ﬂowing through uper R 3 in the circuit shown in

Norton’s theorem forms a pair with Thévenin’s theorem. It is stated as follows: 
Suppose a circuit N0 with power sources, as shown in Fig. 11.22a. We denote by uper I 0
the current when the terminals a and b are short-circuited, and by uper Y 0 the admittance 
between these terminals when the effects of internal power sources are eliminated, 
as shown in Fig. 11.22b. When circuit N of admittance upper Y that does not contain power 
sources is connected to these terminals, as shown in Fig. 11.22c, the voltage between 
these terminals is given by 
up p
er V equals StartFraction upper I 0 Over upper Y 0 plus upper Y EndFraction period
up er V  
equals StartFraction upper I 0 Over upper Y 0 plus upper Y EndFraction period
This theorem is now proved. The circuit shown in Fig. 11.22c is the same as the 
circuit with insertion of two current sources each generating current uper I 0 with opposite 
directions, as shown in Fig. 11.23. The principle of superposition proves that this 
circuit is equal to two superposed electric circuits, as shown in Fig. 11.24a and b. 
All power sources in circuit N0 are active in Fig. 11.24a, and all power sources in

circuit N0 are eliminated in Fig. 11.24b. The voltage u pper V prime between terminals a and b 
is zero in Fig. 11.24a. On the other hand, the left side of terminals a and b is just an 
admittance uper Y 0 in Fig. 11.24b. So, the voltage u pper V double prime between terminals a and b is given 
by upper I  0 divided by left parenthesis upper Y 0 plus upper Y right parenthesis. Then, we have up per  V e quals upper V prime plus upper V double prime from superposition. Thus, Eq. (11.37) 
is proved.
The Hoashi-Millman theorem is an extension of Norton’s theorem. It is stated

is called the gradient of f . In the above, b old italic i Subscript x, bo ld italic i Subscript y, and b old italic i Subscript z are unit vectors along the x-, y-, 
and z-axes, respectively. Thus, grad is an operator that operates on a scalar to result 
in a vector. grad f points in the direction of maximum variation with a magnitude 
equal to the maximum variation. For example, when temperature upper T varies in space 
and kappais a heat conductivity, negativ e kappa grad upper T gives a heat that ﬂows across a unit area in 
unit time.

Differential Forms of Laws on Electromagnetism 
A.2.1 
Electrostatic Field 
Since the electrostatic ﬁeld satisﬁes Eq. (1.17), it can be expresses by a gradient of 
some scalar function, as shown by Eq. (A.26). In fact, it is given by Eq. (1.21) with 
the electric potential phi. That is, 
bo l d ital ic
 upper E equals minus grad phi period
Thus, from Eq. (A.13) the electrostatic ﬁeld satisﬁes 
curl bo ld i
talic upper E equals 0 period
This shows that the electrostatic ﬁeld is a ﬁeld without vortex.

Eq. (1.25), it leads to

This is Gauss’s divergences law. That is, when there are electric charges, those 
produce divergences of electric ﬁeld and electric ﬂux density.

and apply Gauss’s theorem on the right side. Then, this equation leads to

In the case of steady current in which the electric charge density does not change 
with time, Eq. (A.36) leads to 
div bo ld i
talic i equals 0 period

This vector, bold italic upper A, is called the vector potential.

2.3 We denote by uper Q Subscript x the electric charge on the right surface of the left conductor. 
Then, the electric charge on the left surface of this conductor is up per Q minus upper Q Subscript x. Thus, 
the total electric charge in the right side of this conductor including the right 
conductor is up er Q Subscript x Baseline plus 2 upper Q. These electric charges must be equal to each other so 
that the electric ﬁeld does not penetrate the left conductor. Thus, we have 
up e r  Q Subscript x Baseline equals minus StartFraction upper Q Over 2 EndFraction period
up per Q Subscript x Baseline equals minus StartFraction upper Q Over 2 EndFraction period
Then, the electric charge on the left surface of this conductor is 3 upper Q divided by 2. We  
denote by uper Q Subscript y the electric charge on the left surface of the right conductor. 
Then, from the similar condition, up per Q  plus  upper Q Subscript y Baseline equals 2 upper Q minus upper Q Subscript y, we have  up er Q Subscript y Baseline equals upper Q divided by 2, 
and the electric charge on the left surface of this conductor is 3 upper Q divided by 2. As a  
result, the electric charges are 3 upper Q divided by 2, negative upper Q divided by 2, upper Q divided by 2, and 3 uper Q divided by 2 from the left to 
right surfaces. If Gauss’s law is used to determine the electric charge, we need 
a value of electric ﬁeld strength in some vacuum region.

2.10 Suppose that the voltage between the two electrodes is upper V , when the dielectric 
plate is inserted by distance x from the edge. In this case, the electric ﬁeld 
strength is up pe r E equals upper V divided by d in both of vacuum and dielectric plate. Hence, the 
electric ﬂux density is up e r D 0 equals epsilon 0 upper V divided by d and up p er D equals epsilon upper V divided by d in the respective regions. 
Since the density of electric charge that appears on the electrode surface facing 
vacuum and the dielectric material is sig ma 0 equals upper D 0 and si gma equals upper D, respectively, the 
total electric charge is given by 
up per Q eq uals left bra cket sig ma 0 l eft parenthesis a minus x right parenthesis plus sigma x right bracket b equals StartFraction left bracket epsilon 0 left parenthesis a minus x right parenthesis plus epsilon x right bracket b upper V Over d EndFraction period
up

Thus, upper V is determined by this condition. Hence, using upper Q, the electrostatic 
energy is written as 
up er U Subscript e Baseline equals one half upper Q upper V equals StartFraction d upper Q squared Over 2 b left bracket epsilon 0 a plus left parenthesis epsilon minus epsilon 0 right parenthesis x right bracket EndFraction period

upper U  Sub s cript e Baseline equals one half upper Q upper V equals StartFraction d upper Q squared Over 2 b left bracket epsilon 0 a plus left parenthesis epsilon minus epsilon 0 right parenthesis x right bracket EndFraction period
Note that upper V changes with x. The force on the dielectric plate is determined to 
be

Since e p silon greater than epsilon 0, we have  up pe r F greater than 0. This is directed to the increasing x, so the  
attractive force works.

5.1 Current upper I ﬂows uniformly on the surface at r equals a of the inner superconductor 
so that magnetic ﬂux does not penetrate it. Then, current negative upper I ﬂows uniformly 
on the inner surface at r equals b of the outer superconductor so that magnetic 
ﬂux does not penetrate it. Since the total current is zero in the outer supercon-
ductor, current upper I ﬂows uniformly on the outer surface at r equals c of the outer 
superconductor. Under this current distribution, the magnetic ﬂux density in

5.2 We denote by uper I Subscript x the current on the right surface of the left superconductor. 
Then, the current on the left surface of this superconductor is up per I minus upper I Subscript x. Thus, 
the total current in the right side of this superconductor including the right 
superconductor is up er I Subscript x Baseline plus 2 upper I. These currents must be equal to each other so that 
the magnetic ﬂux does not penetrate the left superconductor. Thus, we have

Then, the current on the left surface of this superconductor is 3 upper I divided by 2. We denote 
by uper I Subscript y the current on the left surface of the right superconductor. Then, from 
the similar condition, up per I  plus  upper I Subscript y Baseline equals 2 upper I minus upper I Subscript y, we have  up er I Subscript y Baseline equals upper I divided by 2, and the current 
on the left surface of this superconductor is 3 upper I divided by 2. As a result, the currents are 
3 upper I divided by 2, negative upper I divided by 2, upper I divided by 2, and 3 upper I divided by 2 from the left to right surfaces. If Ampere’s law 
is used to determine the current, we need a value of magnetic ﬂux density in 
some vacuum region.

7.5 From the symmetry, the resistance is equal to that shown in Fig. B.8. Thus, 
the combined resistance is left parenthesis 13 divided by 7 right parenthesis upper R. 
7.6 We deﬁne currents uper I 1 – upper I 6, as shown in Fig. B.9. The total current is 2 upper I 1, and the 
combined resistance is determined, if the potential difference between the two 
terminals can be obtained as a function of upper I 1. Since uper I 4 is equal to upper I 5, we have  
up er I 2 equals 2 upper I 4. From the symmetry, there is no current that ﬂows between the upper 
and lower halves of the circuit. So, uper I 3 is equal to upper I 6. As a result, the potential

Suppose that a voltage is applied between A and B. Since the current ﬂowing 
AO and that ﬂowing OB are the same, the situation does not change even if 
we disconnect the upper and lower parts at O. Hence, three resistors of upper R, 2 upper R, 
and left parenthesis 8 divided by 3 right parenthesis upper R are connected in series, and the resistance between A and B is 
left parenthesis 8 divided by 15 right parenthesis upper R. 
Suppose that a voltage is applied between A and C. Since current does not 
ﬂow between O and B, the situation does not change even if we disconnect 
O and B. We can also disconnect O and D for the same reason. Then, three 
resistors of 2 upper R are connected in parallel, and the resistance between A and C 
is left parenthesis 2 divided by 3 right parenthesis upper R. 
Suppose that a voltage is applied between O and A. Since points B and 
D are equipotential, the situation does not change even if we connect these 
points. Then, the resistors of left parenthesis 1 divided by 2 right parenthesis upper R and left parenthesis 3 divided by 2 right parenthesis upper R are connected in parallel 
between O and D. Since the resistance between O and A through D is left parenthesis 7 divided by 8 right parenthesis upper R, 
the resistance between O and A is left parenthesis 7 divided by 15 right parenthesis upper R. 
7.8 We denote by upper R prime the resistance on the right side of the broken line, as shown in 
Fig. B.10a. Then, the total resistance can be obtained, as shown in Fig. B.10b.

From the condition partial differential upper P divided by partial differential upper R equals 0, we have  9 omeg a squa red upper L squared minus 4 upper R squared equals 0, which leads to 
up per R equals three halves omega upper L period
upper R equals three halves omega upper L period
Since the second derivative of upper P with respect to upper R is negative, the dissipated 
power is at a maximum. Hence, the above condition for upper R is the solution.

11.11 The open-circuited voltage due to the voltage source is a uppe r E divided by left parenthesis 1 plus a right parenthesisand that 
due to the current source is a upper R upper J divided by left parenthesis 1 plus a right parenthesisin Fig. 11.32a. So, superposing 
these, the open-circuited voltage is given by a le ft parenth esis upper E plus upper R upper J right parenthesis divided by left parenthesis 1 plus a right parenthesis. Comparing 
this with the equivalent circuit in Fig. 11.32b, the following must be satisﬁed: 
Star tFraction a left parenthesis upper E plus upper R upper J right parenthesis Over 1 plus a EndFraction equals upper E period
St artF
raction a left parenthesis upper E plus upper R upper J right parenthesis Over 1 plus a EndFraction equals upper E period
When the voltage source is short-circuited and the current source is removed 
and opened, the resistance between the terminals is a uppe r R divided by left parenthesis 1 plus a right parenthesis. This must 
be equal to 2 upper R divided by 3. Thus, we have a equals 2. Then, from the above equation we 
have up per J equals upper E divided by left parenthesis 2 upper R right parenthesis. 
11.12 When the terminals a and b are short-circuited in Fig. 11.25, the current is 
given by the sum of currents up er Y Subscript i Baseline upper E Subscript i from each power source, as shown by the 
principle of superposition:

Thus, when the terminals a and b are opened (up per Y equals 0), the voltage between 
the terminals is obtained from Eqs. (11.37), and (11.38) is derived.
