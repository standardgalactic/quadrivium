Author’s Acknowledgments
Even as I sit alone at my desk writing about dogs, I am always aware
of the many people so integral to the process. Thank you to all those
who helped me with this book in so many ways: Tracy Boggier,
Acquisitions Editor, who knew I would love to write about Shih Tzu;
Chad Sievers, Project Editor, and Carrie Burchfield, Copy Editor, for
their bang-up editing jobs; Victor Joris, Technical Editor, Shih Tzu
expert extraordinaire, and a real force in the breed, for his thorough
review of the manuscript; Dominique DeVito, for cheering me on and
helping to keep me on task; and Caroline Coile, for keeping me just
distracted and amused enough to make the days interesting (and for
doing the same thing at the same time).
I also must thank Susan Chaney, Hazel Barrowman, Annie Shirreffs,
Jackie Franza, Annamaria DiGiorgio, Carol Boker, Lisa King, Betty
Liddick, and Tanya Bielski-Braham for giving me years and years 
of work that I consider my training ground for knowing all I know
about dogs. Thanks to the Dog Writer’s Association of America for
keeping me tapped into the strange and wonderful community of
people who write about dogs as a career. And finally, as always, to
Ben for his great support of the work I do.

Introduction
T
he world is full of dogs — big and small, short-coated and long,
all of them with the potential to be devoted companions. When
it comes to the Shih Tzu, even big-dog-lovers tend to admit after
they meet one that Shih Tzu are hard to resist. That loving adora-
tion, that sweet face, that gorgeous coat — few dogs compare to the
Shih Tzu for pure and total commitment to the role of companion.
A Shih Tzu wants to please you, but he has his own personality, too.
He loves the good life, and though he can be shrewd, or selectively
deaf, or consciously naïve, Shih Tzu are big-hearted and have a cer-
tain Zen-like tranquility. They don’t bark much. They don’t get too
hyper. They won’t pester you all day to throw a tennis ball or go for
a walk. But a Shih Tzu will stick by your side, serving as your com-
panion through good days and bad. This dog specializes in you.
But be warned: Despite his wonderful qualities, the Shih Tzu can be
challenging for individuals who aren’t fully committed to a vigorous
grooming regimen, who aren’t home very much, or who don’t have
the space in their heart to nurture, love, and care for a dog who
must be allowed to do his job as close personal companion to you.
If you’re reading this book, you may have already decided on a Shih
Tzu. If so, I provide you with all the info you need to start your life
together. If you’re still choosing a breed, you get the tools to make a
sound decision. And if you’ve lived with a Shih Tzu for awhile now, I
imagine you’re already hopelessly in love. If your Shih Tzu is a true
example of the breed, I can assure you the feeling is mutual.
About This Book
Because this book is about a particular dog breed, it has some spe-
cial characteristics that distinguish it from some of the other For
Dummies titles. This book is a tad smaller and more portable than
larger For Dummies’ guides. But it’s just as comprehensive; you can
find just about any Shih Tzu-related info you need in it.
Each section relates to different aspects of choosing and living suc-
cessfully with a Shih Tzu. This book is unique because you can open
it anywhere and just start reading. Find the topics that interest you
or apply to your situation right now. You can find answers to ques-
tions such as

 What’s a Shih Tzu really like?
 Is a Shih Tzu the right breed for me and my situation?
 Can I get a Shih Tzu if I have children or other pets?
 How difficult is grooming a Shih Tzu? Can I do it myself or
should I hire a professional?
 How do I find a good breeder? What about a good vet?
 What should my Shih Tzu eat? How do I keep her healthy?
 Do small dogs really need that much training?
Conventions Used in This Book
I use the following conventions throughout the text to make things
consistent and easy to understand:
 All Web addresses appear in monofont. Note: Some Web
addresses may extend to two lines of text. If you use one of
these addresses, just type the address exactly as you see it,
pretending that the line break doesn’t exist.
 New terms appear in italic and are closely followed by an
easy-to-understand definition.
 Bold text highlights important terminology and the action
parts of numbered steps.
Also, writers used to be told to call pets it, but to me, no Shih Tzu
is an it, so I loosely alternate between he and she when talking
about Shih Tzu. And just for fun, I’ve also invented two imaginary
Shih Tzu named Samson and Lola.
What You’re Not to Read
Throughout the book you see gray text boxes. These boxes are side-
bars that contain extra info. If you skip over them, you won’t hurt
my feelings, and you won’t miss anything crucial, but if you want to
read them, that’s okay, too. Of course, you don’t have to read the
copyright page or my acknowledgements of helpful people.
Foolish Assumptions

e stares at you longingly, his big dark eyes glistening with
love. She gazes at you, the god of her universe, and then
shakes her long golden hair. Irresistible, coy, and flirtatious, yet
passionately devoted to you . . . is this the love of your life?
Maybe a fluffy, cuddly, sweet-faced Shih Tzu would make the per-
fect dog for you. Maybe, just maybe, Samson really is the pet
you’ve always dreamed of. Maybe spunky little Lola really is your
canine match made in heaven. Or, maybe the little lion dog really
isn’t suited to be your next great love, because you aren’t crazy
about grooming or need a high-energy dog to go running with.
Whether you’re still deciding on the right breed or you just want to
know more about the little fella on your lap, this chapter serves as
your broad survey of this most adorable of the toy breeds. Consider
this chapter your crash course in Shih Tzu — Shih Tzu 101.
The Lowdown on the Shih Tzu
You don’t have to bend over much to pet a Labrador Retriever on
the head, but with a Shih Tzu (pronounced sheed-zoo, see Figure
1-1), you need to get down on the floor to pet him. His short legs
don’t get him much higher than about ten inches, so to admire all
his wonderful features, you have to take yourself to his level.

Figure 1-1: A Shih Tzu is a small dog with a big heart.
The show-dog Shih Tzu has specific features (refer to Chapter 2),
but show dog or not, all Shih Tzu have basic physical and person-
ality traits in common, and the most noticeable trait is weight. Shih
Tzu are heavier than they look and not as delicate as some finer-
boned toy breeds. But despite the heft, Shih Tzu are perfectly sized
for a lap or a handbag — not for hunting or tracking, pulling a sled,
treeing a raccoon, or guarding a farm. Shih Tzu don’t herd sheep or
win races, and they certainly don’t swim. Shih Tzu just don’t have
the body or the attitude for work, and although they can scare off a
mouse in the house, chances are, they won’t bother.
The Shih Tzu is built for one job and one job alone: to accompany
you on your journey through life as your close personal friend. But
having a Shih Tzu isn’t all about you. Your Shih Tzu needs some
very important things from her human caretaker in order to thrive
and be a happy, healthy dog. Considering all she does for you, you
must be willing, as a responsible and dedicated pet owner, to give
back to your Shih Tzu the things she needs.
What Does a Shih Tzu Need?
This little dog’s needs aren’t complicated and can be summarized
with one word: You! Okay, that’s not very specific, so this section
details your responsibilities to your little one.

Companionship, and a lot of it
A dog bred for companionship must be allowed to do his job, and
his job is to be with you. You have to be available and present for
him to feel like he has a purpose. When you aren’t home, your Shih
Tzu waits for you. If you leave him alone most of the day, he
spends most of his time waiting for you. Shih Tzu don’t like to be
alone all the time, and being alone is no life for a companion dog.
Plus, Shih Tzu are social animals. They love to play and be with
people, other dogs, and even cats. If you work all day, your Shih
Tzu will be much happier with another pet friend, a visit on your
lunch hour, or even spending the day at a nice doggy daycare facil-
ity. Spending time around other people and other dogs teaches the
Shih Tzu about the world, and this kind of experience makes your
Shih Tzu a more well-adjusted and friendly pet.
If you work at home, you can probably manage a schedule of work
and play and potty breaks for your dog, but if you work away from
your home, you need to make arrangements for someone to give
your Shih Tzu a potty break. At the end of the day, be prepared for
her to want to play and snuggle and just be with you.
Shelter . . . and a little luxury
A Shih Tzu needs warm, safe shelter. Just remember the following
if you want a Shih Tzu:
 Shih Tzu can’t live outside. Their short noses and heavy coats
make hot humid weather dangerous, and a Shih Tzu stuck out-
side in the sun all day (or even in the shade when the humidity
soars) is in serious danger of heatstroke (see Chapter 12 for
more info on how to keep your pup safe and healthy).
 Shih Tzu aren’t suited for cold weather. Shih Tzu may be
descended from Tibetan temple dogs that lived in frigid, snowy
climates, but those dogs were larger and heartier than today’s
dog, so forget about giving a Shih Tzu a doghouse and leaving
him at the mercy of the elements. Sure, your Shih Tzu may
enjoy a short romp in the snow, but be sure to dry him when he
comes in (and maybe snuggle by the fire for awhile, too).
So you know your Shih Tzu needs a warm safe place indoors, but
you can’t just let your Shih Tzu lie on the cold, hard floor, can you?
I suppose you could, but here’s a head’s up: This dog is a royal dog.
She expects a little luxury in her life. Is that really so much to ask?
For example, your Shih Tzu loves to lounge on soft furniture, and
she’ll probably prefer to sleep with you, if you let her. Whether you
Chapter 1: Shih Tzu and You
9

let your little dog into the bed or not, you also need other comfort-
able spots for your Shih Tzu to lounge when it’s not bed time. Try
out a soft dog bed, a safe crate or kennel, and access to other furni-
ture (check out Chapter 5 for adding some luxury).
Healthy food
Everybody functions better on healthy food than on junk food, of
course, but a nutrient-dense diet is vitally important for a small
dog because every bite counts. Your Shih Tzu, especially as a
puppy, can’t hold much in that little stomach, so food must be full
of good nutrition. Shih Tzu puppies also need to eat at least three
small meals to keep that small-dog metabolism fueled. A young
puppy that doesn’t get sufficient nutrition could die.
Additionally Shih Tzu have potentially sensitive skin, and a healthy
diet keeps both his skin and coat in good condition. Some pet food
companies make food designed specifically for small-breed puppies.
Or, you may decide to make a homemade diet for your Shih Tzu.
(For more about feeding your Shih Tzu properly, see Chapter 9.)
Exercise
Move it or lose it! Despite Lola’s small size, she needs exercise to
keep her muscles strong and her heart healthy. Too many Shih Tzu
become overweight from an excess of treats and too little exercise,
and it doesn’t take many extra calories each day to make an eight-
pound dog tip the scales in the direction of too-hefty. Extra weight
puts added stress on the Shih Tzu’s joints and internal organs,
compromising her natural good health. (Check out Chapter 8 for
specific ideas on playing and exercising with your dog.)
Never exercise your Shih Tzu in hot weather! Her short nose and
heavy coat aren’t built for the heat, and she can suffer serious
health consequences. See Chapter 13 for more info on heatstroke.
Training
He may be cute and charming. He may have great personal
charisma. But that doesn’t mean Samson knows that your new
carpet isn’t his personal toilet, or that children’s fingers aren’t for
nipping, or that dashing out the front door isn’t safe. All dogs need
training, even the cutest and most naturally polite. Don’t forget that
your Shih Tzu is a dog and doesn’t run the household. He needs to
know the rules, and you need to enforce the rules. For more on Shih
Tzu socialization, behavior, and training, see Chapters 11, 15, and 17.

Toy breeds
Ever since dog shows became popular in the 19th century, purebred dogs have been
registered with organizations like the American Kennel Club (AKC), the United
Kennel Club (UKC), the Canadian Kennel Club (CKC), and the Kennel Club of the UK.
These registries divide purebred dogs into groups according to their purpose. The
AKC — the largest registry in the United States — recognizes Shih Tzu as a Toy
breed, along with these other little guys:
 Affenpinscher
 Manchester Terrier
 Brussels Griffon
 Miniature Pinscher
 Cavalier King Charles Spaniel
 Papillon
 Chihuahua
 Pekingese
 Chinese Crested
 Pomeranian
 English Toy Spaniel
 Poodle (Toy)
 Havanese
 Pug
 Italian Greyhound
 Silky Terrier
 Japanese Chin
 Toy Fox Terrier
 Maltese
 Yorkshire Terrier
The Toy Group includes 21 breeds (as of 2006), including the Shih Tzu. Although some
other groups include smaller dogs, the Toy breeds have certain qualities in common:
 A portable size appropriate for many different living environments
 A big personality in a tiny package
 A propensity for companionship
Toy breeds have been bred to be companions to humans, some for thousands of
years. A Shih Tzu may look a lot different from a Chihuahua, a Pug, or a Chinese
Crested, but when it comes to skill as a companion, these little guys are all members
of the same club.
Group names and classification systems differ among registries. The UKC has a
Companion Group, which includes the Shih Tzu. The CKC and the Kennel Club of the
UK also include a Toy Group, but neither organization groups the Shih Tzu as a Toy
breed. The CKC considers him a member of the Non-Sporting Group, along with
dogs like the Lhasa Apso, Bichon Frise, and Tibetan Spaniel. The Kennel Club of the
UK states that he’s a member of the Utility Group, along with the Lhasa Apso, Tibetan
Spaniel, and Toy Poodle.

Medical care
A veterinarian who understands small dogs is one of your most
important allies in caring for your Shih Tzu. These pups need
regular check-ups and vaccinations (necessary parts of your
commitment to your Shih Tzu), but a vet can also help you with
pest control, skin allergies, behavioral issues, and any questions
you may have about caring for your little dog. For more on Shih
Tzu healthcare, refer to Chapters 12 and 13.
Grooming, grooming, and grooming!
I’ve saved the best for last . . . the best, or the most time-consuming,
depending on your perspective. Most Shih Tzu have long, thick
coats, which means they need grooming . . . a lot of it. Most pet
owners have their Shih Tzu professionally groomed every four to
six weeks. This timeline is a fine, but be prepared to pay for the
service.
Even with professional grooming, you still need to brush and comb
your Shih Tzu every day, or at least a few times a week, to keep
mats and tangles from forming as the coat grows.
If you keep your Shih Tzu in a short haircut, you can minimize the
work, but a Shih Tzu in full coat really should be thoroughly tended
every day. Add to your brushing other routines, such as regular nail
clipping, teeth cleaning, eye care, ear care, and all-over massage
and you have quite the high-maintenance little pooch. You can’t
wait for a professional groomer to do these tasks (unless you want
to take your Shih Tzu in weekly, which can get pretty expensive).
For more info on grooming your Shih Tzu, see Chapter 10.
Are You a Match?
To spin off one of the world’s greatest writers: To get a Shih Tzu
or not to get a Shih Tzu? That is the question. Don’t take this
decision lightly. You’re embarking on a lifetime (at least your
dog’s lifetime) commitment, and you want to make sure you,
your lifestyle, your family, and your home all are good matches
for a Shih Tzu. This section takes a closer look to see if a Shih Tzu
is the match for you.
Part I: The Quest for the Perfect Shih Tzu 
12

Why a Shih Tzu may be perfect
They’re short. They’re sassy. But are they right for you? A Shih Tzu
might be your perfect dog if you
 Love to brush dogs: Shih Tzu need a lot of grooming!
 Think flat-faced dogs are just too cute: The Shih Tzu doesn’t
have a long slender profile. He has an adorable short nose.
 Enjoy being worshipped: Your Shih Tzu thinks you’re all that.
 Think pampering and cuddling a small dog is fun: Your Shih
Tzu needs a lot of one-on-one cuddle time to be happy.
 Like to take your dog with you whenever you can: Your Shih
Tzu is always ready to hit the road with you.
 Work at home or come home frequently during the day:
Bred to be a companion dog, the Shih Tzu needs to spend
most of her time being a companion, not sitting alone.
 Think lying around on the couch makes the perfect weekend:
Shih Tzu aren’t athletic dogs. They prefer to hang out and relax.
 Can’t stand hot weather: Your Shih Tzu can’t stand it either.
In fact, Shih Tzu are prone to heatstroke.
Or why a Shih Tzu may not 
be your ideal dog
Shih Tzu are cute, but that criterion isn’t all that you should go on.
A Shih Tzu probably isn’t the best breed for you if you
 Get impatient brushing your own hair: If you don’t like to
waste time grooming yourself, you certainly won’t have time
to groom a Shih Tzu.
 Don’t like the sound of snoring and snuffling: The Shih Tzu’s
short nose creates a certain amount of nasal noise.
 Prefer an independent dog that isn’t too clingy. Shih Tzu
want to spend time with you.
 Think that because you have to work, your dog should make
himself useful, too: This dog’s job is to be with you. She’s not
interested in retrieving or pulling a sled or guarding the house.
 Aren’t home very often: Shih Tzu need people, not alone time.
Chapter 1: Shih Tzu and You 13

 Have several small children: Do you really have time to take
care of a Shih Tzu if you have small children? Probably not.
Plus, small children can accidentally injure a small dog.
 Like to go running, biking, swimming, or spend your week-
ends training for a marathon and think it would be fun for
the dog to come along, too: Unless you want to stick the Shih
Tzu in a doggy backpack, you can forget your dreams of a
marathon-training buddy.
 Love the heat and can see yourself relocating to a tropical
island: Your Shih Tzu would prefer a cabin in the mountains.
He doesn’t do tropical.
Quick Questions to Ask Yourself
If you read the preceding section, you may think you’ve decided
that a Shih Tzu is perfect for you, but wait! You still have a few more
topics to consider. Ask yourself the questions in the following sec-
tions, and spend some serious time considering your answers.
Why do you want a Shih Tzu?
What about a Shih Tzu really appeals to you? If you want to replace
a former Shih Tzu, you already have a good idea about what a Shih
Tzu is like, so getting a new Shih Tzu puppy may not seem so
scary. On the other hand, all Shih Tzu have their own, unique per-
sonalities, and your new puppy won’t be exactly like your beloved
former pet. Are you ready to accept your new dog?
If you haven’t had a Shih Tzu before but you just love the way they
look, that’s a good start. Much of her appeal is in her charming and
unique appearance. But you still have to be prepared for the
grooming requirements and the attention your Shih Tzu needs.
If you know a Shih Tzu but never owned one yourself, then you
already know how the adults look and act. Just remember that an
adult Shih Tzu is more likely to be calmer and less likely to cause
mischief than a feisty little puppy. Your Shih Tzu puppy will take at
least a couple of years to grow up, and you need to be patient.
Are you a homebody, a couch
potato, or an amateur athlete?
People often love the look of the Shih Tzu but just don’t realize
how physically limited this breed is. Shih Tzu simply can’t exercise
Part I: The Quest for the Perfect Shih Tzu 
14

too long, run very far, or even stay outside for extended periods in
hot weather.
If you like to be at home, however, your Shih Tzu will be your
happy and enthusiastic friend, companion, and armchair buddy.
And if you want to watch sports, your Shih Tzu will be more than
happy to help you cheer for your favorite team.
One exception is the competition Shih Tzu — some people train
their dogs to compete in obedience (a highly competitive sport
that measures how well a dog can follow commands) or agility (a
super-active obstacle course sport), but these dogs are like profes-
sional athletes (check Chapter 17 for more info). If you want an
exercise buddy, consider a sporting or herding breed instead.
Is your home Shih Tzu-friendly?
You may like the idea of a Shih Tzu, but if you aren’t the only one in
your home, you have to consider the environment as a whole. Is
your home Shih-Tzu friendly? The following sections help answer
this overall question.
Do you have young children?
Your two year old wouldn’t intentionally hurt a flea, but a young
child can’t understand that a Shih Tzu isn’t a stuffed animal. If you
have very young children, think twice about getting a Shih Tzu.
Young children can be too rough on a puppy, and a Shih Tzu may
even feel forced to nip or bite to defend herself from a child’s
harassment. If a puppy is dropped or fallen on, the puppy can be
seriously injured. Even an older Shih Tzu can be injured by a child
or may be less patient with a child’s poking and prodding, although
older Shih Tzu who’re used to children are a much better bet as a
companion to children.
Older kids, on the other hand, tend to be great and helpful com-
panions to Shih Tzu — if they’re taught how to handle the dog
safely and gently. They can walk, groom, and play with the dog.
(Check out Chapter 7 for more info on children and Shih Tzu.)
Do you have other pets?
Although the friendly Shih Tzu loves to hang with other dogs
or cats, some other breeds aren’t so dog-friendly. Some dog-
aggressive terriers and guardian breeds can attack a Shih Tzu or
mistake her for a prey animal. Or, a large dog may injure the Shih
Tzu during innocent roughhousing.
Chapter 1: Shih Tzu and You 15

However, some large dogs do well with small dogs and often defer to
their leadership. You must know your big dog very well before
taking that risk, and supervision is extremely important. Shih Tzu
normally get along with other small dogs, especially other Shih Tzu,
as long as the other dog is friendly, too. Even so, the bottom line is
your Shih Tzu would rather spend time with you than anyone else.
Some Shih Tzu may chase small animals like ferrets, hamsters,
rabbits, or birds. Others ignore these animals completely or try to
make friends. Be sure your home situation is safe for your new Shih
Tzu, as well as for your other pets before bringing a Shih Tzu home.
(Refer to Chapter 7 for more info on Shih Tzu and other animals.)
Do you like to do hair?
This book contains many references to the Shih Tzu’s significant
grooming needs, and that’s no accident. You really do need to
spend time grooming your dog every day. Even if you cut the dog’s
coat short, it continues to grow. You really have to like doing hair
(or be able to afford a professional groomer) to appreciate a Shih
Tzu as a pet. Check out Chapter 10 for more on grooming.
Can you afford a Shih Tzu?
A Shih Tzu is such a little dog, but he does incur some big
expenses. The average dog owner spends about $6,000 on a dog
over the dog’s lifetime (which can be anywhere from 12 to 18
years), including the cost of the dog, food, supplies, and standard
veterinary care. If you factor in the Shih Tzu’s longer-than-average
life span, the cost of monthly grooming, and any additional vet
care your Shih Tzu may need if he ever gets sick, you can go well
over that figure.
Even an adopted older Shih Tzu can cost a lot in vet care and sup-
plies. Consider the price of your time, too, because your Shih Tzu
takes up a lot of it. Can you afford all that? If it simply isn’t in the
budget, perhaps you should wait awhile until you’re in a better
position to afford a dog.
Despite the expense, the emotional, psychological, and physical
benefits of having a loving companion dog offset the financial costs
of pet ownership. Experts say petting a dog actually lowers your
blood pressure, and pet owners are generally healthier and live
longer than people without pets. Considering how much you get
back, you may realize that your Shih Tzu is worth every penny.

To Know a Shih Tzu Is
to Love a Shih Tzu
In This Chapter
 Taking a peek at the proper Shih Tzu look
 Comparing real Shih Tzu to the written breed standard
 Understanding the true Shih Tzu personality
 Appreciating Shih Tzu history from ancient Asia to today
You can call your Shih Tzu a dog, or you can be more specific
and call him a member of the Toy Group of dogs, or you can
just call him your baby (don’t even pretend you don’t call him
that), but do you really know what makes him a Shih Tzu? Knowing
a little more about exactly what a Shih Tzu is helps you better
appreciate and care for your new best friend.
For instance, do you know what kind of coat a Shih Tzu is sup-
posed to have? What color of eyes? What shape of ears? Do you
know how she’s supposed to move, how she’s been bred to
behave, and where she came from? There’s so much to know, but
never fear. This chapter helps you answer all these questions and
more. You take a closer look at what the Shih Tzu is all about,
because to really know your Shih Tzu is to really love her.
Picturing the Shih Tzu: How
Your Dog Should Look
While you’re gazing at your pup in admiration, you may be thinking
“Wow, she’s the most beautiful little dog I’ve ever seen,” and I’m
not going to argue with you. But does she look the way a Shih Tzu
is supposed to look? Does she display a true breed type or that
unique look that cries out: Now that’s a Shih Tzu!?

Whether your Shih Tzu measures up to show-dog standards is
irrelevant to how well she fulfills her function as a loyal and loving
pet, but understanding the breed standard may help you appreci-
ate your dog’s beauty all the more (or make her so-called faults all
the more endearing). She may not be perfect, but she’s yours.
The next sections give you a clearer picture of why Shih Tzu look
the way they do, how certain desirable qualities are passed along
through family lines, and what the detailed description of the tech-
nically correct Shih Tzu are, according to the American Kennel
Club (AKC) breed standard — the written description of the theo-
retically perfect Shih Tzu. You also discover how differently the
Shih Tzu in England looks, so you can differentiate between the
two, just in case you should ever meet a Shih Tzu from across the
pond (they’re pretty popular over there, too).
Considering pedigree
You may wonder why your Shih Tzu doesn’t look like the Shih Tzu
in that dog show on television or even the Shih Tzu you know
down the street. Differences in conformation — the official term for
the form, structure, and shape of a dog — have a lot to do with
pedigree, which is your dog’s ancestry or lineage. And that means
they have a lot to do with breeding.
Different breeders have different breeding priorities, and although
good breeders try to improve the Shih Tzu and stick to qualities
considered appropriate for the Shih Tzu, every breeder differs, and
every pedigree differs. A breeder may get a pup with a great quality,
like a particularly gorgeous coat. In an effort to pass that trait to the
next generation, the breeder may sacrifice perfection in other areas.
Plus, individual genetic lines tend to have differences, and individ-
ual breeders see things differently, too. Some focus more on health
and temperament or on the Shih Tzu look they believe is correct,
while others may focus on certain aspects they want to improve,
such as coat texture, expression, head shape, the front or back, or
movement. Some breeders may prefer a larger, sturdier dog while
others may want to breed for smaller dogs. Dog breeding is more
of an art than a science, so you just don’t see identical dogs being
churned out like they came from a factory (check out Chapter 3 for
more on what makes a good breeder).
Good breeders are proud to show you a puppy’s pedigree, which
may include dogs who’ve achieved titles in dog shows or dog per-
formance events. Breeders who won’t show you the pedigree or
don’t keep track of pedigrees may not be breeding as carefully.
Part I: The Quest for the Perfect Shih Tzu 
18

Ask questions about the pedigree, if you have them. The dogs in
that lineage determine how your dog looks as well as your dog’s
health and even her temperament. Don’t leave the breeder without
getting this documentation! Keep the pedigree on file with your
dog’s other important papers. (For more info on the paperwork
involved and what you may see in the pedigree, see Chapter 3.)
AKC breed standard
The breed standard is a written document that describes the ideal
dog of a certain breed. The Shih Tzu breed standard describes an
imaginary, perfect Shih Tzu, and this standard is what dog-show
judges study to pick the dogs that best match the standard. Dog
breeders also use the standard to guide their breeding programs to
nudge each generation of puppies toward perfection.
Why do you need to know about the Shih Tzu breed standard?
Frankly, you don’t. But, you may want to know about it just to see
how closely little Lola measures up. On the other hand, just
because Samson doesn’t have the right ear shape or his nose is a
little long doesn’t mean he isn’t perfect in your eyes. So feel free to
skip this section. Or you can stick with me if you’re curious about
the breed standard, but don’t want to keep looking up dog breeder
terminology, which official breed standards tend to use. If I say
topline or pastern or undershot bite, I clearly explain them.
If you have aspirations to become a dog show breeder, look care-
fully at this section, as well as the officially worded breed standard,
which you can find on the AKC Web site: www.akc.org/breeds/
shih_tzu/index.cfm.
General appearance
The first thing the Shih Tzu breed standard talks about is general
appearance (see Figure 2-1). The Shih Tzu is a Toy dog, which means
he’s small, but he’s also sturdy and lively. The Shih Tzu is no quiver-
ing, delicate flower! He should look a tad arrogant, like a member of
a palace household, and feel solid and heavy for his size.
Size, proportion, and substance
Shih Tzu should be 9 to 101⁄2 inches tall when measured at the peak
of the shoulder down to the ground. If you plan to show your dog,
make sure that he isn’t less than 8 inches tall or more than 11
inches tall. Shih Tzu can’t be disqualified for height or weight, but
the judge can consider a too-small or large Shih Tzu faulty.
Chapter 2: To Know a Shih Tzu Is to Love a Shih Tzu 19

Figure 2-1: Highlights of the Shih Tzu breed standard.
Adult Shih Tzu typically weigh 9 to 16 pounds, and they should be
slightly longer than tall. Shih Tzu aren’t meant to be leggy. Instead,
they should be compact and low without appearing squatty. You
want your pup to look elegant and aristocratic, but regardless
of size, he should always be compact and solid. Your Shih Tzu
shouldn’t look like he can blow away if a strong wind came along!
(But he can stand in the wind, nose up, silky coat whipping dramati-
cally around him, just to prove how gallant he is.)
Head
When you look at your Shih Tzu’s head, you may just see the head
of a Shih Tzu, but there’s so much more involved in the judging of a
Shih Tzu’s head. For example:
 Head: The head should be round and broad with plenty of
space between the eyes.
 Expression: Shih Tzu must have a characteristic sweet, warm
expression that exudes friendly, affectionate warmth and trust.
 Eyes: The eyes should be large and round but not bulging.
They shouldn’t look ready to pop out of their sockets! The
most desirable Shih Tzu eyes are very dark with open, friendly
warmth. They’ll be lighter on dogs with liver or blue coats.
 Ears: The Shih Tzu ears are large and set slightly below the
crown, with plenty of long hair so the ears flow into the coat.

Part I: The Quest for the Perfect Shih Tzu 
20

 Skull: The skull is domed with an obvious curve from skull to
muzzle. There’s a definite stop, which is the term for that
place where the muzzle meets the head.
 Nose: Shih Tzu nostrils should be wide open for easy breath-
ing, and all Shih Tzu should have a dark, black nose; black
lips; and black eye rims; except on the liver and blue dogs.
Pink noses, lips, and eye rims are considered faults.
 Bite: The Shih Tzu bite is undershot, meaning the top teeth fall
behind the bottom teeth when the mouth is closed.
Some Shih Tzu tend to have crooked or missing teeth, and
although that’s technically not ideal, most judges don’t
consider it too problematic. However, the teeth and tongue
shouldn’t show when the mouth is closed and an overshot
bite — the top teeth closing well in front of the bottom teeth,
the way your teeth probably do — is a definite fault.
Neck, topline, body
The most important thing when looking at a Shih Tzu body — at
least for a dog show judge or a breeder evaluating potential puppy
parents — is that all the parts fit together in a balanced way. No
one part should stand out. The neck should be long enough that
the dog can look around easily and have a nice smooth line from
head to tail. The topline (the line along the top of the back, when
you look at it in profile) should be parallel to the ground, rather
than sloping down or up toward the tail. The tummy shouldn’t tuck
up, but should flow smoothly from chest to abdomen, and the
body should be just slightly longer than tall.
Shih Tzu have broad, deep chests, not barrel chests. They should
have plenty of breathing room. The tail is set high on the back with
a big fluffy plume of hair curled elegantly over the back. Low-set
tails (tails placed down below the level of the spine) or droopy or
flat tails don’t look good in the show ring and can indicate that the
dog isn’t having a good time. A tail held proudly makes your Shih
Tzu look great (and indicates that your dog’s in a good mood).
Forequarters and hindquarters
Forequarters is the term referring to the front of the dog — the
shoulders and front legs when you look at the dog face-to-face.
The shoulders fit well into the dog with a nice deep angle so the
dog can move easily. The legs should be straight and muscular
with plenty of space between them for the broad chest, but the
elbows should sit close into the body. The feet should be strong,
nicely cushioned, and pointing straight ahead, not out or in. He
needs a front assembly (another breeder term for the whole front
end) that allows him to stand with sturdy confidence.
Chapter 2: To Know a Shih Tzu Is to Love a Shih Tzu 21

Hindquarters is the term for the back view of the dog, as you’re
facing his tail. The angles of the hips and rear legs as well as the
feet should match the front, so the dog is balanced with strong
muscular legs and plenty of sturdy bone.
Coat, color, and markings
The Shih Tzu coat is his most stunning and impressive feature.
Luxurious and dense, straight or just slightly wavy, the coat has a
thick undercoat beneath a longer overcoat. The hair on the head
and ears is long and flowing and typically tied up on top of the
head into a peppy little topknot. Thin, sparse coats are a fault,
although females who haven’t been spayed occasionally experi-
ence a thinning coat because of hormonal changes. (The Shih Tzu
equivalent of PMS and a bad hair day all in one.)
Dog show exhibitors may neaten up the coat and trim the feet, rear
end, and the very bottom of the coat, but too much trimming is
considered a fault. The dog should look natural, not shaped like a
Poodle. As for color and markings, Shih Tzu may be any color and
any pattern with any markings. None of these are technically con-
sidered better or worse than any other, although the white and
gold Shih Tzu is the most common and the most popular.
Gait
Gait refers to the way the Shih Tzu moves. He shouldn’t race along
or look like he has to be hauled around the dog show ring by the
leash. The way he walks indicates not only how well he’s put
together but also his whole attitude. He should move on his own
steam and with grace and power in a confident straight line. He
shouldn’t look like he’s waddling or laboring to move. When he
moves, the topline should stay parallel to the ground and his tail
should stay gently swirled over his back — poetry in motion.
Temperament
If a Shih Tzu doesn’t act like a lovable and adoring companion dog,
calling him a Shih Tzu would be difficult. The attitude is what the
dog’s all about — his very essence.
Temperament matters (or should matter) just as much as coat or
head shape or anything else in the show ring. Shih Tzu should be
outgoing, happy, and trusting toward the judge. Your pup shouldn’t
act shy or withdrawn in the show ring (or at home or anywhere
else, for that matter). A Shih Tzu should believe the world is a
kind, friendly, and benevolent place where everybody loves him,
and he should act accordingly.

The Shih Tzu in England
The AKC categorizes the Shih Tzu as a Toy breed, but the United
States is the only country that does. The Kennel Club of England
groups the Shih Tzu with the Utility dogs — a group akin to what
the AKC calls the Non-Sporting Group — such as the Boston
Terrier, French Bulldog, Lhasa Apso, Miniature Schnauzer, and
Poodles. The FCI — the organization most of the world other than
the United States, Canada, and Great Britain adhere to when cate-
gorizing dog breeds — calls the Shih Tzu not only a Tibetan breed
but also a Companion breed, rather than a Toy. (Even Canada con-
siders the Shih Tzu a Non-Sporting rather than a Toy breed. Other
countries may lump the Shih Tzu in with other larger, sturdier
Chapter 2: To Know a Shih Tzu Is to Love a Shih Tzu 23
What about Imperial Shih Tzu
or Teacup Shih Tzu?
The Imperial Shih Tzu, also called the Teacup Shih Tzu, is a super-small version of
a Shih Tzu. These names aren’t official, and neither the AKC nor the American Shih
Tzu Club (ASTC) recognize this so-called variety of Shih Tzu, but breeders who breed
specifically for the small size claim that theirs is a legitimate type of Shih Tzu, even
if the AKC doesn’t recognize it.
Weighing in at just 3 to 6 pounds as adults (well below the official breed standard
suggested weight of 9 to 16 pounds), these tiny dogs may look too cute to be con-
troversial, but controversial they are. Some say they’re runts of the litter and prone
to major health problems, so they should cost less, not more, than a normal-sized
Shih Tzu. Others say these tiny precious jewels are rare and special and just as
likely to be perfectly healthy — and worth a premium price (I’ve seen them going for
$3,000!). If you bring up the subject with Shih Tzu breeders on either side, you’re
likely to get an earful. However, if you want to be official about it, no breed club or
official written standard existing today (at least, none I’m aware of) advocates these
small Shih Tzu.
If you do decide to bring home an Imperial Shih Tzu or Teacup Shih Tzu, please be
aware that you take on this size of dog at your own risk. Although your dog may be
perfectly healthy and oh-so-adorable, you may end up spending a lot more money
at the vet than you would with a normal-sized Shih Tzu. Also, dogs this small don’t
make a good match for homes with little kids, who can easily injure a small dog by
mistake. And please, watch where you step! For more info on the AKC and ASTC,
visit their respective Web sites: www.akc.org and www.shihtzu.org. To read
the ASTC’s position statement on Imperial Shih Tzu, look at www.shihtzu.org/

breeds because he’s so heavy-boned and solid, instead of delicate
like a tiny Yorkie or Maltese. Why do Americans have to be differ-
ent? I guess it’s just the American way.)
But much of the history of the Shih Tzu happened in England, so
it’s worth noting that Shih Tzu in England aren’t only considered
Utility dogs (meaning they have a function of some sort, although
the breed standard doesn’t specify what it is), but stand a tad
taller and weigh a bit more than in the United States. Like any
breed, Shih Tzu in England have gradually evolved to look slightly
different, because of fashion and different genetic lines.
If you look at the Kennel Club of the United Kingdom’s official
breed standard (www.thekennelclub.org.uk/item/174), it
allows for a slightly heavier, although not taller, dog at a height of
not more than 27 centimeters (101⁄2 inches) and about 41⁄2 to 8 kilo-
grams (about 10 to 18 pounds). The standard recommends an ideal
weight of 41⁄2 to 71⁄2 kilograms, or 10 to 16 pounds. But in general, if
you compared show dogs from both countries, the British dogs
look a little bit bigger.
Other differences in the standard include
 A preference for a white blaze or white stripe of fur running
down the forehead and between the eyes.
 A preference for a white tail tip in parti-colored dogs (parti-
colored is a pattern of multi-colored patches). The AKC stan-
dard gives absolutely no official preference to any particular
color or marking.
 A strongly recommended topknot, which isn’t specifically rec-
ommended in the AKC standard.
 A reference to the word short when discussing the legs.
 A description of the Shih Tzu’s face as chrysanthemum-like,
an effect that comes from hair that grows upward on the nose.
How Shih Tzu Should
Act: Personality
One of the Shih Tzu’s most endearing qualities is his temperament.
Shih Tzu have been bred for generations to be the ultimate com-
panion dog, and this section looks more closely at why those mag-
netic personality traits make your Shih Tzu simply irresistible.
Part I: The Quest for the Perfect Shih Tzu 
24

Hopelessly devoted to you
First and foremost, a Shih Tzu is devoted, wholly and completely,
to you and your needs (check out Figure 2-2). Sure, sometimes he
likes to play with a toy or romp around the living room, but you
can’t ask for a better listener, lap warmer, or sympathetic furry ear.
Figure 2-2: A cuddly Shih Tzu makes a great companion.
Your Shih Tzu can sit at your feet for hours gently snoozing, but he
doesn’t forget to occasionally gaze up at you in adoration. If you
want a dog who does his own thing and only occasionally bothers
to notice you, this breed may not be the one for you. But if you
desire a pet who thinks it’s all about you, then this is your dog.
No yip zone: The Shih Tzu’s 
Zen-like tranquility
You’ve heard of those yappy little ankle-biting lap dogs, right? Well,
the Shih Tzu isn’t one of them. Calm and self-possessed, the Shih
Tzu watches and waits. Sure, he may bark at the UPS guy when he
comes right up to the door, but he’s not bred to be a watchdog.
Chapter 2: To Know a Shih Tzu Is to Love a Shih Tzu 25

Your Shih Tzu is too focused on you to worry about anybody else
who may be walking by outside, and if somebody else comes in the
house, your Shih Tzu thinks it’s obvious that this new friend has
arrived for the sole purpose of petting and loving him. Sure, excep-
tions do exist, and you’ll find some dogs who bark a lot, especially
among dogs who were never properly socialized (check out
Chapter 11 for more on socializing your Shih Tzu). Some people
talk more than others, and some Shih Tzu bark more than others.
But in general, this dog isn’t yippy or suspicious.
“So this cat goes into a bar . . . ”:
Shih Tzu sense of humor
Part of being a good buddy is having a sense of humor, and your
funny little Shih Tzu quickly discovers how to make you laugh.
Whether he’s flipping his stuffed mouse toy into the air and then
spinning around to see where it landed, pretending to play fetch
then darting just out of reach when you try to take back the ball, or
gazing at you with an expression so serious and concerned that
your bad mood dissolves completely, your Shih Tzu brightens your
day and puts a smile on your face. Who can resist that?
Love the one you’re with: 
The adaptable little dog
As devoted as Shih Tzu may be, they also adapt well to new owners.
Don’t be offended. It isn’t that your Shih Tzu doesn’t worship you. It’s
just that he loves everybody else, too. Anyone willing to feed, pet,
groom, and love a Shih Tzu becomes that dog’s new best friend.
This factor in their behavior makes considering an older Shih Tzu
for adoption an excellent decision. Shih Tzu don’t waste away pining
for a former owner and ignore you. And an older dog may already be
housetrained (not a bad bonus, eh?). If you have a warm lap and a
treat to share, your Shih Tzu will adapt just to his new home. (For
more info on adopting an older Shih Tzu, see Chapter 4.)
My crown, please: The Shih Tzu’s
natural arrogance

healthy self-concept, too. The Shih Tzu reveals his natural arrogance

in the way he stands, moves, and looks around with his flat little
nose in the air. He may even look down his nose at someone he isn’t
quite sure deserves his attention — but probably not too often.
Consider him a benevolent king.
And don’t worry if you’re not ancestry. Your Shih Tzu doesn’t mind.
He loves you just the same, and he’s royal enough for both of you —
he just has to show you who runs the castle once in awhile.
Looking Back at the 
Shih Tzu’s History
Your dog may be all-American (or all-British, or all-Canadian, as
the case may be), but her ancestors came from the far-away East.
Discovering her past can be fun and interesting. You may look at
your dog staring meditatively out the window and wonder, “Where
did you come from?” In this section, I take a step back in time to
show you where the Shih Tzu’s relatives came from, starting way
back in ancient Tibet. Also you can discover how the Shih Tzu
came to the Western world and how today’s Shih Tzu evolved.
This section is a no-yawning zone. The Shih Tzu history is fun, not
like a boring high school history lecture on the Middle Ages, so
stick with me, just for kicks (or don’t, if dog lore really isn’t your
thing — I’m not going to make you read it!).
Ancient Shih Tzu: Tibet versus China
Ask Shih Tzu historians (yes, they exist) where the Shih Tzu origi-
nated, and you may get different answers. Not everybody agrees
whether the Shih Tzu came from Tibet or China or even the
Mediterranean. Most concede that dogs related to the modern-day
Shih Tzu probably came from Tibet, but how long they were there
and how much influence they had on the present-day Shih Tzu,
may never be known. Some say that Tibetan dogs, given to Chinese
royalty as gifts, were bred with Chinese dogs like Pekingese and
Pugs, to create the Shih Tzu. Others suspect the Shih Tzu is a
Tibetan original, not a Pekingese descendant.
I’m not going to get in the middle of that argument (dog historians
tend to have very strong opinions!), so I’ll just say that the Shih
Tzu’s ancestors probably came from Tibet, but the dog of today
was mostly developed in China.
Chapter 2: To Know a Shih Tzu Is to Love a Shih Tzu 27

Lion-hearted
Shih Tzu means lion, and in both Tibet and pre-Communist China,
the lion was a symbol of Buddhism. The Tibetan lamas supposedly
bred their dogs to look like little lions; these dogs lived in the tem-
ples and were considered holy. In China, the lion dog was primarily
a companion to royalty, but royal breeding programs continued to
breed for the look of the lion.
You can see this influence in several other small Asian breeds from
Buddhist countries, including the Lhasa Apso, the Tibetan Spaniel,
the Japanese Chin, and the Pekingese. All have long flowing coats,
flat faces, big dark eyes, and the sturdy bone structures one may
expect from a miniature lion. Resemblances aside, Shih Tzu fans
generally prefer to think that the Shih Tzu is the original lion dog.
The Shih Tzu’s popularity in China
Back in the day, before dog shows, breeds didn’t exactly have set
names or breed standards. Dogs were often crossed or bred
according to unknown goals, and the Shih Tzu type wasn’t set for
many centuries. Small long-coated dogs were a matter of fashion.
Depending on the emperor at the time, the look and style of these
small dogs often changed. Sometimes the very small ones, called
sleeve dogs, were fashionable, and at other times, larger shaggier
dogs were more in favor and often bred to have particular markings.
Some years, everybody loved the black Shih Tzu. Some years, the
white. You know how fashion goes. One day you’re in, the next
you’re out.
So even though you can’t know precisely when the Shih Tzu became
the Shih Tzu, you can be sure that your Shih Tzu (or the Shih Tzu
you plan to bring home) has Chinese dogs somewhere in her blood-
lines, and her ancestors really were very trendy in their time.
Dictator Dowager and her love for the Shih Tzu
Nobody embraced the quest for the perfect Shih Tzu more heartily
than the Dowager Empress T’zu Hsi, who ruled China from the mid-
19th century until her death in 1908. You can probably call her the
great grandmother of the Shih Tzu because she’s the first one to
breed Shih Tzu with precision and purpose — or at least, the first
one on record. Her vast kennels of Pekingese, Pugs, and Shih Tzu
refined and cemented the type for these three Chinese breeds.
The Dowager Empress may not have been the most benevolent
of dictators — in fact, history suggests that she was heartlessly
ruthless — but she definitely loved her dogs, and her palace
eunuchs made great strides in creating the modern Shih Tzu.
Part I: The Quest for the Perfect Shih Tzu 
28

When the Empress died, however, the royal kennels fell apart. Dogs
were sold or given away, and during the next few decades, fanciers
in China bred the little lion dogs, showed them in dog shows under
a variety of names, and exported some to the West. The Shih Tzu
became a commoner! (And it’s a good thing, too, because when com-
munism came to China, dog breeding was abolished and the lion dog
became, for all practical purposes, extinct in its native land.)
Go West, young Shih Tzu!
Dogs imported to other countries and regions as gifts during the
19th century and early 20th century kept the breed alive. Actually,
all the Shih Tzu in the United States today came from just a few
dogs rescued from China. By the middle of the 20th century, Shih
Tzu were here to stay, having totally charmed the Western world.
The first dogs arrive in the United States
The first Shih Tzu imported into the States from England in 1938
were two females named Ding-Ling of the Mynd and Wuffles of the
Mynd. More followed, but at the time they weren’t distinguished
from Lhasa Apsos and the AKC, who probably figured that all long-
haired small dogs of Tibetan ancestry were the same, considered
them Lhasa Apsos. In fact, well into the 20th century, the name still
wasn’t set. People called the Shih Tzu all kinds of names including
Lhasa Lion Dog, Tibetan Poodle, and Lhasa Terrier.
In 1955, after breeders spent a lot of energy trying to convince the
AKC that the Shih Tzu had a following (and was different than a
Lhasa Apso), the AKC accepted the Shih Tzu as a distinct breed in
the Miscellaneous Class — the step before final recognition as part of
one of the AKC’s seven groups of dogs. The Shih Tzu was official . . .
sort of. But dogs in the Miscellaneous Class can’t compete in dog
shows, so the Shih Tzu had one more hurdle to overcome — full and
total AKC recognition.
The American Shih Tzu Club is created
The American Shih Tzu Club (ASTC) formed in 1963 to promote the
breed more actively. The club members wanted to show off their
beautiful little lion dogs in the dog show ring! They approached
the AKC relentlessly and followed all the rules and waded through
the necessary red tape in an attempt to get official and full recogni-
tion. But one big problem remained: Someone crossed a Pekingese
into the Shih Tzu in England in 1952, and the AKC required three
generations of pure, unadulterated Shih Tzu breeding to accept the
Shih Tzu as a full-fledged member of the AKC’s Toy Group.
Chapter 2: To Know a Shih Tzu Is to Love a Shih Tzu 29

The AKC finally completely accepts the Shih Tzu
Popularity has its perks. The Shih Tzu got so popular so fast that
nobody could stop its momentum and in 1969, the AKC finally
accepted the Shih Tzu into the Toy Group. On the very first day the
Shih Tzu was officially recognized, a little Shih Tzu named Canadian
Champion Chumulari Ying-Ying won Best in Show at the New
Brunswick Kennel Club, and Shih Tzu immediately swept the dog-
show circuit, picking up Best Toy and Best in Show wins right and
left. The Shih Tzu has remained a beloved and popular dog show
competitor ever since.
Shih Tzu today
By the 1980s, the Shih Tzu had skyrocketed in popularity. Today,
the Shih Tzu is the ninth most popular breed in the United States,
according to the AKC, with more than 28,000 Shih Tzu registered —
a pretty impressive journey from near-extinction.
Today, Shih Tzu owners in countries all over the world breed,
show, and love the Shih Tzu. But the breed has had some prob-
lems. One of the downsides of popularity is overbreeding. People
concerned more with profit than with health or temperament pro-
duced huge numbers of Shih Tzu throughout the second half of the
20th century, and many suffered health problems like renal dyspla-
sia, liver disease, eye problems, skin problems, and allergies (for
more on common Shih Tzu health problems, see Chapter 13),
because breeders weren’t paying attention to these health issues
when making breeding choices. They were more concerned with
volume. Another sad aftermath of this popularity was impulse
buying, buyer’s remorse, and abandonment, with many Shih Tzu
ending up in shelters and rescue groups (believe it or not, that still
happens today!). Some Shih Tzu developed bad temperaments —
either aggressive or super-shy — probably from a combination of
bad breeding and lack of proper socialization and training.
But the news isn’t all bad. Shih Tzu remain incredibly popular,
despite the fact that they need a lot of care and grooming. Why?
Just look at that adorable face. Shih Tzu may not live in the im-
perial palace anymore, but they’ve been bred for centuries to
be caring, affectionate, amusing, and endearing little companions 
with melt-your-heart eyes and heart-stopping beauty . . . and they
still are. Many thousands of pet owners have brought Shih Tzu into
their homes and given these little dogs long, happy, healthy lives
full of mutual adoration. Shih Tzu have come a long way to be your
companion, and aren’t you glad?

A
re you feeling confident that a Shih Tzu is the right breed for
you? If so, the next step is to find one. But where do you look?
Finding a Shih Tzu may seem pretty easy. The pet stores have them.
The newspaper lists some. Maybe your neighbor even has a litter of
puppies. But wait! I’m sure you’re very excited to start your search,
but before you open the newspaper to the classifieds section or run
down to your local pet store, take the time to read this chapter.
You want your new Shih Tzu to be healthy and well adjusted, right?
You want him to be friendly and cuddly, don’t you? The best way to
find a healthy dog is to start with a hobby breeder. Hobby breeders
have the breed’s best interest in mind. They breed carefully, select-
ing the healthiest dogs that are truest to the breed’s qualities. They
keep a close eye on the puppies that they produce and make a sin-
cere effort to find the very best homes for each one. Plus, hobby
breeders remain a helpful and interested resource throughout your
dog’s life. You won’t get that kind of service, or dogs bred with
such knowledge, love, and care, from inexperienced or accidental
breeders, or (in most cases) from pet stores, no matter how well-
meaning they may be.
I spend most of this chapter sharing what you need to know about
hobby breeders, including what they do and how to find a rep-
utable one. I also talk about how great it is to find a Shih Tzu at a
shelter or in a breed rescue group, and give that Shih Tzu a second
chance at a happy life.

If you already have a Shih Tzu, well, frankly, you don’t have to read
this chapter. You can skip to Chapter 5 (or whatever chapter
covers your current concerns). If you already have a Shih Tzu that
you purchased from a pet store, a classified ad, or that neighbor
with all those puppies, don’t worry. Your Shih Tzu should be a

How much is that doggie in the window?
How can you resist that roly-poly cuteness staring back at you through the thick
glass? The answer is, you can’t — or at least, that’s what pet stores are banking on.
Pet shops continue to do so well selling puppies, even at steep prices, because they
play off your need for instant gratification.
If you buy a Shih Tzu puppy from a pet store, you may end up with a wonderful,
healthy dog, as long as you’re willing to follow through and do what it takes — train-
ing classes, daily grooming, vet visits, and so on — to take care of that puppy for-
ever. On the other hand, that puppy may also develop some of the common genetic
or other health issues that good hobby breeders work so hard to avoid in their breed-
ing programs. Social issues may also exist because the puppy has been taken away
from his mother and littermates too soon.
Where you buy a Shih Tzu puppy is, of course, your choice, but I want you to real-
ize what comes with that high price tag. The following are just a couple of the risks
you need to consider:
 The puppy’s secret, unknown past: Many pet store dogs come from commer-
cial breeders who breed large numbers of puppies for profit. This isn’t a good
start in life for a tiny, sensitive little toy dog. Behaviorists assert that the earli-
est weeks in a puppy’s life are crucial for healthy behavior. How do you know
what your pet store puppy’s early weeks were like? Did he spend them getting
shipped in a truck? Was he taken away from his mother too soon? Did he get the
right kind of exposure to humans? With a pet store pup, you can’t know for sure.
 Potential health issues: Large commercial breeders rarely do health tests or
breed with health in mind. They breed for numbers, and for profit. Some do
health tests, but because you can’t see the parents of a pet store puppy, you
can’t know the genetic problems in his pedigree, or what diseases and other
problems he’s most at risk for developing. Without this info, it’s anybody’s guess
what genetic fate may be in store for your new pup.
 Looks aren’t everything: Not being able to see the parents matters not only for
health reasons but also for behavior and appearances. You don’t have as clear
a picture of how your puppy may look and behave when he grows up, if you
can’t see the parents. Many pet store pups look awfully cute but grow up to be
strange or ‘off’ examples of the breed. If you want to be sure your Shih Tzu looks
like a Shih Tzu as an adult, reconsider the pet store impulse buy.

wonderful, happy pet if he receives plenty of socialization, love,
and care from you. But if you haven’t made that big decision yet,
stick with me. I help you make the best possible choice.
Understanding How Breeders Differ
Being popular has a downside. Some people use the Shih Tzu’s
must-have status as a way to make a quick buck, breeding Shih Tzu
for profit and without regard to health or temperament. Some large
for-profit breeding operations supply pet stores with their dogs, and
these dogs sure are cute. But were they bred to look like Shih Tzu?
Were they tested for genetic problems? Were they well socialized in
the whelping box? How soon were they taken away from their moth-
ers? What did their parents look like? A small hobby breeder can
answer these questions for you, but in most cases, a pet store can’t.
For-profit breeder, inexperienced breeder, accidental breeder,
whichever — the result probably isn’t what you had in mind when
you pictured your perfect little portable pet, is it? That’s why you
and your potential pet benefit immensely from knowing how to
pick out an experienced, knowledgeable hobby breeder — small
noncommercial breeders who breed Shih Tzu because they love
and care about the breed. (Check out the next section for more
info on how to identify a reputable hobby breeder.)
Even those dogs bred by well-meaning folks who haven’t really
studied dog breeding, genetics, or the best ways to socialize young
puppies, can turn out to have serious genetic problems or tempera-
ment issues. As for your neighbor and that accidental (or planned
“so the kids can experience the miracle of birth”) litters of puppies,
those dogs need a home, and they may be just fine. But again, you
don’t enjoy the many benefits you get from an experienced hobby

Reputable and ethical hobby breeders devote their lives to produc-
ing better, healthier, more beautiful Shih Tzu. They pay close atten-
tion to each puppy, handling and socializing them from birth. Good
breeders don’t just breed puppies. They try to improve the breed
by making each generation a little better. They pick out the right
dogs for the show ring, the right dogs for families who are more
active, and the right dogs for families with kids, for singles, and for
seniors. They can help you pick just the perfect jewel for you and
your family. They’re the Shih Tzu experts.

How do you identify a reputable hobby breeder? Good breeders
have a few important qualities in common. Good hobby breeders:
 Pay attention to health and genetics issues: Good hobby
breeders study Shih Tzu physical and mental health. They
know the health issues that are typical of the breed, and

A great way to identify a hobby breeder:
His extracurricular activities
Ask your breeder about his or her extracurricular Shih Tzu activities, like being
involved in clubs and dog shows. The following are some extracurricular activities
a hobby breeder may be involved in:
 Breed clubs: A good sign of a hobby breeder is that he or she belongs to a local
or national dog club where breeders and pet owners share info, take advan-
tage of resources and networking, and build Shih Tzu camaraderie. Examples
include the American Shih Tzu Club, a local Shih Tzu club, or an all-breed show
or training club. Many of these clubs require that breeder members sign a code
of ethics specifying good breeding practices.
 Dog shows: If a breeder participates in dog shows, she’s working to improve
the breed (or at least it’s a good sign of that fact). If the breeder doesn’t ever
show her dogs, she may be into breeding for the money instead of the good
health and temperament of the breed.
 Competitive obedience and dog sports: Shih Tzu like to have fun, and dog sports
give them that chance. Breeders who participate in competitive obedience and
other dog sports, such as agility, want their dogs to be versatile — both beauti-
ful and smart.
 Dog therapy: A Shih Tzu can melt your heart just by looking at you, and some
particularly gentle and intuitive Shih Tzu make excellent therapy dogs. Therapy
dogs go through a training program with their owners to teach them appropri-
ate behavior in a variety of settings. After both dog and owner pass the course,
they can visit people in need of a warm puppy to pet, such as hospitalized chil-
dren, home-bound seniors, psychiatric patients, people living in retirement cen-
ters, and children with terminal illnesses.
If the hobby breeder you’re considering has certified therapy dogs, you can bet
she’s committed to making a positive difference in the world (and probably has
dogs with wonderful temperaments). For more details on getting involved in a
therapy dog program, see Chapter 17.

they work to weed them out of their dog’s genetic lines. (For
more information on specific Shih Tzu health issues, see
Chapter 13.)
 Want to know all about you: Some breeders require visits to
your home, and practically all good breeders require meeting
every single family member, especially the kids. Breeders want
to know where you plan to keep the dog, how often you’re
home, and make sure that you understand the grooming
requirements.
 Show you their digs: Good hobby breeders breed their
puppies indoors where they can safely care for and attend
to the puppies, and they’ll show you. Shih Tzu aren’t kennel
dogs!
 Offer follow-up care: Good breeders offer you follow-up
care after you’ve taken your little bundle of joy home. If the
dog won’t stop crying or you can’t figure out the best way
to groom him, or you wonder why he won’t eat his food, you
can call the breeder and she’ll help you. A problem you may
not have a clue how to solve may be, to your breeder, an
easy fix.
 Provide appropriate documentation: A good breeder pro-
vides you with the puppy’s pedigree (his family tree), medical
records including vaccinations, and the paperwork necessary
to register your dog with the American Kennel Club (AKC) or
United Kennel Club (UKC). Also, a good breeder provides a
health guarantee and a contract. (Check out Chapter 4 for
more info on the necessary paperwork.)
 Maintain a waiting list: The best breeders with the best repu-
tations often have waiting lists because they breed for quality,
not quantity. I know you want your puppy now, but a great
dog is worth the wait.
 Do more than just breed: Good breeders almost always show
their dogs in conformation dog shows or obedience. Check
out the nearby sidebar, “A great way to identify a hobby
breeder: His extracurricular activities” for more info.
 Don’t breed for the money: Hobby breeders rarely, if ever,
make a profit from breeding dogs. They do what they do out
of passion for the breed and for a hobby, not because it’s a
business.
Chapter 3: What You Need to Know Before You Buy or Adopt 35

Searching for a Good Breeder
Although you have many options in finding your new Shih Tzu,
including a pet store (check out the nearby sidebar, “How much is
that doggie in the window?”), from the classifieds (check out the
nearby sidebar, “The classified ads: Shih Tzu for sale”), and from
auctions and flea markets (refer to the nearby sidebar, “Going
once, going twice: Auctions and flea markets”), a hobby breeder is
still your safest bet.
If you’re serious about using a good hobby breeder, you may be
wondering where on earth you find these wonderful hobby breed-
ers. Well, you’ve come to the right section. Start with the following
useful resources that can point you in the right direction:
 The American Shih Tzu Club (ASTC): The American Kennel
Club (AKC) recognizes this club as the national guardians of
the Shih Tzu. Many of the best hobby breeders are members,
and they have a breeder referral committee. You can find a list
of the current members on the Web site (www.shitzu.org)
with contact information. Under the ASTC menu, click Breeder
Referral Committee.
 Dog shows: These shows are great places to meet good breed-
ers in person and see how the adult dogs look. Find nearby
dog shows on the AKC Web site: www.akc.org. Go to the
Events tab and click Events and Awards Search.
Part I: The Quest for the Perfect Shih Tzu 
36
The classified ads: Shih Tzu for sale
You’re in the market for a new dog, and every week you see a smorgasbord of Shih
Tzu listed for sale in the classifieds, either online or in your daily newspaper. Does
that mean that these are good sources? Not necessarily. Most reputable hobby
breeders don’t advertise in the paper because they have more than enough buyers
for their carefully planned litters.
Sometimes, you can find a good puppy through the newspaper, but don’t act on
impulse. Evaluate breeders who advertise in the newspaper exactly like you would
evaluate any breeder. (See the section “Recognizing Good Hobby Breeders” in this
chapter for more info.)
If the newspaper says “Free to Good Home,” just remember: Free puppies often end
up costing even more than expensive puppies from good breeders because of
health and/or temperament problems. That dog is free for a reason.

 Dog clubs: The AKC can refer you to local and national Shih
Tzu and all-breed dog clubs, many of which keep lists of good
hobby breeders. Join a local club and you may also make
some great friends who love Shih Tzu as much as you do. To
find this info, head to www.akc.org; then click Clubs.
 Phone a friend: Ask for a reference from someone you trust
who’s bought a Shih Tzu. If she found a good breeder and had
a great experience, she’ll probably be glad to share that info.
If you want to find a good Shih Tzu breeder, you may consider
searching online. However, if you do, you’ll get a lot of for-profit
breeders and breeders with less experience along with the good
ones, and the best breeders in your area may or may not have Web
sites. In other words, search online if you want, but don’t rely
solely on an Internet search to find a good breeder. Dog clubs can
usually give you more reliable, and more local, info than the
Internet, or at least help you narrow down your list.
After you’ve found a hobby breeder (or two or three) you want to
visit, don’t just dive right in and snatch up the first puppy you see.
Take your time and be selective. This section arms you with impor-
tant pointers to remember when investigating breeders.
Ask the appropriate questions
When you first contact a breeder on the phone, a few pointed
questions can reveal a ton of information. You may already have
some questions in mind, but here are some others that can reveal
much about a breeder’s quality. Ask the breeder these questions
before you even make a visit.
 Do you specialize in Shih Tzu? You want a breeder who
breeds Shih Tzu, not seven different kinds of dogs that
happen to be the most popular. If the breeder answers yes,
ask some more in-depth questions:
• How often do you breed a litter? Good hobby breeders
usually don’t breed more than a litter every year, or
even less often. Commercial and for-profit breeders have
puppies available all the time, and may breed six, seven,
eight, or more litters per year.
• How long have you been breeding Shih Tzu? New
breeders can be great, but people who have been breed-
ing Shih Tzu for a long time probably have a lot more
knowledge and experience. The puppies may be health-
ier and better pets because of that experience.
Chapter 3: What You Need to Know Before You Buy or Adopt 37

 Are you a member of the national or local club? This ques-
tion indicates a commitment to learning about Shih Tzu and
breeding in an organized and ethical fashion.
 Do you show your dogs? If so, how many dogs of your
breeding are champions? Breeders who show and whose
dogs win championships are likely producing excellent pets,
too. If your puppy’s parents are both champions, that’s a good
sign you’re working with someone who really understands the
breed, and how Shih Tzu look and act.
 Where do you raise the puppies? Shih Tzu aren’t kennel
dogs, and good breeders raise them inside a warm house,
often in a box in the kitchen or the living room so they can be
part of the family from the very start.
 Can I come out to see the litter or the parents of the litter?
Expect the breeder to want to meet you and interview you, so
the answer, of course, should be yes. If the breeder doesn’t
want to let you see the parents, consider that a red flag. The
parents may not look or act the way a Shih Tzu should. Many
breeders don’t have the father on the premises but you
should be able to see the mother, and at least see a picture of
the father and his pedigree.
Also, some breeders ship Shih Tzu puppies, and on occasion,
with reputable breeders and older puppies, doing so may work.
However, as a general rule, this isn’t a good idea for the heat-
intolerant and sensitive Shih Tzu, particularly when he’s young
or very small. The plane trip can be not only physically difficult
for the puppy, subjecting him to jostling and extreme tempera-
tures, but also could be frightening. The traumatic experience
can cause future behavior problems, such as separation anxi-
ety or fearfulness (for more on Shih Tzu behavior issues, see
Chapter 11).
 When will you have puppies available? Because good hobby
breeders don’t breed constantly, they often don’t have puppies
available. When you find a breeder you feel good about, get on
a waiting list. You can ask for a referral to another breeder who
may have puppies right now. However, doing so makes you
look impatient, so be careful how you approach this subject. If
you seem primed to make an impulse purchase — you want a
Shih Tzu and you want her now — the breeder won’t want to
refer you to anybody. Breeders who truly care about Shih Tzu
won’t want impulsive types to snap up — and possibly later
regret — a Shih Tzu.
Asking about price before meeting in person makes a bad impres-
sion. Breeders think you’re only interested in a good deal, instead
of a good dog. Save that question for when you pay a visit.
Part I: The Quest for the Perfect Shih Tzu 
38

Pay a visit
After you make initial contact with a few breeders, pay a visit
either to meet the parents of the litter-to-be or to visit the puppies.
In most cases, you won’t bring home a puppy on this first visit.
This visit is a get-to-know-each-other trip. (Just keep telling your-
self that instant gratification isn’t a good thing!)
The breeder should be happy to give you a tour and show you how
he cares for the dogs. In that tour, make sure that you see where
the dogs are kept and that the breeder is up-front about the condi-
tions. Before you actually think of selecting a dog, look around, pay
attention, and get to know the breeder as well as the dogs.
Be inquisitive
When you meet the breeder, expect him to ask you a lot of questions
about you, your home, and your situation. The breeder wants to
make sure you’ll make a good and suitable guardian of his precious
puppies. You should ask the breeder some questions, too. Don’t
agree to a puppy purchase until you find out the following info:
 What should I know about Shih Tzu before deciding this
breed is for me? Even if you’ve already read all about Shih Tzu
and have a good idea of the answer, it can be enlightening to
see what the breeder says. A breeder who emphasizes the chal-
lenges, such as the amount of grooming required, housetrain-
ing, and some of the health issues, may be more honest than a
Chapter 3: What You Need to Know Before You Buy or Adopt 39
Going once, going twice: 
Auctions and flea markets
You may have seen a Shih Tzu sold at a dog auctions that sell to pet stores and
others, at a flea market with boxes of dogs next to the bric-a-brac, and even out in
front of the grocery store. However, as adorable as these puppies may look, these
are some of the worst sources for dogs. These dogs often have serious health prob-
lems and are usually taken away from their mothers too early, which many animal
behaviorists believe has serious consequences for the puppy’s future behavior.
These puppies don’t normally receive good healthcare or socialization, don’t come
with any health guarantees, and after you buy, the seller is usually long gone. You
could be in for a host of problems.
It may seem almost impossible to avoid “saving” a puppy from a situation like this,
if you happen to encounter it. I understand that impulse, I really do. But remember,
you’re taking a big risk buying a puppy from this kind of source.

breeder who has nothing but reports of how easy and perfect
Shih Tzu are. Shih Tzu are awesome, make no mistake — but no
breed is effortless, and a good breeder wants to weed out pet
owners who won’t be a good match.
 When you breed, are you trying to produce any particular
traits? You want a breeder who is working for better health and
behavior as the most important priorities. However, keep in
mind that dog show breeders are also working toward a Shih
Tzu that not only acts but also looks perfect, so these breeders
may be specifically focused on issues in their own lines — a
nicer coat texture, a more appropriate head shape, a better
front-end, or various other appearance-related concerns. This
is fine, as long as health and behavior come first. An answer
you don’t want to hear: “Larger litter sizes.” Or “What do you
mean?”
 Are there any health-related issues or concerns in your
dogs? What health problems and genetic issues have you
encountered in your experience? If a breeder tells you that
his dogs have never had any health problems, he doesn’t test
because his Shih Tzu are healthy, or he doesn’t know what
you’re talking about, tuck your tail and run the other way.
Consider these statements huge red flags and keep looking for
a more reputable breeder who is honest with you about the
perfectly normal occurrence of certain health issues in his
breeding program.
 Can I see the vaccination records and any records of any
veterinary care the puppies have had so far? The breeder
should be happy to share this info with you.
 What guarantees do you offer? If so, under what circum-
stances do they apply? Reputable breeders usually have a con-
tract that includes some sort of health guarantee, to protect the
dog, you, and the breeder. Make sure you understand exactly
what you’re signing and what your rights are, as well as what
the breeder expects of you. If the breeder doesn’t require any
kind of contract and doesn’t guarantee anything, keep looking.
 Do you have references? Your breeder should be proud to give
you names and numbers of others who know him and have had
good experiences. Check the references. You never know what
you may hear when someone speaks to you confidentially.
 Are you available for follow-up if I have questions in the
future? A good breeder wants to be available to you through-
out the puppy’s life to ensure all his dogs thrive.
Part I: The Quest for the Perfect Shih Tzu 
40

 If for some reason I ever have to give up the dog, can I
return him to you? If the breeder thinks you have any inten-
tion at the outset of not sticking with the dog through thick
and thin, he probably won’t want to sell you one of his pup-
pies. On the other hand, if unforeseeable circumstances
happen and giving up the dog is a necessity, a good breeder
wants you to bring back the dog instead of taking it to an
animal shelter. The contract often states that you must return
the dog to the breeder if you ever have to give it up.
 What do you do to socialize the puppies? Responsible breed-
ers already have a plan for handling and socializing puppies
from the very beginning of life, to help those pups become
accustomed to gentle human handling.
 How soon do you let puppies go home? Puppies need to stay
with their mother and littermates for at least eight weeks, but
many breeders prefer keeping smaller breeds, including Shih
Tzu, until 12 or even 16 weeks. That’s a sign the breeder cares
(even if you want to take home that puppy now).
 Do you have any questions for me? Responsible breeders
have plenty. You probably won’t even have to ask. (Check out
the “Expect to be grilled” section later in this chapter for
more on what the breeder may ask you.)
Be observant
You can talk to the breeder until you’re blue in the face, but some-
times, a little silent observation is equally informative. When you
visit the breeder, pay attention! This is the time to notice every-
thing you can about the breeder, the home, and the dogs. Do you
get a good feeling from the breeder? Does he or she seem trust-
worthy and forthcoming? Is the home clean and well cared-for?
Are the dogs healthy, friendly, and clean?
If you spot or smell diarrhea or vomit anywhere in the kennel,
don’t just assume the breeder has a problem. Ask about it, or let
the breeder know. Puppies poop a lot, and sometimes they have
stomach distress. Or, maybe an individual dog has a problem and
the breeder already knows about it. But if it looks like the dogs are
generally sickly, excuse yourself politely and move on!
If a breeder only brings you puppies from another room and won’t
let you see where they’re kept, he may have something to hide.
Likewise if you see a mess, poor housing, or a mommy dog with a
bad look or temperament, these conditions are also indications of
poorly raised dogs. Ask about anything you think seems strange or
suspicious. The breeder may not want your germs around the pup-
pies, but you really need to get a feel for the conditions so you can
feel good about the health of the dogs.
Chapter 3: What You Need to Know Before You Buy or Adopt 41

Meet the parents
At the very least, you need to meet the mother of the litter and
preferably the father, too. If the breeder doesn’t have the father —
very often, the father comes from another breeder and lives
elsewhere — ask for pictures or even a video of that dog. The
breeder should be able to show you the father’s pedigree and health
documents, too. You can also ask the breeder for the name and
phone number of the father’s owner to arrange your own visit or at
least a phone conversation (sometimes the father lives far away).
Meeting the parents lets you know how the puppies may grow up
to look and act. If either parent doesn’t look like a Shih Tzu and/or
has a bad temperament, those flags can also indicate a less-than-
ideal situation to avoid.
Expect to be grilled
A hobby breeder spends most of her time gently nurturing puppies
brought into the world but only after careful study, research, and
consideration about how best to improve the breed. Those pup-
pies, softly handled, cooed at, coaxed to accept humans as kind
gentle beings, gently groomed, played with, and adored, are like
children to the caring hobby breeder. Do you really think that she’s
going to let her puppy go to just anybody?
When searching for a reputable hobby breeder, the breeder may
have tons of questions. She isn’t being rude or intrusive by asking.
Her job is to ensure that her beloved little Shih Tzu pups go to only
the very best possible home. The following are the types of ques-
tions you can expect a breeder to ask:
 What’s your dog experience? The breeder wants to know
how many dogs you’ve had in the past, whether any of them
were Shih Tzu or similar breeds (like other toy breeds or
breeds with significant grooming needs), and what happened
to the dogs you had before.
 How familiar are you with the Shih Tzu breed? You want to
be sure the breeder knows her subject, but she wants to be
sure you know yours. Have you looked into the breed before
rushing out to buy?
 Do you have other pets? Shih Tzu get along well with most
other pets, but some other pets won’t get along well with a
Shih Tzu. The breeder wants to make sure the puppy will be
safe, and also that you have enough time, space, and
resources to add a Shih Tzu to your menagerie.
Part I: The Quest for the Perfect Shih Tzu 
42

 Do you have children? Because Shih Tzu puppies are small
and easily injured and because Shih Tzu take a lot of time, the
breeder wants to be sure that the puppy will be safe and that
children in the household know how to handle a small dog.
The breeder also wants to know if you have small children
because parents of very young children don’t usually have
enough time to raise a puppy properly.
Some Shih Tzu breeders won’t sell a puppy to families with
young children. Don’t be offended — the breeder is just doing
what she feels is right for her dogs.
 Where will you keep the dog? Shih Tzu must be kept inside,
and the breeder needs to be sure you’re prepared for this.
 How often are you home? What good is a companion dog to
someone who never needs a companion? The breeder doesn’t
want to send her precious puppies to a house that’s empty.
 Are you willing to do the necessary grooming? The breeder
needs to know that you’re willing to do and/or pay for the
grooming necessary to keep your Shih Tzu puppy healthy and
comfortable. (For more on grooming, see Chapter 10.)
 Do you plan to show the dog? The breeder handles the sale
of a show dog much differently than the sale of a pet dog. The
breeder may want to retain co-ownership (this is fairly
common) and may be willing to mentor you in this competi-
tive and interesting world. If you want to show and potentially
breed a Shih Tzu, the breeder has to make sure that you’re
able to do this the right way, with plenty of knowledge and
guidance, so you aren’t bringing unwanted or unhealthy Shih
Tzu into the world. Otherwise, she’ll prefer you to have a
spayed or neutered pet Shih Tzu instead of a show dog.
 What’s your vet’s name and phone number? Your breeder
should be willing to share her own vet’s name and number
with you, and you need to do the same. Your vet can assure
the breeder that you’re a good pet owner.
Be cautious if a breeder is eager to send a pup home with you as
soon as possible without asking any questions. That’s a sign of a
breeder who may not have the dog’s best interests in mind.
Talk about price and other costs
Buying a Shih Tzu pup from a breeder isn’t cheap. In fact, it can
run on average anywhere from $500 to more than $2000, depending
on the breeder, the dog, and the area of the country.
Chapter 3: What You Need to Know Before You Buy or Adopt 43

Consider not only the price of the dog but also the cost of other
aspects of having a puppy, such as veterinary care, vaccinations,
food, grooming, pet supplies, training classes, and the time you’ll
spend raising, training, caring for, and grooming the dog. Dogs cost
a lot, especially if they have heavy grooming needs (like the Shih
Tzu does) or health problems. Older dogs need more vet care and
often need treatment for age-related diseases, so the costs keep
coming. When visiting the breeder, also ask her about the cost of
registering the puppy with the AKC and how to do that. (For more
on registration and paperwork, see Chapter 4.)
The point of talking about price and other costs is to let the breeder
know that you’re serious and responsible about the financial com-
mitment necessary to take care of your puppy. The breeder wants a
careful and dedicated pet owner.
All these costs may seem a little daunting or more than you
expected, but keep in mind that a pet store dog or a dog from
a commercial breeder is likely to cost on the high end of that
scale at the beginning. (I’ve seen tiny undersized Shih Tzu for
sale on the Internet for more than $3,000!) These dogs potentially
cost more down the road, if they end up with health and behavior
problems.
If you feel comfortable with the breeder and the breeder thinks
you would make a good owner for one of his puppies, ask the
breeder about when you can bring home a puppy. If the breeder
has a litter now, you and the breeder can begin to discuss which
puppy may be best for you (for more about selecting a puppy, see
Chapter 4). Some breeders ask you to return for another visit to
meet the puppies, so they can review your information and check
your references. You can use this time to prepare your home (see
Chapter 6) and check the breeder’s references, too.
Adopting an Older Shih Tzu
You may be excited about getting a Shih Tzu, but you’re not really
into the whole puppy thing (housetraining, accidents on your
living room floor, those little needle teeth, and so on). If so, you
may want to look for an older dog. An older dog is more likely to be
housetrained, used to people, calmer, and even do a few tricks. An
adult Shih Tzu is, in other words, probably more like what you
imagine when you think of a Shih Tzu as a pet.
When adopting an older Shih Tzu, you have two main options: a
Shih Tzu rescue group or an animal shelter. This section takes a
look at your options and helps you navigate the waters.
Part I: The Quest for the Perfect Shih Tzu 
44

Shih Tzu rescue groups
A rescue group is a privately run, volunteer organization that res-
cues animals and finds new homes for them. They often specialize
in a particular breed, and work with animal shelters who call them
if a dog of that breed comes into the shelter. They pick up the dog,
put him into a foster home, evaluate him, and work to find him a
new, permanent home. Rescue groups like to call this new home
the dog’s forever home, because they work hard to be sure they
don’t place a dog with someone who’ll just give the dog up again.
Many rescue groups raise money, and often the individuals use
their own money, to give the rescued pets medical care, to spay or
neuter them, and even to put them through basic obedience train-
ing, to make sure they’re adoptable and successful as pets.
For the right owner, these Shih Tzu can be perfection. There are
benefits to rescuing an older dog:
 Many dogs are already housetrained and have learned how to
behave in the house.
 They get along with kids and other pets, or the rescue workers
know if they don’t because the dogs are carefully evaluated.
 These dogs often know simple cues like Sit and Stay.
 Many pet owners say their dogs seem to know they were res-
cued and have a particularly strong bond with their new
owners.
 You know how the dog looks and acts because he’s already
fully grown. Because rescue workers have screened the dog,
you’ll also get a lot of info from them, and from the dog’s
foster parents, about what it is like to live with the individual
dog, and that can help you make the right choice.
Finding a rescue group
You may be wondering where you can find a rescue group in your
area. Here are a few places to help you get started. (For more gen-
eral info, check out my book, Adopting a Pet For Dummies [Wiley].)
The last three give you lists of rescue groups as well as animal
shelters near you:
 ASTC: They have a rescue committee with many members all
over the country. Check them out online at www.shihtzu.org/
ASTC/rescue.asp?menu=ASTC.
 PetFinder: This source is my favorite Internet resource for
finding adoptable pets. The user-friendly Web site allows you
Chapter 3: What You Need to Know Before You Buy or Adopt 45

to select any kind of animal and breed and enter your zip
code to get a list of all currently adoptable animals near you.
Their database is huge and comprehensive. Find them at www.
petfinder.com.
 The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals (ASPCA): The ASPCA has a great Web site
(www.aspca.org) with tons of info about adopting pets, and a
search engine to find rescue groups and shelters near you.
 Pets911: Another good Web site for searching locally or
regionally is Pets911, a group that’s partnered with the
Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) to provide local
shelter information. Go online to www.pets911.com.
Adopting a rescued Shih Tzu
Even though the policies and procedures may vary from one organ-
ization to another, the process for adopting a rescued dog is usu-
ally about the same. Here’s what to expect:
1. You complete an application.
You fill out an application and specify if you have a particu-
lar dog that interests you, or if you’re looking for a dog in
general. Rescue groups are extra picky about who they
allow to adopt a dog, because they want to make
absolutely sure you won’t give up the dog and are willing
and able to keep the dog for the rest of his life. Expect to
supply a lot of info about you, your home, your schedule,
your family members, your other pets, your financial
resources, how much time you have for the dog, your pet
experience, and references.
2. The rescue group interviews you and visits you.
Expect questions about your application and a home visit,
so the rescue workers can see that the info on your appli-
cation is true, and that you live in a suitable environment.
The rescue workers want to meet everyone in your family.
3. You wait to see if you’re approved.
If you’re approved, you get to visit some dogs or spend
time with the dog you want to adopt. If you aren’t
approved, don’t be offended. (See the sidebar in this chap-
ter, “Why did they turn me down?”)
4. You bring home your new pet.
After all the questions, visits, and paperwork, you finally
get to bring home your new rescued pet. Congratulations!
You’ve done a good deed, and you’ll be richly rewarded.

Animal shelters
Shelters are often city- or county-run facilities that take in many ani-
mals, and they’re another great way to adopt an older Shih Tzu. Of
course shelters have all types of dogs, but if you’re diligent, you
never know when a Shih Tzu may show up.
In many cases, shelters work with purebred rescue groups (see the
previous section) and shuttle any purebreds directly to them. If
you’re really keen on a purebred Shih Tzu, start with a rescue
group. However, if you’re open to the idea of a Shih Tzu mix (a dog
that’s part Shih Tzu, part something else), a shelter may be exactly
the right place for you. Get to know the shelter workers, or even
volunteer at the shelter, and you’ll be among the first to know if a
Shih Tzu or Shih Tzu mix comes through the door.
Chapter 3: What You Need to Know Before You Buy or Adopt 47
Why did they turn me down?
Some people with great intentions try to adopt a dog from a rescue group or shel-
ter, and the rescue group or shelter says: Sorry, but no. Huh? Aren’t you trying to do
a good deed? Don’t the dogs need homes? Why won’t they give you one?
Rescue and shelter workers have seen a lot of very sad situations, dogs coming
back again and again, and plenty of irresponsible and tragic human behavior. They
want to make very sure that if they let you adopt a dog, you’ll keep that dog for life.
They may have turned you down for a number of reasons, such as you don’t have a
good place to keep the dog, you aren’t home very much, you have a lot of other pets,
or they get the impression you aren’t responsible in some way. If you rent, they’ll
need a letter from your landlord saying it’s okay for you to have a dog. If you have
small children or other pets, they may know the dog you want doesn’t do well with
children or other pets. If you’re a student, the rescue group may not let you adopt a
dog because so many students abandon their pets at the end of the semester.
The bottom line is if a rescue group or shelter turns you down, there’s probably a
good reason. Ask the workers what the reason(s) is, and then either fix the problem
or wait awhile to adopt a dog. They may be right that you aren’t ready for a dog yet,
or aren’t suited to a rescued or shelter dog. The rescue or shelter workers aren’t
trying to be nasty, so don’t take it personally. They really are doing what they believe
is best for the dogs they care so much about.

If you do decide to adopt from an animal shelter, consider these
points:
 Adopting a shelter Shih Tzu can bring you joy, but it also
comes with its challenges. You may need to start back at
square one with housetraining, socialization, and trust.
 You may have limited info about the dog. You won’t know
for sure how your dog has been treated in the past or if he’s
had any medical issues. Shelter workers can often help you
decipher the clues, but many shelters don’t have the time or
resources to evaluate every detail about every dog. You and
your Shih Tzu may have some things to work out.
 The shelter must approve you for adoption. Most shelters
require lengthy application forms because the shelter wants
to make sure the dog doesn’t wind up right back in the shelter
when you find you aren’t able to handle the situation. If the
shelter turns you down, see the sidebar, earlier in this chapter,
“Why did they turn me down?”
 Shelters are affordable. Adopting a dog at a shelter usually
runs around $25 to $200, a lot less than the cost of buying a
purebred Shih Tzu. However, remember that because you don’t
know the dog’s history, you may end up spending plenty at the
vet and/or for training, to fix health and behavior problems.
Also, an adopted shelter dog still costs the same as any other
Shih Tzu for food, supplies, and grooming.
Shih Tzu want nothing more than your love and trust, and they’re
adaptable little dogs, so treat your new Shih Tzu, no matter his
age, as a puppy. He can learn everything from you, including trust,
and you’ll be off to a great start.

I
f you’ve found the breeder or the rescue group of your dreams
(if not, check out Chapter 3), now you may find you’re faced
with the cutest, fuzziest bunch of Shih Tzu puppies you’ve ever
seen. Which one is yours? Or, maybe you’re on a waiting list for a
litter to be born, or you have a list of adoptable rescued Shih Tzu
to consider. How do you choose?
Every puppy, like every person, is a little bit different — a unique
combination of genetics, environment, and personality. Some dogs
may clearly be unhealthy or overly shy or have other qualities that
don’t make for a good pet, but most often, especially after you’ve
found a great breeder, all the puppies look pretty darned charming.
This chapter helps you narrow down which puppy really is best for
you. From trusting chemistry (you just know that’s the one) to tap-
ping the breeder’s wisdom to filling out the final paperwork, I help
you close the deal so you can finally bring home your dog.
Basic Questions to Ask Before
You Start Looking
Step away from the litter! That’s right, you heard me. Before you
even look at, or especially touch, those fuzzy little puppies, you need
to make some rational decisions. After you pick up a puppy, you’re

going to fall in love, and objectivity flies right out the window. At this
moment, use your head. Before you select the right dog, you want to
ask yourself a few important questions.
This section highlights some of the more important questions
to ask. Furthermore, you need to remember a few important
considerations, such as the dog’s health, temperament, and
personality (check out “Beginning the Inspection: What to Look
For” later in this chapter for more info on health, temperament,
and personality).
Puppy, teenager, or grown-up?
When choosing a new Shih Tzu, your dog’s color and gender may
be somewhat important to you. However, what age do you want?
This question is most important because getting a puppy is a lot
different than getting an adolescent or a senior dog. Read on for
some important considerations.
Puppy love
People often automatically want a puppy. However, bringing home
a puppy involves a lot of responsibility, work, and expense. With a
puppy, you have to think about the following:
 Housetraining and obedience training: Although puppies are
cute, they know next to nothing about living in a human house-
hold. How are they supposed to guess that the carpet isn’t a
bathroom and your bunny slippers aren’t chew toys? Puppies
need a lot of training and patience. Are you willing to put in the
necessary time and stay calm when she has another accident?
 Size: Shih Tzu puppies are tiny, and although they can be
tougher than some toy breeds, they can also easily be injured
by a rough child, another dog, or a misstep. You need to keep
their protection in mind at all times.
 Socialization: Puppies don’t know much about other people,
other dogs, and new places, and the wrong kind of exposure
to the world can turn into behavioral problems such as fear,
anxiety, or even aggression. Having a puppy means taking on
the responsibility to socialize the dog so he grows up well-
adjusted. (For more on socializing a Shih Tzu, see Chapter 11.)
 Energy: Shih Tzu are relatively calm, but all puppies have
energy to spare. If you get tired just thinking about wild puppy
antics, maybe a puppy isn’t the best choice for you.
Part I: The Quest for the Perfect Shih Tzu 
50

Thinking of a teenager
Adolescent Shih Tzu — those teenaged years from about 9 to 18
months — have some benefits (and some disadvantages) when
you compare them to a puppy. If you have the opportunity to bring
home a Shih Tzu teen, don’t forget these important traits:
 Adolescents can have an attitude, but it doesn’t last long. By
the time your Shih Tzu reaches 2 years old, she should be
calm and sweet again just like when your teenager turns 20!
 Adolescents may need training just like puppies, but they
often learn faster, too. They may challenge you to make sure
that you really mean what you say about all those silly human
rules, but they have better concentration. Furthermore, they’re
probably housetrained or can learn more quickly than a puppy.
 Adolescents may already be well trained. Depending on the
dog’s past, you may get a Shih Tzu who already knows all
about humans and even knows basic cues like Sit and Come.
That makes your job a lot easier. In fact, sometimes you can
get adolescents from good breeders who reserved a puppy
they thought would be a good show dog but who turned out
to have some faults that would be incidental to a pet owner.
Having gone through puppyhood with a Shih Tzu expert,
these dogs are usually well mannered, well trained, and well
groomed. They just need someone to make them the center of
their universe. That could be you!
 Adolescents bond easily to their new owners. Shih Tzu adapt
well to new situations and loving people, so even if you adopt
a dog who’s no longer a puppy, your teen should quickly bond
to you, as if you’ve known each other forever.
 Adolescents need a lot of grooming. During adolescence, the
puppy coat sheds, and the adult coat grows in and needs a lot
of maintenance. If the adult coat hasn’t quite grown in, you
may bring home your new dog just when the puppy coat is
falling out. This time period requires some tough, high-mainte-
nance grooming. You need to brush and comb the shedding
coat every day or you’ll end up with a seriously tangled dog.
Contemplating an adult dog
Adult and senior Shih Tzu sometimes lose their homes through no
fault of their own, and you can adopt them from shelters or rescue
groups. Some adults are raised by show breeders, ready to retire
after a successful career and spend their golden years being pam-
pered in a pet home. Either way, older Shih Tzu can be absolutely
delightful with a lot of good years left. Don’t discount this wonderful
option.
Chapter 4: “I Want That One!”: Finding Your Shih Tzu 51

Peruse the following list when deciding whether an adult dog is
right for you:
 Adults may already be well trained and used to life in a pet
home. Adult Shih Tzu may need little, if any, training, so no
worries about having to housetrain or teach them what not
to do.
 Adults are usually accustomed to grooming and are well
socialized. Adult dogs know the ins and outs of grooming.
They also typically get along well with children and other
pets, if they’ve been raised with them.
 Adults bond easily to new loving owners. Sure, they may take
a short while to adjust to a new home, but with patience, plenty
of love, and good care, adult Shih Tzu can quickly bond to you.
An older Shih Tzu just wants a warm lap and pampering.

To show or not to show: 
That is the question
So you have an adorable, beautiful Shih Tzu. Do you want to just snuggle him all
day, or are you contemplating entering him in the exciting and glamorous show dog
arena? Well, showing dogs can be a fun and interesting (and expensive) hobby, but
deciding whether to show your dog can be a complicated question involving you, the
breeder, and your dog.
Whether you want a show dog makes a big difference in which puppy to pick. The
breeder can help you select a pup with good show potential, but even then, she may
grow up to have some physical trait that will keep her from doing well in the ring. You
won’t know for sure until she’s a little older. Also, the original purpose for showing
dogs was to evaluate breeding stock, so keep in mind that if your dog competes,
you can’t have your Shih Tzu spayed or neutered. (Check out Chapter 12 for the
importance of spaying and neutering.)
Also, most people in dog shows are committed dog breeders (or their hired profes-
sional handlers) looking to perfect the breed. The breeder may want to retain co-
ownership of a good show prospect. Talk to your breeder and other breeders, visit
dog shows, look into professional handlers, and do your research before you choose
a puppy and before you decide to go this route. Then, if you still love the idea and
you have the time and money to commit, let an experienced show breeder guide
you in finding the right dog and discovering how to show. Also check out the
American Kennel Club’s (AKC) helpful Web page on dog showing for beginners:
www.akc.org/events/conformation/beginners.cfm.

 Senior dogs (8 to 10 years or older) can be particularly calm,
sweet, and companionable. Just because a Shih Tzu slows
down a bit in old age doesn’t make him less of a good friend.
 Rescuing an older Shih Tzu who needs a new home can be a
deeply rewarding experience for both you and the dog.
Many people report that the adult or senior dogs they’ve
adopted turned out to be the best pets they’ve ever had.
Do you want a male or a female?
In many ways, gender doesn’t matter when it comes to Shih Tzu.
Experienced Shih Tzu folks may tell you that some subtle differ-
ences exist between the sexes, but the individual health and tem-
perament of the dog is more important (see “Beginning the
Inspection: What to Look For” later in this chapter).
First and foremost, before you select a dog based on gender, talk to
the breeder about individual personalities of the puppies.
Personality trumps gender any day of the week. But some general
differences do exist. Not every Shih Tzu fits into these stereotypes,
but you could say that when it comes to Lola (or, the girls) and
Samson (or, the boys), Table 4-1 sums it up.

with him.
These points are merely generalizations! Plus, the differences
between boys and girls may be more pronounced in dogs who
aren’t spayed and neutered, and as a pet owner, you’re certainly
planning on spaying or neutering your pet, right? (For more info
on why these procedures are so important, see Chapter 12.) Your
Lola may be the sweetest, most lap-doggy dog in all of creation.
Your Sampson may be a little firecracker and a whiz at agility, with
a big dose of attitude. It’s really about the individual.
Do you care about color?
Some people think all Shih Tzu are gold and white because that’s
the most popular color, but Shih Tzu actually come in many differ-
ent colors, such as black, red, liver, blue, silver, gold, and white.
They also come in patterns, like bi-colored (black and white),
masked (gold with black mask), or brindled (striped). Gold and
white Shih Tzu with black tips may be easiest to find right now
because it’s currently the most popular color, but it certainly isn’t
your only option. You can see how all these different colors look
on a Shih Tzu at www.shihtzu.org/Info/colors.asp.
Color does not affect personality or structure. That jet-black Shih
Tzu should be indistinguishable from that gold-and-white Shih Tzu
when the lights are out. You may believe a particular color is beau-
tiful, but health and temperament are much more important.
Beginning the Inspection:
What to Look For
Having a picture in your mind or an idea of the type of dog you
want is one thing. Getting down on your hands and knees and
Part I: The Quest for the Perfect Shih Tzu 
54

really looking at the actual puppies to determine which one is right
for you is a totally different matter. If you’re ready to begin your
inspection of a litter (or of a couple dogs at a rescue shelter), now
it’s time to get down on your hands and knees.
If you’re seriously looking for a puppy, please keep this important
point in mind: The worst possible time to buy a new puppy is at
Christmas or around the holidays where large numbers of people
are around and when there’s a great deal of activity. The puppy
needs time to adjust to his new surroundings.
This section helps you evaluate the dog’s health, determine the
dog’s temperament, and check to see if you and the dog have good
old-fashioned chemistry. Most importantly, get the breeder’s or
rescue person’s input on which pup may work best for your per-
sonality, family, and lifestyle.
Checking the dog’s health
Naturally, you want a healthy puppy or dog, and you need to look
for certain signs when picking out your pooch. When you examine
the puppy, pick him up carefully (with the breeder’s permission),
pet him, lift his fur, and check for the following:
 Bright, shiny eyes with no discharge
 Clean, sharp, white teeth
 Sweet smelling breath with no sour or foul smell, which could
indicate a poor diet or an oral infection
 Clean, soft fluffy coat with no mats, tangles, or bare patches
 Soft clean nose and clean ears with no discharge, redness, or
swelling.
 Clean rear-end with no dirt, oozing, redness, swelling, rashes,
discharge, feces stuck in the fur, or bugs
 Neat, clean feet with short nails and firm soft paw pads
 Clean skin with no red patches, rashes, wounds, fleas, ticks,
or lumps
After you select your dog, take your Shih Tzu to the vet, right after
you take possession, for an expert opinion (check out Chapter 12
for more info about a visit to the vet). Your health guarantee
should state that if the vet finds a problem that you can return the
dog. (For more on health guarantees, see the last section of this
chapter.)
Chapter 4: “I Want That One!”: Finding Your Shih Tzu 55

Some less-than-ethical breeders may try to sell you a puppy for a
discount that isn’t doing as well as the others. You’ll more than
make up for that so-called bargain in future vet bills and heartache!
Some puppies in pet stores may also be in less-than-glowing
health, and the pet store employees may not know enough about
dog health to know they shouldn’t sell you that dog. Even a Shih
Tzu from a shelter or rescue group can have health issues that
nobody knows about or mentions to you. That’s why you need to
pay attention and look carefully for signs of good health.
Evaluating for temperament
A healthy looking puppy is important, but temperament matters,
too. Evaluating temperament can be tricky because much of tem-
perament is learned and comes out later depending on how you
raise the puppy. However, some aspects of temperament are
inherited.
Some books give you specific temperament tests to try on dogs,
but I’m not a big advocate of these for Shih Tzu. They can be too
rough for the naturally trusting Shih Tzu. Instead, find a good
breeder or rescue group (see Chapter 3) to advise you, and pay
attention to how the dog acts when you meet him. The following
questions may help.
How does the dog relate to other dogs within a group?
You can discover a lot by watching how he acts around his litter-
mates. Does he jump on the others and wrestle or stay back and
watch? The breeder knows the litter best and can point you to the
most active and the most mellow pups in the whelping box. (See
“Tapping the wisdom of the experts” later in the chapter.)
Part I: The Quest for the Perfect Shih Tzu 
56
Rescuing a sick puppy
Trying to rescue a sick puppy can be incredibly tempting. He looks so helpless
and adorable. However, be aware that even with treatment, many sick puppies —
especially small breeds — don’t make it. If the pup has a contagious disease like
Parvo and you have other pets, bringing that puppy home can put your other pets
at risk. If you still insist on bringing home a sick pet to save, such as a rescued or
shelter animal that needs special medical care, a health evaluation by a vet lets you
know what you’re getting yourself into.

If you’re looking at a rescued or shelter dog, how does the dog
respond to animals in the environment? Dogs that seem interested
or playfully interactive should get along well with other friendly
pets. Those who shy away or try to attack may have some issues
with other pets. These Shih Tzu may do fine in a home without other
pets, but you’ll have to be responsible for future animal interactions.
How do you relate to the dog?
As you survey the possible dogs, ask yourself a few questions to
figure out what dog is right for you:
 Do you like a spunky or serene Shih Tzu?
 Do you like a dog who wants to be on you or in your arms all
the time, or do you prefer a little more independence?
 Which puppy seems most like the dog you imagine living with
for the next 12 to 18 years?
 Which puppy seems most interested in you?
How do the parents behave?
You should be able to meet at least one of the parents. In many
cases, the father of the litter (breeders call him the sire) lives
somewhere else and came to visit during courtship as part of a
planned breeding. But the mother (the dam) should be right there
with the breeder, nurturing the puppies. What’s she like? If she’s
sweet, friendly, curious, and trusting, she’s probably passed down
the potential for these traits to her pups. If she’s nippy, nervous,
excitable, or fearful, she may have passed on those qualities, too.
If you can’t see the sire, ask to see pictures, and ask the breeder
for the phone number of the person who owns the father. Give that
person a call to ask about the father’s personality. Even if you can’t
meet him in person, you may get further assurance that the
mother’s good temperament is complemented by the father’s.
In the case of rescued dogs, you won’t get to see the parents, so you
have to rely on other measures of temperament, such as seeing how
the dog relates to his environment and the people who care for him,
as well as the way he relates to you. The foster parents or shelter
workers can tell you a lot, too. As with many aspects of rescued
dogs, you take a slight risk. However, because the environment
determines a lot of the temperament and because Shih Tzu are
naturally sweet, loving, and trusting, chances are you’ll be okay.
How does the dog interact with you?
You can tell things about a puppy’s natural temperament by inter-
acting with the puppy. All the puppies should be basically curious,
Chapter 4: “I Want That One!”: Finding Your Shih Tzu 57

energetic, and interested in you and shouldn’t cower or shy away
from your hands. Follow these easy steps to determine how the
dog interacts with you.
1. Take the dog into a safe, familiar place but away from her
mother, littermates, or other household pets.
2. Hold her while sitting down, pet her, and play with her.
If she seems interested in you and interactive, that’s a great
sign. If she seems afraid of you or shies away from your
hand, you may be dealing with a dog that has a tempera-
ment problem and takes much longer to train and socialize.
Tapping the wisdom of the experts
Nobody knows the puppies like the breeder, who has, ideally, been
handling and interacting with the puppies every day since they
were born. If you find a Shih Tzu through a shelter or rescue group,
the volunteers for the group can also give you a good idea of the
personality characteristics of that dog.
Ask the breeder, shelter, or rescue worker the following types of
questions tailored toward your needs to help narrow your choice:
 What is this dog’s personality? If you want a more outgoing
pup, a mellower pup, or something in between, tell the
breeder, who can probably point out the exact dog for you.
 Has the dog been introduced to children? Rescue groups
and shelter workers may have firsthand experience regarding
the dog’s compatibility with other pets and/or children.
Breeders with kids can give you a thumbs-up on this one, too.
 Has the dog been introduced to any other animals? Some
dogs love other animals. Some don’t get along with them at all.
Most Shih Tzu find other pets interesting, but just in case, ask.
 I really like this puppy (or dog). From what you know of her,
would this one be a good match? If you really just love a par-
ticular pup or dog, ask. Unless the breeder, shelter worker, or
rescue group knows a good reason why the match wouldn’t be
made in heaven, you may get the thumbs-up, with a blessing.
If you spend time talking to the breeder (or the rescue or shelter
worker), he can get to know you better and can be in an even
better position to match you up with the dog of your dreams.
The better he knows you, the better he can help you.
Part I: The Quest for the Perfect Shih Tzu 
58

Chemistry and intuition: Letting
the dog choose you
Sometimes, one particular dog just speaks to you — and I don’t
mean by barking. You look at a dog, he looks at you, and sparks fly.
But listen to the experts. If a breeder or rescue worker has strong
objections to the match, you should probably listen. If a dog is
very shy and you want to bring him home to a big, loud family with
other pets and young children, you’re probably dizzy and irrational
due to the cute-fuzzy-puppy factor. But if the breeder or rescue
worker thinks you would be a good match, then listen to your own
intuition. You may have just found the one.
Dealing with the Paperwork
Petting and playing with puppies is fun, but it isn’t the only part of
buying a dog. Yes, you inevitably have to deal with the red tape.
Legally you are making a purchase, so you should research getting
your new dog like you would purchasing a car or home, making
sure that everything is in order before you sign on the dotted line.
And yes, you’ll be asked to sign.
Even if you’re adopting a dog from a shelter, you still have paper-
work and a lot of it. This section looks at all the paperwork and
helps you understand what it means and how it protects you, the
breeder, the shelter or rescue group, and of course, the Shih Tzu.
Sign on the dotted line: Contracts
You probably won’t have to sign a contract if you take a puppy from
your neighbor’s litter of Shih Tzu, but if you buy a puppy from a
breeder or a pet store, or if you adopt a dog from a shelter or rescue
group, you may be required to sign a contract. Don’t worry. Signing a
contract is good because it protects both you and the seller.
The trick is to make sure that all the info you need, including your
protections, are spelled out clearly in the contract. The contract
typically contains the following:
 The breeder’s (or the shelter or rescue group’s) contact info:
This info includes the name, address, phone number, and
e-mail address (if she has one).
 The parents’ info: This info includes the complete names of the
sire and dam, their registration numbers, their dates of birth,
Chapter 4: “I Want That One!”: Finding Your Shih Tzu 59

sex, and of course the breed, if the puppy comes from a
breeder.
 Breeder requirements regarding the puppy, in the case of a
purchase from a breeder: If the breeder doesn’t think the
puppy should be bred or shown in dog shows, she may
require you to have the puppy spayed or neutered. The con-
tract may state that you may register the puppy on a limited
registration only, which means the dog is a registered purebred
dog, but can’t be bred. If the breeder is selling you a show
prospect, then the breeder will probably require, in writing,
that you register the dog with an organization like the AKC,
and may want his kennel name as part of the puppy’s name or
may even want to retain co-ownership. Ask the breeder to
explain any conditions like these to your satisfaction.
 The purchase or adoption price: All fees should be explained.
 A health guarantee: Check out the next section for more info
on health guarantees and what they cover.
 All health information: Any vaccinations that the dog has
received and any other info on veterinary visits, tests, or
other procedures, such as if the dog has already been spayed
or neutered, should be included. The contract may also stipu-
late what veterinary visits and vaccinations you’re required to
have done after taking possession of the dog.
 A spay/neuter agreement: Many breeders and virtually all
shelters and rescue groups require that you have your dog
spayed or neutered. Some give you a voucher to have this
procedure done at a reduced rate or even free. Some breeders
won’t release registration papers until you come back with
proof of this procedure. When they say to have your dog
spayed or neutered in writing, they mean it. (For the many rea-
sons why it’s important, see Chapter 12.)
 A clause that you must return the dog if you aren’t able to
keep the dog: Good breeders and diligent rescue workers
always want to know where every single puppy they’ve
brought into the world is at all times, and they don’t ever want
their precious pups to end up in a shelter or in a bad home.
Some rescue groups may stipulate, as part of the contract, that
you promise never to give up the dog to anyone else, no matter
what (a tough promise, but one rescue groups take seriously).
If you don’t find some of the previous items in your contract, you
can ask that they be added. Your contract may contain other info,
too. But whatever you do, make sure to read the document carefully
and understand everything it says before you sign on the dotted
line.

Put your mind at ease: 
Health guarantees
Health guarantees are a part of the contract that protects the dog,
you, and the breeder in case the dog develops a health problem.
This documentation is essential and yet a misunderstood part of
the red tape involved in buying or adopting a dog. Sometimes a
dog gets sick or develops a genetic problem, and you can’t blame
anybody. Even if the breeder does everything possible to ensure
good health in his puppies, health problems can happen.
If the vet finds a problem in a new puppy or newly adopted dog,
you should have the legal right, as stated in your health guarantee
or contract, to return the dog for a refund or a replacement. But if
the dog gets sick later, at some point the care and treatment is your
responsibility, not the breeder’s or anyone else’s. That’s just part
of pet ownership. The health guarantee should specifically state
where the breeder’s, shelter’s or rescue group’s (or pet shop’s)
responsibility ends, and where yours begins. Be sure you under-
stand this before agreeing to purchase or adopt the dog!
Some people feel shocked and betrayed when a dog gets sick. “But
I had a health guarantee!” they often say to the vet. Unfortunately,
a health guarantee doesn’t and can’t guarantee good health. The
breeder does her part to maximize the possibility for good health,
and you do your part to promise to care for your pet if it gets sick.
Whether or not the breeder promises (in a contract) to help you
with health problems, always tell the breeder if your Shih Tzu
develops a health problem. This info is valuable for a breeder
working to produce healthy dogs. If the breeder never knows your
dog ended up with luxating patellas or liver disease (genetic issues
in Shih Tzu which you can find out more about in Chapter 13), he
can’t use that info for making smarter breeding decisions next
time. Consider it your duty to all future Shih Tzu.
The proof is in the pudding:
Registration papers
Registering your purebred Shih Tzu means your dog is on record as
being a purebred with an official pedigree. This pedigree is required
for show dogs but optional for pets. Many pet owners like to do it
just for the fun and prestige of having a registered purebred.
If you buy a purebred dog, the breeder should give you all the nec-
essary paperwork on the day you bring home the dog to send to the
Chapter 4: “I Want That One!”: Finding Your Shih Tzu 61

AKC — or other registry, depending on the breeder — to register
your dog. A good breeder always gives this paperwork to you and
explains what to do, unless she wants proof that you have spayed
or neutered the dog first. That’s the only valid excuse to delay
giving you the registration papers.
If you think snail mail is so 20th century, you can register your dog
online at www.akc.org. Click Registrations and then Register a Dog
Online. This option is convenient, but you’ll need your credit card.
Basic registration costs $15.
Some breeders may sell you a puppy on limited registration only,
which means the puppy is pet quality and not for breeding. The con-
tract states that you should have the puppy spayed or neutered, and
then you can register the dog. This kind of registration allows for a
purebred dog to be registered while ensuring that you won’t breed
puppies indiscriminately. Good breeders often insist on it.
Tend to your Shih Tzu: Care info
Both breeders and rescue groups typically send home other info,
too. This paperwork may involve care, vet, grooming, socializing,
and training info. If the info isn’t already in the contract, the care
info may include some or all of the following:
 What food the dog’s been eating (you may even get a sample
to take home; see Chapter 9 for what to feed your Shih Tzu)
 What to do if you want to switch foods (see Chapter 9)
 A recommended supply list (check out Chapter 5)
 Puppy-proofing information (refer to Chapter 6)
 Grooming information (look in Chapter 10)
 Housetraining information (see Chapter 16)
Future guidance from the breeder:
Get those digits!
A good breeder provides follow-up support, and a good rescue
group is willing and happy to help with any problems, too. Make
sure that you get the thumbs-up about calling with questions and
problems (and cute stories and holiday cards) before you leave the
breeder, shelter, or rescue worker. Get a full name, address, phone
number, and e-mail contact, if available. You’re now a team, along
with your vet and groomer — all of you work together to keep your
new Shih Tzu healthy, happy, and loved for the rest of his life.

Opening Your Home
to Your Shih Tzu

In this part . . . 
You’ve done it! You’ve really done it. You’ve brought
home a new Shih Tzu. Now what? This part helps you
prepare your home and give you the lists of supplies you
need (check out Chapter 5). In Chapter 6, you discover the
art of Shih-Tzu-prooﬁng your home, so your new dog stays
safe and comfortable. In Chapter 7, you can ﬁnd info about
bringing your dog home safely from the breeder and intro-
ducing him to your family.
In this part, you also ﬁgure out how to schedule a vet visit
and introduce your new Shih Tzu to your family and other
pets in a safe and friendly way. Chapter 8 helps you with
those ﬁrst few days in establishing a solid routine, so your
Shih Tzu knows exactly what to expect.

Chapter 5
Stocking Up: What Every
Shih Tzu Needs
In This Chapter
 Identifying the right pet supplies
 Finding the fancy stuff
You can’t wait to bring home your new dog, but before you do,
you should do a little shopping. And if you like to shop, this
chapter is for you! Your Shih Tzu needs some stuff (just like any
new baby would) and you — the responsible pet owner — have to
get what your baby needs.
You may feel like I’ve listed a lot of stuff in this chapter, but you
don’t need all of it. I clarify which items are non-negotiable and
which are pure luxury and up to your discretion (and the level of
pampering, spoiling, and coddling you plan to do).
Eyeing the Necessary Supplies
Whether you like to shop or not (you can always order stuff off the
Internet — I give you some good sources later in this chapter),
the tricky part is knowing what to shop for. The next sections fill
you in on everything from food to bedding, grooming tools to toys,
and the fancy stuff like hair accessories and party dresses. (Yes, I
said party dresses. Don’t worry, Samson, they make doggy tuxe-
does, too.)
The right food
First and foremost on your list should be a good-quality dog food.
Forget that cheap junk-food kibble. Toy dogs don’t eat much and
every bite counts, so you want a premium food with high quality

Part II: Opening Your Home to Your Shih Tzu 
66
meat (not by-products) listed first on the ingredients label and
preferably a few other meat sources in the first five ingredients.
(For more on choosing the right food and other nutritional con-
cerns, see Chapter 9.)
Fortunately, the best food is also the best deal, even if the price tag
doesn’t look that way. Cheap food may cost less up-front, but the
problems the food can cause cost more down the line, and a good
quality food makes cleaning up after your Shih Tzu easier, because
good food going in comes out the other end smaller, more com-
pact, and less stinky.
Your local grocery stores and discount stores carry dog food, but
the really good, premium brands are usually only available at a pet
store or vet. Find the store near you specializing in quality pet
food, or ask your vet what brand she recommends. You may also
find a good brand in your local health food store, particularly if
you want to feed your pet organic food or a raw diet.
The right dinnerware
No need to spend a lot of money on a fancy artistically sculptured
set of food and water bowls, unless you love the way they look.
Your dog won’t care. A few things do matter when choosing food
and water bowls:
 Make sure bowls offer plenty of room for your Shih Tzu to
get his mouth to the food and water. Shih Tzu have hairy
faces so they tend to get food and water all over themselves
and the floor.
 Consider keeping a placemat or some other washable mat
under the food and water bowls to make clean up easier.
For water, consider a bottle instead of a bowl.
When choosing food and water bowls, also consider the following:
 Size: Remember that Samson is a little dog, so a small- to
medium-sized dish is fine for his food. Buy a deeper bowl for
his water, if you aren’t using a water bottle, so you don’t have
to refill it as often. But don’t just top it off — at least daily,
dump the water, rinse the bowl, and refill.
 Type: Bowls come in three main types (ceramic, plastic, or
stainless steel), and you can offer water in a bottle. Each
option has its advantages and disadvantages:

• Stainless steel: They’re the sturdiest and easiest to
clean. They don’t break when you drop them, and your
dog won’t chew on them.
• Ceramic: These bowls are sturdy and easy to clean. You
can even customize a bowl with your dog’s name.
However, ceramic is heavier (don’t drop it on Lola’s toes
or your own), and it breaks easily.
Stay clear of ceramic bowls made outside of the United
States. The bowl’s glazing may contain lead.
• Plastic: You can find a wide assortment of colors and
sizes, and they’re inexpensive, but I don’t recommend
these. They scratch easily and harbor bacteria. They’re
also lightweight, so they can skid across the floor as
your dog’s trying to eat his food.
Grooming supplies
Other than training (if you choose to do this) and spending time
together, you may spend more time grooming your Shih Tzu
than doing any other aspect of his care. To groom, you need the
right supplies. Chapter 10 gives you a lot more info about these
grooming tools, but your basic shopping list should include a few
necessities:
Chapter 5: Stocking Up: What Every Shih Tzu Needs 67
Water bottles for small dogs
Some Shih Tzu owners train their dogs to drink
from water bottles, much like the ones hamsters
and gerbils drink out of, only larger. (See the
photo at right.) Shih Tzu are easily trained by
rubbing a small amount of chicken or beef baby
food on the nozzle. Water bottles keep Shih Tzu
faces dry and clean, and eliminate splashes on
the floor, too. Also, the water stays cleaner.
These bottles come with a bracket for installa-
tion in a crate or near the food bowl. You can
purchase water bottles for small dogs from ven-
dors at dog shows, dog product catalogues,
online, or in pet stores.

 Pin brush
 Natural bristle brush
 Steel comb
 Mat splitter, grooming scissors, and electric clipper
 Dog shampoo
 Dog crème rinse
 Spray conditioner
 Moisturizing eye drops (if your vet recommends them)
 Tear stain remover
 Toothpaste and toothbrush made for dogs
 Nail clippers made for dogs
 Bows, barrettes, and other hair accessories (optional but fun)
Kennels and crates
Some people object to the idea of keeping their Shih Tzu in a kennel
or crate, but to your Shih Tzu, this little den is a safe spot where
nobody can bother him. The crate also acts as a place to travel, to
sleep, and to escape from people or other pets when your dog just
isn’t in the mood. This valuable haven also helps you housetrain
your Shih Tzu (see Chapter 16 for more info on housetraining).
You can find crates and kennels in any pet store or online, and they
can range quite a bit in price depending on how basic or fancy you
get and what brand you choose. The most important consideration
is that your Shih Tzu should be able to stand up, lie down, and turn
around easily inside the crate, but it shouldn’t be so big that your
Shih Tzu is tempted to use one end as a bathroom and the other
as a bed.
You can choose between two types of crates:
 Plastic crates: This type is good for feeling secure because the
sides are solid and perfect for traveling in the car or by air,
but they have vented sides so your dog can breathe. Check
out Figure 5-1. Some fancy versions even look nice in your
home.
 Wire crates: Wire crates allow your Shih Tzu to see every-
thing but don’t feel as comfortable and cave-like. You can fix
that, though, by draping a blanket over the wire, leaving only
the front end exposed.
Part II: Opening Your Home to Your Shih Tzu 
68

Either way, line the crate with soft bedding (see more information
about this in the next section).
Figure 5-1: Your Shih Tzu feels safe in his kennel.
Bedding for a good night’s sleep
Your Shih Tzu may sleep in bed with you, in her kennel, or in a
fancy dog bed, but whether your dog sleeps in that kennel or not,
you need to place soft bedding in the crate for when your dog does
go inside for a nap, a rest, or for travel. Your Shih Tzu doesn’t want
to lie on the cold plastic, or worse yet, a wire grate.
Choose a soft cushion, pad, pillow, fleece mat, or folded blanket
to line the crate. You can also cut a piece of foam and wrap fleece
or a blanket around it or slip it inside a pillowcase. Whatever you
choose, the cover should be washable and allow space for your
Shih Tzu to get in the crate and change positions.

Chapter 5: Stocking Up: What Every Shih Tzu Needs 69

You may also choose to purchase a comfy dog bed. You can spend
a little or a lot on a dog bed, and there are many to choose from.
Shih Tzu tend to enjoy smaller beds that make them feel safe and
surrounded, such as doughnut-style beds or beds with padded
sides. Some even like covered cat beds they can crawl inside.
Collars and harnesses
Every dog needs a collar to hold identification tags and to have
somewhere to clip a leash when you take your dog on a walk.
However, because Shih Tzu sometimes have breathing problems
and trachea problems (see Chapter 13 for more info about these
health issues), some Shih Tzu do better with a harness, especially
if they tend to pull on the leash. A harness puts pressure on the
dog’s chest instead of the neck, so this option is safer and more
comfortable. If your Shih Tzu doesn’t pull or walk on a leash much,
a collar is fine.
When choosing a collar or harness for your new Shih Tzu, make
sure you pick one that’s comfortable and soft so it doesn’t wear
away at your dog’s coat. Nylon, plastic, and other soft materials
are lightweight and often adjustable. Leather collars cost more but
are more durable, and some are quite beautiful.
You should be able to fit two fingers between the collar and your
Shih Tzu’s neck or between the harness and your dog’s chest, but
not much more, or she could slip out on a walk and run into the
street. Adjustable collars and harnesses offer room for growing. Or,
buy a less expensive collar or harness for your puppy, keep check-
ing it for the correct fit, and then invest in a nicer, more permanent
version when your Shih Tzu is fully grown around his first birthday.
Never use a metal training collar or choke chain. Because Shih
Tzu’s tracheas are vulnerable to collapse, the compressing action
of these training collars is too harsh and dangerous. Besides,
your Shih Tzu doesn’t need you to jerk on him. There are kinder,
gentler ways to train him. (See Chapters 15 and 17 for more info
on training.)
Leash
Even if you don’t think your tiny puppy could run away from you
very quickly, a leash (or lead) can keep your Shih Tzu safe when
you go on walks or venture outside your fenced yard. If Samson
sees something like a squirrel across the street and dashes out in
front of a car, you won’t be able to stop him if he isn’t on a leash.
Part II: Opening Your Home to Your Shih Tzu 
70

Choose nylon or a lightweight leather leash because a big, heavy,
leather or chain leash can be too cumbersome for a small dog.
Leashes generally come in four-foot and six-foot lengths. Either one
is fine, depending on what’s more comfortable for you.
Some people like retractable leashes — the kind that let your dog
go out on a long leash to explore, but that wind up automatically
into a plastic case as your dog gets closer to you again. These
leashes are fine as long as you can keep control over the dog in
case a larger dog with aggression on his mind suddenly shows up
on the scene.
Toys and playtime
Puppies need to play, and plenty of adult dogs enjoy playtime, too.
Play is good exercise and it lets dogs release the hunter, retriever,
or tug-o-war champion inside. Get your Shih Tzu a few toys to
treasure, and rotate them if your Shih Tzu loses interest.
Choose toys without small parts that could break off and become a
choking hazard.
Make sure that your shopping list has one or two of the following
types of toys:
 Chew toys: Puppies need to chew as their adult teeth come in.
You may have to offer your Shih Tzu a few different chew toys
to find the one she really likes.
 Stuffed toys: Some dogs may rip out all the stuffing, and some
Shih Tzu will ignore stuffed toys completely, but if your dog
gets attached to his stuffed toy, it could become his second
best friend (after you, of course). You may want to have a
spare!
 Squeaky toys: Some Shih Tzu think toys that squeak are a
hoot and love to paw them and even toss them in the air.
Others ignore them, but if you squeeze the squeaker, you can
probably get them interested.
If your Shih Tzu breaks open the toy, take the toy away. You
don’t want her to choke on the squeaker.
 Fetch toys: Frankly, many Shih Tzu have no interest whatso-
ever in fetching anything. They may run after something if you
throw it, but they won’t bring it back. Other Shih Tzu think
fetching is fun, and for those that enjoy it, playing fetch can be
a great form of indoor exercise. (See Chapter 8.)
Chapter 5: Stocking Up: What Every Shih Tzu Needs 71

Baby gate
You may want to buy a baby gate if you leave your Shih Tzu inside
the house when you have to leave for awhile and can’t take your
Shih Tzu with you. The gate can either keep your dog in one area
or keep him out of other areas of the house.
A baby gate is especially helpful during the housetraining period,
when you need to confine your pup to one place to pee, and when
there are doorless rooms or staircases you don’t want your Shih
Tzu to go. (See Chapter 16 for more on housetraining.)
When you buy a gate, keep the following in mind:
 Size: Shih Tzu aren’t jumpers or climbers. They’re more likely
to want to keep all four paws on the floor, so shorter baby
gates usually work just fine.
 Style: Pick a style that’s easy for you to use, but sturdy
enough to stay put. Look for well-made, solid gates. Cheap,
rickety gates are a pain to operate.
 Safety: Make sure the baby gate doesn’t have openings that
your dog’s head can fit through and get stuck in. Avoid gates
made of anything that can snag your Shih Tzu’s coat or collar.
Yard pen and fence
Sometimes you may want your Shih Tzu outside with you, so you
can both enjoy the nice weather or get out of the stuffy house. If
you have a fenced yard, that’s great! But if you don’t, buy a small
portable pen or dog run.
Shih Tzu simply aren’t outdoor dogs, period. Never keep Shih Tzu
outside unsupervised, because they don’t tolerate temperature
extremes, and they’ll be vulnerable to theft, dog attacks, and rough
children. There’s also a strangulation risk if Samson is left unsuper-
vised tied to a line.
Travel bags and carriers
Shih Tzu would much rather go with you than stay home alone,
and their small size makes traveling easy, especially if you have a
good dog carrier. Shoulder bags, soft-sided kennels on wheels with
long handles, even small comfy crates that buckle into a seatbelt
can all facilitate taking your Shih Tzu with you, whether on vaca-
tion or just out to the mall. And don’t forget the dog seatbelt! (See
Chapter 6 for more info on dog seatbelts.)
Part II: Opening Your Home to Your Shih Tzu 
72

For carrying your Shih Tzu around town with you, I particularly
like Sherpa bags. They come in many cool styles and the quality is
great for the price. Check them out at www.sherpapet.net. I also
love the puppy purse, which you can see at www.puppypurse.com.
Some people even sneak their Shih Tzu into malls, shopping cen-
ters, and restaurants because the dogs are so good, and they
snooze quietly in a roomy shoulder bag, knowing they’re close by
their owners. Of course, I would never officially recommend taking
your Shih Tzu into a place where dogs aren’t allowed. (But if you
do it, I promise not to tattle.)
Other important stuff
Your supplies list isn’t complete without a few of these odds
and ends:
 Identification: Your dog’s ID tag needs to include your
address, phone number, and your dog’s name. (Check out
Chapter 12 for identification ideas.) You can order them in
your local pet store or find hundreds of options online.
 Stain and odor remover: When a dog smells the place where
he previously peed, he’s likely to pee there again. Remove
stains immediately and ramp up your housetraining efforts to
prevent repeat offenses (Chapter 16 has more on housetrain-
ing). Your local pet store has effective stain and odor
removers.
 Bitter Apple or other chew deterrent spray: Although Shih
Tzu aren’t notorious chewers, some do like to chew on shoes,
clothing, and furniture, especially when teething. Keep plenty
of acceptable chew toys around and spray off-limits areas like
furniture legs with Bitter Apple or another safe chew deter-
rent spray. Find this product in your local pet store or online.
Living in the Lap of Luxury:
Fun, Extravagant Supplies
If you’re so inclined, you can spend a lot on goodies for your dog.
Small-dog people are notoriously prone to frequenting pet bou-
tiques for gourmet treats, jewelry, or canine couture. Just search
pet boutique on the Internet and see what you find.
Chapter 5: Stocking Up: What Every Shih Tzu Needs 73

Your Shih Tzu really doesn’t care one way or the other, but if you
really want to shower your Shih Tzu with the best, this section has
some supplies to consider for your Shih Tzu.
Fancy food and high-end treats
A good-quality premium kibble may be all your Shih Tzu needs, but
some people like to go all out and buy frozen raw food; fancy,
canned food; organic food; or even home-cooked food. Some of
these options really are healthier than regular kibble, while others
are just packaged to look fancy. For more on feeding your Shih Tzu
appropriately, see Chapter 9.
Even more fun are dog bakeries that are popping up all over the
country and offering healthy and even gorgeous pet treats for pets
who only snack on the very best. Some of my favorite places
include
 Three Dog Bakery: This place is the market leader in the dog
bakery business. Check them out online: www.threedog.com.
 Good Dog Express: This company has all the supplies to
throw the doggy bash of the year! Go to www.gooddog
express.com.
 Canine Confections, Inc.: The company sells treats for the
organically minded dog owner. The treats even come in
candy boxes. Very swanky. Find them at www.canine
confections.com.
 Central Bark Bakery: They sell toys, pet supplies, and other
dog goodies. Go online at www.centralbarkbakery.com.
Fancy grooming
You can buy plain old regular dog shampoo, or you can buy dog
shampoo full of sweet-smelling botanicals and other natural ingre-
dients in fanciful bottles. Some products contain glitter, milk and
honey, or candy colors. Some companies also sell bath toys, terry
towel wraps, and dog perfume. You can even buy fingernail polish
for dogs! Because Shih Tzu need more grooming than many other
breeds, you can really go to town with this stuff if you desire.
Home furnishings
Would you believe that you can get Shih-Tzu-sized furniture to
match your home décor scheme? It’s true. From frothy, pink
canopy beds in miniature to red, velvet sofas, leopard-print
Part II: Opening Your Home to Your Shih Tzu 
74

chaises, and smart-tweed loveseats, you can find just about any
style and your Shih Tzu can have a space just for her. Of course,
she may prefer your lap, but just think how cute she’ll look
sprawled dramatically, movie-star-style, on that lime-green puppy-
sized beanbag chair.
Your local boutique pet store may have some great choices in dog
furniture, but you can get some outrageous and gorgeous stuff
online, too. Companies change often so just search dog furniture or
dog beds and see what you get.
Bling and couture
Crystal or studded leather collars, anyone? Delicate party dresses
or fleece hoodies? Leather motorcycle jackets or faux fur wraps?
Charms to hang on the collar or rhinestone chokers? Hair acces-
sories galore? Whatever your delight, you can find it all. In fact, this
Chapter 5: Stocking Up: What Every Shih Tzu Needs 75
Expressing the Shih Tzu in you
Why should Lola and Samson have all the fun? You can buy plenty of Shih-Tzu-
inspired merchandise made just for you. Some companies sell matching sweaters
for dogs and their parents. You can buy Shih Tzu charms, pendants, paintings, sculp-
tures, and folk art, or if you’re a little more budget-minded, you can purchase flags,
T-shirts, and bumper stickers. Everybody loves their breed and many companies
make it easy to prove it to the world.
Hundreds of companies exist with Shih Tzu stuff for sale. To find more on your own,
just search Shih Tzu gifts on the Internet. Try these Web sites:
 www.shihtzu.org: The American Shih Tzu Club (ASTC) has an online store
that sometimes features cute Shih Tzu paraphernalia and gift ideas.
 www.akc.org: The American Kennel Club (AKC) has a store that features
books, prints, ornaments, and decorative art.
 www.danburymint.com: The site has a huge selection of merchandise:
figurines, clothing, ornaments, throws, decorate plates, and more.
 www.k9gifts.com/dog-gifts/shihtzu.html: Find mailboxes, stained
glass, gift bags, leash holders, and much more.

category is so big that New York even holds Pet Fashion Week in
August with a full-scale runway event featuring supermodels of
both the two-legged and four-legged varieties.
I love this stuff for my dog, so I have a few favorite companies:
 High Maintenance Bitch: Don’t be offended by the name —
everybody in the dog world uses this word and nobody
thinks anything about it. This company is one of my favorites
for bling. They have magnetic earrings, feather boas, kimono
wraps, furniture, and even elevated food and water bowls
shaped like martini glasses. Go online: www.girlmeets

 Charming Pet Charms: They specialize in charms and jew-
elry, but they also sell pet clothing. Wouldn’t Lola look cute in
that pink furry scarf? Find them at www.charmingpet

Prepping for Your
Shih Tzu’s Arrival
In This Chapter
 Preparing the people in your life for the new dog
 Making your house and yard Shih-Tzu-safe
 Getting the vet on board
 Celebrating the joyous homecoming at last
 Buckling up for safety
You have the crate; you have the collar; you have the comb. (If
you don’t have the necessary supplies, check out Chapter 5.)
All that’s left is bringing home your new canine companion, right?
Actually, you have a few more things to think about and take care
of before you bring your Shih Tzu into your home. Do you have
areas set up for your new family member to be comfortable? Have
you thought about safety? Have you told the kids what to expect?
Does the vet know you’re coming?
So many questions but don’t worry; this chapter helps you get all
your ducks in a row so when you do finally bring that puppy home,
everything (and everyone) is ready.
Making Sure Everyone Is Ready
Other than knowing how to say “Awwwwwww,” you and your family
may not think you need to know a ton of info before bringing your
Shih Tzu home with you. But there are plenty of steps to take
before bring the new addition home. Keep these general tips in
mind about introducing your new dog to the family:
 Give your pup some space. No matter how adorable little
Lola is, no matter how much you want to scoop her up and
carry her around with you all day, you need to give her some

space. She’s experiencing a major adjustment period and
needs time to get her bearings, explore a little, and find out
about her new life.
 Know your puppy-free zones. Make sure that your family
knows of any people-only zones in your house. If you don’t
want the dog to go to certain places, such as downstairs or
into certain rooms, everybody in the family must be aware of
this policy and get in the habit of keeping doors shut and
baby gates in place (see Chapter 5 for info on baby gates).
 Have a talk with the kids. Prepare your kids for your new
family member. Children must understand that even though
little Samson looks like a toy, he isn’t a toy. Shih Tzu puppies
are sturdier than some toy breeds, but they can still be injured
if a child drops the dog or falls on the dog. Every home with
small children and Shih Tzu should live by a hard-and-fast rule,
which must apply not only to the children in the house but
also to any visiting children: Small children must only play with
Shih Tzu puppies while sitting or lying on the floor. No carrying a
Shih Tzu while standing up! (Check out Chapter 7 for more
detailed info about introducing children to Lola or Samson.)
Shih-Tzu-Proofing Your
House and Yard
Your family is ready for your new family member, but is your home
ready? Even if you have a small apartment, every human household
has potential dog hazards — poisons, choking, strangulation. But
you don’t have to live in fear for your new puppy, and I don’t want to
freak you out, either. As long as you’re aware of these dangers, you
can prevent something bad happening to little Lola and Samson.
Just as you would childproof a home if you were bringing in a tod-
dler, you must puppyproof your home and yard before bringing in
your new puppy. This section can help you start.
Avoiding poisons
Every year, many pets visit veterinary emergency clinics because of
poisoning. Poisons come in surprising forms from spoiled food to
that innocent looking houseplant. All puppies chew on things and
explore the world with their mouths, so you must put all potential
poisons out of reach from your new dog. You can either place
these poisons on shelves where your Shih Tzu can’t reach them
Part II: Opening Your Home to Your Shih Tzu 
78

or use baby locks to prevent her from opening cabinets. (For more
info on what to do in case of accidental poisoning, see Chapter 13.)
Before you bring home your puppy, make sure you do the following:
 Cover all garbage and put it out of reach. Even though your
Shih Tzu looks little, you’d be surprised what a motivated
small dog can do to tip over that trash.
 Keep all household cleaners, laundry detergent, and other
chemicals in a locked cabinet (or at least in a cabinet that a
dog can’t nose open). You never know what a curious puppy
may try to sample. Don’t use rug deodorizers or carpet clean-
ers when you have a dog, or keep the dog out of the room when
using them. They can be hazardous if ingested or inhaled.
 Keep certain human foods away from dogs. Some regular
foods humans enjoy can be toxic to dogs, including onions,
raisins, chocolate, and some spices. Even though junk food
isn’t necessarily poisonous, it can make your Shih Tzu sick or
just overweight. Your pup should only eat high quality pet food,
healthy treats, and occasional healthy people food like meat,
fish, veggies, fruit, and the occasional spoonful of plain yogurt
or cottage cheese. (For more on feeding, see Chapter 9.)
If you aren’t sure those leftovers are safe for you to eat, don’t
give them to your Shih Tzu either. Dogs may have strong
stomachs, but they aren’t immune to food poisoning.
 Store human medications out of reach. Human medications
can poison dogs. If you accidentally spill aspirin or any other
pill or liquid medicine, make sure you pick up or mop every bit.
 Lock away all pesticides. Pesticides in the form of roach
traps, ant bait, rat poison, or any other chemical in the house
or yard can pose a serious threat. If you must use pesticides,
be sure that your Shih Tzu can’t get anywhere near them.
 Stash antifreeze away (and clean it up immediately).
Antifreeze smells and tastes sweet to dogs, but it’s a deadly
poison. Make sure that your car doesn’t leak antifreeze in the
garage or driveway, and never leave your Shih Tzu unsuper-
vised in any area where cars park and potentially drip toxic
fluids into tempting puddles on the ground.
If your little Samson drinks even a bit of antifreeze, call the vet
immediately, or go straight to the clinic. If your dog staggers
around or acts drunk and you suspect he ingested antifreeze,
go immediately to the vet. Pets can seem to recover but can
suffer kidney failure, coma, and death within 12 hours if
untreated.
Chapter 6: Prepping for Your Shih Tzu’s Arrival 79

 Keep all houseplants out of reach. Many dogs won’t chew on
houseplants, but some do. Some houseplants are harmless,
but others can kill. According to the American Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA), the ten most
common poisonous household or yard plants are marijuana,
sago palm, lilies, tulip and narcissus bulbs, azaleas and rhodo-
dendrons, oleander, castor bean, cyclamen, kalanchoe, and
yew. For a more extensive list of toxic plants to avoid in your
home or yard, check out the following Web site: www.hsus.
org/pets/pet_care/protect_your_pet_from_common_
household_dangers/common_poisonous_plants.html.
 Watch your dog at all times outside. Many items in your yard
can be harmful to your pet, from mulch in the garden to flow-
ering plants to lawn chemicals. Never leave your Shih Tzu out-
side unattended, especially if she likes to chew on things, and
never let a Shih Tzu play on a chemically treated lawn.
If you think your Shih Tzu has swallowed poison, contact your
emergency veterinary clinic immediately or call the ASPCA Poison
Control Center hotline at (888) 426-4435. A $55 consultation fee
may be applied to your credit card.
Eyeing other potential dangers
Puppies can get into plenty of trouble around the house. Curious
and interested in the world, they explore — often with their mouths.
Also, because they’re small, they can get lost, stuck, or stepped on.
Here are some ways to keep your puppy safe from harm.
 Cover or tape all exposed electrical cords. Puppies need to
chew, and if they see an electrical cord, they may gnaw.
 Reduce all potential strangulation hazards. A Shih Tzu can
get caught in a mini-blind cord, drapery tie, or even a baby
gate, and strangle himself when nobody’s watching.
 Never, ever leave your Shih Tzu unsupervised and tied on a
leash outside. Doing so leaves your pup vulnerable to stran-
gulation, attack by other animals, heatstroke, frostbite, and
theft. Your Shih Tzu is a companion, so keep him with you.
 Check for unsteady furniture and low-hanging tablecloths
or runners. Your Shih Tzu can bump or pull them, acciden-
tally knocking over heavy objects, or breaking things.
 Watch your feet! Your Shih Tzu wants to be with you and will
most likely follow you around, so if you aren’t watching where
you step, you may step right on him.
Part II: Opening Your Home to Your Shih Tzu 
80

 Always check inside dryers, cupboards, and other small
spaces before closing them. Your Shih Tzu could be inside.
Also be careful of recliners, baskets of laundry, and other
snuggly places your Shih Tzu may wiggle into.
 Prevent drowning! Their heavy coats and heavy bones don’t
suit Shih Tzu for swimming, and if a Shih Tzu falls into a swim-
ming pool, fish pond, hot tub, bathtub, bucket of water, or
even the toilet, he can drown. Keep Shih Tzu away from all
water (and keep the toilet lid down).
 Puppyproof all rooms. If you haven’t puppyproofed a room,
keep your Shih Tzu out. Close the door or erect a baby gate.
Protecting your belongings
You didn’t really care that much about your favorite shoes or that
imported cashmere sweater did you? Sure, many dogs chew much
more vigorously and destructively than a Shih Tzu, but that doesn’t
mean little Lola doesn’t have a destructive set of choppers, too.
The best way to protect your belongings is to put them away, and
make sure that kids keep their toys off the floor, too. A Shih Tzu
may only chew a tiny hole in your gorgeous new silk skirt, but a
tiny hole is a still a hole. For items you can’t put away, like couch
cushions or the corner of the Oriental rug your Shih Tzu favors,
spray them with a bad-tasting chew-deterrent spray (nontoxic)
such as Bitter Apple.
Putting Your Home in Order
for Your Shih Tzu
Just because your home’s safe for a Shih Tzu doesn’t mean it’s
ready. Your Shih Tzu feels most welcome and can adjust quickly to
her new environment if you have her space mapped out and set
up. This section moves from room to room and helps you make
your home Shih Tzu-friendly.
Her boudoir: The kennel,
the dog bed, or your bed
Where will your Shih Tzu sleep? This consideration is important.
Sleep takes up a big chunk of life and establishing good habits mat-
ters. Deciding where your Shih Tzu is going to sleep may be a hard
Chapter 6: Prepping for Your Shih Tzu’s Arrival 81

decision for you. You want to make a choice that you can stick with
because changing your mind later sets the stage for inconsistency,
which confuses dogs. Before you decide, consider the pros and
cons (in the next sections) to each of your options.
Choice #1: The dog den (kennel or crate)
Having your new dog sleep inside his dog den, especially during
the first few weeks or months in your home, is arguably the best
choice. You should have a kennel or crate already (check out
Chapter 5 for what to look for when buying a kennel or crate) for
housetraining, travel, and other times when you need to keep your
dog enclosed. This kennel also makes a great sleeping spot.
Having a dog sleep in an enclosed space has the following
advantages:
 When the dog sleeps better, you may sleep better. When
comfortably lined with soft bedding, the kennel feels like a
den. This place feels safe and secure. Even your sociable Shih
Tzu sometimes wants to be alone.
 Dens serve as great housetraining tools. Check out Chapter
16 for how to use a kennel and crate for housetraining.
 Dens make little Samson feel safer. A den gives Samson a
place to rest when you can’t watch him. He can’t get out,
which he may not always like, but others can’t get in either,
which he will like. The trick is to make the den seem like the
best place in the world to little Samson.
Here’s how:
• Hide yummy treats in the crate. Whenever he goes in,
he’ll find little snacks buried in the bedding of the kennel.
• Locate the den next to your bed. This placement gives
your dog some comfort to know that you’re right there
beside him during the night. During the day, you can
move the crate to your office or wherever you spend
time, or you can leave it in a secluded spot Samson
prefers. After you find a place for the den, keep it there
so Samson always knows where it is.
• Maintain an open-door policy during the day. Leave
the den door open so Samson can go inside for a peace-
ful break from the family whenever he wants. Before
you know it, he’ll probably hang out in there when he
isn’t busy with his very important job of being your
companion.
Part II: Opening Your Home to Your Shih Tzu 
82

Don’t use a child’s room or play room to place the kennel for seclu-
sion. Children can be tempted to take Lola out of her cage and play
with her when you aren’t watching.
Choice #2: The dog bed
Dog beds come in many shapes and sizes. Some are simple, basic
dog beds, while some are quite luxurious. But no matter what type
of bed you choose for your new Shih Tzu (check out Chapter 5 for
more info), the trick is to get her to actually sleep in the bed. Unlike
a kennel with a door that closes with a latch, a dog bed is used vol-
untarily. If Lola doesn’t want to sleep there, she can always get up
and go somewhere else.
You can, however, make the dog bed more appealing to your Shih
Tzu with a few easy tricks:
 Hide treats in the bed. “Look what’s in here, Lola!”
 Put the bed next to your bed. “Don’t worry, Lola. I’m right
here.”
 Place her in the bed and praise her. Whenever she goes to the
bed on her own, praise her! “What a good dog, in her own bed!”
Never scold her for leaving the bed. She may associate the
scolding with the bed and then she’ll never want to go back.
If Lola consistently chooses a different space other than her dog
bed for sleeping, such as under a chair, under the bed, or under a
desk, you can put the dog bed in that spot, or you can get her a
dog bed that’s more enclosed and private. She may be seeking a
space that feels safer and more like a den.
Choice #3: Your bed
My guess is that many Shih Tzu owners let their dogs sleep curled
up beside them in bed. If you decide that your Shih Tzu can sleep
in bed with you, just remember to take her out for a potty break
several times during the night to make sure she doesn’t find a nice
potty spot under your covers!
Some people teach their Shih Tzu to sleep in the kennel until house-
training is complete and then let the dog come into the bed later, if
she so desires. (See “Choice #1: The dog den [kennel or crate]”ear-
lier in this section.) That’s fine, too. But doing things the other way
around may hurt your dog’s feelings, and she won’t understand
why she’s being banished from a place she was welcomed before.
Chapter 6: Prepping for Your Shih Tzu’s Arrival 83

The downside of bed sleeping: You can injure or even smother a
very small puppy if you happen to roll over on him during the
night. Plus, Shih Tzu can get overheated under a lot of covers.
Keep your dog on top of the blanket, and if he’s a very small
puppy, keep him in his crate or dog bed at least until he’s big and
strong enough to fend for himself.
And of course, some people don’t want the dog in the bed at all
and for good reasons:
 Insomnia: Many people suffer from insomnia because their
pets keep them awake in the bed.
 Snoring: Some Shih Tzu snore, which may keep you awake.
 Dog hair: Some people don’t want dog hair in the bed.
 Allergies: Allergies can worsen at night for some people.
 Private time: Some people just like to sleep alone (or alone
with another human companion).
If you don’t want the Shih Tzu in your bed, that’s perfectly fine.
Samson can be just as happy in a dog bed or a kennel — eventually.
Daytime quiet area
The doggy boudoir is a nice place for a Shih Tzu to sleep, but also it
serves as a useful tool for housetraining and enforced quiet times
when you can’t supervise. Most dogs sleep a lot and sensitive types
can get over-stimulated by too much activity. Sometimes, a Shih Tzu
really needs to get away and calm down or nap undisturbed.
However, not every Shih Tzu owner ultimately uses a kennel or
crate for rest time and housetraining, preferring to set aside a spe-
cial area for unsupervised rest times during the day. This practice
is particularly common among pet owners who decide to paper- or
litter-train their pets instead of training them to go outside.
The space you choose for your Shih Tzu should be small, puppy-
proofed (see “Shih-Tzu-Proofing Your House and Yard” earlier in
this chapter for more info), inaccessible to small children, escape-
proof, and comfortable. You can use a baby gate to section off a
small portion of the kitchen with newspapers or a doggy litter box
in one corner and food and water dishes in another corner.
The space shouldn’t be too large. Don’t give your Shih Tzu puppy
the entire run of the house — or at least, not at first. Dogs feel
much more secure in small spaces, preferably partially enclosed.
It’s the den instinct, and even though Shih Tzu don’t much resemble
wolves, they still feel safer and more comfortable in smaller spaces.
Part II: Opening Your Home to Your Shih Tzu 
84

The dining area
One of the most important things to keep regular in a Shih Tzu’s
life is his eating area and schedule. Dogs like routine, so you
should set up the food and water bowls in a place your Shih Tzu
can get to easily and at all times. Many people feed their pets in
the kitchen or dining room, before, during, or after the family meal.
Where you feed your Shih Tzu matters less than always feeding
him at the same time and in the same place.
If your dog has a special quiet area or gated area where he stays
while you can’t watch him, put the food and water in this area, so he
always has access to water. Avoid choosing places like bathrooms
where a door may get closed and block your Shih Tzu’s access to
water. Be sure the water bowl or bottle (see Chapter 5 for more info
on selecting a water bowl or bottle) is clean with fresh water, and fill
the food bowl the same way, at the same time, every day.
To keep the dining area clean and sanitary, you can use a large
plastic placemat under the dishes. Shih Tzu beards tend to slop
water around, so this can keep your floor from getting stained.
Also, locate the food and water away from the bathroom area, for
sanitation and because Shih Tzu don’t like to have these areas too
close together. If they are, the dog may decide to relocate his bath-
room spot, with or without your knowledge.
The pooping and peeing area
Decide where to locate your dog’s bathroom area before you bring
home your Shih Tzu because you spend some time establishing
this very important habit on your first day together. Do you want
your Shih Tzu to use a special spot in the house as her personal
toilet, or would you prefer she use the great outdoors? After you
decide which way to go, switching is very difficult and disruptive
to your dog’s routine, so think about this carefully.
Choosing that special place
If you decide to paper- or litter-train your Shih Tzu, choose an area
inside your house where your puppy can go:
 The daytime quiet area: If your Shih Tzu gets a daytime quiet
area, you can set up papers or a litter box in one corner (see
“Daytime quiet area” earlier in this chapter).
 The kitchen: Some people don’t like to see dog waste in the
kitchen, but for others, the floor is the easiest to clean.
Chapter 6: Prepping for Your Shih Tzu’s Arrival 85

 Bathrooms: Bathrooms make sensible areas because your
Shih Tzu is smart enough to tell that the bathroom is where
you do your business. Some dogs have been trained to use
shower stalls as their personal potties.
If you do choose the bathroom as your Shih Tzu’s potty spot,
be sure everyone in the family knows to keep the toilet seat
down at all times (except, obviously, during use). The toilet
bowl is a very real drowning hazard for Shih Tzu.
Paper training (or doggy litter box training) is ideal for people in
high-rise apartments, people who are homebound and have trou-
ble getting outside, those who can’t walk a dog or don’t live in an
area where they can easily or safely walk a dog, and those who live
in climates with harsh conditions. For the lowdown on housetrain-
ing, check out Chapter 16.
Going outside
If you choose to train your Shih Tzu to poop and pee outside, pick
an area in your yard or patio where you teach your Shih Tzu to go.
The area should be where people don’t walk in the yard or in a
spot that’s easy to clean and not unsightly.
Shih Tzu are small so they’re easy to clean up after, and some pet
owners find the Shih Tzu’s waste virtually disappears into the
grass and doesn’t really need to be picked up. This method applies
only to your own yard. Of course, you must pick up after your Shih
Tzu on walks when she poops on other peoples’ property.
Yard training is ideal for people with fenced yards, easy-clean
patios, or who don’t mind taking a dog out on a leash multiple
times every day, not only for walks but for short potty breaks.
Scheduling the Vet Check-up
Every new pet should visit a vet within the first 48 hours in a new
home. Most breeders and pet stores require, by contract, that you
take a new dog to a vet to check the dog and give her health a
thumbs-up (or thumbs-down). So make sure to arrange for a vet
and make an appointment before you bring home your new puppy.
Plan ahead and tell your current vet (if you have one) that you’re
getting a new family member. Then when you pick up your new
arrival, your vet is aware that you need to schedule an appoint-
ment and can fit you in.
Part II: Opening Your Home to Your Shih Tzu 
86

What if you really aren’t sure which vet to use? First, check with
your breeder or friends and neighbors for a recommendation. If
you don’t find any useful info, check out Chapter 12 to find a vet.
Picking Up Puppy
Are you really ready to pick up your new Shih Tzu puppy and bring
her home? If you have all the supplies, if the house is ready, if
the family is prepared, then . . . yes! Make arrangements with the
breeder (or shelter or pet store or wherever you’re getting your
dog) to pick up the puppy, so they can prepare all the paperwork
and supplies (see Chapter 4 for more on the essential paperwork
and Chapter 5 for the necessary supplies). Be sure you bring a car-
safe kennel or dog seatbelt with you (check out the next section to
help you make the decision).
Before you leave the breeder (or place you get your dog), be sure
you have all the necessary, important stuff:
 The purchase or adoption contract (see Chapter 4)
 The health guarantee (if separate from the contract — see
Chapter 4)
 Vaccination records and other records of any veterinary care
your Shih Tzu has already had (see Chapter 4)
 All necessary registration paperwork to register your pure-
bred dog (if relevant) (see Chapter 4)
 Written info on care, grooming, and training
 A small bag of the food that your Shih Tzu has been eating, if
you plan to switch his food (for more info, see Chapter 9)
 Information on microchipping and how to send in the paper-
work to have your dog’s microchip registered (for more on
microchipping, see Chapter 12)
 The breeder’s contact info
 The dog! (If you walked out without her, you wouldn’t be the
first flustered new pet owner to do that.)
At this time, you can also ask any remaining questions you’ve
thought of while preparing your home. And then off you go . . .
home sweet home, here you come, with a Shih Tzu in your arms
and a song in your heart. Wait, did I just say “a Shih Tzu in your
arms?” Perish the thought. All Shih Tzu should travel to their new
homes safely buckled up or crated. (Check out the next section for
important info.)
Chapter 6: Prepping for Your Shih Tzu’s Arrival 87

Buckling Up: Making
the Trip Home
You’re finally ready to take your new dog home, but remember,
your dog may never have ridden in a car before. She may be
scared. Also, if the drive is long, you’ll want water for her, and a
leash and collar so you can safely take her out for potty breaks.
Before you load Lola into the car, make sure she’s safe. The follow-
ing advice can help your trip home go more smoothly.
 Secure your puppy in her crate. If you’ve brought along a
crate that buckles into the car, put her in the crate first, and
then put the crate into the car. Don’t buckle a crate into the
back of a pickup truck or any other open-air space. The tem-
perature extremes, noise, wind, and being far away from you
can be too traumatic and even dangerous.
 Use a dog seatbelt. A seatbelt you say? Your Shih Tzu is so
little. He absolutely needs a seatbelt. What if you get in a car
accident on the way home? A dog can be seriously injured or
killed in a car accident, and he can also act as a missile inside
the car, injuring you or other passengers. Plus, a loose puppy
can easily bolt out of an open door and into oncoming traffic.
Most well-stocked pet stores have dog seatbelts, or you can
shop online. The following Web sites provide essential prod-
ucts to keep your new Shih Tzu safe while riding in a car:
• www.ruffrider.com
• www.batzi.com
• www.seatbeltsfordogs.com
• www.doginfopoint.com
• www.petsafetybelts.com
 Keep your dog confined at all times when the car’s moving.
You probably want to take her in your arms and cuddle her on
the drive home, but this simply isn’t safe. What if you were in
a car accident? Talk to her, assure her, but if you absolutely
must take her out of her crate or seatbelt, stop the car, park in
a safe place, and then offer those cuddles (and a bathroom
break, if it’s been awhile).

Chapter 7
Welcoming Home Your
Shih Tzu with Open Arms
In This Chapter
 Showing your Shih Tzu around the house
 Introducing your Shih Tzu to the family and other pets
 Making it through the night
T
o your new puppy, your home isn’t home sweet home at all. At
least, not yet. A strange, unfamiliar, possibly even scary place
awaits your little Lola, and she isn’t at all sure she likes the idea of
leaving her mother and fuzzy little brothers and sisters for a big,
unknown world.
This chapter can help you help Lola transition from life in the
whelping box (or the animal shelter) to life with you and your
family in your home. Your house will quickly become home to
your Shih Tzu if you introduce her gently and with guidance.
Introducing Your Dog
to the New Digs
There you are, pulling up in the driveway with poor little Samson
in the backseat. He’s probably wondering what the heck is going
on and why these giant two-legged creatures have taken him away
from the place he thought was his home. Not to worry, Samson.
Everything will turn out just fine. But remember how your little
puppy probably feels when you take him into that place you know
so well. He probably feels a little bit lost.

To help him feel a little less lost, introduce him to his new home by
showing him around. This section covers the important areas of
your home to show your new family member, as well as what to
remember when allowing your Shih Tzu a chance to explore your
home on his own.
Showing your Shih Tzu
the important areas
Dogs like to know where they are. If you walk in the door and
everybody starts shrieking and cooing at the cute little puppy,
Samson is going to feel even more overwhelmed, so tell everybody
to step off for just a few minutes. Put other pets in their kennels or
closed in other rooms, and ask the kids to step away from the Shih
Tzu. You’re going to help Samson feel right at home by taking him
to the important areas in your house first and letting him use all
his doggy senses to get a feel for the place.
Taking a potty break
After the stress of driving in a car with you, Samson probably
needs to relieve himself. Young puppies, in particular, need to pee
quite often. Before you go anywhere else (and that includes putting
your puppy down on the living room carpet), take the dog to the
spot you have chosen to be his own personal Shih Tzu bathroom.
The place a dog relieves himself is very important to you and to
the dog. This spot marks the dog’s territory, and after he’s put his
scent on the spot, he’ll remember where it is he’s supposed to go.
That’s why taking your new Shih Tzu to his potty spot first thing —
before he makes the leg of your new couch his new pee spot — is
important. (For more on choosing the right spot, see Chapter 6).
Getting your new dog to use the bathroom isn’t overly difficult.
Just remember these steps:
1. Put on his new collar and leash.
Doing so is very important because you’ll have better con-
trol over Samson when you get to the pee spot. You want to
send a clear message: This is the bathroom. The only way to
do that is to keep your Shih Tzu from wandering away
before he does his business.
Part II: Opening Your Home to Your Shih Tzu 
90

2. Go to your dog’s potty spot.
If you’ve chosen a spot outdoors, go there before you go
inside the house. If you plan to paper-train your Shih Tzu,
take him inside. Either way, carry the dog to the pee spot
and don’t put him down until you’ve reached that special
spot. He gets to sniff here first.
3. Allow your Shih Tzu to explore the potty area all he
wants, to the end of the leash.
Because your dog is in new territory, he has an instinct to
make his mark. This is just what you want! He can sniff; he
can scratch; he can sit down and look at you as if to say,
“Why are we still here?” No matter. Talk to him gently and
encouragingly. And wait. Don’t be in a hurry. Let the dog
get situated. Eventually, he’ll squat and do his business.
4. After Samson finishes his business, praise him by saying,
“Good dog!”
Don’t scare your little guy with too much enthusiasm, but let
him know he just did pretty much the most amazing thing
you’ve ever seen. Mission one accomplished. Now you can
move on to the next interesting site (see the next section).
If Samson simply won’t pee, don’t despair. Show him his kennel
next, and let him take a little rest, for about 15 minutes. (See the
next section on introducing your dog to his sleeping area.) Then,
take him back out and try again. (Also check out Chapter 16 that
covers housetraining more in-depth.)
Introducing the sleeping digs
Dogs sleep a lot, and your Shih Tzu will probably spend a lot of
time snoozing on your lap, at your feet, in your arms, or some-
where nearby, where he can keep an eye on you. Much of the time,
however — when you can’t keep an eye on him — your Shih Tzu
will be snoozing in his crate or dog bed, so be sure to spend some
time introducing him to his boudoir as follows:
1. Take your Shih Tzu to his dog bed or kennel/crate.
If it’s a kennel or crate, open the door.
2. Toss a tempting, tiny treat or two onto the bedding.
He may not be hungry, so don’t worry if he ignores it.
Chapter 7: Welcoming Home Your Shih Tzu with Open Arms 91

3. Put your Shih Tzu next to the bed or kennel/crate and
see if he climbs in to get the treat or just to explore.
Some dogs climb right in, curl up, and look at you as if to
say, “Okay, I can hang out here for awhile, I’m good.”
Others may not be so interested, or may even seem shy or
fearful about this strange new place. Don’t worry, all these
reactions are normal. Most importantly, don’t force your
Shih Tzu into the bed or kennel/crate right now. The point
is, you’ve introduced the area, so the next time your dog
sees it, it won’t be new anymore.
Hankering for a nibble
With all the excitement, your Shih Tzu puppy may not be very
hungry just yet. However, the next spot you may want to visit is
the dining area. You can let your Shih Tzu find the dinner dishes on
her own, or you can escort her to the dining area.
To show the dining area for your pooch, check out these tips:
 Put a tiny bit of dog food in the food bowl, and fill the water
bowl with fresh clean water.
 Let Lola have a sniff and a bite or a sip if she likes.
 Don’t force it. If she drinks or eats or both, praise her. Good
girl. If she doesn’t, don’t worry about it.
Now she knows where her dinner dishes are located. If she does
have a snack, check a clock. In about 15 minutes or so, she’ll prob-
ably need to go back to her potty spot. But for now, she can
explore a little bit more.
Letting your dog explore safely
As your puppy explores the house, keep a few things in mind. Too
much territory can be intimidating, so if your puppy seems over-
stimulated or scared — shaking, whining, hiding, or sticking to you
like glue — keep the exploration limited to one room where you and
your dog will spend a lot of time, such as the family room or kitchen.
These pointers can help as you allow your dog to explore:
 Follow her around, just to be sure she’s safe and doesn’t get
into anything she isn’t supposed to. As Lola explores, remem-
ber that you want to set the rules right from the beginning.
Don’t let her do anything on that very first day that you don’t
Part II: Opening Your Home to Your Shih Tzu 
92

want her to do later, like nibble on the edge of the rug or play
tug-of-war with the curtain fringe. If she goes astray, redirect
her attention to something else, like a toy or a treat. Don’t
scold harshly or yell. You don’t want to scare her before
you’ve really gotten to know her. Distraction works better.
 Keep an eye out for signs that she has to go potty again. If
she starts to circle, sniff intently in one spot, or obviously
squat, then whisk her back to the potty spot. Don’t scold!
Praise her after you get there. Check out Chapter 16 for all
the signs.
After she has had a chance to explore the new smells of her new
home for awhile — five minutes, 20 minutes, or as long as she
remains interested — you can start introducing her to her new
roommates. The next section shows you how.
Making Proper Introductions
Imagine if someone took you out of your home one day without
any warning and took you to a whole new place to live, where you
were suddenly bombarded with five giants trying to pick you up
and pet you and talk right in your face. Yikes!
In the same way, your Shih Tzu can be scared and intimidated by too
many people trying to meet and handle her all at once. That’s why
carefully introducing other pets and family members is important —
one at a time, under controlled conditions — so the whole experi-
ence is positive (or at least not traumatic). The following sections
tell you how.
Meeting your other pets
Fortunately, Shih Tzu tend to be pretty easy-going and not aggres-
sive or territorial with other animals. But even so, the sweet tem-
perament of your Shih Tzu is no guarantee that your resident cat
or dog will take kindly to this new addition.
Here Kitty, Kitty
Most cats happily leave a new dog alone, and the most likely sce-
nario in a home with a resident cat is that the new puppy will
harass the cat, instead of the other way around. Cats generally are
independent, but they aren’t above getting jealous. So if all your
attention gets showered on your new little Lola, then Miss Kitty
may have good reason for revenge.
Chapter 7: Welcoming Home Your Shih Tzu with Open Arms 93

Keep the following pointers in mind when introducing your cat
with your new Shih Tzu:
 When you bring Miss Kitty out of hiding to meet Lola, keep
firm control over both pets. Let both animals have a look at
each other, but if either pet reacts negatively, let them go their
separate ways. They’ll work out their peace on their own, as
long as everybody has their personal space.
 Make sure Miss Kitty always has at least a couple of escape
routes, just in case Lola gets feisty. Some Shih Tzu chase cats,
and others simply keep trying to play with them long after the
cat has lost patience. Your cat should be able to dash out of
the room or jump up above Shih Tzu level.
A cornered cat can be dangerous, and if the cat thinks she can’t
escape any other way, she may injure your puppy with a swipe
of the claws — and your Shih Tzu’s eyes are particularly vulner-
able to scratches from a cat.
 Keep the cat’s litter box, food, and water out of Lola’s reach.
Your cat has been with you for awhile, and she shouldn’t have
to endure trespassing into her territory by some canine
upstart. Plus, some dogs like to play in cat litter or even eat
those little treats they find in the litter box. Dogs can even get
intestinal impactions from eating kitty litter.
 Be sure to give your cat plenty of attention and affection
when she wants it. As long as she knows she’s not out of the
loop, she probably won’t have a problem with her new roomie.
Shih Tzu are ultimately agreeable and aren’t a breed prone to
dashing after cats as if they were some kind of vermin. Your
cat probably doesn’t care much one way or the other whether
Lola wants to hang around way down there on the floor.
Most Shih Tzu really do get along fine with cats, and even if the
first meeting isn’t love at first sight, Lola and Miss Kitty will get
used to each other eventually. That is, as long as the cat can get
away and both pets are getting plenty of attention and care.
Other dogs: Friend or competition?
Shih Tzu see other pets, whether dogs or cats, as potential friends
and interesting companions. Other dogs may not always see a Shih
Tzu that way, however. Some breeds can be very territorial and will
feel threatened by the presence of another dog. Other breeds have
a strong prey drive and can even see the Shih Tzu as something to
Part II: Opening Your Home to Your Shih Tzu 
94

chase! These dogs aren’t generally good companions for Shih Tzu,
although there are exceptions.
Many dogs, however, are just as friendly and open to taking on a
dog sibling as the Shih Tzu is, and these friendly fellows can be
wonderful companions for Shih Tzu. In particular, Shih Tzu love
other Shih Tzu, and many people keep two, three, or more together
quite happily. That doesn’t mean your resident dog won’t be jeal-
ous or a little put out by the presence of a new dog in the house.
The way you introduce your new dog and your old dog can go a
long way toward easing the tension and making your two best
friends, well . . . best friends!
To ensure that the initial meeting goes smoothly, try the following
steps when introducing your new Shih Tzu to another dog. If you
have more than one dog, introduce your new dog to each one sepa-
rately, so they can work out their own relationships without too
much chaos:
1. Clip a leash on both dogs and bring the resident dog out
for an introduction.
Introduce your dogs in a room that doesn’t contain your
resident dog’s bed, crate, food, or water, and keep all toys
somewhere else during this first meeting, to eliminate any
sense of competition over resources. Neutralize the terri-
tory as much as possible so your resident dog doesn’t feel
threatened. If your dog likes to hang out on your bed or the
couch, don’t hold the meeting near these areas, either. You
may try to hold the meeting outside in the yard.
2. Keep both dogs on the ground and on their leashes at
first, just to test their reactions.
Let your dogs meet with all four paws on the floor so they
don’t feel possessive of, or possessed by, you. They need to
work out their relationships on dog terms. Also keep them
both on leashes just in case you need to reel in anybody —
if somebody lunges, you need to have control. (Doing so is
easier if someone else is helping you, so each one of you has
responsibility for one of the dogs.) Be aware, however, that
some dogs become more defensive on a leash just because
they know they’re on a leash. Keep the leash loose — hold it
firmly but make your dog feel like you’re pulling on it — so
neither dog feels restrained. Only use the leash (to pull a dog
away from the other dog) if somebody becomes aggressive
or threatening.
Chapter 7: Welcoming Home Your Shih Tzu with Open Arms 95

3. Let the dogs sniff each other and greet each other.
Stay positive and praise all friendly interactions. Chances
are, your two dogs will be fast friends right away! But if
they aren’t, or if you get a growl or a little fight, separate
the dogs again for awhile and try again in a few minutes.
Let them know that these fights won’t be tolerated. If they
want to interact, they have to play nice. If they growl, they
get separated (and separated from you — the ultimate
doggy punishment!).
Even if the dogs get along great, be sure to supervise all interac-
tions for at least the first few weeks. Dogs can be unpredictable,
especially when they’re adjusting to a new situation, and you want
to be sure you’re there to manage any sudden incidents. Keeping
everybody playing nicely and gently is your responsibility.
Problems may be less likely with a puppy — your resident dog may
just write him off as inferior. But even if your larger dog is ecstatic
about his new little puppy, he may get too rough, just out of sheer
exuberance. However — and this is important — don’t scold your
older dog for friendly interactions, even if you think they’re too
rough! Your dog could interpret your scolding as a message that
it’s wrong to be friendly with the Shih Tzu. Instead, keep hold of
him and encourage gentle interaction.
Many a resident dog has been interested and excited by a new
puppy at first, but when the pet owner (yes, you) gives the new
puppy all the attention and neglects the resident dog, the dog then
becomes dejected and feels jealous or confused about why he’s no
longer important to you. Please don’t let this happen! Give both
dogs plenty of attention and love and one-on-one time, too. Your
old dog needs to know you still love him just as much as you
always did, even if you have a new furry little sibling in the family.
Meeting the kids
The children have been bouncing off the walls in the background,
eager to descend on the new puppy with all their explosive energy.
And that’s wonderful! Kids and Shih Tzu go great together . . . with
a few precautions.
First of all, small puppies are fragile, just like human infants. You
can’t step on them, drop them, pull on their ears, or tote them
around like dolls without hurting or traumatizing them. Unlike
human infants, puppies have teeth like sharp little needles, and
because puppies explore the world with their mouths, children’s
Part II: Opening Your Home to Your Shih Tzu 
96

fingers and toes may easily come into contact with those teeth. To
prevent anyone from getting injured or feeling traumatized, follow
these steps:
1. Place the dog in an adult’s lap and ask the kids to sit by
the adult, one at a time.
Too many kids at once can frighten and overwhelm the new
dog. Tell the child not to rush over squealing, but to walk
over quietly and calmly as not to scare the new dog.
2. Allow the child to pet the dog.
Teach the child to be quiet and not to grab the dog.
Remember to be gentle with soft pats and soft words. An
older child can hold the dog on her lap, but remind her to
be gentle.
3. After a couple of minutes, take a break and let the dog
rest.
A new puppy can become overstimulated by too much wild
kid energy. Let Lola be the guide when she’s had enough
contact. If she shies away or starts to shake or growl, the
interaction has gone on for too long. Chances are, however,
that this won’t happen and dog and child will love each
other immediately.
Adults are in charge. Pay attention and don’t allow children and
dogs to hurt each other. If children understand at a young age to
treat a dog with gentle kindness, they’ve learned a valuable lesson.
Chapter 7: Welcoming Home Your Shih Tzu with Open Arms 97
Naming your new Shih Tzu
In this book, I talk a lot about Samson and Lola, but of course you can name your
new Shih Tzu anything you want. Naming a pet is fun and the whole family can get
involved. Whatever you name your dog, consider that shorter names are easier for
a dog to master. He can pick up “Here, Puff!” faster than “Here, Mister Puff-n-Stuff!”
or “Here, Sean Puffy Shih Tzu!”
Of course, that’s what nicknames are for. Your dog can have a long fancy name like
Elizabeth Barrett Browning, but you can call her Lizzy for short. In fact, most show
dogs have long fancy names, such as Champion Rapunzel’s Gold Plaited Mischief,
and also call names, like Goldy — the show-dog term for a nickname.
A lot of people give their Shih Tzu Chinese names to reflect their origins, and others
give them names that make reference to their long fluffy coats, but you can be as
creative as you want. Confucius? Fluffy? Steve? Have fun choosing.

After the child and the Shih Tzu have met, be sure the child under-
stands some basic rules about handling the dog:
 Show the child the correct way to pick up and hold the dog.
The child should put one hand under the dog’s chest and the
other around the rump, and then hold the dog against the
chest. Remember, children should always hold the dog while
sitting on the floor, until they’re old enough that they won’t
accidentally drop the dog. I recommend a child be at least 10
before carrying around a Shih Tzu.
 Tell the child not to let the dog chew on fingers. Any contact
of canine teeth on human skin should be met with a “No!” and
pulling the hand away. (Not a slap.) Have the child pet little
Lola and talk gently to her
 Depending on the child’s age, enlist him in the care of the
puppy. Teens and mature elementary-age kids can be a big
help. Kids can walk the dog, brush and comb the coat, prac-
tice basic training cues, and even feed the dog. However,
remember that ultimately, an adult should be responsible for
making sure these important jobs are accomplished.
 Instruct children in Shih Tzu safety. Just because the neigh-
bors allowed their Golden Retriever to go swimming doesn’t
mean little Lola can go swimming — her heavy coat and bone
structure make swimming very difficult, and the result could
be a disaster. Furthermore, Samson can’t run in the heat. That
long coat and short nose make him susceptible to heatstroke!
You can’t tie his leash to a bicycle and expect him to keep up.
You can’t take Lola outside without her leash on or expose
her to dangerous situations such as interactions with large
aggressive dogs or rough children. You can’t put Samson out-
side and forget about him, especially in hot weather. (For
more on Shih Tzu safety, see Chapters 12.)
 Keep a close eye on children to ensure they’re taking care of
the dog. Older children are still learning how to be responsible
and no child should be solely responsible for the care of a dog.
If the Shih Tzu belongs to an older child (say, an adult gave the
dog to the child as a gift), that’s great, in theory. In many cases,
a dog that supposedly belongs to a child quickly figures out
that he really belongs to the parents, because they’re the ones
who feed him, walk him, and spend time with him.
Older kids need guidance, too. They’re still kids and still learning
how to manage life in the world. Keep a watchful eye out and
make sure little Samson and older children both stay safe.

Getting Through the First Night
Even if you’ve had smooth sailing with all the other steps so far
(see the previous sections in this chapter), you may be in for a dif-
ficult night. If you think about it, this stage is perfectly natural.
When the house goes dark, your Shih Tzu is bound to feel the loss
of those snuggly siblings and her mother’s warmth.
But nighttime is a routine, and the best time to start a nighttime
routine with a new dog is on the very first night. Use these tips so
Lola’s first night (and the following nights) in her new home are
calm and soothing:
 Take your dog on a last-minute potty break. Doing so allows
your dog (and you) to sleep comfortably for awhile before she
has to go out again.
 Ensure that your dog has a full tummy — but not too full.
Your Shih Tzu should have had her evening meal, but also her
evening potty break after that meal. You don’t want to feed her
and put her straight to bed or she’ll just have to go out again.
 Leave a soft dog toy with your dog. A little cuddly toy can
comfort your dog, especially on her first few nights in a new
home. It may feel like one of her siblings.
 Make your dog’s boudoir comfy. Place soft padding in your
dog’s bed so she’s comfortable and warm. (Check out Chapter
5 for the right type of bedding.)
 Stay nearby. Remember, your dog doesn’t want to be alone. If
she knows you’re near, she’ll feel safer.
The whining and crying is only a test
Whimper, whine, whimper, whine . . . and you thought it was time
for sleeping? Most new puppies and even many adult dogs spend
some time whining and crying on their first night in a new home.
Remember, your Shih Tzu has been thrown into an entirely new
existence. Now it’s bedtime and your pup feels awfully nervous.
Where are her littermates? Where is her mother? And so starts the
whining! Wouldn’t you whimper a little, too? But (and this is a big
but) . . . you have to be strong.
On the first night, you may have some trouble keeping your dog in
her bed. Just keep encouraging her during the first few weeks to
sleep in it, and keep putting her back in the bed and praising her
when she goes there herself. Make the bed a rewarding place to be
Chapter 7: Welcoming Home Your Shih Tzu with Open Arms 99

and the bedtime ritual a routine. She’ll soon love to curl up, right
on schedule. In the meantime, here are some tips for establishing
that routine right now:
 Reach down and pet her. A hand on her assures her you’re
nearby, so she doesn’t worry quite so much. Just don’t pick
her up. Doing so teaches her that whining results in getting
you to pick her up, and you want her to learn, instead, that
whining results in nothing — neither good nor bad.
 Cuddle her (only if she’s already in bed with you). Truth
be told, if she’s in bed with you, and you plan to let her sleep
there indefinitely, you probably won’t hear much whining.
 Talk to her. Reassure her with calming, quiet words. Let her
know you’re there and everything is just fine — but that she
isn’t coming out to play right now.
Eventually your Shih Tzu will give up her whining and go to sleep
(maybe just out of sheer exhaustion). But that means she’ll figure
out that she can go to sleep in her new bed or den, and that every-
thing will be just fine when she wakes up. After a night or two of
this new routine, if you’ve stayed strong in your resolve to teach
her how to sleep in her new home, she should be sleep quietly
through the night — at least until she needs a potty break.
Potty breaks
When your Shih Tzu finally goes to sleep, the peacefulness may not
last for long, because much like human infants, puppies need to pee.
They can’t hold it all night long, and they don’t wear diapers. So
during these first nights, if your puppy sleeps, then wakes up and
whines, you need to take her to her potty spot, no matter the time.
An adult dog may not need any potty breaks during the night, but
young puppies will probably need at least two. For more detailed
instructions on housetraining your puppy, see Chapter 16.
And remember — the more consistent your nighttime routines are
from the very beginning, the faster you’ll all enjoy peaceful slumber.
Sweet dreams!

Chapter 8
Getting Through
the First Few Days
In This Chapter
 Getting to know each other
 Establishing the all-important routine
 Laying down the rules with some family training
A
lthough Shih Tzu tend to have better natural manners than
some breeds (I won’t name names, Mr. Labrador Retriever
puppy!), no puppy should be expected to understand, without any
information, a human’s strange and unusual quirks and pet peeves.
Humans and dogs have fundamental differences in the way they
see the world around them. That’s why the first few days are so
important. During this time you can introduce your dog to the
ground rules, which can help him gain confidence, lose fear, and be
an all-around happier fellow. And that’s good for everyone.
And don’t delay! Setting up the new routines, rules, and lifestyles
must happen right away (in the first few days). The sooner your
Shih Tzu learns what life’s like now in the new house, with new
people, the faster she can settle into her routines, resulting in a
happy dog (and a happy you, of course!).
Making a Good First Impression
Consider how your new Shih Tzu must be adjusting to life with his
brand new human. What’s he supposed to make of you? And are
you making the right first impression on him? Actually, because
Shih Tzu have been bred for so many centuries to be close personal
companions to humans, your Shih Tzu does have an inherent sense
about who you are. She isn’t some street dog who hasn’t ever met a
human. She knows what’s what, and so far, you’ve been pretty nice.

And so have others, in the best of circumstances. Your Shih Tzu
has probably already had loving care, gentle handling, and an idea
that humans are safe and wonderful. Now that you’re in charge,
your new Shih Tzu expects you to take care of her, keep her safe,
and give her a lot of attention. But if you don’t fulfill those jobs
right out of the gate, your Shih Tzu may begin to feel suspicious
and distrustful.
Naturally trusting, your Shih Tzu will accept your direction and
your leadership, if you provide it.
Setting Up a Daily Routine:
Your Shih Tzu Day Planner
Dogs thrive on routines and routines keep dogs feeling calm and
safe. If you like routine too, setting up a routine for your new dog
will be easy. Just figure out how to incorporate your Shih Tzu’s
daily requirements — meals, potty breaks, naps, walks, training
sessions, and so on — into your already-established routine.
If you’re “routine-challenged” (like me), setting up and sticking to a
routine may be more difficult. Even if you forget to eat, you still
must feed your Shih Tzu at the same time every day. Consider it
not only your responsibility but also one of the best ways to be
kind to and care for your Shih Tzu.
Maintaining a routine doesn’t mean you have to schedule every
minute of your dog’s day, but it does mean keeping up with a few
important events. This section helps you plan your dog’s daily
activities.
Chow time
Most mammals have a deep instinctual attachment to food, and
when they don’t get it, or don’t get it when they expect it, their
bodies react negatively with hunger pangs and, in the case of some
animals, even anxiety.
Small-breed puppies need to eat often, and rescued dogs in partic-
ular may feel stressed that they might not ever get fed again if feed-
ing is irregular. Doing so keeps puppies comfortably fueled and
assures rescue dogs that the new home is a place of abundance
and bounty, instead of deprivation.
Part II: Opening Your Home to Your Shih Tzu 
102

When planning your feeding schedule, remember that younger
Shih Tzu (under 12 weeks old) need to eat three to four times a
day. Puppies 12 to 24 months can eat two to three times a day.
After 24 months, your Shih Tzu can eat twice a day (but feed the
same amount of food — just divide it up into smaller portions).
Some people feed adult dogs just once a day, but I think two meals
are more satisfying — physically and emotionally — for all dogs.
Keep the following in mind:
 Choose two or three meal times every day, and stick to
them. These times are likely to be when you get up, midday,
and when you eat your dinner.
 Always feed your Shih Tzu at those times, in the same way,
in the same bowl, in the same place. If you have just one dog
and that dog doesn’t tend to overeat, you can leave food out
during the day. If you have more than one dog, feed them in
separate locations. Dogs have an instinct to guard their food
from other dogs who may steal it. Feeding dogs in different
places alleviates this anxiety.
 If you can’t get home during the middle of the day, someone
should come by to feed and pay attention to the dog. No
Shih Tzu should be left alone all day — that’s no way for a
companion dog to live. Pet sitters, dog walkers, and doggy
daycare centers are all good options. (For more on these
options, see Chapter 14.)
Set a regular chow time for your dog to spare him these physical
and emotional discomforts. This routine can help you in other
ways:
 Regular chow times mean regular bathroom times. If you
feed your dog on a schedule, she’ll poop on a schedule, too,
and that makes housetraining a lot easier.
 When you control the food, it shows your dog who’s boss.
Your dog looks to you as the benevolent giver of food, and
that’s a powerful person to be — somebody deserving of a
Shih Tzu’s worship. Your dog looks to you for direction in
other areas, too, so training basic cues like Sit and Stay are
easier.
 Regular feeding means less stress. Dogs get stressed out just
like humans. Regular feeding is one of the most important
things you can do to alleviate stress in your dog’s life, which
can make her healthier, calmer, and better behaved.
Chapter 8: Getting Through the First Few Days 103

Housetraining on time
When it comes to housetraining, timing is everything and routines
save the day (and the carpet). If you take your puppy outside on a
leash and wait for him to do his business at the same times every
day, he will learn much more quickly when and where to make those
little puppy puddles and piles. Chapter 16 tells you a whole lot more
about housetraining, too, and how to train your dog on a schedule.
The daily groom
You don’t absolutely need to groom your Shih Tzu every day, but I
recommend it. Daily grooming gives your dog something to look
forward to and becomes part of the comfortable and reassuring
routine. You get time together, and you’ll have an easier job with
coat care if you brush and comb through the coat every day.
Grooming a Shih Tzu becomes a bonding ritual, too, and that’s well
worth those five little minutes in the morning or evening (or when-
ever you choose to groom).
Every day, at the same time, call your Shih Tzu, put her in a special
spot such as on a table reserved just for grooming or on your lap
in a chair on the deck. Then brush, comb, apply moisturizing eye-
drops, wash her face, check her nails, and clip as necessary. Tell
her how gorgeous and glamorous she is. Mission accomplished.
(For more detailed info on grooming, see Chapter 10.)
Training and socializing
Every day reserve at least 15 minutes to spend totally focused on
your dog, no matter how long you have had her. Work on fun train-
ing exercises, tricks, and games like fetch. Practice cues like Sit and
Down (check out “Start Training, Without a Pro” later in this chap-
ter), or just hang out together on the couch. Also schedule in time
for socialization: walks through the neighborhood, a visit to a
neighbor, a play date with a doggy friend, or even a trip in the car
to an interesting new place (never leave your Shih Tzu in the car in
warm weather, even for a few minutes — Shih Tzu are very suscep-
tible to heatstroke).
Daily training and socialization quickly teach your Shih Tzu how to
get along in the world, and these daily routines also help forge a
strong bond between the two of you. (Check out Chapter 11 for
more on socializing your Shih Tzu.) Remember, your Shih Tzu is
your companion, and doing stuff together is the foundation for that
relationship.
Part II: Opening Your Home to Your Shih Tzu 
104

Exercise and play time
Shih Tzu don’t need nearly the high-energy exercise some breeds
do, but if they don’t get exercise, they won’t be as healthy or with-
stand the rigors of aging as well. Just like you, your Shih Tzu needs
to keep in shape.
Make sure you spend time playing and exercising with your new
dog every day. Some great games for a small dog include
 Fetch: Throw a ball or favorite toy, and encourage your Shih
Tzu to bring it back to you. Hey, it could happen.
 Hide and seek: Hide somewhere, and then call your Shih Tzu
to come and find you. Dogs love this game.
 Tag: Touch your Shih Tzu, and then run away. She’ll probably
chase you. Let her catch you, then chase her a short distance.
Repeat. (Don’t do this outside in hot weather — fortunately,
Shih Tzu don’t run too far so you can play this inside, too.)
 Walking: Stroll around the block and take in the sights. Fifteen
to 30 minutes at a moderate pace is plenty. What are the
neighbor dogs up to today?
Some exercises aren’t appropriate for Shih Tzu. Keep these impor-
tant warnings in mind to protect your Shih Tzu:
 Shih Tzu get heatstroke very easily. Their short noses and
long coats aren’t made for hot weather, so when the tempera-
ture and humidity rise, it’s best to stay inside. Shih Tzu also
aren’t built to run very far or very fast, so keep that in mind.
Don’t throw the ball too far.
 Shih Tzu can easily drown. A Shih Tzu in a full coat shouldn’t
swim because the coat can pull him under! Watch your dog
around water, especially a swimming pool where he may not
be able to get back out if he falls in. Take the same precau-
tions around water that you take with a small child. If your
Shih Tzu likes water, however, you can put about two inches
of water in a child’s swimming pool and let her romp around.
This is a great way for a dog to cool off in the heat (be sure
her coat is brushed before it gets wet, or it will tangle).
Try to schedule exercise at around the same time every day, no
matter what exercise you choose, just to reinforce, once again, the
routine. If your Shih Tzu knows she gets to play tag every time you
come home from work at 6, she’ll look forward to it and feel safe
and happy when the game starts on time.
Chapter 8: Getting Through the First Few Days 105

Nighty-night
You may not go to bed at the same time every night, and Samson
may wait for you to crawl under the covers before he hits the hay,
but sometimes, dogs choose their own bedtimes and go to bed
without you.
Even if bedtime doesn’t always happen at 10 p.m. sharp (or when-
ever), follow the same bedtime ritual every day to keep your Shih
Tzu feeling secure. Make sure you include these three parts:
 Calm down: Time to relax before bedtime. Stop playing with
your Shih Tzu about 30 minutes before bed. Relaxing on the
couch to read a book or watch television is fine.
 Potty break: Just before you put Samson down for the night,
take him outside for one last pit stop. He may not always go,
but if this is part of the routine, he’ll be more likely to do it,
and less likely to need to go out in the middle of the night.
 Bedtime announcement: Shih Tzu listen to what you say and
learn to understand certain words. If you say “Time for bed,”
or something similar to that every night when it’s time for
bed, your Shih Tzu soon knows what that means, and she’ll
probably beat you to the bedroom.
Make sure your Shih Tzu can get to his bed or kennel whenever he
needs to. If you can manage to go to bed and get up at about the
same time on most nights, your Shih Tzu appreciates the regularity
(and it’s good for you too — studies show you’ll get better sleep).
Either way, just be sure your Shih Tzu has the option to go to bed if
he wants to, and don’t be surprised if he stands in front of you and
gives you that look, as if to say, “Don’t you realize it’s bedtime
now? Get off the computer already!”
Start Training, Without a Pro
Many people enjoy taking their Shih Tzu puppies (or adults) to a
basic obedience or puppy socialization class. These classes can be
a lot of fun and they give your Shih Tzu opportunities to meet
other people and other dogs in a safe, structured environment. But
whether or not you do this, you can start teaching your Shih Tzu
some important cues and good manners, right from day one.
Spend a little time every day working with your Shih Tzu on man-
ners and training to help her know what you like and what you
want her to do. Shih Tzu are smart — she’ll pick it up quickly.
Part II: Opening Your Home to Your Shih Tzu 
106

But how do you tell your Shih Tzu what you want her to do? Dog
training is communication, so even spending time together makes
you a better dog trainer. You can motivate your dog into position
with a treat, then praise her and give her the treat when she does
what you want. You can praise her when she does something good
all on her own. And when she starts to do something wrong, you
can distract her into a good behavior and reward that. Training
isn’t hard — you’re simply rewarding the good stuff and convincing
your dog that you’re the source of all good things. Shih Tzu think
that anyway unless you prove them wrong, so training a Shih Tzu
is easy. You can start right now. This section helps you get started
on the right paw, but for more detailed information about training,
see Chapters 15, 16, and 17.
Remembering your Shih Tzu’s 
primary directive: companionship
One very important thing to remember about training a Shih Tzu is
that the Shih Tzu understands one thing ahead of all others: you.
He wants to be with you, near you, on you, next to you. He’s all
about you. (And isn’t that one of his best qualities?) When your
Shih Tzu behaves or does something you like, reward him with
time together, kind words, and affection. When your Shih Tzu does
something you don’t like, don’t punish him physically, but ignore
him for a few minutes. To a Shih Tzu, that sends a clear message:
If he wants your attention, he has to behave in a certain way.
Because the Shih Tzu is so in-tune to you, harsher training meth-
ods can be physically and psychologically damaging. I argue that
punishment, choke chains, yelling, nose flicking, and other such
training methods aren’t necessary for any breed, but a Toy breed
least of all. The Toy breeds’ size, sensitivity, and intuitive ability to
bond with humans as a lap dog make him entirely ill-suited for
these traditional training methods. Shih Tzu are intelligent and all
they need to learn quickly is repetition. Show him something a few
times, and Samson gets it.
The very best way to teach your Shih Tzu how to do something is
to put him in a position where he’s likely to do what you want, then
reward him lavishly when he does it. That’s a language your Shih
Tzu understands. But if he doesn’t do something that you want or
like, think about why. If he had an accident in the house, did you
take him out on time? If he nibbles your shoe, did you leave the
shoe out where your pup could get it? Or didn’t you provide him
with something to chew on instead? If he growls, what has scared
Chapter 8: Getting Through the First Few Days 107

or threatened him? Don’t ruin your good relationship by scolding.
Foster it by helping your Shih Tzu succeed and earn your praise.
(For more info on good methods to use for training your dog, see
Chapter 15.)
Using positive reinforcement:
What a good dog!
Whenever your Shih Tzu does something good, praise her. Praise
can come in many forms, from verbal praise (“What a good girl!”)
to treats (“Who deserves a liver snap?”). Always have a reward
ready to catch any and all good behavior. Pet owners often forget
to reward the good because they’re so busy shrieking “No!” Just
make sure you don’t always reward with a treat, or your Shih Tzu
may take in too many calories. Besides, Lola would rather have
your praise and affection.
Saying “No”
Sometimes, you have to say “No.” However the main purpose in a
loud sharp “No!” is that it distracts your Shih Tzu from the naughty
thing she’s doing and puts her attention on you, so you can then
immediately redirect her to something you do like. Then, of
course, comes the praise, the treats, and the reward.
When it comes to so-called bad behavior (or just plain doggy
behavior), remember that dogs desire your attention. When your
Shih Tzu does something you don’t like that doesn’t immediately
threaten him or your possessions, ignore it, and make sure nobody
else is accidentally rewarding his behavior. When your dog acts
naughty to get your attention, she will hate being ignored and is
likely to try something else to get you to turn around and look at
her. When she does choose a good activity instead of a naughty
one (like sitting down to look at you), start rewarding. (Check out
Chapters 15 and 17 for more ways to implement these strategies.)
Kids can follow rules too
One problem many families encounter with training is that one
person trains and everybody else ignores the rules. Doing so
undermines training and your Shih Tzu won’t understand the dif-
ferent directives. Everybody in the household must be in on the
rules, what behavior to reward, and what behavior needs a “No!”
and a quick redirect. Everyone should use the same cues (like the
Part II: Opening Your Home to Your Shih Tzu 
108

same word for Sit or Stay), and everyone should practice the same
kinds of techniques. Even young children can help by doing things
like totaling ignoring the dog when he jumps up on them but pet-
ting and playing with him when he sits nicely for attention. Don’t
count out the kids! Who knows, you may end up inspiring your
child to become the next great dog handler!
The easiest way to start training with the family is to teach kids
some easy ways to manage your Shih Tzu’s behavior (everybody
in the family should follow these strategies, not just kids):
 Don’t forget to reward a good dog. Remind children that
every time your Shih Tzu does something good, like sit nicely
when asked, greet someone without jumping up on them, or
act friendly to another dog, the child can say “Good dog!”
 When the dog is naughty, ignore her. Kids can learn to turn
their backs, look away, or walk away when the dog misbe-
haves. Make sure they know what constitutes misbehavior:
biting fingers and jumping up. Make sure your kids don’t
sneak extra food or treats to the Shih Tzu. They can acciden-
tally reward behavior you don’t want to reinforce.
 If the dog gets into something she shouldn’t, take it away.
Children should keep toys, socks, and other chewables off the
floor, and if the dog gets them, or any other forbidden object,
the child should take the item away calmly without yelling or
scolding. Also teach kids to replace the item with an accept-
able chew toy, instead of just taking something away from the
dog and leaving the dog with nothing. If the dog gets some-
thing better in return for the forbidden object, he understands
that the child is the source of good things and worthy of
notice, and he also learns what’s okay to chew and what isn’t.
If you have a rescued dog that guards her possessions and can
bite, have the child tell an adult if the dog has something she
shouldn’t have, instead of risk a bite. And seek professional
training! Resource guarding is easy to fix under professional
guidance. For more about how to address this problem, see
Chapter 11.
 Chill out. Kids can get pretty excited, jumping around and
shrieking and doing all the things active kids do, but this
behavior also excites the dog. Kids often get frustrated with
dogs that won’t stop jumping up, barking, and nipping, with-
out realizing they’re causing the behavior. Teach kids to be
calm around the dog. A calm child relaxes and reassures a
dog, and when the child calms down, the dog will too . . .
eventually.
Chapter 8: Getting Through the First Few Days 109

Is this behavior a problem?
In the first few days when you bring your new dog home, he may
need a few days to adjust to his new surroundings. However, a few
behaviors are cause for concern and warrant a call to a vet and
also to the breeder, just in case. If your Shih Tzu is a puppy, call
your vet and your breeder if:
 Your Shih Tzu shows complete disinterest in you and the envi-
ronment, acts depressed, or refuses to move.
 Your Shih Tzu hides and quivers for more than one whole day,
runs away whenever you try to touch her, or yelps when you
touch her.
 Your Shih Tzu growls and snaps constantly for no apparent
reason.
If you adopted an older rescued Shih Tzu, you may also need to
call a behaviorist to help you deal with aggression, which may not
seem serious in a small dog, but which can be very dangerous for
people, as well as for the dog. (For more on resolving behavior
problems, see Chapter 11. For more on Shih Tzu health issues,
see Chapter 13.)
Generally, the first few days with a new dog come with a few
surprises — both pleasant and unpleasant. With a steady routine,
plenty of supervision, and regular socialization and training, most
problems probably iron themselves out.

F
eeding a small dog can be a little tricky because small dogs
have small stomachs and fast metabolisms. Not much food fits
in a Shih Tzu at one time, so getting the right nutrition in every bite
counts. If you fill your Shih Tzu with junk or feed him too much,
you risk malnourishing and/or overfeeding him.
Today’s pet owners are more educated about pet food than ever
before, and dog food companies have responded by improving
their formulas over the past few years. But you’re standing in front
of the shelves lined with so many different foods, and you aren’t
sure how to choose. Are they all the same? No. Does it matter
which food you feed your Shih Tzu? Yes.
In this chapter, I cover some of the important basics of food: How
to pick the right food, how much to feed your Shih Tzu, how to set
a routine, and how to make sure your Shih Tzu is eating for opti-
mum health. So dive into that kibble bag and take a look around.
What Your Shih Tzu Needs, Not
What Your Shih Tzu Wants
Dogs are scavengers by nature, and if your Shih Tzu had her way,
she would probably eat whatever she could find. Fortunately,

however, you get to choose her food for her. You need to ensure
that your Shih Tzu eats healthful foods, rather than cheap junky
foods. A high-quality pet food includes the best combination of the
following ingredients:
 Proteins: They build muscle, organs, and all the tissues in the
body, plus they’re necessary for proper growth, healing, and
many necessary biochemical processes that go on inside
every dog’s (and every human’s) body.
 Fats: They provide concentrated energy, more than protein or
carbohydrates. They help build cells and help the body
absorb certain vitamins. They also insulate the body and pro-
tect the internal organs.
 Carbohydrates: They provide energy and fiber to help keep
your dog’s system running smoothly.
 Vitamins and minerals: Vitamins make enzyme reactions in
the body possible, and they also keep your dog’s metabolism
functioning properly. Minerals help build bones and teeth and
regulate fluid balance in the body, plus they help with an effi-
cient metabolism.
 Water: Your Shih Tzu is 60 to 70 percent water, and he needs
water every single day to stay alive, not to mention healthy
with well-lubricated joints. Water helps the entire body work
better. No one can survive without it.
These nutritional components come in many forms — meats,
organs, bone meal, grains, vegetables, and more. But having the
right protein, fat, carbs, vitamins, minerals, and moisture ratio in a
food isn’t enough. Those components have to come from healthy,
quality sources that your dog can absorb efficiently. Read the label
(check out “Reading the label” later in this chapter about decipher-
ing what’s in the food) to get an idea of what’s inside your dog’s
food. That’s the first step to deciding which diet is best for your dog.
Different Diets for Different Dogs
Who is your Shih Tzu? Is she a roly-poly puppy? A glamorous
grown-up? A sophisticated senior? Is she a little bit chubby? Does
she have arthritis or allergies? All these considerations can affect
what food you should choose for your Shih Tzu, and pet food man-
ufacturers make foods to meet all these needs.
Before you choose any food, you need to know what category your
Shih Tzu falls into:
Part III: Caring for Your Chinese Charmer 
114

 Puppy: Until your Shih Tzu is about a year old, a puppy for-
mula is probably best, unless your vet advises otherwise.
Puppy food is specifically formulated for growing dogs. Toy
breed or small breed puppy foods are even more specifically
made for dogs with tiny stomachs and quick metabolism who
need to eat nutrient-dense food often to stay energized.
 Adult: Adult formulas, for Shih Tzu who are 1 to 10 years old
(and even older, depending on your dog’s health), meet the
needs of active adult dogs of normal weight. Adult food isn’t
as high in calories as puppy food because the dog isn’t grow-
ing anymore, but it provides everything your dog needs to
maintain his body.
 Senior: Senior formulas may be lower in protein for dogs with
kidney problems, or they may contain high protein to help
keep aging muscles strong. Some contain fewer calories
because many seniors slow down and use fewer calories, and
these foods can prevent dogs from becoming overweight as
they age. Many also contain added ingredients for digestion,
healthy joints, and healthy skin and coat.
However, many vets believe you shouldn’t switch your dog to
a senior formula unless she actually starts to show signs of
aging, and then, her particular health issues determine which
food is best. If she still acts healthy, pain-free, and active, stick
with the adult food, unless your vet advises otherwise.
 Breed-specific: Manufacturers love a niche market and have
created foods designed for specific breeds or groups of dogs.
There may be a Shih Tzu food, although I haven’t seen it.
However, I have seen Toy and small breed foods, which are
designed for dogs that need nutrient-dense food to provide
their small stomachs and tiny bodies with adequate nutrition.
Small breed kibble also has smaller pieces so it’s easier to
chew.
 Weight control: Shih Tzu getting a little tubby? A weight con-
trol formula may be the answer, although many people can
control their pets’ weight with a little exercise, smaller por-
tions, and fewer treats. Because Shih Tzu are small, you only
need small changes to help them lose weight. (For more on
weight control, see the section “Monitoring Your Shih Tzu’s
Waistline,” later in this chapter.)
 Prescription diets: You can’t buy prescription diet food in
the pet store, but your vet can prescribe a special diet if your
Shih Tzu needs one for a medical condition, such as allergies,
diabetes, digestive disorders, kidney disease, even cognitive
decline with old age (similar to Alzheimer’s disease in
humans). If your Shih Tzu has a medical condition, talk to
your vet to see if a prescription food can help.
Chapter 9: Feeding Your Shih Tzu Nutritious (and Yummy) Food 115

Above all, if you question what food to feed your dog of any age or
problem, consult your veterinarian.
Choosing the Right 
Food for Your Dog
What works to keep your dog healthy may not work as well to keep
another dog healthy. You may choose a food based on your dog’s
age, breed, or health issues, or you may choose one based on your
own preferences as well as what’s best for your dog. As long as the
food is high quality and nutritionally complete and your dog likes
the food and does well on the food, that’s great. This section helps
you make the decision about which dog food to feed your Shih Tzu.
What your Shih Tzu used to eat
Your breeder, or whoever had your dog before you, was feeding
your Shih Tzu something. Make sure you know what this food is, so
you can decide if you want to keep feeding it or change to some-
thing else based on your dog’s needs or your own preferences.
Because a dog can experience some gastrointestinal distress if you
switch a food too suddenly or drastically, be sure to transition
from one food to another gradually, mixing in a little bit of the new
food with the old food at first, and then increasing the amount of
new food bit by bit over the course of a few days.
Many breeders even send you home with a small bag of your Shih
Tzu’s food so you can have something to feed your dog until you
get to the store and something to use while transitioning to a dif-
ferent food if you decide to switch foods.
What your vet recommends
If you aren’t sure what food to feed your Shih Tzu, your vet may
have a great suggestion for you. Your vet may know that your
Shih Tzu is prone to allergies and can recommend a food designed
for Toy breeds that isn’t likely to aggravate those allergies. Or she
may prefer organic pet food or raw food for your Shih Tzu’s indi-
vidual needs because she believes these foods offer superior
nutrition.
Part III: Caring for Your Chinese Charmer 
116

On the other hand, many vets stock certain food because they
have contracts with particular pet food companies to carry that
brand. In some cases, these foods are great. However, don’t just
assume you’re getting the best food if you buy the food at the vet’s
office. Always read the food label. (For more information on read-
ing the label, see the next section.)
Organic options
You may live a holistic lifestyle and want to feed an organic, home-
made, or raw diet to your dog, too. These diets have become
increasingly popular as people choose healthier diets for them-
selves. For more on dietary options, see the sidebar, “What about
holistic, natural, and organic foods?” later in this chapter.
Reading the Label
Empowered pet food buyers read dog food labels to find out exactly
what’s in that food and whether it’s not just adequate but truly
healthful. (Check out Figure 9-1 for an example of a dog food label.)
You don’t have to understand every single word on the label, but
most of the words should make sense. The following sections
cover what you do need to look for on labels.
AAFCO statement
The very first thing to look for on the pet food you’re considering
is the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO)
statement. Dog foods that display this statement have been
proven, through feeding trials to be complete and balanced nutri-
tion for dogs of a certain stage, such as puppies or adult dogs. It’s
usually worded something like this:
Feeding tests using the procedures established by the
Association of American Feed Control Officials substantiate
that this food provides complete and balanced nutrition for all
life stages.
If a food doesn’t have an AAFCO statement, it’s probably meant to
be a treat. Don’t use it as your dog’s primary diet. This statement
doesn’t state that the food is the best food out there, but the state-
ment does mean that dogs can live on that food without any other
supplementation, according to approved feeding tests.

Figure 9-1: A dog-food nutrition label.
Ingredients list
The ingredients list gives you the info that helps you make the
best decision about what to feed your Shih Tzu. This list contains
everything in the food, in order by weight. For instance, if the first
ingredient is chicken, the food contains more chicken, by weight,
than any other single ingredient. If the first ingredient is rice, the
food contains more rice than any other single ingredient.

118

When you read the ingredients list, you may notice several ingredi-
ents that you don’t understand. How do you know what you’re put-
ting in your dog’s little body, and how do you know if the food is
actually good for your dog? Some of the main ingredients you may
see include the following:
 By-products are non-muscle-meat parts. Some people believe
by-products are natural food for dogs who would eat the
whole animal in the wild. Others suspect that by-products are
the worst parts of the animal unfit for consumption and that
these parts can lead to diseases like cancer and chronic con-
ditions like allergies. I can’t tell you for sure one way or the
other — it’s a controversial subject among pet food people.
Talk to your vet, or avoid foods that contain by-products in
the ingredients list, if they worry you.
 Meal in the form of meat or grain has the water removed so
it’s a more concentrated, more processed, source of protein
or carbs.
 Long chemical names are often added vitamins, and the label
should tell you this in parenthesis after the name. Pet food
labels are getting better than they used to be about putting
things in plain language or defining terms.
Knowing a good ingredient list when you see it
The ingredients list is informative but not necessarily straightfor-
ward. Dogs need digestible protein, and many books and magazine
articles tell pet owners to look for meat protein listed first in the
ingredients because studies prove dogs digest meat protein better
than protein from vegetable sources like grains.
But here’s the tricky part: Even though ingredients are listed in
order according to how much of that ingredient is in the food, you
have to look at the ingredients together to get a good idea of
what’s really going on.
For example, the beginning of your ingredients list may read as fol-
lows: “Chicken, chicken meal, brewers rice, chicken broth, whole
oats, fish oil.” This list has more meat sources and fewer grain
sources in the first few ingredients. In other words, when you look
at the first six, eight, or ten ingredients, you want to see more
instances of meat than grain.
But what if the list starts out like this: “Corn, rice, chicken, corn
meal, meat by-products, wheat . . . “ This list has more grain sources
in the first few ingredients, and probably isn’t as good a source of
concentrated nutrition, especially protein.
Chapter 9: Feeding Your Shih Tzu Nutritious (and Yummy) Food 119

Some high-end foods contain no grain at all because some people
(and some pet food companies) believe dogs shouldn’t eat any
grain. Also, dogs can have grain allergies. For a healthy dog, small
amounts of grain are probably okay (talk to your vet if you aren’t
sure), but you don’t want to feed your dog mostly grain.
Plus, not all grains are created equal. Some people believe that
many dogs are allergic to corn and wheat, so these items are less
desirable ingredients than rice or oatmeal, which tends to be less
allergenic. The bottom line: Dogs aren’t designed to live on corn.
Part III: Caring for Your Chinese Charmer 
120
What about holistic, natural, and
organic foods?
The biggest growing pet food segment today is the organic segment, and many pet
food labels now contain buzzwords like holistic, natural, and organic.
The following list can help you decipher what these terms really mean when you
see them on a dog food label.
 Holistic: If a food is holistic, it theoretically contains ingredients good for the
whole animal, but this term isn’t regulated. If a manufacturer says the food is
holistic, that just means the manufacturer says the food is holistic. If you trust
the manufacturer, you may choose to believe the food is a good one. However,
the law doesn’t have any official definition for the term holistic.
 Natural: This term is a regulated term. If a food says it’s natural, then legally,
the food can’t contain any artificial ingredients, such as chemical preservatives.
Some companies get around this by using the word in a way that allows them
to use some artificial ingredients, such as by saying “with natural ingredients.”
That means some of the ingredients are natural.
 Organic: This term has been regulated by the USDA since October 2002 as it
applies to human food. As of 2007, the term has a separate (but mostly the same)
definition as it applies to pet food. In general, if a food says it’s organic, it must
contain at least 95 percent organic ingredients. That means those ingredients
must have been grown in a system that promotes the natural ecological cycle
and that are generally not polluted with chemicals like pesticides, herbicides,
growth hormones, or antibiotics. Organic animals must be fed organic food and
treated humanely. Organic products must come from USDA-certified produc-
ers. If a food says made with organic ingredients, the specific organic ingredi-
ents will be listed on the ingredients list, but the whole product wouldn’t legally
be organic.
Natural and organic foods are more expensive, but for many pet owners, it’s an eth-
ical choice, and the cost is well worth the health benefits they believe their animals
will enjoy, as well as the environmental benefits to the world.

They’re designed to live on all the parts of small animals, from
their bones and marrow, muscles and organs, to their half-digested
stomach contents. Gross? Yes. True? Absolutely. The more a food
ingredient list looks like the parts of a small animal, the better.
What else should be in there?
So far, you’re looking for meat protein and a lot of it. You want to
see chicken, lamb, turkey, fish, or other meat sources at the begin-
ning of the list. What else do you want to see?
Many foods today contain vegetables and fruits, which add vita-
mins and fiber. Personally, I would rather see things like carrots,
yogurt, blueberries, and salmon meal than long chemical names.
Let common sense play a big part in your label scrutiny. If you
can’t pronounce it, do you really want your dog to eat it?
Considering Your Main
Choices for Dog Food
Dog food comes in many different forms, and each form has its
advantages and disadvantages. This section looks at your main
options. You can buy your dog’s food (store bought), make your
own dog food (homemade), or even mix it up.
Store bought
Most pet owners buy their dog food in the store, which is easier,
more convenient, faster, and less messy. Buying your dog’s food
can cost more than making it yourself, but you pay for the conven-
ience, as well as the quality. If you’ve looked carefully at the dog
food label and chosen a food based on healthy ingredients (see the
previous section for more about reading the label), you probably
notice that it costs more than foods with lesser ingredients (like
more corn and wheat, less poultry and meat).
In most cases, premium brands are more expensive for good
reason — the ingredients really are more digestible, less processed,
and/or more humanely produced. And premium foods, to be quite
frank, result in smaller, less stinky poop. The dog digests more of
the ingredients so less comes out the other end, and that, for many
pet owners, is worth the cost alone. But premium food from the
store comes in several different forms — kibble, canned, and
frozen raw. Which type you choose depends on you and your dog,
but the next section give you some things to consider.
Chapter 9: Feeding Your Shih Tzu Nutritious (and Yummy) Food 121

Kibble
Kibble is the most popular form of pet food. Kibble is so popular
because of the many advantages of feeding it to your dog. To help
you make a decision whether kibble is right for your dog, here are
some pros and cons:
 Pros
• Kibble is convenient. Feeding your dog doesn’t take
long. Just pour and measure.
• Kibble lasts longer without it spoiling. It lasts up to
three or four weeks.
• Kibble costs less than other kinds of food of equal
quality. Saving money is good, right?
• Most dogs like kibble. It’s crunchy, it’s meaty . . . it’s
delicious!
• Kibble is good for your dog’s teeth. Some vets believe
that kibble keeps teeth cleaner. Kibble can be particu-
larly good for Shih Tzu, who can lose teeth early. Some
breeders believe that along with yearly dental appoint-
ments, feeding kibble helps strengthen Shih Tzu’s teeth
so they don’t fall out.
 Cons
• Some picky dogs don’t like kibble. It doesn’t look or
taste anything like meat.
• Some Shih Tzu have dental problems. Chewing kibble
is more difficult with sore or missing teeth.
• Kibble is highly processed. People who want to feed a
more natural diet may feel kibble is too processed.
If you choose kibble for your Shih Tzu, choose a premium brand
made for small dogs, and don’t buy more than your Shih Tzu can
eat in three to four weeks, after which time the fats in the kibble
can get rancid and the food can get stale. Keep kibble in an airtight
container so it stays fresh longer.
You may have to try a few brands before you find one with an
acceptable ingredients list and a taste your Shih Tzu likes. Don’t
buy the largest bag of food in the store. Instead buy a small bag of
food to make sure your dog likes it first. Your dog may not like that
super-healthy food with the picture-perfect ingredients list. A great
food won’t do your Shih Tzu any good if he isn’t going to eat it.
Part III: Caring for Your Chinese Charmer 
122

Canned
Canned food costs more than kibble but tastes more like meat and
many dogs prefer the taste of canned food. Choose a premium
brand with quality meat sources in the first few ingredients and
not too much grain. Also choose a brand without artificial colors,
sweeteners, and chemical preservatives.
Canned food doesn’t keep for more than a few days after you open
the can (always store opened cans in the refrigerator), and you
have to keep it covered. Premium brands contain good meat pro-
tein, but some vets think canned food can contribute to dental
plaque (other vets don’t agree with this). Too much canned food
can also cause runny stools in some dogs.
Many people choose to put a spoonful of canned with a little kibble
for their Shih Tzu, to get the benefits of both. For info on kibble
and mixing it with canned food, see the “Mixing it up” section, a
little later in this chapter.
Frozen raw
The raw food diet consists of feeding your dog raw meat, along
with fresh fruits and vegetables (finely chopped) and in many
cases, raw bones. Sometimes, this diet is called the BARF diet (an
acronym for Biologically Appropriate Raw Food or Bones And Raw
Food, depending on whom you ask). This diet is controversial
because some vets insist dogs can get food poisoning from the
pathogens in raw meat.
Raw meat from a store isn’t as fresh or pathogen-free as raw meat
from a freshly killed animal. Some pets have suffered food poison-
ing from raw food, although this is very rare. Handling raw meat
isn’t something humans are always keen to do, and preparation
can be time consuming, plus it can be tricky getting the right nutri-
tional balance with a raw meat because dogs can’t live on meat
alone. Feeding prepared raw diets you can buy in the pet store
make this part easier.
But what about the upside? Many vets and pet owners swear that
health problems clear up almost miraculously when they switch
pets to a raw diet and that the dog’s digestive system can handle it.
Many dogs with skin allergies and other chronic conditions like
arthritis, kidney disease, and diabetes improve on a raw food diet.
Raw diets mimic what dogs eat in the wild, so they may be closer
to what a dog’s supposed to eat to be healthy. Very few wild dogs
are overweight, while many pets are. Plus, heating kills many of the
natural enzymes in food, but raw food leaves these enzymes intact.
Chapter 9: Feeding Your Shih Tzu Nutritious (and Yummy) Food 123

Many canine nutritionists believe these enzymes are necessary for
health and that even dogs on a manufactured food diet should get
at least some raw food every day.
So, what am I saying? Are raw diets good or bad? The truth is prob-
ably that it depends on the individual dog. Because this diet is so
controversial, talk to your vet before switching your Shih Tzu to a
raw diet. Holistic vets are more likely to be open to the idea, and
may have information to help guide you.
Homemade and delicious
What on earth did pet owners do before dog food was invented
just a few decades ago? They fed their pets the food they were
eating (or, the leftovers). Some people feel very strongly that dogs,
as well as humans, aren’t meant to eat processed food, but they
should eat fresh natural foods, including meat, vegetables, fruits,
and so on. Many of these people make foods for their pets at home,
either giving them the leftovers from their own healthy meals (no
junk food!) or preparing special meals just for their pets, such as
boiled chicken and oatmeal with ground carrots and green beans,
or ground beef with brown rice mixed with chopped leafy greens
and yogurt.
Talk to your vet if you want to feed your dog a homemade diet. You
have to make sure your dog has the right nutrients she needs —
without them, your dog could suffer from malnutrition. However, if
you discover what to do, feeding a nutritionally complete home-
made diet isn’t hard (although it can be time-consuming). If you
have the inclination and the time, get solid advice from your vet,
and go for it. Your Shih Tzu will probably love it.
A few human foods can be toxic to dogs. Check out “Avoiding not-
so-healthy treats” later in this chapter for a list of foods to avoid.
Mixing it up
If you’re like me, you may want the best of all possible worlds: The
convenience of kibble, the nutritional benefits of natural foods, the
palatability of canned and real fresh meat, and the benefits of cer-
tain raw foods. With the thumbs-up from your vet, you can com-
bine these approaches.
One day, put a spoonful of canned food in with the kibble. Mix in
some pot roast and mashed carrots or bits of chicken and brown
rice the next day. Try some hardboiled eggs with oatmeal in the
mornings, turkey with chopped collard greens and apples at night.
Part III: Caring for Your Chinese Charmer 
124

Or, feed kibble in the mornings and frozen raw food in the evenings.
You may even throw your Shih Tzu the occasional raw bone (never
cooked, which can splinter and injure the dog). With guidance from
your vet and a little experimenting to see how your Shih Tzu
responds, you’ll hit on just the right diet for you and your dog.
Don’t forget water
Your Shih Tzu must have a constant accessible supply of fresh
water every day. Dogs who eat a diet of kibble are even more in
need of water because kibble doesn’t contain as much moisture as
canned food and homemade food. Water keeps your Shih Tzu’s
body and organ systems functioning properly. Without it, your Shih
Tzu can get sick.
Check the water bowl or bottle often throughout the day to make
sure it’s always full and clean. Don’t just top it off — at least daily,
dump the water, rinse the container, and refill. Wash the water
bowl or bottle at least once a week with soap and hot water or in
the dishwasher to make sure it stays clean and free of bacteria. If
you don’t use a water bowl, you may consider a water bottle. For
more on choosing a water bowl or bottle, see Chapter 5.
Developing a Regular 
Meal Routine
Some Shih Tzu can be picky eaters. Others can be real chow
hounds. Either way, a regular meal schedule can teach your Shih
Tzu that she gets to eat at a certain time but not all the time. A
schedule also helps picky eaters accept food more readily and
keeps chow hounds from begging too much when it isn’t time for
dinner. (But don’t be surprised if your Shih Tzu reminds you if you
forget that it really is dinnertime!) Remember that dogs love rou-
tine (check out Chapter 8 for more on establishing a routine). They
also love to eat. A regular meal routine combines two of your dog’s
favorite things into one happily daily ritual.
Your routine should include at least two and possibly even three
daily meals, always at the same time. Small dogs do better if they
eat more often, and once a day just isn’t enough to keep a small
dog’s metabolism fired up properly, so they have energy and their
bodies work efficiently. Plus, more meals mean more elements to
that valuable routine. Just be sure to divide the same amount of
food over the various meals so you don’t feed your dog too much.
Chapter 9: Feeding Your Shih Tzu Nutritious (and Yummy) Food 125

Some people free-feed their dogs, leaving food out all the time, but
this only works if you have just one pet. Otherwise, your Shih Tzu
may feel compelled to eat too often, just to protect her food.
Giving Treats
Look at that face. Those adorable pleading eyes. How can you not
give your Shih Tzu just a little treat . . . and then maybe just one
more? Treats are wonderful for special occasions and for training,
but Shih Tzu can become overweight easily, so treats are best
when doled out sparingly. This section helps you identify healthy
treats and not-so-healthy treats.
Choosing healthy treats
Look for treats with healthy ingredients like fresh meat and whole
grains, and read the label. You don’t want artificial colors, salt,
sweeteners such as corn syrup or other chemical ingredients like
propylene glycol in your Shih Tzu’s treats! Gourmet dog treats
from a dog bakery can be delicious and healthy, but ask what’s in
the treat.
Some healthy treats can come right out of your refrigerator:
 Baby carrots
 Blueberries, strawberries, or any other berry you would eat
 Small broccoli florets
 Tiny bits of chicken, turkey, or fish
 A spoonful of plain, nonfat yogurt or lowfat cottage cheese
For training, use very tiny treats or pieces of treats. Also be sure
the treats you feed your Shih Tzu are just as healthy as her reg-
ular diet. No matter how healthy the treat, always feed treats in
moderation — no more than one or two each day.
Avoiding not-so-healthy treats
Those yummy-looking packaged treats in the grocery store are just
about as healthy as the highly processed packaged treats kids beg
their parents to buy. By that, I mean not very healthy. Dog treats are
usually too big for a small dog and way too full of preservatives,
sugar, and artificial ingredients. Some have even been linked to
choking and other medical problems.
Part III: Caring for Your Chinese Charmer 
126

Some human foods aren’t good for dogs. Watch out for the follow-
ing items:
 Liver and processed meat like lunch meat, hot dogs, and
pepperoni: Liver can cause loose stools in some dogs,
although dogs love the taste. Also avoid too much processed
meat, like hot dogs, bologna, and sausages. These contain too
much salt and fat and too many preservatives for regular con-
sumption, although some people like to give their pets tiny
bits every now and then.
 Junk food and processed food: If you got it from a fast food
restaurant, don’t give it to your dog, with the exception of
small bits of meat without the fried coating.
 High-fat cheese: Most dogs don’t digest cheese very well, but
some enjoy small bits of low-fat cheese like mozzarella or cot-
tage cheese. High-fat cheese is too fattening for dogs, and too
much cheese in general means too much salt.
 Anything containing sugar and/or white flour: Bad for you
but very bad for a small dog.
Some foods are downright toxic. Never give your dog the following
foods:
 Onions: They contain a toxic ingredient called thiosulphate
that can cause hemolytic anemia. Symptoms include vomiting
and diarrhea, weakness, bloody urine, and even death.
 Grapes and raisins: They can cause kidney failure.
 Macadamia nuts: They contain a toxin that causes neurologi-
cal symptoms like weakness, tremors, and temporary paraly-
sis, as well as pain.
 Chocolate and cocoa powder: They’re very toxic to many
dogs because of the stimulants: caffeine and the theobromine.
The darker the chocolate, the more toxic it is.
 Alcohol, coffee, coffee grounds, tea, tea bags, and tobacco
products: Alcohol and the stimulants in coffee, tea, and
tobacco can have a toxic effect on a small dog. Even if you’ve
seen big dogs lap up beer at parties, don’t even think about
doing this to your Shih Tzu. You can poison him.
Giving Your Dog Supplements
Many people take nutritional supplements to support good health
or even to cure health problems. So does it work for pets, too?
Chapter 9: Feeding Your Shih Tzu Nutritious (and Yummy) Food 127

If you feed your dog an excellent diet (see “Choosing the Right
Food for Your Dog”), you probably don’t need to feed her a multivi-
tamin supplement. However, whole-food supplements can add
important and beneficial dietary components to a processed pet
food diet.
Pet supplements can’t state on the label that they treat, prevent, or
cure any disease, but you may hear stories of how these supple-
ments did just that. Take these testimonials with a grain of salt, but
don’t entirely dismiss the potential benefit of supplements, either.
Scientific studies have shown that glucosamine and chondroitin,
for example, really do minimize signs of pain in arthritic pets, but
studies on other supplements are, so far, pretty minimal.
Nevertheless, that doesn’t mean supplements won’t help or benefit
your pet. Some of the most popular and most common include
supplements to support joint function, healthy skin and coat, and
digestive issues, and to put back live enzymes in the diet.
Some herbal and homeopathic formulas may also help with kidney
and liver problems, diabetes, arthritis, allergies, and stress and
anxiety, even if they can’t say this in so many words. Many people
use these supplements in conjunction with conventional therapy
(always tell your vet if you give your pet any supplements). Talk to
your vet if you’re curious about supplements, and always buy sup-
plements formulated for pets, not people, to avoid giving the
wrong dosage.
Monitoring Your Shih Tzu’s
Waistline
Is your Shih Tzu just a little too chubby? Even a two-pound weight
gain in a small dog is a lot of weight on a ten-pound dog. That’s like
a 150-pound person gaining 30 pounds! Extra weight puts strain on
internal organs like the heart and lungs, stresses joints making
them more prone to arthritis, and contributes to a host of chronic
diseases as your dog gets older. Some Shih Tzu can also be under-
weight, although this issue is less common. These dogs can be
underweight because of a health issue or just because they’re
extra finicky, and they may not be getting the proper nutrition to
stay healthy.
This section addresses overweight and underweight dogs and
helps you identify if your dog has a weight problem.
Part III: Caring for Your Chinese Charmer 
128

Portion size
Portion size matters, especially for small dogs, who can gain too
much weight if they eat even a little bit too much. Every dog’s dif-
ferent, and the amount you feed your dog depends on your dog’s
individual metabolism and activity level. Dog food bags and cans
often recommend more than dogs should really eat unless they’re
extremely active (which most Shih Tzu aren’t).
A good place to start is on the very low end of the recommended
portion on the dog food label. If this amount keeps your Shih Tzu
at a healthy weight (which is 9 to 16 pounds), you’re on the right
track. If your Shih Tzu gets too thin, increase the amount by just a
tablespoon. If your Shih Tzu gets too heavy, decrease the amount
by a tablespoon, even if it’s less than the lower limit the dog food
label suggests.
Watching for signs of obesity
According to many vets, being overweight is the number one most
common health problem among companion animals today. But
your Shih Tzu doesn’t have to suffer that fate, as long as you moni-
tor what he eats and make sure he gets enough exercise. The Shih
Tzu breed standard states a Shih Tzu between 9 and 101⁄2 inches 
at the shoulder should weigh between 9 and 16 pounds. However,
despite what the scale says, your Shih Tzu may be overweight for
her build.
Determining whether your Shih Tzu is becoming overweight under
that fluffy coat can be difficult, so to monitor your Shih Tzu’s waist-
line, you need to use your hands. Feel your Shih Tzu’s ribs. If you
can’t feel them at all, and if you can feel no discernible waist curv-
ing in from your Shih Tzu’s ribcage, your pup is probably over-
weight.
Talk to your vet to confirm your findings and then ask about the
best way to get your pet back to a healthy weight. If your Shih Tzu
gained weight suddenly, he could have a medical problem, so be
sure to mention this to your vet.
Looking out for signs of an
underweight Shih Tzu
If your Shih Tzu weighs less than 9 pounds and you can easily feel
her ribs, and if she has a dramatic tuck-in below the rib cage, she
Chapter 9: Feeding Your Shih Tzu Nutritious (and Yummy) Food 129

may be underweight. A sudden weight loss can also indicate a
medical condition. If you think your Shih Tzu is underweight, talk
to your vet about it. She may recommend a special food or high-
calorie supplementation to get your Shih Tzu back on the right
track.

I
f you line up all dog breeds, a Shih Tzu starts to look like a
pretty easy breed to own . . . that is, until you remember how
much grooming work you have to do. That long hair requires main-
tenance, if not extensive primping. Otherwise, your dog will be
pretty unhappy and possibly (gasp!) unattractive. Even if you keep
your Shih Tzu in a short haircut, you still need to do regular
grooming maintenance. It’s an essential chore.
Many breeds don’t require daily grooming, but a Shih Tzu will be
happier and healthier if you groom him daily. You don’t have to
spend a long time doing it, but a daily grooming is important in
even more ways than keeping your Shih Tzu clean and presentable.
A daily grooming session provides you with an opportunity to
monitor your Shih Tzu’s physical well being more closely than if
you were just mindlessly petting your Shih Tzu or carrying her
around in your handbag. This chapter helps you navigate through
the hardest and most labor-intensive part of owning a Shih Tzu.
Teaching Puppies to Love
Grooming Now
Just try grooming an adult dog who’s never been groomed before
and you can see why teaching very young puppies about the

grooming routine is important. Adult dogs can be scared of groom-
ing equipment, resistant to paw and ear touching, and won’t sit
still when you try to tease out the tangles. The grooming routine is
one of the most important routines to get your dog used to while
she’s still young. If a puppy learns that grooming is part of her reg-
ular day, she even looks forward to the love and attention. She’ll
also love how great she feels when she’s smooth, clean, and spiffy.
Puppies lose their puppy coats and grow into their adult coats
between six months and one year, but before that happens, start
grooming. During the coat transition time, you’ll need to brush out
the shedding hair every day to keep it from tangling, and if your
puppy isn’t used to this yet, it won’t be easy for anyone. Your puppy
may not actually need much grooming before this difficult stage, but
the point is to get her used to the routine — the time, the place, the
tools, and the feel of grooming. You can begin grooming the very
first day you bring your puppy home, and I recommend this because
it immediately sets the standard for her life in your home.
A puppy doesn’t need an all-out grooming session just yet, so for
now, spend just five or ten minutes every day following these
steps, talking gently and encouragingly throughout the process:
1. Feel all over your Shih Tzu’s body, giving him a gentle
massage.
This procedure loosens dead hair and skin and also alerts
you to any skin or body changes. It also relaxes your
Shih Tzu.
2. Very gently brush your puppy’s coat with a soft natural-
bristle brush.
3. Gently comb your puppy’s coat with a steel comb.
4. Wash your puppy’s face with a soft washcloth, and wipe
gently under her eyes.
At this step, apply moisturizing eyedrops if your breeder
and/or vet recommend them.
5. Touch each toe with the nail clippers designed just for
small dogs, and clip off just the very tip of one nail
per day.
6. Touch each paw and press gently on each paw pad.
7. Check Lola’s rear end to be sure it’s clean.
Carefully clip away any hair getting in the way of your Shih
Tzu’s rear (use a blunt-tipped grooming scissors), and wipe
her rear clean with a disposable, hypoallergenic baby wipe
if it looks soiled.
Part III: Caring for Your Chinese Charmer 
132

8. Fix her topknot so her ribbon, barrette, or band looks
straight and pretty, and tell her how beautiful she is.
9. Repeat daily.
Wasn’t that fun? Your Shih Tzu will think so if you do this
every day. Pretty soon, she’ll look forward to these fun
times together . . . and so will you. (Check out Figure 10-1.)
Figure 10-1: Brushing your dog is a great way to build camaraderie.
Considering Your Style Options
Your Shih Tzu puppy may not have a lot of hair yet, but before
long, he will, and you have to decide what you want to do with it.
Do you want to keep it show-dog long or maintain that cute puppy
look with a short puppy cut? This section considers the pros and
cons of longer and shorter styles.
Long and lovely
Something about a Shih Tzu in a full-length coat is just so glamorous.
The long coat feels and looks gorgeous, and your dog will certainly
get noticed. Show dogs have long coats and aren’t supposed to be
trimmed very much, except to straighten the ends and trim around
the feet and the rear end for neatness. But, a long coat takes a lot of
work because the Shih Tzu has a double coat — a downy undercoat
with a longer, smoother layer on top. This kind of coat can tangle
easily when the undercoat sheds and gets caught in the outer coat.
Chapter 10: Making Your Baby Beautiful: Time to Groom 133

You need to bathe and blow dry your Shih Tzu about every three
weeks, and spend quality time brushing and combing every day. If
you don’t have the time, you need to take your dog to a profes-
sional groomer for these chores every month. Also consider that
coat quality is genetic. Some dogs have coats that tangle much
faster than others. The more you groom your own dog, the more
you get to know his coat and how often you need to brush it.
Short and sassy
Shih Tzu puppies in their fluffy, furry coats look so adorable that
many people want to maintain that puppy cut even when their Shih
Tzu grow up. (Check out “Styling the short coat” later in this chap-
ter for more info.) A monthly trip to the groomer is all it takes:
snip, clip, and you have one cute little Shih Tzu. Or, you can learn
to clip your dog’s hair yourself, to save a few bucks.
A Shih Tzu in a short coat takes a lot less daily grooming time than
a Shih Tzu in full coat, even though you still need to brush and
comb through the coat on most days. If you like the idea of a low-
maintenance do, then short and sassy is probably the “do” for you
(I mean for your dog).
Doing the Grooming Yourself or
Hiring a Professional
Some people just love to do things themselves: home improve-
ment, home-cooked meals, home-groomed dogs. Grooming a Shih
Tzu can be time consuming, but it isn’t necessarily difficult. If you
keep up daily grooming, then you can do a more extensive groom-
ing session once a month.
Hiring a pro costs money, of course, but you also get to drop off a
scruffy dog and pick up a freshly washed and coiffed beauty.
Mobile groomers even come to your house. Whether you keep
your dog’s coat long or want it cut short, you may prefer to have a
professional handle the more extensive grooming tasks. Many Shih
Tzu owners feel that the cost of professional grooming is well
worth the time saved and are happy to pay for a good groomer’s
expertise. (Costs vary quite a bit depending on the groomer and
where you live. Call first to get an idea of price.)
Part III: Caring for Your Chinese Charmer 
134

The decision is, obviously, up to you — what are you willing to do
yourself, and what are you willing to pay for? This section helps
you make those decisions.
Going it alone
If you decide to be your Shih Tzu’s groomer, you can start sham-
pooing, snipping, or clipping to your heart’s content. Or, you can
get some professional input about which products work best and
the smart way to cut a dog’s hair short (if that’s what you want to
do). Pros can also give you tips on removing mats, keeping eyes
clean, poofing the topknot in show-dog style, and other Shih Tzu
tips. Talk to your dog’s breeder, breeders and handlers at dog
shows, or even a professional groomer willing to show you some
tricks of the trade. You can’t substitute a professional’s advice.
Grooming a Shih Tzu is a learning process. Your first attempt at a
puppy clip may not look so cute, but fortunately, Shih Tzu hair
keeps growing and your mistakes soon grow out, giving you the
opportunity to try again . . . and again, until you finally hit on the
perfect grooming products, routines, and haircut for your Shih Tzu.
Different products work best for different dogs, too, so you may
need to try a few different shampoos, conditioners, tear stain
removers, and other products before you find the one you like.
(For a complete list of products you need, check out “Grooming
Tools and Products: A Primer” later in this chapter.)
Seeking out a groomer
A professional groomer (see Figure 10-2) bathes, shampoos, condi-
tions, and blow-dries your dog, styling the coat and doing up the
topknot (if your dog’s hair is long on his head). The groomer also
trims hair around the rear and paws, neatens up the coat, and
trims your dog’s nails, if necessary. Or, if you like a short cut, the
groomer uses scissors and, in many cases, an electric clipper to
give your dog his “do.”
If you decide to have your Shih Tzu professionally groomed, you
should take him to the groomer about every month if he has a long
coat or every six to eight weeks for a short cut. Some groomers
work out of pet shops, while others have their own facilities. To
find a good groomer, ask friends with long-coated dogs which
groomer they recommend, or talk to your dog’s breeder or veteri-
narian. You can also find groomers listed in the phone book.
Chapter 10: Making Your Baby Beautiful: Time to Groom 135

Figure 10-2: A professional groomer can treat your Shih Tzu like royalty.
Many groomers go to school to study professional grooming and
some have certificates or registrations as professional groomers,
but these licensures aren’t regulated and groomers aren’t required
to have a license, so recommendations from clients can be more
significant than a certificate from a grooming school. Even if your
groomer comes highly recommended by a friend, ask to see the
license, or see if the groomer has a portfolio of clips he’s done.
Your goal is to find an experienced groomer you like and trust, and
that your dog likes and trusts, too. He also has to do a good job (of
course) grooming your dog. If you don’t like the results after your
first visit, talk to the groomer. A good groomer should be willing to
change what he does so you’re happy. If you feel you can’t commu-
nicate well with the groomer, look for someone else. You aren’t
obligated to continue working with a groomer who isn’t working
with you. Fortunately, most cities and even small towns have sev-
eral groomers to choose from.
Grooming Tools and 
Products: A Primer
Whether or not you decide on a professional groomer, you need
grooming tools for grooming at home. You can find all these tools
Part III: Caring for Your Chinese Charmer 
136

at a pet store or online. If you’re having trouble finding something,
talk to local groomers or your breeder, or ask your pet store if they
can order it for you.
Here’s what you need to have on hand at home:
 Spray conditioner: Long-coated dogs can suffer hair breakage
with rough brushing and combing. A spray conditioner helps
smooth out hair and ease out tangles. Use spray conditioner
before brushing and combing, and the job will be much easier.
 Natural bristle brush: Use a natural bristle brush for puppies.
This brush has softer bristles made of animal hair (usually
from a boar) or plant fiber; a synthetic brush made of nylon or
plastic is coarser and can hurt or break hair. This book’s tech-
nical editor and Shih Tzu breeder and exhibitor Victor Joris
recommends the Mason-Pearson natural bristle brush with
the rubber base. For more info go to www.masonpearson.com.
 Pin brush: This brush has metal pins instead of bristles and is
better to use on adult Shih Tzu. The pins have rounded ends
so they aren’t sharp, and they get through tangles and thick
hair better than a natural bristle brush, which is more likely to
smooth just the top layer of hair. Some brushes have pins on
one side and natural bristles on the other, giving you both
options.
 Slicker brush: These brushes have a lot of tiny metal bristles
that are perfect for pulling out your Shih Tzu’s undercoat when
he sheds. You can get rid of a lot of dead hair this way, rather
than having it fall out and get tangled in the outer coat. Use a
slicker brush carefully and never around the dog’s eyes; slicker
brushes are sharp. Use a steel comb for your Shih Tzu’s face.
 Steel comb: A steel comb is the best way to get at those tiny
tangles forming right at the skin that you can’t see until they
snag in your comb. After brushing, comb through the coat all
the way down to the skin. You can also use a comb to work
out tangles by pulling tiny pieces of hair from the tangle a
little at a time. With patience, even stubborn mats can come
out this way.
 Toothbrush and toothpaste: How long would you go without
brushing your own teeth? Dogs are prone to dental plaque,
gum disease, and other health problems related to dirty teeth,
just like humans. Brush your dog’s teeth every day or at least
once a week with a soft-bristled toothbrush and toothpaste
made for dogs. (Check out the “Toothy grin” section later for
how to brush your dog’s teeth.)
Chapter 10: Making Your Baby Beautiful: Time to Groom 137

 Moisturizing eyedrops: Some Shih Tzu are prone to a condi-
tion called dry eye, which leaves their eyes lacking in tear pro-
duction. Although dry eye is irritating and painful, it’s easily
remedied with the regular application of over-the-counter
moisturizing eyedrops (and in some cases, prescription med-
ication). Ask your vet if your Shih Tzu needs eyedrops.
 Clippers: A pair of clippers, like the kind you use to buzz off a
person’s hair, is most necessary for grooming your Shih Tzu
yourself and keeping him in a short cut. However, you can
also use a clipper around your Shih Tzu’s rear end. When pur-
chasing clippers, look for one designed for dog grooming, so
you get the right blades and attachments for your needs.
Good clippers can be costly (they can range from $50 to more
than $200). Clippers must be kept very clean and carefully
maintained, or they can break down. Protect your investment.
 Toenail accessories: Healthy feet have short, well-groomed
nails, and regular nail trimming is easier on you and your dog
than trying to chop off too-long nails every few months. Buy a
good-quality nail clipper made for small dogs. Some people
use electric grinders instead of nail clippers, but these aren’t
safe for Shih Tzu because the rotating mechanism can catch
in the Shih Tzu’s long coat. Regular, old-fashioned nail clippers
are the best choice.
 Grooming scissors: A sharp pair of grooming scissors with
rounded tips (pointed tips are too dangerous) can be a
valuable tool for trimming the rear end, trimming extra hair
on your Shih Tzu’s paws (particularly in the winter or if she
goes outside a lot), and even neatening body and facial hair.
Scissors can also cut through a mat (see the sidebar “What’s
a mat?” for more information). If you have your Shih Tzu 
professionally groomed, you probably don’t absolutely need
grooming scissors, but these can be nice to have around.
Always use scissors with caution so you don’t injure your dog.
 Tear-stain remover: The Shih Tzu’s sensitive eyes can tear,
and these tears can cause stains that are particularly visible
on light-coated dogs. Mild tear stains don’t hurt your dog
(although built-up gook under the eyes can cause bacterial
infection). However, tearstains can make your Shih Tzu’s face
look messy, so tear stain remover removes unsightly stains
and keeps your dog fresh faced.
 Dog shampoo and coat conditioner: If you have your dog pro-
fessionally groomed, the groomer typically shampoos and
conditions your dog’s coat. But if your Shih Tzu rolls in the
Part III: Caring for Your Chinese Charmer 
138

mud and doesn’t have a grooming appointment for another
week, you should have shampoo and coat conditioner handy,
just in case. If you groom your Shih Tzu yourself, you need
these products for the monthly bath. Always choose a sham-
poo and conditioner formulated for dogs. Human shampoo
has the wrong pH for dogs.
Dog spa products are everywhere these days, so you have
plenty of shampoos and conditioners to choose from:
• Choose a shampoo and coat conditioner or crème rinse
for long-coated dogs that need extra moisture to keep
coats from breaking or getting frizzy.
• If your Shih Tzu has a white or black coat, you can also
get a shampoo to enhance those colors.
• If your Shih Tzu has sensitive skin, choose a hypo-
allergenic shampoo.
• If you have flea problems in your area, a shampoo with
natural botanicals that repel fleas is good.
 Blow-dryer: Long-coated dogs need to have their hair blown-
out to keep it smooth and tangle-free. Without blow-drying,
the coat can get tangled and messy as it dries. A freshly
washed and blown-dry Shih Tzu is a joy to hug and cuddle,
but buy a dryer with a low or cool setting. Small dogs are sen-
sitive and if the blow-dryer is too hot, the heat can actually
burn your dog. Even if your Shih Tzu has a short coat, blow-
drying can dry him faster and make him look fluffier, but it
isn’t absolutely necessary.
 Bows, barrettes, and other doggy hair accessories: A small
rubber band made for dog grooming keeps your Shih Tzu’s
topknot in place, but you can also decorate with ribbons,
bows, or barrettes. A professional groomer can bedeck your
dog with these optional accessories, but you may want to
change your Shih Tzu’s look for special occasions between
professional grooming sessions.
Grooming on a Schedule
Incorporating grooming into your regular routine is essential to keep
your Shih Tzu looking fabulous. However, how regularly do you need
to groom? It depends. For example, you do some tasks, such as
brushing and teeth cleaning daily, while you do others, such as nail
trimming, less often. Table 15-1 shows you a grooming schedule.

Taking Care of Your Dog’s Coat
If you’ve decided to handle coat care yourself from start to finish,
this section is your guide. From brushing and combing to bathing,
blow-drying, and styling, you get everything you need to know to
keep your Shih Tzu’s coat healthy and beautiful. Remember, prac-
tice makes perfect! It’s really pretty fun to play beauty shop.
Brushing and combing the coat
Without regular brushing and combing, any Shih Tzu’s coat will
form tangles and mats, which feel uncomfortable for your dog, but
even worse, they can trap dirt and moisture, providing bacteria
with the perfect place to thrive. To keep your Shih Tzu’s coat clean,
healthy, and tangle-free, brush and comb through it once each day.
Follow these steps, whether your dog has a long or a short coat:
1. Spray with coat conditioner.
Never brush a dry coat! Always start with a good dousing of
coat conditioner before you brush. To avoid breaking the
hair, spray down the coat every time you brush with coat
conditioner. This process protects the hair shaft and keeps
the hair lubricated and soft.
2. Brush from the bottom.
Brush down your Shih Tzu’s legs and work through hair
from the end upward.
3. Brush the rear end by lifting the tail.
Part III: Caring for Your Chinese Charmer 
140

4. Remove the tangles from the tail from the end upward,
working tangles out from the bottom up.
Work from head to toe with a pin brush or slicker brush.
5. Brush along the back and around the mane (the neck
area).
6. Brush the head and ears.
7. Comb through.
Switch to your steel comb and comb through the entire coat,
head to toe, combing all the way down to the skin and work-
ing out any tangles that didn’t come out with the brush.
Bathing your baby
The Shih Tzu’s coat requires a bath about every month or so to
wash out any dirt that can cause tangles and to keep it hydrated
and gorgeous. If you do this process yourself, make some decisions
first about location and products.
You have a few options about where to bathe your Shih Tzu:
 The bathroom or kitchen sink: Because your dog is small,
you may decide to bathe her in the sink. The sink is a conven-
ient height, and you don’t have to stoop down to bathe her
(like you would with the bathtub).
 The bathtub: If you don’t mind bending over, the bathtub can
be a convenient place for bathing.
 A basin, indoors or out: A basin is portable so you can wash
your Shih Tzu wherever it’s convenient.
 An infant bathing tub: This tub is ideal for small dogs
because they usually come with a nonskid surface in the
bottom, so little Lola won’t slip and slide.
If the surface you choose for bathing is slick, get a bath mat or other
small nonslip mat for the sink or tub, so your Shih Tzu doesn’t feel
insecure, sliding around on the slick surface. Now it’s time to bathe!
Just follow these simple steps:
1. Before you start running the bath water, gather all your
grooming supplies:
• Nylon collar and leash, to keep your dog from jump-
ing out in the middle of the shampoo
• Brush and comb
• Spray conditioner
Chapter 10: Making Your Baby Beautiful: Time to Groom 141

• Cotton balls for your dog’s ears
• Petroleum jelly for her eyes
• Shampoo
• Crème rinse
• A sprayer attachment or big cup for rinsing
• A big fluffy towel
• Blow-dryer with cool setting
Keep all your grooming items in a big basket so you can
easily grab the basket and take it right to the bathroom.
2. Brush and comb your Shih Tzu’s coat thoroughly.
Tangles tighten when wet, so you want your dog’s coat to
be completely tangle-free before you bathe her. (Check out
the “Brushing and combing the coat” section earlier in this
chapter.)
3. Put a nylon collar or harness and leash on your Shih Tzu
if she tends to try to run away when wet.
Some Shih Tzu don’t mind bathing at all or wouldn’t think
to jump out and run away, but if you have a runner, this
equipment helps you keep hold of her. Just loop the leash
over the faucet or your wrist. Or, if you bathe her in the
bathroom, just shut the door. Whether you use a leash or
not, never leave her unattended, even for a minute. She can
drown or jump off the sink and choke herself.
4. Plug her ears and protect her eyes.
Put a small piece of cotton in each ear to keep the ear canal
dry. Because Shih Tzu ears are dropped, moisture can get
trapped inside and cause infection and smelly ears. Put a
small dab of petroleum jelly in the corner of each eye, to
keep water and soap from irritating the Shih Tzu’s sensitive
eyes.
5. Run lukewarm water into the bathing container.
Depending on what kind of bathing container you use, you
can start running the water at this point and use the run-
ning water to help get your Shih Tzu wet, or you can run
the water into the tub as the first step, and then get your
dog ready. Be sure the temperature of the water isn’t too
hot or too cold (about body temperature is fine). If it feels
comfortable when you run the water over the inside of
your wrist, it should be fine for your Shih Tzu.
Part III: Caring for Your Chinese Charmer 
142

6. Put your Shih Tzu into the bath.
Make this step fun and reassuring by talking to her gently
and telling her how much fun this will be. After she’s used
to bathing, putting her in the water won’t be a big deal, but
you may need to reassure her quite a bit the first few times.
7. Wet her coat with a sprayer or by filling a cup with water
and pouring it over her coat.
Thick coats take awhile to get really wet, so make sure the
coat is wet all the way down to the skin.
8. Put about a quarter-sized dollop of shampoo into your
hands and rub them together; rub the shampoo into your
dog’s coat.
Apply the shampoo carefully so you don’t get any into your
dog’s eyes. Scrub the shampoo all over, including paws,
tail, tummy, and rear end.
9. Rinse the shampoo thoroughly.
Rinsing takes a long time (especially for long coats), so
when you think you have all the shampoo out, keep rinsing.
Periodically squeeze or press on the coat to get the water
out. Rinse, rinse, rinse! Soap residue can cause nasty tan-
gles and skin irritations.
10. Apply conditioner or crème rinse so your dog’s coat is
smooth and manageable.
Rinse again. And again.
11. When you’re sure your Shih Tzu is squeaky clean, take
her out of the bathing container and wrap her in the big
fluffy towel.
Dry the coat gently so you don’t break off hair — blotting,
pressing, and squeezing the coat. Don’t rub it. After you dry
her, she’ll shake and get out even more water than you
thought possible, which will probably get you wet, so be
ready. Praise her for being such a good girl!
12. Blow-dry.
After towel-drying, use your steel comb to make a long part
from the crown of your Shih Tzu’s head all the way to the
tail. Now, blow-dry the hair on low or cool setting, gently
brushing the coat out as you dry it so it hangs down nicely
on both sides of the part. Some dryers come with stands so
you can use both your hands to hold the dog and the
brush. If your dog has a short coat, you don’t need to part
it. Just blow-dry and brush until it’s soft and fluffy.
Chapter 10: Making Your Baby Beautiful: Time to Groom 143

Styling the “do”
If your Shih Tzu has a long coat, you have just a little bit of styling
to do after your dog is freshly washed and blown dry. Styling a long
coat is easy. Short coats require a little more work during trimming
but are much easier to maintain every day.
Long coat styling
Follow these steps to style your Shih Tzu’s long coat:
1. Make a long straight part, using your steel comb, from
the crown of your Shih Tzu’s head all the way to the base
of his tail.
2. Comb the hair down both sides.
3. Take a look at the bottom edge of the dog’s long coat.
Using a scissors, trim the edges so they’re straight, like cut-
ting someone’s bangs.
4. Look at each foot and trim any stray or long hair from
between paw pads.
Be careful with the scissors so you don’t cut and injure
the dog.
5. Trim any long hair from inside your dog’s ears.
Some people prefer to have a vet or groomer pluck out the
ear hair.
6. Now, tie up the topknot (check out Figure 10-3).
Part III: Caring for Your Chinese Charmer 
144
What’s a mat?
A mat is a hair tangle that has turned into a thick mass, either because the tangle
wasn’t combed out or because foreign matter got caught in the hair and the hair
tangled around it. You can’t just comb out a mat without a lot of work. You may need
to tease it out or even cut it in strips and tease out each section. Severe mats may
need to be cut out of the coat entirely. Regular brushing and combing prevents tan-
gles from becoming mats.
A mat splitter makes it easy to slice mats into smaller pieces so you can work them
out more easily without cutting out the mat entirely. A mat splitter is an optional tool,
and if you keep your Shih Tzu well combed, you probably won’t ever need it. For
more info on other grooming tools, see “Grooming Tools and Products: A Primer”
earlier in this chapter.

Figure 10-3: A topknot keeps your Shih Tzu’s 
long hair out of his eyes.
1. With a comb, make a part from ear to ear.
2. Gather up all the hair in front of the part into a
ponytail.
3. Secure the hair with an elastic band made for dog
hair.
4. Add a bow or barrette, if you want.
5. For show-dog flair, tease the hair before tying it in
the topknot, so it poofs out.
You can also make two topknots or any other fun varia-
tion. Tug gently on the hair after you tie it, pulling it
out a little to make it poofier. Some exhibitors even
curl the ends of the ponytail with a curling iron into
ringlets. If you do this, be careful not to burn your dog.
Be careful with the scissors and clippers! These tools work
better sharp, but that also makes them dangerous. Don’t
ever let children use these tools on a dog, and pay close
attention to what you’re doing when you use them. Don’t
watch TV or talk to other people during the part of groom-
ing when you’re using these tools. You don’t want to nick,
cut, or clip your Shih Tzu’s skin or injure an ear, an eye, a
tail, or any other precious part!

Styling the short coat
If you keep your Shih Tzu in a short coat, you can keep it trimmed
yourself, although many pet owners prefer a pro to do it. If you
want to try it, you can trim down your Shih Tzu in a variety of
ways. You have several different options for a styling a short coat.
You can also check out stfsc.bizland.com/grooming3.htm for
more options.
To style the most popular puppy cut (see Figure 10-4), just do the
following:
Figure 10-4: The puppy cut is easy to maintain.
1. Use scissors and cut all the hair on your Shih Tzu’s body
to about 1 to 2 inches all over.
Leave the tail, ears, and beard a little bit longer.
2. After you cut the hair, fluff it up with a slicker brush and
even out any places that stick out.
3. Cut the ear, tail, and beard hair so they’re neat along the
bottom edge.
4. Shape the head.
To shape the head, you can
1. Clip the hair on the skull short (where the topknot
would be), but leave the ears and beard longer.
Part III: Caring for Your Chinese Charmer 
146

2. Cut the beard and ears in a reverse bowl shape, so
that a line from the bottom of one ear dips down
under the beard and rises up again at the opposite
ear, when you look at your dog from the front.
Another option for the head is
1. Shape the Shih Tzu’s head by leaving the hair on
the skull long.
2. Cut the ear and beard hair so they form a straight
line along their bottom edge, parallel to the ground,
leaving the hair on the top.
3. Always trim hair around paw pads so excess hair
doesn’t get tangled around your Shih Tzu’s feet.
Handling Other Grooming Tasks
Just because your Shih Tzu’s coat looks fabulous doesn’t mean
you’re finished. Grooming includes nail care, eye care, ear care,
dental care, and more. Don’t neglect these tasks. This section goes
more in-depth.
Body check
A daily once-over with your hands alerts you to any changes, such
as rashes, lumps, bumps, rough patches, sore weepy areas called
hot spots (these can form beneath hair tangles), or painful areas in
your Shih Tzu’s skin and body. If you do this body check every day,
you just can catch problems before they get too serious.
Start out this process by giving your Shih Tzu a massage. Rub her
skin from head to toe, to loosen dead hair and slough off dead skin,
stimulate oil production, and feel for any skin changes. If you notice
a lump, a sore, or a painful area (your Shih Tzu may yelp or shy
away from you), give your vet a call to have the issue checked out.
Face up
Using a soft, moist washcloth, wash your Shih Tzu’s face. Gently
wipe under her eyes, up her muzzle, and under her chin. Don’t
forget the beard! Because a Shih Tzu often gets food and water in
his beard and can get runny eyes and tear stains, this daily facial
cleansing keeps her feeling and looking clean.
Chapter 10: Making Your Baby Beautiful: Time to Groom 147

Teary-eyed
The Shih Tzu’s naturally sensitive eyes can get runny, dirty, or so
dry they become painful. Apply moisturizing eyedrops if your vet
recommends them, and tear stain remover if your dog needs it.
Eyedrops made for moisturizing human eyes work fine, but check
with your vet to be sure. Most pet stores and grooming shops
stock tear stain remover.
Toothy grin
Dirty teeth can contribute to dental plaque, gum disease, and early
tooth loss, all of which can lead to decreased immunity and even
early death, according to recent research, because oral bacteria
can travel straight to the heart. You brush your own teeth every
day (or at least I hope you do) to prevent tartar buildup and cavi-
ties, so give the same courtesy to your dog. Give your dog’s teeth a
good inspection during brushing.
If you get a young dog used to tooth brushing, he’ll soon accept the
ritual as part of the regular grooming routine. For older dogs who
won’t accept tooth cleaning (although most Shih Tzu don’t mind too
much), you can add an oral rinse product made for dogs into his
water, to help eliminate dental bacteria. Chew toys can help, too.
If your dog resists tooth brushing, start slow. Let him lick some
dog toothpaste off your finger the first few times and just touch his
teeth. Do a little more each day. Work up to these easy steps:
1. Put a little dog-formulated toothpaste on a soft-bristled
toothbrush.
Brush the teeth with a toothbrush and toothpaste made for
dogs — human toothpaste can be toxic to a dog if he swal-
lows it, and your dog probably won’t like the taste, either.
You can use a child’s soft toothbrush, a toothbrush for
dogs, or other tooth cleaners made for dogs, including
“brushes” that fit over your finger so you can just massage
your dog’s teeth with your finger. If you don’t have access
to a dog’s toothbrush, at the very least, wrap a soft cloth
around your finger and wipe the teeth.
2. Brush Samson’s teeth the same way you would brush
your own, gently scrubbing all surfaces.
3. Brush gums or massage with your finger, to keep circula-
tion going for healthier gums.
Part III: Caring for Your Chinese Charmer 
148

If you notice plaque build-up, talk to your vet about a professional
cleaning. Older dogs often require a professional cleaning about
once a year.
Paws for a moment
Without grooming, your Shih Tzu’s nails can also become too long
and damage his foot or make walking difficult. Get your dog used
to having just one or two nails clipped every few days, or clip off
the very tips every two or three weeks, instead of clipping a lot of
the nail every few months. Frequent clipping keeps the quick — the
vein running down the nail — from growing toward the end of the
nail. When this happens, and you accidentally clip the quick, the
nail bleeds and your dog feels pain, so frequent clippings are safer.
To clip nails (refer to Figure 10-5), follow these steps:
Figure 10-5: Hold your dog’s paw and carefully clip the nail.
1. Take your Shih Tzu’s paw in your hand and position the
nail clipper to clip off just the very end.
Chapter 10: Making Your Baby Beautiful: Time to Groom 149

2. Clip the nail using a quick motion with the clipper.
Don’t move the paw or jerk the dog. With practice, this
step becomes easier.
3. After clipping, smooth the rough edges of each nail with
an emery board.
You don’t ever want to clip the quick in your dog’s nail, but just
in case you do (it happens), keep a little styptic or coagulating
powder nearby (your pet store stocks this product). A dab will
stop any bleeding. Even more importantly, get back on that horse
and clip the very next day with plenty of treats in hand, so your
dog doesn’t associate nail clipping with this one bad experience.
In dogs with light nails, you can see the quick, which looks like a
dark line inside the nail. The quick doesn’t go all the way to the
end of the nail, so find where the quick begins and clip just before
it. In dogs with dark nails, you have to guess, which is why it’s best
to clip just a tiny bit off the end more often, instead of clipping a
lot at once. Regular nail clipping tends to force the quick to recede
so it isn’t anywhere near the tip where you’re cutting.
Get to the bottom of it:
Maintaining the rear
Sure, your Shih Tzu looks cuter from the front than from the rear.
(Most of us do!) Even so, don’t neglect your Shih Tzu’s rear view.
Wipe the area with a hypo-allergenic baby wipe if the area seems
dirty, and keep hair clipped back from around the anus so your
Shih Tzu won’t have any problem with hair getting in the way when
he goes to the bathroom.
If your Shih Tzu starts licking his rear a lot or scoots around on the
carpet like he’s trying to scratch his butt, he may have impacted
anal glands. These glands around the rear end fill up with a stinky
substance that’s usually released a little at a time naturally when
your Shih Tzu poops. Small dogs often have a problem in this area.
Some groomers can empty the anal glands for you, but most
people entrust the dirty job to a vet, who’s specifically trained. If
you don’t want to pay the vet, have her show you how to do it. But
personally, I think this task is difficult, and really, frankly, quite dis-
gusting. You have to use paper towels and squeeze around and
under the anus until the substance comes out. You may not enjoy
it, but if your dog’s prone to this problem, doing this step yourself
saves you money. Good luck!

Socializing and Shaping
Your Shih Tzu’s Behavior
In This Chapter
 Introducing your Shih Tzu to the world (and vice versa)
 Spending time with your Shih Tzu to improve behavior
 Solving common behavior problems
 Seeking professional help for your Shih Tzu’s behavior
E
very day, you discover something new about your dog, and the
better you know him, the more you can see his own unique
and individual personality emerging. Maybe he’s a little reserved or
the most loving and sociable dog. Maybe he loves kids or cats but
seems fearful of tall men with beards or the two big dogs next door.
Your Shih Tzu has certain inborn qualities, but on the other hand,
you can shape much of her behavior. How you behave toward her
and what you do with her all affect how she grows up to behave.
The more people, other dogs, and new situations your Shih Tzu
experience, the better she’ll understand the world. The more you
guide her, the safer she’ll feel. This chapter helps guide you toward
shaping your Shih Tzu’s behavior to be the best that it can be,
within the limits of her own unique personality.
Drum Roll, Please: Presenting
Your Shih Tzu
Routines and a lot of interaction with you socialize your Shih Tzu
to life in your house, but socialization is a much broader and
important concept to understand. Socialization is the process of
introducing your dog to a variety of people, animals, and new situ-
ations. This process should, ideally, start the day a new puppy is
born. The puppy should be handled several times a day, gently, or

even more often so that when he first opens his eyes, he’s already
accustomed to people. You hope the breeder did this (this is one
sign of a good breeder — for more, see Chapter 3). But even if your
Shih Tzu is already an adult, you can still do a lot to socialize her.
What will your Shih Tzu discover as you introduce her to the
world? If Lola’s new experiences are positive, safe, and fun, she’ll
understand to enjoy new experiences. If Samson’s experiences are
frightening, dangerous, painful, or just generally mind-numbingly
dull (like sitting in a crate for eight hours), he quickly figures out
that new experiences aren’t something that he’s going to be inter-
ested in — they’ll be too highly stimulating and stressful.
This section looks at some strategies for socializing your Shih Tzu
with the outside world. Remember that Shih Tzu puppies need to
experience the human world because they live in it, and you can
make those experiences positive so your Shih Tzu grows up to be
happy, confident, and well-adjusted.
Starting your dog’s socialization
You can socialize your Shih Tzu in many different ways. When you
introduce her to someone or something new, you’re socializing her,
and whatever impression she gets influence her future perception.
Try to take your Shih Tzu somewhere new or introduce her to a
new person at least a few times every week. Here are some ideas:
 Take a walk to a busy park. Let your Shih Tzu interact with
friendly people and dogs.
 Visit extended family and friends. Let them hold and pet
your dog, one at a time.
 Throw a puppy shower. (See the “Party on: Throw a puppy
shower” section for more info.) If your Shih Tzu gets used to
people coming over, he won’t feel threatened every time the
doorbell rings.
 Take her with you when you run errands. Doing so lets your
Shih Tzu get used to traveling in the car, so she doesn’t asso-
ciate the car with vet visits only. Many places allow small
dogs in carriers. Whenever possible, take your Shih Tzu. She’ll
love to be at your side, exploring the world, if she’s used to
doing it. Remember to never leave your Shih Tzu alone in a
car on a warm day. Shih Tzu are prone to heatstroke.
 Organize play dates with other dogs. Find other small or
larger but gentle, friendly dogs your Shih Tzu likes, and get
together regularly for playtime.
Part III: Caring for Your Chinese Charmer 
152

Meeting (and greeting) other people
Humans tend to get a bit over exuberant when they see cute, little
dogs, but you must remember that those little pups can easily get
frightened by loud noise and rough physical contact. Remember
that a Shih Tzu sees you and everyone else at ankle level when he’s
on the ground. Ankles aren’t the most welcoming parts of people.
Shih Tzu need to meet people, so how do you make sure these
experiences are pleasant? Simple. You have to be in charge and
protect your Shih Tzu from getting overwhelmed.
Every dog is different, and you don’t know how your Shih Tzu will
react to socialization until you try. Keep these things in mind:
 If your dog gets overly excited, limit social activities to five
or ten minutes at first. Then give your dog some down time
to rest in her crate or on your lap at home.
 If your dog seems afraid of someone or something, trans-
form the interaction into a positive one. For example, if your
dog seems to fear children, pick a few gentle kids, arm them
with doggy treats, and let them greet your Shih Tzu, offer a
treat, and then go away. Your Shih Tzu will soon discover that
the child (or whomever else she fears) is okay.
Introduce your Shih Tzu to many different kinds of people:
Men, women, kids, seniors, people of different sizes and ethnici-
ties, and people in wheelchairs. The first time your Shih Tzu
meets anyone new, that meeting forms a strong impression.
 If your Shih Tzu fears loud noises, you can desensitize her by
occasionally making a loud noise at home (dropping some-
thing or turning on the vacuum cleaner), and then reassuring
her everything is fine. Don’t get in the habit of picking her up
every time she gets scared of a loud noise, or she’ll figure out
that she really does have a reason to be afraid and only you can
protect her. Let her figure out that loud noises don’t cause bad
things to happen, and loud noises don’t scare you.
Whenever you introduce anyone to your Shih Tzu, tell that person
(even your own family members) that you’re working on socializing
your dog and you need them to help you. Whenever your Shih Tzu
has the opportunity to meet friends, neighbors, even passersby who
stop to kitchy-kitchy-koo your puppy, give the person a small treat
and tell her to approach slowly, speak softly, and gently extend her
hand for a sniff, offer a treat, and then very slowly pet the dog on the
back or under the chin with a soft touch.
Chapter 11: Socializing and Shaping Your Shih Tzu’s Behavior 153

Meeting other strange animals
Your Shih Tzu is bound to meet other animals at some point in her
life. Do you want her to think that other animals are scary and dan-
gerous, or do you want her to be able to have other dog and cat bud-
dies to play with and keep her company when you aren’t around?
To expose your Shih Tzu to other people’s animals, you can
 Hold a play date with other dogs. The Shih Tzu is naturally
friendly and loves to have animal friends if introductions occur
safely and in a fun environment. If everyone involved can
manage their pets and someone has a good space in his home
or a safely fenced yard, doggy play groups and play dates can
be fun. For more info on introductions, see Chapter 7.
In most cases, because Shih Tzu aren’t threatening, other dogs
and cats will make friends or at least accept your dog. But
never stop supervising. Keeping interactions positive is easier
than having to undo the damage of a traumatic interaction.
 Drop in on friends who have animals. Visit friends with your
dog in tow so your Shih Tzu can meet your friend’s cat or bird.
Shih Tzu even learn to get along well with small animals, but
some exceptions exist, so never leave your pet hamster,
guinea pig, ferret, bunny, or any other small animal alone with
any dog, even the docile Shih Tzu. Just remember, supervise,
supervise, supervise, and keep it friendly.
 Enroll your Shih Tzu in a puppy or dog socialization class.
These classes focus less on training and more on safe, friendly
interactions, so puppies and dogs can learn to get along with
each other in a fun, nonthreatening, and organized environ-
ment. (Check out the “Puppy classes” section later in this
chapter.)
If your Shih Tzu fears other dogs, let her interact, one on one, with
dogs you know are gentle and friendly for short periods until she
begins to trust other dogs. During all interactions, you and some-
one else should each have control over each dog to prevent any
kind of negative interaction. Don’t take her to dog parks or other
places with a lot of big dogs that can overwhelm her.
Before your Shih Tzu is fully vaccinated, avoid areas with a lot of
dogs, like dog parks and obedience classes with a lot of dogs, so
your Shih Tzu isn’t at risk for contracting a contagious disease.
However, you can still socialize your Shih Tzu in your own neigh-
borhood, in your own home, and in small puppy socialization
classes where all the dogs are healthy, until he’s fully vaccinated.

Party on: Throw a puppy shower
A good way to teach your Shih Tzu about people is to have a few
friends over to your home, where your puppy already feels safe. As
long as you don’t let everyone mob your puppy, a puppy shower
can be fun. Keep it small, serve good food and a few cool doggy
treats, and party on — but always supervise all interactions
between your Shih Tzu and your guests. (Check out the nearby
sidebar, “Making the puppy shower happen” for more tidbits.)
Here are some tips to make your party successful:
 Invite people and their gentle dogs and children.
 Let people approach one at a time, instead of in a big mob.

 Provide food for both people and dogs. (But no food that’s bad
for dogs, just in case people can’t resist sharing. See Chapter 9
for info on avoiding the not-so-healthy treats for dogs.)
 Remind party guests to speak softly, move slowly, and handle
the puppy gently.
 Play, offer treats, introduce the puppy to other dogs (as long
as everybody’s fully vaccinated), and have fun!
Your puppy won’t believe what a great new posse she’s scored! But
she may get a little grumpy or tired, so let her take a rest in her bed
or crate away from the crowd if she starts to act scared, growl, or
she looks tired and starts to snooze. She can always come back out
after a nap, and besides, it’s her party. She can nap if she wants to!
Hanging with Your Shih Tzu
Before you can modify your Shih Tzu’s behavior (if it’s a problem),
you must first understand his natural tendencies, and you can’t
really know your Shih Tzu unless you spend time with him. Of
course, you’ll be doing this anyway — that’s why you chose a com-
panion breed, right? But you can discover a lot more if you pay
attention when you’re together.
Watch how your Shih Tzu reacts to his environment. Most Shih Tzu
are friendly and trusting, but these qualities can come with many
variations. Ask yourself the following questions. If you see a poten-
tial problem, check out the next section to resolve it.
 Is Samson quick to rush in, or does he tend to hang back?
 Does Lola hide behind your legs or stand bravely in front of
you like a guard dog?
 Does Samson prefer to stay in your arms or in that cushy
Sherpa bag?
 Is Lola a barker or less likely to voice her opinion?
 Does Samson express fear with a growl, a nip, or by cowering
and hiding?
 Is Lola seemingly without fear?
 Is Samson a social butterfly or a wallflower?
Companion dogs thrive on human interaction. Just as you’re learn-
ing about your dog when you hang out, your dog’s learning about
you and about human behavior in general. Just watching television
together on the couch or playing a game of fetch or tug-of-war
Part III: Caring for Your Chinese Charmer 
156

helps your Shih Tzu feel that he’s doing his job. The more time you
spend together, interacting or just relaxing, the stronger your bond
and the happier your Shih Tzu will be.
Nipping Potential Behavior
Problems
Even the sweetest, nicest dogs tend to do some things people
don’t like, such as barking a lot, chewing things, or guarding their
toys and food. These doggy behaviors are natural, but they don’t
work well in human society. Even if your new Shih Tzu doesn’t
have any behaviors you don’t like just yet, being prepared can give
you the tools to deal with any behaviors that arise later.
Before I get into specifics, don’t forget to reward the good behavior!
People forget, but rewarding the good behavior is important. (Check
Chapter 17 for more on rewarding.) In these moments of good
behavior give your pup a kind word or a tiny treat — the dog equiva-
lent of the thumbs-up. Positive reinforcement works much faster
than punishment for shaping the behavior you want, because
although a punishment may hint to your dog about what you don’t
like, it still doesn’t give him any info about what you do like.
This section looks at some potential behavior problems your Shih
Tzu may exhibit and what you can do to nip them in the bud before
they drive you and everyone else crazy.
Shhhh!: Keeping your Shih Tzu quiet
Yip yip. Yip yip yip. Yip yip yip yip yip yip . . . Enough already! Dogs
bark, but does your Shih Tzu have to keep making that noise every
time a sparrow hops across the lawn? How can such a small animal
make that much noise?
Some Shih Tzu don’t bark often, but others do. Just like people,
some Shih Tzu are more talkative than others, and some are also
more protective of their homes and want to be sure you know
about anything suspicious. (Remember, part of the Shih Tzu’s
ancestry was to guard the Buddhist temples in Tibet.) But you can
keep your Shih Tzu from barking excessively with a few simple strate-
gies. Before you can get him to stop, you need to determine his bark-
ing triggers. For example, does he sit on the couch and bark at every
moving thing he sees out the window? Does he only bark when the
doorbell rings? Does something else cause him to bark?
Chapter 11: Socializing and Shaping Your Shih Tzu’s Behavior 157

After you determine what triggers your dog’s barking, you can take
action to get him to stop. The following hints can keep him quiet:
 To stop the barking when he sees someone or something
outside, close the curtains. “But Lola just loves to watch!”
you protest. If you don’t mind the barking, let her watch. If
you do, close the curtains and let her find something else to
do. Or open the curtains only when you leave, so you don’t
have to listen to her (if you live in an apartment complex, the
neighbors may not appreciate this as much).
 To stop the barking when the doorbell rings, convince your
pup that the sound of the doorbell means he gets a treat,
but only if he doesn’t bark. Barking can be helpful — it alerts
you that someone is coming. However, if your Shih Tzu is just
a little too exuberant an alarm system, train your Shih Tzu not
to bark by following these easy steps:
1. Grab a pocketful of your Shih Tzu’s favorite treats and
enlist a friend’s help.
Have your friend go outside.
2. Stand in front of the door with your Shih Tzu and her
favorite treat.
This process works best when your dog is hungry, so try
this trick before a meal and not after.
3. Show your Shih Tzu the treat and then have your
friend ring the doorbell.
When your Shih Tzu barks, say “No” and turn away.
4. Open the door, greet your friend, and then close the
door.
Show your Shih Tzu the treat again.
5. Have your friend ring the doorbell again.
If your dog barks again, again say, “No,” open the door,
greet your friend, and close it. Keep doing this until your
Shih Tzu finally gets so interested in the treat, and so
bored with that doorbell, that she doesn’t bark. As soon
as the bell rings and she doesn’t bark, give her the treat
and praise her.
Repeat this process every day at least a few times, for
a few days. And always keep treats nearby. The food-
motivated Shih Tzu will quickly figure out that a ringing
doorbell means treats, but only if she doesn’t bark. She
may still bark once in awhile, especially if the sound of
the doorbell surprises her, but this exercise should cor-
rect any problems.
Part III: Caring for Your Chinese Charmer 
158

The above technique works to stop your Shih Tzu from any unde-
sirable behavior linked to a sound. Try it if she jumps on people or
nips at people when they come in the door, but this time, say, “Sit”
before letting anyone in the door. She only gets the treat if she
stays seated. For more info on how to teach your Shih Tzu to sit,
see Chapter 17.
Tackling biting problems
Your furry little pup would never bite the hand that feeds her, but
some Shih Tzu tend to get nippy, particularly if they start to figure
out that nipping works. If children harass the dog, the dog has few
ways of defending herself other than with her teeth. If people
approach a shy dog too forwardly, the dog may bite out of fear. If
biting makes the child or threatening adult go away, or if you pick
up your Shih Tzu and cuddle her when she nips, the behavior has
been reinforced, and the dog is likely to keep doing it.
As a responsible pet owner, make sure that your dog doesn’t bite
people. Only you know whether your Shih Tzu has a tendency to
bite, but if you know this fact to be true, you need to get the prob-
lem under control ASAP.
Dealing with biting puppies
Fortunately, biting problems are usually easy to fix with puppies, if
they haven’t gone on for long. Never let puppies bite human skin!
To teach a puppy not to bite, pull away and say a sharp, loud “No!”
every time your puppy nips you. He’ll soon realize that human skin
isn’t for chewing. This realization results in what trainers call bite
inhibition. The dog learns to control his urge to bite.
Chapter 11: Socializing and Shaping Your Shih Tzu’s Behavior 159
Are you the problem?
If you constantly reward your Shih Tzu by picking her up or soothing and petting her
whenever she “defends” you by growling and nipping at anyone who comes near
you, you may be causing the problem. You’re rewarding her bad behavior, even if
your intention was only to calm her down. On the other hand, if you react harshly or
hit the dog when she behaves badly, you’re teaching her to fear you but not to
behave better.
Remember, every reaction you have to your companion dog’s behavior either rein-
forces or discourages that behavior, and all your interactions determine how your
Shih Tzu sees your relationship, so be careful how you react to the behaviors you
don’t like. Ignoring bad behavior or separating yourself from the dog works best.

Handling biting older dogs
Teaching older dogs bite inhibition can be more difficult. Some
dogs have lived much of their lives as biters. Plenty of small dogs,
Shih Tzu included, can develop a biting habit. Sometimes, a dog
bites because he feels threatened and thinks he has no other
options.
Most importantly, don’t ignore any kind of aggression, even though
your dog is small. Ignoring it won’t make it better, and for every-
one’s safety (including the dog’s, who could end up in a shelter or
worse if he keeps biting), address the problem now. With some
dogs, biting is a habit. They never learned bite inhibition as pup-
pies (see the previous section), or they were taught earlier in life
that biting works or is a necessary defense mechanism.
If your older Shih Tzu bites — not just out of extreme self-defense
but as a regular way of dealing with certain situations like meeting
new people or having someone touch his toy — consult a profes-
sional behaviorist or trainer specializing in aggression, for an eval-
uation. (See the section “Identifying When You Need Help [and
Who Can Help]” later in this chapter to find a professional to help
you with behavioral issues.)
Guarding their goods
Resource guarding is an aggressive reaction dogs sometimes dis-
play when they feel that their food, toys, or even their turf (and
that can include you) may be stolen. For example, a dog who
growls and snaps if you come near him while he’s chewing his
favorite rawhide or who bites anyone who tries to get near you
when he’s on your lap is guarding his resources. Many Shih Tzu
would never think of growling when you approach the food bowl or
a favorite toy, but others feel very threatened about their posses-
sions. This issue is much more common in rescued dogs that may
have been mistreated, dogs that have lived in multiple-pet house-
holds and always felt they had to guard their food against other
dogs, or dogs that have frequently had food, space, toys, or
favorite people taken away from them.
Some people think you should constantly take things away from
resource guarders to teach them that they don’t get to own any-
thing. Doing so may work with some dogs, but in my opinion, it isn’t
an effective strategy with a Shih Tzu. The dog gets frustrated, and it
teaches her not to trust you because you keep taking away her stuff.
How would you like it if someone kept taking your dinner away from
you before you were finished eating? Okay, you probably wouldn’t
bite that person’s hand, but you might wish you could.
Part III: Caring for Your Chinese Charmer 
160

Instead, you need to teach your Shih Tzu that she has plenty of
everything and she doesn’t need to guard it. You can do a lot of
things to resolve resource guarding. Here are some ideas:
 Let her eat alone and in peace. Many dogs, especially those
who live or have lived with other dogs, feel very threatened
when they eat. This reaction is instinctual and natural, but
you can teach your dog that she never has to feel anxiety
when she eats at your house. Always feed her away from other
dogs, children, or even you, in a closed room if necessary, and
always at the same time each day. Soon she’ll relax and realize
that nobody is around to threaten her food.
 Don’t give your dog things she tends to guard. Some dogs
only guard particular things. She may not guard a stuffed toy,
but she may guard a pig ear or a rawhide with ferocity. If so,
don’t give her those trigger items.
 Shower her with abundance. If your dog guards everything,
she’s afraid her resources will disappear. Teach her that in your
home, resources are so abundant that she never needs to guard
them. Feed her ten times each day (but the same amount as
you did before, so she doesn’t become overweight — just a few
pieces of kibble per serving will work). If she guards toys, put
toys everywhere. She can’t possibly guard them all.
 If your dog guards a place or a person, you must also refuse
to let her have possession over that place or person. If your
dog growls at people when you’re holding her, put her down
immediately. If she growls while sitting on the bed when some-
one approaches, don’t allow her to sit on the bed. The very
moment she displays territorial guarding reaction remove her
from the territory. You don’t want her to lose her territory;
you just want her to understand that her reaction won’t result
in what she wants. Pick her up again, and praise her if she lets
someone approach without growling. But if she guards you
again, put her down. She’ll soon discover that guarding means
she doesn’t get what she wants.
When guarding truly becomes an aggression problem, you may
need to consult a professional. See “Identifying When You Need
Help (and Who Can Help)” later in this chapter to find a pro.
Overcoming extreme shyness
Shyness in dogs may be partially genetic, but in many cases, it’s
based on experience. A sensitive dog that gets over-stimulated,
frightened, or even hurt tends to back off from the unfamiliar just
to keep safe. Shy dogs need extra patience and sensitivity, and for
Chapter 11: Socializing and Shaping Your Shih Tzu’s Behavior 161

these fearful fellows, safe and frequent socialization is even more
important than for other dogs. There isn’t anything wrong with
having a slightly more cautious personality. But when shyness
compromises your dog’s quality of life, you need to act.
You can help your Shih Tzu overcome his shyness by trying these
do’s and don’ts:
 Do take your shy dog on a walk every day. Doing so can help
him gradually feel more confident because he’s getting out of
the house, seeing new sights, and meeting people and other
dogs but always on a routine. Your walks don’t have to be
long; even a ten-minute walk can help.
 Do introduce him to new people or situations in the same
way every time. Make intros regularly and make sure that you
supervise all interactions so your dog never feels like anyone
or anything has crossed the line and poses a threat to him.
After a while, he’ll get used to other people.
 Don’t keep him isolated. Make sure you let other people and
animals near your dog. If he never gets out or meets anybody,
he’ll never overcome his fear. Sure, you want to protect your
sensitive Shih Tzu, but the best way to do that is to help him
build up his owner inner confidence.
Some Shih Tzu have physical or serious emotional problems that
make shyness issues too difficult for the average pet owner to
manage. These dogs require professional intervention. Check out
“Identifying When You Need Help (and Who Can Help)” later in this
chapter for info on help with behavioral issues.
Separation issues
Because companion dogs not only want but also need to be with
people, some get very distressed when their people go away,
resulting in separation anxiety. Even though you may be flattered
by your godlike status in your dog’s life, separation anxiety isn’t
good for your Shih Tzu. The stress can compromise his immune
system and his quality of life, and he can even injure himself if he
goes into a panic because of your absence. He can also bark exces-
sively, disturb neighbors, and damage property.
Of course, your Shih Tzu can live without you, at least for short
periods of time. He should look to you for guidance and care, but
you want him to have enough confidence and independence that
he can hang out by himself once in awhile. Here are some things to
do to help your pet deal with your absence in a healthy way:
Part III: Caring for Your Chinese Charmer 
162

 Train your Shih Tzu to spend some time alone in his crate
every day. If at first he cries, speak reassuringly to him but not
with emotion in your voice. Be calm. Leave the room frequently
but not for long. When he sees you keep coming back, he’ll stop
crying and relax. Keep at it and be patient, making a routine,
which turns into a comfort for your dog. Just don’t leave him in
there for too long. For the purposes of teaching your Shih Tzu
independence, 15 to 30 minutes at a time is plenty.
 Don’t make a big deal about leaving or coming back. Tell
your Shih Tzu that you’re leaving, but don’t act emotional
about it. When you return, don’t greet her right away or make
a big deal about that, either. Greet her lightly, “Hi Lola,” and
then do something else. Dote on her later when she isn’t deal-
ing with the stressful transition of your comings and goings.
 If you put your Shih Tzu in his crate when you leave, put
him in about ten minutes before you leave. Don’t let him out
until a few minutes after you get back. Open the mail, put
away your coat, check your messages, and then let the dog
out. This process eases him into the transition.
 Pretend to leave frequently throughout the day. Practice not
making a big deal about it, but go out the door, walk around
the yard for a few minutes, and then come back in. Go back
out, get in the car, drive around the block, and then come
back. Do these activities several times daily, leaving for a bit
longer each time.
 If you have to leave your dog for more than a few hours,
hire a pet sitter or take your dog to a doggy daycare center.
Pet sitters spend time visiting and walking dogs whose
owners have to work all day, and your dog gets some social
interaction during that long stretch of time when you’re away.
Doggy daycare centers are a great experience for dogs that
need help overcoming separation issues. To find places to
care for your dog when you’re away, see Chapter 14.
Separation anxiety can also be a pathological condition requiring
medication and more serious professional intervention when it
interferes with your Shih Tzu’s life and well-being. If you can’t
manage separation anxiety issues by yourself, consult a profes-
sional (see “Identifying When You Need Help [and Who Can Help]”
later in this chapter).
Delusions of grandeur
Some Shih Tzu have an amusing and all-encompassing sense 
of entitlement that adds to their charm. However, when that
Chapter 11: Socializing and Shaping Your Shih Tzu’s Behavior 163

power-happy personality starts nipping, excessively barking, or
becoming a serious nuisance to your life, you have a problem.
To cure your over-confident pooch can be tricky. You don’t want to
discourage her, frighten her, or destroy her self-confidence. But the
following actions send the clear message that you’re in charge:
 Ask her to do things before you give her any treats. Don’t
just give her treats for anything. Have her sit first, lie down,
come to you, or look at you.
 Don’t reward him for bad behavior. If he growls, take away
his toy. If he nips, give him a timeout. If he barks rudely to get
your attention, ignore him.
 Make sure she knows who’s in charge (that would be you). If
she tries to dominate you, ignore her. Don’t cave in to her
demands. You’re the human with the bigger brain.
 Don’t forget to reward him when he is a good dog and isn’t
acting like a dictator. Whenever he listens to you, looks at you
with adoration, lets others pet him, plays nicely with another
pet, or sits quietly in your lap, reward him. The reward doesn’t
always have to be a treat. Your attention is all your dog wants.
Identifying When You Need Help
(and Who Can Help)
When a regular routine, plenty of attention, and smart training
don’t do the trick, who ya gonna call? Doggy professionals!
Sometimes behavioral problems are too big or too serious for a pet
owner to handle without some professional help. These problems
most often occur in dogs who’ve suffered abuse, neglect, abandon-
ment, poor breeding, or those dogs who didn’t receive early social-
ization from the breeder or training from their previous owners.
Behavioral problems may also come from physical problems. (A
dog’s response to pain, for example, can look like aggression.)
When your dog really does have a problem, don’t ignore it. Just
because your dog is little doesn’t mean his problems can’t be big
or put others or himself in danger. This section is your guide to pet
pros who understand dog behavior problems.
Your veterinarian
If your Shih Tzu’s behavior changes suddenly, he becomes aggressive
for no apparent reason, or he suddenly becomes shy and withdrawn
Part III: Caring for Your Chinese Charmer 
164

and you don’t know why, the problem may be physical. Pain and ill-
ness can cause dogs to behave differently. Whenever your dog has
a behavior problem, consult your vet first just to rule out a physi-
cal illness or injury. (Check out Chapter 13 for more.)
Puppy classes
Puppy classes are perfect for young Shih Tzu who need experience
with other people and other dogs in a safe, structured setting.
Puppy class instructors can help you with basic behavioral man-
agement, such as housetraining, eliminating barking, puppy
mouthing (when puppies chew on your fingers or playfully nip at
you), and general manners training. Problems you think you can’t
handle may be easy to fix with your puppy instructor’s help.
To find a good puppy class in your area, check out these options:
 Ask your veterinarian for a recommendation.
 Search the Association of Pet Dog Trainers’ Web site (www.
apdt.com) by zip code for trainers near you.
 Ask your local dog obedience club about classes.
 Look in the phonebook under dog training.
Obedience classes
Obedience classes, or dog training classes, are for puppies that
have had all their vaccinations, as well as for adolescent or adult
dogs. You can start your Shih Tzu at the beginner level for basic
cues like Sit, Stay, Come, and Lie down. You can also ask the
teacher all about dealing with basic behavioral issues.
Some instructors specialize in particular areas like aggression
problems or shy dogs, and some also teach classes that train you
and your dog to compete in competitive obedience, agility, or the
show ring (check out Chapter 17 for more). Obedience classes
can work wonders for dogs with behavioral problems because
the classes and instruction teach you how to train your dog and
communicate better.
To find a good obedience instructor, I recommend the following:
 Get a recommendation from your vet.
 Ask your breeder or rescue group for good local trainers.
 Search the Association of Pet Dog Trainers’ Web site at www.
apdt.com.
Chapter 11: Socializing and Shaping Your Shih Tzu’s Behavior 165

Before you sign up your Shih Tzu, be sure to visit a class first. Talk
to the instructor to ensure that she advocates reward-based train-
ing and has experience with small dogs. Also express any concerns
about bringing a Shih Tzu to a class with large dogs who could
potentially be aggressive toward small dogs. If you find someone
you feel comfortable with, go for it. Dog training classes are fun!
Some people say that Shih Tzu don’t need obedience classes, and
it’s true . . . some of them don’t! It all depends on what you want
from your relationship. You may be able to teach your little Lola
everything she needs to know, right there at home. But if you do
want to take your relationship to the next level, get involved in
competition or just have fun together with other dogs and people.
Animal behaviorists
Why does your Shih Tzu do that? Animal behaviorists, also referred
to as pet psychologists, know. They have an advanced degree in
animal behavior and can help you understand and correct behav-
ior problems. Some behaviorists are also vets. Many specialize in
pet behaviors and can help solve seemingly unsolvable problems
related to severe separation anxiety or biting (see previous sec-
tions in the chapter relating to these issues).
Many animal behaviorists tell me that they wish people would come
to see them before problems became serious because prevention is
easier than fixing serious and advanced problems. Animal behavior-
ists may be able to give you an entirely new and helpful insight into
your dog’s problem, and they help you with concrete tools for solv-
ing those issues. Many of them have helped pet owners who thought
their pets were beyond saving. Get recommendations from your vet
and other dog owners before consulting these pros.
Animal behavior consultants
Animal behavior consultants may also be able to help you. These
folks don’t have to have any particular training or an advanced
degree to call themselves behavior consultants, but they’re often
dog trainers who’ve had a lot of experience in the field dealing
with certain issues like aggression or fear. Many behavior consult-
ants do excellent work, and others may not have much experience
or employ techniques you don’t like, so get recommendations
and check references before working with an animal behavior
consultant.

A
fluffy, bouncy puppy may look like the picture of health, but
dogs don’t always stay healthy without the right care.
Preventive care helps keep your Shih Tzu at her best. Any vet will
tell you that preventing health problems is easier than curing
them, and curing health problems that have just started is much
easier than curing them in their advanced stages. Don’t wait until
your Shih Tzu develops a health problem to adopt the strategies in
this chapter. They really will make a difference right now.
In this chapter, you discover how to find a good vet and what to
expect when you go there. You also find out easy care strategies
that make a huge difference in how healthy your dog can be.
Finding the Right Vet
After you first buy or adopt a new dog, you need to take your dog
to a veterinarian within the first 36 to 48 hours. This timeframe is
very important — and often specifically required in the purchase
or adoption contract (the agreement you signed when you pur-
chased or adopted your dog; see Chapter 4). Many pet owners
already have a vet they like, but if you don’t, find one before you
bring home your Shih Tzu. That way, you can have an appointment
already made and feel good about the vet you’ve chosen.

Most cities and even small towns have at least a few vets, so visit
more than one before choosing the one who’ll be your Shih Tzu’s
healthcare provider. When comparing vets and narrowing down
your search, you want a vet
 That you like: You should feel comfortable with the vet and be
able to communicate well with her. She should explain things
clearly and be willing to listen, not rush you through a visit.
 Who understands small dogs — yours in particular: Not all
vets specialize in or treat very many small dogs, but small
dogs have unique care needs. Ask your vet if she has a lot of
small dog clients, and any other Shih Tzu clients in particular.
 Who shares your beliefs about health: For instance, if you
like to try natural or holistic methods before resorting to med-
ication or surgery, you may prefer a vet with training in, or at
least an open mind about, holistic health. Maybe you like the
idea of a vet fresh out of veterinary school and current on the
latest developments in veterinary research, or you may feel
more comfortable with someone who’s been a practicing vet-
erinarian for many years and has a wealth of experience.
Location, pricing, and atmosphere in the vet’s office all matter, too,
not to mention the vet’s bedside manner. Consider your own pref-
erences and priorities when choosing your vet. Keep looking until
you find one you really like and who makes you and your Shih Tzu
feel comfortable. During the first year with a new puppy, you and
the vet spend a lot of time together. Better make it a positive rela-
tionship from the start.
Knowing What to Expect
at the Vet’s Office
Dogs don’t always love going to the vet if it means they have to get
a shot or a lot of poking and prodding, but veterinary visits are
important for maintaining your new dog’s good health, and quickly
resolving any health problems that may occur. If you choose a vet
you feel comfortable with, vet visits should be pleasant (mostly!)
and a great chance to ask questions and get advice.
Most vets have different recommendations for the number of
visits, depending on the age of your dog:
 Puppies (through the first year): Make four to six vet visits in
your puppy’s first year of life.
Part III: Caring for Your Chinese Charmer 
168

 Adults (1 to 8 years): Annual vet visits throughout adulthood
allow your vet to keep a close eye on your dog’s health.
 Seniors (starting at 8 to 10 years): Visit the vet twice a year,
to nip any problems of aging before they get too advanced.
If your Shih Tzu stays healthy, you probably won’t need to see the
vet more than these recommendations, but these regular visits can
make a big difference in your Shih Tzu’s future health. But what
happens during these visits? The next section sheds some light.
The first vet visit
During the first visit, you meet the vet (if you haven’t already), and
the vet meets your new Shih Tzu. Typically, the vet gives your dog
a physical exam, which consists of looking at the dog; examining
her ears (check out Figure 12-1), eyes (see Figure 12-2), mouth, and
the way she walks; and feeling all over his body for any physical
abnormalities that may not be evident because of the dog’s coat.
If the vet detects any serious problems during the initial visit, you
may need to contact your breeder, rescue group, or pet store to
discuss your options. More often, the vet may notice more minor
problems that can be easily resolved. Vets are trained to detect
subtle signs of illness you may not notice, and if the vet suspects
a problem, she may order some tests, such as blood tests or tests
of urine or feces. She may prescribe medication, such as a deworm-
ing product, skin cream, or a flea control product. Or, she may
suggest that you return in a few days or weeks for a follow-up exam.
Chances are pretty good that your Shih Tzu will get a clean bill of
health at the first vet visit — and if he does, congratulations! But
your job is far from over. If your vet advises you return at a certain
time, make an appointment and keep it. Keeping your Shih Tzu
healthy is all up to you.
Your puppy’s first visit
For puppies, the first vet visit also sometimes includes a round of
puppy vaccinations, depending on how recently she has had her
last round from the breeder or rescue group. (Check out “Puppy
shots” later in this chapter for more info.) Vaccinating your puppy
is an important safeguard against disease.
Your adult dog’s first visit
Adult dogs may need a booster vaccine, or they may just need a
physical exam. The vet specifically checks older dogs for arthritis,
dental plaque, and other signs of aging.

Subsequent puppy visits
The first vet visit with a new puppy is super important, but you
need to bring your puppy back according to your vet’s recom-
mended schedule a few more times in that first year. Your puppy
needs several rounds of vaccinations to be sure she gets the full
immunity as she grows and establishes her own immune system.
Also, puppies can sometimes develop health problems you may
not notice, and your vet needs to make sure your puppy is growing
and thriving. Just as human babies need a visit to the pediatrician
every few months to monitor growth and development, your Shih
Tzu needs that regular monitoring, too. The visits usually only take
a few minutes — time for a shot, a general check, and the chance
to ask any questions.
Regular check-ups for your adult dog
Your Shih Tzu can’t just tell you in plain English when he isn’t feeling
well. Regular vet visits may be the only chance to catch a health
problem you may not have noticed. Healthy adult dogs need a regu-
lar check-up once a year, for booster shots, weight check, and a
general physical exam. Your vet will also probably give your dog
an annual heartworm test and a new prescription for heartworm
medication, as well as a prescription flea control product, if you’re
using one (for more on fleas and other pests, see Chapter 13).
When your dog becomes older, he needs more regular vet visits.
Check out the “When Your Shih Tzu Slows Down: Senior Care”
section later in this chapter for more info.
Chapter 12: Keeping Your Shih Tzu Healthy and Safe 171
Doing your part
Sure, the vet is the health professional, but you see your Shih Tzu every single day.
You’re most likely to notice when she starts limping or won’t eat or starts drinking
more water than usual or suddenly doesn’t want to play. You are your dog’s first line
of defense against health problems, so keep a close watch on her. When anything
changes from the norm — what she does, how she acts, how her skin feels, how
her coat looks, how much she eats and drinks, even what her poop looks like —
give your vet a call. You may just be the one to save her life by alerting your vet to a
problem in the early stages.

Getting the Right Vaccinations
at the Right Time
Long ago, thousands of pet dogs died from diseases like distemper
and rabies. Today, because of vaccinations, these diseases are
rare, which is great news for your pets. Different vets have differ-
ent vaccination protocols depending on what they feel is best and
what particular diseases are common in your area. Some cities
have specific laws about vaccinations, and some facilities like
doggy daycare centers and boarding kennels also have rules about
which vaccinations are required to participate. If you travel with
your Shih Tzu, you may also need proof of vaccinations.
Some breeders and pet owners like to administer vaccinations
themselves, but some states require that a vet administer vaccina-
tions such as rabies. Check with your state to see what is required.
If in doubt, however, let a vet do the job and you’ll have the official
paperwork to prove your pet is vaccinated.
This section identifies the types of shots your new puppy needs to
protect him, and it also names the many common vaccinations
that your vet may suggest your dog gets. Although vaccinations
are important, occasionally your dog may have a bad reaction to
one. This section also helps you deal with adverse reactions.
Puppy shots
Puppies still nursing from their mothers obviously don’t get out
much, so they aren’t exposed to many germs. They also get a lot of
natural immunity from their mother’s milk, but as soon as a puppy
is weaned, that immunity begins to decline. When the puppy goes
home with a new owner and goes outside on walks, to puppy
classes, and all the places that you take him for socialization, vac-
cinations protect the puppy from bacteria and viruses in the envi-
ronment, until his immune system is mature and fully functioning.
Depending on the area in which you live, the shots given to your
pup vary. Your vet can best advise you which shots are best for
your dog. (The most common vaccinations are covered in the next
section.) Holistic vets may be less inclined to include a lot of differ-
ent vaccinations, while conventionally trained vets may be more
likely to administer a combination vaccine.
Most puppies will have received at least one set of shots, typically
at about six weeks, before the breeder allows the puppy to go
home with anyone. The rest of the shots are up to you, and you
need to schedule them every three months until the puppy has
Part III: Caring for Your Chinese Charmer 
172

received three sets of shots. Some vets recommend four sets, so
check with your vet on his schedule recommendation.
Common vaccinations
Understanding what the common diseases are and what they could
potentially do to your puppy can help you recognize the importance
of vaccinations and can also help you decide, along with your vet,
which vaccinations are necessary for your dog. The following sec-
tions contain brief descriptions of some of the diseases your vet
may suggest you vaccinate your puppy against depending on the
prevalence of the disease in your area, your dog’s individual needs,
and state laws.
Rabies
Rabies is a dangerous, highly contagious, and fatal disease that
occurs in wild animals. Whether or not you want to vaccinate your
puppy against rabies, you’ll probably be required to do so, by law.
Humans can catch rabies, too, which is probably the main reason
for the legal requirement. In most cases, vets give dogs the rabies
vaccine at about six months of age.
Canine distemper
Once the number-one killer of pet dogs, distemper is no longer run-
ning wild, but this virus is still considered among the most serious
viral diseases a pet can catch. Infected dogs stop eating and have
major intestinal and respiratory distress, inflammation, coughing,
vomiting, diarrhea, and fever. Don’t neglect this one!
Parvovirus
Parvovirus is an intestinal virus that causes serious and acute vom-
iting and bloody diarrhea. Parvovirus is also one of the reasons
why many vets and breeders recommend keeping your puppy
indoors and away from foot traffic and other dogs (such as in a dog
park or puppy socialization class) until he’s received at least a
couple of sets of the vaccine. The disease is often fatal in young
puppies and because it’s so prevalent in the environment and so
contagious, you absolutely must vaccinate your puppy against it.
Adenovirus
Canine adenovirus is a respiratory virus that can cause bronchitis,
pneumonia, and other respiratory problems in dogs. It can also
cause infectious canine hepatitis, so the adenovirus vaccine is
considered protection against this very contagious form of hepati-
tis in dogs. Dogs can pick up the adenovirus easily in boarding ken-
nels and doggy daycare situations where a lot of dogs are breathing,
barking, and coughing in the same room. This one’s important.
Chapter 12: Keeping Your Shih Tzu Healthy and Safe 173

Leptospirosis
Leptospirosis, a serious bacterial infection, can result in jaundice (a
yellowing of the skin) and liver problems, kidney damage, vomit-
ing, excessive urination, dehydration, fever, and other problems.
Leptospirosis isn’t as common as it used to be, and it’s one of the
vaccines that’s more likely than others to cause a vaccination reac-
tion (see “Keeping an eye open for vaccine reactions” later in this
chapter), so not all vets recommend vaccinating against it.
However, some areas of the country have recently had a resur-
gence of leptospirosis, so your vet may recommend this vaccina-
tion, depending on where you live.
Parainfluenza
Nobody likes getting the flu, and parainfluenza, a canine version of
the flu, is highly contagious and can cause serious upper respira-
tory problems in your dog. Symptoms include coughing and trou-
ble breathing. If a dog gets parainfluenza, he’ll often recover on his
own, just like you do when you have the flu. However, some dogs
(like some humans) develop serious respiratory complications, so
most vets still recommend vaccinating against this one.
Coronavirus
Coronavirus, an intestinal virus, can cause bloody vomit and severe
diarrhea. Some vets don’t automatically give this vaccine unless you
plan to board your dog in a kennel (where viruses are often passed
around) or unless the disease has recently occurred in your area.
Bordatella
The bordatella bacteria can contribute to a respiratory condition
generally known as kennel cough (several viruses can also cause
this general condition), which is a dry hacking cough and a runny
nose. Although this condition isn’t life-threatening, bordatella is
contagious and dogs in or around other dogs in a boarding or day-
care situation should be vaccinated against bordatella so they
don’t contract the disease, which is like passing around the
common cold. Because Shih Tzu have flat faces, they can have
breathing difficulties and bordatella can be very uncomfortable for
them, so vaccinate against this one.
Lyme disease
Lyme disease is a serious, debilitating disease that dogs and humans
can both catch from certain kinds of infected ticks. If you don’t live
in a tick-infested area known for Lyme disease risk or you never take
your dog into areas that harbor ticks, you probably don’t need to
worry about this vaccination. Just ask your vet what he thinks; ticks
aren’t just in forests — they can even be in your backyard.
Part III: Caring for Your Chinese Charmer 
174

Adult or booster shots
When your puppy reaches the one-year mark, she’s technically
considered an adult dog (even if she still frolics like a puppy). For
adult dogs, vaccinations are still important, but your Shih Tzu
won’t need them as often. Enter the booster shot!
A booster shot is another dose of the combination vaccine and any
other relevant vaccinations that is given to your dog about once
every one to two years starting at one year of age. At 18 months,
your dog needs another rabies vaccination, and then again every
two to three years after that, depending on the law in your area.
Your vet may also recommend other vaccinations for your adult
Shih Tzu, depending on the situation. So check with your vet.
Keeping an eye open
for vaccine reactions
Most dogs handle vaccinations just fine, but some are particularly
sensitive and can suffer from vaccine reactions, ranging from mild
to severe. Think about how shots affect you —sometimes you don’t
feel so great for a day or two. Shih Tzu can feel sore or a little bit
under the weather after a vaccination, too. The rabies shots are
given deep in the hip area, and that can hurt!
Chapter 12: Keeping Your Shih Tzu Healthy and Safe 175
Are you overvaccinating?
Once upon a time, dog owners vaccinated their dogs every year, or at least, that’s what
vets told everyone to do. Today, however, many vets, breeders, and pet owners suspect
that annual vaccinations are too frequent, and too much vaccinating can compromise
the immune system and even cause dangerous reactions and diseases. This contro-
versial issue has been the subject of much debate in recent years, so talk to your vet
about how often your adult Shih Tzu needs a vaccination or a booster shot. Some vets
recommend titer tests, which are tests that measure antibodies to various diseases.
The results tell your vet exactly which vaccinations your dog does and doesn’t need.
These tests cost extra, but they can keep you from overvaccinating your Shih Tzu.
Don’t skimp on puppy vaccinations, however, and follow your vet’s recommenda-
tions. Most vets still agree that three or four sets of combination vaccines in the
first year of life can prevent the most common dangerous diseases in puppies.

Toy breeds like Shih Tzu are sometimes more likely to experience a
low-grade fever, muscle aches, depressed appetite, and fatigue for
one or two days following a vaccination. Sometimes, the dog will
get irritation around the injection site, too. These side effects aren’t
usually anything to worry about, unless your dog refuses to eat
anything for more than a day, seems unusually depressed, or has
inflammation around the injection site. If you have any concerns
about reactions, call your vet.
In more severe reactions, dogs can suffer breathing problems,
severe allergic reactions, or even go into shock in response to a
vaccination, with a drop in heart rate and blood pressure. The
mouth and tongue may look white or gray and the dog could col-
lapse. These situations are emergencies that require immediate
veterinary care! If your dog has sudden breathing problems or stops
moving or responding after a vaccination, don’t wait to see what
happens. Call your vet or emergency veterinary facility right away.
This info may sound startling, but in most cases, dogs have no
reaction at all, and the risks to an unvaccinated puppy far out-
weigh the risks of vaccination. Even so, keep a close eye on your
dog for a few days after any shot. If your Shih Tzu does have a
reaction to the vaccination, you’re more likely to notice and get
your dog to the veterinarian right away, where she can be treated.
IDing Your Dog
One of the most important things you can do to keep your Shih Tzu
safe and healthy is to keep identification tags on her at all times.
Unlike some breeds that can run for miles if they happen to escape,
chances are, your Shih Tzu will sit on the front stoop and whine to
be let back in if she does get out. However, sometimes a Shih Tzu
will find a reason to wander, even if it is just to dash across the
street to greet your neighbor. If your Shih Tzu does end up beyond
your yard’s perimeter, proper ID can spell the difference between
a fast and safe return and a permanently lost dog.
A proper ID can’t save your Shih Tzu from cars, large dogs, or
other dangers that exist beyond your home’s safety, so take all pre-
cautions to ensure that your Shih Tzu doesn’t end up wandering
the neighborhood. However, mistakes happen and a proper ID can
turn a potential disaster into a happy reunion.
Your ID options include the following:
 Tags: Your first line of defense in IDing your dog is a simple
collar tag. Put an identification tag on your Shih Tzu the
Part III: Caring for Your Chinese Charmer 
176

moment you bring him home, and never take it off. The tag
should list your contact info: your phone number and/or
address.
You can also add your dog’s name and your name, but these
items aren’t as important because anyone who finds your dog
won’t need this information to contact you. Just make sure
the tag gives the info needed to bring your Shih Tzu home.
 Microchip: A microchip is an identifying mechanism that’s
placed under the skin of your dog, usually in the back of the
neck. The chips are about the size of a large grain of rice and
hold your contact info. A vet or shelter can scan the chip with
special equipment and get the dog’s identifying information.
After your dog is microchipped, you have to send in a special
form with a fee so the information can be registered in the
company’s database. Otherwise, the scan won’t turn up any-
thing, and your dog may not be returned to you.
Most shelter and rescue groups, and an increasing number of
breeders and pet stores, require or strongly suggest that you
have your pet microchipped with identifying information.
Microchips can also serve as an important and life-saving
backup if your dog ever does get out without his collar, or
loses his collar on his adventure away from home. Even with a
microchip, however, your dog should always wear her collar
with ID tags. Someone who finds your dog may not think to
take the dog in to have her scanned for a microchip.
 Tattoo: Some breeders advocate tattooing instead of, or in addi-
tion to, microchipping. The dog is typically tattooed with his
purebred registration number or some other number, usually
something chosen by the breeder. This same number should be
on all your paperwork when you purchased the dog. If some-
one finds your dog and sees a tattoo, they may take the dog to
a shelter or vet to see who can use that info to locate you.
However, a lot of people wouldn’t think to look for a tattoo, and
these aren’t easy to see on a Shih Tzu because of all that hair. A
microchip is usually more reliable. Also, always keep that collar
and ID tag on your dog, even if she has a tattoo.
Spaying or Neutering Your
Shih Tzu: Yes or No?
Chances are your purchase contract states that you agree to spay
(in the case of female dogs) or neuter (in the case of male dogs)
your Shih Tzu. If you purchased a show dog, you won’t spay or
Chapter 12: Keeping Your Shih Tzu Healthy and Safe 177

neuter your pet because show dogs can’t be spayed/neutered. In
most cases, however, your pet will be better off.
Even though the breeder may never know whether you got around
to it, there are serious, compelling health reasons why you should
spay or neuter your Shih Tzu.
 Your dog can’t contribute to the serious problem of pet over-
population, and your female won’t have to endure the serious
health risks of pregnancy and birthing.
 Your dog will be less likely to have behavior problems, may
master housetraining more quickly, and will make a better,
friendlier pet.
 Spayed females don’t go through heat and bleed (menstru-
ate), or drive the unneutered male dogs in the neighborhood
crazy with their come-hither scent. Neutered males don’t try
to escape or wander off in search of a willing partner.
 Your dog will be far less likely to suffer from certain cancers of
the reproductive organs, like mammary tumors (common in
unsprayed females).
Most vets recommend having a pet spayed or neutered at about
six months to one year, but some shelters and rescue groups
require the spay or neuter surgery at an even younger age, which
doesn’t seem to have any negative effect on the dog. You may have
heard that spayed or neutered dogs get fatter, but this isn’t true.
Spayed and neutered pets tend to be more affectionate but just as
active and in most cases, healthier.
Finally, consider that the world is filled with unwanted pets. Do
you really want to create more of them just because you can? Some
breeders, pet stores, and rescue groups even provide you with dis-
count vouchers to make spaying or neutering as easy and inexpen-
sive as possible. Dog breeding really is something to leave to the
experts.
Considering Holistic Health Options
One of the fastest-growing categories in the pet industry today is
holistic health. You can find holistic products, from nutritional sup-
plements and flower essences to pet massage DVDs and organic
pet foods, in many pet stores, and more and more pet stores have
devoted themselves solely to the holistic lifestyle. Holistic services
Part III: Caring for Your Chinese Charmer 
178

abound, too, from canine chiropractic care to specialists in veteri-
nary homeopathy, acupuncture, herbal medicine, or Chinese medi-
cine, all for pets.
This section defines holistic health medicine and helps you locate
a holistic vet if you’re interested in exploring these options for
your Shih Tzu.
What is holistic health?
Holistic health is a method of health maintenance and disease pre-
vention that advocates balancing and nurturing all the elements of
an animal’s (or person’s) life for optimal health. Keep the whole
animal healthy — the heart of the holistic method. Practicing good
holistic health is really about common sense eating a healthy natu-
ral diet, getting moderate exercise, reducing stress, interacting with
others, and using natural substances for healing, when necessary.
Holistic health practices can also address pain, disease, and dys-
function, which the holistic method sees as a deep inner imbalance.
Holistic healing methods don’t just mask symptoms. They seek to
tap the body’s own healing potential by bringing all elements of the
body, mind, and spirit into balance in ways conventional medical
techniques can’t necessarily measure but which holistic health prac-
titioners believe is significant. This approach helps the body heal
itself. Holistic health practitioners believe that symptoms signal an
imbalance, and you must treat the underlying imbalance instead of
simply covering up or superficially relieving the symptoms.
Holistic health healing therapies work for chronic issues like arthri-
tis, dry skin, allergies, and even cancer. For acute health problems
like emergency situations — broken bones, trauma, car accidents,
severe rashes, animal attacks, and so on — conventional care can
save your Shih Tzu’s life. Many practitioners like to call holistic
health methods complementary medicine because holistic and
conventional care complete each other in many ways.
Holistic methods include such things as:
 Nutritional therapy: Improving the diet in targeted ways to
address health problems, such as switching to a raw food diet
(for more on raw diets, see Chapter 9).
 Herbal remedies: Supplements in pill, capsule, or liquid form
include such natural plant substances as echinacea for build-
ing the immune system, glucosamine and chondroitin for
arthritis and other joint problems, hawthorn berry to
strengthen the heart, and milk thistle for liver problems.
Chapter 12: Keeping Your Shih Tzu Healthy and Safe 179

 Acupuncture: This Chinese healing therapy involves inserting
wire-thin needles into certain energy points to relieve pain
and improve energy circulation. Many pet owners report dra-
matic improvement in pets that undergo acupuncture.
 Pet massage: Relaxing therapy for muscles and pain relief, pet
massage increases circulation, reduces stress, and can help
increase mobility in stiff, arthritic pets. Many massage thera-
pists have added pets to their clientele.
 Homeopathy: These remedies, made from plants and other
natural substances, are highly diluted but made with a special
process that can boost healing for certain specific conditions.
Homeopathic remedies are very safe but will be most effective
under the guidance of a trained homeopathic veterinarian.
In general, holistic therapies are safe with few if any side effects,
but ask your holistic vet about any therapies you want to try, first,
for your pet’s safety. Always tell your veterinarian if you’re giving
your dog any kind of holistic health treatment, even if you think he
won’t approve. Your vet must have this information so he can
accurately prescribe treatments for any problems.
Locating a holistic health vet
If you choose a holistic lifestyle for yourself, you’re probably inter-
ested in exploring some of these options for your pet. The best way
to begin is to find a vet who’s trained in holistic medicine. Ask your
breeder and friends for referrals, or check out the American Holistic
Veterinary Medical Association’s Web site (www.ahvma.org) to find
holistically oriented vets in your area.
As you look into holistic care, be aware that a lot of information
you can find on holistic therapies is very helpful, and some of it
isn’t. If a so-called cure sounds too good to be true, it probably is.
No pill in a bottle, even if it is made with natural ingredients, can
cure cancer or banish chronic pain entirely.
Instead, look for holistic health practitioners with good reputa-
tions and training. Get recommendations and check references.
Also take everything you read with a grain of salt. Holistic health
practices bring the body into a state of optimal health, slowly and
gently, so internal healing processes can work their best. With
some professional guidance, you may just find the holistic way to
be an incredibly satisfying path to vibrant health for your Shih Tzu
(and even for yourself!).

When Your Shih Tzu Slows 
Down: Senior Care
Nobody likes growing old, but of course, everyone does. Small
dogs typically have longer life spans than large dogs, but starting
at about 8 to 10 years old, your Shih Tzu can safely be considered
a senior. Many dogs may act just the same as they did when they
were younger, but know that your Shih Tzu is experiencing the
aging process. This aging process may include achier joints, drier
skin and coat, and less efficient digestion. It can also include prob-
lems with the major organs — heart, kidney, liver, and pancreas.
However, aging doesn’t necessarily mean your Shih Tzu will have
to experience health problems, especially if you practice good pre-
ventive care. The most important things you can do to keep your
senior Shih Tzu healthy long into her golden years are
 Increase the annual visits to every six months, starting at
age 8. As dogs age, diseases like cancer, diabetes, cataracts,
kidney and liver disease, and chronic conditions like dry skin
and excess dental plaque become more likely. Many Shih Tzu
contract mouth cancer, so your vet should pay particular
attention to your dog’s teeth, mouth, and gums (and so should
you; don’t forget to brush your dog’s teeth! See Chapter 10 for
more info.). More frequent check-ups provide your vet with the
opportunity to catch and treat these diseases early.
 Keep your Shih Tzu at a healthy weight. Regularly feel your
Shih Tzu’s ribs; she should have a moderate tuck-in below her
rib cage. Her body shouldn’t be shaped like a sausage! Excess
weight puts a strain on aging joints and internal organs. If
your Shih Tzu slows down and starts to gain weight, adjust
her diet accordingly. Being overweight will just make aging
more difficult and uncomfortable.
Ask your vet what your dog’s weight should be, and then seek
to keep it there with regular exercise and a sensible diet, which
can include dog food made especially for seniors or overweight
dogs. Aging is no excuse to let your dog become fat. (For more
info on the right way to feed your Shih Tzu, see Chapter 9.)
 Keep up the good grooming, and consider a short cut. As
your Shih Tzu ages, an easy-care coat may feel more comfort-
able for her, and aging dogs with arthritis or dry skin may not
enjoy all the brushing, combing, and bathing the way they
once did. But don’t neglect grooming! Short nails, clean eyes,
clean teeth, and a well-groomed coat can help aging dogs feel
and look better. (Check Chapter 10 for more info.)
Chapter 12: Keeping Your Shih Tzu Healthy and Safe 181

 Keep exercising. Exercise helps older Shih Tzu age more com-
fortably and can make arthritic dogs feel better. It increases
circulation, reduces stiffness, and lessens pain, as well as helps
to keep your dog at a healthy weight. (Refer to Chapter 8 for
good ways to exercise your Shih Tzu.)
 Consider supplements. Talk to your vet before giving your
Shih Tzu any supplements, especially if your dog is also on
any other medications. This discussion ensures that drug
interactions won’t be a problem. If you get the go-ahead, here
are some great supplements to consider:
• Glucosamine and chondroitin supplements have been
shown to decrease pain and increase mobility associ-
ated with arthritis.
• Fatty acid supplements can help keep aging skin and
coat supple and shiny, and may even minimize skin
allergy symptoms. Look for formulas labeled for
“healthy skin and coat.”
• Probiotics like acidophilus (found in plain, nonfat yogurt
or in probiotic supplements) can help ease digestive
woes.
 Pay attention to changes in your Shih Tzu’s behavior.
Sudden growling or snapping can indicate pain. So can a
refusal to move. Changes in eating and drinking can be early
signs of health problems. Dogs can even develop a cognitive
dysfunction similar to Alzheimer’s disease in humans. Signs
include confusion and getting lost in a familiar room or stuck
behind a chair or in a corner. Report any behavioral changes
to your vet.
 Be patient. Senior dogs need a lot of love, care, and attention.
Think about all your dog has done for you and return that
kindness by making her golden years some of the very best.
As your dog slows down, she’ll focus even more on you.
Unfortunately, dogs don’t live for nearly as long as humans, which
means that most Shih Tzu owners will eventually have to deal with
the loss of a beloved pet and family member. But with good preven-
tive care, your senior Shih Tzu has the best chance at a long,
healthy, happy life with you. She’s lucky to have such a caring and
conscientious friend.

Handling Important 
Shih Tzu Health Issues
In This Chapter
 Banishing fleas, ticks, and worms
 Handling emergency situations
 Managing common Shih Tzu health issues
You don’t want to think about your beloved little Shih Tzu ever
getting hurt or sick. That’s why you practice preventive care,
good health habits, and regular grooming. Unfortunately, even with
the best care, sometimes dogs get sick, injured, or infested with
fleas.
A responsible pet owner not only pays attention to the signs of
health problems but also knows what to do when they strike, and
that’s exactly where this chapter comes in. I share how to banish
parasites, what to do in case of an emergency, and how to manage
some of the common health problems your Shih Tzu can develop.
Of course, if you ever have any questions about your dog’s health
or worry about what to do to prevent or manage a problem, always
consult your vet first. She’s your number-one ally in keeping your
dog healthy. This chapter is simply a guide to help you spot prob-
lems and deal with them in addition to your vet’s direction.
The Attack of the Parasites 
(And How to Avoid Them)
Be afraid . . . be very afraid! Like tiny vampires, fleas, ticks, mites,
and other parasites want to prey on your pet, sucking blood, trans-
mitting diseases, even invading your pet’s internal organs. Some of
them can even infect you, too!

Parasites are a serious concern for any pet owner, and if you keep
your Shih Tzu’s coat long, they can be difficult to see and catch in
the early stages of an infestation. Arm yourself with knowledge. A
string of garlic won’t keep these vampires away, but fortunately,
other products and practices really work. This section can help.
External parasites
External parasites like fleas and ticks latch onto your dog or hitch
a ride on his coat and feed off his blood. Not only can external par-
asites cause uncomfortable itching and skin allergies, but they also
can transmit serious diseases like tapeworms and bubonic plague,
and they can even hop off the dog and onto you. Eek!
The following sections look at the different external parasite risks
for your Shih Tzu and discuss the best ways for you to protect him.
Fleas
Fleas lay eggs that can lie dormant in your carpet, your dog’s bed-
ding, and your bedding, long after you thought your flea infestation
was resolved. Obviously, if you can avoid ever getting fleas, you
should, right? But wait. Before you start dousing your little pet in
chemicals, consider whether your dog is even at risk. You can
hardly avoid fleas in warm climates, such as in the southeastern 
or southwestern United States. Fleas thrive all year round because
the weather rarely gets cold enough to kill them. In these climates,
you want to take preventive measures. In colder climates, however,
such as in the upper Midwest, northeast, or northwest, you may
not ever see a flea. Then again, if the neighbor dog has them, you
may have a problem.
If you do wind up with a flea problem, follow these tips:
 Vacuum the entire house thoroughly, especially carpets
and furniture where the dog has been. Throw away the bag
immediately. Some people like to cut a flea collar into pieces
and put that into the vacuum bag first. If you do, wash your
hands thoroughly after touching it because of the pesticide
residue. (I don’t recommend ever using a flea collar on the
dog or in the house because of the toxicity of the pesticide.)
 Wash and dry all bedding in the house, especially your dog’s
bedding. Do so every two to three days until the problem is
under control to eliminate any eggs waiting to hatch.
 Brush your pet daily and then work through her entire coat
with a steel comb, manually eliminating any fleas. If you see
any, pluck them off and drop them into a small cup of alcohol
to kill them before dumping them down the drain. Fleas have
Part III: Caring for Your Chinese Charmer 
184

tough shells and you usually can’t kill them just by crushing.
They can also hop away, so hang on.
 Bathe her every week, too, until the problem is under control.
You can use a shampoo with natural botanicals that repels fleas,
but avoid shampoos with harsh chemical pesticides, unless
your vet recommends them. In most cases, simply bathing the
coat thoroughly with lots of rinsing will drown the fleas and
wash them down the drain, without having to resort to chemi-
cal intervention. (Check out Chapter 10 for more info on how
to give your dog a bath.)
The best preventive flea products are the monthly spot-on flea 
control products. These medications really have revolutionized
the pest control industry for dog and cat owners, making messy
sprays and dips unnecessary. Visit your vet to get a prescription
for these effective products, and always follow package directions.
Following package directions, apply the medicine between your
dog’s shoulder blades once a month, and fleas (and ticks) don’t
have a chance.
You can also try over-the-counter spot-on remedies from the pet
store, for less severe flea problems or as a preventive. Always read
package directions and follow them exactly. If you don’t want to
use chemicals, a careful daily comb-through to manually eliminate
fleas, and a good bath in a botanical flea-repellant dip containing
products like citrus oils can keep mild cases of fleas at bay.
Ticks
Ticks can bite everyone in your family and transmit Lyme disease,
Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, and other nasty infections. They
attach to the dog and suck blood. A tick can swell from the size
of a small pea to the size of a large marble after a blood meal.
Then, the tick drops off and digests, before starting the whole
cycle again. However, unless your Shih Tzu is the outdoorsy
type (most aren’t), you probably don’t have to worry about ticks.
Unless your dog is exposed to ticks — maybe you walk her every
day in a wooded area — you probably don’t need to apply any tick
protection.
Whenever she goes outside in a wooded area, into a park with
trees, or even if she goes out into your yard if you live in a tick-
infested region (ask your vet if this applies to you), check her all
over with your hands, feeling for any bumps. If you feel something,
take a close look. If you see a tick attached to her skin (or crawling
around looking for a place to attach), remove it right away. Most
tick-borne diseases won’t be transmitted if you remove the tick
right away. For example, a tick needs to be attached to your dog for
at least five and up to 20 hours before it can transmit Lyme disease.
Chapter 13: Handling Important Shih Tzu Health Issues 185

To remove a tick, follow these steps:
1. Put on rubber gloves or use a paper towel.
Tick bacteria can infect you too, if the tick pops when
removing it.
2. Pull the tick straight out, in a direction perpendicular to
your dog’s skin.
Pull slowly and carefully so the tick doesn’t break apart
and leave mouth parts under the skin.
3. Dab a little antibiotic ointment (the kind you put on your-
self that you can buy in the pharmacy) on the spot.
4. Watch the spot for a few days.
If it starts to look infected, some parts of the tick may still
be under the skin. Give your vet a call, so she can help cure
the infection.
Mites
These tiny little spider-like parasites can cause mange (a red, scaly
skin infection) and other serious skin problems and can also invade
your dog’s ears causing severe itching and discomfort. Mites are
most common in puppies who haven’t built up a strong immune
system yet. Mites can also cause other skin diseases to develop,
and they can even jump onto you!
The best way to prevent mites is to avoid contact with a mite-
infested animal, but of course, you can’t always know that
another animal has mites, so look for the signs:
 Head shaking and ear scratching
 Odor from the ears
 Inflamed, swollen ears or an oozy rash
 Severe scratching and chewing
 Small red bumps on the skin
 Patchy hair loss (in severe cases)
 Big crusty sores (in severe cases)
See a vet who can treat mites with a thorough cleaning and medica-
tion. Treatment may involve weekly baths (for about a month) with a
medicated rinse, an antiparasite drug, a topical ointment, or a combi-
nation. If the skin is infected, your dog may also need an antibiotic.
Make sure to vacuum your house thoroughly and wash all dog bed-
ding regularly to prevent a reinfestation.

Maggots
When a long-coated dog hasn’t been groomed for a long time and
spends time outside in that long dirty coat, flies can find him and
lay their eggs in his coat. The result? Maggots.
If you ever had a good reason to keep your dog clean and well
groomed, the very thought of maggots may just do the trick! Shih
Tzu shouldn’t spend too much time outside in the heat anyway
because they’re prone to heatstroke (see “The very real danger
of heatstroke” later in the chapter for more info), but if your Shih
Tzu just loves the outdoors, don’t neglect that daily grooming ses-
sion! Keep the coat clean and preferably short so you can watch
for parasites of all kinds. If you do find a maggot in your Shih Tzu’s
coat — they look like tiny white worms — pluck it out, flush it, and
take the hint. A good brush-out, comb-out, and bath are overdue.
Ringworm
Contrary to the name, ringworm isn’t a worm but a fungus that forms
a ring-shaped rash with hair loss over the infected area. Ringworm is
easily passed from dog to dog or from dog to human. Young dogs,
unhealthy dogs, and dogs that already have skin problems are most
likely to pick up a ringworm infection.
The only way to prevent ringworm is to keep your Shih Tzu from
other humans or animals with ringworm and to keep your Shih 
Tzu healthy by feeding him a healthy diet and giving him plenty
of exercise. A healthy dog has a strong immune system and will be
less vulnerable to the fungus. If your Shih Tzu develops ringworm,
your vet can prescribe oral and/or topical medication.
Internal parasites
Some parasites aren’t so easy to spot, and their effects can be 
dangerous because you don’t know your pet is sick or infected
until the infection becomes advanced. Internal parasites, such as
worms and protozoa, can invade your Shih Tzu through a flea or
mosquito bite, contact with infected animal waste or food, or the
mother during pregnancy or nursing. Many pups are born with
worms, and a vet typically deworms them during the initial exam.
Internal parasites can cause diarrhea, intestinal blockage, heart
failure, or even death. For this reason, all pets should be protected
against internal parasites, both through deworming at the vet and
worm prevention medication.
Chapter 13: Handling Important Shih Tzu Health Issues 187

Heartworms
One of the most dangerous and potentially fatal internal parasites
is the heartworm. Mosquitoes transmit heartworm larvae by biting
an infected dog and then biting an unaffected dog and passing
along the tiny worms. The worms then grow inside the dog and,
in their adult form, live in the pulmonary artery of the heart.
Although heartworm is hard to detect because usually dogs
don’t show any signs until the infection is advanced, fortunately
preventing it is easy. Every year, your Shih Tzu should get a heart-
worm test from the vet and should be on monthly heartworm med-
ication, during mosquito season or all year long (ask your vet which
method is better for your dog and your climate). If your dog does
develop heartworm, your vet can treat the disease with medication,
and your dog must not exercise vigorously for about four weeks so
the body can break down and eliminate the worms without too much
cardiovascular activity to get in the way.
In warm climates, give the monthly medication year round.
Heartworm pills are easy to administer and are tasty (like a
treat). If you keep your dog on heartworm preventive, you
don’t need to worry about your Shih Tzu getting heartworm.
Hookworms
Hookworms are internal blood suckers often transmitted from
mother to puppies during pregnancy or nursing, but infection can
even occur through the skin. Older or sick dogs can also be prone
to hookworm infection. Most pets acquire hookworms before they
go home with their owners, but keep your home and yard clean 
to prevent hookworms in your own environment. Hygiene matters.
Hookworms can cause anemia, gastrointestinal conditions like diar-
rhea and vomiting, loss of appetite, weakness, and weight loss.
Responsible breeders deworm puppies during nursing and keep
puppy areas clean to prevent the presence of hookworms. If your
vet determines that your Shih Tzu has hookworms (by doing a
fecal test, testing the dog’s poop), she’ll prescribe a deworming
medication.
Roundworms
Dogs catch roundworms by eating the eggs, which could be in soil
or feces, while in the womb or by nursing from an infected dog, or
by catching an infected animal and eating it. Good breeders typically
deworm puppies to guard against roundworms (and other worms),
but if your Shih Tzu has roundworms, you’ll have to take care of it.
Your vet can detect roundworms through a fecal test.
Part III: Caring for Your Chinese Charmer 
188

You don’t want these critters or their eggs in your home or yard.
Not only can the worms infect dogs, but also they can infect humans,
especially people who are gardening or otherwise in contact with
the soil (children are most frequently affected, although infections
in humans are rare and more common in densely populated hot 
climates with poor sanitation). Symptoms include gastrointestinal
distress, such as vomiting or vomiting including the actual worms,
which can be startlingly large, and an inflated belly and even intes-
tinal obstruction. If your vet determines your dog has roundworms,
she’ll prescribe a deworming medication.
Tapeworms
Tapeworms come from flea infestation. When your dogs has fleas
and licks and bites at his skin, he may swallow an infected flea,
which starts the tapeworm infection. These worms attach to the
small intestine wall and can grow to eight inches long! Sometimes,
parts of the tapeworm break off and dogs pass them. When this
happens, sometimes you can see the squirmy pieces around your
dog’s anus. They look like little moving pieces of rice. (Ewwww!)
The best prevention of tapeworms is prevention of fleas (see the
“Fleas” section earlier). If your dog acts sick, and you know fleas
are present in your area or if your dog has had flea problems, it
may be tapeworm. Symptoms of tapeworms include severe weight
loss, anal irritation, vomiting, and weakness. If you suspect tape-
worms, your vet can do a fecal exam and prescribe medication.
Whipworms
Whipworms live in the dog’s small intestine. Dogs usually get these
whip-shaped worms by drinking water or eating food that contains
whipworm eggs, which live in the soil where animals can easily pick
them up. Whipworm can cause intestinal inflammation, diarrhea,
weight loss, hemorrhaging, and anemia.
As with many other worms, your vet can diagnose whipworms
through a fecal exam, and your vet can prescribe a deworming
medication. Prevent whipworms by having new puppies dewormed
and keeping your dog in a clean environment.
Protozoal infections
Usually harmless, protozoa are one-celled organisms all over our
environment. But a few types of this infection can cause serious
gastrointestinal distress, which includes diarrhea, vomiting, and
consequentially, dehydration, weight loss, and weakness.
Some common protozoa include giardia and coccidian. If your dog
has unexplained gastrointestinal distress, see your vet, who can
Chapter 13: Handling Important Shih Tzu Health Issues 189

test for protozoal infections and give you a prescription medica-
tion to kill the nasty little invaders.
Emergency, Emergency! 
What to Do ASAP
If emergency strikes — and sometimes, despite everyone’s best
intentions, it does — your Shih Tzu has the best chance of recov-
ery if you act fast and appropriately. Of course, you need to know
first what constitutes an emergency and where you need to take
your Shih Tzu if you do face an emergency.
You can’t dash off to the emergency veterinary clinic if you don’t
know where it is. Ask your vet what you should do if you ever have
an emergency situation. Should you call or go to the office or is there
an emergency or after-hours clinic you should know about? If the
emergency vet clinic is in a separate location from your vet, pay
them a visit once, so you’re sure you know how to get there.
Part III: Caring for Your Chinese Charmer 
190
How to take your Shih Tzu’s temperature
Sometimes, your vet will want to know if your dog has a fever. Dogs have a higher
body temperature than humans, with a normal temperature of about 100 to 102.5
rectally, but you can’t just feel a dog’s forehead to guess if he has a fever. Instead,
you need to insert a thermometer into his rectum.
Believe me, the dog doesn’t like it any more than you do, but that doesn’t mean you
can skip this often important task. To take your dog’s temperature, follow these
steps:
1. Use a mercury or digital rectal or oral thermometer and reset it or shake it
down.
2. Coat the thermometer with petroleum jelly to lubricate it.
3. Holding the dog still, lift up his tail and slowly and gently insert the ther-
mometer about one inch into the rectum, just under the tail.
Be prepared to hold him steady.
4. Hold the thermometer and the dog still for about two minutes for the mercury
thermometer or until the digital thermometer beeps.
5. Remove the thermometer and read the results.
If your dog’s temperature is below 100 degrees or over 104, call your veterinar-
ian immediately.

Someday you may be very glad you did. Everyone else in your
household should know where the emergency clinic is, too.
To prepare yourself and your family for an emergency, post this
and other important emergency information in a visible place,
such as on the refrigerator or on the inside door of the medicine
cabinet:
 The emergency veterinary clinic’s name, phone number,
address, and directions, just in case someone other than you
needs to know
 Your regular vet’s name, phone number, address, and office
hours
 The number of the Animal Poison Control Center Hotline:
888-426-4435 (Have your credit card ready, too — a $55 
consultation fee may apply.)
The next section gives you a better idea whether certain situations
really are emergencies, so you know what to look for and how to
respond before an actual emergency happens. This section also
identifies some common Shih Tzu emergencies.
Recognizing emergencies
You may not always be sure whether you should call the vet or
rush your dog straight to the emergency vet clinic. Knowing which
action to take can save your dog’s life!
In general, go immediately to the emergency vet clinic if your Shih
Tzu experiences any of the following:
 Trauma, such as a fall, fight with an animal, getting shut in a
door, or hit by a car
 Signs of a seizure (see the “Seizures and other neurological
problems” section later in this chapter)
 Any evidence of a broken bone, head trauma, or a bleeding
wound
 Severe gagging or getting something stuck in his throat
 Extreme vomiting or diarrhea that won’t stop
 Any sudden, extreme behavioral change
 Refusal to move or a sudden yelp after jumping off furniture
or coming downstairs and then reluctance to move
 Limp rear legs, dragging the rear legs, or any other sign of
paralysis
Chapter 13: Handling Important Shih Tzu Health Issues 191

 Abnormal discharge from the nose, eyes, or other body 
openings
 Non-responsiveness, lethargy, loss of consciousness, or 
collapse
Sometimes, you should call the vet but don’t necessarily need to
rush into the office. Give the vet a call if your Shih Tzu experiences
any of the following:
 Occasional vomiting or diarrhea for more than one day
 Loss of appetite
 Noticeable increase in thirst and/or urination
 Poop that looks different than normal
 Restlessness or unusual hyperactivity
 Any sign of moderate pain, such as yelping when you touch
her
 Signs of parasites like fleas or ticks
 Skin rash, hair loss, or itching
Giving pet CPR
If your Shih Tzu collapses and stops breathing, you have no time 
to lose. You can perform CPR on your Shih Tzu, preferably while
someone else transports you both to the emergency vet clinic.
Ask your vet to show you how to perform CPR on a small dog during
your next vet visit, before you ever need to do it (and I hope you
never will!). If you haven’t had any instruction and find yourself in
a position where you need to perform pet CPR, here are the basic
directions:
1. Put your Shih Tzu on his side, being careful not to
overextend his neck.
2. Check for foreign objects in his throat, swiping with a
hooked finger to remove anything blocking his airway.
3. Gently pull your Shih Tzu’s tongue forward so it’s even
with his teeth (to prevent the tongue from slipping back
into his throat) and close the dog’s mouth.
4. Exhale gently into the dog’s nostrils, hard enough that
you can see his chest expanding.
Doing so makes his chest inflate.
Part III: Caring for Your Chinese Charmer 
192

5. Take your mouth off the dog and let him exhale naturally.
6. Repeat, giving one breath about every two seconds,
checking for breathing after every four to five breaths.
If your dog starts breathing, stop breathing for him. If your
dog’s heart isn’t beating (you can’t hear a heartbeat when
you put your ear to his chest), begin chest compressions
as follows:
1. Place the dog on a firm flat surface on his right
side.
2. Cup your hands and put them on both sides of the
rib cage at the level of the dog’s elbows (above the
heart.)
If the dog is a puppy or a very small dog (less than
ten pounds), use your thumbs instead of your hands).
3. Squeeze on both sides of the chest and then release.
A squeeze and release should take about one second.
If your Shih Tzu isn’t breathing and doesn’t have a heartbeat, you
can do artificial breathing and chest compressions at the same
time. Give one breath for every three to five chest squeezes.
Identifying common Shih 
Tzu emergencies
When an emergency strikes, it can be pretty scary. If you aren’t
prepared, you may panic. This section gives you some preparation,
so if an emergency does happen, you’ll be ready. (I hope you never
need to use this info, but if you do, you’ll be glad you have it.)
Accidents and injuries: Watch where you step!
Some of the most common kinds of emergency situations involving
small dogs are accidents and injuries. If you step on or drop a small
puppy, he can break a bone! Because the Shih Tzu doesn’t have
very strong front legs, a common accident is a broken jaw — the
dog jumps down off a high surface or someone drops him, and he
lands on his chin. Small dogs can also be injured by being struck
by a door, or by jumping off a piece of furniture that’s too high.
To prevent accidents and injuries, remember these rules:
 Never let small children carry around or play roughly with
a Shih Tzu. (Check out Chapter 7 for more info.)
Chapter 13: Handling Important Shih Tzu Health Issues 193

 Try not to let a Shih Tzu jump off high furniture, and never
drop a Shih Tzu or let him jump from your arms. Remember
a Shih Tzu is a small dog and a long drop can hurt him.
 Always watch where you step, especially when you step
backwards. Shih Tzu like to follow their people around and
are often standing behind you.
 Look before you shut the door, recline the recliner, or turn
on the dryer. Make sure your Shih Tzu isn’t in the way!
 Keep your Shih Tzu away from traffic. A no-brainer.
 Keep your Shih Tzu protected from dogs that might attack.
Keep him on a leash and away from strange dogs unless both
dogs are on leash and under control by a responsible adult.
If your dog has an accident, like a fall off a bed or a scuffle with
another dog, but seems fine, call the vet anyway. The vet may want
to see your dog or may tell what to watch out for. If, after an accident,
your Shih Tzu acts hurt, yelps in pain, limps, has a visible wound,
stops eating and hangs his tongue out of his mouth (a sign of a
painful jaw), or acts strange in any way — fearful, non-responsive,
aggressive, or any other uncharacteristic behavior — go to the vet
or emergency vet clinic immediately.
Poison
If your Shih Tzu gets into something poisonous, from deadly
antifreeze to spoiled food to chocolate to household chemicals
or human medications, you need to act fast. If you know or
suspect what your Shih Tzu ingested, call your vet or the ASPCA
Animal Poison Control Center hotline (888-426-4435).
Many other health problems can cause the same symptoms, but
according to what the poison is, signs of poisoning can include 
collapse, diarrhea, distress, lethargy, seizure, and vomiting. If
your dog vomits or has diarrhea, give your vet a call and keep
an eye on your dog. If she experiences other marked behavioral
changes, seems extremely anxious, or becomes non-responsive,
has a seizure, or collapses, go immediately to the vet or emergency
clinic. If you think you know what poison she has ingested, take it
with you.
In some cases, the vet or poison control center may advise you to
induce vomiting using ipecac syrup or hydrogen peroxide, both
of which you should have in your first aid kit (see the list for what
your first aid kit should contain, in the sidebar “Your Shih Tzu first
aid kit”). In other cases, vomiting can make the problem worse, so
never induce vomiting unless a qualified pro tells you to do so.
Part III: Caring for Your Chinese Charmer 
194

Chapter 13: Handling Important Shih Tzu Health Issues 195
Your Shih Tzu first aid kit
In the case of an accident, injury, poisoning, or any other emergency, having a well-
stocked first-aid kit can provide you with the supplies you need, right when you need
them. Don’t ever give your dog any medicine without a vet’s or poison control
center’s advice first, and make a note of all dosages appropriate for your dogs to
keep with all medicine in the first aid kit. Keep your first-aid kit in an easily acces-
sible place, and if you use up any supplies in the kit, replace them right away. Your
canine first aid kit should contain the following items:
❑Antibiotic ointment — to prevent infection
❑Bandage scissors
❑Benadryl tablets — for allergic reactions and stings
❑Blanket — to keep the dog warm or still
❑Buffered aspirin — for fever and pain
❑Copies of all vet records
❑Cotton balls — to clean small wounds or apply medication
❑Ear wash — to help clear debris from ears
❑Elastic athletic bandage — the kind that sticks to itself so you don’t have to tie
or clip it
❑Eye wash — to help clear debris from eyes
❑Gauze bandages — to wrap wounds
❑Gauze pads — to help stop bleeding
❑Hydrocortisone crème — for rashes and allergic reactions
❑Hydrogen peroxide — for sterilization and wound cleaning or to induce vomiting
❑Ipecac syrup — to induce vomiting in case of poisoning
❑Phone number for the Animal Poison Control Center hotline: 888-426-4435
❑Rubbing alcohol — for sterilization
❑Small splint — to stabilize broken or injured limbs
❑Stomach distress tablets
❑Thermometer — digital or mercury
❑Veterinary and emergency clinic contact information and driving directions
❑Water-soluble lubricant — to insert thermometers

The very real danger of heatstroke
Shih Tzu can’t stand the hot weather because
 Their short noses and squished-in faces make them less 
efficient at self-cooling. Dogs cool the air they breathe as
it moves through their muzzles, but because the Shih Tzu’s
muzzle is so short and not particularly efficient, the air doesn’t
cool down very much before it enters the lungs.
 Their long coats act as insulation. A long coat can be great
when Lola has to go outside in the winter, but this coat is
entirely unsuited for hot humid weather. Puppies, overweight
Shih Tzu, and dehydrated dogs are at even greater risk for
heatstroke. (Many pet owners shave their Shih Tzu’s body
coat during the summer to keep them cooler — a comfortable
and sensible option for pets.)
Signs of heatstroke include bright red gums, labored breathing and
panting, weakness, nonresponsiveness, and collapse. You can take
the following precautions to ensure that your Shih Tzu doesn’t suffer
from heatstroke:
 Keep your Shih Tzu inside in a cool environment when
the weather gets hot or humid. Taking your Shih Tzu out for
short bathroom breaks and brief play sessions are okay. Just
make sure that you supervise your Shih Tzu at all times.
 Always be sure your Shih Tzu has plenty of fresh water. A
dehydrated dog overheats much more quickly, and dogs get
dehydrated more easily in the hot weather.
 Never leave a Shih Tzu in a parked car! Even if the tempera-
ture outside isn’t all that hot, the car acts like a greenhouse
when the sun shines on it, and the temperature inside the
car can quickly skyrocket far above the temperature outside.
When the day is warm and sunny, take your Shih Tzu with you
in a carrier when you leave the car or leave her home.
If you suspect your Shih Tzu has heatstroke, take steps to cool
your dog immediately — put him in front of a fan or in cool water.
And then call the vet or emergency vet clinic. Take Samson’s tem-
perature rectally, and if it is more than 105 degrees, call the vet.
(Check out the sidebar, “How to take your Shih Tzu’s temperature”
earlier in this chapter for more info.)
If your dog has collapsed, go to the vet immediately. If your dog’s
temperature is above 105 degrees, your vet will probably give intra-
venous fluids to hydrate your dog and may give other medication
appropriate to any symptoms. The vet may also immerse your dog
in cool water or even give oxygen therapy.
Part III: Caring for Your Chinese Charmer 
196

Choking, coughing, wheezing, and gagging
Short-faced breeds like Shih Tzu tend to snore and snuffle a lot, and
those with the flattest faces tend to do it more. However, sometimes
choking, coughing, wheezing, and gagging can be a sign of more seri-
ous conditions. These conditions include choking, heart disease,
internal injury, kennel cough, respiratory obstruction or infection,
an allergic reaction, or a side effect from some other serious disease.
If your Shih Tzu starts choking, drooling, gagging, and having trouble
breathing, if he starts vomiting or acts very distressed and paws at
his mouth, he probably does have something in his throat. Take
these steps to help your dog.
1. Immediately remove your Shih Tzu’s collar.
2. If you can see the object in the throat, carefully hook
your finger and swipe inside his mouth.
Be careful not to push anything that may be stuck in his
throat.
3. If Step 2 doesn’t work, carefully hold your Shih Tzu by
the hind legs, head down, to see if gravity can help dis-
lodge the object.
If you can’t get the object out, go to your vet or emergency
vet clinic immediately. Choking is an emergency. Even if
you do remove the object, call the vet and schedule an
appointment to be sure your dog doesn’t have any kind of
throat injury.
If you don’t see anything, chances are, your Shih Tzu is having an
issue with his trachea, which is common in small dogs and can be
aggravated by pulling on a collar. Collapsing trachea can be a seri-
ous condition in Toy breeds, so if your Shih Tzu gags and coughs a
lot, have the vet check it out.
Shih Tzu also have a condition called reverse-sneezing, a strange
but common thing many dogs do in which they start rapidly inhal-
ing through the nose while standing still. The dog may make gasp-
ing or snorting sounds and his eyes may look like they’re bulging.
Reverse sneezing looks scary, but it’s perfectly harmless and usu-
ally only lasts for a few seconds or up to a minute or two. You can
easily stop a reverse sneeze by gently pressing your dog’s nostrils
together for a few seconds, until normal breathing resumes.
Finally, never ever leave your dog tied out on a leash unsupervised.
The dog can choke and gag pulling on the leash and damage his
trachea. Also, many dogs accidentally hang themselves over the
edges of decks or porches or get tangled up and strangled, and if a
wandering dog attacks, the dog can’t get away.
Chapter 13: Handling Important Shih Tzu Health Issues 197

Gastrointestinal distress: Did that just come out of my dog?
Many dogs suffer from short-term gastrointestinal distress if they
eat something they aren’t used to, but parasites or other health
problems can also cause gastrointestinal problems like vomiting,
diarrhea, constipation, bloating, and general tummy pain.
Gastrointestinal problems can be signs of many different issues
that any gastrointestinal distress lasting more than one day is
worth asking you vet about. Give your vet a call and describe the
symptoms. She can tell you whether you need to bring your dog in.
If you have a young puppy, vomiting and diarrhea is more urgent.
Shih Tzu puppies are small and can quickly become dehydrated
and malnourished, so call your vet right away if your young puppy
has more than one or two episodes of vomiting or diarrhea.
Seizures and other neurological problems
Shaking, stiffness, collapsing, sudden unexplained aggression,
a vacant stare, or failing to respond to your voice or touch can
be signs of a seizure. Other neurological signs include confusion,
stumbling, stiffness, bumping into things, seeming to get lost in
a familiar place, and biting or growling for no reason. If you think
your dog is exhibiting any symptoms, call the vet immediately.
Your Shih Tzu may have epilepsy or another serious problem.
Understanding Common 
Shih Tzu Health Issues
Every dog has the potential to develop a serious health problem,
and any dog can get any disease. With mixed breeds, you never
know what you’re getting, but with purebred dogs, you have a
better idea which diseases — particularly, genetic diseases —
your breed is prone to develop.
Like all other breeds, Shih Tzu have a few genetic vulnerabilities.
The following section covers some of the more common genetic
diseases Shih Tzu can sometimes get. You also find out what to
watch for and what to do if your dog is diagnosed with one.
Dental problems
Shih Tzu, like most other Toy breeds, are prone to crooked teeth,
missing teeth, tooth decay, gum disease, and early tooth loss. They
don’t have much space in their mouths, so sometimes teeth get
overcrowded and crooked. Tooth pain and loss can result in the
Part III: Caring for Your Chinese Charmer 
198

inability to eat, and gum disease can cause early death because
dental bacteria can get into the bloodstream and into the heart.
Keep your Shih Tzu’s teeth clean and have your vet check your
dog’s teeth at every vet visit. Many Shih Tzu need annual dental
cleanings, which require a general anesthetic. The risk of the anes-
thesia is less, in most cases, than the risk of serious problems related
to tooth decay and gum disease.
Allergies and other skin problems
Allergies may or may not be genetic. Many people suspect they’re
environmental. However, if your Shih Tzu develops skin problems,
such as a rash, hives, or weepy itchy sores, then he may be allergic
to a food, something in the air, flea bites, or even to poor grooming.
Some dogs can develop an allergy to a household product, such as
a carpet cleaner or deodorizers.
Good grooming and a good diet go a long way toward keeping your
Shih Tzu’s skin and coat strong and healthy. Good health equals a
strong immune system, and that can help to keep allergies and many
other health problems at bay. Poor grooming can also cause skin
problems. A mat left untangled can trap bacteria and moisture, and
a hot spot (a red, weepy, extremely painful wound) can form.
See your vet to diagnose any skin irritation or conditions. Your 
vet may advise changing your Shih Tzu’s food and may prescribe
steroids or other medications.
Breathing problems
Because Shih Tzu have flat faces and short noses, their nasal pas-
sages are squished compared to some other breeds. They have
less space for cooling the air they breathe before it reaches the
lungs and breathing passages that don’t always work very well.
Many Shih Tzu are prone to snoring, snorting, and snuffling, not to
mention wheezing, coughing, and overheating. To help your Shih
Tzu breathe as well as he can, practice these general care tips:
 Always keep your Shih Tzu cool and well hydrated.
 Avoid hot humid weather and always give him fresh clean water.
 If your dog tends to wheeze and cough when he pulls on a
leash, use a harness instead of a collar.
 If your dog wheezes or coughs when he gets over-excited,
calm him down with soothing words.
Chapter 13: Handling Important Shih Tzu Health Issues 199

 Recognize that snorting and snoring are all part of a Shih
Tzu’s charm, but if your Shih Tzu ever seems to be having
a real problem breathing, call the vet immediately.
Eye problems
Many dogs suffer from genetic eye diseases, and the Shih Tzu is no
exception. Your dog may suffer from any of the following:
 Cherry eye: If you notice a large swollen red lump on your dog’s
eye, don’t be alarmed. He probably has cherry eye, a problem in
which a tear gland comes loose and bulges out from under the
eyelid. Call your vet, who can perform a simple corrective sur-
gery to reposition the tear gland and secure it.
 Dry eye: Many Shih Tzu have insufficient tear production
resulting in a problem called dry eye, or keratoconjunctivitis
sicca. The result: Dry, painful eyes and irritated corneas,
plus thick sticky eye discharge. Dry eyes are also more
prone to infection and even ulceration, resulting in blindness.
Fortunately, applying moisturizing eyedrops every day can
keep your Shih Tzu’s dry eyes more comfortable. Your vet can
also prescribe medication for severe cases. In most cases, treat-
ment for dry eye must continue throughout your Shih Tzu’s
life, but adding eyedrops to your dog’s normal grooming regi-
men isn’t too inconvenient (refer to Chapter 10 for more).
 Progressive retinal atrophy (PRA): PRA is of the most common
eye diseases. This degenerative eye disease results in eventual
blindness and usually affects older dogs. This condition is
genetic; dogs with this condition shouldn’t be bred.
 Juvenile cataracts: They occur in young dogs and also result
in blindness. This condition is genetic and dogs with this dis-
ease should never be bred.
Responsible breeders have the eyes on their breeding dogs
checked and certified as disease-free by a veterinary ophthal-
mologist. If your Shih Tzu develops PRA or juvenile cataracts,
she’ll probably eventually go blind, but talk to your vet. And,
by the way, blind dogs can live happy and successful lives, so
these diseases aren’t a death sentence.
Other eye diseases that sometimes occur in Shih Tzu are related to
the Shih Tzu’s short face, which leaves less room for eye develop-
ment. Some of these problems are
 Logaphthalmos: A structural problem in which the dog can’t
close his eyes all the way
 Keratitus: Inflamed cornea
Part III: Caring for Your Chinese Charmer 
200

 Distichiasis: Abnormally formed eyelashes that can scratch
and scar the cornea
 Ectopia cilia: Eyelashes grow out of the wrong place causing
pain and scarring
Joint (and back) problems
Some Shih Tzu develop joint (and back) problems, particularly as
they get older and gain more weight. Three common problems in
Shih Tzu include
 Luxating patellas: Also called slipping kneecaps. If your Shih
Tzu suddenly yelps and then refuses to walk on one leg, hop-
ping around or stretching it out, chances are good that his
kneecap has slipped out of place. Many dogs have a mild 
case of this and figure how to pop their kneecaps back in by
stretching, but if your dog has a severe case, a simple surgery
can correct the problem. Your vet can determine how severe
the luxation is by feeling the kneecap.
 Hip dysplasia: This is a degenerative condition in which the
hip bone doesn’t sit tightly in the socket. As the dog ages, the
friction from this improper fit can cause arthritis and pain. In
mild cases, vets typically prescribe pain medication. Many vets
also recommend glucosamine and chondroitin supplements to
keep joints functioning well and reduce pain. In severe cases,
hip replacement surgery can correct the problem.
 Spinal disk ruptures: Many dogs with long backs are also
prone to this problem. This isn’t as common in Shih Tzu as
in some other breeds like Dachshunds, but it can happen. If
your dog suddenly yelps, especially after jumping down from
a high spot, and then refuses to move, call the vet immediately.
A disk rupture is an emergency, and without immediate treat-
ment, the dog can become paralyzed.
Juvenile renal dysplasia
One of the better known genetic problems some Shih Tzu have is
juvenile renal dysplasia, a serious kidney disease. Dogs with juvenile
renal dysplasia are born with immature kidneys that fail to mature
normally and result in reduced kidney function and eventual death
from kidney failure.
Signs of juvenile renal dysplasia in puppies and young dogs include
the following excessive thirst and urination — urine is often almost
clear, rather than a normal yellow color (you may notice this if your
dog is paper trained) — as well as slow growth, weight loss, fatigue,
Chapter 13: Handling Important Shih Tzu Health Issues 201

loss of appetite, vomiting, dehydration, and weakness. Some dogs
show no symptoms and can pass on the disease. Fortunately, a
genetic test is now available that can detect both of the two genetic
mutations involved in juvenile renal dysplasia. These tests are 100
percent accurate and non-invasive. Breeders swab the dogs’ cheeks
and send in the cheek swab for analysis. Your breeder should have
this test done on the parents of the litter, so they know the puppies
won’t have this disease.
If your Shih Tzu puppy starts drinking large amounts of water, ask
your vet about the possibility of juvenile renal dysplasia. Treatment
includes dietary changes and easing uncomfortable symptoms.
Liver disease
Shih Tzu sometimes develop liver disease in the form of chronic
hepatitis. Symptoms can include energy loss, weight loss, jaundice,
and even death. Some dogs show no symptoms. A vet can examine
a Shih Tzu’s liver via ultrasound and can advise you on treatment.
Another liver condition Shih Tzu can develop is called canine portal
caval shunt, or liver shunt disease. This disease results in an inade-
quate processing of ammonia. Blood is diverted around the liver
and doesn’t get detoxified in the body. Symptoms can include weight
loss, poor growth, fatigue, depression, diarrhea, vomiting, drooling,
excessive thirst and urination, and behavioral changes. In severe
cases, the dog can lapse into a coma or even show signs of demen-
tia. If your Shih Tzu develops liver shunt disease, your vet may
advise treating the disease with medicine and/or surgery.
Part III: Caring for Your Chinese Charmer 
202
Give a dog a pill
Some dogs gobble up pills if you sneak them into something really yummy like a
small piece of meat or bit of peanut butter, but others aren’t so easily fooled. If your
Shih Tzu manages to spit out the pill every time, you’ll need to give her that med-
ication a little more efficiently. Here’s how:
1. Hold your Shih Tzu’s head and gently slip your fingers inside the sides of her
mouth, coaxing her mouth open.
2. Put the pill in your other hand, and place it as far back on her tongue as you
can, pushing it down in.
Try not to make her gag.
3. Close her mouth and hold it closed while rubbing her nose, which makes her
swallow.
4. Afterwards, tell her she’s a very good dog and give her a little treat.

Safely with Your Shih Tzu
In This Chapter
 Planning the best way to bring your Shih Tzu along
 Leaving your Shih Tzu with friends, family, or a pet sitter
 Finding your Shih Tzu a temporary home away from home when you travel
E
verybody needs to get away now and then. But when you travel,
whether you go away for a day or a month, you have to decide
whether you can, or should, bring your Shih Tzu along with you.
Shih Tzu usually travel well, and most of the time, Lola and Samson
would rather be with you anyway. However, you can’t always take a
dog where you’re going, and being the responsible dog owner that
you are, you want to think of all your options.
This chapter tells you everything you need to know about traveling
with your Shih Tzu, as well as leaving him home or at a doggy day-
care or boarding kennel when you travel. You’ll feel much better pre-
pared to make the right decision when you have all the information,
so you can feel comfortable knowing that Lola really is better off at
home with that nice pet sitter, or Samson really is happier resting
in his little box beneath your seat on the airplane.
Taking Your Shih Tzu with You
Traveling with dogs can be fun. They keep you company, they get to
see new places and meet new people, and you have new experiences
together. But traveling with your dog can be difficult. You have to
remember to bring everything your dog needs, and you have to
watch her to make sure she doesn’t get lost, stolen, or injured.
Most Shih Tzu travel well because they’re small and relatively
adaptable, especially if they’re well trained and socialized. But

are you going to a place your Shih Tzu can go? Think about the fol-
lowing when deciding whether to take your Shih Tzu:
 Are you staying at a pet-friendly hotel or with friends who
don’t mind a dog visitor? Check with hotels first. Some have
fees for pets and some don’t allow them.
 If you fly, does the airline allow pets? Will the airline let you
take your Shih Tzu in the cabin in the proper kind of enclosure?
How much does flying with your Shih Tzu cost? Check with
the airline before you make your reservation.
 If you drive, can you stop every few hours for potty breaks
and exercise? Remember, most dogs have to pee every few
hours, and puppies may need to have a potty break even
more often. Furthermore, do you have a dog seatbelt or crate
that can strap into the car with a seatbelt so your Shih Tzu is
safe in an accident or even a sudden stop? (Check out Chapter 6
for more on finding the right dog seatbelt.)
 When you arrive at your destination, will your schedule
include activities that your Shih Tzu can do, too? Is the
place safe for dogs? Are dogs allowed? Or does she have to
stay in the hotel room for many hours, while you’re in a con-
ference for 12 hours? If so, think again about bringing her.
If you decide that you really do want to travel with your Shih Tzu,
and that doing so will be better and more fun for both of you, read
on for more info about how to manage the trips.
Riding in cars with dogs
You and Samson are flying down the highway, wind in your hair,
heads hanging out the window, tongues wagging . . . but wait one
minute! Apply the brakes.
This picture of freedom may sound fantastic, but in reality, the dog
shouldn’t be loose in the car. He can easily jump on you and distract
you from the road or get tossed around in a sudden stop, or even
worse, Samson can get seriously injured or injure the driver or pas-
sengers in a car accident. Plus, if he sees something out the window,
he may want to jump out the car. No matter how fun having your
little dog wandering around or curling up on your lap while you
drive sounds, it just isn’t safe.
The bottom line: You want to keep your dog safe. But that doesn’t
mean he can’t have fun while you ride down the highway. Some dog
seatbelts allow freedom of movement so the dog can look out the
window, if not hang his head out there in the wind. If you decide to
Part III: Caring for Your Chinese Charmer 
204

put your dog in a crate instead of in a dog seatbelt, he’ll be comfort-
able and in a familiar place. Just take him out every few hours so
he can have a bathroom break and stretch his legs a bit.
No matter what happens, never leave your Shih Tzu alone in the car
on a warm day — even when the temperature is just 70 degrees and
the weather is sunny, a car can heat up to dangerous levels, putting
your dog at serious risk of heatstroke. And don’t just think cracking
the windows or rolling them down will make a huge difference. The
car can still get too hot, and a Shih Tzu alone in a car with the win-
dows open is an invitation for dog thieves. Put on the leash and
take your dog with you, even if you’re just going to the bathroom.
Leaving on a jet plane
I don’t normally recommend flying with dogs because too many
things can happen when you and the dog get separated and the
dog has to ride in the baggage compartment under the plane. Is
it too hot down there? Too cold? What if he gets out? But some 
airlines let small dogs ride in carriers with you in the cabin, and
this kind of travel is better. However, before you traipse off to the
airport, check into a few things first.
Some airlines, such as Air Canada, specifically forbid pets in the
cabin. Others don’t put them in cargo. Some allow both. Airlines
generally have very specific rules about traveling with pets, and
these can change regularly, so be sure to check.
No matter what you see in print or on a Web site about an airline’s
rules and regulations regarding pets, always call the airline and find
out for yourself, in case the rules have changed. Be sure to ask the
Chapter 14: Traveling (Or Not Traveling) Safely with Your Shih Tzu 205
Across the pond
If you travel overseas with your dog, check before making your travel plans about
what documentation you must have before leaving the country. Some countries
require dogs to stay in quarantine for days or even weeks before entering, but others
(like England) have recently reduced or eliminated this requirement if you have the
right paperwork.
Your travel agent may be able to find out this info for you, or check www.
pettravel.com for updated pet immigration and quarantine info for more than
100 countries. It can take up to six months to get all the appropriate paperwork for
taking a dog into another country, so plan ahead!

following questions, and get everything confirmed in writing (bring
this info with you to the airport to avoid any misunderstanding):
 Am I allowed to bring my dog in the cabin?
 What are the requirements for the crate or kennel my dog
must be in while in the cabin?
 Can I take my dog out of the carrier during the flight?
 Do you have limits on how many pets can ride in a cabin on a
single flight?
 Can you guarantee that my dog will have a spot on the flight?
 What’s the extra charge for flying with a dog?
Finding pet-friendly lodging
More and more hotels allow dogs, especially small dogs. In fact,
many hotels allow dogs and cats weighing less than 20 pounds, so
your little Shih Tzu is just fine. Many hotels don’t allow any pets,
however, and those that do often charge for the privilege, so be pre-
pared to pay extra. The hotel may also charge a damage deposit,
which you can have back if your dog doesn’t trash the room.
Businesses open and close often and policies change, so always
call ahead to confirm information. To guide you in your choices,
however, a few good Web sites can help you track down the hotels,
motels, and even campgrounds and recreational areas that give a
thumbs-up to dogs. Check out these sites:
 www.dogfriendly.com: This site includes dog city guides,
beach guides, RV park and campground guides, hiking guides,
off-leash dog park guides, outdoor dining guides, and state-
specific search features for hotels. The site also has a ton of
great travel info, links to dog-friendly apartments, and even
dog camps as well as road trip prep, traveling etiquette, airline
policies, and breed-specific laws. If you like to travel with your
dog, you’ll love this site.

ing including vacation rentals, as well as dog-friendly beaches,

No matter what hotel you choose, you should also always keep
your Shih Tzu on his leash in any new surroundings like hotel 
parking lots, parks, rest stops, and recreational areas.
Packing your Shih Tzu’s suitcase
Traveling with a dog is much easier if you have everything you need
with you. If you travel frequently, make copies of the following list.
Before you leave on your trip, check off the important items that
you need to bring:
❑Leash, collar or harness, and identification tags: Never take
off your Shih Tzu’s identification tag while traveling. Despite
your best efforts, your Shih Tzu can get lost and ID tags
ensure that your dog can find his way back to you.
❑Enough food to last through the trip: Bring some extra food
just in case you run out. Make sure the food is sealed in an air-
tight container.
❑Familiar food and water bowls: Some stressed-out dogs may
not want to eat or drink from strange containers.
❑Water from home: Water isn’t the same everywhere you go.
Different chemical makeup and bacteria can cause your dog
to get an upset stomach, so bring some water your dog is
used to drinking.
❑Motion sickness remedies: Some dogs actually do get motion
sickness when riding in cars or airplanes. Talk to your vet
about medication or natural remedies that can alleviate
motion sickness for dogs and what symptoms to look for.
❑Familiar blankets, pillows, and toys: These items can make
your Shih Tzu feel like he isn’t too far from home. They also
have familiar scents that your dog will recognize.
❑First-aid kit, just in case of an emergency: If you have a kit for
humans, it can work for your dog, too.
❑Copies of paperwork: Take vaccination records, proof of
rabies vaccine, license/registration paperwork, and any other
paperwork you may need when crossing borders, boarding
Chapter 14: Traveling (Or Not Traveling) Safely with Your Shih Tzu 207

your dog in a different city, or visiting locations where this
info is required.
❑Drugs: Take along prescriptions or any other medication and/
or supplements your dog normally takes.
If you forget to pack something, you may be able to stop at a nearby
pet store for some items. However, other items, such as your dog’s
ID and vaccine records, are vital, so don’t leave home without them.
Leaving Your Shih Tzu at Home
If traveling with your pet sounds like a lot of trouble, well, frankly,
sometimes it is. The hassle of traveling depends on the kind of trip
you take. Sure, Lola thinks she wants to go with you, but you might
consider making other arrangements for your Shih Tzu if your trip
includes any of the following:
 Long periods where you can’t be with your dog
 Visits to friends who don’t like dogs or are allergic to dogs or
don’t have accommodations for dogs
 Business trips where you have a lot on your mind and won’t
be able to be tuned-in to your dog and her needs
 Visits to recreational areas with activities that exclude dogs
 Trips to places that can be dangerous for your dog, such as hot
climates where your dog doesn’t have air conditioning access
Aside from these considerations, what do you want out of your vaca-
tion? If you really just want to relax without any responsibilities, you
may be better off without your dog. If you decide to leave your Shih
Tzu at home, this section helps you make arrangements.
Finding the right dog sitter
Cats might be fine and dandy alone for a week with someone peek-
ing in on them once a day to refill food and water and clean the litter
box. Dogs, however, aren’t quite the same. They need more atten-
tion and more companionship. They need exercise and interaction.
And they need to know somebody is nearby and in-charge. That
means a neighbor checking in once a day probably isn’t sufficient
for your dog, unless you’re only gone for one day. Gone longer and
you need to arrange for more extensive care for your dog, either at
home or elsewhere. Fortunately, many individuals and businesses
cater to pet owners who travel without their dogs. The following
are some options.
Part III: Caring for Your Chinese Charmer 
208

The friends-and-family option
If your mom just adores little Samson or you have other friends or
family with an already-established relationship with your dog, you
may be able to convince them to either live in your house while
you’re gone or let your Shih Tzu live with them. This experience
can be fun for everyone — your family member or friend gets to
play Shih Tzu mommy or daddy and your dog gets to hang out
with someone he already knows and trusts.
Picking a professional pet sitter
Hiring a professional pet sitter is another great option (especially 
if you don’t have a reliable person in your life who can help out —
see the previous section). Pet sitters care for pets when owners
can’t. They can stop in two or three times a day, and some even
spend the night at your house. Prices vary depending on your dog.
Before choosing a professional pet sitter, ask around for recommen-
dations to be sure you choose someone with experience, knowledge
of pet safety and pet behavior, and preferably someone who has
experience with and loves small dogs. If you haven’t heard of
anyone, ask your vet if she knows of anyone offering this service.
Most cities and even small towns have at least one pet sitter. You
can look up pet sitting in the phone book, or look at the National
Association of Professional Pet Sitters’ (NAPPS) Web site at www.
petsitters.org. You can also call (800) 296-7387.
What your caregiver needs to know
Even though your Shih Tzu is in her own home, the caregiver —
whether family member or professional pet sitter — needs to know
some important things in your absence. Be sure your caregiver has
access to and understands the following:
 Your vet’s name, address, and phone number
 A folder with vaccination records and health records
 Info on any medications, including where they are and how to
give them
 The location of the leash and collar or harness, with ID tags,
for walks or if the caregiver needs to take the dog to the vet
 The location of food, treats, and food and water bowls
 Instructions for how to feed your Shih Tzu (what, how much,
and how often) and how often to refill the water bowl and
include instructions on treats (how many and how often)
 Instructions on what not to feed the dog
Chapter 14: Traveling (Or Not Traveling) Safely with Your Shih Tzu 209

 The location of your Shih Tzu’s dog bed or crate and instruc-
tions on when he should be there
 Instructions on walking the dog, how often the dog must go
out and where, or instructions about how the dog is paper
trained for inside and how to clean up
 The location of favorite, toys, blankets, and so on
 Instructions on grooming rituals along with brushes, combs,
moisturizing eyedrops, or nail clippers (Leave this book out
and opened to Chapter 10 for essential grooming info.)
 Your emergency contact info and, if available, a friend’s name
and phone number who knows your dog
Boarding Your Shih Tzu
Sometimes, the best place for your Shih Tzu while you have to be
away isn’t at home. If a family member or friend can’t take your
dog and you can’t find a reputable pet sitter, you can have your
Shih Tzu boarded, either at a boarding kennel or, even better, at
one of the new and wonderful doggy daycare centers. The upside
to away-from-home boarding is that your dog gets to have fun with
other dogs and other well-trained people. The downside is that
some boarding facilities may not offer your dog much attention,
and your dog can catch kennel cough or fleas from other dogs.
Before you leave your Shih Tzu, check out any boarding facility
thoroughly, and get recommendations. Have a look around for
cleanliness and how things are run. You don’t want to leave your
baby just anywhere. Don’t just always judge a place by the cost; if
the good boarding facility costs a lot more, it’s probably worth it.
Some are incredibly posh and high-end, while others are no-frills.
This section discusses the pros and cons to boarding your Shih
Tzu in a reputable boarding kennel or a doggy daycare and what
your Shih Tzu needs while he’s away from home.
Finding a good boarding kennel
Boarding kennels can be wonderful or not so wonderful. A good
boarding kennel is clean, comfortable, and run by knowledgeable
and well-trained staff who take the dogs out often for walks, play-
time, and attention. You should be able to bring your dog’s regular
food, water bowls, and bed or crate, plus comfort items.
Make sure you take the time to ask the kennel owner or manager
the following questions:
Part III: Caring for Your Chinese Charmer 
210

 What does your insurance and liability cover?
 Do you require dogs to be vaccinated? Do you have other
requirements? Can I be sure the other dogs in this facility
won’t have contagious diseases like kennel cough?
 What’s the cost? Do extra services cost extra?
 What’s the daily schedule like and how will Lola spend her
days and nights?
 Who will care for Lola?
 Can my dog get groomed? If so, what kind and how often?
 Do the dogs spend time on fun training or walking sessions?
Some high-end boarding kennels offer outdoor play sessions in beau-
tiful areas, luxury accommodations, and even spa services for dogs,
from high-end grooming to pet massage and plenty of pampering. Of
course, this kind of place isn’t cheap, but for many pet owners the
extra cost is well worth the extra care and pampering.
The doggy daycare option
Doggy daycare provides social time for dogs when their owners are
gone. Some centers also provide boarding, grooming facilities, and
even training classes. A few places even have Web cams, so you can
see from your computer where your dog is. Many facilities can give
your dog a chance to really blossom and meet new friends. Some
businesses also have dog trainers on staff who can help you with
your questions about your dog’s behavior and who can work with
dogs that may not be entirely comfortable around other dogs at first.
If your dog normally attends a daycare facility during the day, he
may be able to stay on around-the-clock when you travel. Or, friends
and family can take him at night but take him to daycare during the
day. Many doggy daycare facilities are flexible, especially if they
already know you and your dog.
To find a reputable doggy daycare, consider these options:
 Ask your breeder or vet if he can recommend a good daycare.
Many breeders and vets know the local pet community and
have heard who is good and reputable.
 Ask friends and family members for referrals. If your cousin’s
Maltese loves a particular daycare facility, your Shih Tzu may
love it too, especially if she already has friends there.
 Look in the phonebook under pet services or dog daycare.
Ask the daycare for references and check them.
Chapter 14: Traveling (Or Not Traveling) Safely with Your Shih Tzu 211

 Search online for pet care resources. Just type dog daycare
and your city and state in your favorite search engine. Many
cities have multiple options. Get references and check them.
 Consult with your local animal shelter or humane society
for references. These organizations may have a good idea
about which places are the best, and which to avoid.
Before you decide on a facility, visit the facility. When evaluating a
doggy daycare, keep the following in mind:
 Make sure they require an interview with you and your dog.
During this interview share your dog’s health info including
his current vaccination history; you can also talk about your
dog’s personality. If the daycare facility doesn’t care how
healthy your dog is and how he behaves, they don’t care how
healthy or well-behaved the other dogs are either, which can
put your dog at risk for catching a contagious disease or get-
ting into a run-in with a dangerous dog.
 Check to see that the facilities are clean and that the play
areas are spacious. Ask for a tour and see if the place looks
like somewhere you want your Shih Tzu to spend her day.
 Verify that the staff is knowledgeable and that the staff pro-
vides plenty of supervision so small dogs are safe. Do the
small dogs romp around with the Great Danes? Ask about 
how the dogs get along, and how the staff handles any issues.
Many good doggie daycares may have a waiting list, so plan ahead,
and be prepared and have a backup plan.
You can ask the daycare owner or manager the following questions
before deciding to leave Samson, whether overnight or just during
the day. (The list of questions in the previous section is good, too.)
 What do you require before a dog can come here?
 Do the dogs have their own rooms? Do you have a special
area for small dogs?
 How do you supervise dog play? What if the dogs get in a fight?
Do you keep problem dogs in a different area?
Like upscale boarding kennels, many doggy daycare centers offer
high-end pet services from fun training sessions to gourmet dog
treat bakeries and spa services. Come to think of it, your Shih Tzu
may end up having a more relaxing vacation than you!

 Understanding dog language
 Using positive reinforcement for easy training
 Training yourself to train your Shih Tzu
A
Shih Tzu breeder once told me that this breed didn’t need any
training. Although that sounds like a great reason to choose a
Shih Tzu, I must disagree. Not only do all dogs need training, but
also Shih Tzu have some particular tendencies that can be chan-
neled to make your dog an even more well-behaved and easy pet
than Shih Tzu naturally are.
Shih Tzu don’t come pre-programmed with info about your house
rules or preferences. Lola doesn’t know you think the newspaper
makes much more sense as a toilet than the new carpet. Samson
doesn’t know that you don’t think his musical barking serenades
get tiresome. Through training, dogs discover your preferences,
rules for good manners, and much more.
This chapter helps you get inside your dog’s head to understand
what your dog really wants and needs, so you can communicate
better. After all, communication is really what training is all about.
News Flash: Your Shih Tzu Is a Dog
Come here. Get close to the page; I have something to tell you.
Lean a little bit closer. I have a secret. Your Shih Tzu is . . . a dog! I
know, I know, it seems incredible. You thought he was a cute furry
little baby. Take a minute to recover from the news.

Just because a Shih Tzu isn’t a big slobbery tennis-ball chaser 
doesn’t mean he won’t act like a dog — all dogs have certain
doggy traits. They all need housetraining. They can all growl, nip,
and bite if they aren’t trained not to do this or if they feel threat-
ened. They all enjoy living with humans better if they understand
who’s in charge, what the rules are, and the meaning of a few basic
cues like Come, Stay, Sit, and Drop it. (For info on teaching cues, see
Chapter 17.)
For the most part, Shih Tzu like to do what you say. It’s part of their
companion-dog nature. All you have to do is make it clear what you
want, and your Shih Tzu is likely to go for it. The trick, then, is to
discover how to communicate what you want. After you master the
fine art of communicating with a Shih Tzu, teaching basic house
rules, good manners, and even tricks will be easy.
How to speak Shih Tzu
The most important point to remember when you’re trying to speak
Shih Tzu is that because the Shih Tzu is a companion animal, he
reflects the behavior, stress level, and personality of the household.
In other words, speaking Shih Tzu has a lot to do with tuning in to
your own behavior. What is your dog reflecting? What is your dog
trying to tell you? Are you stressed? If so, your Shih Tzu will be,
too. Are you angry? Your Shih Tzu is probably feeling fearful. Are
you calm and relaxed? So is your Shih Tzu.
Take a look at yourself, and then consider these strategies, for a
better-behaved dog:
 Chill out and calm down. Shih Tzu pick up on your stress 
and bad mood, and Shih Tzu respond best when your emo-
tions aren’t all revved up.
 Enjoy your dog. Spend time every day appreciating your dog’s
best qualities. Let him make you laugh. Notice his beautiful
coat. Appreciate how attentive and tuned-in he is to you. Your
Shih Tzu will pick up this kind of attention. It makes him feel
more secure and confident.
 Share your life. If you talk to your dog, take him with you
when you leave the house (when possible), and let him be
a part of the things you do every day, you’ll both discover
more about each other and understand each other better.
Remember, your dog is a companion dog. Let him be your
companion.

How to show (or not show) your 
dog what behavior is okay
Shih Tzu also need guidance from you. One of the best ways to
train your dog is simply to give her feedback about what she does.
Remember to:
 Reward the behavior you like. Shih Tzu understand rewards,
and rewards motivate them.
 Ignore the behavior you don’t like. Shih Tzu want your atten-
tion more than anything else, so ignoring bad behavior sends a
powerful message to your dog that if he wants you, he’ll have
to do something differently.
 Don’t reward the behavior you don’t like by yelling, picking
up your dog, or even looking at your dog when she does
something you don’t like. These actions reinforce the behavior
because she’s managed to score your attention.
 Never yell at or hit your Shih Tzu. Shih Tzu are sensitive
dogs, and rough, loud, or physical behaviors can damage 
your relationship for good, not to mention injure the dog.
 Remember that your Shih Tzu is a dog. Dogs bark, chase
things, run around, scratch, whine, and defend themselves
with their teeth. You can’t erase these instincts out of your
Shih Tzu, but you can channel them appropriately . . . with
training. (Check out Chapter 17 for specific training pointers.)
 Don’t underestimate the power of your own charisma. Your
Shih Tzu wants to be with you more than anything else. You’re
your dog’s be-all and end-all — that’s key to communicating
with and training your Shih Tzu.
The Magic of Rewards: Keeping
That Paycheck Coming
Positive reinforcement works like a charm with small dogs, as well
as other breeds — and even with cats, rabbits, rats, dolphins, and
children. And spouses! Really, who doesn’t like rewards? But notice
that this definition doesn’t say anything about punishing naughty
behavior. That’s because punishment isn’t a part of positive rein-
forcement training. In fact, this kind of training is completely
opposed to punishment. The most punishment your dog gets with
this method of training is to be ignored — no yelling, no hitting,
just the withdrawal of your attention.
Chapter 15: Building a Partnership: Rules to Train By 217

For example, say every time you come home, your Shih Tzu jumps
up on you, snagging your pantyhose or yipping desperately for
your attention. What do you do? You ignore her. In fact, you can
even turn your back on her. This isn’t what she wants! Because
your Shih Tzu wants your attention and her jumping isn’t working,
she’ll try something else. When she stops jumping and sits to figure
out what may work, you turn around and kneel down. You pet her
and praise her. Your smart little Shih Tzu quickly can figure out
that sitting quietly gets your attention, but jumping doesn’t.
The problem is that most people reward the behavior they don’t
like by giving the dog a lot of attention. Do you pick up your dog
when she jumps to get her to stop? Do you coo and pet her to calm
her down? If so, you’re rewarding the bad behavior. Ignore her until
she sits quietly and looks at you attentively. Then pour on the praise,
the cooing, and the picking up. It sounds simple, doesn’t it? You
have to retrain yourself and pay attention to what you’re doing in
order to master this training method.
The positive reinforcement training method is particularly important
for small dogs like Shih Tzu. Small breeds can be seriously injured or
at least emotionally traumatized with more traditional training meth-
ods like choke chains and shock collars. Shih Tzu don’t need these
training tools. In fact, I argue most dogs don’t need them, but Shih
Tzu in particular don’t benefit from punishment.
In this section, you find a breakdown of the basic concepts of posi-
tive reinforcement — how to use it by rewarding the good, ignoring
the bad, and understanding why punishment doesn’t work. Use these
concepts when you start training the cues in Chapter 17, and you
can see how easy training a Shih Tzu can be.
Rewarding good behavior
Rewarding good behavior sounds easy, but you can easily forget to
do it because people tend to notice their dogs more when the dog’s
misbehaving.
To effectively reward good behavior, keep the following pointers in
mind:
 Pay attention. Every time your dog does something good —
sitting nicely instead of jumping up on someone’s legs, being
quiet, coming when called, and doing what you say — you
have to remember to reward: “Good dog!” “Here’s a treat!”
“Here’s your favorite toy.” “You can sit on my lap now!”
 Keep changing the reward. If your Shih Tzu never knows
what reward he’ll get, he’ll stay a lot more focused on you. If
Part IV: Training Your Shih Tzu 
218

he knows the reward is always a piece of dog cookie, he may
sometimes decide that the fun of digging in your garden or
jumping on a visitor is better than the reward of the dog
cookie. But if he knows that sometimes it’s a cookie, some-
times it’s a game of fetch, sometimes it’s a bit of chicken,
sometimes it’s some focused cuddle time, then you’ll be much
more interesting than anything naughty he might want to do.
 Don’t reward bad things. Your dog can interpret you picking
him up, petting him, or even yelling at him as rewards. You’re
paying attention to him. Try to never reward any behavior you
don’t like. (See the next section for more info.)
 Never miss an opportunity for reinforcement. Even if your
Shih Tzu is just sitting quietly, praise her. When she does any-
thing you ask, praise her. When she stops herself from doing
something she shouldn’t (like eyeing your shoe, then choosing
her chew toy instead), praise her. You can’t overdo constantly
rewarding and reinforcing good behavior.
 Mark good behavior with a particular word that you’ve
taught your Shih Tzu. Every time your dog does something
good, use the same word, like “good!” or “yes!” before reward-
ing with praise or a treat. Your dog learns quickly that this
word means something good’s coming, and the word itself will
become an easy-to-use reward.
Not rewarding bad behavior
Being a good dog trainer requires not only vigilant awareness of
rewarding the positive, but a vigilant awareness of not accidentally
rewarding the negative. Rewarding bad behavior without intending
to is easy! For example, say you’ve been really busy all day, doing
whatever it is you do, and you’ve ignored the dog. To amuse himself
he may look out the window and start barking at things wandering
into his line of sight. That yip-yip-yipping is driving you crazy, and
finally, you explode and yell at him: “Bad dog! Stop barking! Shhhh!!!!!”
Guess what? You just gave your Shih Tzu the attention he’s been
craving all day. Sure, it wasn’t a treat or praise or even necessarily
pleasant attention, but to a dog, negative attention is better than
no attention. Plus, your dog probably thinks you’re just barking
right along with him, so in a way, he may feel even more justified
in making all that noise.
Your family also plays a significant role. For example, say your Shih
Tzu always hangs out under the dining room table during dinner,
looking for tidbits the kids drop. Did you know that your second
grader is feeding your dog under the table the meat he doesn’t want
Chapter 15: Building a Partnership: Rules to Train By 219

to eat? Did you know your boyfriend is a really sloppy eater and
always drops food on the floor? Maybe that’s why your Shih Tzu
keeps pawing people’s legs or jumping on laps or otherwise pester-
ing you at the table.
How do you stop the madness? You have to stop rewarding the
dog, and all those scraps of food have been serving as a pretty
powerful reward. That means you have to remove the dog from
the room during dinner, or tell him to Sit — not under the table
but next to you where you can see him — and have him stay in the
Sit until you’re done eating. If he gets up, out of the room he goes.
Teaching yourself and your family not to reward bad behavior takes
constant vigilance, especially until you get into better habits. Are
the kids sticking their fingers in your puppy’s mouth and shrieking
when he bites them? Reward. Is your wife cooing and petting the
dog when he growls at people who approach his human? Reward.
Do the neighbor kids come to the fence and tease the dog until he
barks? Reward. If you can just stop rewarding the bad behavior
(ignore it, or remove the dog from the situation without a word),
you have made a lot of progress communicating to your dog. Then
you can focus all your energy on teaching your dog good behavior
(see Chapter 17 for more info on teaching cues like Sit and Stay).
Dogs sometimes escalate bad behaviors at first, hoping that even
more extreme behavior will finally win your loving glance, the sound
of your voice, or a treat, but if that doesn’t work, eventually your
dog will give up that behavior and try something else. When he hits
on the right thing (being quiet, sitting instead of jumping, waiting
for you to finish eating, lying down when you ask, or whatever you
are going for), bingo! Now you really can reward! That lesson will
stick in your dog’s head. You just have to teach it.
Why punishment doesn’t work
Grasping the power of positive reinforcement can be difficult at
first, especially if you grew up in the old ways of training: scolding,
swatting with a newspaper, jerking on a chain, nose flicking, or rub-
bing the puppy’s nose in a housetraining accident. If the dog is good,
rewarding make sense. But what do you do when he’s bad?
The main problem with punishment is that although it may teach
your dog what you don’t like, it doesn’t tell your dog what you do
like. Punishment scares a dog, especially a small dog. And unless
it occurs within seconds of bad behavior, the dog isn’t capable of
linking the punishment to the behavior you don’t like. If he peed on
the carpet two hours ago and suddenly you start yelling, he doesn’t
know why you’re yelling. He only knows that you’re loud and scary.
Part IV: Training Your Shih Tzu 
220

And even if he does know you don’t like him to pee on the carpet
because you started yelling the second he started peeing, you have
taught him what you don’t like, but not what you do like. Your dog
wants to know what to do. This makes more sense to an animal
than the negative concept of what not to do, which is more com-
plex. Positive reinforcement tells your dog exactly what you want,
so he can repeat that behavior by choice. Positive reinforcement is
active and makes sense to a dog. Dogs understand: Do this. Doing
so results in good things.
Another problem with punishment is that it’s more likely to make
too strong an impression on the sensitive Shih Tzu. He may start
to fear you and hide from you rather than love and trust you.
Eventually, he may stop responding to you at all, and your loving
relationship will be destroyed.
Figuring out how to stop punishing and start rewarding does take
some time and a new mindset for many dog owners. Even so, I’m
confident you can do it by discovering how to be a good dog trainer.
(Check out the next section and Chapter 17 for helpful pointers.)
Who’s Training Who?
Humans are easy to train. In fact, your Shih Tzu may have you
trained to provide treats on command, supply a warm lap on cue,
and shower him with affection. Some humans are so easy to con-
trol when it comes to a cute little dog! So you may just want to look
at your own situation and ask yourself: Just who’s training who?
Nothing’s wrong with a little mutual training. You and your Shih Tzu
both get rewarded by spending time together, cuddling, petting, and
playing. Studies show that petting a dog actually lowers blood pres-
sure and levels of stress hormones in humans, and if I had to guess,
I’d wager that petting is probably healthy for dogs, too.
But at some point, if you want your Shih Tzu to do more than just
sit on your lap looking cute, you need to be in control. You don’t
have to quit your job and take up dog training as a profession to
be a good dog trainer. Being a good dog trainer isn’t difficult, but it
does require some practice — every single day. This section helps
you remember the important concepts.
Being in charge
Dogs feel more secure with a benevolent leader, so if you can step
up to the throne and wear the crown, your Shih Tzu will worship
you accordingly.
Chapter 15: Building a Partnership: Rules to Train By 221

How can you be in charge? Being in charge doesn’t mean you have
to be stern or strict or even a disciplinarian. But you do have to
make the rules and stick to them, every single time. Your Shih Tzu
wants to know the rules and what to do to make you happy enough
to give her praise, treats, and loving attention.
If you don’t want your Shih Tzu get on the antique sofa, never let
her get up there, not even once. If you don’t want your Shih Tzu to
jump on people, never reward her for it. If you want her to use the
newspaper for her bathroom, make sure she never has an accident
anywhere else (for more on housetraining, see Chapter 16). Being
in charge is all about consistency. If you sometimes bend the rules,
your Shih Tzu will quickly figure out how to manipulate you so you
bend them whenever she wants you to bend them.
Making training a daily habit
If you make training sessions a daily habit, as important as feeding
your dog, taking him outside, and giving him water, you build an
even stronger and closer bond between you and your dog. Plus,
your communication will improve and you’ll get to know each
other better. And that’s rewarding for both of you. Even if you
don’t have a lot of time to devote to training on some days, you
can still find just five or ten minutes once or twice a day to work
on different cues.
Another important part of daily training is grooming (for more on
grooming, see Chapter 10). A well-trained Shih Tzu knows how to
sit nicely for grooming, so when grooming becomes a non-negotiable
part of the daily routine, it also becomes a part of training. Whatever
your Shih Tzu is used to doing every day, she will learn to do well.
But even if you and your Shih Tzu just prefer to stay home and
hang out, you can have great fun teaching simple cues like Sit,
Down, Stay, and Come, not to mention cute tricks to show your
friends and family. Shih Tzu love to spend time with you this way,
especially if it’s fun and (you guessed it) rewarding!

s that a new spot on the carpet? Housetraining any Toy breed,
including as a Shih Tzu, can be a real challenge and can try the
patience of even the most consistent and fastidious pet owner. Are
you destined to endure carpet stains and tiny piles forever?
Your Shih Tzu is a smart little dog, and he has no reason to think
that he should not use your carpet as a bathroom, unless you tell
him otherwise — and that doesn’t mean yelling and carrying on
whenever your Shih Tzu has an accident.
In this chapter, you discover how to teach your Shih Tzu when and
where to relieve himself, how to quit sabotaging your dog’s house-
training success (yes, you aid in the mistakes!), and how to make
housetraining truly rewarding for your Shih Tzu. (You can also check
out Housetraining For Dummies by Susan McCullough [Wiley] for
more extensive info.)
Housetraining from A to Z
A lot of people claim to have the secret to housetraining, but I have
a secret for you: All the variations really come down to a few basic
methods, and two of them work really well, especially when used

together. The two are taking the dog out on a regular schedule, and
using a comfy crate when you can’t supervise and watch for those
signs that your dog needs to pee or poop.
In this chapter, I explain all the tools that can help make house-
training a snap, from crates and leashes to puppy pads and plain
old newspaper. I also tell you how to set up a housetraining routine
and take your dog out on a schedule so he never, ever has to have
an accident (he may have one sometimes anyway, because you
forgot or weren’t watching — but everyone makes mistakes!).
Whatever method you use, the most important thing to remember
when housetraining a Shih Tzu is consistency! Set up a system,
make potty time a routine, and your dog will quickly figure out
what you expect. This section looks at the tools you can use to
housetrain, gives you a pep talk so you don’t get discouraged, and
helps you notice warning signs that mean your dog is ready to go.
Using tools: Crates, leashes, 
puppy pads, and more
Housetraining is a lot easier if you use some very effective tools.
Take advantage of the following items, and you can save a lot of
time, effort, and mess:
 Crate: A crate keeps your pup supervised when you can’t
watch him for signs he has to go potty. For more on using the
crate for housetraining, see the section later in this chapter
called “The Amazing Crate.”
 Leash: If you always keep your dog on a leash until he poops
or pees, he’ll figure out how what he needs to do so he can
play. Using a leash takes more time initially, and it means you
have to go to the potty spot with your dog (outside or inside,
rain or shine), but in the long run, this extra effort pays off in
a big way. Your dog will be housetrained more quickly and will
understand what you want.
 Pee pads and paper: Dogs tend to pee where they peed before.
They can smell it. If your dog goes on the paper just once, you
can use a tiny scrap of that paper on the fresh paper to remind
him of the right spot. Puppy pee pads also come pre-scented
with a pee-like aroma to encourage your dog to go in that spot.
Find them in the pet store.
 Litter boxes: Cats use ’em, but dogs can, too. Just don’t use
cat litter — use special litter made for dogs, which doesn’t
get as messy and doesn’t stick to your Shih Tzu’s coat. You
can also line a litter box with newspaper (and/or puppy pads).
Part IV: Training Your Shih Tzu 
224

Check out the sidebar “Litter boxes aren’t just for cats” later
in this chapter.
Staying upbeat
Another important aspect of housetraining is to stay positive. If
you find a mess, especially one he made more than a few minutes
ago, don’t yell or get mad at him. He won’t know why, and in fact,
he’ll probably associate your anger and his fear with the presence
of a housetraining mishap, but not with the action of peeing or
pooping on the floor. He’s more likely to think that next time he’d
better just pee or poop where you won’t see it.
Whenever Samson does the right thing, such as pees in the right
place or asks to go out — praise him with happy appreciation. If he
has an accident, whisk him outside without saying a word, and then
praise him if he finishes in the right place. If you miss the accident
and find it, clean it silently, without looking at him, without a word.
He won’t like being ignored, but he won’t get the wrong message.
If you stay relaxed and positive throughout the housetraining
process (challenging as this can be), Samson will see the new 
routine as just one more part of his fun and reassuring life. If 
you’re upset whenever Samson has an accident, he’ll get upset,
too — but not because he thinks he somehow failed. He’ll be upset
because he’s a companion dog and very tuned-in to your emotions.
He worries about you. “What’s wrong with her? Should I be afraid?”
Sure, you’re frustrated when you find a mess, but be frustrated
with yourself, not with Samson. He’s doing the best he can with the
info he has. Be patient and consistent, and you both can succeed.
Watching for warning signs
Dogs don’t usually let their bladders fly all over your carpet; they
give signs beforehand. You just need to know how to read them. So
even when it isn’t time for that scheduled pit stop (everyone needs
to go to the bathroom out of their normal schedule once in awhile),
you must keep an eye on your Shih Tzu, especially when she’s a
puppy. Doing so is especially important when you’re first house-
training your dog, no matter what her age. After you figure out her
cues, you can pick up on them much more quickly.
Look for these signs that indicate she may need to go potty:
 Sniffing and circling: Many dogs sniff the ground and walk in
small circles before they actually go.
Chapter 16: Housetraining Your Shih Tzu: Oops, She Did It Again 225

 Dancing around: No, your Shih Tzu doesn’t don a little skirt
and start doing the cha-cha or hop from one foot to the other
whimpering. Rather, dogs generally flit around and squirm and
go to the door and then come back to see if you’ve noticed yet.
 Whining: If you had to go to the bathroom and you couldn’t
open the bathroom door and nobody was helping you, and no
one was paying attention to let you go, you’d whine and whim-
per too. The whine may not be obvious, but if you hear some
noises coming from your dog, check it out.
 Staring: Some dogs just stare at you. After you figure out the
stare, you’ll know in a flash that your dog needs to go out.
 Standing by the door: Many dogs stand at attention at the door
when they need to go out. They don’t make any noise, so if you
haven’t seen your dog in awhile, go check by the door.
If you see any of the preceding signs, immediately whisk your pup
to the appropriate spot. When your dog starts to squat or lift a leg,
the event is imminent! After she goes in the right spot, praise her.
Sticking to a Schedule
One of the most effective housetraining methods is schedule training.
No matter where you train your Shih Tzu to go potty or what other
methods you use, housetraining on a schedule makes everything
easier. Typically, puppies need to go every three to four hours during
the night and both puppies and older dogs need to potty at other
predictable times during the day, so training on a schedule takes
advantage of this biological reality.
The first thing to know is that most dogs need a bathroom break:
 When they first wake up
 After eating
 After a vigorous play or exercise session
 After a nap
 Right before bed
So, set up a schedule. If you aren’t available for all these potty
breaks, find someone else who can be (another family member, a
pet sitter, a dog walker, or a friend).
As an example, your housetraining schedule may go something like
this (I assume you’re feeding your Shih Tzu three times per day,
but if you feed your dog on a different schedule, just remember to
Part IV: Training Your Shih Tzu 
226

take her out 15 to 30 minutes after a meal — for more on feeding
schedules, see Chapter 9):
1. Take Lola to her potty spot as soon as she wakes up in the
morning.
Is Lola an early riser? If so, take her to her pee spot, and
then go back to bed — she’ll probably be glad to join you.
2. Take her to her potty spot again about 15 minutes after
she’s eaten her first meal, snack, or treat of the day.
If she doesn’t eat in the morning, take her about three
hours after her first potty break.
3. Go again midmorning, around the time when most
people would have a coffee or bathroom break.
4. Take her to the spot about 15 minutes after any midday
meal, snack, or treat.
5. Take her to potty in the mid-afternoon, after she’s had a
nap.
6. Head for a potty break 15 minutes after she’s eaten
dinner.
7. Take her after any particularly frisky play or training 
sessions.
8. Make one last trip to the potty spot just before bed.
9. If Lola is still a puppy, plan to wake up once or twice
during the night when she wakes up and starts stirring
and whining.
In general, shoot for taking your dog to her potty spot about
every three to four hours during the day (every one to two hours
for puppies under 12 weeks and for the first couple of weeks of
housetraining, just to get the concept firmly in place). Even more
importantly than how often you take her is that you take her at
the same time every day. This is the heart of schedule training, so
make your schedule in whatever way works for you and your dog,
and then stick to it like glue.
Hold on! Do you think I’m living in a dream world? You think I’m
nuts right now, don’t you? You’re thinking there’s no way you have
that kind of time. Yes, taking your Shih Tzu outside or over to the
newspapers every two hours and standing there waiting for him to
decide to pee isn’t convenient. You have a life! You’re busy! Time is
money! But this is the very reason why most Toy dogs take so long
to get housetrained and why some of them never get fully house-
trained. Those tiny bladders need to empty themselves often. Who
Chapter 16: Housetraining Your Shih Tzu: Oops, She Did It Again 227

has the time to supervise and direct each urination? Doing so is
important, and you must make time for it, or enlist others to help.
Your level of consistency is up to you. As long as you realize that
housetraining takes longer when you mess up, and that housetrain-
ing mistakes are usually your mistakes, you won’t feel so compelled
to yell at Lola because you forgot to take her out or didn’t notice
that she was circling and sniffing or staring mournfully at the back
door (see the section “Watching for warning signs” earlier in this
chapter). You’re in charge, so be a good manager. The more consis-
tent you are, the faster your dog will be housetrained, and you’ll
completely forget how much time it took.
The Amazing Crate
To housetrain your Shih Tzu quickly and effectively, you have to 
do two things: Make sure he goes to the bathroom in the right
place, and make sure he doesn’t go to the bathroom in the wrong
place. Sounds simple, but unless you can watch your Shih Tzu
every second of the day, how will you always prevent him from
doing the right thing? By using a crate.
Even the most disciplined pet owners can’t watch a dog every
minute of every day, and despite your best efforts at maintaining a
perfect routine, sometimes your Shih Tzu will relieve himself when
you aren’t looking or don’t expect it, so most trainers recommend
crate training, especially for Toy breeds.
The crate is a tool that helps with housetraining when coordinated
with a regular schedule of meals and potty breaks. (Refer to the pre-
vious section for how to specifically housetrain your dog.) People
sometimes get confused about what a crate is supposed to teach
a dog. The answer: Nothing! The purpose of crate training isn’t to
teach your Shih Tzu anything. It just keeps him from having an
accident until you’re ready to take him to his potty spot again.
Here’s how to use it:
1. Whenever you can’t play with or directly watch your
Shih Tzu, put him in his crate for a rest.
Most dogs won’t have an accident in the crate. See the side-
bar, “All about natural instinct: Why crate training works,”
for the reasons why.
2. Fill the crate with soft bedding and the occasional treat, to
help make your dog feel comfortable and happy in there.
Remember that dogs like their dens and you want this to
feel comfortable there.
Part IV: Training Your Shih Tzu 
228

3. Whenever you take your dog out of the crate, take him
directly to his potty spot.
Most dogs need to go after a nap, and most dogs nap when in
their crates. When your dog isn’t in the crate, you must stick
to the schedule and watch him! The crate only works as well
as your efforts when the dog isn’t in the crate. The crate can’t
help you remember to stick to the schedule or let the dog out
when he has to go. You still have to do your part.
And that’s it! It doesn’t take long for most dogs to figure out
where their own personal bathrooms are located, and how
to use them, as long as they don’t keep making mistakes in
the wrong places.
Crates can backfire into abuse. Don’t just put your puppy in a crate
and expect him to hold his bladder for six or eight hours at a time —
his bladder is too small. He’ll inevitably have an accident in the crate,
feel miserable, and hate the crate. Then he won’t want to go in there,
and he’ll be much harder to train. Plus, what kind of life is that for
a little companion dog to be locked up in a crate for hours on end?
Your Shih Tzu certainly doesn’t want to spend his day that way.
And after your puppy has made a mistake and soiled his crate,
he’s confined to the mess until you clean him and the crate.
Paper or Litter Box Training
If you decide that your Shih Tzu’s potty spot should be indoors
rather than out, you can paper or litter box train him pretty easily.
Chapter 16: Housetraining Your Shih Tzu: Oops, She Did It Again 229
All about natural instinct: 
Why crate training works
Crate training works because it takes advantage of a natural instinct dogs have:
Den animals understand instinctually that it would be unsanitary, not to mention
uncomfortable, to use their own beds as toilets, so den animals don’t normally
relieve themselves in their dens, unless they’re sick or can’t get out. In most cases,
dogs will work hard to hold it until they can get away from the place they sleep.
If your dog has accidents in his crate, even when he hasn’t been in there very long,
and you never leave him in the crate for more than three or four hours at a time, see
your vet to rule out a health problem such as a urinary tract infection. If your dog is
healthy, talk to a trainer or behaviorist about other possible security or anxiety issues
(for more info on finding a behaviorist, see Chapter 11). Never scold the dog for soil-
ing his crate — if he does, it wasn’t on purpose, and he has a more serious problem.

(Check out the nearby sidebar, “Litter boxes aren’t just for cats”
for more info.) Just follow all the same instructions in this chapter
(training on a schedule, using the leash, using the crate), but when
it’s time to take your dog to her potty spot, take her to her newspa-
per or litter box, on the leash, and wait for her to do her business
(see Figure 16-1). (Check out the “Sticking to a Schedule” section
for specific housetraining steps.) When she does, praise her.
Figure 16-1: You can use newspaper to housetrain your puppy.
The following tips can help you with paper or litter training:
 Use pre-scented puppy pee pads because dogs tend to pee
where they smell pee. (Check out the section, “Using tools:
Crates, leashes, puppy pads, and more” earlier in this chapter
for more about pads.)
 If your dog has a favorite pee spot, move the paper to that
spot. If the spot isn’t a good place, wait until your dog pees
there reliably on the paper, then move the paper, one or two
feet each day, to the place you want your dog to go. He should
follow the potty spot.
 Always clean up any pee and poop in the house immedi-
ately and thoroughly. You don’t want you dog to smell her
previous accident and continue to use the wrong spot.
 Never forget to praise your dog for going in the right spot,
every time. Good dog!
Paper or litter training is very convenient if you can’t take your dog
outside easily or conveniently, and if your dog is trained to use a
certain area of the house for her potty, you don’t have to worry
about coming home to let her out on time (although you still need
to come home to spend time with her!).
Part IV: Training Your Shih Tzu 
230

Some people paper or litter box train their dogs easily without using
a crate, but you can still use the crate (see the preceding section)
if you’re paper or litter box training your Shih Tzu, especially in
the beginning when you’re still teaching her where to go. Let her
rest in the crate when you aren’t watching her, and then take her out
and straight to her paper or litter box, on a leash, for her to “go.”
Dealing with Setbacks
Sometimes, a perfectly housetrained Shih Tzu suddenly begins
having accidents in the house. You may catch little Samson taking
a piddle right there in your living room for no apparent reason. But
he was housetrained! What gives?
This section helps you deal with setbacks in a relaxed and calm
manner. This section also helps you measure whether your dog is
really trained, especially if he’s gone a few days without a setback.
Chapter 16: Housetraining Your Shih Tzu: Oops, She Did It Again 231
Litter boxes aren’t just for cats
Some people have great success litter box training their Shih Tzu. Litter box train-
ing is especially useful if you live in high-rise apartments or condominiums and can’t
quickly get outside or if you’re housebound. Litter boxes make clean-up easy, and
although you can use a litter box made for a cat, some companies also make litter
boxes for dogs.
However, you don’t use the same litter as you would use for a cat. You can buy spe-
cial dog litter that’s designed to absorb odor and wetness (like kitty litter), or you
can also just line the litter box with newspaper. If your Shih Tzu has a long coat,
newspaper works better than litter because the litter can get caught in the hair. You
may end up spending extra grooming time just combing out the litter!
If you can’t find dog litter boxes or litter in your local pet store, you can purchase
them online. Here are some good sources:

Why your dog had an accident
Everybody makes mistakes, but if your Shih Tzu seems to forget
he’s housetrained and starts having accidents in the house every
day for more than a few days, see your vet first. Your dog may have
a medical problem, such as a kidney infection or diabetes.
If your vet rules out a medical problem, consider these other reasons
why your Shih Tzu’s housetraining has seemingly disappeared:
 Your Shih Tzu is stressed. Changes in routine can stress your
dog. The birth of a child, a divorce, a death in the family, a new
home or job, and even the furniture rearranged can stress dogs,
causing a housetraining setback (the same as with small chil-
dren and potty training). Shih Tzu tend to take on the house-
hold’s personality, so look at what’s going on at home.
 You’re stressed. Think about how things are going in the
family. Are you particularly stressed out about work? Are 
certain family members depressed or arguing a lot? Shih
Tzu tune in to people in their family. If someone is stressed,
your Shih Tzu is probably stressing, too.
The best way to address this problem is to spend quiet,
together-time with your Shih Tzu, and also make sure
you’re keeping a regular schedule of meals and potty breaks.
Remember, routines reassure dogs and help alleviate stress.
Also, take measure to reduce your stress. (Routines and clear-
ing your schedule can help you — so can petting a Shih Tzu!)
 You weren’t paying attention. Did you miss the signs that your
dog had to go, or were you too busy sitting at the computer
that you forgot to let her out? Check for warning signs (refer to
“Watch for warning signs” earlier in this chapter). You may have
been really busy lately, and the problem is your neglect.
 Your dog smelled the scent of an accident. One accident can
lead to more, especially if you don’t see it and never clean it
up. Always clean any housetraining errors thoroughly with an
enzyme cleaner that removes the odor. When a dog smells a
previous pee spot, she’s more likely to pee there again.
 Your dog has a behavior problem. Sometimes dogs develop
behavior problems like anxiety that need professional help.
Housetraining problems related to behavior happen often in
rescued dogs who may have endured abuse or neglect in the
past. Consult an animal behaviorist for an evaluation if you
can’t resolve housetraining issues. For more on finding an
animal behaviorist, see Chapter 11.
Whether the problem is physical or emotional, you obviously need
to do something about it. No matter how old your Shih Tzu is, you
Part IV: Training Your Shih Tzu 
232

can start back at square one, cheerfully and calmly, housetraining
as if your Shih Tzu has never had these lessons before. (Check out
“Housetraining from A to Z,” earlier in this chapter.)
Catching your dog in the act
If you catch your dog in a piddle, how you respond can make all
the difference. If you see your Shih Tzu doing her business, follow
these steps:
1. Clap your hands once or say, “No.”
Don’t shout. You just want to get the dog’s attention. You
don’t want to scold or give a lecture; you just want to
remind him of the proper spot.
2. Pick him up and take him to the designated bathroom area.
When he goes, praise him.
3. Make sure to thoroughly clean the mess up off the floor.
Old stains can lead to new accidents. Check out “Cleaning
Up after Your Shih Tzu” later in this chapter for ways to
clean properly.
When your dog forgets his housetraining, you feel frustrated, but
don’t take it out on your dog. He isn’t peeing and pooping in the
house to get back at you (even if it seems like that). Your Shih
Tzu really is having a problem, and even if you don’t know exactly
what the problem is, your Shih Tzu needs your help, your gentle
reminders, and your leadership — not your wrath.
Determining if your dog is trained
New pet owners commonly assume that their dogs are house-
trained before they really are. If your puppy hasn’t had any acci-
dents in the house for two weeks, congratulate yourself! You haven’t
messed up. But that doesn’t mean your puppy is housetrained.
Toy dogs can’t be reliably housetrained before 16 to 20 weeks of
age, and many of them take even longer (especially if the schedule
and supervision aren’t always consistent). Stick to the schedule,
even after you think she understands. And don’t forget to keep
rewarding her for doing her business.
By the time your puppy is 6 months old, you’ll probably be able to
take her outside without the leash, or even let her outside by her-
self. If she’s paper trained, she’ll probably begin to go to the paper
on her own when she needs to go. She’ll be used to the routine now.
Chapter 16: Housetraining Your Shih Tzu: Oops, She Did It Again 233

Housetraining an Older Dog
Adopting an older Shih Tzu comes with many joys, one of which is
that older dogs are usually housetrained. However, sometimes a res-
cued Shih Tzu never really grasped housetraining because no one
ever communicated the concept correctly. In other cases, a formerly
housetrained Shih Tzu has endured so much stress from losing his
home and family that his housetraining may have lapsed, or he may
not be sure what the new rules are in this new situation with you.
The best way to housetrain an older Shih Tzu is to do exactly the
same thing you would housetrain a puppy. (Check out “Sticking to
a Schedule” earlier in this chapter for tips.) When you bring a Shih
Tzu into a new home, start a new housetraining schedule right away.
Your dog will more readily accept any new routines you set up.
Problems are more likely to arise when you bring home an older
Shih Tzu and wait to start the routine, hoping to let her get settled.
She wants to know what’s what right off the bat, so don’t delay. If
your older Shih Tzu has trouble understanding, just proceed with
housetraining as if she were a puppy. You can teach an old dog
housetraining, but remember to be patient, consistent, and gentle.
Cleaning Up after Your Shih Tzu
Accidents happen. Sometimes, you forget to take the dog outside.
Sometimes you just can’t bear to get up in the morning when your
Shih Tzu does. Or you got delayed coming home and Samson left
you a little present on your rug. Lucky for you, your Shih Tzu is tiny
and leaves tiny messes. Not to worry. This section explains how to
remove the mess and odor and which cleaning products to use.
When your Shih Tzu has an accident, you must clean it thoroughly
so no lingering odor remains, which would signal to your dog that
this spot is okay for future bathroom use. To do so, you need a
product that removes the scent completely. Many odor-removing
products exist; some are more effective than others, so you may
have to experiment to find one that works. Ask your local pet store
employees for a recommendation, or look online. Just search pet
odor remover.
For messes on hard surfaces like tile, wipe and spray with a deodor-
izing cleaner. For messes on wood, you can buy special products
that penetrate the grain. For messes on carpet or fabric, get a prod-
uct that penetrates down through all the layers. Look for a product
that removes both the odor and the stain.

Mastering the Cues: Sit, Stay,
Come, and Others
In This Chapter
 Finding the training method that works for you and your dog
 Teaching the basic cues
 Training for tricks, competitions, titles, and therapy work
I
magine Lola standing wide-eyed in front of you. “Sit,” you say.
Lola blinks, innocently. “Sit,” you repeat. Lola wags her tail, as
if to ask whether you might not pick her up now. “Sit!” you say yet
again, a hint of irritability creeping into your voice. Lola turns around
and walks away. Clearly, she isn’t going to get what she wants from
you right now, so she may as well leave you and your strange, mys-
terious words.
You can’t really expect your Shih Tzu to understand the meaning 
of cues like Sit and Down and Stay without some coaching. But
your Shih Tzu is smart and she’ll pick up the cue quickly, if you
communicate the right info to her. This chapter shows you how.
Choosing Your Training Methods
You can train a dog in many different ways. Different dog training
instructors teach different methods, and many of them work just
fine. But some methods work better for teaching certain cues, while
other methods work better for other things. The next few sections
fill you in on some of the more popular training methods, how they
work, and what they work best for. Consider this your Shih Tzu
training methods smorgasbord.

Luring and rewarding
This classic and easy training method really is simple. Using a treat
or a toy, you lure your dog into the position you want while saying
“Sit” or “Down.” When the dog is in place, you reward the dog.
Lure-and-reward training is the easiest way to teach cues like Sit
and Down. Dogs follow a treat with their noses, so you just have to
move the treat in a way that coaxes the dog into the right position,
such as holding the treat in front of the dog’s nose, then moving it
slowly up and back so the dog follows the treat with his nose and
automatically sits down. The word “Sit” and the reward seal the
deal, and the position and the word into your dog’s memory. (For
a more detailed lesson on using lure-and-reward training to teach
an actual cue, see the section “Sit,” later in this chapter.)
Clicker training
Clicker training is a popular training technique first used by people
who trained marine mammals like dolphins and killer whales. But
clicker training works for dogs, too. Clicker training uses a small
plastic device, called a clicker, to precisely mark a desirable behav-
ior. The clicker has a button and when you press it, it makes a click-
ing sound.
Using a clicker
Incorporating a clicker into your dog’s training isn’t too difficult. In
fact, follow these steps and click away.
1. Load or charge the clicker by clicking it and then giving
the dog a treat.
Do this step a few times, several times a day. Dogs catch on
quickly and soon understand that a click means a treat.
2. Carry the clicker with you and use it often.
Don’t just reserve the clicker for training sessions. Make
clicking a part of everyday life.
3. Every time your dog does something good, click the
clicker at the exact moment the dog is doing the behav-
ior, and then give the dog a treat.
A clicker can mark a behavior faster than a word and 
definitely faster than the clumsy ritual of giving a treat. 
Sit-click! The click means the reward is coming, and your
dog knows it.
Part IV: Training Your Shih Tzu 
236

To mark small behaviors as part of training for complex work, tricks,
or sports, you have to be quick and observant, but if you do it right,
you get immediate results. Click, and then give the dog a treat. This
direct communication tells the dog that the particular behavior is
something you like a lot — something that gets a reward. And the
dog remembers.
Clicker training isn’t for everyone. Not everybody enjoys it or feels
the need for it. Some people like to rely on a well-placed verbal
cue like “Good!” or “Yes!” Sometimes Shih Tzu seem to grasp good
behavior with hardly any training because they’re so good at know-
ing what you want. But if you want to teach more advanced behav-
iors for competitive obedience, agility, or other dog sports or for
training a dog for the show ring, the clicker may just be the key.
Taking a clicker class
If you’re interested in pursuing clicker training, the best way to
understand the basics is to take a class with a clicker training
instructor. The teacher can show you how to use this method to
teach all kinds of cool and complex tricks and useful behaviors, such
as turning a light switch on and off, ringing a bell to ask to go out,
or even doing choreographed dance routines.
Many dog training instructors offer classes on clicker training, so
you can get professional guidance. You can also read more about
clicker training online, and you can purchase a clicker online, too.
Here are my two favorite clicker training sites, from two of the best-
known names in the clicker-training field:
 Karen Pryor’s Clicker Training (www.clickertraining.
com): A former marine mammal trainer, Karen Pryor made
clicker training famous in the dog world, and she’s always
working to expand the field and give dog trainers new
information.
 Gary Wilkes’ Click and Treat (www.clickandtreat.com):
Gary Wilkes gives training seminars and lectures all over the
world. He takes a practical and sensible approach to clicker
training and his site has info about dog care and behavior, in
addition to articles about clicker training.
Catching the good stuff
One of the very easiest ways to train a Shih Tzu to do things you
like is to catch her in the act of doing something useful, interesting,
or good, and mark that behavior, either with the click of a clicker
(for clicker info, see the preceding section) or with praise or some
other reward like a treat or a toy.
Chapter 17: Mastering the Cues: Sit, Stay, Come, and Others 237

For example, say your Shih Tzu has a really cute little yawn. Every
time she yawns, say “Yawn!” or click the clicker, and then reward
her with a treat or a “good dog!” Before long, Lola will figure out
that you like the yawn. Then, she’ll figure out that the word “Yawn”
refers to that thing she does. Pretty soon, she’ll do it for you, on
cue. This takes some patience and a lot of repetition — she won’t
understand what you want the very first time — but with persist-
ence, it works. (And don’t be surprised if she comes up to you and
starts yawning, just to get the reward!)
Shih Tzu do a lot of cute, comical things so if you can catch them
with a reward and mark them with a cue, you may soon have a
whole arsenal of cute behaviors and tricks that your Shih Tzu
came up with all by herself. You can impress your friends with
fun tricks.
Starting with the Basic Cues
Before you start aiming for agility titles or really complicated
tricks, you need to get some basic moves under your belt. Most
complex tricks and even dog sports are based on some elemental
moves that every good dog, whether canine athlete or happy pet,
should know. This section delves into these basics, using the train-
ing method that, in my opinion, is the most appropriate.
Most of these cues work best if you train with treats. If your Shih
Tzu shows no interest in the treat, try the cue again later when
he’s hungry, or make the treat even better — a tiny bit of turkey,
perhaps, or maybe a liver snap. However, many dogs are so eager
for your praise that a warm “Good dog!” is just as good as a treat.
Also remember to keep treats very small so you aren’t adding too
many calories and too much fat to your little dog’s diet. (Check out
Chapter 9 for good snack ideas.)
Sit
Sit (see Figure 17-1) just may be the most useful cue to teach your
Shih Tzu because you can use it to stop most bad behaviors. So
fortunately, teaching the Sit cue is also one of the easiest cues to
teach, especially if you use the lure-and-reward training method
(check out “Luring and rewarding” earlier in this chapter). Just
follow these steps:
1. Put your Shih Tzu in front of you, standing, and touch a
small treat to his nose.
Part IV: Training Your Shih Tzu 
238

2. Slowly raise the treat up and over his head.
As he follows the treat and his head goes up, his rear will
go down.
3. Say “Sit” as he sits.
If your Shih Tzu doesn’t sit, you can gently guide his rear
down with your other hand as you say “Sit.”
4. Praise him and give him the treat.
As soon as your dog sits, praise him with a “Good dog!” and
give him the treat he’s been following so closely.
5. Repeat often — at least a few times each day.
Your Shih Tzu will pick this cue up quickly and frequent
reminders make your little guy feel good about getting this
easy trick right.
Sit can be incredibly useful. If Samson barks when the phone rings
or if Lola jumps up on people when they come to visit, then teach
the Sit cue. You can solve many problems with a simple Sit.
Figure 17-1: You can teach your dog to sit.
Come Here
If your Shih Tzu starts out an open front door toward a busy street,
you can understand the power of the Come Here cue. A dog that
comes back to you reliably when you call her (dog trainers call this
having good recall) is a much safer dog. Recall also comes in handy
in other situations like exiting the dog park when playtime is over
or learning the moves required for competitive obedience.
Chapter 17: Mastering the Cues: Sit, Stay, Come, and Others 239

Teaching this cue is simple. Just follow these steps:
1. Whenever you notice your Shih Tzu coming toward you
(which she’ll want to do often because she likes to be with
you), say “Come Here!” or “Come!”
Or, you can whistle or make some other noise that you
want to represent the Come Here cue.
2. When Lola gets to you, praise her.
Every so often, add a small treat to the praise.
3. Repeat at least several times a day, or even more.
You can’t overdo it. After practicing it for two or three days,
start offering the cue when Lola isn’t coming toward you.
Call her to you, with or without her name: “Lola, come
here!” or “Lola, Come!” or just “Come!” (Or, use the whistle
or other cue you’ve devised.) If she comes, praise her and
give her a treat. If she doesn’t, do nothing.
4. Practice the cue at least several times a day, every day.
The more you do it, the more chances she has to be suc-
cessful. Then, when you really need her to come, you can
be sure she will.
You can also teach Come with the whole family. Try this fun game:
1. Have everyone in your family hide a treat behind his or
her back, and sit in a circle.
2. Put the Shih Tzu in the middle.
Your Shih Tzu may start by going to someone, but don’t
make eye contact. Everyone should have a treat hidden
behind their backs.
3. Take turns calling the dog: “Come Here, Samson!”
Don’t everybody yell at once — one at a time, please. The
person can repeat the phrase and use gestures and an ani-
mated face when calling the dog. Anything to get the dog to
come! When the dog comes to the person who called him,
that person praises the dog and gives him the treat. If he
comes to someone who didn’t call him, that person must
ignore him (no matter how hard that is).
4. Keep going around the circle, only rewarding Samson
when he comes to the person who called.
It only works if the people who aren’t calling truly ignore
the dog, and the person who is calling rewards the dog
when he comes. Shih Tzu are smart — they’ll soon figure
out the score.
Part IV: Training Your Shih Tzu 
240

5. After the dog masters the game, change your voice’s
inflection.
This game teaches your dog to come to anyone, not just
the person who feeds him. It also links the words “Come
Here” to the reward of actually coming, no matter who
says the cue and no matter what inflection they use.
Stay
If your Shih Tzu gets away and crosses a busy street, you’ll be glad
he knows the cue Stay, so he doesn’t see you and come dashing
back in front of traffic. Stay can also be an important safety cue in
many other situations, such as when your dog wants to run up to
greet a larger dog who may be aggressive, when you drop some-
thing on the floor that may be dangerous for your Shih Tzu to eat
(such as medication), and when people come to visit.
Stay is harder for a Shih Tzu than Come Here or even Sit, because a
Shih Tzu wants to be with you, and if Stay means staying some-
where apart from you, she isn’t going to like it. But that doesn’t
mean she can’t learn Stay, and she should.
Here’s how to train your Shih Tzu Stay:
1. Stand in front of your Shih Tzu and say “Sit.”
I cover Sit earlier in this chapter.
2. Take one step back and hold up your hand, palm facing
your dog, and say, “Stay.”
If your Shih Tzu gets up and comes to you, act like nothing
happened, and don’t reward him. Step back in front of him
and ask him to sit again. Then step back with palm up and
say, “Stay.”
3. Keep repeating Steps 1 and 2 until your Shih Tzu gives up
and stops coming to you.
As soon as he stays put, step back to him right away and
give him a treat. When first teaching this cue, reward him
after just a few seconds. He’ll learn how to stay longer, later
on. You always come back to your Shih Tzu to reward him
with the treat and praise, so he doesn’t have to break his
stay to come get the reward — otherwise, he may confuse
the Stay and Come cues.
4. After your Shih Tzu reliably stays when you take one
step back, try taking two steps back as you say “Stay”
and continue to keep your palm out.
Chapter 17: Mastering the Cues: Sit, Stay, Come, and Others 241

Your Shih Tzu will figure out that the word Stay and the
hand signal mean he shouldn’t move. If he stays put, step
back to him and reward him.
5. Keep adding more steps backwards, just one at a time.
Don’t move farther away until your Shih Tzu reliably stays at
each level. If you practice this in small steps and exercise a
lot of patience, your Shih Tzu can figure out this trick easily.
Keep practicing Stay, for a few minutes several times each
day, until you can say “Stay” and walk all the way out of the
room without your Shih Tzu following you to see where you
went. If he’s really mastered his lesson, he knows perfectly
well that you’ll be back soon to reward him for being such a
good boy.
When training Stay, always reward your Shih Tzu by coming back
to him to give him his treat. This part is crucial. Don’t let your dog
come to you when training this cue. That will be confusing for him.
If you come back to him to reward him, you reinforce that Stay means
Stay, not “Stay for a minute and then come as soon as I say ‘Good
dog.’” After all, “Good dog” doesn’t mean “Come Here!” (although a
lot of dogs seem to think it does!).
Down
Down is incredibly useful when you need your Shih Tzu to stop
bothering people, stop jumping on people, or when you just need
her to settle down a little and chill out. Down means lie down. Your
dog sits, belly on the ground, elbows and paws on the ground, but
with his head up to look at you. Or, he can rest his little chin on his
paws. Dogs can hold Down longer than Sit because it’s more com-
fortable and takes more effort to get back up. Sit is for short periods,
but a well-trained dog can stay in a Down position throughout an
entire family dinner, television program, or visit with friends.
The best way to teach Down is usually the lure-and-reward
method. Here’s how to do it:
1. Stand or sit in front of your Shih Tzu holding a yummy
treat.
2. Touch the treat to his nose.
3. Move the treat forward and down in a long diagonal line
away from your dog, toward the floor.
Some dogs sink into a down position to follow the treat. If
yours does, say “Down” and reward her with the treat. If
Part IV: Training Your Shih Tzu 
242

your dog just creeps along after the treat, take the treat
away (put it behind your back) and start over. This time,
guide the treat down while gently guiding her rear end
down, and then her front legs down. If she goes easily
into the down position, say “Down” and reward her!
If your Shih Tzu resists going into Down, that’s okay. Keep working
on this cue, but also keep a sharp eye out. That active little puppy
is bound to lie down eventually. As soon as she does, say “Down”
and reward her profusely. Catching this behavior enough times
makes her see exactly what you mean when you say “Down.”
Down is harder for younger dogs than for older dogs because they
have so much energy and they want to stay up. However, practic-
ing this cue early comes in handy later because Down is the basis
for many tricks and lessons you may want to teach your Shih Tzu.
A Long Down or Down-Stay (teaching your Shih Tzu to hold the down
position for an extended period of time) can also be great when you
have company over or you’re having dinner and you need your dog
to calm down and behave herself.
Drop It
Shih Tzu got your shoe? Your sandwich? If so, you’ll be glad he
knows Drop It! The trick to teaching a Shih Tzu to drop something
is to convince him that something else — a toy, a treat, or more
attention — is better if he drops what’s in his teeth.
The best way to teach Drop It isn’t to wait until your Shih Tzu gets
something he isn’t supposed to have, but to teach Drop It ahead of
time. Set up your Shih Tzu on purpose to practice this cue. Enough
practice and he’ll know exactly what the word means when he has
something you really need him to drop.
To teach Drop It, follow these steps:
1. Before you call your dog, collect three different items.
Pick one item that your Shih Tzu likes, one he loves, and
one he really loves. These items may be toys or chew sticks
or bones or whatever. Don’t use food.
2. Hold out the object toward the dog and try to get him to
take it in his mouth.
If he doesn’t take it, find something else he’ll take (or try
again later when he’s in a more receptive mood).
Chapter 17: Mastering the Cues: Sit, Stay, Come, and Others 243

3. When your Shih Tzu has the item in his mouth, immedi-
ately show him the next best item.
Most dogs drop any item for an item they like better. Doing
so makes dropping it easy and nonthreatening. Instead of
thinking you’re taking something from him, the dog under-
stands that giving up the object means getting something
better.
4. When your Shih Tzu drops the item to get the better item,
say “Drop It” exactly as he’s dropping the item.
5. Immediately give him the better item and praise him.
If he doesn’t drop the item, try taking it away (gently). If he
relinquishes the item, say “Drop It” and then give him the
treat and praise him.
6. Trade up again, offering your Shih Tzu the very best item.
As he drops the item, say “Drop It,” and then immediately
give him the upgrade and praise him.
Some dogs do these steps right away, but training is always
easier if you know your Shih Tzu wants the item you have
in your hand more than the item he has in his mouth — 
getting your Shih Tzu to trade up willingly. Practice these
steps a few times each day, always saying “Drop It” as he
drops the item.
As your Shih Tzu gets better, try using different items. After he gets
the idea, you can give him a favorite toy and get him to drop it for
a treat. Keep trying different ways to get your Shih Tzu to give up
the goods, but always say “Drop It” the second he does, and reward
him immediately with something better. After much practice (some
dogs master this cue faster than others), you’ll be ready when your
Shih Tzu runs off with your new shoe.
Leash walking
Walking on a leash is the safest way to walk your dog outside. If a
squirrel happens to dash in front of you, Lola may be tempted to run
off to say hello; you’ll be glad that you have her securely on a leash.
Traditional training taught leash walking with a choke collar, but
this method simply doesn’t work for Shih Tzu and can even injure
their delicate necks, possibly contributing to health problems like
collapsing trachea (a condition to which many Toy breeds are
prone — for more on this condition, see Chapter 13).
Part IV: Training Your Shih Tzu 
244

So how do you get your eager little Shih Tzu to walk nicely beside
you without pulling? Frankly, many Shih Tzu do this naturally. They
don’t need training to stay beside you because they already want
to do this. But if you have a leash puller, you can quickly train him
out of this bad habit the same way you train everything else: You
must make walking nicely more rewarding than pulling. You do that
by making pulling unappealing but not in a punishment sort of way.
Follow these steps:
1. Clip the leash to your dog’s collar or harness for a walk.
You can even walk around the house or the backyard. The
point is to practice walking correctly, not to get anywhere.
2. When your Shih Tzu pulls, stop moving.
Don’t look at her.
3. Stop and look the other way.
When you stop, your Shih Tzu may sniff around for awhile,
but eventually she’ll want to keep going.
4. As soon as she looks at you thinking, “What the heck
are you doing just standing there?”, say “Good girl!”
and start walking again.
You want to reward her paying attention to you. The
second she starts pulling, stop again. Only walk when she
isn’t pulling, and be sure to praise her for walking without
pulling. This training method teaches Lola that focusing
on you and sticking close by your side result in movement.
She’ll soon figure out what keeps the walk moving along.
Chapter 17: Mastering the Cues: Sit, Stay, Come, and Others 245
A what? A walk? No way
Some Shih Tzu really don’t care much about walking. If so, you may just let her get
her exercise at home or in the backyard and forget the leash training. Every Shih
Tzu should be accustomed to wearing a leash if necessary, but Toy dogs don’t nec-
essarily need to know how to hold a perfect heel (walking next to you on the leash
without pulling) unless they’re also involved in some kind of show dog or other com-
petitive activity that requires this.
If you and your Shih Tzu love walks, figuring out how to leash walk can be a big pri-
ority. If you both couldn’t really care less about walking, and your dog gets plenty
of exercise romping around the living room, don’t worry about it.

Don’t get me wrong; these steps can be tedious. But you can do
them. Mastering them will be worth the good behavior and pleas-
ant walks the two of you enjoy.
Trying a Few Good Tricks
What’s cuter than a Shih Tzu who can do tricks? At the moment, I
can’t think of a single thing. Because Shih Tzu are so sweetly atten-
tive, some tricks are easy to teach them. Others, not so much. After
all, your Shih Tzu is a small heavily coated toy dog, not a Labrador.
Don’t send him into the river after a big stick. But shake? Speak?
Roll over? Now you’re talking. This section shows you how you
can teach your little Lola or sweet Samson to play these adorable
games with you.
Shake
Some Shih Tzu use their paws a lot and these dogs are easy to
teach how to shake. Every time your Shih Tzu lifts up a paw to
touch you, capture this spontaneous behavior by saying “Shake”
as you take his paw gently, and then reward him. Do this a few
times every day and your Shih Tzu will soon lift up his paw on cue.
To teach Shake to dogs that don’t naturally use their paws much,
follow these steps:
1. While petting your dog, gently touch his paw and then
immediately remove your hand.
You’re getting your Shih Tzu used to having you touch his
paw.
2. As you touch the paw, say a word like “good” or click the
clicker, and then reward him.
3. Repeat until he doesn’t seem to mind you touching his
paw.
4. Touch his paw for longer and mark the touch with the
click or word and then reward.
5. Practice picking up his paw, just for a moment.
As you do this, say “Shake” and then reward. Repeat this
many times each day, and always let go of the paw right
away. Some dogs start to volunteer their paws at this point
to get the reward. If yours does, fantastic!
6. Practice saying “Shake” and holding out your hand to get
your Shih Tzu to lift up his paw on his own.
Part IV: Training Your Shih Tzu 
246

Keep going back and forth between lifting up the paw and
rewarding, and holding out your hand for your Shih Tzu to
lift up his own paw. He should know by now what you want,
and after that solidifies in his mind, if he really wants that
tiny bit of dog cookie, he’ll shake.
If you’ve been diligently trimming your Shih Tzu’s nails or at least
touching his feet every day as part of your daily grooming ritual
(for more on this, see Chapter 10), Samson is probably perfectly
happy to let you touch his paws from the beginning. However,
some dogs just don’t like it. For these little guys, Shake may
simply be a trick you don’t want to bother with. On the other 
hand, practicing Shake often and making it super rewarding, may
just cure your dog’s nail-trimming apprehension.
Speak and Shush
Some Shih Tzu don’t bark much, and that’s exactly the way their
owners like it! So why would you want to teach your Shih Tzu to
start barking or to bark more? Actually, the point of teaching Speak
is to get your Shih Tzu to bark on cue. This trick can be a fun way
to show off your Shih Tzu at parties, which some dogs love (and
the party guests love it too).
The danger of this trick is that many dogs like to volunteer the
Speak just because they know it gets them the treat. If your Shih
Tzu is always volunteering a Speak, you may feel like you’ve cre-
ated a monster. That’s why it’s also good to teach the Shush cue.
On the day you start training this trick, your goal is to capture
every bark with a Speak cue and then reward, and also to capture
every single post-bark moment with a Shush cue, and then reward.
Ideally, you should say “Speak” to barks aimed at you. Your Shih
Tzu will be focused on you and more likely to understand the cue
than if she is busy barking at the mail carrier.
After you’ve linked the words “Speak” and “Shush” with the right
behaviors as often as possible for several days — “Speak!” “Shush!”
“Speak!” “Shush!” — start requesting your Shih Tzu to Speak and
Shush. Here’s how:
1. Hold a treat in front of your Shih Tzu so she can see it,
and say “Speak!”
If your Shih Tzu rarely barks, you may be able to get her
wound up enough with a toy or a good game of tag to get
her to bark. If she does, immediately stop, say “Speak!” and
then reward her.
Chapter 17: Mastering the Cues: Sit, Stay, Come, and Others 247

2. If she barks, give her the treat and praise her.
She did it! If she doesn’t bark, don’t give her the treat.
3. If she barks a second time, in the hope of getting another
treat, say “Shush!”
4. If she keeps barking, don’t give her the treat.
5. If she stops barking and looks at you, wondering why she
isn’t getting the treat this time, give her the treat and
praise her profusely.
She got it! But you have to practice these cues a lot so your
dog can master the difference between Speak and Shush. For
the fastest results, always say “Speak” when your dog barks,
or “Shush” when you want her to stop, until you’re sure she
knows the cues. The more you practice this, the faster she’ll
master it. After she reliably speaks and shushes on cue, you
can stop capturing her random barks. She’s understood you.
It may take awhile for your Shih Tzu to understand what you mean
when you say “Speak” and “Shush” because you can’t say the cue
while she’s barking. She won’t hear you because she’s too busy
barking. But she probably will notice that your response and the
treat must have to do with something.
The more barks and post-bark silences you mark with a cue and
reward the faster she’ll understand. Just be patient and keep at it.
If you start to feel frustrated, stop. This trick should always be fun
or your Shih Tzu won’t want to play, either.
Roll Over
Teaching Roll Over is easy for your Shih Tzu because he’s already
close to the ground. Teach Roll Over using the lure-and-reward
method, like this:
1. Put your Shih Tzu into a Down.
See instructions for how to teach Down earlier in this chapter.
2. Hold the treat in front of his nose so he sees that you
have it.
3. Move the treat just above his head, keeping it very close
to his nose, and try to move it in a slow circle so he fol-
lows the treat and rolls over.
As he does it, say “Roll Over,” and then reward him with
the treat. If you can’t get him to roll over, don’t give him the
treat. You want to be very clear that he hasn’t quite done
what you want yet.
Part IV: Training Your Shih Tzu 
248

4. Keep luring him until he understands what you want him
to do.
You can also help him roll over with your hands, if he doesn’t
mind. As soon as he gets it, reward him!
Some dogs are very resistant to this trick because a dog becomes
very vulnerable when exposing his belly. Only a very secure dog
exposes his belly, but if your dog does, then great! However, if your
dog feels too vulnerable or insecure rolling over, that’s fine, too. No
point in forcing the issue. You can teach him other tricks. But if it’s
just a matter of not getting it, be patient. Work on this trick for just
a few minutes, a few times each day.
You can also start teaching this trick when your dog already hap-
pens to be lying on his side or stretched out on his back. Lure him
back around to his stomach with a treat as you say “Roll Over,”
then praise him and give him the treat. When Samson finally gets
what you want and gets that reward, the moment will be sweet for
both of you. Now, keep practicing so he knows exactly what you
mean when you request it of him: “Roll Over, Samson. Good dog!”
Moving Up with the Truly
Talented, Trainable Shih Tzu
If your Shih Tzu masters tricks easily and loves new tricks, you
may want to consider training your Shih Tzu for more advanced
activities, including competitive obedience, agility, or therapy
work. If so, this section can give you some ins and outs in case
you want to take your Shih Tzu to the next level in training.
Making a Canine Good Citizen
The Canine Good Citizen (CGC) program tests a dog’s obedience
skills and rewards those dogs who pass the test with a CGC title.
This unofficial, but impressive, title shows that your dog has what
it takes to be a model canine citizen, and some programs, such as
dog therapy certification programs, use this test as a prerequisite.
The AKC trains testers to test dogs, usually through local obedience
clubs. Your dog must prove she can perform ten specific behaviors
in front of the tester. These tests include
 Accepting a friendly stranger talking to the pet owner
 Sitting politely for petting
Chapter 17: Mastering the Cues: Sit, Stay, Come, and Others 249

 Being well groomed
 Walking on a leash without pulling
 Walking through a crowd without getting distracted or agitated
 Sitting and staying on cue
 Coming when called
 Reacting appropriately to another friendly dog
 Reacting appropriately to a distraction
 Waiting with a trusted person while the pet owner walks out
of sight for a few minutes
If you want your Shih Tzu to earn a CGC and you think she can pass
this test or you can train her to pass this test, check with your local
dog club to see if they have testers. Some local dog clubs and train-
ers even have training classes specifically to help dogs pass this
test. To find a local club and other CGC-related information, includ-
ing a more detailed description of the ten tests and where your dog
can get tested, check the AKC’s Web page dedicated to the Canine
Good Citizen program at www.akc.org/events/cgc.
Performing competitive obedience
Competitive obedience tests your dog’s ability to perform a set of
exercises like retrieving a dumbbell, jumping over a hurdle, and
staying in place when you walk away. Judges score these exercises.
In each exercise, your dog must score more than 50 percent of the
possible points and get a total score of at least 170 out of a pos-
sible 200. Find out about the AKC’s qualifications and rules of com-
petitive obedience at www.akc.org/events/obedience/index.
cfm. If your dog is registered with the United Kennel Club (UKC),
you can get more info at www.ukcdogs.com/Obedience.htm.
Taking things less seriously: Rally
For less serious competitors, the new Rally program takes a more
informal, fun approach to competition. Rally is a sport where the
dog and handler complete a designed course, proceeding at their
own pace through 10 to 20 stations. At each station a sign is posted
with instructions regarding the next skill to be performed. Scoring
isn’t as rigorous as traditional obedience.
Many pet owners particularly enjoy Rally when they aren’t so con-
cerned with putting highfalutin titles on their dogs. Find out about
the qualifications and rules of Rally for AKC-registered Shih Tzu at
Part IV: Training Your Shih Tzu 
250

www.akc.org/events/rally/index.cfm. (The UKC doesn’t hold
Rally competitions.)
Considering agility: That Shih Tzu
sure can jump!
Agility is a rip-roaring and rollicking good time. Dogs love to do it,
and people love to watch it. In agility, a dog demonstrates athletic
ability by following cues through a timed obstacle course. For Shih
Tzu who seem particularly coordinated and agile, you may consider
this fun obstacle course race, which has dogs literally jumping
through hoops as well as barreling through tunnels, sailing over
see-saws, and navigating weave poles (see Figure 17-2).
Figure 17-2: Your Shih Tzu may enjoy agility competition.
Don’t worry about all those record-breaking Border Collies, either
(the breed famous for dominating this sport). Shih Tzu only com-
pete against other dogs of similar height. For more info on agility,
check out AKC agility at www.akc.org/events/agility/index.
cfm. UKC has a registered agility course as well: www.ukcdogs.
com/Agility.htm.
Conformation shows
If you purchased a show dog, or even if you didn’t but you think
your gorgeous guy or girl would wow ’em in the ring, you can get
involved in conformation showing. Conformation showing is a
sport that judges how a dog is built to encourage bettering the
breeds. Dogs parade around a ring with their handlers, and a judge
Chapter 17: Mastering the Cues: Sit, Stay, Come, and Others 251

examines them for good structure, coat, head shape, and other
physical qualities, as described in the official breed standard
(see Chapter 2). Traditionally, conformation shows reward good
breeding stock, so dogs can’t be spayed or neutered to compete.
AKC show dogs must be registered with the AKC to compete in
conformation, and UKC shows require dogs be UKC-registered. 
For more info on conformation showings, check out these sources:
 www.akc.org/events/conformation/index.cfm
 www.akc.org/events/conformation/beginners.cfm
 www.ukcdogs.com/conformation.htm
If your pup isn’t registered with these organizations (or is spayed
or neutered), you can still participate in fun matches, pet beauty
contests, and other less formal conformation shows. Local training
clubs often train dogs for the show ring, too, so you’ll know exactly
what to expect. They also tend to hold the occasional fun match,
so if you want to find out how to participate in these events, give
your local club a call. (To find a local club, look in the phone book
under dog training or dog club, or look for a local or regional AKC
club at www.akc.org/clubs/search/index.cfm.)
Training a certified therapy dog
Smaller breeds often make excellent therapy dogs. Therapy dogs
go, with their owners, to nursing homes, children’s hospitals, or
other places where people may feel better petting a sweet, soft dog.
And they do make people feel better! Therapy dogs are incredibly
popular and if you get involved in this fun hobby, you’ll likely hear
some pretty amazing stories about the impact therapy dogs make.
The best therapy dogs are quiet, gentle, and intuitive. That also
describes most well-bred and well-trained Shih Tzu. If you think
your Shih Tzu may be the perfect dog to brighten someone else’s
life, check out these links to the two most well-known and reputable
therapy dog certification organizations:
 Therapy Dogs International, Inc.: www.tdi-dog.org
 Delta Society Pet Partners Program: www.deltasociety.org
You can get your dog officially certified through these programs,
which allows you to visit establishments with a pet therapy dog
program. Or, you may be able to start a program in conjunction
with a local hospital or nursing home.

Chapter 18
Ten Shih Tzu Legends:
Believe Them or Not!
In This Chapter
 Exploring Shih Tzu spirituality
 Bowing down to the Shih Tzu’s royal past
 Understanding the Shih Tzu, historically speaking
E
verybody loves a good story, and in this age of reality TV, does
anyone really know (or care) whether the fantastic stories you
hear, see, or experience are absolutely accurate? When it comes to
Shih Tzu history, much of what breed historians know or think they
know or suspect can’t be proven. But that doesn’t stop people from
formulating theories, interpreting historical documents, and just
plain guessing about the fascinating history and, yes, mythology
behind your favorite little long-coated dogs.
Add to the confusion the fact that the histories of several breeds
today — Shih Tzu, Lhasa Apso, Pekingese, Pugs — are intertwined,
and much of the mythology crosses over. Were those temple watch-
dogs Shih Tzu or Lhasa Apso? Were those tiny sleeve dogs Shih Tzu
or Pekingese? But just because there’s no proof that the Buddha had
a Shih Tzu as a pet — a Shih Tzu that could shapeshift (a change
from human form to animal form and vice versa) into a lion at will,
no less — doesn’t mean you can’t enjoy the story. With these cau-
tions in mind, this chapter contains ten myths about Shih Tzu or
their ancestors. Believe them . . . or not!
Buddha’s Pet
Even the spiritually enlightened can benefit from the ultimate com-
panion dog. Legend says that the Buddha himself had a Shih Tzu
with him all the time, and the little dog could magically transform
into a lion, which the Buddha rode.

As a lion, the dog protected and shielded his master from harm. As
a dog, he was most useful as a foot warmer and meditation compan-
ion. (Some versions of this story claim that the Buddha in question
wasn’t the original Buddha but another Buddhist god.) Chinese and
Tibetan breeders emphasized breeding for traits that would liken
the Shih Tzu to the Buddha. There were 32 superior marks of the
Buddha that these breeders sought. Some of these included
 A little shining circle of silver between the eyebrows
 A topknot and a white blaze, or white marking down the fore-
head and between the eyes
 A long large tongue and the square jaws of a lion
 A coat with a touch of pale yellow, because yellow was the
color of royalty
 The marking of a saddle — particularly prized because of the
association of the Buddha riding on the Shih Tzu’s back
Because China Doesn’t Have Lions
The lion is one of Buddhism’s sacred symbols, but lions aren’t native
to China, so legend has it that the Chinese bred and groomed their
little lion dogs to resemble that kingly beast, lending a particularly
noble and commanding air to the tiny Shih Tzu.
Some folks also say that the famous Chinese lion sculptures stand-
ing imposingly outside palace doors (and Chinese restaurants) look
more like dogs than like lions because the artists had only the dogs
themselves and paintings from royal dog books as models, because
each succeeding ruler had his favorite dogs painted. From these
dubious sources, the artists guessed what lions looked like.
Prayer Wheel Duty
Shih Tzu probably evolved when the Chinese bred the Tibetan
Spaniels or Lhasa Apsos with the Chinese Pekingese. The Tibetan
Spaniel’s head more closely resembles the Shih Tzu than the more
flat and narrow skull shape of the Lhasa, but historical records say
Lhasas were also crossed in at some point. Either way, the Shih Tzu’s
origins must certainly be in Tibet, where small dogs guarded the
Buddhist temples and turned the prayer wheels in the monastery’s
daily ritual to release prayers to the heavens.
Part V: The Part of Tens 
256

Watch Dog for the Guard Dogs
Shih Tzu, or their ancestors, did more than provide cuddly com-
panionship for the Tibetan monks. The small Asian dogs of Tibet
were probably larger than today’s Shih Tzu and tough enough to
withstand the harsh conditions in the mountains of Tibet.
These little dogs also served an important function. Large, ferocious
dogs (possibly related to the Tibetan Mastiff) guarded the temples,
but the Shih Tzu, with its keen and alert senses, noticed intruders
first and barked to alert the guard dogs to attack. They were like
the trip wire that sets off an alarm. Even today, Shih Tzu have very
acute hearing.
Shih Tzu Means Chrysanthemum
Dog
Shih Tzu means little lion in Mandarin Chinese, but the Shih Tzu is
also sometimes called the “Chrysanthemum Dog” because the Shih
Tzu’s sweet little face looks like the chrysanthemum flower, with
hair sprouting in all directions like flower petals. Lady Brownrigg,
who brought the first Shih Tzu into England, coined the phrase
Chrysanthemum Dog.
The Wet Nurses Did What?
Shih Tzu were so prized and honored in China that human servants
were employed to nurse the puppies on human milk to elevate their
status to the human level. Talk about treating your dog like a baby.
Sleeve Dogs: A Fashion Statement
Shih Tzu and their ancestors have come in many sizes, as fashions
changed during different periods of history. Sometimes, the very
smallest Shih Tzu were all the rage, particularly in the mid-19th cen-
tury, and Chinese ladies kept these tiny furballs in the huge sleeves
of their kimonos. This practice spurred the term sleeve dogs to refer
to the tiniest Shih Tzu, Pekingese, and Pugs (although most of the
sleeve dogs were probably Pekingese). When the Dowager Empress
Tzu Hsi reigned in China, after 1900, she put a stop to the artificial
dwarfing of her favorite little dogs and bred them to a more normal
and healthier size.
Chapter 18: Ten Shih Tzu Legends: Believe Them or Not! 257

For Royalty Only
Back as far as the 17th century, legend tells that the Chinese
emperor deemed his small dogs much smarter than any humans
and bestowed royal ranking on all the dogs in his court. The dogs
wore the hats befitting of their station, and the female dogs wore
the ladies’ hats appropriate for a wife of a ranking official.
The Dowager Empress Tzu Hsi of China did more than anyone else
to advance and refine the Shih Tzu breed in particular. The Empress
so prized her little Shih Tzu that only royalty were allowed to own
Shih Tzu. In fact, selling a Shih Tzu to a commoner resulted in a
death sentence for the offender, and some say the Empress would
have the most beloved Shih Tzu killed instead of letting it suffer
the horrible fate of being owned by a commoner.
Bred by Palace Eunuchs
During the reign of the Dowager Empress Tzu Hsi, her most trusted
servants were the palace eunuchs. Some were loyal and some were
traitorous, but these eunuchs were in charge of the breeding pro-
grams for the Empress’s favorite little dogs. They competed to pro-
duce the best and most beautifully marked Shih Tzu. Some people
say that the eunuchs secretly sold the less promising puppies to
commoners for a great price, even though this practice was strictly
forbidden and punishable by death. Historians also believe that
much of the damage to the royal palace after the death of the Old
Empress was done by the eunuchs to cover up their stealing and
selling of her dogs.
Obliterated by Communists
Throughout history, China has been invaded many times, but 
when the Communists took over the government, owning pets
was strongly discouraged and many Chinese breeds almost died
out completely. Luckily, Shih Tzu had been stolen, smuggled, or
otherwise secretly transported from China to Europe and the
United States, where the Shih Tzu was able to thrive.
The first Shih Tzu to reach the western world was brought into
England by Miss Hutchins in 1930. The dog was owned by Miss
Hutchins and Lady Brownrigg. However, only one import reaching
the West was a dog actually bred in the Imperial palace — a single
black Shih Tzu, one of three dogs Madame Henrik Kauffman, wife of
the Danish Ambassador to China, brought to Europe in 1932. Mme.
Kauffman registered all three of these dogs with the Norwegian
Kennel Club in 1934.

Ten Tips for Showing 
Your Shih Tzu
In This Chapter
 Sizing up your Shih Tzu’s show potential
 Checking out the show scene in person
 Training and grooming for the big time
 Figuring out dog show lingo
You know that your Shih Tzu has that extra-special something
and he deserves a shelf full of silver cups and blue ribbons.
You may be right. Showing your Shih Tzu can be fun and extremely
rewarding, but it can also be highly competitive and incredibly
frustrating, depending on how much potential your dog really has,
how much you dedicate to the pursuit, and how serious you really
are about putting titles on your little Lola or Samson.
I could write an entire book, just on showing your Shih Tzu. Although
I’ve tried to focus this book on your pet Shih Tzu and not your show
dog, some of you may still want to show. So even if you’re a teeny
bit interested in showing your Shih Tzu, this chapter gives you tips
on showing and can whet your appetite — or convince you that you
don’t really want to show after all.
But if you do have a show prospect, books aren’t the best way to
understand the art of showing your dog. Go check out the real
thing, in person, to get a clue about this strange and wonderful
world. To find dog shows near you, check out this chapter.
Know the Breed Standards
At its very heart, the dog show is about rewarding the dog that
most closely fits the written breed standard, which describes the
ideal specimen of an individual breed that breeders should aim for
in their breeding programs.

Show dogs can’t be spayed or neutered (except for less formal pet
dog shows, which can also be fun). If Shih Tzu are judged to be great
potential breeders, then the point is to breed them. But you don’t
have to want to breed your dog to show your dog. You can do it just
for fun. Even so, if your Shih Tzu doesn’t match the standard very
closely, you probably won’t get very far. (Check out Chapter 2 for a
complete discussion on breed standard.)
Read the standard carefully and take a good hard look at your Shih
Tzu. If she deviates from the standard in any obvious way, like being
smaller than eight inches or taller than 11 inches at the shoulder or
having a very shy temperament, she probably won’t do well in the
show ring.
Check for “Faults”
Of course your little baby doesn’t have faults, right? But if you want
to show, you need to know that the breed standard lists faults that
disqualify your pup from the show ring. Faults are qualities that
don’t live up to the ideal, and they affect a judge’s assessment of
the dog in the show ring. Occasionally, a dog with faults may win if
all the other qualities are superior, but in general, faults don’t pass
the test for a Best-in-Show hopeful.
For the extreme lowdown on what the breed standard has to say
about faults, check out www.akc.org. The AKC’s Web site is a wealth
of info about all parts of dog shows and standards. You can also
flip to Chapter 2. If your dog does have a fault but you really want
to get involved in an activity with him, consider pet therapy, Rally,
or something else that isn’t based on perfect conformation. Of
course, a physically imperfect Shih Tzu can and often does make a
perfect pet.
Visit Dog Shows
If you like the idea of dog shows, but aren’t sure about the reality,
then take time to attend a dog show. They may not be what you
imagine at all! Visiting a dog show gives you a glimpse into the
world from the spectator side, and that can tell you a lot about
what it would be like to show your Shih Tzu. Visiting a dog show
may also convince you that you aren’t so interested after all.
When you visit, choose a benched show if possible that allows you
to look at the dogs and talk to the breeders when they aren’t in the
ring. In some outdoor shows and indoor ring shows, you can also
Part V: The Part of Tens 
260

talk to the breeders. Ask questions about showing. You can’t bring
your dog into the show if he isn’t part of the show or if he’s less than
6 months old, but if you bring a good picture of him, some helpful
exhibitors may even be able to advise you about your dog’s
prospects as a show dog.

akc.org/events/search. Click the Conformation tab, select your
state, and click the Search button. You can also subscribe to the
AKC Gazette to get updated, first-hand information on dog shows.
The Gazette comes in two sections. One is the journal with articles,
and one is the Events Calendar, which lists shows, dates, judges, and
breed seminars, usually three months in advance. For subscriptions
go online at www.akc.org/pubs/index.cfm or call (800) 533-7323.
Find a Mentor
A mentor is a dog show expert — a breeder and/or exhibitor —
who takes you under her wing, guides you through the process of
doing your first few shows, and gives you advice to save you a lot of
time and keep you from making some common beginner mistakes.
If your Shih Tzu’s breeder shows her dogs frequently (most of the
best breeders do or used to), she may be able to give you some
great advice and even take you to some shows. If she can’t commit
to that, she may be able to recommend show people to help you.
If you don’t know any other Shih Tzu folks, when you attend dog
shows, ask around. Someone may be able to hook you up with just
the right person to show you the ropes. A good way to start would
be to join the American Shih Tzu Club (ASTC). Check them out at
www.shihtzu.org.
Attend a Training Class
When you watch a dog show, you probably notice that the handlers
all seem to know just what to do with their dogs: when to move,
when to stop, and how to help the dogs show themselves off most
effectively. Where do those handlers learn those skills?
After you’re in the ring, the judge tells you (and everyone else)
how to move, when to move, and where to move. Most judges use
down and back so they can view the rear and front movement of
the dog and the triangle pattern to best see the side, front, and
rear, for side movement. Many exhibitors pick up these patterns
from others or by attending a lot of shows, but many people also
Chapter 19: Ten Tips for Showing Your Shih Tzu 261

take conformation classes that teach you everything you need to
know to navigate a dog show with ease. You’ll get a lot of practice
before you jump into the real thing.
Check with your local dog club to see if they offer conformation
training classes. You can also find nearby conformation clubs
online at www.akc.org/clubs/search/index.cfm.
Practice Handling Techniques
Even though Shih Tzu take to handling better than some breeds, not
all of them like to be poked, prodded, and examined by strangers.
But that’s just what happens in a dog show. Shih Tzu are judged 
on a table. Often, if a dog has never been set up on a table before a
dog show, the dog will get spooked. You want your little show dog
to stand up there with confidence.
The best way to get your Shih Tzu used to the kind of hands-on
examination she’ll experience in a show is to practice the things
that the judges will do. This examination may include
 Petting
 Looking in the ears
 Pulling back the lips
 Examining the eyes
 Picking up the feet
 Pressing the paw pads
 Lifting up the tail
 Running hands down both sides of the body
Have other family members and friends do these actions, too, a
few times every day. And before long, your Shih Tzu will be used
to people handling her. Dogs don’t fear what they’re used to 
experiencing.
If your little show prospect really hates the poking and prodding,
resists the table, and just doesn’t seem to enjoy any of it, you may
consider passing on the conformation ring idea. Some dogs get
used to showing and learn to love it, but some never do. Maybe
your Shih Tzu would have more fun doing something else, like
Rally.

Practice for Perfection
The age-old advice of practice makes perfect applies to more than
piano lessons and soccer practice. Conformation training classes
can give you a lot of specific activities to practice to make your
dog show experience easier and more pleasurable.
Although some people get lucky right away and their dogs take to
the activity immediately, other dog owners need to persevere so
their dogs feel comfortable in the show ring. Try out these tips for
your practice times:
 Work at home every day, training your dog to walk beside you
on the leash without pulling. (For more on how to do this, see
Chapter 17.)
 Practice the right grooming for the show ring.
 Practice handling the dog like the judge would.
 Practice spending time together to improve your 
communication.
Before you know it, the two of you will be dog show pros. And
don’t forget that competing in dog shows counts as practice, too!
Master the Art of Stacking
Stacking is a dog show term that means the handler poses the
dog’s body to show it off the best, although many show dogs are
trained how to stack themselves. Shih Tzu are stacked both on the
judging table and on the ground, although the judge rarely examines
a Shih Tzu on the ground. He’ll stand back and look at him, instead,
and if the judge wants a closer look, he’ll ask you to put the dog on
the table again.
When dogs stand alert and look up at you and seem to pose on their
own, that’s called free stacking, but many handlers stack their dogs
in the ring by moving their feet a little, pulling up at the tail, and
generally adjusting the pose — sort of like a photographer does
during a photo shoot.
When you attend a dog show, watch the handlers and what they do
to the Shih Tzu when the dogs are standing at attention and when
they’re up on the table. Look how they pick up and put down the
Shih Tzu on the table. Some handlers don’t stack their dogs, but
many do. At dog shows, you can ask handlers about how to do
Chapter 19: Ten Tips for Showing Your Shih Tzu 263

this, but make sure to wait until they’re out of the show ring. Some
helpful people are happy to give advice.
Check Out the Groom Room
Different handlers groom dogs in slightly different ways, but to
be competitive, Shih Tzu have to be groomed a certain way for the
show ring. Although Shih Tzu don’t need the exacting and meticu-
lous grooming of the Poodle or the Bichon, they do require exten-
sive grooming and a long coat for showing.
The best way to discover how to perfect the Shih Tzu coat is to
train under someone who already knows how. Then you can take
the lessons and develop your own style and flair. If you’re on
friendly terms with your professional groomer, he may even give
you some tips. You can also watch in the grooming area of some
indoor and outdoor dog shows.
You can find out grooming tips on your own, too. The ASTC has a
grooming page on their Web site at www.shihtzu.org/Articles/
article_list.asp?menu=Articles&ART_TYPE=Grooming. Or,
consult Chapter 10.
Know the Lingo
Dog show lingo can get pretty confusing, and to newbies, it may
even sound like a foreign language. You can do more research on
the AKC Web site or read about dog shows in books dedicated to
the subject, but here are a few things you should know:
 Dogs shows can be all-breed shows, specialty shows of just
one breed, or group shows with only, for example, Toy breeds.
 To compete in a dog show, dogs must be at least 6 months
old, registered with the AKC, and not spayed or neutered.
 Each dog must be entered into a particular class: Puppy (for
dogs age from 6 to 12 months), Novice (for dogs older than 6
months who haven’t won three first prizes), or Open (for any
dog 6 months or older). Male and female dogs compete sepa-
rately in most classes.
 Dog shows typically have several levels. All-breed and group
shows have breed competitions and then group competitions,
where the winning breeds compete against each other.
 Several other rules and regulations exist for a number of
shows. If you’re interested in finding out more, check out
www.akc.org/events/conformation/beginners.cfm.
