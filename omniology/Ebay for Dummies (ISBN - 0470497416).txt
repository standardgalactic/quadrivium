About the Author
Marsha Collier spends a good deal of time on eBay. She loves buying and 
selling (she’s a PowerSeller with her own eBay store) as well as meeting eBay 
users from around the world. As a columnist, an author of three bestselling 
books on eBay, and an invited lecturer at eBay Live, she shares her knowl-
edge of eBay with millions of online sellers. eBay For Dummies is published 
in special versions for the United Kingdom, Canada, Germany, and Australia. 
Currently, she has 15 books in print on her favorite subject — eBay. 
Before her eBay career took off, Marsha owned and operated her own mar-
keting and advertising fi rm, a company that won numerous awards and 
earned her “Small Business of the Year” accolades from several organiza-
tions. She got started with eBay during the site’s early years and quickly mas-
tered the art of buying and reselling for profi t.
Marsha is one of the foremost eBay experts and educators in the world and 
the top-selling eBay author. In 1999 Marsha created the fi rst edition of eBay For 
Dummies, the bestselling book for eBay beginners. She followed up the success 
of the fi rst book with Starting an eBay Business For Dummies, a book targeting 
individuals interested in making e-commerce their full-time profession. That 
book became an instant nationwide hit, making several notable bestseller lists. 
These books are updated regularly to keep up with site and market changes.
Marsha’s books have sold over 1,000,000 copies (including the special edi-
tions in foreign countries — two in Australia, two in Canada, and two in the 
United Kingdom — as well as translations in Spanish, French, Italian, Chinese 
and German). 
Along with her writing, Marsha is an experienced e-commerce educator. She 
was the lead instructor at eBay University (teaching seminars all over the 
United States), as well as a regular presenter at the eBay Live national con-
vention since its inception. Marsha also hosted “Make Your Fortune Online,” 
a PBS special on online business that premiered in 2005. The show was the 
basis for her PBS premium fi ve DVD set, “Your Online Business Plan.” In 2006, 
she was invited to address the Innovations Conference in Singapore to pres-
ent the ideas of e-commerce to a new market. In 2008, she was dubbed one 
of twenty infl uential iCitizens in Kelly Mooney’s The Open Brand: When Push 
Comes to Pull in a Web Made World, and was invited to speak at a leading 
e-commerce conference attended by Coca-Cola, Hewlett Packard, Procter & 
Gamble, Victoria’s Secret, and leading e-commerce leaders. 

During the holiday season, she does several national satellite media tours 
to explain the safety of shopping online. She hosts Computer & Technology 
Radio on KTRB 860 AM in San Francisco as well as on the Web at www.
computerandtechnologyradio.com. She also makes regular appearances 
on television, radio, and in print to discuss customer needs and online 
commerce.
Marsha currently resides in Los Angeles, CA. She can be reached via her Web 
site, www.coolebaytools.com or her blog at http://mcollier.

Dedication
To all the future eBay buyers and sellers who have purchased this book to 
get a taste of how much fun online buying and selling can be. I look forward 
to seeing your auctions and hearing your stories.
I dedicate this book also to all the employees at eBay, who work very hard 
and don’t always get noticed or appreciated by the community. I want to 
thank all of you for your endeavors; you make eBay a fun and profi table site 
to visit for millions of people. Keep on doing what you’re doing.
Author’s Acknowledgments
This book couldn’t have been written without the input from thousands of 
eBay sellers and buyers that I’ve spoken to from all over the country. You 
inspire me to work harder and do my best to help all of you. 
I’ve made so many friends along my eBay travels: if it wasn’t for them, this 
book wouldn’t be here. Thanks to the rest of my eBay buddies — who always 
seem to have a moment when I call.
I particularly want to thank my editors at Wiley Publishing, Inc.: my really 
fun and smart project editor Susan Pink; my super tech editor Louise 
(aunt*patti); Ruby (who, by the way, was one of the very fi rst eBay employ-
ees) — she’s always there for me!; Steven Hayes, who is always there for sup-
ports and ideas; and Andy Cummings, my publisher, who, lucky for me — still 
takes my calls!
Thank you all!

eBay For Dummies, 6th Edition

Introduction
W
elcome to eBay For Dummies, 6th Edition! Thanks for opening up this 
book. This is the newly updated version of the original best-selling 
eBay how-to guide, first published in 1999. Heed my words and you may 
soon be joining the millions of people interested in learning the no-nonsense 
facts about eBay from an active user. I’m a longtime eBay shopper and 
PowerSeller. My original career was in retail marketing and for over 10 years 
I’ve been making money on the site. (I even put my daughter through college 
on my profits!) I work from home and apply my background successfully to 
all facets of the site.
I can’t begin to tell you how excited I am that my enthusiasm and excitement 
for shopping and selling on eBay has spread to so many corners of the world. 
eBay users (like you and I) total close to 200 million — that’s quite a commu-
nity. It’s a community of buyers who don’t feel the need to scour the streets 
for items to buy and of sellers who forage wholesale items to sell online and 
make a few dollars (or a full-time living). This makes eBay the new interna-
tional marketplace, and the best part is that eBay is available to anyone who 
wants to take the time to figure out how it works.
My books are written sequentially, and this is the one to start with if you’re a 
beginner. eBay For Dummies will give you the solid foundation you need to go 
on to my other, more advanced books on eBay selling.
eBay is a constantly evolving Web site. It isn’t too hard to master, but just 
as with any tool, when you know the ins and outs, you’re ahead of the game. 
You can get the deals when you shop, and you can make the most money 
when you sell. You’ve come to the right place to find out all about eBay. 
This book is designed to help you understand the basics about buying and 
selling on eBay, the most successful person-to-person trading community. 
Without the basics, you can’t be successful in any endeavor. You get all the 
tools you need to get moving on eBay, whether you’re new to the Internet or 
a Webaholic. You see how to turn your everyday household clutter into cold, 
hard cash — and how to look for items that you can sell on eBay. If you’re an 
online shopper (or you’d like to be), I show you how to figure out how much 
you should spend, how to make smart bids, and how to win the auctions. 
How much money you earn (or spend) depends entirely on how often and 
how smartly you conduct your eBay transactions. You decide how often you 
want to run auctions and place bids; I’m here to help with the smart part by 
sharing tips I’ve learned over my past ten years on eBay.

eBay For Dummies, 6th Edition 
A Web site as complex as eBay has many nooks and crannies that may 
confuse users. Think of this book as a detailed road map that can help you 
navigate eBay, getting just as much or as little as you want from it. Unlike an 
actual road map, however, you won’t get frustrated folding it back to its origi-
nal shape. Just close the book and come back anytime you need a question 
answered.
After you figure out the nuts and bolts of eBay, you can start buying and sell-
ing stuff. I have a ton of terrific buying and selling strategies that help you get 
the most out of your auctions. With this book and a little elbow grease, you 
can join the ranks of the millions of people who use their home computers 
to make friends, find great deals, have a lot of fun, and make a profit. When 
you’ve got the hang of eBay and feel that it’s time to graduate from this book, 
look for my Starting an eBay Business For Dummies, 3rd Edition (Wiley) — it’ll 
take you to the next plateau.
About This Book
Remember those open-book tests that teachers sprang on you in high 
school? Well, sometimes you may feel like eBay pop-quizzes you while you’re 
online. Think of eBay For Dummies, 6th Edition, as your open-book-test cheat 
sheet with all the answers. You don’t have to memorize anything; just keep 
this book handy to help you get over the confusing parts of eBay. Over the 
years, some of the top sellers and buyers on the eBay site have visited with 
me when I’m at a book signing or teaching at eBay University just to show 
me their dog-eared, highlighted, marred copy of an earlier edition of eBay For 
Dummies that got them started. This book will do the same for you.
With all that in mind, I’ve divided this book into pertinent sections to help 
you find your answers fast. I’ll show you how to
 
✓ Get online and register on eBay.
 
✓ Navigate eBay to do just about anything you can think of — search for 
items for sale, set up auctions, monitor your transactions, and join the 
community circuit.
 
✓ Bid on and win eBay auctions.
 
✓ Choose an item to sell, pick the right time for your listing, market it so 
that a bunch of bidders see it, and make a nice profit.
 
✓ Communicate well and close deals without problems, whether you’re a 
buyer or a seller.
 
✓ Handle problems with finesse, should they crop up.
 
✓ Become a part of a unique community of people who like to collect, buy, 
and sell items of just about every type!

 Introduction
 
Do not adjust your eyes. To protect the privacy of eBay users, screen images 
(commonly called screen shots) in this book blur user IDs to protect the inno-
cent (or not so . . .).
Foolish Assumptions
You may have picked up this book because you heard that people are making 
huge money selling on eBay and you want to find out what’s going on. Or you 
heard about the bargains and wacky stuff you can find in the world’s largest 
shopping emporium. If either of these assumptions is true, this is the right 
book for you.
Here are some other foolish assumptions I’ve made about you:
 
✓ You have, or would like to have, access to a computer, a modem, and 
the Internet so that you can do business on eBay.
 
✓ You have an interest in collecting stuff, selling stuff, or buying stuff, and 
you want to find out more about doing that stuff online.
 
✓ You want tips and strategies that can save you money when you bid 
or buy and make you money when you sell. (You too? I can relate. We 
already have a lot in common.)
 
✓ You’re concerned about maintaining your privacy and staying away 
from people who try to ruin everyone’s good time with negligent (and 
sometimes illegal) activity.
How This Book Is Organized
This book has five parts. The chapters stand on their own, which means 
that you can read Chapter 5 after you read Chapter 10 or skip Chapter 3 alto-
gether. It’s all up to you. I do think that you should at least dip into Chapter 1 
and Chapter 2 to get an overview on what eBay is all about and find out how 
to become a registered user.
If you’re already conducting transactions on eBay, you certainly can jump 
ahead to get good tips on advanced strategies to enhance your sales. Don’t 
wait for permission from me — just go for it. I won’t argue with you that well-
written listings equal higher profits!

eBay For Dummies, 6th Edition 
Part I: Getting a Feel for eBay
In Part I, I tell you what eBay is and how you use it. I take you through the 
registration process, help you organize your eBay transactions and interac-
tions using the My eBay page, and get you comfortable navigating the site 
from the home page.
Part II: Buying Like an Expert
If you’re pretty sure you want to start making bids on items, check out Part II, 
which gives you the lowdown on searching, grading a collectible item’s value, 
researching, bidding, and winning auctions.
That old cliché, “Let the buyer beware,” (caveat emptor for the literati in the 
audience) became a cliché because even today (maybe especially today) it’s 
sound advice. Use my friendly, sugar-free tips to help you decide when to bid 
and when to take a pass.
Part III: Making Money the eBay Way
Part III gets you up-to-speed on how to sell your items on eBay. Think of it as 
an eBay course in marketing. Here you find important information on how 
to conduct your auctions, what to do after you sell an item, how to ship the 
item, and how to keep track of all the money you make. Even Uncle Sam gets 
to chime in on his favorite topic: taxes. Know the rules so your friendly local 
tax office doesn’t invite you over for a cup of coffee and a little audit.
I also show you how to gussy up your auctions by adding pictures and how to 
use basic HTML to add a little extra “sell” like they do in infomercials. You can 
make your digital images look like high art with my tips, hints, and strategies.
Part IV: Even More of eBay’s 
Special Features
Check out Part IV to discover how to handle privacy concerns relating to 
eBay and how you can resolve buying and selling issues with the help of 
Trust & Safety, eBay’s problem-solving clearinghouse. Also included are ways 
to have fun with the eBay community and using charity auctions to bid on 
great items for a good cause.

 Introduction
Part V: The Part of Tens
In keeping with a long For Dummies tradition, Part V is a compendium of 
short chapters that give you ready references and useful facts. I share more 
terrific tips for buying and selling items, as well as descriptions of my favorite 
software programs that can help lighten your auction load.
In addition to all these parts, you also get an appendix. It gives some insider 
information on how to spot a trend before the rest of the world catches on 
and how to acquire items cheaply that others may spend a bundle on. After 
you’ve read this book and you’re ready to go to the next level, take a look at 
my other book, Starting an eBay Business For Dummies. It takes off where this 
book ends.
Icons Used in This Book
 
These are facts that you just have to know! Time is money on eBay. When you 
see this shortcut or time-saver come your way, read the information and think 
about all the greenbacks you just saved.
 
Think of this icon as a sticky note for your brain. If you forget one of the pearls 
of wisdom revealed to you, you can go back and reread it. If you still can’t 
remember something here, go ahead, dog-ear the page — I won’t tell. Even 
better: Use a yellow highlighter.
 
Don’t feel my pain. I’ve done plenty of things wrong on eBay before and really 
want to save you from my mistakes. I put these warnings out there bright and 
bold so that you don’t have a bad experience. Don’t skip these warnings 
unless you’re enthusiastic about masochism.
 
When you see this icon, you know you’re in for the real deal. I created this 
icon especially for you to give you war stories and success stories from eBay 
veterans that can help you strategize, make money, and spare you from the 
perils of a poorly written auction item description. (“Learn from their experi-
ences” is my motto.) You can skip these icons if you want to, but you may get 
burned if you do.
You’ll also see a sidebar now and then. They contain text on a gray back-
ground to make them stand out. Sometimes they have an important short 
fact that I want you to know or contain some useful technical stuff.

eBay For Dummies, 6th Edition 
What Now?
Like everything else in the world, eBay changes. Some of the eBay screens 
in this book may look slightly different than the ones you see on your home 
computer display. That’s just eBay tweaking and improving things on the 
site. My job is to arm you with everything you need to know to join the eBay 
community and begin conducting transactions. If you hit rough waters, just 
look up the problem in the table of contents or index in this book. I either 
help you solve it or let you know where to go on eBay for some expert advice.
Although eBay makes its complex Web site as easy to navigate as possible, 
you may still need to refer to this book for help. Don’t get frustrated if you 
have to keep reviewing topics before you feel completely comfortable trading 
on eBay.
After all, Albert Einstein once said, “Don’t commit to memory something you 
can look up.” (Although I forget when he said that. . . .)

Part I
Getting a Feel 
for eBay

In this part . . . 
N
ew technology can be intimidating for anyone. 
You’ve wanted to visit eBay, maybe make a few dol-
lars selling or getting in on some of the great bargains, but 
to some, eBay feels kind of big and scary. What you need 
is someone to point out the most useful tools you need to 
get around, help you find out how eBay works, and start 
showing you how to do your own transactions. That’s 
what I do in Part I.
In this part, you find out how to become a registered user, 
maneuver the eBay home page, and customize your very 
own private My eBay page. You can also find out about 
the all-important feedback profile that follows every eBay 
user around like a shadow.

Bay has emerged as the marketplace of the twenty-first century. Way 
back in 2003, Wired magazine predicted that eBay’s promise is that 
“retailing will become the national pastime.” The founders had a pretty great 
idea back in 1995 (read about some eBay history in the “eBay’s humble begin-
nings” sidebar later in this chapter), and the world has taken to shopping and 
selling online. eBay is a safe and fun place to shop for everything from col-
lectibles to brand-new clothing, all from the comfort of your home.
eBay is now also a marketplace for new merchandise. It’s no longer just the 
destination for collectibles and old china patterns. These days you can pur-
chase new and useful items, such as alarm systems, fancy electronic tooth-
brushes, lightbulbs, clothing, cars, homes — just about anything you can 
think of.
Take a look around your house. Nice Manolos. Spiffy microwave. Great-
looking clock. Not to mention all the other cool stuff you own. All these great 
fashions, household appliances, and collectibles are fabulous to own, but 
when was the last time your clock turned a profit? When you connect to

Part I: Getting a Feel for eBay 
eBay, your PC or Mac can magically turn into a money machine. Just visit 
eBay and marvel at all the items that are just a few mouse clicks away from 
being bought and sold.
In this chapter, I tell you what eBay is and how it works. eBay is the perfect 
alternative to spending hours wandering through boutiques, antiques shops, 
or outlet malls looking for the perfect doohickey. It can also be your per-
sonal shopper for gifts and day-to-day items. (For more information on how 
to match the perfect eBay gift with one of your friends, check out my book, 
Santa Shops on eBay, also published by Wiley.)
Not only can you buy and sell stuff in the privacy of your home, but you can 
also meet people who share your interests. Those who use the eBay site are a 
friendly bunch, and soon you’ll be buying, selling, swapping stories, and trad-
ing advice with the best of them.
To get to eBay, you need to access the Internet. To access the Internet, you 
need a PC or a Mac with an Internet connection. (Inexpensive laptops are 
available for as little as $299.) If you’re not ready to take the high-tech plunge, 
this book shows you how to start operating on eBay (and earning money) 
without owning a single cyber thing.
What Is eBay, and How Does It Work?
The Internet is spawning all kinds of businesses (known as e-commerce to 
Wall Street types), and eBay is the superstar. The reason is simple: It’s the 
place where buyers and sellers can meet, do business, share stories and tips, 
and have fun. It’s like one giant online potluck party — but instead of bring-
ing a dish, you sell it!
 
eBay doesn’t sell a thing. Instead, the site does what all good hosts do: It cre-
ates a comfy environment that brings together people with common interests. 
You can think of eBay as the person who set you up on your last blind date — 
except the results are often a lot better. Your matchmaking friend doesn’t per-
form a marriage ceremony but does get you in the same room with your 
potential soul mate. eBay puts buyers and sellers in a virtual store and lets 
them conduct their business safely within the rules that eBay has established.
All you need to do to join eBay is fill out a few forms online and click. 
Congratulations — you’re a member with no big fees or secret handshakes. 
After you register, you can buy and sell anything that falls within the eBay rules 
and regulations. (Chapter 2 eases you through the registration process.)

 Chapter 1: Why You’re Going to Love Your Time on eBay
The eBay home page, shown in Figure 1-1, is your first step to finding all the 
cool stuff you can see and do on eBay. You can conduct searches, find out 
what’s happening, and get an instant link to the My eBay page, which helps 
you keep track of every item you have up for sale or have a bid on. You can 
read more about the eBay home page in Chapter 3 and find out more about 
My eBay in Chapter 4.

Yikes! What happened? The eBay home page on your computer looks nothing 
like the one in Figure 1-1? Don’t rub your eyes — even squinting hard won’t 
help; eBay has a different version of the home page for those who have never 
registered on eBay. Even if you have never registered, someone else who uses 
the computer may already have. Know that whatever version of the eBay 
home page you view, it has the same basic elements.

Part I: Getting a Feel for eBay 
All about Auctions
The value of an item is determined by how much someone is willing to spend 
to buy it. That’s what makes auctions exciting. eBay offers several kinds of 
auctions, but for the most part, they all work the same way. An auction is a 
unique sales event where the exact value of the item for sale is not known. 
As a result, an element of surprise is involved — not only for the bidder (who 
may end up with a great deal) but also for the seller (who may end up making 
a killing). Here’s how an auction works from a seller’s perspective and a bid-
der’s perspective:
 
✓ Seller: A seller pays a fee, fills out an electronic form, and sets up the 
auction, listing a minimum bid he or she is willing to accept for the item. 
Think of an auctioneer at Sotheby’s saying, “The bidding for this dia-
mond necklace begins at $5,000.” You might want to bid $4,000, but the 
bid won’t be accepted. Sellers can also set a reserve price — sort of a 
financial safety net that protects them from losing money on the deal. I 
explain how this stuff works later in this section.
 
✓ Bidder: Bidders in auctions duke it out over a period of time (the minimum 
is one day, but most auctions last a week or even longer) until one comes 
out victorious. Usually, the highest bidder wins. The tricky thing about par-
ticipating in an auction (and the most exciting aspect) is that no one knows 
the final price an item goes for until the last second of the auction.
eBay’s humble beginnings
The long-standing urban legend says eBay all 
started with a Pez dispenser. But as romantic as 
the story is (of the young man who designed the 
site for his fiancé to trade Pez dispensers), the 
story is, sadly, public relations spin. The founder, 
Pierre Omidyar, had the right vision at the right 
time, and the first item he sold on the site, origi-
nally named AuctionWeb, was a broken laser 
pointer. Day by day, new people (including me in 
1996) were drawn to the site from Internet chat-
ter. The site eventually grew to the point where 
it began to strain Pierre’s ISP. 
The ISP charged him more, so he started charg-
ing a small listing fee for sellers, just so he could 
break even. Legend has it that the day $10,000 in 
fees arrived in Pierre’s mailbox, he quit his day 
job. (I hope that’s not apocryphal too!)
eBay was born on Labor Day 1995. The name 
eBay is taken from Echo Bay, the name Pierre 
originally wanted for his company. Upon check-
ing with the State of California, he found that 
the name was taken by another company, so he 
shortened the name to eBay — and the rest, as 
they say, is history.

13
 Chapter 1: Why You’re Going to Love Your Time on eBay
eBay auctions
Unlike “traditional” live auctions that end with the familiar phrase “Going 
once, going twice, sold!” eBay auctions are controlled by the clock. The seller 
pays a fee and lists the item on the site for a predetermined period of time; 
the highest bidder when the clock runs out takes home the prize.
Reserve-price auctions
Unlike a minimum bid, which is required in any eBay auction, a reserve price 
protects sellers from having to sell an item for less than the minimum amount 
they want for it. You may be surprised to see a 1968 Jaguar XKE sports car 
up for auction on eBay with a minimum bid of only a dollar. It’s a fair bet 
that the seller has put a reserve price on this car to protect himself from 
losing money. The reserve price allows sellers to set lower minimum bids, 
and lower minimum bids attract bidders. Unfortunately, if a seller makes the 
reserve price too high and it isn’t met by the end of the auction, no one wins.
eBay charges a fee for sellers to run these auctions. Nobody knows (except the 
seller and the eBay computer system) what the reserve price is until the auc-
tion is over (assuming that the reserve price is met and that someone wins the 
auction), but you can tell from the auction page whether you’re dealing with a 
reserve-price auction. Reserve-price auctions are in the listings alongside the 
other items, so you have to click to find out whether it has a reserve. If bids have 
been made on an item, a message also appears on the page telling you if the 
reserve price hasn’t been met. You can find out more about bidding on reserve-
price auctions in Chapter 6 and setting up a reserve-price auction in Chapter 9.
Restricted-access auctions
If you’re over 18 years of age and interested in bidding on items of an adult 
nature, eBay has an Adults Only category, which has restricted access. 
Although you can peruse the other eBay categories without having to submit 
credit card information, you must have a credit card number on file on eBay 
to view and bid on items in this category. Restricted-access auctions are run 
like the typical timed auctions. To bid on adult items, you first need to agree 
to a terms of use page after entering your user ID and password. This page 
pops up automatically when you attempt to access this category.
 
If you aren’t interested in seeing or bidding on items of an adult nature, or if 
you’re worried that your children may be able to gain access to graphic adult 
material, eBay has solved that problem by excluding adult-content items from 
easily accessible areas such as the Featured Items page. And children under 
the age of 18 aren’t allowed to register on eBay and should be under an adult’s 
supervision if they do wander onto the site.

14
Part I: Getting a Feel for eBay 
Private (shhh-it’s-a-secret) listings
Some sellers choose to hold private listings because they know that some 
buyers may be embarrassed to be seen bidding on a box of racy neckties 
in front of the rest of the eBay community. Others may go the private route 
because they are selling big-ticket items and don’t want to disclose their bid-
der’s financial status.
Private auctions are run like the typical timed auctions except that each bid-
der’s identity is kept secret. At the end of the auction, eBay provides contact 
info to the seller and to the high bidder, and that’s it.
 
You can send e-mail questions to the seller in a private auction, but you can’t 
check out your competition because the item page will never show the high 
bidder’s user ID.
Buying It Now on eBay
You don’t have to participate in an auction on eBay to buy something. If you 
want to make a purchase — if it’s something you must have — you can usu-
ally find the item and buy it immediately. Of course, using Buy It Now (BIN 
in eBay speak) doesn’t come with the thrill of an auction, but purchasing an 
Charity auctions: All for a good cause
A charity auction is a high-profile fund-raising 
auction run by eBay Giving Works where the 
proceeds go to a selected charity. Most people 
don’t wake up in the morning wanting to own 
the shoes that Ron Howard wore when he put 
his footprints in cement at Mann’s Chinese 
Theater in Hollywood, but one-of-a-kind items 
like that often are auctioned off in charity auc-
tions. (In fact, someone did want those shoes 
badly enough to buy them for a lot of money on 
eBay.) Charity auctions became popular after 
the NBC Today Show sold an autographed 
jacket on eBay for over $11,000 with the pro-
ceeds going to Toys for Tots. Charity auctions 
are run like most other auctions on eBay, but 
because they’re immensely popular, bidding 
can be fierce, and the dollar amounts can go 
sky high. Many famous celebrities use eBay 
to help out their favorite charities. Billionaire 
Warren Buffet auctions a private lunch each 
year to support one of his favorite charities — 
in 2008 lunch for 8 with Warren went for over 
$2,110,100. I suggest that you visit these auc-
tions and bid whenever you can. Charity auc-
tions are a win-win situation for everyone. 
You can read more about celebrity auctions in 
Chapter 18.

item at a fraction of the retail price without leaving your chair or waiting for 
an auction to end has its own warm and fuzzy kind of excitement. If you seek 
this kind of instant gratification on eBay, visit eBay Stores. Or you can isolate 
these items by clicking the Buy It Now tab when browsing categories or per-
forming searches.
eBay Stores
Visiting eBay Stores is as easy as clicking the eBay Stores link from the home 
page. Thousands of eBay sellers have set up stores with merchandise meant 
for you to Buy It Now. eBay Stores are classified just like eBay, and you can 
buy anything from socks to jewelry to appliances.
Sellers who open an eBay Store have to meet a certain level of experience on 
eBay, and when you buy from an eBay Store, you’re protected by the same 
fraud protection policy that covers you in an eBay auction.
Buy It Now and fixed-price sales
More and more sellers are selling items with a Buy It Now option or at a fixed 
price. These features enable you to buy an item as soon as you see one at a 
price that suits you. For more on how these sales work, check out Chapter 6.
So You Wanna Sell Stuff
If you’re a seller, creating an auction page on eBay is as simple as filling out 
an online form. You type the name of your item and a short description, add 
a crisp digital picture, set your price, and voilà — it’s auction time. (Okay, 
it’s a tad more involved than that, but not much). eBay charges a small fee 
($0.05 (during promotions) to $4.00) for the privilege. When you list your 
item, millions of people (eBay has over 100 million registered users) from 
all over the world can take a gander at it and place bids. With a little luck, a 
bidding war may break out and drive the bids up high enough for you to turn 
a nice profit. After the auction, you deal directly with the buyer, who sends 
you the payment either through a payment service or through the mail. Then 
you ship the item. Abracadabra — you just turned your item (everyday clut-
ter, perhaps) into cash. You can run as many auctions as you want, all at the 
same time. To get info on deciding what to sell, leaf through Chapter 9; to 
find out how to set up an auction, jump to Chapter 10; and to get the scoop 
on advanced selling techniques, visit Chapter 14. When you’re ready to go 
pro, check out the appendix.

So You Wanna Buy Stuff
If you’re a collector or you just like to shop for bargains on everyday goods, 
you can browse 24 hours a day through the items up for auction in eBay’s tens 
of thousands of categories, which range from Antiques to Writing Instruments. 
Find the item you want, do a little research on what you’re buying and who’s 
selling it, place your bid, and keep an eye on it until the auction closes. When I 
wrote Santa Shops on eBay (Wiley), I had a great time visiting the different cat-
egories and buying a little something here and there — it’s amazing just how 
varied the selection is. I even bought some parts for my pool cleaner!
Take a look at Chapter 5 for info on searching for items to bid on. When you 
see an item you like, you can set up a bidding strategy and let the games 
begin. Chapter 6 gives you bidding strategies that can make you the winner. 
After you win your first auction, look for expert advice about completing the 
transaction in Chapter 8.
 
You can bid as many times as you want on an item, and you can bid on as 
many auctions as you want. Just keep in mind that each bid is a binding con-
tract that you are required to pay should you win.
Research for Fun and Profit
eBay’s awesome search engine allows you to browse through countless 
categories of items up for sale. As a buyer, you can do lots of comparison 
shopping on that special something you just can’t live without or just browse 
around until something catches your eye. If you’re a seller, the search engine 
allows you to keep your eye on the competition and get an idea of how hot 
your item is. That way, you can set a competitive price. To find out more 
about using search options and categories, check out Chapters 3 and 5.
The search engine also lets you find out what other people are bidding on. From 
there, you can read up on a seller’s feedback ratings (eBay’s ingenious honor 
system) to get a sense of the seller’s reputations — before you deal with them.
eBay’s Role in the Action
Throughout the auction process, eBay’s computers keep tabs on what’s going 
on. When the auction or sale is over, eBay takes a small percentage of the final 
selling price and instructs the seller and buyer to contact each other through 
e-mail. At this point, eBay’s job is pretty much over, and eBay steps aside.

 Chapter 1: Why You’re Going to Love Your Time on eBay
Most of the time, everything works great, everybody’s happy, and eBay never 
has to step back into the picture. But if you happen to run into trouble in 
paradise, eBay can help you settle the problem, whether you’re the buyer or 
the seller.
eBay regulates members with a detailed system of checks and balances 
known as feedback, which is described in Chapter 4. The grand plan is that 
the community polices itself. Don’t get me wrong — eBay does jump in when 
shady activity comes to light. But the people who keep eBay most safe are 
the community members, the buyers and sellers who have a common stake 
in conducting business honestly and fairly. Every time you sell something or 
win an auction, eBay members have a chance to leave a comment about you. 
You should do the same for them. If they’re happy, the feedback is positive; 
otherwise, the feedback is negative. Either way, your feedback sticks to you 
like glue.
Building a great reputation with positive feedback ensures a long and profit-
able eBay career. Negative feedback, like multiple convictions for grand-theft 
auto, is a real turnoff to most folks and can make it hard to do future business 
on eBay.
 
If your feedback rating becomes a –4 (negative 4), eBay suspends your buying 
and selling privileges. You can find out more about how eBay protects you as 
a buyer or a seller in Chapter 16.
Features and Fun Stuff
So eBay is all about making money, right? Not exactly. The folks at eBay 
aren’t kidding when they call it a community — a place where people with 
similar interests can compare notes, argue, buy, sell, and meet each other. 
Yes, people have married after meeting on eBay. (Take a guess how friends 
bought them wedding gifts!)
Chatting it up
eBay has dozens of specific chat rooms and discussion boards (even a Night 
Owl’s Nest — for those who can’t sleep) whose topics range from advertising 
to trading cards. So if you have no idea what that old Mobil gas station sign 
you found in your grandfather’s barn is worth, just post a message on the 
Advertising chat board. Somewhere out there is an expert with an answer for 
you. Your biggest problem is deciding whether to keep the sign or put it up 
for auction. Those are good problems to have! For more about posting mes-
sages and chat rooms, visit Chapters 5 and 17.

Part I: Getting a Feel for eBay 
Trust & Safety
Trust & Safety is the catchall resource for information and services about 
making deals on eBay safer — and for information on what to do if deals go 
sour. I don’t like to think about it, but sometimes — despite your best efforts 
to be a good eBay user — buyers or sellers don’t keep their word. In a small 
percentage of cases, unscrupulous louts invade the site and try to pull scams. 
You may buy an item that isn’t as it was described, or the winner of your 
auction doesn’t send payment. Sometimes even honest members get into 
disputes. Trust & Safety is an excellent resource when you need questions 
answered or you need a professional to come in and handle an out-of-hand 
situation. Chapter 16 tells you all about Trust & Safety.
Extra Gizmos You’re Gonna Want
At some point in your eBay career, you’ll become comfortable with all the 
computer-related hoops you have to jump through to make the eBay magic 
happen. At that time, you may be ready to invest in a few extra devices that 
can make your eBay experiences even better. Digital cameras and scanners 
can help make your time on eBay a more lucrative and fun adventure. You 
find out how to use digital technology in your auctions in more detail in 
Chapter 14.

Y
ou’ve probably figured out that you sign on to eBay electronically, 
which means you don’t really sign on the dotted line as folks did in days 
of old. Nowadays, the art of scrawling your signature has become as outdated 
as vinyl records (although you can still get very collectible vinyl records on 
eBay if you’re feeling nostalgic).
Compared to finding a parking space at a shopping center during the holi-
days, signing up for eBay is a snap. The toughest thing you have to do is type 
your e-mail address correctly (and, if you’re like me, that’s often a challenge).
In this chapter, you find out everything you need to know about registering 
on eBay. You get tips on what information you have to disclose and what you 
should keep to yourself. Don’t worry — this is an open-book test. You don’t 
need to memorize state capitals, the periodic table, or even multiplication 
tables. (Whew.)
Registering on eBay
You don’t have to wear one of those icky “Hello, My Name Is” stickers on 
your shirt after you sign on, but eBay needs to know some things about you 
before it grants you membership. You and millions of other folks will be 
roaming around eBay’s online treasure trove; eBay needs to know who’s who. 
So, keeping that in mind, sign in, please!

20
Part I: Getting a Feel for eBay 
You don’t have to be a rocket scientist to register on eBay, but you can buy 
a model rocket or something bigger after you do. The only hard-and-fast rule 
on eBay is that you must be 18 years of age or older. Don’t worry, the Age 
Police won’t come to your house to card you; they have other ways to dis-
creetly ensure that you’re at least 18 years old. (Hint: Credit cards do more 
than satisfy account charges.) If you’re having a momentary brain cramp and 
you’ve forgotten your age, but you can hum the theme to Speed Racer when 
you gun your car engine — you’re in. Or if you can remember watching the 
original episodes of that favorite show of the ’90s, you’re in. Head to the eBay 
home page and register. The entire process takes only a few minutes.
Registering Is Free, Fun, and Fast
Before you can sign up for some fun on eBay, you have to be connected 
to the Web. This is the time to fire up your computer and connect to the 
Internet. After you open your Internet browser, you’re ready to sign up.
Just type www.ebay.com in the address box of your browser and press Enter. 
Your next stop is the eBay home page. Right there, where you can’t miss it, is 
the Register button (look for the big red button, as you can see in Figure 2-1). 
Click the button and let the sign-up process begin. See Chapter 3 for details.
 
The eBay home page changes all the time. If you don’t see a Register button, 
look around the page — a Register button or link is there somewhere.
Here’s an overview of how easy it is to register:
 
1. Enter the basic required info.
 
2. Read and accept the User Agreement.
 
3. Confirm your e-mail address.
 
4. Breeze through (or past) the optional information.
The following sections fill you in on all the details.
The Registration pages on eBay are through a secure SSL connection. SSL 
(Secure Sockets Layer) enables you to have an encrypted connection to eBay 
because a bunch of really smart techie types made it that way. You can tell 
you’re on an SSL connection because the normal http at the beginning of the 
Web address (also called the URL) is now https. Also, you’ll see a small closed 
lock at the bottom-left (or bottom-right) corner of your screen. I could tell 
you how SSL works, but instead I’ll just give you the bottom line: It does work, 
so trust me and use it. The more precautions eBay (and you) take, the harder 
it is for some hypercaffeinated high-school kid to get into your files.

21
 Chapter 2: Ready, Set, Go: Signing Up on eBay
When you’re at the Registration form, you go through a four-step process.
 
Figure 2-1: 
Click the 
Register 
button, and 
soon you’ll 
be trading 
online like a 
pro!
 
Like, what’s your sign? Filling 
in required information
After you click the Register button, you’re taken to the heart of the eBay 
Registration pages. You may register as a business or as an individual; I regis-
tered as an individual (even though I run a business on eBay). So if you don’t 
quite have a business up and running, register simply as an individual. To get 
started, follow these steps:
 
1. At the top of the first registration page, after eBay shows the steps of 
the registration process, fill in some required information.
 
 Here’s what eBay wants to know about you:
 
• Your full name, address, and primary telephone number. eBay 
keeps this information on file in case the company (or a member 
who is a transaction partner) needs to contact you.
 
• Your e-mail address (yourname@myISP.com).

22
Part I: Getting a Feel for eBay 
 
 If you register with an anonymous e-mail service such as Yahoo! Mail, 
Gmail, or Hotmail, you’re taken to a page that requires additional infor-
mation for authentication. It wouldn’t surprise me if eBay will be ran-
domly authorizing all new members by requiring a credit card. (This is 
for your safety.) You must provide valid credit card information for iden-
tification purposes. Your information is protected by eBay’s privacy 
policy, and your credit card won’t be charged.
 
 After you input your personal information, you’re ready to create your 
eBay persona.
 
2. Scroll down the page to select your new eBay user ID.
 
 See “A Not-So-Quick Word about Choosing a User ID,” later in this chap-
ter, for some tips on selecting your user ID.
 
 Because many of the “good” user IDs are taken, eBay supplies a link on 
the registration form to check on the availability of your preferred ID. (I 
found a pretty good one in Figure 2-2. If your chosen name is taken, try 
again. (Lather, rinse, repeat). Finding an awesome user ID can be as diffi-
cult as finding an untaken vanity plate at the California DMV.
 
Figure 2-2: 
Type your 
proposed 
user ID and 
check if it’s 
available.
 
 
3. Choose a password, enter it in the Create Your Password box, and 
then type it a second time in the Re-enter Your Password box to con-
firm it.
 
 For more information on choosing a password, see “A Quick Word about 
Passwords,” later in this chapter.
 
4. Create your unique secret question and input the answer.
 
 The secret question you select here is used by eBay to identify you if 
you ever have problems signing in.

23
 Chapter 2: Ready, Set, Go: Signing Up on eBay
 
5. If eBay requires your credit card information (for identification that 
you’re a real person), it will ask on the next screen.
 
6. Type your date of birth and fill in the Verification code.
 
7. Make sure all the info you entered is correct.
 
 Think back to your second-grade teacher, who kept saying, “Class, check 
your work.” Remember that? She’s still right! Review your answers.
 
8. Indicate that you agree to eBay’s Terms and Policies.
 
 You can find more information on this agreement later in the chapter.
 
9. Click the Register button to move on to the next screen.
 
 (If you’ve made a mistake, eBay gives you the opportunity to correct the 
information by using the Edit Information button).
 
 If eBay finds a glitch in your registration, such as an incorrect area or zip 
code, you see a warning message. This is part of eBay’s security system 
to ward off fraudulent registrations. Use the Back button to correct the 
information — if you put in a wrong e-mail address, for example, eBay 
has no way of contacting you, so you don’t hear a peep from eBay 
regarding your registration until you go through the entire process all 
over again.
If you registered with an anonymous e-mail service, such as Yahoo! Mail or 
Hotmail, you must enter your credit card information, as I mentioned earlier, 
before you see the license agreement, which I cover in the next section. If, 
when you look at it, your eyes start glazing over at all the legalese, the next 
section can help you make sense of it.
Do you solemnly swear to . . . ?
During the registration you’ll be asked to check the boxes that say you agree 
to the eBay User Agreement and Privacy Policy. At this point, you take an 
oath to keep eBay safe for democracy and commerce. You promise to play 
well with others, not to cheat, and to follow the Golden Rule. No, you’re not 
auditioning for a superhero club, but don’t ever forget that eBay takes this 
stuff very seriously. You can be kicked off eBay or worse. (Can you say “fed-
eral investigation”?)
Be sure to read the User Agreement thoroughly when you register. So that 
you don’t have to put down this riveting book to read the legalese right this 
minute, I provide the nuts and bolts here:

24
Part I: Getting a Feel for eBay 
 
✓ You understand that every transaction is a legally binding contract. 
(Click the User Agreement link at the bottom of any eBay page for the 
current eBay Rules and Regulations.)
 
✓ You agree that you can pay for the items you buy and the eBay fees that 
you incur. (Chapter 8 fills you in on how eBay takes its cut of the auction 
action.)
 
✓ You understand that you’re responsible for paying any taxes.
 
✓ You’re aware that if you sell prohibited items, eBay can forward your 
personal information to law enforcement for further investigation. 
(Chapter 9 explains what you can and can’t sell on eBay — and what 
eBay does to sellers of prohibited items.)
 
✓ eBay makes clear that it is just a venue, which means it’s a place where 
people with similar interests can meet, greet, and do business.
When everything goes well, the eBay Web site is like a school gym that opens 
for Saturday swap meets. At the gym, if you don’t play by the rules, you can 
get tossed out. But if you don’t play by the rules on eBay, the venue gets 
un-gymlike in a hurry. eBay has the right to get state and federal officials to 
track you down and prosecute you. But fair’s fair; if you click the appropriate 
box on this page, eBay keeps you posted by e-mail of any updates in the User 
Agreement.
If you’re a stickler for fine print, click the links provided on the registration 
page for all the Ps and Qs of the latest policies. The User Agreement is vital to 
your success on eBay.
Before you can proceed, you must click the two check boxes, indicating that 
you really, really understand what it means to be an eBay user. Because I 
know that you, as a law-abiding eBay member, will have no problem following 
the rules, go ahead and click the I Agree to These Terms button at the bottom 
of the page. You’re transported to a screen stating that eBay is sending you 
an e-mail. You’re almost done.
The next step is confirming your e-mail address, which I cover in the next 
section.
It must be true if you have it in writing
After you accept the User Agreement and Privacy Policy, eBay takes less than 
a minute to e-mail you an activation notice. When you receive the eBay reg-
istration activation e-mail, be sure to print it, and don’t delete the e-mail — 
save it somewhere special.

25
 Chapter 2: Ready, Set, Go: Signing Up on eBay
With your confirmation number in hand, head back to the eBay Registration 
page by clicking the link supplied in your e-mail. If your e-mail doesn’t sup-
port links, go to this address:
cgi4.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?RegisterConfirmCode
After you reconnect with eBay and it knows your e-mail address is genuine, 
you’ll be heartily congratulated with an eBay e-mail. It’s time to start shopping!
 
If you don’t receive your eBay registration confirmation e-mail within 24 
hours, there was most likely an error in your e-mail address. At this point, the 
customer-support folks can help you complete the registration process. Try 
visiting the Contact Us link on the eBay home page. They are always happy to 
help.
 
If for some reason (even a late night watching the 24 marathon is a perfectly 
acceptable excuse) you incorrectly type the wrong e-mail address, you have 
to start the registration process all over again with a different user ID (eBay 
holds the previous ID for 30 days). If you run into a snag, you can click the 
Contact Us button to reach Live Help. See Figure 2-3 for one of my previous 
Live Help discussions.

Getting to know you: Optional information
When you’re a full-fledged, officially registered member of the eBay commu-
nity, you may see an eBay pop-up window, giving you the option to provide 
more information about yourself. These optional questions allow you to fill in 
your self-portrait for your new pals from eBay.

26
Part I: Getting a Feel for eBay 
 
Although eBay doesn’t share member information with anyone, you don’t 
have to answer the optional questions if you don’t want to.
The following points show you the optional questions eBay asks. You decide 
what you feel comfortable divulging and what you want to keep personal. 
eBay asks for this information because the company wants a better picture 
of who is using its Web site. In marketing mumbo-jumbo, this stuff is called 
demographics — statistics that characterize a group of people who make up a 
community. In this case, it’s the eBay community. Here is the optional infor-
mation you can provide:
 
✓ Gender: This first choice gets right down to the basics; some people 
find it a good test of whether the requests for information seem too per-
sonal. (eBay will no doubt figure it out anyway when they see what items 
you search the site for!)
 
✓ Annual household income: Fill this in if you want to (eBay states that 
this info is kept anonymous), but I think this information is too personal. 
If you’re not comfortable with providing it, skip it.
 
✓ Your highest completed education level: Again if this is too personal, 
leave this area blank.
After selecting your responses from the drop-down box, you can click 
Submit. If you’re not in the mood right now, you can click the Answer Later 
link. (This pop-up box reappears for your response later in your eBay deal-
ings.) If you don’t want to answer any demographic queries, click the Please 
Don’t Ask Me Again link at the bottom of the pop-up window.
 
If somebody you’re in a transaction with requests your info, you get an e-mail 
from eBay giving you the name, phone number, city, and state of the person 
making the request. Keep your information up-to-date. If you don’t, you risk 
being ejected from the site. See Chapter 15 for details.
A Quick Word about Passwords
Choosing a good password is not as easy (but is twice as important) as it 
may seem. Whoever has your password can (in effect) “be you” on eBay — 
running sales, bidding on auctions, and leaving possibly litigious feedback for 
others. Basically, such an impostor can ruin your eBay career and possibly 
cause you serious financial grief.

27
 Chapter 2: Ready, Set, Go: Signing Up on eBay
 
As with any online password, you should follow these rules to protect your 
privacy:
 
✓ Don’t choose an obvious password, such as your birthday, your first 
name, or (especially!) your Social Security number. (Hint: If it’s too easy 
to remember, it’s probably too easy to crack.)
 
✓ Make things tough on the bad guys — combine numbers and letters (use 
uppercase and lowercase) or create nonsensical words.
 
✓ Don’t give out your password to anyone — it’s like giving away the keys 
to the front door of your house.
 
✓ If you ever suspect that someone has your password, immediately 
change it by going to the following address:
https://scgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ForgotYourPasswordShow
 
✓ Change your password every few months just to be on the safe side.
 
✓ Don’t use the same password for eBay and PayPal.
A Not-So-Quick Word about 
Choosing a User ID
eBay gives you the option of picking your user ID. Making up a user ID is my 
favorite part. If you’ve never liked your real name (or never had a nickname), 
here’s your chance to correct that situation. Have fun. Consider choosing an 
ID that tells a little about you. Of course, if your interests change, you may 
regret having too narrow a user ID.
You can call yourself just about anything; you can be silly or creative or 
boring. But remember, this ID is how other eBay users will know you. So here 
are some commonsense rules:
 
✓ Don’t use a name that would embarrass your mother.
 
✓ Don’t use a name with a negative connotation, such as scam-guy.
 
✓ Don’t use a name that’s too weird. If people don’t trust you, they won’t 
buy from you.
 
✓ eBay doesn’t allow spaces in user IDs, so make sure that the ID makes 
sense when putting two or more words together.
 
If you’re dying to have several short words as your user ID, you can use under-
scores or hyphens to separate them, as in super-shop-a-holic. If you sign in to 

28
Part I: Getting a Feel for eBay 
eBay once a day on your computer, typing underscores or dashes won’t slow 
you down.
 
You can change your user ID once every 30 days if you want to, but I don’t rec-
ommend it. People come to know you by your user ID. If you change your ID, 
your past does play tagalong and attaches itself to the new ID. But if you 
change your user ID too many times, people may think you’re trying to hide 
something.
Nevertheless, to change your user ID, click the My eBay link at the top of 
most eBay pages. From your My eBay login page, click the Preferences/Set-up 
tab and scroll to the Change My User ID link, fill in the boxes, and click the 
Change User ID button. You now have a new eBay identity.
eBay also has some user ID rules to live by:
 
✓ No offensive names (like &*#@@guy).
 
✓ No names with eBay in them. (It makes you look like you work for eBay, 
and eBay takes a dim view of that.)
 
✓ No names with & (even if you do have both looks&brains).
 
✓ No names with @ (like @Aboy).
 
✓ No symbols such as the greater than or less than symbols (> <) or con-
secutive underscores _ _.
 
✓ No IDs that begin with an e followed by numbers, an underscore, a dash, 
a period, or a dot.
 
✓ No names of one letter (such as Q).
 
When you choose your user ID, make sure that it isn’t a good clue for your 
password. For example, if you use Natasha as your user ID, don’t choose Boris 
as your password. Even Bullwinkle could figure that one out.
 
Hey, AOL users, this one’s for you: Make sure that your Mail Controls are set 
to receive e-mails from eBay. If you have Internet e-mail blocked, you need to 
update your AOL Mail Controls. To do so, enter the AOL keyword Mail 
Controls.

Your License to Deal (Almost)
You are now officially a newbie, or eBay rookie. The only problem is that 
you’re still at the window-shopping level. If you’re ready to go from window-
shopper to item seller, just zip through a few more forms, and before you 
know it, you can start running your own auctions on eBay.
 
Until you’ve been a member of eBay for 30 days, a picture of a beaming golden 
cartoonlike icon shows up next to your user ID wherever it appears on the 
site. This doesn’t mean that you have been converted into a golden robot; the 
icon merely indicates to other eBay users that you are new to eBay.
The craze that began with AW
Back in 1994, when eBay founder Pierre Omidyar 
had the idea to start a Web auction, he named 
his first venture Auction Web. The following 
figure shows a vintage Auction Web Internet 
auction that I won in February 1997. There were 
some great deals even in those days!

You Can Go Home — Again 
and Again!
In This Chapter
▶ Getting the lay of the land
▶ Using the eBay home page’s links and icons
▶ Perusing the categories
▶ Finding out about eBay’s worldwide reach
▶ Checking out featured auctions and other fun stuff
I
 hate to say it, but the famous writer Thomas Wolfe was wrong; the title 
of this chapter is true! You can go home again. At least on eBay! I visit 
the eBay home page on a regular basis; it’s a place where I can keep up with 
eBay’s newest offerings. Month after month, millions of people (just like us) 
land on eBay’s home page without wearing out the welcome mat (probably 
because they are wearing their bunny slippers). The eBay home page is the 
front door to the most popular auction site on the Internet.
Everything you need to know about navigating eBay begins right here. In this 
chapter, I give you the grand tour of the areas you can reach right from the 
home page with the help of links.
What Is the Home Page?
The eBay home page is shown in Figure 3-1 and includes the following key 
areas:
 
✓ A navigation bar at the top of the page with five eBay links that can zip 
you straight to any of the many eBay areas, as well as two additional — 
and powerful — links right below the navigation bar.

32
Part I: Getting a Feel for eBay 
 
✓ A search box that helps you find items by title keywords as well as a link 
to eBay’s Advanced Search page.
 
✓ A list of links to the most popular auction categories.
 
✓ A link box that takes you directly to a drop-down menu of a complete 
listing of top-level categories, a direct link to eBay Motors and eBay 
Stores.
 
✓ Links to eBay’s Deals of the Day, featured items, fun stuff such as charity 
auctions, and information about what else is moving on eBay.
 
Figure 3-1:

point for fun, 
profit, and

Do not adjust your computer monitor. You’re not going crazy. Today you may 
notice that a link that was on the eBay home page a minute ago is gone. That’s 
normal. The links on the eBay home page change often to reflect what’s going 
on — not just on the site, but in the world as well.

Sign In is possibly the most powerful of all the links on the eBay pages, and 
it should be your first stop if you plan on doing any business on the site (see 
Figure 3-2).

If you use the link to go to the Sign In page and then sign in, you don’t have to

You can search for items on eBay without signing in, but what fun is that? If 
you haven’t registered with eBay, you’re pretty much out of luck if you find a 
great deal on a lamp that’s just what you’ve been looking for — and the auc-
tion closes in 5 minutes!
If you’re the only one who uses your computer, be sure to select the box 
that says Keep Me Signed in For Today. This way, you’re always signed in 
to eBay every time you go to the site during the next 24 hours. The Sign In 
process places a cookie (a technical thingy — see Chapter 15 for details) on 
your computer that remains a part of your computer for the rest of the day. 

34
Part I: Getting a Feel for eBay 
If you don’t select the box, you will be signed in only while your browser is 
open. After you close your browser the cookie expires, and you have to sign 
in again.
Here’s how to get to the eBay Sign In page and sign in:
 
1. Click the Sign In link at the top of any eBay page.
 
 At the bottom of the new page that appears is a Secure Sign In page. The 
logo indicates that your personal information is even more secure than 
usual. (See Chapter 2 for details about SSL.)
 
2. Enter your user ID and password.
 
3. Select the Sign Me In for Today box if you’re not at a public computer.
You’re now signed in to eBay and can travel and transact on the site with 
ease. You can enter your My eBay page by clicking the My eBay link that 
appears in the navigation bar. (See Chapter 4 for more on My eBay.)
This Bar Never Closes
As mentioned, the navigation bar is at the top of the eBay home page and lists 
five eBay links that take you directly to different eBay areas. Using the naviga-
tion bar is kind of like doing one-stop clicking. You can find this bar at the top 
of every page you visit on eBay. No matter where you are on the site, when 
you click one of the five links you go straight to a related page.
 
Below the navigation bar is the Sign In/Sign Out link. This link, which toggles 
between Sign In and Sign Out depending on your sign-in status, is important, 
and I remind you about it throughout this book.
 
Think of links as expressways to specific destinations. Click a link just once, 
and the next thing you know, you’re right where you want to be. You don’t 
even have to answer that proverbial annoying question, “When are we gonna 
get there?” from the noisy kids in the backseat.
Here, without further ado, are the five navigation-bar boxes and where they 
take you:
 
✓ Buy: Takes you to the page that lists Featured Items (see Chapter 6), all 
the main eBay categories, as well as links to popular stores and eBay 
promotions that vary from time to time. If you’re signed in, there is also 
a link to your favorite searches and sellers. From this page, you can link 
to any one of the millions of items up for auction on eBay.

35
 Chapter 3: You Can Go Home — Again and Again!
 
 On the Buy page, you find links to browse by categories, keywords, or 
stores. If you scroll to the very bottom of the page, you find the Artist 
Pages. There you can click the Music, Movies, or Books links to search 
for your favorite artists’ items quickly (see Figure 3-3). If you want to 
find your favorite artists’ pages even more quickly, go to http://
artist-index.ebay.com. On this page, they’re ranked by their stand-
ing in eBay’s Top Sellers.
 
Figure 3-3: 
Nice to see 
that Beatles 
(The) are 
still in the 
#5 slot on 
the eBay 
Bestselling 
Artists page.
 
 
 When you click a link to browse a category (for example, Books: 
Antiquarian & Collectible), you see some tabs above the listings. These 
tabs offer you ways to search, and each tab gives you a different viewing 
option to browse:
 
• All Items is the default setting for the page. This option delivers on 
its promise — you see all items, including those up for auction and 
Buy It Now items.
 
• Click Auctions Only in the tabs area to be taken to eBay’s version 
of an auction catalog.
 
• Click the Buy It Now Only tab to see all items in the category that 
you can buy immediately if you don’t want to wait for an auction 
to end.

36
Part I: Getting a Feel for eBay 
 
 Note that not all sellers list their items in the Auctions area (at this 
moment only 55,000 of the 120,000 items in this category are auc-
tions), so by not browsing All Items, you may be missing out on 
some special items or deals.
 
 Browse Categories. Clicking takes you to a list of all categories 
and the first level subcategories. What’s even more fun is that you 
get to see the listing counts, as shown in Figure 3-4.

• Help with Buying and Bidding: What can I say, you bought this 
book and I can guarantee that I’ve bought more on eBay than 
almost any eBay employee. Just jump over to Chapter 6 for the 
lowdown.
 
• Buyer Tools: Hmmm, the only buyer tools I’m interested in are a 
credit card and my PayPal account. Keep in mind that anything you 
download to your computer will track you. Free tools are not writ-
ten out of the goodness of a company’s heart; they’re written to sign 
people up, get data, and then sell such data at a profit. Get it?
 
• Reviews & Guides: Here’s where you can participate in the eBay 
community by writing guides and reviewing products. If you’re 
here to make money, perhaps you might be better spending your 
time honing your sales skills and selling items. There’s more on 
this area of eBay in Chapter 17.

37
 Chapter 3: You Can Go Home — Again and Again!
 
• eBay Mobile: You want eBay to call you on your cell phone? They 
will do it for a fee. It’s free to check your eBay listings on a Web-
enabled cell phone by going to m.ebay.com.
 
 Keep in mind that all informational links provided to you by eBay in 
these drop-down menus are just that: from eBay. They may be influ-
enced by advertising deals, alliances with providers . . . get the drift? Do 
not ever consider the information you get as unbiased. This book is 
unbiased — I have no sponsors or advertisers to please.
 
 The drop-down menus are often more helpful in getting you where you 
want to go. The drop-down menu that appears as you mouse over the 
Buy button gives you these offerings:
 
✓ Sell: Takes you to the start of the Sell Your Item form, which you must 
fill out to start your sale. I explain how to navigate this form in Chapter 
9. The links at the bottom of the page direct you to various Seller 
Guides. The Sell drop-down menu also gives you these options through 
convenient links:
 
• Sell an Item: Here’s your direct link to the Sell Item form. Try to 
remember to click here directly when you want to list an item for 
sale — one step is easier than two, especially when the first step 
has promotional information.
 
• Selling Tips: Let’s just say that whoever wrote these tips read an 
earlier edition of this book.
 
• What’s Hot: This connects you to eBay Pulse (pulse.ebay.com), 
shown in Figure 3-5. It’s a fun area that lets you view (by category 
if you want) the most popular searches on eBay. One caveat: Just 
because an item is hot doesn’t mean you can get your hands on it 
or even want to sell that particular item. (I know a high-level eBay 
seller who sells brake pads, which are not my cup of tea.) Use this 
information as a market gauge rather than the gospel.
 
• Seller Tools & eBay Stores: Here’s a quick link to the tools eBay 
offers, such as Selling Manager (more on that in Chapter 4). Take 
my advice and follow my lead in this book; don’t subscribe to any 
of these tools until you’re ready. They will just drain your wallet.
 
• Shipping Center: This link takes you to eBay’s Shipping Center, 
which is a handy way to get to the Shipping Calculator. There are 
plenty of other links, and because UPS and the USPS are “partners” 
with eBay, you won’t find info on my favorite ground shipper, 
FedEx Ground. See the chapter on shipping to get the full picture 
of who you should ship with.

✓ My eBay: Takes you to your personal My eBay page, where you keep 
track of all your buying and selling activities, account information, 
and favorite categories (there’s more about My eBay in Chapter 4). A 
drop-down menu takes you to the various areas on your My eBay page. 
Chapter 4 gives you information on all these links.
 
✓ Community: Takes you to a page where you can find the latest news and 
announcements, chat with fellow traders in the eBay community, find 
charity auctions, and find out more about eBay. (Chapters 17 and 18 tell 
you how to use these resources.)
 
✓ Help: Takes you to one of the most valuable areas of the eBay site. The 
Help area can give you answers to many of your questions, as well as 
keep you apprised of eBay’s rules and regulations regarding trading 
on the site. The eBay Help Center overview page consists of a search 
box, where you can type your query, links for help topics, an A–Z index, 
and a list of the top five questions on eBay. The page offers links to the 
answers to the questions most frequently asked by eBay users and to 
the Security & Resolution Center.
At the top of the eBay home page, below the navigation bar, you find several 
powerful links that are just as important as the links on the navigation bar:

39
 Chapter 3: You Can Go Home — Again and Again!
 
✓ eBay Logo: Click the eBay logo and it takes you right back to the home 
page. Use this link from any other page when you need to get back to the 
home page right away.
 
✓ Contact Us: Clicking here, you’ll have to sign in (which is not helpful 
when you have a problem such as a hijacked account), but the resulting 
page lets you into eBay through a bold link that says I’m a Guest. Click 
there. You will then be taken to the Contact Us page. (For more on con-
tacting eBay, see Chapter 16.)
 
✓ Register: Click here to become a member of the eBay community. If 
you haven’t registered, turn to Chapter 2 to get the quick and painless 
facts about the easy eBay registration process. (If you’re signed in, the 
Register link isn’t visible.)
 
✓ Site Map: Provides you with a bird’s-eye view of the eBay world. Every 
top-level (that is, main) link available on eBay is listed here. If you’re 
ever confused about finding a specific area, try the Site Map first. If a 
top-level link isn’t listed here, it’s not on eBay — yet.
Exploring Your Home Page 
Search Options
An old Chinese expression says, “Every journey begins with the first eBay 
search.” Okay, I updated the quote, but wise words nonetheless. You can 
start a search from the home page in one of two ways:
 
✓ Use the search text box: It’s right there at the top of the home page, 
with the Search button next to it. It’s a fast way of finding item listings.
 
✓ Use the Advanced Search link next to the search box on the home 
page: These links take you to the Advanced Search page, where you can 
do all kinds of specialized searches.
Both options can give you the same results. The instructions I offer in the 
next two sections about using these search methods are just the tip of the 
eBay iceberg. For the inside track on how to finesse the eBay search engine 
to root out just what you’re looking for, visit Chapter 5.

40
Part I: Getting a Feel for eBay 
Peering through the home page search box
To launch a title search from the home page, follow these steps:
 
1. In the search box, type no more than a few keywords that describe the 
item you’re looking for.
 
 Refer to Figure 3-1 to see the search box.
 
2. Click the Search button.
 
 The results of your search appear on-screen in a matter of seconds.
You can type just about anything in this box and get some information. Say 
you’re looking for Star Trek memorabilia. If so, you’re not alone. The televi-
sion show premiered on September 8, 1966, and even though it was canceled 
in 1969 because of low ratings, Star Trek became one of the most successful 
science-fiction franchises in history. A new Star Trek film came out this year! 
If you like Star Trek as much as I do, you can use the search box on the eBay 
home page to find all sorts of Star Trek stuff. I just ran a search and found 
18,047 items — in hundreds of categories — with Star Trek in their titles 
(your results will probably vary).
Try the Advanced Search link next to the search box to narrow your search. 
This link takes you to the Advanced Search: Find Items page, which is 
explained in the following section.
 
When you search for popular items on eBay (and a classic example is Star Trek 
memorabilia), you may get inundated with thousands of listings that match 
your search criteria. Even if you’re traveling at warp speed, you could spend 
hours checking each auction individually. (“Scotty, we need more power 
now!”) If you’re pressed for time like the rest of us, eBay has not-so-mysterious 
ways to narrow your search so finding a specific item is much more manage-
able. Turn to Chapter 5 for insider techniques that can help you slim those 
searches and beef up those results.
Going where the Advanced Search 
link takes you
One of the most important buttons on the eBay page is the Advanced Search 
link. When you click this link, you’re whisked away to the Advanced Search 
page, which promptly presents you with several search options. Each option 
enables you to search for information in a different way. Here’s how the 
search options on the menu can work for you:

41
 Chapter 3: You Can Go Home — Again and Again!
 
✓ Find Items: Search by keywords, item number, in eBay Motors, or by 
an individual seller or bidder. Type the keywords that describe an item 
(for example, Superman lunchbox or antique pocket watch) and click 
Search, and you can see how many are available on eBay. The site gives 
you the option to search by one of the main categories — but to get the 
largest number of items, use All Categories and narrow your search from 
the results.
 
 Another handy way to search is by item number. Every item that’s up for 
sale on eBay is assigned an item number, which is displayed next to the 
item name on its page. To find an item by number, just type the number 
in the box, click Search, and away you go. (To find out more about how 
individual sales pages work on eBay, spin through Chapter 6.)
 
 You can also find items by number if you type the item number into any 
of the small search boxes that appear on eBay pages.
 
✓ Sort Your Searches: Here you can sort your searches in three ways.
 
✓ Advanced Search drop-down menu: By clicking this link, you can define 
your search without using a bunch of code. It works pretty much the 
same as the basic Search method, but you can exclude more features 
from your search. You can also take advantage of eBay’s regional trad-
ing and find items for sale in your neighborhood. Figure 3-6 shows the 
Advanced Search options.
 
Figure 3-6:
 The 
Advanced 
Search 
page and its 
options.
 

42
Part I: Getting a Feel for eBay 
 
The search by category filter is a snappy search function that helps you figure 
out which subcategories have the item you want — or, if you want to sell, 
helps you decide where to list your item for sale. It produces a regular search 
in a selected category but also has a column on the left side of the page that 
lets you know which subcategories your item is listed in — and how many of 
the item you’ll see listed in each category.
 
To find an item that sold on eBay in the past, indicate that you want to use the 
Completed Listings search. Then type the keywords of an item, and you get a 
list of items of this type that have been sold in the last 14 (or so) days, as well 
as what they sold for. You can use this type of search to strategize your asking 
price before you put an item up for auction (or to determine how much you’ll 
have to bid to win an item).
Although Chapter 5 tells you all you need to know about searching eBay, the 
following list explains some other searches you can perform from the Search 
page. In a nutshell, here’s what they do:
 
✓ Items By Seller: Every person on eBay has a personal user ID (the name 
you use to conduct transactions). Use a By Seller search if you liked the 
merchandise from a seller’s auction and want to see what else the seller 
has for sale. Type the seller’s user ID, and you get a list of every auction 
that person is running.
 
✓ Items By Bidder: For the sake of practicality and convenience, user IDs 
help eBay keep track of every move a user makes on eBay. If you want to 
see what a particular user (say, a fellow Star Trek fan) is bidding on, use 
the Items By Bidder search. Type a user ID in the Items By Bidder search 
box, and you get a list of everything the user is currently bidding on, 
as well as how much he or she is bidding. (I show you how to use this 
search option as a strategic buying tool in Chapter 6.)
 
✓ Stores Search: Here’s something I bet you didn’t know. When you use 
eBay’s search engine, it searches eBay Stores for matching items but 
only secondarily. (I think that’s a bunch of malarkey, but who am I?) If 
you search for your item here, you’ll see whether any matching items 
are available in eBay Stores (perhaps even at lower prices).
 
 If you’re looking for a particular eBay store, eBay provides a search box 
that allows you to search for a store by name (or part of the name).
Home Links, the Next Generation
If you look carefully, you can see that the home page has several other links 
that give you express service to key parts of the site. Here are the highlights:

43
 Chapter 3: You Can Go Home — Again and Again!
 
✓ My Recent Activities: If you’ve been browsing around the site and then 
return to the home page, you see a box with images of items you’ve 
looked at in past history. (See? I told you your travels on the site are 
tracked.)
 
✓ From Our Sellers: Visit the featured items. (Translation: Sellers paid 
more to have them featured in this section.)
 
✓ More eBay Sites: This box is full of links that take you to more eBay-
owned sites, such as Half.com, Kijiji, PayPal, ProStores, Rent.com, 
Shopping.com, Skype, StubHub, and StumbleUpon. (More on these sites 
throughout the book.)
 
✓ Global Sites: Use these links to visit eBay’s international auction sites. A 
quick and easy way to shop the world.
 
You may notice that the graphic links on the home page change from day to 
day — even hour to hour. If you’re interested in the featured areas of the site, 
visit this page several times a day to see the entire array of special happenings 
on eBay.
Maneuvering through Categories
So how does eBay keep track of the millions of items that are up for sale at 
any given moment? The brilliant minds at eBay decided to group items into 
a nice, neat little storage system called categories. The home page lists most 
of the main categories, but currently eBay lists tens of thousands of subcat-
egories — ranging from Antiques to Writing Instruments. And don’t ask how 
many subsubcategories (categories within categories) eBay has — I can’t 
count that high.
Well, okay, I could list all the categories and subcategories currently available 
on eBay — if you wouldn’t mind squinting at a dozen pages of really small, eye-
burning text. But a category browse is an adventure that’s unique for each indi-
vidual, and I wouldn’t think of depriving you of it. Suffice it to say that if you 
like to hunt for that perfect something, you’re in browsing heaven now.
Here’s how to navigate around the categories:
 
1. Click the category that interests you, such as Books or DVDs & Movies.
 
 You’re transported to the category’s page. You see categories and sub-
categories listed next to each heading. Happy hunting.

44
Part I: Getting a Feel for eBay 
 
 If you don’t find a category that interests you among those on the home 
page, simply click the Buy button on the navigation bar, and you’re off 
to the main categories page. Not only do you get a pretty impressive 
page of main categories and subcategories, but you also get a short list 
of featured auctions and a link to them all.
 
 If you really and truly want to see a list of all the categories and subcat-
egories, click the Categories on the Home page (rather than using the 
drop-down menu). Alternatively you can go to listings.ebay.com/
ListingCategoryList.
 
2. After the category page appears, find a subcategory below the main 
category title that interests you. Click the subcategory, and keep dig-
ging through the subsubcategories until you find what you want.
 
 For example, if you’re looking for items honoring your favorite televi-
sion show, click the Entertainment Memorabilia category. The page 
that comes up includes the subcategories of the category. You’ll notice 
that the Entertainment Memorabilia category has many links, includ-
ing the Television Memorabilia subcategory. If you look under the TV 
Memorabilia subcategory head, you’ll see links to various subsubcatego-
ries that include Ads, Flyers, Clippings, Photos, Pins, Buttons, Posters, 
Press Kits, Props, Scripts, Wardrobe, and Other. At the bottom of that 
page, below the links, you also find a link to See all featured items. Click 
any link to see the listings in the categories. Little icons (pictures) next 
to the listings tell you more about each item — whether it’s pictured 
(the camera) and whether it’s a new item (the sunrise). You can also 
click the tabs to isolate Auctions only or Buy It Now items.
 
 By the way, I have lots more to say about featured items in Chapter 10.
 
3. When you find an item that interests you, click the item, and the full 
Auction page pops up on your screen.
 
 Congratulations — you’ve just navigated through several million items 
to find that one TV-collectible item that caught your attention. (Pardon 
me while I bid on that Lily Munster/Yvonne DeCarlo–signed picture.) 
You can instantly return to the home page by clicking its link at the top 
of the page (or return to the Listings page by repeatedly clicking the 
Back button at the top of your browser).
 
Near the bottom of every subcategory page, you can see a link list of numbers. 
The numbers are page numbers, and you can use them to fast-forward through 
all the items in that subcategory. So, if you feel like browsing around page 8, 
without going through 8 pages individually, just click number 8; you’re pre-
sented with the items on that page (their listings, actually). Happy browsing.

45
 Chapter 3: You Can Go Home — Again and Again!
 
If you’re a bargain hunter by habit, you may find some pretty weird stuff while 
browsing the categories and subcategories of items on eBay — some of it 
super-cheap and some of it (maybe) just cheap. (There’s even a Weird Stuff 
category — no kidding!) Remember that (as with any marketplace) you’re 
responsible for finding out as much as possible about an item before you buy 
and definitely before you bid. So, if you’re the type who sometimes can’t resist 
a good deal, ask yourself what you plan to do with the pile of garbage you can 
get for 15 cents — and ask yourself now, before it arrives on your doorstep. 
Chapters 6 and 7 offer more information on savvy bidding.
Going Global
Listed below the Categories list are links to eBay’s international auction sites. 
You may enter eBay Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, 
China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Ireland, Italy, Korea, Malaysia, 
Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Philippines, Poland, Singapore, Spain, 
Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and 
(whew) Vietnam. Click one of these links and you jet off (virtually) to eBay 
sites in these countries. The international sites are in the countries’ native 
languages. It might be a good place to practice your third-year French — or 
maybe not! Remember that after you leave eBay USA, you’re subject to the 
contractual and privacy laws of the country you’re visiting.
Using the Seller’s Items Links
Here on eBay, money talks pretty loudly. In the center of the home page, you 
see a list of the auctions eBay is featuring at the moment. eBay usually posts 
six featured items at any given time and rotates items throughout the day so 
that as many sellers as possible get a shot at being in the spotlight. When you 
click the featured listings link, you’re instantly beamed to eBay’s Home Page 
Featured Items section.
You can find everything from Las Vegas vacations to Model-T Fords to diet 
products in the Home Page Featured Items. Home Page Featured Items are 
not for mere mortals with small wallets. They’ve been lifted to the exalted 
featured status because sellers shelled out lots of money to get them noticed. 
All you need to get your auction featured is $39.95 ($79.95 for Multiple Item 
listings), plus a second or two to click Home Page Featured Item on the Sell 
Your Item form. (See Chapter 10 if you have an item that all eyes must see.)

46
Part I: Getting a Feel for eBay 
Note that bidding on these items works the same way as bidding on regular 
items.
 
The Home Page Featured Items page contains many expensive items. Sellers 
who put up high-priced items have been around the block a few times and 
make it clear that they will verify each bid on the item. That means if you 
place a bid on one of Jay Leno’s autographed Harley-Davidsons (auctioned in 
2005 to benefit tsunami relief and Hurricane Katrina relief), be prepared to get 
a phone call from the seller. The seller may ask you to prove that you can 
actually pay for the motorcycle. Nothing personal; it’s strictly business.
Charities
Click the Giving Works (or Charity) link on the home page to see eBay charity 
auctions. Winning bids contribute to programs that help charities. Charity 
auctions are a great way for memorabilia collectors to find one-of-a-kind (and 
authentic) items. (Chapter 18 tells you more about what charity items you 
can bid on — and the good you can do with your checkbook.)
Promotion du Jour
The eBay community is constantly changing. To help you get into the swing 
of things right away, eBay provides a special box with links that take you 
right to the current word on the latest eBay special events.
 
Even if the main promotion box doesn’t appeal to you, usually you can find 
some interesting links dotted around the home page without a headline. You 
can find links to eBay’s special promotions for the day (or is it the hour? — it 
can change every 15 minutes)
You can get there from here — lots of places, in fact:
 
✓ A rotating list of special-interest links changes at least once a day. (Half 
the fun is getting a closer look at pages you haven’t seen.)
 
✓ Special money-saving offers from third-party vendors can be a boon if 
you’re on the lookout for a bargain.

 Chapter 3: You Can Go Home — Again and Again!
Bottoming Out
At the very bottom of the home page is an unassuming group of links that 
provide more ways to get to some seriously handy pages. I’ve listed some 
important ones in this section:
 
✓ Feedback Forum: This link takes you to one of the most important spots 
on eBay. The Feedback Forum is where you can find out whether you’ve 
forgotten to place feedback on a transaction. You can also place feed-
back and respond to feedback left for you — all in one friendly location.
 
✓ Downloads: Here’s a place where you can download some of eBay’s 
handy software. It’s a link to eBay-supplied selling-assistance software. 
(See Chapter 20 for more on these programs.)
 
✓ Gift Certificates & Gift Cards: Send someone an eBay gift certificate for 
any special occasion. You can print it yourself, or eBay will send it to 
any e-mail address you provide. The gift certificate is good for any item 
on the site for the value you specify, and you can pay for it immediately 
with PayPal. If the person you give the gift certificate to bids higher than 
the value of the gift certificate, he or she can make up the difference 
using another payment option.
 
✓ Jobs: Click here if you want to work for eBay instead of through eBay.
 
✓ Affiliates: If you have your own Web site and want to make a few bucks, 
click this link. If you sign up for the program and put a link to eBay on 
your Web page, eBay pays you money for any new user who signs up 
directly from your Web site (plus other bonuses).
 
✓ Developers: So are you a geek too? If you are, you can enter eBay’s 
Developer program and get access to the eBay API for fun and profit.
 
✓ The eBay Shop: This link enables you to browse and buy eBay merchan-
dise from the eBay company store.
 
✓ eBay Mobile: They’re really pushing using a cell phone for eBay. Trust 
me. A computer works a lot better.
 
✓ About eBay: Click this link to find out about eBay the company and to 
get its press releases, company overview, and stock information. You 
can also find out about eBay community activities and charities — and 
even apply for a job at eBay.
 
✓ Announcements: Visit the General Announcements Board when you 
want to know about any late-breaking news.
 
✓ Learning Center: Click here to see eBay’s featured educational tools.

48
Part I: Getting a Feel for eBay 
 
✓ Security Center: This link takes you to a page where concerns about 
fraud and safety are addressed. It’s such an important eBay tool that I 
dedicate an entire chapter to this program. Before buying or selling, it’s 
a good idea to check out Chapter 16.
 
✓ Resolution Center: When you have an issue with another person on the

My Very Own, Private eBay
In This Chapter
▶ Making the My eBay page a space to call your own
▶ Keeping tabs on all you’re buying and selling
▶ Organizing your data
▶ Rolling with your feedback
I
 know eBay is a sensitive, touchie-feelie kind of company because it gives 
all users plenty of personal space. Long preceding Facebook.com, eBay’s 
My eBay page is your private space for all your activities on eBay — sort of 
a “This is your eBay life.” I think it’s the greatest organizational tool around, 
and I want to talk to somebody about getting one for organizing my life out-
side eBay.
In this chapter, you find out how you can use the My eBay page to keep tabs 
on what you’re buying and selling, find out how much money you’ve spent, 
and add categories to your personalized list so that you can get to any favor-
ite eBay place with just a click of your mouse. You gain knowledge of the ins 
and outs of feedback — what it is, why it can give you that warm, fuzzy feel-
ing, and how to manage it so all that cyber-positive reinforcement doesn’t go 
to your head.
 
I do want to preface this chapter by warning you that the My eBay page has 
become the hub for the zillions of features that eBay offers. As a beginner on 
the site, you’ll be doing yourself a favor if you stick to the basics of the buying, 
selling, feedback, and account settings. eBay’s offerings are fun, but they do a 
heck of a job confusing you when you’re just starting out. Ease into the extras 
slowly.

Getting to Your My eBay Page
Using your My eBay page makes keeping track of your eBay life a whole 
lot easier. And getting there is easy enough. After you enter eBay, sign in 
through the Sign In link (described in Chapter 3). After you sign in to eBay, 
you can access your My eBay page by clicking the My eBay link in the naviga-
tion bar (see Figure 4-1) at the top of almost every eBay page.
 
Figure 4-1: 
The My 
eBay link in 
the naviga-
tion bar.
 
 
If you’ve forgotten your eBay user ID or password, click the Forgot Your User 
ID or Forgot Your Password link. For your user ID, you can then type your 
e-mail address, and eBay will send you an e-mail with your user ID. Your user 
ID appears in any search results, posts, or pages. For the password, you have 
to answer your secret question (the one you filled in when you registered). If 
you don’t remember that, eBay will send you a password-reset e-mail if you 
input your correct contact information with telephone number.
After you click the My eBay link, you arrive at your My eBay Summary page. 
As you can see by my absolutely busy Summary page in Figure 4-2, you can 
access just about anything you need right here. You find some handy remind-
ers on the center of this page. Useful buying and selling reminders also show 
up here, although when you’re involved in a large number of eBay transac-
tions, they may seem like the whining of a nagging spouse. Bottom line? 
These reminders help keep your business under control.
The My eBay drop-down menu in the navigation bar takes you to the main 
areas of My eBay. Also, look at the left side of the main My eBay page in 
Figure 4-2. Under the Summary heading are many handy links that take you 
to different areas of your eBay business. Table 4-1 gives you the scoop on the 
major links on the page.

To See This on Your My eBay Page
Buy
Every listing that you’re currently bidding on, have marked to 
watch, and made a Best Offer on, and the items you’ve won or 
didn’t win. 
Sell
Every listing for items you’re currently selling. Also, there are 
links to any listings you’ve scheduled to start at a later date. Most 
importantly, you have links to lists of items you’ve sold (and not 
sold).
Messages
This tab links to your My Messages area, eBay’s private e-mail 
service for members. My Messages is the best and safest way to 
communicate with other eBay members.
Organize
This area links to your collections of Saved Searches, Saved 
Sellers, and your lists.
Account 
This tab lets you select the activities for which you want eBay to 
remember your password so that you don’t have to type it every 
time. (I like to have eBay remember my password when I’m selling, 
bidding, managing items, and so on.) You also have the option to 
change your personal information on eBay. You can see what you 
currently owe eBay. The tab also links to your PayPal and Half.
com accounts.

52
Part I: Getting a Feel for eBay 
 
At the bottom of left side section, under the Shortcuts heading, are important 
links to activities and information.
 
Don’t confuse the My eBay page with the About Me page. The About Me page 
is a personal Web page that you can create to let the world know about you 
and your eBay dealings. (You don’t have to have an About Me page if you 
don’t want to — but they are free for the taking and are fun to share.) I tell you 
how to get your own About Me page in Chapter 14.
Keeping Track of Your Personal Business
Your My eBay page has three tabs: Activity, Messages, and Account. They’re 
on the top side of the page below the My eBay heading. If you mouse over the 
Account tab, you see a drop-down menu like the one in Figure 4-3. Clicking 
Account brings you to a summary page that has snippets of each topic in the 
My Account section. It’s really better to click the individual menu options so 
that you can go directly to the place you want to explore.
Houston, we don’t have a problem
Here’s an item I wish I’d bought: a very clean 
8-x-10-inch color Neil Armstrong–signed 
official NASA portrait w/COA (Certificate of 
Authenticity). In recent years, Armstrong, the 
first human on the moon, has been reclusive, 
and his autographs are difficult to obtain in any 
form. Many forgeries and reproductions are 
being offered, so buyer beware. This portrait 
came with a lifetime COA. The starting price 
was $10, and the portrait sold on eBay in 1999 
for $520!
Many believe that Neil Armstrong’s autograph 
will be among the most important of the twenti-
eth century. Just think about it. He was the first 
human to step onto another celestial body. This 
feat may never happen again, and certainly not 
in our lifetimes. When I updated this book for 
the third edition, this same portrait was selling 
for $650. When I checked this out for the 4th edi-
tion in 2004, the picture sold for $1,925. A quick 
scan in 2005 showed that such a signed picture 
just closed at $2,025.
The economy being what it is, Armstrong origi-
nal signed photos aren’t selling, but you’ll not 
find one up for sale for less than $3,500. He did 
sign an Apollo 11 capsule model, and that sold 
for $1,412. Why didn’t I follow my own advice 
and buy one in 1999?

Figure 4-3: 
Access indi-
vidual areas

account in 
this menu.
 
Checking your account information
The Account drop-down menu has options to take you to two very important 
areas of My eBay: Personal Information and Addresses. This is where you 
update your contact information. Initially, all this data comes from your regis-
tration. But it’s policy on eBay that every user files his or her current contact 
information — so if you move or change phone numbers, e-mail addresses, or 
banks, you need to input that information here.
It’s also where you can change your user ID (if you ever decide that 
Charlie18907 doesn’t properly reflect your personality). Also, your instant 
messenger name can be inserted here so that you can get IM alerts at Yahoo! 
Messenger, AIM, or whatever messenger program you use; add wireless num-
bers for auctions about which you want to be notified. You can also change 
your password and all your other registered information here.
 
On eBay you can change your user ID at any time (every 30 days), and your 
feedback rating will follow.

54
Part I: Getting a Feel for eBay 
Choosing your notification preferences
Because we live in a world where everyone has his or her own way of doing 
things, eBay allows you to set all kinds of preferences for your eBay account. 
One of the links leads to the Preferences page. The Preferences settings are 
all important to your eBay tasks. You have to decide which activities you 
want activated for your eBay account (you can always change these later). 
The most convenient thing is to select all the options that make sense to you. 
You can set many Notification preferences:
 
✓ Notification Delivery: This is where you let eBay know which method of 
notification works best for you. You can also indicate whether you want 
HTML or text-based e-mails.
 
✓ Buying Notifications: Be careful here. If you indicate that you want all 
this e-mail and you plan to be active on the site, prepare to be deluged. 
Select wisely! But remember, you can always make changes. You can get 
real-time notifications on your shopping for the following:
 
• Watched Item (also daily, weekly or monthly) e-mail
 
• Watched Items that were relisted by the seller
 
• Confirmations for your bids
 
• E-mails when you’re outbid in an auction
 
• Winning buyer e-mails
 
• Losing bidder e-mails
 
 As you can see, this is way too many e-mails, especially if you do a lot of 
buying and selling. They will send you e-mails for even more than I men-
tion here. For sanity’s sake, narrow your selections to the minimum.
What’s that thingy?
For the first 30 days after you register or change 
your user ID (which you can do anytime, as 
Chapter 2 explains) — eBay gives you an icon 
that stays next to your user ID every time it 
appears on eBay (when you bid, run an auction, 
or post a message on any of the chat boards).
So why the icon? eBay calls the graphic of a 
beaming robot-like critter the “new ID” icon. It’s 
sort of a friendly heads-up to others that you 
are a new user. (If you’ve changed your user ID, 
the icon consists of two of the little guys with 
an arrow connecting them.) You still have all 
the privileges that everybody else has on eBay 
while you’re breaking in your new identity. The 
icons are nothing personal, just business as 
usual.

55
 Chapter 4: My Very Own, Private eBay
 
✓ Selling Notifications: If you’re selling on the site, most of these notifica-
tions will be useful. You can indicate you want to receive the following 
e-mails:
 
• Notification that you’ve saved a draft on the Sell Your Item Form
 
• E-mail confirmation each time you list an item for sale
 
• Yay! The end-of-listing e-mail when your item has sold
 
• Boo. The e-mail you get when your item doesn’t sell
 
• Notification when your buyer performs Checkout
 
 These are all important, especially when you’re a new seller. When you 
become more active as a seller, you might want to whittle these down a 
bit — but not too much! Information is power.
 
✓ Other Transactions and Notices: Again, up to you. These can be over-
whelming. eBay gives you the option to receive e-mails in the following 
areas:
 
• Member-to-member communications
 
• Indicate whether you choose to receive Second Chance Offers
 
• Reminders to leave feedback
 
• Account preference changes
Without enumerating everything else (I can see you’re about to doze off), you 
can also opt in (or opt out) of eBay surveys, promotions, telephone update, 
and direct USPS mail from eBay.
Next on the Preferences hit parade are your actual site preferences — how 
you’d like to conduct business on the site. These are settings for the more 
advanced seller. You can make most of these decisions on the Sell Item Page. 
If you have time, though, click through each of the individual links to show 
the options and be sure the default settings work for you.
 
When you finally get your My eBay page set up the way you like it, save your-
self a lot of work and time by using your browser to bookmark your My eBay 
page as a favorite. Doing so saves you a lot of keystrokes later. If you want to 
send a shortcut to your desktop, in Internet Explorer choose File➪Send➪
Shortcut to Desktop. This way, you can open your browser directly onto your 
My eBay page. Some eBay members make their My eBay page their browser 
home page so that their My eBay page appears the minute they log on. That’s 
true dedication.

56
Part I: Getting a Feel for eBay 
Your Feedback link
Next (after the Seller Dashboard which I explain further on) comes the 
Feedback option. In the Feedback area, you see all the items that need your 
feedback attention, and you can see the recent feedback that has been left for 
you. Save yourself a trip; you can more conveniently leave feedback from the 
item page, your Sell page, or your Buy page.
Account links
Not surprisingly, the My Account option leads you to more links for your 
PayPal and eBay Seller accounts. After you start selling, your Accounts pages 
become powerful. Figure 4-4 shows you the Seller Accounts summary section 
of my My eBay page. There’s also a drop-down menu so that you can view 
past or current invoices. You can look up every detail of your account his-
tory, as well as make changes to your personal preferences (such as how and 
when you want to pay fees).

Before you jump into the money game, you may want to review the links that 
eBay gives you to manage your money:

57
 Chapter 4: My Very Own, Private eBay
 
✓ View Account Status: Click here to get a complete explanation of your 
eBay account — charges, credits, and your current balance since your 
last invoice.
 
✓ View Invoices: Click the drop-down menu to see your most recent 
invoice and details of the transactions.
 
✓ PayPal: A quick click here, and you’re taken to the PayPal home page. 
Check out Chapter 6 for more on the PayPal payment service.
 
 When you give eBay your credit card information, eBay attempts to 
authorize your card immediately. Your credit card company’s response, 
either Declined or Approved, appears on your View Account Status 
page.
 
✓ Payment Terms: Although you need to post a credit card for ID pur-
poses to sell on eBay, you can pay your eBay bill in one of three ways. 
They like to deduct it directly from your registered checking account, 
but I prefer the ways listed next. You can change your method of pay-
ment at any time. See Table 4-2 to find out when the different payments 
are charged to your account.
 
• Credit Card on File: You can place your credit card on file with 
eBay so that each month eBay can place your selling charges on 
your credit card. I’ve been using this format since I became an 
eBay user and find that it works out very well.
 
• PayPal: You can make single payments directly through your 
PayPal account. If you have a cash balance in your account, 
you can have it applied to your eBay bill; if not, you can pay the 
amount through the credit card you’ve registered on PayPal.

Understanding Your Seller Dashboard
If you look at the links in the box on the left of your Account Summary page, 
you see a group of links to quickly zip to specific areas as well as navigating 
by using the tab with its drop-down menu. One of the most important is the 
link to the Seller Dashboard, which is the place where eBay calculates your 
ratings on the site. An explanation of the Detailed Seller Ratings (DSRs) is in 
Chapter 8. Figure 4-5 shows you a shot of my Seller Dashboard.
 
Figure 4-5: 
Viewing 
my cur-
rent Seller 
Dashboard.
 
This is an important place to go on a regular basis because eBay evaluates 
your status on the site daily. Your status affects your placement in searches 
and whether you get a discount on your fees (based on your customer satis-
faction ratings) if you’re a PowerSeller.
Using the Resolution Center
If you sell an item and the buyer backs out (a rare but disheartening situation), 
you can at least get a refund on some of the fees that eBay charges you as a 
seller. These are the final value fees, and they’re based on the selling price of 
the item. In the Resolution Center you can keep track of the disputes in prog-
ress and send or receive messages from the other party regarding payment.

59
 Chapter 4: My Very Own, Private eBay
Before you can collect a final value fee refund, the following conditions must 
apply:
 
✓ After your listing is over, you have to allow buyers at least three busi-
ness days to respond to you. If they don’t respond, you can send them 
an e-mail politely reminding them of their commitment to buy.
 
✓ If at least seven days have elapsed since the end of the transaction and 
you have the feeling that you’re not going to see your money, you must 
open an Unpaid Item Alert. After you file this notice, eBay sends you a 
copy and the bidder gets an ominous e-mail with a reminder to complete 
the transaction or to respond with a reason.
 
 You have up to 45 days from the end of the auction to file an Unpaid 
Item Alert — and you can’t get a final value fee credit without filing this 
alert.
 
✓ The next ten days after you file the Unpaid Item Alert are your “work 
out” days — the period where you and the bidder hopefully complete 
your transaction. You may try to give the bidder a call or send an e-mail 
through the Dispute Console to resolve the situation during this time.
 
✓ After the ten days have passed but no more than 60 days have elapsed 
since the end of the auction, you may file for a final value fee credit.
 
If you have begin the process and file for a final value fee credit but then 
manage to work things out with the buyer, eBay removes the complaint from 
the buyer’s account after the buyer pays through PayPal. Buyers with too 
many of these warnings can be suspended from using the eBay site. You can 
automatically file to have this alert removed through the Dispute Console.
Organizing in the Organize Area
Part of the fun of eBay is searching for stuff that you’d never in a million 
years think of looking for. Wacky stuff aside, most eBay users spend their 
time hunting for specific items — say, Barbie dolls, designer dresses, plumb-
ing supplies, or U.S. stamps. That’s why eBay came up with the Organize area 
of your My eBay page. Whenever you view your My eBay Organize links, you 
see a list of your favorite searches and sellers. But because eBay isn’t psy-
chic, you have to tell it what you want listed.
If you shop eBay at all like I do, you’ll be looking for similar things and sellers 
over and over. The My eBay Organize area allows you to make note of your 
favorite searches and sellers. You can perform these searches and visit these 
stores with a click of your mouse.

60
Part I: Getting a Feel for eBay 
Saved searches
You have the opportunity to list a maximum of 100 searches here. When you 
want to repeat one of these searches, just click the Search name to search for 
the item. eBay will even e-mail you up to 20 of your searches when new items 
are listed. (For more on that advanced function, check out Chapter 18.)
To add a search to your favorites, first perform the search. (For details on 
how to perform a search, see Chapter 5.) When the search appears on your 
screen, click the Save This Search link, shown at the top of the search results 
in Figure 4-6.

Saved sellers
When you find a seller whose merchandise and prices are right up your alley 
and you’d like to occasionally check out the seller’s auctions, you can list the 
seller in the Favorite Sellers area:
 
1. When you’ve shopped eBay and found a seller that you’re happy with, 
click the link on the listing page to view the seller’s other items.
 
 You see a search page listing all the items for sale by that seller.
 
2. Scroll down the page, and on the left side, click the Add to saved sell-
ers link.
 
 The seller is saved to your Saved sellers (favorites) page.
 
If you find seller that you’d like to make favorites while you’re browsing or 
buying in their eBay stores, click the Add to Saved Sellers link at the top of the 
store’s home page.

Got the time? eBay does. Click the eBay Official Time link, which is at the 
bottom of virtually every eBay page. The eBay clock is so accurate that you 
can set your watch by it. And you may want to, especially if you want to place 
a last-second bid before an auction closes. After all, eBay’s official time is, um, 
official.
Following the Action on Your 
Buying and Watching Pages
I have the most fun on eBay when I’m shopping. Shopping on eBay is exciting, 
and I can find a zillion great bargains. Fortunately, eBay gives us a place to 
keep all our shopping information together: the Buying area.
Seeing the Items I’m Buying
When you bid on an item, eBay automatically lists the item in the Buying 
area of your My eBay Page. If you’re winning an auction, the price appears in 
green; if you’re losing, it appears in red. After the auction’s over, the listing 
moves to Won (yea!) or Didn’t Win (boo!). You can watch the progress of the 
auction from here and see the number of bids on the item, the high bid, and 
how much time is left until the end of the auction. All this information can 
help you decide whether you want to jump back in and make a bid.
eBay also keeps a total of all your active bids and buys to the left your data 
in the Totals: Buying Total box — which I hope helps you stay within your 
spending limits.
Keeping track of Items I’ve Won
When you’ve won an auction or purchased an item in a store, it appears in 
the Won area. From this area, you can visit the auction to print the auction 
page or double-check it. From the links in the Action column, you can also 
pay for your item through PayPal; if you’ve already paid, you can view the 
PayPal payment details. You can also click a Leave Feedback link here from 
the drop-down menu — after you’ve received the item and are satisfied with 
your purchase — to leave feedback.

63
 Chapter 4: My Very Own, Private eBay
Sleuthing with Items I’m Watching
Items I’m Watching is the most active area of my My eBay page (see Figure 
4-8). This is the place for you to work on your strategy for getting bargains 
without showing your hand by bidding. In this area, you can watch the auc-
tion evolve and decide if you want to bid on it. You can list several auctions 
for the same item and watch them develop and then bid on the one that can 
give you the best deal. You can track the progress of up to 100 auctions in 
your Items I’m Watching area.
 
Figure 4-8: 
The Watch 
area of the 
My eBay 
page.
 
Moving auctions into the Item’s I’m Watching area is easy. When you’ve 
found an item that you want to keep track of, look for the Watch This Item 
(Track It in My eBay) link, which is located just below the price on the list-
ing page. Just click this link to transport the item to your Items I’m Watching 
area.

Part I: Getting a Feel for eBay 
Surveying Your Sales on Your 
My eBay Selling Page
Your My eBay page supplies you with the tools to keep track of items you’re 
selling on eBay. The My eBay Selling page works much the same as the 
Bidding page, but this time you’re making the money — not spending it! 
Your current auction sales are listed in the Items I’m Selling area. The items 
with bids on them appear in green, and the ones without bids (or where the 
reserve hasn’t been met) are in red. At the bottom, you have a dollar total of 
the current bids on your auctions.
Your Sell page
Similar to the Buy section of the All Buying section, the Sell area keeps track 
of your ongoing listings on eBay. You can observe the auction action in real 
time (or at least every time you refresh the page). You can see how many 
bids have been placed, when the auction closes, and the time left in the auc-
tion. If you want more information about what’s going on, click the handy All 
Item Details link, which gives you a miniversion of each auction (without the 
description).
Your Sold page
When the sale is final, the items go into the Sold area (shown in Figure 4-9). 
Here’s where you can keep track of the sale. You can check whether the 
buyer has paid with PayPal as well as the transaction status. If the buyer has 
completed checkout, you can get his or her information by clicking the Next 
Steps/Status link. If the buyer hasn’t completed checkout, you can click the 
Send Invoice button to send the buyer an invoice. Very handy!
If you haven’t heard from the buyer after three days (the prescribed eBay 
deadline for contact), you may need to resend your invoice or send another 
e-mail. See Chapter 12 for more information on post-sale correspondence.
After the transaction is complete (which means the item has arrived and 
the buyer is happy with his or her purchase), you can click the handy Leave 
Feedback link to leave feedback about the buyer.
You can also relist the item from a quick link or place a Second Chance offer 
to an underbidder if you have more than one of the item. See the nearby side-
bar for more on the Second Chance feature.

Figure 4-9:

Your secret seller tool — Second Chance!
Those cagey minds at eBay have come up with 
another great selling implement. Say you have 
multiples of a single item (you did sell that set of 
Minton china one piece at a time, didn’t you?) 
or the winning bidder backs out of the transac-
tion without paying. Second Chance offer gives 
you the opportunity to offer the item to one of 
the underbidders (okay, the losers) at their high 
bid price. You can also create a Second Chance 
if you set a reserve that wasn’t met before the 
auction ended. The Second Chance opportunity 
is available for up to 60 days after the sale ends.
You can offer the item to as many of the under-
bidders (as you have merchandise to cover) at a 
time and make this personal offer good for one 
to seven days. The bidder receives an e-mail 
regarding the offer and can access it on the 
site through a special link. It is visible to only 
you and the other bidder for the duration of the 
offer. The best part is that eBay doesn’t charge 
any additional listing fees for this feature, but 
you are charged the final value fee after the 
transaction is complete.

eBay’s Selling Manager/Selling 
Manager Pro
If you’re at the point where you’re selling bunches of items on the site, you 
may want to subscribe to one of eBay’s Selling Manager tools. These tools 
make your Selling area look completely different and give you the opportu-
nity to handle more sales in a compact and convenient design. See Chapter 
20 for detailed information.
Keeping Track of Your Transactions
Yes, I bug you about printing stuff at the outset of your selling career — not 
because I’m in cahoots with the paper industry but because I care. The eBay 
transaction process can be daunting, and beginners can easily lose track. 
The best way to protect yourself is to keep good records on your own. Don’t 
depend on eBay to cover you — not that eBay doesn’t care. But this is your 
money, so keep a close eye on it.
Now don’t become a pack rat and overdo it. To help point you in the right 
direction, here’s a list of important documents I think you should print and 
file whether you’re a buyer or a seller:
 
✓ Auction pages as they appear when they close
 
✓ PayPal statements indicating any payment you receive that doesn’t clear
 
✓ Insurance or escrow forms
 
✓ Refund and credit requests
 
✓ Receipts from purchases you make for items to sell on eBay
 
Always, always, always save every e-mail message you receive about a transac-
tion, whether you buy or sell until the transaction is over and feedback is left. 
Also save your EOAs (End of Auction e-mails) that eBay sends. For more infor-
mation about EOAs and correspondence etiquette after the auction is over, 
see Chapters 8 and 12.
Why should you save all this stuff? Here are some reasons:
 
✓ Even if you’re buying and selling just a few items a month on eBay, you 
need to keep track of who you owe and who owes you money.
 
✓ Good e-mail correspondence is a learned art, but if you reference item 
numbers, your e-mail is an instant record. If you put your dates in writ-
ing — and follow up — you have a nice, neat paper trail.

67
 Chapter 4: My Very Own, Private eBay
 
✓ Documenting the transaction through e-mail will come in handy if you 
ever end up in a dispute over the terms of the sale.
 
✓ If you sell specialized items, you can keep track of trends and your fre-
quent buyers.
 
✓ Some day the IRS may come knocking on your door, especially if you 
buy stuff for the purpose of selling it on eBay. Scary, but true. For more 
on where you can get tax information, take a look at Chapter 9.
 
When it comes to keeping records via e-mail and documents about transac-
tions, I say that after you’ve received your feedback (positive, of course), you 
can dump it. If you get negative feedback (how could you?), hang on to your 
paperwork for a little longer. Use your discretion, but generally you can toss 
the paperwork from a bad transaction after it has reached some sort of resolu-
tion. (You can find out more about feedback in the next section.)
 
Once a month, do a seller search on yourself and print your latest eBay his-
tory. Chapter 5 tells you more about doing seller searches, organizing your 
searches, and starting files on items you want to track.
Getting and Giving Feedback
You know how they say you are what you eat? On eBay, you are only as good 
as your feedback says you are. Your feedback is made up of comments — 
good, bad, or neutral — that people leave about you (and you leave about 
others). In effect, people are commenting on your overall professionalism. 
(Even if you’re an eBay hobbyist with no thought of using it professionally, a 
little businesslike courtesy can ease your transactions with everyone.) These 
comments are the basis for your eBay reputation.
 
Because feedback is so important to your reputation on eBay, you don’t want 
others leaving feedback or making bad transactions under your name. The 
only way to ensure this doesn’t happen is to always keep your password a 
secret. If you suspect somebody may know your password, change it before 
that person has a chance to sign in as you and ruin your reputation. (For more 
on selecting and protecting your level of privacy, see Chapters 1 and 15.)
When you get your first feedback, the number that appears next to your user 
ID is your feedback rating, which follows you everywhere you go on eBay, 
even if you change your user ID or e-mail address. It sticks to you like glue. 
Click the number next to any user ID and get a complete look at the user’s 
feedback profile. The thinking behind the feedback concept is that you 
wouldn’t be caught dead in a store that has a lousy reputation, so why on 
earth would you want to do business on the Internet with someone who has a 
lousy reputation?

68
Part I: Getting a Feel for eBay 
 
You’re not required to leave feedback, but because it’s the benchmark by 
which all eBay users are judged, whether you’re buying or selling, you should 
always leave feedback comments. Get in the frame of mind that every time you 
complete a transaction — the minute the package arrives safely if you’re a 
seller or an item you’ve bid on and won arrives — you should go to eBay and 
post your feedback.
Every time you get a positive comment from a user who hasn’t commented 
on you before within the past week, you get a point. Every time you get a 
negative rating, this negative cancels out one of your positives. Neutral com-
ments rate a 0 — they have no impact either way. eBay even has what it calls 
the Star Chart, shown in Figure 4-10, which rewards those with good-and-
getting-higher feedback ratings.
 
Figure 4-10: 
The eBay

achieve-
ment Star 
rating.
 
 
The flip side (or Dark Side to you Star Wars fans) of the star system is negative 
numbers. Negative comments deduct from your total of positive comments, 
thereby lowering the number beside your user ID. eBay riddle: When is more 
than one still one? Gotcha, huh? The answer is, when you get more than one 
feedback message from the same person in the same week. Confused? This 
should help: You can sell one person 100 different items, but even if the buyer 
gives you a glowing review 100 times in the same week, your feedback rating 
doesn’t increase by 100. In this case, the other 99 feedback comments appear 
in your feedback profile, but your rating increases only by 1.
Sellers are only allowed to leave positive feedback for buyers — I know this 
may not make sense, but that’s the way it is. You can leave a “positive,” but 
still be honest about your transaction in your words. eBay made this rule so 
sellers wouldn’t leave retaliatory feedback to buyers who left them negative 
feedback.

69
 Chapter 4: My Very Own, Private eBay
Should a buyer who hasn’t paid leave you a negative, eBay cooperates and 
removes the feedback, provided you’ve filed an Unpaid Item report.
 
If feedback is left individually and stretched out over several weeks (only one 
per week), the person on the other end of the transaction will get a single feed-
back point each time you leave a positive. I do this for my buyers who buy mul-
tiple items from me (it’s easy from the My eBay page). But, grrrrrr, they don’t 
seem to know this rule so I’ll get several positives — one after another — 
netting me only one positive. *Sigh*
 
Anyone with a –4 rating has his or her eBay membership terminated. 
Remember, just because a user may have a 750 feedback rating, it doesn’t hurt 
to click the number after the name to double-check the person’s eBay ID card. 
Even if someone has a total of 1,000 feedback messages, 250 of them could be 
negative.
 
You can get to your personal feedback profile page right from your My eBay 
page by clicking the number next to your user ID.
Feedback comes in three exciting flavors:
 
✓ Positive feedback: Someone once said, “All you have is your reputa-
tion.” Reputation is what makes eBay function. If the transaction works 
well, you get positive feedback; whenever it’s warranted, you should 
give it right back.
 
✓ Negative feedback: If there’s a glitch (for instance, it takes six months 
to get your Charlie’s Angels lunchbox or the seller substitutes a rusty 
thermos for the one you bid on or you never get the item), you have the 
right — some would say obligation — to leave negative feedback.
 
✓ Neutral feedback: You can leave neutral feedback if you feel so-so about 
a specific transaction. It’s the middle-of-the-road comment. Say you 
bought an item that had a little more wear and tear on it than the seller 
indicated, but you still like it and want to keep it.
How to get positive feedback
If you’re selling, here’s how to get a good reputation:
 
✓ Establish contact with the buyer (pronto!) after the listing ends (see 
Chapter 12).
 
✓ After you’ve received payment, send the item quickly (see Chapter 12).

70
Part I: Getting a Feel for eBay 
 
✓ Make sure that your item is exactly the way you described it (see 
Chapter 10).
 
✓ Package the item well and ship it with care (see Chapter 12).
 
✓ React quickly and appropriately to problems — for example, the item’s lost 
or damaged in the mail, or the buyer is slow in paying (see Chapter 12).
If you’re buying, try these good-rep tips:
 
✓ Send your payment fast (see Chapter 8).
 
✓ Keep in touch through e-mail with the seller (see Chapter 8).
 
✓ Work with the seller to resolve any problems in a courteous manner 
(see Chapters 8 and 12).
How to get negative feedback
If you’re selling, here’s what to do to tarnish your name big-time:
 
✓ Tell a major fib in the item description. (Defend truth, justice, and legiti-
mate creative writing — see Chapter 10.)
 
✓ Take the money but “forget” to ship the item. (Who did you say you are? 
See Chapter 16.)
 
✓ Package the item poorly so that it ends up smashed, squashed, or vapor-
ized during shipping. (To avoid this pathetic fate, see Chapter 12.)
If you’re buying, you can’t get official negative feedback, but the seller still 
has their “say.” Here’s how to make your feedback comment a serious mess:
 
✓ Bid on an item, win the auction, and never respond to the seller. 
(Remember your manners and see Chapter 6.)
 
✓ Send a personal check that bounces and never make good on the pay-
ment. (See Chapter 16 — and don’t pass Go.)
 
✓ Ask the seller for a refund because you just don’t like the item. 
(Remember how to play fair and see Chapter 8.)

 Chapter 4: My Very Own, Private eBay
The Feedback page
When you click the Feedback number next to a member’s user ID, you’ll see 
all the tools you need to gauge the member. Think of your feedback profile as 
your eBay report card. Your goal is to get straight As — in this case, all posi-
tive feedback. Unlike a real report card, you don’t have to bring it home to be 
signed.
When someone clicks the feedback number next to your user ID, they see the 
following information (see Figure 4-11):
 
✓ Your user ID: Your eBay nickname appears, followed by a number in 
parentheses — the net number of the positive feedback comments 
you’ve received, minus any negative feedback comments you may have 
(but that wouldn’t happen to you).
 
✓ Your membership information: Listed here is the date you first signed 
up as a member of the eBay community. Below that is the country from 
which you’re registered, your star rating (refer to Figure 4-11), and 
any icons leading to more areas related to you on eBay, such as your 
About Me page (see Chapter 14). This area also notes whether you are a 
PowerSeller (see Chapter 20) and whether you have an eBay Store.
 
✓ Detailed Seller Ratings: This area sums up the ratings, from one to five, 
that buyers have left for you.
Extra, extra, read all about it
Normally, I believe in the adage, “Keep your 
business private.” But not when it comes to 
feedback. The default setting is for public view-
ing of your feedback. This way, everyone on 
eBay can read all about you. If you want to make 
your feedback a private matter, you need to go 
to the Feedback Forum. Click the Feedback link 
under the My Account heading of the My eBay 
page. Then click the Go to Feedback Forum link. 
The link you need to click from there is the Hide 
my Feedback link.
However, hiding your feedback is a very bad 
idea. You want people to know that you’re trust-
worthy; being honest and upfront is the way to 
go. If you hide your feedback profile, people 
may suspect that you’re covering up bad things 
and eBay takes away your selling privileges. It’s 
in your best interest to let the spotlight shine 
on your feedback history. It’s your reputation, 
your money, and your experience as an eBay 
member. Keep in mind that all three are always 
linked.

72
Part I: Getting a Feel for eBay 
 
✓ Your Recent Feedback Ratings: This area is a scorecard of your feed-
back for the last 12 months. At the bottom of the feedback tote board is 
a summary of your bid retractions in the past six months — the times 
you have retracted bids during an auction.
 
Figure 4-11: 
The

Profile —

Be careful when you retract a bid. All bids on eBay are binding, but under 
what eBay calls “exceptional circumstances,” you may retract bids — very 
sparingly. Here are the circumstances in which it’s okay to retract a bid:
 
✓ If you’ve mistakenly put in the wrong bid amount — say, $100 instead of 
$10
 
✓ If the seller adds to his or her description after you’ve placed your bid, 
and the change considerably affects the item
 
✓ If you can’t contact the seller (your e-mail continuously bounces back 
and the phone number doesn’t work)
 
You can’t retract a bid just because you found the item elsewhere cheaper or 
you changed your mind or you decided that you really can’t afford the item. If 
that’s the case, e-mail the seller and ask them to please remove your bid. See 
Chapter 6 for more information on retracting bids.

73
 Chapter 4: My Very Own, Private eBay
Reading your feedback
Your eBay reputation is at the mercy of the one-liners that buyers and sellers 
leave for you in the form of feedback comments. Each feedback box contains 
these reputation-building (or reputation-trashing) ingredients:
 
✓ The user ID of the person who sent the feedback. The number in paren-
theses next to the person’s name is his or her own feedback rating.
 
✓ The date and time the feedback was posted.
 
✓ The item number of the transaction that the feedback refers to. If 
the item has closed in the past 30 days, you can click the transaction 
number to see what the buyer purchased.
 
✓ Seller or Buyer — indicating whether you were the seller or the buyer in 
the transaction.
 
✓ Feedback bullets in different colors: praise (in green with a plus mark), 
negative (in red with a minus mark), or neutral (in grey with a white dot).
 
✓ The feedback the person left about you.
You have the last word — responding 
to feedback
After reading feedback you’ve received from others, you may feel compelled 
to respond. If the feedback is negative, you may want to defend yourself. If 
it’s positive, you may want to say thank you.
To respond to feedback, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Feedback link in the drop-down menu under the Account tab 
on your My eBay page, and then click the Go to Feedback Forum link 
at the top of the page.
 
 You’re transported to the Feedback Forum, where you can reply to feed-
back comments left for you.
 
2. Find the feedback you want to respond to and click the Reply link.
 
3. Type your response.
If you want to follow up to a feedback you’ve already left for someone, follow 
the preceding steps, but in Step 2, click the Follow Up to Feedback Left link 
on the Feedback Forum page.

74
Part I: Getting a Feel for eBay 
 
Do not confuse replying to feedback with leaving feedback. Replying does not 
change the other user’s feedback rating; it merely adds a line below the feed-
back with your response.
Leaving feedback with finesse
Writing feedback well takes some practice. It isn’t a matter of saying things; 
it’s a matter of saying only the appropriate things. Think carefully about what 
you want to say because once you submit feedback, it stays with the person 
for the duration of his or her eBay career. I think you should always leave 
feedback, especially at the end of a transaction, although doing so isn’t man-
datory. Think of leaving feedback as voting in an election: If you don’t leave 
feedback, you can’t complain about lousy service.
eBay says to make feedback “factual and emotionless.” You won’t go wrong 
if you comment on the details (either good or bad) of the transaction. If you 
have any questions about what eBay says about feedback, click the Feedback 
link on your My eBay page and then click the Go to Feedback Forum link.
In the Feedback Forum, you can perform six feedback-related tasks:
 
✓ See feedback about an eBay user.
 
✓ Leave feedback for many auctions at once. Here, you see all pending 
feedback for all transactions within the past 90 days. You are presented 
with a page of all your transactions for which you haven’t left feedback. 
Fill them in, one at a time, and with one click you can leave as many as 
25 feedback comments at once.
 
✓ Review and respond to existing feedback about you.
 
✓ Review the feedback you have left for others. Here, you may also leave 
follow-up feedback after the initial feedback, should situations change.
 
✓ Make your feedback profile public or private. Remember, if you make 
your feedback profile private, you may hinder your future business on 
eBay. See the sidebar “Extra, extra, read all about it,” elsewhere in this 
chapter.
 
✓ Check the Feedback FAQ to review any changes in the feedback system.
 
In the real world (at least in the modern American version of it), anybody can 
sue anybody else for slander or libel; this fact holds true on the Internet, too. It’s 
a good idea to be careful not to make any comments that could be libelous or 
slanderous. eBay is not responsible for your actions, so if you’re sued because 
of negative feedback (or anything else you’ve written), you’re on your own. The 
best way to keep yourself safe is to stick to the facts and to not get personal.

Mincing words: The at-a-glance guide 
to keeping feedback short
eBay likes to keep things simple. If you want 
to compliment, complain, or take the middle 
road, you have to do it in 80 characters or less. 
That means your comment needs to be short 
and sweet (or short and sour if it’s negative, or 
sweet and sour if you’re mixing drinks or order-
ing Chinese food). If you have a lot to say but 
you’re stumped about how to say it, here are 
a few examples for any occasion. String them 
together or mix and match!
Positive feedback:
 ✓ Very professional
 ✓ Quick e-mail response
 ✓ Fast service
 ✓ A+++
 ✓ Good communication
 ✓ Exactly as described
 ✓ Highly recommended
 ✓ Smooth transaction
 ✓ Would deal with again
 ✓ An asset to eBay
 ✓ I’ll be back!
Negative feedback:
 ✓ Never responded
 ✓ Never sent item
 ✓ Desperately slow shipping
 ✓ Beware track record
 ✓ Not as described
Neutral feedback:
 ✓ Slow to ship but item as described
 ✓ Item not as described but seller made 
good
 ✓ Poor communication but item came OK
 
If you’re angry, take a breather before you type your complaints and click the 
Leave Comment button. If you’re convinced that negative feedback is neces-
sary, try a cooling-off period before you send a comment. Wait an hour or a 
day and then see whether you feel the same. Nasty feedback based on emo-
tion can make you look vindictive (even if what you’re saying is true).
Safety tips for giving feedback
And speaking of safety features you should know about feedback, you may 
want to study up on these:
 
✓ Remember that feedback, whether good or bad, is sticky. eBay won’t 
remove your feedback comment if you change your mind later. Be sure 
of your facts and carefully consider what you want to say.
 
✓ Before you leave feedback, see what other people had to say about that 
person. Is your thinking in line with the comments others have left?

76
Part I: Getting a Feel for eBay 
 
✓ Your feedback comment can be left as long as the transaction remains 
on the eBay server. This is usually within 90 days of the end of the list-
ing. After 90 days have passed, you must have the transaction number 
to leave feedback.
 
✓ Your comment can be a maximum of only 80 letters long, which is really 
short when you have a lot to say. Before you start typing, organize your 
thoughts and use common abbreviations to save precious space.
 
✓ Before posting negative feedback, try to resolve the problem by e-mail 
or telephone. You may discover that your reaction to the transaction is 
based on a misunderstanding that can be easily resolved.
 
✓ eBay users generally want to make each other happy, so use negative 
feedback only as a last resort. See Chapters 8 and 10 for more details on 
how to avoid negative feedback.
 
If you do leave a negative comment that you later regret, you can’t remove it. 
You can go back to follow up and leave an explanation or a more positive com-
ment (but it won’t change the initial feedback or rating), so think twice before 
you blast.
The ways to leave feedback
Several ways are available to leave feedback comments:
 
✓ If you’re on the user’s Feedback page, click the Leave Feedback link; the 
Leave Feedback page appears.
 
✓ In the Won area of your My eBay page, click the Leave Feedback link 
next to the listing.
 
✓ Go to your auction and click the Leave Feedback icon.
 
✓ In the Feedback Forum, click the Leave Feedback link to see a list of all 
your completed items from the last 90 days for which you haven’t yet 
left feedback.
To leave feedback for a buyer, follow these steps:
 
1. Enter the required information.
 
 Note that your item number is usually filled in, but if you’re placing feed-
back from the user’s Feedback page, you need to have the number at hand.
 
2. Type your comment.
 
 Only positive feedback can be left for a buyer, so choose your words 
carefully.
 
3. Click the Leave Feedback button.

fter you have an idea how to get around the eBay 
site, no doubt you’ll want to get started buying. 
You’ve come to the right place. Here you can find all the 
information you need to start bidding and winning items 
at the lowest possible prices.
Although eBay is a lot more fun than school, you still have 
to do your homework. After you’ve registered to become 
an eBay member (in Part I), you can place a bid on (or 
outright buy) any item you see. But first you have to find 
the item that’s right for you . . . and then maybe find out 
what it’s worth. And what happens when you win?!
In this part, I show you how to find the items you want 
without sifting through every single one of eBay’s millions 
of listings. I also give you an insider’s look at determining 
the value of a collectible, deciding how much you’re will-
ing to spend, and using the right strategy to win the item 
at just the right price. When the listing is over, follow my 
advice to make closing the deal go as smooth as silk.

icture all the stores you’ve ever seen in your life, located in one giant 
mall. You walk in and try to find the single item you’re looking for. Man, 
that’s tough! Consider also walking into a store with thousands of aisles of 
shelves with tens of millions of items on them. Browsing the categories of list-
ings on eBay can be just as pleasantly boggling, without the prospect of sore 
feet. Start surfing around the site and you instantly understand the size and 
scope of what’s for sale there. Everything. Without question, you’ll feel over-

find exactly what you’re looking for. As soon as you figure out how to find the 
items you want to bid or buy on eBay, you can protect your investment-to-be 
by making sure that what you find is actually what you seek.
Of course, searching is easier if you have an idea of what you’re looking for. 
In this chapter for collectors, I offer the first-time buyer some expert tips and

tips for using the eBay search engine from a buyer’s perspective.
 
The best advice you can follow as you explore any free-market system is 
caveat emptor — let the buyer beware. Although nobody can guarantee that 
every one of your transactions will be perfect, research items thoroughly 
before you bid so that you don’t lose too much of your hard-earned money — 
or too much sleep.

General Online Tips for Collectors
If you’re just starting out on eBay, chances are you like to shop and you 
also collect items that interest you. You’ll find out pretty early in your eBay 
adventures that a lot of people online know as much about collecting as they 
do about bidding — and some are serious contenders.
How can you compete? Well, in addition to having a well-planned buying 
strategy (covered in Chapter 7), knowing your stuff gives you a winning edge. 
I’ve gathered the opinions of two collecting experts to get the info you need 
about online collecting basics. (If you’re already an expert collector but want 
help finding that perfect something on eBay so you can get ready to bid, 
you’ve got it. See “Looking to Find an Item? Start Your eBay Search Engine,” 
later in this chapter.) I also show you how one of those experts puts the 
information into practice, and I give you a crash course on how items for sale 
are (or should be) graded.
 
Although these tips from the experts are targeted for collectors, much of the 
information is sound advice for those involved in any transaction online.
The experts speak out
Bill Swoger closed his collectibles store in Burbank, California and sold the 
balance of his G.I. Joe and Superman items on eBay. And Lee Bernstein, a 
columnist and collectibles dealer who operates Lee Bernstein Books and 
Collectibles from her home base in Schererville, Indiana, authors a monthly 
column for the New England Antiques Journal. She also is the author of eBay’s 
Collectibles original “Inside Scoop.” Bill and Lee offer these tips to collectors 
new to eBay:
 
✓ Get all the facts before you put your money down. Study the descrip-
tion carefully. It’s your job to analyze the description and make your 
bidding decisions accordingly. Find out whether all original parts are 
included and whether the item has any flaws. If the description says 
that the Fred Flintstone figurine has a cracked back, e-mail the seller for 
more information on just how cracked Fred really is.
 
✓ Don’t get caught up in the emotional thrill of bidding. First-time 
buyers (known as Under-10s or newbies because they have fewer than 
ten transactions under their belts) tend to bid wildly, using emotions 
instead of brains. If you’re new to eBay, you can get burned if you just 
bid for the thrill of victory without thinking about what you’re doing.

81
 Chapter 5: Seek and You Shall Find: Research
 
 I can’t stress how important it is to determine an item’s value, whether 
collectible or new. But because values are such flighty things (values 
depend on supply and demand, market trends, and all sorts of other 
variables), I recommend that you get a general idea of the item’s value 
and use this ballpark figure to set a maximum amount of money you’re 
willing to bid for that item. Then stick to your maximum and don’t even 
think about bidding past it. If the bidding gets too hot, there’s always 
another auction. To find out more about bidding strategies, Chapter 7 is 
just the ticket.
 
✓ Know what the item should cost. Buyers used to depend on price guides — 
books on collectibles and their values — to help them bid. Bill says that 
price guides are becoming a thing of the past. Sure, you can find a guide 
that says an original Lion King Broadway poster in excellent condition 
has a book price of $150, but if you do a search on eBay, you’ll see that 
they’re actually selling for $65 to $75.
 
 When your search on eBay turns up what you’re looking for, average the 
current prices you find. Also check the completed listings. Doing so 
gives you a much better idea of what you need to spend than any price 
guide can.
 
✓ Timing is everything, and being first costs. If you’re into movie post-
ers, for example, consider this: If you can wait three to six months after 
a movie is released, you can get the poster for 40 to 50 percent less. The 
same goes for many new releases of collectibles. Sometimes you’re wiser 
to wait and save money.
 
✓ Be careful of presale items. Sometimes you may run across vendors 
selling items that they don’t have in stock but that they’ll ship to you 
later. For example, before Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace 
came out, some vendors ran auctions on movie posters they didn’t have 
yet. If you had bid and won, and for some reason the vendor had a prob-
lem getting the poster, you’d have been out of luck. Don’t bid on any-
thing that can’t be delivered as soon as you pay for the item. See some 
of eBay’s presale rules later in this chapter.
 
✓ Being too late can also cost. Many collectibles become more difficult to 
find as time goes by. Generally, as scarcity increases, so does desirabil-
ity and value. Common sense tells you that if two original and identical 
collectibles are offered side by side, with one in like-new condition and 
the other in used condition, the like-new item will have the higher value.
 
✓ Check out the seller. Check the feedback rating (the number in paren-
theses next to the person’s user ID) a seller has before you buy. If the 
seller has many comments with a minute number of negative ones, 
chances are good that this is a reputable seller. For more on feedback, 
see Chapter 4.

82
Part II: Buying Like an Expert 
 
 Although eBay forbids side deals, an unsuccessful bidder may (at his or 
her own risk) contact a seller after an auction is over to see if the seller 
has more of the item in stock. If the seller is an experienced eBay user (a 
high feedback rating is usually a tip-off) and has more of the item in 
stock, he or she may consider making a perfectly eBay-legal Second 
Chance offer. Don’t ask to buy the item off-site. eBay strictly prohibits 
selling items off the site. If you conduct a side deal and are reported to 
eBay, you can be suspended. Not only that, but buyers who are ripped 
off by sellers in away-from-eBay transactions shouldn’t look to eBay to 
bail them out; you’re on your own. The way to purchase these items is 
by asking the seller to post another of the item for you — or if you were 
an underbidder in the auction, send you a Second Chance offer. That 
way, you’re also protected by PayPal buyer protections.
 
✓ If an item comes to you broken in the mail, contact the seller to work 
it out. The best bet is to request shipping insurance (you pay for it) 
before the seller ships the item. But if you didn’t ask for insurance, it 
never hurts to ask for a discount (or a replacement item, if available) if 
you’re not satisfied. Chapter 12 offers the lowdown on buying shipping 
insurance, and Chapter 16 provides pointers on dealing with transac-
tions that go sour.
Go, Joe: Following an expert on the hunt
I know that not many of us collect G.I. Joes, but by studying what an expert 
looks for in this specialty collectible, we can get a good idea of what we 
should be looking for when purchasing whatever it is that we collect.
Bill looks for specific traits when he buys his very collectible G.I. Joe figures. 
Although his checklist is specific to the G.I. Joe from 1964 to 1969, the infor-
mation here can help you determine your maximum bid on other collectibles 
(or whether an item is even worth bidding on) before an auction begins. As 
you find out in Chapter 7, the more you know before you place a bid, the hap-
pier you’re likely to be when you win. Bill’s checklist can save you consider-
able hassle:
 
✓ Find out the item’s overall condition. For G.I. Joe, look at the painted 
hair and eyebrows. Expect some wear, but overall, a collectible worth 
bidding on should look good.
 
✓ Be sure the item’s working parts are indeed working. Most G.I. Joe 
action figures from this period have cracks on the legs and arms, but the 
joints should move, and any cracks should not be so deep that the legs 
and arms fall apart easily.

83
 Chapter 5: Seek and You Shall Find: Research
 
✓ Ask if the item has its original parts. Because you can’t really examine 
items in detail before buying, e-mail the seller with specific questions 
relating to original or replacement parts. Many G.I. Joe action figures are 
rebuilt from parts that are not from 1964 to 1969. Sometimes the figures 
even have two left or right hands or feet! If you make it clear to the seller 
before you buy that you want a toy with only original parts, you’ll be 
able to make a good case for a refund if the item arrives rebuilt as the 
Six Million Dollar Man. Chapter 7 has plenty of tips on how to protect 
yourself before you bid, and Chapter 16 has tips on what to do if the 
deal goes bad.
 
✓ Ask if the item has original accessories. A G.I. Joe from 1964 to 1969 
should have his original dog tags, boots, and uniform. If any of these 
items are missing, you will have to pay around $25 to replace each 
missing item. If you’re looking to bid on any other collectible, know in 
advance what accessories came as standard equipment with the item, or 
you’ll be paying extra just to bring it back to its original version.
 
✓ Know an item’s value before you bid. A 1964 to 1969 vintage G.I. Joe in 
decent shape, with all its parts, sells for $300 to $400 without its original 
box. (Mint-in-box Joes can sell for thousands of dollars.) If you’re bid-
ding on a G.I. Joe action figure on eBay and you’re in this price range, 
you’re okay. If you get the item for less than $300, congratulations — 
you’ve nabbed a bargain.
 
✓ If you have any questions, ask them before you bid. Check collectors’ 
guides, research similar auctions on eBay, and visit one of eBay’s cat-
egory chat rooms.
Making the grade
Welcome to my version of grade school without the bad lunch. One of the 
keys to establishing value is knowing an item’s condition, typically referred 
to as an item’s grade. Table 5-1 lists the most common grading categories that 
collectors use. The information in this table is used with permission from 
(and appreciation to) Lee Bernstein.
 
Grading is subjective. Mint to one person may be Very Good to another. 
Always ask a seller to define the meaning of the terms used. Also, be aware 
that many amateur sellers may not really know the different definitions of 
grading and may arbitrarily add Mint or Excellent to their item descriptions.

Table 5-1 
Collectibles Grading Categories
Category (Also 
Known As)
Description
Example
Mint (M, Fine, 
Mint-In-Box 
[MIB], 10)
A never-used collectible in perfect 
condition with complete packag-
ing (including instructions, original 
attachments, tags, and so on) iden-
tical to how it appeared on the shelf 
in the original box.
Grandma got a soup 
tureen as a wed-
ding present, never 
opened it, and stuck 
it in her closet for the 
next 50 years.
Near Mint (NM, 
Near Fine, Like-
New, 9)
The collectible is perfect but no 
longer has the original packaging or 
the original packaging is less than 
perfect. Possibly used but must 
appear to be new.
Grandma used the 
soup tureen on her 
25th anniversary, 
washed it gently, and 
then put it back in 
the closet.
Excellent (EX, 8)
Used, but barely. Excellent is just 
a small step under Near Mint, and 
many sellers mistakenly interchange 
the two, but “excellent” can have 
very minor signs of wear. The wear 
must be a normal, desirable part 
of aging or so minor that it’s barely 
noticeable and visible only upon 
close inspection. Damage of any 
sort is not “very minor.” Wear or 
minor normal factory flaws should 
be noted. (Factory flaws are small 
blemishes common at the time of 
manufacture — a tiny air bubble 
under paint, for example.)
Grandma liked to 
ring in the New Year 
with a cup of soup 
for everyone.
Very Good 
(VG, 7)
Looks very good but has defects, 
such as a minor chip or light color 
fading.
If you weren’t looking 
for it, you might miss 
that Grandma’s tureen 
survived the ’64 earth-
quake, as well as 
Uncle Bob’s infamous 
ladle episode.
Good (G, 6)
Used with defects. More than a 
small amount of color loss, chips, 
cracks, tears, dents, abrasions, 
missing parts, and so on.
Grandma had the 
ladies in the neigh-
borhood over for 
soup and bingo 
every month.
Poor (P or G-, 5)
Barely collectible, if at all. Severe 
damage or heavy use. Beyond repair.
Grandma ran a soup 
kitchen.

Finding More Research Information
Experts have been buying, selling, and trading collectible items for years. But 
just because you’re new to eBay doesn’t mean you have to be a newbie for 
decades before you can start bartering with the collecting gods. I wouldn’t 
leave you in the cold like that — and neither would eBay. You can get infor-
mation on items you’re interested in, as well as good collecting tips, right 
at the eBay Web site. Visit the Category-Specific Discussion Boards in the 
Community area. You can also search the rest of the Web or go the old-
fashioned route and check the library (yes, libraries are still around).
 
Keep in mind that there are truly several prices for an item. The retail (or manu-
facturer’s suggested retail price — MSRP) price, the book value, the secondary 
market price (the price charged by resellers when an item is unavailable on the 
primary retail market), and the eBay selling price. The only way to ascertain the 
price an item will go for on eBay is to research completed auctions. Later in this 
chapter, I give you the skinny on how to research a completed auction.
Searching sites online
If you don’t find the information you need on eBay, don’t go ballistic — just 
go elsewhere. Even a site as vast as eBay doesn’t have a monopoly on infor-
mation. The Internet is filled with Web sites and Internet auction sites that 
can give you price comparisons and information about cyberclubs.
Getting professional info from Terapeak Research
If you become an eBay fanatic someday, you 
may find yourself praising the genius of an 
amazing service offered by eBay and Terapeak. 
Terapeak Research allows you to research pric-
ing further back than the 14 days of completed 
listings that the normal eBay search allows. If 
you come across a special or very old item, and 
there are not many on the site, you can use this 
tool to find how much the item has sold for in 
the past few months.
As with most of eBay’s special features, there 
is a charge to use the service. But the price 
is right, and you only have to pay for the ser-
vice as long as you need it. They have several 
levels of search: from 7 to 90 days. I recom-
mend using the 30-day search because in my 
(not so) humble opinion, 90 days is an eternity 
in Internet time — what sold well three months 
ago may be worth bupkis now.

Your home computer can connect to powerful outside servers (really big 
computers on the Internet) that have their own fast-searching systems 
called search engines. Remember, if something is out there and you need 
it, you can find it right from your home PC in a matter of seconds. Here are 
the addresses of some of the Web’s most highly regarded search engines or 
multi-search-engine sites:
 
✓ Google (www.google.com)
 
✓ Live Search (www.live.com)
 
✓ Shopzilla (www.shopzilla.com)
 
✓ Yahoo! (www.yahoo.com)
The basic process of getting information from an Internet search engine is 
pretty simple:
 
1. Type the address of the search-engine site in the Address box of your 
Web browser.
 
 You’re taken to the Web site’s home page.
 
2. Find the text box next to the button labeled Search or something similar.
 
3. In the text box, type a few words indicating what interests you.
 
 Be specific when typing search text. The more precise your entry, the 
better your chances of finding what you want. Look for tips, an 
advanced search option, or help pages on your search engine of choice 
for more information about how to narrow your search.
 
4. Click the Search (or similar) button or press Enter on your keyboard.
 
 The search engine presents you with a list of how many Internet pages 
have the requested information. The list includes brief descriptions and 
links to the first group of pages. You’ll find links to additional listings at 
the bottom if your search finds more listings than can fit on one page. 
(And if you ask for something popular, like Harry Potter, don’t be sur-
prised to get millions of hits.)
 
Always approach information on the Web with caution. Not everyone is the 
expert he or she would like to be. Your best bet is to get lots of different opin-
ions and then boil ’em down to what makes sense to you. And remember — 
caveat emptor. (Is there an echo in here?)
 
Many people out here on the West Coast buy cars on eBay. (Could it be 
because cars are way more expensive here? Maybe.) If you’re researching 
prices to buy a car on eBay, look in your local newspaper to get a good idea of 
prices in your community. Several good sites are on the Internet. My personal 
favorite is www.nadaguides.com. I’ve had many of my friends (and editors) 
visit the various sites, and we’ve settled on this one because it seems to give 
the most accurate and unbiased information.

87
 Chapter 5: Seek and You Shall Find: Research
Finding other sources of information
 
If you’re interested in collecting a particular item, you can get a lot of insider 
collecting information without digging too deep:
 
✓ Go to other places on eBay. eBay’s chat rooms and message boards 
(covered in detail in Chapter 17) are full of insider info. The eBay com-
munity is always willing to educate a newbie. Remember to take advice 
with caution, however, because sometimes the “competition” likes to 
keep the good nuggets of info for themselves.
 
✓ Go to the library. Books and magazines are great sources of info. At 
least one book or one magazine probably specializes in your chosen 
item. For example, if old furniture is your thing, Antiquing For Dummies, 
by Ron Zoglin and Deborah Shouse (Wiley Publishing, Inc.), can clue you 
in to what antiques collectors look for.
 
 If you find an interesting specialty magazine at the library, try entering 
the title in your search engine of choice. You may just find that the mag-
azine has also gone paperless and you can read it online.
 
✓ Go to someone else in-the-know. Friends, clubs, and organizations in 
your area can give you a lot of info. Ask your local antiques dealer about 
clubs you can join and see how much info you end up with.
Looking to Find an Item? Start Your 
eBay Search Engine
The best part about shopping on eBay is that, aside from collectibles, you 
can find just about everything from that esoteric lithium battery to new 
designer dresses (with matching shoes) to pneumatic jackhammers. New or 
used, it’s all here — if you can find it hiding in the (get this!) 6 million new 
daily listings. (According to eBay, 89 million listings are on the site worldwide 
at any given time. That’s a lot of gavels being banged!)
Finding the nuggets (deals) can be like searching for the proverbial needle in 
the haystack. The search secrets in this chapter will put you head and shoul-
ders above your competition for the deals.
eBay has lots of cool ways for you to search for items (sample ’em in Chapter 
3). Although eBay allows you to search by item number, let’s be realistic 
here. Do you remember what I said a few paragraphs back about the number 

88
Part II: Buying Like an Expert 
of active listings? I can’t remember my own phone number, let alone an item 
number (and I never write them down correctly). Look for those numbers 
to get longer and longer as eBay continues to grow in popularity. Four main 
options are the most useful for researching:
 
✓ Search Title (or Search Title and Description)
 
✓ Search Items by Seller
 
✓ Search Items by Bidder
 
✓ Search Items in eBay Stores
You can access the four search options by clicking the Advanced Search link 
to the right of the Search box at the top of any eBay page. Each search option 
can provide a different piece of information to help you find the right item 
from the right seller at the right price.
 
If you plan to repeat specific eBay searches, I recommend that you conduct 
searches often by saving them in your My eBay Saved Searches area (see 
Chapter 18 to find out how). And when you find a particularly juicy item or 
subcategory, bookmark it, or if it’s an item, click Watch This Item (a link on 
the auction page just under the price), or use your My eBay page. (See 
Chapter 18 for more on eBay’s personal shopper.)
Testing, testing . . . how long does a 
search take on eBay?
Having a massive search engine is a matter 
of necessity on eBay — millions of items are 
up for auction at any given time — and often, 
an easy, fast search makes all the difference 
between getting and not getting. After all, time 
is money, and eBay members tend to be movers 
and shakers who don’t like standing still.
So how long do searches really take on eBay? 
I put it to the test. In the Search window of the 
eBay home page, I typed 1933 World’s Fair 
Pennant and let ’er rip.
The search engine went through about 89 mil-
lion general items and World’s Fair items (860 of 
them in 1999, 1,200 items in 2003 and over 2,100 
in 2006!) and gave me my one specific item in 
just 4 seconds. (Now, if the wizards at eBay 
could only figure out a way to find that sock 
that always escapes from clothes dryers, they’d 
really be on to something.)
By the way, in 1999 that slightly wrinkled felt 
pennant got four bids and sold for $17.50; in 
2003, the aging pennant sold for $43.88 with 
eight bids. And today? In 2009, one just went for 
$14.99. Humph, must be the economy.

89
 Chapter 5: Seek and You Shall Find: Research
Using the Search page
When you click the Advanced Search link to the right of the Search box, the 
Search page appears. It’s the most basic of searches (with a few options) and 
the one you’ll be using the most. (To get the really advanced features, you 
must click the Advanced Search link at the very bottom of the page.)
When you use any of the Search options on eBay, the search engine looks for 
every listing (auction or fixed price) that has the words you’re looking for in 
the title or the description (if you specify so). The title (as you may expect) is 
just another word or group of words for what you call the item. For example, 
if you’re looking for an antique sterling iced tea spoon, just type sterling 
iced tea spoon into the search window (see Figure 5-1). If someone is selling 
a sterling iced-teaspoon and used exactly those words in his or her title or 
description, you’re in Fat City.
 
Figure 5-1:
 Using 
Search to 
find sterling 
iced tea 
spoons.
 
Before you click the Search button, know you can narrow your search fur-
ther. If you go to Advanced Search, you have the option of choosing how 
you want the search engine to interpret your search entry. You can have the 
search engine search the title and description for
 
✓ All the words you type
 
✓ Some of the words you type
 
✓ The exact phrase in the order you’ve written it
 
When you’re familiar with the tricks listed later in this chapter, you’ll be able 
to get most of these fancy Search results in one of the many search boxes you 
see littered around the eBay site.

90
Part II: Buying Like an Expert 
In addition to the following, you can find other useful criteria on the 
Advanced Search page (more on this further on):
 
✓ What price range you want to see: Type the price range you’re look-
ing for, and eBay searches the specific range between that low and high 
price. If money is no object, leave this box blank.
 
✓ Words to exclude: If you want to find a sterling iced tea spoon, but you 
don’t want it to be plated silver, exclude the word plated from the drop-
down menu.
 
✓ From sellers: You can exclude (or include) particular sellers. If you’d 
like, you can just search sellers from your Favorite Sellers list. (But 
why?)
 
✓ The payment: You may restrict your search to items that accept PayPal.
 
✓ Within a category: Use this option if you want to limit your search to a 
particular main (or top-level) category, for example, instead of search-
ing all eBay categories. But why? eBay sellers are notorious for making 
listing mistakes and selecting wrong categories. Wait till you see your 
results, and then decide whether you want to narrow things.
 
✓ The item location: You can narrow your search to the United States 
only, North America, or worldwide. Depending on your item, this search 
criterion can help weed out the most esoteric items. If you’re looking for 
hefty items (like an elliptical exercise machine that will probably end 
up as a place to hang clothes) that would cost much too much to ship, 
you can specify how many miles from your zip code (or any zip) you will 
allow the search to extend.
 
✓ The order in which you want your results to appear: If you indicate 
Time: Ending Soonest, the search engine gives you the results so that 
auctions closing soon appear first on the list. Best Match is the eBay 
default, and I recommend you select a sort that better fits your needs. 
Time: Newly Listed lists all the newly listed auctions. Price: Lowest First 
and Price: Highest First list them just that way.
 
✓ Whether you want the search engine to check through item titles 
alone or check both item titles and item descriptions: You will get 
more hits on your search if you select the Search Title and Description 
check box, but you may also get too many items that are out of your 
search range. See “Shortcuts for a quick eBay search,” later in this chap-
ter, for some solid advice.
Okay, now click the Search button (see Figure 5-2). In a few seconds, you see 
the fruits of all the work you’ve been doing. (Wow, you’re not even perspiring.)

You may notice that eBay has a Refine Search box to the left of your results. 
Be sure to click the select related specifics here, because eBay’s search func-
tions can often be a bit temperamental — and you don’t want to miss any 
great deals.
 
Next to item listings you often see pictures, or icons. A golden yellow rising

An easy way to keep track of an item you’re interested in is to click the Watch 
This Item link just below the current bid amount of an item page. The listing 
then appears on your My eBay Watch page, and you can keep your eyes on 
the action.
On the left side of the results page there may a list of categories that your 
search term is listed under, which is a great reference. Next to each category 
is a number in parentheses that tells you how many times your search item 
appears in that category. Figure 5-3 shows a sample of the category spread. 
To view the items appearing only in a particular category, click that category 
(or subcategory) title.

Using the Advanced Search page
The Advanced Search page of the search area throws quite a few more 
options into the package. Don’t be intimidated by this area; you need to 
understand just a few important bells and whistles.
A Completed Items search
A Completed Items search returns results of items that have already ended. 
This is my favorite search option on eBay because you can use it as a stra-
tegic bidding tool. How? If you’re bidding on an item and want to know if the 
prices are likely to go too high for your pocketbook, you can use this search 
option to compare the current price of the item to the selling price of similar 
items from auctions that have already ended.
You can use this tool also if you want to sell an item and are trying to deter-
mine what it’s worth, the demand, and whether this is the right time to list 
the item. (Chapter 10 offers the nuts, bolts, and monkey wrenches you need 
to set up your auction.)

93
 Chapter 5: Seek and You Shall Find: Research
Type your keyword criteria and scroll down the page to the Completed Items 
Only box. Step by step, here’s how to do a Completed Items Only search:
 
1. In the title search field, type the title name or the keywords of the 
item you want to find.
 
2.  Select the Search Including Completed Listings check box to see com-
pleted listings as far back as the eBay search engine will permit.
 
 Currently, you can go back about two weeks.
 
3. Tell eBay how you want the results sorted.
 
 In the Sort By area, choose one of the following options:
 
• Best Match: This is eBay’s magical sort formula that weighs all 
sorts of things, including how a seller lists an item, the seller’s 
feedback, and whether eBay feels the shipping price is appropri-
ate. eBay’s judgment is iffy, at best. (Once eBay suggested I charge 
$5 to ship an item that cost $18 to ship because most sellers sold a 
tiny item from the same manufacturer.)
 
• Time: Ending Soonest: Includes completed listings starting with 
the oldest available (about two weeks).
 
• Time: Newly Listed: Lists the most recently posted listings first.
 
• Distance: Nearest First: Unless you’re looking to see how many of 
your item sold close to you, this is a pretty useless sort. You want 
pricing info!
 
• Price: Lowest First: Lists items from the lowest price attained to 
the highest price paid for an item.
 
• Price: Highest First: Lists completed items from highest to lowest. 
(This is a very useful option when you’re searching for a 1967 
Camaro and you want to buy a car and not a Hot Wheels toy.)
 
4. Click Search.
 
 The search results appear in just a few seconds.
 
An alternate way to find completed items is to run a current auction search 
from any of the little search boxes on almost any eBay page. When the results 
of your auction show up, scroll down to the Preferences box, and below 
Search Options in the left column, click the Completed Items link, as shown in 
Figure 5-4. That way, you can scout out the active auction competition quickly 
before moving on to the completed sales.

An international search
You can select any country (from Afghanistan to Zimbabwe, no kidding!) or 
narrow your search to the United States or Canada, as shown in Figure 5-5. 
Don’t forget that you have to pay for shipping, so if you don’t want to pay 
to ship a heavy Victorian-style fainting sofa from Hungary to Hoboken, New 
Jersey, stick close to home. Also, I’ll bet Egyptian cotton is even better when 
it comes from Egypt. (It is — I’ve bought from an Egyptian seller!)
The Location Search option is pretty much an international version of Search, 
and it’s done the same way. You have the choice of narrowing your country 
search to countries that offer an item, and to which countries they ship to. 
(Most eBay sellers will ship to the United States).
A seller search
The By Seller link in the search area, shown in Figure 5-6, gives you a list of 
all the items a seller is selling, and it’s a great way for you to keep tabs on 
people you have successfully done business with in the past. The By Seller 
page is also a strategy that eBay users use to assess the reputation of a seller. 
You can find out more about selling strategies in Chapter 9.

Finding items by keywords for multiple sellers
If you’re looking for a specific item from a group of sellers, you can enter the 
search information in the bottom half of the By Seller Advanced Search page. 
You may need to perform this type of search after you settle into shopping 
on eBay and have several sellers that you like doing business with (or alter-
natively, you can exclude sellers you prefer not to do business with). With 
this method, you can limit the search for a particular item to just the sellers 
you want, rather than tens of thousands of sellers.

Free hanging chads . . .
eBay gives you the opportunity to have the same 
fine museum-quality items as the Smithsonian 
Institution. In November 2001, the Palm Beach 
County Board of County Commissioners found 
themselves in a bit of a pickle. Due to the infa-
mous Presidential election of November 7, 2000 — 
fraught with hanging, pregnant, and dimpled 
chads — the announcement of the election 
winner was delayed for an unprecedented 37 
days. As a result of this election, the Florida 
legislature outlawed the future use of punch-card 
voting systems — all Florida counties had to move 
to more stable, state-approved voting machines.
Palm Beach County chose to move to a touch-
screen type of voting device, which cost its 
residents over $14 million. What to do with the 
old historic punch-card voting machines? Yep, 
donate one to the Smithsonian — and auc-
tion the rest off on eBay. Palm Beach County 
donated machine #1 to the Auction for America; 
it netted $4,550.01 for the Twin Towers fund.
The rest? Well, the Palm Beach County folks 
should have read this book. They ran a Dutch 
auction for 3,055 of the basic voting packages, 
with a starting bid of $300. Included with the 
voting machine was the iniquitous “butter-
fly ballot” with official stylus; a brass plaque 
certifying that it was used in the November 7 
election; a Certificate of Authenticity signed by 
Theresa LePore, Palm Beach County Supervisor 
of Elections; 25 demonstrator punch cards for 
playing polling place at home; a signed pho-
tograph of the folks in charge of recounting 
the ballots: Palm Beach County Supervisor of 
Elections Theresa LePore, Palm Beach County 
Commissioner Carol Roberts, and Judge 
Charles Burton; and “any chads which are in 
the machine from previous elections.” What a 
package! There also were 569 Premier pack-
ages, which included an Official Ballot box, 
starting at $600.
In the 10-day auctions (run at the same time!), 
Palm Beach County sold 78 of the Premier 
packages and 389 of the Basic voting-machine 
packages. I called the County Commissioner’s 
office to find out why my voting machine hadn’t 
arrived and asked when the rest would be auc-
tioned. I was assured they would be put back up 
on eBay auction, but at a higher starting bid.
Palm Beach County should have followed the 
strategies in this book, like some smart eBay 
sellers did. Soon after, one of the basic pack-
ages sold after a 7-day auction for $670. Other 
entrepreneurial sellers have been selling voting 
machines from counties other than Palm Beach 
on eBay. Unfortunately for those who purchase 
them, only the Palm Beach County machines 
had the infamous, butterfly ballot.
 
When you find a seller who you want to continue doing business with, you can 
add his or her link to your My eBay Saved Sellers area. Just click a link to 
Watch This Item on the item page. It will then appear on your My eBay page, in 
the Organize, Saved Sellers area. You can add up to 100 sellers in this area, 
and can search their sales with a click of your mouse!

A bidder search
The Bidder search option is unique because sellers and buyers alike use 
it when an auction is going on to figure out their best strategies. After all, 
money is the name of the game. For information on conducting a Bidder 
search, take a look at Chapter 7.
Shortcuts for a Quick eBay search
After you become familiar with each of eBay’s search options, you need a crash 
course in what words to type into those nice little boxes. Too little information 
and you may not find your item. Too much and you’re overwhelmed with infor-
mation. If you’re really into bean-bag toys, for example, you may be looking for 
Ty’s Tabasco the Bull. But if you just search for Tabasco, you’ll get swamped 
with results ranging from hot sauce to advertisements.
Some simple tricks can help narrow your eBay search results when you’re 
searching from pages other than the main Search page (where you don’t find 
all the searching bells and whistles). Table 5-2 has the details.

“Wonder Woman” returns items 
about the comic book/TV heroine. 
Quotes don’t make the search term 
case sensitive. Using either upper-

Parentheses
Searches for both

political (pin,pins) searches for 
political pin and political pins.
Here are additional tips to help you narrow any eBay search:
 
✓ Don’t worry about capitalization: You can capitalize proper names or 
leave them lowercase; the search engine doesn’t care.
 
✓ Don’t use and, a, an, or, or the: Called noise words in search lingo, these 
words are interpreted as part of your search. So if you want to find some-
thing from The Sound of Music and you type the sound of music, you may 
not get any results. Most sellers drop noise words from the beginning of 
an item title when they list it, just as libraries drop noise words when they 
alphabetize books. So make your search for sound music. An even more 
precise search would be “sound of music” (in quotes).
 
✓ Search within specific categories: This type of search narrows your 
results because you search only one niche of eBay — just the specific 
area you want. For example, if you want to find Tabasco the Bull, start 
at the home page and, under the Categories heading, click Toys and 
Bean Bag. The only problem with searching in a specific category is that 
sometimes an item can be in more than one place. For example, if you’re 
searching for a Mickey Mouse infant snuggly in the Disney category, you 
may miss it because the item might be listed in infant wear. It’s best not 
to limit yourself to a category because some of the best deals are miscat-
egorized by sellers. What makes them such a good deal is that not every-
one can find them. But you know better.

Use the asterisk symbol often to locate misspellings. I’ve often found some 
great deals by finding items incorrectly posted by the sellers. Here are a few 
examples:
 
✓ Rodri* In this search I look for items by the famous Cajun artist George 
Rodrigue. His Blue Dog paintings are world-renowned and very valuable. 
By using this search, I managed to purchase a signed Blue Dog litho-
graph for under $200. (I resold it on eBay later that year for $900!)
 
✓ Alumi* tree Remember the old aluminum Christmas trees from the ’60s? 
They’ve had quite a resurgence in popularity these days. You can buy 
these “antiques” in stores for hundreds of dollars . . . or you can buy one 
on eBay for half the price. You can find them even cheaper if the seller 
can’t spell aluminum. . . .
 
✓ Cemet* plot If you’re looking for that final place to retire, eBay has some 
great deals. Unfortunately, sellers haven’t narrowed down whether they 
want to spell it cemetery or cemetary. This search will find both.
After studying these examples, I’m sure you can think of many more 
instances in which your use of the asterisk can help you find the deals. Be 
sure to e-mail me and let me know when you find something special in this 
way!
Finding eBay Members: The Gang’s 
All Here
With millions of eBay users on the loose, you may think tracking folks down 
is hard. Nope. eBay’s powerful search engine kicks into high gear to help you 
find other eBay members in seconds.
Here’s how to find people or get info on them from eBay:
 
1. From the top of most eBay pages, click the Advanced Search link.
 
 This action takes you to the main Search page, where two links appear 
on the left side of the page, under Members.
 
2. In the box on the left side of the page, click the Find a Member link.
 
 This link takes you to the main Find Members page, where you can 
search for other members of the community. When you find the 
member, you can see his or her About Me page (see Chapter 14 to find 
out how to create your own personal eBay Web page). You can also get 

101
 Chapter 5: Seek and You Shall Find: Research
a look at the feedback profile of a user (see Chapter 4 for details about 
feedback), find user ID histories of fellow eBay members (which comes 
in handy when you’re bidding on items, as Chapter 7 avows), or get con-
tact information when you’re involved in a transaction.
 
If you’re involved in a transaction with another eBay member and feel that you 
need to contact the individual by phone, click the Find Contact Information 
link, which is under the Members heading on the left side of the screen. On 
that page you’ll need to type the transaction number along with the other per-
son’s user ID. eBay compares this data with yours, and if you are indeed 
involved in a transaction with each other, eBay e-mails you the other person’s 
phone number (along with the person’s full name, city, and state). Your con-
tact information is, in turn, sent to the other party.
 
Clicking the arrow in the Favorite Searches drop-down box at the top right of 
the page allows you to scroll through your My eBay Favorite Searches. You can 
tell eBay about the items you’re looking for, and it does automatic searches for 
you. You can also have eBay e-mail you when auctions that match your descrip-
tions crop up. (Chapter 18 gives you more info on how this works.)

rowsing different categories of eBay, looking for nothing in particular, 
you spot that must-have item lurking among other Elvis paraphernalia 
in the Collectibles category. Sure, you could live without that faux gold 
Elvis pocket watch, but life would be so much sweeter with it. And even if it 
doesn’t keep good time, at least it’ll be right twice a day.
When you bid for items on eBay, you can get that same thrill that you would 
get at Sotheby’s or Christie’s for a lot less money, and the items you win 
are likely to be slightly more practical than an old Dutch masterpiece you’re 
afraid to leave at the framer’s. (Hey, you have to have a watch, and Elvis is — 
er, was — the King.)
In this chapter, I give you the lowdown about the types of auctions and 
fixed-price listings available on eBay and a rundown of the nuts and bolts of 
bidding strategies. I also share some tried-and-true tips that’ll give you a leg 
up on the competition. Hey, I buy almost everything on eBay.
The Item Listing Page
At any given point, you have more than a million pages of items that you can 
look at on eBay, making item pages the heart (better yet, the skeleton) of 
eBay listings. All item pages on eBay — whether auctions, fixed-price items, 

104
Part II: Buying Like an Expert 
or Buy It Now items — look about the same. For example, Figure 6-1 shows 
a conventional listing page with a Buy It Now option; Figure 6-2 shows a 
fixed-price sale; and Figure 6-3 shows a fixed-price sale with a twist — the 
Make Offer option. All item pages show the listing title at the top, bidding or 
buying info in the middle, and seller info below that. Below all this is a tabbed 
area that displays the complete description of the item, along with a tab for 
shipping and payment information.
 
Figure 6-1: 
Here’s one 
of my typical 
auctions, 
featuring 
the Buy It 
Now button, 
the Place 
Bid button, 
and PayPal 
payment 
options.
 
 
Figure 6-2: 
In a fixed-
price sale, 
you see the

button and

button.

 Chapter 6: Shopping eBay: The Basics 
 
Figure 6-3: 
Some 
sellers 
offer a

option on 
their fixed-
price sales.
 
The listing types have some subtle differences. Some auctions feature multiple 
pictures at the top left of the page, and others don’t, depending on how the 
seller sets up the sale page. (Some sellers insert pictures within the item 
description to save money on listing fees.) Some listings have set item specifics 
in the description (as shown in Figure 6-4). This area is set up by eBay and 
filled in by the seller to give you a snapshot description of the item for sale. 
If you search for an item and end up finding it available in a fixed-price sale, 
you won’t see the Place Bid button (as shown in Figure 6-1). But overall, the 
look and feel of these pages is the same.

When you come to a fixed-price listing with the Make Offer option, you have 
the ability to make your own offer on the item. I talk about the best ways to 
make your offer later in this chapter.
Here’s a list of stuff you see as you scroll down on a typical item page:
 
✓ Item title and number: The title and number identify the item. Keep 
track of this info for inquiries later. You find the item number in the box 
under the Seller Info area on the right.
 
 If you’re interested in a particular type of item, note the key words used 
in the title (you’re likely to see them again in future titles). Doing so 
helps you narrow future searches.
 
✓ Item category: Located just above the item, you can click the category 
listing and do some comparison shopping. (Chapter 5 gives more 
searching strategies.)
 
✓ Current bid: This field in an auction indicates the dollar amount the 
bidding has reached, which changes throughout the auction as people 
place bids. If no bids have been placed on the item, this field is called 
Starting bid.
 
 Sometimes, next to the current dollar amount in an auction, you see 
(Reserve not met). This statement means that the seller has set a reserve 
price for the item — a secret price that must be reached before the seller 
will sell the item. If you don’t see this note on a listing item page, don’t 
be alarmed. Most auctions don’t have reserve prices. Also, the moment 
a reserve is met, the indicator disappears.
 
✓ Buy It Now price: If you want the item immediately and the price quoted 
in this area is okay with you, click the Buy It Now link, which takes you 
to a page where you can complete your purchase. This is also an option 
in an auction listing, as in Figure 6-1. In this case you can still place a bid 
for the lower bid price and the listing will convert to an auction format.
 
✓ Quantity: This field appears only in a multiple item fixed-price sale. It 
tells you how many items are available. If you see a number other than 
1 in this field, it means that there is only one of the item left for sale (the 
others have been sold). You can be sure it’s a fixed-price sale because 
you have no opportunity to bid; you can just use the Buy It Now option 
for whatever quantity of the item you desire. You’ll be prompted for a 
quantity when you buy. But if a seller is selling two Elvis watches for 
the price of one, the item quantity still shows up as 1 (as in 1 set of 2 
watches).
 
✓ Time left: The official clock keeps ticking down as time passes. When 
the item gets down to the last hour of the auction, eBay automatically 
starts an interactive clock that counts the minutes and seconds. This 
field tells you the time remaining in this particular auction.

107
 Chapter 6: Shopping eBay: The Basics 
 
 Timing is the key in an eBay bidding strategy (covered in Chapter 7). 
Because eBay’s world headquarters is in California, eBay uses Pacific 
Standard Time or Pacific Daylight Time as the standard, depending on 
the season. Not a major deal if you live on the West Coast like I do, but it 
can be an issue if you live anywhere else.
 
✓ Bid history: This field (below the item title) tells you how many bids 
have been placed. To use the number of bids to your advantage, you 
have to read between the lines. You can determine just how “hot” an 
item is by comparing the number of bids the item has received over 
time. Based on the amount of interest in an item, you can create a time 
strategy (which I talk about later in this chapter). If you want to see the 
starting bid, you have to click the See History link next to the number of 
bids (refer to Figure 6-1). By clicking there you can also find out who is 
bidding and what date and time bids were placed. The dollar amount of 
each bid is shown in the bidding history, but bidders’ maximum bids are 
kept secret.
 
 Bidding is more an art than a science. Sometimes an item gets no bids 
because everyone’s waiting until the last second to bid. You see a flurry 
of activity as bidders all try to outbid each other (called sniping, which 
Chapter 7 explains). But that’s all part of the fun of eBay.
 
✓ Item location: This field tells you at the very least the country where the 
seller is located, and you may also see more specific info, such as the 
city and geographic area where the seller is. (What you see depends on 
how detailed the seller wants to be.)
 
 Factor in the geographic location of a seller when you consider bidding 
on an item. Knowing the exact location of an item can help you quickly 
calculate approximately how long it will take for the item to get to you. 
(Chapter 10 tackles that subject.) Also, if you buy from someone in your 
own state, you may also have to pay sales tax on your purchase. If the 
item is in Australia, for example, and you’re in Vermont, you may decide 
that you don’t really need that wrought-iron doorstop. (Remember, you 
pay the shipping charges.)
 
✓ Watch This Item: Click this link to magically add the item to the Watch 
section of your My eBay page. From there, you can keep an eye on the 
progress of the auction — without bidding. If you haven’t signed in, you 
have to type your user ID and password before you can save the auction 
to your My eBay page.
 
 Be sure to use the Watch This Item feature. Organization is the name 
of the game on eBay, especially if you plan to bid on multiple auctions 
while you’re running auctions of your own. I figure you’re in the bidding 
game to win, so start keeping track of items now.

108
Part II: Buying Like an Expert 
 
✓ Share: You can tip off a friend on a good find, get some advice from an 
antiques or collecting expert, or run the auction by a friend who’s been 
around the eBay block a few times, and ask for strategy advice. (You 
find this link below the Seller Info box).
 
✓ Print: If you’d like to print a copy of the listing for reference, click here 
to get an abbreviated version of the page.
 
 If you want a complete printout of a listing, use the print feature of your 
Internet browser. That way you will get the entire description for your 
records.
 
✓ Get alerts: Using a sniping service is more my style, but Get alerts is 
great for those do-it-yourselfers out there. If you really enjoy the thrill 
of the bid, the Get alerts option enables you to receive a notification if 
you’re outbid and (or) when the auction is about to end. You will see 
this option on a page only after you’ve placed a bid. There are three 
versions of notices:
 
• Text messages: You can get a text message directly to your 
cellphone. You will be charged $0.25 for up to ten messages per 
item. After ten messages for an item, the charges increase another 
$0.25 for the next ten messages. The charges appear on your 
mobile phone bill as eBay services.
 
 Keep in mind that unless you have unlimited text messaging 
service on your cellphone, you can also be charged for receiving a 
text message.
 
• Instant messages: You can opt to receive an IM on your own 
account from AIM (AOL Instant Messenger), Yahoo! Messenger, 
MSN Messenger, or Skype. You’re not charged for the IM service, 
so if you have a Blackberry or a Sidekick and you don’t want to 
miss any bidding action, this could be a great option for you. Also, 
with the IM service, you can bid again from a link that comes along 
with the Outbid alert.
 
• E-mails: Yes, Good old fashioned e-mails can be sent to you for 
these notifications as well!
 
 To let eBay know how you’d like to receive your notifications, go to your 
My eBay page. Select My Account and Notification Preferences. Fill in 
your preferences there.
 
✓ Seller Info: This area gives you links to information about the seller. 
Know thy seller ranks right after caveat emptor as a phrase that pays on 
eBay. As I tell you nearly a million times in this book, read the feedback 
rating! (Okay, maybe not a million — it would drive the editors bonkers.) 
Human beings come in all shapes, sizes, and levels of honesty, and like 
any community, eBay has its share of good folks and bad folks. Your 
best defense is to read the seller’s feedback. You’ll see several things in 
the Seller Info box (as shown in Figure 6-5).

109
 Chapter 6: Shopping eBay: The Basics 
 
Figure 6-5: 
Lots of data 
on the seller 
can be 
accessed 
from here.
 
 
✓ Feedback rating: This is the number next to the seller’s ID. Click the 
number to view his or her eBay ID card and entire feedback history. 
Read, read, and reread all the feedback (hey, I’m one feedback reference 
closer to a million!) to make sure you feel comfortable doing business 
with this person. Clicking the link (or the Read Feedback Profile link) will 
allow you to view the following information:
 
• Positive feedback percentage: The eBay computers cipher this 
figure. It’s derived from all the positive and negative feedback that 
a user receives.
 
• Read Feedback Profile: Clicking here will do the same thing as 
clicking the number next to the seller’s ID.
 
• Ask seller a question: Clicking this link hooks you up with eBay’s 
e-mail system. You can ask the seller a question regarding the item 
here. Clicking the tiny telephone receiver icon (if available) will 
begin a Skype voice call to the seller. Clicking the tiny Chat icon 
will open a chat window with the seller if he or she is online.
 
• View seller’s other items: This link takes you to a page that lists all 
the seller’s current auctions and fixed-price sales.
 
 If the seller has an eBay store, a link to it appears next. I give you a 
step-by-step guide on how these links work later in this chapter.
 
✓ Description tab: You see a tabbed bar of one to three tabs. The opening 
(default) is the Description tab. The other two tabs are the Shipping and 
Payments tab and, in some cases, the Related Items and Services tab. 
Scroll down and always read the entire item description information 
carefully before bidding.

110
Part II: Buying Like an Expert 
 
✓ Shipping and Payments tab: Click this tab, shown in Figure 6-6, to see 
the details on shipping. You see
 
• Who pays (remember that on eBay, it’s usually the buyer).
 
• Whether insurance is offered.
 
• Which states have to pay sales tax (if any).
 
• Whether the seller is willing to ship to your area. (Sometimes 
sellers won’t ship internationally, and they’ll let you know here.)
 
 Also, always check the item description for other shipping information 
and terms.
 
Figure 6-6: 
Check the

and 
payment 
boxes below 
the item 
description 
to find 
out about 
additional 
costs, 
shipping, 
and taxes 
that may 
apply when 
you buy.
 
 
 If the item doesn’t have flat price shipping, the seller may have conveniently 
included eBay’s shipping calculator in this area. eBay knows your zip code, 
so you’re presented with the shipping cost to your location.
 
 The Payment details area tells you the payment methods that the seller 
accepts: PayPal, Moneybookers, Paymate, Propay, or their own merchant 
credit card service. Often, you are directed to read the item description for 
more details. I explain how to read item descriptions later in this chapter.
 
✓ Related Items and Services: Click this tab and eBay may list similar items 
to the item you’re viewing. Or they may not; it’s catch as catch can.

111
 Chapter 6: Shopping eBay: The Basics 
Beating the Devil in the Details
As with any sale — whether you find it at Joe’s Hardware, Bloomingdale’s, or 
Target — carefully check out what you’re buying. The item page gives you 
links to help you know what you’re bidding on — and who you’re potentially 
buying from. If you take advantage of these features, you won’t have many 
problems. But if you ignore these essential tips, you may end up unhappy 
with what you buy, who you buy it from, and how much you spent.
Read the item description carefully
The item description is the most critical item on the auction item page. This 
is where the seller lists the details about the item being sold. Read this page 
carefully and pay very close attention to what is, and isn’t, written.
Don’t judge a book by its cover — but do judge a seller by his or her item 
description. If the sentences are succinct, detailed, and well structured, 
you’re most likely dealing with an individual who planned and executed the 
listing with care. It takes time and effort to post a good listing. If you see 
huge lapses in grammar, convoluted sentences, and misspellings, you may be 
gonna get burnt! Make sure that you feel comfortable dealing with this person; 
decide for yourself whether he or she is out to sell junk for a quick buck or is 
selling on eBay for the long term.
If additional pictures are available, take a good look. The majority of eBay 
sellers jazz up their auctions with several photos of their items. The seller 
should answer a few general questions in the item description. If these 
questions aren’t answered, that doesn’t necessarily mean that the seller’s 
disreputable — only that if you’re really interested, you should e-mail the 
seller and get those answers before you bid. In particular, ask questions like 
these:
 
✓ Is the item new or used?
 
✓ Is the item a first edition or a reprint? New or used? An original or a 
reissue? (See Chapter 5 for tips on how to assess what you’re buying.)
 
✓ Is the item in its original packaging? Does it still have the original tags?
 
✓ Is the item under warranty?
 
Most sellers spell out in their item descriptions exactly how the item should 
be paid for and shipped. Check the Shipping and Payments tab, which is 
next to the Description tab, to see whether an actual shipping charge 
applies — and if so, how much it’ll cost you. Some sellers use eBay’s 
incredibly convenient shipping calculator. Here are a few other things to 
consider regarding your item:

112
Part II: Buying Like an Expert 
 
✓ If you’re in a hurry to get the item, are delays likely? If so, what sort and 
how long?
 
✓ Can the seller guarantee you a refund if the item is broken or doesn’t 
work upon delivery?
 
✓ What condition is the item in? Is it broken, scratched, flawed, or mint?
 
 Most experienced eBay buyers know that, depending on the item, a 
tiny scratch here or there may be worth the risk of making a bid. But 
a scratch or two may affect your bidding price. (Look at Chapter 5 for 
more expert advice for buying collectibles.)
 
✓ Is this item the genuine article or a reproduction, and if it’s the real deal, 
does the seller have papers or labels certifying its authenticity?
 
✓ What size is the item, and how much does it weigh? (That life-size 
fiberglass whale may not fit in your garage. That baby grand piano might 
cost a lot to ship from Anchorage, so you need to factor in the cost of 
shipping when you consider how much you’re willing to bid.)
 
If you win the item and find out the seller lied in the description, you have the 
right to request to return the item. But, if you win the item and discover that 
you overlooked a detail in the description, the seller isn’t obligated to take the 
item back. If the seller won’t take the item back, you may be able to apply for a 
refund through PayPal’s Buyer Protection.
 
The seller is obligated to describe the item honestly and in detail, so if your 
questions aren’t answered in the item description, for goodness’ sake, e-mail 
the seller for the facts. If a picture is available, is it clear enough that you can 
see any flaws? You can always ask the seller to e-mail you a picture taken from 
another angle.
Get the scoop on the seller
I can’t tell you enough that the single most important way you can make 
an auction go well is to know who you’re dealing with. Apparently, the eBay 
folks agree; they enable you to get info on the seller right from the auction 
item page. I recommend that you take advantage of the links offered there. 
(Chapter 5 demonstrates how to conduct a thorough By Seller search.) To 
get the full scoop on a seller, here’s what you need to do:
 
✓ Click the number beside the seller’s user ID to get his or her feedback 
history. Click the Me link (if there is one) next to the seller to view the 
seller’s About Me page. This page frequently gives you a good deal more 
information about the seller. (To set up your own free About Me page on 
eBay, check out Chapter 14.)

113
 Chapter 6: Shopping eBay: The Basics 
 
✓ Make note if you see the PowerSeller icon next to the seller’s name. This 
icon means he or she is an eBay seller who has met certain stringent 
certifications. (For more on PowerSellers, see Chapter 20.)
 
✓ Click the View seller’s other items link to take a look at what else that 
person is selling. (If you win more than one auction from a seller, he or 
she will often combine the shipping costs.) Check the seller’s feedback 
(message sound familiar?).
Check the seller’s Feedback Profile. All together, now — check the feedback. 
(Is there an echo in here?) What you will find are (for the most part) the 
honest thoughts and comments of buyers from previous transactions. No 
eBay user has control over the comments that others make, and feedback 
sticks to you like your permanent record from high school.
Read the feedback — the good, the bad, and the neutral — and unless you’re 
prepared to kiss your money goodbye, I’ve found it safer not to buy from a 
seller who has a large percentage of negative comments — and eBay won’t 
allow them to sell on the site for long.
 
eBay, like life, is full of shades of gray. Some sellers are unfairly hit with 
negative comments for something that wasn’t their fault. If you suspect that 
a seller has received a bum rap (after you’ve read all his or her positive 
feedback), be sure to read the seller’s response. (Look at Chapter 4 for more 
on reading and leaving feedback.)
 
Although scoping out an eBay Feedback Profile is just that fast, just that simple, 
you still need to take the time to read the feedback. (There’s that echo again. 
Good thing it’s a wise echo.) Someone with 500 positive feedback messages 
may look like a good seller, but if you take a closer look, you may find that his 
or her ten most-recent feedback messages are negative.
View the seller’s other items
To find out what other sales the seller has going on eBay, all you have to do 
is click the corresponding link on the item page; you’re whisked away to a list 
of the other item pies the seller has a finger in. If the seller has no other items 
going and has no current feedback, you may want to do a more thorough 
investigation and conduct a By Seller search that will show you all that 
person’s completed listings in the last 30 days. (See Chapter 5 for details.)
Ask seller a question
If anything about the auction is unclear to you, remember this one word: ask. 
Find out all the details about that item before you bid. If you wait until you’ve 
won the item before you ask questions, you may get stuck with something 
you don’t want. Double-checking may save you woe and hassle later.

You can find out more about payment options, shipping charges, insurance, 
and other fun stuff in Chapters 8 and 12.
 
If you’re bidding on a reserve-price auction, don’t be afraid to e-mail the seller 
and ask what the reserve is. Yeah, reserves are mostly kept secret, but there’s 
no harm in asking — and many sellers gladly tell you.
To ask a seller a question, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Ask Seller a Question link on the item page.
 
 You’re presented with the Ask the Seller a Question form.
 
2. Fill in the message area and politely fire off your questions; then click 
Send Message.
 
 Expect to hear back from the seller within a day. If it takes the seller 
more than a day or two to respond (unless it’s over the weekend — eBay 
sellers are entitled to a little rest), and you get no explanation for the 
delay, think twice before shelling out your cash.
 
You can always change your user ID, but your past life (in the form of feedback 
messages) stays with you on eBay. Along with your feedback from your 
previous user ID, all your previous user IDs are listed as well in a user ID 
history search from the eBay Search page.
How Swede it is!
A savvy eBay user I know benefited from a major 
seller error. The seller titled his auction “Swede 
Star Trek Cast Jacket.” My friend checked 
out the item description and found that it was 
written with bad spelling and incoherent 
grammar, so she e-mailed the seller for more 
information. The seller explained that the jacket 
was a suede cast jacket given as a wrap gift 
to the cast and crew of the movie Star Trek: 
Generations. He had won it in a local radio 
contest, and it was brand new. Because of 
the seller’s mistake, only one bidder bid on this 
lovely green suede (silk-lined!) jacket, which 
my friend picked up for $150. Because of its Star 
Trek connection, the jacket is worth upwards 
of $400 to collectors. So study the item page 
carefully. You may get lucky and find that errors 
can work to your benefit. (And a word to the 
wise: Check your own spelling and grammar 
carefully when you put an item up for sale.)

115
 Chapter 6: Shopping eBay: The Basics 
Factoring in the Extras
Before you think about placing a bid on an item, you should consider the 
financial obligation you have to make. In every case, the maximum bid you 
place won’t be all you spend on an item. I recommend that you look closely 
at the payment methods that the seller is willing to accept and also factor in 
shipping, insurance, and escrow costs (if any). If you have only $50 to spend, 
you shouldn’t place a $50 bid on a fragile item that will be shipped a long 
distance because often the buyer (that would be you) pays for shipping and 
insurance. In addition, if you live in the same state as the seller, you may 
have to pay sales tax if the seller is running an official business.
Payment methods
Several payment options are available, but eBay only allows sellers to show 
electronic payment methods. If you want to make a payment in the form of a 
check or money order, use the Ask the seller a question link — and ask! The 
seller is not required to accept any other form of payment but PayPal or one 
of the other electronic payment options (ProPay, Paymate, Moneybookers or 
a merchant account). These are the forms of payment available to you:
 
✓ Credit card: Paying with a credit card is a favorite payment option for 
many buyers, one that’s offered mainly by businesses and dealers. I like 
paying with credit cards because they’re fast and efficient. In addition, 
using a credit card offers you another ally, your credit card company, 
if you’re not completely satisfied with the transaction. Credit cards can 
also be used for payment through the other electronic payment options 
a seller may offer. I still prefer PayPal.
 
 Sometimes sellers use a friend’s company to run credit card payments 
for eBay auctions. So don’t be surprised if you buy a vintage Tonka 
bulldozer and your credit card is billed from Holly’s Hair-o-Rama.
 
✓ PayPal: I pay for all my eBay purchases through PayPal. Owned by 
eBay, PayPal is the largest Internet-wide payment network. Sellers who 
accept PayPal are identified with a special icon in the Seller Information 
box (as well as a large PayPal logo in the Payment method area below 
the description) and accept MasterCard, Visa, American Express, and 
Discover as well as electronic checks and debits. The service is integrated 
directly into eBay auctions, so paying is a mouse click away.

116
Part II: Buying Like an Expert 
 
 After you register with PayPal to pay for an item, PayPal debits your 
credit card or your bank checking account (or your account — if you 
have earned some money from sales) and sends the payment to the 
seller’s account. PayPal does not charge buyers to use the service. 
Buyers can use PayPal to pay any seller within the United States (and 
around the world in over 55 countries). Some international bidders can 
pay for their eBay auctions from sellers in the United States. To see a 
current list of PayPal’s international services, go to
www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=p/gen/approved_countries-outside
 
 PayPal deposits the money directly into the seller’s checking or savings 
account. The service charges the seller a small transaction fee, so the 
seller absorbs the cost.
 
 Your credit card information is known only to the PayPal service. The 
seller never sees your credit card info. Another major advantage is that 
you have protection behind you when you use PayPal. And you have 
the right to dispute charges if the item arrives damaged or doesn’t show 
up at all. When you use PayPal to pay for a qualified eBay item from a 
Verified PayPal member, you are covered by PayPal’s Buyer Protection 
program for the full purchase price. To find out whether your item is 
protected in this program, look for the information below the pricing 
information (refer to Figure 6-3).
 
 For more details, check out the PayPal Web site (www.paypal.com).
 
✓ Money order: My second-favorite method of receiving payment is the 
money order. Sellers love money orders because they don’t have to wait 
for a check to clear. When you ask to pay with a money order, they will 
almost always say yes.
 
 Money orders are the same as cash. As soon as the seller gets your 
money order, he or she has no reason to wait to send the item. You can 
buy money orders at banks, supermarkets, convenience stores, and 
your local post office. The average cost is about a dollar. If you’re 
purchasing an item that’s being shipped internationally, you can pay 
with an international money order from the U.S. Postal Service, which 
costs about $3.00.
 
✓ Personal or cashier’s check: Again, you have to ask. Paying by check 
is convenient but has its drawbacks. Most sellers won’t ship you the 
goods until after your check clears, which means a lag time of a couple 
of weeks or more. Unfortunately, that means that while the seller is 
waiting for your check to clear, your merchandise is collecting dust 
in a box somewhere. This is no fun for you or for the seller. If a seller 
takes personal checks, you’ll have to e-mail the seller and ask. Cashier’s 
checks are available at your bank but often cost much more than a 
money order. It’s not worth the extra money — have fun and buy more 
eBay items instead.

117
 Chapter 6: Shopping eBay: The Basics 
 
 Before you send a personal check, make sure that you have enough 
money to cover your purchase. A bounced check can earn you negative 
feedback — too many negative transactions will bounce you off eBay.
 
 The good news about checks is that you can track whether or not 
they’ve been cashed. Personal checks leave a paper trail that you can 
follow if a problem occurs later on. The bad news about checks is that 
you’re revealing personal information, such as your bank account 
number, to a stranger.
 
✓ C.O.D.: I know of no eBay seller who will accept your request for an item 
to be mailed via cash on delivery.
 
Most business on eBay is conducted in U.S. dollars. If you happen to buy an 
item from an international seller, you may need to convert American dollars 
into another currency. eBay has a currency converter, located at the following 
URL:
pages.ebay.com/services/buyandsell/currencyconverter.html
Just select your choice of currency, type the amount, and click Perform 
Currency Conversion.
 
Never use a form of payment that doesn’t let you keep a paper trail. Don’t 
wire money, and never send cash in the mail! If a seller asks for cash, quote 
Nancy Reagan and just say no. Occasionally, I hear of international buyers 
sending U.S. greenbacks in the mail. But if a seller asks for cash, chances 
are that you may never see the item or your money again. Oh, yeah, here’s 
something else — if a seller asks you to send your payment to a post office 
box, get a phone number. Many legitimate sellers use post office boxes, but so 
do the bad guys.
Using an escrow service
Even though most sales on eBay are for items that cost $100 or less, using 
an escrow service comes in handy on occasion — such as when you buy a 
big-ticket item or something extremely rare. Escrow is a service that allows a 
buyer and seller to protect a transaction by placing the money in the hands 
of a neutral third party until a specified set of conditions are met. Sellers note 
in their item descriptions if they’re willing to accept escrow. If you’re nervous 
about sending a lot of money to someone you don’t really know (like a user 
named Clumsy who has only two feedback comments and is shipping you 
bone china from Broken Hill, Australia), consider using an escrow company.

118
Part II: Buying Like an Expert 
 
Using an escrow company is worthwhile only if the item you’re bidding on is 
expensive, rare, fragile, or traveling a long distance. If you’re spending less 
than $300.00 for the item, I recommend that you purchase insurance from 
your shipper instead — just in case. eBay has a partnership with Escrow.com 
to handle eBay auction escrow sales in Canada and the United States. After an 
auction closes, the buyer sends the payment to the escrow company. After 
the escrow company receives the money, it e-mails the seller to ship the 
merchandise. After the buyer receives the item, he or she has an agreed-on 
period of time to look it over. If everything’s okay, the escrow service sends 
the payment to the seller. If the buyer is unhappy with the item, he or she 
must ship it back to the seller. When the escrow service receives word from 
the seller that the item has been returned, the service returns the payment to 
the buyer (minus the escrow company’s handling fee, of course).
Before you start an escrow transaction, make sure that you and the seller 
agree on these terms (use e-mail to sort it out). Here are three questions 
about escrow that you should know the answers to before you bid:
 
✓ Who pays the escrow fee? (Normally, the buyer does, though sometimes 
the buyer and seller split the cost.)
 
✓ How long is the inspection period? (Routinely, it’s two business days 
after receipt of the merchandise.)
 
✓ Who pays for return shipping if the item is rejected? (The buyer 
usually pays.)
Shipping and insurance costs
Don’t let the sale go down with the shipping. If the item is not an odd shape, 
excessively large, or fragile, experienced sellers calculate the shipping based 
on Priority Mail at the U.S. Postal Service, which is the unofficial eBay standard. 
Expect to pay a minimum of $5.00 for the first pound and another $0.50 for 
tracking the item.
Some sellers smartly use First Class Mail for items that weigh less than 13 
ounces once packed, and sellers of media will often use the slower delivery 
Media Mail for their items. These forms of shipping will save you big bucks!
It has also become somewhat routine for the seller to add a dollar or so for 
packing materials such as paper, bubble wrap, tape, and such. This is a fair 
and reasonable handling charge because the cost of these items can add up 
over time.
 
You may come across sellers trying to nickel-and-dime their way to a fortune 
by jacking up the prices on shipping to ridiculous proportions. If you have a 
question about shipping costs, ask before you bid on the item.

119
 Chapter 6: Shopping eBay: The Basics 
 
Before bidding on big stuff, like a barber’s chair or a sofa, check for something 
in the item description that says “Buyer Pays Actual Shipping Charges.” When 
you see that, always e-mail the seller prior to your bid to find out what those 
shipping charges would be to your home. On larger items, you may need to 
factor in packing and crating charges. The seller may also suggest a specific 
shipping company.
As the bumper sticker says, (ahem) stuff happens — sometimes to the stuff 
you buy. But before you give up and just stuff it, consider insuring it. eBay 
transactions sometimes involve two types of insurance that may have an 
effect on your pocketbook:
 
✓ Shipping insurance: This insurance covers your item as it travels 
through the U.S. Postal Service, UPS, FedEx, or any of the other carriers.
 
 Some savvy sellers have signed up with a company called Package 
In-Transit Coverage (U-PIC) (www.u-pic.com). This company insures 
all the packages of its clients using an annual policy. This way, the seller 
doesn’t have to stand in line at the post office to get an insurance stamp 
from a clerk. The seller simply logs the packages and reports on them on 
a monthly basis. Sellers will let you know that they use this service when 
they ship your item.
 
 Although many sellers offer shipping insurance as an option, others 
don’t bother because if the price of the item is low, they’d rather refund 
your money and keep you happy than go through all that insurance 
paperwork. Don’t forget that if you want shipping insurance, you pay for 
it. (See Chapter 12 for details on shipping insurance.)
 
✓ Buyer protection: Paying through PayPal provides excellent protection 
against all kinds of seller shenanigans. Depending on the seller’s status 
with PayPal, your items are covered for the full purchase price. (The 
details of this type of protection are covered in Chapter 16.).
Placing Your Bid on an Auction
Okay, so you’ve found the perfect item to track (say a really classy Elvis Presley 
wristwatch), and it’s in your price range. You’re more than interested — 
you’re ready to bid. If this were a live auction, some stodgy-looking guy in a 
gray suit would see you nod your head and start the bidding at, say, $2. Then 
some woman with a fierce hairdo would yank on her ear, and the Elvis watch 
would jump to $3.
eBay reality is more like this: You’re sitting at home in your fuzzy slippers, 
sipping coffee in front of the computer; all the other bidders are cruising 
cyberspace in their pajamas, too. You just can’t see ’em. (Be really thankful 
for the small things.)

120
Part II: Buying Like an Expert 
When you’re ready to jump into the eBay fray, you can find the bidding box 
at the top of the auction item page. If the item includes a Buy It Now option, 
you see that next to the bidding form.
To fill out the bidding form and place a bid, first make sure that you’re registered 
(see Chapter 2 for details) and then follow these steps. After you make your first 
bid on an item, you can instantly get to auctions you’re bidding on from your My 
eBay page. (If you need some tips on how to set up My eBay, see Chapter 4.)
 
1. Enter your maximum bid in the appropriate box.
 
 The bid needs to be an increment or more higher than the current 
minimum bid. The lowest amount you can bid is displayed to the right 
of the bidding box. (See “Bidding to the Max: Proxy Bidding” for more 
information about bidding increments.)
 
 You don’t need to put in the dollar sign but do use a decimal point — 
unless you really want to pay $1,049.00 instead of $10.49. If you make a 
mistake with an incorrect decimal point, you can retract your bid (see 
“Retracting your bid” later in this chapter).
 
2. Click Place Bid.
 
 The Review Bid page appears on your screen, filled with a wealth of 
legalese. This is your last chance to change your mind: Do you really 
want the item, and can you really buy it? The bottom line is this: If you 
bid on it and you win, you buy it. eBay really means it.
 
3. At this point, you have to sign in if you haven’t already. If you’re 
signed in, skip to Step 5.
 
4. If you agree to the terms, click Confirm Bid.
 
 After you agree, the Bid Confirmation screen appears.
 
When you first start out on eBay, I suggest that you start with a token bid — a 
small bid that won’t win you the auction but can help you keep tabs on the 
auction’s progress.
After you bid on an item, the item number and title appear on your My 
eBay page, listed under (big surprise) Bidding, as shown in Figure 6-7. (See 
Chapter 4 for more information on My eBay.) The Bidding list makes tracking 
your auction (or auctions, if you’re bidding on multiple items) easy.
 
eBay considers a bid on an item to be a binding contract. You can save your-
self a lot of heartache if you make a promise to never bid on an item you don’t 
intend to buy. Don’t make practice bids, assuming that because you’re new to 
eBay, you can’t win; if you do that, you’ll probably win simply because you’ve 
left yourself open to Murphy’s Law. Therefore, before you go to the bidding 
form, be sure that you’re in this auction for the long haul and make yourself 
another promise: Figure out the maximum you’re willing to spend. (Read the 
section “The Agony (?) of Buyer’s Remorse,” later in this chapter, for doleful 
accounts of what can happen if you bid idly or get buyer’s remorse.)

Bidding to the Max: Proxy Bidding
When you make a maximum bid on the bidding form, you actually make 
several small bids — again and again — until the bidding reaches where you 
told it to stop. For example, if the current bid is up to $19.99 and you put in 
a maximum of $45.02, your bid automatically increases incrementally so that 
you’re ahead of the competition — at least until someone else’s maximum 
bid exceeds yours. Basically, you bid by proxy, which means that your bid 
rises incrementally in response to other bidders’ bids.
No one else knows for sure whether you’re bidding by proxy, and no one 
knows your maximum bid. And the best part is that you can be out having a 
life of your own while the proxy bid happens automatically. Buyers and sell-
ers have no control over the increments (appropriately called bid increments) 
that eBay sets. The bid increment is the amount of money by which a bid is 
raised, and eBay’s system can work in mysterious ways.
The current maximum bid can jump up a nickel or a quarter or even an 
Andrew Jackson, but there is a method to the madness, even though you may 
not think so. eBay uses a bid-increment formula (see Table 6-1) that uses the 
current high bid to determine how much to increase the bid increment. As 
you can see, the proxy bidding amounts become larger the higher you bid. 
For example:
 
✓ A 5-quart bottle of cold cream has a current high bid of $14.95. The bid 
increment is $0.50 — meaning that if you bid by proxy, your proxy will 
bid $15.45.

122
Part II: Buying Like an Expert 
 
✓ But a 5-ounce can of top-notch caviar has a high bid of $200. The bid 
increment is $2.50. If you choose to bid by proxy, your proxy will bid 
$202.50.

Specialized Auction Categories
After you get the hang of bidding on eBay, you may venture to the specialized 
auction areas. You can purchase a car or car parts and accessories from 
eBay Motors, or your own piece of land or a new home in the Real Estate 
category. eBay is always adding new specialty areas, so be sure to check the 
announcements as well as the home page.
Should you reach the big-time bidding, be aware that if you bid over $15,000 
in an auction, you must register a credit card with eBay. All items in the 
special categories are searchable in eBay’s search engine, so don’t worry 
about missing your dream Corvette when you use the Search page.
eBay Motors
Visiting the automotive area of eBay is an auto enthusiast’s dream. You can 
also find some great deals in used cars, and eBay offers creative ways to 
make buying vehicles of all shapes and sizes (as well as the largest array of 
parts you’ll find anywhere on the planet) easy. Visit eBay Motors by clicking 
the eBay Motors link on the home page or by going to www.ebaymotors.com.

124
Part II: Buying Like an Expert 
 
✓ Search engine: If you want to search for cars without coming up with 
hundreds of die-cast vehicles, eBay Motors has its own search available 
from the eBay Motors home page.
 
✓ Vehicle shipping: If you don’t want to drive across the country to pick 
up your new vehicle, you can have it shipped through Dependable Auto 
Shippers. Check online for a free quote.
 
✓ Inspections: Many used-car sellers take advantage of inspection service 
vendors. These companies offer a comprehensive inspection covering 
the mechanical condition and cosmetic appearance and they supply a 
detailed inspection report. Car auctions from sellers who have their cars 
inspected have their auctions listed with an Inspection icon.
 
✓ Lemon Check: With the vehicle’s VIN (Vehicle Identification Number), 
you can run a lemon check on the car through CARFAX.com.
 
✓ Escrow: Escrow.com is one of the safest ways to purchase a vehicle 
online. Escrow.com verifies and secures the buyer’s payment and 
releases payment to the seller only after the buyer inspects and is 
completely satisfied with the vehicle.
eBay Stores
The eBay Stores are a quick, easy, and convenient way to find items for sale 
that you can buy now. A large number of eBay sellers have opened eBay 
Stores for a monthly fee as an inexpensive way to display a large amount of 
items for sale. They’re offered a much lower listing fee for their items, as low 
as 3 cents, and the items stay in their stores for as long as they want. The 
lower listing fees are quite a savings over the fees for listing an item for 
auction, and sellers often pass the savings onto you.
When you’re perusing the auctions on eBay, look for the little red door icon 
next to a seller’s user ID. If you click the door, you’re magically transported 
to the seller’s virtual eBay storefront. Figure 6-8 shows you the eBay Stores 
hub. You get there by clicking the eBay Stores link on the upper-left of the 
home page.
 
eBay Stores have a separate search engine than the eBay core search engine. 
If you don’t find the item you’re looking for on eBay auctions, look at the 
column on the left side of the page. Under the Related Stores heading is a 
list of eBay stores that may contain the item you’re looking for and a Search 
Stores link. Click the link, and eBay performs the same search for you in all 
eBay Stores.

The Agony (?) of Buyer’s Remorse
Maybe you’re used to going into a shopping mall and purchasing something 
that you’re not sure you like. What’s the worst that could happen? You end 
up back at the mall, receipt in hand, returning the item. Not so on eBay. Even 
if you realize you already have a purple feather boa in your closet that’s just 
like the one you won yesterday on eBay, deciding that you don’t want to go 
through with a transaction is a big deal. Not only can it earn you some nasty 
feedback, but it can also give you the reputation of a deadbeat.
Buyer’s remorse can pay off
Sometimes buyer’s remorse does pay off. I 
know one eBay buyer who got a serious case of 
remorse after winning an auction. She decided 
to do the right thing and pay for the item even 
though she didn’t want it. After receiving the 
item, she turned around and sold it on eBay for 
triple what she paid. If you really don’t want the 
item, think like a seller — see whether you can 
turn a horrible mistake into a profitable venture. 
For more information on the benefits of selling, 
take a look at Chapter 9.

It would be a shame to float around eBay with the equivalent of a scarlet D 
(for deadbeat) above your user ID. Okay, eBay uses a kinder term — non-
paying bidder — but for many members, it boils down to the same thing. If 
you win an auction and have to back out of your obligation as the winner — 
even through no fault of your own — you need some info that can keep you in 
good (well, okay, better) standing. Look no further; you’ve found it.
Retracting your bid
Remember, many states consider your bid a binding contract, just like 
any other contract. You can’t retract your bid unless one of these three 
outstandingly unusual circumstances applies:
 
✓ If your bid is clearly a typographical error (you submitted a bid for 
$4,567 when you really meant $45.67), you may retract your bid. If this 
occurs, you should reenter the correct bid amount immediately. You 
won’t get any sympathy if you try to retract an $18.25 bid by saying you 
meant to bid $15.25, so review your bid before you send it.
 
✓ You have tried to contact the seller to answer questions on the item, 
and he or she doesn’t reply in a timely fashion.
 
✓ If the seller substantially changes the description of an item after you 
place a bid (the description of the item changes from “can of tennis 
balls” to “a tennis ball,” for example), you may retract your bid.
 
If you simply must retract a bid, try to do so long before the auction ends — 
and have a good reason for your retraction. eBay users are understanding, 
up to a point. If you have a good explanation, you should come out of the 
situation all right. So admit you’ve made a mistake.
If you’ve made an error, you must retract your bid prior to the last 12 hours 
of the auction. At this point, a retraction removes all bids you have placed 
in the auction. Mistakes or not, when you retract a bid that was placed 
within the last 12 hours of the listing, only the most recent bid you made is 
retracted — your bids placed prior to the last 12 hours are still active.
Here’s how to retract a bid while the auction’s still going on:
 
1. Go to http://offer.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?RetractBidShow.
. 
2. Read the legalese and scroll down the page. Enter the item number of 
the auction you’re retracting your bid from. Then open the drop-down 
menu and select one of the three legitimate reasons for retracting 
your bid.

127
 Chapter 6: Shopping eBay: The Basics 
 
3. Click the Retract Bid button.
 
 You receive a confirmation of your bid retraction via e-mail. Keep a copy 
of it until the auction is completed.
If you’ve made a mistake when making a Best Offer, go to the following:
http://offer.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?RetractBestOfferShow&guest=1
 
The seller may send you an e-mail to ask for a more lengthy explanation of 
your retraction, especially if the item was a hot seller that received a lot of 
bids. You may also get e-mails from other bidders. Keep your replies courte-
ous. After you retract one bid on an item, all your lower bids on that item are 
also retracted (unless the retraction is done within the last 12 hours), and 
your retraction goes into the bidding history — another good reason to have 
a really good reason for the retraction. The number of bids you’ve retracted 
also goes on your feedback rating scorecard.
After the auction: Side deals or personal offers?
If a bidder is outbid on an item that he or she 
really wants or if the auction’s reserve price 
isn’t met, the bidder may send an e-mail to 
the seller and see whether the seller is will-
ing to make another deal. Maybe the seller has 
another similar item or is willing to sell the item 
directly rather than run a whole new auction. 
You need to know that this could happen — but 
eBay doesn’t sanction this outside activity.
If the seller has more than one of the item, or the 
original auction winner doesn’t go through with 
the deal, the seller can make a Second Chance 
offer. This is a legal eBay-sanctioned second 
chance for underbidders (unsuccessful bid-
ders) who participated in the auction. Second 
Chance offers can also be made in reserve auc-
tions if the reserve price wasn’t met.
Any side deals other than Second Chance 
offers are unprotected. My friend Jack collects 
autographed final scripts from hit television sit-
coms. So when the curtain fell on Seinfeld, he 
had to have a script. Not surprisingly, he found 
one on eBay with a final price tag that was way 
out of his league. But he knew that by placing 
a bid, someone else with a signed script to sell 
might see his name and try to make a deal. And 
he was right.
After the auction closed, he received an e-mail 
from a guy who worked on the final show and 
had a script signed by all the actors. He offered 
it to Jack for $1,000 less than the final auction 
price on eBay. Tempted as he was to take 
the offer, Jack understood that eBay’s rules 
and regulations wouldn’t help him out if the 
deal turned sour. He was also aware that he 
wouldn’t receive the benefit of feedback (which 
is the pillar of the eBay community) or any eBay 
Standard Purchase Protection insurance for the 
transaction.
If you even think about making a side deal, 
remember that not only does eBay strictly pro-
hibit this activity, but eBay can also suspend 
you if you are reported for making a side deal. 
And if you’re the victim of a side-deal scam, 
eBay’s rules and regulations don’t offer you any 
protection. My advice? Watch out!

128
Part II: Buying Like an Expert 
Avoiding deadbeat (non-paying 
bidder) status
Some bidders are more like kidders — they bid even though they have no 
intention of buying a thing. But those folks don’t last long on eBay because 
of all the negative feedback they get. In fact, when honest eBay members 
spot these ne’er-do-wells, they often post the deadbeats’ user IDs on eBay’s 
message boards. Some eBay members have created entire Web sites to warn 
others about dealing with the deadbeats . . . ahem . . . non-paying bidders. 
(Civilized but chilly, isn’t it?)
Exceptions to the deadbeat (er, sorry, non-paying bidder) rule may include 
the following human mishaps:
 
✓ A death in the family
 
✓ Computer failure
 
✓ A huge misunderstanding
If you have a good reason to call off your purchase, make sure that the seller 
knows about it. The seller is the only one who can excuse you from the sale.
If you receive a non-paying bidder warning but you’ve paid for the item, eBay 
requires proof of payment. That would include a copy of the check (front and 
back) or money order, a copy of the payment confirmation from PayPal (or 
other online payment service), or an e-mail from the seller acknowledging 
receipt of payment. If the seller excused you from the auction, you need to 
forward the e-mail with all headers.
 
✓ Fax hard copies to eBay at 888-379-6251.
 
✓ Send the e-mail via an online form. Go to pages.ebay.com/help/buy/
appeal-unpaid-item.html, click the link to the online form, and 
plead your case.
 
There’s no guarantee that your non-paying bidder appeal will be accepted. 
eBay will contact you after an investigation and let you know whether your 
appeal was successful.
eBay has a message for non-paying bidders: The policy is three strikes and 
you’re out. After the first complaint about a non-paying (deadbeat) bidder, 
eBay gives the bad guy or gal a warning. After the third offense, the non-paying 
bidder is suspended from eBay for good and becomes NARU (Not A 
Registered User). Nobody’s tarred and feathered, but you probably won’t 
see hide nor hair of that user again on eBay.

W
hen I travel the country talking about eBay, I speak to so many people 
who find an item on eBay, bid on it, and at the last minute — the last 
hour, or the last day — are outbid. Sad and dejected, they find losing often 
cuts to the core and makes them feel like losers.
You’re not a loser when you lose an auction on eBay. You just may not know 
the fine art of sneaky bidding (my way of saying educated bidding).
When the stakes are high and you really, really want the item, you have to 
resort to a higher form of strategy. Sports teams study their rivals, and 
political candidates scout out what the opposition is doing. Bidding in 
competition against other bidders is just as serious an enterprise. Follow the 
tips in this chapter and see if you can come up with a strong bidding strategy 
of your own. (Feel free to e-mail me with any scathingly brilliant plans; I’m 
always open to new theories.)
Make an Offer!
If you come across a fixed-price listing and you’re in the mood to negotiate, 
why not make an offer? A seller on eBay can use the Make Offer option 
anytime they list a fixed-price item. It should indicate to you that you’re 
dealing with a seller who’s motivated to sell. The eBay Make an Offer option 
is a great way to get bargains. You make an offer on the item and the seller 
will either accept your offer or send you a counteroffer.

130
Part II: Buying Like an Expert 
Making an offer to buy an item has a drawback; the seller has 48 hours to 
respond to you and you may find the same item from another seller at a 
better price before then. By making an offer, you guarantee that you will buy 
the item at the price of your offer if the seller agrees to it. If they don’t you’re 
off the hook and can find another of the item elsewhere.
To make an offer, click the Make Offer button (instead of Buy It Now button); 
see Figure 7-1.
 
Figure 7-1: 
Use the 
Make Offer 
option 
anytime 
you’re not 
in a rush 
and want 
to wangle a 
good deal.
 
When making an offer, you might want to put in a really, really low offer. But 
be sensible; if the item is new, the seller may have only a little wiggle room on 
the price. Also, putting in a low offer (say $10 on a $25 item) may just annoy 
the seller and he or she may turn you down without giving you an opportunity 
to negotiate.
Find Out an Item’s Bidding History
You can access the bidding history by clicking the History link, which 
appears after the number of bids on the item page. The bidding history lists 
everyone who is bidding on the item. You can see how often and at what time 
bids are placed, but you can’t see the bidder’s real eBay username because 
(to protect the innocent) eBay changes user IDs to a gibberish of asterisks 
and numbers. Each bidder is assigned a faux bidder ID in the history. Look 
at Figure 7-2 to see the bidding history on an auction where I’m no longer the 
highest bidder.

131
 Chapter 7: Power-Buying Strategies 
 
Figure 7-2: 
The bidding 
history tells 
you the 
date and 
time of day 
at which 
the bidders 
placed their 
bids as 
well as the 
amount.
 
 
Pay attention to the times at which bidders are placing their bids; you may 
find that, like many eBay users, the people bidding in this auction seem to be 
creatures of habit — making their bids about once a day and at a particular 
time of day. They may be logging on before work, during lunch, or after work. 
Whatever their schedules, you have great info at your disposal in the event 
that a bidding war breaks out: Just bid after your competition traditionally 
logs out, and you increase your odds of winning the auction.
Early in an auction, there may not be much of a bidding history for an item, 
but that doesn’t mean you can’t still check out the dates and times a bidder 
places bids. You can also tell that a bidder practices sniping (discussed later 
in this chapter) if his or her bid zips in during the last few minutes (or even 
seconds!) of the auction. You may have a fight on your hands if the bidder 
does practice sniping.
Get to Know the Other Bidders
It used to be an easy task to study up on your competition, but the brains at 
eBay got smart and made it all but impossible. That is, all but impossible to 
me! In this section I show you how I figured out the now-circuitous route you 
can use to research your competition.

132
Part II: Buying Like an Expert 
The concatenated ID of the person the item would belong to if the auction 
ended right now is listed on the auction item page. You can tell if the auction 
has bidders because the number of bidders appears on the listing page.
Take a look at this ID because you may see this bidder again later in this auction. 
By clicking the ID, you are presented with a page like the one shown in 
Figure 7-3, which shows just what that bidder has been up to — bidding wise.
 
Figure 7-3: 
Clicking on 
an ID in the 
bid history 
reveals a lot 
about the 
competi-
tion. In this 
sample, 
this person 
is clearly 
highly inter-
ested in the 
Jewelry 
category. 
Are they a 
dealer?
 
Now, how do you find out more? After you’ve lost an auction or two, go to 
eBay’s Advanced Search, use the Items By Bidder search option, and run a 
search as described next
To get the skinny on a competitor, here’s the move:
 
1. Type your user ID.
 
2. Click the option button on the Include Completed Listings line.
 
 Keep in mind that eBay has a 30-day limit on the auction information it 
returns, so don’t expect to see results from a year ago. 
 
3. Choose the number of items you want to see per page.
 
4. Click Search.
On the resulting page you will see a list of all the items you’ve bid on. The 
ones that you’ve won are marked with your user ID and an asterisk (*) 
indicating you are the winner. You will also see the listings that you’ve lost, 
and the user ID of the person that won!

133
 Chapter 7: Power-Buying Strategies 
Now, run the same search with that person’s user ID and you’ll get an idea of 
how much they bid in similar auctions to win. I think you should check all of 
the bidder’s auctions to see how aggressively he or she bids on items. You 
can also get a pretty good handle on how badly a bidder wants specific 
items — and how high that person will bid before dropping out.
If the bidder was bidding on the same item in the past that you’re both 
interested in now, you can also get a fairly good idea of how high that person 
is willing to go for the item.
 
You may be tempted to try to contact a bidder you’re competing with so you 
can get information about the person more easily. This is not only bad form 
but could also get you suspended. Don’t do it.
Strategies to Help You Outsmart 
the Competition
 
Your 2 cents do matter — at least on eBay. Here’s why: Many eBay members 
tend to round off their bids to the nearest dollar figure. Some choose nice, 
familiar coin increments such as 25, 50, or 75 cents. But the most successful 
eBay bidders have found that adding 2 or 3 cents to a routine bid can mean 
the difference between winning and losing. So I recommend that you make 
your bids in oddish figures (such as $15.02 or $45.57) as an inexpensive way 
to edge out your competition. If you have a proxy bid in, say for $22.57, and a 
sniper jumps in at the last second and places a bid for $22.50 — you still win! 
The highest bid placed always wins. For the first time ever, your 2 cents (or in 
this case 7 cents) may actually pay off!
That’s just one of the many strategies to get you ahead of the rest of the 
bidding pack without paying more than you should. Note: The strategies in 
this section are for bidders who are tracking an item over the course of a 
The tale of the 3-plus-negative seller
A friend of mine took a risk and bid on an old 
Winchester rifle (now a banned item — see 
Chapter 9 for a rundown of what you’re allowed 
and not allowed to sell on eBay) without read-
ing the seller’s feedback. The seller had a (+3) 
next to his user ID, which is a somewhat okay 
rating. Good thing my friend lost the auction. 
It turned out that the seller had a whopping 
20 negative feedback messages. He had 23 
positives, mostly posted by suspicious-looking 
names. Repeat after me: Always read the feed-
back comments!

134
Part II: Buying Like an Expert 
week or so, so be sure you have time to track the item and plan your next 
moves. Also, get a few auctions under your belt before you throw yourself 
into the middle of a bidding war.
Here’s a list of do’s and don’ts that can help you win your item. Of course, 
some of these tips are eBay-endorsed, but I had to get you to notice what I 
have to say somehow:
 
✓ Don’t bid early and high. Bidding early and high shows that you have a 
clear interest in the item. It also shows that you’re a rookie, apt to make 
mistakes. If you bid early and high, you may give away just how much 
you want the item.
 
 Of course, a higher bid does mean more bucks for the seller and a 
healthy cut for the middleman. So it’s no big mystery that many sellers 
recommend it. In fact, when you sell an item, you may want to encourage 
it too.
 
 If you must bid early and can’t follow the auction action (you mean you 
have a life?), use software or an online sniping service. Then feel free 
to place your highest possible bid! You can find out more about that in 
Chapter 20.
 
✓ Do wait and watch your auction. If you’re interested in an item and you 
have the time to watch it from beginning to end, I say that the best 
strategy is to wait. Mark the auction to Watch This Item on your My 
eBay page and remember to check it daily. But if you don’t have the 
time, go ahead — put in your maximum bid early and cross your fingers.
 
✓ Don’t freak out if you find yourself in a bidding war. Don’t keel over 
if, at the split second you’re convinced that you’re the high bidder with 
your $45.02, someone beats you out at $45.50.
 
 You can increase your maximum bid to $46.02, but if your bidding foe 
also has a maximum of $46.02, the tie goes to the person who put in the 
highest bid first. Bid as high as you’re willing to go, but bid at the very 
end of the auction.
 
✓ Do check the item’s bidding history. If you find yourself in a bidding 
war and want an item badly enough, check the bidding history and 
identify your fiercest competitor; then refer to the previous section “Get 
to Know the Other Bidders” for a pre-auction briefing.
 
 To get a pretty exact picture of your opponent’s bidding habits, make 
special note of the times of day when he or she has bid on other 
auctions. You can adjust your bidding times accordingly.
 
✓ Do remember that most deals go through without a problem. The 
overwhelming majority of deals on eBay are closed with no trouble, 
which means that if the auction you’re bidding in is typical and you 
come in second place, you’ve lost. Or maybe not . . .

135
 Chapter 7: Power-Buying Strategies 
 
 If the winning bidder backs out of the auction or the seller has more 
than one of the item, the seller could (but isn’t obligated to) come to 
another bidder and offer to sell the item at the second bidder’s price 
through eBay’s Second Chance option. (See Chapter 13 for more details 
on this feature.)
Time Is Money: Auction 
Strategy by the Clock
You can use different bidding strategies depending on how much time is left 
in an auction. By paying attention to the clock, you can learn about your 
competition, beat them out, and end up paying less for your item.
 
Most auctions on eBay run for a week; the auction item page always lists how 
much time is left. However, sellers can run auctions for as short as one day or 
as long as ten days. So synchronize your computer clock with eBay’s master 
time and become the most precise eBay bidder around. Figure 7-4 shows 
eBay’s Official Time page (which you can find at the very bottom of almost 
every eBay page).
To synchronize your clock, make sure that you’re logged on to the Internet 
and can easily access the eBay Web site. Then follow these steps:
Pirates of the Caribbean . . . or Carribean?
Just before the movie Pirates of the Caribbean 
premiered; Disneyland gave out exclusive movie 
posters to its visitors. My then college student 
daughter, savvy eBayer that she is, snagged 
several copies to sell on the site. She listed 
them (one at a time) when the movie opened 
and couldn’t get more than the starting bid of 
$9.99 for each of them.
When we searched eBay for pirates poster, 
we found that the very same posters listed with 
a misspelled title, “Pirates of the Carribean,” 
were selling for as high as $30 each. After sell-
ing out her initial stock, my daughter found 
another seller who had ten for sale — in one 
auction — with the proper spelling. She bought 
those as well (for $5.00 each) and sold them 
with misspelled titles on the site for between 
$15 and $27!
The moral of this story is always to search alter-
nate spellings of your item; you might possibly 
eke out a gem without any competition.

Most bidding on eBay goes on during East Coast work time and early evening 
hours, which gives you a leg up if you live out West. Night-owl bidders will find 
that after 10 p.m. Pacific Time (about 1:00 a.m. Eastern Time), lots of bargains 
are to be had. And believe it or not, lots of auctions end in the wee hours of 
the morning. Monday holidays are also great for bargains, as are Thanksgiving 
and the day after. While everyone is in the living room digesting and arguing 
about what to watch on TV (or getting up at 5:00 a.m. to buy the big discount 
deal at Wal-Mart), fire up eBay and be thankful for the great bargains you can 
win.

eBay time-conversion chart. It’s located at

Using a laid-back strategy
Sometimes the best strategy at the beginning of an auction is to do nothing 
at all. That’s right; relax, take off your shoes, and loaf. Go ahead. You may 
want to make a token bid (the very lowest you are allowed) or mark the page 
to watch in your My eBay area. I generally take this attitude through the first 
six days of a week-long auction I want to bid on, and it works pretty well. Of 
course, I check in every day just to keep tabs on the items I’m watching on 
my My eBay page, and revise my strategy as time goes by.
 
The seller has the right to up his minimum bid — if his auction has received 
no bids — up to 12 hours before the auction ends. If the seller has set a 
ridiculously low minimum bid and then sees that the auction is getting no 
action, the seller may choose to up the minimum bid to protect his investment 
in the item that’s up for sale. By placing the minimum token bid when you 
first see the auction, you can foil a Buy It Now from another bidder (because 
Buy It Now is disabled after a bid has been placed unless there is a Reserve 
on the listing) or prevent the seller from upping the minimum. If it’s important 
enough, you can see whether the seller has done this in the past, by searching 
the Seller’s completed auctions (see “Get to Know the Other Bidders” previously 
in this chapter to find out how to do this search). All preclosing changes are 
available for public view; just click View All Revisions just above the words 
Seller’s Description on the item page. See Figure 7-5 for a sample.
 
If you see an item that you absolutely must have, mark it to watch on your My 
eBay page (or make that token bid) and plan and revise your maximum bid as 
the auction goes on. I can’t stress enough how important this is.

138
Part II: Buying Like an Expert 
 
Figure 7-5: 
This page 
shows the 
revisions 
made by the 
seller during 
this auction.
 
As you check back each day, take a look at the other bids and the high 
bidder. Is someone starting a bidding war? Look at the time that the 
competition is bidding and note patterns. Maybe at noon Eastern Time? 
During lunch? If you know what time your major competition is bidding, 
when the time is right you can safely bid after he or she does (preferably 
when your foe is stuck in rush-hour traffic).
If you play the waiting game, you can decide if you really want to increase 
your bid or wait around for the item to show up again sometime. You may 
decide you really don’t want this particular item after all. Or you may feel 
no rush because many sellers who offer multiple items put them up one at a 
time.
Using the beat-the-clock strategy
You should rev up your bidding strategy during the final 24 hours of an 
auction and decide, once and for all, whether you really have to have the 
item you’ve been eyeing. Maybe you put in a maximum bid of $45.02 earlier 
in the week. Now’s the time to decide whether you’re willing to go as high as 
$50.02. Maybe $56.03?
No one wants to spend the day in front of the computer (ask almost anyone 
who does). You can camp out by the refrigerator or at your desk or wherever 
you want to be. Just place a sticky note where you’re likely to see it, reminding 
you of the exact time the auction ends. If you’re not going to be near a 
computer when the auction closes, you can also use an automatic bidding 
site to bid for you; see Chapter 20 for details.

139
 Chapter 7: Power-Buying Strategies 
In the last half hour
With a half hour left before the auction becomes ancient history, head for the 
computer and dig in for the last battle of the bidding war. I recommend that 
you log on to eBay about 5 to 10 minutes before the auction ends. The last 
thing you want to have happen is to get caught in Internet gridlock and not 
get access to the Web site. Go to the item you’re watching and click the 
auction title.
With 15 minutes to go, if your auction has a lot of action, eBay reloads the 
bidding action every second so you can get the most current info on what 
people are bidding.
Sniping to the finish: The final minutes
The rapid-fire, final flurry of bidding is called sniping. Sniping is the fine art 
of waiting until the very last seconds of an eBay auction and then outbidding 
the current high bidder just in time. Of course, you have to expect that the 
current high bidder is probably sniping back.
With a hot item, open a second window on your browser (in Internet Explorer 
or Firefox, you do that by pressing the Ctrl key and the N key together); keep 
one open for bidding and the other open to watch eBay’s constant reloading 
during the final few minutes. With the countdown at 60 seconds or less, 
make your final bid at the absolute highest amount you will pay for the item. 
The longer you can hold off — I’m talking down to around 15 seconds — the 
better. It all depends on the speed of your Internet connection (and how 
strong your stomach is), so practice on some small auctions so you know 
how much time to allow when you’re bidding on your prize item. Keep 
watching the time tick to the end of the auction, as in Figure 7-6.
The story of the Snipe sisters
Cory and Bonnie are sisters and avid eBay 
buyers. Bonnie collects vases. She had her eye 
on a Fenton Dragonfly Ruby Verdena vase, but 
the auction closed while she was at work and 
didn’t have access to a computer. Knowing 
that, her sister Cory decided to snipe for it. With 
37 seconds to go, she inserted the high bid on 
behalf of her sister. Bang, she was high bidder 
at $63. But, with 17 seconds left, another bidder 
sniped back and raised the price to $73. It was, 
of course, Bonnie, who had found a way to get 
access to a computer from where she was. 
Bonnie got the vase, and they both had a good 
laugh.

have a back-up high bid in case you catch another sniper swooping in on 
your item immediately after your first snipe. (I recently received an e-mail 
from one of my readers who used my somewhat paranoid method — which 
she learned from a previous edition of this book — and by using the second 
snipe, she won her item!) You can avoid the third-window routine if you’ve 
bid your highest bid with the first snipe. Then, if you’re outbid, you know 
the item went for more than you were willing to pay. (I know; it’s some 
consolation, but not much.)
Some eBay members consider the practice of sniping highly unseemly and 
uncivilized — it’s like when dozens of parents used to mob the department 
store clerks to get to the handful of Beanie Babies that were just delivered. 
(Come to think of it, whatever happened to those collectibles?) Of course, 
sometimes a little uncivilized behavior can be a hoot.
 
I say that sniping is an addictive, fun part of life on eBay auctions. And it’s a 
blast. So my recommendation is that you try sniping. You’re likely to benefit 
from the results and enjoy your eBay experience even more — especially if 
you’re an adrenaline junkie.
Here’s a list of things to keep in mind when you get ready to place your 
last bid:
 
✓ Know how high you’re willing to go. If you know you’re facing a lot of 
competition, figure out your highest bid to the penny. You should have 
already researched the item and know its value at this point. Raise your 
bid only to the level where you’re sure you’re getting a good return on 
your investment; don’t go overboard. Certainly, if the item has some 
emotional value to you and you just have to have it, bid as high as you 
want (and can afford — but you knew that). But remember, you’ll have 
to pay the piper later. You win it, you own it!

141
 Chapter 7: Power-Buying Strategies 
 
✓ Know the speed of your Internet connection.
 
✓ Remember, this is a game, and sometimes it’s a game of chance, so don’t 
lose heart if you lose the auction.
 
Although sellers love sniping because it drives up prices and bidders love it 
because it’s fun, a sniper can ruin a week’s careful work on an auction strategy. 
The most skillful snipers sneak in a bid so close to the end of the auction that 
you have no chance to counterbid, which means you lose. Losing too often, 
especially to the same sniper, can be a drag.
 
If your Internet connection is slower than most, and you want to do some 
sniping, make your final bid 2 minutes before the auction ends — and adjust the 
amount of the bid as high as you feel comfortable with so you can beat out 
the competition.
If you can make the highest bid with less than 20 seconds left, you most likely 
will win. With so many bids coming in the final seconds, your bid might be 
the last one that eBay records.
 
This stuff is supposed to be fun, so don’t lose perspective. If you can’t afford 
an item, don’t get caught up in a bidding war. Otherwise, the only person who 
wins is the seller. If you’re losing sleep, barking at your cat, or biting your nails 
over an item, it’s time to rethink what you’re doing. Shopping on eBay is like 
being in a long line in a busy department store. If it’s taking too much of your 
life or an item costs too much, be willing to walk away — or log off — and live 
to bid (or shop) another day.

In This Chapter
▶ Getting yourself organized
▶ Straight talk with the seller
▶ Ironing out the details and sending your payment
▶ Dealing with an item that arrives “not as expected”
▶ Finishing the transaction with feedback
T
he thrill of the chase is over, and you’ve won your first eBay item. 
Congratulations — now what do you do? You have to follow up on your 
victory and keep a sharp eye on what you’re doing. The post-sale process 
can be loaded with pitfalls and potential headaches if you don’t watch 
out. Remember, sometimes money, like a full moon, does strange things to 
people.
In this chapter, you can get a handle on what’s in store for you after you win 
your item. I clue you in on what the seller is supposed to do to make the 
transaction go smoothly and show you how to grab hold of your responsibilities 
as a buyer. I give you info here about following proper post-auction etiquette, 
including the best way to get organized, communicate with the seller 
professionally, and send your payment without hazards. I also brief you on 
how to handle an imperfect transaction.
eBay Calling: You’re a Winner
The All Buying section of your My eBay page highlights the titles of auctions 
you’ve won and indicates the amount of your winning bid. If you think you 
may have won the auction and don’t want to wait around for eBay to contact 
you, check out the All Buying section for yourself and find out whether you’re 
a winner.

Part II: Buying Like an Expert 
 
Throughout the bidding process, dollar amounts of items that you’re winning 
appear in green on your My eBay Active page. If you’ve been outbid, they 
appear in red. After the auction ends, there’s no marching band, no visit from 
Ed McMahon and his camera crew, no armful of roses, and no oversized check 
to duck behind. In fact, you’re more likely to find out that you’ve won the 
auction from either the seller or the Won section of your My eBay page than 
you are to hear it right away from eBay. eBay tries to get its End of Sale e-mails 
out pronto, but sometimes there’s a bit of lag time. For a look at all the contact 
information in the winner’s e-mail, see Figure 8-1.

If you can receive text messages on your cellphone, eBay will send EOA 
notices to your mobile. (See Chapter 6 for more information on the types of 
eBay alerts available.) Go to your My eBay: My Account: Preferences page 
and click the Show link. (The link appears next to Notification Delivery.) You 
can indicate just how you want to receive the various notifications from eBay

Getting Your Paperwork Together
Yeah, I know that PCs were supposed to create a paperless society, but cars 
were supposed to fly by the year 2000, too. Maybe it’s just as well that some 
predictions don’t come true (think of the way some people drive or steer 
shopping carts). Paper still has its uses; printing copies of your purchase 
records can help you keep your transactions straight.

145
 Chapter 8: After You Win the Item 
The item page shows the amount of your winning bid, the item’s description, 
and other relevant information. The second you find out you’ve won the item, 
click the Print link below the Gallery photo in the listing and print a copy of 
the item page for your files.
 
eBay displays listings for only 30 days in the Bidder search, so don’t put off 
printing out that final item page for your records. If you save your End of Sale 
e-mails that you get from eBay, you can access the listing for up to 90 days if 
you use the link in the e-mail.
Many sellers have multiple listings going at the same time, so the more 
organized you are, the more likely you will receive the correct item (and 
quick feedback) from the seller. Here’s a list of the items you should keep in 
your item purchases file:
 
✓ A copy of your e-mail from eBay. Don’t delete the e-mail — at least not 
until you print a copy and keep it for your records. You may need to 
refer to the e-mail later, and there’s no way to get another copy.
 
✓ Printed copies of any e-mail correspondence between you and the seller 
that details specific information about the item or special payment and 
shipping arrangements.
 
✓ A printed copy of the final auction page.
 
Sellers can edit and update their auctions even while they’re in progress, so 
keep your eyes peeled for changes in the listing as you monitor it. If the seller 
makes major changes, you are within your rights to withdraw your bid. (Check 
out Chapter 6 for more on the bidding process.)
An order of fries with a menu on the side
In 1999, one seller auctioned an old menu 
from Howard Johnson’s, estimating its era as 
the 1950s based on the cars pictured on the 
cover — and the prices (fried clams were 
$1.25). Also included was a separate menu card 
that listed fresh seafood and had a liquor menu 
(with Pieman logo) on the back — plus a list of 
locations in the New York City area. Except for 
a couple of staple holes at the top of the front 
cover (maybe evidence of daily specials past), 
the menu was in very good condition. The start-
ing bid was $5; the item sold for $64. These 
menus are even harder to come by now but are 
selling in the $25 range. (I wonder how much 
they want for fried clams in New York City these 
days. . . . )

146
Part II: Buying Like an Expert 
Getting Contact Information
The eBay rules and regulations say that buyers and sellers must contact each 
other within three business days of the listing’s end. So, if an item closes on a 
Saturday, you need to make contact by Wednesday.
If you’ve won an item and intend to pay through PayPal, it’s de rigueur for 
you to go to the item as soon as possible after you’ve won and use the Pay 
Now link on the item page as soon as possible.
So, What’s Your Number?
If something comes up between buying and receiving an item you’ve won 
and an e-mail you’re sending gets no response, you need to get more 
contact information. Remember back when you registered and eBay asked 
for a phone number? eBay keeps this information for times like this.
To get an eBay member’s phone number, click the Advanced Search link next 
to the Search box and then click the Members: Find Contact Information link 
on the left side of the screen. You need to enter the seller’s user ID and the 
number of the item that you’re trading with the other member; then click the 
Submit button.
eBay automatically generates an e-mail to both you and the other user.
eBay’s e-mail includes the seller’s user ID, name, e-mail address, company, 
city, state, and country of residence, as well as the seller’s phone number 
and date of initial registration. eBay sends this same information about you 
to the user you want to get in touch with.
Often, sellers jump to attention when they receive this e-mail from eBay and 
get the ball rolling to complete the transaction.
 
eBay doesn’t tolerate any abuses of its contact system. Make sure that you 
use this resource only to communicate with another user about a specific 
transaction. To use contact information to complete a deal outside eBay is an 
infringement of the rules. If you abuse the contact system, eBay can investigate 
you and kick you off the site.
 
If the seller doesn’t contact you within three business days, you may have to 
do some nudging to complete the transaction. (See “Keeping in Touch: Dealing 
with an AWOL Seller,” later in this chapter, and take a look at Chapter 13.)

147
 Chapter 8: After You Win the Item 
Checking Out
When you buy something in a store, you need to check out to pay. eBay isn’t 
much different. eBay’s Checkout is a convenient way to pay for your com-
pleted auctions, fixed-price sales, and Buy it Now sales with a credit card 
or eCheck through PayPal. You may also use Checkout to exchange your 
information with the seller and pay for your item at a place other than PayPal 
(such as by money order, check, or another payment service that the seller 
accepts).
Checkout is integrated directly onto the item page so that you can win and 
pay for an item in less than a minute. Some sellers indicate, in their description, 
that they will send you a link to their private checkout page. When the sale is 
over, the item page will have checkout information, as shown in Figure 8-2.
 
Figure 8-2: 
Click the 
Pay Now 
button to 
pay for 
the item 
immediately 
through 
PayPal.
 
When you click the Pay Now button, you’re taken step-by-step through the 
checkout process. You pay for the item, and the seller is notified. You also 
get an e-mail confirming your payment, along with the seller’s e-mail address.
If you’re dealing with a Buy It Now or fixed-price listing, you don’t have to 
wait and go back to the listing once you’ve purchased the item. After you 
confirm to eBay that you want to make a purchase, you’re taken immediately 
to a page with a Pay Now button, as in Figure 8-3.

Communicating with the Seller
Top-notch sellers know that communication is the absolute key to a successful 
transaction, and they do everything they can to set a positive tone for the 
entire process with speedy and courteous e-mails (or, at the very least, 
invoices).
Contact from a professional eBay seller should include the following 
information:
 
✓ Confirmation of the winning price
 
✓ The link for paying with PayPal or a secure Web site for credit card 
processing
 
✓ A review of the shipping options and price (the fee you pay)
 
✓ Confirmation of escrow (if offered in the listing)
 
✓ The date the item will be shipped
When you read the seller’s e-mail, be sure to compare the terms the seller 
laid out in his or her e-mail with the terms on the auction page. And make 
sure that the form of payment and where it should be sent are clear.
You should pay immediately upon receipt of the invoice. If you have a 
question before paying, contact the seller immediately — he or she will be 
expecting your payment.
 
If you see significant differences between what the e-mail you receive from 
the seller after the sale and what is on your printout of the item page, address 
them immediately with the seller before you proceed with the transaction. For 
more on clarifying payment options during the buying process, see Chapter 6.

149
 Chapter 8: After You Win the Item 
Sending the Payment Promptly 
and Securely
So how many times have you heard the saying “The check is in the mail”? 
Yeah, I’ve heard it about a thousand times, too. If you’re on the selling end of 
a transaction, hearing this line from the buyer but not getting the money is 
frustrating. If you’re on the buying end, it’s very bad form and may also lead 
to bad feedback for you.
Being the good buyer that you are (you’re here finding out how to do the 
right thing, right?), you’ll get your payment out pronto via PayPal. Do it 
immediately — why wait? (The sooner you pay, the sooner you get that 
charming Flying Monkey decanter you won!)
 
Most sellers expect to get paid within three business days after the close of 
the listing. Although this timeline isn’t mandatory, it makes good sense to let 
the seller know if there will be any delay in payment.
 
Send your payment promptly. If you have to delay payment for any reason 
(you have to go out of town, you are over your credit card limit, you broke 
your leg), let the seller know as soon as possible. Most sellers understand if 
you send them a kind and honest e-mail. Let the seller know what’s up, give 
him or her a date by which the money can be expected, and then meet that 
deadline. If the wait is unreasonably long, the seller may cancel the transaction. 
In that case, you can kiss your positive feedback goodbye.
If the seller acknowledges through e-mail that they will accept other forms of 
payment, here are some tips on how to make sure that your payment reaches 
the seller promptly and safely:
 
✓ Have your name and address printed on your checks. A check without a 
printed name or address sends up a big red flag to sellers that the check 
may not clear. For privacy and safety reasons, though, never put your 
driver’s license number or Social Security number on your check.
 
✓ Always write the item title and your user ID on a check or money order 
and enclose a printout of the final auction page in the envelope. The 
Number 1 pet peeve of most eBay sellers is that they get a payment but 
don’t know what it’s for — that is, buyers send checks without any 
auction information.
 
✓ If you’re paying with a credit card without using a payment service and 
you want to give the seller the number over the telephone, be sure to 
request the seller’s phone number in your reply to the seller’s initial 
e-mail and explain why you want it.

150
Part II: Buying Like an Expert 
 
✓ You can safely e-mail your credit card information over the course of 
several e-mails, each containing four numbers from your credit card. 
Stagger your e-mails so that they’re about 20 minutes apart and don’t 
forget to let the seller know what kind of credit card you’re using. Also, 
give the card’s expiration date.
 
Buyers routinely send out payments without their name, their address, or a 
clue as to what they’ve purchased. No matter how you pay, be sure to include 
a copy of the eBay confirmation letter, a printout of the auction page, or a 
copy of the e-mail the seller sent you. If you pay with a credit card via e-mail 
or over the phone, you should still send this info through the mail just to be 
on the safe side.
Using PayPal, a person-to-person 
payment service
Chapter 6 covers the pros and cons of using PayPal to pay for your auctions, 
but the bottom line is that every eBay seller accepts it as the main payment 
option. Let me make you feel more comfortable about why PayPal is the 
safest way to pay on eBay. eBay sees to it that PayPal is incredibly easy to 
use because PayPal is the official payment service on eBay. After the auction 
is over, a link to pay appears. If you’d prefer, wait until you hear from the 
seller. You can make your payment in three ways:
 
✓ Credit Card: You can use your American Express, Discover, Visa, or 
MasterCard to make your payment through PayPal. The cost of the item 
is charged to your card, and your statement will reflect a PayPal payment 
with the seller’s ID.
 
✓ eCheck: Sending money with an eCheck is easy. It debits your checking 
account just like a paper check. It does not clear immediately, and the 
seller probably won’t ship until PayPal tells him or her that the eCheck 
has cleared your bank.
 
✓ Instant Transfer: An instant transfer is just like an eCheck, except that 
it clears immediately and the money is directly posted to the seller’s 
account. To send an instant transfer, you must have a credit card on 
file with PayPal as a backup (should the payment from your bank be 
denied).
PayPal is my favorite payment service for another reason. PayPal has a buyer 
protection program, which covers your purchases against fraud or if your 
item arrives not as described. Read more about that in Chapter 16.

151
 Chapter 8: After You Win the Item 
When the auction is over, you can click the Pay Now button to check out and 
enter the PayPal site. If you don’t pay immediately from the item page or 
seller’s invoice, click the Pay link on the drop-down menu to the left of your 
item on your My eBay Won area. Once you click, just follow these steps:
 
1. If this is your first visit to the PayPal site, register.
 
2. If you’re already a registered user, go ahead and log in by following 
the steps on-screen.
 
3. Your transaction appears and you decide how to pay.
If you’re new to PayPal, they take you step-by-step through the process of 
filling out a payment form to identify the auction you’re paying for as well as 
your shipping information. You’re all done. Your credit card information is 
held safely with PayPal, and the payment is deposited into the seller’s PayPal 
account. The seller receives notice of your payment and notifies you about 
how quickly he or she will ship your item.
By paying with PayPal, you can instantly pay for an auction without hassle. 
Your credit card information is kept private, and your payment is deposited 
into the seller’s PayPal account.
You can always view your checkout status by going to your My eBay: 
Won area. Click the drop-down menu in the Action column for the item in 
question.
Keeping in Touch: Dealing 
with an AWOL Seller
The eBay community, like local towns and cities, is not without its problems. 
With the millions of transactions that go on every week, transactional 
difficulties do pop up now and then.
The most common problem is the AWOL seller — the kind of person who 
pesters you for payment and then disappears. Just as you’re expected to 
hustle and get your payment off to the seller within a day or so, the seller 
has an obligation to notify you within a few days of receiving your payment 
with an e-mail that says the item has been shipped. If you sent the payment 
but you haven’t heard a peep in a while, don’t jump the gun and assume the 
person is trying to cheat you, but do follow up.

152
Part II: Buying Like an Expert 
Follow this week-by-week approach if you’ve already paid for the item but 
haven’t heard from the seller:
 
✓ Week one, the gentle-nudge approach: Remind the seller with an e-mail 
about the auction item, its number, and the closing date. “Perhaps this 
slipped your mind and got lost in the shuffle of your other auctions” is 
a good way to broach the subject. Chances are good that you’ll get an 
apologetic e-mail about some family emergency or last-minute business 
trip. You’ll find that the old saying “You can attract a lot more bees with 
honey than with vinegar” works great on eBay.
 
✓ Week two, the civil-but-firm approach: Send an e-mail again. Be civil but 
firm. Set a date for when you expect to be contacted. Meanwhile, tap into 
some of eBay’s resources. See the section “Getting Contact Information,” 
earlier in this chapter, to find out how to get an eBay user’s phone 
number. After you have this information, you can send a follow-up letter 
or make direct contact and set a deadline for some sort of action.
 
✓ Week three, take-action time: If you still haven’t heard from the seller, 
e-mail the seller once more and let him or her know that you’re filing a 
complaint. Then go to your My eBay Won area, and in the drop-down 
menu next to the item in question, choose Resolve a problem. You will 
then be able to open a case for an Item Not Received or for one stating 
that the item is Not as Described. Next, you will be taken to PayPal. See 
“Filing for a Refund” later in the chapter to see how the process will go. 
Also, turn to Chapter 16 to find out more about filing complaints and 
using other tools to resolve problems.
You Get the Item . . . Uh-Oh
What’s This?
The vast majority of eBay transactions go without a hitch. You win, you send 
your payment, you get the item, you check it out, you’re happy. If that’s the 
case — a happy result for your auction — skip this section and go leave some 
positive feedback for the seller!
On the other hand, if you’re not happy with the item you receive, the seller 
may have some ’splaining to do. E-mail or call the seller immediately and 
politely ask for an explanation if the item isn’t as described. Some indications 
of a foul-up are pretty obvious:
 
✓ The item’s color, shape, or size doesn’t match the description.
 
✓ The item’s scratched, broken, or dented in ways that don’t match the 
description (the description said the doll was new, but the box is 
tattered and the doll has seen more than its share of action).

153
 Chapter 8: After You Win the Item 
 
✓ You won an auction for a set of candlesticks and received a vase instead.
 
A snag in the transaction is annoying, but don’t get steamed right away. 
Contact the seller and see whether you can work things out. Keep the 
conversation civilized. The majority of sellers want a clean track record and 
good feedback, so they’ll respond to your concerns and make things right. 
Assume the best about the seller’s honesty, unless you have a real reason 
to suspect foul play. Remember, you take some risks whenever you buy 
something that you can’t touch. If the item has a slight problem that you 
can live with, leave it alone and don’t go to the trouble of leaving negative 
feedback about an otherwise pleasant, honest eBay seller.
Of course, while I can give you advice on what you deserve from a seller, 
you’re the one who has to live with the item. If you and the seller can’t reach 
a compromise and you really think you deserve a refund, ask for one.
If you paid the U.S. Postal Service to insure the item, and it arrives at your 
home pretty well pulverized, call the seller to alert him or her about the 
problem. Find out the details of the insurance purchased by the seller. After 
you have all the details, follow the seller’s instructions on how to make a 
claim. If the item was shipped through the post office, take the whole 
mangled shebang back to the post office and talk to the good folks there 
about filing a claim. Check out Chapter 12 for more tips on how to deal with 
a shipping catastrophe. And jump over to Chapter 16 to find out how to file 
your eBay and/or PayPal insurance claim.
Filing to Get a Refund through PayPal
If you’re item never arrives or (as described in the preceding section) isn’t 
what you expected based on the description, you are able to get a refund 
on tangible goods through PayPal. (This comes under the PayPal Buyer 
Protection plan.) To do so, follow these steps:
 
1. Go to your My eBay Won area, and in the drop-down menu next to the 
item in question, choose Resolve a problem.
 
2. Verify that this is the item in question.
 
3. Click Continue.
 
4. Click the Resolution Center tab and then the Resolution Center link to 
report your case.
 
 You will be able to negotiate with the seller. If the case can’t be 
resolved, you will be able to file a buyer protection claim.

154
Part II: Buying Like an Expert 
Don’t Forget to Leave Feedback
Good sellers should be rewarded, and potential buyers should be informed. 
That’s why no eBay transaction is complete until the buyer fills out the 
feedback form. Before leaving any feedback, though, always remember 
that sometimes no one’s really at fault when transactions get fouled up; 
communication meltdowns can happen to anyone. (For more info on leaving 
feedback, see Chapter 4.) Here are some scenarios that give you an idea on 
what kind of feedback to leave for a seller:
 
✓ Positive: If the transaction could have been a nightmare, but the seller 
really tried to make it right and meet you halfway, that’s an easy call — 
give the seller the benefit of the doubt and leave positive feedback.
 
✓ Positive: Whenever possible, reward someone who seems honest or tried 
to fix a bad situation. For example, if the seller worked at a snail’s pace but 
you eventually got your item and you’re thrilled with it, you may want to 
leave positive feedback with a caveat. Something like “Item as described, 
good seller, but very slow to deliver” sends the right feedback message.
 
✓ Neutral: If the seller worked at a snail’s pace and did adequate packaging 
and the item was kinda-sorta what you thought, you may want to leave 
neutral feedback; the transaction wasn’t bad enough for negative feedback 
but doesn’t deserve praise, either. Here’s an example of what you might 
say: “Really slow to deliver, didn’t say item condition was good not 
excellent, but did deliver.” Wishy-washy is okay as a response to so-so; at 
least the next buyer will know to ask very specific questions.
 
✓ Negative: If the seller never shipped your item or the item didn’t match 
the description when it arrived, and the seller won’t make things right, 
you need to leave negative feedback. Make sure that both conditions 
apply. Never write negative feedback in the heat of the moment and 
never make it personal. Keep it mellow and just state the facts. Do 
expect a response but don’t get into a negative feedback war. Life’s 
interesting enough without taking on extra hassles.
The Accidental Deadbeat might be an intriguing title for a movie someday, 
but being a deadbeat isn’t much fun in real life. See Chapter 6 for details on 
buyer’s remorse and retracting a bid before the end of an auction.
Properly Giving the Seller’s Detailed 
Star Rating (DSRs)
In addition to a feedback comment and rating (positive, negative, or neutral), 
buyers should leave detailed seller ratings, too. The DSR part of the feedback 
system asks you to rate sellers by filling in one to five stars. A 5-star rating 

155
 Chapter 8: After You Win the Item 
doesn’t cost you anything as the buyer, and if the seller is a PowerSeller, it 
can affect a discount they receive on their eBay fees. Table 8-1 outlines what 
the stars mean to me when I leave a rating.
Table 8-1 
What the DSR Stars Mean
Rating Question
# of Stars = Meaning
In the Real World
How accurate 
was the item’s 
description?
1 = Very inaccurate
2 = Inaccurate
3 = Neither inaccurate 
nor accurate
4 = Accurate
5 = Very accurate
In my world, the item was either 
described right or wrong — to 
me, there is no in-between. So 
when I rate a seller, either the 
item is as advertised or it isn’t.
How satisfied 
were you with 
the seller’s 
communication?
1 = Very unsatisfied
2 = Unsatisfied
3 = Neither unsatisfied 
nor satisfied
4 = Satisfied
5 = Very satisfied
As I buyer, I lean more with 
being very satisfied that I got 
enough communication from 
the seller, or not. If I get one 
e-mail, I’m usually satisfied. But 
if I haven’t heard from a seller 
until the item reaches my door, 
I’m definitely rating in the 2-star 
range.
How quickly did 
the seller ship 
the item?
1 = Very slowly
2 = Slowly

5 = Very quickly
Now, here I have another issue: 
As a buyer, you need to check 
the postmark on the package 
you receive. If the seller ships 
the next day or the next day 
after — you have to click 5 
(Very Quickly), no matter how 
long the postal service took to 
get it there. 
How reasonable 
were the 
shipping and 
handling 
charges?
1 = Very unreasonable
2 = Unreasonable
3 = Neither unreason-
able nor reasonable
4 = Reasonable
5 = Very reasonable
When I purchase an item, I 
know what the shipping cost 
will be. The only surprise here 
is when you get an item in a 
small envelope and you’ve 
paid $9.00 for shipping — or if 
you paid for Priority Mail and 
it comes in another class of 
service. This is, to me, pretty 
black-and-white. The shipping 
and handling charges are either 
reasonable or unreasonable.

Part II: Buying Like an Expert 
Here are some other items to keep in mind when you’re deciding on what 
Detailed Star Rating to leave for a seller:
 
✓ Shipping takes time: You have to realize that Ground shipping can take 
up to 10 days. This isn’t the seller’s fault. So before leaving this rating, 
make sure to check the postmark or the date on the shipping label.
 
✓ Shipping costs money: Sellers have to add a little to cover the costs of 
tape, boxes, and packing materials. As a buyer, you have to keep that in 
mind. If you are unfamiliar with postage rates, you should also know that 
a package costs a lot more to ship across the country than to ship to the 
next state. So do a little homework and evaluate shipping costs before 
you buy. If the shipping is too high, go to another seller.
If your seller is a PowerSeller, you should also know that your star ratings 
affect the fees he or she pays to eBay. Being a good seller (with high DSRs) 
can save as much as 20 percent on final value fees, so your rating is a very 
serious matter.

Part III
Making Money the 
eBay Way

In this part . . .
A
lot of different factors are at work when a seller 
makes a nice profit on an item he or she has put up 
for sale.
If you’re new to online selling, you can find out all the ben-
efits and get pointed in the right direction to find items 
that could make you a tidy profit. In fact, you may be sit-
ting on major profits hiding in your own home! eBay has 
its rules, though, so when you assess an item’s value to 
prepare for your listing, you need to make sure the item 
isn’t prohibited from being sold at the eBay site.
In this part, I walk you through the paperwork you need to 
fill out to list an item for selling, and I show you how to 
close the deal and ship the item without any hassles. But 
even though I’m good, I can’t stop problems from occur-
ring, which is why I try to walk you through (almost) 
every conceivable mishap. There’s also a chapter for 
those eBay newbies out there who already know that a 
picture’s worth a thousand words. That’s right — if you 
really want to make money on eBay, you can’t miss the 
advanced strategies.

Chapter 9
Selling in Your Bunny Slippers 
for Fun and Profit
In This Chapter
▶ Discovering the benefits of selling
▶ Looking for inventory in your own backyard
▶ Knowing what to sell, when to sell, and how much to ask
▶ Staying out of trouble — what you can’t sell on eBay
▶ Paying the piper with eBay fees
▶ Keeping the taxman happy (or at least off your back)
F
inding items to sell can be as easy as opening up your closet (kitchen 
cupboard? car trunk?) or as challenging as acquiring antiques overseas 
(I even took the leap and imported custom items from Taiwan to sell on 
eBay). Either way, establishing yourself as an eBay seller isn’t as difficult as it 
seems when you know the ropes. In this chapter, you find out how to look for 
items under your own roof, figure out what they’re worth, and turn them into 
ready cash. But before you pick your house clean (I know eBay can be habit-
forming, but please keep a few things for yourself!), read up on the eBay rules 
of the road — such as how to sell, when to sell, and what not to sell. If you’re 
interested in finding out how to set up your auction page, get acquainted 
with Chapter 10; if you want to read up on advanced selling strategies, the 
Appendix is where to find them.
Why Should You Sell Stuff on eBay?
Whether you need to clear out 35 years of odd and wacky knickknacks 
cluttering your basement or you seriously want to earn extra money, the 
benefits of selling on eBay are as diverse as the people doing the selling. The 
biggest plus to selling on eBay is wheeling and dealing from your home in 
pajamas and bunny slippers (every day is Casual Friday in my office — see 
Figure 9-1). But no matter where you conduct your business or how you 
dress, many more important big-time rewards exist for selling on eBay.

Most people starting a business have to worry about rounding up investment 
capital (start-up money they may lose), building inventory (buying stuff to 
sell), and finding a selling location such as a booth at a swap meet or even a 
small store. Today, even a little Mom-and-Pop start-up operation requires a 
major investment. eBay has helped to level the playing field a bit; everybody 
can get an equal chance to start a small business with just a little money. 
Anyone who wants to take a stab at doing business can get started with just 
enough money to cover the Insertion Fee.
Get a few transactions under your belt. Sell your old collection of postcards. 
See how you like the responsibilities of marketing, collecting money, shipping, 
and customer service. Grow a bit more, and you’ll find yourself spotting 
trends, acquiring inventory, and marketing your items for maximum profit. 
In no time, you’ll be making items disappear faster than David Copperfield 
(though you may have a little trouble with the Statue of Liberty — how’d he 
do that, anyway?). If you think you’re ready to make eBay a full- or part-time 
business, take a look at the Appendix. If you still want to go long on eBay, 
please take a look at my book, Starting an eBay Business For Dummies (Wiley 
Publishing, Inc). It gives you just what you need to ramp up from hobbyist 
to big-time eBay tycoon making a few hundred (or even thousand) dollars a 
month!

161
 Chapter 9: Selling in Your Bunny Slippers for Fun and Profit 
 
A fun way to get your feet wet on eBay is to buy some small items. When I say 
small, I mean it. Some of the least expensive items you can buy on eBay are 
recipes. Type recipe in the search box and sort the results by Lowest Prices 
First. You’ll find recipes for a dollar and under. You don’t have to pay a 
shipping charge, either. The sellers usually e-mail the recipe direct to you 
after the auction. You can also begin selling your very own secret recipes. 
This is a great way to become familiar with how eBay works, and you’ll be 
gaining experience with feedback — as well as building yours!
Finding Stuff to Sell
Finding merchandise to sell on eBay is as easy as checking your garage and 
as tough as climbing up to the attic. Just about anything you bought and 
stashed away (because you didn’t want it, forgot about it, or it didn’t fit) is 
fair game. Think about all those awful birthday and holiday presents (hey, 
it was the thought that counted — and the givers may have forgotten about 
them, too). Now you have a place you can try to unload them for cash. They 
could even make somebody happy.
In your closet, find what’s just hanging around:
 
✓ Clothing that no longer fits or is out of fashion. (Do you really want to 
keep it if you wouldn’t be caught dead in it or you know it will never fit?) 
Don’t forget the pair of shoes you wore once and put away.
Life lessons learned on eBay
If you have kids, get them involved with your 
eBay selling. They’ll get real-life lessons they 
can’t learn in school. Give them a feel for 
meeting deadlines and fulfilling promises. Get 
them writing e-mails (if they aren’t already) and 
helping to pack the items. eBay is a great place 
to learn basic economics and how to handle 
money. When I first started on eBay, I taught 
my preteen daughter about geography by using 
eBay. Every time I completed a transaction, 
she used a search engine to look up the city 
in which the buyer (or seller) lived — and then 
marked the city by placing a pin on a huge 
map of the United States. She graduated from 
college, having majored in business and 
marketing. (Thank you, eBay!)
Get creative and make eBay a profitable 
learning experience, too. Remember, however, 
that eBay doesn’t let anyone under the age of 
18 register, buy, or sell — so make sure you’re 
in charge of handling all transactions. Your kids 
can help out, but they need to be under your 
supervision at all times.

162
Part III: Making Money the eBay Way 
 
✓ Any item with a brand-name label that’s in new or almost-new condition.
 
✓ Kids’ clothes. (Kids outgrow things fast. Use profits from the old items 
to buy new clothes they can grow into. Now that’s recycling.)
 
Have the articles of clothing in the best condition possible before you put 
them up for sale. For example, shoes can be cleaned and buffed till they’re like 
new. According to eBay’s policies, clothing must be cleaned before shipping.
And consider what’s parked in your basement, garage, or attic:
 
✓ Old radios, stereo and video equipment, and 8-track systems: Watch 
these items fly out of your house — especially the 8-track players 
(believe it or not, people love ’em).
 
✓ Books you finished reading long ago and don’t want to read again: 
Some books with early copyright dates or first editions by famous 
authors earn big money on eBay.
 
✓ Leftovers from an abandoned hobby: Who knew that building 
miniature dollhouses was so much work?
 
✓ Unwanted gifts: Have a decade’s worth of birthday, graduation, or 
holiday gifts collecting dust? Put them up on eBay and hope Grandma 
or Grandpa doesn’t bid on them because they think you need another 
mustache spoon!
Saleable stuff may even be lounging around in your living room or bedroom:
 
✓ Home décor you want to change: Lamps, chairs, and rugs (especially if 
they’re antiques) sell quickly. If you think an item is valuable but you’re 
not sure, get it appraised first.
 
✓ Exercise equipment: If you’re like most people, you bought this stuff 
with every intention of getting in shape, but now all that’s building up 
is dust. Get some exercise carrying all that equipment to the post office 
after you’ve sold it on eBay.
 
✓ Records, videotapes, and laser discs: Sell them after you’ve upgraded to 
new audio and video formats such as DVD (Digital Versatile Disc) or DAT 
(Digital Audio Tape). (Think Betamax is dead? You may be surprised.)
 
✓ Autographs: All types of autographs — from sports figures, celebrities, 
and world leaders — are popular on eBay. A word of caution, though: 
A lot of fakes are on the market, so make sure that what you’re selling 
(or buying) is the real thing. If you’re planning on selling autographs 
on eBay, be sure to review the special rules that apply to these items. 
Here’s where to find them:

 Chapter 9: Selling in Your Bunny Slippers for Fun and Profit 
Know When to Sell
Warning . . . warning . . . I’m about to hit you with some of my clichés: Timing 
is everything. Sell what you know and know when to sell. Buy low and sell high. 
Fast quarters are better than slow dollars.
Okay, granted, clichés may be painful to hear over and over, but they do contain 
nuggets of good information. (Perhaps they’re well known for a reason?)
Experienced eBay sellers know that when planning a sale, timing is almost 
everything. Fur coats don’t sell well in July, and as a collectible seller you 
don’t want to be caught with 200 Nintendo games during a run on Xbox. 
(Hold on to them; vintage games still sell well.) Star Wars action figures are 
traditionally good sellers unless a new Star Trek movie is coming out.
Some items — such as good antiques, rugs, baseball cards, and sports cars — 
are timeless. But timing still counts. Don’t put your rare, antique paper cutter 
up for auction if someone else is selling one at the same time. I 
guarantee that will cut into your profits.
Snapping up profits
Way back in 1980, when Pac-Man ruled, my 
friend Ric decided to try his hand at photogra-
phy. Hoping to be the next Ansel Adams — or to 
at least snap something in focus — he bought 
a 1/4 Kowa 66, one of those cameras you hold 
in front of your belt buckle while you look down 
into the viewfinder. Soon after he bought the 
camera, Ric’s focus shifted. The camera sat in 
its box, instructions and all, for over 15 years 
until he threw a garage sale.
Ric and his wife didn’t know much about his 
Kowa, but they knew that it was worth some-
thing. When he got an offer of $80 for it at the 
garage sale, his wife whispered “eBay!” in his 
ear, and he turned down the offer.
Ric and his wife posted the camera on eBay 
with the little information they had about its 
size and color, and the couple was flooded with 
questions and information about the camera 
from knowledgeable bidders. One bidder said 
that the silver-toned lens made it more valu-
able. Another gave them the camera’s history.
Ric and his wife added each new bit of infor-
mation to their description and watched as the 
bids increased with their every addition — until 
that unused camera went for more than $400 
in a flurry of last-minute sniping in 1999. These 
days, when Ric posts an auction, he always 
asks for additional information and adds it to 
the auction page.
What difference does a year make? You’ll learn 
that the values of all items on eBay trend up 
and down. In 2000, this camera sold on eBay 
for over $600; in late 2001, it sold for $455. In the 
winter of 2003, interest in it was waning; it sold 
in the $375 to $400 range. In 2009, one sold for 
$390. Not bad considering everyone is saying 
film cameras are dead merchandise.

164
Part III: Making Money the eBay Way 
 
Timing is hardly an exact science. Rather, timing is a little bit of common 
sense, a dash of marketing, and a fair amount of information gathering. Do a 
little research among your friends. What are they interested in? Would they 
buy your item? Use eBay itself as a research tool. Search to see whether 
anyone’s making money on the same type of item. If people are crazed for 
some fad item and you have a bunch, yesterday was the time to sell. (In other 
words, if you want your money out of ’em, get crackin’ and get packin’.)
 
If the eBay market is already flooded with dozens of an item and no one is 
making money on them, you can afford to wait before you plan your auction.
Know Thy Stuff
At least that’s what Socrates would have said if he’d been an eBay seller. 
Haven’t had to do a homework assignment in a while? Time to dust off those 
old skills. Before selling your merchandise, do some digging to find out as 
much as you can about it.
Getting the goods on your goods
Here are some ideas to help you flesh out your knowledge of what you have 
to sell:
 
✓ Hit the books. Check your local library for books about the item. Study 
historic guides and collector magazines.
 
 Even though collectors still use published price guides when they put 
a value on an item, so much fast-moving e-commerce is on the Internet 
that price guides often lag behind the markets they cover. Take their 
prices with a grain of salt.
 
✓ Go surfin’. Conduct a Web search and look for info on the item on other 
auction sites. If you find a print magazine that strikes your fancy, check 
to see whether the magazine is available on the Web by typing the 
title of the magazine into your browser’s search window. (For detailed 
information on using search engines to conduct a more thorough online 
search, check out Chapter 5.)
 
✓ When the going gets tough, go shopping. Browse local stores that spe-
cialize in your item. Price the item at several locations.
 
 When you understand the demand for your product (whether it’s a col-
lectible or a commodity) and how much you can realistically ask for it, 
you’re on the right track to a successful auction.

165
 Chapter 9: Selling in Your Bunny Slippers for Fun and Profit 
 
✓ Call in the pros. Need a quick way to find the value of an item you 
want to sell? Call a dealer or a collector and say you want to buy one. A 
merchant who smells a sale will give you a current selling price.
 
✓ eBay to the rescue. eBay members often offer guidance for your 
research on the Community Boards and Chats. eBay has category-
specific chat rooms, where you can read what other collectors are 
writing about items in a particular category. (See Chapter 17 for more 
on eBay’s Chat area.)
For information on how items are graded and valued by professional 
collectors, jump to Chapter 5, where I discuss grading your items.
 
Be certain you know what you have — not only what it is and what it’s for, but 
also whether it’s genuine. Make sure it’s the real McCoy. You are responsible 
for your item’s authenticity; counterfeits and knock-offs are not welcome on 
eBay. In addition, manufacturers’ legal beagles are on the hunt for counterfeit 
and stolen goods circulating on eBay — and they will tip off law enforcement.
Spy versus spy: Comparison selling
Back in the old days, successful retailers like Gimbel and Macy spied on each 
other to figure out ways to get a leg up on the competition. Today, in the 
bustling world of e-commerce, the spying continues, and dipping into the 
intrigue of surveilling the competition is as easy as clicking your mouse.
Say that you’re the biggest Dukes of Hazzard fan ever and you collect Dukes 
of Hazzard stuff, such as VHS tapes from the show, movie memorabilia, 
General Lee models, and lunchboxes. Well, good news: That piece of tin that 
holds your lunchtime PB&J may very well fetch a nice sum of money. To 
find out for sure, you can do some research on eBay. To find out the current 
market price for a Dukes of Hazzard lunchbox, you can conduct a Completed 
Items search on the Search page (as described in Chapter 5) and find out 
exactly how many Dukes of Hazzard lunchboxes have been sold in the past 
few weeks. You can also find out their high selling prices and how many bids 
the lunchboxes received by the time the auctions were over. And repeating 
a completed search in a week or two is not a bad idea — you can get at least 
a month’s worth of data to price your item. Figure 9-2 shows the results of a 
Completed Items search sorted by highest prices first.
 
You can easily save your searches on eBay. Just click the Save This Search 
link in the top-right corner (refer to Figure 9-2) to add a search to your favorite 
searches. Then it’s on your My eBay Favorites page, and you can repeat the 
search with a click of your mouse.

Sometimes sellers make spelling errors when they write item titles. In the 
case of a Dukes of Hazzard lunchbox, when you conduct a search for such an 
item, I suggest that you use one of my favorite search tricks, which I featured 
in Chapter 5. The eBay search engine accommodates for one correction (as 
in hazard and hazzard) but when you want to check for two variations, you 
must input both. Type your search this way: dukes (hazzard,hazard) (“lunch 
box”,lunchbox). (Be sure that you drop the noise word of.) This way, you find 
all instances of dukes hazzard lunchbox and dukes hazard lunchbox.
Sure enough, when I tried this tactic, I found a considerable number of 
additional listings for a Dukes of Hazzard Lunchbox. Coincidentally, when 
I changed my search (remember, sellers do make mistakes) to dukes 
(hazzard,hazard) (“lunch box”,lunchbox), my search results went from 28 
lunchboxes to 32! The best deals for buyers (and for sellers to resell) are 
always when the seller misspells a name or brand in the title.
 
Always search for the same item with different word variations or spellings. 
This is about the only time “creative” spelling can help you.
 
Look at the pictures on individual auction item pages for each item that your 
Completed Items search turns up. That way, you can confirm that the items 
(lunchboxes, for example) are identical to the one you want to sell. And when 
you do your research, factor in your item’s condition. Read the individual item 
descriptions. If your item is in better condition, expect (and ask for) more 

167
 Chapter 9: Selling in Your Bunny Slippers for Fun and Profit 
money for it; if your item is in worse condition, expect (and ask for) less. Also, 
note the categories the items are listed under; they may give you a clue about 
where eBay members are looking for items just like yours.
If you want to be extremely thorough in your comparison selling, go to a 
search engine to see whether the results of your eBay search mesh with 
what’s going on elsewhere. If you find that no items like yours are for sale 
anywhere else online and are pretty sure people are looking for what you 
have, you may just find yourself in Fat City.
 
Don’t forget to factor in the history of an item when you assess its value. 
Getting an idea of what people are watching, listening to, and collecting can 
help you assess trends and figure out what’s hot. For more about using trend-
spotting skills to sniff out potential profits, take a look at the Appendix.
Know What You Can (and Can’t) Sell
The majority of items sold on eBay are aboveboard. But sometimes eBay 
finds out about listings that are either illegal (in the eyes of the state or 
federal government) or prohibited by eBay’s rules and regulations. In either 
case, eBay steps in, calls a foul, and makes the item invalid.
eBay doesn’t have rules and regulations just for the heck of it. eBay wants to 
keep you educated so you won’t unwittingly bid on, buy — or sell — an item that 
has been misrepresented. eBay also wants you to know what’s okay and what’s 
prohibited so that if you run across an item that looks fishy, you’ll help out your 
fellow eBay members by reporting it. And eBay wants you to know that getting 
your listing shut down is the least of your worries: You can be suspended if you 
knowingly list prohibited items. And I won’t even talk about criminal prosecution.
You need to know about these three categories:
 
✓ Prohibited lists the items that may not be sold on eBay under any 
circumstances.
 
✓ Questionable lists the items that may be sold under certain conditions.
 
✓ Potentially Infringing lists the types of items that may be in violation of 
copyrights, trademarks, or other rights.
 
You may not even offer to give away for free a prohibited or an infringing item, 
nor can you give away a questionable item that eBay disallows; giving it away 
doesn’t relieve you of potential liability.
 
The items that you absolutely cannot sell on eBay can fit into all three 
categories. Those items can be legally ambiguous at best — not to mention 
potentially risky and all kinds of sticky. To find a detailed description of which 
items are prohibited on the eBay Web site, follow these steps:

168
Part III: Making Money the eBay Way 
 
1. Click the Policies link, which is on the bottom of all eBay pages.
 
 You arrive at the friendly eBay Policies page.
 
2. Scroll to the Prohibited and Restricted items link and click.
 
 Ta-da! You are presented with the lists and links that will help you 
decipher whether selling your item falls within eBay’s policy boundaries.
 
 Or, if you don’t mind typing, you can go directly to pages.ebay.com/
help/policies/items-ov.html.
Sometimes an item is okay to own but not to sell. Other times the item is 
prohibited from being sold and possessed. To complicate matters even more, 
some items may be legal in one part of the United States but not in others. Or 
an item may be illegal in the United States but legal in other countries.
 
Because eBay’s base of operations is in California, United States law is 
enforced — even if both the buyer and seller are from other countries. Cuban 
cigars, for example, are legal to buy and sell in Canada, but even if the buyer 
and the seller are from Canada, eBay says “No permiso” and shuts down 
auctions of Havanas fast. Figure 9-3 shows an auction that was shut down 
soon after I found it.

169
 Chapter 9: Selling in Your Bunny Slippers for Fun and Profit 
Prohibited items
Even though possessing (and selling) many of the items in the following list 
is legal in the United States and elsewhere, you are absolutely, positively 
prohibited from buying and selling the following on eBay:
 
✓ Firearms of all types: This also means firearm accessories — including 
antique, collectible, sport, or hunting guns; air guns; BB guns; silencers; 
converters; kits for creating guns; gunpowder; high-capacity ammunition 
magazines (receptacles designed to feed ten rounds or more into a gun, 
not the publications about ammo); and armor-piercing bullets. You can’t 
even sell a gun that doesn’t work.
 
 You can buy and sell single bullets, shells, and even antique bombs and 
musket balls — as long as they have nothing explosive in them.
 
✓ Firearms and military weapons: No way can you sell any type of firearm 
that is designed to propel a metal (or similar) projectile, regardless of 
whether it works. Military weapons? Items included are bazookas, 
grenades, and mortars.
 
✓ Police and other law-enforcement badges and IDs: Stop in the name 
of the law if you’re thinking about buying or selling any of these items, 
including actual United States federal badges or imitation badges. In 
fact, selling just about any U.S. government badge can get you in hot 
water.
 
 You also can’t own or sell those agencies’ identification cards or credential 
cases or those really cool jackets they use in raids. Selling a copy or 
reproduction of any of these items is prohibited, too, because these 
items are copyrighted (see the section on infringing items in this chapter).
 
 If you find a badge that’s legal to sell and own, you need to provide a 
letter of authorization from the agency. The same letter of authorization 
is required for fake badges, such as reproductions or movie props.
 
✓ Replicas of official government identification documents or licenses: 
Birth certificates, drivers’ licenses, and passports fall into this category.
 
✓ Current vehicle license plates or plates that claim to resemble current 
ones: Note that expired license plates (at least 5 years old) are considered 
collectible — as long as they are no longer valid for use on a vehicle.
 
✓ Locksmithing devices: These items can be sold only to authorized 
recipients. Federal law prohibits the mailing of such devices.
 
✓ Human parts and remains: Hey, we all have two kidneys, but if you 
get the urge to sell one to pay your bills, eBay is not the place to sell it. 
You can’t sell your sperm, eggs, blood, or anything else you manage to 
extricate from your body. What’s more, you can’t even give away any of 
these items as a free bonus with one of your auctions.

170
Part III: Making Money the eBay Way 
 
✓ Drugs or drug paraphernalia: Narcotics, steroids, or other controlled 
substances may not be listed, as well as gamma hydroxybutyrate (GHB). 
Drug paraphernalia includes all items that are primarily intended or 
designed for use in manufacturing, concealing, or using a controlled 
substance, including 1960s-vintage cigarette papers, bongs, and water 
pipes.
 
✓ Anything that requires a prescription from a doctor, a dentist, or an 
optometrist to dispense: Listen, just because it’s legal to use doesn’t 
mean it doesn’t require special permission to get. For example, even 
though penicillin is legal to buy in the United States, only a doctor can 
prescribe it — which is why, when you get sick, you have to stand in 
that loooong line at the pharmacy sneezing on all the other sick people. 
And if you’re looking for Viagra auctions on eBay, don’t even go there.
 
✓ Stocks, bonds, or negotiable securities: Nope, you can’t sell stock in 
your new pie baking company or an investment in property you may 
own. And if you’re thinking of offering credit to someone, you can’t do 
that either. (Note that antiques and collectible items are permitted.)
 
✓ Bulk e-mail lists: No bulk e-mail or mailing lists that contain personal 
identifying information. You may not even sell tools or software 
designed to send unsolicited commercial e-mail.
 
✓ Pets and wildlife, including animal parts from endangered species: If 
you’ve had it with Buster, your pet ferret, don’t look to eBay for help in 
finding him a new home. And you can’t sell your stuffed spotted owls or 
rhino-horn love potions, either. If you’re in the animal business — any 
animal business — eBay is not the place for you.
 
✓ Child pornography: Note that this material is strictly prohibited on 
eBay, but you can sell other forms of erotica. (See the section later in 
this chapter about questionable items.)
 
✓ Forged items: Autographs from celebrities and sports figures are big 
business — and a big opportunity for forgers. Selling a forgery is a 
criminal act. The state of New York is taking the lead on this issue, 
investigating at least two dozen suspected forgery cases linked with 
online auctions.
 
 If you’re in the market for an autograph, don’t even consider bidding 
on one unless it comes with a Certificate of Authenticity (COA). Many 
sellers take authenticity so seriously that they give buyers the right to 
a full refund if any doubt about authenticity crops ups. Figure 9-4 shows 
an item that comes with a COA from an auction on eBay. Find out more 
about authentication services in Chapter 16.
 
✓ Items that infringe on someone else’s copyright or trademark: Take a 
look at the very next section for details on infringing items.
 
✓ Satellite and cable TV descramblers: Although the Internet is loaded 
with hardware and instructions on how to get around cable TV scrambling, 
eBay prohibits the sales of anything in this arena. After all, it is illegal to 
get around these technologies.

✓ Stolen items: Need I say more? (Seems obvious, but you’d be surprised.) 
If what you’re thinking about selling came to you by way of a five-finger 
discount, fell off a truck, or is hot, don’t sell it on eBay.

When bid-

the seller is

Ignorance is no excuse. If you list an item that’s in any way prohibited on 
eBay, eBay will end your auction. If you have any questions, always check 
eBay’s Trust & Safety department at pages.ebay.com/help/policies/

Infringing items
In school, if you copied someone’s work, you were busted for plagiarism. 
Even if you’ve been out of school for a while, you can get busted for copying 
someone else’s work. Profiting from a copy of someone else’s legally owned 
intellectual property is an infringement violation. Infringement, also known as 
piracy, is the encroachment on another person’s legal ownership rights on 
an item, a trademark, or a copyright. eBay prohibits the selling of infringing 
items at its site.
All the legal mumbo-jumbo, translated to English, comes down to this: 
Profiting from someone else’s idea, original work, or patented invention is 
very bad and can get you in hot water.
Here’s a checklist of no-no items commonly found at the center of infringe-
ment violations:

172
Part III: Making Money the eBay Way 
 
✓ Music that’s been recorded from an original compact disc, cassette tape, 
or record.
 
✓ Movies that have been recorded from an original DVD, laser disc, or 
commercial VHS tape.
 
✓ Television shows that have been recorded off the air, off cable, or from a 
satellite service.
 
 Selling a used original CD, tape, commercial VHS movie cassette, DVD, 
or CD-ROM is perfectly legal. Some television shows have sold episodes 
on tape; you can sell those originals as well. But if you’re tempted to 
sell a personal copy that you made of an original, you are committing an 
infringing violation.
 
✓ Software and computer games that have been copied from CD-ROMs or 
disks (and that includes hard drives — anybody’s).
 
✓ Counterfeit items (also called knock-offs), such as clothes and jewelry, 
that have been produced, copied, or imitated without the permission 
of the manufacturer. (Bart Simpson knock-off T-shirts abounded in the 
early ’90s.)
 
If you pick up a brand-name item dirt cheap from a discount store, you can 
check to see whether it’s counterfeit by taking a look at the label or comparing 
it on the Web with like items. If something isn’t quite right, the item is probably 
a knock-off.
 
Trademark and copyright protection don’t just cover software, music, and 
movies. Clothing, toys, sunglasses, and books are among the items covered 
by law.
Intellectual property owners actively defend their rights and, along with help 
from average eBay users, continually tip off eBay to fraudulent and infringing 
auctions. Rights owners can use eBay’s Verified Rights Owner (VeRO) program, 
as well as law-enforcement agencies. (See “VeRO to the Rescue,” later in this 
chapter, for info about the VeRO program.)
Hot property busted
In 1961, a young jockey named John Sellers won 
his first Kentucky Derby on a horse named Carry 
Back. He was so emotional about the victory 
that he was crying as he crossed the finish line. 
Seventeen years later, someone broke into his 
California home and stole his priceless trophy. 
But today, more than two decades after it was 
stolen, it’s back in his possession — thanks to 
an observant eBay member. The prized trophy 
was put up for auction in 1999 by a seller who 
had bought it legitimately. An eBay member 
who knows the history of the trophy saw that 
it was for sale and alerted the seller. The seller 
stopped the auction immediately, contacted 
the former jockey, and personally returned the 
trophy to him. Now that’s a great finish!

 Chapter 9: Selling in Your Bunny Slippers for Fun and Profit 
Questionable items: Know the laws
Because some items are prohibited in one place and not another, eBay lists 
a few items that you can trade but that are restricted and regulated. As a 
member of eBay, you’re responsible for knowing the restrictions in your 
area — as well as those on the eBay Web site.
Certain items are illegal in one geographic area and not another. This list 
mentions a few of the major questionables:
 
✓ Event tickets: Laws regarding the sale of event tickets vary from state to 
state, even city to city. Some laws prohibit reselling the ticket for a price 
higher than the amount printed on the face of the ticket. Some states 
limit the amount you can add to the ticket’s face value.
 
 If you’re planning to sell event tickets, visit pages.ebay.com/help/
policies/event-tickets.html for details. This page has details 
featuring the various states’ legal requirements. Be sure to double-check 
this page to be certain you’re following the appropriate laws for your 
area.
 
✓ Wine and alcohol: Selling wine and alcohol on eBay — and anywhere 
else, for that matter — is tricky business. For starters, you have no 
business in this business unless you’re at least 21 years old. eBay does 
not permit sales of any alcohol products unless they are sold for their 
“collectible” containers. You may sell alcoholic beverages for consumption 
if you have a liquor license and are preapproved by eBay. In the case of 
collectible bottles, some strict rules apply:
 
• The value must be in the collectible container, not in its contents. 
You can’t auction off your uncle’s Chateaux Margaux because the 
value is in the wine — not the bottle.
 
• The bottle must be unopened, and your auction must state that the 
contents are not meant for consumption.
 
• The container’s value must substantially exceed the price of the 
alcohol in the container, and it must not be available at a retail 
outlet.
 
• You must be sure that the buyer is at least 21 years old.
 
• You must be sure that the sale complies with all laws and ship-
ping rules. Every state has its own laws about shipping alcohol 
and wine. Some states require licenses to transport it; some limit 
the amount you can ship. You’re responsible for knowing what 
your state laws are (and you’re expected to conduct your auctions 
accordingly).

174
Part III: Making Money the eBay Way 
 
 For the latest news and all the clickable links you need to keep your 
wine-shipping business on the good side of the law, visit www.wine
institute.org/programs/shipwine/current_events/current_
events.htm or check with the Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC) 
agency of your state. The Wine Institute page also gives the latest info 
on the status of shipping wine in the United States.
 
✓ Erotica: Some forms of erotica are allowed on eBay. To see what eBay 
allows and what it prohibits, type pages.ebay.com/help/policies/
adult-only.html into your browser.
 
 One thing that’s definitely illegal, wrong, and criminal is child pornography. 
If someone reports that you’re selling child pornography, eBay forwards 
your registration information to law enforcement for criminal prosecution.
Forbidden items
The folks on eBay didn’t just fall off the turnip truck. eBay staffers have seen 
just about every scam to get around paying fees or following policy guidelines. 
Chances are good that if you try one of these scams, you’ll get caught. Then 
eBay cancels the listing. Do it once, and shame on you (don’t count on 
getting the listing fee credited back to you). Do it a lot, and you’re no longer 
welcome on eBay.
The following items are definitely forbidden:
 
✓ Raffles and prizes: You need to sell something in your auction; you can’t 
offer tickets or chances for a giveaway.
 
✓ Want ads: If you want something, you have to search for it. Don’t try 
to run your needs as an ad thinly disguised as an auction. Visit eBay’s 
Want-It-Now (pages.ebay.com/wantitnow/) section and legally post 
your wants and needs there.
 
✓ Advertisements: An eBay auction is not the place to make a sales pitch 
(other than attractive copy describing your item, that is). Some eBay 
bad guys list an auction name and then use the auction to send bidders 
to some other auction or Web site. The Real Estate category is one 
exception. You can run an ad there for your property. Look out for eBay 
to expand its ads in the future.
 
✓ Bait-and-switch tactics: These are a variation on the ugly old sales 
technique of pretending to sell what you’re not really selling. Some eBay 
users who are selling an unfamiliar brand of item try to snag bidders by 
putting a more familiar brand in the title. For instance, writing Designer 
Chanel purse — not really, but a lot like it! is a fake-out. eBay calls it 
keyword spamming. I call it lousy.

175
 Chapter 9: Selling in Your Bunny Slippers for Fun and Profit 
 
✓ Choice listings: You cannot offer your bidder a choice of significantly 
different items. But you can, if you’re selling a particular T-shirt, list 
small, medium, and large sizes.
 
✓ Mixing apples with oranges: This gambit tries to attract more bidders 
to view an item by putting it in a high-traffic category where it doesn’t 
belong. Forget it. eBay will move it for you if necessary, but keeping that 
rutabaga recipe book away from the list of automotive repair manuals is 
more considerate.
 
✓ Catalogs: “Buy my catalog so you can buy more stuff from me!” Uh-huh. 
I don’t know why anyone would put a bid on a catalog (unless it’s a 
Sears-Roebuck antique). If it’s only a booklet that shows off all the cool 
junk you’re selling, you can’t offer it as an auction item.
Reporting a Problem Listing
You probably don’t think that eBay can monitor millions of items for sale on 
a daily basis. You’re right; it can’t. eBay relies on eBay members like you to 
let it know when a shady listing is afoot. If you ever smell something fishy, for 
goodness’ sake, report it to eBay. Sometimes eBay takes a few days to cancel 
a listing, but rest assured that eBay invests a lot of time protecting its users 
from fraudulent auctions.
If you see something that just doesn’t look right, you should report the 
auction using an online form by clicking the Report Item link, which is below 
the Seller info box on every eBay item listing page.
 
eBay doesn’t personally prosecute its users. However, eBay does have a stake 
in protecting its honest users — and will act as an intermediary between 
honest eBay users and law-enforcement agencies.
VeRO to the Rescue
If you own intellectual property that you think is being infringed upon on 
the eBay site, you should take advantage of the eBay Verified Rights Owner 
(VeRO) program. Owners of trademarked or copyrighted items and logos, 
as well as other forms of intellectual property, can become members of this 
program for free.
You can find out more about the VeRO program by clicking the Help link above 
the main navigation bar. To get eBay’s current VeRO policy, go to pages.ebay.
com/help/tp/vero-rights-owner.html. Read the information, and if you 

176
Part III: Making Money the eBay Way 
qualify, click to download the form, fill it out, and fax it to eBay. Then you’re on 
your way to protecting your intellectual property from being auctioned to the 
highest bidder. Remember, only you can stop the infringement madness. If 
eBay agrees with you that your intellectual property is being infringed upon, it 
invalidates the auction and informs the seller by e-mail that the auction “is not 
authorized.” The high bidders in the auction are also notified and warned that 
they may be breaking the law if they continue the transaction.
I am a member of the Vero program. Should someone think it’s a good idea to 
scan and sell pirate copies of my books, I file my VeRO notice and the listing 
is removed within hours.
 
eBay understands that sometimes people don’t know that they’re selling 
infringing items, but it draws a hard line on repeat offenders. eBay not only 
shuts down the offenders’ auctions but also suspends repeat offenders of this 
ilk. Also, eBay cooperates with the proper authorities on behalf of its VeRO 
program members.
If eBay deems your auction invalid because the item doesn’t meet eBay’s 
policies and guidelines, you can find out why by checking the page at pages.
ebay.com/help/sell/questions/listing-ended.html. If you still feel 
you’re in the right, scroll down the page to the Contact Us link. Click there to 
plead your case.
eBay Fees? What eBay Fees? Oops . . .
The Cliché Police are going to raid me sooner or later, but here’s one I’m 
poking a few holes in this time around: You gotta spend it to make it. This 
old-time business chestnut means that you need to invest a fair amount of 
money before you can turn a profit. Although the principle still holds true in 
the real world (at least most of the time), on eBay you don’t have to spend 
much to run your business. This is one reason why eBay has become one of 
the most successful e-commerce companies on the Internet and a darling of 
Wall Street. eBay keeps fees low and volume high.
eBay charges the following types of fees for listing on the site:
 
✓ Regular auction insertion fees: $0.10 to $4.00.
 
✓ Fixed-price listing fees: Either $0.15 for media, such as books or DVDs, 
or $0.35.
 
✓ Real estate listing fees: Vary because you have the choice of listing 
your property as an ad rather than an auction. Because eBay real estate 
auctions are non-binding (due to legalities), you may be better off running 
an ad. eBay charges different prices for different types of real estate:

177
 Chapter 9: Selling in Your Bunny Slippers for Fun and Profit 
 
• Timeshares, manufactured homes, and land
 
 Auctions: 1-, 3-, 5-, 7-, or 10-day listing ($35.00); 30-day listing 
($50.00)
 
 Ad format: 30-day listing ($150.00); 90-day listing ($300.00)
 
• Residential, commercial, and other real estate
 
 Auctions: 1-, 3-, 5-, 7-, or 10-day listing ($100.00); 30-day listing 
($150.00)
 
 Ad format: 30-day listing ($150.00), 90-day listing ($300.00)
 
✓ Automotive fees: The first four listings are free, with subsequent listings 
$20.00; motorcycles are only $15.00.
 
✓ Additional reserve-auction fees: $2.00; auctions with reserves over 
$200.00 are 1 percent of the reserve with a maximum of $50.00.
 
✓ Final value fees: A percentage of the sales price.
 
✓ Optional fees: Vary.
Insertion fees
Every item listed on eBay is charged an insertion fee. There’s no way around it. 
The insertion fee is calculated on a sliding scale based on the minimum bid (your 
starting price), your fixed-sale price, or the reserve price (the secret lowest price 
that you’re willing to sell your item for) for your item. (Later in this chapter, I 
explain how the reserve price affects what you eventually have to pay.)
eBay understands that there’s not as much profit margin when you’re selling a 
media item, so they have a lower listing fee to encourage you. What’s a media 
item? New or used books, music, DVDs, movies, and video games. Take a look 
at Table 9-1 for eBay’s insertion fee structure.

178
Part III: Making Money the eBay Way 
If you’re running a reserve-price auction (explained in detail in Chapter 10), 
eBay bases its insertion fee on the reserve price, not the starting bid. eBay 
also charges a fee to run a reserve-price auction.
eBay has a different fee structure for items that are listed as fixed-price sales. 
They are quite the bargain, so if you have multiples of a single item and know 
what you need to get for them, a fixed-price sale is a great way to go! Do know 
that there is a slightly higher final value fee for fixed-price listings, but more 
on that later. Table 9-2 shows you the insertion charges for a fixed-price 
listing that can stay on the site for as long as 30 days!
Table 9-2 
Fixed-Price Insertion Fee
Fixed Price 
Insertion Fee
Insertion Fee for Media
$1.00 and more

Here’s a snapshot of how a reserve price affects your insertion fee. If you set a 
starting bid of $1.00 for a gold Rolex watch (say what?) but your reserve price 
is $5,000.00 (that’s more like it), you’re charged a $4.00 insertion fee based on 
the $5,000.00 reserve price plus a $50.00 reserve fee (1 percent of the reserve 
price). (See Table 9-5, later in this chapter, for the reserve auction fees.)
So what does the insertion fee buy you on eBay?
 
✓ A really snazzy-looking display page for your item that millions of eBay 
members can see, admire, and breathlessly respond to. (Well, we can 
only hope.)
 
✓ The use of eBay services, such as the Trust & Safety program, which 
protects your selling experience. (Chapter 16 tells you how to use Trust 
& Safety during and after your sale.)
Final value fees
If you follow the movie business, you hear about some big A-list stars who 
take a relatively small fee for making a film but negotiate a big percentage of 
the gross profits. This is known as a back-end deal — in effect, a commission 
based on how much the movie brings in. eBay does the same thing, taking 
a small insertion Fee when you list your item and then a commission on the 
back end when you sell your item. This commission is called the final value 
fee (FVF) and is based on the final selling price of your item.

179
 Chapter 9: Selling in Your Bunny Slippers for Fun and Profit 
 
eBay doesn’t charge a final value fee on an auction in the Real Estate/
Timeshares category as they do in other categories; instead, they charge a flat 
notice fee of $35.00. There’s no FVF fee for Timeshares, Manufactured Homes, 
and Land or Commercial or Residential. But in the Automotive category, you 
pay a flat transaction services fee of $40.00 for passenger vehicles and $30.00 
for motorcycles if your auction ends with a winning bidder (and the reserve 
has been met).
In real life, when you pay sales commissions on a big purchase such as a 
house, you usually pay a fixed percentage. eBay’s final value fee structure is 
different: It’s set up as a three-tiered system. Table 9-3 covers the calculation 
of final value fees for auctions.
Table 9-3 
Auction Final Value Fees
Closing Bid
To Find Your Final Value Fee
$0.01–$25.00
Multiply the final sale price by 8.75 percent. If the final sale 
price is $25.00, multiply 25 by 8.75 percent. You owe eBay 
$2.19.
$25.01–$1,000.00
You pay $2.19 for the first $25.00 of the final sale price 
(which is 8.75 percent). Subtract $25.00 from your final 
closing bid and then multiply this amount by 3.5 percent. 
Add this total to the $2.19 you owe for the first $25.00. 
The sum is what you owe eBay. If the final sale price 
is $1,000.00, multiply 975 by 0.035. (Hint: The answer is 
$34.13.) Now, add $34.13 and $1.31. You owe eBay $36.32.
$1,000.01 and over
You owe $2.18 for the first $25.00 of the final sale price 
(which is 8.75 percent). But you also have to pay $34.13 for 
the remainder of the price between $25.01 through $1,000 
(which is 3.5 percent). This amount is $36.32. Now, subtract 
$1,000.00 from the final sale price (you’ve already calculated 
those fees) and multiply the final sale amount that is over 
$1,000.00 by 1. 5 percent. Add this amount to $36.32. The 
sum is the amount you owe eBay. If the final sales price 
is $3,000.00, multiply $2,000.00 by 1.5 percent. (Hint: The 
answer is $30.) Add $36.32 to $30. The sum, $66.32, is what 
you owe eBay. (You won’t be graded on this.)
Table 9-3 shows where things get tricky. There are different final value fees 
(FVFs) for fixed-price items in different categories. Checking out the costs 
involved in the individual categories may help you decide which type of 
items you choose to sell. Table 9-4 is an attempt to clarify the tiers.

 Chapter 9: Selling in Your Bunny Slippers for Fun and Profit 
 
If you try to work out your own final value fees, you may get an extreme 
headache — and come up with fractional cents. Know that eBay rounds up 
fees of $0.005 and more and drops fees below $0.005. These roundings are 
done on a per-transaction basis, and generally even out over time.
 
Always keep track of the exact amount. Here’s why (you’re gonna love this): 
An item that is sold for $37.89 will show a final value fee of $1.67 on the View 
Account Status page (and in other areas where final value fees are displayed), 
although the exact amount of the final value fee is $1.670275. For display 
purposes the additional digits are rounded to the closest cent on invoices 
and other pages. However, the exact amount ($1.670275) — not the displayed 
amount — is used to calculate the total amount due on your invoice. Therefore, 
if several items have been sold, multiple line items showing final account fees 
that have been rounded to the nearest cent will appear on invoices and other 
pages, and the correctly calculated total balance will appear to be off by one 
or a few cents. (In other words, eBay charges you those fractions of a cent.) 
Here’s where you can get further details:
http:// pages.ebay.com/help/sell/invoice.html
 
Because of the sliding percentages, the higher the final selling price, the lower 
the commission eBay charges. (I guess math can be a beautiful thing, when 
applied for my benefit.)
Optional fees
You don’t have to pay a license fee and destination charge, but setting up 
your auction can be like buying a car. eBay has all sorts of options to jazz up 
your auction. (Sorry, eBay is fresh out of two-tone metallic paint — but how 
about a nice pair of fuzzy dice for your mirror?) I explain how all these bells, 
whistles, and white sidewalls dress up your auction in Chapter 10.
As a hint of things to come, Table 9-5 lists the eBay listing options and what 
they’ll cost you.

Keep current on your profits
When you’ve finished all the legwork needed to make some money, do some 
brain-work to keep track of your results. The best place to keep watch on 
your eBay sales is on your My eBay page, a great place to stay organized 
while you’re conducting all your eBay business. (I describe all the functions 
of the page in Chapter 4.) When it comes to calculating your bottom line, it’s 
best to get used to using a program like QuickBooks.
 
Here’s a checklist of what to watch out for after the auction closes:
 
✓ Keep an eye on how much you’re spending to place items up for sale 
on eBay. You don’t want any nasty surprises, and you don’t want to find 
out that you spent more money to set up your listing than you received 
selling your item.
 
✓ If you decide to turn your eBay selling into a business, keep track of 
your expenses for your taxes. (I explain Uncle Sam’s tax position on 
eBay next. Stay tuned.)
 
✓ Make sure that you get refunds and credits when they’re due.
 
✓ Double-check your figures to make certain eBay hasn’t made mistakes. 
If you have any questions about the accounting, let eBay know.

Uncle Sam Wants You — 
to Pay Your Taxes
What would a chapter about money be without a discussion of taxes? As Ben 
Franklin knew (and we’ve all found out since), you can’t escape death and 

184
Part III: Making Money the eBay Way 
taxes. (C’mon, it’s not a cliché; it’s traditional wisdom.) Whether in cyberspace 
or face-to-face life, never forget that Uncle Sam is always your business partner.
If you live outside the United States, check the tax laws in that country so you 
don’t end up with a headache down the road.
 
As with offline transactions, knowledge is power. The more you know about 
buying and selling on eBay before you actually start doing it, the more savvy 
the impression you make — and the more satisfying your experience.
For more details on taxes and bookkeeping, check out my book, Starting an 
eBay Business For Dummies (Wiley).
Two wild rumors about federal taxes
I’ve heard some rumors about not having to pay taxes on eBay profits. If you 
hear any variation on this theme, smile politely and don’t believe a word of 
it. I discuss two of the more popular (and seriously mistaken) tax notions 
running around the eBay community these days.
The U.S. government uses two laws on the books to go after eBay outlaws. 
One is the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Act, which prohibits deceptive 
or misleading transactions in commerce. The other is the Mail or Telephone 
Order Merchandise Rule, which requires sellers to ship merchandise in a 
timely manner or offer to refund a consumer’s money. The FTC is in charge of 
pursuing these violations. If you have a question about federal laws, you can 
find a lot of information online. For example, I found these three Web sites 
that keep fairly current lists of U.S. law and federal codes:
www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode
www.ftc.gov
www.fourmilab.ch/ustax/ustax.html
Rumor #1: E-commerce isn’t taxed
One story claims that “there will be no taxes on e-commerce sales (sales 
conducted online) for three years.” No one ever seems to know when those 
three years start or end.
 
Some people confuse state sales tax issues with income tax issues. You don’t 
pay Internet sales taxes, but that’s not the same as not reporting income from 
the Internet or selling within your home state.
Congress’s Internet Tax Freedom Act stated that until October 2001, Congress 
and state legislatures couldn’t institute new taxes on Internet transactions. 
President Bush signed a unanimously approved law that extended (through 
November 1, 2003) a ban on multiple and discriminatory Internet taxes and 
Internet-access taxes. (The moratorium did not apply to sales taxes or federal 

185
 Chapter 9: Selling in Your Bunny Slippers for Fun and Profit 
taxes.) The legislation also lengthened the “Sense of the Congress” resolution 
that there should be no federal taxes on Internet access or electronic commerce, 
and that the United States should work aggressively through the EU 
(European Union) and WTO (World Trade Organization) to keep electronic 
commerce free from tariffs and discriminatory taxes.
Even though November 1, 2003, has passed, there’s still discussion about the 
law. Some people want to exempt online merchants if they bring in less than 
$25,000 per year. Others say no taxes should be imposed unless the merchant 
has sales of $5 million a year.
 
Something new is on the horizon: the Streamlined Sales Tax Project (SSTA). 
Although the name of this government project may make it sound like the 
states will be charging state sales tax on all e-commerce purchases, the 
reality isn’t that simple. The battle is ongoing — and though I don’t feel 
that eBay sellers with sales under $100,000 a year have much to fear, I still 
recommend that you do a Google search on the SSTA every once in a while to 
keep up-to-date.
As of this writing, the rules are up in the air. Please continue to check my 
Web site, www.coolebaytools.com, for news on the SSTA when it applies.
Rumor #2: Profits from garage sales are tax-exempt
“eBay is like a garage sale, and you don’t have to pay taxes on garage sales.” 
(Uh-huh. And the calories in ice cream don’t count if you eat it out of the 
carton. Who comes up with this stuff anyway?)
This notion is just an urban (or shall I say suburban) legend — somebody’s 
wishful thinking that’s become folklore. If you make money on a garage sale, 
you have to declare it as income — just like anything else you make money 
on. Most people never make any money on garage sales because they usually 
sell things for far less than they bought them for. However, the opposite is 
often true of an eBay transaction.
 
Even if you lose money, you may have to prove it to the government, especially 
if you’re running a small business. You most definitely should have a heart-
to-heart talk with your accountant or tax professional as to how to file your 
taxes. If something might look bad in an audit if you don’t declare it, consider 
that a big hint.
To get the reliable word, I checked with the IRS’s e-commerce office. The 
good folks there told me that even if you make as little as a buck on any 
eBay sale after all your expenses (the cost of the item, eBay fees, shipping 
charges), you still have to declare it as income on your federal tax return.
If you have questions about eBay sales and your taxes, check with your 
personal accountant, call the IRS Help Line at 800-829-1040, or visit the IRS 
Web site at www.irs.ustreas.gov. And be friendly. (Just in case.)

186
Part III: Making Money the eBay Way 
State sales tax
If your state has sales tax, a sales tax number is required before you officially 
sell something. If sales tax applies, you may have to collect the appropriate 
sales tax for every sale that falls within the state that your business is in. A 
1992 U.S. Supreme Court decision said that states can only require sellers 
that have a physical presence in the same state as the consumer to collect 
so-called use taxes.
To find the regulations for your state, visit one of the following sites, which 
supply links to every state’s tax board. The tax board should have the 
answers to your questions.
www.taxsites.com/agencies.html
www.aicpa.org/yellow/yptstax.htm
State income taxes
Yes, it’s true. Not only is Uncle Sam in Washington, D.C., looking for his slice 
of your eBay profits, but your state government may be hankering to join the 
feast.
 
If you have a good accountant, give that esteemed individual a call. If you 
don’t have one, find a tax professional in your area. Tax professionals actually 
do more than just process your income tax returns once a year; they can help 
you avoid major pitfalls even before April 15.
Here’s how to find out what your responsibilities are in your home state:
 
✓ You may need to collect and pay state sales taxes, but only if you sell to 
someone in your state.
 
✓ You can get tax information online at this Web site:
www.taxadmin.org/fta/rate/tax_stru.html
 
 The site has links to tax information for all 50 states.
 
✓ You can also call your state tax office and let the good folks there 
explain the requirements. The state tax office should be listed in the 
government section of your phone book.

I
t’s time to make some money? Are you ready? Yes? (Call it an inspired 
guess.) You’re on the threshold of adding your items to the hundreds of 
thousands that go up for sale on eBay every day (and perhaps also shedding 
from your home some of the valuable things you haven’t touched in years). 
Some listings are so hot that the sellers quadruple their investments. Other 
items, unfortunately, are so stone cold that they may not even register a 
single bid.
In this chapter, I explain all the facets of the Sell an Item page — the page 
you fill out to get your auction going on eBay. You get some advice that can 
increase your odds of making money, and you find out the best way to position 
your item so buyers can see it and bid on it. I also show you how to modify, 
relist, or end your auction whenever you need to.
 
A caveat here: To keep the marketplace vibrant, eBay’s programmers are 
constantly working to improve the site, and improvement means change. The 
listing form (as I describe in this chapter) can change from time to time, but 
the basic decisions you need to make will not. The selling philosophy laid out 
in this chapter should help you ride the waves of change on eBay — whatever 
they may be.

188
Part III: Making Money the eBay Way 
Getting Ready to List Your Item
After you decide what you want to sell, find out as much as you can about it 
and conduct a little market research. Then you should have a good idea of 
the item’s popularity and value. To get this info, check out Chapter 9.
Before you list your item, make sure that you have these bases covered:
 
✓ The specific category under which you want the item listed: Ask your 
friends or family where they’d look for such an item and remember the 
categories you saw most frequently when you conducted your market 
research with the eBay search function.
 
 To find out which category will pay off best for your item, run a search 
and then check Completed Listings. See how many of this type of item 
are selling now (and if people are actually bidding on it). Scroll down 
to the left of the page and click the Show Only Completed Listings box. 
Then sort your results by highest prices first and look over the sales to 
see which categories they’re listed in. For more information on how to 
get ahead of the crowd through eBay’s search, visit Chapter 5.
 
✓ What you want to say in your item description: Jot down your ideas. 
Take a good look at your item and make a list of keywords that describe 
your item. Keywords are single descriptive words that can include the 
following (this is hardly a complete list):
 
• Brand name
 
• Size of the item (citing measurements if appropriate)
 
• Age or date of manufacture
 
• Condition
 
• Rarity
 
• Color
 
• Size
 
• Material
 
 I know all about writer’s block. If you’re daunted by the Sell an Item 
page, struggle through it anyway. This way you’ve finished the hard 
work before you even begin.
 
✓ Whether you want to attach a picture (or pictures) to your description 
via a Uniform Resource Locator (URL): Pictures help sell items, but you 
don’t have to use them. (This information won’t be on the test, but if you 
want to know more about using pictures in your auctions, see Chapter 14.)
 
✓ The price at which you think you can sell the item. Be as realistic as 
you can. (That’s where your market research comes in.)

189
 Chapter 10: Time to Sell: Completing the Cyber Paperwork
Examining the Sell an Item Page
The Sell an Item form is where your listing is born. Filling out your virtual 
paperwork requires a few minutes of clicking, typing, and answering all kinds 
of questions. The good news is that when you’re finished, your listing is up 
and running and (I hope) starting to earn you money.
 
Before you begin, you have to be a registered eBay user. If you still need to 
register, go to Chapter 2 and fill out the preliminary online paperwork. If 
you’ve registered but haven’t provided eBay with your financial information 
(credit card or checking account), you’ll be asked for this information to set 
up your seller account before you proceed. Fill in the data on the secure form. 
Then you’re ready to roll.
Just like the dizzying menu in a Chinese restaurant, you have four ways to 
sell an item on eBay. Four ways may not seem to be very dizzying, unless 
you’re trying to psychically decide which format is the best for you. Here’s 
what you need to know about each type:
 
✓ Online auction: This is the tried-and-true traditional sale format on 
eBay. This is what the newbies look for, and you can combine this with 
a Buy It Now for those who want the item immediately. Often, if you’re 
selling a collectible item, letting it go to auction may net you a much 
higher profit — remember to do your research before listing.
 
✓ Fixed price: Just like shopping at the corner store, a fixed-price sale is 
easy for the buyer to comprehend and complete. The only problem is 
that many potential buyers may lean toward an auction because of the 
perception that they may get a better deal.
 
 A variation on a fixed-price listing is to add the Make an offer option. 
This enables buyers to think they can get a great deal — but you have 
the opportunity to accept the offer or make a counteroffer. Cultural 
leanings toward bargaining mean some buyers prefer this method. You 
may not. It can be fun and is just another way to spur sales in a slow 
retail environment.
 
✓ Sell in your eBay store: Chapter 11 covers eBay Stores — a convenient 
place to sell more items to your auctions or fixed-price sales.
 
✓ Classified ad: If you don’t want to put your property or other valuable 
item up for auction and you’d like to correspond with the prospective 
buyer, this is the option for you. Although this option originated with 
real estate, the ad format is available in many categories. The cost of 
your ad is $9.95 for a 30-day listing. If you’re interested in finding out 
which type of items you can sell with a classified ad, check out this URL:

190
Part III: Making Money the eBay Way 
Say, for example, that you want to list a good, old-fashioned eBay auction. 
You want to sell an item for a fixed price but are willing to let it go to auction.
To find eBay’s Sell an Item form from the eBay Home page, you can use either 
of these methods:
 
✓ Click the Sell link on the navigation bar at the top of the page. eBay 
allows you to select your category and download the Sell an Item page in 
seconds.
 
✓ Start your listing from your My eBay page. Just click the Sell Similar link 
(on the All Selling page) next to one of your existing items. Using the 
form that appears, you can change the item data.
When listing your item, here’s the info you’re asked to fill out (each of these 
items is discussed in detail later in this chapter):
 
✓ Category: The category where you’ve decided to list your item 
(required).
 
✓ Title: The name of your item (required).
 
✓ Description: What you want to tell eBay buyers about your item (required).
 
✓ eBay Picture Services or Image URL: The Web address of any pictures 
you want to add (optional). To add the URL of image on the Sell an Item 
form, you must click the Customize Form link at the top of the page and 
add the option to include a URL (versus using eBay picture services). 
Note that you get a free Preview picture at the top of your auction. 
Chapter 14 has more information on using images in your auction.
 
✓ The Gallery: By adding a picture, you can add your item’s picture to 
eBay’s photo Gallery (optional). There is no extra charge to add the item 
to the Gallery, but it will set you back $0.75 to have a Gallery image that 
gets larger when a user drags his or her mouse over it, and $19.95 to 
make your item a featured auction in the Gallery. (You can find more on 
the Gallery later in this chapter.)
 
✓ Gallery image URL: If you want to include a hosted image, you must 
include the Web address of the JPEG image you want to place in the 
Gallery (optional). (If you’re using eBay Picture Services, the first photo 
you upload is resized for the Gallery.) See Chapter 14.
 
✓ Item location: The region, city, and country from which the item will be 
shipped (required).
 
✓ Quantity: The number of items you’re offering in this auction is always 
one (required).
 
✓ Starting price: The starting price (sometimes called a minimum bid) you 
set (required).
 
✓ Selling price: If this is a fixed-price listing, you have to post your selling 
price.

191
 Chapter 10: Time to Sell: Completing the Cyber Paperwork
 
✓ Duration: The number of days you want the auction to run (required).
 
✓ Reserve price: The hidden target price you set. This is the price that 
must be met before this item can be sold (optional). eBay charges you a 
fee for this feature.
 
✓ Private auction: You can keep the identity of all bidders secret with 
this option (optional). This type of auction is used only in special 
circumstances.
 
✓ Buy It Now: You can sell your item directly to the first buyer who meets 
this price (optional).
 
✓ List item in two categories: If you want to double your exposure, you 
can list your item in two categories. Note that double exposure equals 
double listing fees (optional).
 
✓ Home page featured: You can place your auction in a premium viewing 
section and have the possibility that your listing will cycle through the 
direct links from the front page (optional). eBay charges $59.95 for 
auction or fixed-price listings from 1 to 10 days and $179.95 extra for 
fixed-price items that stay on the site for 30 days.
 
✓ Featured First: You can have your auction appear at the top of the 
category in which you list it (optional). eBay charges $24.95 extra for 
this feature; $74.95 for listings that last 30 days.
 
✓ Highlight: Your item title is highlighted in the auction listings and 
search listings with a lilac-colored band, which may draw eBay members’ 
eyes right to your auction (optional). eBay charges $5.00 extra for this 
feature and $10.00 for the 30-day listings.
 
✓ Boldface title: A selling option to make your item listing stand out. eBay 
charges $2.00 ($4.00 for 30 days) extra for this feature (optional).
 
✓ Free counter: If you want to avail yourself of a free counter, indicate so 
here (optional).
 
✓ Ship-to locations: Here’s where you can indicate where you’re willing to 
ship an item. If you don’t want the hassle of shipping out of the United 
States, check that option only. You can individually select different 
countries as well (optional).
 
 You may want to consider whether you really want to be in the 
international shipping business. Buyers pick up the tab, but you have 
to deal with customs forms and post office paperwork. If time is money, 
you may want to skip it entirely — or at least have all the forms filled out 
before you get in line at the post office. (Better yet, print your customs 
forms along with your postage from your computer — see Chapter 12). 
But remember that if you don’t ship internationally, you’re blocking a 
bunch of possible high bidders. Depending on what you’re selling, 
shipping internationally may or may not be worth the investment in 
extra time.

192
Part III: Making Money the eBay Way 
 
✓ Shipping and handling charges: eBay requires you to show your shipping 
charge in the listing. Buyers are more likely to bid or buy right then 
and there if they feel your shipping costs are reasonable. If they have 
to e-mail you with questions, they may find another listing for the same 
item — with clear shipping — and bid or buy that one. Also, when you 
list a flat shipping charge on your listing, eBay will take that into account 
when deciding how your item shows up in Search. For larger items, see 
information on eBay’s handy shipping calculator, later in this chapter.
 
✓ Payment instructions: Here’s the place you put any after-sale information. 
You are required to accept PayPal or at least one electronic payment 
or Internet merchant credit card option for your items. (These are the 
safest options anyway.) If you want to offer the option to pay with a 
different electronic payment service, mention that as well. This 
information appears at the top of your sale when the sale is completed, 
under the Shipping and Payments tab of the listing while it’s active, and 
in the End of Listing e-mail (optional).
 
✓ PayPal and immediate payment: Fill in this area if you want to require 
the high bidder to pay through PayPal immediately when using Buy 
It Now. Add the Immediate Payment option if you know the shipping 
amount and would like the winner to pay with a click of the mouse 
(optional).
 
✓ Return policy: If you are willing to accept returns, indicate it. You can 
give the customer as few as three days to return the item (that cuts 
down on spurious returns).
Filling in the Required Blanks
Yes, the Sell an Item form looks daunting, but filling out its many sections 
doesn’t take as long as you may think. Some of the questions you’re asked 
aren’t things you even have to think about; just click an answer and off you 
go. Other questions ask you to type information. Don’t sweat a thing; all the 
answers you need are right here. In this section I describe all the required 
info; later in this chapter, I talk about optional stuff. After you click your 
category, you land on the official Sell an Item page.
Selecting a category
Many eBay sellers will tell you that selecting the exact category isn’t crucial 
to achieving the highest price for your item — and they’re right. The bulk of 
buyers (who know what they’re looking for) just input search keywords into 
eBay’s search box and look for their items. Others, though, may select a 
category and, just like when you go to the mall, peruse the items for sale and 
see if a particular one strikes their fancy.

193
 Chapter 10: Time to Sell: Completing the Cyber Paperwork
On the first page of the Sell an Item form, you need to select the main category 
for your item. Type at least three keywords that best describe your item in 
the box provided and click Search. Figure 10-1 shows you how the results 
come up after typing your words, making it easy to select a main category.
 
Figure 10-1: 
Let eBay

the work 
in finding

category for

Here’s where your creativity can come into play. Who says that a box of Blue 
Dog (the famous doggie icon painted by Cajun artist George Rodrigue) note 
cards belongs in Everything Else: Gifts & Occasions: Greeting Cards: Other Cards. 
If you look around, you may find a better category. The Find Categories tool 
appears the second you open the Sell an Item page. Just click the associated 
link to browse for categories. Check to see if anyone else is selling the item 
(and in which category) or just let this tool help you pick a good category.
You can also browse the categories by clicking (surprise!) the Browse 
Categories tab. This will help you select your main category, and the 
thousands of subcategories. eBay offers you this wealth of choices in a 
handy point-and-click way. If you’re unfamiliar with the types of items you 
can actually find in those categories, you may want to pore over Chapter 3 
before you choose a category to describe your item. Figure 10-2 shows you 
how to manually narrow the subcategory listings on the Sell an Item page.
To select a category, here’s the drill:
 
1. Click one of the main categories.
 
 In the next box, you see a list of subcategories.
 
2. Select the most appropriate subcategory.
 
3. Continue selecting subcategories until you have narrowed your item 
listing as much as possible.

194
Part III: Making Money the eBay Way 
 
 You know you’ve come to the last subcategory when you don’t see any 
more right-pointing arrows in the Categories.
 
Figure 10-2: 
Narrowing 
your sub-
categories.
 
 
Most bidders scan for specific items in subcategories. For example, if you’re 
selling a Bakelite fruit pin, don’t just list it under Jewelry; keep narrowing 
your choices. In this case, you can put it in a costume jewelry category that is 
especially for Bakelite. I guarantee that the real Bakelite jewelry collectors out 
there know where to look to find the jewelry they love. To narrow the 
category of your item, just keep clicking until you hit the end of the line.
Some subcategories aren’t for everyone
If you’ve chosen to list an item, bid on an item, 
or even just browse in the Everything Else: 
Mature Audiences category, you need to follow 
separate, specific guidelines because that 
category contains graphic nudity or sexual 
content that may offend some community 
members. You must
 ✓ Be at least 18 years of age (but you already 
know that all eBay customers must be 18 or 
older).
 ✓ Have a valid credit card.
 ✓ Complete a waiver stating that you’re vol-
untarily choosing to access adults-only 
materials. For more on how to do this (and 
a handy primer on privacy issues), see 
Chapter 15.
If you have Adult/Erotica items that you’d like to 
sell in a private auction, study the section later 
in this chapter that details the Private Auction 
option.

195
 Chapter 10: Time to Sell: Completing the Cyber Paperwork
Creating the perfect item title
After you figure out what category you want to list in, eBay wants to get down 
to the nitty-gritty — what the heck to call that thing you’re trying to sell.
 
Think of your item title as a great newspaper headline. The most valuable real 
estate on eBay is the 55-character title of your item. The majority of buyers 
do title searches, and that’s where your item must come up to be sold! Give the 
most essential information right away to grab the eye of the reader who’s just 
browsing. Be clear and informative enough to get noticed by eBay’s search 
engine. Figure 10-3 shows examples of good titles. Note how a few of these 
titles contain subtitles (more info on subtitles further in this chapter).
 
Figure 10-3: 
These item 
titles are 
effective 
because 
they’re 
clear and 
concise.
 
Here are some ideas to help you write your item title:
 
✓ Use the most common name for the item.
 
✓ If the item is rare, vintage, or hard to find, mention that.
 
✓ State the item’s condition and whether it’s new or old.
 
✓ Include the item’s special qualities, such as its style, model, or edition.
 
✓ Avoid fancy punctuation or unusual characters, such as $, hyphens, and 
L@@K, because they just clutter up the title — and buyers don’t search 
for them.
When you get into advanced selling mode, you should take a look at one of 
my other books, coauthored by Patti Louise Ruby, eBay Listings That Sell For 
Dummies. It covers eBay photography and HTML in depth.

Ordinarily, I don’t throw out French phrases just for the fun of it. But where 
making a profit is an issue, I definitely have to agree with the French that 
choosing or not choosing le mot juste can mean the difference between 
having potential bidders merely see your auction and having an all-out 
bidding war on your hands. Read on for tips about picking the best words to 
let your listing shine.
Look for a phrase that pays
Here’s a crash course in eBay lingo that can help bring you up-to-speed on 
attracting buyers to your item. The following words are used frequently in 
eBay listings, and they can do wonders to jump-start your title:
 
✓ Mint
 
✓ One of a kind (or OOAK — see the abbreviation list in Table 10-1)
 
✓ Vintage
 
✓ Collectible
 
✓ Rare
 
✓ Unique
 
✓ Primitive
 
✓ Well-loved
There’s a whole science (called grading) to figuring out the value of a 
collectible. You’re ahead of the game if you have a pretty good idea of what 
most eBay members mean. Do your homework before you assign a grade to 
your item. If you need more information on what these grades actually mean, 
Chapter 5 provides a translation.

grown, so has the lingo that members use as shortcuts to describe their 
merchandise.
Table 10-1 gives you a handy list of common abbreviations and phrases used 
to describe items. (Hint: Mint means “may as well be brand new,” not “cool 
chocolate treat attached.”)

What It Means
MIB
Mint in Box
The item is in the original box, in great shape, and 
just the way you’d expect to find it in a store.
MOC
Mint on Card
The item is mounted on its original display card, 
attached with the original fastenings, in store-new 
condition.
NRFB
Never Removed 
from Box
Just what it says, as in “bought but never opened.”
COA
Certificate of 
Authenticity
Documentation that vouches for the genuineness 
of an item, such as an autograph or painting.
OEM
Original 
Equipment 
Manufacture
You’re selling the item and all the equipment that 
originally came with it, but you don’t have the origi-
nal box, owner’s manual, or instructions.
OOAK
One of a Kind
You are selling the only one in existence!
NR
No Reserve 
Price
A reserve price is the price you can set when you 
begin your auction. If bids don’t meet the reserve, 
you don’t have to sell. Many buyers don’t like 
reserve prices because they don’t think that they 
can get a bargain. (For tips on how to allay these 
fears and get those bids in reserve-price auctions, 
see “Writing your description” later in this chap-
ter.) If you’re not listing a reserve for your item, let 
bidders know.
HTF, 
OOP
Hard to Find, 
Out of Print
Out of print, only a few ever made, or people 
grabbed up all there were. (HTF doesn’t mean you 
spent a week looking for it in the attic.)
Often, you can rely on eBay slang to get your point across, but make sure 
that you mean it and that you’re using it accurately. Don’t label something 
MIB (Mint in Box) when it looks like it’s been Mashed in Box by a meat 
grinder. You can find more abbreviations on my Web site, www.cool
ebaytools.com.

Part III: Making Money the eBay Way 
Don’t let your title ruin your auction
Imagine going to a supermarket and asking someone to show you where the 
stringy stuff that you boil is instead of asking where the spaghetti is. You 
might end up with mung bean sprouts — delicious to some but hardly what 
you had in mind. That’s why you should check and recheck your spelling. 
Savvy buyers use the eBay search engine to find merchandise; if the name 
of your item is spelled wrong, the search engine can’t find it. Poor spelling 
and incomprehensible grammar also reflect badly on you. If you’re in 
competition with another seller, the buyer is likelier to trust the seller hoo 
nose gud speling.
 
If you’ve finished writing your item title and you have spaces left over, please 
fight the urge to dress it up with lots of asterisks and exclamation points!!!!!!!!!!! 
(See how annoying that is?) No matter how gung-ho you are about your 
item, the eBay search engine may overlook your item if the title is encrusted 
with meaningless **** and !!!! symbols. If bidders do see your title, they may 
become annoyed by the virtual shrillness and ignore it anyway!!!!!!!! (It’s even 
more annoying the second time around.)
Another distracting habit is overdoing capital letters. To buyers, seeing 
everything in caps is LIKE SEEING A CRAZED SALESMAN SCREAMING AT 
THEM TO BUY NOW! Using all caps is considered shouting, which is rude 
and tough on the eyes. Use capitalization SPARINGLY, and only to finesse a 
particular point.
Giving the title punch with a subtitle
A new feature on eBay is the availability of subtitles. eBay allows you to 
buy an additional 55 characters, which will appear under your item title in a 
search. The fee for this extra promotion is $0.50, and in a few circumstances, 
it is definitely worth your while. Any text that you input will really make 
your item stand out in the crowd — but (you knew there would be a but 
didn’t you?) these additional 55 characters won’t come up in a title search. 
In other words, if the subtitle includes essential information (“NR MIMB,” for 
example) that isn’t in the main title, people searching for NR MIMB won’t find 
your listing. So if you have all those words in your description, the words will 
be found either way with a title and description search. If you choose this 
option, choose attention-getting info that isn’t absolutely needed for the title 
itself.
Writing your description
After you hook potential bidders with your title, reel ’em in with a fabulous 
description. Don’t think Hemingway here; think infomercial (the classier the 
better). Figure 10-4 shows a great description of some silver dollars. You can 
write a magnificent description, as well — all you have to do is click in the 
box and start typing.

 Chapter 10: Time to Sell: Completing the Cyber Paperwork
 
Figure 10-4: 
Writing 
a good 
descrip-
tion can 
mean the 
difference 
between 
success and 
failure.
 
Here’s a list of suggestions for writing an item description:
 
✓ Accentuate the positive: Give the buyer a reason to buy your item and 
be enthusiastic when you list all the reasons everyone should bid on it. 
Unlike the title, you can use as much space as you want. Even if you use 
a photo, be precise in your description — its size, color, kind of fabric, 
design, and so on. Refer to “Creating the perfect item title” earlier in this 
chapter, as well as Table 10-1, for ideas on what to emphasize and how 
to word your description.
 
✓ Include the negative: Don’t hide the truth of your item’s condition. 
Trying to conceal flaws costs you in the long run: You’ll get tagged 
with bad feedback. If the item has a scratch, a nick, a dent, a crack, a 
ding, a tear, a rip, missing pieces, replacement parts, faded color, dirty 
smudges, or a bad smell (especially if cleaning might damage the item), 
mention it in the description. If your item has been overhauled, rebuilt, 
repainted, or hot-rodded (say, a “Pentium computer” that was a 386 
until you put in the new motherboard), say so. You don’t want the buyer 
to send back your merchandise because you weren’t truthful about 
imperfections or modifications. This type of omission can lead to a fraud 
investigation.
 
✓ Be precise about all the logistical details of the post-auction transaction: 
Even though you’re not required to list any special S&H (shipping and 
handling) or payment requirements in your item description, the 
majority of eBay users do. Try to figure out the cost of shipping the 
item in the United States and add that to your description. If you offer 
shipping insurance, add it to your item description.

200
Part III: Making Money the eBay Way 
 
✓ While you’re at it, promote yourself too: As you accumulate positive 
feedback, tell potential bidders about your terrific track record. Add 
statements like “I’m great to deal with. Check out my feedback section.” 
You can even take it a step further by inviting prospective bidders to 
your About Me page (where you may also include a link to your personal 
Web site — if you have one). Chapter 14 gives you some tips on how to 
make your auction seen by a wider audience.
 
✓ Wish your potential bidders well: Communication is the key to a good 
transaction, and you can set the tone for your auction and post-auction 
exchanges by including some simple phrases that show your friendly 
side. Always end your description by wishing bidders good luck, inviting 
potential bidders to e-mail you with questions, and offering the option of 
providing additional photos of the item if you have them.
When you input your description, you have the option of jazzing things up 
with a bit of HTML coding, or you can use eBay’s HTML text editor, shown in 
Figure 10-5. If you know how to use a word processor, you’ll have no trouble 
touching up your text with this tool. Table 10-2 shows you a few additional 
codes to help you pretty things up.

You can go back and forth from the HTML text editor to regular input and add 
additional codes here and there by clicking from the Standard form to the 
HTML entry form tabs. I often prepare all my auctions ahead of time and save 
them in my computer as plain HTML files — that way they’re always retrievable 
for use (I just copy and paste) — no matter what program or form I’m using to 
list my auctions. See Chapter 20 for more on software to help you with your 
auctions.
 
To insert additional photos in your description (thereby avoiding eBay’s 
additional photo charges), use the following code. (Just insert the URL of your 
hosted picture, along with the photo file name). My example in Figure 10-5 
uses the following code:

202
Part III: Making Money the eBay Way 
Occasionally, sellers offer an item as a presell, or an item that the seller 
doesn’t yet have in stock but expects to. If you’re offering this kind of item, 
make sure that you spell out all the details in the description. eBay policy 
states that you must ship a presell item within 30 days of the auction’s 
end, so be sure you will have the item within that time span. Don’t forget 
to include the actual shipping date. I have found that putting an item up for 
sale without having it in hand is a practice fraught with risk. The item you’re 
expecting may not arrive in time or may arrive damaged. I’ve heard of one 
too many sellers who have had to go out and purchase an item at retail for a 
buyer to preserve their feedback when caught in this situation.
Listing the number of items for sale
Unless you’re planning on holding a Multiple Item listing or Dutch auction, 
the number of items is always 1, which means you’re holding a traditional 
auction or listing a single item up for sale. If you need to change the quantity 
number from 1, just type the number in the box.
 
A matching set of cuff links is considered one item, as is the complete 
37-volume set of The Smith Family Ancestry and Genealogical History since 
1270. If you have more than one of the same item (two sets of cuff links), I 
suggest that you sell them one at a time. You are much more likely to get 
higher final bids for your items when you sell them individually. Never try to 
sell items that belong in a set as separate items.
eBay won’t allow you to list the same item in more than 15 auctions at one time.
Setting a starting price — 
how low can you go?
What do a baseball autographed by JFK, a used walkie-talkie, and a Jaguar 
sports car all have in common? They all started with a $0.99 starting price. 
eBay requires you to set a starting price, also called a minimum bid — the 
lowest bid allowed in an auction. You may be surprised to see stuff worth 
tens of thousands of dollars starting at just a buck. These sellers haven’t lost 
their minds. Neither are they worried someone could be tooling down the 
highway in a $100,000 sports car they bought for the price of a burger.
 
Setting an incredibly low minimum (just type it in the box without the dollar 
sign but with the decimal point) is a subtle strategy that gives you more bang 
for your buck. You can use a low starting price to attract more bidders who 
will, in turn, drive up the price to the item’s real value — especially if, after 
doing your research, you know that the item is particularly hot.

203
 Chapter 10: Time to Sell: Completing the Cyber Paperwork
If you’re worried about the outcome of the final bid, you can protect your 
item by using a reserve price (the price the bidding needs to reach before 
the item can be sold). Then you won’t have to sell your item for a bargain-
basement price because your reserve price protects your investment. The 
best advice is to set a reserve price that is the lowest amount you’ll take for 
your item and then set a minimum bid that is ridiculously low. Use a reserve 
only when absolutely necessary because some bidders pass up reserve 
auctions. (For more info about setting a reserve price, see the section “Your 
secret safety net — reserve price,” later in this chapter.)
Starting with a low starting price is also good for your pocketbook. eBay 
charges the seller an insertion fee based on your opening bid. If you keep 
your opening bid low and set no reserve, you get to keep more of your 
money. (See Chapter 9 for more about eBay fees.)
The more bids you get, the more people who will want to bid on your item 
because they perceive the item as hot. A hot item with lots of bids draws 
even more bidders the way a magnet attracts paper clips.
 
Before you set any starting price, do your homework and make some savvy 
marketing decisions. If your auction isn’t going as you hoped, you could end 
up selling Grandma Ethel’s Ming vase for a dollar. Think about your strategy. 
See “Midcourse Corrections: Fixing Current Auctions” later in this chapter 
on how you can make changes in your listing if you’ve made some egregious 
error.
 
When entering a starting price, type only the numbers and a decimal point. 
Don’t use dollar signs ($) or cents signs (¢).
Buy It Now
eBay’s Buy It Now (BIN in eBay-speak) is available for single-item auctions. 
This feature allows buyers who want to purchase an item now to do so. Have 
you ever wanted an item really badly and didn’t want to wait until the end 
of an auction? If the seller offers Buy It Now, you can purchase that item 
immediately. If you’re the seller, you can entice your bidders to pay just a tad 
more to have the satisfaction of walking away with the item free and clear. 
Just specify the amount the item can sell for in the Buy It Now price area — 
the amount can be whatever you want. If you choose to take advantage of 
selling a hot item during the holiday rush, for example, you can make the BIN 
price as high as you think it can go. If you just want the item to move, make 
your BIN price the average price you see the item go for on eBay.
When your item receives a bid, the BIN option disappears, and the item goes 
through the normal auction process. If you have a reserve price on your item, 
the BIN feature doesn’t disappear until a bidder meets your reserve price 
through the normal bidding process. To list an item with Buy It Now, you 

204
Part III: Making Money the eBay Way 
must have a feedback of 10 or be ID Verified. (See Chapter 16 for more details 
on ID Verify.)
Setting your auction time
How long do you want to run your auction? eBay gives you a choice — 1, 3, 
5, 7, or 10 days. Just click the number you want in the box. If you choose a 
10-day auction, you add $0.40 to your listing fee.
 
My auction-length strategy depends on the time of year and the item I’m 
selling, and I generally have great success. If you have an item that you think 
will sell pretty well, run a 7-day auction (be sure it will cover a full weekend) 
so bidders have time to check it out before they decide to bid. However, if you 
know that you have a red-hot item that’s going to fly off the shelves — like a 
rare toy or a hard-to-get video game — choose a 3-day auction. Eager bidders 
tend to bid higher and more often to beat out their competition if the item is 
hot and going fast. Three days is long enough to give trendy items exposure 
and ring up bids.
 
No matter how many days you choose to run your auction, it ends at exactly 
the same time of day as it starts. A 7-day auction that starts on Thursday at 
9:03:02 a.m. ends the following Thursday at 9:03:02 a.m.
Although I know the gang at eBay is a pretty laid back group, they do run on 
military time. That means they use a 24-hour clock set to Pacific Time. So 3:30 
in the afternoon is 15:30, and one minute after midnight is 00:01. Questions 
about time conversions? Check out www.timezoneconverter.com or look 
at the table on my Web site in the Tools area, which has a printable conversion 
chart of eBay times (www.coolebaytools.com). (And so you don’t have to 
keep flipping back to this page, I also include these handy-dandy links on the 
Cheat Sheet at the front of this book.)
With auctions running 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, you should know when 
the most bidders are around to take a gander at your wares. Here are some 
times to think about:
 
✓ Saturday/Sunday: Always run an auction over a weekend. People log on 
and off eBay all day.
 
 Don’t start or end your auction on a Saturday or Sunday — unless your 
completed auction research indicates that you should. Certain types of 
bidders love sitting at their computers waiting for auctions to end on the 
weekends, but many bidders are busy having lives, and their schedules 
are unpredictable. Although a few eager bidders may log on and place a 
maximum bid on your auction, you can bet that they won’t be sitting at 
a computer making a last-minute flurry of competitive bids if they have 
something better to do on a Saturday or Sunday.

205
 Chapter 10: Time to Sell: Completing the Cyber Paperwork
 
✓ Holiday weekends: If a holiday weekend is coming up around the time 
you’re setting up your auction, run your auction through the weekend 
and end it a day after the “holiday” Monday. This gives prospective 
bidders a chance to catch up with the items they perused over the 
weekend and to plan their bidding strategies.
 
 Don’t end an auction on the last day of a three-day holiday. People in the 
mood to shop are generally at department stores collecting bargains. If 
eBay members aren’t shopping, they’re out enjoying an extra day off.
 
✓ Time of day: The best times of day to start and end your auction are 
during eBay’s peak hours of operation, which are 5:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. 
Pacific Time, right after work on the West Coast. Perform your completed 
auction research, however, to be sure that this strategy applies to your 
item. Your timing depends on the item you’re listing and whether 5:00 
p.m. to 9:00 p.m. Pacific Time is the middle of the night where you live.
 
Unless you’re an insomniac or a vampire and want to sell to werewolves, don’t 
let your auctions close in the middle of the night. Not enough bidders are 
around to cause any last-minute bidding that would bump up the price.
Your secret safety net — reserve price
Here’s a little secret: The reason sellers list big-ticket items like Ferraris, 
grand pianos, and high-tech computer equipment with a starting bid of $1.00 
is because they’re protected from losing money with a reserve price. The 
reserve price is the lowest price that must be met before the item can be 
sold. It’s not required by eBay but can protect you. eBay charges an additional 
fee for this feature that varies, depending on how high your reserve is.
For example, say you list a first edition book of John Steinbeck’s The Grapes 
of Wrath. You set the starting price at $1.00, and you set a reserve price at 
$80.00. That means that people can start bidding at $1.00, and if at the end of 
the auction the bidding hasn’t reached the $80.00 reserve, you don’t have to 
sell the book.
As with everything in life, using a reserve price for your auctions has an 
upside and a downside. Many choosy bidders and bargain hunters blast 
past reserve-price auctions because they see a reserve price as a sign that 
proclaims “No bargains here!” Many bidders figure they can get a better deal 
on the same item with an auction that proudly declares NR (for no reserve) in 
its description. As an enticement to those bidders, you see lots of NR listings 
in auction titles.

206
Part III: Making Money the eBay Way 
 
If you need to set a reserve on your item, help the bidder out. Many bidders 
shy away from an auction that has a reserve, but if they’re really interested, 
they will read the item description. To dispel their fears that the item is way 
too expensive or out of their price range, add a line in your description that 
states the amount of your reserve price. “I have put a reserve of $75.00 on this 
item to protect my investment; the highest bid over $75.00 will win the item.” 
A phrase such as this takes away the vagueness of the reserve auction and 
allows you to place a reserve with a low opening bid. (You want to reel ’em in, 
remember?)
 
On lower-priced items, I suggest that you set a higher starting price and set no 
reserve. Otherwise, if you’re not sure about the market, set a low minimum 
bid but set a high reserve to protect yourself.
If bids don’t reach a set reserve price, some sellers e-mail the highest bidder 
and offer the item at what the seller thinks is a fair price. Sending a Second 
Chance offer through the eBay system makes much more sense. Two caveats 
if you try to circumvent eBay fees and contact the bidders:
 
✓ eBay can suspend the seller and the buyer if the side deal is reported to 
Trust & Safety. This activity is strictly prohibited.
 
✓ eBay won’t protect buyers or sellers if a side deal goes bad.
I want to be alone: the private auction
In a private auction, bidders’ user IDs are kept under wraps. Sellers typically 
use this option to protect the identities of bidders during auctions for 
high-priced big-ticket items (say, that restored World War II fighter). Wealthy 
eBay users may not want the world to know that they have the resources to 
buy expensive items. Private auctions are also held for items from the Adult/
Erotica category. (Gee, there’s a shocker.)
 
The famous sign that was pictured in almost every Disneyland promotion (for 
the first 40 or so years of Disneyland’s existence) was put up for sale on eBay 
in 2000. Legend has it that the sign was purchased by actor John Stamos for a 
high bid of $30,700. Unfortunately for John, the Disney auction did not use the 
private auction feature. After news of the winner’s name hit the tabloids, the 
entire world knew John’s eBay user ID! He had to change his ID in a hurry to 
end the throngs of lovey-dovey e-mail headed to his computer!
 
In private auctions, the seller’s e-mail address is accessible to bidders in case 
questions arise. Bidders’ e-mail addresses remain unseen.

207
 Chapter 10: Time to Sell: Completing the Cyber Paperwork
Put me in the Gallery
The Gallery is a legacy term that refers to the single picture you post to 
accompany your listing. It also causes a postage-stamp-size version of your 
image to appear next to your listing in the category or search. Many buyers 
enjoy browsing the Gallery catalog-style, and it’s open to all categories. (I 
explain how to post your pictures in Chapter 14.)
The best things about using a Gallery picture in your listings are that it’s free 
and it increases the space your listing takes up on a search or category page. 
If you don’t use a Gallery picture and just have an image in your description, 
your listing will get very few hits.
Filling out the item location
eBay wants you to list the general area and country where you live. The idea 
behind telling the bidder where you live is to give him or her a heads-up on 
what kind of shipping charges to expect. Don’t be esoteric (listing where you 
live as The Here and Now isn’t a whole lot of help) but don’t go crazy with 
cross-streets, landmarks, or degrees of latitude. Listing your city and state is 
enough.
 
If you live in a big area — say, suburban Los Angeles (who, me?), which 
sprawls for miles — you may want to think about narrowing your region a 
little. You may find a bidder who lives close to you, which could swing your 
auction. If you do a face-to-face transaction, doing it in a public place is a good 
idea. (I picked up an eBay purchase at Starbucks recently.)
A picture is worth a thousand words
Clichés again? Perhaps. But an item on eBay without a picture is almost a 
waste of time. If you haven’t set up photo hosting elsewhere, you can list one 
picture with eBay’s Pictures Service for free. Additional ones cost you $0.15 
each. Alternatively, you can put all the pictures you want in your auction 
description for free. See Chapter 14 for the necessary coding and instructions.

208
Part III: Making Money the eBay Way 
Listing Designer
How many times have you seen an item on eBay laid out on the page all 
pretty-like with a fancy border around the description? If that sort of thing 
appeals to you, eBay’s Listing Designer will supply you with pretty borders 
for almost any type of item for $0.10. Selecting your design is as easy as 
clicking the menu (see Figure 10-6). You can designate where you’d like to 
place your image on the page relative to the description (left, right, top, or 
bottom).
 
Figure 10-6: 
Selecting 
a graphic 
in Listing 
Designer is 
as simple 
as clicking 
your mouse.
 
Will the pretty borders increase the amount of bids your auction will get? It’s 
doubtful. A clean item description with a few good clear pictures of your item 
is really all you need.
There’s a special combination deal called the Value Pack. For $0.65, you can 
place a subtitle on your listing, add a Gallery Plus picture, and doll things up 
with Listing Designer. All those features would normally cost $0.95, so the 
savings is clear if you run several listings a week.
 
If you don’t want to use the Listing Designer graphics to distract from your 
item, you can still get a discount. Just select the Listing Designer check box, 
but don’t choose a graphic pattern. You’ll still save $0.30 over the price of a 
subtitle and Gallery (sneaky, huh?).
Listing the payment methods you’ll accept
Yeah, sure, eBay is loads of fun, but the bottom line to selling is the phrase 
“Show me the money!” eBay allows the following payment options: PayPal, 
credit or debit card processed through an Internet merchant account, 
ProPay, Moneybookers, and or Paymate. You make the call on what you’re 
willing to take as money from the buyer of your item.

209
 Chapter 10: Time to Sell: Completing the Cyber Paperwork
 
So as not to confuse you here — just accept PayPal! As a new seller you have 
enough on your plate without worrying about several payment options. By the 
way, this advice isn’t just for beginners — I accept only PayPal in my listings.
In some cases, you may still accept checks and money orders in certain 
categories. Since these categories can change per eBay’s policy, I suggest you 
check http://pages.ebay.com/help/policies/accepted-payments-
policy.html to see if your category is listed.
eBay’s rules say that you must clearly state the payment methods you accept 
and can’t make generalized statements or ask buyers to contact you for 
additional payment methods.
 
Some sellers who use credit card services try attaching an additional fee (to 
cover their credit card processing fees) to the final payment. However, that’s 
against the law in California, home of eBay, and therefore against eBay’s rules. 
So forget about it. eBay can end your 
auction if it catches you.
Setting shipping terms
Ahoy, matey! Hoist the bid! Okay, not quite. Before you run it up the mast, 
select your shipping options. Here are your choices:
 
✓ Ship to the United States only: This option is selected by default; it 
means you ship only domestically.
 
✓ Will ship worldwide: The world is your oyster. But make sure that you 
can afford the time for the extra processing of customs forms.
 
✓ Will ship to United States and the following: If you’re comfortable 
shipping to certain countries but not to others, make your selections 
here; they show up on your auction page.
 
When you indicate that you will ship internationally, your auction shows up 
on the international eBay sites, which is a fantastic way to attract new buyers! 
eBay has lots of good international users, so you may want to consider selling 
your items around the world. If you do, be sure to clearly state in the description 
all extra shipping costs and customs charges. (See Chapter 12 for more 
information on how to ship to customers abroad.)
Traditionally, the buyer pays for shipping, and this is the point at which you 
must decide how much to charge. You also have to calculate how much this 
item will cost you to ship. If it’s a small item (weighing under a pound or so), 
you may decide to charge a flat rate to all buyers. To charge a flat rate, click 
the Flat Shipping Rates tab and fill in the shipping amount. Before you fill in 

210
Part III: Making Money the eBay Way 
the amount, be sure to include your costs for packing (see Chapter 12 for 
more info on how much to add for this task) and how much the insurance 
charges will be.
 
If your item weighs 2 pounds or more, you may want to use eBay’s versatile 
shipping calculator. Because UPS and the U.S. Postal Service now charge 
variable rates for packages of the same weight, based on distance, using the 
calculator simplifies things for your customers (and you). Be sure you’ve 
weighed the item and know how much your handling charge will be. The 
calculator allows you to input a handling amount and adds it to the overall 
shipping total but does not break out the amount separately for the customer. 
The calculator also conveniently calculates the proper insurance amount for 
the item. Figure 10-7 shows how simple the form is.

shipping 
amount is

The calculator automatically appears on the item page so that prospective 
buyers can type in their zip code and immediately know how much shipping 
will be to their location. Check out Chapter 12 for more information on shipping 
options.
eBay Options: Getting Eyes on Your Item
Although eBay’s display options aren’t quite as effective as a three-story 
neon sign in Times Square, they do bring greater attention to your auction. 
Here are your options:

211
 Chapter 10: Time to Sell: Completing the Cyber Paperwork
 
✓ Bold: The eBay fee is $2.00 ($4.00 for a 30-day listing). Bold type does 
catch your attention but don’t bother using it on items that’ll bring in 
less than $25.00. Do use it if you’re in hot competition with similar items 
and you want yours to stand out.
 
✓ Highlight: The eBay fee is $5.00 ($10.00 for a 30-day listing). Yellow 
highlighter is what I use to point out the high points in books I read. 
(You’re using one now, aren’t you?) The eBay highlight feature is lilac, 
but it can really make your item shine. Check out the category in which 
you choose to list before selecting this feature. Some categories are 
overwhelmed with sellers using the highlight option, and the pages look 
completely shaded in lilac. In these categories, not using highlight (and 
using perhaps a bold title instead) makes your auction stand out more.
 
✓ Home Page Featured: The eBay fee is $59.95 ($179.95 for a 30-day 
listing). As with expensive real estate, you pay a premium for location, 
location, location. The $59.95 gives you the highest level of visibility on 
eBay, and it occasionally appears smack dab in the middle of the eBay 
home page (although there’s no guarantee that it will). Figure 10-8 shows 
the featured listings on eBay’s home page.

If you’re 
lucky, your 
Home Page 
Featured 
listing will

home page

 Buyers do browse the Featured Items to see what’s there, just as you 
might head directly to the New Releases section of your video store. But, 
because the vast majority of items found on eBay are under $25.00, the 
average seller doesn’t use the Featured Items option.
 
✓ Featured Plus! The eBay fee is from $9.95 to $19.95 based on your starting 
price. You want top billing? You can buy it here. This option puts you 
on the first page of your item category and search results pages. This is 
a good option for moving special merchandise. Often, bidders just scan 
the top items; if you want to be seen, you gotta be there. Ask yourself 
this: Is it worth $20.00 to have more people see my item? If yes, go for it. 
Figure 10-9 shows how items are listed in the Featured Plus! listings.

212

 You need a feedback rating of at least 10 to make it to the Featured Items 
and Featured Plus! listings.

Checking Your Work and 
Starting the Auction
After you’ve filled in all the blanks on the Sell an Item form, you come to the 
Preview Your Listing page. Scroll down the page and confirm that all the 
information appears as you intended. If you think you’re ready to join the 
world of e-commerce, follow these steps:
 
1. Under the heading titled How Your Listing Will Appear in Search 
Results, click the Preview Your Listing link.
 
 A pop-up page opens showing you exactly how your listing will appear 
on eBay (see Figure 10-10). This is the place where you can catch mistakes 
before your item is listed. The bottom of the sell page shows you a 
condensed version of all your information and tallies how much eBay is 
charging you in fees and options to run this listing.
 
 You also may find the preview page helpful as a last-minute chance to 
get your bearings. You can go back to any of the areas that need 
correcting by clicking the Edit Listings links on the Preview Your Listing 
page. Make category changes or any other changes and additions, and 
then head for the Verification page again.

2. Check for mistakes.
 
 Nit-pick for common, careless errors; you won’t be sorry. I’ve seen eBay 
members make goofs such as the wrong category listing, spelling and 
grammatical errors, and missing information about shipping, handling, 
insurance, and payment methods.
 
3. When you’re sure everything’s accurate and you’re happy with your 
item listing, click the Submit button.
 
 A Confirmation page pops up. At that precise moment, your listing 
begins, even though it may be a few hours before it appears in eBay’s 
search and listings updates. If you want to see your listing right away 
and check for bids, your Confirmation page provides a link for that 
purpose. Click the link, and you’re there. You can also keep track of your 
auctions by using the My eBay page. (To find out how, see Chapter 4.)
 
All item pages come with this friendly warning: Seller assumes all responsibility 
for listing this item. You should contact the seller to resolve any questions before 
bidding. Some eBay veterans just gloss over this warning after they’ve been 
wheeling and dealing for a while, but it’s an important rule to remember. See 
Chapter 9 for details on the rules sellers must follow and Chapter 12 for tips 
on your role in closing the deal and receiving good feedback.
 
For the first 24 hours after your sale is underway, eBay stamps the Item page 
with a funky sunrise icon next to the listing. This is just a little reminder for 
buyers to come take a look at the latest items up for sale.

214
Part III: Making Money the eBay Way 
Midcourse Corrections: Fixing 
Current Listings
Don’t worry if you make a mistake filling out the Sell an Item page but don’t 
notice it until after the auction is up and running. Pencils have erasers, and 
eBay allows revisions. You can make changes at two stages of the game: 
before the first bid is placed and after the bidding war is underway. The 
following sections explain what you can and can’t correct — and when you 
have to accept the little imperfections of your Item page.
Making changes before bidding begins
Here’s what you can change about your listing before bids have been placed 
(and when it does not end within 12 hours):
 
✓ The title or description of your auction
 
✓ The item category
 
✓ The item’s starting price
 
✓ The item’s Buy It Now price
 
✓ The reserve price (you can add, change, or remove it)
 
✓ The duration of your listing
 
✓ The URL of the picture you’re including with your auction
 
✓ A private listing designation (you can add or remove it)
 
✓ Accepted payment methods, checkout information, item location, and 
shipping terms
When you revise a listing, eBay puts a little notation on your auction page 
that reads: Description(revised). (Think of it as automatic common 
courtesy.)
To revise a fixed-price listing or any auction before bids have been received, 
follow these steps:
 
1. Go to your My eBay page and find the item you want to revise. Click 
the Revise link from the drop-down menu on the right side of the 
item.
 
 If the item hasn’t received any bids, a message appears on your screen 
to indicate that you may update the item.

215
 Chapter 10: Time to Sell: Completing the Cyber Paperwork
 
2. You arrive at the Revise Item page, which looks like the Sell an Item 
form.
 
3. Make changes to the item information and then click the Save and 
Continue button at the bottom of the page when you’re finished.
 
 A summary of your newly revised auction page appears on your screen.
 
4. If you’re happy with your revisions, click Save Changes.
 
 You’re taken to your newly revised item page, where you see a disclaimer 
from eBay that says you’ve revised the listing before the first bid. If you 
instead want to make further revisions, click the Back button of your 
browser and redo the Edit Your Listing page.
Making changes after bidding begins
If your listing is up and running and already receiving bids, you can still make 
some slight modifications to it. Newly added information is clearly separated 
from the original text and pictures. In addition, eBay puts a time stamp on the 
additional info in case questions from early bidders crop up later.
After your item receives bids, eBay allows you to add to your item’s 
description. If you feel you were at a loss for words in writing your item’s 
description, if you discover new information (that vase you thought was a 
reproduction is actually the real thing!), or if a lot of potential bidders are 
asking the same questions, go ahead and make all the additions you want. 
But whatever you put there the first time around stays in the description as 
well.
 
Don’t let an oversight grow into a failure to communicate and don’t ignore 
iffy communication until the auction is over. Correct any inaccuracies in your 
auction information now to avoid problems later.
Always check your e-mail to see whether bidders have questions about your 
item. If a bidder wants to know about flaws, be truthful and courteous when 
returning e-mails. As you get more familiar with eBay (and with writing 
auction descriptions), the number of e-mail questions will decrease. If you 
enjoy good customer service in your day-to-day shopping, here’s your 
chance to give some back.

Chapter 11

to an eBay Store
In This Chapter
▶ Shopping eBay Stores
▶ Opening your own eBay store
▶ Searching eBay Stores
S
ometimes you just don’t want to participate in an auction. Sometimes 
you want to buy your item now. The easiest place to go for this type of 
transaction is to purchase an item from a fixed-price listing or from an eBay 
store, where you find ready-to-buy items. Visiting the stores can save you 
money because buying multiple items from one seller allows several items to 
be shipped in a single box. Even if the items have to be shipped separately, 
many sellers will discount shipping costs on multiple purchases.
Much of the fine merchandise that you can find on eBay can be found also in 
the eBay Stores area. Regular eBay sellers run these stores, which are located 
in a separate area from the regular auctions. eBay Stores is a place where 
sellers can list as many additional items for sale as they’d like for a reduced 
insertion fee. Buyers are lured to the store by the small red eBay Stores icon 
that appears next to the seller’s user ID.
 
Whenever you’re looking at an auction and you see that the seller has a store, 
be sure to click the Stores icon. The seller may have the same (or similar) 
merchandise in his or her eBay store for a lower buy price.
If sellers have an eBay store, they can list individual items for different sizes 
of an article of clothing, different variations of items that they sell in regular 
auctions, or anything that falls within eBay’s listing policies. The store items 
have a listing time of at least 30 days, so sellers can also put up specialty 
items that may not sell well in a short auction term of only one to ten days.

218
Part III: Making Money the eBay Way 
The requirements to open an eBay store are basic. However, I highly 
recommend that you transact business (sell) on the site for quite a while 
before you open a store because you need a solid understanding of how 
eBay works and how to handle all types of transactions. These are eBay’s 
requirements:
 
✓ You must be registered as an eBay seller, with a credit card on file.
 
✓ You must have a feedback rating of 20 or more (or be ID Verified).
 
✓ You must accept credit card payments, either through PayPal or 
through a merchant account.
 
The eBay search engine does not directly search the eBay Stores area. If you 
perform a search on eBay, be sure to scroll to the bottom of the page to see 
whether the particular item is available in an eBay store. Store inventory 
listings appear in the search results when there are 30 or fewer listings for the 
item on the core eBay site.
To get to the eBay Stores main area, visit the eBay home page and click the 
Stores link, which is below the search box on the upper portion of the page 
(see Figure 11-1). Alternatively, you can type www.ebaystores.com in the 
address box of your Web browser.

Unlimited Shopping from the Stores Page
Okay, you’ve arrived! You’ve come to the hub of power shopping online, the 
eBay Stores home page (see Figure 11-2). Just like the eBay home page, this is 
your gateway to many incredible bargains. In this section, you find out what 
you can expect to find in eBay’s stores, how to navigate the stores, and how 
to find the deals.
 
Figure 11-2: 
The eBay 
Stores 
home page, 
where you 
can search 
stores by 
item or store 
name.
 
Conducting an eBay Stores search
On the top-left of the eBay Stores home page is the search engine for eBay 
Stores. The store search link is available also by clicking the Buy button in 
the navigation bar. (There’s a search box on the resulting page; just below it 
is an eBay Stores Search link.) You can perform your search in eBay stores 
on different levels. You can search for Buy It Now items — seems a tad too 
obvious for me, isn’t that why we’re here? Anyway, if you type your keyword 
in the box and stay with the default search, you can find every piece of the 
fixed-price inventory in the stores that matches your keyword.

220
Part III: Making Money the eBay Way 
 
eBay Stores don’t just list fixed-price items. If sellers have current auctions on 
eBay, those auctions are listed in their stores as well — only regular auctions 
won’t come up in an eBay Stores item search. So if you find an auction that 
interests you on eBay, click the item to read the description and the condition 
of the item. If you want to buy the item, click the Visit My eBay Store link next 
to the store name on the top of the item page and you go to the seller’s eBay 
store. You just may find some related items that you want. And the seller 
probably combines shipping so that you save some money!
If you remember a particular seller’s store name (or part of it), you can 
also search eBay Stores by store name. All you have to do is type the store 
name (or part of the store name) in the Search Stores box and click the 
Search Store Name and Description button to produce the results shown in 
Figure 11-3.
 
Figure 11-3: 
Results for 
finding a 
store by 
name.
 
If you can’t remember the store name but can remember what it sells, type 
the keywords in the search box while selecting the Stores with Matching 
Items option. For example, you can search for terrier t-shirts. If the seller has 
used those words in his or her store description or title, it shows up in the 
search results listing. In Figure 11-4, I typed the name of one of my books and 
was transported to my own store.
Browsing the store categories
Browsing store categories is a great idea when you’re looking for a specialist — 
you know, someone who carries a particular type of item that appeals to 
you. Perhaps you have an affinity for jewelry, art, limited edition books, or 
needlepoint. Whatever your interest, you’ll probably find a store here to suit 
your needs.

221
 Chapter 11: Save Gas — Drive Your Mouse to an eBay Store 
 
Figure 11-4: 
Search 
results for 
Stores with 
Matching 
Items in the 
store.
 
To browse eBay Stores, just click Buy in the navigation bar on any eBay page. 
Near the very bottom of the page on the bottom link area, click the Browse 
Stores link, and you travel to the eBay Stores hub. Look for a list of categories 
on the left side of page; click a category that suits your fancy. When you 
do that, the left side of the page (surprise!) lists subcategories within that 
category. I clicked the category Coins and then the subcategory U.S. Coins, 
and got the subcategory hub page.
Browsing eBay Stores categories is like strolling down a mall filled with your 
favorite items. Note that stores with the highest inventories in the category 
are listed toward the top.
 
Just like in the brick-and-mortar world, more “general” stores on eBay carry a 
wide breadth of merchandise. By browsing individual categories, you may be 
missing them. Try visiting the Everything Else category, and you’ll find, well, 
everything else.
Selling from Your Own Virtual Storefront
After you’ve shopped the eBay Stores, you may be thinking that this is a good 
place to open your own store. There’s great news on that end because eBay 
Stores have the most reasonable rent on the Internet. At an eBay Store, you 
are not constrained by the auction format of a 1-to-10-day maximum. You can 
list your fixed-price items in your eBay store on a “good till cancelled” basis.

222
Part III: Making Money the eBay Way 
I don’t like to pull punches with my readers, so let me give you a bit of 
advice. Opening an eBay store without a large stock of items, or many items 
that you stock in multiples, makes no sense. Opening an eBay store is really 
for experienced sellers — those who make a business on the eBay site selling 
merchandise they’ve bought for the purpose of reselling. Retailers who 
come to the eBay site to expand their business can be successful with the 
stores, but certainly it helps to know the e-commerce ropes already. (You 
can always read my eBay Business All-In-One Reference, 2nd edition (Wiley) to 
catch up on all you need to know).
 
Too many readers new to eBay e-mail me after reading this book and tell me 
that they opened a store and have had no sales. You must list a bunch of 
items on eBay in the auction format (or fixed price) to draw people to your 
store — simple as that.
Paying the landlord
The rent for an eBay store is as low as $15.95 per month. Featured stores 
have a rent of $49.95, and anchor stores (just like your local department 
store) pay $299.95 a month. Featured stores’ listings are guaranteed to rotate 
through the special featured section on the eBay Stores home page. These 
listings also appear on the top level of their category directory page. Anchor 
stores get extra promotion, and their logos are showcased in the stores’ 
directory pages. There are also other benefits to owning a store: cost-per-
click advertising, sales management tools, and lots of promotional benefits 
for your merchandise.
The reasonable pricing behind eBay Stores is a remarkable bargain. For as 
little as $15.95 a month, you have the opportunity to sell your merchandise to 
over 140 million registered users! See Table 11-1 for eBay Store listing fees.
Table 11-1 
eBay Store Listing Fees
Starting Price
Listing Fee
$0.01–$24.99
$0.03 per 30 days
$25.00 – $199.99
$0.05 per 30 days
$200.00 and higher
$0.10 per/ 30 days
Listing fees and monthly rent can be just the tip of the iceberg if you choose 
to get fancy by using all kinds of options. My recommendation? Don’t spend 
too much on them until you’re fully entrenched in an eBay business — by 
that time, you’ll have the experience to know what to add and when. Stick 
with the basics.

223
 Chapter 11: Save Gas — Drive Your Mouse to an eBay Store

different in stores than on the regular eBay site. Check them out in Table 11-2.

Opening your eBay store
Because this book is your introduction to eBay, I’ll just give you some ideas 
about opening an eBay store. In my more advanced book, Starting an eBay 
Business For Dummies (Wiley), I take you step-by-step through the basics of 
opening your store.
Naming your store is your first challenge. Choose a name that describes the 
type of items your store will carry or one that includes your user ID. Don’t 
choose a name that is so esoteric or overly creative that it doesn’t give 
possible shoppers a clue as to what you carry. A creative store name and 
logo are pictured in Figure 11-5.
As you can see from my store page, each store can have its own categories. 
You get to make them up yourself so your customers can find items within 
your store in an organized manner. You can define up to 300 custom 
categories up to three levels deep. Each category can have a maximum of 29 
characters for each name in your store.
Your eBay store home page has links for your Store Information: Store 
Policies and About the Seller page. The About the Store Page is the same as 
your About Me page (which I discuss in Chapter 14).
Spend some serious time on eBay before you open a store. Study some of the 
successful stores. You need to have enough know-how to make your store a 
success!

Chapter 12
Closing the Deal and 
Shipping It Out
In This Chapter
▶ Staying organized
▶ Communicating with the buyer
▶ Packing and sending the item
▶ Purchasing stamps and services online
T
he auction’s over and you have a winning buyer, who (you hope) is eager 
to send you money. Sounds perfect, doesn’t it? It is if you watch your 
step, keep on top of things, and communicate like a professional.
In this chapter, I help you figure out how to stay organized by showing you 
what documents you need to keep and for how long. I also include tips and 
etiquette on communicating with the buyer so that you’re most likely to 
come out with positive feedback. In addition, you find out how to pack your 
item, assess costs, and make sure the item reaches the buyer when you say it 
will (oh, yeah . . . and in one piece).
Bookkeeping and Staying Organized
Although I don’t recommend lining your nest with every scrap from every 
auction you run, you can safely keep some documents without mutating into 
a giant pack rat. Until you become an eBay expert and are comfortable with 
other ways to electronically store your information, you should print and file 
these essentials:
 
✓ The listing page as it appeared before the auction closed: This page 
gives you a record of the item name and number and a lot of other useful 
information. The page also includes the auction item description (and 
any revisions you’ve made to it), which is handy if the buyer argues that 
an item’s disintegrating before his eyes and you honestly described it as 
just well loved.

226
Part III: Making Money the eBay Way 
 
 Do not use the Print feature on the item page because it will not include 
all of the seller’s description. Print the page directly from your browser.
 
 You may think you don’t need this information because you can always 
look it up, but here practicality rears its head: eBay makes completed 
listings disappear after 30 days. However, if you use the custom link 
that appears in your End of Auction e-mail (see the next bullet), you 
can access the auction online for up to 90 days. Print your auction page 
before you forget about it, file it where you know you can find it, and 
then forget about it.
 
✓ The End of Listing e-mail you receive from eBay that notifies you that 
the auction is over: If you lose this e-mail, you can’t get it back because 
eBay doesn’t keep it.
 
 I set up a separate folder in my Microsoft Outlook e-mail program for 
my sold item e-mails. When one comes in, I read it and then drag it over 
to its special folder. That way, I can always check this folder for the 
information I need.
 
✓ E-mail between you and the buyer: In the virtual world, e-mail is as 
close to having a face-to-face conversation as most people get. Your 
e-mail correspondence is a living record of all the things you discuss 
with the buyer to complete the transaction. Even if you sell just a few 
items a month on eBay, keep track of who’s paid up and who owes you 
money. And more importantly, if the buyer says, “I told you I’d be out of 
town,” you can look through your e-mail and say, “Nope, it doesn’t show 
up here,” or “You’re right! How was Tierra del Fuego? Is the payment on 
the way?” Or something more polite. Be sure to keep that e-mail with the 
headers and date on it so that you can’t be accused of (ahem) creative 
writing.
 
✓ PayPal payment notices: You get a notice from PayPal when the buyer 
pays for the item. The notice has the listing information and the buyer’s 
shipping information. (When that e-mail arrives, the clock begins to tick 
on sending out the item.)
 
✓ Any bank statements you receive that reflect a payment that doesn’t 
clear: Keep anything related to payments, especially payments that 
didn’t go through. That way, if a buyer says he’s sure he sent you a 
check, you can say, “Yes sir, Mr. X, you did send me a check, and it was 
made of the finest rubber.” Or something kinder, especially if you want 
that payment.
 
✓ Any insurance forms: Until the item has arrived and you’re sure the 
customer is satisfied, be sure to keep those shipping and insurance 
receipts.
 
✓ Refund requests you make: If you make a request to eBay for a refund 
from a sale that doesn’t go through, hold on to it until you can view the 
credit on your statement.

227
 Chapter 12: Closing the Deal and Shipping It Out 
 
✓ Receipts for items that you buy for the sole purpose of selling on eBay: 
This comes in handy as a reference so that you can see if you’re making 
a profit. It can also be helpful at tax time.
 
Someday, the Internal Revenue Service (or the government agency in your 
area) may knock on your door. Scary, but true. Like hurricanes and asteroid 
strikes, audits happen. Any accountant worth his or her salt will tell you that 
the best way to handle the possibility of an audit is to be prepared for the 
worst — even if every eBay transaction you conduct runs smooth as silk and 
you’ve kept your nose sparkling clean. See Chapter 9 for more tax information.
 
If you accept online payments by PayPal (PayPal Premier or Business members 
only), you can download your transaction history for use in QuickBooks, 
Quicken, or Excel. Additionally, these programs are excellent sources for your 
documentation.
 
When you’re starting your career as a seller, once a month conduct a By Seller 
search on yourself so that you can print all the information on the bid histo-
ries of your most recent auctions. Do this independently of any auction soft-
ware you use. Having the listings neatly printed easily helps you see what sold 
for how much and when. Chapter 5 gives you the lowdown on how to perform 
this search.
When it comes to printouts of e-mails and documents about transactions, 
you can dump them as soon as the item arrives at the destination and you 
get your positive feedback. If you get negative feedback, hang on to your 
documentation a little longer (say, until you’re sure the issues it raises are 
resolved and everyone’s satisfied). If selling on eBay becomes a fairly regular 
source of income, save all receipts for items you’ve purchased to sell; for tax 
purposes, that’s inventory.
Tales from the formerly Type A
Confession time. When I first started buying 
and selling, I used to keep all my paperwork — 
listings, e-mails, the works. Now I keep the 
e-mails and receipts sent to me until I know a 
transaction is complete. Then they go wafting 
off to the Recycle Bin so that I can still find a file 
in my Outlook program.
These days, I stay on top of my eBay finances 
with online auction-management that helps me 
keep track of who has paid me and who hasn’t. 
These programs also help me figure out my 
expenses, profit, and other financial calcula-
tions, almost painlessly. (See Chapter 20 for 
more information on these programs.) They can 
also help spiff up the look of my auctions. Ain’t 
technology grand?

If you sell specialized items, you can keep track of trends and who your 
frequent buyers are by saving your paperwork. This prudent habit becomes 
an excellent marketing strategy when you discover that a segment of eBay 
users faithfully buys your items. An audience. Imagine that.
Talking to Buyers: The ABCs 
of Good Communication
You’ve heard it countless times — talk is cheap. Compared to what? Granted, 
empty promises are a dime a dozen, but honest-to-goodness talk and efficient 
e-mail are worth their weight in gold and good feedback — especially on 
eBay. Sometimes, not talking is costly.
A smooth exchange of money and merchandise starts with you (the seller) 
and your attitude toward the transaction. Your listing description and then 
your first e-mail — soon after the sale is made — set the entire transaction in 
motion and the tone for that transaction. If all goes well, no more than a day 
should elapse between getting paid and sending the item.
I suggest contacting the buyer and sending an invoice even before you get 
eBay’s e-mail. Here’s how:
 
1. Start at your My eBay Summary, Sell: Sold.
 
 Locate your newly sold item. Hint: It should be at the top of the listings.
 
2. Click the down arrow at the end of the listing’s line and select Send 
Invoice.
 
 You are presented with a page that summarizes the transaction with a 
“working version” of the invoice.
 
3. Examine the invoice displayed on this page. Make any changes if 
necessary.
 
 If the buyer has purchased more than one item from you, click the link 
to combine purchases.
 
4. Double-check that the shipping amount is correct. When you’re 
satisfied, click the Send Invoice button.
 
 If you select the Copy Me check box on this invoice, you’ll receive a 
copy of the invoice. The buyer’s copy has a link in the invoice, enabling 
the buyer to pay directly to PayPal (if you accept PayPal for payment).

 Signing in first puts a temporary cookie (a computer file that makes it 
easier to get around a Web site) in your computer so you don’t have to 
go through this process again. Be sure to select the Keep Me Signed In 
on This Computer for One Day check box when you sign in to eBay; your 
password is saved even if you cut off your Internet connection. Your 
login is saved until you click the Sign Out link. For more yummy info on 
cookies, see Chapter 15.
 
Another way to contact your buyer is to go to your My eBay page, scroll down 
to the Items I’ve Sold area, find the auction, and click the drop-down menu in 
the Action column. From there, click the Contact Buyer link.
Thank you — I mean it
What do all the successful big-name department stores have in common? 
Yes, great prices, good merchandise, and nice displays. But with all things 
being equal, customer service always wins hands-down. One department 
store in the United States, Nordstrom, has such a great reputation that the 
store happily took back a set of snow tires because a customer wasn’t happy 
with them. No big deal, maybe — until you notice that Nordstrom doesn’t 
even sell snow tires!
A friend of mine who owns restaurants calls this level of customer satisfaction 
the Wow! factor. If customers (no matter what they’re buying) say, “Wow!” 
during or after the transaction — admiringly or happily — you’ve satisfied 
the customer. A good rule to go by: Give people the same level of service you 
expect when you’re on the buying end. The best eBay sellers are regular eBay 
buyers.
 
The best way to start satisfying the buyer is with an introductory e-mail. 
Congratulate the person on winning the item — making him or her feel good 
about the purchase — and thank the buyer for bidding on your item. A 
good e-mail provides these important details:
 
✓ Item name and item number.
 
✓ Winning bid amount.
 
✓ Cost of shipping and packing, and any shipping or insurance restrictions. 
(I give pointers on determining shipping and packaging costs later in 
this chapter.)
 
✓ Payment options.
 
✓ The shipping timetable.

230
Part III: Making Money the eBay Way 
You should also include a few vital details in the first e-mail:
 
✓ Include your name and the address to which you want the payment sent 
should you have arranged for a form of payment other than PayPal.
 
✓ Remind buyers to write the item name, item number, and shipping 
address on whatever form of payment they send. You’d be surprised 
how many buyers forget to give you the item number. Also ask buyers to 
print and send a copy of your e-mail with the payment.
 
✓ If you’re using an online payment service, such as PayPal, be sure to give 
buyers instructions on how they can pay for the auction online.
 
✓ Include your “customer service” phone number if you want.
 
✓ Suggest that if all goes well, you’ll be happy to leave positive feedback 
for the buyer. (See Chapter 4 for more on feedback.)
 
You can also send an invoice from your My eBay page, Items I’ve Sold area. 
Click the drop-down box in the Action column next to the item. Just click the 
Send Invoice link, verify all the information, and click Send Invoice. Figure 12-1 
shows what the invoice e-mail looks like.

Let’s keep e-mailing
If you have a good transaction going (and the majority of them are good), the 
buyer will reply to your e-mail within a few business days. Customarily, most 
replies come the next day. If your buyer has questions regarding anything 
you asked in your e-mail, you’ll get those inquiries now. Most of the time, 
all you get back is, “Thanks. I’ll send the PayPal Payment when I get paid on 
Thursday.” Hey, that’s all I ask.
If any last-minute details need to be worked out, usually the buyer asks to 
set up a time to call or request further instructions about the transaction. 
Respond to this communication as soon as possible. If you can’t deal with it 
at the moment, let the buyer know you’re working on it and will shoot those 
answers back ASAP. Never let an e-mail go unanswered.
For sample e-mail letters and deeper information, get your hands on a copy 
of my book on more advanced eBay selling, Starting an eBay Business For 
Dummies (Wiley).
Shipping without Going Postal
Shipping can be the most time-consuming (and most dreaded) task for many 
eBay sellers. Even if the selling portion of your transaction goes flawlessly, 
the item has to get to the buyer in one piece. If it doesn’t, the deal could be 
ruined — and so could your reputation.
This section briefs you on shipping etiquette, gives you details about the 
three most popular shipping options (the U.S. Postal Service, UPS, and FedEx 
Ground), and offers tips on how to make sure your package is ready to ride.
The best way to avoid shipping problems is to do your homework beforehand, 
determine which method is likely to work best, and spell out in your item 
description exactly how you intend to ship the item. Here’s how I handle the 
process:
 
1. Before listing, get the package ready to ship.
 
 You don’t have to seal the package right away, but you should have it 
ready to seal because the two critical factors in shipping are weight and 
time. The more a package weighs and the faster it has to be delivered, 
the higher the charge. (I cover packing materials and tips later in this 
section.) The time to think about packing and shipping is before you put 
the item up for sale — that way, last-minute surprises are less likely to 
arise while your buyer waits impatiently for the item!

232
Part III: Making Money the eBay Way 
 
2. Know your carrier options.
 
 In the United States, the three main shipping options for most eBay 
transactions are the U.S. Postal Service, UPS, and FedEx. See the section 
“Shopping for a shipper” (try saying that five times fast) for how you can 
get rate options from each service, painlessly and online. Compare costs 
and services.
 
3. Before quoting the shipping fees, make sure that you include all 
appropriate costs.
 
 I recommend that you charge a nominal handling fee (up to $1.00 isn’t 
out of line) to cover your packing materials, labels, and time, which can 
add up quickly as you start making multiple transactions. You should 
also include any insurance costs and any delivery-confirmation costs. 
See the sidebar “Insuring your peace of mind (and your shipment)” for 
more information.
 
 Some eBay scam artists inflate shipping and handling costs to make 
added profit. Shame, shame, shame on them. Purposely overcharging 
is tacky, ugly, and immature. (It’s also a violation of eBay policy on 
circumventing fees and will penalize your listings in Best Match search). 
The buyer also often figures it out after one look at the postage on 
the box.
 
 Post a flat shipping amount (or use the eBay online shipping calculator — 
see Chapter 10 for more on how to use this tool). This way, buyers can 
include this cost when they consider their bidding strategies. Figure 
out what the packed item will weigh and then give a good estimate; the 
online calculators can help.
 
 If the item is heavy and you need to use a shipping service that charges 
by weight and distance, be sure to say in your auction description that 
you’re just giving an estimate and that the final cost will be determined 
after the listing is over. Optionally, you can tell the bidder how much 
the item weighs, where you’re shipping from, and what your handling 
charges are (a few bidders don’t mind doing the math).
 
 Occasionally, shipping calculations can be off-target, and you may not 
know that until after you take the buyer’s money. If the mistake is in 
your favor and is a biggie, notify the buyer and offer a refund. But if 
shipping ends up costing you a bit more, take your lumps and pay it 
yourself. Consider it part of the cost of doing business. You can always 
let the buyer know what happened and that you paid the extra cost. 
Who knows, it may show up positively on your feedback from the buyer! 
(Even if it doesn’t, spreading goodwill never hurts.)
 
4. E-mail the buyer and congratulate him or her on winning; reiterate 
what your shipping choice is and how long you expect delivery will 
take.
 
 Make sure you’re both talking about the same timetable. If the buyer 
balks at either the price or the shipping time, try working out an option 
that will make the buyer happy.

233
 Chapter 12: Closing the Deal and Shipping It Out 
 
5. Send the package.
 
 When should you ship the package? Common courtesy says it should go 
out as soon as the buyer has paid for the item and shipping charges. If 
the buyer has followed through with his or her side of the bargain, you 
should do the same. Ship that package no more than a few days after 
payment (or after the check clears). If you can’t, immediately e-mail the 
buyer and explain the delay. You should e-mail the buyer as soon as you 
send the package and ask for an e-mail to confirm arrival after the item 
gets there. (Don’t forget to put in a plug for positive feedback.)
 
Send a prompt follow-up e-mail to let the buyer know the item’s on the way. In 
this e-mail, be sure to include when the item was sent, how long it should take to 
arrive, any special tracking or delivery confirmation number (if you have one), 
and a request for a return e-mail confirming arrival after the item gets there. I 
also include a thank-you note (a receipt would be a business-like addition) in 
each package I send out. I appreciate when I get one in eBay packages, and it 
always brings a smile to the recipient’s face. It never hurts to take every 
opportunity to promote goodwill (and future business and positive feedback).
 
More often than not, you do get an e-mail back from the buyer to let you know 
the item arrived safely. If you don’t (and they haven’t received any feedback), 
it’s a good idea to send another e-mail (in about a week) to ask whether the 
item arrived in good condition. It jogs the buyer’s memory and demonstrates 
your professionalism as a seller. Use this opportunity to gently remind buyers 
that you’ll be leaving positive feedback for them. Ask whether they’re satisfied 
and don’t be bashful about suggesting they do the same for you. Leave feedback 
right away so that you don’t forget.
Shopping for a shipper
If only you could transport your item the way they did on Star Trek — “Beam 
up that antique lamp, Scotty!” Alas, it’s not so. Priority Mail via the U.S. Postal 
Service (USPS) is pretty much the eBay standard if you’re shipping within 
the United States and Canada. Many Americans also rely on the USPS to ship 
internationally as well. FedEx and UPS are global alternatives that work 
well, too.
 
Many sellers think that they are unequivocally covered by requiring their 
buyers to purchase insurance. Even if your buyer opts not to pay for insur-
ance, you are still responsible for making sure that the item arrives at the buy-
er’s door. Federal mail order laws state that when an item is paid for, it must 
be delivered to the buyer within 30 days unless there has been an agreement 
between the buyer and the seller for other arrangements.

234
Part III: Making Money the eBay Way 
 
Whether you’re at the post office, UPS, FedEx, or your doctor’s office, be 
ready, willing, and able to wait in line. There’s definitely a “rush hour” at my 
neighborhood Post Office — everybody’s in a rush, so everything moves at a 
glacial pace. Avoid both the noontime and post-work crunches (easier on the 
nerves). A good time to ship is around 10:30 a.m., when everyone is still in a 
good mood. If I have to go in the afternoon, I go about 3:00 p.m., when the 
clerks are back from their lunch breaks and friendly faces (mine, too — I 
always smile!) can take the edge off those brusque lunchtime encounters. Why 
not save yourself the time and stress by requesting a carrier pickup from the 
Post Office Web site (www.usps.com) if you can ship from home.
 
Be sure to visit my Web site, www.coolebaytools.com, for introductory 
offers for much of the software and services that I mention in this book.
Insuring your peace of mind (and your shipment)
Sure, “damaged in the mail” is an excuse 
we’ve all heard hundreds of times, but despite 
everyone’s best efforts, sometimes things do 
get damaged or misplaced during shipment. 
The universe is a dangerous place; that’s what 
insurance is for. I usually offer to get insurance 
from the shipper if the buyer wants to pay for it, 
and I always get it on expensive items, one-of-
a-kind items, or very fragile items. I spell out in 
my item description that the buyer pays for the 
insurance.
The major shippers all offer insurance that’s 
fairly reasonably priced, so check out their 
rates on their Web sites. But don’t forget to 
read the details. For example, many items on 
eBay are sold MIMB (Mint in Mint Box). True, 
the condition of the original box often has a 
bearing on the final value of the item inside, 
but the U.S. Postal Service insures only what is 
in the box. So, if you sold a Malibu Barbie mint 
in a mint box, USPS insures only the doll and 
not the original box. Pack carefully so that your 
buyer gets what’s been paid for. Be mindful that 
shippers won’t make good on insurance claims 
if they suspect you of causing the damage by 
doing a lousy job of packing.
Alternatively, when you’re selling on eBay in 
earnest, you can purchase your own parcel 
protection policy from a private insurer like 
U-PIC. When you use this type of insurance, 
combined with preprinted electronic postage, 
you no longer have to stand in line at the post 
office to have your insured package logged in 
by the clerk at the counter.
Some sellers also offer their own form of 
self-insurance. Realize that I use the term 
“self-insurance” as a descriptive phrase only. 
You may not charge your buyer for insurance 
unless you are actually paying for insurance 
from a licensed third-party insurance company. 
Charging and not fulfilling insurance is a 
violation of state law. Here’s what I offer my 
buyers at no cost to them:
 ✓ On lower-priced items, I am willing to refund 
the buyer’s money if the item is lost or 
damaged.
 ✓ On some items I sell, I have a risk 
reserve. That means I have more than 
one of the item I sold. If the item is lost or 
destroyed, I can send the backup item as a 
replacement.

235
 Chapter 12: Closing the Deal and Shipping It Out 
U.S. Postal Service
The U.S. Postal Service (USPS) is the butt of many unfair jokes and cheap 
shots, but when it comes right down to it, I think USPS is still the most 
efficient and inexpensive way to ship items — eBay or otherwise. It also 
supplies free boxes and labels for Priority and Express Mail packages. Here 
are some ways eBay members get their items from here to there via USPS:
 
✓ Priority Mail: As mentioned earlier, this is the de facto standard method 
of shipping for eBay users. I love the free boxes, and I like the rates. The 
promised delivery time is two to three days, although I’ve experienced 
rare delays of up to a week during peak holiday periods.
 
 Cost? As of this writing (rates are always subject to change), Priority 
Mail costs $4.95 for a 1-pound package. Over a pound, the charge is 
calculated according to weight and distance.
 
 A $4.95 flat-rate Priority envelope is also available. You can ship as much 
stuff as you want — as long as you can fit it into the supplied 9
1⁄2 x 12
1⁄2 
envelope. (You’ll be surprised how much stuff you can jam into those 
envelopes.) You can reinforce the envelope with clear packing tape.
 
 There are also flat-rate Priority Mail boxes that come in three sizes and 
allow you to send heavy items for reduced rates. Order them directly 
from the USPS. Figure 12-2 shows you some of the wide selection!

236
Part III: Making Money the eBay Way 
 
 If you print your postage electronically, through a service such as 
Endicia or PayPal, you get a discount on your Priority Mail postage.
 
✓ Express Mail: If the item needs to be delivered the next day, use 
Express Mail. The Postal Service promises delivery no later than noon 
the following afternoon (even on weekends or holidays). And you can 
get free boxes.
 
 Cost? Express Mail runs $13.05 for packages 8 ounces and under. 
Express Mail also has a flat-rate envelope, which is the same size as the 
Priority flat-rate envelope and ships for $17.50. (You get a 5% discount 
when purchasing your postage electronically).
 
 The Postal Service offers a free special pickup for Priority Mail and 
Express Mail, no matter how many separate packages are included. If 
you have several packages, carrier pickup is an excellent option.
 
 Get to know your mail carrier and have your parcels ready and stacked 
up for him or her for the regular stop at your home. The mail carrier will 
be happy to take your packages back to the post office at no additional 
charge. (A bottle of icy-cold water for your letter carrier on hot days will 
go a long way in your relationship!)
 
✓ First-Class Mail: If your item weighs 13 ounces or less, you can use 
First-Class Mail. First-Class Mail is considerably cheaper than Priority. I 
try to ship as much as I can via First Class mail so I can have the edge on 
other sellers by offering lower shipping prices.
 
✓ Media Mail: This is a popular option among those who sell books on 
eBay. It’s the new name for two older products, Book Rate and Special 
Standard Mail. Media Mail rates start at $2.23 for the first pound and 
increase by $0.35 for each additional pound.
 
✓ Other options: The Postal Service offers all sorts of add-ons. I always 
get the delivery confirmation service that you can add to Priority Mail, 
as well as with other mailing services such as First Class or Parcel Post. 
The cost is a mere $0.75 — free on electronic purchases. It buys you the 
knowledge of when and where your item was delivered. Not only that, 
but if buyers report to PayPal that they want a refund because they 
never received an item, the scan on the delivery confirmation code 
prevents you from getting a chargeback.
 
 You can check on whether the package was delivered (or whether an 
attempt was made to deliver it). By typing the number online at www.
usps.com/shipping/trackandconfirm.htm.
If you’re an occasional shipper (you buy more than you sell on eBay) and 
don’t use PayPal, you can print bar-coded shipping labels with free delivery 
confirmation (for Priority Mail only) at the USPS site. No online e-mail 
functions are available, so you have to do all the e-mailing and record 
keeping yourself. But hey, the service is free. Just go to www.usps.com and 
find the Click-N-Ship link.

237
 Chapter 12: Closing the Deal and Shipping It Out 
 
Delivery confirmation also comes in handy if you try to collect insurance for 
an item that was never delivered or if the buyer says the item was never 
delivered. It gives you proof from the Postal Service that the item was sent. 
(I explain insuring shipments later in this chapter.) But understand that you 
cannot accurately track your package. Delivery confirmation is merely proof 
that the package was mailed and delivered. If your package gets lost in the 
mail for a few weeks, this number rarely acts as a tracking number and won’t 
reveal the location of your package until it’s delivered.
The USPS Web site (www.usps.com) gives you an overview of the U.S. Postal 
Service rates so that you can see all your options. It sure beats standing in 
that endless line! For a complete explanation of domestic rates, check out 
www.usps.com/prices/welcome.htm.
Even better, USPS has a page that can help you determine exactly what your 
item costs to mail (after you’ve packaged it and weighed it, of course). Start 
at the Rate Calculator page at postcalc.usps.gov and follow the instructions.
UPS
The folks in the brown UPS trucks love eBay. The options they offer vary, 
with everything from Overnight service to Ground service. UPS also takes 
many of the odd-shaped large boxes, such as those for computer equipment, 
that the U.S. Postal Service won’t.
UPS makes pickups, but you have to know the exact weight of your package 
so that you can pay when the UPS driver shows up. UPS charges for this 
service unless you have a daily shipper account and ship a minimum number 
of packages with UPS per week.
 
The rates for the same UPS shipment can vary based on whether you have a 
business account with UPS, whether the package goes to or is picked up at a 
residence, and whether you use the right kind of form. If you’re going to use 
UPS regularly, be sure to set up an account directly with UPS.
Although UPS offers “discounts” to eBay PowerSellers, don’t be fooled. If 
you ship mostly small packages, you’d have to ship truckloads full on a daily 
basis to compete with USPS rates.
You can find the UPS home page at www.ups.com. For rates, click the 
Shipping tab and then click Estimate Cost on the left side of the page, which 
gives you prices based on zip codes and package weights. (Note the ominous 
“estimate” rates.)
 
The UPS.com Quick Cost Calculator prices are based on what UPS charges its 
regular and high-volume users. When you get to the counter, the price may be 
higher than what you find on the Web.

238
Part III: Making Money the eBay Way 
My favorite link on the UPS site is the transit map that shows the United 
States and how long it takes to reach any place in the country (based on the 
originating zip code). If you’re thinking of shipping that compact refrigerator 
to Maine, you can check out this fun and informative page at www.ups.com/
using/services/servicemaps/servicemaps.html.
FedEx
I use FedEx Express Air all the time for rush business, but Express seems 
rather expensive for my eBay shipping. However, if the buyer wants it fast 
and is willing to pay, I’ll send it by FedEx overnight, you bet.
FedEx Ground service has competitive prices and carries all the best features 
of FedEx. I use FedEx Ground for items that are heavy (say, antique barbells) 
or extremely large (such as a 1920s steamer trunk), because FedEx ships 
anything up to 150 pounds in a single box — 80 more pounds than the U.S. 
Postal Service takes. FedEx also delivers on Saturdays — which UPS won’t. It 
also charges $4.00 to pick up items from shippers who ship less than $60.00 
in weekly package charges.
I also like the FedEx boxes. Like one of my favorite actors, Joe Pesci, from My 
Cousin Vinny and the Lethal Weapon movies, these boxes are small but tough. 
But if you’re thinking of reusing these boxes to ship with another service, 
forget it. The FedEx logo is plastered all over every inch of the freebies, and 
Sí, oui, ja, yes! Shipping internationally
Money’s good no matter what country it comes 
from. I don’t know why, but lots of people seem 
to be afraid to ship internationally and list “I 
don’t ship overseas” on the auction page. Of 
course, sending an item that far away may 
be a burden if you’re selling a car or a street-
sweeper (they don’t fit in boxes too well), but 
I’ve found that sending a package across the 
Atlantic can be just as easy as shipping across 
state lines. The only downside: My shipper of 
choice, the U.S. Postal Service, does not insure 
packages going to certain countries (check 
with your post office to find out which ones; 
they seem to change with the headlines), so I 
use private shipping insurance with U-PIC.
Here are a couple of other timely notes about 
shipping internationally:
 ✓ You need to tell what’s inside the 
package. Be truthful when declaring value 
on customs forms. Use descriptions that 
customs agents can figure out without 
knowing eBay shorthand terms. For 
example, instead of declaring the contents 
as “MIB Barbie,” call it a “small child’s 
doll.” Some countries require buyers to pay 
special duties and taxes, depending on the 
item and the value. But that’s the buyer’s 
headache.
 ✓ Wherever you send your package 
(especially if it’s going to a country where 
English is not the native language), write 
legibly. (Imagine getting a package from 
Russia and having to decipher a label 
written in the Cyrillic alphabet. ’Nuff said.)

239
 Chapter 12: Closing the Deal and Shipping It Out 
the company may get seriously peeved about it. You can’t use those fancy 
boxes for its Ground service.
 
The FedEx Ground Home Delivery service is a major competitor for UPS. The 
rates are competitive, and FedEx offers a money-back guarantee (if it misses 
the delivery window) for residential ground delivery. For residential delivery, 
FedEx charges an additional $2.30 to $2.40 per package. A 2-pound package 
going from Los Angeles to a residence in New York City takes five days and 
costs $8.71 including the Home Delivery fee. FedEx includes online package 
tracking and insurance up to $100.00 in this price. You have to be a business 
to avail yourself of home delivery — but plenty of home businesses exist.
The same 2-pound U.S. Postal Service Priority Mail package with $100.00 
insurance and a delivery confirmation costs you $11.50. (But remember, you 
know how to get free delivery confirmation forms, and insurance can cost 
much less with private package insurance!) Granted, the package will arrive 
within two to three days, but FedEx Ground guarantees a five-day delivery, 
and I’ve had a few Priority Mail packages take up to a week. FedEx Ground 
won’t supply boxes for you, so you’re on your own there. When you drop off 
your box at UPS, you can get five-day service for $11.53.
You can find the FedEx home page at www.fedex.com/us. The link for rates 
is conveniently located at the top of the page.
Getting the right (packing) stuff
You can never think about packing materials too early. If you wait until the 
last minute, you won’t find the right-size box, approved tape, or the labels 
you need. Start thinking about shipping even before you sell your first item.
Before you pack, give your item the once-over. Here’s a checklist of what to 
consider about your item before you call it a wrap (gotta love Hollywood lingo):
 
✓ Is your item as you described it? If the item has been dented or torn 
somehow, e-mail the winning bidder immediately and come clean. And 
if you sell an item with its original box or container, don’t just check the 
item, make sure the box is in the same good condition as the item inside. 
Collectors place a high value on original boxes, so make sure the box 
lives up to what you described in your listing. Pack to protect it as well.
 
✓ Is the item dirty or dusty, or does it smell of smoke? Some buyers may 
complain if the item they receive is dirty or smelly, especially from 
cigarette smoke. Make sure the item is fresh and clean, even if it’s used 
or vintage. If something’s dirty, check to make sure you know how to 
clean it properly (you want to take the dirt off, not the paint), and then 
give it a spritz with an appropriate cleaner or just soap and water. If you 
can’t get rid of the smell or the dirt, say so in your item description. Let 
the buyer decide whether the item is desirable with aromas and all.

 If the item has a faint smell of smoke or is a bit musty, a product called 
Febreze may help. Just get a plastic bag, give your item a spritz, and 
keep it in the bag for a short while. Note: This is not recommended for 
cardboard. And, as with any solvent or cleaning agent, read the label 
before you spray. Or, if you’re in a rush to mail the package, cut a 2-by-2-
inch piece of sheet fabric softener and place it in a plastic bag with the 
product.
When the item’s ready to go, you’re ready to pack it. The following sections 
give you suggestions on what you should consider using and where to find 
the right stuff.
Packing material: What to use
This may sound obvious, but you’d be surprised: Any list of packing material 
should start with a box. But you don’t want just any box — you want a heavy 
cardboard type that’s larger than the item. If the item is extremely fragile, I 
suggest you use two boxes, with the outer box about 3 inches larger on each 
side than the inner box that holds the item, to allow for extra padding. And 
if you still have the original shipping container for such things as electronic 
equipment, consider using the original, especially if it still has the original 
foam inserts (they were designed for the purpose, and this way they stay out 
of the environment awhile longer).
As for padding, Table 12-1 compares the most popular types of box-filler 
material.
Table 12-1 
Box-Filler Materials
Type
Pros and Cons
Suggestions
Bubble 
wrap
Pros: Lightweight, 
clean, cushions well
Cons: Cost
Don’t go overboard taping the bubble 
wrap. If the buyer has to battle to get 
the tape off, the item may go flying and 
end up damaged. And for crying out 
loud, don’t pop all the little bubbles, 
okay?
Newspaper
Pros: Cheap, 
cushions
Cons: Messy, and 
adds weight to the 
package
Seal fairly well. Put your item in a 
plastic bag to protect it from the ink. I 
like shredding the newspaper first. It’s 
more manageable and doesn’t seem to 
stain as much as wadded-up paper. I 
spent about $30.00 at an office-supply 
store for a shredder. (Or find one on 
eBay for much less.)

Type
Pros and Cons
Suggestions
Cut-up 
cardboard
Pros: Handy, cheap 
Cons: Transmits some 
shocks to item, hard to 
cut up, heavy
If you have some old boxes that aren’t 
sturdy enough to pack in, this is a 
pretty good use for them.
Styrofoam 
peanuts
Pros: Lightweight, 
absorb shock well, 
clean
Cons: Environmentally 
unfriendly, annoying
Your item may shift if you don’t put 
enough peanuts in the box, so make 
sure to fill the box. Also, don’t buy 
these; recycle them from stuff that was 
shipped to you (plastic trash bags are 
great for storing them). And never use 
plastic peanuts when packing elec-
tronic equipment, because they can 
create static electricity. Even a little 
spark can trash a computer chip.
Air-popped 
popcorn
Pros: Lightweight, 
environmentally 
friendly, absorbs 
shock well, clean (as 
long as you don’t use 
salt and butter, but 
you knew that), low in 
calories 
Cons: Cost, time to pop
You don’t want to send it anywhere 
there may be varmints who like it. The 
U.S. Postal Service suggests popcorn. 
Hey, at least you can eat the leftovers!
Storing those bags of plump packing peanuts
By now, you may have realized that I have com-
mandeered a large chunk of my home for my 
eBay business, and you might think that I live in 
a giant swamp of packing materials. Not really. 
But I do have to store loads of packing peanuts. 
They’re not heavy, but they sure are bulky!
If you have a house with a garage, you’re set! 
Bear with me now, my plan isn’t as crazy as 
it seems. Go to your local store and purchase 
some large screw-in cup hooks. Then 
purchase the largest drawstring plastic bags 
you can find. (I’m partial to 39-gallon Glad Lawn 
& Leaf bags.)
Screw the cup hooks into strategic locations 
on the ceiling rafters of your garage. Now fill 
the drawstring bags to capacity with packing 
peanuts and hang. When you’ve finished 
your garage will look like some bizarre art 
installation, but it gets the packing peanuts off 
the floor and out of your hair. I even set up a 
packing-peanuts barricade so I don’t hit the end 
of my garage when I park!

242
Part III: Making Money the eBay Way 
 
Whatever materials you use, make sure that you pack the item well and that 
you secure the box. Many shippers will contest insurance claims if they feel 
you did a lousy job of packing. Do all the little things that you’d want done if 
you were the buyer — using double boxes for really fragile items, wrapping 
lids separately from containers, and filling hollow breakables with some kind 
of padding. Here are a few other items you need:
 
✓ Plastic bags: Plastic bags protect your item from moisture. I once sent a 
MIB doll to the Northeast, and the package got caught in a snowstorm. 
The buyer e-mailed me with words of thanks for the extra plastic bag, 
which saved the item from being soaked along with the outer box. 
(Speaking of boxes, if you send an item in an original box, bag it.)
 
 For any small items, such as stuffed animals, you should always protect 
them in a lunch baggie. For slightly larger items, go to the 1-quart or 
1-gallon size. Be sure to wrap any paper or cloth products, such as 
clothing and linens, in plastic before you ship.
 
✓ Bubble-padded mailers: The shipping cost for a package that weighs 
less than 13 ounces (First-Class mail) is usually considerably cheaper 
than Priority. Many small items, clothing, books, and so on will fit 
comfortably into the many available sizes of padded envelopes. You 
can find them made of Kraft paper or extra sturdy vinyl. A big plus is 
that they weigh considerably less than boxes — even when using extra 
padding. See Table 12-2 for standard sizes.
 
✓ Address labels: You’ll need extras because it’s always a good idea 
to toss a duplicate address label inside the box, with the destination 
address and a return address, in case the outside label falls off or 
becomes illegible.
 
✓ Shipping tape, 2 or 3 inches: Make sure that you use a strong shipping 
tape for the outside of the box. Clear plastic will do just fine. There is 
also box-color tape that works very well for recycling boxes (taping over 
old shipping information). Remember not to plaster every inch of box 
with tape; leave space for those Fragile and Insured rubber stamps.
 
✓ Hand-held shipping tape dispensers: It’s quite a bit easier to zzzzzip! 
tape from a tape dispenser than to unwind it and bite it off with your 
teeth. Have one dispenser for your special shipping tape and one for 
your clear tape.
 
✓ Lightweight 2-inch clear tape: For taping the padding around the inside 
items. I also use a clear strip of tape over the address on the outside of 
the box so that it won’t disappear in the rain.
 
✓ Scissors: A pair of large, sharp scissors. Having a hobby knife to trim 
boxes or shred newspaper is also a good idea.

243
 Chapter 12: Closing the Deal and Shipping It Out 
 
✓ Handy liquids: Three that I like are GOO GONE (which is available in 
the household supply section of most retail stores and is a wonder at 
removing unwanted stickers and price tags); WD-40 (the unstick-everything 
standby that works great on getting stickers off plastic); and Un-Du (the 
best liquid I’ve found to take labels off cardboard). Lighter fluid also 
does the trick, but be very careful handling it and be sure to clean up 
thoroughly to remove any residue.
 
✓ Rubber stamps/stickers: Using custom rubber stamps or stickers can 
save you a bunch of time when preparing your packages. I purchased 
some return address self-inking rubber stamps. I use these stamps to 
stamp all kinds of things that require my identification. I often also 
use their fluorescent red SCAN NOW stickers next to my Delivery 
Confirmations.
 
✓ Thermal label printer: Once I thought this was a flagrant waste of 
money, but now I wouldn’t be without one. When you begin shipping 
several packages a week, you’ll find it far more convenient to use a 
separate label printer for addressing and delivery confirmations. 
Dymo offers one of the best deals; you can find them on eBay for about 
$100.00. If you want to get industrial, try one of the Zebra thermal 
printers (I use the LP2844). These printers can print labels for Fed Ex 
and UPS as well as USPS (you can also get deals on these on eBay).
 
✓ Black permanent marker: These are handy for writing information 
(“Please leave on porch behind the planter”) and the all-important 
“Fragile” all over the box or “Do Not Bend” on envelopes. I like the big, 
fat Sharpie markers.

Part III: Making Money the eBay Way 
If you plan to sell on eBay in earnest, consider adding a 10-pound weight 
scale (for weighing packages) to your shipping department. I’m using a 
super-small 13-pound maximum scale, which I bought on eBay for only $29.95.
 
When it comes to fragile items, dishes, pottery, porcelain, china — anything 
that can chip, crack, or smash into a thousand pieces — double box. The 
boxes should be about 3 inches different on each side. Make sure that you 
use enough padding so that the interior box is snug. Just give it a big shake. If 
nothing rattles, ship away!
Packing material: Where to find it
The place to start looking for packing material is the same place you should 
start looking for things to sell on eBay: your house. Between us, I’ve done 
over a thousand eBay transactions and never once paid for a carton. I buy 
most of my stuff from catalogs and online companies (I love e-commerce) 
and save all the boxes, bubble wrap, padding, and packing peanuts I get in 
the mail. Just empty your boxes of packing peanuts into large plastic trash 
bags — that way, they don’t take up much storage space. If you recently got 
a mail-order shipment box that was used only once — and it’s a good, sturdy 
box with no dents or dings — there’s nothing wrong with using it again. Just 
be sure to completely cover any old labels so the delivery company doesn’t 
get confused.
Beyond the ol’ homestead, here are a few other suggestions for places where 
you can rustle up some packing stuff:
 
✓ Your local supermarket, department store, or drugstore: You won’t 
be the first person pleading with a store manager for boxes. (Ah, fond 
memories of moving days past.) Stores like giving them away because it 
saves them the work of compacting the boxes and putting them in the 
trash or recycling bin.
 
 I have found that drugstores and beauty supply stores have a better 
variety of smaller boxes. But make sure that you don’t take dirty boxes 
reeking of food smells.
 
✓ The inside of your local supermarket, department store, or drugstore: 
Places like Kmart, Wal-Mart, Target, and office-supply stores often have 
good selections of packing supplies.
 
✓ Shippers such as UPS, FedEx, and the U.S. Postal Service: These 
shippers offer all kinds of free supplies as long as you use these supplies 
to ship things with their service.
 
 The Postal Service also ships free boxes, packing tape, labels, and 
shipping forms for Express Mail, Priority Mail, and Global Priority Mail 
to your house. In the United States, you can order by phone 
(800-222-1811) or online (shop.usps.com). Here are a few rules for 
USPS orders:

245
 Chapter 12: Closing the Deal and Shipping It Out 
 
• Specify the service (Priority Mail, Express Mail, or Global Priority 
Mail) you’re using because the boxes and the labels all come with 
the service name printed all over them, and you can use them only 
for that specific service.
 
• Order in bulk. For example, address labels come in rolls of 500 and 
boxes in packs of 25.
 
• The boxes come flat, so you have to assemble them. Hey, don’t 
look a gift box in the mouth — they’re free!
 
✓ eBay and online sellers: Many terrific eBay sellers are out to offer you 
really good deals. (You can’t beat eBay sellers for quality goods, low 
prices, and great service.) I recommend the following family-run eBay 
stores:
 
• Royal Mailers is where I buy my padded paper envelope mailers 
for my eBay sales. This company also sells Tyvek envelopes, vinyl 
bubble mailers, zipper-lock plastic bags, air pillows, box sealing 
tape, and lots more. They offer free shipping and a discount of 5% 
to my readers if you use this code: COOLEBAY. Visit their Web site 
at www.royalmailers.com.
 
• Bubblefast — an eBay seller from the Chicago area — sells tons of 
reasonably priced bubble wrap, mailers, and more.
 
• Melrose Stamp is based in New York (but its items are tiny, so 
shipping isn’t a huge issue). Melrose Stamp mainly sells custom 
and stock message rubber stamps. They also sell rolls of package 
identification labels such as Fragile, Scan Me, First Class, Media 
Mail, and Airmail.
Notice that I mention where these vendors are located. When ordering a 
large shipment, the distance it has to travel from the vendor’s place to yours 
can tack on quite a bit of cash (and time) to your shipping costs!
Buying Postage Online
Isn’t technology great? You no longer have to schlep to the post office every 
time you need stamps. What’s even better, with the new print-it-yourself 
postage, you can give all your packages directly to your mail carrier. When 
you install your Internet postage software, you apply for a USPS postal 
license that allows you to print your own Information Based Indicia (IBI) 
for your postage. IBI is a bar code printed either on labels or directly on an 
envelope and has both human- and machine-readable information about 
where it was printed and security-related elements. IBI provides you, and the 
post office, with a much more secure way of getting your valuable packages 
through the mail.

246
Part III: Making Money the eBay Way 
You can print postage for First Class, Priority, Express, and Parcel Post, and 
additional postage for delivery confirmation and insurance. If your printer 
mangles a sheet of labels or an envelope, you can send the printed piece 
to your Internet postage provider for a refund. Several vendors of Internet-
based postage exist, but Endicia Internet Postage, and Stamps.com are the 
most popular.
Preparing Postage with Endicia
In the early 90s, a couple of guys came up with new software to enable people 
to design direct-mail pieces from the desktop. Wow! What an innovation. 
With the inexpensive software, you could also produce your own bar coding 
for the Postal Service. I used that software then, like I use DAZzle now. Take a 
look at the DAZzle software in Figure 12-3.
 
Figure 12-3: 
DAZzle 
software 
all set up to 
send some 
International 
First Class 
mail.
 
DAZzle — combined with the patented Dial-A-Zip — became the basis for the 
software that comes free with the Endicia Internet Postage service. There 
isn’t a more robust mailing program on the market.

247
 Chapter 12: Closing the Deal and Shipping It Out 
Endicia has all the basic features and more:
 
✓ Prints postage for all classes of mail, including international: From 
Anniston, Alabama, to Bulawayo, Zimbabwe, the DAZzle software not 
only prints postage but also lists all your shipping options and applicable 
rates. For international mailing, Endicia advises you about any prohibitions 
(no prison-made goods can be mailed to Botswana), any restrictions, 
any necessary customs forms, and areas served within the country.
 
✓ Provides free delivery confirmation on Priority Mail: You can print 
electronic delivery confirmations for First Class, Parcel Post, and Media 
Mail for only $0.18 each (a substantial savings from the Postal Service 
counter purchase).
 
✓ Enables you to design mail pieces: The software enables you to design 
envelopes, postcards, and labels with color graphics, logos, and text 
messages. You can print your labels with postage and delivery confirmation 
on anything from plain paper (tape it on with clear tape) to 4-by-6 labels 
in a label printer.
 
✓ Integrates with U-PIC private insurance: If you’re saving time and 
money using a private package insurer, you can send your monthly 
insurance logs electronically to U-PIC at the end of the month.
Endicia offers two levels of service. All the preceding features come with the 
standard plan for $9.95 a month. The premium plan adds special features, 
customizable e-mail, enhanced online transaction reports and statistics, 
business reply mail, return shipping labels (prepaid so your customers won’t 
have to pay for the returns), and stealth indicias for $15.95 a month.
 
A stealth indicia (also known as the postage-paid indicia) is an awesome tool 
for the eBay seller. By using this feature, your customers can’t see the exact 
amount of postage that you paid for the package. This way, you can add 
reasonable shipping and handling costs and not inflame buyers when they see 
the final label.
For a free 60-day trial (30 days longer than offered to anyone else), go to

Shipping Directly from PayPal
I consider PayPal shipping to be required for all beginning eBay sellers. 
By using PayPal, a seller can streamline the buyer’s shopping experience, 
making it simple to buy, click, and pay. Those out in the eBay world who 

248
Part III: Making Money the eBay Way 
haven’t used PayPal find the service to be a life-changing experience. Because 
you don’t need to use additional software or sign up with an additional 
service, shipping with PayPal is a convenient system for those who don’t 
have to ship many packages each week.
When you’re ready to deal with shipping, you simply sign on to your PayPal 
account and handle it right on the site. You can also click the Print Label link 
from the item’s page to start the process. There’s no charge for the service 
and you have a choice of U.S Postal Service or UPS (sorry, no FedEx Ground).
 
As of this date, PayPal will not print postage for First Class Mail International; 
it prints postage only for the far more expensive Priority or Express. If you 
plan on doing business overseas (like I do), be competitive with your shipping 
costs. It will bring you more business from savvy international buyers.

T
here’s no getting around it: The more transactions you conduct on eBay, 
the more chances you have of facing some potential pitfalls. In this chap-
ter, I give you pointers on how to handle an obnoxious or difficult buyer as 
if he or she is your new best friend (for a little while anyway). In addition, I 
explain how to keep an honest misunderstanding from blowing up into a vitri-
olic e-mail war. You find out how to handle a sale that’s (shall I say) on a road 
to nowhere, how to get some attention, and if it all goes sour, how to sell to 
the next highest bidder legally and relist the item, and get back the final value 
fee you paid eBay. There’s no way that all of what I mention here will happen 
to you, but the more you know, the better prepared you’ll be.
Dealing with a Buyer Who 
Doesn’t Respond
Most of the time, the post-auction transaction between buyers and sell-
ers goes smoothly. However, if you have difficulty communicating with the 
winner of your auction or fixed-price sale, you should know the best way to 
handle the situation.

250
Part III: Making Money the eBay Way 
You’ve come to the right place if you want help dealing with potential non-
paying buyers (more commonly known as deadbeat bidders, which is how I 
refer to them). Of course, you should start with good initial post-auction com-
munication; see Chapter 12 for details. (For more information on how to deal 
with a fraudulent seller, see Chapter 16.)
Going into nudge mode
Despite my best efforts, sometimes things fall through the cracks. Buyers 
should pay for the item without delay through PayPal or at least pay within 
three business days of the close of the sale. Sometimes winners contact sell-
ers immediately, and some use Checkout and pay for the item immediately, 
which saves you any hassle. However, if you don’t hear from the buyer within 
three business days of your initial contact, my advice is don’t panic.
People are busy; they travel, they get sick, their computer crashes, or some-
times your item simply slips the winner’s mind. After four days of no com-
munication, you can go to your My eBay page and send a payment reminder 
message. You find the Contact Buyer link on the item’s listing on the My eBay 
Sold page, as shown in Figure 13-1.
 
Figure 13-1: 
The Contact 
Buyer link 
on the item 
page.
 
If a few more days pass and you still haven’t heard from the winner, you need 
to get into big-time nudge-nudge mode — as in, “Mr. X, remember me and your 
obligation to buy the Tiffany lamp you purchased on eBay last week?”

251
 Chapter 13: Troubleshooting Transactions
Send a polite-but-firm message letting Mr. X know that when he bid and won 
your auction, he became obligated to pay and complete the transaction. If 
Mr. X doesn’t intend to buy your item for any reason, he needs to let you 
know immediately.
 
Don’t threaten your buyer. The last thing you want to do is add insult to injury 
in case the buyer is facing a real problem. Besides, if the high bidder goes to 
sleep with the fishes, you’ll never see your money.
Here’s what to include in your nudge-nudge e-mail:
 
✓ A gentle admonishment, such as, “Perhaps this slipped your mind,” or 
“You may have missed my e-mail to you,” or “I’m sure you didn’t mean 
to ignore my first e-mail.”
 
✓ A gentle reminder that eBay’s policy is that every bid is a binding con-
tract. You can even refer the buyer to eBay’s rules and regulations if 
you want.
 
✓ A statement that firmly (but gently) explains that, so far, you’ve held up 
your side of the deal and you’d appreciate it if he did the same.
 
✓ A date by which you expect to see payment. Gently explain that if the 
deadline isn’t met, you’ll have no other choice but to consider the deal 
invalid.
 
Technically, you can nullify the transaction if you don’t hear from a buyer 
within three business days. However, eBay members are a forgiving bunch 
under the right circumstances. I think you should give your buyer a one-week 
grace period after the listing ends to get in touch with you and set up a pay-
ment plan. If, at the end of the grace period, you don’t see any real progress 
toward closing the deal, say goodnight, Gracie. Consider the deal kaput and go 
directly to the section “Auction Going Badly? Cut Your Losses” (later in this 
chapter) to find out what recourse you have.
Do a little sleuthing
I’d like to say that history repeats itself, but that would be a cliché. (All right, 
you caught me, but clichés are memorable because they’re so often true.) 
After you send your polite and gentle nudge-nudge e-mail, but before you 
decide that the transaction is a lost cause, take a look at the bidder’s feed-
back history. Figure 13-2 shows you what feedback looks like; all this feed-
back is positive. It’s tough (but possible) to be this perfect.

252
Part III: Making Money the eBay Way 
 
Figure 13-2: 
You can get 
a good idea 
of whether 
a buyer will 
complete 
a sale by 
looking at 
his or her 
feedback 
profile.
 
To check a bidder’s feedback (starting at your item page), do the following:
 
1. Click the number in parentheses next to your winner’s user ID.
 
 This action takes you to the member’s feedback profile page.
 
2. Scroll down the feedback profile page and read the comments.
 
 Check to see if the bidder has received negative feedback from previous 
sellers. Make a note of it in case you need some support and background 
information (should you be chastised at a later date for blocking an 
unwanted bid).
 
3. Conduct a Bidder search.
 
 Click Advanced Search and do an Items by Bidder search to see the buy-
er’s conduct in previous transactions. How many items has the buyer 
won? Click the item number to see the history of the auction. For more 
info on Bidder searches, check out Chapter 5.
 
If you’ve had a bad experience with a deadbeat buyer and you don’t want 
that person to be able to bid or buy your items in the future, you can set up 
a bidder block for his or her user ID. If bidders are blocked by you, they can’t 
bid; eBay tells them they have to contact you by e-mail before their bids will 
be accepted. You can add or delete bidders from your list at any time. eBay 
has managed to make the page very hard to find; you must go through the 
Help area or directly to the Buyer/Bidder Management area at pages.ebay.
com/services/buyandsell/biddermanagement.html.

253
 Chapter 13: Troubleshooting Transactions
 
When all else fails, you may want to double-check with some of the bidder’s 
previous sellers. It’s okay to use eBay’s Contact Member system to contact 
previous sellers who’ve dealt with the bidder. They’re often happy to give you 
details on how well (or badly) the transaction went.
If the buyer’s feedback profile provides any indication that the buyer has 
gone AWOL in the past, start thinking about getting out of the transaction 
before too much time passes. If the buyer looks to be on the level, continue 
to give him or her the benefit of the doubt.
Be sure to ask previous sellers that dealt with the bidder the following ques-
tions (politely):
 
✓ Did the buyer pay on time?
 
✓ Did his or her check clear? (It could have been an eCheck)
 
✓ Did he or she communicate well?
 
When e-mailing a third party about any negative feedback he or she has 
left, choose your words carefully. There’s no guarantee that if you trash the 
bidder, the third party will keep your e-mail private. Make sure that you stick 
to the facts. Writing false or malicious statements can put you in danger of 
being sued.
Stepping things up a notch
If you don’t hear from the winner after a week, your next course of action is 
to contact the winner by phone. To get the contact information of an eBay 
member for transaction purposes only, do the following:
 
1. Click the Advanced Search link, which is next to the Search box on 
the top of most eBay pages.
 
 You arrive at the Advanced Search area.
 
2. Click the Find Contact Information link, which is under the Members 
area in the left side link box.
 
3. In the Contact Info box, type the user ID of the person you’re trying to 
contact and the item number of the transaction in question.
 
4. Click the Search button.
 
 eBay e-mails you the registered contact information of the person with 
whom you want to be in touch and also sends your contact information to 
that person.

254
Part III: Making Money the eBay Way 
 
Wait a day before calling the person. I like sending a last-chance e-mail after 
seven days that says you want to put the item back up on eBay if the buyer 
is no longer interested. Also mention that you want to apply for any credits 
you can get from eBay due to an incomplete transaction. If enough money is 
involved in the transaction, and you feel it’s worth the investment, make the 
call to the winner. eBay automatically sends your request and your informa-
tion to the bidder, and that may be enough of a nudge to get some action.
If you do get the person on the phone, keep the conversation like your e-mail — 
friendly but businesslike. Explain who you are and when the auction closed, and 
ask if any circumstances have delayed the bidder’s reply. Often, the buyer will be 
so shocked to hear from you that you’ll receive payment immediately, or you’ll 
know this person is a complete deadbeat.
Other Possible Auction Problems
I’m not quite sure why, but where money is involved, sometimes people act 
weird. Buyers may suddenly decide that they can’t purchase an item after 
they’ve made a commitment, or there may be payment problems or shipping 
problems. Whatever the problem, look no further than this section to find out 
how to make things better.
The buyer backs out of the transaction
Every time eBay members place a bid or click Buy It Now, they make a com-
mitment to purchase the item in question — in theory, anyway. In the real 
world, people have second thoughts, despite the rules. You have every 
right to be angry that you’re losing money and wasting your time. Remind 
the buyer that making a bid is a binding contract. But, unfortunately, if the 
winner won’t pay up, you can’t do much except apply for a final value fee 
refund and lick your wounds. Jump to Chapter 6 to find out more about buy-
er’s remorse.
Keeping your cool
By all means, if the buyer of your item tells you that the transaction can’t 
be completed, no matter what the reason, remain professional despite your 
anger. For one thing, at least such a would-be buyer has the heart to break 
the news to you instead of ignoring your e-mail and phone calls.

 Chapter 13: Troubleshooting Transactions
When Plan A fails, try Plan B, or even C — Second Chance Offer
You have several options if the winner backs out:
 
✓ You can make a Second Chance offer: Offer the item to another bidder 
from the auction. eBay offers a little-known feature called Second Chance 
offer, which protects buyers just as if they were the winner of the auction. 
This is a great feature that turned the previously eBay-illegal practice of 
side deals into fair and approved deals. You can make a Second Chance 
offer to any underbidder from your auction (at the amount of their high 
bid) for up to 60 days after the auction’s end. The steps that follow this 
list detail how to make a Second Chance offer.
 
✓ You can request a full or partial final value fee credit and then relist 
the item and hope it sells again. (I give you more information on 
requesting a final value fee credit and relisting your item later in this 
chapter.) Who knows? This bidder may actually earn you money in the 
long run if you relist the item and get a higher winning bid.
You can make a Second Chance offer in two ways. Just follow these steps:
 
1. Go to the completed auction page.
 
2. On the top of the page, you’ll see some transaction-related links, as 
shown in Figure 13-3. Click the Make a Second Chance Offer link.
 
 You’re taken to the Second Chance Offer page, which has the auction 
number already filled in.
 
3. Click Continue.
 
 A page appears showing all your underbidders and their high bids.
A seller’s nightmare
I was on Facebook messaging with some 
other eBay sellers (feel free to find me on 
Facebook — all my readers are my friends!) 
and one was bemoaning a recent transaction. 
A seller always wants to sell a product, and a 
cooperative buyer makes the entire process 
pleasant. This particular seller was having a 
problem receiving payment from a buyer. Here’s 
what she said:
“The buyer first said her boss opened a PayPal 
account for her under his e-mail address and 
she couldn’t access it and now her daughter 
used her credit card so she can’t pay me. I tried 
to tell her she can add another e-mail address 
to the PayPal account and make it the primary 
but . . .”
Is this fair? I recommended to the seller that she 
offer to mutually close the deal through eBay 
so she’d be free to resell the item to someone 
else. A buyer has a responsibility to carry out 
their part of the transaction as seamlessly as 
we expect service from the seller.

 Chapter 13: Troubleshooting Transactions
The item you send is busted — 
and so are you
Uh-oh! Could it be true? Could you have sent the wrong item? Or is it possible 
that the crystal vase you thought you packed so well is a sad pile of shards 
at the bottom of a torn box? If so, read Chapter 12 as soon as you take care of 
this catastrophe so that you can get some hints on packing and insurance.
It’s time to do some serious problem solving. If the buyer met his or her end 
of the deal, you need to do your best to fix the problem. Your communication 
skills are your number-one asset in this situation, so get to work.
Picking up the pieces
No matter how carefully you pack an item, sometimes it arrives on the buy-
er’s doorstep mangled, broken, or squashed. News of this unfortunate event 
travels back to you fast. The buyer will let you know in an e-mail in about 30 
seconds how unhappy he or she is. (Sometimes they’re not very polite, but 
stay calm.) Tell the buyer to locate the insurance stamp or paper tag that’s 
attached to the package as proof of insurance and then take the whole man-
gled shebang back to his or her post office.
Leaving feedback after an imperfect 
auction experience
If the buyer never materializes, backs out, 
bounces a check, or moves slower than a gla-
cier to send your payment (but wants the item 
sent overnight from Boston to Khartoum at your 
expense), you need to think about how you 
want to word your feedback. As a seller, you 
can no longer leave negative feedback, but you 
can still write in a comment for other sellers to 
read. But if you do, remember to stick to the 
facts and don’t get personal. You can always 
leave no feedback.
Here are a few feedback tips:
 ✓ If the transaction was shaky but everything 
turned out all right in the end, go ahead and 
leave positive feedback, depending on how 
tough things went.
 ✓ If a blizzard stopped planes out of Chicago 
for three days and that’s why it took a 
long time to get online to pay, take a deep 
breath, blame the fates, and leave positive 
feedback with a fair comment.
 ✓ If the buyer was a living nightmare, take a 
long break before getting nasty — and have 
someone you love and trust read it before 
you send something into the virtual world 
that you can’t take back.
For more information on leaving feedback, 
check out Chapters 4 and 6.

Part III: Making Money the eBay Way 
Here’s what happens at the post office:
 
✓ If the item is insured for less than $50.00, the buyer immediately gets a 
Postal Service money order for the value of the item.
 
✓ If the item is insured for over $50.00, the buyer fills out a claim form, 
and you’re contacted to fill out additional forms. You need to show your 
insurance receipt to the good people at the post office. You have to wait 
60 to 90 days for the paperwork to be processed before you actually 
get paid.
 
✓ Of course, the post office won’t refund the postage. Hey, they delivered 
the item, didn’t they?
If a package is lost, you’ll know it because the delivery confirmation never 
comes through, and the buyer tells you the package is a no-show. You need 
to go the post office from which you sent the item to file for insurance. Then 
the Postal Service checks around. If your item isn’t located in 30 days, it’s 
declared lost, and there’s another round of paperwork and processing before 
you get your money. And no, you don’t get a return on the postage either.
 
If you have private package insurance the process is much simpler. You don’t 
have to contact the shipper; you merely have to contact the insurance com-
pany and place a claim.
 
Lots of eBay sellers seem to think that if a buyer doesn’t pay for insurance 
and the package gets lost in transit, than it’s not the seller’s problem. They 
couldn’t be more wrong. The Federal Trade Commission has a strict rule cov-
ering mail order merchandise delivery. The short version is that if your item 
doesn’t get to the buyer within 30 days, you must refund the payment. The 
long version can be found at the FTC Web site:
www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/business/adv/bus02.shtm
Boxed out of a claim
In my experience, neither UPS nor the U.S. Postal Service will pay on an insur-
ance claim if they feel you did a lousy job of packing. Always use good pack-
ing products, wrap carefully, and get ready to plead your case.
 
Every shipping company has its own procedure for complaints. But here’s 
the one thing they do have in common: No procedure is hassle-free. Call your 
shipper as soon as a problem arises.

 Chapter 13: Troubleshooting Transactions
You have regrets — seller’s remorse
You’ve undoubtedly heard about buyer’s remorse. Here’s a new one for you — 
seller’s remorse. If you’re selling your velvet Elvis footstool because your spouse 
said, “It’s me or that footstool!” and then decide that your spouse should have 
known how much you revered the King when you went to Graceland on your 
honeymoon, you can end the listing. Read “Try canceling bids first” and “If all 
else fails, end your auction early,” later in this chapter.
Auction Going Badly? Cut Your Losses
So your auction is cruising along just fine for a couple of days when you 
notice that the same eBay user who didn’t pay on a previous auction is your 
current high bidder. You don’t want to get burned again, do you? Of course 
not; cancel this deadbeat’s bid before it’s too late. Although canceling bids — 
or, for that matter, entire auctions — isn’t easy (you have a load of explaining 
to do, pardner), eBay does allow it.
If you feel you have to wash your hands of a listing that’s given you nothing 
but grief, it doesn’t mean you have to lose money on the deal. Read on to 
find out the protocol for dumping untrustworthy bidders or (as a last resort) 
laying a bad auction to rest and beginning anew.
 
Many of these functions are also available from the drop-down menus on the 
right side of the item’s listing on the My eBay Selling page.
Try canceling bids first
Face the facts: This auction is fast becoming a big-time loser. You did your 
very best, and things didn’t work out. Before you kill an auction completely, 
see whether you can improve it by canceling bids first. Canceling a bid 
removes a bidder from your auction, but the auction continues running.
When you cancel a bid, you need to provide an explanation, which goes on 
record for all to see. You may have a million reasons for thinking your auc-
tion is a bust, but eBay says your explanation had better be good. Here are 
some eBay-approved reasons for canceling a bid (or even an entire auction):
 
✓ The high bidder informs you that he or she is retracting the bid.
 
✓ Despite your best efforts to determine who your high bidder is, you 
can’t find out — and you get no response to your e-mails or phone calls.

260
Part III: Making Money the eBay Way 
 
✓ The bidder makes a dollar-amount mistake in the bid. (The bidder bids 
$100.00 instead of $10.00, for example.)
 
✓ You decide midauction that you can’t sell your item due to the fact that 
it was sold in an outside venue — or the dog ate it. (You must cancel all 
bids and end the listing in this instance.)
 
I can’t drive this point home hard enough: Explain why you’re canceling a bid, 
and your explanation had better be good. You can cancel any bid for any reason 
you want, but if you can’t give a good explanation of why you did it, you will 
be sorry. Citing past transaction problems with the current high bidder is 
okay, but canceling a bidder who lives in Japan because you don’t feel like 
shipping overseas after you said you’d ship internationally could give your 
feedback history the aroma of week-old sushi.
To cancel a bid (starting from most eBay pages), do the following:
 
1. Go to the listing page.
 
2. Click the Bid History link.
 
 You’re taken to the Bid History page.
 
3. Scroll to the bottom of the bidding history and click the Cancel Bids 
link.
 
 You’ll be brought to a page outlining eBay’s policies on bidding.
 
4. Scroll down to the Canceling Bids area and click the Canceling Bids 
link.
 
 You arrive at the Canceling bids page, as shown in Figure 13-5.
 
Figure 13-5: 
Use this 
form to 
remove a 
bidder from 
one of your 
auctions.
 
 
5. Type the item number, the user ID for the bid you’re canceling, and 
the reason for canceling the bid.

261
 Chapter 13: Troubleshooting Transactions
 
6. Click the Cancel Bid button.
 
 Be sure that you really want to cancel a bid before you click the Cancel 
Bid button. Canceled bids can never be reinstated.
Canceling bids means you removed an individual bidder (or several bidders) 
from your auction, but the auction itself continues running. If you want to 
end the auction completely, read on.
Blocking bidders
If you have a bidder who just doesn’t get the message and continually bids on 
your auctions despite the fact that you’ve e-mailed and told him or her not 
to, you can block the bidder from ever participating in your auctions. You 
can create a list of bidders to prevent them from bidding temporarily or per-
manently, and you can edit the list at any time. You can find the page from 
the same page as described in the preceding section. Click Block Bidders and 
then create your list. Alternatively, you can go directly to this address:
pages.ebay.com/services/buyandsell/biddermanagement.html
If all else fails, end your listing early
If you put your auction up for a week and the next day your boss says you 
have to go to China for a month or your landlord says you have to move out 
immediately so that he can fumigate for a week, you can end your auction 
early. But ending an auction early isn’t a decision to be taken lightly. You 
miss all the last-minute bidding action.
 
eBay makes it clear that ending your auction early does not relieve you of the 
obligation to sell this item to the highest bidder. To relieve your obligation, 
you must first cancel all the bids and then end the auction. Of course, if no 
one has bid, you have nothing to worry about.
When you cancel an auction, you have to write a short explanation (no more 
than 80 characters) that appears on the bidding history section of your auc-
tion page. Anyone who bid on the item may e-mail you for a written explana-
tion. If bidders think your explanation doesn’t hold water, don’t be surprised 
if you get some nasty e-mail.
 
Bidding on your own item is against the rules. Once upon a time, you could 
cancel an auction by outbidding everyone on your own item and then ending 
the auction. But some eBay users abused this privilege by bidding on their 
own items merely to boost the sales price. Shame on them.

262
Part III: Making Money the eBay Way 
To end an auction early, go to your My eBay Active Selling page and in the 
drop-down menu next to the listing, choose End Item. You will be required to 
sign in again. Then follow these steps:
 
1. Click the appropriate link: either Cancel Bids and End Listing Early or 
Sell Item to High Bidder and End Listing Early.
 
2. On the next page, select a reason for ending your listing.
 
3. Click the End Your Listing button.
 
 An Ended Listing page appears, and eBay sends an End of Listing 
Confirmation e-mail to you and to the highest bidder.
 
If you know when you list the item that you’ll be away when an auction ends, 
in your item description let potential bidders know when you plan to contact 
them. Bidders who are willing to wait will still be willing to bid. Alerting them 
to your absence can save you from losing money if you have to cut your auc-
tion short.
Filing for a final value fee credit
If closing a successful auction is the thrill of victory, finding out that your 
buyer is a nonpaying bidder, or deadbeat, is the agony of defeat. Adding 
insult to injury, eBay still charges you a final value fee even if the high bidder 
never sends you a cent. But you can do something about it. You can file for a 
final value fee credit.
To qualify for a final value fee credit, you must prove to eBay that one of the 
following events occurred:
 
✓ The winning buyer never responded after numerous e-mail contacts.
 
✓ The winning buyer backed out of the sale.
 
✓ The winning buyer’s payment did not clear or was never received.
 
✓ The winning buyer returned the item to you, and you refunded the 
payment.
 
If both you and the buyer decide that it’s okay not to go through with the 
transaction, that’s okay with eBay, too. eBay will allow you to get back your 
final value fee by going through the refund process. You’ll find an option in 
the Reason for Refund area that will absolve the buyer of any wrongdoing with 
eBay’s Unpaid Item police.

263
 Chapter 13: Troubleshooting Transactions
The instant you file for a Non-Paying Bidder Alert credit, eBay shoots off an 
e-mail to the winner of your item (copying you on the e-mail) and warns the 
eBay user of their nonpaying status.
If at least 7 days and no more than 45 days have elapsed since the end of the 
auction, you can apply for a full final fee credit. First, however, you must file 
an Unpaid Item Alert:
 
1. Go to your My eBay Sold view.
 
 Find the transaction in question on the list of sold items.
 
2. Click the drop-down menu at the right of the listing and then choose 
Resolve a Problem.
 
 You’re taken to the Resolution Center.
 
3. Select the I Sold an Item and Haven’t Received My Payment Yet option 
and click Continue.
 
4. Sign in to your account and enter your user ID and password.
 
 The Report an Unpaid Item Case form appears.
 
5. Type the item number of the listing in question (if it’s not already 
there) and then click the Continue button.
 
6. You’ll be asked to select an issue from a drop-down menu that applies 
to your situation. Once you do, click Continue.
 
7. Review everything you’ve entered to be sure it’s correct, and then 
click Continue.
 
 If you and the buyer mutually agreed not to complete the transaction, 
when you click Continue, you see the Final Value Fee Credit request page.
 
After three nonpayment warnings, eBay can boot a deadbeat from the site.
You and your nonpaying buyer now have ten days to work out your prob-
lems. If you make no progress after seven days, you may file for your final 
value fee credit.
 
You need to wait at least seven days after the auction ends to file an Unpaid 
Item Alert and then seven days before you can apply for a final value fee 
credit. I think it’s jumping the gun to label someone a nonpaying bidder after 
only seven days — try to contact the bidder again unless the bidder sends you 
a message about backing out (or you have good cause to believe you have a 
deadbeat on your hands). If you still want to file for your final value fee credit 
after seven days, do the following:

264

1. On your My eBay page, hover your cursor over the Account tab. When 
the drop-down menu appears, choose Resolution Center.
 
 You’re taken to the Resolution Center.
 
2. Under the Your Cases heading, find the transaction in question.
 
3. Click the View Dispute link under the status column.
 
 You’re now in the area where you may respond to any comments the 
buyer has left regarding why he or she hasn’t yet paid for your item.
 
4. Enter your response (if any) to the buyer in the messages area and 
click Submit Response or to get your final value fee refund, click Close 
Dispute.
 
5. Click the Close Dispute button on the bottom of the page.
 
 You’re taken to the Credit Request Process Completed page, which con-
firms that your refund is being processed by eBay, as shown in Figure 13-6.

When your listing ends, you have up to 45 days after the auction closes 
to request a credit. After 45 days, kiss your refund goodbye; eBay won’t 
process it.
 
Anyone caught applying for a refund on a successful item transaction can be 
suspended or something worse — after all, this is a clear-cut case of fraud.

265
 Chapter 13: Troubleshooting Transactions
If you want to verify eBay’s accounting, grab your calculator and use Table 9-2 
in Chapter 9 to check the math. (Why couldn’t I have had one of those in high-
school algebra class?)
 
Always print a copy of any refund and credit requests you make. This paper 
trail can help bail you out later if eBay asks for documentation.
Déjà vu — relisting your item
Despite all your best efforts, sometimes your auction ends with no bids or 
bids that are not even close to your reserve price. Or maybe a buyer won 
your item, but the transaction didn’t go through. eBay takes pity on you and 
offers you the chance to pick yourself up, dust yourself off, and start all over 
again.
The best way to improve your chances of selling a relisted item is by making 
changes to the listing. eBay says the majority of the items put up for auction 
should sell. If you sell your item the second time around (in most cases), 
eBay rewards you with a refund of your insertion fee. You receive your 
refund after at least one billing cycle. Accept this refund as a reward for 
learning the ropes.
 
In the case of an unpaid item, you may (only in this situation) qualify for an 
insertion fee credit by relisting the item. If the item sells the second time, eBay 
will refund the insertion fee for relisting.
You must only use eBay’s Relist feature to receive the credit. Once the item 
is filed as a unpaid, you can use the Relist link on the unpaid item page or do 
the following:
 
1. Go to your My eBay page.
 
2. On the left side of the page in the Selling area, click the Sold link.
 
 You arrive at the page without Sold Listings. You will be able to find the 
unpaid item because it’s specially marked. See Figure 13-7 for an example.
 
3. Click the Relist link from the drop-down menu next to the unpaid 
item.

Figure 13-7: 
Finding your 
unpaid item 
for relisting 
on the Sold 
items page 
(note I have 
already 
relisted this 
item). 
To be eligible for a refund of your insertion fee, here’s the scoop:
 
✓ You must relist no more than 90 days after closing the original auction.
 
✓ You can get credit only if you got no bids in your original auction or if 
the bids you got did not equal the reserve in your reserve-price auction.
 
✓ You can change anything about your auction item description, price, 
duration, and minimum price, but you can’t sell a different item.
 
✓ If you set a reserve price in your original auction, you must set the same 
reserve, lower it, or cancel the reserve altogether. If you set a higher 
price or add a reserve, you’re not eligible for a relisting credit.
 
eBay’s generosity has exceptions. It doesn’t offer refunds for any listing 
options you paid for, such as the use of Featured Plus! or bold lettering. 
But is she a natural blonde?
Here’s an example of an item that would have 
made the seller a bundle if he or she had per-
formed a little more strategizing up front:
Platinum Mackie Barbie: Beautiful Platinum 
Bob Mackie Barbie. MIB (removed from box 
once only to scan). The doll comes with shoes, 
stand, booklet, and Mackie drawing. The 
original plastic protects her hair and earrings. 
Buyer adds $10.00 for shipping and insurance. 
Payment must be made within 10 days of auc-
tion by MO or cashier’s check only.
The starting price was $9.99, and even though 
the bidding went to $256.00, the seller’s reserve 
price was not met, and the item didn’t sell. And 
the Second Chance offer didn’t bite.
When relisting this item, the seller should lower 
the reserve price and add much more to the 
description about the importance and rarity of 
the doll (unless, of course, $256.00 was far below 
what the seller wanted to make on the doll). 
Offering to accept credit cards through PayPal 
would have also helped to make the sale.

267
 Chapter 13: Troubleshooting Transactions
Also, fixed-price and store listings aren’t covered by this offer. And if you 
have a deadbeat on your hands, you can relist, but you don’t get a return of 
your insertion fee. More bad news: If you don’t sell the item the second time 
around, you’re stuck paying two insertion fees. So work a little harder this time 
and give it your best shot!
If your item doesn’t sell after two tries, you need to take a different tack. If 
you want to be eligible for a new insertion fee refund (once your item hasn’t 
sold twice in a row), you must use the Sell Similar option. This sets up the 
item in a new cycle for eBay. To get your third shot at selling, do the follow-
ing (from the Unsold section of your My eBay Selling page):
 
1. Click the drop-down menu next to auction item that you want to relist 
and choose Sell Similar.
 
 You’re taken to the original listing form with all the information filled in.
 
2. Make your changes to the auction (I hope major ones as mentioned 
further on), launch it, and pray!
 
The more specific your item title, the more you improve your odds of being 
profitable. If you’re selling an old Monopoly game, don’t just title it Old 
Monopoly board game; call it Rare 1959 Monopoly Game Complete in Box. 
For more information about listing items, see Chapter 10.
Here’s a list of ideas that you can use to improve your auction’s odds for 
success:
 
✓ Change the item category. See if the item sold better in another cat-
egory (see Chapter 3).
 
✓ Add a picture. If two identical items are up for auction at the same time, 
the item with a photo gets more and higher bids. Zoom in on Chapter 14.
 
✓ Spruce up the title and description. Make it enticing and grab those 
search engines. Breeze on over to Chapter 10.
 
✓ Set a lower minimum bid. The first bidders will think they’re getting a 
bargain, and others will want a hot item. Mosey on over to Chapter 10.
 
✓ Set a lower reserve price or cancel the reserve. A reserve price often 
scares away bidders who fear it’s too high. See (yup) Chapter 10 for 
ways to make your reserve more palatable to prospective bidders.
 
✓ Change the duration of the auction. Maybe you need some more time. 
Go to (you guessed it) Chapter 10.
 
Long-time eBay veterans say that reducing or canceling your reserve price 
makes an auction very attractive to buyers.

Y
ou may be enjoying most of what eBay has to offer, and you’re probably 
having some good buying adventures. If you’re selling, you’re experienc-
ing the excitement of making money. But there’s more. Welcome to eBay, the 
advanced class.
In this chapter, you go to the head of the class by discovering some insider 
tips on how to enhance your auctions with images and spiffy text. Successful 
eBay vendors know that pictures (also called images) really help sell items. 
This chapter gives you the basics on how to create great images. I also give 
you advice on linking pictures to your auctions so that buyers around the 
world can view them.
Using Images in Your Auctions
Would you buy an item you couldn’t see? Most people won’t, especially if 
they’re interested in purchasing items that they want to display or clothes they 
intend to wear. Without a picture, you can’t tell whether a seller’s idea of good 
quality is anything like yours — or if the item is exactly what you’re looking for.
Welcome to the cyberworld of imaging, where pictures are called not pic-
tures but images, and your monitor isn’t a monitor but a display. With a 
digital camera or a scanner and software, you can manipulate your images — 
spin, crop, and color-correct — so that they grab viewers by the lapels. Even

cooler: When you’re happy with your creation, you can add it to your eBay 
auction for others to see.
Sellers, take heed and read these other reasons why you should use your 
own well-made digital images in your auction pages:
 
✓ If you don’t have a picture, potential bidders may wonder whether 
you’re deliberately hiding the item from view because you know some-
thing is wrong with it. Paranoid? Maybe. Practical? You bet.
 
✓ Fickle bidders don’t even bother reading an item description if they 
can’t see the item. Maybe they were traumatized in English class.
 
✓ Taking your own pictures shows that you actually have the item in your 
possession. Many scam artists take images from a manufacturer’s Web 
site to illustrate their bogus sales on eBay. Why risk being suspect? Snap

✓ Everyone’s doing it. I hate to pressure you, but digital images are the 
custom for sellers on eBay, so if you’re not using them, you’re not reach-
ing the widest possible number of people who would bid on your item. 
From that point of view, you’re not doing the most you can to serve your 
potential customers’ needs. Hey, fads are driven by conformity. You may 
as well use them to your advantage.
So which is better for capturing images: digital cameras or digital scanners? 
As with all gadgets, here’s the classic answer: It depends. For my money, it’s 
hard to beat a digital camera. But before you go snag one, decide what kind 
of investment (and how big) you plan to make in your eBay auctions.
 
If you buy a digital SLR, be sure to check with a camera store to see if older, 
traditional lenses can be used on the camera you buy. It’s often the case with 
the major brands, although digital lenses don’t have to be as “good” as the 
old lenses were — due to all the electronic manipulation that goes on inside 
the new cameras. Next, go to eBay and see what kind of deals you can find on 
compatible lenses.
 
Whether you buy new or used digital equipment on eBay, make sure it comes 
with a warranty. If you don’t get a warranty, Murphy’s Law practically ensures 
that your digital equipment will break the second time you use it.
Choosing a digital camera
If price isn’t a factor, you should buy the highest-quality digital camera you 
can afford, especially if you plan to use images for items that vary in size 
and shape. By highest-quality, I don’t necessarily mean a camera with vast 
amounts of megapixels; I mean a camera from a quality manufacturer that 
has a high optical zoom and has a good (nonplastic) lens.

271
 Chapter 14: Increase Your Profits with Pictures and Other Strategies
Sony, Canon, Kodak, and Nikon all make good basic digital cameras. You can 
find them for about $150.00 (easily found on eBay for even less). Middle-of-
the-road new (and quality used) digital cameras sell for between $100.00 and 
$75.00. Compare prices at computer stores and on the Web.
A great place to buy digital cameras is (surprise!) eBay. Just do a search of 
some popular manufacturers, such as Canon, Kodak, Sony, and Nikon, and 
you will find pages of listings of both new and used digital cameras.
When shopping for a digital camera, look at the following features:
 
✓ Resolution: Look for a camera that has a resolution of at least 800×600 
pixels. This isn’t hard to find because new cameras tout their strength in 
megapixels (millions of pixels). You don’t need that high a resolution for 
eBay because your pictures will ultimately be shown on a 72 dpi moni-
tor, not printed on paper. A pixel is a tiny dot of information that, when 
grouped with other pixels, forms an image. The more pixels an image 
has, the clearer and sharper the image is; the more memory the image 
scarfs up, the slower it shows up on-screen. An 800-by-600-pixel resolu-
tion may seem paltry next to the 6-million-pixel punch of a high-end 
digital camera, but trust me: No one bidding on your auctions will ever 
know the difference. And the picture will load a lot faster.
 
✓ Optical zoom: Here’s where the camera manufacturers try to pull the 
wool over the consumer’s eyes. They sell cameras with an optical and 
a digital zoom. The optical zoom is a true zoom done by the camera, 
the lens, and its built in CCD (computer chip in cameras that converts 
How I’ve been shooting on eBay
I’ve been on eBay since 1996, so I’ve taken 
lots of pictures to promote my online sales. I’m 
pretty happy with the quality of most of my own 
images. When I’ve sold paper ephemera, I usu-
ally just lay the item on a scanner — and scan 
away. It’s the best way to get a good image 
of that type of item. I started early on with an 
Olympus camera, but quickly changed to the 
Sony Mavica FD-73. The FD-73 was one of the 
first that had a 10X digital zoom, which helps 
with intricate close-ups.
Then I upgraded to a used FD-92 with an 8X opti-
cal zoom (a newer model that added a memory 
stick). And a few years ago I purchased a Sony 
DSC-H1 — a fancy 5-megapixel camera with 
a 12X zoom. To be perfectly honest, it’s way 
too much camera for my eBay photo shoots. 
But I like the size — I find my teeny purse-size 
camera gets lost in my office and I can’t find 
it when I want to take pictures! One excellent 
improvement on my new camera is the addition 
of image stabilization — it holds the camera 
steady when I zoom in for ultra macro close-
ups. If you’ve ever taken a picture fully zoomed, 
you know that the slightest breath can make the 
resulting image blurry. In the long run, a nice 
balance between new technological gadgets 
and familiar, easy-to-use equipment is the way 
to go.

272
Part III: Making Money the eBay Way 
light into electronic data) — but a digital zoom is virtual; it’s interpolated 
through software in the camera. That means it makes up data to fill in 
any holes it doesn’t capture. You’ve seen this effect if you’ve ever tried to 
enlarge a picture from the Web in a software program — it gets all blurry.
 
 If you ever plan on shooting close-ups, look for a high quality optical 
zoom.
 
✓ Storage type: Smart card? Secure Digital Card? Mini SD card? CompactFlash 
card? Memory stick? (Whew.) The instructions that come with your camera 
explain how to transfer images from your media type to your computer. (No 
instructions? Check the manufacturer’s Web site.) Most newer computers 
have ports into which you can insert your camera’s memory card; the com-
puter reads the card like it’s a teeny, tiny disk drive.
 
 A versatile way to get the best images of items that require extreme 
close-ups (such as jewelry, stamps, currency, coins) is to use a super 
invention called a Cloud Dome. When photographing complex items, 
no matter how good your camera is, you may find it difficult to capture 
the item cleanly and exactly (especially the colors and brightness of 
gems and metals). Your camera mounts to the top of this Cloud Dome, 
and pictures are taken inside the translucent plastic dome. The dome 
diffuses the light over the entire surface of the object to reveal all its 
intricate details. You can purchase Cloud Domes on eBay or from the 
manufacturer’s Web site at www.clouddome.com. Even in black and 
white, you can see the difference that a cloud dome can make when 
taking pictures of jewelry, as shown Figure 14-1.

Choosing a scanner
If you plan to sell flat items such as autographs, stamps, books, or 
documents — or if you need a good piece of business equipment that can 
double as a photocopier — consider getting a digital scanner. You can pick 
up a brand new one for a under $100.00 (you can find scanners on eBay).

273
 Chapter 14: Increase Your Profits with Pictures and Other Strategies
Here’s what you need to look for when you buy a scanner:
 
✓ Resolution: As with printers and photocopiers, the resolution of digital 
scanning equipment is measured in dots per inch (dpi). The more dpi, 
the greater the resolution.
 
 Some scanners can provide resolutions as high as 12,800 dpi, which 
looks awesome when you print the image, but to dress up your eBay 
auctions, all you need is (are you ready?) 72 dpi (dots or pixels per 
inch)! That’s it. Your images will look great and won’t take up much 
storage space on your computer’s hard drive. Basic scanners can scan 
images at resolutions of up to 1,200 dpi, so even they are far more pow-
erful than you need for your eBay images.
 
✓ Flatbed: If you’re planning to use your scanner to scan pictures of 
documents (or even items in boxes), a flatbed scanner is your best bet. 
Flatbeds work just like photocopiers. You simply lay your item or box on 
the glass and scan away.
Making Your Picture a Thing of Beauty
The idea behind using images in your auctions is to attract tons of potential 
buyers. With that goal in mind, you should try to create the best-looking images 
possible, no matter what kind of technology you’re using to capture them.
Get it on camera
Point-and-shoot may be okay for a group shot at some historical monument, 
but illustrating your auction is a whole different idea. Whether you’re using a 
traditional film camera (so you can scan your developed photographs later) 
or a digital camera to capture your item, some basic photographic guidelines 
can give you better results.
Don’t forget your camcorder!
The majority of eBay users use either a digi-
tal camera or scanner to dress up their auc-
tions with images, but some just use what they 
already own: their handy-dandy camcorders! 
Yup, after videotaping your day at the beach, 
point your lens at that Victorian doll and shoot. 
With the help of a video-capturing device, you 
can create a still digital image right from the 
camera.

274
Part III: Making Money the eBay Way 
For more on using scanners, zoom ahead to the next section, “Use traditional 
photos? Yes, I scan.” Then c’mon back to these do’s and don’ts to ensure that 
your digital image is a genuine enhancement to your auction:
 
✓ Do take the picture of your item outside, in daylight, whenever possible. 
That way the camera can catch all possible details and color.
 
✓ Do forget about fancy backgrounds; they distract viewers from your 
item. Put small items on a neutral-colored, nonreflective towel or cloth; 
put larger items in front of a neutral-colored wall or curtain. You’ll cut 
out almost all the background when you prepare the picture on your 
computer. (This chapter explains how to prepare your picture.)
 
✓ Do use extra lighting. You can do this with your camera’s flash mode or 
with extra photo lighting on stands. Use extra lighting even when you’re 
taking the picture outside. The extra lighting acts as fill light — it adds 
more light to the item, filling in some of the shadowed spots.
 
✓ Don’t get so close to the item that the additional light washes out (over-
exposes) the image. The easiest way to figure out the best distance is 
by trial and error. Start close and keep moving farther away until you 
get the results you want. This method can get pricey if you use film, but 
that’s where digital cameras really shine: You can see the picture sec-
onds after you shoot it, keep it and modify it, erase it, and start again.
 
✓ Do take two or three acceptable versions of your image; you can choose 
the best one later on your computer.
 
✓ Don’t use incandescent or fluorescent lighting to illuminate the photos 
you plan to scan. Incandescent lighting tends to make items look yellow-
ish, and fluorescent lights lend a bluish tone to your photos. Some sell-
ers use GE Reveal incandescent bulbs; they throw a good-quality light 
which, when combined with natural daylight, produces an even tone. My 
favorites are the 5,000 degrees Kelvin full-spectrum bulbs. Yes, at $20.00 
apiece they’re very expensive, but with a 10,000-hour lifespan, they 
should have you taking pictures into the next decade. (Hint: you can 
find 5,000 Kelvin portable lamps on eBay for just a little more.)
 
✓ If your item relies on detail (for example, an engraved signature or 
detailed gold trim), do take a wide shot of the entire item — and then take 
a tight close-up or two of the detailed areas that you want buyers to see.
 
✓ Do make sure that you focus the camera; nothing is worse than a blurry 
picture. If your camera is a fixed-focus model (it can’t be adjusted), get 
only as close as the manufacturer recommends. If you go beyond that 
distance, the item appears out of focus. (Automatic-focus cameras mea-
sure the distance and change the lens setting as needed.)
 
Taking pictures of your item from different angles gives the prospective buyer 
more information. When you have several images, use your photo-editing pro-
gram to put them in one composite image, as shown in Figure 14-2.

Some eBay creeps, whether out of laziness or deceit, steal images from other 
eBay members. (They simply make a digital copy of the image and use it in 
their own auctions. This is so uncool because then the copied image doesn’t 
represent the actual item being sold.) This pilfering has happened to me on 
several occasions. To prevent picture-snatching, you can watermark your user 
ID to all your photos. Then, the next time somebody lifts one of your pictures, 
it has your name on it. Don’t forget to report these tools by using the Report 
Item link at the bottom of their listing — stealing photos is against eBay rules!
Use traditional photos? Yes, I scan
If you use a scanner and traditional (that is, nondigital) camera to create 
images for your eBay auction, you’ve come to the right place. (Also check out 
the tips in the preceding section.) If the photo processor will create digital 
images for you, be sure you get that done. It will save you lots of time in scan-
ning. If that’s not possible:
 
✓ Have the photo developer print your photos on glossy paper; it scans 
best.
 
✓ When you take traditional photos for scanning, get as close to your item 
as your camera allows. Enlarging photos in the scanner will only result 
in blurry (or, worse, jagged) images.
 
✓ Scan the box that the item came in, or if there’s a photo of the item on 
the box, scan that portion of the box.

276
Part III: Making Money the eBay Way 
 
✓ If you’re scanning a three-dimensional item (such as a doll, jewelry item, 
or box) and you can’t close the scanner lid, drape a black or white T-shirt 
over the item after you place it on the scanner’s glass plate; that way you 
get a clean background and good light reflection from the scanner.
 
✓ If you want to scan an item that’s too big to put on your scanner all at 
once, scan the item in sections and assemble the digital pieces with your 
image-editing software. The instructions that come with your software 
should explain how to do this.
Software that adds the artist’s touch
After you take the picture (or scan it) and transfer it into your computer 
according to the manufacturer’s instructions, the next step is to edit the 
picture. Much like a book or magazine editor, you get to cut, fix, resize, and 
reshape your picture until you think it’s good enough to be seen by the 
public. If you’re a non-techie type, don’t get nervous; many of the programs 
have one-button magical corrections that make your pictures look great.
The software program that comes with your digital camera or scanner puts at 
your disposal an arsenal of editing tools that help you turn a basic image of 
your item into something special. Although each program has its own collec-
tion of features, a few basic tools and techniques are common to all:
 
✓ Image quality: Enables you to enhance or correct colors, sharpen images, 
remove dust spots, and increase or reduce brightness or contrast.
 
✓ Size: Reduces or increases the size or shape of the image.
 
✓ Orientation: Rotates the image left or right; flips it horizontally or 
vertically.
 
✓ Crop: Trims your picture to show the item, rather than extraneous 
background.
 
✓ Create an image format: Gives your edited picture a specific format, 
such as .JPG, .GIF, or others when you save it. The best format for put-
ting photos on the Web (and thus the preferred format on eBay and the 
one I strongly recommend) is .JPG (pronounced “JAY-peg”).
 
Every image-editing software program has its own system requirements and 
capabilities. Study the software that comes with your camera or scanner. If 
you feel the program is too complicated (or doesn’t give you the editing tools 
you need), investigate some of the other popular programs. A simple-to-use 
program called Fast Photos was developed by an eBay seller with us in mind. 
It’s incredibly simple to use, and the learning curve is small. I use it and love 
its simplicity and speed — and it costs only $24.95 (you can get a free 21-day 
trial at www.pixby.com/marshacollier).

277
 Chapter 14: Increase Your Profits with Pictures and Other Strategies
 
Copying someone else’s auction text or images without permission can con-
stitute copyright infringement, which ends your auction and could get you 
suspended from eBay.
Making Your Images Web-Friendly
Because digital images are made up of pixels — and every pixel has a set 
of instructions that has to be stored someplace — you have two difficulties 
facing you right after you take the picture:
 
✓ Digital images contain computer instructions, so bigger pictures take up 
more memory.
 
✓ Very large digital images take longer to build (appear) on the buyer’s 
screen, and time can be precious in an auction.
To get around both these problems, think small. Here’s a checklist of tried-
and-true techniques for preparing your elegantly slender, fast-loading images 
to display on eBay:
 
✓ Set your image resolution at 72 pixels per inch. You can do this with 
the settings for your scanner. Although 72 ppi may seem like a low reso-
lution, it only nibbles computer memory (instead of chomping), shows 
up fast on a buyer’s screen, and looks great on eBay.
 
✓ When using a digital camera, set the camera to no higher than the 
800×600 format. That’s custom-made for a monitor. You can always 
crop the picture if it’s too large. You can even save the image at 640×480, 
and it’ll display well on eBay — but it will take up less space, and you 
can add more pictures!
 
✓ Make the finished image no larger than 480 pixels wide. When you 
size your picture in your image software, it’s best to keep it no larger 
than 300×300 pixels or 4 inches square, even if it’s a snapshot of a clas-
sic 4×4 monster truck. These dimensions are big enough for people to 
see without squinting, and the details of your item show up nicely.
 
✓ Crop any unnecessary areas of the photo. You need to show your item 
only; everything else is a waste.
 
✓ Use your software to darken or change the photo’s contrast. When the 
image looks good on your computer screen, the image looks good on 
your eBay auction page.
 
✓ Save your image as a .JPG file. When you finish editing your picture, 
save it as a .JPG. (To do this, follow the instructions that come with your 

278
Part III: Making Money the eBay Way 
software.) .JPG is the best format for eBay; it compresses information 
into a small file that builds fast and reproduces nicely on the Internet.
 
✓ Check the total size of your image. After you save the image, check 
its total size. If the size hovers around 40K (kilobytes) or smaller, eBay 
users won’t have a hard time seeing the image in a reasonable amount of 
time.
 
✓ Reduce the size of your image if it’s larger than 50K. Small is fast, effi-
cient, and beautiful. Big is slow, sluggish, and dangerous. Impatient eBay 
users will move on to the next listing if they have to wait to see your 
image.
The Image Is Perfect — Now What?
Now that your masterpiece is complete, you want to emblazon it on your 
auction for all the world to see. When most people first get the urge to dazzle 
prospective buyers with a picture, they poke around the eBay site looking for 
a place to put it. Trade secret: You’re not actually putting pictures on eBay; 
you’re telling eBay’s servers where to find your picture so that, like a good 
hunting dog, your auction points the buyers’ browsers to the exact corner of 
the virtual universe where your picture is. That’s why the picture has to load 
fast — it’s coming in from a different location. (Yeah, it confused me in the 
beginning too, but now it makes perfect sense. Uh-huh. Sure.)
To help eBay find your image, all you have to do is type its address in the 
Picture URL box of the Sell Your Item form — so don’t forget to write down 
the Web address (URL) of your image.
If you use eBay’s Picture Services, your photo will be on eBay’s servers and 
will upload once, directly from your computer. I talk more about that in just a 
minute.
 
You can highlight your image’s URL with your cursor, right-click your mouse, 
and copy it to your computer’s clipboard. Then go to the auction page you’re 
filling out on eBay, put your cursor in the Picture URL box, and paste the 
address into the box.
A typical address (for someone using AOL) looks something like this:
members.aol.com/ebay4dummy/rolexwatch.jpg
Because your image needs an address, you have to find it a good home 
online. You have several options:

279
 Chapter 14: Increase Your Profits with Pictures and Other Strategies
 
✓ Your ISP (Internet service provider): All the big ISPs — AOL, Comcast, 
Road Runner, and Earthlink — give you space to store your Internet 
stuff. You’re already paying for an ISP, so you can park pictures there 
at no extra charge.
 
✓ An image-hosting Web site: Web sites that specialize in hosting pictures 
are popping up all over the Internet. Some charge a small fee; others are 
free. The upside here is that they’re easy to use.
 
✓ Your server: If you have your own server (those of you who do know 
who you are), you can store those images right in your own home.
 
✓ eBay Picture Services: You can find out about using eBay’s photo-hosting 
service later in this chapter.
Using an ISP to store your images
Every ISP has its own rules and procedures. Go to the help area of your 
ISP for directions on how to access your personal area (no, I’m not getting 
naughty — those are authentic computerese phrases!) and how to upload 
your images.
 
After you’ve uploaded your images to your ISP, get the Web address of your 
item’s location and type it in the Picture URL box of eBay’s Sell Your Item 
page. Now the picture appears within the item description whenever someone 
views your auction page. Figure 14-3 shows you an auction description with a 
picture.

Using image-hosting Web sites
to store images
Okay, realistically, many people are combing cyberspace looking for the next 
great thing. eBay’s success has entrepreneurs all over the globe coming up 
with different kinds of auction-support businesses. As usual, a lot of junk 
pops up on the Internet in the wake of such trends — but a promising devel-
opment caught my attention — image-hosting Web sites.
Image-hosting Web sites have changed from one-stop shops to mega-markets 
loaded with tons of services for your auctions. Some image-hosting sites let 
you post your pictures without requiring you to use their auction-management 
software. Not that I think such software is a bad thing — it’s great! — I just like 
to choose what I use. (Flip to Chapter 20 for more about auction-management 
software.)
Here are a few convenient image-hosting sites that allow you to post a few of 
your images for free:
 
✓ Auctiva (www.Auctiva.com)
 
✓ FreePictureHosting.com (www.freepicturehosting.com)
  
✓ ImageShack (www.imageshack.com)
 
✓ Photobucket (www.photobucket.com)
Using eBay’s Picture Services
eBay hosts a single image per auction for free. Additional pictures cost only 
$0.15. (You can have a maximum of 12 images per auction item.)
If you use this service, your photos appear on your auction in a predesigned 
template. If you use more than one photo, the first photo shows up in a
400-×-300-pixel format. A miniature of the first image appears to the left of the 
larger image. The prospective bidder clicks the smaller picture, and it magi-
cally appears in the larger photo area.
When you prepare to list an item for auction, a page appears, and you’re 
asked whether you’d like to use the photo service. If you don’t want to use it, 
click the Your Own Web Hosting tab and input the URL of your picture. If you 
do want to use the service, follow the directions on-screen.

281
 Chapter 14: Increase Your Profits with Pictures and Other Strategies
To post your photo, click the box, and an Open File dialog box appears. 
Find your image on your computer and click Open, and the image magically 
appears in the image box. Add more pictures if you want and click Submit 
Pictures and Continue. Figure 14-4 shows the upload page — which is where 
you upload your image from the Sell Your Item page. (If your upload on the 
Sell Your Item page doesn’t look like Figure 14-4, click the link shown on the 
right to go to Full Featured.)
 
Figure 14-4: 
Click Add 
Pictures and 
you’re on 
your way.
 
Here are a few things to keep in mind:
 
✓ eBay keeps an image online for the duration of your listing and for up to 
90 days (as long as you have the link available to access the page). After 
that, the image disappears (unless you relist the same auction).
Perfecting your picture in LunaPic
You need to know that I am lazy — sometimes 
I don’t even want to open a program. When it 
comes to editing my images for eBay, I’m still 
looking for a magic wand. So I browsed the 
Internet and found a free online photo-editing 
Web site, www.lunapic.com.
Although I prefer to use a program on my com-
puter, LunaPic works great for quick, on-the-
fly editing that I often need. You can even edit 
pictures on someone else’s computer because 
there’s no need to install software. It’s a Web 
site that makes photo editing as easy as getting 
a burger at the drive-through window. Register 
on the site, and you have full photo-editing 
capabilities. Upload photos from your computer 
(or webcam) to the site, perform your touch-up, 
and then save and download! LunaPic has a 
full-featured toolset on the site; in it, you find 
tools to adjust brightness, contrast, color, and 
sharpness.

✓ You can always post the image again if you need it later; be sure to leave 
a copy of the image on your computer.
 
✓ This feature doesn’t support the MSN TV platform.
eBay’s Gallery
Any discussion of images on eBay would be incomplete without a short dis-
cussion of eBay’s Gallery pictures. Gallery pictures are the small pictures you 
see next to items in category listings or in your searches. It’s obvious that 
using eBay’s Gallery option draws more attention to your sales, but have you 
ever noticed that not all Gallery images show up crisp and clear? And that 
some are smaller than others? It’s not by chance; eBay reduces the image 
you uploaded for the Gallery.
The technology that allows eBay’s Picture Services to do its magic resizes the 
seller’s picture to fit the allotted space. In the case of the Gallery, a consider-
able amount of compression is applied to your image. The more compression 
applied, the fuzzier and more distorted your image gets.
When you use your own photo hosting on eBay, you can use a different photo 
for your Gallery image. Either use a different picture or reduce your main 
image to a tiny 110 x 120 pixels. If you reduce the picture yourself, you’ll 
notice a big improvement in the way the Gallery picture looks.
Multiple pictures in your descriptions
Here’s the answer to the most-asked question 
when I teach a class on eBay. Many sellers 
have more than one picture within the auction 
description area. By putting extra images in 
the description, they do not have to pay extra 
for eBay’s hosting services. This isn’t magic; 
you can easily do it, too. Just add a tiny bit of 
HTML code in your auction description. Here 
is the HTML code to insert one picture in your 
auction:
<img src=http://www.yourserver.com/
imagename.jpg>
Be sure to use the brackets to open and close 
your code (they’re located above the comma 
and the period on your keyboard). This code 
reflects the URL of your picture and the coding 
img src= to tell eBay’s server to insert a 
picture.
When you want to insert two pictures, just insert 
code for each picture, one after the other. If you 
want one picture to appear below the other, use 
the HTML code for line break, <BR>. Here’s 
how to write that:
<img src=http://www.yourserver.com/
imagenumber1.jpg> <BR>
<img src=http://www.yourserver.com/
imagenumber2.jpg>

Putting on the Hits
Okay, you’ve got a great auction on eBay and great images to go with it. Now 
all you need to do is track the number of users peeking at your items and 
attract even more people to your auction.
Your auction is up and running on eBay, and you’re dying to know how many 
people have stopped by to take a look. To easily monitor your auction’s hits — 
the number of times visitors stop to look at the goods — you use a free public 
counter program from an online source. A counter is a useful marketing tool; 
for example, you can check the number of times people have looked at but not 
bid on your auctions. If you have lots more lookie-loos than bids, you may have 
a problem with your auction.
 
If your counter indicates you’re not getting many hits, consider the following 
potential problems so you can resurrect your auction:
 
✓ Does the picture take too long to load?
 
✓ Is the opening bid too high?
 
✓ Are those neon-orange-and-lime-green bell-bottoms just too funky to sell?
Counters are available when you’re listing your item on the eBay Sell Your 
Item form. You can also find some highly “intelligent” counters elsewhere on 
the Net, at sites such as Sellathon.com.
Want to know more about the people behind those user IDs? Thousands of 
eBay members have created their own personal Web pages on eBay (called 
About Me pages). About Me pages are easy to create — and are as unique as 
each eBay member. eBay users with active About Me pages have a special ME 
icon next to their user IDs.
 
Take your time when you create your About Me page. A well-done About Me 
page improves your sales because people who come across your auctions and 
check out your About Me page can get a sense of who you are and how seri-
ous you are about your eBay activities. They see instantly that you’re no fly-
by-night seller.
Before you create your About Me page, I suggest that you look at what other 
users have done. eBay members often include pictures, links to other Web 
sites (including their personal or business home pages), and links to just 
about any Web location that reflects their personalities, which is why they’re 
so entertaining. If your purpose is to generate more business, I recommend 
that you keep your About Me page focused on your auction listings, with a 
link to your Web site.

Part III: Making Money the eBay Way 
 
Sellers with many auctions running at once often add a message to their About 
Me pages that indicates that they’re willing to reduce shipping charges if bid-
ders also bid on their other auctions. This direct tactic may lack nuance, but it 
increases the number of people who look at (and bid on) your auctions.
To create your About Me page, do the following:
 
1. Go to any eBay user’s About Me page, scroll to the very bottom and 
click the Create My About Me Page link. If you can’t find the link, go 
to: cgi3.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?AboutMeLogin.
 
 You’re taken to About Me: Create Your Own eBay Personal Page.
 
2. If you haven’t signed in, type your user ID and password in the appro-
priate boxes.
 
3. Click the Edit Your Page button.
 
4. Select the Use Our Easy Step-by-Step Process.
 
 You’re taken to the About Me layout page. You have three layout 
options, which eBay is kind enough to show you:
 
• Newspaper Layout
 
• Centered Layout
 
5. Click the button that corresponds to the layout option you want.
 
 You’re taken to a second About Me creation page.
 
6. Enter the following information:
 
• Page Title: Type the title of your About Me page (for example, 
Larry’s Lunchboxes).
 
• Paragraph 1: Type a personal attention-grabbing headline, such as 
Welcome to Larry Lunch’s Lunchbox Place.
 
• Text: Type a short paragraph that greets your visitors (something 
like Hey, I like lunchboxes a lot only more exciting).
 
• Paragraph 2: Type another headline for the second paragraph of 
the page, such as Vintage, Modern, Ancient, or I Collect All Kinds of 
Lunchboxes.
 
• Text: Type another paragraph about yourself or your collection 
(such as, I used to stare at lunchboxes in the school cafeteria . . . 
only more, you know, normal).
 
• Picture: If you’re adding a picture, type a sentence describing it, 
for example: This is my wife Loretta with our lunchbox collection.

285
 Chapter 14: Increase Your Profits with Pictures and Other Strategies
 
• URL: Type the Web site address (URL) where people can find your 
picture. See the section earlier in this chapter that shows you how 
to upload digital images.
 
• Feedback: Select how many of your feedback postings you want to 
appear on your About Me page. (You can opt not to show any feed-
back, but I think you should put in a few comments, especially if 
they’re complimentary, as in, Larry sent my lunchbox promptly, and 
it makes lunchtime a blast! Everybody stares at it. . .)
 
• Items for Sale: Select how many of your current auctions you want 
to appear on your About Me page. If you don’t have any auctions 
running at the moment, you can select the Show No Items option.
 
• Label: Type a caption to introduce your auctions, for example: 
Lunchboxes I’m Currently Selling.
 
• Favorite Links: Type the names and URLs of any Web links you 
want visitors to see, for example, a Web site that appraises 
lunchboxes (It’s in excellent condition except for that petrified 
ham sandwich. . .).
 
 See mine in Figure 14-5.
 
7. Click the Back button. (Or, if you don’t like your current layout, click 
the Continue button to go back to Step 1.)
 
 You’re now looking at your final About Me page.

8. Scroll down to the bottom of the page. You see a group of buttons:
 
• Edit Some More: Returns you to Step 2.
 
• Save My Page: Saves your About Me page so that you’re one step 
closer to publishing it on eBay.
 
• Edit Using HTML: If you know HTML code, you can customize your 
About Me page. (For example, you can insert pictures with the 
code I give you in the “Multiple pictures in your descriptions” side-
bar, earlier in this chapter.)
 
• Start Over: Takes you to a link page where you can delete what 
you created and begin again.
 
9. When you’re happy with your masterpiece, click the Save My Page 
button.
 
 Yes, you did it; now anybody in the world with access to the Internet 
can find your personal About Me page on eBay.
 
Don’t forget to update your About Me page often. A good About Me page 
makes bidders eager to know more about your auctions. An out-of-date About 
Me page turns off potential bidders. If you choose to update, you need to edit 
it using HTML. If you don’t use HTML, you have to create a whole new page.
 
You can link to your About Me page from your Web site or from your e-mail 
because all About Me pages have their own personal URLs. The address ends 
with your user ID. For example, here’s the URL for my page:
members.ebay.com/aboutme/marsha_c
Blog on Your My World Page
If blogging is the key to the new Web, your My World page is the hub of your 
eBay user interaction. Your About Me page is there for customers; the My 
World page is mostly used by the eBay community. People like to know about 
other people, and the My World page shows your world, your way.
Although my editors would love for me to give you a long, drawn out, step-
by-step list to show you how to get to your My World page, I won’t. It’s all too 
simple: Just click your user ID on your My eBay page (or any page for that 
matter) and you’ll arrive at your own (ready-to-fill-out) My World page.
Once you get there, you see a page ready to edit. Here’s the lowdown:
 
✓ Edit image: By clicking here, you’ll come to a page that allows you to 
automatically upload a picture from your computer or use one of the 
handy (but unexciting) eBay-supplied avatars (faux pictures) to appear 
on your My World page.

287
 Chapter 14: Increase Your Profits with Pictures and Other Strategies

Even More of 
eBay’s Special 
Features

In this part . . .
S
o you want to protect yourself from bad apples, not 
just on eBay but all over the Internet? You’re not 
alone. I want to keep safe as well, and that’s why I’ve 
tipped you off to the information in this part.
This is the place to come if you want to know just what 
eBay knows about you and is willing to share with other 
eBay members. I also introduce you to the Security Center 
(Trust & Safety), the next best thing to a superhero when 
it comes to protecting you from people who don’t qualify 
for the eBay User of the Year Award.
eBay is a community, so you need to be let in on some of 
the ways you can commune with other collectors and get 
into the social scene. In this part, you find out about the 
special features that make eBay such a unique environ-
ment. Where else can you buy an item you really want and 
also help out a charity, all with the click of a mouse?

Chapter 15
Privacy: To Protect and to Serve
In This Chapter
▶ Digging up what eBay knows about you
▶ Determining how safe your information is on eBay
▶ Finding out what eBay does with your info
▶ Protecting your privacy
O
n the Internet, as in real life, you should never take your personal pri-
vacy for granted. Sure, you’re ecstatic that you can shop and sell on 
eBay from the privacy of your home, but remember: Just because your front 
door is locked doesn’t mean that your privacy is being protected. If you’re 
new to the Internet, you may be surprised to find out what you reveal about 
yourself to the world, no matter how many precautions you take. (Yes, we 
all know about that neon green exfoliating mask you wear when you’re 
bidding . . . just kidding . . . honest.)
In this chapter, you find out how much eBay knows about you and who eBay 
shares your information with. I explain what you can do to protect your pri-
vacy and tell you some simple steps you can take to increase not only your 
Internet privacy but also yourpersonal safety.
What eBay Knows about You
The irony of the Internet is that although you think you’re sitting at home 
working anonymously, third parties such as advertisers and marketing com-
panies are secretly getting to know you.
While you’re busy collecting Winter Olympic memorabilia and buying that 
hot new Dooney Burke purse, eBay is busy collecting nuggets of informa-
tion about you. eBay gets some of this information from you and some of it 
from your computer. All the data eBay gets is stored in the mammoth eBay 
memory bank.

292
Part IV: Even More of eBay’s Special Features 
What you tell eBay
eBay gets much of what it knows about you from you. When you sign up, 
you voluntarily tell eBay important and personal information about yourself. 
Right off the bat, you give eBay these juicy tidbits:
 
✓ Name
 
✓ E-mail address
 
✓ Snail-mail address
 
✓ Phone number
 
✓ Your date of birth
 
✓ Password
“Okay, that’s no big deal,” you say, but if you’re using your credit card to 
settle your eBay fees (or using PayPal), you’re also giving out the following 
personal financial information:
 
✓ Credit card number
 
✓ Expiration date
 
✓ Bank account number
 
✓ Credit card billing address
 
✓ Credit card history
 
Don’t worry about giving this information to eBay or PayPal. The bottom line 
is that every time you pay by check or with a credit card in the real world, you 
give away personal info about yourself. eBay carefully locks up this informa-
tion (in a high-tech Alcatraz, of sorts), but other companies or individuals may 
not be so protective. Before you put a check in the mail, make sure you’re 
comfortable with where it’s going.
What cookies gather
Web sites collect information about you by using cookies. No, they don’t 
bribe you with oatmeal-raisin goodies. Cookies are nothing more than tiny 
files that companies (such as eBay) put on your hard drive to store data 
about your surfing habits.

293
 Chapter 15: Privacy: To Protect and to Serve 
Most Web site designers install cookies to help you navigate their sites. 
Sometimes the cookie becomes sort of an “admission ticket” so that you 
don’t need to register every time you log on.
eBay has partnerships with companies that provide page-view and data-
tracking technology and advertisers who display advertising banners on eBay 
pages, whether you want to see the banners or not. If you click a banner, a 
cookie from that particular advertiser may go onto your computer, usually to 
prevent you from seeing it again.
 
Cookies can’t steal information from other files on your computer. A cookie 
can access only the information that you provide to its Web site.
DoubleClick, a major player in the cookie-tracking field, says that it uses your 
information to limit the number of times that you see the same advertise-
ment. DoubleClick also measures the kinds of ads that you respond to and 
tracks which member Web sites you visit and how often. The bottom line is 
that DoubleClick is just trying to sell you stuff with ads based on your per-
sonal interests. The upside is that you get to see stuff that you may like.
 
You can find out more about cookies at www.cookiecentral.com/faq. 
This site gives you simple instructions on how to handle cookies on your 
computer.
If you want to keep your information private, you can remove yourself from 
the DoubleClick cookie system by going to this Web site:
http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/dart_adserving.aspx
Your eBay sign-in cookie
There are two types of cookies:
 
✓ End of session: This cookie type remains on your computer as long as 
your browser is open or, in the case of eBay, for 24 hours. When you 
close your Internet browser (Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari, or Opera) 
the cookie disappears as if you downed it with icy cold milk.
 
✓ Permanent: This flavor is perfect if you don’t share your computer with 
anyone else; it permits your computer to always remain signed in to a 
particular Web site. (eBay does not use this sort of cookie).
When you visit eBay and sign in, eBay gives you an end-of-session cookie.

294
Part IV: Even More of eBay’s Special Features 
 
eBay’s “keep me signed in” sign-in cookie is a good thing. It prevents the previ-
ously repetitive task of typing your user ID and password at every turn. This 
cookie simplifies your participation in chats, bidding, watching items, viewing 
e-mail addresses, and so on. Because you don’t have to sign in every moment 
that you’re doing business on eBay, it’s a real time-saver.
Web beacons
Web beacons are clear, 1-pixel-by-1-pixel images that are placed in the HTML 
(or Internet page code) for individual pages. They are also commonly called 
pixel tags. Web beacons, like cookies, are used mainly for collecting market-
ing information. They track the traffic patterns of users from one page to 
another.
Web beacons are also often used in e-mails. Ever wonder how someone 
knows if you’ve received an e-mail? Or that you may receive an e-mail from a 
company whose Web site you’ve just visited? Blame the sneaky but harmless 
beacons.
Web beacons are invisible as cookies and are incorporated into Web pages 
without your knowing. Turning off cookies on your browser won’t disable 
beacons, but this action protects your anonymity. Web beacons are not as 
ominous as they may seem because the information collected is not person-
ally identifiable; they just track your passage along the site.
What Web servers collect
Every time that you log on to the Internet, you leave an electronic trail of 
information, just like Hansel and Gretel. eBay, like zillions of other Web sites, 
uses servers, which are immense programs that do nothing but collect and 
transfer bits (and bytes) of information day and night. Your Internet connec-
tion has a special address that identifies you to all servers when you surf the 
Net. This is called an IP (Internet Protocol) address and is often used by law 
enforcement to track those whose shenanigans wreak havoc on Web sites or 
other users.
Web servers all over the Internet track some or all of the following information:
 
✓ What Web site you came in from
 
✓ The ISP (Internet service provider) that you use
 
✓ The items that you’re selling on eBay
 
✓ The Web sites you linked your listings to
 
✓ Your favorite Web sites (if you link them to your About Me page)

295
 Chapter 15: Privacy: To Protect and to Serve 
eBay collects the following information while you visit the eBay site. After 
you log off, the server discards the data:
 
✓ What you do while logged on to the site
 
✓ Which categories you tend to browse
 
✓ Which items you’ve viewed recently
 
✓ What times you log on and log off
Like incredible Internet archivists, eBay’s servers keep a record of everything 
you bid on, win, and sell, which is great news if you have a problem with a trans-
action and need eBay to investigate. Also, eBay couldn’t display feedback about 
you and other users if its servers didn’t store all the feedback you write and 
receive. Have you ever sent an e-mail to eBay? eBay’s servers record it and keep 
it in some murky recess of eBay’s memory. Remember, we live in the age of elec-
tronic commerce, and the people on eBay run a serious business that depends 
on e-commerce. They have to keep everything in case they need it later.

check out this address:
pages.ebay.com/help/policies/privacy-appendix.html
Be sure to visit the page; you may be shocked by the amount of information 
that exists on the eBay servers about you and your habits.

as you surf the Internet, visit this Web site:

Cookie removal-ware
I got a call from a friend who complained that her laptop computer was 
getting slower and slower. She brought it over to my house and when I had 
a look at it, I also noticed that it was opening extra pop-up windows and 
accessing the Internet spuriously. After checking to see whether she had
a virus (no, she didn’t), I went to the Internet to get her spyware removal 
software. Perhaps her problem was that too many people had inserted 
information-gathering cookies on her computer.
That was certainly the case. After installing and running the software, I found 
that she had over 350 cookies pulling information from her computer as she 
surfed. Once deleted, her computer ran much faster.
She certainly didn’t give these people permission to spy on her comings 
and goings on the Internet. These cookies were placed on her computer 

296
Part IV: Even More of eBay’s Special Features 
without her knowledge. If you want to purge these uninvited spies from your 
computer, download any of the free spyware or malware software from the 
Internet. Two good free ones are Ad-aware from www.lavasoftusa.com/
software/adaware and Spybot Search and Destroy, available from www.
safer-networking.org/en/index.html.
If you’re apprehensive about all the information that Web servers can collect 
about you while you innocently roam the Internet, I understand. But before 
you start looking out for Big Brother watching over your shoulder, consider 
this: On the Web, everybody’s collecting information.
The odds are excellent that all the information that eBay knows about you 
is already in the hands of many other folks, too — your bank, your grocer, 
the staff of any magazines you subscribe to, clubs you belong to, any airlines 
you’ve flown, and any insurance agencies you use. That’s life these days. And 
if you’re thinking, “Just because everybody knows all this stuff about me, that 
doesn’t make it right,” all I can say is, “You’re right.” But maybe you’ll sleep 
better knowing that eBay is one place where folks take the privacy issue seri-
ously. See the next section for details.
eBay’s privacy policy
eBay had a privacy policy for all its users before privacy policies were even 
in vogue. Now eBay maintains the safety standards set forth by the pioneer in 
online safeguarding: TRUSTe.
TRUSTe (www.truste.org) sets a list of standards that its member Web 
sites have to follow to earn a “seal of approval.” The thousands of Web sites 
that subscribe to this watchdog group must adhere to its guidelines and set 
policies to protect privacy. eBay has been a member of TRUSTe since the pri-
vacy watchdog group was founded.
Do seals bite back?
Because eBay pays to display the TRUSTe 
mark, some online critics say that the seal is 
nothing more than window dressing. These 
critics wonder whether it would be in the Web 
watchdog’s best financial interest to bite the 
hand that feeds it all those display fees. Critics 
complain that the seal offers a false sense of 
security — and suggest that you view the seal 
as nothing more than a disclaimer to be careful 
in your Internet dealings.
Technically, TRUSTe can pull its seal whenever 
a Web site becomes careless in its handling of 
privacy issues. However, the critics make a 
good point: Always be careful in your Internet 
dealings, no matter how much protection a site 
has. If you ever feel your personal information 
has been compromised, file a complaint at the 
TRUSTe Web site: www.truste.org/pvr.
php?page=complaint.

297
 Chapter 15: Privacy: To Protect and to Serve 
 
To review the policy that’s earned eBay the TRUSTe seal of approval, click the 
Policies link that appears at the bottom of every eBay page.
In addition to setting and displaying a privacy policy, eBay follows these 
guidelines as well:
 
✓ eBay must make its Privacy Policy links easily accessible to users. You 
can find the logo on eBay’s home page. Click the Policies link. On the 
eBay Policies page, click the Privacy Policy link and you’re taken to 
the Privacy Policies page for more information. Take advantage of this 
opportunity to find out how your data is being protected.
 
✓ eBay must disclose what personal information it collects and how it’s 
using the info.
 
✓ Users must have an easy way to review the personal information that 
eBay has about them.
 
✓ Users must have an opting out option that lets them decline to share 
information.
 
✓ eBay must follow industry standards to make its Web site and database 
secure so that hackers and nonmembers have no access to the infor-
mation. eBay uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), which is an encryption 
program that scrambles data until it gets to eBay. Unfortunately, no Web 
site, including the CIA’s Web site, is completely secure, so you still have 
to be on your guard while you’re online.
Grateful Dead cookie jar
In 1999, an auction description read: “This 
is one of the grooviest jars I have ever come 
across — a real find for the die-hard Grateful 
Dead fan or for the cookie jar collector who has 
it all. Made by Vandor, this Grateful Dead bus 
cookie jar looks like something the Dead would 
drive. Beautiful detailing on the peace signs; 
the roses are running lights. Painted windows. 
You have just got to see this piece. Only 10,000 
made, and I have only seen one other. Comes 
with box that has Grateful Dead logos on it. 
Buyer pays all shipping and insurance.”
The cookie jar started at $1.00 and sold on eBay 
for $102.50. When I updated this book in 2002, it 
sold on eBay for $125.00; when I updated again 
in 2004, it went for $150.00. The Grateful Dead’s 
bus cookie jar is riding the tracks these days; 
in 2009 an auction closed with the final bid at 
$125.00. Perhaps the baby boomer Deadheads 
are feeling the economic crunch. Still, the price 
of the original has skyrocketed from the original 
issue price, so much so that Vandor just came 
out with a 40th anniversary replica. Buy it now 
for your Deadhead friends — and buy it quick. 
Only 1,200 were made, and the price is already 
edging up to the $100.00 mark.
Oh wow, dude — that’s some far-out cookie jar. 
(Cue the band: Keep truckin’. . . .)

What Does eBay Do with Information 
about Me, Anyway?
Although eBay knows a good chunk of information about you, it puts the 
information to good use. The fact that it knows so much about you actually 
helps you in the long run.
Here’s what eBay uses personal information for:
 
✓ Upgrading eBay: Like most e-commerce companies, eBay tracks 
members’ use and habits to improve the Web site. For instance, if a 
particular item generates a lot of activity, eBay may add a category or 
a subcategory.
 
✓ Clearing the way for transactions: If eBay didn’t collect personal infor-
mation such as your e-mail address, your snail-mail address, and your 
phone number, you couldn’t complete the transaction you started after 
an auction was over. Bummer.
 
✓ Billing: You think it’s important to keep track of your merchandise and 
money, don’t you? So does eBay. It uses your personal information to 
keep an eye on your account and your paying habits — and on every-
body else’s. (Call it a gentle encouragement of honest trading habits.)
 
✓ Policing the site: Never forget that eBay tries to be tough on cyber-
crime, and that if you break the rules or regulations, eBay will hunt you 
down and boot you out. Personal information is used to find eBay delin-
quents, and eBay makes it clear that it cooperates with law enforcement 
and with third parties whose merchandise you may be selling illegally. 
For more about this topic, read up on the VeRO program in Chapter 9.
 
Periodically, eBay runs surveys asking specific questions about your use of 
the site. It uses your answers to upgrade eBay. In addition, eBay asks whether 
it can forward your information to a marketing firm. eBay says that it does not 
forward any personally identifiable information, which means that any info 
you provide is given to third parties as raw data. However, if you’re nervous 
about privacy, I suggest that you make it clear that you don’t want your com-
ments to leave eBay should you decide to participate in eBay surveys. If you 
don’t participate in the surveys, you won’t have any hand in creating new 
eBay features, though, so you can’t complain if you don’t like how the site 
looks. Sometimes, eBay advertises surveys that users can take part in on the 
eBay home page.

299
 Chapter 15: Privacy: To Protect and to Serve 
What Do Other eBay Members 
Know about Me?
eBay functions under the premise that eBay’s members are buying, selling, 
working, and playing in an honest and open way. That means that anyone 
surfing can immediately find out some limited information about you:
 
✓ Your user ID and history
 
✓ Your feedback history
 
✓ All the auctions and eBay store sales you run
 
✓ Your current purchases and any you’ve made during a 30-day period
eBay clearly states in its policies and guidelines that e-mail addresses should 
be used only for eBay business. If you abuse this policy, you can be sus-
pended or even kicked off for good.
 
eBay provides limited eBay member registration information to its users. If 
another member involved in a transaction with you wants to know the follow-
ing facts about you, they’re available:
 
✓ Your name (and business name if you have provided that information)
 
✓ Your e-mail address
 
✓ The city, state, and country that you provided to eBay
 
✓ The telephone number that you provided to eBay
 
Following the transaction, buyers and sellers exchange some real-world infor-
mation. As I explain in Chapters 6 and 12, members initiate the exchange of 
merchandise and money by e-mail, providing personal addresses for both 
payments and shipments. Make sure that you’re comfortable giving out your 
home address. If you’re not, I explain alternatives in this chapter.
Spam — Not Just a Hawaiian Delicacy
Although you can find plenty of places to socialize and have fun on eBay, 
when it comes to business, eBay is . . . well, all business. eBay’s policy says 
that requests for registration information can be made only for people with 
whom you’re transacting business on eBay. The contact information request 
form requires that you type the item number of the transaction you’re 
involved in as well as the user ID of the person whose contact info you want. 
If you’re not involved in a transaction, as a bidder or a seller in the specified 
item number, you can’t access the user information.

300
Part IV: Even More of eBay’s Special Features 
When it comes to e-mail addresses, your secret is safe. If you bid on an auc-
tion, your e-mail is visible only to the seller. The end of listing notice contains 
your e-mail address so that the person on the other end of the transaction 
can contact you. After the other user has your e-mail address, eBay rules 
state that the user can use it only for eBay business.
 
Here’s a list of “business” reasons for e-mail communication, generally 
accepted by all on eBay:
 
✓ Responding to feedback that you left
 
✓ Responding to feedback that you received
 
✓ Communicating with sellers or buyers during and after transactions
 
✓ Suggesting items to friends that they may be interested in via the Share 
feature (on the item page)
 
✓ Leaving chat room comments
 
✓ Discussing common interests with other members, such as shared 
hometowns, interesting collections, and past or current listings.
Sending spam versus eating it
Sending e-mail to other members is a great way to do business and make 
friends. But don’t cross the line into spam. Spam, a Hormel canned meat 
product (I’ve given Spam its own sidebar), now has an alternate meaning. 
When you spell it with a small s, spam is unsolicited e-mail — most often, 
advertising — sent to multiple e-mail addresses gleaned from marketing lists. 
Spam I am
Spam, the unwanted electronic junk mail, is 
named after Spam, the canned meat product. 
(Spam collectibles on eBay are another matter 
entirely.) According to the Spam Web site, more 
than 6 billion cans of Spam have been con-
sumed worldwide. (By the way, Hawaiians eat 
more Spam than any other state in the union.) 
Spam is made from a secret recipe of pork 
shoulder, ham, and special spices. It was first 
produced in 1937 and got its name from the SP 
for spice and the AM from ham.
It’s widely believed that spam (junk e-mail) got 
its name from the old Monty Python sketch 
because the refrain “Spam-Spam-Spam-Spam” 
drowned out all other conversation and one of 
the participants kept saying, “I don’t want any 
Spam. I don’t like Spam.” Others say that it 
came from a bunch of computer geeks at USC 
who thought that junk e-mail was about as sat-
isfying as a Spam sandwich. Perhaps they’ve 
never enjoyed a Spam luau in Hawaii under the 
moonlight — aloha! For more spam fun facts

Eventually, it fills up your inbox the way “Spam, Spam, Spam, and Spam” 
filled up the menu in an old Monty Python restaurant skit.
Think of spam as the electronic version of the junk mail that you get via the 
U.S. Postal Service. Spam may be okay for eating (if you’re into that kind of 
thing), but sending it can get you banned from eBay.
 
If you send an e-mail that advertises a product or service to people who haven’t 
agreed (opted in) that they wanted this sort of e-mail, you’re guilty of spamming.
Trashing your junk mail
Sometimes spam can come in the form of mail from people you know and 
expect mail from. Your closest friend’s computer may have been abducted by 
some weird Internet virus and replicated the virus to everyone in his or her 
e-mail address book. Obviously, this is not a good thing for those who receive 
and open the e-mail.
 
Don’t open e-mail from anyone you don’t know, especially if a file is attached 
to it. Sometimes, if a spammer is really slick, it’s hard to tell that you’ve 
received spam. If you receive an e-mail with no subject line, however — or if 
the e-mail has an addressee name that isn’t yours, or is coming from someone 
you never heard of — delete it. You never know; it could be just annoying 
spam — or worse, it could contain a computer virus as an attachment, just 
waiting for you to open and activate it.
Speaking of e-mail, if you’re new to the technology, I recommend getting 
a good antivirus program that can scan e-mail attachments and rid your 
system of some annoying and increasingly dangerous computer bugs.
 
For some interesting general anti-spam tips, drop in at spam.abuse.net. 
This Web site offers helpful advice for doing battle with spam artists. Also, 
I’ve been using a handy software program for years called MailWasher, which 
allows me to preview my e-mail before it’s downloaded to my computer. 
It even bounces spam back to the sender on command — as if your e-mail 
address didn’t exist. Best of all, this program is free and available from www.
mailwasher.net.
E-mail spoofing
E-mail spoofing has become the bane of the online community and can wreak 
havoc. Spoofing is accomplished when crafty techno-geeks send out e-mail 
and make it appear to come from someone other than themselves — some-
one you know and expect e-mail from. Most often, this type of e-mail is pro-
grammed to invade your privacy or, even worse, bilk you out of confidential 
information.

302
Part IV: Even More of eBay’s Special Features 
 
A spate of e-mails have purportedly been sent from eBay, PayPal, and other 
major e-commerce sites, claiming that your membership has been suspended 
or that your records need updating. The opportunistic e-mail then asks you to 
click a link to a page on the site, which then asks you to input your personal 
information. Don’t do it!
 
Most sites will never ask you to provide sensitive information through e-mail, 
so don’t do it. If you receive an e-mail saying your “account has been sus-
pended,” close the e-mail and go directly to the site in question — without 
using the supplied link in the e-mail. You’ll know soon enough if there is a 
problem with your account.
If you get this sort of e-mail from eBay and want to confirm whether it is 
really from eBay, visit this eBay security page:
pages.ebay.com/help/account/recognizing-spoof.html
To help eBay in its investigation of these information thieves, send a copy of 
the e-mail (along with all identification headers) to spoof@ebay.com. When 
forwarding the e-mail, do not alter it in any way.
I Vant to Be Alone — and Vat 
You Can Do to Stay That Vay
The Internet has a long reach. Don’t be surprised if you furnish your per-
sonal information freely on one Web site, and it turns up somewhere else. If 
you don’t mind people knowing things about you (your name, your hobbies, 
where you live, and your phone number, for example), by all means share. 
My messages safeguard your privacy
Being the conscientious company it is, eBay 
has set up a private area, accessible only 
through one of the three tabs on your My eBay 
page, called Messages. Messages enables 
you to communicate with other eBay members 
without revealing your e-mail address. All your 
missives with other members, such as Ask the 
Seller a Question communications, appear in 
this area. You can answer mail, send new mail, 
and delete communications from this area, just 
as if it was your own e-mail software.
This service can protect you from most of the 
most dangerous forms of spam. For safety’s 
sake, whenever you receive an e-mail sent (in 
reality or purportedly) from eBay or an eBay 
member, don’t click the e-mail link to Respond 
Now. Open your Internet browser and go 
directly to your Messages area. If the e-mail 
is legitimate, it will appear here. Merely click 
the e-mail to open it, read it, and reply. Your pri-
vacy (in the form of your e-mail address) isn’t 
exposed to the receiving party.

303
 Chapter 15: Privacy: To Protect and to Serve 
But I personally think you should give only as much information as you need 
to do business on the site.
 
Privacy is not secrecy. Don’t feel obligated to reveal anything about yourself 
that isn’t absolutely necessary. (Some personal facts are in the same league as 
body weight — private, even if hardly a secret.)
Although you can’t prevent privacy leaks entirely, you can take some precau-
tions to protect yourself. Here are some tips to keep your online information 
as safe and secure as possible:
 
✓ User ID: When eBay first started, members used their e-mail addresses 
to buy and sell. Today, users appear on the site with a nom de plume 
(okay, user ID, but nom de plume sounds oh, so chic). Your first line of 
defense against everyone who surfs the eBay site is to choose a user ID 
that doesn’t reveal too much about you. Chapter 2 gives you some point-
ers on how to choose your user ID.
 
✓ Password: Guard your password as if it were the key to your home. 
Don’t give any buyers or sellers your password. If a window requesting 
your password pops up in an auction, skip it — it’s somebody who is 
up to no good. Use your password only on official eBay screens. (See 
Chapter 2 for tips on choosing passwords.)
 
 If you’re concerned that someone may have your password, change it 
immediately:
 
1. Go to your My eBay area and hover your cursor over the 
Account tab. From the drop-down menu, click Personal 
Information.
 
2. On your arrival in the Personal Information area, find the 
Password line and click the Edit link.
 
3. Follow the instructions to change your password.
 
 Your password is immediately changed.
 
 If your password has been changed by some dastardly evildoer, and 
you can’t sign in to your account, go to the eBay home page. Click the 
Contact Us link, which is in the upper-right corner. Choose the Chat 
Online contact option, and you’ll be in touch with a live human being 
who can help you secure your account before damage can be done.
 
✓ Credit card information: Whenever you use your credit card on eBay, 
you can make sure that your private information is safe. Look for an SSL 
(SSL stands for Security Sockets Layer) link or check box. Sometimes you 
may see a link that says You May Also Sign in Securely. SSL is an encryp-
tion program that scrambles the information so that hackers have 
almost no chance of getting your information. (I explain more about SSL 
in Chapter 2.)
 
 When buying from a listing that accepts credit cards, check the seller’s 
feedback and carefully weigh the risks of giving your credit card number 

304
Part IV: Even More of eBay’s Special Features 
to someone you don’t know versus paying through PayPal. PayPal is the 
safest way to pay because your credit card number is not released.
 
 Never give anyone your Social Security number online. Guard yours as if 
it were the key to the Crown Jewels.
 
✓ Registration information: When you first register, eBay requests a 
phone number and address for billing and contact purposes. I’ve never 
had a problem with anyone requesting my registration information and 
then misusing it. However, many people want an added measure of ano-
nymity. You can give eBay the information it wants in several ways with-
out compromising your privacy:
 
• Instead of your home phone number, provide eBay with a cell 
phone number, a work phone number, or a SkypeIn number. (See 
Chapter 18 for more information on Skype.) Screen your calls with 
an answering machine.
 
• Use a post office box instead of your home address.
 
• Start a bank account solely for eBay transactions. Make it a DBA 
(doing business as) account so that you can use an alternate name. 
Your bank can help you with this process.
 
✓ Chat rooms: eBay has a multitude of chat rooms where members 
exchange information and sometimes heated arguments. (Chat rooms 
are thoroughly discussed in Chapter 17.) But heed this advice: Be care-
ful what you reveal about yourself in a chat room. Don’t expect that “just 
between us” means that at all. Chat rooms can be viewed by anyone who 
visits the eBay site, not just eBay members.
 
 Never say anything online that you wouldn’t feel comfortable saying to 
the next person who passed you on the street. Basically, that’s who you’re 
talking to. You can find stories of romances blossoming on eBay — and 
I’m delighted for the happy couples, I swear — but come on, that doesn’t 
mean that you should lose your head. Don’t give out any personal infor-
mation to strangers; too often, that’s asking for trouble. Have fun on eBay 
but hang on to your common sense.
 
 Skim some of the category chat rooms, especially the Discuss eBay’s 
Newest Features room, for warnings about security problems on the 
chat rooms and boards — and how to avoid ’em. A great bunch of users 
and eBay staffers frequent that board, and they’re sure to give you good 
information.
 
✓ Check feedback: Yep, I sound like a broken record (in case you don’t 
remember, records were the large, black, prone-to-breaking disks used 
by people to play music on electric turntables before iPods and CDs 
were invented), but here it is again: Check feedback. eBay works because 
it’s policed by its participants. The best way to learn about the folks 
whom you’re dealing with is to see how others felt about them. If you 
take only one thing away from this book, it’s to check feedback before 
you bid or buy!

 Chapter 15: Privacy: To Protect and to Serve 
Fighting back
Robbin was minding her own business, sell-
ing software on eBay, when she ran into one 
of the world’s nastiest eBay outlaws. He was 
a one-stop-shopping outlet of rule-breaking 
behaviors. First, he ruined her auctions by bid-
ding ridiculously high amounts and then retract-
ing bids at the last legal minute. (This couldn’t 
happen today because eBay changed their bid-
ding policies due to these nefarious practices). 
He e-mailed her bidders, offering the same 
item but cheaper. He contacted Robbin’s win-
ning bidders to say he was accepting her pay-
ments. Then he started leaving messages on 
her answering machine. When she finally had 
enough, she contacted Trust & Safety, which 
suspended him.
But like a bad lunch, he came back up — with 
a new name. So Robbin fought back on her 
own. She got his registration information and 
sent him a letter. She also informed the support 
area at his ISP about what he was doing, and 
because he used his work e-mail address, she 
also contacted his boss.
Her efforts must have done the trick. He finally 
slipped out of eBay and slithered out of her 
life. The lesson: Don’t rely completely on eBay 
to pick up the pieces. If you’re being abused, 
stand up for your rights and fight back through 
the proper channels!
In the virtual world, as in the real world, cyber-
stalking is scary and illegal. If you think some-
one is using information from eBay to harass 
you, contact eBay immediately — as well as 
your local police. Chapter 16 gives you the ins 
and outs of contacting eBay’s security team.

Chapter 16
Staying Safe and Sane
In This Chapter
▶ Keeping eBay members safe
▶ Staying current with the rules
▶ Filing complaints against eBay bad guys
▶ Knowing your items through authentication
▶ Saving yourself: Where to go when eBay can’t help
M
illions of people transact business every day on eBay. If you’re new to 
the Internet, however, you may need a reality check. With hundreds 
of millions of listings worldwide, and close to 30 million new listings every 
day, the law of averages dictates that you’re bound to run into some rough 
seas eventually. If you do, know that you can get the answers you need from 
eBay’s Trust & Safety department. In this chapter, I take you through the 
Trust & Safety resources — from reporting abuses to resolving insurance 
issues. This chapter explains how eBay enforces its rules and regulations, 
shows how you can use third-party bonding and mediation services, and 
even points out how to go outside eBay for help if you run into some really 
big-time problems.
Keeping eBay Safe with Trust & Safety
The Security Center is the eBay area that focuses on protecting eBay buyers 
and sellers from members who aren’t playing by the rules. Through this 
department, eBay issues warnings and policy changes — and in some cases, 
it gives eBay bad guys the heave-ho.
 
You should know about two important safety areas on eBay:
 
✓ eBay Security Center: You reach the Security Center from a small link 
found at the bottom of almost every eBay page. From here you can 
find and report safety violations. If eBay ever moves this link, just type 
http://pages.ebay.com/securitycenter/ into your browser and 
you’re there.

308
Part IV: Even More of eBay’s Special Features 
 
✓ eBay Resolution Center: From the navigation bar, which is at the top of 
every eBay page, just cursor over to the Help link and choose Resolution 
Center from the drop-down menu. This is where you report transac-
tional issues: unpaid items, items received not as described, and more.
The Security Center (as shown in Figure 16-1) is more than just a link to 
policies and information. It also connects you with a group of eBay staffers 
who handle complaints, field incoming tips about possible infractions, and 
dole out warnings and suspensions. These dedicated employees investigate 
infractions and send out e-mails in response to tips. eBay staffers look at 
complaints on a case-by-case basis, in the order they receive them. Most 
complaints they receive are about these problems:
 
✓ Shill bidders (see the section on “Selling abuses” in this chapter)
 
✓ Feedback issues and abuses (see the section on “Feedback abuses” in 
this chapter)
 
Figure 16-1: 
The 
Security & 
Resolution 
Center as 
it appears 
when you 
click the 
Security 
Center link.
 
 
Keep in mind that eBay is a community of people, most of whom have never 
met each other. No matter what you buy or sell on eBay, don’t expect eBay 
transactions to be any safer than buying or selling from a complete stranger. If 
you go in with this attitude, you can’t be disappointed.
If you’ve been reading previous chapters in this book, you probably know 
about eBay’s rules and regulations. For a closer online look at them, click the 
Policies link, which is on the bottom of most eBay pages, and then check the 
User Agreement. (The agreement is revised regularly, so check it often.)

Another helpful link is the FAQ for the User Agreement, which explains the 
legalese in clearer English. To find it, go to

Abuses You Should Report 
to Trust & Safety
Before you even consider blowing the whistle on the guy who (gasp!) gave 
you negative feedback by reporting him to Trust & Safety, make sure that 
what you’re encountering is actually a misuse of eBay. Some behavior isn’t 
nice (no argument there) but it also isn’t a violation of eBay rules — in which 
case, eBay can’t do much about it. The following sections list the primary 
reasons you may start Trust & Safety investigations.
Selling abuses
If you’re on eBay long enough, you’re bound to find an abuse of the service. It 
may happen on an auction you’re bidding on; or a seller whose listings com-
pete with your auctions may do something really, really wrong. Be a good 
community member and be on the lookout for the following:
 
✓ Shill bidding: A seller uses multiple user IDs to bid or has accomplices 
place bids to boost the price of his or her auction items. eBay investiga-
tors look for six telltale signs, including a single bidder putting in a really 
high bid, a bidder with really low feedback but a really high number 
of bids on items, a bidder with low feedback who has been an eBay 
member for a while but who’s never won an auction, or excessive bids 
between two users.
 
✓ Auction interception: An unscrupulous user, pretending to be the actual 
seller, contacts the winner to set up terms of payment and shipping in 
an effort to get the buyer’s payment. You can easily avoid this violation 
by paying directly through the eBay site with PayPal.
 
✓ Fee avoidance: A user reports a lower-than-actual final price or illegally 
submits a final value fee credit, or both. Final value fee credits are explained 
in Chapter 13.
 
✓ Hot bid manipulation: A user, with the help of accomplices, enters 
dozens of phony bids to make the auction appear to have a lot of bid-
ding action. Let the experts at eBay decide on this one; but you may 
wonder if loads of bids come in rapid succession but the price moves 
very little.

310
Part IV: Even More of eBay’s Special Features 
Bidding abuses
If you want to know more about bidding in general, see Chapter 6. Here’s a 
list of bidding abuses that eBay wants to know about:
 
✓ Bid shielding: Two users working in tandem. User A, with the help of 
accomplices, intentionally bids an unreasonably high amount and then 
retracts the bid prior to the 12-hour cancellation deadline of the auction — 
leaving a lower bid (which the offender or an accomplice places) as the 
winning bid.
 
✓ Bid siphoning: Users send e-mail to bidders of a current auction to offer 
the same merchandise for a lower price elsewhere.
 
✓ Auction interference: Users warn other bidders through e-mail to stay 
clear of a seller during a current auction, presumably to decrease the 
number of bids and keep the prices low.
 
✓ Bid manipulation (or invalid bid retraction): A user bids a ridiculously 
high amount, raising the next highest bidder to maximum bid. The 
manipulator then retracts the bid and rebids slightly over the previous 
high bidder’s maximum.
 
✓ Nonpaying bidder: I often call them deadbeats; the bottom line is that 
these people win auctions but never pay up. Your bid on eBay is a legal 
contract to buy if you win, it is not a game.
 
✓ Unwelcome bidder: A user bids on a specific seller’s auction despite the 
seller’s warning that he or she won’t accept that user’s bids (as in the 
case of not selling internationally and receiving international bids). This 
practice is impolite and obnoxious. If you want to bar specific bidders 
from your auctions, you can exclude them. See Chapter 13 for the scoop 
on how to block bidders.
Feedback abuses
All you have on eBay is your reputation, and that reputation is made up of 
your feedback history. eBay takes any violation of its feedback system very 
seriously. Because eBay’s feedback is transaction-related, unscrupulous eBay 
members now have less opportunity to take advantage of this system. Here’s 
a checklist of feedback abuses that will get you into trouble. These can all be 
reported through the Security Center:
 
✓ Feedback extortion: A member threatens to post reputation-destroying 
feedback if another eBay member doesn’t follow through on some 
unwarranted demand. Typical extortion attempts include demanding a 
refund or a generous discount after the bad buyer has won the item.

311
 Chapter 16: Staying Safe and Sane
 
✓ Personal exposure: A member leaves feedback for a user that exposes 
personal information that doesn’t relate to transactions on eBay.
 
✓ Malicious feedback: Writing malicious feedback is a sick game played 
by those who have very little to do with their time but upset upstanding 
eBay sellers. These sickies register on eBay with a new user ID and use 
the Buy It Now function to buy many items from a seller who has a high 
positive feedback rating. A few hours later, they leave dastardly negative 
feedback. The only goal of this action is to ruin the seller’s reputation.
 
✓ –4 Feedback: Any user reaching a Net Feedback score of –4 is subject to 
suspension.
 
Once you post feedback, your words are out there. They become part of 
cyberspace forever and are there for all to see. Your words are a reflection of 
your online persona.
Identity abuses
Who you are on eBay is as important as what you sell (or buy). eBay moni-
tors the identities of its members closely — and asks that you report any 
great pretenders in this area to Trust & Safety. Here’s a checklist of identity 
abuses:
 
✓ Identity misrepresentation: A user claims to be an eBay staff member 
or another eBay user, or he or she registers under the name of another 
user.
 
✓ False or missing contact information: A user deliberately registers with 
fraudulent contact information or an invalid e-mail address. If you come 
across someone on eBay who has false information registered on eBay, 
that member can be suspended.
 
✓ Under age: A user falsely claims to be 18 or older. (You must be at least 
18 to enter into a legally binding contract.)
 
✓ Dead/invalid e-mail addresses: When e-mails bounce repeatedly (single 
bounces are almost a fact of life on the Internet) from a user’s registered 
e-mail address, chances are good that it may be dead — and it’s doing 
nobody any good.
 
✓ Contact information: One user publishes another user’s contact infor-
mation on the eBay site.

312
Part IV: Even More of eBay’s Special Features 
Operational abuses
If you see someone trying to interfere with eBay’s operation, eBay staffers 
want you to tell them about it. Here are two roguish operational abuses:
 
✓ Hacking: A user purposely interferes with eBay’s computer operations 
(for example, by breaking into unauthorized files). If someone attempts 
to alter any of the eBay-generated information in a listing, such as a feed-
back rating or user ID, the person is violating important eBay rules.
 
✓ Spamming: The user sends unsolicited e-mail to eBay users. Just 
because you are in a transaction with someone doesn’t give you the 
right to e-mail the person after the auction is over to solicit future busi-
ness. If you send a newsletter or solicitations, your recipients must have 
opted in to your list. No one has the right to send you e-mail unrelated 
to your transaction without your permission.
Miscellaneous abuses
The following are additional problems that you should alert eBay about:
 
✓ A user is threatening physical harm to another eBay member.
 
✓ A person uses racist, obscene, or harassing language in a public area 
of eBay.

Reporting Abuses to Trust & Safety
If you suspect a seller of abusing eBay’s rules and regulations, you can report 
him or her directly on the item page. Look to the Seller Info box of the page of 
the item in question and click the Report Item link, as shown in Figure 16-2.
When you click that link you’ll come to the only area on eBay where you can 
report listing violations. Select the reason for your report and further infor-
mation from the drop-down menus. Once you’ve made your selections, click 
Continue.

313
 Chapter 16: Staying Safe and Sane
 
Figure 16-2: 
You’ll find 
the Report 
Item link in 
the lower-
right corner 
of the Seller 
Info box.
 
If your issue is connected to a transaction that you’re currently involved in 
with another eBay member, click the Resolve a Problem link on the Security 
Center page discussed earlier. You’re presented with a page that suggests 
answers to the various questions you may have. To actually reach eBay, click 
Contact Us. You’ll land on the Contact Us page, which presents you with 
some of the most basic questions about eBay as well as clickable links to find 
answers. To really (this time I promise) contact eBay, type a short version of 
your question, find the Get in Touch with Us area, and click the Email Us link 
on the right of the page, as shown in Figure 16-3.
When you become a PowerSeller or have an eBay store, you see a different 
page than non-PowerSellers and have considerably more contact options.

If you encounter any of the abuses outlined in this chapter, be sure to report 
the problem. Community policing is what makes eBay work.

314
Part IV: Even More of eBay’s Special Features 
 
The Security Center offers a wealth of good general information that can help 
you prevent something from going wrong in a future transaction. Be sure to 
use these pages regularly as a resource to help prevent problems.
If you’re involved in a troubled transaction and need to launch a report, 
follow these steps:
 
1. Read all the information on the Investigations page (pages.ebay.
com/help/buy/report-trading.html) before filing a new 
complaint.
 
2. Click any of the many informational links.
 
 No matter which link you click, you’re taken to an area that instructs 
you further and provides answers about what offenses eBay can and 
cannot investigate.
 
3. If you’ve found out that you have a legitimate case that should be 
investigated, you are supplied a link to the proper reporting area.
 
 Alternatively, you can click the Report Item link in the Seller Info box on 
your transaction page.
 
If you file a report, make your message clear and concise by including every-
thing that happened — but don’t editorialize. (Calling someone a “lowdown 
mud-sucking cretin” may make you feel better, but it doesn’t provide any 
useful info to anyone who can help you; it doesn’t make you seem very un-
cretin-like, either.) Keep it businesslike — just the facts, ma’am. Do include all 
pertinent documentation, such as e-mails, receipts, and canceled checks — 
and don’t forget the transaction number.
Here’s a checklist of what you should include in your report to Trust & 
Safety:
 
✓ Write only the facts as you know them.
 
✓ Attach any pertinent e-mails with complete headers if required. (Headers 
contain all the information that precedes an e-mail message.) Trust & 
Safety uses the headers to verify how the e-mails were sent and to follow 
the trail back to the originator of the messages. See the sidebar, “Finding 
the hidden headers in an e-mail message” to decipher this information.
 
✓ Be sure that the subject line of your report precisely names the violation.
After eBay receives your report via the Customer Service form, you usually 
get an automatic response that your e-mail was received — although in prac-
tice, several days may go crawling by before eBay investigates your allega-
tions. (The Customer Service Department must look at a lot of transactions.)

315
 Chapter 16: Staying Safe and Sane
 
Depending on the outcome of the probe, eBay may contact you with the 
results. If your problem becomes a legal matter, eBay may not let you know 
what’s going on. The only indication you may get that some action was 
taken is that the eBay member you reported is suspended — or NARU (Not A 
Registered User).
If your complaint doesn’t warrant an investigation by the folks at Trust & 
Safety, they pass it along to someone at the overworked Customer Support 
staff, who then contacts you. (Don’t bawl out the person if the attention you 
get is tardy.)
 
Unfortunately, NARU members can show up again on the eBay site. Typically 
nefarious sorts as these just use a different name and credit card to register 
back on the site. In fact, this practice is common, so beware! If you suspect 
that someone who broke the rules once is back under another user ID, alert 
Trust & Safety. If you’re a seller, you can refuse to accept bids from that 
person. If the person persists, alert Customer Support with e-mail.
As eBay has grown, so has the number of complaints about slow response 
from Customer Support. I don’t doubt that eBay staffers are doing their best. 
Although slow response can get frustrating, avoid the temptation to initiate a 
reporting blitzkrieg by sending reports over and over until eBay can’t ignore 
you. This practice is risky at best and inconsiderate at worst, and it just 
slows the process for everyone — and won’t endear the e-mail bombardier to 
the folks who could help. It’s better to just grin and bear it and wait for action 
to be taken.
Finding the hidden headers in an e-mail message
Most of the time, the headers in an e-mail mes-

If you’re desperate for help and can’t get satisfaction, you can post a message 
with your problem in one of the eBay chat rooms. eBay members participat-
ing in chat rooms often share the names of helpful staffers. Often you can 
find some eBay members who faced the same problem (sometimes with the 
same member) and can offer advice — or at the very least, compassion and a 
virtual ear. (Jump to Chapter 17 for more info on discussion boards and chat 
rooms.)
 
If you’re a PowerSeller, you can easily contact PowerSeller support with your 
immediate problem.
 
Make sure that you don’t violate any eBay rules by sharing any member’s 
contact information as you share your story in a chat room. In addition, make 
sure that you don’t threaten or libel (that is, say untrue things or spread 
rumors about) the person in your posting.
Stuff eBay Won’t Do Anything About
People are imperfect everywhere, even online. (Ya think?) You probably 
won’t agree with some of the behavior that you run into on eBay (ranging 
from slightly annoying to just plain rotten). Although much of that conduct is 
just plain nasty, it can (and does) go on as long as it doesn’t break eBay rules.
In some cases, you may need to bite your tongue and chalk up someone’s 
annoying behavior to ignorance of the unwritten rules of eBay etiquette. Just 
because people have computers and some things to sell or buy doesn’t mean 
that they possess grown-up social skills. (But you knew that.)
Here’s a gang of annoying issues that crop up pretty regularly but that aren’t 
against eBay’s rules and regulations:
Emergency help
For general, all-purpose help, eBay has a 
Customer Support e-mail response form that 
will get you an answer within 12 to 36 hours. 
You can find Customer Support creatively

us/_base/index_selection.html

 Chapter 16: Staying Safe and Sane
 
✓ A seller sets astronomical shipping costs: eBay policy says that ship-
ping costs must be reasonable. Basically, eBay is wagging its finger and 
saying, “Don’t gouge your buyers.” When sellers gouge their buyers 
with high shipping fees, eBay penalizes them in their Best Match search 
results. Some sellers try to avoid fees or may be disappointed that a sale 
didn’t make enough money, so they think that by jacking up shipping 
costs they will increase their profit.
 
 Under the rules, eBay will stop someone from charging excessive amounts 
for shipping. For more information on eBay’s Excessive Shipping policy, 
go to pages.ebay.com/help/policies/listing-shipping.html.
 
 Bidders should always check shipping terms in the Item description. 
Bidders must decide whether to agree to those terms before they bid. 
The best way to protect yourself from being swindled is to buy only 
from a seller whose shipping costs feel fair to you.
 
✓ A seller or buyer refuses to meet the terms that you mutually set: eBay 
has the power only to warn or suspend members. It can’t make anyone 
do anything — even someone who’s violating a policy. If you want to 
make someone fulfill a transaction, you’re more or less on your own. I 
heard one story of a seller who refused to send a product after being 
paid. The seller said, “Come and get it.” The buyer happened to be in 
town on business and did just that!
 
 But if your item never arrives, you can apply to PayPal for a refund 
under the Buyer Protection plan. Information on how to file is further 
on in this chapter.
 
 Often, reluctant eBay buyers just need a nudge from eBay in the form of 
a warning to comply. So go ahead and file a final value fee credit request 
(I explain how to do this in Chapter 13) and, if necessary, a fraud report 
(more on fraud reports later in this chapter).
 
✓ An eBay member sends unwanted e-mail messages (spam): In fact, 
members can send spam using eBay’s own tools. All the user has to do 
is access the Contact a Member Form by clicking a member’s user ID. 
eBay sees non-transaction–related communication as spam; you need to 
report any member who abuses this system. (You’ll see a reporting link 
on any e-mail sent through the eBay system). Although the items spam-
mers are selling may be perfectly good, eBay won’t offer you any protec-
tion if you participate in off-the-site deals. I suggest that you ignore these 
deals and avoid doing business with them in the future.
 
New eBay users are often the unwitting perpetrators of annoying behavior, but 
you’re ahead of the pack now that you know what not to do. You can afford to 
cut the other newbies some slack and help them learn the ropes before you 
report them.

Knowing the Deeds That 
Can Get You Suspended
Playing by eBay’s rules keeps you off the Trust & Safety radar screen. If you 
start violating eBay policy, the company’s going to keep a close eye on you. 
Depending on the infraction, eBay may be all over you like jelly on peanut 
butter. Or you may safely lurk in the fringes until your feedback rating is 
lower than the temperature in Nome in November.
Here’s a docket of eBay no-no’s that can get a member’s permanent record 
damaged — and possibly suspended:
 
✓ Feedback rating of –4
 
✓ Three instances of deadbeat bidding with three different sellers
 
✓ Repeated warning for the same infraction
 
✓ Feedback extortion
 
✓ Bid shielding
 
✓ Unwelcome bidding after a warning from the seller
 
✓ Shill bidding
 
✓ Auction interception
 
✓ Fee avoidance
 
✓ Fraudulent selling
 
✓ Identity misrepresentation
 
✓ Bidding when younger than age 18
 
✓ Hacking
 
✓ Physical threats
 
If you get a suspension but think you’re innocent, respond directly to the 
person who suspended you to plead your case. Reversals do occur. Don’t 
broadcast your suspicions on chat boards. If you’re wrong, you may regret it. 
Even if you’re right, it’s oh-so-gauche.
 
Be careful about accusing members of cheating. Unless you’re involved in a 
transaction, you don’t know all the facts. Law & Order moments are great on 
television, but they’re fictional for a reason. In real life, drawing yourself into a 
possible confrontation is senseless. Start the complaint process, keep it busi-
nesslike, and let eBay’s staff figure out what’s going on.

319
 Chapter 16: Staying Safe and Sane
Getting Buyer Protection
One thing’s for sure in this world: Nothing is for sure. That’s why insurance 
companies exist. Several types of insurance are available for eBay users:
 
✓ Insurance that buyers purchase to cover shipping (see Chapter 12)
 
✓ SquareTrade warranties
 
✓ BuySAFE bonds
 
✓ PayPal’s Buyer Protection
To cover loss from fraud, eBay buyers can avail themselves of several protec-
tion programs. The basic PayPal protection covers money that you pay for 
an item you never receive (as a result of fraud, not shipping problems) or 
receive but find to be materially different from the auction item’s description.
eBay Motors Vehicle Protection Program
Another beneficial eBay venture is eBay’s Vehicle Protection Program, which 
offers a free limited warranty to anyone who purchases a car on eBay. Look 
for the Vehicle Protection Program Shield at the bottom of the Seller Info box 
to see whether the vehicle you’re interested in is covered. Qualified cars are 
identified in the listing description in the Item Specifics box, with the words 
Vehicle Protection Program up to $50,000.
Your vehicle purchase is protected for up to $50,000 or the vehicle purchase 
price, whichever is lower. You can find more information at eBay Motors:
pages.motors.ebay.com/buy/purchase-protection/index.html
PayPal Buyer Protection
Aside from safety, now PayPal offers an even better reason to pay through 
its service. If you’ve purchased your item through a PayPal-verified seller, 
you’re covered for your original purchase price, plus shipping. This protec-
tion covers you only for nondelivery of tangible items and tangible items that 
are received significantly not as described — not if you are disappointed with 
the item.
 
If you’ve paid with a credit card through PayPal, be sure to make a claim with 
eBay first and then with PayPal. Do not make a claim with your credit card 
company. PayPal Buyer Protection is for PayPal purchases, and you’re not 
covered if you’ve made a claim with your credit card company.

Several types of protection are available to eBay buyers, as shown in 
Table 16-1.
Table 16-1 
eBay Shopper’s Assurance
Type 
Who Pays
Explanation
Shipping insurance
Buyer
As the buyer, you must pay the seller the 
additional charge for package insurance. 
This will cover your purchase up to the 
insured amount while the item is in tran-
sit through the U. S. Post Office, UPS, or 
FedEx.
PayPal buyer 
No 
charge
eBay agrees that you’ve been defrauded 
if you’ve paid for your purchase through 
PayPal up to your purchase price.
BuySAFE bond
Seller
BuySAFE bonds back a preferred seller’s 
performance on the item, up to $25,000.
SquareTrade Seal 
Seller
There is no warranty if you have been 
defrauded by a SquareTrade Seal member. 
Note that the Seal only assures the buyer 
that the seller’s positive feedback remains 
constant.
BuySAFE bond
BuySAFE helps make online auctions safer. The “BuySAFE with the Hartford” 
program offers one of the highest levels of protection available to online 
auction participants. It’s the only program that enables sellers to present a 
credibility seal and financially protect their online auction transactions with 
surety bonds.
BuySAFE comprehensively qualifies sellers to display the BuySAFE seal. 
When a buyer sees the BuySAFE seal on an auction or fixed-price listing, the 
transaction is 100% guaranteed to be exactly as listed.

321
 Chapter 16: Staying Safe and Sane
SquareTrade warranties
Granted, a SquareTrade warranty is designed to help you after you’ve 
received the product as described, but that’s when most items break for me. 
You can buy these highly discounted (40% lower than most retailers) warran-
ties from SquareTrade on almost any electronic item you purchase on eBay 
against breakage. The warranty is simple and straightforward.
To purchase a warranty after you’ve bought a qualifying product on eBay, 
go to

Launching a Fraud Report
The second that you complain about a seller who’s taken money but hasn’t 
delivered the goods, a Trust & Safety investigation automatically starts. The 
Resolution Center is where you can go to file a formal complaint when you 
run into trouble with a transaction.
To get to the Resolution Center, click the Help link in the eBay navigation 
bar and choose Resolution Center, or click the Resolution Center link, which 
appears at the bottom of most eBay pages. You can get to the Resolution 
Center also from your listing in My eBay, in which case your item number will 
be filled in on the form for you:
 
1. Go to your My eBay page.
 
2. In the Buy area, click the link to take you to the items you’ve won.
 
3. Scroll down the page to find the item in question and choose Resolve 
a Problem from the pull-down menu.
 
 The Resolution Center’s Resolve a Problem form appears
 
4. Choose the problem you are having in your transaction and click 
Continue.
 
 Now you get to the Report an Item Not Received or Not as Described 
form. If you arrived at the Resolution Center from your item listing, your 
item number is already filled in. If you got there from the link in the navi-
gation bar, you have to enter the item number.
 
5. Click Continue.
 
6. Tell eBay how you paid for this item.
 
 If you paid by PayPal you are sent to the Resolution page.

322
Part IV: Even More of eBay’s Special Features 
 
7. Review your case details, and then click Open Case.
 
 The Your Case Is Now Open page appears and tells you that your trading 
partner has been notified and has 10 days to respond. From here on, you 
can continue your dealings in the Resolution Center.
 
To file a claim with eBay, you must initiate the complaint process no sooner 
than 7 days and no later than 45 days after the close of the listing. Be careful 
not to jump the gun and register a complaint too soon. I suggest waiting about 
two or three weeks before you register your complaint about an Item Not 
Received (an item lost in the mail can often take as long as 30 days to arrive); 
double-check first to make sure that your e-mail is working and that you have 
the correct contact information of the person with whom you’re having diffi-
culties. After all, neither eBay nor your ISP is infallible.
After you register a complaint, eBay informs the other party that you’re 
making a claim. eBay says it will try to contact both parties and help reach a 
resolution. Registering the complaint is not the same thing as filing an insur-
ance complaint. Registering starts the process; filing for a refund comes after 
a month-long grace period if the situation isn’t resolved by then.
If you’ve clearly been ripped off, use the Item Not Received or Significantly 
Not as Described process to file a complaint. Just scroll to the Links area at 
the bottom of the page and click the Security & Resolution Center link.
 
A shortcut to file for an Item Not Received or Significantly Not as Described, 
go directly to the form at feedback.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?
InrCreateDispute.
 
If the accusation you’re registering is a clear violation, eBay gives you informa-
tion on the kind of third-party assistance you can get to help resolve the prob-
lem. If eBay deems the problem a violation of the law, it reports the crime to 
the appropriate law-enforcement agency.
Getting the Real Deal? Authentication 
and Appraising
Despite eBay’s attempts to keep the buying and selling community honest, 
some people just refuse to play nice. After the New York City Department of 
Consumer Affairs launched an investigation into counterfeit sports memo-
rabilia sold on the Web site, errant eBay outlaws experienced some anxious 
moments. I can always hope they mend their ways, while at the same time 
advising Don’t bet on it. Fortunately, eBay offers a proactive approach to pre-
venting such occurrences from happening again.

323
 Chapter 16: Staying Safe and Sane
Topmost among the countermeasures is easy member access to several ser-
vices that can authenticate specific types of merchandise. The good news 
here is that you know what kind of item you’re getting; the bad news is that, 
as does everything else in life, it costs you money.
 
Have a good working knowledge of what you’re buying or selling. Before you 
bid, do some homework and get more information. And check the seller’s or 
bidder’s feedback. (Does this advice sound familiar?) See Chapters 5 and 9 for 
more information about conducting research.
 
Before you spend the money to have your item appraised and authenticated, 
ask yourself a few practical questions (regardless of whether you’re buying or 
selling):
 
✓ Is this item quality merchandise? Am I selling or buying merchandise 
whose condition is subjective but important to its value — as in, Is it 
really well-loved or just busted? Is this item graded by some profession-
ally accepted standard that I need to know?
 
✓ Is this item the real thing? Am I sure that I’m selling or buying a genuine 
item? Do I need an expert to tell me whether it’s the real McCoy?
 
✓ Do I know the value of the merchandise? Do I have a good understand-
ing of what this item’s worth in the marketplace at this time, considering 
its condition?
 
✓ Is the merchandise worth the price? Is the risk of selling or buying a 
counterfeit, a fake, or an item I don’t completely understand worth the 
cost of an appraisal?
If you answer “yes” to any of these questions, consider calling in a profes-
sional appraiser.
As for selling a counterfeit item — otherwise known as a knock-off, phony, or 
five-finger-discount item — that’s a no-brainer: No way. Don’t do it.
If you need items appraised, consider using an appraisal agency. You can 
access several agencies by going to the overview page at pages.ebay.com/
help/buy/authentication.html. eBay offers links to various appraising 
agencies that offer their services at a discount to eBay members:
 
✓ The PCGS (Professional Coin Grading Service) and NGC (Numismatic 
Guaranty Corporation) serve coin collectors. Visit www.pcgs.com/
cobrands/index.chtml?cobrandid=24 and www.ngccoin.com/
ebay_ngcvalue.cfm.
 
✓ PSA/DNA (a service of Professional Sports Authenticators) and Online 
Authentics.com authenticate your autographs. Both keep online data-
bases of thousands of certified autographs for you to compare your 

324
Part IV: Even More of eBay’s Special Features 
purchases against. Their respective online addresses are www.
psacard.com and www.onlineauthentics.com.
 
✓ Global Authentication, Inc. are specialists in authenticating autographs 
and memorabilia from the sports world. See www.globalauth.com.
 
✓ PSE (Professional Stamp Experts) authenticates your postal stamps: 
www.psestamp.com.
 
✓ CGC (Comics Guaranty) grades and restores comic books. Visit www.
cgccomics.com/ebay_comic_book_grading.cfm.
 
✓ IGI (International Gemological Institute) grades, authenticates, and iden-
tifies loose gemstones and jewelry. Visit www.e-igi.com/ebay.
 
✓ PSA (Professional Sports Authenticators) and SGC (Sportscard 
Guaranty) help guard against counterfeiting and fraud with sports 
memorabilia and trading cards. eBay has teamed up with these services 
to grade and authenticate trading cards. You can visit the respective 
addresses of these agencies at www.psacard.com and www.sgccard.
com/ebay/.
 
Even if you use an appraiser or an authentication service, do some legwork 
yourself. Often, two experts can come up with wildly different opinions on the 
same item. The more you know, the better the questions you can ask.
If a seller isn’t sure whether the item he or she is auctioning is authentic, you 
may find an appropriate comment (such as Cannot verify authenticity) in the 
item description. Knowledgeable eBay gurus always like to share what they 
know, and I have no doubt that someone on the appropriate chat board may 
be able to supply you with scads of helpful information. But be careful — 
some blarney artist (one of those is born every minute, too) may try to make 
a sucker out of you.
ID Verify
During the later years of the Cold War, Ronald Reagan said, “Trust but 
verify.” The President’s advice made sense for dealing with the old Soviet 
Union, and it makes good sense with your dealings on eBay, too! (Even if 
you’re not dealing in nuclear warheads.)
To show other eBay members that you’re an honest type — and to get spe-
cial privileges when you’re a newbie on eBay, you can buy a “trust but verify” 
option, known as ID Verify, from eBay for five bucks. The giant credit verifica-
tion service, VeriSign, verifies your identity by asking for your wallet informa-
tion, including the following:

325
 Chapter 16: Staying Safe and Sane
 
✓ Name
 
✓ Address
 
✓ Phone number
 
✓ Social Security number
 
✓ Driver’s license information
 
✓ Date of birth
VeriSign matches the info you give to what’s in its database, and presents 
you with a list of questions from your credit file that only you should know 
the answer to. VeriSign may also ask you about any loans you have (for exam-
ple) or what kinds of credit cards you own (and how many).
Becoming ID-Verified can be a bonus for new users. It allows you to bypass 
some of eBay’s more stringent requirements for participating in higher-level 
deals. By making sure that the community knows you’re really who you say 
you are, you can get the green light for some higher-level activities:
 
✓ Run auctions with the Buy-It-Now option: Ordinarily you need a feed-
back rating of 10 to run a Buy-It-Now auction. This privilege may be 
worth the price of the verification, but honestly, how hard is it really to 
get your first 10 feedbacks? Besides, the experience will be priceless.
 
✓ Open an eBay store: Although eBay requires a feedback rating of only 
20 to open a store, I suggest you have much more. An eBay store (see 
Chapter 11 for more information) requires a bit more eBay savvy than 
the newbie seller can muster.
 
✓ Run fixed-price sales offering multiple items): Ordinarily, an eBay seller 
must have more than a 30 feedback rating to perform this type of sale.
 
✓ Bid on items over $15,000: Some form of verification is usually even 
required of eBay’s old-timers when bidding this high!
 
✓ Sell items in the Adults Only Category
 
VeriSign sends only the results of its Identity Test to eBay (whether you pass 
the test) and not the answers to the private financial questions it asks you. 
VeriSign doesn’t modify or add the information you provide to any of its 
databases.
VeriSign’s questions are meant to protect you against anyone else who may 
come along and try to steal this information from you and assume your iden-
tity. The questions aren’t a credit check, and your creditworthiness is never 
called into question. This info simply verifies that you are who you say you are.

326
Part IV: Even More of eBay’s Special Features 
If you pass the test and VeriSign can verify that you are who you say you are 
(and not your evil twin), you get a cool icon by your name for a year. If, after 
a year, you like the validation that comes from such verification, you can pay 
another fee and renew your seal.
Although you can feel secure knowing that a user who’s verified is indeed 
who he or she claims to be, you still have no guarantee that he or she’s not 
going to turn out to be a no-goodnik (or, for that matter, a well-meaning finan-
cial airhead) during auction transactions.
 
Even if an eBay member gets VeriSign verification, what makes this program 
so controversial is twofold:
 
✓ Many members object to giving out Social Security numbers. They see it 
as an unwarranted invasion of privacy.
 
✓ Some users also fear that this system creates a two-tiered eBay system, 
with verified users occupying a sort of upper class and anyone who’s 
not verified stuck in the lower class. They’re afraid that sellers may 
refuse to do business with unverified users.
 
You should consider all of eBay’s current and future programs for protecting 
you from problematic transactions and people, but I think the “undisputed 
heavyweight champ” for finding out who someone really is (and keeping you 
out of trouble) is the first program eBay created. That’s right, folks: feedback 
can show you other eBay members’ track records and give you the best 
information on whether you want to do business with them or take a pass. 
Feedback is especially effective if you analyze it in conjunction with eBay’s 
other protection programs. I suggest taking the time to read all about feed-
back in Chapter 4.
If It’s Clearly Fraud
After filing either a fraud report or a final value fee credit request, you can 
do more on your own. If the deal involves the post office in any way — if you 
mail a check or the seller sends you merchandise that’s completely wrong 
and refuses to make good — file a mail-fraud complaint with the postal 
inspector.
 
In the United States, you can call your local post office or dial 800-275-8777 for 
a form to fill out. After you complete the form, the USPS sends the eBay bad 
guy a notice that you’ve filed a fraud complaint. Perhaps that will get his or 
her attention.

327
 Chapter 16: Staying Safe and Sane
In addition to the post office, you can turn to some other agencies for help:
 
✓ The National Fraud Information Center: NFIC has an online site 
devoted to combating fraud on the Internet. NFIC works closely with 
legal authorities. File a claim at www.fraud.org/info/repoform.htm 
or call toll free at 800-876-7060.
 
✓ Law enforcement agencies: Contact the local district attorney (or state 
Attorney General’s office) and the local and state Consumer Affairs 
Department in the other person’s state and city. (Look online for contact 
information or try your local agencies for contact numbers.)
 
✓ Federal Trade Commission: The FTC accepts complaints and investi-
gates repeated cases of fraud. File a claim at www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/
microsites/idtheft/consumers/filing-a-report.html.
 
✓ Internet service provider: Contact the member’s ISP. You can get this 
bit of info from the person’s e-mail address, just after the @ symbol. 
(See? This easy access to information does have its advantages.) Let 
the ISP know whom you have filed a complaint against, the nature of the 
problem, and the agencies that you’ve contacted.
 
Any time you contact another agency for help, keep Trust & Safety up to date 
on your progress by writing to its representatives the old-fashioned way. 
Address your letter to eBay ATTN: Fraud Prevention, 2145 Hamilton Ave., San 
Jose, CA 95125.
 
A very thin line separates alerting other members to a particular person’s 
poor behavior and breaking an eBay cardinal rule by interfering with an auc-
tion. Don’t make unfounded or vitriolic accusations — especially if you were 
counting on them never getting back to the person they were about (or, for 
that matter, if you hoped they would). Trample the poison out of the gripes 
of wrath before you have your say. I recommend that you hunt for facts, but 
don’t do any finger-pointing on public message boards or chat rooms. If it 
turns out that you’re wrong, you can be sued for libel.
 
Communication and compromise are the keys to successful transactions. If 
you have a difference of opinion, write a polite e-mail outlining your expecta-
tions and offer to settle any dispute by phone. See Chapters 12 and 13 for tips 
on communicating after the auction ends — and solving disputes before they 
turn wicked, aggressive, or unprintable.

Bay is more than just an Internet location for buying and selling great 
stuff. eBay wants the world to know that it has created (and works hard 
to maintain) a community. It’s not a bad deal — prime real estate in this com-
munity costs only pennies! As in real-life communities, you participate as 
much as works for you. You can get involved in all sorts of neighborhood 
activities, or you can just sit back, mind your own business, and watch the 
world go by. eBay works exactly the same way.
As you’ve probably heard by now, one of the main ways to participate in the 
eBay community is through feedback (which I explain in detail in Chapters 
4 and 6). In this chapter, I show you some other ways to become part of the 
community. You can socialize (making friends who live in your community 
or who live across the planet), learn from other members, post messages, 
or just read what everybody’s talking about on eBay’s discussion boards, 
groups, chat boards, and the corporate Announcements Board. I include tips 
on how to use all these places to your benefit, and then give you a change of 
scenery by surfing through some off-site message boards that can help you 
with your buying and selling.
On eBay’s navigation bar, click the Community link to connect to the hap-
penings on eBay; I use it regularly to check proposed changes to the site

gives you other ways to express yourself (links to all these pages are also on 
the main Community page):
 
✓ Neighborhoods: Have a hobby? Maybe enjoy an old series of TV shows 
or a movie? (No cracks about my being a member of the Star Trek 
Neighborhood.) Search eBay’s Neighborhoods and see if there’s a group 
you might want to join. The main page (where you can search the vari-
ous neighborhoods) is at http://neighborhoods.ebay.com.
 
✓ Reviews: Wondering what other eBay members think of a particular 
product, book, or movie? Visit eBay’s Reviews to find out. Better yet, 
contribute one of your own. Reviews show up when a search is made on 
an item for which eBay users have posted reviews. Figure 17-2 shows a 
review written by an eBay member on one of my books.

Hear Ye, Hear Ye! eBay’s 
Announcements Boards
If you were living in the 1700s, you’d see a strangely dressed guy in a funny 
hat ringing a bell and yelling, “Hear ye, hear ye!” every time you opened 
eBay’s announcements boards. (Then again, if you were living in the 1700s, 
you’d have no electricity, computers, fast food, or anything else you prob-
ably consider fun.) In any case, eBay’s announcements boards are the most 
important place to find out what’s going on (directly from the home office) 
on the Web site. And no one even needs to ring a bell.
The General Announcements Board is where eBay lists any new features and 
policy changes. Visiting this page is like reading your morning eBay newspa-
per because eBay adds comments to this page almost every day. You find out 
about upcoming changes in categories, new promotions, and eBay goings-on. 

333
 Chapter 17: The eBay Community: Joining In with Other eBay Members
eBay also uses it to help users become aware of critical changes in policies 
and procedures. Reach this page at www2.ebay.com/aw/marketing.shtml. 
Figure 17-4 shows you eBay’s General Announcements Board with informa-
tion that could affect your sales.

eBay has over 200 million members — a bigger population than some 
countries — but it can still have that small-town feel through groups, chat 
boards, and discussion boards. Start on the main Connect area (refer to 
Figure 17-1) by clicking Community on the navigation bar. Then click the 
links below. You can access more than two dozen category-specific chats 
(although I’m not quite sure what’s discussed in the Furbies Board these 
days), as well as a bunch of general chats, discussion boards, and help 
discussion boards.
Help! I Need Somebody
If you ever have specific eBay questions to which you need answers, several 
eBay discussion boards on the Community: Connect page can help you. You 
can also go directly to the chat rooms to pose your question to the eBay 
members currently in residence.

334
Part IV: Even More of eBay’s Special Features 
Boards work differently than chat rooms. Chat rooms are full of people who 
are hanging out talking to each other all at the same time, whereas users of 
discussion boards tend to go in, leave a message or ask a question, and pop 
out again. Also, in a discussion board, you need to start a thread by asking 
a question. Title your thread with your question, and you’ll no doubt get a 
swift answer to your query.
 
Many questions can be answered by going to eBay’s Answer Center, which 
you can get to by clicking the Answer Center link in the Connect area. You 
then see boards covering almost any topic regarding selling and buying on 
eBay. Just post your question and some kind eBay member will probably sug-
gest an answer (but remember to take that advice with a grain of salt, just as 
you would any advice from someone with unknown credentials).
 
eBay newbies often find that the boards are good places to add to their knowl-
edge of eBay. As you scroll by, read past the postings; your question may 
already be answered in an earlier posting. You can even ask someone on a 
chat or discussion board to look at your auction listing and provide an opin-
ion on your descriptions or pictures.
Community Chat Rooms
Because sending e-mail to eBay’s Customer Service people can be frustrat-
ingly slow if you need an answer right away (they get bombarded with a gazil-
lion questions a day), you may want to try for a faster answer by posting your 
question on one of the Community chat rooms.
 
Knowledgeable veteran eBay members generally answer posted questions as 
best (and as quickly) as they can. The answers are the opinions of members 
and are certainly not eBay gospel. But you get a fast and honest answer; often 
you get more than one response. Most questions are answered in about 15 min-
utes. If not, repost your question. Make sure that you post your question on the 
appropriate board because each board has a specific topic of discussion.
If a new policy or some sort of big change occurs, the boards are most likely 
going to quickly fill with discussion about it. On slow days, however, you may 
need to wade through endless personal messages and “chat” with no con-
nection to eBay. Many of the people who post on these boards are long-time 
members with histories (as well as feuds) that can rival any soap opera. On a 
rare occasion, the personal postings can get rather nasty. Getting involved in 
personality clashes or verbal warfare gains nothing and wastes your valuable 
time.

335
 Chapter 17: The eBay Community: Joining In with Other eBay Members
 
One cardinal rule for eBay chat boards and message boards exists: no busi-
ness. No advertising items for sale! Not now. Not ever. eBay bans any repeat 
offenders who break this rule from participating on these boards.
Remember that you’re visiting eBay and that you’re a member. It’s not Speakers’ 
Corner — that spot in a London park where protesters are free to stand on 
a soapbox and scream about the rats in government. If you feel the need to 
viciously complain about eBay, take it outside, as the bar bouncers say.
User-to-User Discussion Boards
eBay has some other boards that take a different tack on things. They’re 
discussion boards as opposed to chat boards, which basically means that 
the topics are deliberately open-ended — just as the topics of discussions in 
coffee houses tend to vary depending on who happens to be in them at any 
given time. Check out these areas and read ongoing discussions about eBay’s 
latest buzz. It’s a lot of fun and good reading. Post your opinions to the 
category that suits you. You can find tons of discussion boards on various 
topics relating to doing business on eBay, but my favorites are in the General 
Discussion area. Each discussion board carries as many topics as you can 
imagine. Here are few of my favorites:
 
✓ The eBay Town Square is a potpourri of various subjects and topics.
 
✓ The Soapbox is the place to voice your views and suggestions to help 
build a better eBay.
 
✓ NightOwls Nest is the fun locale for creatures of the night and their unique 
postings. (As I’m writing this, for example, there’s a thread with spirited 
advice to a community member who needs help with his “gassy” cat.)
 
✓ eBay Live is a big eBay user convention. Stop by this board to get a 
bird’s-eye view of the happenings from the previous year’s summit. You 
can also find out what’s in store for the upcoming soiree.
 
✓ The Park is an interesting place where community members join in for 
fun ideas and threads.
Other Chat Rooms (Message Boards)
About a dozen chat rooms at eBay specialize in everything from pure chat to 
charity work. The following sections describe a few of these boards.

336
Part IV: Even More of eBay’s Special Features 
Café society
The eBay Café (eBay’s first chat board from back when they were just selling 
Pez candy dispensers) and AOL Café message boards attract mostly regulars 
chatting about eBay gossip. Frequent postings include the sharing of per-
sonal milestones and whatever else is on people’s minds. You can also find 
useful information about eBay and warnings about potential scams here.
Holiday Chat Room
Although eBay suggests that this is the place to share your favorite holiday 
memories and thoughts, it’s really a friendly place where people meet and 
chat about home and family. Stop by for cybermilk and cookies next time you 
have a few minutes and want to visit with your fellow auction addicts.
Giving Works Board
eBay isn’t only about making money. On the Giving Works Board, it’s also 
about making a difference. Members in need post their stories and requests 
for assistance. Other members with items to donate post offers for every-
thing from school supplies to clothing on this board.
 
If you feel like doing a good deed and conduct a member benefit auction, click 
the eBay Giving Works link on the Discussion Board page. For more on charity 
auctions see Chapter 18.
The eBay Friends from All Over 
discussion Board
People from all around the world enjoy eBay. If you’re considering buying or 
selling globally, visit the eBay Friends from All Over Board. It’s a great place 
to post questions about shipping and payments for overseas transactions. 
Along with eBay chat, this board turns up discussions about current events 
and international politics.

Category-Specific Chat Boards
Want to talk about Elvis, Louis XV, Sammy Sosa, or Howard the Duck? 
Currently over 20 category-specific chat boards enable you to tell eBay mem-
bers what’s on your mind about merchandise and auctions. You reach these 
boards by clicking Community on the main navigation bar and then clicking 
Chat in the Connect area.
Of course, you can buy and sell without ever going on a chat board, but you 
can certainly learn a lot from one. Discussions mainly focus on merchandise 
and the nuts and bolts of transactions. Category-specific chat boards are 
great for posting questions on items that you don’t know much about.
 
On eBay, you get all kinds of responses from all kinds of people. Take a por-
tion of the help you get with a grain of salt because some of the folks who help 
you may be buyers or competitors.
 
Don’t be shy. As your second-grade teacher said, “No questions are dumb.” 
Most eBay members love to share their knowledge of items.
eBay Groups
If you’re the friendly type and would like an instant group of new friends, I 
suggest that you click the link in the Connect area to eBay Groups. Here you 
can find thousands of user groups, hosted on eBay but run by eBay com-
munity members. They may be groups consisting of people from the same 
geographic area, those with similar hobbies, or those interested in buying or 
selling in particular categories.
eBay Groups may be public groups (open to all) or private clubs with their 
own private boards. Only invited members of a private group can access a 
private board.
Joining a group is easy: Just click any of the links on the main Groups page 
and you’re presented with a dizzying array of groups to join. Your best bet 
though, is to participate in chats or discussions, and find other members that 
you’d like to join up with.

338
Part IV: Even More of eBay’s Special Features 
Blog It on eBay
A recent addition is eBay’s Blogs area. Here’s where any eBay member can 
start his or her own online posting page. You can share your opinions and 
ideas with the entire Internet universe, directly from eBay. I find reading 
other members’ blogs a fun pastime; plus you get to learn a little more about 
the faces behind the user IDs. Blogs do not replace the all-important About 
Me page, but a blog can be a fun pastime and fun for all your friends to read. 
Keep in mind, I said a pastime. If your plan is to learn to sell on eBay, study 
this book and lots of PowerSeller listings on the site. Go and list some test 
items rather than spending precious moments playing here. But if time is not 
of the essence, have fun.

Chapter 18
eBay’s Fun Features
In This Chapter
▶ Buying for a good cause
▶ Using eBay’s member specials
▶ Buying souvenirs at The eBay Shop
▶ Calling free with Skype
▶ Getting a personal cyber-shopper
N
o one can say that eBay isn’t fun! The eBay staff is always trying to 
work with the community by filling needs and finding fun stuff to keep 
us happy. In this chapter, I show you how eBay members can get great inside 
deals from manufacturers, and I open the door of The eBay Shop, where you 
can get T-shirts and coffee cups with the official eBay logo on them. I also 
show you how you can help your favorite charity earn some well-deserved 
cash at eBay’s charity auctions.
Over and over, eBay members show what big hearts they have. Yes, you 
actually can pocket some nice-sized profits from selling on the eBay Web site, 
but (just as in real life) people usually take the time to give a little back for 
worthy causes. But because we’re talking about eBay, giving back means get-
ting something fabulous in return.
Truly Righteous Stuff for Charity
Most of us have donated to charity in one form or another. But here on eBay, 
charities really rock. Do you need a Jurassic Park helmet signed by Steven 
Spielberg to round out your collection (and deflect the odd dino tooth)? Post 
a bid on one of the charity auctions. How about a signed original photograph 
of Jerry Seinfeld from People magazine? Yup, you can get that, too. All these 
and more have turned up in charity auctions. In short, having a big heart for 
charities has gotten a whole lot easier thanks to eBay.

eBay Giving Works
November 2003 was a lucky time for this country’s charities. That’s the 
month that eBay launched the eBay Giving Works Charity auction area. 
Smartly, the folks on eBay teamed up with one of the finest charity sites 
on the Internet, MissionFish. MissionFish, a service of the Points of Light 
Foundation, has been around since early 2000 and has enabled charities to 
raise hundreds of thousands of dollars by turning in-kind donations into 
cash. The eBay community has helped raise close to $200 million so far.
If you’re involved with a charity, you can register your charity to get on the 
list of beneficiaries. You can also run your own fundraising events on eBay! 
Just go to www.ebaygivingworks.com or click the Giving Works link on the 
left side of the eBay home page and you’ll arrive at the Giving Works hub (as 
in Figure 18-1).
 
Figure 18-1: 
Where eBay 
buyers and 
sellers work 
for good.
 
The best part about this new system is that you can run an auction to benefit 
your favorite charity. eBay sellers can list items for sale and designate those 
items to benefit a charity from the MissionFish directory of thousands of 
charities. The seller can also specify what percentage (from as little as 10 up 
to 100 percent) of the auction proceeds go to the charity. At the end of the 

341
 Chapter 18: eBay’s Fun Features
sale, MissionFish e-mails a tax receipt to the seller. You can browse to select 
the charity of your choice on the Giving Works page. When you list your item 
for sale, you can indicate on the Sell form’s Create Your Listing section which 
charity, and what percentage of the final sale price, you’d like to donate 
proceeds.
 
As you visit different areas of eBay, you can recognize the charity auctions by 
the small blue ribbon icon next to them in searches and the Category list.
Creative charity auctions
New charities are popping up all the time on eBay. To see the auctions that 
are running, go to the Charity page by starting on eBay’s home page and 
clicking the Giving Works (Charity) link on the left side of the screen. Here 
are some of the more creative charity auctions that have been held on eBay:
 
✓ The highest grossing charity auction occurred in 2008. In an annual 
eBay fundraising auction run by Kompolt & Company, billionaire Warren 
Buffet donated a private lunch to benefit the Glide Foundation in New 
York. The 2008 auction grossed $2,110,100.
 
✓ Oprah Winfrey has jumped onto eBay with a bang! To fund her charity, 
the Angel Network, Oprah auctioned two chairs from her set. These 
were not just any chairs. Aside from being luxurious leather chairs 
designed by Ralph Lauren, they housed the behinds of famous names 
such as John F. Kennedy, Jr., Halle Berry, Tom Hanks, Jim Carrey, and 
Michael Jordan, to name just a few. The 7-day auction netted the charity 
an amazing $64,100.
 
✓ To celebrate Chivas Regal’s 200th year, the company chose eBay for 
CHIVAS 200, the largest online charity auction in the world. From 
September 6 to October 31, 2001, the Chivas folks auctioned more than 
200 of the world’s most-wanted items and experiences — such as an 
opportunity to become a Russian space station astronaut — all for the 
benefit of charity partners around the world.
 
✓ When I appeared on The View with Barbara Walters and Star Jones, all 
four stars of the show autographed a coffee cup that we auctioned off 
on eBay to benefit UNICEF. We raised over $1,000 on a single coffee cup! 
Now that a couple of the hosts have moved on, I wonder what that little 
cup’s worth.
 
If you go to the About Me page (by clicking the link from the listing page) of 
any of the charities on the Charity Fundraising page, you can find out exactly 
where the money that eBay users bid goes.

Part IV: Even More of eBay’s Special Features 
And Now for Our Feature Presentation
As an eBay member, you’re entitled to some features offered on the Web site. 
The perks aren’t quite as high-end as you may receive with, say, a country 
club membership, but hey, your nonexistent membership dues are a lot less! 
With about 203 million confirmed registered users, eBay can get outside com-
panies and manufacturers to listen to what it has to say. You know the old 
saying about power in numbers? On eBay, you find “savings in numbers” on 
items or services that you can buy outside the Web site, as explained in this 
section.
Member specials
As eBay gains popularity, more and more outside companies are offering 
special deals exclusively for members. These deals aren’t auctions but are 
conventional “pay the price and get the item or services” transactions.
To find the member specials, go to the very bottom of eBay’s home page and 
look for the business logos or link boxes at the bottom of the page. eBay also 
has a page with most of the Power Trading features (special deals) at pages.
ebay.com/services/buyandsell/member-specials.html.
Auction for America
In late December 2001, eBay took on one of 
its most ambitious attempts at fundraising: the 
Auction for America. In responses to requests 
by New York Governor George E. Pataki and 
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, eBay called on the 
community to raise $100 million in 100 days. 
eBay and Billpoint (eBay’s payment service 
at the time) waived all fees, and community 
members gave their all, donating and buying 
all kinds of items benefiting the New York 
State World Trade Center Relief Fund, the Twin 
Towers Fund, the American Red Cross, and the 
September 11 Fund.
Community member Jay Leno sold his celebrity-
autographed Harley Davidson for over $360,260; 
Tim Allen sold his 1956 Chevrolet Nomad for 
$46,000; and countless corporate sponsors 
joined in with the person-to-person community 
to raise funds. Over 100,000 sellers participated, 
and over 230,000 items were listed.
The auction ended on December 25, raising $10 
million. This is an amazing tribute to the eBay 
members and their community spirit.

343
 Chapter 18: eBay’s Fun Features
The special deals change all the time, but here’s a small sampling of perks 
available to you as a member:
 
✓ eBay gift certificates: Wow! It doesn’t get much better than this. Now 
I never have to drag myself all over town looking for a gift. You can 
purchase these certificates in any amount from $5.00 to $200.00. You 
can print the certificate and give it with a gift (I think my book, Santa 
Shops on eBay, would make an excellent companion for an eBay gift cer-
tificate), or you can have it e-mailed to the recipient. You can also find 
information at the secure site https://certificates.ebay.com/.
 
✓ PayPal: Online payments integrated directly into your eBay auctions.
 
✓ Authentication services: Get a special discount (usually 10 percent) 
if you authenticate coins through Professional Coin Grading Service 
(PCGS) or trading cards through Professional Sports Authenticator 
(PSA). See Chapter 16 for tips on authenticating your items.
As time passes, you can see additional benefits and programs that eBay cre-
ates for the community. The folks at eBay are aggressively searching out new 
and helpful affiliations to help you take care of your auction business. But 
don’t leave the task of maintaining your listings entirely to eBay — take it 
upon yourself to find new ways to make your listings easier to manage.
 
A successful seller takes advantage of every program and service he or she 
can. The less time you spend tied to your computer, the more time you have 
to plan new auctions and find new items to sell. Investigate these programs 
and try them out for yourself.
Who’s minding The eBay Shop?
eBay’s minding The eBay Shop, of course (and freshening up its window-
dressing from time to time). If you can’t find the perfect item for your favorite 
eBay member with more than 89 million listings (or so) worldwide running 
at any given time, go browse around eBay’s General Store, The eBay Shop. 
You don’t find any auctions here — just eBay logo items, such as shirts, bags, 
coffee mugs, and even eBay pick-up sticks!
To get to eBay’s online store, start at the home page. Scroll down to the very 
bottom and click The eBay Shop link (find it directly at www.theebayshop.
com). Just choose what you like, add it to your shopping cart, and then check 
out when you’re finished. The store will ask you for billing information, so 
keep your credit card handy.

eBay’s Saved Searches e-mail service
If you’re too busy to explore the nooks and crannies of eBay on a daily basis 
(or you’re the type who wants to cut to the chase), sign up for eBay’s per-
sonal shopper through your My eBay Saved Searches.
This service is one of eBay’s better ideas. It enables you to find what you’re 
looking for and still have a life, because it sifts through the new listings for 
you 24 hours a day, looking for the items that meet your description. eBay 
sniffs ’em out like a bloodhound, and then sends you an e-mail containing a 
list of items that you may want to bid on, complete with links that take you 
right to those items. Hey, best of all, the service is free!
To register for the personal shopper e-mail service, begin on the navigation 
bar, which is at the top of most eBay pages, and follow these steps:
 
1. Type keywords and perform a search using the Search box on the top-
right side of any eBay page.
 
 The results of your search appear.
 
2. Click the Save This Search link next to the total number of results.
 
 A box pops up, as shown in Figure 18-2.

3. Using the drop-down menu, choose how long you want to receive 
a daily e-mail about the availability of new items that match your 
search.
 
 Select the period of time (from 7 days to 12 months) you’d like to 
receive the e-mails when new items are listed.
 
4. Click the Save box.
 
5. The search is now added to your My eBay Saved Searches page.
 
 Go there to see a list of your current searches. You may save up to 100 
searches to be notified by e-mail. Yikes, don’t do 100! All you’ll get is 
e-mail from eBay!
Getting Free Calls over the 
Internet with Skype
eBay has purchased a new Internet-based communication service called 
Skype that enables you to call other Skype users long distance for free. You 
can bet that in the near future, eBay will be integrating Skype technology with 
its other services. (Imagine the possibilities!) You need to have a broadband 
Internet connection to use Skype.
Skype is controlled by software that you download to your computer. It 
allows you to communicate with the rest of the world at no additional cost 
(over the expense of your high-speed internet connection). To download 
the software for PC, Mac, or Linux, just go to www.skype.com and click the 
Download Skype link.
After you download the software, you can install the program with a click 
of your mouse. Skype allows you to use your computer (along with a micro-
phone and your regular computer speakers) as a telephone. You can contact 
anyone who is a member of Skype at no charge — wherever in the world 
they reside or do business. (You can call regular phone numbers for a low, 
discounted per-minute fee.) All Skype-to-Skype calls are free. As wonderful 
(and simple) as that is, Skype has other revolutionary features that can really 
expand your business:
 
✓ SkypeIn: I love this feature. With SkypeIn, you can purchase a special 
phone number for your Skype computer so that people not set up with 
Skype can contact you on your Skype account. The super part is that 
if you live in, say, Atlanta but do a lot of business in London, you can 
get a local number in London so your London customers only have to 

346
Part IV: Even More of eBay’s Special Features 
make a local call (without incurring long-distance charges) to reach you. 
Unfortunately, SkypeIn doesn’t do anything about the time difference, 
so you’ll still get calls from your British customers in the middle of the 
night, but this feature does make your business look pretty big time — 
you have a remote office across the Atlantic! You can get up to ten differ-
ent SkypeIn numbers.
 
✓ Skype voicemail: If you’re not at your computer when another user 
attempts to call you, your account can receive and store voicemail. 
Voicemail is free when you purchase a SkypeIn telephone number. If you 
purchase it separately, the annual cost is minimal.
 
✓ SkypeOut: You can call any number in the United States and Canada 
(mobile or land line) for $2.95 a month. Skype has reasonable charges 
for calls made to foreign countries through SkypeOut. For example: 
London, UK is $.021, Japan $.023, France $.021 per minute. For a com-
plete listing of international per-minute rates go to www.skype.com/
price/callrates.
At home I use a Netgear Skype dual-mode phone so that my buyers can reach 
me with questions whenever they want. The phone carries my office land line 
as well as my Skype line wirelessly to anywhere I carry the phone. It plugs 
into my router to pick up my Skype calls, and a phone line wire plugs into the 
wall jack to access the land line. It also uses a new technology that expands 
the strength and range of the wireless phone.
My home was built after the Northridge, California, earthquake and it has a 
good deal of steel in its structure to prevent it from collapsing. This struc-
tural element had precluded my using a wireless phone from one end of the 
house to the other — until I got the Skype phone. Now I can access Skype and 
get free long distance from anywhere in my home or office. (For more infor-
mation, check the Web site at www.netgear.com.)
Skype is adding interesting features all the time. The Skype software even 
allows for free video calls on your computer (assuming you have a Web cam). 
You can also add a Skype button to your e-mails, allowing your contacts to 
just click to call you.

o matter how much experience airplane pilots may have, they 
always keep multiple checklists to go over. The same is true on eBay 
(although the only crashing that you need to worry about is on your com-
puter). No matter how many times you buy or sell, the advice in this chapter 
can help you survive and thrive at eBay.
Although conducting business on eBay is relatively smooth overall, any ven-
ture is bound to have a few bumps here and there. A certain etiquette goes 
along with everything we do in life. If you follow these simple rules, your time 
on the site will be a whole lot more pleasant for everyone. That said, here are 
ten (or so) easy, important golden rules for eBay. I note which tips are geared 
toward buyers or sellers. Happy hunting and gathering!
 
After a while, posting listings and bidding become rote. You can all too easily 
forget the basics, so look at this chapter every now and again and remember 
that, as a successful eBay member, you’re part of a very special person-to-
person community.

Part V: The Part of Tens 
Buyer: Investigate Your Treasure 
Before You Buy
In the excitement of finding just what you want, you may develop a tendency 
to leap before you look. Even if the item is closing soon, carefully read the 
item description. Does the item have any flaws? Can you live with it? Is some-
thing missing from the description that should be there? Did you read the 
terms of payment and shipping?
You can also communicate with the seller of the item that you’re longing for. 
Don’t be too shy or embarrassed. If you have any questions, send an e-mail! 
You’re better off covering your bases before you place a bid than facing dis-
appointment after making a purchase. Remember that when you click the 
Bid or Buy button, you are legally and morally obligated to go through with 
the transaction if you win. Make sure that everything is as you want it and 
check for a warranty or return policy. Clarify everything upfront. If the seller 
doesn’t answer back, consider that nonresponse an early warning that deal-
ing with this person may be a mistake!
Buyer: Check the Seller’s Feedback
Never bid without checking the seller’s feedback. You need to be able to trust 
the person you’re buying from. Don’t just evaluate the Feedback percentage: 
Investigate the seller’s feedback by clicking the number next to his or her 
user ID. Be sure to read the comments left by other users. Checking some of 
the seller’s other listings, past and present, to get an idea of the seller’s his-
tory also can’t hurt. As badly as you may want something, sending a payment 
to someone with a high feedback rating but who recently got a bunch of nega-
tives could be risky business.
Buyer: Understand Post-Auction Charges 
and Payment Methods
Before you bid on an item, make sure that you and the seller have similar ideas 
on the shipping and handling, insurance, and escrow fees (if applicable — see 
Chapter 6). Buying a $10 item and finding out that shipping and handling are 
going to cost more than your winning bid is way bad. Don’t forget to look for 
any “handling charges.”

351
 Chapter 19: Ten (or So) Golden Rules for eBay Buyers and Sellers
Also, make sure that you and the seller can agree on the form of payment 
before the deal closes. If you want to pay with a check, is the seller willing to 
accept one? (You’ll have to e-mail them ahead of time to find out.) Are you 
willing to wait to receive your purchase until a check clears? Is credit card 
payment available? Stay safe and use a secure method of paying with credit 
cards like PayPal.
Buyer: Check the Price 
Tag and Bid Wisely
Before you bid, make sure that you have some knowledge of the item, even if 
you limit your search to completed auctions to get an idea of how much the 
item went for in the past.
 
If a deal sounds too good to be true, it may well be.
I love eBay — but not for every single thing that I buy (okay, almost). Make 
sure that you can’t get the item cheaper at the store or from another online 
seller.
Beware of getting caught up in the frenzy of last-minute bidding: It’s an easy 
thing to do. Whether you choose proxy bidding or sniping (see Chapter 7 for 
my discussion on sniping), decide how much you’re willing to pay before bid-
ding. If you set a limit, you won’t be overcome with the urge to spend more 
than an item is worth — or, worse, more than you have in your bank account.
Although eBay is lots of fun, it’s also serious business. Bidding is a legal and 
binding contract. Don’t get a bad reputation by retracting bids or becoming a 
deadbeat.
Buyer: Be a Good Buyer Bee
Always leave feedback after you put the finishing touches on a transaction. 
Leaving feedback, and thereby helping other members, is your responsibility. 
Remember your manners when making your payment. You like to be paid on 
time, right? And, speaking practically, the sooner you send the money, the 
sooner you get your stuff.
Keep in mind that the transaction isn’t complete until the buyer receives the 
merchandise and is happy with the purchase. Don’t automatically expect 
positive feedback because you paid for your item in a timely manner.

352
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Buyer: Cover Your Assets
Remember that just because you’re conducting transactions from the privacy 
of your home doesn’t mean that you’re doing everything you can to protect 
your privacy. Legitimate buyers and sellers never need to know your pass-
word or Social Security number. Do not respond to this sort of e-mail. See 
Chapter 15 about how to handle this sort of e-mail.
Seller: Know Your Stuff
Do some homework. Know the value of your item. At the very least, get an idea 
of your item’s value by searching completed listings for similar items. If it’s a 
new item, check out other online sites and see what your item is selling for by 
running a Google/Froogle search at www.google.com/products. Knowing 
your product also means that you can accurately describe what you have and 
never, ever pass off a fake as the real McCoy. Make sure that your item isn’t 
prohibited, illegal, questionable, or infringing. It’s your responsibility!
Before posting your listing, you should take the following actions:
 
✓ Write an honest description.
 
✓ Take a good, clear photo.
 
✓ Work out your shipping and handling charges.
Add each of the preceding pieces of info to your item’s description to avoid 
any unnecessary disputes later.
Seller: Polish and Shine
Make sure that your title is descriptive enough to catch the eye of someone 
browsing a category and detailed enough for eBay’s search engine to iden-
tify. Don’t just write 1960s Board Game. Instead, give some details: Tiny Tim 
Vintage’60s Board Game MIB. That gets ’em tiptoeing to your auction.
Play editor and scrutinize your text for grammar mistakes and misspellings. 
Typos in either your title or description can cost you money. For example, a 
search engine will keep skipping over your Mikky Mouce Choklit Cokie Jare. 
Spelling counts — and pays. Double-check your work!

353
 Chapter 19: Ten (or So) Golden Rules for eBay Buyers and Sellers
Seller: Picture-Perfect Facts
Photos can be a boon or a bust on eBay. Double-check the photo of your item 
before you post it. Is the lighting okay? Does the photo paint a flattering image 
of the item? Crop out unnecessary backgrounds. Would you buy this item?
 
Take your picture as if you didn’t have a description; be sure it totally illus-
trates the item. Also, write your description as if you didn’t have a photo. That 
way if the photo server crashes, the prospective buyer will have a good idea 
of what you’re selling.
Be factual and honest. On eBay, all you have is your reputation, so don’t jeop-
ardize it by lying about your item or terms. Tell potential buyers about any 
flaws. Give as complete a description as possible, with all the facts about the 
item that you can include.
Seller: Communication Is Key
Respond quickly and honestly to all questions sent via the My eBay Messages 
page and use the contact to establish a good relationship. Don’t let more 
than 24 hours pass without sending a response. If a bidder makes a reason-
able request about payment or shipping, going along with that request is usu-
ally worth it to make a sale. Note: The customer is always right! (Well, some 
of the time, anyway.)
Be upfront and fair when charging for sending merchandise to your buyer. 
You can’t make much money by overcharging for shipping and handling. 
Besides, charging outrageous handling fees will penalize you in eBay search 
and is a violation of eBay’s policies. You could get yourself suspended from 
the site. After the item arrives, the buyer may realize what it costs to ship. 
Unreasonable charges inevitably lead to bad feelings, negative feedback, and 
low DSRs.
Seller: Be a Buyer’s Dream
Just because you’re transacting through the computer doesn’t mean that 
you can forget your manners. Live by the golden rule: Do unto others as you 
would have others do unto you. Contact the buyer the day they make their 
purchase — immediately is even better. (Better yet, why not ship the item 
that quickly? I try to.) And keep all your correspondence polite.

354
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Ship the goods as soon as you can (in accordance with the shipping terms 
you outline in the item description, of course). An e-mail stating that the item 
is on its way is always a nice touch, too. That way, buyers can eagerly antici-
pate the arrival of their goods.
And, when shipping your items, use quality packing materials and sturdy 
boxes to prevent disaster. Broken or damaged items can lead to reputation-
damaging, negative feedback. Pack as if someone’s out to destroy your pack-
age (or as if you had made this purchase). Your buyers are sure to appreciate 
the effort.
Seller: Listen to the Music
As I state in the golden rules for buyers, don’t underestimate the power of posi-
tive feedback. Your reputation is at stake. Always generously dole out feedback 
when you complete a transaction. Your buyers will appreciate it and should 
return the favor. What should you do if you get slammed unfairly with nega-
tive feedback? Don’t freak out! Do, however, post a response to the feedback 
by using the Respond to Feedback link on your My eBay page. Those who read 
your feedback can often see past a single disgruntled message.
Keep in mind that many negative feedback reports result from misunder-
standings. Contact the buyer the moment you smell a problem arising and 
see if you can work things out to your satisfaction. Always work to keep your 
eBay reputation pristine.
Buyers and Sellers: Keep 
Current, Keep Cool
You’d be surprised at the number of users who get suspended even though 
they have automatic credit card payments. Maybe they move. Or their e-mail 
address changes because they change Internet service providers. Regardless, 
if you don’t update your contact and credit card information, and eBay and 
other users can’t contact you as a result, you can be suspended.
If you make any major moves (home address, billing address, ISP), let eBay 
know this new contact information. Click My eBay on the main navigation 
bar, scroll down the links on the left side of the page to My eBay Account 
Preferences, and update the appropriate information.

eady to take your sales to the next level? Are you looking for snappy-
looking text or fancy layouts to make your auctions scream, “Buy me!”? 
Need to slip in a bid in the middle of the night without losing sleep? If so, 
here’s a list of ten (or so) programs and services to help put your auctions 
ahead of the pack and make your bidding life easier. In this chapter I recom-
mend some reliable companies, and many of them offer free solutions!
As online sales grow in popularity, software developers are constantly upgrad-
ing and developing new auction and selling software to meet eBay’s changes. 
Many of these programs even look for new versions of themselves — and 
update themselves as you start them. (Aladdin never had things so good.)
 
You absolutely don’t have to use any of these programs or services to run 
eBay sales successfully. However, when you’re running more than several 
auctions a week, the addition of a “helper” makes things go ever so much 
smoother (especially if it’s free or very low cost).

356
Part V: The Part of Tens 
A large amount of companies out there are offering online management ser-
vice and offline programs. (Let’s face it, as long as people will pay they will 
be happy to have something to sell you.) I can’t cover each and every one, 
so the software that I mention in this chapter has been tried and tested by 
me. You may know of others, and I’d love to hear about them. I do know that 
these work and are good tools when you choose to expand your eBay sales.
Listed in this chapter are several auction-management Web sites. Each site 
has its own distinct personality. I also provide the names of some terrific 
offline software programs you can use to help manage your auctions, make 
your e-auctions elegant and eye-catching, find the best prices, and snatch up 
that bargain at the last minute.
 
Be sure to check my Web site www.coolebaytools.com for updates on soft-
ware and services pricing, as well as special discounts that are offered to my 
readers.
Online Services
You’re comfortable transacting your auctions online, so why not manage 
them online as well? The sites in this section offer incredibly useful services 
that save time in both posting your auctions and wrapping them up.
Auctiva
If you’re new on eBay and you’d like to try a little automation to get you 
started, Auctiva is your entry-level choice. Auctiva has been serving eBay 
sellers since my first edition of eBay For Dummies in 1999. First, let me tell 
you my favorite part about Auctiva: It’s free. That’s right, FREE (my favor-
ite four-letter word). Now, I always say you get what you pay for, but with 
Auctiva you get a bit more than that.
Auctiva offers online item-listing software and image hosting for eBay sell-
ers. The easy-to-use site guides you through the process: creating auction

file is set to automatically appear in all your listings by default.

InkFrog
InkFrog is a Web-based service founded by Tomas Salas and Greg Sisung. 
They’ve been helping eBay sellers since 1999. In 2006 InkFrog bought out 
another respected service, SpareDollar. InkFrog represents a super bargain in 
a Web-based management service. The best part about its service is that you 
pay a flat monthly fee of only $9.95. With its easy-to-use service, little guys 
can get the same benefits as large-volume sellers — and pay smaller fees.

ad design, automated e-mail management, and report tracking. If you want to 
get fancy, you can design your item listing from any of its templates. Here are 
some more features:
 
✓ Image hosting: InkFrog hosts your images and has a handy uploader

Vendio and Vendio Stores
Vendio was one of eBay’s first providers in 1999 and has been serving over a 
million sellers since. These sellers have sold over $15 billion in merchandise 
to nearly 300 million buyers. Vendio is a major provider of services that help 
e-commerce merchants on eBay, Amazon, and many other sites reach con-
sumers, manage transactions, and profitably grow their businesses.
You can buy some or all of Vendio services (kind of like a Chinese restau-
rant). Here are just a few of their many applications:
 
✓ Buyer appreciation: This automates the process of personalized cus-
tomer communication. The first time a customer bids or buys, they send 
a thank you e-mail. Best of all? This service is free.
 
✓ Counters: This free service from Vendio will let you see the number of 
visitors to your item, as well the total number of bids. Er, by the way, 
this is also free.
 
✓ Image hosting: Store your images on their site. Pricing starts at $3.00 a 
month for up to 3MB of storage (you really don’t need more).

sional online store that’s easy to set up. No image fees for stores, no

yourself a favor, and study my books before you launch a store.)
 
✓ Free Gallery Pro:. Readers of this book get a great free service from 
Vendio, their Gallery Pro. This service gives you a small bit of text that 
you add to your listings that displays a scrolling gallery of your items

help increase hits by 50 percent and sell-through by up to 18 percent. 
You can also specify the order in which specific items appear. To get

Buyitsellit Stores
You want to start small? You can at Buyitsellit. When you’re ready to set up 
your own full-featured Web store, Buyitsellit will give you one for only $9.95 
a month. You get 100MB of file storage, custom templates, and a custom

traffic statistics. They even offer a starter store, where you can list ten items

Fast Photos
If your photos need a touch up to make them Web ready and PhotoShop is 
too expensive and complex (it really is for eBay purposes), you might be 
happy giving Fast Photos by Pixby Software a try. It’s a simple, all-in-one 
photo-editing program designed especially for e-commerce and eBay sellers. 
The developer of the software knew exactly what processes online sellers 
need for their images and included just those — and nothing else. There are 
tools for cropping, JPEG compression, sharpening, resizing, enhancing, rotat-
ing, and adding watermark text and borders.
The software is a PC application that runs on Vista, Windows XP, 2000, ME, 
and 98 SE. For a 21-day free trial, visit their Web site at www.pixby.com/

BidRobot
As you can tell by reading Chapter 7, I’m a big fan of sniping. It’s my favorite 
way to win an auction. It makes the entire auction experience even more 
entertaining. Sadly, with the schedule I keep, I am rarely at my computer 
when the auctions close!
BidRobot to the rescue. When I find an auction that I’m serious about, I 
simply go to the BidRobot Web site, log in, and place my future snipe bids. All 
I have to do is type the item number and my high bid, and that’s it. I can shut 
off my computer knowing that BidRobot will do my bidding for me. Nobody 
on eBay will know what item I’m desperate to have, because the magical 
BidRobot doesn’t place my bid until a few seconds before the auction closes. 
If I’m the high bidder, no one will have the chance to bid against me!
BidRobot’s services are reasonably priced, based on the amount of time that 
you want to use the service. As of this writing, BidRobot has placed bids for 
more than 100,000 eBay users since 1998! You pay a flat rate for all the snipes

Software for Offline Use
Software for offline use can handily reside on your computer after a simple 
download from a Web site. As with online services, this software comes in a 
variety of flavors, so take a look and decide which program works best for 
you. Downloadable software may be available from Web sites that offer other 
services and can be used whether you are online or not. Offline software 
enables you to handle auctions in your spare time, without the limitations of 
ISPs or servers.
Auction Wizard 2000
Auction Wizard 2000 is a full-service professional management software pack-
age developed by eBay sellers. The software is fairly simple and amazingly 
powerful. It expedites all the seller functions for running and completing eBay 
sales, including automating the following tasks:
 
✓ Inputting your inventory on the software’s HTML templates and upload-
ing auctions in bulk onto eBay.
 
✓ Automatically updating the software with the current status of your auc-
tions, including who won, who is a runner-up, and the auction bidding 
history. The preformatted e-mail and feedback files automatically fill in 
the values from each auction and send them to the people you do busi-
ness with directly through the software.
 
✓ Tracking income and expenses, as well as creating a full set of reports.
If you choose to become a Trading Assistant — that is, sell items for other 
people — Auction Wizard 2000 has a separate tracking area where you can 
keep track of your consignment sales by consignee. It even computes the fees 
that you’re charging for your services. They charge $100.00 for the first year, 
and $50.00 for annual renewal.

eBay’s Software and Services
When the users call, eBay answers! As eBay grew, the need for additional 
services and software also grew. eBay answered the need with Turbo Lister 
software and its PowerSeller program. Read on to see how these services tai-
lored for the eBay user may benefit you.
eBay’s Free Turbo Lister
Turbo Lister is free software that enables you to upload many auctions simul-
taneously. I use it regularly to set up my listings. After you prepare your auc-
tions offline, the software uploads your auctions to eBay with just the click of 
a button. You can edit, preview, and (when you’re ready) launch all your auc-
tions at once, or schedule them to launch at different times (which costs you 
$0.10 for each scheduled auction). Your items can include eBay’s templates, 
Finally, for the Mac!
Rejoice! You Mac users out there now have a 
couple of eBay listing services that will help you 
expedite your listings on eBay. eLister 2 is a full-
powered offline listing program that gives you 
the freedom to write auctions on your own time 
and includes a group of good-looking auction 
templates. It includes an automatic HTML gen-
erator and an automatic listing fee calculator. 
Visit www.blackmagik.com/; the program 
is updated regularly to conform to any changes 
in eBay listing procedures and starts at $4.99 
a month.
A very robust solution is Auction Genie, which 
gives you not only listing capabilities but also 
advanced management software and lots of 
extras. It also works with your Mac e-mail pro-
gram and provides FTP services for uploading 
your photos to your Web site. Check out its 
services, available for $50.00 a year, at www.

and the items will remain archived on your computer for later use. The soft-
ware is convenient and simple to use even if you have only a few items at 
one time — although Turbo Lister will let you launch thousands of listings at 
a time! The program is free, and you can download it at pages.ebay.com/
turbo_lister.
Selling Manager and Selling Manager Pro
I have used Selling Manager Pro for my eBay sales for many years, and I find 
it to be a convenient way to quickly relist singly (or in bulk), track the prog-
ress of my sales, send bulk e-mails, leave feedback, and keep track of what 
has and hasn’t sold.
You also get a nice selection of reports to help you keep track of how your 
listings are performing. This way you can tell whether your sales are on-
target or not. As you can see from Figure 20-1, Selling Manager (or Selling 
Manager Pro) replaces the All Selling page of My eBay. This thorough data 
is updated automatically from eBay’s servers and PayPal, so you have up-to-
the-minute info.

eBay PowerSellers program
eBay offers an elite club for PowerSellers who fulfill the following requirements:
 
✓ Be an active eBay member for at least 90 days
 
✓ Sell a minimum of $1,000 or 100 items per month for 3 consecutive 
months, or sell a minimum of $12,000 or 1,200 items for the prior 12 
months
 
✓ Have a minimum overall feedback rating of 100
 
✓ Maintain at least a 98 feedback percentage
 
✓ Keep your eBay account current
 
✓ Comply with all eBay policies
 
✓ Maintain a rating of 4.5 or higher for the past 12 months in all four 
Detailed Seller Ratings (DSRs)
 
✓ Run your business by upholding eBay’s community values
No, you don’t need to wear an ugly tie. PowerSellers get a special icon next 
to their user IDs on the eBay site, thereby giving potential bidders the assur-
ance that they’re dealing with a seller of good repute who stands behind each 
sale. PowerSellers who meet or exceed eBay’s requirements also get the fol-
lowing benefits:
 
✓ Bronze level and higher ($1,000 in gross monthly sales or 100 items a 
month) gets you a PowerSeller logo posted on the site next to your user 
ID. You also have access to a private PowerSeller discussion board and 
have 24/7 e-mail tech support with a very fast response time.
 
✓ Silver level ($3,000 average in monthly gross sales or 300 items a 
month) gets you the benefits of the Bronze level, plus a toll-free phone 
number for priority support during business hours.
 
✓ Gold level ($10,000 average in monthly gross sales or 1,000 items a 
month) gets you the benefits of the Silver level, plus a dedicated account 
manager and a dedicated support hot line, 24/7!

Part V: The Part of Tens 
 
✓ Platinum level ($25,000 average month in gross sales or 2,500 items a 
month) gets you Gold level benefits, plus I’ll bet you get quicker call-
backs from your account manager than at the Gold level.
 
✓ Titanium level ($150,000 average month in gross sales or 15,000 items a 
month) probably gets you a whole lot of special attention!
 
✓ Diamond level ($500,000 average month in gross sales). At this level, I 
don’t think they care how many items you sell, but I’ll bet they will be 
supernice to you.
There are many more benefits to becoming a PowerSeller. It’s something 
important to aim for, but start slow and hone your selling skills. You’ll get 
there soon enough. If you feel that you qualify for eBay’s PowerSellers service 
(eBay knows who you are!), apply at pages.ebay.com/services/buy

Trading Assistant Program
For experienced eBay sellers who have a feedback rating of 97 percent or 
more, the Trading Assistant program is the place to be! This is where you 
can register to sell items for others who don’t have the time or inclination to 
learn how to sell on eBay.
People with items to sell go to pages.ebay.com/tahub/ and search for 
Trading Assistants by zip or area code. After their search, they’re presented 
with a list of sellers who are ready and willing to sell their goods (that’s you,

Finding Stuff to Sell
A
fter you pick clean everything not nailed down in your house, you may 
want to broaden your horizons. The key to successfully selling items 
on eBay is to find things people actually want to buy at the right price. (Wow, 
what an incredible observation.) I know it seems obvious, but having stuff 
to sell isn’t always the same as having things people want to buy. Using this 
concept, you can teach yourself all kinds of effective marketing strategies. 
Finding the item that may be “the next big thing” takes lots of work, timing, 
and sometimes a dose of good luck.
As an eBay seller, no doubt you’ll receive tons of spam (unsolicited e-mails) 
guaranteeing that the sender has the hottest-selling items for you to sell 
on eBay. Think about this for a second. If you had the hot ticket to riches, 
wouldn’t you be selling the product on eBay and making the fortune yourself? 
These people aren’t big-hearted millionaires; they make money by preying on 
those who think there’s a magic way to make money on eBay. There isn’t. It 
takes old-fashioned elbow grease and research.
Knowing the Market
Just as successful stockbrokers know about individual companies, they also 
need to know about the marketplace as a whole. Sure, I know about the top 
designer purses out there, and so does nearly everyone else. To get a leg up 
on your competition, you need to know the big picture as well. Here are some 
questions you should ask yourself as you contemplate making serious buck-
ets of money (well, I hope) by selling items on eBay:
 
✓ What items are currently hot? If you see everyone around you rush-
ing to the store to buy a particular item, chances are good that the item 
will become more valuable as stocks of it diminish. (iPod accessories?) 
The simple rule of supply and demand says that whoever has something 
everyone else wants stands to gain major profits. Big-box warehouse 
stores like Costco usually have a full stock of popular items because their 
very savvy buyers purchase by the truckload months in advance — how 
about visiting a warehouse store to find items at discount?

366
eBay For Dummies, 6th Edition 
 
✓ Do I see a growing interest in a specific item that might make it a big 
seller? If you’re starting to hear talk about a particular item, or even an 
era (’80s nostalgia? ’60s aluminum Christmas trees? Who knew?), listen 
carefully and think of what you already own (or can get your hands on) 
that can help you catch a piece of the trend’s action.
 
✓ Should I hold on to this item and wait for its value to increase, or 
should I sell now? Knowing when to sell an item that you think people 
may want is a tricky business. Sometimes, you can catch the trend too 
early and find out that you could have commanded a better price if 
only you had waited. Other times, you may invest in a fad that’s already 
passé and find that no one’s interested anymore. It’s best to test the 
market with a small quantity of your hoard, dribbling items individually 
into the market until you’ve made back the money you spent to acquire 
them. When you have your cash back, the rest will be gravy.
 
 I’m a huge fan of the artist George Rodrigue. When building my collection of 
his famous “Blue Dog” items years ago, I came across a seller who had liber-
ated some early museum exhibition catalogs from a dumpster. Although the 
old catalogs had been tossed in the trash, they were boxed and bundled — 
and in perfect condition. Being a true-blue Rodrigue fan, I thought perhaps 
these catalogs might make good future eBay items. I asked the seller if he 
had 30 to sell, he said yes, and he sold them to me for $4 each. I resold them 
over the next five years for between $15 and $35 each. Spotting the trends 
and seeing the value in items is what it’s all about.
 
✓ Is a company discontinuing an item I should stockpile now and sell 
later? Pay attention to items that are discontinued, especially toys and 
novelty items. If you find an item that a manufacturer has a limited supply 
of, you could make a tidy profit. If the manufacturer ends up reissuing 
the item, don’t forget that the original run is still the most coveted — and 
valuable. I once bought a case of last season’s footless pantyhose at a 
huge discount — I sold them one at a time, at a 400 percent profit, for 
three years.
 
✓ Was there a recall, an error, or a legal proceeding associated with my 
item? If so, how it affects the value of the item takes a backseat to eBay 
policy: An error item, okay. But items that have been recalled for safety 
reasons can’t be sold on eBay (for details, go to pages.ebay.com/
help/policies/recalled.html). For example, a toy recalled for 
safety reasons may no longer be appropriate for the kids, but even if it’s 
rare and collectible, you still can’t sell it on eBay.
 
 But here’s another angle: Consider that shares of (and any paperwork to 
do with) the now-defunct corporation Enron became highly prized col-
lectibles after the scandal hit.
 
Some people like to go with their gut feelings about when and what to buy for 
resale on eBay. By all means, if instinct has worked for you in the past, factor 
instinct in here, too. If you’ve done some research that looks optimistic but 

367
 Appendix: Finding Stuff to Sell
your gut says, “I’m not sure,” listen to it; don’t assume you’re just hearing 
that lunchtime burger talking. Try testing the waters by purchasing one of 
the prospective items for resale on eBay. If that sale doesn’t work out, you 
won’t have invested a lot of money, and you can credit your gut with saving 
you some bucks.
Do You Have a Talent?
If you’re talented in any way, you can sell your services on eBay. Home arti-
sans, chefs, and even stay-at-home psychics are transacting business daily 
on the site. (Psychics are doing a land-office business)! What a great way to 
make money on eBay — make your own product!
Personalized and custom items do well on eBay. There’s a demand for per-
sonalized invitations, cards, and announcements — and even return address 
labels (and you thought you had all you needed). Calligraphic work or 
computer-designed (customized with Fido’s picture, awww) items are in big 
demand today, but no one seems to have the time to make them. Savvy sell-
ers with talent can fill this market niche.
People go to trendy places (when they have the time) like Soho, the Grove, or 
the Village to find unique custom jewelry. They also go to eBay.
The world is your oyster on eBay, and the sky is the limit. Use your imagina-
tion, and you might be surprised at what your new business will be!
Catching Trends in the Media
Catching trends is all about listening and looking. You can find all kinds of 
inside information from newspapers, magazines, television, and of course, 
the Internet. Believe it or not, you can even find out what people are inter-
ested in these days by bribing a kid. Keep your eyes and ears open. When 
people say, “That GEICO gecko is everywhere,” instead of nodding your head 
vacantly, start getting ideas.
In newspapers
Newspapers are bombarded by press releases and inside information from 
companies the world over. Pay close attention to the various sections of the 
newspaper. Look for stories on celebrities and upcoming movies and see if 
any old fads are making a resurgence (you can sell items as “retro chic” — 
Lava Lamps, anyone?).

368
eBay For Dummies, 6th Edition 
Read the stories about trade conventions, like the New York Toy Fair or the 
Consumer Electronics show. New products are introduced and given the 
thumbs-up or -down by journalists. This way you can start to think about the 
direction your area of expertise is heading.
On television
No matter what you think of television, it has an enormous impact on which 
trends come and go and which ones stick. Why else would advertisers sink 
billions of dollars into TV commercials? And look at the impact of Oprah’s 
Book Club. Just one Oprah appearance for an author can turn a book into an 
overnight bestseller. More and more celebrities (even Homer Simpson) are 
talking about eBay. The buzz brings people to the site.
Tune in to morning news shows and afternoon talk shows. See what’s being 
featured in the programs. The producers of these shows are on top of pop 
culture and move fast to be the first to bring you the next big thing. Take 
what they feature and think of a marketing angle. If you don’t, you can be 
sure somebody else will.
Catch up with youth culture . . .
. . . or at least keep good tabs on it. There seems to be no catching up with 
it, just as there’s no way to say this without sounding over-the-hill: If you 
remember cranking up The Beatles, James Brown, or The Partridge Family 
(say what?) until your parents screamed, “Shut that awful noise off,” you may 
be at that awkward time of life when you hardly see the appeal of what young 
people are doing or listening to. But if you want tips for hot-selling items, 
tolerate the awful noise of today’s music (how did that happen?) and listen 
to the kids around you. (Try to watch a little MTV, too.) Children, especially 
preteens and teens, may be the best trend-spotters on the planet. See what 
kind of marketing tips you get when you ask a kid questions like these:
 
✓ What’s cool at the moment? Or “rad” if you want to sound cool — 
whoops, that was ’80s-speak, wasn’t it?
 
✓ What’s totally uncool that was cool two months ago? Their world 
moves at warp speed!
 
✓ What music are you buying? Kanye West, Kelly Clarkson, Coldplay, and 
Black-Eyed Peas — yup, all the hot bands with big hits — but maybe 
ewww-that’s-so-five-minutes-ago by the time you read this.
 
✓ What could I buy you that would make you really happy? Hint: If the 
kid says, “A red BMW Z-3,” or “Liposuction,” look for a younger kid.

Check out eBay
Another important link goes to the eBay Pulse. Visit the Pulse page and you 
can find an up-to-the-minute snapshot of the most-searched-for items in each 
category. This is usually pretty amusing reading — you’d be surprised how 
many people are watching eBay listings for get-rich-quick schemes — right 
along with expensive real estate! You can also reach this page by going 
directly to pulse.ebay.com. There’s a drop-down menu at the top of the 
page, so you can see the most-searched-for items in the main categories.
Check out magazines
Magazines geared to the 18-to-34 age group (and sometimes to younger 
teens — they call them tweens) can help you stay on top of what’s hot. See 
what the big companies are pitching to this target audience and whether 
they’re succeeding. If a celebrity’s suddenly visible in every other headline 
or magazine, be on the lookout for merchandise relating to that person. (Are 
we talking hysteria-plus-cash-flow here, or just hysteria?)
Collecting magazines
Although not quite a plethora, the number of 
magazines geared to collectors is definitely 
approaching a slew. Although these magazines 
won’t help you catch a trend (by the time it 
gets into one of these magazines, somebody’s 
already caught it), they can give you great 
information on pricing, availability, and general 
collecting information. And you can follow the 
course of a trend for a real-life example of how 
it works. Here’s a list of collectors’ magazines 
that I like:
 ✓ Antique Trader has been the bible of 
the antique collecting industry for over 
40 years. Visit its online home at www.
antiquetrader.com for more articles 
and other information.
 ✓ Collect.com is a Web site from Krause pub-
lications. It gives you info on over 35 differ-
ent collector’s publications for everything 
from stamps to toys to muscle cars.
 ✓ Barbie Bazaar has info on everything related 
to Barbie. Go to www.hautedoll.com.
 ✓ Numismatic News is an old standard that 
has been around for more than 50 years. 
The first issue each month includes a pull-
out guide to retail U.S. coin prices. Every 
three months, it also includes a U.S. paper-
money price guide.

The Hunt for eBay Inventory
If you’re not sure what you want to sell for profit on eBay — but you’re a 
shop-till-you-drop person by nature — you have an edge. Incorporate your 
advanced shopping techniques into your daily routine. If you find a bargain 
that interests you, chances are you have a knack for spotting stuff that other 
shoppers would love to get their hands on.
The goods are out there
When you shop to sell on eBay, don’t rule out any shopping venue. From the 
trendiest boutique to the smallest second-hand store, from garage sales to 
Saks Outlet, keep your eye out for eBay inventory. The items people look for 
on eBay are out there; you just have to find them.
Check your favorite eBay category and see what the hot-selling items are. 
Better yet, go to your favorite store and make friends with the manager. Store 
managers are often privy to this type of information a couple of months in 
advance of a product release. If you ask, they’ll tell you what’s going to be the 
hot new item next month. After you’re armed with the information you need, 
seek out that item for the lowest price you can, and then you can give it a 
shot on eBay.
Keep these shopping locales in mind when you go on the eBay hunt:
 
✓ Upscale department stores, trendy boutiques, outlet stores, or flagship 
designer stores are good places to do some market research. Check out 
the newest items — and then head to the clearance area or outlet store 
and scrutinize the bargain racks for brand-name items.
 
✓ Tour some of the discount and dollar stores in your area. Many of the items 
these places carry are overruns (too many of something that didn’t sell), 
small runs (too little of something that the big guys weren’t interested in 
stocking), or out-of-date fad items that need a good home on eBay.
 
✓ Garage sales, tag sales, and moving sales offer some of the biggest bar-
gains you’ll ever come across. Check for vintage kitchen pieces, designer 
goods, and old toys, and make ’em an offer they can’t refuse.
 
✓ Thrift stores are packed with used but usually good-quality items. And 
you can feel good knowing that the money you spend in a nonprofit 
thrift shop is going to a good cause.
 
✓ Find going-out-of-business sales. You can pick up bargains by the case if 
a shopkeeper just wants to empty the shelves so the store can close.

371
 Appendix: Finding Stuff to Sell
 
✓ Take advantage of any flea markets or swap meets in your area.
 
✓ Gift shops at museums, monuments, national parks, and theme parks 
can provide eBay inventory — but think about where to sell the items. 
Part of your selling success on eBay is access. People who can’t get to 
Graceland may pay handsomely for an Elvis mini-guitar with the official 
logo on the box. Or maybe not?
 
✓ Hang on to the freebies you get. If you receive handouts (lapel pins, pen-
cils, pamphlets, books, interesting napkins, flashlights, towels, stuffed 
toys) from a sporting event, premiere, or historic event — or even a col-
lectible freebie from a fast-food restaurant — any of them could be your 
ticket to some eBay sales.
Tips for the modest investor
If you’re interested in making money in your eBay ventures but you’re start-
ing with limited cash, follow this list of eBay inventory do’s and don’ts:
 
✓ Don’t spend more than you can afford to lose. If you shop at boutiques 
and expensive department stores, buy things that you like to wear your-
self (or give as gifts) in case they don’t sell.
 
✓ Do try to find something local that’s unavailable in a wider area. For 
example, if you live in an out-of-the-way place that has a local specialty, 
try selling that on eBay.
 
✓ Don’t go overboard and buy something really cheap just because it’s 
cheap. Figure out who would want the item first.
 
✓ Do consider buying in bulk, especially if you know the item sells well on 
eBay or if the item is inexpensive. Chances are good that if you buy one 
and it sells well on eBay, by the time you try to buy more, the item’s sold 
out. If an item is inexpensive (say, 99 cents), I always buy at least five. If 
no one bids on the item when you hold your auction, you’re only out $5.
