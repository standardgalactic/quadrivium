About the Author
Cheryl Fall, a professional designer since 1986, is the author of 12 how-to
books and over 2,500 how-to articles in various publications. Magazines fea-
turing her work over the last 19 years have included The Quilter, Quilt World,
Quick and Easy Quilting, Family Circle, Woman’s Day, Country Living, Craftworks,
and Sewing Savvy.
Cheryl is also the host of The Creative Life with Cheryl Fall, a nationally 
distributed PBS ‘Plus’ program that features lifestyle-enhancing projects,
ideas, and useful information for women. She has also spent years creating
quilting and sewing projects and teaching for various manufacturers, including
Coats & Clark and Singer. As an accomplished fine artist, Cheryl has created
and licensed designs for use in the textile, giftware, table top, and home fur-
nishings markets.
Quilting can be an all-consuming occupation, but Cheryl still finds the time
to goof around. Residing near Portland, Oregon, she’s been happily married
for more than 20 years to husband Tony and has two college-age daughters
and one spoiled-rotten cocker spaniel named Buster, who thinks he rules the
roost.
Dedication
I dedicate this book to would-be quilters the world over and to those who are
learning this art. May all your quilts be terrific!


Author’s Acknowledgments
I would like to thank my wonderful family because without their support, this
book may have never made it to press. I can’t thank my hubby and daughters
enough for all the cooking, cleaning, and laundry they did while I was putting
this book together (okay, sometimes I milked it, but it sure was fun!).
My deepest gratitude to Stedman Mays, agent extraordinaire; Chrissy Guthrie,
Stacy Kennedy, and Elizabeth Rea at Wiley; and Carol Owens. These wonderful
people helped make the revision of this book possible, and their help has been
very much appreciated. You’re all absolutely outstanding in your profession
and pleasures to work with.
Originally, much of the art for this book was done by the late Phyllis Barbieri,
whose help was invaluable and whose loss is deeply felt. She and technical
reviewer Laurette Koserowski, both from Traditional Quilter magazine, made
a great team. For the new edition of the book, I must thank artist Connie Rand
for her illustrations. Many thanks, too, to all the companies and individuals
who contributed time or product for this book, including:
Coats & Clark for the use of some past projects that I’d done for them as
well as their terrific assortment of threads and bias tape. (Thanks for the
occasional pep talk, Meta and Lynn!)
P&B Textiles, VIP Fabrics, Springs, RJR Fabrics, and Marcus Brothers
for the delectable fabrics used in these quilts. Your catalogs offer such
temptation to a fabric-phile like myself!
Handler Textile Corporation and Pellon for their fusible products and
stabilizers, which make machine appliqué a joy.
Nolting Manufacturing for professionally machine quilting several of the
larger projects in this book, saving me tons of time. Your generosity is
very much appreciated.
Fairfield Processing for the batting, pillow forms, and stuffing used in the
projects.
I would also like to express my heartfelt gratitude to my assistant and photog-
rapher, Mary Nevius. No matter how daunting the task, she always stepped up
to the plate and got it done.
Last but not least, I want to thank an inanimate object that I just know has
a soul hidden somewhere in its gears — my trusty sewing machine. It has
seen its share of quilts pass over its throat plate; it takes a lickin’ but keeps
on stitchin’!

Introduction
E
verybody loves quilts. They’re soft, cozy, and comforting, and they’ve
been around since man decided layers were the way to go. What more and
more people have been realizing over the years, though, is that making quilts
is fun and a wonderful way to express one’s creativity with a practical bent.
Quilt making provides a wonderful opportunity to experiment with color,
design, texture, and shape even if you’re convinced you don’t have an artistic
bone in your body. Let your imagination guide you in choosing your fabrics
and projects. Making quilts today is easier than you may have ever imagined;
what’s more, quilt making doesn’t require any special skills, just a general
knowledge of sewing and the desire to try! If you can sew a button or mend 
a hem, you can make a quilt. With just a few basic tools, a small amount of
fabric, and a little time, you can create your own piece of comfort. This book
shows you how. (And don’t worry about mistakes — they add to the charm 
of your finished project.)
And speaking of projects! The range of quilted objects you can create is 
limitless! Think beyond the traditional bed quilt, and consider making
quilted place mats, hot pads, or a table runner for your kitchen or to give 
as a host or hostess gift. You can even create quilted wall hangings as art
for your home.
About This Book
This book guides even the beginningest-beginner through all the steps neces-
sary for creating a first quilt. Although most people interested in quilting
have sewn a bit, you can use this book even if your sewing experience is lim-
ited to threading a needle. If you’re in the shallow end of the experience pool,
you can simply start small, build experience and confidence, and eventually
move on to tackling your grand design.
I show you how to select fabrics and materials, create a design, and then cut,
piece, quilt, and finish your creation — all within the covers of this book. 
And to kick-start you in putting the skills covered in the book to actual use, 
I include 17 projects to fit any skill level. All are easy to create when you
follow the illustrated and detailed step-by-step instructions.

Conventions Used in This Book
I used a few conventions when writing this book. Here they are:
 Each time I introduce a new quilting term, I italicize it.
 Step instructions and keywords that you should pay attention to in lists
appear in boldface.
 Web sites and e-mail addresses appear in monofont to make them 
stand out.
What You’re Not to Read
Of course, I’d love for you to read this book from cover to cover. After all, 
I’ve worked pretty hard on it, and it includes some great tips and tricks I’ve
learned over the years! However, I do live in the real world, and I realize that
you may be pressed for time and just want the bare-bones facts. If that’s you,
you can safely skip the sidebars, which appear in gray boxes, and any para-
graphs that have the Technical Stuff icon attached. Reading these tidbits will
enhance your quilting knowledge, but you can get by just fine without them.
Foolish Assumptions
I hate to assume anything about anyone I’ve never met, but when writing this
book, I did have to make a few assumptions about who may be reading it. If
you fit into any of the following categories, this book is for you:
 You’re someone who has admired the art of quilt making from afar, but
until now, you’ve been too skittish to try it.
 You’re already in the process of learning to quilt and want a good, basic
guide to help you build your skills.
 You’ve discovered that you’re a fabric junkie and want to figure out what
to do with all the great fabrics you’ve accumulated.
 Your favorite auntie is insisting you learn to quilt so that when you
inherit her fabric stash, you can actually do something with it.
How This Book Is Organized
For logic and ease of use, this book is organized into six parts, the chapters
of which progress from the most basic definition of a quilt and its parts
2
Quilting for Dummies, 2nd Edition 

through various skills and techniques that will help you create your quilt.
This section gives you a brief description of each of these parts.
Part I: Gathering Your Tools 
and Getting Ready
A quilt may be made up of fabric, batting, and thread, but those aren’t the
only things you need to produce the final product. In this part, I go over all
the basics of a quilt’s components and talk a lot about the necessary supplies
and tools you need to get started. I also share my hints about fabric selection
and choosing the right batting for your project.
Part II: Planning Your Masterpiece
Quilts break down into a variety of elements, from blocks and strips to bor-
ders and appliqués. In this part, I introduce you to all these design elements
and guide you through the general processes of creating quilt blocks and
using templates. Here, you find out how to make templates, transfer markings
to your fabrics, and design your own quilts either from your doodles or using
your computer.
Part III: Sharpening Your Sewing Skills
Quilting gives you lots of creative flexibility, but it’s important to remember
that creativity doesn’t trump precision. Careful measuring, cutting, and press-
ing are crucial if you want your quilt to lay crisp and flat. This part tells you
what you need to know to stay on the straight and narrow with your quilting
skills. I also give you a primer on appliqué, a potentially challenging tech-
nique that really pays off by giving you even more decorative and creative
options.
Part IV: Ahead to the Finish: 
Quilting the Pieces in Place
Ultimately, your quilt is a creatively stitched-together sandwich of fabric 
(the bread) and batting (the filling). This part helps you build the coziest of
quilt sandwiches, getting all your creative juices flowing. When you’ve read
through these chapters, you should know enough to get started on a project
of your own (if you haven’t already). Basting, stitching, and binding are all
covered here, so you’re sure to finish your masterpiece in style.

Introduction

Part V: Completing the 
Circle: Projects to Try
If you’re anxious to start quilting but don’t have any of your own projects or
designs in mind, this part provides 17 projects to get you started. These proj-
ects are all suitable for rank beginners and cover a wide range of styles and
techniques, so you’re sure to find something that gets your quilting fingers
twitching.
I provide patterns for the appliqué projects, but for some you need to run to
your trusty copy center and enlarge them to full-size. (They’re reproduced
here at 50 percent; my ideas are clearly bigger than this book.)
Part VI: The Part of Tens
In the grand For Dummies tradition, the Part of Tens is a patchwork part — 
a little of this, a little of that, and lots of information and inspiration as you
become absorbed into the quilting world. Practice timesaving techniques
that give you time for more quilts, try out some suggestions for displaying
your works of fabric art, and find out what judges look for in a prizewinning
quilt show entry. I also created an Appendix to the book, which is full of 
ways you can meet fellow quilters and shop for quilting supplies and such 
in cyberspace.
Icons Used in This Book
Sprinkled throughout this book are cute little pictures called icons that high-
light important information. Here’s the decoder key:
This icon highlights important quilting basics. Whenever you quilt, whether
by hand or machine, you need to remember and apply this information —
these are the eternal truths of the craft.
This icon indicates information that you don’t absolutely have to know in
order to work on a quilting project — but it can be helpful.
4
Quilting for Dummies, 2nd Edition 

This icon points out time-tested great ways to do things regardless of how
you’re quilting or how long you’ve been doing it.
Whatever you do, don’t skip information that has this icon attached to it.
It points out things that could wreck your project and maybe even put
your love affair with quilting on the rocks.
Where to Go from Here
Use this book in the way that makes the most sense for your situation:
You can read it cover to cover or just skip around to specific chapters that
interest you. If you already wield some sewing abilities, you’ll probably
progress through this book somewhat faster than true novices, adding new
skills and developing new techniques. Think of this book as your own little
quilting bee, with me as your friendly, down-to-earth mentor who presents
the information you need in a way that’s easy to understand and inspiring
to try.
As soon as you piece your first block, I have no doubt you’ll be hooked on
quilting, as thousands of people all around the world are. You’ll suddenly find
yourself unconsciously setting aside time from your own busy schedule to
collect fabric (most quilters are true fabri-holics), cut, and stitch. Pieces
of fabric will unexpectedly appear in your hands each time you sit down,
whether you’re watching television, riding the bus, or taking some time for
yourself. You’ll find that quilting somehow helps you relax after a hard day.
Oh, to shut yourself off in your own wonderful, colorful world of fabric and
thread!
Although I’ve attempted to include everything a beginner could want in a
quilt book, keep in mind that there are as many ways of making a quilt
as there are quilters and far more additional techniques, hints, and tidbits
than this book’s space allows. So in addition to gathering a nice stash
of fabric, I encourage you to start building a library of quilting reference
materials; I include some of my favorite reference works and supply sources
in the Appendix to nudge you along. Happy quilting!

In This Chapter
 Deconstructing the quilt
 Exploring the history of quilt making
 Appreciating quilting today
F
or centuries, quilts have played an important role in people’s lives, pro-
viding their makers and recipients not only with warmth and comfort but
also with colorful, attractive works of art. Traditionally, quilts also have been
showcases for the talents and skills of their creators.
Throughout history, most households, regardless of income level, had certain
quilts used only for special occasions or when honored guests visited. Quilt
makers put their greatest efforts into these quilts, using the best quality
fabric they could afford and covering them with miles and miles of beautiful
quilting stitches. Many of these rarely used “best quilts” survive today as a
testament to the history of quilting and the talents of their makers and are
highly coveted by quilt collectors.
In this chapter, I explain what a quilt is and document the quilt’s rich role in
the texture of human life. I also share some of the newest developments in
quilting and talk a bit about how quilting has become a modern form of artis-
tic expression.
Following the Recipe for 
a Fabric Sandwich
A quilt — that soft, cozy, comforting hunk of fabric and filling — in its simplest
sense is a textile sandwich; in fact, that’s how the quilt layers are traditionally
described. This simple sandwich is what distinguishes a quilt from any other
sewn object.

All quilts — whether intended for use on a bed or as a simple potholder —
consist of three layers:
 Pieced or appliquéd quilt top
 Filling (called batting or wadding)
 Fabric backing
The top, batting, and backing layers are held together, or quilted, using a
series of basic running stitches. You can also tie the layers together by stitch-
ing yarn, narrow ribbon, or pearl cotton through the layers at regular intervals
and tying off the ends. However you do it, your goal is to prevent the layers
from shifting during regular use and washing. You can see a cross section of a
quilt in Figure 1-1.
Some folks call various types of bedcoverings “quilts,” but if it doesn’t con-
sist of three layers (top, filling, and backing), it isn’t really a quilt but rather 
a coverlet, bedspread, or throw. Also, although the word “quilt” is casually
used to refer to a quilted bedcovering, many other objects — such as place
mats, vests, wall hangings, and diaper bags — can be quilted.
The quilt top
The topmost layer of the quilt sandwich is the quilt top, which is typically
made of fabric blocks that are pieced, appliquéd, or crafted using a mixture
of both techniques. Quilt tops can also be devoid of individual blocks, made
instead of whole cloth.
Piecing things together
A pieced (also called patchwork) quilt top can be made up of tens to hundreds
of small pieces of fabric joined together by hand or machine to create a pat-
tern or repeating design. Modern cutting and stitching techniques make 
the work of piecing both fun and easy to do. I discuss these techniques in
Chapters 8 and 9.

Part I: Gathering Your Tools and Getting Ready 

Patchwork is the most recognized form of quilt making and was devised as a
way to turn a bunch of fabric odds and ends into one cohesive unit, eliminating
waste by using any fabric available. Over the centuries it evolved into the art
form we know today. Patchwork uses basic shapes such as squares, triangles,
rectangles, and hexagons to form patterns ranging from simple to complex.
To create a patchwork top, you piece various patterns together into one block
and then piece each block to another to create the overall quilt design. I talk
more about patchwork in Chapter 4.
Layering up with appliqué
Appliqué is another method of creating quilt tops. To create an appliquéd top,
you stitch various fabric shapes onto a base fabric. In the past, appliqué was
used mainly for “best quilts” — the quilts used when company was expected —
because of the money and time involved in making them. Stitching a piece 
of fabric on top of another piece wasn’t a very frugal use of precious fabric,
making the quilts more expensive to create than patchwork ones. Appliqué
also takes a bit longer to stitch than piecing, but the appliqué method allows
you to create interesting patterns that can’t be pieced, such as dainty flowers
with gracefully curving stems.
You can do appliqué work either by hand or by machine. Machine appliqué
provides a variety of creative possibilities and is easy enough for even the
rank beginner to master yet can be done intricately enough to produce a
masterpiece worthy of a blue ribbon at the state fair. Chapter 10 covers
appliqué in more detail.
Working with the whole top
Whole cloth quilts are one more branch of the quilt tree that bears mentioning.
These were the fanciest of quilts, often created by wealthy women for only the
most distinguished guests. In whole-cloth quilting, the quilt top consists of
one large piece of fabric without seams (wide fabric widths were uncommon
and very costly before the invention of modern fabric looms in the 18th cen-
tury). This single piece is intricately quilted with delicate, closely-spaced
stitching designs. One of the unique features of a whole cloth quilt is that it’s
reversible, with the front being identical to the back. In France, these types of
quilts are known as boutis. Today, whole cloth quilts are often referred to as
white work or bridal quilts, and due to their intricacy, they’re still reserved for
the best occasions.
The batting
The middle layer, or filling, of a quilt consists of cotton, wool, silk, or poly-
ester batting (also referred to as “wadding” in some parts of the world).
11
Chapter 1: The Art of Quilting

Batting is a very important component of a quilt; in fact, it’s the batting that
makes a quilt truly a quilt. Without that wonderful, soft inner layer, you have
a coverlet rather than a quilt. Batting adds depth and dimension to the quilt
in that it buffers the quilt top and bottom, and it gives quilts the loft and cozi-
ness that make them so special.
Before the invention of commercial quilt batting, quilt makers used whatever
they could find as filler. Wool was usually the filler of choice because it could
be fluffed, laid out, and felted by dampening, pounding, and rolling the fibers
until they meshed together. Quilt making got a whole lot easier when the first
commercial quilt batting was produced from cotton in 1846. Cotton is still
one of the favorite choices for quilt batting today.
I talk more about batting options and selection in Chapter 3.
The backing
The bottom layer of the sandwich, the backing, is a large piece of plain or
printed cotton that may or may not be pieced together from smaller pieces 
to create the proper size. I talk more about the backing in Chapter 3.
After you assemble the three layers that make up a quilt, you have a sand-
wich of sorts: the quilt top and backing fabric enclose a layer of batting. The
next step is to quilt the sandwich, meaning that you secure the three layers
together by hand or machine stitching them into one cohesive and cozy unit.
“Quilt-thropology:” A Brief 
History of Quilt Making
Quilt making isn’t just an American pastime; it has roots in Europe, South
America, and Asia as well. Quilts were essential articles in households of the
past, but they weren’t used only as bedcoverings. You may be surprised to
find out that quilts were used as curtains to keep out drafts, draped on sup-
ports and used as tents, used to cover doorways when no door was there,
and used as petticoats and waistcoats to keep the body warm. Really thick
quilts were even used as armor! Need proof? Head out to a Renaissance fair
with a battle reenactment and you’ll see something very similar to the quilted
armor of our historical past.
Because quilts were so useful, quilting lessons began early in life. As soon 
as a young girl was able to manipulate a needle, she began her quilting and
sewing career. Historic records show quilts included in a bride’s dowry, and
12
Part I: Gathering Your Tools and Getting Ready 

no self-respecting bride’s family would allow her to marry without a certain
number of quilted items in her hope chest.
The power of patchwork
Patchwork quilting evolved from the frugality of homemakers in times when
fabric wasn’t very plentiful; it was a way to use up fabric odds and ends, ensur-
ing nothing went to waste. Necessity truly was the mother of invention. Women
saved every scrap from other sewing projects, and they often recycled worn
out items into patches for quilts. Most patchwork quilts were intended for
everyday use and were simply patched up when they became worn. If they
became too worn, these tattered quilts were often used as fillers for new quilts.
During the U.S. Civil War, patchwork quilts also served another purpose:
Many quilts featured special blocks or combinations of colors that made
them function as maps of the Underground Railroad, guiding America’s slaves
from one safe house to another during this tumultuous time in history.
Leaving a social legacy
Quilt making has always been an important social activity. The quilting bee
was one of the few opportunities women had to retreat from the backbreak-
ing chores of farm life and spend time with one another. These groups of
ladies (and sometimes men) often worked together on special presentation
quilts to commemorate weddings or births or to express appreciation to
members of their communities. These presentation quilts — which often
included the signatures of the many makers, either written poetically on the
blocks in permanent ink or embroidered in thread — became known as auto-
graph or album quilts.
13
Chapter 1: The Art of Quilting
Proof that quilting goes way back
The oldest quilted object found thus far, which
may date from around the first century B.C., is a
rug taken from a Siberian tomb. Quilting may
also have been practiced by the ancient
Egyptians: Carvings at some ancient sites show
the use of objects that have a quilted appear-
ance. As well, many ancient nomadic peoples
created quilted fabrics to use as tents, insulat-
ing them from the cold.
The oldest known quilted objects from Europe
include armor, saddle blankets, and whole cloth
quilts from Sicily.

Autograph quilts became popular around 1840 and were made in a variety 
of styles: Some were constructed of identical pieced blocks, and others con-
sisted of individual appliquéd blocks. Commemorative autograph quilts in
elaborate red and green appliqué were quite popular on the east coast of the
United States during the 1800s and are known as the Baltimore Album style.
From a style that originated in the Baltimore, Maryland, area, these quilts
were often made to welcome a new minister to the community, to celebrate 
a wedding, or to give as a gift on a young man’s 21st birthday.
Quilting bees were an established community tradition by the mid-1800s and
were even introduced to the Hawaiian Islands by missionaries during this
time. The Hawaiian tradition of whole-cloth quilts appliquéd with whole cloth
appliqués (basically one huge appliqué centered on one large piece of back-
ground fabric) evolved from this point into the unique art form it is today.
Today, community-created quilts are made to honor the fallen (such as the
quilts made after 9/11); bring hope to the sick and those afflicted with AIDS,
cancer, and other illnesses; and bring comfort to premature babies and the
homeless. Quilting is still bringing people together to stitch, chat, and enjoy
each other’s company.
A Persistent Pastime: Quilting Today
Although they continue to add warmth to many a household, today’s quilts
are no longer a necessity but rather a means of self-expression. Today’s quilt

The secret of Granny’s petticoats
Have you ever wondered what granny wore
under her billowing skirts to keep warm during
icy-cold winters? The answer is a quilt! Garment
exhibits at museums often display fine examples
of quilted petticoats, corset covers, and waist-
coats.
Quilted petticoats for everyday wear were very
simple and usually made of wool, serving mainly
to keep their wearers warm. The filler material in
many of these old petticoats was wool wadding,
but some more frugal gals actually used horse-
hair — sounds like an itch-fest to me!
Other petticoats served decorative purposes
only. These were elaborately quilted and were
probably reserved for special occasions or for
times when skirts were pinned up to show
underskirts and petticoats, depending on the
fashion rules of the day. (Showing more petti-
coat than the rules of proper conduct allowed
may have been considered scandalous!) In the
1800s, these fancy petticoats were made of
quilted silk or taffeta.
Some quilted items, such as corset covers, had
both form and function. They were designed to
be supportive but were also highly decorative.

makers have a dizzying array of fabrics to choose from and decorative
threads and other great items to incorporate into their designs. Quilts stores
are popping up everywhere offering quilters seemingly boundless choices of
fabrics and patterns as well as inspiration. For quilters who enjoy making the
quilt tops but aren’t too keen on doing the actual quilting, many shops offer
quilting services for a fee to their customers and keep a long-arm sewing
machine in the back room just for this purpose.
Quilt making today is a hobby enjoyed by men and women alike (although
women, with their needle-nimble fingers, still predominate). In many cases,
machine techniques have replaced tedious hand piecing and appliqué, but
modern quilt makers still take inspiration from quilts of days past, adapting
those designs and techniques to today’s lifestyles. For example, although
some quilts are still made from fabric scraps, the maker is more likely to 
use the patchwork approach to recreate the charming look of old quilts or 
to commemorate a life or an event than for reasons of necessity.
Quilting as an art form has become very chic. I’m always amazed at the
number of museums here in the United States and abroad that feature art quilt
exhibits, and you can even find museums dedicated solely to the art of quilt-
ing. Quilting has certainly come a long way throughout the centuries — it has
become fiber art.
Artistic quilters are dyeing their own fabrics and block-printing unique hand-
made designs on fabric to create custom textiles for their art quilts. These
artists create their own patterns inspired by nature (such as watercolors or
landscapes), geometry (such as kaleidoscopes and tessellations, those nifty
interlocking block designs that are all identical and fit together neatly and go
on into infinity), or life in general (such as portrait quilting, life stories, or
dedications). They also mix traditional and unusual fibers with other media,
such as paint, beading, embroidery, and even plastic.
Exhibits of gorgeous quilted art at local art museums are fairly common.
To find one near you, check your local paper, visit your local art museum’s
Web site, or check with the local quilting guild. You’ll be amazed by what
you see on display!
New technologies are also inspiring new generations of quilters. Software
allows quilts to be designed, viewed, and altered before a single cut is made
or stitch is taken, and special products now make it possible to print fabric
using a computer and printer. An ancient art form has gone high-tech.
Talented, dedicated quilters have elevated the art of quilting to an entirely
new level, creating a veritable fiber revolution (if I sound excited, it’s because
I am!).

Do quilting bees still buzz?
Great-granny probably didn’t get out all that
much, considering the lack of transportation
available to her and the fact that she may have
lived out on a farm in the middle of nowhere.
This is why a quilting bee was so important to
her — it was one of her main means of social-
izing with other women and staying in touch
with her community.
Although the quilting bees of days past served a
very important purpose, they no longer exist in
the same capacity. Society is considerably
more mobile now, and a quilting bee is no longer
a necessity for social interaction. But before
you panic, consider what has replaced it — the
quilting guild.
These days, most quilters are members of or
have attended some form of a quilting guild.
Most guilds meet for a few hours on a monthly
or bimonthly basis to share news of quilting,
show off finished projects, and work on projects
in-progress. Some also work on community
service projects, such as quilts for the home-
less or house-bound, quilts and layettes for
premture babies, and memorial quilts for AIDS 
victims and their families, to name just a few.
Many guilds have special programs that bring
in top teachers from all over the country, and
they often host yearly quilt shows, which are an
excellent opportunity to check out what other
quilters in your area are working on!
Finding a quilting guild is easy. Simply ask at the
local quilting supply store or fabric retailer, or
check with your local library. Be sure to find out
what the “visitation” policy is ahead of time;
some guilds allow one or two visits before
requiring membership and a nominal fee, and
others may charge a per-visit fee (a buck or
two). To find out what types of events are being
planned by your local guild, contact their pro-
gram chairperson.
Don’t think you have the time for a guild but like
to spend hours surfing the Web? Consider a
cyber-guild. The Internet is full of great places
for quilters to interact with each other without
ever leaving their homes!

Threads, Needles, and Gadgets —
And All That Jazz
In This Chapter
 Choosing thread for assembly and hand appliqué
 Thread choices for machine quilting and appliqué
 Finding the right thread for quilting by hand
 Gathering gadgets and gizmos that make quilting easier
You may think that fabric selection, which I cover in Chapter 3, is the
most important part of prepping for your quilting adventure, but I’ve got
news for you: Gathering the right equipment — threads, needles, gadgets,
and gizmos — is just as critical. Unfortunately, as with most things, no one
choice is right for every situation.
For example, suppose you want to buy a simple spool of thread. Well, there’s
no such thing. Step into any sewing supplies store and you’ll find yourself
facing an endless array of little spools of every thickness and color imaginable.
If you choose a spool of thread just because it matches your fabric, there’s a
good chance you aren’t making the right choice.
In this chapter, I explain all you need to know in order to select the right
thread for the task at hand and assemble your team of tools, including 
both the essentials and the fun — but optional — toys.
A Thread for Every Occasion
Just as there are different sizes of nuts and bolts for almost every purpose, so
is the story with thread. You can choose from all-purpose, buttonhole-twist,
rayon, cotton, and silk. How about woolly nylon? Do you need monofilament,
extra-fine, or metallic? Do you want basting thread or darning thread? And to
make things even more complicated, consider color. Cotton, mercerized
cotton, and nylon thread all come in a wide range of colors. So which thread
is the best thread for your project? This section helps you figure that out.

For help with thread selection at-a-glance, see Table 2-1. I explain the uses of
the different threads in the sections that follow.

As for the other threads you may find in the store, ignore them — they’re not
quilt-worthy.
Assembly threads
For small-scale assembly, such as when you’re stitching together the pieces of
fabric in a quilt block, or large-scale assembly, such as when you’re sewing the
18
Part I: Gathering Your Tools and Getting Ready 

quilt blocks together to form a quilt top, choose an all-purpose thread to coor-
dinate with your fabrics. I know what you’re thinking: It’s pretty unlikely that
one thread color will coordinate with all the fabrics you use in a particular
project. You may use many different colors of fabric in one project, making it
impractical (if not impossible) to select a thread to match every fabric and
change thread each time you stitch two pieces together. So here’s my advice:
When in doubt, select a thread from the mid-color range — one that falls
somewhere between your darkest and lightest fabric colors.
All-purpose thread is the most commonly used thread and is available in
nearly every color in the spectrum. It’s strong and durable because it’s made
from mercerized (treated) cotton with a polyester core (called poly-core). The
great thing about all-purpose thread is that you can use it for both hand and
machine stitching.
Some quilting “purists” prefer to use nothing but 100 percent cotton in their
quilts because they really like the idea of all-cotton quilts. This thread choice
is perfectly acceptable, too. Like all-purpose thread, 100 percent cotton
thread is also available in a reasonably nice range of colors,
If you decide to go with 100 percent cotton thread, be sure to select one that
has been mercerized, or treated with a caustic soda; this treatment adds
strength and durability to the thread. After all, you want your project to 
eventually become an heirloom, right?
Machine-quilting threads
For machine quilting, which I cover in Chapter 13, you have several thread
options: all-purpose, monofilament, buttonhole-twist, variegated, and 
metallic.
For standard, everyday machine quilting, all-purpose thread is a safe bet.
Some manufacturers market machine quilting thread, but in some instances,
the thread is really just repackaged all-purpose thread. This isn’t an attempt
at deception but rather the manufacturer’s way of helping you select the
right thread for your needs. The thread choice for standard machine quilting
is really up to you.
If you prefer to end up with “invisible” stitches, choose a nylon monofilament
thread. Monofilaments are available in clear and smoke colors; the clear is
great for bright fabrics mixed with white or off-white fabrics, and the smoke
is best for darker fabrics. No matter the color, monofilament thread is
durable and hides all manner of mistakes.

Chapter 2: Threads, Needles, and Gadgets — And All That Jazz

For a fun and more noticeable effect, try using buttonhole-twist, variegated,
or metallic thread for machine quilting.
 Buttonhole-twist is a heavier version of all-purpose thread and has a
thick, dramatic effect. For extra pizzazz, use buttonhole-twist in a color
that contrasts with your fabric!
 Variegated threads contain banding of several colors in one thread.
These threads are wonderful for quilting on patterned fabrics because
the color bands tend to get lost in the pattern, so they don’t stand out
awkwardly.
 Metallic thread looks . . . well, metallic. The added sparkle is beautiful in
holiday projects in particular.
Metallic thread is notorious for breaking easily during stitching, so you
should try different brands whenever possible. If you change brands but
still have breakage, look for a metallic thread with a softer feel to it. Also,
using metallic threads in machine quilting will dull your needle quickly
(just like you’d end up with really dull scissors if you used them to cut
metal). In order to keep your machine in tiptop quilting shape, be sure
to insert a fresh needle after using metallic threads.
Hand-quilting threads
Hand-quilting thread is available in two different forms, both of which are
slightly heavier than all-purpose thread:
 Polyester-core, cotton-wrapped thread with a polished finish
 100 percent cotton thread with a polished finish
The polished finish on hand-quilting threads provides abrasion resistance,
making it easier to stitch with, and helps keep the thread from tangling. If 
you run into knotting and tangling problems during hand quilting, however,
run your thread through a beeswax cake before threading your needle. The
beeswax acts as a lubricant and helps prevent any handling problems. You
can find beeswax in the same departments as needles and quilting supplies 
in most fabric stores.
Appliqué threads
For machine appliqué, all-purpose thread is a fine option, but it’s not your
only one. You can also choose from a number of other types of threads, many
of which add visual interest to your final product.
20
Part I: Gathering Your Tools and Getting Ready 

 Rayon and polyester threads are very fine and have a beautiful luster.
They’re especially good choices if you’re doing satin stitch appliqué
(see Chapter 10 for details).
Rayon and polyester threads’ sole purposes in life are to be decorative,
so don’t use them for assembly.
 Metallic and textured specialty threads add special visual effects that
catch the eye. Try using a wooly thread to appliqué a teddy bear, giving
it a touchable texture, or experiment with a textured multi-colored
thread for a bit of pizzazz.
 Buttonhole-twist thread is very thick and used mainly for topstitching,
which is regular old straight stitching. However, I recommend you
use buttonhole-twist thread for appliqué because this thread makes 
buttonhole-stitch appliqué look like time-consuming hand embroidery!
The thickness of the thread is what does the trick.
 Nylon monofilament is the thread of choice for invisible machine
appliqué.
For hand appliqué, all-purpose and silk threads are good choices because 
of the wonderful range of colors they come in (your appliqué thread often
needs to match your appliqué fabric) and because of the way they handle
in a hand-sewing needle. Thick (such as buttonhole-twist) or fine threads
(such as monofilament) don’t handle well in a hand-sewing needle.
If you find yourself in a pinch, you can use a single strand of embroidery floss
for hand appliqué work.
Stocking Up on Sewing Basket Essentials
So you’ve got a great sewing basket . . . now what do you put in it? This sec-
tion runs through the basic supplies that should be in every sewing basket,
whether you’re ready to start quilting or just thinking about it.
Scissors — One pair won’t cut it
Read carefully: You need at least two pairs of scissors, with one pair reserved
for fabric cutting only. Nothing dulls an expensive pair of fabric scissors
faster than cutting paper or cardboard, so get a really good pair of fabric scis-
sors and tag them with a skull and crossbones if necessary! Hide them if you
have to, or lock them away. Do whatever it takes to protect your precious
snips, and be sure to tell family members about your scissors rules. Let the
21
Chapter 2: Threads, Needles, and Gadgets — And All That Jazz

would-be scissors-snaggers know that if you catch them using your fabric
scissors to cut anything other than fabric, they’ll face some severe conse-
quences (I’ll leave the punishment up to your imagination). Relegate your
second pair of scissors to all other tasks. Use these all-purpose scissors to
cut templates or clip patterns.
Whether for cutting fabric or general use, if your scissors become dull, get-
ting them sharpened is easy enough. Most fabric and craft stores contract
with local sharpening services that pick up and deliver freshly sharpened
scissors to the store within a few days. If you have the sneaking suspicion
that your fabric scissors are going to be commandeered for other uses,
cheapies are okay too as long as you cycle them out of your sewing basket
(toss them or relegate them to the kitchen junk drawer) as soon as they
become dull. Cheap scissors really aren’t worth the expense to sharpen —
you’re better off just investing in a new pair.
You may also want to get small, sharp scissors for cutting appliqués or thread
snips for trimming threads. Thread snips are little trimmers with a squeeze
handle that make snipping small threads a bit easier because all you have to
do is grab the snips and pinch the thread. Although neither is truly neces-
sary, they’re nice to have (and we quilters do love our gadgets). If you decide
to expand to your scissor repertoire, reserve these additions for cutting
fabric and thread only. Figure 2-1 shows three types of scissors.

Needles for sewing by hand
When it comes to needles, you need them for two different purposes: general
sewing and quilting. Because some needles work better than others for some
tasks, a “household assortment” of needles is handy because it usually con-
tains a variety of needle lengths and widths.
Household needles are called sharps; they’re fine (very narrow) needles with
small, round eyes. These needles are called “sharps” simply because they 
are — they penetrate fabric (even multiple layers) easily. Sharps are suitable
for hand piecing and appliqué.
When selecting needles, remember this: The smaller the number, the larger
the needle. Sharps in size 8 or 9 work well for quilting, but you should always
choose a needle that you’re comfortable with. Some folks prefer a small
needle, and others like ’em big! If your hands are large, you certainly don’t
want to struggle with a teensy-weensy needle — it’ll feel more like a splinter
than a sewing tool. If your hands are small, choose a smaller needle rather
than one that feels like a metal toothpick with a thread hanging out one end.
If you have trouble threading general-purpose needles, look for easy-
threading needles with slotted eyes.
For hand quilting, select needles called betweens. Like sharps, betweens are
fine needles, but they’re generally shorter than sharps and are made espe-
cially for quilting or other detailed handwork. Size 8 is a good size for the
beginner, but many long-time quilters prefer size 12, which is really tiny; its
diminutive, narrow size allows the quilter complete control and enables the
quilter to take quite a few very small stitches onto the needle before passing
it completely through the quilt. With a longer needle, you have less control
while quilting because your fingers are further from the fabric.
Seam ripper
Unless you’re one of those lucky people who never, ever makes a mistake,
you definitely need a seam ripper, shown in Figure 2-2. As my own grand-
mother used to say, “As ye sew, so shall ye rip!” Mistakes are a common
aspect of quilting. Get used to it.
Practice using your seam ripper on a few scraps of fabric sewn together,
making sure that you cut only the thread without ripping into the fabric.
Keep your seam ripper handy when sewing, and be sure to replace it now 
and then — seam rippers dull with use. Seam rippers are cheap, so don’t fret
about replacement. And you may want to keep several on hand because they
tend to get lost easily.
23
Chapter 2: Threads, Needles, and Gadgets — And All That Jazz

Measuring tape and marking implements
Measuring tapes are handy for a number of things: checking seam allowances,
creating patterns, measuring fabric, and so on. I like to use a retractable fabric
tape measure, but any small measuring tape does the job — even a dressmak-
ers tape. Figure 2-3 shows a retractable measuring tape.
A standard #2 pencil, the kind of pencil you needed in grade school to fill out
those standardized tests, is a useful addition to your sewing basket, but don’t
use it to mark fabrics. For that job, you need an assortment of water-soluble
marking tools. At your sewing supply store, look for pencils and pens specifi-
cally designed for marking on fabrics — they’re guaranteed to wash out and
not harm your fabrics.

Personally, I don’t use pens of any kind — not even those meant for use on
fabrics. I prefer to stick to fabric-marking pencils or tailor’s chalk. Both wash
out beautifully and never soak through fabric to the other side. My favorites
are EZ Quilting Washout Pencils, which are available in blue, white, and
yellow. I also like the Berol Marking Pencils available in silver, white, blue,
yellow, rose, and #4 graphite.
Never, never, never ever, ever, ever use a standard pen or marker on your fab-
rics. The ink may become permanent, especially after pressing, and the dark
lines show through to the other side of fabrics, making unsightly marks in
your finished quilt. Also, beware of anything that says “fade-away” or “vanish-
ing fabric marker.” These marks fade rapidly (usually within about 48 hours,
or quicker if you leave the fabric in direct sunlight), and you may have to re-
mark your fabric when you least expect it.
Needle threader
A needle threader (see Figure 2-4) is a great tool to have in your sewing
basket because you never know when you’ll have trouble with a particular
thread or needle or will simply be trying to thread a needle in low light.
(The best of the best needle threaders has a magnifier on one end.)
Thimble
Eventually (maybe even at first!), you’re going to prick your finger with a
needle. Seeing as you probably don’t want blood on your quilt top (although I
tell you how to remove blood spots in Chapter 13), invest in a thimble or two.
Figure 2-4:

25
Chapter 2: Threads, Needles, and Gadgets — And All That Jazz

Thimbles help protect your fingers from needle pokes and sticks. You wear a
thimble on the finger that pushes the needle through the fabric, but you may
also want to wear a finger protector on your other hand as well. Several dif-
ferent types of thimbles are available, including varieties made of metal, 
plastic, and leather (see Figure 2-5). Others are adjustable or fit around 
long fingernails, so there really is a thimble out there for everyone.
Get a thimble that fits your finger snugly without being tight. Because thim-
bles are inexpensive, try a few different styles to find the one that’s most
comfortable and most effective for you. You may find that you like certain
thimbles better for different applications.
Most right-handed quilters wear their thimbles on the middle finger of the right
hand, using it to help push the needle through the fabric without piercing
the skin of the “pushing” finger. It’s also helpful to wear a leather protector
on the “receiving” finger — the one positioned under the work to help guide
the needle (either the middle or index finger on most folks). If you’re a lefty,
reverse these tips!
Pins and pincushions
Quilters can never have too many pins. Straight pins are indispensable for
holding pieces of fabric together and holding appliqués in place. And you
can’t have lots of pins without a pincushion, which prevents the pins from
rolling off your work surface and onto the floor — and later finding their way
into someone’s foot!
I prefer magnetic pincushions because they’re an easy target to hit when you’re
pulling pins with one hand and guiding fabric through the machine with the
other (you only have to get the pins close enough for the magnets to attract
them). Magnetic pincushions also work great when you accidentally knock the
whole shebang off your work table and your pins scatter all over the floor.
Simply hold the empty or near-empty pincushion a few inches above the floor
in the spill-zone and watch your pins fly back to the pincushion!
Figure 2-5:
Let your
thimble get

26
Part I: Gathering Your Tools and Getting Ready 

Be wary of pin spills on carpet, however. If pins are lodged in the carpet
fibers, the magnet may not pull them out, and you’ll most certainly end up
with one sticking right through your house slippers. (I know what you wear
while sewing — don’t play coy with me!)
If you decide not to thread baste your quilt sandwich (see Chapter 12), safety
pins are a must-have for holding the layers of your quilt together for machine
quilting. To prevent potential rust stains, choose large, nickel-plated brass
finish pins, often labeled “quilting safety pins,” at the fabric store.
Glue stick
A glue stick may not sound like a typical sewing basket staple, but it’s a neat
and tidy way to hold small appliqués in place in areas when pins are just too
large or cumbersome. You can use either a standard glue stick from an office
supply store or one specifically designed for fabrics, which you can find at a
fabric store. Both work and wash out equally well.
More Basics and Nice-to-Haves
Some supplies don’t fit into a sewing basket but are essential for successful
quilting nonetheless. Other supplies are just plain nice to have — sure, you
could do without them, but why should you? In no particular order, here’s a
list of large essentials and portable nice-to-haves:
 Sewing machine and extra all-purpose machine needles
 Iron and ironing board
 Traveling quilting pad, with a rotary-cutting and marking surface on one
side and an ironing/pressing surface on the other side
 Pressing cloth to protect specialty fabrics such as metallics, lamé, or
anything that could potentially melt during pressing
 Rotary cutting supplies, specifically a rotary cutter with extra blade, a
plastic see-through ruler, and a cutting mat
 Assorted plastic quilting templates, such as squares and triangles
 Quilting frame and hoops
 Graph paper and tracing paper
 Colored pencils for layout design ideas
 Masking tape
 Spray bottle of ouchie-fixer (you’re bound to go “Ouch!” at least once)
and a supply of bandages
The following sections zone in on some of these supplies.
27
Chapter 2: Threads, Needles, and Gadgets — And All That Jazz

Rotary cutting supplies
A rotary cutter is kind of like a pizza wheel with a very, very sharp blade. With
a rotary cutter, you can quickly and accurately cut through multiple layers of
fabric, drastically decreasing the time spent cutting out strips and patches.
Rotary cutters are easy to use regardless of whether you’re right- or left-
handed. Cutters come in a number of different sizes, but I recommend that
you purchase a larger cutter with a 45 mm blade one because it’s more com-
fortable to handle than the 28 mm size.
To protect your cutting surface, purchase an 18- x 26-inch or larger self-healing
rotary cutting mat. Choose a cutting mat that’s marked with 1-inch grid mark-
ings and bias lines.
Don’t attempt rotary cutting without the proper mat! You’re guaranteed to
destroy your cutting surface and dull or possibly even ruin your rotary blade
if you don’t have the right kind of protective mat.
To get neat, accurate fabric cuts with your rotary cutter, a 6- x 24-inch clear
plastic ruler and other sizes of clear plastic rulers and templates are espe-
cially helpful. These rulers and templates are clear so you can see your fabric
and the cutting mat grids through them, ensuring accuracy. In Figure 2-6, you
can see a variety of rotary cutting supplies. For more on rotary cutting, check
out Chapter 8.
After you get the hang of rotary cutting and are thoroughly hooked (trust me,
you will be!), consider investing in a rotary cutting system for quilters. These
systems have everything you need to cut quilt patches compiled into one
tidy parcel. You get a mat with attached guides, and rulers that pivot in every
direction, virtually eliminating the need for loose rulers and templates. All
you have to add is your favorite rotary cutter. I like the QuiltCut2 fabric cut-
ting system from Alto’s; it has a pivoting cutting guide that will cut everything
from blocks and stripes to triangles and hexagons. The system saves tons of
time and means I have less equipment to knock off the table.
Quilting hoops and frames
Quilting hoops and frames hold the layers of a quilt taut for hand quilting (see
Figure 2-7). A quilting hoop consists of two circles of plastic or wood that are
nestled together; a screw eye on the outer circle allows you to tighten and
loosen the tension of the hoops as necessary. If you’re a beginning quilter, 
you may want to stick to small projects that can be quilted easily in a hoop.
Although you can quilt large projects in hoops, doing so is usually a heavy and
cumbersome undertaking — after all, the weight of the project sits in your lap
when you use a hoop! (I talk more about quilting with hoops in Chapter 13.)
28
Part I: Gathering Your Tools and Getting Ready 

Hoops of varying sizes are available in any quilting or fabric store. A 20-inch
hoop is a good all-purpose hoop. You may also want a larger hoop — up to 
30 inches or so in diameter — for large-scale projects such as a bed quilts.
Remember, the smaller the hoop, the more you have to unfasten it to move
around and work on different areas of your quilt.
When you really fall victim to the quilting bug and start quilting regularly and
working on larger or more advanced projects, you may choose to invest (and
I do mean invest — they can be quite expensive) in a floor-standing quilt
frame, which you can see in Figure 2-8. Your local quilting or fabric store is
likely to sell quilting frames, and they’re also advertised in the backs of quilting
magazines. (For your convenience, I provide the names and phone numbers
of quilting frame manufacturers in the Appendix of this book.)
Paper and colored pencils
Graph paper, tracing paper, and colored pencils are great tools for sketching
ideas and working out designs. With colored pencils and graph paper, you
can experiment with different color combinations and ways of setting the
blocks in your quilt, and tracing paper allows you to trace patterns you like
directly from books and magazines.

Masking tape
Masking tape is an indispensable tool because it sticks without leaving any
sticky residue. I keep masking tape on hand in a variety of widths, including
1⁄4-, 1⁄2-, 1-, and 2-inch sizes. The narrow widths are great as straight-line quilting
guides, and I use the wider widths to securely hold a quilting project in place
as I baste the sandwich together. (Basting is pinning or stitching to keep the
layers in place while quilting.)

F
abric is to the quilter what paint is to the artist — you just can’t work
without it. So you want your fabrics to be beautiful, durable, and work
well together. Fortunately, fabrics suitable for quilting are very easy to find.
Most fabric stores have entire departments devoted to quilting fabrics,
where you can find fabrics in every color of the rainbow — enough to
dazzle the mind!
You also may want to expand your fabric search to stores that cater specifi-
cally to the needs of quilters (these are also great places to find all the fun
gadgets I describe in Chapter 6). Simply look up “fabric” or “quilting” in
the phone book, and you’re bound to find several promising listings for
your area.
It’s not uncommon to be dazzled by the swirl of colors and patterns when
you visit one of these fabric fantasies or page through a glossy catalog from
one of the mail-order houses described in the Appendix. However, this chap-
ter can help you keep a level head long enough to choose the right fabrics for
all the layers of your quilt. (And then, feeling proud of your carefully made
decisions, you can get impulsive and buy six yards of that sale-priced zebra
fun fur that you’ll never use.)
Quilting in Tall Cotton
For the best quilt results, cotton is king. I recommend using only 100 percent
cotton fabric for quilting because it’s light but sturdy and cool to the touch.

Cotton also holds a crease well, making it ideal for those turned-under edges
of hand appliqué. (I discuss appliqué in Chapter 10.) Best of all, it’s not slip-
pery or otherwise hard to manage.
I could go on and on about the wonders of cotton for quilting, but we
have more important things to get to, so I’ll just summarize a few more
of cotton’s pros:
 It’s easy to sew through by hand or machine.
 If you make a slight mistake, cotton can be somewhat forgiving in that
you can often stretch it back into shape.
 If you have to rip out stitches, the cotton fibers obligingly work themselves
back into position when moistened, and the needle holes magically 
disappear!
 It washes well and comes out looking fresh as a daisy.
 It can take a lot of love, which you know is important if you’ve ever
watched a child drag around his favorite blankie. Cotton’s durability
helps it stand the tests of time. In fact, nearly all antique quilts are made
of cotton, with the exception of a few wool quilts.
You can use fibers other than cotton to add special effects to quilts, but be
sure to use them only as accents. A little bit of gold tissue lamé in a holiday
quilt is a nice touch and adds sparkle. But if you choose a special-occasion
fabric for use in your quilt, be sure to check the care label on the end of the
bolt (you know, the cardboard thingy the fabric’s wrapped on in stores) to
make sure that you don’t include dry clean–only fabrics in a quilt meant to be
laundered at home. Otherwise, you run the risk of having your special fabric
shrink and buckle, ruining the entire project — now that would be a real
bummer!
Recognizing quality cotton
Although cotton is the choice for quilters, not all cottons are created equal.
Keep the old adage “You get what you pay for” in mind when buying cotton
fabrics.
The cotton fabrics you find in most fabric store quilting departments and
shops devoted to the art of quilting usually are just fine, but you may often
come across tables loaded with bolts of bargain fabrics, sometimes priced as
low as a few dollars per yard. Although you certainly can find bargains (and
when you do, you should definitely jump on them in a fabric-buying frenzy),
some so-called bargain fabrics aren’t all they’re cracked up to be.
32
Part I: Gathering Your Tools and Getting Ready 

Some fabrics, bargain or not, feel like good choices because of the sizing
applied during the manufacturing process. Manufacturers use sizing to stiffen
the fabric before wrapping it on the bolt. Its purposes are to make the fabric
easier to handle in the manufacturing process, make it look nice, and keep it
from slipping off the bolt. But after you wash some of these sized fabrics,
they become limp and flimsy and aren’t suitable for quilting. You may even
find that they resemble cheesecloth!
When in doubt about the quality of a particular fabric, always check the
thread count. Unfortunately, that’s easier said than done; thread count is
rarely, if ever, listed on the sticker at the end of the bolt, so you have to eye-
ball it. Remember, the more threads per inch, the better suited the fabric is
for quilting; 90 threads per inch is a good number, but higher is even better!
33
Chapter 3: The Pièce de Résistance: Fabric
Avoiding the two evil sisters, Poly and Ester
Fabric pack rats tend to purchase fabrics on
impulse, and these impulse purchases often come
from the bargain bin or remnant section, where
fiber contents are questionable. Everybody loves
a good deal, but even the best bargain is no good
if you’re getting shoddy material. No matter how
good the price, always avoid polyester and poly-
blend fabrics. They’re a poor choice for quilts
because they slip and slide as you stitch. Avoiding
polyester sounds easy enough, but determining a
fabric’s fiber content can be tricky at times. Here
are a few pointers for differentiating between a
polyester (bad!) and cotton (good!) fabric:
 Read all about it. If the fabric is still on its
original bolt (ask if you’re in doubt), consult
the fiber content information printed on the
end of the bolt.
 Get in touch with your feelings. Polyester is
slippery! Rub a double layer of fabric
between your fingers. Does it slide easily, or
does one layer grip the other? A fabric that’s
100 percent polyester has no grip, but a
poly-cotton blend sometimes has a slight
grip because of the cotton in it. Polyester
fabrics and poly-cotton blends also tend to
have higher luster (meaning the fabrics
reflect light or have a bit of a sheen to them)
than 100 percent cotton fabrics. Finally, fold
a piece of the fabric in question and finger-
press it by running your nail along the fold.
Does it hold a crease well? Cotton tends to
hold a nice sharp crease whereas polyester
and poly-blends have a weak crease.
 Burn it, baby! Okay, this isn’t an acceptable
tip to follow while shopping, but it’s a great
way to determine the fiber content of hand-
me-down fabric. The technique is very
simple: Cut off a small section of fabric, and
use tweezers to hold it over a piece of
waxed paper. Ignite the fabric with a match
or cigarette lighter, and see what happens.
Polyester fabric burns, melts, and shrinks
away from the flame. It also has a sweet
smell, gives off black smoke, and leaves
behind a hard bead on the waxed paper.
Cotton, on the other hand, may smell like
burning leaves or wood and leaves behind a
fine ash when it burns.
The best advice of all: If in doubt, don’t buy it.
Find something else.

(Counting threads is a daunting task, and I don’t really expect you to physically
count them — that’s where the eyeballing comes in.) If trying to estimate thread
count is just too overwhelming, compare the fabric to a more expensive piece
of fabric. Store personnel shouldn’t mind too much if you drag around a bolt
of good quality fabric to compare with their quilting fabrics — they may look
at you funny, but that’s about it.
Some manufacturers try to reduce the cost of their textiles by reducing the
thread count and adding heavy doses of sizing. Don’t buy anything that
resembles glorified (meaning colorfully printed and well-stiffened) cheese-
cloth. Trust me when I say that stuff so thin, with threads so far apart, that
you can strain cottage cheese through it! Also, avoid anything with polyester;
see the sidebar “Avoiding the two evil sisters, Poly and Ester” for details.
Staying in style and getting 
a good (color) value
When searching for cotton fabrics to use in a particular project, keep in mind
the look you want to achieve. Is the project a casual country quilt or a more
formal Victorian design? A simple pieced block can take on many different
moods depending on the style of fabric you choose. Soft pastels in tiny prints
can give a project a feminine feel, whereas deep browns, rusts, and blues may
give the quilt a country flavor.
For a high-end, decorator look, choose coordinates for your quilt. Coordinates
are a group of fabrics that complement each other, or coordinate. They can
be as diverse as a large-scale floral with a wide matching stripe or as similar
as a softly shaded, sweet little calico with matching solids and tiny little
prints. Most fabric stores display coordinate fabrics together (usually on 
end-of-the-aisle displays), making it easier to pick and choose the fabrics 
that best fit together . . . and best fit your style. You can also find bundled
selections of coordinating fat-quarters and fat-eighths in many stores. I must
admit, these bundles are my favorite weakness — I often purchase them on a
whim or to fill out my fabric stash.
To get started on matching your quilt style to your fabric selection, use 
Table 3-1 as a guide.

prominently, and medium-value fabrics hold the whole thing together. Without
this variety, your quilt doesn’t look like much from a distance — just a lump of
fabric with batting in between the layers!

Chapter 3: The Pièce de Résistance: Fabric

Some fabric stores carry a nifty little tool called a value finder, which is
simply a little rectangle (about 2 x 4 inches) of transparent red plastic that,
when held over printed fabrics, allows you to see the color value without the
clutter of the print getting in your way! It works by changing the color of the
fabric to gray-scale, allowing you see with ease which fabrics are light, dark,
or somewhere in between. The value finder’s small enough to fit in your
purse or pocket, so it’s easy to keep on hand.
In addition to value, scale, which is the size of a fabric’s print, is also very
important when choosing fabrics for a quilt. Figure 3-1 shows a few examples
of the different types of print scales. Just as with values, small-scale prints
recede in a design, and large-scale prints can be real eye-poppers!
Try to avoid using more than one or two large-scale prints in your quilt. They
tend to look too “busy” and are hard on your eyes when cutting, stitching,
and quilting, not to mention when you’re trying to enjoy your final product.

Part I: Gathering Your Tools and Getting Ready 
Storing your stash
Collecting fabrics is half the fun of quilting.
Sooner or later, though, you’ll need to organize
those haphazard piles you stuffed in the closet
and under the bed so you can find just the right
piece quickly and easily. Here are some helpful
hints for organizing your stash:
 Purchase clear plastic, shoe box–size stor-
age boxes. Label each box with its assigned
color or group of sub-colors, and arrange
your labeled boxes in a pretty armoire or
hutch with doors to hide the contents. Then
you can keep your fabric anywhere in your
home.
 Stacking, four-drawer units on rollers are
great for quilters who migrate from room to
room, looking for a place to work. Use one
unit for fabrics and another for threads,
notions, and tools. You can find these rolling
drawers in most office-supply stores and
anywhere you find items for home organi-
zation. In addition to being functional,
they’re reasonably priced!
 Store your fabrics under your bed in card-
board or clear plastic under-the-bed stor-
age bins.
 Buy an inexpensive shelf at a home center,
set it up in an unused corner of the house or
garage, and stack your fabric on it. Better yet,
set up a worktable and storage shelves or
containers and claim the garage for yourself!
 Take over the dresser in your guest room
(assuming you have both). Guests seem to
prefer living out of their suitcases anyway,
so why not organize your stash in the draw-
ers? Use shoeboxes or cardboard strips as
dividers to help keep the stacks tidy so you
can see what you have and grab what you
need without a lot of sorting.
 Take over the guest closet. (This almost
always follows taking over the guest dresser.)
 Take over the entire guest room. Send
guests to a hotel!

Measuring up
No matter the fiber content or design, quilting fabrics are available by the
yard in 44- and 45-inch widths. At quilting supply stores and more and more
fabric stores, you can also find them precut and sold in tidy little bundles
called fat quarters and fat eighths.
A fat quarter isn’t just a precut quarter of a yard (which, for a 44-inch wide
fabric, is 9 x 44 inches). Instead, the store cuts a half-yard length of fabric
from the bolt and then cuts the resulting 18- x 44-inch piece in half down the
center crease, giving you an 18- x 22-inch piece of fabric. This measurement
makes cutting larger quilt pieces from the fabric much easier, and you aren’t
limited to templates or patches that are only 9 inches or smaller.
If you only need a small amount of a particular color for your project, go with
fat quarters. They save you time because you don’t have to wait for store 
personnel to cut the fabric from the bolt for you, and you get more useable
fabric for your money because of the way the pieces are cut. Fat quarters are
also a great way to build your fabric stash because they’re often cut from fab-
rics that are being discontinued and are therefore greatly discounted, which
means you can stock up for less cash.
Fat eighths are simply half of a fat quarter and usually measure 18 x 11 inches.
If you need a very small amount of fabric and don’t think you’ll need to have
extra fabric on hand just in case, fat eighths are a fine choice.
When purchasing yard goods (another name for fabric sold on the bolt),
always ask that your fabrics be cut on the grain — especially if you’re buying
plaids. This type of cut eliminates wasted fabric when you’re cutting pieces
that require cutting on the true grain. (For more information on fabric grain, see
Chapter 5.) Also, insist that the clerk cut the fabric rather than rip it. Ripping
tends to pull the entire piece of yardage off skew and out of whack, which can
make it harder to line up the edges, especially when rotary-cutting.
Prewashing for project protection
Prewashing is an important step in quilting preparation. Although prewash-
ing isn’t rocket science, the task may require some willpower! There have
been many times when I’ve brought a fabulous piece of yardage home, want-
ing to dive right in and start cutting it into pieces. But after years of quilting
experience, I learned to control the urge to start cutting and take care of the
prewashing first, knowing it’s better for my finished project.
37
Chapter 3: The Pièce de Résistance: Fabric

Prewashing 101
To prewash fabric, simply machine-wash it on a regular, everyday washing
setting with mild detergent. Tumble dry until the fabric is only slightly damp,
and then press it using a dry iron (no steam) on the “cotton” setting. Fold the
fabric neatly until you’re ready to use it.
I recommend washing your fabrics as soon as you bring them home so that
when you pull them out to work on a project two days, two months, or even
two years later, you don’t have to stare at the hunk of fabric, wondering if it’s
been washed yet. Washing fabric as soon as you get it home eliminates any
doubt!
Quilters often inherit fabrics from other fabri-holics or win them at quilting raf-
fles; whether these fabrics have been prewashed is a mystery. When in doubt,
wash it. Large cuts can go directly into the washing machine, but smaller
pieces tend to be “eaten” by the machine. So to wash small cuts of fabric, fill 
a sink or basin with room-temperature water and a bit of mild soap. Slip the
fabric into the water, swish it around for a few seconds, and then rinse it well.
Lay the fabric flat on a terry towel and let it air dry; then press it with a dry
iron when it’s just slightly damp.
Benefits of prewashing
Prewashing all the fabric you plan to use in a project has a number of impor-
tant benefits. First of all, it gets the fabric’s natural shrinkage out of the way
so it doesn’t seriously warp your design later on. Keep in mind that a 12-inch
square of 100 percent cotton fabric can shrink, sometimes as much as 1⁄4-inch
both horizontally and vertically. Different fabrics may shrink at different
rates: One fabric may not shrink at all, but another may shrink considerably.
To be safe, you should always prewash everything, no matter how much or
how little you expect it to shrink. Shrinkage after you launder your finished
project can have disastrous effects. Imagine that after all your effort in
making a quilt, you wash it and find that the pretty blue print in the center 
of the block has shrunk, puckering each and every block in such a way that
the pattern’s unrecognizable — it can happen!
Prewashing removes the sizing from fabric, which makes it easier to handle
or machine quilt because the sizing doesn’t get gummy or sticky from the
moisture in your hands (remember playing with starch in grade school?).
Prewashing also removes excess dye that can bleed onto other fabrics and
spoil the color — not a good thing, unless, of course, you want that pretty 
red print to bleed and turn the entire quilt pink. Hey, some folks do strange
things. If you notice that a particular fabric crocks (bleeds) when washed,
continue washing and rinsing the fabric until it no longer loses dye. If the
fabric continues to crock, discard it and replace it with something more 
colorfast. Imagine putting hours of work into a red and white quilt only to 
discover that the whole thing turns pink after washing because the red
fabric bled into the white!

Part I: Gathering Your Tools and Getting Ready 

Hitting a Homer with Your Batting
The batting, or filler, for your quilt is just as important to the look of the 
finished quilt as the fabric. You need to decide if you want a flatter, old-
fashioned-looking quilt, a soft and comfy but low profile quilt, or a thick,
lofty, jump-right-in-and-snuggle type of quilt. Each look requires a different
type of batt (that’s quilter lingo for batting).
Battings are available in several different fibers, the most common being
polyester, cotton/polyester blend, cotton, and wool (yes, poly and ester may
be banned from your fabric choices, but they’re safe for batting). With so
many choices, answering a few simple questions about your project can
narrow the field and help you pick the right batting for your needs:
 Are you planning to hand quilt, machine quilt, or tie the quilt?
 How much effort do you want to put into the quilting stage?
 Do you plan to heavily quilt the project or just stitch enough to hold the
quilt layers together?
 How do you intend to use the quilt when it’s finished?
 Will the quilt be laundered often?
 What size is the quilt?
 Is the predominant color of the quilt dark or light?
When choosing your batting, always read the manufacturer’s recommenda-
tions printed on the wrapper or the batting bolt label. This information not
only lists suggestions for using the product, but it also provides laundering
instructions and any special handling tips, such as prewashing the batting
before working with it.
The following sections help you sort through all the batting options and use
your answers to the questions above to find the best batting for your quilted
pieces.
Prepackaged or by the yard?
Batting comes prepackaged and by-the-yard. Price-wise, there’s not much dif-
ference between the two, so your choice depends on your needs.
Prepackaged batting is convenient because it’s already cut to standard bed
sizes (see Table 3-2 for measurements), shrink-wrapped, and easy to take
home. But if your project is smaller than a bed size, buying prepackaged bat-
ting means you bring home more batting than you actually need. Too much
batting isn’t bad, of course — you just have to stash it away somewhere until
you’re ready to use it for the next small project.
39
Chapter 3: The Pièce de Résistance: Fabric

Shrink-wrapping may make prepackaged batting easy to get home, but the
batting gets bulky and more difficult to store after you remove it from the
package. To tame this wild beast of fluff, carefully remove the batting from
the package and unroll only the amount necessary for your project. Cut off
what you need, and then quickly reroll the batting and put it back in its bag
before it has a chance to expand.
Table 3-2

Batting by the yard is the same stuff as prepackaged batting, but you have 
the option of purchasing only as much as you need. It’s available in both
polyester and cotton and in varying widths and lofts. The downside to 
buying lofty batting by the yard, however, is that it hasn’t been shrink-
wrapped, so it may be bulky to bring home and store.
With any batting choice, after you cut the size you need, unfold the batting 
a few days before using it to let it breathe! Doing so allows the batting to
expand and relax after spending months or even years in its tightly pack-
aged form.
Choosing your batting’s fiber content
Compared to just 20 years ago, quilters have a wide variety of batting options
at their fingertips. Batting comes in different materials, sizes, weights — even
colors! This section helps you figure out what batting is best for your quilting
project.
100 percent cotton
Quilting through 100 percent cotton is like quilting through warm butter —
smooth and easy. Because some cotton batting can shrink nearly 5 percent
when washed, the “crinkled” effect achieved after this shrinkage can give
your quilt a wonderful antique look. If you don’t want a shrunken batt, read
the label carefully to see if the manufacturer recommends preshrinking. You
can purchase cotton batting that won’t shrink in varying weights and lofts.
40
Part I: Gathering Your Tools and Getting Ready 

The major downside to many inexpensive cotton battings is that, if you don’t
use closely spaced stitching intervals when quilting, the batting bunches to
all the corners, nooks, and crannies during use and laundering. Trust me on
this one — you’ll have lots of batting in your corners but nothing where you
need it most! A minor downside is that some cotton battings require pre-
washing (a step I prefer to eliminate).
Some experienced quilters — the ones who don’t mind spending an entire
year working on one quilt — often prefer cotton batting over any other.
Perhaps it’s because they like the old-fashioned look or want to stay true 
to traditions (polyester batting is a new-fangled invention).
Cotton/polyester blend
Many blended battings give your quilt a very traditional look and feel without
the hassle of cotton. Like cotton batting, cotton/polyester blends can shrink,
but not as much as 100 percent cotton — you may not even notice the shrink-
age. In fact, some cotton/poly blends don’t shrink at all. A nice thing about
cotton/polyester batting is that you can quilt it at slightly larger stitching
intervals than 100 percent cotton batting because the polyester content
helps keep the fibers from migrating during use or laundering.
If you decide to use cotton/polyester blend batting, refer to the package for
additional information on usage.
Polyester
Polyester battings launder well with no shrinkage and can be quilted at large
stitching intervals, which means you finish the quilt quicker, freeing up more
time for additional quilting projects! For this reason, polyester batting is the
most popular choice among quilters.
Polyester is the only fiber available for high-loft battings — what you’d choose
for a really thick (think sleeping-bag-thick) quilt. Because hand or machine
quilting a high-loft batting is difficult at best, use high-loft battings for tied
quilts (the ones held together with fancy knots of yarn or ribbon).
Polyester battings also now come in a fusible variety: Both sides of the bat-
ting are coated with the same type of heat-released glue used in the fusible
webbing you use for machine appliqué (see Chapter 10). Fusible batting is
great for small projects because fusing the quilt top and bottom to the bat-
ting using a hot iron (follow the manufacturer’s directions) eliminates the
need to baste before quilting. I don’t recommend it for larger projects,
though, because getting everything fully fused can be tough unless you’re
able to lay the project flat on a very large ironing board. Also, when working
on larger projects, say larger than 30 x 30 inches, it’s much too easy to cause
distortion when moving the item around on your ironing board.
41
Chapter 3: The Pièce de Résistance: Fabric

You’re probably wondering why polyester is fine for batting but not for
fabric. First of all, cotton fabric is traditionally used in quilt tops and backing
because it feels nice against the skin — unlike polyester. Because polyester
batting is completely enclosed by cotton fabrics, you don’t feel the polyester
at all, so the touchability factor isn’t an issue. Also, polyester batting holds
its shape well, especially after repeated washings.
Silk
This batting is best suited for quilted garments. Textile artists who specialize
in unique, one-of-a-kind garments like to work with silk batting because it
drapes well and is lightweight.
I don’t recommend silk batting for bed quilts or wall hangings. Why not? First,
silk batting is very expensive. Second, it’s often difficult to find. Third, it usu-
ally isn’t made in sizes large enough to accommodate a bed-size project, and
even if it were, the cost would be quite prohibitive!
Wool
The great thing about wool batting is that it’s very heavy, so it’s great if
you’re making a quilt that’s meant to insulate on cold winter nights.
Wool batting is very easy to needle through (that is, your needle meets little
resistance as you stitch), but its fibers tend to migrate, so it requires closely
spaced quilting (short stitching intervals), just as cotton does. Wool batting
also tends to beard, or lose fibers, through the quilt top more than some
other battings. To help prevent this problem, many experienced quilters 
who prefer this type of batting encase their wool batts in extra layers of 
lightweight fabric.
Wool batting washed in warm water and tumbled dry can shrink substantially,
so hand washing and drying flat or professional dry cleaning are usually the
recommended forms of laundering. Because of these care restrictions, wool
batting probably isn’t the best choice for a young child’s bed quilt, a set of
place mats, or other projects that will be subject to frequent laundering.
42
Part I: Gathering Your Tools and Getting Ready 
Colored batting?
Batting is available in a wide range of colors —
as long as it’s white or black you want (my
apologies to Mr. Ford and his Model-T).
Actually, the colors are white or off-white
depending on fiber content and deep gray. 
As you may have already figured out, the light-
colored batts go in light-colored quilts, and the
dark gray batts are perfect for dark-colored
quilts. Why does it matter, you ask? Because if
a fiber or two from the batting migrates to the
surface of the quilt (which inevitably happens),
you don’t notice it very much if the batting works
with the colors in the quilt. Pretty simple stuff,
really.

Batting 1000
Use Table 3-3 to help you determine which brand of batting is best for your
needs, depending on the look that you’re trying to achieve. If you can’t find
the exact brand I list here in your local fabric or quilting supply store, ask
store personnel to recommend an available batt that has similar qualities.

Backing Up Your Quilt 
with the Proper Fabric
At one time, backing a bed-size quilt required piecing fabrics together to
make a backing piece large enough to accommodate the massive width and
length. Today, manufacturers make it easy to back these monstrosities:
Backing fabrics are available by the yard in 90- and 120-inch widths in a vari-
ety of colors and prints as well as in traditional solid white and natural. In my
opinion, these large backing fabrics are the best choice for large-size quilts
because they save so much time.
Cotton bed sheets also make excellent backings and are available in an array
of prints, colors, and sizes. Golly, you can even give your bed a completely
coordinated look by adding matching pillowcases and a bedskirt! If you use a
flat bed sheet, remember to undo the decorative hem at the top of the sheet
so you don’t get any strange seam lines or fabric layers.
Before you venture out to purchase backing fabric, determine the width and
length of the piece you needed. It never hurts to purchase a little extra fabric,
especially considering the fact that it’s very difficult to cut these large-width
fabrics perfectly straight at the store, so you may end up with a backing that
isn’t perfectly square. So allow an extra few inches along each side as a fudge
factor. For example, if the finished size of your quilt is 75 x 90 inches (to fit a
full-size bed), you need a backing piece that’s at least 80 x 95 inches. In this
45
Chapter 3: The Pièce de Résistance: Fabric

case, you can purchase either 3 yards of 90-inch–wide fabric (which gives
you a surface area of 90 x 108 inches) or a 21⁄3 yards of 120-inch–wide fabric
(which gives you a surface area of 120 x 84 inches).
If you really like one of the fabrics in your quilt top and want to use it as the
backing, piecing isn’t as terrible as it sounds. Figuring out how much 44- or
45-inch–wide fabric you need just requires a bit of planning on your part. For
example, if the finished size of your quilt is 75 x 90 inches (to fit a full-size
bed), you need to purchase two cuts of fabric that are each 23⁄4 yard.
Why purchase two lengths of fabric instead of one 51⁄2-yard length? The
answer is simple: to eliminate your margin of error. How upset would you be
to get your fabric home, prewash it, press it, cut it, and then discover that
you mismeasured and you’re 8 inches short on one length? If you purchase
your fabric in two lengths, the measuring is done for you. Plus, the folks
doing the cutting at the store always allow an extra 1⁄2 inch or so when cutting,
which helps you out in the long run.
To piece 44- or 45-inch wide backing fabric for your 75- x 90-inch finished
quilt, you have a number of options:
 Cut one of the lengths of fabric directly down the center, making two 22-
inch–wide strips. Stitch one strip to each long side of the uncut length of
fabric (see Figure 3-2a), and press the seams open. This design puts the
seam lines toward the outsides of the quilt, which can make it easier to
center your quilt top and batting because no one will notice if you end
up slightly off-center!
 Stitch the two lengths of fabric together along one long edge (see 
Figure 3-2b), and press the seam allowance open. With the seam run-
ning vertically, layer this backing panel with the batting and quilt top.
This design puts a seam down the center of the quilt and means that
you need to be fairly accurate when centering your batting and quilt
top on the backing.
 Stitch the two lengths of fabric together along one long edge, and press
the seam allowance open. Rotate the pieced result so that the seam runs
horizontally across your quilt (see Figure 3-2c), and layer this backing
panel with the batting and quilt top.
 Cut three lengths of fabric that are 40 inches wide, and stitch them
together horizontally (see Figure 3-2d). When using this method to
create your backing, make sure that you carefully center the fabric
under your quilt and batting so that the seams are as unnoticeable as
possible.
The piecing method you choose depends on the actual size of backing
needed. You can use any method, but keep in mind that the more seams you
have, the more difficult it is to quilt through the layers due to the extra thick-
ness in the backing’s seam areas.
46
Part I: Gathering Your Tools and Getting Ready 

Before you go piecing yardage together for your backing piece, cut off the sel-
vages! The selvage edge is the manufactured edge along the length of the
fabric. Never use a selvage edge, even if you think it will be absorbed into a
seam allowance; it’s tightly woven and doesn’t shrink, which could mean big
trouble for your final fabric piece.

P
atchwork quilting is nothing more than taking individual pieces of fabric,
called patches, that have been cut out in basic, geometric shapes and
stitching them together to form what appear to be more complex patterns.
The technique is a bit like putting a simple children’s puzzle together, with
each piece fitting into a designated spot. In the case of patchwork, the puzzle
pieces are made of fabric. Sounds simple enough, right?
Only a few shapes are necessary for basic traditional patchwork designs:
squares, triangles, rectangles, hexagons, and long strips. (Of course, curved
shapes such as the fan or Double Wedding Ring are also possible, but they
require a bit of extra handling.) The breadth of creativity available with
patchwork ranges from elegant simplicity to incredibly intricate, Picasso–
like fabric art. This creative aspect, combined with the practicality and 
eco-friendliness of recycling scraps of fabric into useful treasures, has 
made patchwork the most popular form of quilting.
In this chapter, I show you how blocks are built, share tips for designing 
your own unique quilt blocks, and discuss the latest craze in accurate quilt
block-making — foundation piecing.

Would a Quilt Block By Any 
Other Name Feel as Cozy?
As you read through this or any other quilting book, you’ll probably notice
that all quilt blocks have names. Some names describe the block’s motif —
Maple Leaf, Turkey Tracks, Flower Basket, Flying Geese, and Log Cabin
(see Figure 4-1) — but others seem to have no clear root in the design —
Robbing Peter to Pay Paul, Johnny-Round-the-Corner, Corn and Beans, and
Broken Dishes.
How did the creators of these blocks come up with such strange names? The
answer lies both in the popular culture of the day and what was going on in
the quilters’ lives at the time.
Some blocks were named to honor prominent individuals or events — consider
Lincoln’s Platform and Road to California, which commemorates the great gold
rush of the late 1800s. Others express the quilter’s religious devotion, as in
Jacob’s Ladder, Dove in the Window, Tree of Life, and Cross and Crown.
A number of block names, such as Robbing Peter to Pay Paul (see Figure 4-2)
and Drunkard’s Path, may express the frustrations of the eras in which they
were created. Kansas Troubles expresses the emotions experienced by farm-
ers during the dust bowl years.
Still others blocks were named purely for fun. Consider Puss in the Corner,
Wild Goose Chase, and Jack in the Box. Perhaps Old Maid’s Ramble, which
you can see in Figure 4-2, was named simply because Auntie couldn’t stop
gossiping during a quilting bee.

Chapter 4: A Patch in the Fabric of Time: Designing Quilt Blocks
From one anonymous quilter to another
The following pseudo-letter is a perfect exam-
ple of how seamlessly quilt names reflect the
real life they’re so much a part of. I’ve under-
lined the quilt block names so you don’t miss
them — some aren’t hard to spot, but others
may surprise you!
Dear Sunbonnet Sue,
It’s been a rough week down on the farm. I
found a hole in the barn door — the one on the
same side of the barn as the weathervane.
Anyway, the hens and chicks escaped through
that darn hole and ate up all the corn and beans
I had planted in grandmother’s flower garden.
After I saw what they did to my rose of Sharon,
I rounded the critters up and locked them in the
old log cabin, where I found a cowering puss in
the corner. Since Puss looked guilty too, I
locked him in there with the others.
I was going to head up the road to Kansas that
afternoon but postponed my trip. Handy Andy
came over for a visit instead. You know, he was
actually my grandmother’s choice for a husband
for me because he looked better in a bow tie
than Overall Bill. With all the Kansas troubles
right now, Andy still can’t afford a wedding ring,
so he gave me a cut glass dish and a Dresden
plate instead. How’s that for a strange engage-
ment gift! Too bad I dropped them — I ended up
with just a bunch of broken dishes! And I almost
broke Grandma’s cake stand with my elbow as I
swept up the bits and pieces!
Don’t give me any lip about this; I remember
when you started dating that Clay fellow. Clay’s
choice of an engagement gift was a cherry
basket. Well, at least it wasn’t breakable. You
know, I never really did like him, ’cause he was
always playin’ with his whirlygigs or fiddlin’ with
the churn dash.
Well, I guess I have to go now — you know how
us old maids ramble!
Love,
Edith

I could go on and on about all the strange, silly, and meaningful patchwork
block names out there (perhaps someone should name a block Cheryl’s
Rambling Again . . .). However, my point is this: In many ways, block design
names are similar to the names of constellations — they don’t always look
exactly like the names they’re given. Sometimes you have to use your imagi-
nation to see the resemblance, if there is one. Regardless, these traditional
quilt blocks continue to be the foundations quilters use today for their most
beautiful and creative efforts.
Choosing Your Quilt Block System: 
Four-patch or Nine-patch
You may hear seasoned quilters talking about their latest projects, often refer-
ring to the blocks as four-patch, nine-patch, or some other number of patch.
Although it sounds like Latin or Greek to the untrained ear, the grid-based
system by which quilt blocks are designed is very easy to decipher — and it
actually makes sense.
The system is based on a simple grid filled with the various geometric shapes
used in quilting. The two most common patch systems used in block design
are the four-patch and the nine-patch, but others are often used for more
complex designs. In this section, I stick to the two most basic treatments.
Basic four-patch design
When a quilter refers to a four-patch block, she (or he — many men have
taken up quilting as well) is talking about a block that’s based on a grid of
four squares, as shown in Figure 4-3.
Describing a block as a four-patch doesn’t necessarily mean it’s made of only
four pieces of fabric. Rather, four-patch describes the way the block is laid

out, which is basically in four units. Each unit may be made of one or more
pieces stitched together.
A four-patch block can be relatively simple in nature, like the block shown 
in Figure 4-3. This block is composed of four blocks, each consisting of five
pieces. When you stitch together the four units, you have a completed four-
patch block.
Basic nine-patch design
A nine-patch block is similar to a four-patch block, but its design is based 
on a grid of nine squares rather than four. Each of the nine squares can be
broken down into additional units, but the block remains a nine-patch block.
Figure 4-4 shows the basic nine-patch grid as well as a Pinwheel block created
in a nine-patch design.
For any patch design, the grid doesn’t have to consist of equal-sized squares.
For example, the Churn Dash (also known as the Hole in the Barn Door)
block shown in Figure 4-5 is based on a nine-patch grid, but the center area
is stretched to give it a different look. Although the nine units vary in size,
the block stays true to its nine-patch origins.

Chapter 4: A Patch in the Fabric of Time: Designing Quilt Blocks

Mapping Out Your Designs
As I mention at the beginning of this chapter, only a few shapes are necessary
for basic traditional patchwork designs. Now you have the chance to play
with those basic shapes — squares, triangles, rectangles, diamonds, and long
strips — and create a new block of your own.
Starting out small
The majority of my quilt block designs have started off as random doodles on
graph paper that I fill in with colored pencils. Letting my design mind wander
is one of my favorite ways to design quilts because it’s easy and can be done
anywhere — just keep a graph paper pad close at hand and you’ll see what
I mean.
To sketch your own patchwork designs:
1. On a sheet of graph paper, mark the four-patch and nine-patch grids
that appear in Figures 4-3 and 4-4.
I recommend paper with four, eight, or ten squares per inch, but any size
graph works just as well; the only real difference is that more squares
per inch mean that your doodles are smaller.
2. Fill the grids with various shapes and discover how many quilt block
designs and possibilities are at your fingertips!
Play with as many variations of shapes as you please, and reverse the direc-
tion of the pieces for even more options. To draw the eye to certain designs
within your larger layout, color in the pieces with colored pencils or felt-tip
markers, or sketch in some textures to differentiate between the various fab-
rics you’d like to use. When you create a design you’re especially fond of,
name it — after all, it’s your own creation.
Turning doodles into full-sized 
block patterns
After you design your quilt block in miniature on graph paper — assuming
you don’t go blind squinting at all those tiny squares and give up on quilting
forever — you’re ready to create a full-sized pattern of your block design to
use when making templates. (See Chapter 5 for tips on creating templates
and cutting out patches.)
56
Part II: Planning Your Masterpiece 

The block’s size depends on the number of blocks you need for your project,
given the size of your finished project (see Chapter 6 for help choosing a
layout and determining how large the finished project should be). Figuring
out the size of your full-sized block is just a matter of some very simple math.
For example:
 If you’re making a single-block throw pillow, a 14- to 16-inch block is
your best bet. A 12-inch block would likely require the addition of some
borders (unless you want a very small pillow), and an 18-inch block
might be great on the floor but could overwhelm your sofa or chair.
 If you’re planning a wall hanging or bed quilt, use a 10-, 12-, or 14-inch
block. Anything larger would just look too strange on something as large
as a bed (although it has been done!). It’s really all a matter of personal
preference.
• If you’re using the four-patch system and your project calls for a 
4-inch block, each of the patches in the block should be 2 inches
square. Similarly, a 6-inch block requires patches that are each
3 inches square, and a 12-inch block uses 6-inch patches. See the
pattern here? With a four-patch system, just divide your final block
size in half to determine your individual patch size.
• If you’re using the nine-patch system and your project requires a 
6-inch block, each of your patches should measure 2 inches square.
Similarly, a 9-inch block requires patches that are 3 inches square,
and a 12-inch block requires 4-inch patches. With a nine-patch
system, just divide your final block size by three to determine
your individual patch size.

Chapter 5
Creating and Using Templates
In This Chapter
 Choosing template materials
 Prepping patterns for template creation
 Transferring template shapes to fabric
T
emplates are the backbone of a pieced block: They’re the cutting patterns
that are absolutely necessary in the quilt-making process. Creating accurate
templates is one of the most important steps in making a quilt. Good templates
mean the difference between a well-squared block that goes together easily and
a catawampus, crooked-all-to-heck one that fights you every step of the way.
Although ready-made templates are available for a variety of popular quilt
block designs, making your own templates is usually cheaper, and it can even
be fun. Plus, if you come up with a spectacular, intricate design that no one
else has ever thought of (you clever devil!), creating your own templates is a
must — otherwise your design will never be more than a pretty little sketch
on paper. And if that’s all you wanted, you would have bought a coloring
book instead of this book, right?
In this chapter, I give you tips for everything from choosing template materi-
als to making the special templates needed if you plan to piece your quilt by
hand. Scared that you’ll goof up this template stuff? If you ever traced around
your hand to make a turkey in grade school, relax, little pilgrim — you’re an
old pro at using templates.
Paper or Plastic?
Shopping for quilting supplies can be just as overwhelming as shopping 
for groceries. You encounter bolt after bolt of fabric (Should you choose 
the vanilla, the chocolate, or the strawberry, or should you settle for the
Neapolitan, which will make everyone happy?), spool after spool of thread
(Who knew there were 73 different brands of spaghetti?), and package after
package of fluffy batting (Who has time to do a squeeze test on all those 
toilet paper brands?).

At the grocery store, the easiest choice you make is probably deciding what
kind of bags you want your groceries packed in. Luckily, when it comes to
choosing template material for quilts, you have that same simple choice:
paper or plastic.
Scrounging up some paper
Creating paper templates from a pattern you design (or from patterns you find
in this book or purchase at quilting stores) is simple and cheap. You simply
trace the individual pattern pieces onto tracing paper; add seam allowances
if the pattern doesn’t already include them (the ones in this book do); use
whatever kind of adhesive you have handy to attach the traced pattern to
cardboard, old file folders, heavy card-stock paper, or even empty cereal
boxes; and then cut out the templates. (The section “Making Templates”
later in this chapter takes you through this process one step at a time.)
Springing for plastic sheeting
So you can’t make paper templates because the kids taped together all the
cardboard in the house to make a 10-foot-tall robot named Zorbot. And you
don’t want to eat four boxes of Serious Sugar Surge cereal just so you can
start your quilting project (see the preceding section). Don’t despair! Many
quilting supply stores carry transparent, flexible plastic sheeting that’s espe-
cially designed for creating quilting templates.
With this material, you trace individual pattern pieces directly onto the plas-
tic, add seam allowances if the pattern doesn’t already include them, and cut
out the templates (see the section “Making Templates” later in this chapter
for detailed instructions). Plastic sheeting saves you a few steps because
there’s no gluing involved. Just keep in mind that this material can be a bit
expensive, and you won’t find a secret decoder ring at the bottom of the
package either. Bummer.
If you’re making a large quilt and plan to trace around your templates over
and over again as you create your blocks, I suggest that you use the plastic
template material or make more than one set of cardboard templates.
With repeated tracings, cardboard template edges eventually wear down,
making the templates inaccurate, so it’s good to have fresh ones ready to
swap out with the old. If you’ve decided on cardboard and want to protect
your templates and preserve them for posterity, purchase some self-sticking
laminating sheets and apply them to both sides of the templates before cut-
ting them out.
60
Part II: Planning Your Masterpiece 

Going with the Grain
All woven fabrics have two grains:
 A straight grain that runs parallel to the selvage edge of the fabric (the
uncut edge that appears tightly woven and often contains the name of
the fabric manufacturer). The straight grain doesn’t stretch at all.
 A cross grain that, as the term implies, runs across the straight grain of
the fabric at a 90-degree angle. The cross grain has some stretch to it.
To make your life easier, I refer to both the straight grain and cross grains of
the fabric as on-grain. And when I use the term bias, I simply mean on the
diagonal of the two grains.
Always cut off the selvage edge before cutting out your pieces of fabric.
Because of the tight weave, this area is difficult to stitch through by hand 
or machine (and it doesn’t shrink along with the rest of the fabric).
Before you make any templates or cut into any of your fabrics, you need to
mark grain line arrows on your pattern to help you place your template along
the proper grain line of the fabric you’re cutting (see Figure 5-1). These grain
lines help you build your blocks in such a way that they don’t stretch out of
shape while they’re being stitched.
Place any templates for the outside edge of a particular block pattern on-
grain rather than on the bias. (In the case of triangles, proper placement is
essential.) Because bias edges stretch, placing them along a block edge can
cause distortion in the finished block. You should also try to avoid having
two bias edges together whenever possible so that you don’t have two edges
of stretch stretching together!
61
Chapter 5: Creating and Using Templates
Patterns versus templates
If you’re wondering what the difference is
between a pattern and a template, here’s a little
secret: There’s not a heck of a lot of difference
except that a template is cut from stiff material
and a pattern is printed on paper. Both are usable,
but a template can make your work easier by
giving you a somewhat consistent surface to
trace around, rather than pinning flimsy paper to
your fabrics. If you plan on making multiple blocks
from your patterns or templates, keep in mind that
flimsy paper will disintegrate faster than warm
cookies in a room full of children.

Keep in mind that there are times when, no matter what you do, you end up
with two bias edges together or a piece of bias along an outside edge. There’s
no need to panic; just be sure you don’t accidentally stretch the fabric when
cutting or sewing. To be safe, you also may want to stitch those pieces first
so they have the support of each other and the line of thread to help stabilize
the bias edge.
Figure 5-2a shows how not to mark the grain lines on your patterns and tem-
plates. Notice that the shaded piece was cut with a bias edge on the outside
of the quilt block. This block is a good candidate for some major distortion,
whereas the pieces in the block shown in Figure 5-2b are perfectly aligned.

62
Part II: Planning Your Masterpiece 

Always use care when handling bias fabric pieces. The more they’re handled,
the more they stretch and distort!
Making Templates
Making templates is easy, but they need to be precise. The instructions in
this section will go a long way in ensuring accuracy in your patterns.
I prefer to make my templates from plastic sheeting rather than cardboard
because the plastic is sturdier and because cardboard tends to wear down
around the edges after you trace multiple pattern pieces.
Making templates from 
patterns you’ve created
Follow these steps for making templates from patterns that you create (refer
to Chapter 4 for information about designing your own quilt block patterns):
1. Make several copies of your pattern before you cut or otherwise per-
manently alter the pattern.
Copies ensure that you always have a spare on hand in case your kids
decide to make paper airplanes out of your tax forms and quilt block
patterns. Hey, it could happen.
If you’re using a photocopier to copy the patterns, be sure to measure
the copies for accuracy. Some machines tend to stretch images in one
direction, throwing off the accuracy of your templates.
2. Letter or number each pattern piece, as shown in Figure 5-3, so you
know where it belongs in the quilt block after you cut apart the 
pattern.
I like to mark the starting point of the block, in this case the center
squares turned on point, as A or 1. Then I work outwards from the
center, lettering or numbering the pieces accordingly.
3. Carefully cut out the pattern pieces.
Do not use your fabric-cutting scissors to cut templates; use another
pair you have around. Fabric scissors were never meant to slice, dice,
cut through tin cans, and still slice a tomato paper-thin (I’ve been watch-
ing too much television). You’re guaranteed to dull them if you try to cut
through heavy paper or plastic templates.
63
Chapter 5: Creating and Using Templates

Cut only around the outside (cutting) edge of the pattern. Discard any
pieces that are duplicated in the quilt block pattern because you only
need to make one template for each basic piece. For the block template
shown in Figure 5-3, for example, you need one each of pattern pieces 
A, B, C, and D.
4. Using a pen or pencil, trace the pattern pieces onto tracing paper 
or plastic sheeting, spacing the pieces at least 1 inch apart in all 
directions.
5. Using a ruler, carefully draw a second line exactly 1⁄4 inch outside the
outline of each pattern piece, as shown in Figure 5-4.
Make sure that the spacing between the lines is accurate and that all
angles are sharp.

Part II: Planning Your Masterpiece 

This new line is the cutting line, the line along which you cut out the tem-
plate and then later cut out the fabric patches. (The first line you drew is
your stitching line.) The space between the two lines (1⁄4 inch) provides
the correct seam allowance for constructing your quilt block.
For rounded templates, use a flexible curve to trace curves with ease
and accuracy. You can find them at most office supply or engineering
supply stores.
6. Mark a small dot on each template wherever two seams will converge
when you start stitching your pieces together, as shown in Figure 5-5.
When piecing really intricate patterns, these dots act as guides for your
stitching. And by matching up the dots on the fabric pieces, you ensure
that the pieces are correctly aligned.
7. If you traced your pattern pieces onto tracing paper instead of plastic
sheeting, glue the tracing paper pieces to lightweight cardboard or
other heavy paper.
This step adds durability and makes your templates easier to handle.
8. Cut out the templates along their outer (cutting) lines, using old or
general-use scissors, not your fabric-only scissors!
Making templates from 
ready-made patterns
To make templates from ready-made patterns, including those in this book,
follow these two easy steps:
Figure 5-5:

block,

65
Chapter 5: Creating and Using Templates

1. Trace the patterns onto tracing paper or plastic sheeting.
2. Cut them out, as you would your own pattern designs (see the preced-
ing section).
On ready-made quilting patterns, cutting lines are always indicated by
solid lines, and stitching lines are always indicated by dotted lines.
Make sure that you cut out template pieces along the cutting lines and not the
stitching lines, or that king-sized bed quilt will end up looking like a place mat.
(In which case you have to decide whether you still want to make the match-
ing bed skirt and pillow shams!)
Making window templates 
for hand piecing
If you plan to hand piece your blocks (see Chapter 9 for more about hand
piecing), you may want to make window templates so that you can easily
mark the stitching lines on your fabric pieces. Most of the time when you’re
tracing a template, you’re only tracing the outside cutting line. The great
thing about a window template is that you’re able to trace two lines on the
wrong sides of your fabric: the outside cutting line and the inside stitching
line. You then have a visual aid for perfect hand piecing — simply make your
stitches follow the marked inside line!
A bonus to using window templates is that you’re able to center a design ele-
ment from the fabric in your piece. Perhaps you want to highlight a bouquet
of flowers or a special emblem? Use the window to get the exact image you
want. This technique is called fussy cutting because you carefully select the
area you want to highlight in your finished quilt block.
Here’s how you create a window template in two easy steps:
1. Make a template from plastic or cardboard by following the steps 
outlined in “Making templates from patterns you’ve created” and
“Making templates from ready-made patterns,” depending on whether
you’re creating your own design or using one from this (or another)
quilting book.
I know, I know; that adds up to more than two steps already, and you’re
still in the first step. Making that basic template is simple enough,
though, right?
2. Cut out the template’s center along the stitching line (the inside line
you drew when you traced the pattern’s shape onto the plastic).
66
Part II: Planning Your Masterpiece 

Discard the center piece, or save it for another project if you think it’s
big enough to make another template out of someday. If you’re using
plastic sheeting for your template, you definitely want to consider
saving your scraps for future use —saving a penny here and there is
always good.
With your completed window template, you can mark both the cutting lines
and the stitching lines on your fabric pieces. Don’t believe me? Read on for
details.
Putting Pencil to Fabric
After you make your templates, you’re ready to transfer their shapes to your
prewashed and freshly pressed fabric. (See Chapter 3 for the scoop on fabric
and fabric preparation.)
Trying to trace templates onto a wrinkled piece of fabric is just setting you
up for disaster. Wrinkles can scrunch and hide underneath the template,
making your cut fabric pieces inaccurate. Remember, neatness counts!
Lay your template on the wrong side of the fabric (that’s the back side of the
fabric’s design), paying special attention to match up the fabric’s grain lines
with the direction of the template’s grain arrow (see “Going with the Grain” for
grain arrow instructions). Trace around the template, using a well-sharpened
water-soluble pencil. Sharpen the pencil often to keep your lines accurate. If
you’re using a window template, be sure to trace the inside (stitching) line, too.
To prevent templates from slipping on the fabric as you trace around them,
try gluing small pieces of sandpaper to their backs (or purchase some 
adhesive-backed sandpaper and skip the gluing step). You can also make 
no-skid templates by applying a thin layer of rubber cement to their backs.
(Just make sure that the rubber cement is dry before you use the templates,
or you’ll end up with a globby mess all over your fabric.) Rub off the rubber
cement and apply a new layer as it becomes coated with fabric lint and loses
its grip.

Playing with Blocks and Borders:
Which Way Should They Go?
In This Chapter
 Playing around with block arrangements
 Planning your quilt’s borders
A
fter you select a block design (Chapter 4) and create the templates you
need (Chapter 5), you’re almost ready to start cutting and stitching. I say
almost because first you need to determine
 How many blocks you need and how to arrange them
 The type of borders to cut
The number of blocks you need to stitch depends primarily on the size of the
quilt you intend to make and the manner in which you plan to set the blocks
(setting the blocks is quiltspeak for the layout of your design). In this chapter,
I talk about the most common settings for quilt blocks and describe some
border variations to help you plan your quilt.
Set ’Em Up, Sally!
The arrangement of blocks in a quilt is called a set. Within a set, you also
have additional components such as sashing, cornerstones, and borders. You
can arrange quilt blocks in literally hundreds of ways, but in this section, I
stick to the most common sets. (For details on borders, skip to the section
“Making a Run for the Border.”)

The straight set and sashing
The most common and easiest set to put together is the straight set. You
arrange the blocks one against the other in orderly rows that run in vertical
and horizontal lines. Figure 6-1 shows a clear example of a straight set; it has
nine blocks stitched together in three rows of three blocks each. You can see
that the blocks are placed block-to-block, meaning that each block is placed
square with the ones around it.
The Blue Star Place Mat project in Chapter 18 uses this set; check out the
color section in the middle of the book for a photo of this project.
Figure 6-2 shows the same blocks as Figure 6-1, but the difference is that
they’re separated or framed by thin strips of fabric called sashing or lattice
strips. Adding sashing to the set gives the quilt a completely different look,
don’t you think? Sashing or lattice strips can be plain, or you can jazz them
up by inserting squares in the lattice, as you see in Figure 6-2. These squares
are called cornerstones or sashing squares.
You can find sashing used in a straight set in Pieced Blossoms Lap Quilt
(Chapter 17), Scrappy Bloomers Wall Hanging or Lap Quilt (Chapter 16),
Snow Crystals Lap Quilt (Chapter 16), and several other projects in Part V
(the color section shows the finished projects). Bear in mind that adding
additional sashing or borders increases the size of the finished quilt.

Part II: Planning Your Masterpiece 

The diagonal set
The second most common set is the diagonal set. In this arrangement, you
place the blocks diagonally, on their points, at a 45-degree angle from the
sides of the quilt. (Blocks set diagonally are said to be on point.)
In a diagonal set, you can use all patchwork blocks, or you can alternate just
a few patchwork blocks with plain squares, making great use of a minimal
number of patchwork blocks. The alternating layout, which you can see in
Figure 6-3, makes for a very traditional look.
If you decide to alternate your patchwork blocks with plain ones, in addition
to plain squares, you need two different sizes of plain fabric triangles:
 Large triangles for the perimeter
 Small triangles at the corners
To make your diagonal set quilt even more eye-catching, add diagonal sash-
ing strips and cornerstones to the blocks.
The Pastel Nine-Patch Wall Hanging project in Chapter 18 uses this simple but
versatile set (see the color section for a photo).

Chapter 6: Playing with Blocks and Borders: Which Way Should They Go?

The vertical or “strippy” set
Another popular set for quilt blocks is the vertical or “strippy” set, which is
one of my favorites. Instead of forming orderly rows of blocks, you place the
blocks in vertical strips separated by other strips (hence the name strippy).
Figure 6-4 shows a straight strippy set consisting of three rows and sashing.
In the two outer rows, the blocks are set diagonally on their points, and in the
middle strip, they’re in a straight set. As you can see, you can set your blocks
either way for an interesting result. You can really get creative with a strippy
quilt, setting your blocks diagonally, staggering them, or keeping them straight.
This set gives you a great opportunity to experiment with your graph paper
and see what design ideas you can come up with!
For a different look using the same strippy set, Figure 6-5 shows an offset
strippy layout (minus sashing) in which the blocks are set diagonally on their
points. Putting the blocks on point really plays up the offset look and gives
the pattern movement. Notice that the center strip is offset from the outer
strips by the addition of partial blocks to the top and bottom of the strip.

The medallion set
Some quilters prefer to set their blocks in the medallion set, in which a single
block or group of blocks acts as a central focal point. With the center in
place, you have a number of different options for the empty space surround-
ing it. You may want to simply use different types of sashing and borders. Or
if you’ve found a block design that complements the medallion block, you
can place a number of those blocks around it. In a common design using the
medallion set, you incorporate smaller versions of the medallion block, per-
haps rotating them as showing in Figure 6-6.
The Traditional Basket Wall Hanging project in Chapter 15 uses this type of
set (see the color section for a photo).
Making a Run for the Border
A border is a strip of fabric that frames a quilt. Usually, the entire quilt top is
bordered (sometimes with multiple borders), but you can also incorporate
borders surrounding your quilt blocks or as part of the quilt block design.
A quilt’s borders can be wide or narrow, pieced, appliquéd, or created using a
combination of techniques. Obviously, you should always try to choose a
border that complements rather than clashes with your blocks.

Part II: Planning Your Masterpiece 

Selecting a border type
You have dozens of border options to consider when planning your quilt,
but as with the arrangement of quilt blocks (see “Set ’Em Up, Sally” earlier
in the chapter), this section focuses on the most common borders you’re
likely to use.
The easiest and most common border style is the plain border, which uses
solid cuts of one fabric. Depending on your expertise, you can stitch the plain
border with squared corners or with mitered corners (see Figure 6-7). The
squared-corner border is the simpler of the two to stitch because you simply
extend two border strips to the very edge of the quilt. A mitered corner is
stitched at a 45-degree angle to the sides of the quilt, producing a picture
frame effect.
You may want to add cornerstones to your plain border (see Figure 6-8). The
cornerstones can be complementing or contrasting fabrics, or you can use
pieced or appliquéd blocks that complement the center area of your quilt.
For a more striking effect, make checkered borders by piecing small squares
of fabric together into strips and stitching them to the quilt center in the
same manner as you would a plain border.

Chapter 6: Playing with Blocks and Borders: Which Way Should They Go?

Calculating border size
After you decide what you want your border to look like, you need to figure
out how much border fabric to cut. Sometimes your first quilt can be, well,
a little off-kilter. The following steps guide you through a simple method for
cutting your borders while squaring up the quilt top at the same time, making
those uneven measurements jive once again! (The instructions in this section
work even if your quilt top is perfectly square, too.) To keep things simple,
assume that you want a border width of 10 inches.
1. To determine the length of your side borders, measure the length of
the quilt top down the center (see Figure 6-9).
2. Round off the measurement to the nearest inch.
If, for example, your quilt center is 33 inches long at the center, you have
a finished border size of 10 x 33 inches.
3. Add 1⁄4-inch seam allowances to all four sides of the side borders.
The cutting size of your side borders is 101⁄2 x 331⁄2 inches.
4. To determine the length of your top and bottom borders, measure the
quilt from the middle of one side to the middle of the other side,
including the side borders (see Figure 6-9).
Assuming that the width of the quilt is 22 inches across the middle and
your side borders are 10 inches wide, the finished size for your top and
bottom borders is 10 x 42 inches.
Figure 6-8:

stones.

Part II: Planning Your Masterpiece 

5. Add 1⁄4-inch seam allowances to all four sides of the top and bottom
borders.
The cutting size of your top and bottom borders is 101⁄2 x 421⁄2 inches.
Stitching the borders to your quilt
Before you attach borders to your quilt center, you need to prepare the
border strips so that everything (hopefully) comes out just right. Essentially,
you don’t want to end up with too little border fabric in proportion to your
quilt top.
1. Fold each of the four border strips in half width-wise to find the center
of the strip, and either press the fold to form a crease or place a pin at
the halfway point to mark it.
2. Find the center of each side of the quilt top and mark it in the same
manner (fold and press or mark with a pin).
After you mark the centers of the border strips and the quilt perimeter,
you’re ready to stitch.
3. Align the center fold of the border with the center fold of the quilt
top, having the right sides of the fabrics together.
4. Pin through the layers at the center marking and at each end.
The pins will hold the layers together during stitching.

Chapter 6: Playing with Blocks and Borders: Which Way Should They Go?

5. Stitch each border to the quilt along its length, easing in any excess
border fabric (eliminating puckering and helping to square up the
quilt again), using the following technique:
1. Place the side that has the excess length (whether it’s the border
or the quilt top) down against the feed dogs of your machine —
those are the ridged teeth under the plate of the machine that
move the fabric along as you stitch. These feed dogs help ease the
extra length for you because they tend to feed the bottom layer of
fabric through at a faster rate than the top layer, making it easier
to take up the slack. (This trick won’t work if you’re using an even-
feed foot, which I discuss in Chapter 13.)
2. Start stitching, holding back the top (shorter) layer slightly and
allowing the feed dogs to do their job of feeding the lower layer
of fabric.
6. After stitching the borders to the quilt top, press the seam allowances
toward the border fabric.

 Exploring design software for quilters
 Designing quilt blocks with digital tools
 Playing with your final product before you start working
Quilt design has come a long way since the days of horses and buggies.
Did you know you can easily design quilts on your home computer?
Designing blocks and entire quilts is fast and easy if you use software created
specifically for quilt design. In fact, computer-savvy quilters have an advantage
in that they can design quilts, test sets, and select fabrics for their masterpieces
before they even leave the house to get their materials.
With design software, you can do the following without cutting a single bit of
fabric:
 Design your own blocks
 Sample blocks from a block library
 Test different block layouts
 Sample different border styles
 Play with different fabric arrangements
 Print accurate patterns
 Print fabric shopping lists
Golly, who would have ever thought that handmade quilts and computers
would some day become a great team?
In this chapter, I walk you through the quilt-planning process using quilting
software, highlighting special features and timesavers along the way.

Software for Soft Quilts: Checking 
Out What’s Available
Several companies currently produce quality quilting software. Some even
offer free trial software, but you should be aware that trial software is usually
very limited. To best design quilts on the computer, you need to purchase the
real thing. A good software program will keep your fingers creatively tapping
and stitching for years!
To find a software program, enter the key phrase “quilting software” in any
search engine on the Internet. Your search should reveal plenty of options to
investigate further. Some of the most popular quilting software programs are:
 QuiltSoft
 EQ5
 PC Quilt
 QuiltPro
 SewPrecise
 Quilting Studio
Quilting software can be pricey, ranging from $50 to over $100, but not all soft-
ware is created equal. Some programs have more features than others, so you
need to shop carefully. Some of the less expensive programs limit your design
options to pieced designs only, making it difficult to design an appliqué block.
Others have limited block or fabric libraries. In many cases, spending a little
extra money upfront is a good idea because once you’re hooked, you’ll want
all those extra bells and whistles, believe me! It’s a blast skimming through
dozens of fabrics or sample blocks!
I like to use EQ5, the Electric Quilt Company’s software program, as well as its
fabric updates, which are called Stash. EQ5 is easy to use thanks to tutorials
that are so helpful even a child can master the software. After you purchase
the EQ5 software, you can go to the Electric Quilt Company’s Web site
(www.electricquilt.com) to download lots of freebies, including fabric
palettes and quilt blocks to add to your library; newsletters to help you
better use the software; and lots of tutorials. My favorite aspect of this soft-
ware is the frequent updates and tips found on the Web site — there’s always
something new to discover. Electric Quilt Company also makes another soft-
ware program called BlockBase, which features over 4,000 block designs,
ensuring that a quilter never runs out of blocks to play with!
You can purchase quilting software directly from the manufacturer via the
Internet, pick up a copy at a consumer sewing show, or inquire at your local
quilt shop (many quilt shops now carry software in their stores and may
even let you take a program for a test spin).

Part II: Planning Your Masterpiece 

Beginning Your Quilt Design: 
Building Blocks
I love designing quilts by using software! I don’t have to think much, and I
don’t get hand cramps from endless sketching. I may complain once in a
while about a cramp in my mouse-clicking finger, but I’m just joshing. One of
my favorite things to do before actually putting mouse to design pad is to
browse through the software block libraries, which are full of inspiring ideas
just waiting for me to tap into them.
All quilting software programs come with block libraries. By opening up a
library, you can select blocks, both pieced and appliquéd, based on existing
quilting designs. Some software programs have separate libraries for pieced
and appliquéd blocks, so check with your owner’s manual to be sure you’re
seeing it all. With a click of the mouse you can add blocks you like to an
assortment of layouts and then, like a kid with a box of crayons, color the
blocks and transform the design into your own unique masterpiece.
You can also build your own unique blocks, using block-building tools.
Standard options for new blocks include pieced blocks, appliquéd blocks,
blocks using mixed techniques, foundation piecing patterns, and stencils 
for quilting (I explain quilting stencils in Chapter 11).
81
Chapter 7: Using Your Computer as a Crystal Ball
The vector inspector
Design software — including quilting software —
uses technology known as vector graphics. To
make a long story short, vector graphics allow
you to take simple elements such as points, lines,
curves or arcs, and geometric shapes and com-
bine them to create an image on your computer
screen. These various design elements can then
be flipped, rotated, stretched, turned, skewed,
copied, and mirrored to create any design your
mind can imagine.
While you’re busy in the sketching phase, each
element of your design is layered, one on top of
the other. To prepare the design for printing by
the computer, it’s flattened or compressed into
one image. This compression is called rasteriz-
ing. In a nutshell, rasterizing squashes the
whole shebang and turns the finished drawing
into pixels — those billions of dots that make up
a picture on your computer screen.

Another really cool feature in some quilting design programs is the ability to
trace a bitmap image, such as a sketch you scan and save to a file. If you find
a picture or drawing you want to convert to an appliqué design, you simply
scan it, import it into your design software, and follow the instructions in
your owner’s manual, of course!
For all the tasks I cover in this chapter, I give you general directions that apply
to most software programs. For more specific instructions and trouble-shooting,
turn to the owner’s manual that came with your program.
Selecting or creating your block
To work with a ready-made block, open a block library, select the block you
want, and add it to your workbook or your favorite quilt layout. Repeat this
process for each block you want to use in your quilt design.
To design your own blocks, you open a sketchbook of sorts — a blank screen
with a grid layout similar to graph paper (see Figure 7-1). You can select the
number of grids in your block, usually by selecting a Layout Options tab (or
something similar) from the toolbar in your program.
I like to use a grid that matches my desired block size. For example, if I’m cre-
ating a quilt based on 12-inch blocks, I set up a 12- x 12-square grid. If I want a
10-inch block, I use a 10- x 10-square grid. When designing more intricate
blocks, I like to double the grid size for more flexibility and to make the
design easier to see and break down into individual pieces. For example, I
may use a 20- x 20-square grid for a 10-inch block and a 24- x 24-square grid
for a 12-inch block.
Perfecting your block design
With a blank design grid on your computer screen, you can use the tools
available in your design program to draw your block. These tools typically
consist of lines and arcs and include options to copy, flip, and resize anything
you draw. Playing with the different tools in your software allows you to layer
appliqués on your block, rotate, resize, and reshape any element of your
design.
After you click on the desired tool and place it on your design grid, you’ll
notice that the shape appearing on the screen has something akin to handles
(see Figure 7-2). These are your grabbing points for resizing, reshaping, or
otherwise altering the shape or entire block. Different programs have slightly
different handles, but they function in the same way: Just click on one of the
grabbing points with your mouse and drag your mouse until you achieve the
desired effect.
82
Part II: Planning Your Masterpiece 

When you have your block design the way you want it, save it to your project
file, or start adding fabrics to your design using your software’s fabric
libraries. (I like to wait until all the elements of my “sketch” are complete
before I start trying on fabrics, but it’s just a matter of preference.)
Click on a “handle” to
alter the shape or size
of a block or shape.

83
Chapter 7: Using Your Computer as a Crystal Ball

Even though you create specific sized blocks in your block sketchpad, you can
easily resize the blocks when laying out the final quilt. All you need to do is
revise the size block you desire in your quilt layout (see the next section) —
the software does the rest!
Don’t know what size blocks you need for a quilt that fits your king-size bed?
The software does! Just enter the size you want your finished quilt to be, and
the design program works out your block measurements so they fit your
desired quilt size. You can also specify the number of blocks and borders
you’d like to have in your finished design. The software considers these pref-
erences and produces a layout you can manipulate until it’s just the way you
want it.
Glimpsing Your Quilt’s Future
Every quilter wishes he or she could see what a quilt will really look like
before purchasing or cutting into expensive fabric. Thank goodness for quilt-
ing software — it’s like a peek into the future. You can see what works and
what doesn’t work before you invest any more time or money in a project!
With design software, you can see if your blocks look better in a straight set
or on point, need narrow or wide borders, look better with or without sashing,
and you can easily try on various color palettes for size. (For color palette
and fabric information, check out Chapter 3.)
Playing with layouts and borders
Quilting programs come with layout libraries, so all you have to do is select a
layout and add your quilt blocks. You can choose from straight sets, strippy
sets, medallions, blocks on point, free-floating blocks, charm quilt layouts,
and more, all of which can be arranged horizontally or vertically. (For exam-
ples of these layouts, flip to Chapter 6.) You can also create your own custom
layouts.
With your set selected, you can add sashing strips between the blocks in any
size, add one or more borders, and choose the perfect style of border for
your quilt.
After selecting your layout and border design, you’ll see a skeleton of your
quilt on your computer screen. This skeleton is ready to be filled with the
blocks you designed or selected from the block libraries. Simply click on the
thumbnail of the desired block and then the area of the quilt where you want
the block to appear, and voila! It’s there!
84
Part II: Planning Your Masterpiece 

Trying on fabrics from fabric libraries
Quilting software is equipped with libraries full of fabrics that you can apply
to your quilt without ever having to make a single cut. Fabrics of various
colors and prints arranged in different themes or collections help take the
guesswork out of selecting fabrics that work well together.
To colorize a block with a sample fabric, simply open the desired block in
your sketchpad, select your fabrics, and click on the individual elements of
your block to add the fabrics. After you get the hang of it, this is really easy
stuff.
When you have the block and fabric the way you want it, save the block to
your file, and add the colorized block to your quilt layout. After arranging
your colorized blocks, select the fabrics for your borders and add them to
the layout. When you’re done, your quilt mock-up is ready to go.
If you can’t find just the right fabric for your quilt in your software’s existing
fabric libraries, add-ons and updates should be available through your soft-
ware’s manufacturer. I like to order the updates each year so I can always
have the latest and greatest fabric choices on hand when I’m designing.
Calculating yardage and printing patterns
With your quilt designed and the perfect color selections made, you’re ready
to shop for fabric. Yet again, you’re not on your own; let the program print
out a shopping list for you. The process is fast and simple, and you end up
with a very accurate to-buy list. Best of all, you know you don’t have to guess
when buying fabric or worry that you’ll end up with too much or too little of
something.
When it comes time to think about actually cutting out your quilt block
pieces, your quilting software can print accurate pattern templates with 
a simple click of your mouse.
To help them hold up better and give you more consistently accurate 
cuts, glue these templates to cardstock or cardboard as recommended 
in Chapter 5.

In this part . . .
I
n this part, I explain all the skills necessary to get you
happily stitching along on your first quilt. Starting with
cutting basics (including using the quilter’s dream tool,
the rotary cutter), I share my tips for pressing the pointi-
est points, stitching the sharpest seams, and indulging
your passion for appliqué.

Chapter 8
Cuts and Creases: 
Pressing Matters
In This Chapter
 Thinking before you cut
 Familiarizing yourself with rotary cutting
 Turning to pressing matters
You may be thinking, “Why bother with a chapter on cutting and press-
ing? Everyone knows how to use a pair of scissors and an iron, right?”
Well, although everyone certainly knows how to use a pair of scissors, few
may realize the importance of cutting accurately, especially when it comes to
quilting! Accurate cutting is just as important as accurate piecing if you want
your project to turn out well. Also important to the cutting process is laying
out pattern pieces efficiently to avoid wasted fabric; fabric can be expensive,
and you want to be certain you have enough to complete your project.
Finally, proper pressing, just like accurate cutting and stitching, can mean the
difference between a well-made block and a crooked, misshapen one. Smooth
seams make the stitching process much easier and give your quilt its crisp
neatness.
In this chapter, I review basic techniques of cutting and pressing that are sure
to make this part of your quilt-making adventure go smoothly.
Creating a Cutting Game Plan
I know you’re eager to dive into your lovely fabrics and cut, cut, cut, but you
need to restrain yourself just a little while longer. Cutting is a crucial part of
the quilt-making process, and if you don’t take your time to get it right, you’re
sure to have problems later on. (The information in this section applies to
general preparation and cutting; for details and instructions specific to rotary
cutting, see the section “Slicing through Rotary Cutting Basics” later in the
chapter.)

The first thing to consider is what pieces you’re going to cut first. Most quilt-
ing instructions tell you to cut the largest pieces first — usually the borders
and sashing, and that’s a good rule to follow even when the directions don’t
specify a cutting order. Cutting the borders and sashing first makes more effi-
cient use of a large length of fabric and saves you from having to piece them
together or buy more fabric later. With the large pieces out of the way, you
then cut the smaller pieces of your pattern from the remaining fabric.
Before cutting into any fabric, take a close look at the block you want to make
and figure out which way the fabric grain should go on each piece (refer to
Chapter 5 for information about grain lines). When you’ve determined the
direction of the grain, lay your templates on the wrong side of the fabric, plac-
ing as many similar pieces together as possible. For instance, as Figure 8-1
shows, place triangles together with their longest sides facing, and neatly line
up squares. Rearrange your templates as many times as necessary to make
them all fit. You haven’t marked or cut anything yet, so now’s the time to play
around.
To keep your templates from slipping as you trace, glue a piece of fine-grain
sandpaper to their back sides, or brush a thin layer of rubber cement onto
their back sides and allow them to dry before placing them on your fabric.
With your templates firmly in place, trace lightly around them with a wash-
able pencil or tailor’s chalk. Don’t use a regular pencil or pen — they may
stain the fabric.
Keep in mind that if you’re using a window template, the inner (broken) line
on the templates is the stitching line and the outer (solid) line is the cutting
line. For more on templates and how to use premade ones or make your own,
check out Chapter 5.

Part III: Sharpening Your Sewing Skills 

With the pieces of your quilt block traced and ready to take shape, you have
two cutting options: fabric scissors or a rotary cutter. Fabric scissors are best
suited to cutting through just one layer of fabric at a time. A rotary cutter,
which I explain more in the section “Slicing through Rotary Cutting Basics,”
gives you better precision when cutting one or multiple layers of fabric.
If you decide to use scissors, make sure they’re sharp to the very tip of the
blades. (Nice sharp tips make it easier to trim appliqués and those hard-to-
reach places!) If you’ve kept your fabric-cutting scissors hidden away from
those who dishonor their sacredness by using them to cut paper, cardboard,
or other taboo items, your cutting line should be sharp and clean. If you have
any difficulty cutting fabric, your scissors aren’t sharp enough! You can either
have them sharpened or skip the delay and just purchase a fresh pair.
Keeping scissors sharpened is smarter and easier than risking the ruin of
your fabric and your project by cutting inaccurate or sloppy-looking pieces.
Slicing through Rotary Cutting Basics
Using a rotary cutter with a see-through ruler and rotary cutting mat (see
Chapter 2 for information about rotary cutting supplies) is by far the quickest
and most accurate method of cutting fabric. I urge you to get acquainted with
this tool — you’ll love it!
You may find this method of cutting referred to by other quilters as template-
free cutting because instead of tracing around your templates with a pencil
and cutting the pieces out one-by-one, you cut multiple pieces of a specific
size simultaneously.
This section covers the very basics of rotary cutting. So many different
rotary cutting tips and techniques are available that it’s impossible to cover
them all in this chapter. If you want more detail, consult any of the many won-
derful books that have been written on rotary cutting methods. Check out the
booklist in the Appendix for some of my favorites.
Prepping your fabric for rotary cutting
Because you don’t use templates and trace your pieces out first, rotary cut-
ting requires a straight edge on which to base your shapes. To prepare your
washed and pressed fabric for rotary cutting, fold the fabric along the center
with right sides together and the tidy selvage edges (not the ragged, cut
edges) together. Press along the crease. Then place the folded fabric on your
cutting mat and square up one end by placing the ruler along one of the lines
on the mat, as shown in Figure 8-2. You don’t need to remove a large strip to
square-up your fabric — just enough to make the edge even.
91
Chapter 8: Cuts and Creases: Pressing Matters

Slice off the uneven edge of the fabric with the rotary cutter, placing the
blade against the ruler and cutting away from you in one continuous motion.
If you’re right-handed, the waste fabric will be on the right of your ruler; if
you’re left-handed, the waste fabric will be on the left of the ruler.
Cutting strips, squares, and rectangles
With a rotary cutter, you can breeze right through strips, squares, and rectan-
gles. To make things really easy, squares and rectangles start out as strips.
Follow these instructions to cut strips of fabric (no matter the width):
1. Align the newly squared edge of your fabric (see the preceding sec-
tion) with the line on your cutting mat that gives you the strip width
you want.
For example, if you want 21⁄2-inch strips, find the 21⁄2-inch mark on the mat
and place your ruler along this mark. (Depending on how long your folded
fabric is, you may only be able to see the mat lines at the very top and
bottom of the mat.)
3. Slice off the strip with the rotary cutter, cutting away from you in one
continuous motion.
As I mentioned earlier, squares and rectangles start out as strips. After you
have a strip the width of the squares or rectangles you want, you use the
same basic measurement instructions listed above to cut your strip into indi-
vidual pieces, as shown in Figure 8-3.
Cut as many squares or rectangles as you need. Just remember that you’re
cutting through a double thickness of fabric (because the fabric is folded
when you cut the strips); therefore, you get two pieces for each cut.

Cutting triangles
Cutting triangles with a rotary cutter may stir up long-lost memories of your
high school geometry class, but I promise that it’s much easier than your
class ever was — and much less stressful. For simple, template-free triangles
with 45-degree angles, cut squares first (refer back to the preceding section
for square-cutting instructions), and then cut each square in half diagonally,
as shown in Figure 8-4.
To cut other types of triangles, such as the 60-degree triangle shown in
Figure 8-5, you can use a triangular ruler, which is available in a variety of 
different sizes. Like your regular ruler, these rulers are also see-through and
heavy-duty plastic, so they’re easy to use in conjunction with your regular
ruler and rotary cutter.

93
Chapter 8: Cuts and Creases: Pressing Matters

When cutting triangles, take into account that the longest side of the triangle
also needs a seam allowance! If the finished size of the triangle will be 2 inches,
don’t cut a 21⁄2-inch square in half to make triangles; you’ll have seam
allowances on the short edges but not on the long edge.
Addressing Pressing
Properly pressing your fabric pieces and your seams (after you start stitching
pieces together) is crucial to making your work look “just right.” The pressing
tips and techniques that I share in this section aren’t difficult to perform or
remember.
You may have noticed that I use the term pressing rather than ironing —
there’s a critical distinction. With pressing, you don’t slide your iron across
the fabric as you would when ironing. Instead, you lift the iron to move it to a
new location and then lower it down, as shown in Figure 8-6. You don’t need
to press down on the iron — let the weight of the iron do the job.
Sliding the iron across the fabric tends to distort bias edges and can really
stretch your pieces out of place.

As for equipment and setup, don’t use an iron with an automatic shut-off 
feature if you plan on doing a lot of quilting. The iron is guaranteed to shut off
at the most inopportune times, so you’ll find yourself resetting it constantly.
Also, keep your iron within easy reach of your cutting and sewing area so you
can easily press as you stitch. (I always keep my ironing board just a few
steps away.)

Chapter 8: Cuts and Creases: Pressing Matters
Keeping track of cut pieces
Neatly organizing cut pieces of fabric not only
helps keep your work area clean and the pieces
from getting mixed up but also shows you at a
glance what you’ve already cut and what still
needs to be done.
To keep all those little pieces neat and organ-
ized, stack them by color, shape, and so on.
Then store them using one of the following
methods:
 Place individual stacks of cut pieces in
clear plastic zip-top bags to keep them tidy
and contained.
 Thread a needle and insert it into the top of
a stack, pulling the needle through the entire
stack of pieces at once, as shown in the
figure below. Leaving a 3-inch tail of thread
at the top of the stack, insert the needle
through the stack again, going from the
bottom up. Without knotting it, cut off the
thread, leaving another 3-inch tail. When
you need to use a piece from the stack,
simply pull one off the top. The thread will
hold the remainder in place!
Store your bags or threaded piles in a pretty
basket or box, or better yet, if you’re working on
more than one project at the same time, store
the pieces in separate baskets or boxes.

Pressing seam allowances
After you stitch pieces of fabric together, you need to press the seams to
ensure that everything lays neatly when you add more pieces and assemble
everything together. You should always press a seam before stitching across
it with another seam.
To press your seam allowances, set your iron for cotton with no steam and
then follow these easy steps:
1. With the right sides of the sewn fabric still facing each other, press the
seam to set the stitching.
2. Open up the fabric pieces along the seam, and with the right side
facing up, press along the seam.
3. Flip the opened piece over so the seam is facing up, and press both
the seam allowances toward the darker fabric.
Pressing to the darker side prevents dark shadows from showing
through the lighter fabrics in the finished quilt.
Be sure to press the seam allowances together in one direction rather
than open. When you press a seam open, only the stitching thread keeps
the pieces together. Pressing the seam allowances to one side provides
an added layer of fabric across the seam, making the seam stronger and
more durable.
4. Wherever multiple seams meet, press them in opposite directions to
avoid bulk (see Figure 8-7).
This technique may mean that sometimes you have to go against Step 3
and press toward a lighter fabric, but that’s okay.
When you need to press toward the lighter fabric, hand trim a small bit
of the seam allowance from the darker fabric to avoid a strong shadow
showing through the lighter fabric.

Part III: Sharpening Your Sewing Skills 

When pressing the seams of long strips such as borders, change the direction
of the tip of the iron each time you lift and lower it, as shown in Figure 8-8, to
ensure that your strip doesn’t favor one side and stretch out of whack. If you
forget to press and accidentally slide the iron along the strip, the seam may
curve, resulting in a less-than-straight strip of fabric. To correct the minor
disfigurement, dab a little water onto the seam line (just a dab!), realign your
edge, and press again the correct way. The seam should stay in shape as long
as you press and don’t slide.
If you’re having trouble getting a seam to lie flat, apply a bit of water with
your fingertips where you need it and press on. Don’t spray or dampen an
entire block — use the water only where needed.
Blowing off steam
Throughout this chapter I’ve talked a lot about pressing, but I’ve never men-
tioned steam because water and steam are rarely ever used when making a
quilt — and for good reason.
The long and the short of it is that steam can result in distortion by causing
the quilting fabric to swell and dry again. It can also permanently set a seam
before its time. For example, suppose you steam-press a block that you later
discover is a little off-kilter. You decide to take the block apart and restitch it
for the sake of accuracy (what a good quilter you are!). Because your block
was steam-pressed, you’ll notice that the creases won’t release without using
more water, which only makes the fabric swell and shrink even more, distort-
ing your cut edges a bit and causing some hairy-looking fringing. You end up
scrapping the block in favor of recutting and stitching.
Never press a finished quilt. Pressing — either wet or dry — flattens the bat-
ting, therefore defeating the purpose of quilting through three layers. No one
wants a flat quilt! If your finished quilt needs a little face-lift after being
folded, pop it in the clothes dryer and select a delicate or fluff setting. After a
few minutes of tumbling, the creases release and your quilt’s fluffy and cozy
once again.

Positively Perfect Piecing
In This Chapter
 Piecing quickly and neatly on a machine
 Taking the traditional hand piecing approach
 Sorting out tricky seams
P
erfect piecing doesn’t require profuse preparation, but some preliminary
planning (placing pieces together in pairs) will better prepare you for
producing perfect patchwork.
Did you get that? Essentially, accurate piecing requires preparation. A little
work upfront not only ensures piecing success but also makes the job pro-
ceed more smoothly and quickly.
In this chapter, I guide you through all the piecing techniques you need to
know to make accurately pieced blocks. I also share a few tricks for speeding
up the process and repairing the inevitable mistake. Well-formed points and
perfectly square blocks are well within reach if you follow just a few basic
rules, so don’t be shy — dive on in!
Perfect Machine Piecing for 
the Impatient Quilter
Your grandmother may have spent her free time painstakingly piecing her
quilt squares by hand, but today, you have the good fortune to be able to
piece by machine. As a self-described “machine queen,” I prefer to do every-
thing I can with the aid of my sewing machine. Elias Howe, the wonderful
wizard who patented the very first sewing machine in 1846, is truly my hero.
Although the rules are basically the same for both hand and machine piecing,
machine piecing dramatically reduces the time it takes to complete a quilt
top. (If you like to stitch on the go or simply don’t want to use a machine, see
“Hand Piecing for the Purist” later in this chapter.)

Chances are good that if you’re attempting to make a quilt (even if it’s your
first), you already know something about the basic workings of a sewing
machine. So this section simply covers some setup details and techniques
that are specific to machine piecing.
Setting up your machine
Piecing by machine is a breeze. It’s fast, accurate, and easy. But before sewing
a single stitch, make sure that your machine is set up properly by following
the basic steps I outline in this section.
Loading your thread
Thread both the upper part of the machine and the bobbin with an all-purpose
thread. Select a thread color that coordinates with the fabrics you’re stitching
together. If you’re working with different colored fabrics, select a thread from
the mid-color range — one that falls somewhere between your darkest and
lightest fabric colors.
Using the presser foot
Your seam allowance, the area of fabric taken up by the seam, is probably the
most important factor to keep in mind when piecing, whether your block is
simple or elaborate. And unless you’re quilting in miniature, your seam
allowance is always exactly 1⁄4 inch.
Some machines come with a special patchwork presser foot that measures
exactly 1⁄4 inch from the needle hole to the outside edge of the foot. To stitch
an accurate seam allowance every time, simply keep the edge of your fabric
aligned with the edge of the foot (see Figure 9-1).

Part III: Sharpening Your Sewing Skills 

If your machine didn’t come with a patchwork presser foot, you may be able
to purchase one from a sewing machine dealer. Dealers usually carry machine
feet for specific brands of machines as well as “generic” feet that fit a number
of different machines. When you go shopping for a patchwork presser foot, be
sure to take along one of the feet that came with your machine. Otherwise,
you may get home and find that your new presser foot doesn’t fit your
machine’s specifications. What a bummer!
Before you start piecing with the new presser foot, check the accuracy of its
1⁄4-inch measurement by placing a lightweight piece of paper in your machine
and lowering the presser foot. Make a few stitches, and before you remove
the paper from the machine, mark a pencil line along the edge of the presser
foot. Remove the paper, and measure the distance from the needle holes to
the pencil line. If this measurement is exactly 1⁄4 inch, you’re in great shape! If
the measurement isn’t accurate, use the tape trick described in the sidebar
“Taking advantage of tape” to help keep your seam allowances accurate.
Checking stitch length and tension
Set your machine’s stitch length to its default setting (usually 12 to 14
stitches per inch, depending on the machine). Then make sure your machine
is stitching properly before you attempt to machine piece anything. A machine
with an improper tension setting can produce pieces that pucker or have
seams that separate slightly after stitching.
Checking the tension is especially important if you’re using an older machine
that hasn’t been professionally serviced in a while or if you’re working on a
hand-me-down or borrowed machine or garage sale find. Poor tension isn’t
much of a problem with newer machines because they’re usually equipped
with safeguards to keep the tension properly set.
101
Chapter 9: Positively Perfect Piecing
Taking advantage of tape
If you prefer not to bother with a patchwork
presser foot, or if you discover that your patch-
work foot isn’t accurate, you can make your own
stitching guide with a piece of masking tape.
Without any fabric in the machine, simply meas-
ure 1⁄4 inch from your needle and place a piece
of tape on your sewing machine’s throat plate,
that slab of metal with the hole in it that the
needle goes up and down, and up and down
through, so that the right edge of the tape is at
the 1⁄4 mark. This tape is your seam guide, mean-
ing that you align the right-hand edge of the
fabric you’re piecing with the tape line as you
sew and end up with a straight, exact 1⁄4-inch
seam. Tip: You may need to replace the tape
often if you do a lot of stitching.

To make sure your tension is properly set, run this little test: Machine stitch
through a double layer of fabric using a light-colored all-purpose thread in
the machine and a dark-colored all-purpose thread on the bobbin. Take a
close look at the resulting stitches:
 If the dark bobbin thread is pulled to the top surface: Loosen the
upper tension on the machine just slightly. Sew another test piece and
look at it again. Keep sewing, examining, and loosening the top until the
stitch is even on both sides.
 If the top thread is pulled to the bottom surface: Your bobbin is probably
adjusted too tightly. Loosen the adjusting screw slightly — a quarter-
turn at a time is fine. Keep stitching, examining, and loosening the
bobbin until the stitch is even on both sides.
Keeping your needle sharp
Believe it or not, I’ve run into people who’ve said, “What? Change my needle?
Why should I? It still sews, and I’ve had it in my machine for 10 years.” My
only response is, “Yikes!”
Changing sewing machine needles regularly is something I just can’t drill into
you enough! It’s absolutely essential! That needle affects the machine tension,
the ability to make properly formed stitches, and the wear and tear on your
fabric. A dull and rounded needle leaves larger holes than necessary in your
fabric and can mess up your tension by allowing thread to travel through the
holes. A needle with a burr on it (a sharp protrusion of metal, often cause by
stitching over a pin) catches the fabric’s fibers, causing it to pucker. A burr
may also cause your machine thread to break or produce a fuzzy bump on
your thread that won’t fit through the needle’s eye.
I usually insert a new needle in my machine after 40 to 50 hours of sewing.
Other quilters change their needles less or more frequently depending on
their machines, the types of fabric they’re sewing, and their own personal
preferences.
Always keep a fresh pack of needles on hand because you never know when
a bad needle will start to affect your sewing or when a needle may break.
(For the skinny on needles, flip to Chapter 2.)
Chain piecing to save time and thread
Chain piecing is an exercise in efficiency; it allows you to zip through a lot of
piecing without all the normal starts and stops, and it lets you save a little
thread. Before you can start chain piecing, though, you need to get your
pieces pulled together and ready to go. The following steps guide you
through chain piecing, from beginning to end:
102
Part III: Sharpening Your Sewing Skills 

1. Take two fabric pieces that need to be sewn together and pin them
with their right sides facing. Do this for all your fabric pieces, pairing
them in twos.
2. Place your pinned pieces in a stack next to your sewing machine.
3. Begin stitching by running one pinned pair under your presser foot.
When you reach the end of the piece, feed in a second pair without
stopping the machine or cutting the threads. Continue feeding each
pinned pair through the machine until all are stitched and you have a
chain of stitched pieces connected by thread (see Figure 9-2).
4. Cut your pieces apart at the threads in between each pair, and press
them open.
Hand Piecing for the Purist
Some quilters prefer to hand piece their blocks rather than buzz through
them on a sewing machine. They enjoy sticking with tradition and like the
feel of the fabric flowing through their hands as they stitch. I call these fine,
devoted folks “quilting purists.”
Figure 9-2:

Chapter 9: Positively Perfect Piecing

Hand piecing is certainly a traditional and time-honored approach to patch-
work quilting, but it also has the added benefit of being portable. By stashing
a needle, thread, fabric pieces, and small scissors in your purse or briefcase,
you can work on a project virtually anywhere.
If you commute, try piecing instead of staring out the train window. If you
travel, tuck your supplies in your carry-on bag and use your flight time for
stitching. Quilting beats reading the emergency evacuation guidelines over
and over again (although you should certainly read them at least once) or
playing tic-tac-toe on the back of an airsick bag for the hundredth time!
You also can carry your supplies to your kids’ baseball practices or ballet 
lessons. You may even find yourself making new friends who either share
your interest in quilting or who would like to learn but have been too afraid
to try. Become a quilting advocate!
There’s very little difference between hand piecing and machine piecing; 
with hand piecing, you use a special template and begin and end your stitch-
ing in a particular way. Hand piecing uses a 1/4-inch seam allowance just like
machine piecing. However, because you don’t have the machine’s presser
foot as a stitching guide, you need to mark seam allowances directly onto the
wrong sides of your fabric pieces to keep your seam allowances accurate.
To accurately mark your seam allowances, make or buy a window template, a
template with a hole or window in the center for marking your seam line, for
each piece. Figure 9-3 shows window templates.
104
Part III: Sharpening Your Sewing Skills 
As ye sew, so shall ye rip!
We’re human. We make mistakes — sometimes
lots of them! And that humanity is exactly why
it’s important to know how to use a seam ripper
properly and always have one on hand when
piecing blocks.
Notice that I said “seam ripper” and not “fabric
ripper.” The whole point of these handy little
tools is to undo the seam on a botched stitching
job — not to rip through the fabric and ruin an
entire patch.
To use a seam ripper correctly, insert the tool’s
sharp point under the first stitch and tug to cut it.
Cut the thread in the same manner every five or
six stitches or until you can easily separate the
two pieces of fabric. If the fabric pieces are still
difficult to separate, cut the thread at closer inter-
vals but don’t forcefully separate the pieces —
you risk ripping them or distorting their shapes.
Warning: Always store your seam ripper with
the cover on. Proper storage not only keeps it
sharp and free of moisture, but it also keeps you
from getting stabbed while rummaging through
your sewing supplies! If your seam ripper
becomes dull or rusted, throw it out and invest
in a new one.

To use the template, lay it on the wrong side of the fabric you want to cut and
sew, and trace around the template’s outer edge with a washable pencil (see
Chapter 2 for the scoop on washable pens and pencils). This first line is your
cutting line. Next, trace around the inside edge of the template to create your
stitching line.
To hand stitch fabric pieces together, follow these steps:
1. Place the pieces right sides together.
For ease of handling, you may want to place a pin at each end of the
stitching line and another at the midpoint to hold the layers together
and prevent them from shifting as you stitch.
2. Cut a length of thread no longer than your arm, and thread a hand-
sewing needle with it, as shown in Figure 9-4. Knot the longer end.
This knot is your waste knot and will be cut off later.

Chapter 9: Positively Perfect Piecing

3. To begin stitching, start your thread just inside the edge of the piece
and backstitch to the edge. Then reverse your stitching direction and
stitch across the entire length of the stitching line, making small, even
stitches.
Try to space these stitches as evenly as possible — shoot for eight to
ten stitches per inch.
4. When you reach the opposite end of the stitching line, reverse the
direction of your stitching again and backstitch three or four stitches.
Backstitching secures the thread and keeps the seam from coming
undone.
5. Cut off the thread, and carefully cut off the waste knot from your
starting point.
After you become comfortable with hand stitching, you can eliminate the
waste knot. Simply backstitch a few times at the beginning, leaving a tail to
trim later, and then backstitch again at the end.
Piecing Blocks with Set-in Seams
At times during the piecing process, you run into a seam that needs special
attention, such as a set-in seam. Set-in seams result from pieces that need to
be inserted into the block at an awkward angle rather than stitched as a tidy
unit. You can see a set-in component in Figure 9-5; notice that stitching the
shaded unit in place requires two seams (one on either angle) rather than
one. (The blocks of the Pink Tulips Breakfast Set project in Chapter 18
include set-in elements.)
Templates for set-in components have dots at the corners where seam
allowances converge (see Figure 9-6). These dots are very important because
they indicate where you need to begin and end your stitching. Be sure to
transfer these dots to cut pieces of fabric before stitching the pieces to the
other components.
Figure 9-5:
The shaded
piece is a
set-in
component.
106
Part III: Sharpening Your Sewing Skills 

Do not go past the dots when stitching set-in pieces. If you stitch to the ends
of the units, your pieces won’t fit together properly; in fact, you’ll end up with
a pucker forming at the convergence of the seams. Sewing set-in pieces isn’t
rocket science — just stop at the dots and your blocks will be fine.
Set-in blocks are all different, but the stitching order is generally like the 
diagram shown in Figure 9-7.After you stitch along one side and end your
stitching at the dot, stitch the second piece to the first from the opposite
direction, also ending your stitching at the dot.

Standing on a Firm Foundation
Quilters and designers are always coming up with terrific new ways to create
intricate quilt blocks and stitch them accurately. Foundation piecing allows
you to do both with one tidy printed-paper package.
Foundation piecing differs from traditional piecing methods because you
actually stitch fabric directly onto paper, seam allowances and all. You typi-
cally start stitching from the center of the block outwards and watch as the
block magically appears right before your eyes. It’s one of my favorite tech-
niques and easy to get hooked on!
A great benefit of working with foundation piecing is that you can make some
teensy-weensy little blocks! You may even want to try using this technique to
make a small wall hanging or a pieced bookmark.
What is foundation piecing?
In foundation piecing, you work with snippets of fabric that are slightly larger
than you need and sew them backwards on a foundation of lightweight paper
printed with the desired block design. Hence the “foundation” aspect of this
technique — the paper is the foundation of the design (and you remove it
after piecing is complete).
Patterns for foundation piecing are very simple to use. Foundation blocks 
are always numbered to indicate the order in which you stitch the pieces 
to the paper. Usually, the starting point is somewhere near the center of the
block and you work outwards, adding fabric bits as you stitch to complete
the design. Figure 9-8 shows a typical foundation block before piecing and a
completed block. Notice that the finished block is facing the opposite direc-
tion as the pattern. That’s because you stitch from the wrong side of the
block rather than the front.
Foundation piecing differs from another well-loved quilt-making technique
called paper piecing or English paper piecing. With paper piecing, you cut 
separate templates for each individual piece of a block or design. Then you
wrap fabric around the paper template and sew the templates together
along the folded fabric edge to make some very complex designs, such as
hexagons and miniature blocks. For visual explanations of these different
piecing techniques, visit www.museum.state.il.us/muslink/art/
htmls/ks_tech.html.
108
Part III: Sharpening Your Sewing Skills 

Putting fabric to paper
After you’ve chosen or designed your foundation piecing block, it’s time to
have some fun. Really, the stitching is the best part!
You need one printed block pattern for each quilt square you plan to make.
For smaller block patterns, you can often fit several patterns on a page for
printing or copying. Larger patterns may only fit one or two per page.
When copying or printing patterns for foundation piecing, use the cheapest
paper you can find (cheap computer paper works best). The thinner the
paper, the easier it is to stitch and see through.
The following steps explain how to start stitching a foundation pieced block.
Refer to Figure 9-9 as needed.
1. Lay out the paper pattern for one block.
2. Starting with the part of the pattern that’s labeled number 1, cut a
piece of the desired fabric slightly larger than the area you’re filling.
3. With the right side of the fabric facing out, pin the fabric piece to the
number 1 spot on the unmarked side of the paper.
4. Cut a piece of fabric slightly larger than area number 2, and pin it to
the paper, overlapping the first piece and making sure that the right
sides of the two fabrics are facing each other.
5. With the marked side of the paper facing up, stitch along the line on
the paper where the two pieces meet.
6. Trim the excess fabric to within 1⁄4 inch of the stitching line, remove
the pins, and press open the newly pieced fabric

Chapter 9: Positively Perfect Piecing

Repeat the process until you’ve stitched together all the pieces of the block.
The outermost pieces of fabric should extend beyond the final cutting line
(the outermost edge of the pattern). To finish the block, trim away the excess
fabric to the seam allowances indicated by the outermost pattern lines.
Wasn’t that fun? I bet you’ll be making more of these! (When you get comfort-
able with the process, consider trying the Chicken Scratch Foundation-Pieced
Quilt project in Chapter 15.)

Do You Know the Way 
to Appliqué?
In This Chapter
 Understanding the artistic nature of appliqué
 Starting out with appliqué basics
 Accommodating seam allowances
 Getting some help from fusible webbing
T
he term appliqué is French (oui!) and means “to apply,” which is basically
what you do to appliqué a quilt: You apply bits of fabric to other fabric.
Unlike patchwork, in which the pieces are cut and stitched together, appliqué
calls for layering pieces one upon the other on a base or background fabric.
The layers are stitched in place by hand or machine. Appliqué pieces can be
any shape, giving you the freedom to use curved designs that are impossible
to create with traditional patchwork methods.
In this chapter, I introduce you to the basic types of appliqué — with or 
without seam allowances — as well as the different methods for executing
appliqué — by hand or by using a sewing machine. The methods and tech-
niques I cover are by no means your only options; there are as many different
ways of doing appliqué as there are quilters.
Appliqué: Stylistic Versatility
The versatility of appliqué enables you, the quilt maker, to consider an infi-
nite number of design possibilities! Appliqué styles can range from traditional
and folksy (see the sidebar “Spotlight on a classic American appliqué design”)
to contemporary or even avant-garde depending on your skills and prefer-
ences. You can also combine appliqué techniques with patchwork to create
intricate blocks and use the techniques to add interest to other designs.

When creating an appliquéd quilt, you can choose from a number of different
appliqué methods that vary in their levels of preparation and difficulty. I stick
with the most basic methods here — such as using freezer paper to help you
turn under seam allowances and fusible webbing to make everything much
easier — to give you a good foundation for developing your appliqué skills.
If you’re working on an appliqué project that calls for a method you’re unfa-
miliar with, don’t hesitate to substitute any of the appliqué methods in this
chapter for what’s listed in your project instructions. With appliqué, there are
many different ways to get the job done, and there’s nothing wrong with
switching to an appliqué technique you enjoy or are most comfortable with.
When you feel ready to move on to projects and methods that are more difficult
than what I cover in this book, turn to any of a number of books specifically
devoted to appliqué to guide you through the more advanced techniques.
You may even decide to take a class and discover new methods of appliqué
in a hands-on setting.
Appliqué Basics for Hand and Machine
The appliqué fence is home to two birds: Hand appliqué and machine
appliqué. With hand appliqué techniques, you stitch pieces of fabric, usually
with turned-under seam allowances, to their background fabric by hand using
a variety of stitches ranging from invisible to decorative. Machine appliqué
techniques may also require the turning-under of seam allowances, but in
most cases, you forgo seam allowances altogether and use satin stitch
machine stitching or other decorative machine stitching to enclose the raw
edges of the appliqué.
112
Part III: Sharpening Your Sewing Skills 
Spotlight on a classic American appliqué design
One of the most well-known forms of hand
appliqué is the Baltimore Album style, which
reached its greatest popularity in 19th-century
Baltimore, Maryland. This style of appliqué is
done in traditional shades of red and green fabric
appliqués on a white background. What gives
this design an album feel is the fact that each
block features a different motif and is usually
done by a different person. This style of appliqué
has been enjoying a revival in recent years.
Consider yourself warned, however, that this
style isn’t really suitable for the beginning quil-
ter because of the dozens of tiny appliqué
pieces it features. Sure, it looks absolutely gor-
geous, but some appliqué experience is a
necessity! If you want to tackle an album-style
appliqué design, practice on projects with either
larger or fewer pieces and build your skills.

Whether you decide to go with hand or machine appliqué, the following
advice applies to both:
 First and foremost, you must select materials that are suitable for your
project. Because appliqué consists of layers of fabric — as many you
like, really — you don’t want to use any heavyweight fabrics. The heav-
ier the fabrics, the harder it is to stitch through them and the heavier
the final quilt is. Stick to the fabrics that are most suitable for other
quilt-making techniques, such as quilter’s cottons or other lighter-
weight fabrics (see Chapter 2 for details). You can add a bit of specialty
fabrics if you like, such as gold or silver lamé, but make sure they, too,
are lightweight and can be laundered in the same manner as the other
fabrics in your project.
 Before stitching any shapes to your background fabric, mark the back-
ground fabric to make sure you place your appliqués exactly where
you want them. To mark your background fabric, place the fabric over
the appliqué pattern, and trace the pattern lightly with a water-soluble
pencil or tailor’s chalk. These tracing lines will disappear when you
wash the project later.
 Before cutting any fabrics, figure out exactly how you’re going to
appliqué your pieces. Do you want to do traditional hand appliqué with
turned-under seam allowances? If so, you need to add seam allowances
to appliqué patterns that don’t already include them before you make
your first cut. If you want to use fusible webbing and machine appliqué
your pieces, you don’t need to add any seam allowances.
Doing Seams: Appliqués 
with Seam Allowances
Using appliqués with seam allowances gives your quilt a very polished, tradi-
tional look because the seam allowances are turned under and are hidden
away beneath the appliqué itself. The appliqués seem to float on the back-
ground fabric because the stitches that hold them in place are hidden as well.
This type of appliqué requires more time to produce than fusible webbing
appliqué (see “Look, Ma, No Seam Allowances! Fusible Machine Appliqué”
later in the chapter), but the results can be breathtaking!
In this type of appliqué, the seam allowances are 1⁄4 inch, just like every other
standard seam allowance in quilting. (You may notice that some quilting books
call for a mere 1⁄8-inch seam allowance. Don’t worry about that right now; build
your skills before you stitch appliqués with narrower seam allowances.) To
make an appliqué with a turned-under seam allowance, trace your appliqué tem-
plate onto the fabric of your choice. If the template includes seam allowances,
113
Chapter 10: Do You Know the Way to Appliqué?

cut out the shape along your marked line. If it doesn’t have a seam allowance,
cut out the shape 1⁄4 inch from your marked line.
You can tell if your template includes seam allowances simply by looking at it
(check out Figure 10-1). One solid line around the outside means no seam
allowance has been accounted for. A solid outside line with a dashed inside
line indicates that the seam allowance is included in the template.
Turning under the seam allowance
After tracing and cutting out appliqué shapes, you need to turn under the
seam allowance using one of the following methods:
 Turn-and-baste appliqué
 Freezer-paper appliqué
 Glue-stick appliqué
No matter what method you use, when turning under a seam allowance
around a curve, you need to cut slits in the seam allowance to make it lie flat.
Be sure not to cut beyond 1⁄4 inch, and make your slits approximately 1⁄4 inch
apart. For inverted points, notch out the point itself so that you can fold up
either side without the added bulk. When turning under the seam allowance
at a corner, turn up the point first and then turn up the seam allowances on
either side of the point. Figure 10-2 illustrates the slits required around the
curves and inverted point of a heart shape as well as the fold necessary to
create a clean corner.

Part III: Sharpening Your Sewing Skills 

Turn-and-baste appliqué
Turn-and-baste appliqué is very time-consuming but gives good results. After
tracing and cutting your appliqué shape with seam allowances,
1. Clip into the appliqué’s seam allowance around any curves or
inverted points.
2. Turn the seam allowance to the wrong side of the appliqué.
3. Secure the seam-allowance folds by basting them in place by hand.
To baste the seam allowance, follow these two simple steps:
1. Thread a needle (any kind) with a length of all-purpose thread 
(any color).
2. Stitch around the appliqué shape 1⁄8 inch from the folded edges in a
running stitch, which you can see in Figure 10-3.
After you baste the seam allowance around all the edges, the shape is ready
to be appliquéd.

Chapter 10: Do You Know the Way to Appliqué?

Freezer-paper appliqué
Freezer-paper appliqué is my favorite technique for appliqués with seam
allowances, which explains why it’s the method you’re instructed to use for
several of the projects in this book. In my humble opinion, freezer-paper
appliqué, sometimes known as English paper appliqué, is the best method to
use when preparing your pieces for machine or hand appliqué because you
gather the seam allowance of your appliqué around an inside shape, giving
you smooth, accurate results with very little fuss.
You can purchase freezer paper at any grocery store; it’s usually located on
the same aisle as aluminum foil and plastic wrap. Be sure to purchase freezer
paper that has wax on one side and plain paper on the other. The wax on the
freezer paper is what makes this technique work. Note: Don’t confuse freezer
paper with waxed paper. Freezer paper really is paper — it’s heavy, white, and
has a light wax coating on only one side, whereas waxed paper is transparent
and heavily waxed on both sides, making it unsuitable for this technique.
To use the freezer-paper appliqué technique, follow these steps:
1. Cut out your appliqué with seam allowances included, as you would
for turn-and-baste appliqué (see the preceding section).
2. Trace your appliqué pattern without seam allowances on the wax-free
side of the freezer paper, and cut out the shape.
3. Center the freezer paper shape on the wrong side of the fabric appliqué
shape, placing the waxy coating toward the fabric (see Figure 10-4a).
With an iron preheated to the cotton setting, press the freezer paper
shape to the appliqué fabric.
You only need to press long enough to melt the wax (don’t worry, you
won’t harm the fabric in any way).
4. Clip the curves and points of your seam allowance as you would for
turn-and-baste appliqué.
5. With a hand-sewing needle and thread that matches the appliqué
fabric, sew a running stitch around the seam allowance, pulling the
thread slightly to gather the seam allowance around the freezer paper
shape (see Figure 10-4b). Knot your thread at the end so the gathering
stitches don’t slip.
Figure 10-4c shows how it should look when you’ve finished sewing.
6. Press the appliqué with the freezer paper still inside.
The shape is now ready to be appliquéd.
116
Part III: Sharpening Your Sewing Skills 

Glue-stick appliqué
Glue-stick appliqué is similar to the freezer-paper method in that it uses a
form to provide shape. However, instead of freezer paper, you use plain white
paper (copier paper or computer paper works great) and use a glue stick to
secure the seam allowances directly to the paper.
Quilting and sewing supply stores sell glue sticks made for use on fabrics, but
the glue sticks you find in any office supply store work just as well. My favorite
is the UHU stick. It always gives me great results and washes out of my fabrics
thoroughly. (If the end of your glue stick feels a bit dry, cut off about 1⁄4 inch of
the glue with a knife and start fresh.)
To use the glue stick appliqué technique, follow these steps:
1. Cut out your fabric appliqué with seam allowances included. Clip the
seam allowance to accommodate any curves and points.
2. Trace your appliqué pattern without seam allowances onto a sheet of
plain paper, and cut out the shape.
3. Place a small amount of glue on the center of the back side of the
paper shape, and press the paper shape to the wrong side of the
appliqué fabric.
The glue holds the paper in place on the fabric as you fold over the
seam allowance.
4. Working in increments of 1⁄2- to 1-inch, apply a line of glue around the
edge of the paper shape (see Figure 10-5) and immediately press the
seam allowance onto the glue. Hold the fabric in place for a moment
until it stays of its own accord.

5. Continue adding glue to the edges of the paper and folding in the
seam allowance until all the fabric is glued down.
The shape is now ready to be appliquéd.
Hand stitching the appliqués
After you prepare your appliqué pieces, hand stitching is one option for
attaching them to the background fabric. Simply follow these steps:
1. Arrange your prepared appliqué pieces on the background fabric.
2. Pin, baste, or glue them in place to keep them from falling off or shift-
ing as you work.
If your design involves layering appliqués on top of one another, work
from the ground up: Secure the first layer of pieces that go directly on
the background fabric, and then start applying the pieces that overlap
your first layer, then your second layer, and so on (see Figure 10-6).
Because they’re only held in place at this point, you can remove overlap-
ping pieces temporarily to secure or adjust the ones underneath — just
be sure to put them back in the proper places.
3. Thread a needle (either a sharp or a between; see Chapter 2 for
details) with thread to match the color of the first appliqué.
4. Using the appliqué stitch, which leaves nearly invisible stitches, stitch
the edges of the appliqué to the background fabric. Secure your stitches
with a hidden knot when you’re finished.
See the sidebar “Mastering the appliqué stitch” later in this chapter for
instructions on executing the appliqué stitch.
5. If you’re using the turn-and-baste method, remove the basting stitches
after you stitch around the appliqué.

6. If you’re using the freezer-paper or glue-stick method,
1. Stitch around the shape, stopping within 3⁄4 inch of your starting
point.
2. Using tweezers or your fingers, pull the paper out through the
opening. The freezer paper should peel off the fabric very easily;
the glued paper may need a spritz of water to soften the glue
before removal.
3. After removing the paper, finish your appliqué stitching. Secure
your stitches with a hidden knot when you’re finished.
If you have many appliqués overlapping one another, reduce some of the bulk
before attempting to quilt it later! Flip over your piece so that you’re looking at
the wrong side of the background fabric, and trim away the background fabric
1⁄4 inch from the appliqué stitching, as shown in Figure 10-7. (You can use this
bulk-eliminating technique with both hand- and machine-stitched appliqués.)

Machine stitching the appliqués
If you would rather not hand stitch your appliqués, you can turn to your
trusty sewing machine. To machine appliqué the pieces in place on the back-
ground fabric, follow these steps:
1. Arrange the pieces on the background fabric, and pin or baste them
in place as you would if you were planning to hand stitch them (see
the preceding section).
Basting is the better choice because you can sew right over the stitches.
In contrast, it’s easy to get your presser foot or sewing thread hung-up
on pins.
2. Cut a piece of tear-away stabilizer to fit the appliqué area, and pin it
in place on the wrong side of the background fabric.
Stabilizer is essential to proper machine appliqué because it adds sup-
port to the fabric, preventing it from being shoved through the hole in
the machine’s throat plate while stitching. Be sure to use the stabilizer
120
Part III: Sharpening Your Sewing Skills 
Mastering the appliqué stitch
To work the appliqué stitch,
1. Bring your needle up from the back side of
the background fabric to the top side of the
appliqué, just barely grabbing the edge of
the appliqué.
2. Insert your needle back into the back-
ground fabric, just off the edge of the
appliqué, to make a stitch.
You will barely see this stitch if it’s close to
the edge of the appliqué (like 1⁄32-inch close!).
3. Bring your needle back up to the top side
of the quilt 3⁄32-inch further along the edge
of the appliqué.
4. Repeat Steps 2 and 3 around the entire
appliqué shape.
You’ll notice that you have some diagonal-look-
ing stitches on the wrong side of the block (just
like in Figure 10-7, where you see the back side
of an appliqué). These stitches are unavoidable
and mean that you’re doing the appliqué stitch
exactly right!

for all methods of machine appliqué, whether your pieces have seam
allowances or not. For more about stabilizer, see the sidebar, “Stabilizer:
How stable is it if you can tear it away?.”
3. Stitch around the edges of the appliqué pieces using either stitch type
described in the sections that follow.
Invisible machine appliqué
Invisible machine appliqué, also known as blind-stitch appliqué, mimics the
look of hand appliqué in that the stitches are virtually invisible — unless
you’re looking awfully hard for them. However, it takes a fraction of the time
to execute.
To use invisible machine appliqué,
1. Thread the top of your machine with nylon monofilment.
You can find this thread at any sewing, quilting, or fabric store. Use clear
monofilament for stitching over light- to medium-colored fabrics; use the
smoky-colored monofilament for stitching over darker fabrics.
Don’t substitute fishing line for monofilament even though it’s similar
and you think it could suffice! Fishing line is much heavier than monofil-
ment made for sewing and could damage your machine.
2. Load your bobbin with a neutral color of thread, preferably one that
matches your background fabric.
3. Set your machine to the blind-stitch (refer to your sewing machine
owner’s manual for instructions on setting a stitch).
You can see the blind-stitch in Figure 10-8; it consists of a length of
straight stitches followed by an inward zigzag.
121
Chapter 10: Do You Know the Way to Appliqué?
Stabilizer: How stable is it if you can tear it away?
A stabilizer is a nonwoven product made from
polyester that’s used to support the project as
you stitch. The stabilizer holds the project above
the sewing machine’s feed dogs (the teeth that
pull the fabric through the machine as the
presser foot sews), preventing the material from
being crammed through the machine’s throat
plate hole while you sew.
You can purchase stabilizer at any fabric store.
Different types are available for different uses,
but all the references in this book are for tear-
away stabilizer. When you go stabilizer shopping,
look for brands such as Tear-Away or Stitch and
Tear; be careful not to confuse tear-away stabi-
lizers with those that need to be washed out or
cut away after you finish stitching the appliqué.

4. Change your machine’s foot to one with an “open toe” (again, refer to
your manual for instructions on changing the foot).
An open-toe foot allows you to see where you’re going much better than
a standard foot, which is closed at the front.
5. Carefully stitch around each of the appliqué shapes, with the straight
stitch running only in the background fabric, just outside the edge of
the appliqué piece. The zigzag stitch should pick up the appliqué, as
shown in Figure 10-9.
Straight-stitch appliqué
Straight-stitch appliqué, also known as topstitch appliqué, is exactly as it
sounds: You stitch around the appliqué using the machine’s most basic
stitch. The only trick is that you must try to stitch as close to the edge as
you’re comfortable with so that the edges of your appliqués are secured and
not left flapping in the breeze (see Figure 10-10).

Part III: Sharpening Your Sewing Skills 

The distance between your stitching line and the edge of the appliqué piece
depends on your skill level and your bravery quotient. For some folks, 1⁄8 inch
from the edge is as good as it gets. Experienced sewers often topstitch so close
to the edge that it’s difficult to see if the stitches are on the appliqué at all!
Decorative machine stitches
Decorative machine stitches with a loose, open design, such as those in
Figure 10-11, are best suited to appliqués with turned-under seam allowances
because you have a clean edge to work with. (If you use these looser stitches
on appliqués that don’t have seam allowances (see the next section), you may
wind up with frayed fabric edges poking through your beautiful stitching!)
Look, Ma, No Seam Allowances! 
Fusible Machine Appliqué
Appliqué without seam allowances basically falls under the domain of fusible
machine appliqué. Why? Because sewing machine stitches and fusible web-
bing are the best tools for keeping the edges from fraying on appliqués that
don’t have turned-under seam allowances. And preventing fraying is impor-
tant if you expect your quilt to be used, loved, and laundered.
Another interesting product available for machine appliqué is the pressing
sheet, which is easy to use and allows for very accurate appliqué layouts.
Instead of fusing the pieces to background fabric, you fuse the pieces to the
pressing sheet by laying the transparent pressing sheet over your pattern
and ironing it. When all the pieces are in place, you lift the entire appliqué
off the pressing sheet (they aren’t permanently fused to this special sheet),
place the whole appliqué onto the background fabric, and fuse it in place as
one unit. Best of all, you can reuse the pressing sheet over and over again.

Chapter 10: Do You Know the Way to Appliqué?

Buying fusible transfer webbing
For fusible machine appliqué, you need to purchase fusible transfer webbing.
The instructions in this book call for fusible webbing that has a paper back-
ing on one side. This webbing is made by several different manufacturers and
even comes in different weights — standard, lightweight, and heavy-duty.
For machine appliqué quilting, stick to the standard weight fusible webbing.
It’s an all-purpose weight and is ideal for any fabrics you may be using. (The
lightweight variety is meant for sheer, lightweight fabrics and has considerable
flexibility. The heavy-duty weight is a bit stiff and is best suited to heavier
fabrics, such as denim or canvas.)
Webbing products are normally found in the section of the store containing
interfacing. Fusible webbing usually is sold by-the-yard or prepackaged in
varying sizes. (I prefer to buy it by the yard.) Some fusible webbing brand
names include WonderUnder, Stitch Witchery, HeatnBond, and Trans-Web.
Any brand will suffice. When in doubt, ask store personnel for advice —
that’s what they’re there for.
Don’t prewash fusible webbing (unless you want to ruin it), and when storing,
don’t fold it! Folding can sometimes cause the webbing material to separate
from the paper backing, rendering it almost useless. Instead, roll the webbing
up with the instruction insert it came with and secure it with a rubber band.
Preparing for machine appliqué
When using fusible webbing for seam allowance–less machine appliqué, you
need to prepare your pattern template differently than you would for hand
appliqué work. Follow the instructions in this section carefully, or you’ll find
yourself with everything facing the wrong direction.
Because it looks very different — and very wrong — when reversed, I use the
letter “Q” as an appliqué shape example throughout the figures in this sec-
tion. To create an appliqué shape with fusible webbing attached, follow these
instructions:
1. Trace the appliqué pattern onto tracing paper. Mark the side with the
traced shape “RS” (right side). Turn the paper over, and mark the
other side “WS” (wrong side), as shown in Figure 10-12.
I know seeing writing on the opposite side of the paper backward is
annoying, but you’ll get used to it.
124
Part III: Sharpening Your Sewing Skills 

2. Place the traced pattern on your work surface RS down (or WS up
depending on which way you look at the world). Tape the paper down
to your work surface along the top and bottom edges.
3. Place your fusible webbing over the pattern with the paper side up
(facing you). See Figure 10-13.
The webbing is nearly transparent, so you can easily see the pattern
through it.
4. With a regular pencil, trace the pattern onto the paper side of the
fusible webbing.
5. Cut out the shape roughly, as shown in Figure 10-14.
At this point, cutting shapes perfectly along the lines is just a waste of time
because you cut out the shapes neatly after fusing them to the fabrics.

6. Lay your appliqué fabric right side down on an ironing board or 
iron-safe work surface. Position the fusible webbing shape on the
wrong side of the appliqué fabric, having the webbing (rough) side
toward the fabric and the paper facing upward, toward you.
7. Use a hot iron to fuse the shape to the appliqué fabric.
For iron settings, refer to the manufacturer’s insert that accompanies
the webbing you’re using.
8. Cut out the shape neatly.
Don’t worry; the image is supposed to be reversed.
9. Remove the paper backing from the appliqué by peeling it away,
exposing the adhesive that has been fused to the wrong side of the
fabric.
10. Place the appliqué glue side down on the background fabric.
Tada! Your shape is now facing the right direction!
11. Following the webbing manufacturer’s directions, use a hot iron to
fuse the appliqué to the background fabric (see Figure 10-15). Use an
up-and-down pressing motion instead of sliding the iron, which could
cause your appliqué to shift.
The hot iron melts the glue on the webbing and adheres it to the back-
ground fabric, holding the appliqué in place for you. No pins required!

12. Cut a piece of tear-away stabilizer the same size as the background
fabric, and pin the stabilizer to the wrong side of the background
fabric at the corners.
For information about this stabilizer, check out the sidebar “Stabilizer:
How stable is it if you can tear it away?” earlier in this chapter.
With your appliqué firmly attached to the background fabric, it’s ready to be
finished using one of the machine-appliqué stitches described in the follow-
ing section.
Stitching it all in place
After you fuse your appliqués to the background fabric (see the preceding
section), it’s time to take them to the machine and stitch everything in place.
You have a number of different machine stitching options at this point,
depending on the look you want to achieve. Do you want a sleek, smooth
look? If so, satin stitch is the way to go. Prefer something a little more casual
or rustic? Try zigzag appliqué (see the sidebar “Loosen up with zigzag
appliqué”) or blanket stitch. You can even peruse your machine’s owner’s
manual for preprogrammed decorative stitches.
Satin stitch
Everybody loves satin stitch! It looks gorgeous and can be stitched in different
widths depending on preference. This stitch is composed of zigzag stitches
spaced very close together — so close that you’re unable to see the fabric
through the thread. Completely enclosing the raw edges of the appliqué
under a barrier of thread make the appliqué very durable.
Satin stitching requires your machine to be in good working condition. To 
set your machine for satin stitching, refer to the owner’s manual. Beginners
should start with a stitch width of 1⁄8 to 1⁄4 inch. Anything narrower can be a bit
difficult to handle and requires more experience. The knob for stitch width
controls the width of the satin stitch, and the knob for stitch length controls
the density of the satin stitch (how closely spaced the stitches are).
Before you tackle satin stitching around your quilt appliqués, test sew a line
of satin stitching on a scrap of fabric with another scrap of fabric fused to
the center of it. This test allows you to make sure that your stitch width and
density is just right and gives you a chance to practice your technique if nec-
essary. To test your satin stitch settings:
1. Load the top of the machine with a dark color thread.
2. Wind a lighter color thread in the bobbin.
127
Chapter 10: Do You Know the Way to Appliqué?

3. Change your machine’s presser foot to one with an open toe.
An open-toe foot differs from a closed-toe foot in that the front area of
the foot is cut away (see Figure 10-16). Using an open-toe foot allows you
to see where you’re stitching much better than a closed-toe foot.
4. Using scrap fabric, sew around your test shape.
When you’re done with your test, examine the satin stitching on your scrap
fabric, and ask yourself the following questions:
 Is the stitching nice and even? Do the stitches cover the edges of the
appliqués, or are there gaps? Does the stitching need to be denser, or
should it be less dense?
If you can see the edges of the fused fabric through the line of satin
stitching, the stitching should be denser, and you need to shorten the
length of the stitch. If the satin stitching bunches up on itself, increase
the length of the stitch.
 Looking closely at the ridge of satin stitching, can you see any of the
light-colored bobbin thread on the surface?
If the bobbin thread is visible, you need to loosen the upper tension on
your machine very slightly. Test sew again, and check the stitch quality
for improvement. If you continue to see the bobbin thread, keep loosen-
ing the tension in small increments until no bobbin thread appears on
the surface. If this adjustment doesn’t work, you may need to increase the
tension of the bobbin thread (see Chapter 8 for additional instructions
on proper tension settings). If nothing works to eliminate visible bobbin
thread on the surface of your stitching, have your machine profession-
ally serviced.

128
Part III: Sharpening Your Sewing Skills 

When you’re satisfied that your satin stitch is perfect, it’s time to sew the
appliqués in place:
1. Replace the upper thread with whichever thread you want to be visi-
ble on your quilt top. Use a neutral thread in the bobbin.
2. Place your project under the open-toe presser foot, and gradually
lower the needle, stopping before it enters the fabric.
3. As the needle approaches the fabric, note whether the needle is posi-
tioned to the left or to the right (because the satin stitch is a zigzag, the
needle moves back and forth from left to right).
• If the needle is to the left, position your project so that the needle
enters the appliqué fabric.
• If the needle is to the right, position your fabric so that the needle
enters the background fabric.
4. Stitch around the edges of all appliqués shapes, having the left swing
(zig) of the needle in the appliqué and the right swing (zag) in the
background fabric.
Many beginning quilters complain that their satin stitches are bumpy and
uneven. Following a few simple instructions can help you avoid these prob-
lems. Most important is to use a bit of caution when you approach a corner
or curve or when you’re stitching along a point. The following list addresses
these tricky areas:
 To stitch inside corners, stitch beyond the corner as far as the stitch is
wide, and leave the needle in the fabric at the left-swing position, as indi-
cated by the dot on Figure 10-17. Raise the presser foot, and turn the fabric
so that you can stitch along the next side of the corner. Lower the presser
foot, and continue stitching. Your stitches should overlap at the corner.
Figure 10-17:
Turning an
inside
corner.
129
Chapter 10: Do You Know the Way to Appliqué?

 To stitch outside corners, stitch to the end of the appliqué, and leave
the needle in the fabric at the right-swing position, as indicated by the
dot in Figure 10-18. Raise the presser foot, and turn the fabric so you can
stitch along the next side of the corner. Lower the presser foot, and con-
tinue stitching. Your stitches should overlap at the corner.
 To stitch around curves smoothly, pivot the fabric as you sew. If you’re
stitching along an inside curve (see Figure 10-19a), leave the needle in
the appliqué piece, which should be the left swing of the needle. If
you’re stitching along an outside curve (see Figure 10-19b), leave the
needle in the background fabric, which should be the right swing of the
needle. Raise the presser foot, and turn the fabric just slightly so that
your stitching will follow the appliqué edge. Lower the presser foot, and
continue stitching. Repeat until you’ve stitched along the entire curve.
The number of times you need to pivot depends on the curve: A slight
curve needs fewer pivots than a tight one.

 To stitch along a sharp point, gradually decrease the width of the satin
stitch as the point narrows, as shown in Figure 10-20. When you reach
the point, leave the needle in the fabric, raise the presser foot, and pivot
your fabric so that your stitches continue along the opposite side of the
point. Increase the stitch width as you move away from the point.
When you finish satin stitching the appliqués, remove the pins holding the
stabilizer in place. Tear the stabilizer from the back side of the project; it
should tear away easily. Be sure to remove all the stabilizer because anything
left on the back of the block could show on the front side.
Use a tweezers to pull off any small bits of stabilizer that are too tiny to grasp
with your fingers.
Machine blanket stitch
The machine blanket stitch, also known as the buttonhole stitch, closely mocks
the hand blanket stitch but is so much quicker! This stitch gives appliqué
projects a primitive look that today’s quilters love. It’s composed of multiple
vertical stitches followed by one horizontal stitch. The machine blanket stitch
is terrific for rustic or country-style appliqués because it gives the look of a
hand stitch without the hassle. (If you want to attempt the machine blanket
stitch by hand, check out the sidebar “Blanket stitch on the go.”)

Chapter 10: Do You Know the Way to Appliqué?
Loosen up with zigzag appliqué
Zigzag appliqué is the lazy quilter’s version of
satin stitch, which I discuss in the “Satin stitch”
section. I’m not afraid to admit that I like being
lazy at times, so I’m fond of the zigzag appliqué
stitch.
Zigzag appliqué tends to have a fun and relaxed
look to it, so you can load your machine with
whatever thread you choose (all-purpose,
monofilament, or buttonhole-twist) in any color
you want (matching or clashing with your quilt
design). With your threads in place, simply
stitch around the edges of the appliqué shape
in a loose zigzag.

Note: Blanket stitch can be done in any color thread, but the most commonly
used color is black. Therefore, my instructions in this section only refer to
black thread. If you choose to use a different color, simply substitute it for
the black when you read the following steps. (A real no-brainer tip, eh?)
To blanket stitch your appliqués, follow these steps:
1. After fusing your appliqués in place and backing them with stabilizer
(see “Preparing for machine appliqué” earlier in the chapter), set your
machine to the blanket stitch (refer to your owner’s manual), and
make sure that you have an open-toe presser foot on your machine.
2. Load your bobbin with black all-purpose thread. For the top thread, you
have two options: all-purpose thread or buttonhole twist (topstitching)
thread.
Some quilters use the buttonhole twist because they prefer a heavier
thread on the edges of their appliqués. Others use all-purpose, which is
a bit lighter in appearance. (For a complete rundown of threads, see
Chapter 2.)
3. Test sew the blanket stitch on a piece of scrap fabric to make sure you
get a good, solid stitch.
If the blanket stitch looks ragged or has skipped stitches, refer to your
owner’s manual and Chapter 9 for tips on adjusting your machine’s 
tension.
4. When your stitch looks perfect, stitch around the edges of your
appliqués.
The straight-stitch edge of the blanket stitch should be in the ditch,
which means right where the appliqué meets the background fabric.
The long “legs” of the stitch should extend into the appliqué itself, as
shown in Figure 10-21.
Turning corners and stitching around points can be a matter of trial and error
with this method of appliqué. Try to get one of the blanket stitch “legs” situ-
ated in the corner or point, as shown in Figure 10-22. Keep in mind that the
blanket stitch is supposed to be a “primitive-looking” type of appliqué, and
perfection isn’t necessary.

Chapter 10: Do You Know the Way to Appliqué?
Blanket stitch on the go
After fusing appliqués in place, you may want to
forgo the sewing machine and tackle the blan-
ket stitch by hand. The blanket stitch is an easy
stitch to do by hand, and because you aren’t
relying on a sewing machine, you can carry
your work with you and make progress as you
wait in doctors’ offices or at soccer practices.
When blanket stitching by hand, you don’t need
to use stabilizer — it just gets in your way.
Instead of all-purpose or buttonhole twist
thread, use black pearl cotton or two strands of
embroidery floss in a large-eyed needle to
appliqué the pieces in place. These heavy
threads give a nice rustic look to your handwork.
To execute the hand-embroidered blanket
stitch, follow these instructions:
1. Bring your needle up through the underside
of the foundation fabric along the outside
edge of the appliqué piece.
2. Insert the needle into the appliqué fabric
about 1⁄8 inch in from the edge of the
appliqué and 1⁄8 inch to the right, at a diag-
onal from your entry point in Step 1.
3. Bring your needle up through the underside
of the foundation fabric, at the very edge of
the appliqué piece, as in Step 1, but this
time, stop the needle partway through and
loop the thread behind the needle to catch
it in the stitch. Proceed pulling the needle
through the top side of the fabric.
4. Repeat all the way around the appliqué.

Decorative machine stitches
Does your machine have tons of neat decorative stitches that you’ve never
used? Here’s your chance: Use them for appliqué!
Some of the denser, tighter stitches, such as those shown in Figure 10-23, can
be used on fused appliqués. Simply substitute them for the satin stitch or
machine blanket stitch that I cover in the preceding sections.
The Scrappy Pines Lap or Nap Quilt project in Chapter 17 is a great opportu-
nity to use decorative stitches.
Don’t be afraid to experiment with your machine’s stitch repertoire on scraps
of fabric, and let your creative juices flow!

The Plan of Attack: Deciding 
How to Quilt Your Quilt
In This Chapter
 Deciding on hand or machine quilting
 Figuring out the right quilting intervals
 Getting creative with stitching patterns
A
fter you cut and stitch the pieces of your quilt top, you’re ready to quilt
your quilt. “What,” you say, “what have I been doing up to now? I thought
I was quilting.” Well, you’re right . . . in a way. You’ve been piecing and/or
appliquéing a quilt, but you don’t really have a quilt until you assemble the
three sandwich layers into one cozy project, and that’s where the real quilt-
ing begins.
In this chapter, I guide you through all the ins and outs (a little needle-humor
there) of quilting your project, including outline and echo quilting, decorative
quilting designs, and how to use quilting templates to really make your proj-
ect pop.
Machine versus Hand Quilting
As with piecing your quilt, you have the choice of hand stitching or machine
stitching in the quilting stage. But before you decide on a method, you need
to think about what your project will be used for: Will it get much use and
regular washing, such as a baby’s bib? Is it for looks rather than function,
such as a wall hanging or a holiday vest? Also important to consider is
whether you want to finish this project in a hurry or take your sweet time:
 Machine quilting is quick — really quick. However, it can sometimes
have a less-than-heirloom look, and your skill level may not allow you to
create intricate quilting designs by machine.

 Hand quilting is slow — really slow. But for the beginning quilter, 
decorative quilting patterns are best worked by hand because you
have complete control. Hand quilting is much easier to pick up on
than machine quilting.
I’m a machine queen. I prefer to hand quilt only when I’m working on some-
thing I consider “heirloom quality,” and by that I mean a project I’m going to
give to someone as a gift or a quilt I’m making to commemorate a special
event. Nothing shows you care quite like something you’ve put extra time
and effort into. Your choice of technique, however, is totally up to you.
Considering Spacing
Although both hand and machine quilting are suitable for any project, the
spacing of the quilting isn’t always so universal; you need to consider the 
batting manufacturer’s recommended quilting intervals when making your
decision to hand or machine quilt. The batting you choose for your project
helps you determine how to quilt your quilt.
If you have the opportunity to look closely at antique quilts, you’ll notice that
the quilting is very closely spaced. This spacing keeps the batting’s cotton
fibers from migrating into corners and creating lumpy pockets.
Fiber migration is common in most battings — even those that claim it won’t
be a problem. In reality, any fiber batting can migrate if not quilted and laun-
dered properly. The quilting stitches that you set are what keep the three
layers of your quilt functioning together as one unit. The denser the quilting
(the closer your stitches are to one another), the better the quilted item per-
forms as a wall hanging, bedcovering, place mat, or whatever you intend.
For example, if you’re making a quilted vest that you know you’ll love to wear
and therefore wash often, space your quilting intervals close together. The
more an item is washed, the more you risk having the fibers migrate into
pockets, so your close stitching intervals will help hold the batting in place.
Today, you can quilt at wider intervals than quilters past without ending up
with a lumpy mess, but you still must keep the manufacturer-recommended
intervals in mind when deciding how to quilt your project. Be sure to read
batting packages carefully before making a selection that fits your quilting
design plan (refer to Chapter 3 for the full scoop on batting).
138
Part IV: Ahead to the Finish: Quilting the Pieces in Place

Choosing a Stitching Pattern
When it comes to choosing quilting-stitch patterns, you have a wide range of
options (and you can even invent your own!). In this section, I cover the most
popular designs.
Outline quilting to enhance shapes
By far the most popular method of quilting is to enhance the shapes of the
patchwork or appliqué with some type of outline quilting (see Figure 11-1).
Outline quilting can be either:
 In-the-ditch: This type of quilting is characterized by stitching very 
near — almost on top of — the seams in a patchwork block. Its name
comes from the fact that the seam areas form a sort of ditch that’s 
very easy to follow.
In-the-ditch quilting is a good choice for machine quilting but can be dif-
ficult to hand stitch because of the multiple layers present in a seam.
When hand quilting, do your in-the-ditch stitching on the side of the
seam that has the least amount of bulk.
 Quarter-inch: This type of quilting is characterized by stitching 1⁄4 inch
from the seam line on each piece of your quilt top. This technique is also
referred to as echo quilting because the stitching echoes the shape of the
piece, like ripples on the surface of water. I talk more about echo quilting
in the “Free-style fillers” section later in this chapter.
Quarter-inch quilting is best suited for hand quilting (and especially begin-
ners) because it steers clear of the multiple layers in seam allowances.
This type of quilting can be done on a machine but requires a bit of experi-
ence to get it right because it’s a free-motion stitch, which means that the
feed dogs are disengaged and you must guide the quilt by hand.
When outline quilting an appliqué piece, you can space your stitches very
close to the shape of the appliqué, much like in-the-ditch quilting. You can
then use the filler stitches described in the next section to fill in the outside
areas of the block or continue to echo the shape of the appliqué until you fill
the entire area.
Filler patterns for quilting large areas
Filler patterns are useful for quilting large areas in which you don’t have a par-
ticular shape to stitch around. The quilting designs explained in this section
are suitable for both hand and machine quilting and are easy to stitch. You
can use these patterns on your entire quilt or just in areas where you need to
fill a large amount of background. The choice is yours.
139
Chapter 11: The Plan of Attack: Deciding How to Quilt Your Quilt

Cross-hatch quilting
Cross-hatch quilting, also known as grid quilting, is one of the most common
and traditional-looking filler options. Cross-hatch quilting is quick and textu-
rally interesting.
To prepare your quilt top for this pattern without marking it with a pen or
pencil, you need to first baste the quilt layers together, either with large
stitches or safety pins (see Chapter 12 for details on basting). Then follow
these steps:
1. Decide how far apart you want the lines.
1⁄2- or 1-inch intervals are the norm no matter what type of batting
you use
2. Visit your local hardware, art supply, or quilting supply store to pur-
chase a roll of masking tape the width you need (if you don’t already
have some on hand).
I’m not kidding; masking tape works beautifully and is so accurate! Plus,
one roll lasts a while because you can reuse the strips. Masking tape is
available in widths as narrow as 1⁄8 inch and 1⁄4 inch and goes as wide as 
1⁄2 inch, 1 inch, 11⁄2 inches, and even 2 inches!
3. Lay a strip of tape 12 inches or so in length on your basted quilt at a
45-degree angle to the sides of the quilt (see Figure 11-2).
Figure 11-1:

distracting
to the eye.
140
Part IV: Ahead to the Finish: Quilting the Pieces in Place

With your tape in place, you either hand or machine quilt along its edges, and
the tape does the spacing for you. You don’t need to end your stitching just
because you get to the end of the tape; simply lift the tape, move it to the
next spot, and continue stitching. You can peel off the masking tape and
move it as many times as you need to, but when it starts to lose its stickiness,
discard it and tear another strip off the roll.
Diamond quilting
A variation on cross-hatch quilting is diamond quilting, which is shown in
Figure 11-3. For this quilting style, you stretch your rows so that they inter-
sect at a different angle to create diamonds instead of squares.
You can create a diamond quilting design using the masking tape method
described in the preceding section. Instead of placing the tape at a 45-degree
angle to the sides of the quilt, place it at a 30-degree angle.

Chapter 11: The Plan of Attack: Deciding How to Quilt Your Quilt

Using masking tape to mark your quilting designs opens up a host of options
besides cross-hatch and diamond quilting. You can play around with the tape
layout to create other fun variations. Use the examples in Figure 11-4 for
inspiration!
Clamshell quilting
Clamshell quilting is an easy-to-stitch filler that requires premarking before
you baste together the layers of your quilt. (See Chapter 12 for basting 
techniques.)
To mark your quilt top with a clamshell design, follow these steps:
1. Using a compass, draw a circle on a piece of cardboard and cut it out.
Although the circle can be any size, 3 to 4 inches in diameter suits most
quilt battings.
2. Mark a line through the center of the circle across the diameter. Mark
another line vertically through the radius only.
These lines act as guides when tracing around the template onto your
fabric. By lining up the horizontal line each with the halfway mark on
each circle and matching the vertical line with the converging point of
two half circles, you’ll be able to make very accurate clamshells in a
straight line. (When in doubt, use a piece of masking tape to mark the
horizontal target.)
3. Trace the top half of the template on the fabric. Work your way across
the row, then move down a row and continue tracing, staggering the
placement of the template as shown in Figure 11-5a.
Clamshells only use half the circle, making them clams on the half shell!
Figure 11-4:

142
Part IV: Ahead to the Finish: Quilting the Pieces in Place

A variation on the clamshell design is called orange peel quilting. To create
these intersecting circles (see Figure 11-5b), use the same template as for
clamshell quilting, but instead of tracing around only the top half of the
circle, trace around the entire circle. Stagger each row as you would for the
clamshell, using the circle’s markings as a guide for positioning the template
halfway intersecting the circles of the previous row.
Free-style fillers
Free-style fillers are a bit more complicated than geometric cross-hatch, dia-
mond, and clamshell fillers, but they’re well worth the extra effort. Instead of
following a specific grid or pattern, you cut loose and do whatever feels good!
Although free-style fillers take a bit of time to master, you’re beautifully
rewarded for your efforts and dedication!
Two of the most popular free-style fillers are:
 Echo quilting, which consists of multiple lines of quilting stitches that
run parallel to the edges of any shape, echoing the shape. This type of
quilting is rarely premarked, so you need a bit of practice to get your
lines evenly spaced in 1⁄4-inch intervals. You can premark the lines if you
wish, but it takes quite a bit of time and really isn’t necessary. If the lines
aren’t perfectly spaced at 1⁄4 inch, you really won’t notice because the
overall effect is quite casual and relaxed. (For more on echo quilting, see
the section “Outline quilting to enhance shapes” earlier in this chapter.)
 Stipple quilting, which is characterized by a wandering line that wiggles
and winds back on itself. Stipple quilting, which you can see in Figure 11-6,
takes some time to master by hand, but it’s a breeze to do on the machine.
Because of the concentrated stitches, this style of quilting essentially flat-
tens areas where it’s used. Stipple quilting is most commonly used in
appliqué blocks because this flattening effect enables the appliqués to
stand out nicely, giving them a puffy look.

Decorative quilting patterns and stencils
For intricate and artistic quilting options, consider using decorative quilting
patterns and stencils. You can find decorative patterns in books specializing
in quilting designs, and you can pick up precut stencils at quilting and fabric
shops. Decorative quilting patterns and stencils are available in many 
designs — florals, geometrics, meandering vines, feathers, and more — 
in both traditional and contemporary styles.
Decorative quilting patterns and stencils come in two types: those used in
blocks and those intended for borders (see Figure 11-7). Patterns and stencils
are often available in matched sets so you can create a coordinated look.

Part IV: Ahead to the Finish: Quilting the Pieces in Place

To mark your quilt top with a decorative quilting design from a book, you
need to trace the design onto a piece of paper and then transfer the design to
your fabric. To transfer a design, you may be able to trace it directly onto the
fabric or you may need to use a light box or carbon paper. (For guidance on
these methods, see Chapter 12.)
Quilting stencils aren’t the same stencils sold for painting decorative borders
on your walls; quilting stencils are specially cut templates intended for quilt-
ing. They have narrow slits cut into them so that you can trace the design
onto your quilt top by running your marking pencil through the slits to mark
the lines, as shown in Figure 11-8.

Assembling the Quilt Sandwich
In This Chapter
 Marking your quilting design
 Layering your quilt
 Handling bed-size quilts
G
ood going, quilter! With a completed quilt top, you’re ready to layer it
with batting and backing fabric to assemble your sandwich and prepare
it for quilting. A finished quilt is finally visible on the horizon!
Keep in mind that before you can assemble the sandwich, you have to answer
the following questions:
 How do you want to quilt your quilt? You want a sturdy and decorative
stitch pattern for your quilt top and back, but you have a lot of options.
You may have already chosen a nice design such as a floral border or a
geometric block design. If not, refer to Chapter 11 for inspiration and
advice about settling on a design.
 Are you quilting by hand or by machine? Each option has its advan-
tages and disadvantages. See Chapter 11 for issues to consider when
making this decision, including the size of your project.
Some designs need to be marked on a quilt top before assembly, so in this
chapter, I explain how to do this marking. Then I walk you through the steps
of assembling the layers of the quilt and basting them together so that noth-
ing shifts during quilting and handling.
Marking Your Quilting Stitch Designs
Transferring your quilting designs to your quilt top isn’t as difficult as it
sounds, and you have a number of options for getting your chosen designs
onto the quilt and ready to go. For the sake of simplicity, in this section I
cover the most common techniques.

If you’re planning to stitch (this is the REAL quilting!) a decorative motif or
border, always mark the quilting design on your quilt top before you assemble
the quilt sandwich. After the sandwich is assembled, adding designs is a lot
trickier due to the bulk of it all. And be sure that you use only a water-soluble
marking pencil or chalk when marking the design. Always test your marking
pencil to make certain it will wash out, regardless of color or what the pack-
age says.
I recommend marking your entire quilt top before layering the quilt sand-
wich. To mark your quilting stitches, you can
 Trace the design. If your fabric is light in color and the design has nice
dark lines, you may be able to transfer the design directly from its
source by laying the fabric on the design and tracing it.
 Use a light box. Tape the design to a light box, and then place the quilt
top over the design. To hold the quilt top in place while you trace, either
tape it or hold it if you can.
 Use dressmakers’ carbon paper. This type of carbon paper comes in
many colors to a package. To mark your quilt top, select the lightest
color that shows up on your fabric. To transfer the design, pin the dress-
makers’ carbon facedown over your quilt. Center the design to be
quilted over the carbon, and transfer it to the quilt top by tracing over
the design with a regular pencil, peeking a bit along the way to make
sure it transfers properly.
Before you use carbon paper to mark up your whole quilt top, test it on
a scrap of fabric to be absolutely certain it will wash out of your finished
quilt. Also, stay away from heat transfer paper, which becomes perma-
nent as soon as you iron the design on the fabric!
 Make a template. If you’re using a simple design such as a heart or leaf
and only want to outline the shape, cut the design from lightweight card-
board or heavy paper (an old file folder works great). Place the cutout
on your quilt top, and hold it in place with one hand while tracing around
it with the other. Trace designs from purchased quilting templates in the
same manner.
If you plan on quilting along seam lines, around the shapes in your quilt top,
or in a grid pattern, marking your quilting lines isn’t necessary because you
can simply following the seam or shape or use masking tape as a grid line
guide (check out Chapters 11 and 13 for more discussion of these designs
and techniques.)
148
Part IV: Ahead to the Finish: Quilting the Pieces in Place 

Pulling Together Top, Batt, 
and Back Layers
When you finish marking your quilting designs, you’re ready to layer the quilt
top with the batting and backing to create your quilt sandwich. Yum! After
layering comes basting, which holds all the layers together while you quilt.
Assembling the quilt layers
To assemble the three layers of your quilt, follow these steps:
1. Lay out your backing fabric on a flat work surface so that the wrong
side of the fabric is facing you.
Your flat work surface can be a table (just be sure to protect the surface
of a wooden table before you start pinning) or the floor (see the section
“Taming the Bed-size Beast” later in this chapter).
2. Center the quilt batting over the backing fabric.
3. Carefully center the quilt top over the batting.
Basting the layers together
With your layers laid out neatly, it’s time to baste. Basting is simply using some
method hold the layers together. Depending on the size of your project and
the method by which you plan to quilt (hand or machine), you can choose
from either thread basting or pin basting, both of which I explain in this sec-
tion. (When you finish basting, the sandwich is ready for you to quilt by hand
or machine. In Chapter 13, I present tips to help you successfully navigate the
final quilting process.)
Thread basting
Thread basting involves large, loose stitches. After your quilting is complete,
you remove the basting stitches, so don’t worry about what they look like.
This method is best used when you plan to hand quilt your project because
there are no pins to interfere with placing the item in a hoop or quilt stand.
To thread baste your quilt, follow these steps:
1. Thread a large, general-purpose sewing needle with a length of thread
(any color is fine) no longer than your arm.
149
Chapter 12: Assembling the Quilt Sandwich

2. Put a knot in the far end of the thread.
3. Starting at the center of the quilt, insert the needle (either from the
front or the back) at an angle through all three layers.
4. Pull the first stitch through somewhat, and bring the needle back
through the fabric about 1 inch away from where you started.
5. Continue basting in this manner, making big running stitches through
all three layers of the quilt top.
6. When you reach the edge of the quilt, clip your thread and start over
at the center of the quilt.
Basting outwards from the center keeps the layers nice and flat and
helps avoid bunching in the batting and puckering in the backing
fabric or quilt top.
When you run out of thread, leave a 1⁄2-inch tail and clip it off. (You can use
these tails to pull out the basting stitches later.) Then rethread your needle
and continue basting.
When you reach the end of a length of thread, cut off the knot at your starting
point so you don’t stitch over it later. Don’t worry about the basting threads
working their way out of their stitches — they won’t.
Your fully basted quilt should resemble Figure 12-1.
Pin basting
Pin basting uses safety pins, usually nickel-plated ones because they don’t
rust if they get a bit moist, to hold the quilt layers in place. This is my pre-
ferred method of basting for machine quilting because I can remove the pins
before they approach the needle, leaving me with nothing that needs pulled
out after quilting is finished. Pin basting is best for small- to medium-size
projects because the pins add a bit of weight as you work.
As you pin baste, be sure to pin from the center outward and through all three
layers of the sandwich, as you would if you were thread basting (see the preced-
ing section). Space the pins 3 to 4 inches apart for best results — any closer
together and they just get in the way.
Be sure to remove each pin before stitching over it with your machine;
Jumping over pins with your machine can break the needle and put your 
eye out!
150
Part IV: Ahead to the Finish: Quilting the Pieces in Place 

Taming the Bed-size Beast
Although thread or pin basting small- to medium-size quilts is simple enough
to do on a table or other work surface, working with quilts of bed-size propor-
tions can be a challenge.
The solution? Make use of that big flat surface under your feet — whether it’s
carpeted or not. Tape the beast to the floor — yet another use for the ever-
helpful masking tape tucked into your sewing basket. Kneepads aren’t bad
to have on hand either, considering you’ll be crawling around on the floor —
if you’ve got some lying around from your rollerblading phase, use them!
Make sure you have a clean floor by sweeping or vacuuming before laying out
the quilt (trust me when I say that batting is a magnet for every fuzz bunny,
bit of dirt, speck of lint, or mystery gunk on the floor). When your floor’s
clean, follow these steps:
Masking tape

like this.
151
Chapter 12: Assembling the Quilt Sandwich

1. Tape the backing to the floor first, with the right side of the backing
fabric facing the floor and the wrong side facing you. Tape the cor-
ners to the floor first, stretching the fabric slightly to smooth any
wrinkles or creases. Then tape the sides in place.
2. Lay the batting over the backing, and tape it in the same manner.
3. Center the quilt top over the batting and tape it to the floor.
Don’t be shy with the tape! Use as much as it takes to make everything
smooth and secure. You don’t want the sandwich coming loose when you
start basting. (And unless you have a dog that loves to shed like mine, you
can reuse the tape.)
After taping, your quilt sandwich should look something like Figure 12-1. 
Hey, it’s weird, but it works. After you’re finished taping, you can baste the
quilt using the thread-basting method I describe in the “Basting the layers
together” section earlier in this chapter. Be sure to use a large needle to 
make sure you get through all the layers. Although this method seems tricky,
it works very well, and you will know when you’re through those layers —

M
y goodness, what a long way you’ve come! If you’re reading this chap-
ter, you’re either curious about the quilting stage (nothing wrong with
peeking ahead — keep peeking!), or you’re actually ready for the quilting
stage of the quilt-making process. If you fit into the latter category, I’m assum-
ing that you’ve pieced and/or appliquéd your quilt top, selected your batting,
and basted the whole shebang together. I also assume that you’ve selected
your quilting patterns, if any (if you’re stumped, see Chapter 11), and marked
them on your quilt top. What a long way you’ve come; now you’re poised and
rip-roarin’ ready for the quilting!
Over many years of quilt making, I’ve found that the actual quilting process
is the most rewarding part of quilt making. Not only do I get a rush seeing
everything taking shape, but the project starts to look like a real honest-to-
gosh quilt. And it’s almost finished!
In this chapter, I introduce you to your quilting options: hand quilting,
machine quilting, and tying. I walk you through the basic steps for each tech-
nique and give you a few options for mixing things up a bit and having fun
with this stage of the quilt-making process.

154
Part IV: Ahead to the Finish: Quilting the Pieces in Place
Introducing the Quilting Stage 
and Your Options
A quilt just isn’t a quilt until it’s quilted. Confused? The layering of quilt top, a
fluffy interior, and backing and securing those layers with some manner of
stitch are what truly defines a quilt.
When you get your project to the point at which it’s ready to be quilted, you
have a few choices to consider depending on the time you have available for
quilting and the look you want the finished quilt to have. Basically, there are two
ways to quilt a quilt: by hand or by machine. Each method has its variations,
both functional and artistic, with pattern options from simple to sublime and
everything in between. Hand quilting is the traditional method and gives a
wonderful, textured look to the finished quilt, while machine quilting is a bit
more orderly-looking. But both are beautiful and durable.
If you want to quilt a project on-the-go, say on vacation or while commuting,
you definitely should stick to small projects and hand quilting (dragging a
sewing machine around with you isn’t very practical). On the other hand, if
you have a large quilt that you’d like to finish quickly, machine quilting is just
the ticket.
Of course, I hope you at least take a stab at quilting your own projects, but if
you don’t want to do the quilting yourself (some folks are solely quilt-top-divas,
others are quilting aficionados), you can pay to have your quilt machine-
quilted. Most quilting supply stores either offer this service or can direct you
to someone who does. For a fee that’s dependent on the size of the quilt and
the style of quilting, skilled machine quilters quilt your project using a long-arm
quilting machine (you can see these machines set up in most quilting stores).
The machine travels along rails upon which the quilt is rolled and has a very
long body, allowing large quilts to be passed through it with ease. A skilled
long-arm quilter can turn out some very intricate designs, and they’re usually
more than happy to show off their quilt pattern repertoire if you ask.
Hooping It Up with Hand Quilting
If you choose to quilt the old-fashioned way, by hand, good for you — the
ghosts of quilters past are very proud! And the meticulous hand quilters of
the present honor you as well!
This section guides you through a simple process for hand quilting your proj-
ect after you decide how you want to quilt your quilt (see Chapter 11) and
baste everything together (see Chapter 12).

Setting things up
For hand quilting, I recommend that you place your project in a hoop, which
is basically two circles or ovals that fit inside one another and hold your
piece taut and in place as you work (see Chapter 2 for more about hoops).
You can certainly quilt small projects such as pillow covers without a hoop,
but if you’re a beginner, you’re likely to find using a hoop more comfortable
until you have a bit more experience under your belt.
When working with a hoop, center a block or some other element of your
quilt top face up over the inner portion of the hoop. Place the outer portion
of the hoop over the quilt top–draped inner part, securing the quilt between
the two circles (or ovals, depending on your hoop). Hand-tighten the wing
nut on the outer hoop to keep the fabric snug and taut.
You can also place your project in a quilting frame, a freestanding contraption
that serves the same purpose as a hoop when you’re working on a large project.
However, because they’re expensive (and therefore somewhat cost-prohibitive)
and most beginners don’t have them, I don’t go into detail about frames in this
chapter. If you decide to invest in a quilting frame, simply follow the manufac-
turer’s instructions for how to use your new toy.
Threading the needle ’n hiding the knot
For hand quilting, I strongly recommend you use hand quilting thread (check
the label on the end of the spool to see whether the thread you have is designed
for hand or machine quilting). Hand quilting thread is heavy and strong, mean-
ing that the chance of breakage or fraying is substantially reduced.
Cut a length about 18 inches long — from your fingers to your elbow is long
enough and keeps the thread from becoming tangled or weakening as you
stitch — and thread a quilting needle (a size 7 or 8 between needle works
nicely). Make a small knot in the long end of the thread.
No self-respecting quilter would ever want knots showing on the quilt’s back
side! So before you can start stitching, you have to hide the knot. Not only is
hiding knots a tidier way to quilt, but the actual quilting stitches are made
stronger because the knots aren’t vulnerable to abrasion as the quilt gets used.
To hide the knot, follow these steps:
1. Insert the needle into the quilt top 1 to 2 inches from where you plan
to begin stitching.
Where you start your quilting stitches doesn’t matter; just pick a spot
that looks promising — a corner or the tip of a design element are good
spots.
155
Chapter 13: Ready, Set . . . Quilt! The Ins and Outs of Quilting Your Masterpiece

2. Dig the needle slightly into the batting without piercing the backing,
and pull the needle back up through the quilt top at the point where
you intend to start your stitches.
3. Pull the thread through the quilt top, and when you get to the end of
the thread where the knot is located, give the thread a little tug so
that the knot pops through the quilt top and lodges in the batting, as
shown in Figure 13-1.
If you tug a little too hard and pop your knot all the way through, don’t
worry about it. It happens to all of us. Simply insert the needle a small
distance from your starting point and try again . . . just don’t tug so hard!
If your knot keeps sliding through the batting, add another knot to the
end of the thread and try hiding it again. It may be tougher to pop
through the quilt top, but the extra knot ensures that it won’t budge
once it’s in the batting.
Hand stitching your quilt
With your quilt in the hoop, your needle threaded, and your knot hidden,
turn the hoop in your lap so that the direction of the quilting runs toward
you, from the upper right (around 2 o’clock, if your hoop were a clock face)
to the lower left of the hoop (around 7 o’clock). Note: Some quilters like to
stitch toward themselves and others away from themselves. Don’t worry if
my recommended setup doesn’t work for you — just do what comes natural,
and you’ll be fine.
If you’re left-handed, reverse the hands and directions in the steps that
follow. This warning may be completely unnecessary — you’re probably used
to reversing instructions anyway. After all, lefties are all highly intelligent.
(This message was brought to you today by my left-handed husband and
teenage daughter, who love to remind me that Albert Einstein was a lefty, and
I’m a mere righty.)
Follow these instructions to hand stitch your quilt:
1. Place your free hand (the left one, unless you’re a lefty) under the
hoop directly under the stitching area.
Figure 13-1:
Burying the
knot in the
batting.
156

2. With your thimble on the middle finger of your right hand, insert the
needle straight down into the quilt about 1⁄16 inch from the point
where you brought the thread up through the quilt top when hiding
your knot. Stop pushing the needle when it clears the backing fabric.
You should feel the point of the needle as it pierces the quilt backing.
Ouch! Sorry, but feeling the prick of the needle is the only way to know
that the needle is through all the layers. If you’d rather not poke your
finger to death, try placing a soft leather thimble on the “receiving”
finger under the quilt. Keep the bandages and ouchie spray handy,
though. After all, this is a learning experience.
Some quilters like to protect their tender fingertips by holding a spoon
in the receiving hand under their quilt. The curved bowl of the spoon
stops the needle and also assists the quilter in pushing the needle back
through to the quilt top. Try it!
3. Bring the needle back up through the quilt top by rocking the
needle back.
4. Load two or three stitches onto the needle following Steps 2 and 3 (as
shown in Figure 13-2), and then pull the needle all the way through
the quilt top.
As you become accustomed to hand quilting, you’ll find that you can
load more stitches on the needle at one time, speeding up the process
considerably.
5. After you pull the needle through, insert it again about 1⁄16 inch from
where you came out of the fabric, and repeat the stitching process
along your marked lines.
6. When you’re left with about 8 inches of thread on your needle, bring
the needle to the quilt top, and backstitch over your last stitch by insert-
ing your needle into the starting point of your last stitch and up through
the ending point of the last stitch, creating two stitches in the same spot.
Figure 13-2:

157
Chapter 13: Ready, Set . . . Quilt! The Ins and Outs of Quilting Your Masterpiece

7. Insert the needle into the quilt top in line with your previous stitches,
travel through the batting for an inch, and come up to the surface
again (it’s a bit like swimming underwater). Cut the thread tail close
to the quilt top.
8. Thread the needle with a fresh length of thread and keep going until
the quilt is quilted!
If you find that the hoop impairs your quilting, you can quilt some of the quilt
area within the hoop to keep those layers in place and then remove the hoop
and finish that area without it. Then use the hoop again when you start a new
area. Just remember that the hoop keeps the layers from shifting, so be sure
you quilt enough area to keep them in place.
Making Fast Progress with 
Machine Quilting
If you choose to machine quilt your project, you need to prepare your
machine for the chore at hand. Each machine quilting technique requires a
different type of presser foot and machine setting, so read through this sec-
tion carefully.
Your thread options here are very diverse: You can use all-purpose thread in
matching or contrasting colors, multi-colored or variegated thread to add a
little pizzazz, or clear nylon thread so you don’t have to worry about thread
color at all!
158
Part IV: Ahead to the Finish: Quilting the Pieces in Place
Bloodstains: The unwelcome embellishment
Whenever needles and fingers come together,
blood may not be too far behind. The last thing
you want is your pristine fabric and hard work
dotted with drops. Prevention isn’t always pos-
sible, however, so here are the two best options
for dealing with bloodstains as soon as they
occur:
 Lick the spot. Yep, you read that right, lick
it. Human saliva contains certain elements
that help break down proteins, so as much
as you don’t want to do it because it’s icky,
licking a blood spot is an effective way to
eliminate it. It’s fast and easy, and you
barely miss a stitch. (And don’t worry about
leaving germs on the project — you’ll wash
it after you’re done quilting anyway.)
 Gently blot the spot with a cotton swab
dipped in warm water. You can even put a
little bit of mild soap on the swab if you have
a particularly stubborn spot. Just be sure to
avoid using hot or cold water because
either one will set the stain, and don’t satu-
rate the area — just blot until the swab
absorbs the stain.

Like any other quilting method, machine quilting requires your project to be
basted, either with thread or with pins (I cover both methods in Chapter 12).
If your quilt is pin basted, you must remove the safety pins as you approach
them when quilting! Do not, under any circumstances, attempt to machine
stitch over a safety pin. Not only does stitching over pins make them difficult
to remove, but also it’s dangerous! You can easily break your needle, sending
a fragment of the needle flying, perhaps into your eye. While that’s the worst
thing that can happen, you can also ruin your machine’s timing, and it’ll
never work as well again.
Preparing large-size projects
Large quilting projects, such as bed quilts, require some special handling
when it comes to machine quilting.
If you’re quilting a large project, such as a bed quilt, be sure you have a large
surface to the rear and to the left of your machine to help you support the
weight of the quilt. Large projects are very heavy and can easily pull your
machine right off the table and onto the floor if you don’t have things set up
properly!
Prepare any quilt larger than 36 x 36 inches for quilting by rolling it as follows:
1. Lay the basted quilt on the floor.
2. Roll the two sides towards the center, leaving a 12-inch swath of quilt
unrolled in the middle, as shown in Figure 13-3.
The unrolled swath is where you begin machine quilting.
3. Secure the rolls with safety pins or bicycle clips.
Figure 13-3:

159
Chapter 13: Ready, Set . . . Quilt! The Ins and Outs of Quilting Your Masterpiece

Bicycle clips are flexible metal rings with small openings; they’re intended to
hold your pants legs against your body while cycling so your pants don’t get
caught in the bicycle chain. But they’re great for holding rolled up quilts in
place, too! Just think of the rolled edges of the quilt as the “leg,” and put the
clip over this rolled leg, holding it securely in place. You can find bicycle clips
at sporting goods stores and some quilting stores.
Sometimes this rolling process is too much like moving a stick around and
trying to get it to bend to the shape you need. So if rolling seems too cumber-
some and you can’t seem to control your quilt very well this way, just bunch
it up as you move it.
Starting out simply with 
straight-line quilting
Straight-line quilting is the easiest form of machine quilting. The results are
always good, and it’s quick, too! One of the easiest and fastest straight-line
techniques is quilting in-the-ditch, which means sewing right along the seams
of your patches and borders, hiding the stitches in the seam areas. If you
want something more visible than in-the-ditch stitches, you can quilt 1⁄4 inch
from the ditches, framing your patches and blocks with lines of stitching.
Straight-line quilting requires an even-feed presser foot, which you can see
compared to a regular presser foot in Figure 13-4. If your machine didn’t come
with an even-feed foot, take a trip to the sewing center to get one. Take your
machine’s manual with you so the clerk can help you find the right foot for
your model.
An even-feed foot produces smooth and pucker-free machine quilting stitches
because it feeds the layers of the quilt through the machine evenly. Without
it, the feed dogs (those teeth under the needle) only feed the bottom layer of
fabric through the machine, leaving the batting and top layers vulnerable to
puckering because they aren’t fed through the machine at the same rate.

feed foot

160
Part IV: Ahead to the Finish: Quilting the Pieces in Place

To commence straight-line quilting, follow these steps:
1. Make sure the top of the machine and the bobbin are threaded prop-
erly (jump back to the “Making Fast Progress with Machine Quilting”
section for instructions on what kind of thread to use). Set the stitch
length on the machine at 6 to 10 stitches per inch.
2. Place the unrolled center area of the quilt in the machine, and slowly
take one stitch.
3. Stop stitching after the first stitch, and with the needle up, raise the
presser foot. Pull the top thread tail until the bobbin thread tail comes
up through the hole in the stitch you made in Step 2.
You should have both tails on top of the quilt.
4. Lower the presser foot, and take two stitches before stopping.
5. Put your machine in reverse, and take two stitches backward to
secure the thread.
With the thread secured, you’re ready to stitch your quilt.
6. Continue stitching forward (without reversing) along your marked
lines or in-the-ditch.
7. When you get to a corner and need to turn the direction of your
stitching, lower the needle into the fabric, stop stitching, and raise the
presser foot. Pivot the quilt so that you can continue stitching in the
desired direction, and lower the presser foot again. Continue stitching.
8. When you reach a spot where you need to stop stitching, take two
stitches backward to secure the thread, just as in Step 5, and clip the
threads.
If you don’t secure the thread at the beginning and end of every line of 
stitching, you run the risk the stitches coming undone at these starting
and stopping points. And when your stitches come out, you get an unsightly
1⁄4 inch or so gap.
When you finish quilting the area you left unrolled initially, secure your
stitches, clip the threads, and remove the project from the machine. Unroll
the sides to expose an unquilted area, and continue stitching until the entire
quilt is quilted.
Breaking boundaries with free-motion
machine quilting
Free-motion quilting is the method used to create beautiful, fancy quilting pat-
terns; decorative possibilities are limited only by your imagination. You can
161
Chapter 13: Ready, Set . . . Quilt! The Ins and Outs of Quilting Your Masterpiece

use this type of machine quilting to create graceful curved designs and floral
patterns as well as popular stipple quilting designs (see Chapter 11 for more
on stipple quilting.)
Mastering free-motion machine quilting requires some practice, but this sec-
tion gets you started so that you can go out and gather more information on
different techniques to use in your projects.
To do free-motion quilting, you need a special presser foot called a darning or
free-motion foot. This type of foot has a round toe that travels just above the
surface of the fabric, creating a sort of target for the needle and allowing you
to see more of your stitches. In a nutshell, it’s an embroidery hoop on a
needle. Pretty cool.
Because you feed the quilt through the machine manually, free-motion quilt-
ing requires you to disengage your machine’s feed dogs, the little teeth under
your sewing machine foot that move fabric along as you stitch. Refer to your
machine’s manual to see exactly how your feed dogs work:
 On some machines, you disengage the feed dogs by turning a knob,
which lowers them out of position.
 On other machines (especially older models), you don’t lower the feed
dogs to disengage them. Instead, you cover them with a metal or plastic
plate that’s in your machine’s bag of tricks.
With free-motion quilting, you don’t need to adjust the length of the straight-
stitch on your machine at all. The speed at which you sew combined with
the speed at which you move the quilt around under the needle deter-
mines the stitch length. The potential for very small or very large stitches
is why practice is so important before attempting free-motion quilting on a
large project.
After inserting the darning foot and disengaging the feed dogs, thread your
machine and bobbin. Then follow these basic steps:
1. Place the quilt under the presser foot with one hand positioned on
either side of the quilt, 2 inches or so from the presser foot.
2. Slowly begin stitching, taking two or three stitches in the same spot to
secure the thread.
3. As you stitch, move the quilt by guiding it with your hands. If you
have a premarked design, move the quilt so that the needle follows
your marked quilting lines or designs.
Keep the machine at a steady speed, and move the fabric slowly and
smoothly so you don’t end up with gaps or overly long stitches. Slow
and steady is the key here!
162
Part IV: Ahead to the Finish: Quilting the Pieces in Place

If your fingers feel dry, or if you’re having trouble moving the quilt under
the machine because your fingers are sliding on the fabric, cover the
first and index finger of each hand (four fingers in all) with rubber finger-
tips sold at office supply stores. Or purchase inexpensive knit gloves
with rubbery dots on them designed for this very purpose at any quilt-
ing supply store.
Because free-motion machine quilting takes some time to get comfortable
with, I recommend starting on small projects, such as pillows, place mats, or
wall hangings, before progressing to larger projects. If you’re just starting out
with free-motion quilting, try stipple quilting, a great beginner’s exercise
because you don’t have to worry about following a set pattern. Instead, you
figure out how to maneuver the project under the darning foot and get some
much-needed experience.
If you’re new to free motion machine quilting, I suggest you make small quilt
sandwiches with muslin and batting and use them as practice pallets. (Be sure
to save them and look at them from time to time to see how far you’ve come!)
Taking the Tie Road
If your quilting project is a big, fluffy quilt full of high-loft batting, hand and
machine quilting are out the window. The loft and bulk make stitching through
the layers by hand or machine extremely difficult. Instead, you need to tie the
quilt. Tying is a quick, simple process in which the three layers of the quilt are
held together with pieces of thread. The principle is the same as using a tie
tack to secure a man’s necktie, keeping the two tails from flapping in the
breeze. Tying works best with polyester battings that don’t need to be quilted
at tightly spaced intervals.
Tying isn’t limited to fluffy quilts, though. It also works for securing cotton
and blended batts (as long as your ties fit the intervals recommended by the
batting manufacturer). If you’re pressed for time and just want to get the darn
thing done, or if your first attempt at making a quilt is just too ugly to bother
quilting by hand or machine (you should have seen my first quilt!), tying is
faster than hand or machine quilting. If you have a feeling your project will
make a better car blanket or dog bed than wall hanging, tie it off and at least
get some use out of it. No sense wasting all that hard work.
To tie a quilt:
1. Thread a sharp-pointed, large-eyed needle with a 12-inch length of
heavy thread. Don’t knot the end.
For tying quilts you need heavy thread, such as pearl cotton, embroi-
dery floss, narrow ribbon, or even worsted-weight yarn. Don’t use 
163
Chapter 13: Ready, Set . . . Quilt! The Ins and Outs of Quilting Your Masterpiece

all-purpose thread — it’s just not strong enough to hold the tied layers
together.
2. Insert the needle straight down into the quilt top and through all
three layers, and bring it back up in the opposite direction 1⁄8 inch
from where it went down.
3. Pull the needle through the quilt so that you have about 4 inches of
thread on the tail end (where your needle first went into the quilt).
Tie the tail end to the threaded end in a double knot.
4. Trim the two tails to about 1 inch in length.
5. Repeat Steps 2 through 4 at consistent intervals — every 5 to 6 inches
or however close the batting manufacturer recommends.
When all your ties are finished, trim all the thread tails to the desired length —
just make sure they’re no shorter than 1⁄2 inch. Your efforts should resemble
Figure 13-5.
To speed up the tying process, start with a longer length of thread, follow
Steps 1 through 3 above, and then, instead of cutting your thread after each
stitch, continue making stitches and tying them until you’re about 4 inches
from the end of your thread. Tie your final knot, go back and cut the thread
stretching between each of the knots, and trim the tails to 1 inch.

Bindings and More
In This Chapter

 Using your backing as binding
 Finishing your projects pillow-style
W
hen you finish stitching and quilting your masterpiece, you need to do
something about those raw edges and the batting hanging out. Your
quilt sure won’t look too great left as it is!
You can choose from many ways of finishing the edges of your quilt. The
most popular method is encasing the raw edges in a binding, either bias or
straight-edge, which you can purchase or make yourself from extra fabric.
Another option is to fold the excess backing fabric to the front for a self-
binding. Or you can finish your quilt pillow-style.
This chapter describes each type of binding and the technique for making
and using it, along with its advantages and possible disadvantages.
Calculating Your Binding Needs
To determine how much binding you need to finish off your quilting project,
total the measurements of all four sides and add 12 inches. The additional
12 inches allows both for mitering the corners of the binding (which I discuss
in the section “Tackling traditional bias binding” later in the chpater) and for
the overlap where the binding starts and stops. (Plus, 12 inches factors in a
little extra, just in case.) Table 14-1 provides a quick reference for the amount
of binding needed for typical bed-size quilts.

Table 14-1
Binding Needs for Bed-Size Quilts
Type of Bed
Amount of Binding
Crib
5–6 yards
Twin
9 yards
Double/Full
10 yards
Queen
11 yards
King
12 yards
This table tells you the length of the binding necessary to finish off all sides
of the quilt, not the amount of yardage needed to actually make that binding.
In a Bias Bind
The most common method of binding a quilt project is to apply bias binding
around the edges of your quilt. Bias simply means that the fabric is cut diago-
nally across the weave of the fabric. Traditional bias binding and double-fold
binding use strips of fabric cut on the bias to enclose the raw edges of the
quilt.
I prefer to use a bias-cut binding on my quilts because it’s more forgiving at
corners and around curves, and it tends to pucker less than a binding that
has been cut on-grain. The little bit of give in a bias binding also makes it
easier to stitch to the quilt by offering less resistance to the feed dogs than
on-grain bindings.
In this section, I tell you how to assemble bias binding strips. Then, I explain
the two variations of the bias binding technique.
Creating bias strips
When making bias strips, you can either create one long strip or cut individ-
ual strips and then sew them together to get the length you need. You can
use either of these methods to produce the different types of bias binding
covered later in this chapter.
166
Part IV: Ahead to the Finish: Quilting the Pieces in Place 

Making a continuous binding strip
To end up with a continuous binding strip, follow these steps:
1. Cut a 44” x 44” square of fabric (with selvages removed) in half diago-
nally to make two large triangles (see Figure 14-1a).
The square is cut on-grain at this point.
2. Stitch the triangles together along the short edges to make the shape
shown in Figure 14-1b. Press the seam allowance open.
You now have a trapezoid shape with two bias edges (upper and lower).
3. Decide how wide you need the binding to be (refer to the individual
binding techniques in this chapter for help determining this measure-
ment), and mark lines on the wrong side of the fabric using a ruler
(refer to Figure 14-1c).
4. Stitch the short ends of the fabric together (right sides facing), off-
setting the lines by one strip line to form a funny-looking tube (refer
to Figure 14-1d).
Carefully press the seam allowance open.
5. With scissors, cut the binding in one continuous strip, starting at the
offset overhang and cutting along the marked lines.

Chapter 14: Finishing Touches: Bindings and More

Taking a shortcut to making bias binding strips
The second method of creating bias strips, sewing simple strips together, is
the one I use. I prefer this stitch-as-you-go method because it’s a good way to
use up an odd-size piece of fabric. Because I’m cutting bias strips instead of a
perfect square, it doesn’t matter if my choice of binding fabric has been cut
into previously.
To cut bias strips using this technique, follow these easy steps:
1. Using a ruler, mark lines on a piece of fabric on a 45-degree angle
to the grain line. Space the lines the width you need for your strips
(see the individual techniques in this chapter for help determining
the width to mark).
Most see-through rulers intended for rotary cutting have 45-degree lines
already marked on them, so they’re especially useful for this task.
2. Cut the strips apart using a rotary cutter (see Figure 14-2a).
You can use scissors if you prefer.
3. Pin together the short ends of two strips, as shown in Figure 14-2b,
with the right sides together. Offset the strips so that there’s a small
tail at either end of the future seam.
Offsetting the strips slightly accommodates a 1⁄4-inch seam allowance 
and produces the little tails. If you don’t offset the strips as shown in
Figure 14-2b, you won’t have a straight smooth line along the edges of
your binding.
4. Sew the strips together where they’re pinned, use scissors to trim off
the little fabric tails, and press the seam allowances open.
5. Continue joining strips until you have enough length to bind your
quilt.

Tackling traditional bias binding
Traditional bias binding, as you would expect, is the old-fashioned way to
bind a quilt. The binding is made from a wide strip of bias-cut fabric that’s
folded down the center lengthwise. Each lengthwise half of the strip is then
folded again before being attached to the quilt, giving the top and back of the
quilt each two layers of binding.
Traditional bias binding is the most durable binding method because, when
you’re finished stitching, you actually have two layers of fabric covering the
raw edges of the quilt. Because of its durability, I recommend using tradi-
tional bias binding for bed-size quilts or anything that will undergo a lot of
laundering.
To make a traditional bias binding:
1. Using one of the methods in the “Creating bias strips” section earlier
in the chapter, cut strips of fabric eight times wider than the desired
width of the finished binding.
For example, if you prefer a binding that is 1⁄2-inch wide when finished,
cut 4-inch-wide strips of bias-cut fabric (1⁄2 x 8 = 4). (See the sidebar
“Getting the most binding for your buck” later in this chapter for details
on how much 4-inch binding you get from various fabric cuts.)
2. Fold in 1⁄2 inch of the beginning of the strip so that the right side of the
folded fabric faces you. Then, fold the strip in half (wrong sides facing)
along its entire length, as shown in Figure 14-3.
3. Press the strip carefully along the lengthwise fold, taking care not to
stretch the bias.
4. Place the pressed strip on the front of the quilt so that the double raw
edge is even with the raw edges of the quilt top and the fold in the
strip is toward the center of the quilt. Pin the strip in place.
5. Along one long side of the quilt, start about 4 inches from the folded
end of the bias strip. Begin machine stitching the binding in place
1⁄4 inch from the double raw edge of the binding.

Chapter 14: Finishing Touches: Bindings and More

When you begin to approach a corner, slow down a bit so that you have
better control, and stitch to within 1⁄4 inch of the corner of the quilt top.
(See the dot in Figure 14-4? That’s where you stop stitching.) Take a back
stitch or two to secure your thread before cutting it and turning the quilt
to the next side.
6. Miter the corner by folding the bias strip upwards at the corner so that
it extends the right-hand edge of the quilt (see Figure 14-5a), and then
fold it down so that the newly made fold is even with the top edge
of the quilt, the one you just stitched along (shown in Figure 14-5b).
Holding the folded binding in place, line up the quilt in your sewing
machine so that you can start stitching the strip to the next side of the
quilt, around the corner.

7. Continue stitching the binding to the edges as described in Step 5 and
mitering the corners as described in Step 6.
8. To end your binding back where you started (what goes around
comes around), trim the ending tail of the binding so that it overlaps
the beginning by about 2 inches. (You left 4 inches of it unstitched,
remember? If not, see Step 5.) Insert the ending tail of the binding
into the folded beginning, and continue stitching through all the
layers.
9. Trim away any excess backing fabric and batting (anything that
extends beyond the quilt top) with scissors.
10. Fold the binding to the back side of the quilt and, using the blind-stitch,
hand stitch it in place directly over the line of machine stitching on all
four sides (see Figure 14-6). To create the blind-stitch:
1. Hide your knot by inserting your needle in the backing fabric a
short distance from where you want to start. Bring your needle
up through the edge of the binding, and pop the knot through the
backing fabric by tugging on the thread. (A firm tug is all you need;
pull too hard and you’ll break the thread and have to start over.)
2. With your thread coming through the binding, insert the needle
into the quilt backing directly opposite.
3. Bring the needle up through the binding again about 1⁄8 inch from
the first stitch in the binding. In this manner, you’ve traveled 1⁄8 inch
and hidden the traveling portion of the thread in the quilt backing.

Chapter 14: Finishing Touches: Bindings and More

Double-fold binding
The double-fold binding method uses a single layer of fabric on the edges of
the quilt, making it more economical than traditional bias binding. This type
of bias binding isn’t quite as durable as traditional binding (see the preceding
section), so I recommend that you use it for projects that won’t be handled
or washed frequently, such as wall hangings and table runners.
Double-fold binding is great for anything that has rounded corners because
the natural stretch of the bias along with the single layer at the edge helps
you round corners smoothly.
Pressed for time? If so, pick up double-fold bias tape in any fabric store. It comes
in a variety of colors and even some prints, such as gingham. Look for packages
marked “Extra-Wide Double-Fold Bias Tape.” Because this premade binding
is sold in packages containing 2 to 3 yards of bias tape, you’re likely to need
several packages.
If you’re determined to make your own double-fold bias binding, follow these
steps:
1. Cut strips of fabric four times wider than the desired width of the fin-
ished binding.
For example, if you want a finished binding that’s 1⁄2 inch wide, cut strips
that are 2 inches wide (1⁄2 inch x 4 = 2). (See the sidebar “Getting the most
binding for your buck” earlier in this chapter for details on how much 
2-inch binding you get from various fabric cuts.)
172
Part IV: Ahead to the Finish: Quilting the Pieces in Place 
Getting the most binding for your buck
The instructions I give you for making a contin-
uous bias binding (see the section “Making a
continuous binding strip”) are for a 44- x 44-inch
square of fabric, but you can use the same
process with different size fabric squares to
make less binding — it all depends on what you
need for your project. Use the guide in this side-
bar to help you estimate the amount of fabric
needed to make the correct amount of binding
for your project.
If you want binding that’s 4 inches wide:
 A 44- x 44-inch square of fabric produces
about 13 yards
 A 36- x 36-inch square produces 9 yards
 A 20- x 20-inch square produces only about
2.5 yards
If you want binding that’s 2 inches wide:
 A 45- x 45-inch square produces 26 yards
 A 36- x 36-inch square produces 18 yards
 A 20- x 20-inch square produces 5.5 yards

2. Fold the strip in half lengthwise with the wrong sides together (see
Figure 14-7a).
3. Press the center fold.
4. Open the strip so that the wrong side of the fabric faces up.
5. Fold each side of the strip toward the center fold so that the raw edges
meet in the middle (see Figure 14-7b).
6. Press each folded side.
7. With the sides still folded in, refold the strip along the center crease,
and press it to reestablish the center crease.
8. Open all the folds of the binding strip, and turn in 1⁄4 inch at the start-
ing end of the strip so that the right side of the folded piece faces you.
9. Place one raw edge of the binding strips along the raw edge of the
quilt top (right sides facing), and machine stitch in the ditch of the
binding crease nearest the edge (see Figure 14-7c), about 4 inches
from the end of the length of binding, leaving a tail.
When you begin to approach a corner, slow down a bit so that you have
better control, and stitch to within 1⁄4 inch of the corner of the quilt top.
Backstitch once or twice before cutting the thread and turning the quilt.
10. Miter the corner by folding the bias strip upwards at the corner so
that it extends the right-hand edge of the quilt, and then fold it down
so that the newly made fold is even with the top edge of the quilt, the
one you just stitched along. Holding the folded binding in place, line
up the quilt in your sewing machine so that you can start stitching the
strip to the next side of the quilt, around the corner.
11. Continue stitching the binding to the edges as described in Step 9 and
mitering the corners as described in Step 10.
12. To end your binding back where you started (what goes around
comes around), trim the ending tail of the binding so that it overlaps
the beginning by about 2 inches. (You left 4 inches of it unstitched,
remember? If not, see Step 9.) Insert the ending tail of the binding
into the folded beginning, and continue stitching through all the
layers.
13. Trim away any excess backing fabric and batting (anything that
extends beyond the quilt top) with scissors.
14. Fold the binding to the back side of the quilt.
The center crease should lie along the very edge of the quilt.
15. On the back side, use the blind-stitch (see the section “Tackling tradi-
tional bias binding” earlier in this chapter for blind-stitch instructions)
to hand stitch the binding in place along the remaining crease, stitching
directly over the machine stitching line.
173
Chapter 14: Finishing Touches: Bindings and More

Using What You Already Have: 
Self-Binding
Self-binding is a quick and easy way to bind small projects. Also known as
fold-over binding, a self-binding is made from excess backing fabric that’s
trimmed to size and folded to the front side of the quilt to enclose the raw
edges.
I recommend this binding only for small projects because it’s a straightedge
binding and therefore doesn’t have the flexibility of a bias binding. In fact, 
self-binding tends to ripple the edges of the project slightly if used on long
sides of a project. It’s fine to use on place mats and wall hangings, but I don’t
recommend you use it on anything larger than a baby quilt.

Part IV: Ahead to the Finish: Quilting the Pieces in Place 

If you want to make your project self-binding, be sure to
 Cut your backing fabric at least 3 inches larger than your project on
all four sides.
For example, if you have a 30- x 30-inch project, cut your backing 
36 x 36 inches.
 Center your quilt top on the backing fabric carefully before basting
and quilting it.
 Keep in mind that whatever you use as your backing fabric will be vis-
ible on the front of the quilt, so choose the backing accordingly.
Follow these steps to make your project self-binding:
1. After quilting your project, trim excess batting from the edges of the
quilt so that it doesn’t extend beyond the edges of the quilt top.
Be very careful not to cut through the backing fabric.
2. Trim the backing fabric so that the amount that extends beyond the
edge of the quilt top measures two times the desired width of the
binding.
For example, if you want a 1⁄2-inch binding, trim the backing fabric to 1
inch (1⁄2 inch x 2 = 1) beyond the edges of the quilt top.
3. Fold the backing fabric toward the front of the quilt just slightly less
than 1⁄2 inch, and press, keeping the iron away from the batting (see
Figure 14-8).
4. Fold the backing fabric over again 1⁄2 inch toward the front of the
quilt, covering up the raw edge.
Don’t press this fold or you may flatten the batting at the edges of 
your quilt.
5. Stitch the self-binding in place on the quilt front by machine or by
hand using the blind-stitch (see the section “Tackling traditional bias
binding” earlier in this chapter for blind-stitch instructions).

Chapter 14: Finishing Touches: Bindings and More

Keeping It All Inside: 
Pillow-style Finishing
Pillow-style finishing is a way of finishing a quilt project without using a bind-
ing at all. With this method, you enclose the raw edges of the quilt in the quilt
itself, and you do the quilting after the three quilt layers are sewn together —
which I guess is why some people call this method birthing a quilt. Go figure!
I recommend pillow-style finishing only for very small projects, such as place
mats and hot pads. Anything larger can be too bulky to handle comfortably
and is a pain in the neck to try and push through the sewing machine.

Part IV: Ahead to the Finish: Quilting the Pieces in Place 

For pillow-style finishing, cut your border strips 1⁄4 to 1⁄2 inch wider than your
desired finished width so that you don’t end up with a project smaller than
you intended. The seam allowance required by the finishing technique takes
up the excess.
To finish a project pillow-style, follow these steps:
1. Cut backing and batting pieces at least 2 inches larger than your quilt
top all around.
2. Lay the batting out on a flat work surface. Center the quilt top over
the batting right side up, and trim the batting to match the quilt top
perfectly.
Because batting tends to stretch and relax, you’ll end up trimming the
batting even if you cut it to size from the start.
3. Place a pin through the layers — the center of the piece works best —
to keep them from shifting during the next steps.
4. Turn the whole thing over so that the batting faces you and the quilt
top faces your work surface.
5. Place the backing fabric right side up on your work surface. Center
the quilt top unit over the backing fabric, with the right sides of the
backing and the quilt top together. (The batting should be facing you.)
6. Pin all three layers together, spacing your pins no less than 2 inches
apart.
Use lots of pins to tame the batting.
7. Place the piece in the sewing machine, and stitch 1⁄4 inch to 1⁄2 inch
(depending on your preference and comfort level) in from the raw
edge around all four sides, leaving a 6-inch opening along one side for
turning.
Figure 14-9 shows where you stitch, beginning and ending at the dots.
8. Clip the points off the corners close to but not through the stitching
(see Figure 14-9).
9. Turn the piece right side out through the opening by putting your
hand through the opening, grabbing one of the far corners, and
pulling it toward you. Continue pulling the fabric through the opening
until the whole thing is right side out.
10. Hand stitch the opening closed by tucking in the raw edges and using
the blind-stitch (see the section “”Tackling traditional bias binding”
earlier in this chapter for blind-stitch instructions).
177
Chapter 14: Finishing Touches: Bindings and More

11. Using pins or thread, baste through all three layers to prepare the
project for quilting (check out Chapter 12 for basting details). Then
quilt it however you want to (see Chapter 10 for quilt design ideas).

here’s more to quilting that just cutting out a few squares of fabric and
sewing them together. Quilting is also an art form, and like any great form
of art, the more skills you develop, the better you become as an artist. The
projects in this chapter use techniques that are a little more advanced and,
as such, can help take you from beginner to intermediate quilter.
Hand-Quilted Starburst Pillow
Are you ready to try hand quilting? Great! Here’s a quick, fun project to get
you started. The small size (14 inches square) makes it more than manage-
able for the beginner. This pillow makes a great take-along project, too:
Just whip it out of your bag whenever you find a few precious moments
of spare time.
Stashing your materials
The following list covers the fabrics and notions you need to create this
pillow:
 101⁄2- x 101⁄2-inch square of off-white tone-on-tone fabric
 1⁄3 yard of yellow print fabric
 15- x 15-inch piece of off-white tone-on-tone fabric
 15- x 15-inch piece of low-loft cotton or polyester batting

 15- x 15-inch piece of coordinating print fabric
 2 yards of purchased piping in navy blue
 All-purpose thread in off-white
 Hand quilting thread in navy blue
 A between needle (a short, sharp needle made especially for quilting or
other detailed handwork; see Chapter 2)
 Stuffing or a 14-inch pillow form (see the sidebar “A word about 
pillow forms”)
Preparing the pillow top for quilting
In the following steps, I explain how to transfer the quilting design onto the
pillow top and prepare the top for quilting:
1. Fold the 101⁄2-inch off-white square into quarters and press it. Unfold
the square, and lay it flat.
The resulting creases help you center your quilting pattern.
2. Using the creases as a guide, transfer the quilting pattern at the end
of this project section to the center of the square by tracing or using
dressmaker’s carbon and a sharp pencil (see Figure 15-1).
182
Part V: Completing the Circle: Projects to Try 
A word about pillow forms
The pillow forms sold in fabric and craft supply
stores these days come in standardized sizes —
12-, 14-, 16-, 20-, and 24-inch. In addition to dif-
ferent sizes, pillow forms also come in different
weights; some are meant for soft, squishy pil-
lows, and others are firmer to give you a well-
stuffed look.
In an effort to have a nice, plump pillow and
avoid sad, empty corners, some folks purchase
a pillow form that’s an inch or two larger than
the cover. This approach is never a good idea
because stuffing a 24-inch insert into a 20-inch
pillow covering invites disasters such as split
seams and a lumpy filling.
With quilted pillow covering projects, you auto-
matically add thickness and support to the top
of the pillow, so the corners shouldn’t cave in 
if you use the right materials. I would never 
recommend that anyone buy an oversized
pillow form. Something stuffed that firmly isn’t a
pillow — it’s a mini-mattress! Yikes!

3. From the yellow print fabric, cut two 21⁄2- x 101⁄2-inch strips for the
upper and lower borders, and cut two 21⁄2- x 141⁄2-inch strips of the
same fabric for the side borders.
4. Using the all-purpose thread and a 1⁄4-inch seam allowance, machine
stitch the upper and lower borders to the marked off-white square
(see Figure 15-2). Press the seam allowances toward the borders.
5. Repeat Step 4 with the side borders.
6. Layer the pillow top with the batting and the off-white solid lining
fabric, and thread baste the layers together to prepare them for quilt-
ing (see Figure 15-3).

Quilting the pillow top
The following steps tell you how to quilt the starburst pattern onto the pillow
top. Refer to Chapter 13 if you need more information about the quilting
process:
1. Thread a between needle with a length of quilting thread about as
long as the distance from your elbow to your fingertips.
2. Starting wherever you feel like on the quilting pattern, bury the knot
in the batting, and begin quilting.
Take small, evenly spaced stitches.
3. Outline the off-white center square by hand quilting 1⁄4 inch away from
either side of the seam line connecting the center with the borders, as
shown in Figure 15-4.

Assembling the pillow
After you quilt the pillow top, you’re ready to finish the project. The following
steps explain how to assemble the pillow so you that can put your quilting
skills on display:
1. Thread your sewing machine with off-white all-purpose thread. Machine
stitch about 1⁄8 inch away from the raw edges of the pillow top.
2. Trim away the excess lining fabric and batting that extend beyond the
edges of the pillow top.
3. Machine stitch the piping around the edges of the pillow top by align-
ing the raw (not rounded) edge of the piping along the raw edge of the
pillow top. Begin stitching at the center of one side, leaving a 2-inch
tail of piping hanging free.
4. When you approach a corner, stop stitching 1⁄4 inch from the corner,
and clip into the seam allowance of the piping close to, but not
through, the stuffed area of the piping.
Clipping the seam allowance eliminates the bulk that would have
resulted at the corners if you had tried to turn them without stopping
and clipping. Clipping results in nice, pointed corners.
5. Turn the corner, and resume stitching the piping. When you arrive back
at your starting point, overlap the remaining piping and the tail you left
at the starting point, and stitch across them. Trim the excess tails of the
piping so that they’re only about 1⁄2 inch long (see Figure 15-5).
The layers of fabric and batting are a bit bulky, so you need to stitch
slowly to avoid breaking your needle.
Figure 15-5:
The two
tails of

185
Chapter 15: Fabulous Skill Builders

6. Place the completed pillow top against the 15- x 15-inch piece of coordi-
nating backing fabric, right sides together. Pin the two pieces together
to keep them from shifting during assembly.
7. Stitch the pillow top to the backing along the same line of stitches you
used to attach the piping, leaving a 10-inch opening along the bottom
edge for turning (see Figure 15-6).
8. Clip the corners close to the stitching line, but not through it, to elim-
inate bulk at the corners (refer to Figure 15-6).
9. Turn the pillow top right side out by pulling it through the opening.
10. Insert the pillow form or stuff the cover until it’s as firm as you like.
11. Tuck in the seam allowances of the opening, and hand stitch the open-
ing closed using the whip stitch.
To work the whip stitch,
1. Knot the end of a single length of thread.
2. Insert the needle on the underside of the quilt, bringing it up to the
right side on one side of the slit.
3. Cross to the other side of the slit and take a stitch, whipping back
and forth between the left- and right-hand sides of the slit until it’s
closed.
No need to worry about laundering this pillow — it’s really easy! Simply pop
the whole thing into the washer on a delicate setting, and then let it air dry.
You don’t need to remove the cover because the polyester stuffing in the
pillow form is completely machine washable. If you have any fiber migration
(like if the filling seems to gather in one corner of the pillow), bounce the
pillow on your knee a few times to redistribute the fluff.

Trapunto Mini-Pillow
Trapunto is a fancy style of hand quilting in which areas are stuffed for added
loft. Certain parts of the quilt’s design are puffier than others because you
carefully insert extra materials into those areas to make them stand out.
Although it’s a bit more time-consuming than standard hand quilting, Trapunto is
very easy to do, and the results are gorgeous! This old Italian technique tradition-
ally has been used to add interesting highlights to white-on-white bridal quilts
and other whole-cloth quilts (quilts that don’t have any appliqué or piecing).
The following sections tell you how to create a beautiful Trapunto Mini-Pillow
with a flower petal design. The finished size of the pillow is only 7 x 7 inches,
so it’s a great project to ease you into the Trapunto technique.
187
Chapter 15: Fabulous Skill Builders

Stashing your materials
The following list describes the fabrics and notions you need to make the
Trapunto Mini-Pillow:
 One 51⁄2- x 51⁄2-inch piece of off-white tone-on-tone fabric
 1⁄4 yard of yellow print fabric (a fat quarter works nicely here)
 One 8- x 8-inch piece of off-white tone-on-tone fabric
 One 8- x 8-inch piece of coordinating print fabric
 All-purpose thread in off-white
 Hand-quilting thread in off-white
 A between needle
 1 yard of purchased piping in navy blue
 One 20-ounce bag of polyester stuffing (fiberfill) for stuffing the pillow
(pillow forms are not available in this small size)
 Rug-weight yarn in off-white (available at any fabric shop)
 A large-eyed needle
Preparing the pillow top
Follow these steps to get the pillow top assembled and ready to be quilted:
1. Fold the 51⁄2-inch square of off-white fabric into quarters, and press it.
Unfold the square, and lay it flat.
2. Using the crease lines as a guide, transfer the flower petal quilting 
pattern at the end of this project section to the center of the square
by tracing or using dressmakers’ carbon and a sharp pencil (see
Figure 15-7).

Part V: Completing the Circle: Projects to Try 

Pressing the quilt top fabric at this point may set the markings perma-
nently, so don’t chance it. There’s no need to press the fabric anyway
because handling will cause the creases to fall out.
3. From the yellow print fabric, cut two 11⁄2- x 51⁄2-inch strips for the upper
and lower borders, and cut two 11⁄2- x 1⁄2-inch strips for side borders.
4. Using the all-purpose thread and a 1⁄4-inch seam allowance, machine
stitch the upper and lower borders to the square (see Figure 15-8).
Press the seam allowances toward the borders.
5. Repeat Step 4 with the two side borders.
6. Layer the pillow top with the batting and the 8- x 8-inch solid off-white
piece, which acts as the backing for the quilted portion of the pillow.
Thread baste the three layers together in preparation for quilting (see
Figure 15-9).

Quilting the pillow top
Before anything else, the pillow top needs to be quilted. Follow these steps:
1. Thread a between needle with a length of quilting thread about as
long as the distance from your elbow to your fingertips.
2. Starting wherever you feel like on the quilting design, bury the knot
in the batting, and begin quilting, following the petal pattern you
marked on the center square.
For best results, take small, evenly spaced stitches. For full coverage of
hand quilting, check out Chapter 12.
3. Outline the off-white center square by hand quilting 1⁄4 inch away
from either side of the seam line connecting the center with the bor-
ders, as shown in Figure 15-10.
4. Stipple quilt the entire off-white area surrounding the flower petal
design by taking small, meandering stitches (see Figure 15-11).
Refer to Chapter 11 for information on stipple quilting. This stipple quilt-
ing helps “raise” the main quilting motif by squishing down the areas
surrounding it.

Adding dimension to the pillow top
These steps tell you how to give your pillow top the Trapunto look:
1. Thread a large-eyed needle with a doubled length of rug yarn.
2. Turn the pillow top over so that the wrong side (the lining) is 
facing you.
3. Starting at the center end of a petal channel (which resulted from
quilting the design in the center of the pillow top), insert the needle
between the batting and the lining fabric, as shown in Figure 15-12.
Don’t go through the front layer!
When doing Trapunto, you need to keep the yarn between the batting
and the lining because otherwise you can see the yarn through the top
layer of fabric. Also, instead of creating a smoothly filled channel, insert-
ing the yarn below the wrong layer makes the channel bumpy.
4. Pull the needle out of the fabric at the tip of the petal (see Figure 15-12a),
and pull the yarn until only 1⁄2 inch is still peeking out at the starting
point.
5. Insert the needle into the hole you just came out of (see Figure 15-12b),
and run it through the channel to the other end of the petal, pulling
the needle out when you reach the end.
6. Trim the yarn close to the hole and at your starting point, as shown in
Figure 15-12c.
Fill each petal’s channel individually. The yarn doesn’t need to be knot-
ted because your quilting keeps it in the channels.

7. Repeat Steps 3 through 6 in the channels of all eight petals.
8. With a small pair of scissors, carefully cut a small slit in the lining
fabric at the center of each petal, but don’t cut through the batting or
the quilted layer.
The slit need only be 1⁄2-inch long at the most, as shown in Figure 15-13a.
9. Using the large-eyed needle or some other sharp object, push a small
amount of stuffing (about the size of a pea) into the slit. Repeat with
small bits of stuffing until you fill the petal.
10. Carefully whip stitch the slit closed using off-white all-purpose thread
in a hand-sewing needle (see Figure 15-13b).
To work the whip stitch,
1. Knot the end of a single length of thread.
2. Insert the needle on the underside of the quilt, bringing it up to the
right side on one side of the slit.
3. Cross to the other side of slit and take a stitch, whipping back and
forth between the left- and right-hand sides of the slit until it’s
closed.
11. After you stuff all the petals, machine stitch around the pillow top,
about 1⁄8 inch from the raw edges.
12. Trim away the excess lining fabric and batting that extends beyond
the edges of the pillow top.

Assembling the pillow
Follow these steps to assemble the pillow:
1. Using the all-purpose thread, begin machine stitching the piping
around the pillow top at the center of one edge, leaving a 2-inch 
tail of piping hanging free.
2. When you approach a corner, stop stitching 1⁄4 inch away from the
corner.
3. Clip into the seam allowance of the piping close to but not through
the stuffed area of the piping.
Clipping eliminates the bulk that would otherwise leave you with
rounded, icky corners rather than nice, pointed ones.
4. Rotate the pillow top around the corner, and resume stitching the
piping to the next edge.
Repeat Steps 2 and 3 at each corner.
5. When you return to your starting point, overlap the remaining piping
with the tail you left at the starting point, and stitch across the over-
lapped tails to completely stitch the piping in place. Trim the excess
piping to 1⁄2 inch, as shown in Figure 15-14.
The fabric and piping thicknesses will be a bit bulky. Stitch slowly so
that you don’t break your needle.

6. Place the completed pillow top against the 8- x 8-inch piece of coordi-
nating backing fabric, right sides together. Pin the two pieces together
to keep them from shifting during assembly.
7. Machine stitch the pillow top to the backing, following the stitching
line you made when attaching the piping. Leave a 4-inch opening
along the bottom edge for turning (see Figure 15-15).
8. Clip the corners close to the stitching line (but not through it) to elimi-
nate bulk at the corners (see Figure 15-15).
9. Turn the pillow top right side out by pulling it through the opening.
10. Stuff the pillow pocket firmly with polyester stuffing.
11. Tuck in the seam allowances of the opening, and hand stitch the open-
ing closed using the whip stitch.

Full-Size Trapunto Pattern
Dancing Blossoms Wall Hanging
Hand appliqué paired with embroidery makes a dainty team, and this project
is no exception. Three shades of pink fabrics make up each delicate blossom,
which is enhanced by narrow embroidered stems and leaf details. The light,
springtime feel of this project and its finished size (around 21 x 21 inches)
make it a great wall decoration for your home.
Don’t like pink? You can easily adapt the colors to your own preference by
selecting three shades of your favorite color of roses — or make each square
a different color. Variety is the spice of life!

Chapter 15: Fabulous Skill Builders

Stashing your materials
The following list covers the fabrics and notions you need to make the
Dancing Blossoms Wall Hanging:
 1⁄3 yard of off-white solid fabric
 One fat quarter of light pink print fabric
 One fat quarter of medium pink print fabric
 One fat quarter of deep pink print fabric
 One fat quarter of pink print fabric
 One fat quarter of light green print fabric
 Assorted scraps of green print fabric totaling 1⁄8 yard
 One 24- x 24-inch piece of coordinating fabric
 One 24- x 24-inch piece of low- or traditional-loft quilt batting
 All-purpose threads in off-white and coordinating shades of pink and green
 Six-strand cotton embroidery floss in medium green
 3 yards of off-white quilt binding
All seam allowances in this project are the standard 1⁄4 inch and are included
in the given measurements and directions.

2. Cut the two 57⁄8-inch squares of pink print in half diagonally to make
two triangles from each square — four triangles in all.
These are the corner triangles.
3. Cut the 1⁄2-inch square of pink print into quarters diagonally to make
four triangles.
These are the side triangles.
Creating the appliquéd blocks
The appliquéd blocks are the focal point of this wall hanging. Follow these
steps to create them:
1. Using the templates at the end of this project section, trace the follow-
ing appliqué shapes onto the wrong sides of the coordinating fabrics: 
• Trace four bud shapes onto each of the pink print fabrics — light,
medium, and dark. (The flower calls for three identical teardrop
shapes to make the blossom.)
• Trace 12 leaves onto the various green fabric scraps.
2. Cut out each appliqué shape, adding a 1⁄4-inch seam allowance to all
sides. Turn under and baste the seam allowances (see Chapter 10 for
instructions on the turn-and-baste method of appliqué).
3. Using the templates at the end of this project section and a water-soluble
pencil, trace one blossom spray onto each of the four off-white blocks
and one center leaf spray onto the remaining off-white block.
4. Arrange one set of appliqués (three bud pieces, two large leaves, and
two tiny leaves) on an off-white square (see Figure 15-16), and pin the
pieces in place.
197
Chapter 15: Fabulous Skill Builders

5. Starting with the bottommost bud, stitch the appliqués to the base
block using coordinating threads and an appliqué stitch.
For more on the appliqué stitch, turn to Chapter 10.
6. Thread a hand sewing needle with two strands of the green six-strand
floss. Embroider the stem lines and leaf details that you drew on the
block in Step 3 using a stem stitch (also known as an outline stitch;
see Figure 15-17).
To make a stem stitch, you insert the needle on one side of a line (drawn
or imaginary) and bring the needle back to the fabric surface on the
other side of the line. With each stitch, you advance along your desired
path, so that the line is “wrapped” with diagonal stitches.
7. Arrange the center leaf appliqués on the remaining off-white block,
pin them, and stitch them in place with the appliqué stitch.

Assembling the quilt center
Follow these steps to create the center of this quilt:
1. Thread your sewing machine with off-white all-purpose thread.
2. Using Figure 15-18 as a guide, stitch two side triangles to one blossom
block to make the upper-left row. Repeat with the two remaining side
triangles and one other blossom block to make the bottom-right row.
In this quilt, your rows are built diagonally (also known as “set on point”).
3. Stitch two blossom blocks to either side of the center leaf block. Then
stitch a corner triangle to each blossom block, as shown in Figure 15-18.
These five pieces make up the center row.
4. Stitch the three rows created in Steps 2 and 3 together, alternating
them as shown in Figure 15-18.
5. Stitch the two remaining corner triangles to the upper-left and lower-
right blossom blocks (the long side of the triangles should be closest
to the leaves in the blossom blocks).

Adding the borders
This section walks you through the steps of adding borders to your quilt center:
1. Stitch inner border strips to the right and left sides of the quilt center.
Press the seam allowances toward the green strips.
2. Stitch inner border cornerstones to the short ends of the two remain-
ing inner border strips, as shown in Figure 15-19.
3. Stitch the strips made in Step 2 to the upper and lower edges of the
quilt center. Press the seam allowances toward the border strips.
4. Stitch outer border strips to the right and left sides of the quilt center.
5. Stitch outer border cornerstones to the short ends of the two remain-
ing outer border strips.
6. Stitch the strips made in Step 5 to the upper and lower edges of the
quilt center to complete the quilt top (see Figure 15-19).

Quilting your quilt
To finish your quilt:
1. Lay the quilt top facedown on your work surface. On top, lay the bat-
ting and then backing fabric, right side up.
2. Thread or pin baste the layers together to prepare the project for
quilting (for a basting how-to, flip to Chapter 12).
3. Hand or machine quilt as desired.
For design ideas, turn to Chapter 11. The quilt pictured in the color sec-
tion features hand quilting stitched 1⁄4 inch from the seam lines and a
decorative pattern in the large pink borders made by using a commercial
quilting template.
4. After you complete the quilting, machine stitch very close to the raw
edges of the quilt top, and trim away the excess batting and backing
that extends beyond the edges of the quilt top.
5. Bind the edges of the quilt with the off-white binding.

Traditional Basket Wall Hanging
This little wall hanging has a very traditional design style but is constructed
with a modern twist: The appliqué style mimics time-consuming hand appliqué,
but you actually use machine stitching and clear nylon monofilament. (If you
prefer to stitch the pieces in place by hand, refer to Chapter 10 for tips.)
This project looks best when made with random fabric scraps, but you can
easily change the colors to suit your own tastes or décor. And because it’s a
quick project to stitch up, you may want to consider making one for a friend!
The finished size of this wall hanging is approximately 24 x 24 inches.

Stashing your materials
Because this is a scrap-basket project, I list the following required fabrics
according to their measurements rather than yardage. If you can’t find the
right sized piece in your own scrap basket, I suggest raiding a friend’s stash.
 One 141⁄2- x 141⁄2-inch piece of light tan print fabric
 Two 11- x 11-inch pieces of dark blue print fabric
 Four 21⁄2- x 20-inch strips of red-checkered fabric
 Four 21⁄2- x 21⁄2-inch pieces of deep yellow print fabric
 One 12- x 12-inch piece of medium brown print fabric
 Two 3- x 5-inch pieces each of light green, medium green, and dark green
print or solid fabrics
 Four 5- x 7-inch pieces of print fabric in assorted colors
 Four 3- x 4-inch pieces of print fabric in assorted colors
 One 26- x 26-inch piece of coordinating fabric
 3 yards of navy blue quilt binding
 One 26- x 26-inch piece of low-loft batting
 All-purpose thread in assorted colors
 Clear nylon monofilament thread
 Wax-coated freezer paper
Creating appliqué shapes
Follow these steps to create the appliqué shapes featured in this project:
1. Using the appliqué shapes provided at the end of this project section,
trace six leaves, four flowers, four flower centers, and a basket onto
the unwaxed side of the freezer paper.
For the basket, join the basket handle to the basket base and then trace
it (not including the little tidbit hidden by the basket base). Reverse the
pattern and trace the other half of the basket so that you have the full
pattern (see Figure 15-20).
2. Cut out the freezer paper shapes with scissors.
Be sure to use the scissors reserved for paper or other uses — don’t use
your fabric-cutting scissors.
204
Part V: Completing the Circle: Projects to Try 

3. Start pressing with the waxed (shiny) side pressed to the wrong sides
of the fabrics (see Chapter 8 for more on pressing).
• Press the paper leaf shapes to the wrong sides of the light,
medium, and dark green fabrics.
• Press the paper flowers to the wrong sides of the 5- x 7-inch
assorted print fabrics.
• Press the paper flower centers to the wrong sides of the 
3- x 4-inch assorted print fabrics.
• Press the complete paper basket to the wrong side of the
medium brown print fabric.
To accommodate the turned under seam allowances you need when
appliquéing, be sure to leave at least 1⁄2 inch between the pieces.
4. Using fabric scissors, cut out each shape 1⁄4 inch to 1⁄2 inch from the
edges of the freezer paper.
If you’re uncomfortable with eyeballing this distance, feel free to draw a
line around each shape 1⁄4 inch to 1⁄2 inch from the edges of the paper.
5. To prepare the leaf, flower, and flower-center pieces for appliquéing,
fold the seam allowances to the wrong sides of the appliqué and
secure them in place with pins.
To accommodate the curves of your paper shape, notch the seam
allowance of the fabric so that you can fold it over the paper in sections.
Clipping small notches in the fabric gives you a smoother curve in the
fabric edges.

6. Starting with one appliqué, thread a hand-sewing needle with matching
all-purpose thread, and carefully stitch through the seam allowance
using a running stitch (see Figure 15-21). Pull the thread gently to
gather the seam allowance around the paper shape.
The running stitch should go through the seam-allowance fabric only —
not through the paper.
7. Repeat Step 6 with the remaining appliqué shapes.
8. Mist the shapes with a spray bottle containing water, and press them
until they’re dry.
9. Carefully peel the freezer paper from the appliqués, leaving the run-
ning stitches intact.
Refer to Chapter 10 for full coverage of the freezer-paper appliqué 
technique.
Appliquéing the shapes
Follow these steps to appliqué the shapes onto your quilt top:
1. Arrange the fabric appliqué shapes on the light tan print square, as

2. Pin or thread baste the bottommost layer of pieces in place on the tan
foundation to prepare them for machine appliqué.
3. Load light tan all-purpose thread in your sewing machine’s bobbin case,
and load clear nylon thread in the top of the machine. Set your machine
for the blind-stitch.
4. On a scrap of fabric, test sew a length of blind-stitch to make sure the
settings are right.
If you notice that the bobbin thread is being pulled to the top of the
fabric, loosen the tension of the upper thread slightly until the problem
is corrected.
5. Machine appliqué the pieces to the tan foundation fabric, adjusting
the fabric as necessary so that the straight-stitch portion of the stitch
is off the edge of the appliqué and the zigzag portion barely catches
the appliqué (see Figure 15-23).
Remember that you want to hide the stitches close up against the edge
of the appliqué. With hidden stitches in clear nylon thread, everyone will
think that you hand appliquéd the project, and you’ll be a quilting hero.
6. Repeat Steps 2 and 5 with each layer of appliqué pieces. After
appliquéing all your shapes in place, remove your pins or basting
stitches.

Assembling the quilt top
Follow these steps to assemble your quilt top:
1. Cut each of the two 11- x 11-inch dark blue print squares in half on the
diagonal. Fold each triangle in half, and press the fabric to mark the
center of the long bias edge.
You should end up with four large, folded triangles.
2. Fold the tan appliquéd square in half, and pinch the creases at the
edges. Unfold the square, fold it in half the other way, and pinch the
other two creases.
Pinching the creases temporarily marks the center point of each side of
the square.
3. Align the center of one side of the tan center square with the center
crease of a blue triangle from Step 1. Using a neutral shade of thread,
machine stitch the blue triangle to the side of the tan square.
4. Repeat Step 3 with the other three blue triangles; then press all the
seam allowances towards the blue fabric.
Your triangles may look a little rough or downright crooked, but that’s
okay. Because this may be the first time you’ve ever attempted this type of
medallion, I’ve padded the triangle measurements slightly to ensure you
end up with an accurate square. You’ll have a medallion larger than you
actually need and will trim down the excess at the sides in the next step.

extend just 1⁄4 inch from the corner points of the tan square, as
shown in Figure 15-24.
Stay squared by using your quilting ruler to make certain the sides are at
right angles to each other.
6. Measure the width of the entire quilt center, and trim the red-
checkered border strips to match your measurement.
7. Stitch red-checkered strips to the left- and right-hand sides of the quilt
center.
8. Stitch the 21⁄2-inch deep-yellow print squares to the short ends of the
two remaining red-checkered border strips, and press the seam
allowances toward the darker fabric.

Chicken Scratch Foundation-Pieced Quilt
Foundation piecing is a blast! I love the accuracy of this technique and the
ease with which you can construct small blocks — all without distortion.
Seeing as how the finished size of this quilt is only 20 x 25 inches, the blocks
are certainly small enough to make foundation piecing the way to go!
Another great thing about this quilt is that, with the exception of the borders
and backing, the whole thing’s made from scraps. So dig deep into your fabric
stash (you know you have one) — the more varied the fabrics, the better!

Creating the foundation-pieced blocks
If you’re new to foundation piecing, turn to Chapter 9 and read through my
explanation of the process. This piecing technique can sound a little confus-
ing to newcomers, but it’s really fun and surprisingly simple once you get the
hang of it. Follow these steps to create the pieced blocks in this quilt:
213
Chapter 15: Fabulous Skill Builders

1. Make 12 photocopies of the foundation pattern that appears at the end
of this project section. (You should be able to fit two pattern blocks
per sheet.) Cut out each block along the outermost solid line.
2. Starting at the center (piece 1) of one block, pin a tan or off-white
scrap, right side up, to the back side of the paper.
The scrap should be slightly larger than the lines that delineate piece 1.
3. With the paper side up, machine stitch the scrap to the paper, follow-
ing the piece 1 outline on the paper.
4. Repeat Steps 2 and 3 with the remaining pieces in the pattern, adding
any color scraps to each piece position in numbered order in any
color desired.
As you add pieces to the foundation, pin them together them right sides
facing, sew them together, and then press the seams open before adding
another piece, right sides facing.
5. Repeat Steps 2 through 4 with the remaining paper block patterns
until you have 12 foundation-pieced blocks.
6. Trim the blocks down to their finished size (41⁄2 inches square) along
the dashed line on the paper pattern. Carefully remove the paper
from the block, and press each block.
Creating the quilt center
To create the center portion of the Chicken Scratch quilt:
1. Stitch three blocks alternately with four vertical sashing strips to
make a row (see Figure 15-26). Press seam allowances toward the
sashing strips.
Repeat with the remaining blocks and vertical sashing strips. Make two
rows in which the blocks lean to the left and two rows in which the blocks
lean to the right.

In the first
row, three

214
Part V: Completing the Circle: Projects to Try 

2. Stitch the four rows alternately with the horizontal sashing strips to
make the center area (see Figure 15-27).
Alternate the rows so that the slant of the blocks switches from one row
to the next.
3. Stitch the side border strips to either side of the quilt center, as shown
in Figure 15-28. Trim any excess border fabric that extends beyond

Quilting your quilt
To finish your quilt:
1. Lay the quilt top facedown on your work surface. On top, place the
batting and backing fabric, right side up.
2. Thread or pin baste the layers together to prepare the project for
quilting (for a basting how-to, flip to Chapter 12).
3. Hand or machine quilt as desired.
For design ideas, turn to Chapter 11. The quilt pictured in the color sec-
tion features machine quilting in-the-ditch along all seam lines with clear
nylon monofilament.

Mixed-Technique Projects
In This Chapter
 Making floral appliqués bloom
 Piecing together some geometric shapes
M
y favorite things to design are mixed-technique quilts. I love mixing
piecing with hand or machine appliqué or hand or machine embroi-
dery. Mixing techniques gives projects a lot of character and makes them a
lot more fun (this tidbit coming from an author with a short attention span!).
In this chapter, I provide you with the instructions for several projects that
mix different hand and machine techniques.
Rosy Wreath Quilt
This fun and easy quilt combines strip-piecing, hand appliqué, and hand
embroidery, but don’t let the combination of techniques scare you! For exam-
ple, the strip-piecing is a breeze and is a great way to get comfortable with
your rotary cutter.
The relatively small size of this quilt — 39 x 39 inches — means it’s great as a lap
quilt, wall hanging, or even a child’s favorite blanket! Plus, this project works
up quickly and with little effort. After assembling the rose block units, prepare
the leaf shapes and take the project along on your commute or vacation —
the hand appliqué work is portable and easy to stitch on the run.
Stashing your materials
The following list covers the fabrics and notions you need to make the Rosy
Wreath Quilt:
 3⁄4 yard of white solid fabric
 1⁄3 yard of dark pink print fabric
 1⁄3 yard of medium pink print fabric

 1⁄2 yard of green print fabric
 1⁄3 yard of golden yellow print fabric
 One 45- x 45-inch piece of coordinating fabric
 One 45- x 45-inch piece of low- or traditional-loft quilt batting
 1⁄2 yard of 12-inch-wide, wax-coated freezer paper
 All-purpose thread in white and green
 Six-strand cotton embroidery floss in green
 5 yards of pink quilt binding
All seam allowances for this project are the standard 1⁄4 inch and are included
in the given measurements or directions.
Cutting out the pieces
For best results, use a rotary cutter and ruler to cut the pieces covered in this
section. Not only do you get more accurate cutting edges and more uniform
pieces, but you also save a tremendous amount of time!
Referring to the details provided in Table 16-1, cut the pieces needed to con-
struct the quilt top.

Creating the flower squares
The finished size of each flower block is 15 x 15 inches. Follow these steps to
create the flower squares:
1. Stitch one white foundation strip to the long side of one medium pink
petal strip, having their right sides together. Repeat with a second
white strip and the other medium pink strip. Do the same with the
remaining two white strips and the two dark pink petal strips. Press
all seam allowances toward the pink fabric.
You end up with two two-strip units of white and medium pink and two
two-strip units of white and dark pink.
2. Cut 16 21⁄2-inch pieces from each two-strip unit that you assembled in
Step 1 (see Figure 16-1).
These two-tone pieces are the petal units. You should have 32 units of
each color (medium and dark pink), each measuring 21⁄2 x 31⁄2 inches.
3. Stitch one yellow flower center to one of the dark pink petal units by
placing right sides together and stitching only halfway across the
yellow center square, as shown in Figure 16-2a. Press the yellow square
outwards to prepare it for the next petal, as shown in Figure 16-2b.

4. Stitch a medium pink petal piece to the resulting unit from Step 3, as
shown in Figure 16-3a, stitching down the entire length. Press the petal
unit outwards (see Figure 16-3b).
5. Stitch the third petal (dark pink) to the unit as shown in Figure 16-3c.
Press the new petal outwards.
6. Stitch the fourth and final petal (medium pink) to the unit by follow-
ing these steps:
1. Join the final petal to the third petal by stitching down the entire
length of the piece (see Figure 16-4a). Press the petal outwards
(see Figure 16-4b). The only unstitched area now runs along the
top of the first petal where it meets the fourth petal through to the
center square that you stitched halfway across in Step 3.
2. Fold the resulting unit in half horizontally (the top portion coming
down towards you), right sides facing.

Chapter 16: Mixed-Technique Projects

Creating the leaf squares
Like the flower blocks, the finished size of the leaf squares is 15 x 15 inches.
To create the leaf squares, follow these steps:
1. On 16 of the white leaf foundation blocks you cut according to Table
16-1, sketch the leaf shape and stem using the full-size pattern at the
end of this project section.
Use a water-soluble pencil or chalk, and trace very lightly.
2. Use the pattern at the end of this project to create two leaf templates
out of cardboard or plastic template sheeting; one template should be
the size of the dotted line, and the other template should be the size
of the solid line, which accounts for a seam allowance.
3. Using the solid-line template, trace 16 leaves onto the wrong side of the
remaining green print fabric. Cut out the leaves along the marked lines.
4. On the paper side (not the shiny side) of your freezer paper, trace the
dotted-line template to create 16 leaf shapes. Cut out the paper leaves
along the marked lines.
5. Iron one paper leaf shape, shiny (wax) side down, onto the wrong side
of each fabric leaf shape (as shown in Figure 16-6a).
When ironed, the wax coating sticks the paper to the fabric easily.
6. Fold the seam allowance (1⁄4 inch) over the paper on all the leaves, and
baste it by hand with a running stitch (see Figure 16-6b). Stitch only
through the seam allowance and not through the paper or the right
side of the leaves.
7. Gently pull your sewing thread to gather the seam allowance around
the paper shapes, so the seam allowance stays on the underside
(wrong side) of the leaves (see Figure 16-6c).
Press the leaves using a starch spray so that the folded edges hold a
nice crease.

Part V: Completing the Circle: Projects to Try 

8. Carefully remove the freezer paper from the center of the leaves.
Be gentle so as not to mess up the folded edges of the leaf shapes.
9. Using the lines you drew in Step 1 as a placement guide, pin a leaf to
each square.
If you don’t want to fiddle with pins, you may want to use a water-soluble
fabric glue such as Glue Baste to hold your leaves in place on the founda-
tion block. One or two dots of glue on each leaf is plenty.
10. Hand appliqué the leaves to the squares using matching thread and
the blind-stitch. To execute the blind-stitch,
1. Start from the back side of the foundation fabric, and bring your
needle up through the folded edge of the appliqué.
2. Insert the needle into the foundation fabric right next to the spot
where the thread came through the appliqué.
3. Slide the needle forward about 1⁄8 inch along the appliqué edge and
bring it back to the top of the piece, catching the edge of the appliqué
as you did in Step 1. In this manner, you’ve traveled 1⁄8 inch and
hidden the traveling portion of the thread on the wrong side of the
foundation block. Continue around the appliqué shape.
11. Cut a length of green six-strand embroidery floss (about as long as the
distance from your elbow to your fingertip). Divide the floss into two
lengths of three strands each, and thread a large-eyed needle with
one three-strand piece of floss. Set the other piece aside for when the
first runs out.
12. Use a stem-stitch (shown in Figure 16-7) to hand-embroider the stem
line and tendril designs:
1. Bring the needle through the quilt top fabric at the starting point of
your stem, and then insert the needle 1⁄8 inch or so from the starting
point, following the desired stem line.
2. Bring the needle up again through the fabric, halfway between the
spot where your thread came up originally and the spot where your
needle went back down.
3. Repeat along the stem and tendril markings.

Assembling the quilt top
After you work through the two preceding sections, you’re left with 16 petal
blocks and 16 leaf blocks. Now it’s time to stitch these pieces together —
along with a few others — to create the quilt top. To assemble the top, follow
these steps:
1. Stitch one flower square to either side of a plain white square, as
shown in Figure 16-8a. Orient the flower squares so that the medium
pink petals touch the white center square. Press the seam allowances
toward the white squares.
Do the same to the other three white squares, creating four units con-
sisting of two flower squares with a white square in between.

2. Stitch one leaf square to either side of one flower square, orienting
the leaf blocks so that the leaf on the left points up and the leaf on the
right points to the right, as shown in Figure 16-8b.
Do the same to the remaining flower squares, creating eight units con-
sisting of two leaf squares with a flower square in between.
3. Stitch one double-flower row alternately with two single-flower rows,
as shown in Figure 16-8c, to complete a wreath block.
Make four of these blocks.
4. To create a block row, alternate three vertical sashing strips with two
wreath blocks, as shown in Figure 16-9. Stitch everything together.
Do the same with the other two wreath blocks, giving you two wreath
block rows.
5. To complete the quilt center, alternate the two wreath block rows
with the three horizontal sashing strips, as shown in Figure 16-9.
Stitch everything together, and trim any excess sashing.
6. Stitch the golden yellow inner border strips to the quilt center, starting
with the upper and lower borders before attaching the side borders
(see Figure 16-10). Trim any excess. Press the seam allowances towards
the border fabrics.
7. Repeat with the green outer border strips (upper and lower strips
before sides) to complete the quilt top (see Figure 16-10).

Quilting and finishing your quilt
To finish your quilt:
1. Lay the quilt top facedown on your work surface. Lay the batting on
top of it, followed by the backing fabric, right side up.
2. Thread or pin baste the layers together to prepare it for quilting.
For a basting how-to, flip to Chapter 12.
3. Hand or machine quilt as desired.
For design ideas, turn to Chapter 11. On the quilt pictured in the color
section of this book, I stitched 1⁄2 inch from all seams and used free-motion
stipple quilting with clear nylon monofilament inside the blocks.
4. After you complete the quilting, stitch very close to the raw edges of the
quilt top, and trim away the batting and backing that extends beyond
the edges of the quilt top.
5. Bind the edges with the quilt binding to complete.

Scrappy Bloomers Wall 
Hanging or Lap Quilt
This section tells you everything you need to know to create my fun and color-
ful Scrappy Bloomers quilt. Machine blanket stitch appliqué makes this project
quick to construct, although if you prefer a portable project, you can certain do
the blanket stitch appliqué portion of the project by hand. The quilt’s finished
size — 35 x 42 inches — makes it versatile; you can display it as a decorative
wall hanging or use it as a cozy lap quilt.
One of the best things about this project is that it’s the perfect way to use up
all those scrap-basket fabrics you’ve been collecting that are just too pretty to
throw away. The maximum size of scrap material you need is a mere 5 inches
square, so pull out all those little bits and pieces!
To make your Scrappy Bloomers quilt even more interesting, swap scraps with
your friends or purchase a bunch of fat quarters to get a wide range of different
fabrics.
Don’t forget to prewash all fabrics before beginning this (or any) project.
For prewashing instructions, jump back to Chapter 3.
Stashing your materials
You need the following materials to create this quilt:
 3⁄4 yard of off-white fabric
 1⁄2 yard of multi-colored floral print fabric
 1⁄3 yard of blue floral print fabric
 1⁄3 yard of medium green fabric
 1⁄4 yard of solid tan fabric
 Twenty 5- x 5-inch (minimum) pieces of assorted medium-toned fabrics
 2 yards of 16- to 18-inch-wide paper-backed fusible webbing
 Twenty 6- x 6-inch pieces of tear-away stabilizer
 All-purpose thread in a neutral color, such as off-white
 Buttonhole-twist or topstitching thread in dark brown
 5 yards of off-white quilt binding, either premade or homemade accord-
ing to the instructions in Chapter 11
 One 37- x-44-inch piece of low-loft batting
 One 37- x 44-inch piece of coordinating fabric

Chapter 16: Mixed-Technique Projects
All seam allowances in this project are the standard 1⁄4 inch and are included
in all the given measurements. The appliqués don’t require seam allowances.
Preparing the appliqué pieces
The first step in creating the Scrappy Bloomers quilt is preparing the flower
appliqué shapes. The following steps explain this process:
1. Using the full-size appliqué patterns at the end of this project section
and a #2 pencil, trace 20 flowers, 20 centers, and 20 sets of leaves
(that’s 40 individual leaves) onto the paper side of the fusible webbing.
Because these flower pieces will be machine appliquéd onto foundation
blocks rather than pieced together, you don’t need to add seam
allowances when tracing the shapes.
2. Roughly cut out the fusible webbing pieces.
3. Using a hot iron, fuse the fusible webbing pieces to the wrong sides of
their respective fabrics.
For iron settings, refer to the insert that accompanied your brand of
fusible webbing, and fuse the leaf shapes to the green fabric, the flower
center shapes to the tan fabric, and the flower shapes to the assorted
scraps of fabric.
4. Cut out the webbing-backed fabric shapes, carefully following the
shape lines drawn on the fusible webbing in Step 1.
Appliquéing the quilt blocks
After you prepare your flower shapes, you’re ready to appliqué them to the
foundation quilt blocks. The following steps tell you how:
1. Referring to Table 16-2, cut out the pieces needed to put together the
quilt top.
The letters in Table 16-2 correspond to the labeled pieces in Figures 16-12
and 16-13. For this section, you only need the foundation blocks. Set aside
all the sashing and border pieces for now.

2. Lay out one 61⁄2-inch off-white block. On the foundation block, arrange
one flower, one flower center, and one set of leaves as shown in
Figure 16-11.
3. Remove the paper backing from the appliqué shapes, and reset them
in their spots. Use a hot iron to fuse the appliqués to the block. Repeat
with the remaining appliqués and blocks.
4. On each block, use a washable pencil or tailor’s chalk to draw a stem
connecting the flower to the leaves (see Figure 16-11).
You can draw the stem freehand or use a ruler.
5. Place a piece of stabilizer against the wrong side of each block. Use
straight pins to pin it in place at the corners.
6. Load brown buttonhole-twist thread in the upper part of your sewing
machine; wind a bobbin with neutral all-purpose thread, and insert it
in the machine’s bobbin case.
The top (buttonhole-twist) thread is the one that appears around each
appliqué as the top-stitching thread.
7. Test your machine’s blanket stitch by stitching on a scrap of fabric.
If the bobbin thread comes through the fabric and onto the top surface of
the scrap fabric, loosen the tension of the upper thread slightly (refer to
your machine’s owner’s manual for help making adjustments). Check out
Chapter 10 for more on getting the machine blanket stitch just right.
8. Machine appliqué each piece on each block using your machine’s
blanket stitch.
The machine blanket stitch adds a decorative accent to your appliqué
pieces.
9. Without changing the thread in your machine, stitch along each
block’s stem line with a straight stitch.

10. Remove the pins holding the stabilizer in place, and tear the stabilizer
away from the back of the appliquéd blocks.
Assembling the quilt top
To assemble the quilt top, collect your appliquéd quilt blocks and the sashing
strips you cut in the preceding section. Follow these steps to assemble the
quilt top:
1. Stitch five vertical sashing strips (A) alternately with four appliquéd
blocks to make a horizontal row, as shown in Figure 16-12. Press the
seam allowances toward the sashing strips. Repeat to make five rows.
2. Stitch the five rows alternately with the horizontal sashing strips (B) to
make the quilt center (see Figure 16-13). Press the seam allowances
toward the sashing strips.
3. Measure the quilt top from top to bottom edge, placing your measur-
ing tape down the center of the quilt as opposed to the sides. From the
blue floral fabric, cut two 11⁄2-inch-wide strips that are as long as your
measurement.
4. Stitch the strips from Step 3 to either side of the quilt center (see
Figure 16-13). Press the seam allowances toward the border fabric,
and trim the ends even with the quilt top.
5. Measure the quilt top from left to right edge, with the measuring tape
running across the center of the quilt. From the blue floral fabric, cut
two 11⁄2-inch-wide strips that are as long as your measurement.
6. Stitch the strips from Step 5 to the top and bottom edges of the quilt
center. Press the seam allowances toward the border fabric, and trim
the ends even with the outer edges of the vertical borders from Step 4.
7. Repeat Steps 3 through 6 with the multi-colored floral fabric, cutting
each strip 21⁄2 inches wide.

Snow Crystals Lap Quilt
Speedy rotary-cutter techniques (covered in Chapter 8) and machine blanket
stitch appliqué (covered in Chapter 10) make this quilt quicker to assemble
than it appears. And because it’s not very large (46 x 46 inches), the process
goes even quicker!
If you don’t care much for the look of blanket stitch, try satin stitch appliqué
instead. For other appliqué stitching ideas, refer to Chapter 10. Just keep in
mind that for speed, blanket stitch beats satin stitch.
Stashing your materials
You need the following materials to complete your Snow Crystals project:
 23⁄4 yards of blue print or solid fabric
 11⁄4 yards of white solid fabric
 3⁄4 yard of golden yellow print or solid fabric
 11⁄2 yards of 16- to 18-inch-wide paper-backed fusible webbing
 Nine 10- x 10-inch squares of tear-away stabilizer
 One 50- x 50-inch square of low-loft batting
 One 50- x 50-inch square of coordinating fabric
 All-purpose thread in blue, white, and golden yellow
 Buttonhole-twist thread in golden yellow
 51⁄2 yards of white bias binding
Preparing the appliqué pieces
The first step in creating the Snow Crystals Lap Quilt is preparing the
snowflake appliqué shapes. The following steps explain this process:
1. Using the pattern provided at the end of this project section and
a #2 pencil, trace nine snowflake shapes on the paper side of the
fusible webbing.
Because you fuse these shapes onto foundation blocks and use machine
appliqué, the snowflakes don’t require seam allowances.
236
Part V: Completing the Circle: Projects to Try 

2. Roughly cut out the fusible webbing pieces.
3. Using a hot iron, fuse the fusible webbing pieces to the wrong side of
the white fabric, spacing them 1⁄4 inch apart.
For the appropriate iron setting, refer to the insert that accompanied
your brand of fusible webbing.
4. Cut out the webbing-backed snowflake shapes, carefully following the
lines drawn on the webbing in Step 1.
Appliquéing the snowflakes
To create the striking snowflake blocks that make up the quilt top, follow
these steps:
1. Referring to Table 16-3, cut out all the pieces needed for the project.
Avoid the need to piece any borders together by cutting the pieces in the
order they’re listed in the table. To be sure that you have enough fabric
for this project, cut out all the pieces across the width of the fabric (from
selvage to selvage). For instance, for the C strips, cut three 21/2- x 44-inch
strips of fabric, and then recut each 44-inch strip into 101⁄2-inch lengths
(you’ll get four C strips for each strip of fabric that you cut this way).

2. Remove the paper backings from the snowflakes made in the preced-
ing section, and fuse one snowflake to the center of each 101⁄2-inch
blue block.
3. Pin a piece of tear-away stabilizer to the back side of each snowflake
block to prepare it for machine appliqué. Position the pins so that
they won’t interfere with your stitching — about 1⁄2 inch from the
appliqués is a good distance.
The tear-away stabilizer keeps the block from being shoved down into
the machine’s throat plate and jammed by the actions of the needle and

4. Load the top of the machine with golden yellow buttonhole-twist
thread. Use blue or white all-purpose thread in the bobbin case.
5. Using a scrap of fabric, test your machine’s blanket stitch (see
Figure 16-14) by sewing a bit and making setting adjustments.
You want to be certain that your machine is making a well-formed blanket
stitch before you begin your machine appliqué — it’s better to test now
than to rip out the threads later! If you notice that the bobbin thread is
being pulled through the fabric onto the top surface, slightly loosen the
tension for the upper thread. If you find yourself encountering difficulty,
refer to Chapter 10 and consult your machine’s owner’s manual.
6. When you’re comfortable with the blanket stitch, machine appliqué the
snowflakes to the blocks by blanket stitching along the outer edges of
the snowflake shape. Remove the stabilizer when you finish.

Assembling the quilt top
Follow these steps to assemble the top of your quilt:
1. Fold each of the snowflake border strips (E) in half lengthwise, wrong
sides facing, and press them (see Figure 16-15).
2. Place one pressed E strip along one edge of the front side of a snowflake
appliqué block, aligning the double raw edges of the strip with the
raw edge of the block. Using matching all-purpose thread, stitch the
strip in place using slightly less than a 1⁄4-inch seam allowance, and
then trim the excess strip at either end, as shown in Figure 16-16.
Repeat on the opposite side of the block, and then add strips in the
same manner to the two remaining sides of the block.
Note: Although Figure 16-16 shows a block minus the snowflake appliqué
to cut the clutter, you’re stitching these yellow border strips to the front
side of your snowflake blocks.

Chapter 16: Mixed-Technique Projects

3. Repeat Step 2 for each of the nine snowflake blocks.
4. Stitch three bordered snowflake blocks alternately with four vertical
sashing strips (C) to make one row, as shown in Figure 16-17. Press
the seam allowances toward the sashing strips, and trim any excess
from the strips.
Repeat with the other blocks and strips to make three rows.
5. Stitch the three rows alternately with four blue horizontal sashing
strips (B) to make the quilt center (see Figure 16-18). Press the seam
allowances toward the sashing, trim any excess, and set the quilt
top aside.
6. On the wrong side of the white 14 x 29-inch rectangle (D-2), mark
a grid pattern of 36 27⁄8-inch squares. Mark a diagonal line through
each square, as shown in Figure 16-19.
7. Place the marked white piece and the unmarked blue rectangle (D-1)
together with right sides facing, and pin them together to keep them
from shifting during sewing.
One pin placed in the center of every few triangles is plenty.

8. Stitch 1⁄4 inch away from each side of the marked diagonal lines, as
shown in Figure 16-20.
9. Following your marked grid lines, cut out the individual squares (see
Figure 16-21a), and then cut each square in half along its (unstitched)
diagonal line, as shown in Figure 16-21b.
10. Open all the triangles to reveal two-color squares (see Figure 16-21c).
The stitch or two at the tip of the triangle point should pop right off
when you open the triangles. Press the seam allowances toward the
blue fabric.
I refer to these two-color squares as half-square units because they’re
made from half of a square. (Some books call them half-triangles.)
You should end up with a total of 72 half-square units.
11. Stitch nine half-square units together to form a strip. As you can see
in Figure 16-22, all the units should be facing the same direction
(with the blue triangle in the bottom-left corner). Press all seam
allowances toward the blue fabric.
Make four of these nine-unit strips.

the quilt center.
15. Stitch golden-yellow squares (F) to either end of the two strips remaining
from Step 13, as shown in Figure 16-25, and press the seam allowances
toward the golden yellow square. Stitch these two strips to the remain-
ing two sides of the quilt center.
16. Stitch one blue outer border strip (A) to the top edge of the quilt
center and one strip to the bottom edge.
17. Stitch a golden-yellow square (F) to each end of the remaining two outer
border strips (A), and stitch these strips to the remaining two sides of
the quilt center. Press all seam allowances toward the blue borders.
Quilting and finishing the project
Follow these steps to complete your quilt:
1. Lay the quilt top facedown on your work surface. On top, place the
batting followed by the backing fabric (right side up).
2. Thread or pin baste the layers together to prepare it for quilting.
Check out Chapter 12 for basting instructions.
3. Hand or machine quilt as desired.
For design ideas, turn to Chapter 11. On the sample quilt that appears in
the color insert, I stitched around the snowflakes using free-motion stip-
pling, quilted the borders with a decorative pattern, stitched 1⁄4 inch from
the sawtooth border seams, and channel-quilted the outermost border,
all with clear nylon monofilament.
4. Machine straight stitch close to the raw edges of the quilt top (about
1⁄4 inch from the edge), and trim away the batting and backing fabric
that extends from beyond the edges of the quilt top.

Winter Holly Lap Quilt or Wall Hanging
Feeling festive? Here’s an easy-yet-elegant project to make for the winter holi-
days. Pieced holly leaves are combined with big appliquéd bows in bright
red, and the blocks are accented with big red buttons to add a festive touch.
The 36- x 36-inch finished size of this project makes it perfect for draping over
a chair or sofa, and because it’s square in shape, it also makes a lovely table
centerpiece.
Use an assortment of green fat quarters to give your quilt a charming, old-
fashioned look. You can even use this pattern to create a charm quilt by 
trading green fabric pieces with your friends and using a different green for
each leaf. Or if you prefer more of an engineered look, select only two green
fabrics — a light and a dark — and use one on the left side and one on the
right side of each holly leaf. Whatever your choice, this quilt’s a stunner!
Stashing your materials
You need the following materials for the Winter Holly project:
 1 yard of cream fabric
 At least six different fat quarters of green print fabrics (the more variety
the better!)
 1⁄2 yard of red print fabric
 1 yard of paper-backed fusible webbing
 One 40- x 40-inch piece of coordinating fabric
 One 40- x 40-inch piece of traditional or lightweight batting
 All-purpose threads in cream, green, and red
 41⁄2 yards of dark green quilt binding
 One 7⁄8-inch red button
 Four 3⁄4-inch red buttons
Cutting out the pieces
Follow these steps to cut out all the pieces you need for this project:
1. Using the patterns at the end of this project section, create templates
for the full-size leaf and bow patterns.

4. Use the leaf template to cut a total of 48 pieces from your green fabrics.
To speed up this step, cut your green fabrics into 2-inch-wide strips of
any length. Stack the strips as shown in Figure 16-27, and cut through all
the layers at once using your rotary cutter and see-through ruler. (Place
your template under the see-through ruler to give you the right shape.)
5. Using your template and a #2 pencil, trace four bow shapes onto the
paper side of the fusible webbing.
6. Lay out the red fabric remaining after you cut the border strips called
for in Table 16-4. Fuse the four bow shapes to the wrong side of this
fabric, and then cut them out neatly with your fabric-only scissors.
Creating holly blocks
The Winter Holly quilt is made up of holly blocks with a finished size of 81⁄2 x
81⁄2 inches. Follow these steps to assemble the blocks:
1. Assemble a leaf section by stitching one cream triangle to the shorter
side of a green leaf piece (see Figure 16-28) with cream thread.
Create 48 of these leaf sections.
2. Stitch two leaf sections together, green pieces together, to form a leaf
square (see Figure 16-29).

Create 24 leaf squares. It doesn’t matter which green fabrics you stitch
together to form the leaf squares. The squares can be as scrappy or as
orderly as you like.
3. Assemble the three blocks shown in Figure 16-30 (for the sake of con-
venience, I call them Blocks 1, 2, and 3):
• Block 1: Make Block 1 by stitching four leaf squares together so
that the green leaves form an X shape. Block 1 is the center block
of the quilt, so you only need to make one.
• Block 2: Make Block 2 by stitching two leaf squares together and
then stitching the two-leaf unit to one cream I piece. Block 2 goes
in the center of each side, so you need four of these blocks.
• Block 3: Make Block 3 by stitching two leaf squares together and
then stitching one leaf square to one cream J piece. Stitch the two-
leaf unit to the one-leaf unit to make a block. Block 3 goes in each
corner of the quilt top, so you need four of these blocks.

Appliquéing the bows
Red bows add festive decoration to this quilt design. Follow these steps to
appliqué the bows on your quilt top:
1. Remove the paper backing from the bow shapes (created in the sec-
tion “Cutting out the pieces” earlier in this project section), and fuse
one bow to each corner block of your quilt.
As shown in Figure 16-33, the loops of the bow should overlap some
sashing and two of the leaf blocks slightly, with the bow’s ends dangling
toward the center holly block. (See Chapter 10 for more on using fusible
webbing.)
2. Machine appliqué the bows in place using red all-purpose thread and
a medium-width machine satin stitch.
Quilting and finishing the project
Follow these steps to finish your project:
1. Lay the quilt top facedown on your work surface. On top, place the
batting and backing fabric (right side up).
2. Thread or pin baste the layers of the quilt sandwich together to pre-
pare your project for quilting.
Check out Chapter 12 for basting instructions.
3. Hand or machine quilt as desired.
I machine quilted the sample in this book’s color insert in a large, mean-
dering stipple pattern, but you’re free to choose another approach.
You may want to do some echo quilting around the shapes or go
with a straight line grid pattern. For more ideas, turn to Chapter 11.
4. Machine straight stitch 1⁄8 inch from the raw edges of the quilt top, and
trim away the excess batting and backing fabric that extends beyond
the edges of the quilt top.
5. Bind the quilt with the green binding.
For a refresher on how to apply premade binding or make your own,

6. Hand stitch the large red button to the center holly block with red
thread. Stitch the smaller buttons to the center-side squares in the
same manner — they’re the holly berries!

ur ancestors may have spent hours and hours hand piecing quilts, but
quilt makers today have the wonderful option of using a sewing machine.
It’s one of the best things ever invented, in my opinion!
Using the sewing machine to create quilts saves you time, allows for very
accurate piecing methods, and is a lot of fun, especially when you start play-
ing around with decorative stitches. In this chapter, I show you ways of using
your machine to its best advantage by giving you projects that involve speed-
piecing and decorative stitching techniques.
Get to know your machine well. It’s sure to become your new best quilting
friend.
Pieced Flower Pots Wall Hanging
Not all quilt blocks are square! This just-too-easy pieced flower pot quilt is a
beginner’s dream. It looks involved, but it’s actually very simple to construct
because it’s made of only strips and squares — no triangles with bias edges to
worry about. Also, because this wall hanging is relatively small (the finished
size is only 25 x 33 inches), you shouldn’t feel overwhelmed by the time com-
mitment necessary to turn out a great result.
To speed up the cutting process, use your rotary cutter, and when stitching,
be sure to keep your 1⁄4-inch seam allowance accurate.

Stashing your materials
You need the following materials to complete the Pieced Flower Pots Wall
Hanging:
 1 yard of green print fabric
 1⁄2 yard of tan print fabric
 1⁄3 yard of blue print fabric
 1⁄3 yard of yellow print fabric
 1⁄4 yard of peach print fabric
 1⁄2 yard of rust print fabric
 One 28- x 36-inch piece of coordinating fabric
 One 28- x 36-inch piece of low-loft cotton or polyester quilt batting
 4 yards of quilt binding in a coordinating color
 All-purpose thread in a neutral color such as off-white
Cutting the pieces
As you can see in the color insert photo, this quilt consists of a lot of pieces.
So before you can do anything else, you have to cut. Follow the cutting
instructions in Table 17-1 to produce all the pieces you need for assembly.
Some pieces are labeled with letters that correspond to figures in the assem-
bly section; for now, you don’t need to pay attention to those labels.

Assembling the pieced blocks
To assemble the four blocks of this quilt (each of which has a finished size of
9 x 13 inches), you make two blocks in each colorway, or color arrangement.
One colorway consists of a block with two yellow flowers and one blue
flower (Block 1), and the second colorway is the opposite — a block with
two blue flowers and one yellow (Block 2). This quilt has two blocks of each
colorway.
All seam allowances are 1⁄4 inch and are included in the given measurements.
Press all the seam allowances toward the darker color.
Follow these steps to assemble your flower blocks:
1. To make row 1 (the top row) of Block 1, stitch together one blue D
square to two tan A strips, as shown in Figure 17-1. Repeat with the
second colorway for Block 2, using the yellow D square. Make two
strips of each colorway.
2. To make row 2 of Block 1, stitch together two tan B pieces, two blue
C strips, and one yellow C strip in the order shown in Figure 17-2a.
Reverse the blue and yellow colorway for Block 2, as shown in
Figure 17-2b. Make two of each strip.

3. For row 3 of Block 1, stitch together two tan C strips, two yellow D
squares, two tan D squares, and one blue D square in the order shown
in Figure 17-3 (the blue D square should be in the center). Make two
of this row, and then reverse the blue and yellow colorway and make
two more rows for Block 2.
4. For row 4 of Block 1, stitch together the following C strips in the
order shown in Figure 17-4a: three tan, four yellow, and two blue.
Make two rows like this, and then reverse the blue and yellow 
colorway (see Figure 17-4b) and make two more rows for Block 2.

1. Lay the quilt top facedown on your work surface. On top, lay the bat-
ting and backing fabric (right side up).
2. Thread or pin baste the layers together to prepare it for quilting (for a
basting how-to, flip to Chapter 12).
3. Hand or machine quilt as desired.
For design ideas, turn to Chapter 11. The quilt that appears in the color
insert features stipple quilting in the background space, echo quilting in
the flower pots, and straight-line designs.
4. Machine stitch close to the outside edges of the quilt top, and trim
away the excess batting and backing fabric that extends beyond the
edges of the quilt top.
5. Finish the quilt by stitching the quilt binding around the edges.

Pieced Blossoms Lap Quilt
The interesting thing about the Pieced Blossoms project is that it has a “con-
trolled” scrappy look to it. It has a lot of fabric variety to catch the eye, but
everything comes together in a neat and orderly pattern. You can stitch this
quilt in a multitude of bright, cheery spring pastels or perhaps choose some
spunky primary tones for a real splash of color. For best results, I suggest
using a multitude of different pink fabrics — the more the better!
This quilt utilizes template-free rotary cutting techniques (see Chapter 8),
which means you can complete the project quickly and effortlessly. (The fin-
ished size of this quilt — 36 x 51 inches — makes it easy-to-manage as well.)
Although you trim and discard small bits of fabric, this quilt is not at all
wasteful, and you’ll love the speed-piecing techniques. No need to trace
tedious pattern pieces with this one!
This is a great project on which to use fat quarters (those precut 18- x 22-inch
nuggets of lovely fabric available in fabric and quilting stores) from your
fabric stash (don’t deny it — I know you have a fabric stash!). The yardage
requirements listed in the next section are approximate due to the fact that
you may want to add to or scale down the number of pinks in the project
according to your own preferences.
263
Chapter 17: Projects for the Machine Queen

Stashing your materials
You need the following materials for the Pieced Blossoms Lap Quilt:
 3⁄4 yard of off-white solid fabric
 1⁄2 yard of multicolored print or floral fabric
 1⁄4 yard each of six to eight different shades of pink print fabric 
(fat quarters are okay)
 1⁄4 yard each of six to eight different shades of green print fabric 
(fat quarters are okay)
 Scraps of assorted yellow prints (as many as you would like)
 1⁄3 yard of yellow print fabric
 One 40- x 55-inch piece of coordinating fabric
 One 40- x-55-inch piece of quilt batting, any loft except high-loft
 All-purpose threads in off-white, pink, green, and yellow
 6 yards of green quilt binding
All seam allowances are 1⁄4 inch and are included in all given measurements
and directions.
Cutting the pieces
For best results, use a rotary cutter and ruler to cut the pieces. Not only will
you get more accurate cutting edges, but you’ll also save a tremendous amount
of time!
1. Referring to Table 17-2, cut the strips for the borders and sashing, and
then set them aside.

2. Referring to Table 17-3, cut the pieces for the blocks.
Each block requires two different shades of pink and green, so you need to
plan out your fabric design for each block before you cut. In Figure 17-13,
I broke down one block into individual units (all labeled to match the table)
so you can get a better visual idea of the pieces you need for each block.
Note: In the “Piece” column of Table 17-3, I’ve labeled the two different
pink fabrics in each block pink 1 and pink 2. For one block, cut two pieces
for pink 1 from one pink fabric, and cut two pieces for pink 2 from a
second pink fabric. Each block can feature different pink 1 and 2 fabrics,
or you can reuse pink fabrics in multiple blocks (as long as pink 1 and 2
remain different from one another).

Creating the petal blocks
With all the block pieces cut, it’s time to stitch them together into flower
blocks. The finished size of each block is 8 x 13 inches.
Throughout the assembly stage, always press seam allowances toward the
darker fabric unless the instructions say otherwise.
1. On the wrong side of each off-white G and H square, mark a diagonal
line, as shown in Figure 17-15.
Do not cut this line! It’s actually a stitching line.
2. Place a marked H piece on one corner of each pink I piece, right sides
facing (see Figure 17-16).
3. Stitch along the diagonal line of each H piece. Trim the excess from
the corners, 1⁄4 inch from the stitching lines as shown in Figure 17-16,
and press the corners open to make square petal units.
You should end up with 18 of these petal units.

Chapter 17: Projects for the Machine Queen

4. Repeat Steps 2 and 3 using the pink J pieces and the remaining
H pieces.
You should end up with 18 of these petal units.
5. Stitch one off-white G piece to one pink K piece, stitching along the
marked line on the wrong side of the G piece (see Figure 17-17a).
Trim the corner excess 1⁄4 inch from the stitching line, and discard.
Press the unit open.
Make 18 of these right-facing petal strips. (By right-facing, I mean that the
pink fabric runs from top to bottom on the right-hand side of the strip.)
6. With the remaining G and K pieces, repeat Step 5 with a slight variation:
The diagonal stitching line should run from the upper-left to lower-right
corners, as shown in Figure 17-17b.
Make 18 of these left-facing petal strips. (By left-facing, I mean that the
pink fabric runs from top to bottom on the left-hand side of the strip.)
7. Repeat Steps 5 and 6 with the pink L strips and the remaining G
squares.
As Figure 17-18 shows, you should end up with 18 left-facing petal strip
units for both pink 1 and pink 2, and 18 right-facing petal strip units for
both pink 1 and pink 2 (that’s 36 left and 36 right).

8. Stitch a yellow M square to the bottom edge of every right-facing petal
strip (see Figure 17-19). Press open.
9. As shown in Figure 17-20, stitch a left-facing petal strip to each petal
unit that you made in Steps 2 through 4. Then stitch a strip from Step 8
to the piece you’ve just created.
Be sure to stitch petal strips from pink 1 to the petal units from pink 1
and vice versa, so that each petal block contains only one pink fabric.
The petal blocks in Figure 17-20 may look like they’re put together differ-
ently, but they’re actually just the same block rotated a 1⁄4 turn. So you
can assemble all the petal blocks in the same manner and then adjust
their layout to get the right look.

Joining petals to make flower blocks
Each flower block in the Pieced Blossoms project contains four petal blocks.
This section covers instructions for flower block assembly, including the leaf
portion of each block.
1. Stitch two petal blocks of each fabric together to form a flower block, as
shown in Figure 17-21, and press the seams. Make nine of these flowers.
2. Referring to Figure 17-22, stitch four green O triangles to four green P
triangles to form leaf tips.

6. Repeat Steps 2 through 5 to create nine leaf units.
7. Stitch the nine completed leaf units to the nine completed flower
blocks (see Figure 17-26) to make the nine full flower blocks that
form the quilt top.
Assembling the quilt top
With nine full flower blocks ready and waiting, all that’s left to do is add sash-
ing and border strips to make the full quilt top.
1. Stitch three full flower blocks alternately with four vertical sashing
strips (E) (see Figure 17-27). Press seam allowances toward the sashing
strips. Make three of these flower block rows.
2. Stitch three block rows alternately with four horizontal sashing strips
(F) to make the quilt center, shown in Figure 17-28.
3. Stitch the inner side borders (C) to the sides of the quilt center. Stitch
the remaining inner border strips (D) to the top and bottom of the
quilt center.
4. Repeat Step 3 with the outer borders (A and B).

batting and backing (right side up).
2. Thread or pin baste the layers together to prepare it for quilting (for a
basting how-to, flip to Chapter 12).
3. Hand or machine quilt as desired.
For design ideas, turn to Chapter 11. The quilt that appears in the color
insert features in-the-ditch quilting in the full flower blocks and stipple
quilting in the background space, which gives the quilt a nice texture.
4. Machine stitch close to the raw edges of the quilt top. Trim away any
batting and backing that extends beyond the edges of the quilt top.
5. Bind the quilt with the green quilt binding to complete the project.

Americana Appliqués Banner
This project utilizes strip quilting and rotary cutting (see Chapter 8) and is a
fabulous skill-builder if you’re new to either technique. Strip quilting is a huge
timesaver for quilters! Instead of cutting out individual squares of fabric
and stitching them together, you cut strips of fabric to the proper width and
then sew them together along their long sides to make a multi-colored strip.
Row 1
Row 2
Row 3
Figure 17-28:

Part V: Completing the Circle: Projects to Try 

Then you simply cut the strip into the proper-sized units — no muss, no fuss!
This technique also allows for greater accuracy and is a fabulous way to make
checkered strips or other sections of a quilt made from multiple small squares
or stripes.
Another fun thing about this project is that except for the backing fabric, it’s
made entirely from fat quarters, those delightful 18- x 22-inch cuts of yardage
that abound in all sorts of colors and patterns at any quilting or fabric store.
This project gives you a good excuse to stock up on fat quarters in red, off-
white, and blue!
The finished size of this project is 20 x 20 inches, making it the perfect patri-
otic decoration for your home. Bring it out for the Fourth of July, or leave it
out year-round and admire your handiwork.
Stashing your materials
The following list covers the fabrics and special notions you need to make
the Americana Appliqués Banner:
 One fat quarter of light blue print fabric
 One fat quarter of off-white print fabric (off-white 1)
 One fat quarter of a different off-white print fabric (off-white 2)
 One fat quarter of medium blue print fabric
 One fat quarter of red print fabric (red 1)
 One fat quarter of a different red print fabric (red 2)
 One fat quarter of golden tan print fabric
 One 24- x 24-inch piece of coordinating fabric
 One 24- x 24-inch piece of low-loft quilt batting
 1⁄4 yard paper-backed fusible webbing
 Five natural-colored buttons, 1⁄2-inch in size
 All-purpose thread in off-white
 21⁄2 yards of off-white quilt binding
All seam allowances are the standard 1⁄4 inch and are included in the given
measurements and directions.

Cutting out the pieces
Follow the cutting instructions in Table 17-4 to produce all the pieces you
need to assemble the Americana Appliqués quilt top.
Rotary cutting is definitely the way to go with this project. It saves you lots of
time and energy and ensures that you get accurate, straight cuts — especially
in the striped areas.

Creating the quilt center
Follow these steps to create both the outer accent stripes and the center of
the quilt design:
1. Stitch the red 1 and off-white 1 border strips together alternately along
their long sides to form a striped rectangle of fabric. Press the seam
allowances toward the red fabric.
2. Using your rotary cutter, ruler, and mat, cut four 41⁄2-inch-wide stripe
units from the rectangle, as shown in Figure 17-29.
3. Using the template provided at the end of this project, trace five star
shapes onto the paper side of the fusible webbing. Cut the shapes out
roughly.
4. Using a hot iron (and following the instructions that came with the
webbing), fuse the webbing stars to the wrong side of the golden
tan fabric. Cut them out neatly.
276
Part V: Completing the Circle: Projects to Try 

5. Arrange one star on each of the five light blue squares. Peel the
paper backing from the shapes, and fuse the stars to the squares
with a hot iron.
6. Using the all-purpose thread and a medium-width machine satin
stitch, appliqué the stars to the squares.
For a review of appliqué techniques, turn to Chapter 10. For a different
look, you may want to try a raw-edge appliqué, which allows the edges
of the shape to fray slightly. Simply stitch around the appliqués 1⁄8 to 
1⁄4 inch from the edges by hand with a running stitch or by machine with a
straight stitch. This fast and easy appliqué technique gives this project a
down-home look.
7. Pin the light blue and red 2 51⁄2 x 101⁄2-inch rectangles together, right
sides facing. Using your ruler and a water-soluble pencil, mark two
47⁄8-inch squares on the light blue piece. Draw a diagonal line through
each square.
8. Stitch 1⁄4 inch from either side of the marked diagonal line, as shown
in Figure 17-30.
9. Cut out the squares along the marked lines, and cut along the diago-
nal marked lines to produce four double triangles. Open each double
triangle to reveal a two-tone square (see Figure 17-30). Press the
seams toward the red fabric.
10. Stitch the medium blue and off-white 2 inner stripes together along
their long sides. Cut the resulting strip into four inner-stripe units
measuring 41⁄2 inches wide (see Figure 17-31).
Figure 17-29:

Chapter 17: Projects for the Machine Queen

11. Stitch two-tone squares from Step 9 to either side of two inner-stripe
unit as shown in the top and bottom strips of Figure 17-32.
The two-tone squares should be oriented so that the light blue triangles
are in the outer corners of the strip, and the inner-stripe unit should be
oriented with the off-white portion on top. Make two of these strips.
12. Stitch inner-stripe units to two opposing sides of one star block
(see the center strip in Figure 17-32).
The inner-stripe units should be oriented so that the stripe runs verti-
cally, with the blue portions touching the star block.

13. Stitch the three strips made in Steps 11 and 12 together alternately to
make the center block (see the center portion of Figure 17-33).
The strip with the star in it should be in the middle, bordered above and
below by the two other strips. The outer strips should be oriented so
that the star block is surrounded by blue pieces.
14. Stitch two border stripe units made in Steps 1 and 2 to the left and
right edges of the center block made in Step 13 (see Figure 17-33).
Orient the border stripes as follows: The stripe on the left should have a
red piece at the top and an off-white piece at the bottom, and the stripe
on the right should be the reverse.
15. Stitch one star square to each end of the remaining two border stripe
units made in Steps 1 and 2.
16. Referring to Figure 17-33 for orientation, stitch the star/stripe borders
to the upper and lower edges of the quilt center.

Scrappy Pines Lap or Nap Quilt
I love scrap basket projects! They have such a warm and inviting look to
them. And when you use the scrappy approach on a perfect nap-sized quilt
(such as this one, which has a finished size of 50 x 79 inches), you’ve got a
snuggly combination. Pull lots of different green and brown fabrics from your
stash to make this Scrappy Pines quilt. If you find yourself low on a particular
color, trade fabrics with a friend or stock up on an assortment of fat quarters
while they’re on sale at your favorite fabric store.
A unique feature of this quilt is that it allows you to play with some of your
sewing machine’s decorative or utility stitches. If you haven’t played around
with these stitches yet, refer to your owner’s manual for instructions on set-
ting up the machine for decorative stitching. Of course, you can substitute
satin stitch appliqué for the decorative stitching, if desired, but feel free to
experiment with your machine’s stitch repertoire!

Appliquéing the tree blocks
The finished size of each tree block is 6 x 10 inches. Because the trees are
appliqué pieces, you don’t have to be concerned with seam allowances in
the following steps.
1. Using the template provided at the end of this project, trace 20 tree
tops (minus the trunks) on the paper side of the fusible webbing.
Cut out the shapes roughly. Repeat with the trunks.
2. Using a hot iron, fuse the tree tops to the wrong sides of the assorted
green fabrics. Cut out the shapes neatly.
3. Repeat Step 2 with the trunk shapes and the assorted brown fabrics.
4. Remove the paper backings from the appliqués, and center one tree
and one trunk on each of the 20 assorted tan rectangles.
Tuck the top edge of the trunk just under the tree bottom to conceal the
raw edge.
5. Use a hot iron to fuse the tree and trunk pieces in place on the blocks.
Refer to the insert that accompanied your fusible webbing for iron settings.
6. Pin a piece of tear-away stabilizer to the wrong side of each tree block.
Place the pins at the corners to keep them away from the stitching areas.
7. Using brown all-purpose thread, machine appliqué the trunks in place
on all blocks using a variety of decorative or utility stitches. Change the
thread to green, and repeat with the trees.
8. Remove the pins, and tear away the paper stabilizer from the blocks.
Assembling the quilt top
After you cut and appliqué all the tree blocks, you need to stitch the blocks
together and assemble the quilt top:
1. Stitch two side block border strips to each tree block. Press the seam
allowances toward the rust strips.
2. Stitch two upper and lower block borders to each tree blocks, and
press the seam allowances toward the rust strips.
3. Stitch five vertical sashing strips alternately with four appliquéd blocks
to make a row, as shown in Figure 17-34. Make five of these rows.
4. Stitch five tree block rows alternately with six horizontal sashing
strips to make the quilt center (see Figure 17-35).

Chapter 17: Projects for the Machine Queen

5. Stitch the green side borders to the sides of the quilt center (see
Figure 17-36), and press the seam allowances toward the green fabric.
6. Stitch the green upper and lower borders to the top and bottom edges
of the quilt center (see Figure 17-36), and press the seam allowances
toward the green fabric.
Quilting and finishing your quilt
To finish your quilt:
1. Lay the quilt top facedown on your work surface. On top, place the
batting and backing fabric (right side up).

2. Thread or pin baste the layers together to keep them from shifting
during quilting (for a basting how-to, flip to Chapter 12),
3. Hand or machine quilt as desired.
For design ideas, turn to Chapter 11. The quilt that appears in the color
insert features in-the-ditch quilting in clear nylon monofilament along all
seam lines. I also stitched around the trees close to the edges, but echo
quilting would be really nice around the trees as well. The border was
quilted using a purchased quilting template with a wavy pattern.
4. Machine stitch close to the raw edges of the quilt top, and trim away
the excess batting and backing fabric that extends beyond the edges
of the quilt top.
5. Bind the quilt with the rust-colored quilt binding to complete it.
For a refresher on how to apply premade binding or make your own,
check out Chapter 14.

N
ot all quilted projects have to be big enough to cover your bed. You can
use quilting techniques to create useful objects to be enjoyed every day
in other areas of the home as well. In this chapter, I give you some small-scale
projects that you can make for the kitchen or to display in another room of
your home.
These small projects use many of the same techniques as large-scale projects,
including precision machine piecing or appliqué techniques; the only real dif-
ference is that here they’re used on smaller items. Because of their size, these
can be great take-along projects while traveling or commuting, too!
Appliquéd Bluebirds Breakfast Set
This plump little bluebird adds cheer to four different projects. Three are
absolute no-brainers because they use premade items! All the projects in this
breakfast set prove that you can appliqué on many different objects. And the
bluebird’s rounded curves give you ample practice on mastering machine
satin stitch appliqué. Have fun!
Stashing your materials
To create the appliquéd bluebird pillow, place mat, napkin, and kitchen towel
(that is, all four projects), you need the following materials:
 3⁄4 yard of off-white print fabric
 1⁄4 yard of dark blue print fabric
 1⁄4 yard of medium blue print fabric

 1⁄8 yard of light blue solid fabric
 Scraps of golden yellow print or solid fabric
 One 15- x 15-inch square of off-white solid fabric
 2 yards of premade blue piping
 All-purpose thread in medium blue and golden yellow
 Rayon or all-purpose thread in three shades of blue that match the blue
fabrics
 One 15- x 15-inch square of low-loft quilt batting
 1 yard of 18-inch-wide paper-backed fusible webbing
 1 yard of 18-inch-wide tear-away stabilizer
 One off-white kitchen towel, prewashed
 One off-white cotton place mat with matching napkin
 One 14-inch pillow form (or enough stuffing for a 14-inch pillow)
 Two 3⁄4-inch dark blue buttons
 Three 1⁄2-inch dark blue buttons
Making the pillow
The finished size of the appliquéd bluebird pillow is 14 x 14 inches. Follow
these steps to make the pillow:
All seam allowances on the pillow assembly are 1⁄4 inch and are included in
the measurements and instructions.
1. Referring to Table 18-1, cut the border, center, and backing pieces
from the fabrics indicated.
The letters following the pieces in the table correspond to the labels in
Figures 18-1 and 18-3.

7. Using Figure 18-2 as a guide, use a washable pencil to lightly draw the
bird and its legs onto the square you created in Step 2.
Sketching the bird in this manner gives you a reference point for where
to place your fabric pieces.
8. Remove the paper backings from the four fabric bird parts, and
arrange them on the square using your markings as a guide.
Overlap the pieces slightly so that none of the off-white background
fabric shows between the pieces (see Figure 18-6).
9. Fuse the pieces in place by pressing them with an iron preheated to
the cotton setting (or about halfway between medium and high heat).
10. Cut a piece of stabilizer just slightly larger than the bird, and pin it
to the back (wrong) side of the square so that it covers the shape of
the bird.
11. Machine appliqué the four pieces using a satin stitch and threads that
match the pieces.
The width of the satin stitch should be about 1⁄8 inch. For more on the
satin stitch, check out Chapter 10.
12. Using the same width of satin stitch, stitch along the leg markings to
machine embroider the legs.
13. When you finish with the satin stitch and all the pieces are appliquéd,
remove the pins and tear away the stabilizer from the back of the
block.
14. Stitch the blue inner side border strips (C) to the sides of the bird
block, as shown in Figure 18-3.
15. Stitch the blue inner upper and lower border strips (D) to the top and
bottom of the block, as shown in Figure 18-3. Press the seams of both
the C and D strips toward the borders.
16. Stitch the off-white outer side border strips (E) to the sides of the
block. (Refer to Figure 18-3 for placement of these strips.)

17. Stitch the off-white outer upper and lower border strips (F) to the
top and bottom of the block. (Refer to Figure 18-3 for placement of
these strips.) Press the seams of both the E and F strips toward the
blue borders.
18. Lay the pillow top facedown on your work surface. Lay the 15- x 15-inch
square of batting on top of it, followed by the off-white solid lining
piece, and thread or pin baste the layers together.
19. Quilt the pillow top as you like.
20. Machine stitch very close to the raw edges of the pillow top, and then
trim away the excess batting and backing that extends beyond the
edges of the appliquéd top.
21. Stitch the piping around the edges of the pillow top, clipping at the
corners to avoid rounded corners (see Figure 18-4).
When you clip the corners of the piping, clip close to but not through
the cord.

22. Place the pillow top and the pillow backing right sides together, and
stitch around all four sides, leaving an 8-inch opening along the bottom
edge for turning (see Figure 18-5).
23. Clip the corners close to, but not through, the stitching (refer to
Figure 18-5).
Clipping eliminates the bulk in the corners, giving you pointed instead of
rounded corners.
24. Turn the pillow cover right side out.
25. Hand stitch one 3⁄4-inch button eye on the bird’s head.
26. Insert the pillow form or stuffing, and then whip stitch the turning
opening closed.
Appliquéing the place mat
Because you use a premade place mat for this project, the finished size will
vary. Follow these steps to appliqué the place mat:
1. Double the size of the appliqué pattern provided at the end of this
project, and trace the four pieces for the large bluebird (head, beak,
wing, and body) on the paper side of your fusible webbing.

to place your fabric pieces.
6. Remove the paper backings from the four fabric bird parts, and
arrange them on the place mat using your markings as a guide.
Overlap the pieces slightly so none of the place mat fabric shows
between the pieces (refer to Figure 18-6).
7. Fuse the pieces in place by pressing them with an iron preheated to
the cotton setting (or about halfway between medium and high heat).
8. Cut a piece of stabilizer just slightly larger than the bird, and pin it
to the back (wrong) side of the place mat so that it covers the shape
of the bird.
9. Machine appliqué the four pieces using a satin stitch and threads that

Pink Tulips Breakfast Set
Not all quilt blocks are square! This breakfast set — place mat, hot pad, and
napkin — is based on a rectangular, odd-sized block. The floral block in fresh
spring pinks and bright greens is perfect whether it’s lined up in threes for
place mat centers or standing on its own in a hot pad (the napkin is left plain).
If pink’s not your color, try making the tulip portion of the blocks in yellow,
purple, or red — anything goes!
The top area of the block uses a set-in seam, which can be challenging. I guide
you through the task in the project instructions, but for more on set-in seams,
flip to Chapter 9.
Stashing your materials
The lists in this section tell you what fabrics and notions you need to make
two place mats, one hot pad, and two napkins:
 1 yard of white print fabric (includes backing fabric)
 1⁄3 yard each of two different pink print fabrics
 1⁄4 yard each of two different green fabrics (solids or prints)
 1⁄4 yard yellow fabric (solid or print)
 All-purpose thread in white, pink, and yellow
Additional materials needed for two place mats
 Two 18- x 24-inch pieces of cotton batting
 5 yards of yellow bias binding
If you choose to make your own binding, cut strips of yellow fabric 21⁄2 inches
by the width of fabric, and sew the ends together on a 45-degree angle (as
described in Chapter 14). Fold the long strip in half lengthwise, and press.
When it comes time to apply the binding, you’ll just fold the raw edges in and
stitch it to your project just like any other binding.
Additional materials needed for one hot pad
 Two 10- x 12-inch pieces of cotton batting
 11⁄4 yards of yellow piping
 Scrap of pink ribbon
Always use cotton batting on hot pads, place mats, or anything else that may
be subjected to the heat of a warmed dish — polyester batting will melt!
298
Part V: Completing the Circle: Projects to Try 

Materials needed for two napkins
 Two 19- x 19-inch squares of pink fabric (print or solid, as long as it 
coordinates)
 All-purpose thread in pink
Assembling the quilt blocks
This section explains how to construct the quilt blocks used in the place
mats and the hot pad. The finished block size is 4 x 81⁄2 inches.
All seam allowances are 1⁄4 inch and are included in the template patterns.
1. Using the template patterns provided at the end of this project section,
make a template for each piece shown in Figure 18-7. Label each tem-
plate, and include the grain line markings.
In Figure 18-7, “rev.” means to reverse the piece. If you need help creating
templates, see Chapter 4.
2. Referring to Table 18-2, trace the templates on the wrong side of the
corresponding fabrics, and then cut out the appropriate quantities of
each block piece.
Because they have set-in seams, be sure to transfer the corner dots on
pieces A and B from the templates to the fabrics.

5. With right sides together, stitch a left petal unit to a right petal unit,
as shown in Figure 18-10.
Begin your stitching at the dot at the center of the petals so that you
can set in the top portion of the block in the next step. This dot is
located 1⁄4 inch in from the edges of the pieces.
6. Stitch a top unit (created in Step 3) to the left petal unit, as shown in
Figure 18-11. Start stitching at the top-left corner, and stop stitching
at the dot. End your stitching, and cut the thread. Then stitch the top
unit to the right petal, starting at the dot and ending at the outside tip.
Make seven of these flower units.
7. Stitch two white triangles (D) to each green petal piece (E and E rev.),
as shown in Figure 18-12. Make seven left leaf sections and seven right
leaf sections.
8. With right sides together, stitch a left leaf section to a right leaf section
to make a leaf unit, as shown in Figure 18-12. Repeat this step until you
have seven leaf units.

Making the place mats
The finished size of each place mat is 20 x 151⁄2 inches. Follow these steps to
create two place mats:
1. Collect six of the quilt blocks you made in the preceding section.
You need three blocks for each place mat.
2. Referring to Table 18-3, cut out the borders and backing pieces for
each place mat.

Making the hot pad
The pink tulips hot pad consists of one bordered quilt block, and the finished
size is 8 x 101⁄2 inches. Follow these steps to create one hot pad:
1. Lay out one of the quilt blocks you created in the section “Assembling
the quilt blocks” earlier in this project section.
2. Referring to Table 18-4, cut the backing and border pieces for the
hot pad.

3. Stitch white side border strips (A) to the left and right sides of a
flower block. Press seam allowances toward the block.
4. Stitch white upper and lower border strips (B) to the top and bottom
edges of the flower block, as shown in Figure 18-17a. Press seam
allowances toward the block.
5. Stitch the yellow piping around the edges of the hot pad top (refer to
Figure 18-17b).
To apply the piping,
1. Begin stitching at the center of one side, leaving a 2-inch tail of
piping hanging free. When you approach a corner, stop stitching
1⁄4 inch from the corner, and clip into the seam allowance of the
piping close to but not through the stuffed area. Clipping eliminates
the bulk that would otherwise prevent a nice, pointed corner.
2. Turn the corner, and resume stitching.
3. When you arrive back at your starting point, overlap the remaining
piping and the tail you left at the starting point, and stitch across
them. The layers of fabric and batting are a bit bulky, so stitch slowly
so that you don’t break your needle.
4. Trim the excess tails of the piping so that they’re only about 
1⁄2 inch long.

6. Pin the two pieces of batting to the wrong side of the backing fabric.
7. Place the backing piece (with batting) and the hot pad top together,
with the right sides of the quilted top and backing facing.
8. With the wrong side of the quilted top facing up, stitch around the
edges of the top along the piping stitching lines, leaving a 3-inch 
opening at the top edge for turning. See Figure 18-18.
9. Remove any pins, trim the excess batting and backing fabric, clip the
corners, and turn the hot pad right side out.
10. Fold the scrap of ribbon in half to form a loop.
11. Insert the ends of the ribbon loop in the center of the turning opening
to create a hanging loop at the top of the hot pad (see Figure 18-19).
Then whip stitch the turning opening closed, catching the ends of the
ribbon in your stitching.
12. To finish the project, quilt the hot pad in any manner you choose.

Blue Star Place Mat and Hot Pad
This project is fun as well as versatile. How so? For starters, you can practice
your rotary cutting skills and whip out stars in a flash, and the place mat is
actually a miniature quilt!
For this project, you get instructions for making just one place mat, one hot pad,
and one coordinating napkin. I know many quilters love to make mini-quilts,
and this place mat is a perfect project for a first-time mini-quilter! To make
additional place mats, just increase the materials in the place mat list in the
following section. You can make additional hot pads and napkins easily, too.
Stashing your materials
I list the materials that you need to make one of each item. Because the place
mat fabrics require a fat quarter, which is 18 x 22 inches, you can easily figure
the yardage needed for additional place mats — 1⁄2 yard of fabric makes two
place mats, 1 yard makes four place mats, and so on.
Be sure to use cotton batting in this project. Polyester batting often melts
when exposed to high temperatures.
All seam allowances are 1⁄4 inch and are included in the given measurements.
Materials for one place mat
 One 18- x 22-inch piece (or fat quarter) of blue print fabric
 One 18- x 22-inch piece (or fat quarter) of tan print fabric
 One 8- x 20-inch piece of blue paisley fabric
 Two 16- x 20-inch pieces of cotton batting
 Two 16- x 20-inch pieces of dark blue solid fabric
 2 yards of dark blue quilt binding, 1⁄2-inch finished width
 All-purpose thread to match the fabrics
Materials for one hot pad
 One 7- x 10-inch piece of blue print fabric
 One 10- x 20-inch piece of tan print fabric
 One 12- x 7-inch strip of blue paisley fabric
 Two 11- x 11-inch pieces of cotton batting
 One 11- x 11-inch piece of dark blue solid fabric
 11⁄2 yards of dark blue quilt binding, 1⁄2-inch finished width
 All-purpose thread to match the fabrics

2. On the wrong side of the 14- x 10-inch tan piece, use a fabric pencil to
mark a grid of 24 17⁄8-inch squares. Then draw diagonal lines through
all the squares, as shown in Figure 18-20.
3. Place the marked tan piece and the 14- x 10-inch blue piece together,
right sides facing. Pin them together around the outside edges, placing
the pins out of the way of the diagonal stitching lines. Stitch 1⁄4 inch
from each side of the diagonal line (see Figure 18-20).
4. Cut out the 24 squares by cutting along the solid vertical and horizon-
tal lines you marked in Step 2.

5. Remove the pins, and cut the squares in half along the diagonal lines
(see Figure 18-21). You should end up with 48 doubled triangles that
are half tan and half blue.
6. Open each doubled triangle to reveal a two-tone square, as shown in
Figure 18-21. Press the squares open, with the seam allowances
toward the blue fabric.
7. Stitch together two of the two-tone squares so that they’re mirror
images of each other (see Figure 18-22). Make 24 of these strips.

11. Stitch three star blocks from Step 10 together horizontally to form one
row (see Figure 18-26). Make two of these rows.
12. Stitch the two rows together along one long edge to make the place
mat center.
13. Stitch one 21⁄2- x 14-inch tan strip to each of the two long sides of the
place mat center. Trim the ends to align with the edge of the place
mat center.
14. Stitch the remaining two tan strips to either side of the place mat, and
trim the ends to align with the outer edge of the borders from Step 13. 
15. Stitch the two 11⁄2- x 161⁄2-inch blue paisley strips to the two long sides of
the place mat center. Stitch the two 11⁄2- x 141⁄2-inch blue paisley strips
to other two sides of the place mat center.
The tan and blue borders should come together as shown in Figure 18-27.

16. Lay the place mat top facedown on your work surface. Lay a 16- x 
20-inch piece of batting on top of it, followed by a 16- x 20-inch piece
of solid dark blue backing fabric.
17. Thread or pin baste the layers together to prepare them for quilting.
18. Quilt the place mat as desired.
In the place mat pictured in the color section of this book, I machine
quilted in-the-ditch around each shape and in a diamond pattern in
the tan areas. I used a contrasting thread color just for fun.
19. Machine stitch very close to the raw edges of the place mat, and trim
away the excess batting and backing fabric.
20. Bind the place mats with the dark blue binding.
Assembling a hot pad
The finished size of this hot pad is 10 x 10 inches. The basic construction of
the star block with borders is the same as for the place mat (see the preced-
ing section), so if you get stuck on a step, refer to the place mat instructions
and figures for assistance.

2. On the wrong side of the 7- x 7-inch tan square, use a fabric pencil to
mark a grid of four 17⁄8-inch squares. Draw a diagonal line bisecting
each square.
3. Place the tan square and the 7- x 7-inch piece of blue print fabric
together, right sides facing. Pin them together around the outside
edges, placing the pins out of the way of the diagonal stitching lines.
Stitch 1⁄4 inch from each side of the diagonal line.
4. Cut out the four squares by cutting along the solid vertical and hori-
zontal lines you marked in Step 2. Cut the squares in half along the
diagonal lines to form eight doubled triangles that are half tan and
half blue.
5. Open each doubled triangle to reveal a two-tone square. Press the
squares open, with the seam allowances toward the blue fabric.
6. Stitch together two of the two-tone squares so that they’re mirror
images of each other. Make four of these units.
7. Stitch tan 11⁄2-inch squares to either end of two of the two-square units
made in Step 6.
317

8. Stitch the two remaining two-square units made in Step 6 to opposite
sides of the 21⁄2-inch blue center square.
9. Stitch two units that you made in Step 7 to the unit made in Step 8 to
make one star block.
10. Stitch the two tan 21⁄2- x 41⁄2-inch border strips to opposing sides of the
star block, and trim the edges so they align with the block edges.
11. Stitch the two tan 21⁄2- x 81⁄2-inch border strips to the two remaining sides,
and trim the edges so they align with the outer edges of the side borders.
12. Repeat Steps 10 and 11 with the blue paisley outer borders, sewing
the shorter strips on first followed by the longer strips, to complete
the hot pad top.
The borders should come together as shown in Figure 18-28.
13. Lay the hot pad top facedown on your work surface. On top of it,
place both pieces of 11- x 11-inch batting, followed by the backing
fabric (wrong side down). Thread or pin baste the layers together.
14. Quilt the hot pad using the same design you used for the place mats,
or choose a different design.
15. Machine stitch very close to the raw edges of the hot pad, and trim
away the excess batting and backing fabric.
16. Bind the hot pad with the dark blue binding (as you did for the place
mats), leaving a 6-inch tail at one corner, as shown in Figure 18-29a.

17. On the end of the binding tail, fold over the raw edge and then fold the
tail towards the back of the hot pad to form a loop (see Figure 18-29b).
Hand stitch the loop in place to finish the hot pad.
Making a napkin
The finished size of this napkin is 18 x 18 inches. To make one napkin, follow
these instructions:
1. Take the 19- x 19-inch square of blue paisley fabric and fold each edge
under 1⁄4 inch and press. Then fold each edge under another 1⁄4 inch,
and press again.
Turning under 1⁄4 inch twice on the napkin creates a doubled-hem, which
keeps the hem from fraying during laundering.
2. Stitch the hems in place with blue all-purpose thread, stitching around
all four sides 1⁄4 inch from the actual edges of the napkin.

Pastel Nine-Patch Wall Hanging
Here’s a project so simple and quick that you can make it in one day — no
kidding! It may look complex, but it’s actually just simple nine-patch blocks
set on point.
Be sure to use a large floral print in this project, and experiment with it. For the
quilt that appears in the color insert, I used the heaviest, busiest section of the
floral fabric in the center of the quilt top and the least busy areas of the fabric in
the sides and corners. This layout is a great way to use a large-scale print effec-
tively because you can balance the visual impact of the quilt, making sure that
all the busy areas don’t end up on one side while the other side remains plain.
Stashing your materials
To create this nine-patch wall hanging, you need the materials listed here:
 1⁄4 yard of light yellow solid fabric
 1⁄4 yard of light blue solid fabric
 1⁄3 yard of light pink print fabric
 1⁄3 yard of blue large-scale floral print fabric
 One 24- x 24-inch piece of batting
 One 24- x 24-inch piece of coordinating fabric
 All-purpose threads in yellow, blue, and pink to match the fabrics
 3 yards of light yellow quilt binding
Assembling the quilt top
The finished size of this wall hanging is 21 x 21 inches square. To assemble
the top, follow the instructions in this section.
All seam allowances are 1⁄4 inch and are included in all the given measurements.
1. Cut out the pieces of the quilt per the measurements in Table 18-7.
For the best results (nice straight edges), use a rotary cutter to cut all
the pieces. You may also use scissors if desired.
320
Part V: Completing the Circle: Projects to Try 

When cutting strips with the rotary cutter, be sure to use the lines on
your ruler instead of the ones on the cutting mat! The ruler gives you
much more accurate measurements. Only use the lines on the mat when
straightening an edge.

Quilting and completing the project
Follow these steps to complete your quilt:
1. Lay the quilt top facedown on your work surface. Layer on top of it
the batting and the backing fabric, right side up.
2. Thread or pin baste the layers together to prepare them for quilting.
See Chapter 12 for basting instructions.
3. Hand or machine quilt as desired.
Check out Chapter 11 for quilting design ideas. On the quilt pictured in
the color section of this book, I machine quilted 1⁄4 inch from the seam
lines with clear nylon monofilament.
4. Stitch around the quilt top 1⁄8 inch from the raw edges, and trim the
excess batting and backing even with the edges of the quilt top.
5. Bind the quilt to finish.
For a binding how-to, see Chapter 14.

W

With that inevitability in mind, this part gives you
lists of suggestions (in tens, of course) for how to expand
your experience of this uniquely personal, practical, and
artistic craft. Develop time-saving techniques with the tips
I give you, experiment with new ways to display your quilt

In This Chapter

T
hroughout this book, I give you timesaving ideas and tips to help make
your quilting project progress more quickly and smoothly. In this chapter,
I’ve collected a few more tips I’d like to pass along.
Go For a Wash and Spin
Cutting into unwashed fabric is a quilting taboo. Fabric that hasn’t been pre-
washed has the potential to bleed, shrink, and ultimately cause major errors
in your finished quilt.
I like to wash all new fabrics as soon as I get them in the door, before they
even make it into my sewing room. By doing this ahead of time, I know that
all the fabric in my stash is ready to use at a moment’s notice, whenever a
creative whim strikes me.
Keep Your Machine Tiptop
Nothing wastes time better than restitching a seam because your sewing
machine needle is skipping, adjusting the tension during a project, or picking
lint out of a seam because the machine wasn’t cleaned before you started
using it. To keep your momentum going and your project error-free, keep
your machine clean, oiled, and in top condition, and you’ll always be off on
the right foot (no pun intended). Check your owner’s manual for recommen-
dations on cleaning and servicing. I like to clean and oil my sewing machine
once every two months — but I do a lot of sewing!

Set Up an Efficient Workspace
To keep your quilt-making adventure running smoothly, you need a well-
organized workspace. The “kitchen triangle” that interior designers insist
upon works for quilting, too: Instead of a sink-stove-work surface triangle, 
set up a machine-pressing station-work surface triangle.
Position everything so you only have to take a few steps in between. This
layout saves you time and energy when working on large projects that require
you to move repeatedly from one task to another.
Stick to Neutral Thread
Sometimes, it seems that threading your machine and bobbin takes more
time than actually sewing.
When piecing, choose one neutral thread color that works well with all fabrics.
Doing so saves you the hassle of rethreading your machine with a different
color for every fabric. Use this same neutral thread in the bobbin, and stitch
away! Also, thread several bobbins at one time so you don’t have to stop and
wind bobbins each time one runs out.
Divide Your Work into Mini-Projects
To make a large or complex project less intimidating and more manageable,
divide the work into units that each can be completed in 10 to 15 minutes.
With tasks broken down in this manner, you can make great use of small
pockets of time, such as when you’re waiting for a phone call. For example,
you can cut out all the pieces you need for a project at once, chain-piece
items for a block in one sitting, cut them apart and press in another sitting,
and stitch the units together to make blocks at a later time.
Forego the Iron in Favor of the Finger
When working on small units, finger-press the pieces open rather than run to
the ironing board each time. Simply run your fingernail over the seam line of
the opened unit to press the seam allowance open. You can press the pieces
at the ironing board later.
328
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Work Assembly Line–Style
If you’ve ever had to stuff envelopes, you know that you make faster progress
by doing the same task over and over rather than constantly switching gears.
When you’re working on a quilting project, you can do several things all at
once to save time. For instance, divide your time by cutting out all the pieces
of your blocks at once, then stitch all the units together, then assemble all
the units into blocks, and finally stitch all the blocks together to create the
quilt top.
Save time by chain-piecing whenever possible (see Chapter 9 for instruc-
tions). You can cut the units apart later, perhaps while watching television or
helping the youngsters with homework. Likewise, trim all thread tails at once,
and press in one sitting.
Stitch on the Run
Are you working on a project that requires hand appliqué or hand piecing?
Fill a resealable plastic bag with your fabric, thread, extra needles, and a
small pair of scissors so you can work on your project just about anywhere.
Tote your project with you for endless lobby lounging at the dentist’s or
doctor’s office. Or keep it in the car and work on it while waiting outside 
the schoolyard on carpool duty.
If you’re taking your project on vacation or an overnight visit, pack a 75-watt
light bulb so you know you’ll always be stitching in good light. Hotels are
notorious for using low-wattage light bulbs.
Keep Several Needles Threaded
When doing hand appliqué, piecing, or quilting, it’s a great idea to have sev-
eral needles threaded and waiting at all times. Threading needles is a great
job for the kids, especially if your eyesight is a bit weak. (Chocolate or popsi-
cles are wonderful motivators for the kiddies.)
If you’re interested in knowing how much thread you put into a quilt, a great
time to measure is when you thread your needles. Simply cut enough one-
yard lengths of thread for any number of needles (working in tens makes
keeping track easier), and keep track of the number of yards cut in a notepad.
Thread the needles and place them in a pincushion. Hey, some quilters go in
for this stuff!
329
Chapter 19: Ten Quilting Timesavers

One way to keep track of threaded needles for hand quilting is to thread a
bunch on the spool at one time. As you need a new threaded needle simply
push the others back down the spool of thread and, with just one needle on
the thread, cut the thread the length you need. Threading multiple needles
on one spool means you don’t have to thread needles as you work, and it
saves your eyesight for just the sewing part. Just remember to push the other
needles down the thread or you’ll cut them all off at once and undo the
threading you were so far ahead on!
Spring for Prepackaged Binding
Save yourself a lot of time and potential frustration by buying prepackaged
binding rather than making your own. Binding is usually sold in 2- to 3-yard
lengths and is great because all the cutting, folding, and pressing are already
done for you. And it’s affordable, too, at around $2 per package. The only
drawback is its limited color selection. Most of the basics — white, black,
navy blue, cream, red — are covered, though, so try to choose a color that
compliments your quilt by matching the binding to one of your main fabrics.

Ten Tips for Displaying Your Art
In This Chapter
 Experimenting with hanging displays
 Keeping quilts easily accessible
Quilted items are practical as well as decorative. You may want to show
off a quilt as a bedcovering or use smaller pieces as place mats on your
table. You can also choose form over function and display your quilting as
decorative art.
In this chapter, you can find ten tips and ideas for displaying your master-
pieces safely and to their best advantage. Use your imagination to come up
with additional ways to show off your quilted art!
Pin Your Quilt to the Wall
To display small quilted items — say, 36 x 36 inches — without leaving major
marks on your walls, gather four skinny straight pins — the same kind you
use to pin fabric together when sewing. In each upper corner of the quilt,
insert a pin in the backing, about 1⁄2 inch from the corner. (By inserting the pin
in the backing, you actually hide the pin behind the quilt, and no one’s the
wiser.) Holding the quilt up to where you want it to hang, push the pins into
the wall at an angle upwards about 1⁄2 inch. Do the same thing with the lower
corners, but angle the head of the pin downwards so that the ends of the
quilt don’t curl upwards.
This type of display only works for small quilted items. Quilts any bigger than
36 x 36 inches are too heavy for the pins to hold securely.

Use Wooden Quilt Hangers
Wooden quilt hangers are available in many quilt shops and quilting catalogs.
However, they’re very easy to make, so you may want to enlist your favorite
handyperson to make some for you. To support large quilts, you usually need
two or three small hangers or one or two long ones. The hangers consist of
two pieces of wood that are placed on top of one another, sandwiching the
top edge of the quilt between them. This method of display interferes with
the top edge of your quilt, somewhat obstructing its appearance. If the
obstruction bothers you, consider hand-stitching a dummy strip of fabric to
the top-back edge of your quilt. Insert this strip into the hangers instead of
the binding. (Of course, if you remove the quilt from the hanger to use as a
table covering, lap quilt, or bed covering, remove this dummy strip.)
Hang Around with Dowel 
Sleeves and Rods
Dowel sleeves and rods are used in a popular quilt-hanging method that
allows your quilt to hang straight with little distortion. First, you need to
make a dowel sleeve and attach it to the upper back side of the quilt:
1. Measure the top width of the quilt you’re making the sleeve for, and
add 2 inches.
For example, if your quilt is 45 inches wide, your measurement is 
47 inches.
2. From fabric that’s the same color as the backing or something differ-
ent (the choice is yours), cut a strip that’s 6 inches wide and as long as
your measurement from Step 1.
3. Fold the strip in half lengthwise, with the right sides facing. Machine
straight stitch 1⁄4 inch from the double raw edge of the strip. Leave the
short side ends unstitched so that you end up with a fabric tube, or
sleeve.
4. Turn the sleeve right-side-out by pulling it through one open end, and
press it flat.
5. Pin the sleeve to the back side of the quilt near the top edge, lining
up one long edge of the sleeve with the edge of the binding where it
meets the backing fabric. Hand stitch both long edges of the sleeve in
place using a blind-stitch.
332
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

With the sleeve sewn in place, insert a dowel rod or lath strip into the sleeve.
To hang your quilt, attach brackets to your wall to hold the dowel (you can
use wood brackets from the home improvement center or curtain rod brack-
ets, depending on the thickness of the dowel). For a decorative look, you can
cut the dowel an inch or two longer than the width of the quilt and attach
finials to the ends of the dowel. To find out how you can use the dowel and
sleeve method with a large quilt, see the sidebar “Hanging large-sized quilts.”
Use a Café Curtain Rod
To display small, lightweight projects, purchase a café curtain rod set and
mount it to the wall using the accompanying brackets. Draping your quilted
items over the mounted rod, sewing a sleeve to the back of the quilt and
threading the rod through it, or using clip-on café curtain hooks (no sleeve
required!) are great ways to show off an ever-changing display of your work.
Never hang a quilt in sunlight. Even filtered sunlight can cause fading damage
to your quilts.
333
Chapter 20: Ten Tips for Displaying Your Art
Hanging large-sized quilts
Because of its weight, a large quilt needs a
good amount of support when it’s hanging on
the wall. To hang a large quilt:
1. Cut a strip of fabric that’s 12 inches wide
and as long as your quilt width.
For example, if your quilt measures 60
inches across the top, cut your sleeve
fabric 12 x 60 inches.
2. Finish and attach the sleeve as you would
for smaller quilts (see the section “Hang
Around with Dowel Sleeves and Rods”).
3. Purchase a length of wood closet rod
exactly as long as the quilt is wide.
4. Insert a heavy-duty screw eye into each
end of the rod, and insert the rod into the
sleeve.
5. Cut a length of heavy-gauge wire 6 inches
longer than the length of the closet rod.
Insert one end of wire into one screw eye,
and secure it by twisting. Do the same with
the other end of the wire and the other screw
eye, taking up most of the slack in the wire
so that it’s just slightly longer than the rod.
6. Pound a nail into a wall stud about 1 inch
higher than you want the quilt to hang.
7. Hang the wire on the nail.

Cover a Table
Use the quilt as a table topper. Smaller quilts are great as table art, especially
square ones. Use a quilt as a large doily by placing it at a diagonal in the
center of the table. Long, narrow quilts make lovely table runners, and larger
quilts can be used in lieu of tablecloths and are especially nice during the
holidays, if you have a quilt that coordinates with the season. Some quilts are
even small enough to be used as place mats!
Drape the Quilt over Furniture
Draping your quilt over the back of a chair or sofa adds interest to the furniture
and allows people to curl up with the quilt when they’re chilly. This display
method is a great way to show off your creation and get lots of good use out
of it as well.
Fold and Stack
For a country casual look, fold several quilts up neatly and stack them in an
open cupboard. If you have an antique ladder with lots of character, consider
using it as a quilt display as well: Fold your quilts neatly and hang them from
the rungs.
Artfully Arrange
Arrange a quilt so that it appears to spill out of a big basket or trunk. This
look is very whimsical and relaxed, and it’s a great way to display multiple
quilts in your collection — simply rotate them often to show off more of your
handiwork.
Create seasonal vignettes by arranging a quilt with items relevant to the
season. I’m imagining a quilt in fall colors spilling out of a large brown basket,
accented with a branch of autumn leaves and a pumpkin or two. . . .
334
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Fold and Place
Fold your quilt and place it at the foot of the bed or on the back of the sofa.
This arrangement is another one that’s both attractive and practical because
you can grab the quilt whenever you need some extra warmth. Even a small
quilt that wouldn’t normally be large enough to snuggle under can be folded
neatly at the foot of the bed, making it look bigger than it really is. Long,
narrow quilts or quilts folded into narrow lengths can also be used up in the
pillow area in place of decorative shams.
Drape It over the Stair Railing
Quilts look wonderful hanging from railings! In fact, the stair railing is one of
those places where you can have an ever-changing display of quilt art for all
the world — or at least folks visiting — to see!

Top Ten Criteria Quilting 
Judges Use
In This Chapter
 Mastering the practical craft of quilting
 Executing the details with expertise
N
ow that you’re on your way to becoming a card-carrying member of the
hooked-on-quilting club, you’ll no doubt start setting your sights on the
big quilting shindig — the quilt show — and the possibility of having one of
your very own creations win a prize or two.
Quilt judges are a savvy bunch. They don’t scrutinize your quilt up and down
to find its faults. Instead, they evaluate your quilt carefully to see what makes
it stand apart from the others in a good way. Because they’re quilters them-
selves, judges know all the little tricks and techniques that can make a quilt 
a knockout or a knock-down. Judges also have to do their very best to put
aside their own design and color preferences and view each quilt as a work 
of art, worthy of being judged on its own merit.
In this chapter, I clue you in on how to get your creation noticed by the judg-
ing panel by pointing out the various criteria they have in mind and how to
use that knowledge to your advantage.
Design
First impressions do count! The design of your quilt is the first and foremost
thing the judges look at. Questions they may ask themselves include: Is the
design interesting and eye-catching? Did you show your creativity by creating
a new design, or did you adapt a traditional one by resizing, stretching, or
styling it differently? Do the colors and patterns create excitement in the
quilt, or do they clash worse than pearls at a ballpark?

Unity
Some things just don’t go together, and with all the different quilting tech-
niques, patterns, and fabrics available to you, there’s plenty of room for 
error. If the quilt is composed of different elements, such as both pieced and
appliquéd blocks, judges consider how the components work together. Is there
a harmony to their pairing? For example, pairing a big, clunky nine-patch design
stitched from homespun plaids with a well-executed appliqué pattern of tiny
trailing vines and pretty flowers may not be such a great idea.
Balance and Layout
Your blocks, sashing, borders, and binding should look like they belong
together. Do your chosen borders add another element to your quilt’s design,
or does an over- or undersized border detract from the overall look of the
quilt, causing it to look unbalanced? For example, if the main part of your
quilt top is made up of blocks with many intricate pieces in a number of dif-
ferent fabrics, an equally busy border will only distract the eye and fight with
the center design rather than complement it.
Neatness
Quilts entered in a competition should always be immaculately clean, free
from wrinkles, and completely devoid of “cling-ons” such as thread or fuzz.
They should never smell of mildew, tobacco, or your pets.
Also, make sure that any quilting lines or seam allowances that you marked
on the quilt are long gone. To remove quilt markings, wash your quilt accord-
ing to the directions on the batting package or in your washing machine on
the gentle cycle using a mild detergent. Many quilt shops carry detergents
that are perfect for quilts because they’re mild and don’t cause fabrics to
fade. Most quilts can handle a toss in the dryer, as long as it’s on a low set-
ting; when in doubt (and when the weather’s nice), place a sheet on a shady
patch of your lawn and lay the quilt on top of it to dry.
Stubborn quilting lines can be coaxed out of the quilt by rubbing the edge
of a bar of mild soap along the markings and then washing and drying as
usual. If the lines still don’t disappear, check the package for your marking
implement — was it really washable?
338
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Construction
Quilt show judges pay particular attention to the construction of a quilt
because it shows your attention to detail and your concern for doing things
correctly. If you’re considering entering your project in a show, ask yourself
these questions first:
 Do all your seams line up and converge on one another properly?
Seams that don’t line up indicate that your seam allowances may not
have been consistent throughout the project.
 Are your points nice and sharp or cut off at the tip?
Craftsmanship
In quilt judging, craftsmanship refers to the little stuff: the beginnings and
ends of your stitching, the appearance of your stitches, and the overall
squareness of your final project. Evaluate your own craftsmanship before the
judges do by answering these questions:
 If your quilt features hand blind-stitch appliqué, are your stitches as
invisible as possible?
 If you used a blanket stitch for appliqué, are your stitches consistently
spaced?
 Are your quilting stops and starts obvious or (hopefully) barely
noticeable? Machine quilting can produce the problem of visible starts
and stops if you backstitch too often.
 If you hand quilted your project, are your knots hidden? They should
not be seen or felt.
 Is your quilt squared? A skewed quilt is always marked down because
it’s noticeably crooked, doesn’t hang properly (it favors one side), and
just doesn’t look “right.”
Quilting
Seeing as how quilting is what makes a quilt a quilt (follow that?), it’s not 
surprising that judges pay very close attention to the quality of your quilting
work. This criterion involves not only the quilting stitches but also the quilting
339
Chapter 21: Top Ten Criteria Quilting Judges Use

design. To prepare yourself for the judges’ scrutiny, examine your quilt with an
objective eye and ask yourself these questions:
 If you hand quilted your project, are your stitches evenly sized and
spaced? Your stitches don’t have to be itsy-bitsy-teeny-weeny — just
consistent in size. Hand quilting that’s all over the place in terms of size
definitely costs you points.
 If you stipple quilted on the machine, are your paths consistently wan-
dering or do they cross one another at odd places? Crossed paths in
any stipple-quilted area are a big no-no and can get you marked down 
a bit.
 If you chose to use a quilting template or fancy design, does it comple-
ment the overall style of the quilt? For example, an Art Deco quilting
design isn’t the best match for a quilt with an Asian theme. If the quilting
design doesn’t complement the overall design, it can easily detract from
the project’s overall appearance in spite of the time and care you took to
stitch it.
 If you used an allover quilting design to fill large empty areas, does it
fill the space without detracting from the more important elements of
the quilt?
 Does the color of the chosen thread complement the quilt? Is the
thread weight too fine or too heavy for the overall design?
Finishing
Because it’s one of the last elements you work on in your quilting project, the
quality of the binding may suffer if you’re in a hurry to finally get the project
over and done with. However, quilting show judges don’t let you off the hook
quite so easily when it comes to binding and finishing.
Pay close attention to whether your binding is smooth around all four sides
of the quilt. A binding that’s too taut can curl the edges of the quilt inwards.
Also make sure that your corners are neatly turned and mitered.
Special Features
Judges love extras — anything that makes your quilt stand out from the
crowd in a good way is a definite bonus. So if you added any embroidery 
or other special stitching to the quilt, you should feel confident that it was
executed properly.
340
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Overall Appearance
When a quilt’s design, colors, fabrics, borders, quilting, workmanship, and
finishing all come together, they form the overall appearance (and my
favorite “Ah-Ha!” moment). Nothing thrills judges or other quilters more than
a truly remarkable quilt that makes them want to look more and more closely
and never stop marveling.
