PREFACE
OVERVIEW
The eleventh edition of Quantitative Analysis for Management continues to provide both graduate
and undergraduate students with a solid foundation in quantitative methods and management sci-
ence. Thanks to the comments and suggestions from numerous users and reviewers of this textbook
over the last thirty years, we are able to make this best-selling textbook even better.
We continue to place emphasis on model building and computer applications to help students
understand how the techniques presented in this book are actually used in business today. In each
chapter, managerial problems are presented to provide motivation for learning the techniques that
can be used to address these problems. Next, the mathematical models, with all necessary assump-
tions, are presented in a clear and concise fashion. The techniques are applied to the sample
problems with complete details provided. We have found that this method of presentation is very
effective, and students are very appreciative of this approach. If the mathematical computations for
a technique are very detailed, the mathematical details are presented in such a way that the instruc-
tor can easily omit these sections without interrupting the flow of the material. The use of computer
software allows the instructor to focus on the managerial problem and spend less time on the math-
ematical details of the algorithms. Computer output is provided for many examples.
The only mathematical prerequisite for this textbook is algebra. One chapter on probability and
another chapter on regression analysis provide introductory coverage of these topics. We use stan-
dard notation, terminology, and equations throughout the book. Careful verbal explanation is pro-
vided for the mathematical notation and equations used.
NEW TO THIS EDITION

Excel 2010 is incorporated throughout the chapters.

The Poisson and exponential distribution discussions were moved to Chapter 2 with the other
statistical background material used in the textbook.

The simplex algorithm content has been moved from the textbook to Module 7 on the
Companion Website.

There are 11 new QA in Action boxes, 4 new Model in the Real World boxes, and more than
40 new problems.

Less emphasis was placed on the algorithmic approach to solving transportation and assign-
ment model problems.

More emphasis was placed on modeling and less emphasis was placed on manual solution
methods.


The Companion Website, at www.pearsonhighered.com/render, provides the online modules,
additional problems, cases, and other material for almost every chapter.
SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE ELEVENTH EDITION
In the eleventh edition, we have incorporated the use of Excel 2010 throughout the chapters.
Whereas information about Excel 2007 is also included in appropriate appendices, screen captures
and formulas from Excel 2010 are used extensively. Most of the examples have spreadsheet solu-
tions provided. The Excel QM add-in is used with Excel 2010 to provide students with the most
up-to-date methods available.
An even greater emphasis on modeling is provided as the simplex algorithm has been moved
from the textbook to a module on the Companion Website. Linear programming models are pre-
sented with the transportation, transshipment, and assignment problems. These are presented from a
network approach, providing a consistent and coherent discussion of these important types of
problems. Linear programming models are provided for some other network models as well. While
a few of the special purpose algorithms are still available in the textbook, they may be easily omit-
ted without loss of continuity should the instructor choose that option.

PREFACE
xvii
In addition to the use of Excel 2010, the use of new screen captures, and the discussion of soft-
ware changes throughout the book, other modifications have been made to almost every chapter. We
briefly summarize the major changes here.
Chapter 1 Introduction to Quantitative Analysis. New QA in Action boxes and Managing in the
Real World applications have been added. One new problem has been added.
Chapter 2 Probability Concepts and Applications. The presentation of discrete random variables
has been modified. The empirical rule has been added, and the discussion of the normal distribution
has been modified. The presentations of the Poisson and exponential distributions, which are impor-
tant in the waiting line chapter, have been expanded. Three new problems have been added.
Chapter 3 Decision Analysis. The presentation of the expected value criterion has been modified. A
discussion is provided of using the decision criteria for both maximization and minimization prob-
lems. An Excel 2010 spreadsheet for the calculations with Bayes theorem is provided. A new QA in
Action box and six new problems have been added.
Chapter 4 Regression Models. Stepwise regression is mentioned when discussing model building.
Two new problems have been added. Other end-of-chapter problems have been modified.
Chapter 5 Forecasting. The presentation of exponential smoothing with trend has been modified.
Three new end-of-chapter problems and one new case have been added.
Chapter 6 Inventory Control Models. The use of safety stock has been significantly modified, with
the presentation of three distinct situations that would require the use of safety stock. Discussion of
inventory position has been added. One new QA in Action, five new problems, and two new solved
problems have been added.
Chapter 7 Linear Programming Models: Graphical and Computer Methods. Discussion has been
expanded on interpretation of computer output, the use of slack and surplus variables, and the pres-
entation of binding constraints. The use of Solver in Excel 2010 is significantly changed from Excel
2007, and the use of the new Solver is clearly presented. Two new problems have been added, and
others have been modified.
Chapter 8 Linear Programming Modeling Applications with Computer Analysis. The production
mix example was modified. To enhance the emphasis on model building, discussion of developing
the model was expanded for many examples. One new QA in Action box and two new end-of-chapter
problems were added.
Chapter 9 Transportation and Assignment Models. Major changes were made in this chapter, as
less emphasis was placed on the algorithmic approach to solving these problems. A network repre-
sentation, as well as the linear programming model for each type of problem, were presented. The
transshipment model is presented as an extension of the transportation problem. The basic trans-
portation and assignment algorithms are included, but they are at the end of the chapter and may be
omitted without loss of flow. Two QA in Action boxes, one Managing in the Real World situation,
and 11 new end-of-chapter problems were added.
Chapter 10 Integer Programming, Goal Programming, and Nonlinear Programming. More emphasis
was placed on modeling and less emphasis was placed on manual solution methods. One new
Managing in the Real World application, one new solved problem, and three new problems were added.
Chapter 11 Network Models. Linear programming formulations for the max-flow and shortest
route problems were added. The algorithms for solving these network problems were retained, but
these can easily be omitted without loss of continuity. Six new end-of-chapter problems were added.
Chapter 12 Project Management. Screen captures for the Excel QM software application were
added. One new problem was added.
Chapter 13 Waiting Lines and Queuing Models. The discussion of the Poisson and exponential dis-
tribution were moved to Chapter 2 with the other statistical background material used in the text-
book. Two new QA in Action boxes and two new end-of-chapter problems were added.
Chapter 14 Simulation Modeling. The use of Excel 2010 is the major change to this chapter.
Chapter 15 Markov Analysis. One Managing in the Real World application was added.
Chapter 16 Statistical Quality Control. One new QA in Action box was added. The chapter on the
simplex algorithm was converted to a module that is now available on the Companion Website with
the other modules. Instructors who choose to cover this can tell students to download the complete
discussion.

CHAPTER 1 • INTRODUCTION TO QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS
1.1
Introduction
People have been using mathematical tools to help solve problems for thousands of years; how-
ever, the formal study and application of quantitative techniques to practical decision making is
largely a product of the twentieth century. The techniques we study in this book have been
applied successfully to an increasingly wide variety of complex problems in business, govern-
ment, health care, education, and many other areas. Many such successful uses are discussed
throughout this book.
It isn’t enough, though, just to know the mathematics of how a particular quantitative
technique works; you must also be familiar with the limitations, assumptions, and specific
applicability of the technique. The successful use of quantitative techniques usually results 
in a solution that is timely, accurate, flexible, economical, reliable, and easy to understand
and use.
In this and other chapters, there are QA (Quantitative Analysis) in Action boxes that 
provide success stories on the applications of management science. They show how organi-
zations have used quantitative techniques to make better decisions, operate more efficiently,
and generate more profits. Taco Bell has reported saving over $150 million with better forecast-
ing of demand and better scheduling of employees. NBC television increased advertising
revenue by over $200 million between 1996 and 2000 by using a model to help develop sales
plans for advertisers. Continental Airlines saves over $40 million per year by using mathe-
matical models to quickly recover from disruptions caused by weather delays and other
factors. These are but a few of the many companies discussed in QA in Action boxes throughout
this book.
To see other examples of how companies use quantitative analysis or operations research
methods to operate better and more efficiently, go to the website www.scienceofbetter.org. The
success stories presented there are categorized by industry, functional area, and benefit. These
success stories illustrate how operations research is truly the “science of better.”
1.2
What Is Quantitative Analysis?
Quantitative analysis is the scientific approach to managerial decision making. Whim, emo-
tions, and guesswork are not part of the quantitative analysis approach. The approach starts with
data. Like raw material for a factory, these data are manipulated or processed into information
that is valuable to people making decisions. This processing and manipulating of raw data into
meaningful information is the heart of quantitative analysis. Computers have been instrumental
in the increasing use of quantitative analysis.
In solving a problem, managers must consider both qualitative and quantitative factors. For
example, we might consider several different investment alternatives, including certificates of
deposit at a bank, investments in the stock market, and an investment in real estate. We can use
quantitative analysis to determine how much our investment will be worth in the future when
deposited at a bank at a given interest rate for a certain number of years. Quantitative analysis
can also be used in computing financial ratios from the balance sheets for several companies
whose stock we are considering. Some real estate companies have developed computer pro-
grams that use quantitative analysis to analyze cash flows and rates of return for investment
property.
In addition to quantitative analysis, qualitative factors should also be considered. The
weather, state and federal legislation, new technological breakthroughs, the outcome of an elec-
tion, and so on may all be factors that are difficult to quantify.
Because of the importance of qualitative factors, the role of quantitative analysis in the
decision-making process can vary. When there is a lack of qualitative factors and when 
the problem, model, and input data remain the same, the results of quantitative analysis 
can automate the decision-making process. For example, some companies use quantitative
inventory models to determine automatically when to order additional new materials. In
most cases, however, quantitative analysis will be an aid to the decision-making process. 
The results of quantitative analysis will be combined with other (qualitative) information in
making decisions.
Quantitative analysis uses 
a scientific approach to decision
making.
Both qualitative and quantitative
factors must be considered.

THE QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS APPROACH
3
Quantitative analysis has been in existence since the beginning
of recorded history, but it was Frederick W. Taylor who in the early
1900s pioneered the principles of the scientific approach to man-
agement. During World War II, many new scientific and quantita-
tive techniques were developed to assist the military. These new
developments were so successful that after World War II many
companies started using similar techniques in managerial decision
making and planning. Today, many organizations employ a staff
of operations research or management science personnel or
consultants to apply the principles of scientific management to
problems and opportunities. In this book, we use the terms
management science, operations research, and quantitative
analysis interchangeably.
The origin of many of the techniques discussed in this book
can be traced to individuals and organizations that have applied
the principles of scientific management first developed by Taylor;
they are discussed in History boxes scattered throughout the book.
HISTORY
The Origin of Quantitative Analysis
1.3
The Quantitative Analysis Approach
The quantitative analysis approach consists of defining a problem, developing a model, acquir-
ing input data, developing a solution, testing the solution, analyzing the results, and implement-
ing the results (see Figure 1.1). One step does not have to be finished completely before the next
is started; in most cases one or more of these steps will be modified to some extent before the fi-
nal results are implemented. This would cause all of the subsequent steps to be changed. In some
cases, testing the solution might reveal that the model or the input data are not correct. This
would mean that all steps that follow defining the problem would need to be modified.
Defining the Problem
The first step in the quantitative approach is to develop a clear, concise statement of the
problem. This statement will give direction and meaning to the following steps.
In many cases, defining the problem is the most important and the most difficult step. It is
essential to go beyond the symptoms of the problem and identify the true causes. One problem
may be related to other problems; solving one problem without regard to other related problems
can make the entire situation worse. Thus, it is important to analyze how the solution to one
problem affects other problems or the situation in general.
It is likely that an organization will have several problems. However, a quantitative analysis
group usually cannot deal with all of an organization’s problems at one time. Thus, it is usually
necessary to concentrate on only a few problems. For most companies, this means selecting
those problems whose solutions will result in the greatest increase in profits or reduction in costs
to the company. The importance of selecting the right problems to solve cannot be overempha-
sized. Experience has shown that bad problem definition is a major reason for failure of man-
agement science or operations research groups to serve their organizations well.
When the problem is difficult to quantify, it may be necessary to develop specific,
measurable objectives. A problem might be inadequate health care delivery in a hospital. The
objectives might be to increase the number of beds, reduce the average number of days a patient
spends in the hospital, increase the physician-to-patient ratio, and so on. When objectives are
used, however, the real problem should be kept in mind. It is important to avoid obtaining spe-
cific and measurable objectives that may not solve the real problem.
Developing a Model
Once we select the problem to be analyzed, the next step is to develop a model. Simply stated, a
model is a representation (usually mathematical) of a situation.
Even though you might not have been aware of it, you have been using models most of your
life. You may have developed models about people’s behavior. Your model might be that friend-
ship is based on reciprocity, an exchange of favors. If you need a favor such as a small loan, your
model would suggest that you ask a good friend.
Of course, there are many other types of models. Architects sometimes make a physical
model of a building that they will construct. Engineers develop scale models of chemical plants,
Defining the problem can be the
most important step.
Concentrate on only a few
problems.
The types of models include 
physical, scale, schematic, and
mathematical models.

CHAPTER 1 • INTRODUCTION TO QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS
Operations Research and Oil Spills
Operations researchers and decision scientists have been investi-
gating oil spill response and alleviation strategies since long before
the BP oil spill disaster of 2010 in the Gulf of Mexico. A four-phase
classification system has emerged for disaster response research: mit-
igation, preparedness, response, and recovery. Mitigation means re-
ducing the probability that a disaster will occur and implementing
robust, forward-thinking strategies to reduce the effects of a disaster
that does occur. Preparedness is any and all organization efforts that
happen a priori to a disaster. Response is the location, allocation, and
overall coordination of resources and procedures during the disaster
that are aimed at preserving life and property. Recovery is the set of
actions taken to minimize the long-term impacts of a particular dis-
aster after the immediate situation has stabilized.
Many quantitative tools have helped in areas of risk analysis,
insurance, logistical preparation and supply management, evacu-
ation planning, and development of communication systems. Re-
cent research has shown that while many strides and discoveries
have been made, much research is still needed. Certainly each of
the four disaster response areas could benefit from additional re-
search, but recovery seems to be of particular concern and per-
haps the most promising for future research.

ations Management,” European Journal of Operational Research 175, 1 (2006):

called pilot plants. A schematic model is a picture, drawing, or chart of reality. Automobiles,
lawn mowers, gears, fans, typewriters, and numerous other devices have schematic models
(drawings and pictures) that reveal how these devices work. What sets quantitative analysis apart
from other techniques is that the models that are used are mathematical. A mathematical model
is a set of mathematical relationships. In most cases, these relationships are expressed in equa-
tions and inequalities, as they are in a spreadsheet model that computes sums, averages, or stan-
dard deviations.
Although there is considerable flexibility in the development of models, most of the models
presented in this book contain one or more variables and parameters. A variable, as the name
implies, is a measurable quantity that may vary or is subject to change. Variables can be
controllable or uncontrollable. A controllable variable is also called a decision variable. An
example would be how many inventory items to order. A parameter is a measurable quantity
that is inherent in the problem. The cost of placing an order for more inventory items is an
example of a parameter. In most cases, variables are unknown quantities, while parameters
are known quantities. All models should be developed carefully. They should be solvable, real-
istic, and easy to understand and modify, and the required input data should be obtainable.
The model developer has to be careful to include the appropriate amount of detail to be solvable
yet realistic.
Acquiring Input Data
Once we have developed a model, we must obtain the data that are used in the model (input
data). Obtaining accurate data for the model is essential; even if the model is a perfect represen-
tation of reality, improper data will result in misleading results. This situation is called garbage
in, garbage out. For a larger problem, collecting accurate data can be one of the most difficult
steps in performing quantitative analysis.
There are a number of sources that can be used in collecting data. In some cases, company
reports and documents can be used to obtain the necessary data. Another source is interviews
with employees or other persons related to the firm. These individuals can sometimes provide
excellent information, and their experience and judgment can be invaluable. A production su-
pervisor, for example, might be able to tell you with a great degree of accuracy the amount of
time it takes to produce a particular product. Sampling and direct measurement provide other
sources of data for the model. You may need to know how many pounds of raw material are used
in producing a new photochemical product. This information can be obtained by going to the
plant and actually measuring with scales the amount of raw material that is being used. In other
cases, statistical sampling procedures can be used to obtain data.
Garbage in, garbage out means
that improper data will result 
in misleading results.

THE QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS APPROACH

Developing a Solution
Developing a solution involves manipulating the model to arrive at the best (optimal) solution to
the problem. In some cases, this requires that an equation be solved for the best decision. In
other cases, you can use a trial and error method, trying various approaches and picking the one
that results in the best decision. For some problems, you may wish to try all possible values for
the variables in the model to arrive at the best decision. This is called complete enumeration.
This book also shows you how to solve very difficult and complex problems by repeating a few
simple steps until you find the best solution. A series of steps or procedures that are repeated is
called an algorithm, named after Algorismus, an Arabic mathematician of the ninth century.
The accuracy of a solution depends on the accuracy of the input data and the model. If the in-
put data are accurate to only two significant digits, then the results can be accurate to only two sig-
nificant digits. For example, the results of dividing 2.6 by 1.4 should be 1.9, not 1.857142857.
Testing the Solution
Before a solution can be analyzed and implemented, it needs to be tested completely. Because
the solution depends on the input data and the model, both require testing.
Testing the input data and the model includes determining the accuracy and completeness
of the data used by the model. Inaccurate data will lead to an inaccurate solution. There are sev-
eral ways to test input data. One method of testing the data is to collect additional data from a
different source. If the original data were collected using interviews, perhaps some additional
data can be collected by direct measurement or sampling. These additional data can then be
compared with the original data, and statistical tests can be employed to determine whether there
are differences between the original data and the additional data. If there are significant differ-
ences, more effort is required to obtain accurate input data. If the data are accurate but the 
results are inconsistent with the problem, the model may not be appropriate. The model can be
checked to make sure that it is logical and represents the real situation.
Although most of the quantitative techniques discussed in this book have been computer-
ized, you will probably be required to solve a number of problems by hand. To help detect both
logical and computational mistakes, you should check the results to make sure that they are con-
sistent with the structure of the problem. For example, (1.96)(301.7) is close to (2)(300), which
is equal to 600. If your computations are significantly different from 600, you know you have
made a mistake.
Analyzing the Results and Sensitivity Analysis
Analyzing the results starts with determining the implications of the solution. In most cases, a
solution to a problem will result in some kind of action or change in the way an organization is
operating. The implications of these actions or changes must be determined and analyzed before
the results are implemented.
Because a model is only an approximation of reality, the sensitivity of the solution to
changes in the model and input data is a very important part of analyzing the results. This type
of analysis is called sensitivity analysis or postoptimality analysis. It determines how much the
solution will change if there were changes in the model or the input data. When the solution is
sensitive to changes in the input data and the model specification, additional testing should be
performed to make sure that the model and input data are accurate and valid. If the model or data
are wrong, the solution could be wrong, resulting in financial losses or reduced profits.
The importance of sensitivity analysis cannot be overemphasized. Because input data may
not always be accurate or model assumptions may not be completely appropriate, sensitivity
analysis can become an important part of the quantitative analysis approach. Most of the chap-
ters in the book cover the use of sensitivity analysis as part of the decision-making and problem-
solving process.
Implementing the Results
The final step is to implement the results. This is the process of incorporating the solution into
the company. This can be much more difficult than you would imagine. Even if the solution
is optimal and will result in millions of dollars in additional profits, if managers resist the
new solution, all of the efforts of the analysis are of no value. Experience has shown that a large
The input data and model 
determine the accuracy of the 
solution.
Testing the data and model is
done before the results are 
analyzed.
Sensitivity analysis determines
how the solutions will change
with a different model or input
data.

CHAPTER 1 • INTRODUCTION TO QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS
Defining the Problem
CSX Transportation, Inc., has 35,000 employees and annual revenue of $11 billion. It provides rail freight
services to 23 states east of the Mississippi River, as well as parts of Canada. CSX receives orders for rail deliv-
ery service and must send empty railcars to customer locations. Moving these empty railcars results in hun-
dreds of thousands of empty-car miles every day. If allocations of railcars to customers is not done properly,
problems arise from excess costs, wear and tear on the system, and congestion on the tracks and at rail yards.
Developing a Model
In order to provide a more efficient scheduling system, CSX spent 2 years and $5 million developing its
Dynamic Car-Planning (DCP) system. This model will minimize costs, including car travel distance, car han-
dling costs at the rail yards, car travel time, and costs for being early or late. It does this while at the same
time filling all orders, making sure the right type of car is assigned to the job, and getting the car to the
destination in the allowable time.
Acquiring Input Data
In developing the model, the company used historical data for testing. In running the model, the DCP uses
three external sources to obtain information on the customer car orders, the available cars of the type
needed, and the transit-time standards. In addition to these, two internal input sources provide informa-
tion on customer priorities and preferences and on cost parameters.
Developing a Solution
This model takes about 1 minute to load but only 10 seconds to solve. Because supply and demand are con-
stantly changing, the model is run about every 15 minutes. This allows final decisions to be delayed until ab-
solutely necessary.
Testing the Solution
The model was validated and verified using existing data. The solutions found using the DCP were found
to be very good compared to assignments made without DCP.
Analyzing the Results
Since the implementation of DCP in 1997, more than $51 million has been saved annually. Due to the im-
proved efficiency, it is estimated that CSX avoided spending another $1.4 billion to purchase an additional
18,000 railcars that would have been needed without DCP. Other benefits include reduced congestion in the
rail yards and reduced congestion on the tracks, which are major concerns. This greater efficiency means that
more freight can ship by rail rather than by truck, resulting in significant public benefits. These benefits include
reduced pollution and greenhouse gases, improved highway safety, and reduced road maintenance costs.
Implementing the Results
Both senior-level management who championed DCP as well as key car-distribution experts who sup-
ported the new approach were instrumental in gaining acceptance of the new system and overcoming
problems during the implementation. The job description of the car distributors was changed from car al-
locators to cost technicians. They are responsible for seeing that accurate cost information is entered into
DCP, and they also manage any exceptions that must be made. They were given extensive training on how
DCP works so they could understand and better accept the new system. Due to the success of DCP, other
railroads have implemented similar systems and achieved similar benefits. CSX continues to enhance 
DCP to make DCP even more customer friendly and to improve car-order forecasts.

number of quantitative analysis teams have failed in their efforts because they have failed to im-

After the solution has been implemented, it should be closely monitored. Over time, there
may be numerous changes that call for modifications of the original solution. A changing
economy, fluctuating demand, and model enhancements requested by managers and decision
makers are only a few examples of changes that might require the analysis to be modified.

HOW TO DEVELOP A QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS MODEL
7
The Quantitative Analysis Approach and Modeling in the Real World
The quantitative analysis approach is used extensively in the real world. These steps, first seen
in Figure 1.1 and described in this section, are the building blocks of any successful use of quan-
titative analysis. As seen in our first Modeling in the Real World box, the steps of the quantita-
tive analysis approach can be used to help a large company such as CSX plan for critical
scheduling needs now and for decades into the future. Throughout this book, you will see how
the steps of the quantitative analysis approach are used to help countries and companies of all
sizes save millions of dollars, plan for the future, increase revenues, and provide higher-quality
products and services. The Modeling in the Real World boxes in every chapter will demonstrate
to you the power and importance of quantitative analysis in solving real problems for real or-
ganizations. Using the steps of quantitative analysis, however, does not guarantee success. These
steps must be applied carefully.
1.4
How to Develop a Quantitative Analysis Model
Developing a model is an important part of the quantitative analysis approach. Let’s see how we
can use the following mathematical model, which represents profit:
In many cases, we can express revenues as price per unit multiplied times the number of units
sold. Expenses can often be determined by summing fixed costs and variable cost. Variable cost
is often expressed as variable cost per unit multiplied times the number of units. Thus, we can
also express profit in the following mathematical model:
(1-1)
where
The parameters in this model are f, , and s, as these are inputs that are inherent in the model.
The number of units sold (X) is the decision variable of interest.
EXAMPLE: PRITCHETT’S PRECIOUS TIME PIECES We will use the Bill Pritchett clock repair shop
example to demonstrate the use of mathematical models. Bill’s company, Pritchett’s Precious
Time Pieces, buys, sells, and repairs old clocks and clock parts. Bill sells rebuilt springs for a
price per unit of $10. The fixed cost of the equipment to build the springs is $1,000. The vari-
able cost per unit is $5 for spring material. In this example,
The number of springs sold is X, and our profit model becomes
If sales are 0, Bill will realize a $1,000 loss. If sales are 1,000 units, he will realize a profit of
See if you can determine the profit
for other values of units sold.
$4,000 ($4,000 = ($10)(1,000) - $1,000 - ($5)(1,000)).
Profit = $10X - $1,000 - $5X
n = 5
f = 1,000
s = 10
n
X = number of units sold
n = variable cost per unit
f = fixed cost
s = selling price per unit
 Profit = sX - f - nX
 Profit = sX - 3f + nX4
- 3Fixed cost + (Variable cost per unit)(Number of units sold)4
 Profit = (Selling price per unit)(Number of units sold)
 Profit = Revenue - (Fixed cost + Variable cost)
Profit = Revenue - Expenses
Expenses include fixed and 
variable costs.

CHAPTER 1 • INTRODUCTION TO QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS
In addition to the profit models shown here, decision makers are often interested in the
break-even point (BEP). The BEP is the number of units sold that will result in $0 profits. We
set profits equal to $0 and solve for X, the number of units at the break-even point:
This can be written as
Solving for X, we have
This quantity (X) that results in a profit of zero is the BEP, and we now have this model for the BEP:
(1-2)
For the Pritchett’s Precious Time Pieces example, the BEP can be computed as follows:
The Advantages of Mathematical Modeling
There are a number of advantages of using mathematical models:
1. Models can accurately represent reality. If properly formulated, a model can be extremely
accurate. A valid model is one that is accurate and correctly represents the problem or sys-
tem under investigation. The profit model in the example is accurate and valid for many
business problems.
2. Models can help a decision maker formulate problems. In the profit model, for example, 
a decision maker can determine the important factors or contributors to revenues and
expenses, such as sales, returns, selling expenses, production costs, transportation costs,
and so on.
3. Models can give us insight and information. For example, using the profit model from the
preceding section, we can see what impact changes in revenues and expenses will have on
profits. As discussed in the previous section, studying the impact of changes in a model,
such as a profit model, is called sensitivity analysis.
4. Models can save time and money in decision making and problem solving. It usually takes
less time, effort, and expense to analyze a model. We can use a profit model to analyze the
impact of a new marketing campaign on profits, revenues, and expenses. In most cases, 
using models is faster and less expensive than actually trying a new marketing campaign in
a real business setting and observing the results.
5. A model may be the only way to solve some large or complex problems in a timely
fashion. A large company, for example, may produce literally thousands of sizes of nuts,
bolts, and fasteners. The company may want to make the highest profits possible given its
manufacturing constraints. A mathematical model may be the only way to determine the
highest profits the company can achieve under these circumstances.
6. A model can be used to communicate problems and solutions to others. A decision analyst
can share his or her work with other decision analysts. Solutions to a mathematical model
can be given to managers and executives to help them make final decisions.
Mathematical Models Categorized by Risk
Some mathematical models, like the profit and break-even models previously discussed, do not
involve risk or chance. We assume that we know all values used in the model with complete
certainty. These are called deterministic models. A company, for example, might want to
BEP = $1,000>($10 - $5) = 200 units, or springs, at the break-even point
 BEP =
f

 BEP =

(Selling price per unit) - (Variable cost per unit)

f = (s - n)X
0 = (s - n)X - f
0 = sX - f - nX
The BEP results in $0 profits.

minimize manufacturing costs while maintaining a certain quality level. If we know all these
values with certainty, the model is deterministic.
Other models involve risk or chance. For example, the market for a new product might be
“good” with a chance of 60% (a probability of 0.6) or “not good” with a chance of 40% (a prob-
ability of 0.4). Models that involve chance or risk, often measured as a probability value, are
called probabilistic models. In this book, we will investigate both deterministic and probabilis-
tic models.
1.5
The Role of Computers and Spreadsheet Models in the Quantitative Analysis Approach
Developing a solution, testing the solution, and analyzing the results are important steps in the
quantitative analysis approach. Because we will be using mathematical models, these steps re-
quire mathematical calculations. Fortunately, we can use the computer to make these steps eas-
ier. Two programs that allow you to solve many of the problems found in this book are provided
at the Companion Website for this book:
1. POM-QM for Windows is an easy-to-use decision support system that was developed for
use with production/operations management (POM) and quantitative methods or quantita-
tive management (QM) courses. POM for Windows and QM for Windows were originally
separate software packages for each type of course. These are now combined into one pro-
gram called POM-QM for Windows. As seen in Program 1.1, it is possible to display all
the modules, only the POM modules, or only the QM modules. The images shown in this
textbook will typically display only the QM modules. Hence, in this book, reference will
usually be made to QM for Windows. Appendix E at the end of the book and many of the
end-of-chapter appendices provide more information about QM for Windows.
2. Excel QM, which can also be used to solve many of the problems discussed in this book,
works automatically within Excel spreadsheets. Excel QM makes using a spreadsheet even
easier by providing custom menus and solution procedures that guide you through every
step. In Excel 2007, the main menu is found in the Add-Ins tab, as shown in Program 1.2.
Appendix F provides further details of how to install this add-in program to Excel 2010
and Excel 2007. To solve the break-even problem discussed in Section 1.4, we illustrate
Excel QM features in Programs 1.3A and 1.3B.

Major League Operations Research 
at the Department of Agriculture
In 1997, the Pittsburgh Pirates signed Ross Ohlendorf because
of his 95-mph sinking fastball. Little did they know that Ross pos-
sessed operations research skills also worthy of national merit.
Ross Ohlendorf had graduated from Princeton University with a
3.8 GPA in operations research and financial engineering.
Indeed, after the 2009 baseball season, when Ross applied for
an 8-week unpaid internship with the U.S. Department of Agricul-
ture, he didn’t need to mention his full-time employer because the
Secretary of the Department of Agriculture at the time, Tom Vilsack,
was born and raised in Pittsburgh and was an avid Pittsburgh
Pirates fan. Ross spent 2 months of the ensuing off-season utiliz-
ing his educational background in operations research, helping the
Department of Agriculture track disease migration in livestock, a
subject Ross has a vested interest in as his family runs a cattle
ranch in Texas. Moreover, when ABC News asked Ross about his
off-season unpaid internship experience, he replied, “This one’s
been, I’d say, the most exciting off-season I’ve had.”
All viewpoints should be
considered before formally
defining the problem.
1.6
Possible Problems in the Quantitative Analysis Approach
We have presented the quantitative analysis approach as a logical, systematic means of tackling
decision-making problems. Even when these steps are followed carefully, there are many diffi-
culties that can hurt the chances of implementing solutions to real-world problems. We now take
a look at what can happen during each of the steps.
Defining the Problem
One view of decision makers is that they sit at a desk all day long, waiting until a problem arises,
and then stand up and attack the problem until it is solved. Once it is solved, they sit down, re-
lax, and wait for the next big problem. In the worlds of business, government, and education,
problems are, unfortunately, not easily identified. There are four potential roadblocks that quan-
titative analysts face in defining a problem. We use an application, inventory analysis, through-
out this section as an example.
CONFLICTING VIEWPOINTS The first difficulty is that quantitative analysts must often consider
conflicting viewpoints in defining the problem. For example, there are at least two views that
managers take when dealing with inventory problems. Financial managers usually feel that
inventory is too high, as inventory represents cash not available for other investments. Sales
managers, on the other hand, often feel that inventory is too low, as high levels of inventory may
be needed to fill an unexpected order. If analysts assume either one of these statements as the
problem definition, they have essentially accepted one manager’s perception and can expect
resistance from the other manager when the “solution” emerges. So it’s important to consider
both points of view before stating the problem. Good mathematical models should include all
pertinent information. As we shall see in Chapter 6, both of these factors are included in inven-
tory models.
IMPACT ON OTHER DEPARTMENTS The next difficulty is that problems do not exist in isolation
and are not owned by just one department of a firm. Inventory is closely tied with cash flows
and various production problems. A change in ordering policy can seriously hurt cash flows and
upset production schedules to the point that savings on inventory are more than offset by in-
creased costs for finance and production. The problem statement should thus be as broad as pos-
sible and include input from all departments that have a stake in the solution. When a solution is
found, the benefits to all areas of the organization should be identified and communicated to the
people involved.
BEGINNING ASSUMPTIONS The third difficulty is that people have a tendency to state pro-
blems in terms of solutions. The statement that inventory is too low implies a solution that in-
ventory levels should be raised. The quantitative analyst who starts off with this assumption will

POSSIBLE PROBLEMS IN THE QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS APPROACH

probably indeed find that inventory should be raised. From an implementation standpoint, a
“good” solution to the right problem is much better than an “optimal” solution to the wrong
problem. If a problem has been defined in terms of a desired solution, the quantitative analyst
should ask questions about why this solution is desired. By probing further, the true problem
will surface and can be defined properly.
SOLUTION OUTDATED Even with the best of problem statements, however, there is a fourth dan-
ger. The problem can change as the model is being developed. In our rapidly changing business
environment, it is not unusual for problems to appear or disappear virtually overnight. The ana-
lyst who presents a solution to a problem that no longer exists can’t expect credit for providing
timely help. However, one of the benefits of mathematical models is that once the original model
has been developed, it can be used over and over again whenever similar problems arise. This
allows a solution to be found very easily in a timely manner.
Developing a Model
FITTING THE TEXTBOOK MODELS One problem in developing quantitative models is that a man-
ager’s perception of a problem won’t always match the textbook approach. Most inventory
models involve minimizing the total of holding and ordering costs. Some managers view these
costs as unimportant; instead, they see the problem in terms of cash flow, turnover, and levels
of customer satisfaction. Results of a model based on holding and ordering costs are probably
not acceptable to such managers. This is why the analyst must completely understand the model
and not simply use the computer as a “black box” where data are input and results are given
with no understanding of the process. The analyst who understands the process can explain
to the manager how the model does consider these other factors when estimating the different
types of inventory costs. If other factors are important as well, the analyst can consider these
and use sensitivity analysis and good judgment to modify the computer solution before it is
implemented.
UNDERSTANDING THE MODEL A second major concern involves the trade-off between the com-
plexity of the model and ease of understanding. Managers simply will not use the results of a
model they do not understand. Complex problems, though, require complex models. One trade-
off is to simplify assumptions in order to make the model easier to understand. The model loses
some of its reality but gains some acceptance by management.
One simplifying assumption in inventory modeling is that demand is known and con-
stant. This means that probability distributions are not needed and it allows us to build simple,
easy-to-understand models. Demand, however, is rarely known and constant, so the model we
build lacks some reality. Introducing probability distributions provides more realism but may
put comprehension beyond all but the most mathematically sophisticated managers. One
approach is for the quantitative analyst to start with the simple model and make sure that it is
completely understood. Later, more complex models can be introduced slowly as managers gain
more confidence in using the new approach. Explaining the impact of the more sophisticated
models (e.g., carrying extra inventory called safety stock) without going into complete mathe-
matical details is sometimes helpful. Managers can understand and identify with this concept,
even if the specific mathematics used to find the appropriate quantity of safety stock is not
totally understood.
Acquiring Input Data
Gathering the data to be used in the quantitative approach to problem solving is often not a sim-
ple task. One-fifth of all firms in a recent study had difficulty with data access.
USING ACCOUNTING DATA One problem is that most data generated in a firm come from basic
accounting reports. The accounting department collects its inventory data, for example, in terms
of cash flows and turnover. But quantitative analysts tackling an inventory problem need to col-
lect data on holding costs and ordering costs. If they ask for such data, they may be shocked to
find that the data were simply never collected for those specified costs.
An optimal solution to the wrong
problem leaves the real problem
unsolved.
Obtaining accurate input data
can be very difficult.

14
CHAPTER 1 • INTRODUCTION TO QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS
Professor Gene Woolsey tells a story of a young quantitative analyst sent down to account-
ing to get “the inventory holding cost per item per day for part 23456/AZ.” The accountant asked
the young man if he wanted the first-in, first-out figure, the last-in, first-out figure, the lower of
cost or market figure, or the “how-we-do-it” figure. The young man replied that the inventory
model required only one number. The accountant at the next desk said, “Hell, Joe, give the kid a
number.” The kid was given a number and departed.
VALIDITY OF DATA A lack of “good, clean data” means that whatever data are available must often
be distilled and manipulated (we call it “fudging”) before being used in a model. Unfortunately,
the validity of the results of a model is no better than the validity of the data that go into the model.
You cannot blame a manager for resisting a model’s “scientific” results when he or she knows that
questionable data were used as input. This highlights the importance of the analyst understanding
other business functions so that good data can be found and evaluated by the analyst. It also em-
phasizes the importance of sensitivity analysis, which is used to determine the impact of minor
changes in input data. Some solutions are very robust and would not change at all for certain
changes in the input data.
Developing a Solution
HARD-TO-UNDERSTAND MATHEMATICS The first concern in developing solutions is that al-
though the mathematical models we use may be complex and powerful, they may not be com-
pletely understood. Fancy solutions to problems may have faulty logic or data. The aura of
mathematics often causes managers to remain silent when they should be critical. The well-
known operations researcher C. W. Churchman cautions that “because mathematics has been so
revered a discipline in recent years, it tends to lull the unsuspecting into believing that he who
thinks elaborately thinks well.”1
ONLY ONE ANSWER IS LIMITING The second problem is that quantitative models usually give
just one answer to a problem. Most managers would like to have a range of options and not be
put in a take-it-or-leave-it position. A more appropriate strategy is for an analyst to present a
range of options, indicating the effect that each solution has on the objective function. This gives
managers a choice as well as information on how much it will cost to deviate from the optimal
solution. It also allows problems to be viewed from a broader perspective, since nonquantitative
factors can be considered.
Testing the Solution
The results of quantitative analysis often take the form of predictions of how things will work in
the future if certain changes are made now. To get a preview of how well solutions will really
work, managers are often asked how good the solution looks to them. The problem is that com-
plex models tend to give solutions that are not intuitively obvious. Such solutions tend to be re-
jected by managers. The quantitative analyst now has the chance to work through the model and
the assumptions with the manager in an effort to convince the manager of the validity of the re-
sults. In the process of convincing the manager, the analyst will have to review every assump-
tion that went into the model. If there are errors, they may be revealed during this review. In
addition, the manager will be casting a critical eye on everything that went into the model, and
if he or she can be convinced that the model is valid, there is a good chance that the solution re-
sults are also valid.
Analyzing the Results
Once a solution has been tested, the results must be analyzed in terms of how they will affect the
total organization. You should be aware that even small changes in organizations are often diffi-
cult to bring about. If the results indicate large changes in organization policy, the quantitative
analyst can expect resistance. In analyzing the results, the analyst should ascertain who must
change and by how much, if the people who must change will be better or worse off, and who
has the power to direct the change.
Hard-to-understand mathematics
and one answer can be a problem
in developing a solution.
Assumptions should be reviewed.

IMPLEMENTATION—NOT JUST THE FINAL STEP

PLATO Helps 2004 Olympic Games 
in Athens
The 2004 Olympic Games were held in Athens, Greece, over a
period of 16 days. More than 2,000 athletes competed in 300
events in 28 sports. The events were held in 36 different venues
(stadia, competition centers, etc.), and 3.6 million tickets were
sold to people who would view these events. In addition, 2,500
members of international committees and 22,000 journalists and
broadcasters attended these games. Home viewers spent more
than 34 billion hours watching these sporting events. The 2004
Olympic Games was the biggest sporting event in the history of
the world up to that point.
In addition to the sporting venues, other noncompetitive ven-
ues, such as the airport and Olympic village, had to be consid-
ered. A successful Olympics requires tremendous planning for the
transportation system that will handle the millions of spectators.
Three years of work and planning were needed for the 16 days of
the Olympics.
The Athens Olympic Games Organizing Committee (ATHOC)
had to plan, design, and coordinate systems that would be deliv-
ered by outside contractors. ATHOC personnel would later be re-
sponsible for managing the efforts of volunteers and paid staff
during the operations of the games. To make the Athens
Olympics run efficiently and effectively, the Process Logistics
Advanced Technical Optimization (PLATO) project was begun.
Innovative techniques from management science, systems engi-
neering, and information technology were used to change the
planning, design, and operations of venues.
The objectives of PLATO were to (1) facilitate effective organiza-
tional transformation, (2) help plan and manage resources in a cost-
effective manner, and (3) document lessons learned so future
Olympic committees could benefit. The PLATO project developed
business-process models for the various venues, developed simula-
tion models that enable the generation of what-if scenarios, devel-
oped software to aid in the creation and management of these
models, and developed process steps for training ATHOC personnel
in using these models. Generic solutions were developed so that this
knowledge and approach could be made available to other users.
PLATO was credited with reducing the cost of the 2004
Olympics by over $69 million. Perhaps even more important is the
fact that the Athens games were universally deemed an unquali-
fied success. The resulting increase in tourism is expected to re-
sult in economic benefit to Greece for many years in the future.

1.7
Implementation—Not Just the Final Step
We have just presented some of the many problems that can affect the ultimate acceptance of
the quantitative analysis approach and use of its models. It should be clear now that implemen-
tation isn’t just another step that takes place after the modeling process is over. Each one of these
steps greatly affects the chances of implementing the results of a quantitative study.
Lack of Commitment and Resistance to Change
Even though many business decisions can be made intuitively, based on hunches and experience,
there are more and more situations in which quantitative models can assist. Some managers,
however, fear that the use of a formal analysis process will reduce their decision-making power.
Others fear that it may expose some previous intuitive decisions as inadequate. Still others just
feel uncomfortable about having to reverse their thinking patterns with formal decision making.
These managers often argue against the use of quantitative methods.
Many action-oriented managers do not like the lengthy formal decision-making process and
prefer to get things done quickly. They prefer “quick and dirty” techniques that can yield imme-
diate results. Once managers see some quick results that have a substantial payoff, the stage is
set for convincing them that quantitative analysis is a beneficial tool.
We have known for some time that management support and user involvement are critical
to the successful implementation of quantitative analysis projects. A Swedish study found that
only 40% of projects suggested by quantitative analysts were ever implemented. But 70% of the
quantitative projects initiated by users, and fully 98% of projects suggested by top managers,
were implemented.
Lack of Commitment by Quantitative Analysts
Just as managers’ attitudes are to blame for some implementation problems, analysts’ attitudes
are to blame for others. When the quantitative analyst is not an integral part of the department
facing the problem, he or she sometimes tends to treat the modeling activity as an end in itself.
Management support and user
involvement are important.

16
CHAPTER 1 • INTRODUCTION TO QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS
That is, the analyst accepts the problem as stated by the manager and builds a model to solve
only that problem. When the results are computed, he or she hands them back to the manager
and considers the job done. The analyst who does not care whether these results help make the
final decision is not concerned with implementation.
Successful implementation requires that the analyst not tell the users what to do, but work
with them and take their feelings into account. An article in Operations Research describes an
inventory control system that calculated reorder points and order quantities. But instead of
insisting that computer-calculated quantities be ordered, a manual override feature was installed.
This allowed users to disregard the calculated figures and substitute their own. The override was
used quite often when the system was first installed. Gradually, however, as users came to real-
ize that the calculated figures were right more often than not, they allowed the system’s figures
to stand. Eventually, the override feature was used only in special circumstances. This is a good
example of how good relationships can aid in model implementation.
Summary
Quantitative analysis is a scientific approach to decision mak-
ing. The quantitative analysis approach includes defining the
problem, developing a model, acquiring input data, developing
a solution, testing the solution, analyzing the results, and im-
plementing the results. In using the quantitative approach,
however, there can be potential problems, including conflicting
viewpoints, the impact of quantitative analysis models on other
departments, beginning assumptions, outdated solutions, fitting
textbook models, understanding the model, acquiring good
input data, hard-to-understand mathematics, obtaining only
one answer, testing the solution, and analyzing the results. In
using the quantitative analysis approach, implementation is not
the final step. There can be a lack of commitment to the
approach and resistance to change.

rents the equipment from a local printing shop when
necessary. The cost of using the equipment is $350.
The materials used in one shirt cost $8, and Gina can
sell these for $15 each.
(a) If Gina sells 20 shirts, what will her total rev-

(b) How many shirts must Gina sell to break even?
What is the total revenue for this?

Ray sell to break even?
1-16 Ray Bond, from Problem 1-15, is trying to find a new
supplier that will reduce his variable cost of produc-

ducing this cost, what would the break-even point be?
1-17 Katherine D’Ann is planning to finance her college
education by selling programs at the football games
for State University. There is a fixed cost of $400 for
printing these programs, and the variable cost is $3.
There is also a $1,000 fee that is paid to the univer-
sity for the right to sell these programs. If Katherine
was able to sell programs for $5 each, how many
would she have to sell in order to break even?
1-18 Katherine D’Ann, from Problem 1-17, has become
concerned that sales may fall, as the team is on a
terrible losing streak, and attendance has fallen off.
In fact, Katherine believes that she will sell only 500
programs for the next game. If it was possible to
raise the selling price of the program and still sell
500, what would the price have to be for Katherine
to break even by selling 500?
1-19 Farris Billiard Supply sells all types of billiard
equipment, and is considering manufacturing their
own brand of pool cues. Mysti Farris, the production
manager, is currently investigating the production of
a standard house pool cue that should be very popu-
lar. Upon analyzing the costs, Mysti determines that
the materials and labor cost for each cue is $25, and
the fixed cost that must be covered is $2,400 per
week. With a selling price of $40 each, how many
pool cues must be sold to break even? What would
the total revenue be at this break-even point?
1-20 Mysti Farris (see Problem 1-19) is considering rais-
ing the selling price of each cue to $50 instead of
$40. If this is done while the costs remain the same,
what would the new break-even point be? What
would the total revenue be at this break-even point?
1-21 Mysti Farris (see Problem 1-19) believes that there
is a high probability that 120 pool cues can be sold
if the selling price is appropriately set. What selling
price would cause the break-even point to be 120?

The students rented a room close to campus for $300
for 3 hours. They developed handouts based on past
tests, and these handouts (including color graphs)
cost $5 each. The tutor was paid $25 per hour, for a
total of $75 for each tutoring session.

six booths for 5 hours at $7 an hour. These fixed costs will
be proportionately allocated to each of the products based on
the percentages provided in the table. For example, the revenue
from soft drinks would be expected to cover 25% of the total
fixed costs.
Maddux wants to be sure that he has a number of things for
President Starr: (1) the total fixed cost that must be covered at
each of the games; (2) the portion of the fixed cost allocated to
each of the items; (3) what his unit sales would be at break-even
for each item—that is, what sales of soft drinks, coffee, hot
dogs, and hamburgers are necessary to cover the portion of the
fixed cost allocated to each of these items; (4) what the dollar
sales for each of these would be at these break-even points; and
(5) realistic sales estimates per attendee for attendance of
60,000 and 35,000. (In other words, he wants to know how
many dollars each attendee is spending on food at his projected
break-even sales at present and if attendance grows to 60,000.)
He felt this last piece of information would be helpful to under-
stand how realistic the assumptions of his model are, and this
information could be compared with similar figures from previ-
ous seasons.

Case Study
Food and Beverages at Southwestern University Football Games
Southwestern University (SWU), a large state college in
Stephenville, Texas, 30 miles southwest of the Dallas/Fort
Worth metroplex, enrolls close to 20,000 students. The school
is the dominant force in the small city, with more students dur-
ing fall and spring than permanent residents.
A longtime football powerhouse, SWU is a member of the
Big Eleven conference and is usually in the top 20 in college
football rankings. To bolster its chances of reaching the elusive
and long-desired number-one ranking, in 2010 SWU hired the
legendary Bo Pitterno as its head coach. Although the number-
one ranking remained out of reach, attendance at the five Satur-
day home games each year increased. Prior to Pitterno’s arrival,
attendance generally averaged 25,000–29,000. Season ticket
sales bumped up by 10,000 just with the announcement of the
new coach’s arrival. Stephenville and SWU were ready to move
to the big time!
With the growth in attendance came more fame, the need
for a bigger stadium, and more complaints about seating, park-
ing, long lines, and concession stand prices. Southwestern Uni-
versity’s president, Dr. Marty Starr, was concerned not only
about the cost of expanding the existing stadium versus build-
ing a new stadium but also about the ancillary activities. He
wanted to be sure that these various support activities generated
revenue adequate to pay for themselves. Consequently, he
wanted the parking lots, game programs, and food service to all
be handled as profit centers. At a recent meeting discussing the
new stadium, Starr told the stadium manager, Hank Maddux,
to develop a break-even chart and related data for each of the
centers. He instructed Maddux to have the food service area
break-even report ready for the next meeting. After discussion
with other facility managers and his subordinates, Maddux de-
veloped the following table showing the suggested selling
prices, and his estimate of variable costs, and the percent rev-
enue by item. It also provides an estimate of the percentage of
the total revenues that would be expected for each of the items
based on historical sales data.
Maddux’s fixed costs are interesting. He estimated that the
prorated portion of the stadium cost would be as follows:
salaries for food services at $100,000 ($20,000 for each of the
five home games); 2,400 square feet of stadium space at $2 per
square foot per game; and six people per booth in each of the

CHAPTER 2 • PROBABILITY CONCEPTS AND APPLICATIONS
2.1
Introduction
Life would be simpler if we knew without doubt what was going to happen in the future. The
outcome of any decision would depend only on how logical and rational the decision was. If
you lost money in the stock market, it would be because you failed to consider all the infor-
mation or to make a logical decision. If you got caught in the rain, it would be because you
simply forgot your umbrella. You could always avoid building a plant that was too large, in-
vesting in a company that would lose money, running out of supplies, or losing crops because
of bad weather. There would be no such thing as a risky investment. Life would be simpler,
but boring.
It wasn’t until the sixteenth century that people started to quantify risks and to apply this
concept to everyday situations. Today, the idea of risk or probability is a part of our lives. “There
is a 40% chance of rain in Omaha today.” “The Florida State University Seminoles are favored 2
to 1 over the Louisiana State University Tigers this Saturday.” “There is a 50–50 chance that the
stock market will reach an all-time high next month.”
A probability is a numerical statement about the likelihood that an event will occur. In this
chapter we examine the basic concepts, terms, and relationships of probability and probability
distributions that are useful in solving many quantitative analysis problems. Table 2.1 lists some
of the topics covered in this book that rely on probability theory. You can see that the study of
quantitative analysis would be quite difficult without it.
A probability is a numerical
statement about the chance that
an event will occur.

Fundamental Concepts
There are two basic rules regarding the mathematics of probability:
1. The probability, P, of any event or state of nature occurring is greater than or equal to 0 and
less than or equal to 1. That is,
(2-1)
A probability of 0 indicates that an event is never expected to occur. A probability of
1 means that an event is always expected to occur.
2. The sum of the simple probabilities for all possible outcomes of an activity must equal 1.
Both of these concepts are illustrated in Example 1.
0 … P1event2 … 1
People often misuse the two basic
rules of probabilities when they
use such statements as, “I’m
110% sure we’re going to win the
big game.”

EXAMPLE 1: TWO RULES OF PROBABILITY Demand for white latex paint at Diversey Paint and
Supply has always been 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 gallons per day. (There are no other possible outcomes
and when one occurs, no other can.) Over the past 200 working days, the owner notes the
following frequencies of demand.
If this past distribution is a good indicator of future sales, we can find the probability
of each possible outcome occurring in the future by converting the data into percentages of
the total:
Thus, the probability that sales are 2 gallons of paint on any given day is 
The probability of any level of sales must be greater than or equal to 0 and less
than or equal to 1. Since 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 gallons exhaust all possible events or outcomes, the
sum of their probability values must equal 1.
Types of Probability
There are two different ways to determine probability: the objective approach and the subjective
approach.
OBJECTIVE PROBABILITY Example 1 provides an illustration of objective probability assessment.
The probability of any paint demand level is the relative frequency of occurrence of that demand
in a large number of trial observations (200 days, in this case). In general,
Objective probability can also be set using what is called the classical or logical method.
Without performing a series of trials, we can often logically determine what the probabilities
P1event2 = Number of occurrences of the event

P12 gallons2 =

CHAPTER 2 • PROBABILITY CONCEPTS AND APPLICATIONS
of various events should be. For example, the probability of tossing a fair coin once and getting
a head is
P1head2 = 1
2
Where do probabilities come
from? Sometimes they are
subjective and based on personal
experiences. Other times they are
objectively based on logical
observations such as the roll of a
die. Often, probabilities are
derived from historical data.
2.3
Mutually Exclusive and Collectively Exhaustive Events
Events are said to be mutually exclusive if only one of the events can occur on any one trial.
They are called collectively exhaustive if the list of outcomes includes every possible
outcome. Many common experiences involve events that have both of these properties. In
tossing a coin, for example, the possible outcomes are a head or a tail. Since both of them
cannot occur on any one toss, the outcomes head and tail are mutually exclusive. Since
obtaining a head and obtaining a tail represent every possible outcome, they are also collec-
tively exhaustive.
EXAMPLE 2: ROLLING A DIE Rolling a die is a simple experiment that has six possible outcomes,
each listed in the following table with its corresponding probability:

1>6

1>6
5

Total 1
Number of ways of getting a head
Number of possible outcomes (head or tail)
Similarly, the probability of drawing a spade out of a deck of 52 playing cards can be logically
set as
P1spade2 = 13
52
Number of chances of drawing a spade
Number of possible outcomes
SUBJECTIVE PROBABILITY When logic and past history are not appropriate, probability values
can be assessed subjectively. The accuracy of subjective probabilities depends on the experience
and judgment of the person making the estimates. A number of probability values cannot be
determined unless the subjective approach is used. What is the probability that the price of gaso-
line will be more than $4 in the next few years? What is the probability that our economy will
be in a severe depression in 2015? What is the probability that you will be president of a major
corporation within 20 years?
There are several methods for making subjective probability assessments. Opinion polls can
be used to help in determining subjective probabilities for possible election returns and potential
political candidates. In some cases, experience and judgment must be used in making subjective
assessments of probability values. A production manager, for example, might believe that the
probability of manufacturing a new product without a single defect is 0.85. In the Delphi
method, a panel of experts is assembled to make their predictions of the future. This approach is
discussed in Chapter 5.

2.3
MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE AND COLLECTIVELY EXHAUSTIVE EVENTS
25
Defining the Problem
The scarcity of liver organs for transplants has reached critical levels in the United States; 1,131 individuals
died in 1997 while waiting for a transplant. With only 4,000 liver donations per year, there are 10,000
patients on the waiting list, with 8,000 being added each year. There is a need to develop a model to
evaluate policies for allocating livers to terminally ill patients who need them.
Developing a Model
Doctors, engineers, researchers, and scientists worked together with Pritsker Corp. consultants in the
process of creating the liver allocation model, called ULAM. One of the model’s jobs would be to evaluate
whether to list potential recipients on a national basis or regionally.
Acquiring Input Data
Historical information was available from the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS), from 1990 to
1995. The data were then stored in ULAM. “Poisson” probability processes described the arrivals of donors
at 63 organ procurement centers and arrival of patients at 106 liver transplant centers.
Developing a Solution
ULAM provides probabilities of accepting an offered liver, where the probability is a function of the
patient’s medical status, the transplant center, and the quality of the offered liver. ULAM also models the
daily probability of a patient changing from one status of criticality to another.
Testing the Solution
Testing involved a comparison of the model output to actual results over the 1992–1994 time period.
Model results were close enough to actual results that ULAM was declared valid.
Analyzing the Results
ULAM was used to compare more than 100 liver allocation policies and was then updated in 1998, with
more recent data, for presentation to Congress.
Implementing the Results
Based on the projected results, the UNOS committee voted 18–0 to implement an allocation policy
based on regional, not national, waiting lists. This decision is expected to save 2,414 lives over an 8-
year period.

These events are both mutually exclusive (on any roll, only one of the six events can occur)
and are also collectively exhaustive (one of them must occur and hence they total in probabil-
ity to 1).
EXAMPLE 3: DRAWING A CARD You are asked to draw one card from a deck of 52 playing cards.
Using a logical probability assessment, it is easy to set some of the relationships, such as
We also see that these events (drawing a 7 and drawing a heart) are not mutually exclusive since
a 7 of hearts can be drawn. They are also not collectively exhaustive since there are other cards
in the deck besides 7s and hearts.
 P1drawing a heart2 = 13>52 = 1>4
 P1drawing a 72 = 4>52 = 1>13

Adding Mutually Exclusive Events
Often we are interested in whether one event or a second event will occur. This is often called
the union of two events. When these two events are mutually exclusive, the law of addition is
simply as follows:
or, more briefly,
(2-2)
For example, we just saw that the events of drawing a spade or drawing a club out of a deck
of cards are mutually exclusive. Since 
and 
the probability of
drawing either a spade or a club is
The Venn diagram in Figure 2.1 depicts the probability of the occurrence of mutually exclusive
events.
Law of Addition for Events That Are Not Mutually Exclusive
When two events are not mutually exclusive, Equation 2-2 must be modified to account for dou-
ble counting. The correct equation reduces the probability by subtracting the chance of both
events occurring together:
This can be expressed in shorter form as
(2-3)
Figure 2.2 illustrates this concept of subtracting the probability of outcomes that are common to
both events. When events are mutually exclusive, the area of overlap, called the intersection, is 0,
as shown in Figure 2.1.
P1A or B2 = P1A2 + P1B2 - P1A and B2
-P1event A and event B both occurring2
P1event A or event B2 = P1event A2 + P1event B2

= 13>52 + 13>52
P1spade or club2 = P1spade2 + P1club2
P1club2 = 13>52,
P1spade2 = 13>52
P1A or B2 = P1A2 + P1B2
P1event A or event B2 = P1event A2 + P1event B2

2.4
STATISTICALLY INDEPENDENT EVENTS
27
Let us consider the events drawing a 5 and drawing a diamond out of the card deck. These
events are not mutually exclusive, so Equation 2-3 must be applied to compute the probability
of either a 5 or a diamond being drawn:
= 1652 = 413
= 452 + 1352 - 152
P1five or diamond2 = P1five2 + P1diamond2 - P1five and diamond2
The formula for adding events
that are not mutually exclusive is

2.4
Statistically Independent Events
Events may be either independent or dependent. When they are independent, the occurrence
of one event has no effect on the probability of occurrence of the second event. Let us examine
four sets of events and determine which are independent:
1. (a) Your education
Dependent events
(b) Your income level
Can you explain why?
2. (a) Draw a jack of hearts from a full 52-card deck
Independent events
(b) Draw a jack of clubs from a full 52-card deck
3. (a) Chicago Cubs win the National League pennant    
Dependent events
(b) Chicago Cubs win the World Series
4. (a) Snow in Santiago, Chile
Independent events
(b) Rain in Tel Aviv, Israel
The three types of probability under both statistical independence and statistical depend-
ence are (1) marginal, (2) joint, and (3) conditional. When events are independent, these three
are very easy to compute, as we shall see.
A marginal (or a simple) probability is just the probability of an event occurring. For exam-
ple, if we toss a fair die, the marginal probability of a 2 landing face up is 
Because each separate toss is an independent event (that is, what we get on the first
toss has absolutely no effect on any later tosses), the marginal probability for each possible out-
come is 
The joint probability of two or more independent events occurring is the product of their
marginal or simple probabilities. This may be written as
(2-4)
where
probability of events A and B occuring together, or one after the other
probability of event A
probability of event B
The probability, for example, of tossing a 6 on the first roll of a die and a 2 on the second
roll is
The third type, conditional probability, is expressed as 
or “the probability of event
B, given that event A has occurred.” Similarly, 
would mean “the conditional probability
of event A, given that event B has taken place.” Since events are independent the occurrence of one
in no way affects the outcome of another, 
and P1BƒA2 = P1B2.

CHAPTER 2 • PROBABILITY CONCEPTS AND APPLICATIONS
EXAMPLE 4: PROBABILITIES WHEN EVENTS ARE INDEPENDENT A bucket contains 3 black balls
and 7 green balls. We draw a ball from the bucket, replace it, and draw a second ball. We can
determine the probability of each of the following events occurring:
1. A black ball is drawn on the first draw:
(This is a marginal probability.)
2. Two green balls are drawn:
(This is a joint probability for two independent events.)
3. A black ball is drawn on the second draw if the first draw is green:
(This is a conditional probability but equal to the marginal
because the two draws are independent events.)
4. A green ball is drawn on the second draw if the first draw was green:
(This is a conditional probability, as in event 3.)
P1GƒG2 = P1G2 = 0.70
P1BƒG2 = P1B2 = 0.30
P1GG2 = P1G2 * P1G2 = 10.7210.72 = 0.49
P1B2 = 0.30
2.5
Statistically Dependent Events
When events are statistically dependent, the occurrence of one event affects the probability of
occurrence of some other event. Marginal, conditional, and joint probabilities exist under
dependence as they did under independence, but the form of the latter two are changed.
A marginal probability is computed exactly as it was for independent events. Again, the
marginal probability of the event A occurring is denoted P(A).
Calculating a conditional probability under dependence is somewhat more involved than it
is under independence. The formula for the conditional probability of A, given that event B has
taken place, is stated as
(2-5)
From Equation 2-5, the formula for a joint probability is
(2-6)
EXAMPLE 5: PROBABILITIES WHEN EVENTS ARE DEPENDENT Assume that we have an urn con-
taining 10 balls of the following descriptions:
4 are white (W) and lettered (L).
2 are white (W) and numbered (N).
3 are yellow (Y) and lettered (L).
1 is yellow (Y) and numbered (N).
You randomly draw a ball from the urn and see that it is yellow. What, then, is the probability
that the ball is lettered? (See Figure 2.3.)
Since there are 10 balls, it is a simple matter to tabulate a series of useful probabilities:
P1N2 = 310 = 0.3, or P1N2 = P1WN2 + P1YN2 = 0.2 + 0.1 = 0.3
P1Y2 = 410 = 0.4, or P1Y2 =
P1YL2 + P1YN2 = 0.3 + 0.1 = 0.4
P1L2 = 710 = 0.7, or P1L2 = P1WL2 +
P1YL2 = 0.4 + 0.3 = 0.7
P1W2 = 610 = 0.6, or P1W2 = P1WL2 + P1WN2 = 0.4 + 0.2 = 0.6
P1WN2 = 210 = 0.2   P1YN2 = 110 = 0.1

We can now calculate the conditional probability that the ball drawn is lettered, given that it
is yellow:
This equation shows that we divided the probability of yellow and lettered balls (3 out of 10) by
the probability of yellow balls (4 out of 10). There is a 0.75 probability that the yellow ball that
you drew is lettered.

you that if the stock market reaches the 12,500-point level by January, there is a 70% probability
that Tubeless Electronics will go up in value. Your own feeling is that there is only a 40% chance
of the market average reaching 12,500 points by January. Can you calculate the probability that
both the stock market will reach 12,500 points and the price of Tubeless Electronics will go up?
Let M represent the event of the stock market reaching the 12,500 level, and let T be the
event that Tubeless goes up in value. Then
Thus, there is only a 28% chance that both events will occur.

Revising Probabilities with Bayes’ Theorem
Bayes’ theorem is used to incorporate additional information as it is made available and help
create revised or posterior probabilities. This means that we can take new or recent data and
then revise and improve upon our old probability estimates for an event (see Figure 2.4). Let us
consider the following example.
EXAMPLE 7: POSTERIOR PROBABILITIES A cup contains two dice identical in appearance. One,
however, is fair (unbiased) and the other is loaded (biased). The probability of rolling a 3 on the
fair die is 
or 0.166. The probability of tossing the same number on the loaded die is 0.60.

Using Bayes’ Process
We have no idea which die is which, but select one by chance and toss it. The result is
a 3. Given this additional piece of information, can we find the (revised) probability that
the die rolled was fair? Can we determine the probability that it was the loaded die that was
rolled?
The answer to these questions is yes, and we do so by using the formula for joint probabil-
ity under statistical dependence and Bayes’ theorem. First, we take stock of the information and
probabilities available. We know, for example, that since we randomly selected the die to roll,
the probability of it being fair or loaded is 0.50:
We also know that
Next, we compute joint probabilities P(3 and fair) and P(3 and loaded) using the formula
A 3 can occur in combination with the state “fair die” or in combination with the state “loaded
die.” The sum of their probabilities gives the unconditional or marginal probability of a 3 on the
toss, namely, 
If a 3 does occur, and if we do not know which die it came from, the probability that the die
rolled was the fair one is
The probability that the die rolled was loaded is
These two conditional probabilities are called the revised or posterior probabilities for the next
roll of the die.
Before the die was rolled in the preceding example, the best we could say was that there
was a 50–50 chance that it was fair (0.50 probability) and a 50–50 chance that it was loaded.
After one roll of the die, however, we are able to revise our prior probability estimates. The
new posterior estimate is that there is a 0.78 probability that the die rolled was loaded and only a
0.22 probability that it was not.
Using a table is often helpful in performing the calculations associated with Bayes
Theorem. Table 2.2 provides the general layout for this, and Table 2.3 provides this specific
example.

Revised probabilities can also be computed in a more direct way using a general form for Bayes’
theorem:

the complement of the event A;
for example, if A is the event “fair die,” then 
is “loaded die”
We originally saw in Equation 2-5 the conditional probability of event A, given event B, is
Thomas Bayes derived his theorem from this. Appendix 2.1 shows the mathematical steps lead-
ing to Equation 2-7. Now let’s return to Example 7.
Although it may not be obvious to you at first glance, we used this basic equation to com-
pute the revised probabilities. For example, if we want the probability that the fair die was rolled
given the first toss was a 3, namely, P(fair die | 3 rolled), we can let
We can then rewrite Equation 2-7 and solve as follows:
This is the same answer that we computed in Example 7. Can you use this alternative approach to
show that P loaded die | 3 rolled
Either method is perfectly acceptable, but when we deal
with probability revisions again in Chapter 3, we may find that Equation 2-7 or the tabular approach
is easier to apply. An Excel spreadsheet will be used in Chapter 3 for the tabular approach.

Further Probability Revisions
Although one revision of prior probabilities can provide useful posterior probability estimates,
additional information can be gained from performing the experiment a second time. If it is
financially worthwhile, a decision maker may even decide to make several more revisions.
EXAMPLE 8: A SECOND PROBABILITY REVISION Returning to Example 7, we now attempt to
obtain further information about the posterior probabilities as to whether the die just rolled is
fair or loaded. To do so, let us toss the die a second time. Again, we roll a 3. What are the fur-
ther revised probabilities?
To answer this question, we proceed as before, with only one exception. The probabili-
ties 
and 
remain the same, but now we must compute
and 
With these
joint probabilities of two 3s on successive rolls, given the two types of dice, we may revise the
probabilities:
Thus, the probability of rolling two 3s, a marginal probability, is 
the
sum of the two joint probabilities:

Flight Safety and Probability Analysis
With the horrific events of September 11, 2001, and the use
of airplanes as weapons of mass destruction, airline safety has be-
come an even more important international issue. How can we
reduce the impact of terrorism on air safety? What can be done
to make air travel safer overall? One answer is to evaluate various
air safety programs and to use probability theory in the analysis
of the costs of these programs.
Determining airline safety is a matter of applying the con-
cepts of objective probability analysis. The chance of getting
killed in a scheduled domestic flight is about 1 in 5 million. This
is probability of about .0000002. Another measure is the num-
ber of deaths per passenger mile flown. The number is about 1
passenger per billion passenger miles flown, or a probability of
about .000000001. Without question, flying is safer than many
other forms of transportation, including driving. For a typical
weekend, more people are killed in car accidents than a typical
air disaster.
Analyzing new airline safety measures involves costs and the
subjective probability that lives will be saved. One airline expert
proposed a number of new airline safety measures. When the
costs involved and probability of saving lives were taken into
account, the result was about a $1 billion cost for every life saved
on average. Using probability analysis will help determine which
safety programs will result in the greatest benefit, and these
programs can be expanded.
In addition, some proposed safety issues are not completely
certain. For example, a Thermal Neutron Analysis device to detect
explosives at airports had a probability of .15 of giving a false
alarm, resulting in a high cost of inspection and long flight delays.
This would indicate that money should be spent on developing
more reliable equipment for detecting explosives. The result
would be safer air travel with fewer unnecessary delays.
Without question, the use of probability analysis to determine
and improve flight safety is indispensable. Many transportation
experts hope that the same rigorous probability models used in
the airline industry will some day be applied to the much more
deadly system of highways and the drivers who use them.

What has this second roll accomplished? Before we rolled the die the first time, we knew
only that there was a 0.50 probability that it was either fair or loaded. When the first die was
rolled in Example 7, we were able to revise these probabilities:
Now, after the second roll in Example 8, our refined revisions tell us that
This type of information can be extremely valuable in business decision making.

 probability the die is fair = 0.067

Random Variables
We have just discussed various ways of assigning probability values to the outcomes of an
experiment. Let us now use this probability information to compute the expected outcome, vari-
ance, and standard deviation of the experiment. This can help select the best decision among a
number of alternatives.
A random variable assigns a real number to every possible outcome or event in an exper-
iment. It is normally represented by a letter such as X or Y. When the outcome itself is numeri-
cal or quantitative, the outcome numbers can be the random variable. For example, consider
refrigerator sales at an appliance store. The number of refrigerators sold during a given day can
be the random variable. Using X to represent this random variable, we can express this rela-
tionship as follows:
In general, whenever the experiment has quantifiable outcomes, it is beneficial to define these
quantitative outcomes as the random variable. Examples are given in Table 2.4.
When the outcome itself is not numerical or quantitative, it is necessary to define a random
variable that associates each outcome with a unique real number. Several examples are given in
Table 2.5.
There are two types of random variables: discrete random variables and continuous ran-
dom variables. Developing probability distributions and making computations based on these
distributions depends on the type of random variable.
A random variable is a discrete random variable if it can assume only a finite or limited set
of values. Which of the random variables in Table 2.4 are discrete random variables? Looking at
Table 2.4, we can see that stocking 50 Christmas trees, inspecting 600 items, and sending out
5,000 letters are all examples of discrete random variables. Each of these random variables can
assume only a finite or limited set of values. The number of Christmas trees sold, for example,
can only be integer numbers from 0 to 50. There are 51 values that the random variable X can
assume in this example.
X = number of refrigerators sold during the day
Try to develop a few more
examples of discrete random
variables to be sure you
understand this concept.

34
CHAPTER 2 • PROBABILITY CONCEPTS AND APPLICATIONS
A continuous random variable is a random variable that has an infinite or an unlimited set
of values. Are there any examples of continuous random variables in Table 2.4 or 2.5? Looking
at Table 2.4, we can see that testing the lifetime of a lightbulb is an experiment that can be
described with a continuous random variable. In this case, the random variable, S, is the time
the bulb burns. It can last for 3,206 minutes, 6,500.7 minutes, 251.726 minutes, or any other
value between 0 and 80,000 minutes. In most cases, the range of a continuous random variable
is stated as: lower value

Probability Distributions
Earlier we discussed the probability values of an event. We now explore the properties of
probability distributions. We see how popular distributions, such as the normal, Poisson, bino-
mial, and exponential probability distributions, can save us time and effort. Since a random vari-
able may be discrete or continuous, we consider each of these types separately.
Probability Distribution of a Discrete Random Variable
When we have a discrete random variable, there is a probability value assigned to each event.
These values must be between 0 and 1, and they must sum to 1. Let’s look at an example.
The 100 students in Pat Shannon’s statistics class have just completed a math quiz that he
gives on the first day of class. The quiz consists of five very difficult algebra problems. The
grade on the quiz is the number of correct answers, so the grades theoretically could range from
0 to 5. However, no one in this class received a score of 0, so the grades ranged from 1 to 5. The
random variable X is defined to be the grade on this quiz, and the grades are summarized in
Table 2.6. This discrete probability distribution was developed using the relative frequency
approach presented earlier.

PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS

The distribution follows the three rules required of all probability distributions: (1) the
events are mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive, (2) the individual probability values
are between 0 and 1 inclusive, and (3) the total of the probability values sum to 1.
Although listing the probability distribution as we did in Table 2.6 is adequate, it can be dif-
ficult to get an idea about characteristics of the distribution. To overcome this problem, the prob-
ability values are often presented in graph form. The graph of the distribution in Table 2.6 is
shown in Figure 2.5.
The graph of this probability distribution gives us a picture of its shape. It helps us identify
the central tendency of the distribution, called the mean or expected value, and the amount of
variability or spread of the distribution, called the variance.
Expected Value of a Discrete Probability Distribution
Once we have established a probability distribution, the first characteristic that is usually of
interest is the central tendency of the distribution. The expected value, a measure of central
tendency, is computed as the weighted average of the values of the random variable:

puted for the quiz scores:

CHAPTER 2 • PROBABILITY CONCEPTS AND APPLICATIONS
Variance of a Discrete Probability Distribution
In addition to the central tendency of a probability distribution, most people are interested in the
variability or the spread of the distribution. If the variability is low, it is much more likely that
the outcome of an experiment will be close to the average or expected value. On the other hand,
if the variability of the distribution is high, which means that the probability is spread out over
the various random variable values, there is less chance that the outcome of an experiment will
be close to the expected value.
The variance of a probability distribution is a number that reveals the overall spread or
dispersion of the distribution. For a discrete probability distribution, it can be computed using
the following equation:
(2-9)
where
variable’s possible values
value of the random variable
difference between each value of the random variable 
and the expected value
of each possible value of the random variable
To compute the variance, each value of the random variable is subtracted from the expected
value, squared, and multiplied times the probability of occurrence of that value. The results are
then summed to obtain the variance. Here is how this procedure is done for Dr. Shannon’s quiz
scores:
A related measure of dispersion or spread is the standard deviation. This quantity is also
used in many computations involved with probability distributions. The standard deviation is
just the square root of the variance:
(2-10)
where
The standard deviation for the random variable X in the example is
These calculations are easily performed in Excel. Program 2.1A shows the inputs and formulas in
Excel for calculating the mean, variance, and standard deviation in this example. Program 2.1B
provides the output for this example.
Probability Distribution of a Continuous Random Variable
There are many examples of continuous random variables. The time it takes to finish a
project, the number of ounces in a barrel of butter, the high temperature during a given day,
the exact length of a given type of lumber, and the weight of a railroad car of coal are all

examples of continuous random variables. Since random variables can take on an infinite
number of values, the fundamental probability rules for continuous random variables must
be modified.
As with discrete probability distributions, the sum of the probability values must equal 1.
Because there are an infinite number of values of the random variables, however, the probability
of each value of the random variable must be 0. If the probability values for the random variable
values were greater than 0, the sum would be infinitely large.
With a continuous probability distribution, there is a continuous mathematical function that
describes the probability distribution. This function is called the probability density function or
simply the probability function. It is usually represented by 
. When working with contin-
uous probability distributions, the probability function can be graphed, and the area underneath
the curve represents probability. Thus, to find any probability, we simply find the area under the
curve associated with the range of interest.
We now look at the sketch of a sample density function in Figure 2.6. This curve repre-
sents the probability density function for the weight of a particular machined part. The
weight could vary from 5.06 to 5.30 grams, with weights around 5.18 grams being the
most likely. The shaded area represents the probability the weight is between 5.22 and
5.26 grams.
If we wanted to know the probability of a part weighing exactly 5.1300000 grams, for
example, we would have to compute the area of a line of width 0. Of course, this would be 0.
This result may seem strange, but if we insist on enough decimal places of accuracy, we
are bound to find that the weight differs from 5.1300000 grams exactly, be the difference
ever so slight.

CHAPTER 2 • PROBABILITY CONCEPTS AND APPLICATIONS
2.10
The Binomial Distribution
Many business experiments can be characterized by the Bernoulli process. The probability
of obtaining specific outcomes in a Bernoulli process is described by the binomial probabil-
ity distribution. In order to be a Bernoulli process, an experiment must have the following
characteristics:
1. Each trial in a Bernoulli process has only two possible outcomes. These are typically called
a success and a failure, although examples might be yes or no, heads or tails, pass or fail,
defective or good, and so on.
2. The probability stays the same from one trial to the next.
3. The trials are statistically independent.
4. The number of trials is a positive integer.
A common example of this process is tossing a coin.
The binomial distribution is used to find the probability of a specific number of suc-
cesses out of n trials of a Bernoulli process. To find this probability, it is necessary to know
the following:
We let
q = 1 - p = the probability of a failure
r = the number of successes
p = the probability of a success on any single trial
n = the number of trials
This is important because it means that, for any continuous distribution, the probability does
not change if a single point is added to the range of values that is being considered. In Figure 2.6
this means the following probabilities are all exactly the same:
The inclusion or exclusion of either endpoint (5.22 or 5.26) has no impact on the probability. 
In this section we have investigated the fundamental characteristics and properties
of probability distributions in general. In the next three sections we introduce three impor-
tant continuous distributions—the normal distribution, the F distribution, and the exponen-
tial distribution—and two discrete distributions—the Poisson distribution and the binomial
distribution.

Solving Problems with the Binomial Formula
A common example of a binomial distribution is the tossing of a coin and counting the number
of heads. For example, if we wished to find the probability of 4 heads in 5 tosses of a coin, we
would have
Thus,
Thus, the probability of 4 heads in 5 tosses of a coin is 0.15625 or about 16%.
Using Equation 2-11, it is also possible to find the entire probability distribution (all the
possible values for r and the corresponding probabilities) for a binomial experiment. The
probability distribution for the number of heads in 5 tosses of a fair coin is shown in Table 2.7
and then graphed in Figure 2.7.

Solving Problems with Binomial Tables
MSA Electronics is experimenting with the manufacture of a new type of transistor that is very
difficult to mass produce at an acceptable quality level. Every hour a supervisor takes a random
sample of 5 transistors produced on the assembly line. The probability that any one transistor is
defective is considered to be 0.15. MSA wants to know the probability of finding 3, 4, or 5 de-
fectives if the true percentage defective is 15%.
For this problem,

for each of these values, it is easier to use binomial tables for this. Appendix B gives a binomial
table for a broad range of values for n, r, and p. A portion of this appendix is shown in Table 2.8.
To find these probabilities, we look through the

The expected value and variance for the MSA Electronics example are computed as
follows:
Programs 2.2A and 2.2B illustrate how Excel is used for binomial probabilities.
 Variance = np11 - p2 = 510.15210.852 = 0.6375
 Expected value = np = 510.152 = 0.75
Using the cell references eliminates the need to retype the formula
if you change a parameter such as p or r.

The Normal Distribution
One of the most popular and useful continuous probability distributions is the normal distribu-
tion. The probability density function of this distribution is given by the rather complex formula
(2-14)
The normal distribution is specified completely when values for the mean, 
and the stan-
dard deviation, 
are known. Figure 2.8 shows several different normal distributions with the
same standard deviation and different means. As shown, differing values of 
will shift the aver-
age or center of the normal distribution. The overall shape of the distribution remains the same.
On the other hand, when the standard deviation is varied, the normal curve either flattens out or
becomes steeper. This is shown in Figure 2.9.
As the standard deviation, 
becomes smaller, the normal distribution becomes steeper.
When the standard deviation becomes larger, the normal distribution has a tendency to flatten
out or become broader.

The normal distribution affects a
large number of processes in our
lives (for example, filling boxes of
cereal with 32 ounces of corn
flakes). Each normal distribution
depends on the mean and
standard deviation.

Probability Assessments of Curling Champions
Probabilities are used every day in sporting activities. In many
sporting events, there are questions involving strategies that must
be answered to provide the best chance of winning the game. In
baseball, should a particular batter be intentionally walked in key
situations at the end of the game? In football, should a team
elect to try for a two-point conversion after a touchdown? In soc-
cer, should a penalty kick ever be aimed directly at the goal
keeper? In curling, in the last round, or “end” of a game, is it bet-
ter to be behind by one point and have the hammer or is it better
to be ahead by one point and not have the hammer? An attempt
was made to answer this last question.
In curling, a granite stone, or “rock,” is slid across a sheet of
ice 14 feet wide and 146 feet long. Four players on each of two
teams take alternating turns sliding the rock, trying to get it as
close as possible to the center of a circle called the “house.” The
team with the rock closest to this scores points. The team that is
behind at the completion of a round or end has the advantage in
the next end by being the last team to slide the rock. This team is
said to “have the hammer.” A survey was taken of a group of ex-
perts in curling, including a number of former world champions.
In this survey, about 58% of the respondents favored having the
hammer and being down by one going into the last end. Only
about 42% preferred being ahead and not having the hammer.
Data were also collected from 1985 to 1997 at the Canadian
Men’s Curling Championships (also called the Brier). Based on the
results over this time period, it is better to be ahead by one point
and not have the hammer at the end of the ninth end rather than
be behind by one and have the hammer, as many people prefer.
This differed from the survey results. Apparently, world champi-
ons and other experts preferred to have more control of their des-
tiny by having the hammer even though it put them in a worse
situation.

IN ACTION
Area Under the Normal Curve
Because the normal distribution is symmetrical, its midpoint (and highest point) is at the mean.
Values on the X axis are then measured in terms of how many standard deviations they lie from
the mean. As you may recall from our earlier discussion of probability distributions, the area
under the curve (in a continuous distribution) describes the probability that a random variable has
a value in a specified interval. When dealing with the uniform distribution, it is easy to compute
the area between any points a and b. The normal distribution requires mathematical calculations
beyond the scope of this book, but tables that provide areas or probabilities are readily available.
Using the Standard Normal Table
When finding probabilities for the normal distribution, it is best to draw the normal curve and
shade the area corresponding to the probability being sought. The normal distribution table can
then be used to find probabilities by following two steps.
Step 1. Convert the normal distribution to what we call a standard normal distribution.
A standard normal distribution has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. All normal tables

Without a standard normal
distribution, a different table would be needed for each pair of 
and 
values. We call the new
standard random variable Z. The value for Z for any normal distribution is computed from this
equation:
(2-15)
where

of standard deviations from X to the mean, 
For example, if 
and we are interested in finding the probability that the
random variable X is less than 130, we want 
This means that the point X is 2.0 standard deviations to the right of the mean. This is shown in
Figure 2.10.
Step 2. Look up the probability from a table of normal curve areas. Table 2.9, which also
appears as Appendix A, is such a table of areas for the standard normal distribution. It is set up
to provide the area under the curve to the left of any specified value of Z.
Let’s see how Table 2.9 can be used. The column on the left lists values of Z, with the sec-
ond decimal place of Z appearing in the top row. For example, for a value of 
as just
computed, find 2.0 in the left-hand column and 0.00 in the top row. In the body of the table, we
find that the area sought is 0.97725, or 97.7%. Thus,
This suggests that if the mean IQ score is 100, with a standard deviation of 15 points, the
probability that a randomly selected person’s IQ is less than 130 is 97.7%. This is also the prob-
ability that the IQ is less than or equal to 130. To find the probability that the IQ is greater than
130, we simply note that this is the complement of the previous event and the total area under
the curve (the total probability) is 1. Thus,
P1X 7 1302 = 1 - P1X … 1302 = 1 - P1Z … 22 = 1 - 0.97725 = 0.02275
P1X 6 1302 = P1Z 6 2.002 = 97.7%

CHAPTER 2 • PROBABILITY CONCEPTS AND APPLICATIONS
While Table 2.9 does not give negative Z values, the symmetry of the normal distribution
can be used to find probabilities associated with negative Z values. For example,
To feel comfortable with the use of the standard normal probability table, we need to work
a few more examples. We now use the Haynes Construction Company as a case in point.
Haynes Construction Company Example
Haynes Construction Company builds primarily three- and four-unit apartment buildings (called
triplexes and quadraplexes) for investors, and it is believed that the total construction time in
days follows a normal distribution. The mean time to construct a triplex is 100 days, and the
standard deviation is 20 days. Recently, the president of Haynes Construction signed a contract
to complete a triplex in 125 days. Failure to complete the triplex in 125 days would result in se-
vere penalty fees. What is the probability that Haynes Construction will not be in violation of
their construction contract? The normal distribution for the construction of triplexes is shown in
Figure 2.11.
To compute this probability, we need to find the shaded area under the curve. We begin by
computing Z for this problem:
Looking in Table 2.9 for a Z value of 1.25, we find an area under the curve of 0.89435. We
do this by looking up 1.2 in the left-hand column of the table and then moving to the 0.05 col-
umn to find the value for 
Therefore, the probability of not violating the contract is
0.89435, or about an 89% chance.
Now let us look at the Haynes problem from another perspective. If the firm finishes this
triplex in 75 days or less, it will be awarded a bonus payment of $5,000. What is the probability
that Haynes will receive the bonus?

TABLE 2.9
Standardized Normal Distribution Function

CHAPTER 2 • PROBABILITY CONCEPTS AND APPLICATIONS
Figure 2.12 illustrates the probability we are looking for in the shaded area. The first step is
again to compute the Z value:
This Z value indicates that 75 days is –1.25 standard deviations to the left of the mean. But the
standard normal table is structured to handle only positive Z values. To solve this problem, we
observe that the curve is symmetric. The probability that Haynes will finish in 75 days or less
is equivalent to the probability that it will finish in more than 125 days. A moment ago (in
Figure 2.11) we found the probability that Haynes will finish in less than 125 days. That value
is 0.89435. So the probability it takes more than 125 days is
Thus, the probability of completing the triplex in 75 days or less is 0.10565, or about 11%.
One final example: What is the probability that the triplex will take between 110 and 125
days? We see in Figure 2.13 that
That is, the shaded area in the graph can be computed by finding the probability of com-
pleting the building in 125 days or less minus the probability of completing it in 110 days
or less.

CHAPTER 2 • PROBABILITY CONCEPTS AND APPLICATIONS
The Empirical Rule
While the probability tables for the normal distribution can provide precise probabilities, many
situations require less precision. The empirical rule was derived from the normal distribution
and is an easy way to remember some basic information about normal distributions. The empiri-
cal rule states that for a normal distribution
approximately 68% of the values will be within 1 standard deviation of the mean
approximately 95% of the values will be within 2 standard deviations of the mean
almost all (about 99.7%) of the values will be within 3 standard deviations of the mean
Figure 2.14 illustrates the empirical rule. The area from point a to point b in the first drawing
represents the probability, approximately 68%, that the random variable will be within 1 stan-
dard deviation of the mean. The middle drawing illustrates the probability, approximately 95%,
that the random variable will be within 2 standard deviations of the mean. The last drawing
illustrates the probability, about 99.7% (almost all), that the random variable will be within
3 standard deviations of the mean.

Figure 2.14 is very important,

meanings of ±1, 2, and 3
standard deviation symmetrical
areas.
Managers often speak of 95%
and 99% confidence intervals,
which roughly refer to ±2 and 3
standard deviation graphs.
2.12
The F Distribution
The F distribution is a continuous probability distribution that is helpful in testing hypotheses
about variances. The F distribution will be used in Chapter 4 when regression models are tested
for significance. Figure 2.15 provides a graph of the F distribution. As with a graph for any con-
tinuous distribution, the area underneath the curve represents probability. Note that for a large
value of F, the probability is very small.

2.12
THE F DISTRIBUTION

Fα
FIGURE 2.15
The F Distribution
The F statistic is the ratio of two sample variances from independent normal distributions.
Every F distribution has two sets of degrees of freedom associated with it. One of the degrees of
freedom is associated with the numerator of the ratio, and the other is associated with the
denominator of the ratio. The degrees of freedom are based on the sample sizes used in calculat-
ing the numerator and denominator.
Appendix D provides values of F associated with the upper tail of the distribution for cer-
tain probabilities (denoted by ) and degrees of freedom for the numerator 
and degrees of
freedom for the denominator 
.
To find the F value that is associated with a particular probability and degrees of freedom,
refer to Appendix D. The following notation will be used:
Consider the following example:
From Appendix D, we get
This means
The probability is very low (only 5%) that the F value will exceed 4.39. There is a 95% proba-
bility that it will not exceed 4.39. This is illustrated in Figure 2.16. Appendix D also provides
F values associated with

The Exponential Distribution
The exponential distribution, also called the negative exponential distribution, is used in dealing
with queuing problems. The exponential distribution often describes the time required to service
a customer. The exponential distribution is a continuous distribution. Its probability function is
given by
(2-16)
where
variable (service times)
number of units the service facility can handle in a specific period of time
(the base of the natural logarithm)

THE EXPONENTIAL DISTRIBUTION
51
The general shape of the exponential distribution is shown in Figure 2.17. Its expected value
and variance can be shown to be
(2-17)
(2-18)
As with any other continuous distribution, probabilities are found by determining the area under
the curve. For the normal distribution, we found the area by using a table of probabilities. For
the exponential distribution, the probabilities can be found using the exponent key on a calcula-
tor with the formula below. The probability that an exponentially distributed time (X) required
to serve a customer is less than or equal to time t is given by the formula
(2-19)
The time period used in describing μ determines the units for the time t. For example, if μ is the
average number served per hour, the time t must be given in hours. If μ is the average number
served per minute, the time t must be given in minutes.
Arnold’s Muffler Example
Arnold’s Muffler Shop installs new mufflers on automobiles and small trucks. The mechanic
can install new mufflers at a rate of about three per hour, and this service time is exponentially
distributed. What is the probability that the time to install a new muffler would be 
hour or
less? Using Equation 2-19 we have
Figure 2.18 shows the area under the curve from 0 to 0.5 to be 0.7769. Thus, there is about a
78% chance the time will be no more than 0.5 hour and about a 22% chance that the time will
be longer than this. Similarly, we could find the probability that the service time is no more 1/3
hour or 2/3 hour, as follows:
 PaX … 2
3b = 1 - e-3A2
3B = 1 - e-2 = 1 - 0.1353 = 0.8647
 PaX … 1
3b = 1 - e-3A1
3B = 1 - e-1 = 1 - 0.3679 = 0.6321
P1X … 0.52 = 1 - e-310.52 = 1 - e-1.5 = 1 - 0.2231 = 0.7769

While Equation 2-19 provides the probability that the time (X) is less than or equal to a particu-
lar value t, the probability that the time is greater than a particular value t is found by observing
that these two events are complementary. For example, to find the probability that the mechanic
at Arnold’s Muffler Shop would take longer than 0.5 hour, we have

The Poisson Distribution
An important discrete probability distribution is the Poisson distribution.1 We examine it
because of its key role in complementing the exponential distribution in queuing theory in
Chapter 13. The distribution describes situations in which customers arrive independently dur-
ing a certain time interval, and the number of arrivals depends on the length of the time interval.
The Poisson probability
distribution is used in many
queuing models to represent
arrival patterns.
1This distribution, derived by Simeon Denis Poisson in 1837, is pronounced “pwah-sahn.”

2.14
THE POISSON DISTRIBUTION
53
Examples are patients arriving at a health clinic, customers arriving at a bank window, passen-
gers arriving at an airport, and telephone calls going through a central exchange.
The formula for the Poisson distribution is
(2-20)
where
of exactly X arrivals or occurrences
average number of arrivals per unit of time (the mean arrival rate), 
pronounced “lambda”
the base of the natural logarithm
of occurrences 
The mean and variance of the Poisson distribution are equal and are computed simply as
(2-21)
(2-22)
With the help of the table in Appendix C, the values of 
are easy to find. We can use these 
in the formula to find probabilities. For example, if 
from Appendix C we find
The Poisson probabilities that X is 0, 1, and 2 when 
are as follows:
These probabilities, as well as others for 
and 
are shown in Figure 2.19. Notice
that the chances that 9 or more customers will arrive in a particular time period are virtually nil.
Programs 2.6A and 2.6B illustrate how Excel can be used to find Poisson probabilities.
It should be noted that the exponential and Poisson distributions are related. If the number of oc-
currences per time period follows a Poisson distribution, then the time between occurrences follows
an exponential distribution. For example, if the number of phone calls arriving at a customer service
center followed a Poisson distribution with a mean of 10 calls per hour, the time between each phone
call would be exponentially distributed with a mean time between calls of 
hour (6 minutes).

Summary
This chapter presents the fundamental concepts of probability
and probability distributions. Probability values can be obtained
objectively or subjectively. A single probability value must be
between 0 and 1, and the sum of all probability values for all
possible outcomes must be equal to 1. In addition, probability
values and events can have a number of properties. These prop-
erties include mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive, sta-
tistically independent, and statistically dependent events. Rules
for computing probability values depend on these fundamental
properties. It is also possible to revise probability values when
new information becomes available. This can be done using
Bayes’ theorem.
We also covered the topics of random variables, discrete
probability distributions (such as Poisson and binomial), and
continuous probability distributions (such as normal, F, and
exponential). A probability distribution is any statement of a
probability function having a set of collectively exhaustive and
mutually exclusive events. All probability distributions follow
the basic probability rules mentioned previously.
The topics presented here will be very important in many
of the chapters to come. Basic probability concepts and distri-
butions are used for decision theory, inventory control, Markov
analysis, project management, simulation, and statistical qual-
ity control.

2-20 David Mashley teaches two undergraduate statistics
courses at Kansas College. The class for Statistics 201
consists of 7 sophomores and 3 juniors. The more ad-
vanced course, Statistics 301, has 2 sophomores and
8 juniors enrolled. As an example of a business sam-
pling technique, Professor Mashley randomly selects,
from the stack of Statistics 201 registration cards, the
class card of one student and then places that card
back in the stack. If that student was a sophomore,
Mashley draws another card from the Statistics 201
stack; if not, he randomly draws a card from the Sta-
tistics 301 group. Are these two draws independent
events? What is the probability of
(a) a junior’s name on the first draw?
(b) a junior’s name on the second draw, given that a
sophomore’s name was drawn first?
(c) a junior’s name on the second draw, given that a
junior’s name was drawn first?

2-21 The oasis outpost of Abu Ilan, in the heart of the
Negev desert, has a population of 20 Bedouin tribes-
men and 20 Farima tribesmen. El Kamin, a nearby
oasis, has a population of 32 Bedouins and 8 Farima.
A lost Israeli soldier, accidentally separated from his
army unit, is wandering through the desert and ar-
rives at the edge of one of the oases. The soldier has
no idea which oasis he has found, but the first person
he spots at a distance is a Bedouin. What is the prob-
ability that he wandered into Abu Ilan? What is the
probability that he is in El Kamin?
2-22 The lost Israeli soldier mentioned in Problem 2-21
decides to rest for a few minutes before entering the
desert oasis he has just found. Closing his eyes, he
dozes off for 15 minutes, wakes, and walks toward
the center of the oasis. The first person he spots this
time he again recognizes as a Bedouin. What is the
posterior probability that he is in El Kamin?
2-23 Ace Machine Works estimates that the probability
its lathe tool is properly adjusted is 0.8. When the
lathe is properly adjusted, there is a 0.9 probability

good part being produced is only 0.2. A part ran-
domly chosen is inspected and found to be accept-
able. At this point, what is the posterior probability
that the lathe tool is properly adjusted?

the probability that there will be 0 defective cases if
the process is operating correctly? What is the prob-
ability that there will be exactly 1 defective case?
2-36 Refer to the Trowbridge Manufacturing example in
Problem 2-35. The quality control inspection proce-
dure is to select 6 items, and if there are 0 or 1 de-
fective cases in the group of 6, the process is said to
be in control. If the number of defects is more than
1, the process is out of control. Suppose that the true
proportion of defective items is 0.15. What is the
probability that there will be 0 or 1 defects in a sam-
ple of 6 if the true proportion of defects is 0.15?
2-37 An industrial oven used to cure sand cores for a

dard deviation of 25°F. Leslie Larsen, president of
the factory, is concerned about the large number of
defective cores that have been produced in the past
several months. If the oven gets hotter than 475°F,
the core is defective. What is the probability that the
oven will cause a core to be defective? What is the

of Medical Suppliers, Inc., for the past 17 years.
Medical Suppliers, Inc., is a producer of bandages
and arm slings. During the past 5 years, the de-

2-40 Armstrong Faber produces a standard number-two
pencil called Ultra-Lite. Since Chuck Armstrong
started Armstrong Faber, sales have grown steadily.
With the increase in the price of wood products,
however, Chuck has been forced to increase the
price of the Ultra-Lite pencils. As a result, the
demand for Ultra-Lite has been fairly stable over
the past 6 years. On the average, Armstrong Faber
has sold 457,000 pencils each year. Furthermore,
90% of the time sales have been between 454,000
and 460,000 pencils. It is expected that the sales
follow a normal distribution with a mean of
457,000 pencils. Estimate the standard deviation of
this distribution. (Hint: Work backward from the
normal table to find Z. Then apply Equation 2-15.)

2-42 A new integrated computer system is to be installed
worldwide for a major corporation. Bids on this
project are being solicited, and the contract will be
awarded to one of the bidders. As a part of the pro-
posal for this project, bidders must specify how
long the project will take. There will be a significant
penalty for finishing late. One potential contractor
determines that the average time to complete a proj-
ect of this type is 40 weeks with a standard devia-
tion of 5 weeks. The time required to complete this
project is assumed to be normally distributed.
(a) If the due date of this project is set at 40 weeks,
what is the probability that the contractor will
have to pay a penalty (i.e., the project will not
be finished on schedule)?
(b) If the due date of this project is set at 43 weeks,
what is the probability that the contractor will
have to pay a penalty (i.e., the project will not
be finished on schedule)?
(c) If the bidder wishes to set the due date in the
proposal so that there is only a 5% chance of
being late (and consequently only a 5% chance
of having to pay a penalty), what due date
should be set?
2-43 Patients arrive at the emergency room of Costa Val-

present, the test will accurately indicate this 95% of
the time. However, if steroids are not present, the
test will indicate this 90% of the time (so it is wrong
10% of the time and predicts the presence of
steroids). Based on past data, it is believed that 2%
of the athletes do use steroids. This test is adminis-
tered to one athlete, and the test is positive for
steroids. What is the probability that this person
actually used steroids?
2-47 Market Researchers, Inc., has been hired to perform
a study to determine if the market for a new product
will be good or poor. In similar studies performed in
the past, whenever the market actually was good, the
market research study indicated that it would be
good 85% of the time. On the other hand, whenever
the market actually was poor, the market study in-
correctly predicted it would be good 20% of the
time. Before the study is performed, it is believed
there is a 70% chance the market will be good.
When Market Researchers, Inc. performs the study
for this product, the results predict the market will
be good. Given the results of this study, what is the
probability that the market actually will be good?
2-48 Policy Pollsters is a market research firm specializing
in political polls. Records indicate in past elections,

accurately predicted this 80 percent of the time and
they were wrong 20% of the time. Records also show
for losing candidates, Policy Pollsters accurately pre-
dicted they would lose 90 percent of the time and they
were only wrong 10% of the time. Before the poll is
taken, there is a 50% chance of winning the election.
If Policy Pollsters predicts a candidate will win the
election, what is the probability that the candidate will
actually win? If Policy Pollsters predicts that a candi-
date will lose the election, what is the probability that
the candidate will actually lose?
2-49 Burger City is a large chain of fast-food restaurants
specializing in gourmet hamburgers. A mathemati-
cal model is now used to predict the success of new
restaurants based on location and demographic in-
formation for that area. In the past, 70% of all
restaurants that were opened were successful. The
mathematical model has been tested in the existing
restaurants to determine how effective it is. For the
restaurants that were successful, 90% of the time the
model predicted they would be, while 10% of the
time the model predicted a failure. For the restau-
rants that were not successful, when the mathemati-
cal model was applied, 20% of the time it incorrectly
predicted a successful restaurant while 80% of the
time it was accurate and predicted an unsuccessful
restaurant. If the model is used on a new location
and predicts the restaurant will be successful, what
is the probability that it actually is successful?
2-50 A mortgage lender attempted to increase its business
by marketing its subprime mortgage. This mortgage
is designed for people with a less-than-perfect credit
rating, and the interest rate is higher to offset the ex-
tra risk. In the past year, 20% of these mortgages re-
sulted in foreclosure as customers defaulted on their
loans. A new screening system has been developed
to determine whether to approve customers for the
subprime loans. When the system is applied to a
credit application, the system will classify the appli-
cation as “Approve for loan” or “Reject for loan.”
When this new system was applied to recent cus-
tomers who had defaulted on their loans, 90% of
these customers were classified as “Reject.” When
this same system was applied to recent loan cus-
tomers who had not defaulted on their loan pay-
ments, 70% of these customers were classified as
“Approve for loan.”
(a) If a customer did not default on a loan, what is
the probability that the rating system would have
classified the applicant in the reject category?
(b) If the rating system had classified the applicant
in the reject category, what is the probability that
the customer would not default on a loan?

WTVX
WTVX, Channel 6, is located in Eugene, Oregon, home of the
University of Oregon’s football team. The station was owned
and operated by George Wilcox, a former Duck (University of
Oregon football player). Although there were other television
stations in Eugene, WTVX was the only station that had a
weatherperson who was a member of the American Meteoro-
logical Society (AMS). Every night, Joe Hummel would be
introduced as the only weatherperson in Eugene who was a
member of the AMS. This was George’s idea, and he believed
that this gave his station the mark of quality and helped with
market share.
In addition to being a member of AMS, Joe was also the
most popular person on any of the local news programs. Joe was
always trying to find innovative ways to make the weather in-
teresting, and this was especially difficult during the winter
months when the weather seemed to remain the same over long
periods of time. Joe’s forecast for next month, for example, was
that there would be a 70% chance of rain every day, and that
what happens on one day (rain or shine) was not in any way de-
pendent on what happened the day before.
One of Joe’s most popular features of the weather report
was to invite questions during the actual broadcast. Questions
would be phoned in, and they were answered on the spot by Joe.
Once a 10-year-old boy asked what caused fog, and Joe did an
excellent job of describing some of the various causes.
Occasionally, Joe would make a mistake. For example, a
high school senior asked Joe what the chances were of getting 15
days of rain in the next month (30 days). Joe made a quick calcula-
tion: 
Joe
quickly found out what it was like being wrong in a university
town. He had over 50 phone calls from scientists, mathemati-
cians, and other university professors, telling him that he had
made a big mistake in computing the chances of getting 15 days
of rain during the next 30 days. Although Joe didn’t understand
all of the formulas the professors mentioned, he was determined
to find the correct answer and make a correction during a future
broadcast.

1. What are the chances of getting 15 days of rain during the
next 30 days?

CHAPTER 3 • DECISION ANALYSIS
3.1
Introduction
To a great extent, the successes or failures that a person experiences in life depend on the deci-
sions that he or she makes. The person who managed the ill-fated space shuttle Challenger is no
longer working for NASA. The person who designed the top-selling Mustang became president
of Ford. Why and how did these people make their respective decisions? In general, what is in-
volved in making good decisions? One decision may make the difference between a successful
career and an unsuccessful one. Decision theory is an analytic and systematic approach to the
study of decision making. In this chapter, we present the mathematical models useful in helping
managers make the best possible decisions.
What makes the difference between good and bad decisions? A good decision is one that is
based on logic, considers all available data and possible alternatives, and applies the quantitative
approach we are about to describe. Occasionally, a good decision results in an unexpected or un-
favorable outcome. But if it is made properly, it is still a good decision. A bad decision is one
that is not based on logic, does not use all available information, does not consider all alterna-
tives, and does not employ appropriate quantitative techniques. If you make a bad decision but
are lucky and a favorable outcome occurs, you have still made a bad decision. Although occa-
sionally good decisions yield bad results, in the long run, using decision theory will result in
successful outcomes.
Decision theory is an analytic
and systematic way to tackle
problems.
A good decision is based on logic.
3.2
The Six Steps in Decision Making
Whether you are deciding about getting a haircut today, building a multimillion-dollar plant, or
buying a new camera, the steps in making a good decision are basically the same:
Six Steps in Decision Making
1. Clearly define the problem at hand.
2. List the possible alternatives.
3. Identify the possible outcomes or states of nature.
4. List the payoff (typically profit) of each combination of alternatives and outcomes.
5. Select one of the mathematical decision theory models.
6. Apply the model and make your decision.
We use the Thompson Lumber Company case as an example to illustrate these decision the-
ory steps. John Thompson is the founder and president of Thompson Lumber Company, a prof-
itable firm located in Portland, Oregon.
Step 1. The problem that John Thompson identifies is whether to expand his product line by
manufacturing and marketing a new product, backyard storage sheds.
Thompson’s second step is to generate the alternatives that are available to him. In decision the-
ory, an alternative is defined as a course of action or a strategy that the decision maker can choose.
Step 2. John decides that his alternatives are to construct (1) a large new plant to manufacture
the storage sheds, (2) a small plant, or (3) no plant at all (i.e., he has the option of not developing
the new product line).
One of the biggest mistakes that decision makers make is to leave out some important alter-
natives. Although a particular alternative may seem to be inappropriate or of little value, it might
turn out to be the best choice.
The next step involves identifying the possible outcomes of the various alternatives. A com-
mon mistake is to forget about some of the possible outcomes. Optimistic decision makers tend
to ignore bad outcomes, whereas pessimistic managers may discount a favorable outcome. If
you don’t consider all possibilities, you will not be making a logical decision, and the results
may be undesirable. If you do not think the worst can happen, you may design another Edsel
automobile. In decision theory, those outcomes over which the decision maker has little or no
control are called states of nature.
The first step is to define the
problem.
The second step is to list
alternatives.

3.3
TYPES OF DECISION-MAKING ENVIRONMENTS
71
Step 3. Thompson determines that there are only two possible outcomes: the market for the
storage sheds could be favorable, meaning that there is a high demand for the product, or it could
be unfavorable, meaning that there is a low demand for the sheds.
Once the alternatives and states of nature have been identified, the next step is to express
the payoff resulting from each possible combination of alternatives and outcomes. In decision
theory, we call such payoffs or profits conditional values. Not every decision, of course, can be
based on money alone—any appropriate means of measuring benefit is acceptable.
Step 4. Because Thompson wants to maximize his profits, he can use profit to evaluate each
consequence.
John Thompson has already evaluated the potential profits associated with the various out-
comes. With a favorable market, he thinks a large facility would result in a net profit of $200,000
to his firm. This $200,000 is a conditional value because Thompson’s receiving the money is
conditional upon both his building a large factory and having a good market. The conditional
value if the market is unfavorable would be a $180,000 net loss. A small plant would result in a
net profit of $100,000 in a favorable market, but a net loss of $20,000 would occur if the market
was unfavorable. Finally, doing nothing would result in $0 profit in either market. The easiest
way to present these values is by constructing a decision table, sometimes called a payoff table.
A decision table for Thompson’s conditional values is shown in Table 3.1. All of the alternatives
are listed down the left side of the table, and all of the possible outcomes or states of nature are
listed across the top. The body of the table contains the actual payoffs.
Steps 5 and 6. The last two steps are to select a decision theory model and apply it to the data to
help make the decision. Selecting the model depends on the environment in which you’re
operating and the amount of risk and uncertainty involved.
The third step is to identify
possible outcomes.
The fourth step is to list payoffs.
During the fourth step, the
decision maker can construct
decision or payoff tables.
The last two steps are to select
and apply the decision theory
model.
3.3
Types of Decision-Making Environments
The types of decisions people make depend on how much knowledge or information they have
about the situation. There are three decision-making environments:
 Decision making under certainty
 Decision making under uncertainty
 Decision making under risk
TYPE 1: DECISION MAKING UNDER CERTAINTY In the environment of decision making under
certainty, decision makers know with certainty the consequence of every alternative or decision
choice. Naturally, they will choose the alternative that will maximize their well-being or will
result in the best outcome. For example, let’s say that you have $1,000 to invest for a 1-year
period. One alternative is to open a savings account paying 6% interest and another is to invest
in a government Treasury bond paying 10% interest. If both investments are secure and guaran-
teed, there is a certainty that the Treasury bond will pay a higher return. The return after one
year will be $100 in interest.

CHAPTER 3 • DECISION ANALYSIS
TYPE 2: DECISION MAKING UNDER UNCERTAINTY In decision making under uncertainty, there
are several possible outcomes for each alternative, and the decision maker does not know the
probabilities of the various outcomes. As an example, the probability that a Democrat will be
president of the United States 25 years from now is not known. Sometimes it is impossible to
assess the probability of success of a new undertaking or product. The criteria for decision
making under uncertainty are explained in Section 3.4.
TYPE 3: DECISION MAKING UNDER RISK In decision making under risk, there are several pos-
sible outcomes for each alternative, and the decision maker knows the probability of occurrence
of each outcome. We know, for example, that when playing cards using a standard deck, the
probability of being dealt a club is 0.25. The probability of rolling a 5 on a die is 1/6. In decision
making under risk, the decision maker usually attempts to maximize his or her expected well-
being. Decision theory models for business problems in this environment typically employ two
equivalent criteria: maximization of expected monetary value and minimization of expected
opportunity loss.
Let’s see how decision making under certainty (the type 1 environment) could affect John
Thompson. Here we assume that John knows exactly what will happen in the future. If it turns
out that he knows with certainty that the market for storage sheds will be favorable, what should
he do? Look again at Thompson Lumber’s conditional values in Table 3.1. Because the market
is favorable, he should build the large plant, which has the highest profit, $200,000.
Few managers would be fortunate enough to have complete information and knowledge
about the states of nature under consideration. Decision making under uncertainty, discussed
next, is a more difficult situation. We may find that two different people with different perspec-
tives may appropriately choose two different alternatives.
Probabilities are not known.
Probabilities are known.
3.4
Decision Making Under Uncertainty
When several states of nature exist and a manager cannot assess the outcome probability with
confidence or when virtually no probability data are available, the environment is called deci-
sion making under uncertainty. Several criteria exist for making decisions under these condi-
tions. The ones that we cover in this section are as follows:
1. Optimistic (maximax)
2. Pessimistic (maximin)
3. Criterion of realism (Hurwicz)
4. Equally likely (Laplace)
5. Minimax regret
The first four criteria can be computed directly from the decision (payoff) table, whereas the
minimax regret criterion requires use of the opportunity loss table.
The presentation of the criteria for decision making under uncertainty (and also for decision
making under risk) is based on the assumption that the payoff is something in which larger val-
ues are better and high values are desirable. For payoffs such as profit, total sales, total return on
investment, and interest earned, the best decision would be one that resulted in some type of
maximum payoff. However, there are situations in which lower payoff values (e.g., cost) are bet-
ter, and these payoffs would be minimized rather than maximized. The statement of the decision
criteria would be modified slightly for such minimization problems. Let’s take a look at each of
the five models and apply them to the Thompson Lumber example.
Optimistic
In using the optimistic criterion, the best (maximum) payoff for each alternative is considered
and the alternative with the best (maximum) of these is selected. Hence, the optimistic criterion
is sometimes called the maximax criterion. In Table 3.2 we see that Thompson’s optimistic
choice is the first alternative, “construct a large plant.” By using this criterion, the highest of all
possible payoffs ($200,000 in this example) may be achieved, while if any other alternative were
selected it would be impossible to achieve a payoff this high.
Probability data are not
available.
Maximax is an optimistic
approach.

3.4
DECISION MAKING UNDER UNCERTAINTY
73
In using the optimistic criterion for minimization problems in which lower payoffs (e.g.,
cost) are better, you would look at the best (minimum) payoff for each alternative and choose
the alternative with the best (minimum) of these.
Pessimistic
In using the pessimistic criterion, the worst (minimum) payoff for each alternative is considered
and the alternative with the best (maximum) of these is selected. Hence, the pessimistic criterion
is sometimes called the maximin criterion. This criterion guarantees the payoff will be at least
the maximin value (the best of the worst values). Choosing any other alternative may allow a
worse (lower) payoff to occur.
Thompson’s maximin choice, “do nothing,” is shown in Table 3.3. This decision is associ-
ated with the maximum of the minimum number within each row or alternative.
In using the pessimistic criterion for minimization problems in which lower payoffs (e.g.,
cost) are better, you would look at the worst (maximum) payoff for each alternative and choose
the alternative with the best (minimum) of these.
Both the maximax and maximin criteria consider only one extreme payoff for each alterna-
tive, while all other payoffs are ignored. The next criterion considers both of these extremes.
Criterion of Realism (Hurwicz Criterion)
Often called the weighted average, the criterion of realism (the Hurwicz criterion) is a com-
promise between an optimistic and a pessimistic decision. To begin with, a coefficient of realism,
, is selected; this measures the degree of optimism of the decision maker. This coefficient is
between 0 and 1. When 
is 1, the decision maker is 100% optimistic about the future. When 
is 0, the decision maker is 100% pessimistic about the future. The advantage of this approach is
that it allows the decision maker to build in personal feelings about relative optimism and pes-
simism. The weighted average is computed as follows:
For a maximization problem, the best payoff for an alternative is the highest value, and the worst
payoff is the lowest value. Note that when 
this is the same as the optimistic criterion, and
 = 1,
Weighted average = 1best in row2 + 11 - 21worst in row2



Maximin is a pessimistic
approach.
Criterion of realism uses the
weighted average approach.

CHAPTER 3 • DECISION ANALYSIS
when 
this is the same as the pessimistic criterion. This value is computed for each alter-
native, and the alternative with the highest weighted average is then chosen.
If we assume that John Thompson sets his coefficient of realism, , to be 0.80, the best
decision would be to construct a large plant. As seen in Table 3.4, this alternative has the highest
weighted average: 
(–$180,000).
In using the criterion of realism for minimization problems, the best payoff for an alterna-
tive would be the lowest payoff in the row and the worst would be the highest payoff in the row.
The alternative with the lowest weighted average is then chosen.
Because there are only two states of nature in the Thompson Lumber example, only two
payoffs for each alternative are present and both are considered. However, if there are more than
two states of nature, this criterion will ignore all payoffs except the best and the worst. The next
criterion will consider all possible payoffs for each decision.
Equally Likely (Laplace)
One criterion that uses all the payoffs for each alternative is the equally likely, also called
Laplace, decision criterion. This involves finding the average payoff for each alternative, and
selecting the alternative with the best or highest average. The equally likely approach assumes
that all probabilities of occurrence for the states of nature are equal, and thus each state of
nature is equally likely.
The equally likely choice for Thompson Lumber is the second alternative, “construct a
small plant.” This strategy, shown in Table 3.5, is the one with the maximum average payoff.
In using the equally likely criterion for minimization problems, the calculations are exactly
the same, but the best alternative is the one with the lowest average payoff.
Minimax Regret
The next decision criterion that we discuss is based on opportunity loss or regret. Opportunity
loss refers to the difference between the optimal profit or payoff for a given state of nature and

Ford Uses Decision Theory to Choose
Parts Suppliers
Ford Motor Company manufactures about 5 million cars and
trucks annually and employs more than 200,000 people at about
100 facilities around the globe. Such a large company often
needs to make large supplier decisions under tight deadlines.
This was the situation when researchers at MIT teamed up
with Ford management and developed a data-driven supplier
selection tool. This computer program aids in decision making
by applying some of the decision-making criteria presented in
this chapter. Decision makers at Ford are asked to input data
about their suppliers (part costs, distances, lead times, supplier
reliability, etc.) as well as the type of decision criterion they
want to use. Once these are entered, the model outputs the
best set of suppliers to meet the specified needs. The result is a
system that is now saving Ford Motor Company over $40 mil-
lion annually.

DECISION MAKING UNDER UNCERTAINTY

The first step is to create the opportunity loss table by determining the opportunity loss for
not choosing the best alternative for each state of nature. Opportunity loss for any state of na-
ture, or any column, is calculated by subtracting each payoff in the column from the best payoff
in the same column. For a favorable market, the best payoff is $200,000 as a result of the first
alternative, “construct a large plant.” If the second alternative is selected, a profit of $100,000
would be realized in a favorable market, and this is compared to the best payoff of $200,000.
Thus, the opportunity loss is 
Similarly, if “do nothing” is
selected, the opportunity loss would be 
For an unfavorable market, the best payoff is $0 as a result of the third alternative, “do noth-
ing,” so this has 0 opportunity loss. The opportunity losses for the other alternatives are found
by subtracting the payoffs from this best payoff ($0) in this state of nature as shown in Table 3.6.
Thompson’s opportunity loss table is shown as Table 3.7.
Using the opportunity loss (regret) table, the minimax regret criterion finds the alternative
that minimizes the maximum opportunity loss within each alternative. You first find the maxi-
mum (worst) opportunity loss for each alternative. Next, looking at these maximum values, pick
that alternative with the minimum (or best) number. By doing this, the opportunity loss actually
realized is guaranteed to be no more than this minimax value. In Table 3.8, we can see that the
minimax regret choice is the second alternative, “construct a small plant.” Doing so minimizes
the maximum opportunity loss.
In calculating the opportunity loss for minimization problems such as those involving costs,
the best (lowest) payoff or cost in a column is subtracted from each payoff in that column. Once
the opportunity loss table has been constructed, the minimax regret criterion is applied in ex-
actly the same way as just described. The maximum opportunity loss for each alternative is
found, and the alternative with the minimum of these maximums is selected. As with maximiza-
tion problems, the opportunity loss can never be negative.
We have considered several decision-making criteria to be used when probabilities of the
states of nature are not known and cannot be estimated. Now we will see what to do if the prob-
abilities are available.
200,000 - 0 = 200,000.
200,000 - 100,000 = 100,000.

CHAPTER 3 • DECISION ANALYSIS
3.5
Decision Making Under Risk
Decision making under risk is a decision situation in which several possible states of nature may
occur, and the probabilities of these states of nature are known. In this section we consider one
of the most popular methods of making decisions under risk: selecting the alternative with the
highest expected monetary value (or simply expected value). We also use the probabilities with
the opportunity loss table to minimize the expected opportunity loss.
Expected Monetary Value
Given a decision table with conditional values (payoffs) that are monetary values, and probabil-
ity assessments for all states of nature, it is possible to determine the expected monetary value
(EMV) for each alternative. The expected value, or the mean value, is the long-run average value
of that decision. The EMV for an alternative is just the sum of possible payoffs of the alterna-
tive, each weighted by the probability of that payoff occurring.
This could also be expressed simply as the expected value of X, or E(X), which was dis-
cussed in Section 2.9 of Chapter 2.

If this were expanded, it would become
The alternative with the maximum EMV is then chosen.
Suppose that John Thompson now believes that the probability of a favorable market is
exactly the same as the probability of an unfavorable market; that is, each state of nature has
a 0.50 probability. Which alternative would give the greatest expected monetary value?
To determine this, John has expanded the decision table, as shown in Table 3.9. His calcula-
tions follow:
The largest expected value ($40,000) results from the second alternative, “construct a
small plant.” Thus, Thompson should proceed with the project and put up a small plant to

manufacture storage sheds. The EMVs for the large plant and for doing nothing are $10,000
and $0, respectively.
When using the expected monetary value criterion with minimization problems, the calcu-
lations are the same, but the alternative with the smallest EMV is selected.
Expected Value of Perfect Information
John Thompson has been approached by Scientific Marketing, Inc., a firm that proposes to
help John make the decision about whether to build the plant to produce storage sheds. Sci-
entific Marketing claims that its technical analysis will tell John with certainty whether the
market is favorable for his proposed product. In other words, it will change his environment
from one of decision making under risk to one of decision making under certainty. This in-
formation could prevent John from making a very expensive mistake. Scientific Marketing
would charge Thompson $65,000 for the information. What would you recommend to John?
Should he hire the firm to make the marketing study? Even if the information from the study
is perfectly accurate, is it worth $65,000? What would it be worth? Although some of these
questions are difficult to answer, determining the value of such perfect information can be
very useful. It places an upper bound on what you should be willing to spend on information
such as that being sold by Scientific Marketing. In this section, two related terms are investi-
gated: the expected value of perfect information (EVPI) and the expected value with
perfect information (EVwPI). These techniques can help John make his decision about hir-
ing the marketing firm.
The expected value with perfect information is the expected or average return, in the long
run, if we have perfect information before a decision has to be made. To calculate this value, we
choose the best alternative for each state of nature and multiply its payoff times the probability
of occurrence of that state of nature.
(3-2)
If this were expanded, it would become
The expected value of perfect information, EVPI, is the expected value with perfect information
minus the expected value without perfect information (i.e., the best or maximum EMV). Thus,
the EVPI is the improvement in EMV that results from having perfect information.
(3-3)
By referring to Table 3.9, Thompson can calculate the maximum that he would pay for
information, that is, the expected value of perfect information, or EVPI. He follows a three-stage
process. First, the best payoff in each state of nature is found. If the perfect information says 
the market will be favorable, the large plant will be constructed, and the profit will be $200,000.
If the perfect information says the market will be unfavorable, the “do nothing” alternative is
selected, and the profit will be 0. These values are shown in the “with perfect information” row
in Table 3.10. Second, the expected value with perfect information is computed. Then, using this
result, EVPI is calculated.

CHAPTER 3 • DECISION ANALYSIS
The expected value with perfect information is
Thus, if we had perfect information, the payoff would average $100,000.
The maximum EMV without additional information is $40,000 (from Table 3.9). Therefore,
the increase in EMV is
Thus, the most Thompson would be willing to pay for perfect information is $60,000. This, of
course, is again based on the assumption that the probability of each state of nature is 0.50.
This EVPI also tells us that the most we would pay for any information (perfect or im-
perfect) is $60,000. In a later section we’ll see how to place a value on imperfect or sample
information.
In finding the EVPI for minimization problems, the approach is similar. The best payoff in
each state of nature is found, but this is the lowest payoff for that state of nature rather than the
highest. The EVwPI is calculated from these lowest payoffs, and this is compared to the best
(lowest) EMV without perfect information. The EVPI is the improvement that results, and this
is the best 
Expected Opportunity Loss
An alternative approach to maximizing EMV is to minimize expected opportunity loss (EOL).
First, an opportunity loss table is constructed. Then the EOL is computed for each alternative by
multiplying the opportunity loss by the probability and adding these together. In Table 3.7 we
presented the opportunity loss table for the Thompson Lumber example. Using these opportu-
nity losses, we compute the EOL for each alternative by multiplying the probability of each state
of nature times the appropriate opportunity loss value and adding these together:
Table 3.11 gives these results. Using minimum EOL as the decision criterion, the best decision
would be the second alternative, “construct a small plant.”
It is important to note that minimum EOL will always result in the same decision as maxi-
mum EMV, and that the EVPI will always equal the minimum EOL. Referring to the Thompson
case, we used the payoff table to compute the EVPI to be $60,000. Note that this is the mini-
mum EOL we just computed.

Sensitivity Analysis
In previous sections we determined that the best decision (with the probabilities known) for
Thompson Lumber was to construct the small plant, with an expected value of $40,000. This
conclusion depends on the values of the economic consequences and the two probability values
of a favorable and an unfavorable market. Sensitivity analysis investigates how our decision
might change given a change in the problem data. In this section, we investigate the impact that
a change in the probability values would have on the decision facing Thompson Lumber. We first
define the following variable:
Because there are only two states of nature, the probability of an unfavorable market must
be
We can now express the EMVs in terms of P, as shown in the following equations. A graph
of these EMV values is shown in Figure 3.1.
As you can see in Figure 3.1, the best decision is to do nothing as long as P is between 0
and the probability associated with point 1, where the EMV for doing nothing is equal to the
EMV for the small plant. When P is between the probabilities for points 1 and 2, the best deci-
sion is to build the small plant. Point 2 is where the EMV for the small plant is equal to the EMV

Decision Trees
Any problem that can be presented in a decision table can also be graphically illustrated in a
decision tree. All decision trees are similar in that they contain decision points or decision
nodes and state-of-nature points or state-of-nature nodes:
 A decision node from which one of several alternatives may be chosen
 A state-of-nature node out of which one state of nature will occur
In drawing the tree, we begin at the left and move to the right. Thus, the tree presents the deci-
sions and outcomes in sequential order. Lines or branches from the squares (decision nodes)
represent alternatives, and branches from the circles represent the states of nature. Figure 3.2
gives the basic decision tree for the Thompson Lumber example. First, John decides whether to
construct a large plant, a small plant, or no plant. Then, once that decision is made, the possible
states of nature or outcomes (favorable or unfavorable market) will occur. The next step is to put
the payoffs and probabilities on the tree and begin the analysis.
Analyzing problems with decision trees involves five steps:
Five Steps of Decision Tree Analysis 
1. Define the problem.
2. Structure or draw the decision tree.
3. Assign probabilities to the states of nature.
4. Estimate payoffs for each possible combination of alternatives and states of nature.
5. Solve the problem by computing expected monetary values (EMVs) for each state of
nature node. This is done by working backward, that is, starting at the right of the tree and
working back to decision nodes on the left. Also, at each decision node, the alternative
with the best EMV is selected.
The final decision tree with the payoffs and probabilities for John Thompson’s decision
situation is shown in Figure 3.3. Note that the payoffs are placed at the right side of each of the
tree’s branches. The probabilities are shown in parentheses next to each state of nature. Begin-
ning with the payoffs on the right of the figure, the EMVs for each state-of-nature node are then
calculated and placed by their respective nodes. The EMV of the first node is $10,000. This
represents the branch from the decision node to construct a large plant. The EMV for node 2,

to construct a small plant, is $40,000. Building no plant or doing nothing has, of course, a pay-
off of $0. The branch leaving the decision node leading to the state-of-nature node with the
highest EMV should be chosen. In Thompson’s case, a small plant should be built.
A MORE COMPLEX DECISION FOR THOMPSON LUMBER—SAMPLE INFORMATION When
sequential decisions need to be made, decision trees are much more powerful tools than deci-
sion tables. Let’s say that John Thompson has two decisions to make, with the second decision
dependent on the outcome of the first. Before deciding about building a new plant, John has the
option of conducting his own marketing research survey, at a cost of $10,000. The information
from his survey could help him decide whether to construct a large plant, a small plant, or not to
build at all. John recognizes that such a market survey will not provide him with perfect infor-
mation, but it may help quite a bit nevertheless.
John’s new decision tree is represented in Figure 3.4. Let’s take a careful look at this more
complex tree. Note that all possible outcomes and alternatives are included in their logical
sequence. This is one of the strengths of using decision trees in making decisions. The user is
forced to examine all possible outcomes, including unfavorable ones. He or she is also forced to
make decisions in a logical, sequential manner.
Examining the tree, we see that Thompson’s first decision point is whether to conduct the
$10,000 market survey. If he chooses not to do the study (the lower part of the tree), he can
either construct a large plant, a small plant, or no plant. This is John’s second decision point.
The market will either be favorable (0.50 probability) or unfavorable (also 0.50 probability) if
he builds. The payoffs for each of the possible consequences are listed along the right side. As a
matter of fact, the lower portion of John’s tree is identical to the simpler decision tree shown in
Figure 3.3. Why is this so?

The upper part of Figure 3.4 reflects the decision to conduct the market survey. State-of-
nature node 1 has two branches. There is a 45% chance that the survey results will indicate a
favorable market for storage sheds. We also note that the probability is 0.55 that the survey
results will be negative. The derivation of this probability will be discussed in the next section.
The rest of the probabilities shown in parentheses in Figure 3.4 are all conditional proba-
bilities or posterior probabilities (these probabilities will also be discussed in the next section).
For example, 0.78 is the probability of a favorable market for the sheds given a favorable result
from the market survey. Of course, you would expect to find a high probability of a favorable
market given that the research indicated that the market was good. Don’t forget, though, there is
a chance that John’s $10,000 market survey didn’t result in perfect or even reliable information.
Any market research study is subject to error. In this case, there is a 22% chance that the market
for sheds will be unfavorable given that the survey results are positive.
We note that there is a 27% chance that the market for sheds will be favorable given that
John’s survey results are negative. The probability is much higher, 0.73, that the market will
actually be unfavorable given that the survey was negative.
Finally, when we look to the payoff column in Figure 3.4, we see that $10,000, the cost of
the marketing study, had to be subtracted from each of the top 10 tree branches. Thus, a large
plant with a favorable market would normally net a $200,000 profit. But because the market

The cost of the survey had to be
subtracted from the original
payoffs.

study was conducted, this figure is reduced by $10,000 to $190,000. In the unfavorable case, the
loss of $180,000 would increase to a greater loss of $190,000. Similarly, conducting the survey
and building no plant now results in a –$10,000 payoff.
With all probabilities and payoffs specified, we can start calculating the EMV at each state-
of-nature node. We begin at the end, or right side of the decision tree and work back toward the
origin. When we finish, the best decision will be known.
1. Given favorable survey results,
The EMV of no plant in this case is -$10,000. Thus, if the survey results are favorable, a
large plant should be built. Note that we bring the expected value of this decision
($106,400) to the decision node to indicate that, if the survey results are positive, our
expected value will be $106,400. This is shown in Figure 3.5.
2. Given negative survey results,
The EMV of no plant is again –$10,000 for this branch. Thus, given a negative survey
result, John should build a small plant with an expected value of $2,400, and this figure is
indicated at the decision node.
3. Continuing on the upper part of the tree and moving backward, we compute the expected
value of conducting the market survey:
4. If the market survey is not conducted,
The EMV of no plant is $0.
Thus, building a small plant is the best choice, given that the marketing research is not
performed, as we saw earlier.
5. We move back to the first decision node and choose the best alternative. The expected
monetary value of conducting the survey is $49,200, versus an EMV of $40,000 for not
conducting the study, so the best choice is to seek marketing information. If the survey re-
sults are favorable, John should construct a large plant; but if the research is negative, John
should construct a small plant.
In Figure 3.5, these expected values are placed on the decision tree. Notice on the tree that a
pair of slash lines / / through a decision branch indicates that a particular alternative is dropped
from further consideration. This is because its EMV is lower than the EMV for the best alterna-
tive. After you have solved several decision tree problems, you may find it easier to do all of
your computations on the tree diagram.

Thompson’s Decision Tree with EMVs Shown
EVSI measures the value of
sample information.
EXPECTED VALUE OF SAMPLE INFORMATION With the market survey he intends to conduct, John
Thompson knows that his best decision will be to build a large plant if the survey is favorable or a
small plant if the survey results are negative. But John also realizes that conducting the market re-
search is not free. He would like to know what the actual value of doing a survey is. One way of
measuring the value of market information is to compute the expected value of sample information
(EVSI) which is the increase in expected value resulting from the sample information.
The expected value with sample information (EV with SI) is found from the decision tree,
and the cost of the sample information is added to this since this was subtracted from all the pay-
offs before the EV with SI was calculated. The expected value without sample information (EV
without SI) is then subtracted from this to find the value of the sample information.
(3-4)
where
EVSI = expected value of sample information
EV with SI = expected value with sample information
EV without SI = expected value without sample information
In John’s case, his EMV would be $59,200 if he hadn’t already subtracted the $10,000 study
cost from each payoff. (Do you see why this is so? If not, add $10,000 back into each payoff, 
EVSI = 1EV with SI + cost2 - 1EV without SI2

CHAPTER 3 • DECISION ANALYSIS
as in the original Thompson problem, and recompute the EMV of conducting the market study.)
From the lower branch of Figure 3.5, we see that the EMV of not gathering the sample informa-
tion is $40,000. Thus,
This means that John could have paid up to $19,200 for a market study and still come out ahead.
Since it costs only $10,000, the survey is indeed worthwhile.
Efficiency of Sample Information
There may be many types of sample information available to a decision maker. In developing a
new product, information could be obtained from a survey, from a focus group, from other mar-
ket research techniques, or from actually using a test market to see how sales will be. While
none of these sources of information are perfect, they can be evaluated by comparing the EVSI
with the EVPI. If the sample information was perfect, then the efficiency would be 100%. The
efficiency of sample information is
(3-5)
In the Thompson Lumber example,
Thus, the market survey is only 32% as efficient as perfect information.
Sensitivity Analysis
As with payoff tables, sensitivity analysis can be applied to decision trees as well. The overall
approach is the same. Consider the decision tree for the expanded Thompson Lumber problem
shown in Figure 3.5. How sensitive is our decision (to conduct the marketing survey) to the
probability of favorable survey results?
Let p be the probability of favorable survey results. Then 
is the probability of
negative survey results. Given this information, we can develop an expression for the EMV of
conducting the survey, which is node 1:
We are indifferent when the EMV of conducting the marketing survey, node 1, is the same
as the EMV of not conducting the survey, which is $40,000. We can find the indifference point
by equating EMV(node 1) to $40,000:
As long as the probability of favorable survey results, p, is greater than 0.36, our decision will
stay the same. When p is less than 0.36, our decision will be not to conduct the survey.
We could also perform sensitivity analysis for other problem parameters. For example, we
could find how sensitive our decision is to the probability of a favorable market given favorable
survey results. At this time, this probability is 0.78. If this value goes up, the large plant becomes
more attractive. In this case, our decision would not change. What happens when this probabil-
ity goes down? The analysis becomes more complex. As the probability of a favorable market
given favorable survey results goes down, the small plant becomes more attractive. At some
point, the small plant will result in a higher EMV (given favorable survey results) than the large
plant. This, however, does not conclude our analysis. As the probability of a favorable market
given favorable survey results continues to fall, there will be a point where not conducting the
survey, with an EMV of $40,000, will be more attractive than conducting the marketing survey.
We leave the actual calculations to you. It is important to note that sensitivity analysis should
consider all possible consequences.

How Probability Values are Estimated by Bayesian Analysis
There are many ways of getting probability data for a problem such as Thompson’s. The num-
bers (such as 0.78, 0.22, 0.27, 0.73 in Figure 3.4) can be assessed by a manager based on experi-
ence and intuition. They can be derived from historical data, or they can be computed from other
available data using Bayes’ theorem. The advantage of Bayes’ theorem is that it incorporates
both our initial estimates of the probabilities as well as information about the accuracy of the in-
formation source (e.g., market research survey).
The Bayes’ theorem approach recognizes that a decision maker does not know with certainty
what state of nature will occur. It allows the manager to revise his or her initial or prior probability
assessments based on new information. The revised probabilities are called posterior probabilities.
(Before continuing, you may wish to review Bayes’ theorem in Chapter 2.)
Calculating Revised Probabilities
In the Thompson Lumber case solved in Section 3.6, we made the assumption that the following
four conditional probabilities were known:
We now show how John Thompson was able to derive these values with Bayes’ theorem. From dis-
cussions with market research specialists at the local university, John knows that special surveys
such as his can either be positive (i.e., predict a favorable market) or be negative (i.e., predict an un-
favorable market). The experts have told John that, statistically, of all new products with a favorable
market (FM), market surveys were positive and predicted success correctly 70% of the time. Thirty
percent of the time the surveys falsely predicted negative results or an unfavorable market (UM).
On the other hand, when there was actually an unfavorable market for a new product, 80% of the
surveys correctly predicted negative results. The surveys incorrectly predicted positive results the
remaining 20% of the time. These conditional probabilities are summarized in Table 3.12. They are
an indication of the accuracy of the survey that John is thinking of undertaking.
Recall that without any market survey information, John’s best estimates of a favorable and
unfavorable market are
These are referred to as the prior probabilities.
We are now ready to compute Thompson’s revised or posterior probabilities. These desired
probabilities are the reverse of the probabilities in Table 3.12. We need the probability of a
favorable or unfavorable market given a positive or negative result from the market study. The
general form of Bayes’ theorem presented in Chapter 2 is

put for this example.

nature if the survey results are positive or negative. As you know, John’s prior probability of suc-
cess without a market survey was only 0.50. Now he is aware that the probability of successfully

in the earlier decision tree analysis.
Potential Problem in Using Survey Results
In many decision-making problems, survey results or pilot studies are done before an actual
decision (such as building a new plant or taking a particular course of action) is made. As dis-
cussed earlier in this section, Bayes’ analysis is used to help determine the correct conditional
probabilities that are needed to solve these types of decision theory problems. In computing
these conditional probabilities, we need to have data about the surveys and their accuracies. If a
decision to build a plant or to take another course of action is actually made, we can determine

90
CHAPTER 3 • DECISION ANALYSIS
the accuracy of our surveys. Unfortunately, we cannot always get data about those situations in
which the decision was not to build a plant or not to take some course of action. Thus, some-
times when we use survey results, we are basing our probabilities only on those cases in which a
decision to build a plant or take some course of action is actually made. This means that, in some
situations, conditional probability information may not be not quite as accurate as we would
like. Even so, calculating conditional probabilities helps to refine the decision-making process
and, in general, to make better decisions.
3.8
Utility Theory
We have focused on the EMV criterion for making decisions under risk. However, there are
many occasions in which people make decisions that would appear to be inconsistent with the
EMV criterion. When people buy insurance, the amount of the premium is greater than the ex-
pected payout to them from the insurance company because the premium includes the expected
payout, the overhead cost, and the profit for the insurance company. A person involved in a law-
suit may choose to settle out of court rather than go to trial even if the expected value of going
to trial is greater than the proposed settlement. A person buys a lottery ticket even though the
expected return is negative. Casino games of all types have negative expected returns for the
player, and yet millions of people play these games. A businessperson may rule out one poten-
tial decision because it could bankrupt the firm if things go bad, even though the expected return
for this decision is better than that of all other alternatives.
Why do people make decisions that don’t maximize their EMV? They do this because
the monetary value is not always a true indicator of the overall value of the result of the deci-
sion. The overall worth of a particular outcome is called utility, and rational people make
decisions that maximize the expected utility. Although at times the monetary value is a good
indicator of utility, there are other times when it is not. This is particularly true when some
of the values involve an extremely large payoff or an extremely large loss. For example, sup-
pose that you are the lucky holder of a lottery ticket. Five minutes from now a fair coin could
be flipped, and if it comes up tails, you would win $5 million. If it comes up heads, you
would win nothing. Just a moment ago a wealthy person offered you $2 million for your
ticket. Let’s assume that you have no doubts about the validity of the offer. The person will
give you a certified check for the full amount, and you are absolutely sure the check would
be good.
A decision tree for this situation is shown in Figure 3.6. The EMV for rejecting the offer
indicates that you should hold on to your ticket, but what would you do? Just think, $2 million
for sure instead of a 50% chance at nothing. Suppose you were greedy enough to hold on to the
ticket, and then lost. How would you explain that to your friends? Wouldn’t $2 million be
enough to be comfortable for a while?
The overall value of the result
of a decision is called utility.

UTILITY THEORY
91
Most people would choose to sell the ticket for $2 million. Most of us, in fact, would proba-
bly be willing to settle for a lot less. Just how low we would go is, of course, a matter of per-
sonal preference. People have different feelings about seeking or avoiding risk. Using the EMV
alone is not always a good way to make these types of decisions.
One way to incorporate your own attitudes toward risk is through utility theory. In the
next section we explore first how to measure utility and then how to use utility measures in
decision making.
Measuring Utility and Constructing a Utility Curve
The first step in using utility theory is to assign utility values to each monetary value in a given
situation. It is convenient to begin utility assessment by assigning the worst outcome a utility of
0 and the best outcome a utility of 1. Although any values may be used as long as the utility for
the best outcome is greater than the utility for the worst outcome, using 0 and 1 has some bene-
fits. Because we have chosen to use 0 and 1, all other outcomes will have a utility value between
0 and 1. In determining the utilities of all outcomes, other than the best or worst outcome, a
standard gamble is considered. This gamble is shown in Figure 3.7.
In Figure 3.7, p is the probability of obtaining the best outcome, and 
is the proba-
bility of obtaining the worst outcome. Assessing the utility of any other outcome involves deter-
mining the probability ( p), which makes you indifferent between alternative 1, which is the
gamble between the best and worst outcomes, and alternative 2, which is obtaining the other out-
come for sure. When you are indifferent between alternatives 1 and 2, the expected utilities for
these two alternatives must be equal. This relationship is shown as
(3-7)
Now all you have to do is to determine the value of the probability (p) that makes you indif-
ferent between alternatives 1 and 2. In setting the probability, you should be aware that utility
assessment is completely subjective. It’s a value set by the decision maker that can’t be meas-
ured on an objective scale. Let’s take a look at an example.
Jane Dickson would like to construct a utility curve revealing her preference for money
between $0 and $10,000. A utility curve is a graph that plots utility value versus monetary
value. She can either invest her money in a bank savings account or she can invest the same
money in a real estate deal.
If the money is invested in the bank, in three years Jane would have $5,000. If she in-
vested in the real estate, after three years she could either have nothing or $10,000. Jane, how-
ever, is very conservative. Unless there is an 80% chance of getting $10,000 from the real
estate deal, Jane would prefer to have her money in the bank, where it is safe. What Jane has
done here is to assess her utility for $5,000. When there is an 80% chance (this means that
p is 0.8) of getting $10,000, Jane is indifferent between putting her money in real estate or
putting it in the bank. Jane’s utility for $5,000 is thus equal to 0.8, which is the same as the
value for p. This utility assessment is shown in Figure 3.8.
Utility of other outcome = 1p2112 + 11 - p2102 = p
+ 11 - p21utility of the worst outcome, which is 02
Utility of other outcome = 1p21utility of best outcome, which is 12
Expected utility of alternative 2 = Expected utility of alternative 1
11 - p2
EMV is not always the best
approach.
Utility assessment assigns the
worst outcome a utility of 0 and
the best outcome a utility of 1.

When you are indifferent, the
expected utilities are equal.
Once utility values have been
determined, a utility curve can be
constructed.

92
CHAPTER 3 • DECISION ANALYSIS
Other utility values can be assessed in the same way. For example, what is Jane’s utility for
$7,000? What value of p would make Jane indifferent between $7,000 and the gamble that
would result in either $10,000 or $0? For Jane, there must be a 90% chance of getting the
$10,000. Otherwise, she would prefer the $7,000 for sure. Thus, her utility for $7,000 is 0.90.
Jane’s utility for $3,000 can be determined in the same way. If there were a 50% chance of
obtaining the $10,000, Jane would be indifferent between having $3,000 for sure and taking the
gamble of either winning the $10,000 or getting nothing. Thus, the utility of $3,000 for Jane is
0.5. Of course, this process can be continued until Jane has assessed her utility for as many mon-
etary values as she wants. These assessments, however, are enough to get an idea of Jane’s feel-
ings toward risk. In fact, we can plot these points in a utility curve, as is done in Figure 3.9. In
the figure, the assessed utility points of $3,000, $5,000, and $7,000 are shown by dots, and the
rest of the curve is inferred from these.
Jane’s utility curve is typical of a risk avoider. A risk avoider is a decision maker who
gets less utility or pleasure from a greater risk and tends to avoid situations in which high
losses might occur. As monetary value increases on her utility curve, the utility increases at a
slower rate.

Figure 3.10 illustrates that a person who is a risk seeker has an opposite-shaped utility
curve. This decision maker gets more utility from a greater risk and higher potential payoff. As
monetary value increases on his or her utility curve, the utility increases at an increasing rate. A
person who is indifferent to risk has a utility curve that is a straight line. The shape of a person’s
utility curve depends on the specific decision being considered, the monetary values involved in
the situation, the person’s psychological frame of mind, and how the person feels about the fu-
ture. It may well be that you have one utility curve for some situations you face and completely
different curves for others.
Utility as a Decision-Making Criterion
After a utility curve has been determined, the utility values from the curve are used in making
decisions. Monetary outcomes or values are replaced with the appropriate utility values and then
decision analysis is performed as usual. The expected utility for each alternative is computed in-
stead of the EMV. Let’s take a look at an example in which a decision tree is used and expected
utility values are computed in selecting the best alternative.
Mark Simkin loves to gamble. He decides to play a game that involves tossing thumbtacks
in the air. If the point on the thumbtack is facing up after it lands, Mark wins $10,000. If the
point on the thumbtack is down, Mark loses $10,000. Should Mark play the game (alternative 1)
or should he not play the game (alternative 2)?
Alternatives 1 and 2 are displayed in the tree shown in Figure 3.11. As can be seen, alternative
1 is to play the game. Mark believes that there is a 45% chance of winning $10,000 and a 55%
The shape of a person’s utility
curve depends on many factors.
Utility values replace monetary
values.

chance of suffering the $10,000 loss. Alternative 2 is not to gamble. What should Mark do? Of
course, this depends on Mark’s utility for money. As stated previously, he likes to gamble. Using
the procedure just outlined, Mark was able to construct a utility curve showing his preference for
money. Mark has a total of $20,000 to gamble, so he has constructed the utility curve based on a
best payoff of $20,000 and a worst payoff of a $20,000 loss. This curve appears in Figure 3.12.
We see that Mark’s utility for –$10,000 is 0.05, his utility for not playing ($0) is 0.15, and
his utility for $10,000 is 0.30. These values can now be used in the decision tree. Mark’s objec-
tive is to maximize his expected utility, which can be done as follows:
Step 1.
 U1$10,0002 = 0.30
 U1$02 = 0.15
 U1-$10,0002 = 0.05
Mark’s objective is to maximize
expected utility.
Multiattribute Utility Model Aids 
in Disposal of Nuclear Weapons
When the Cold War between the United States and the USSR
ended, the two countries agreed to dismantle a large number of
nuclear weapons. The exact number of weapons is not known,
but the total number has been estimated to be over 40,000. The
plutonium recovered from the dismantled weapons presented
several concerns. The National Academy of Sciences characterized
the possibility that the plutonium could fall into the hands of ter-
rorists as a very real danger. Also, plutonium is very toxic to the
environment, so a safe and secure disposal process was critical.
Deciding what disposal process would be used was no easy task.
Due to the long relationship between the United States and
the USSR during the Cold War, it was necessary that the plutonium
disposal process for each country occur at approximately the same
time. Whichever method was selected by one country would have
to be approved by the other country. The U.S. Department of
Energy (DOE) formed the Office of Fissile Materials Disposition
(OFMD) to oversee the process of selecting the approach to use for
disposal of the plutonium. Recognizing that the decision could be
controversial, the OFMD used a team of operations research ana-
lysts associated with the Amarillo National Research Center. This OR
group used a multiattribute utility (MAU) model to combine several
performance measures into one single measure.
A total of 37 performance measures were used in evaluating
13 different possible alternatives. The MAU model combined
these measures and helped to rank the alternatives as well as
identify the deficiencies of some alternatives. The OFMD recom-
mended 2 of the alternatives with the highest rankings, and
development was begun on both of them. This parallel develop-
ment permitted the United States to react quickly when the
USSR’s plan was developed. The USSR used an analysis based on
this same MAU approach. The United States and the USSR chose
to convert the plutonium from nuclear weapons into mixed oxide
fuel, which is used in nuclear reactors to make electricity. Once
the plutonium is converted to this form, it cannot be used in
nuclear weapons.
The MAU model helped the United States and the USSR deal
with a very sensitive and potentially hazardous issue in a way that
considered economic, nonproliferation, and ecology issues. The
framework is now being used by Russia to evaluate other policies
related to nuclear energy.

Summary
Decision theory is an analytic and systematic approach to
studying decision making. Six steps are usually involved in
making decisions in three environments: decision making un-
der certainty, uncertainty, and risk. In decision making under
uncertainty, decision tables are constructed to compute such
criteria as maximax, maximin, criterion of realism, equally
likely, and minimax regret. Such methods as determining
expected monetary value (EMV), expected value of perfect
information (EVPI), expected opportunity loss (EOL), and sen-
sitivity analysis are used in decision making under risk.
Decision trees are another option, particularly for larger
decision problems, when one decision must be made before
other decisions can be made. For example, a decision to take
a sample or to perform market research is made before we
decide to construct a large plant, a small one, or no plant. In
this case we can also compute the expected value of sample
information (EVSI) to determine the value of the market
research. The efficiency of sample information compares the
EVSI to the EVPI. Bayesian analysis can be used to revise or
update probability values using both the prior probabilities
and other probabilities related to the accuracy of the infor-
mation source.
Glossary
Alternative
A course of action or a strategy that may be
chosen by a decision maker.
Coefficient of Realism ()
A number from 0 to 1. When the
coefficient is close to 1, the decision criterion is optimistic.
When the coefficient is close to zero, the decision criterion
is pessimistic.
Conditional Probability
A posterior probability.
Conditional Value or Payoff
A consequence, normally
expressed in a monetary value, that occurs as a result of a
particular alternative and state of nature.
Criterion of Realism
A decision-making criterion that uses
a weighted average of the best and worst possible payoffs
for each alternative.
Decision Making under Certainty
A decision-making envi-
ronment in which the future outcomes or states of nature
are known.
Decision Making under Risk
A decision-making environ-
ment in which several outcomes or states of nature may
occur as a result of a decision or alternative. The probabili-
ties of the outcomes or states of nature are known.
Therefore, alternative 1 is the best strategy using utility as the decision criterion. If EMV had
been used, alternative 2 would have been the best strategy. The utility curve is a risk-seeker util-
ity curve, and the choice of playing the game certainly reflects this preference for risk.

CHAPTER 3 • DECISION ANALYSIS
Decision Making under Uncertainty
A decision-making
environment in which several outcomes or states of nature
may occur. The probabilities of these outcomes, however,
are not known.

Equally Likely.
A decision criterion that places an equal
weight on all states of nature.
Expected Monetary Value (EMV)
The average value

determined by multiplying the monetary values by their
respective probabilities. The results are then added to
arrive at the EMV.
Expected Value of Perfect Information (EVPI)
The aver-

The criterion of realism.
Laplace Criterion
The equally likely criterion.
Maximax
An optimistic decision-making criterion. This
selects the alternative with the highest possible return.
Maximin
A pessimistic decision-making criterion. This
alternative maximizes the minimum payoff. It selects the
alternative with the best of the worst possible payoffs.
Minimax Regret
A criterion that minimizes the maximum
opportunity loss.

between utility and monetary values. When this curve has
been constructed, utility values from the curve can be used
in the decision-making process.

Maria Rojas is considering the possibility of opening a small dress shop on Fairbanks Avenue, a few
blocks from the university. She has located a good mall that attracts students. Her options are to open a
small shop, a medium-sized shop, or no shop at all. The market for a dress shop can be good, average, or
bad. The probabilities for these three possibilities are 0.2 for a good market, 0.5 for an average market,
and 0.3 for a bad market. The net profit or loss for the medium-sized and small shops for the various mar-
ket conditions are given in the following table. Building no shop at all yields no loss and no gain.

The best payoff in a good market is 100,000, so the opportunity losses in the first column indicate how
much worse each payoff is than 100,000. The best payoff in an average market is 35,000, so the
opportunity losses in the second column indicate how much worse each payoff is than 35,000. The
best payoff in a bad market is 0, so the opportunity losses in the third column indicate how much
worse each payoff is than 0.
The minimax regret criterion considers the maximum regret for each decision, and the decision
corresponding to the minimum of these is selected. The decision would be to build a small shop since
the maximum regret for this is 40,000, while the maximum regret for each of the other two alterna-
tives is higher as shown in the opportunity loss table.
The decision based on the EOL criterion would be to build the medium shop. Note that the mini-

Cal Bender and Becky Addison have known each other since high school. Two years ago they entered
the same university and today they are taking undergraduate courses in the business school. Both hope
to graduate with degrees in finance. In an attempt to make extra money and to use some of the knowl-
edge gained from their business courses, Cal and Becky have decided to look into the possibility of
starting a small company that would provide word processing services to students who needed term
papers or other reports prepared in a professional manner. Using a systems approach, Cal and Becky
have identified three strategies. Strategy 1 is to invest in a fairly expensive microcomputer system with
a high-quality laser printer. In a favorable market, they should be able to obtain a net profit of $10,000
over the next two years. If the market is unfavorable, they can lose $8,000. Strategy 2 is to purchase a
less expensive system. With a favorable market, they could get a return during the next two years of
$8,000. With an unfavorable market, they would incur a loss of $4,000. Their final strategy, strategy 3,
is to do nothing. Cal is basically a risk taker, whereas Becky tries to avoid risk.
a. What type of decision procedure should Cal use? What would Cal’s decision be?
b. What type of decision maker is Becky? What decision would Becky make?
c. If Cal and Becky were indifferent to risk, what type of decision approach should they use? What
would you recommend if this were the case?

a. Since Cal is a risk taker, he should use the maximax decision criteria. This approach selects the
row that has the highest or maximum value. The $10,000 value, which is the maximum value from
the table, is in row 1. Thus, Cal’s decision is to select strategy 1, which is an optimistic decision
approach.
b. Becky should use the maximin decision criteria because she wants to avoid risk. The minimum or
worst outcome for each row, or strategy, is identified. These outcomes are –$8,000 for strategy 1,
–$4,000 for strategy 2, and $0 for strategy 3. The maximum of these values is selected. Thus,
Becky would select strategy 3, which reflects a pessimistic decision approach.
c. If Cal and Becky are indifferent to risk, they could use the equally likely approach. This approach
selects the alternative that maximizes the row averages. The row average for strategy 1 is
The row average for strategy 2 is $2,000, and the

Monica Britt has enjoyed sailing small boats since she was 7 years old, when her mother started sail-
ing with her. Today, Monica is considering the possibility of starting a company to produce small sail-
boats for the recreational market. Unlike other mass-produced sailboats, however, these boats will be
made specifically for children between the ages of 10 and 15. The boats will be of the highest quality
and extremely stable, and the sail size will be reduced to prevent problems of capsizing.
Her basic decision is whether to build a large manufacturing facility, a small manufacturing facil-
ity, or no facility at all. With a favorable market, Monica can expect to make $90,000 from the large
facility or $60,000 from the smaller facility. If the market is unfavorable, however, Monica estimates
that she would lose $30,000 with a large facility, and she would lose only $20,000 with the small
facility. Because of the expense involved in developing the initial molds and acquiring the necessary
equipment to produce fiberglass sailboats for young children, Monica has decided to conduct a pilot
study to make sure that the market for the sailboats will be adequate. She estimates that the pilot study
will cost her $10,000. Furthermore, the pilot study can be either favorable or unfavorable. Monica
estimates that the probability of a favorable market given a favorable pilot study is 0.8. The probabil-
ity of an unfavorable market given an unfavorable pilot study result is estimated to be 0.9. Monica
feels that there is a 0.65 chance that the pilot study will be favorable. Of course, Monica could bypass
the pilot study and simply make the decision as to whether to build a large plant, small plant, or no
facility at all. Without doing any testing in a pilot study, she estimates that the probability of a favor-
able market is 0.6. What do you recommend? Compute the EVSI.

Before Monica starts to solve this problem, she should develop a decision tree that shows all alterna-
tives, states of nature, probability values, and economic consequences. This decision tree is shown in

Developing a small driving range for golfers of all abilities has long been a desire of John Jenkins.
John, however, believes that the chance of a successful driving range is only about 40%. A friend of
John’s has suggested that he conduct a survey in the community to get a better feeling of the demand
for such a facility. There is a 0.9 probability that the research will be favorable if the driving range
facility will be successful. Furthermore, it is estimated that there is a 0.8 probability that the marketing
research will be unfavorable if indeed the facility will be unsuccessful. John would like to determine
the chances of a successful driving range given a favorable result from the marketing survey.
Solution
This problem requires the use of Bayes’ theorem. Before we start to solve the problem, we will define
the following terms:
P(SF)  probability of successful driving range facility
P(UF)  probability of unsuccessful driving range facility
P(RF | SF)  probability that the research will be favorable given a successful driving range facility
P(RU | SF)  probability that the research will be unfavorable given a successful driving range facility
P(RU | UF)  probability that the research will be unfavorable given an unsuccessful driving range facility
P(RF | UF)  probability that the research will be favorable given an unsuccessful driving range facility
Now, we can summarize what we know:
From this information we can compute three additional probabilities that we need to solve the problem:
Now we can put these values into Bayes’ theorem to compute the desired probability:

3-17 Kenneth Brown is the principal owner of Brown Oil,
Inc. After quitting his university teaching job, Ken
has been able to increase his annual salary by a fac-
tor of over 100. At the present time, Ken is forced to
consider purchasing some more equipment for
Brown Oil because of competition. His alternatives
are shown in the following table:

For example, if Ken purchases a Sub 100 and if
there is a favorable market, he will realize a profit
of $300,000. On the other hand, if the market is un-
favorable, Ken will suffer a loss of $200,000. But
Ken has always been a very optimistic decision
maker.
(a) What type of decision is Ken facing?
(b) What decision criterion should he use?
(c) What alternative is best?
3-18 Although Ken Brown (discussed in Problem 3-17)
is the principal owner of Brown Oil, his brother
Bob is credited with making the company a
financial success. Bob is vice president of finance.
Bob attributes his success to his pessimistic atti-
tude about business and the oil industry. Given the
information from Problem 3-17, it is likely that
Bob will arrive at a different decision. What deci-
sion criterion should Bob use, and what alternative
will he select?
3-19 The Lubricant is an expensive oil newsletter to
which many oil giants subscribe, including Ken
Brown (see Problem 3-17 for details). In the last
issue, the letter described how the demand for oil
products would be extremely high. Apparently, the
American consumer will continue to use oil prod-
ucts even if the price of these products doubles.
Indeed, one of the articles in the Lubricant
states that the chances of a favorable market for oil
products was 70%, while the chance of an unfavor-
able market was only 30%. Ken would like to
use these probabilities in determining the best
decision.
(a) What decision model should be used?
(b) What is the optimal decision?
(c) Ken believes that the $300,000 figure for the Sub
100 with a favorable market is too high. How
much lower would this figure have to be for Ken
to change his decision made in part (b)?

3-22 Allen Young has always been proud of his personal
investment strategies and has done very well over
the past several years. He invests primarily in the
stock market. Over the past several months, how-
ever, Allen has become very concerned about the
stock market as a good investment. In some cases it
would have been better for Allen to have his money
in a bank than in the market. During the next year,
Allen must decide whether to invest $10,000 in the
stock market or in a certificate of deposit (CD) at an
interest rate of 9%. If the market is good, Allen
believes that he could get a 14% return on his
money. With a fair market, he expects to get an 8%
return. If the market is bad, he will most likely get
no return at all—in other words, the return would be
0%. Allen estimates that the probability of a good
market is 0.4, the probability of a fair market is 0.4,
and the probability of a bad market is 0.2, and he
wishes to maximize his long-run average return.
(a) Develop a decision table for this problem.
(b) What is the best decision?
3-23 In Problem 3-22 you helped Allen Young determine
the best investment strategy. Now, Young is thinking
about paying for a stock market newsletter. A friend
of Young said that these types of letters could pre-
dict very accurately whether the market would be
good, fair, or poor. Then, based on these predictions,
Allen could make better investment decisions.
(a) What is the most that Allen would be willing to
pay for a newsletter?
(b) Young now believes that a good market will give
a return of only 11% instead of 14%. Will this in-
formation change the amount that Allen would be
willing to pay for the newsletter? If your answer
is yes, determine the most that Allen would be
willing to pay, given this new information.

3-25 Brilliant Color is a small supplier of chemicals and
equipment that are used by some photographic
stores to process 35mm film. One product that Bril-
liant Color supplies is BC-6. John Kubick, president
of Brilliant Color, normally stocks 11, 12, or 13
cases of BC-6 each week. For each case that John
sells, he receives a profit of $35. Like many photo-
graphic chemicals, BC-6 has a very short shelf life,
so if a case is not sold by the end of the week, John
must discard it. Since each case costs John $56, he
loses $56 for every case that is not sold by the end of
the week. There is a probability of 0.45 of selling 
11 cases, a probability of 0.35 of selling 12 cases,
and a probability of 0.2 of selling 13 cases.
(a) Construct a decision table for this problem. In-
clude all conditional values and probabilities in
the table.

ent that stabilizes it so that it no longer has to be
discarded, how would this change your recom-
mended course of action?
3-26 Megley Cheese Company is a small manufacturer of
several different cheese products. One of the prod-

Jason Megley must decide how many cases of
cheese spread to manufacture each month. The prob-
ability that the demand will be six cases is 0.1, for 
7 cases is 0.3, for 8 cases is 0.5, and for 9 cases is
0.1. The cost of every case is $45, and the price that
Jason gets for each case is $95. Unfortunately, any
cases not sold by the end of the month are of no

and sells for $15. If there are any cases not sold by
the end of the day, they are sold to a large food pro-
cessing company for $3 a case. The probability that
daily demand will be 100 cases is 0.3, the probabil-
ity that daily demand will be 200 cases is 0.4, and
the probability that daily demand will be 300 cases
is 0.3. Farm Grown has a policy of always satisfying
customer demands. If its own supply of cases is less
than the demand, it buys the necessary vegetables
from a competitor. The estimated cost of doing this
is $16 per case.

3-29 Beverly Mills has decided to lease a hybrid car to
save on gasoline expenses and to do her part to help
keep the environment clean. The car she selected is
available from only one dealer in the local area, but
that dealer has several leasing options to accommo-
date a variety of driving patterns. All the leases are
for 3 years and require no money at the time of
signing the lease. The first option has a monthly
cost of $330, a total mileage allowance of 36,000
miles (an average of 12,000 miles per year), and a
cost of $0.35 per mile for any miles over 36,000.
The following table summarizes each of the three
lease options:
Beverly has estimated that, during the 3 years of the
lease, there is a 40% chance she will drive an aver-
age of 12,000 miles per year, a 30% chance she will
drive an average of 15,000 miles per year, and a 30%
chance that she will drive 18,000 miles per year. In
evaluating these lease options, Beverly would like to
keep her costs as low as possible.
(a) Develop a payoff (cost) table for this situation.
(b) What decision would Beverly make if she were
optimistic?
(c) What decision would Beverly make if she were
pessimistic?
(d) What decision would Beverly make if she wanted
to minimize her expected cost (monetary value)?
(e) Calculate the expected value of perfect informa-
tion for this problem.
3-30 Refer to the leasing decision facing Beverly Mills in
Problem 3-29. Develop the opportunity loss table for
this situation. Which option would be chosen based
on the minimax regret criterion? Which alternative
would result in the lowest expected opportunity
loss?
3-31 The game of roulette is popular in many casinos
around the world. In Las Vegas, a typical roulette
wheel has the numbers 1–36 in slots on the wheel.
Half of these slots are red, and the other half are
black. In the United States, the roulette wheel typi-
cally also has the numbers 0 (zero) and 00 (double
zero), and both of these are on the wheel in green
slots. Thus, there are 38 slots on the wheel. The
dealer spins the wheel and sends a small ball in the
opposite direction of the spinning wheel. As the
wheel slows, the ball falls into one of the slots, and
that is the winning number and color. One of the bets
available is simply red or black, for which the odds
are 1 to 1. If the player bets on either red or black,
and that happens to be the winning color, the player
wins the amount of her bet. For example, if the
player bets $5 on red and wins, she is paid $5 and
she still has her original bet. On the other hand, if
the winning color is black or green when the player
bets red, the player loses the entire bet.
(a) What is the probability that a player who bets
red will win the bet?
(b) If a player bets $10 on red every time the game
is played, what is the expected monetary value
(expected win)?

(c) In Europe, there is usually no 00 on the wheel, just
the 0. With this type of game, what is the probabil-
ity that a player who bets red will win the bet? If a
player bets $10 on red every time in this game
(with no 00), what is the expected monetary value?
(d) Since the expected profit (win) in a roulette
game is negative, why would a rational person
play the game?
3-32
Refer to the Problem 3-31 for details about the game of
roulette. Another bet in a roulette game is called a
“straight up” bet, which means that the player is betting
that the winning number will be the number that she
chose. In a game with 0 and 00, there are a total of 38
possible outcomes (the numbers 1 to 36 plus 0 and 00),
and each of these has the same chance of occurring. The
payout on this type of bet is 35 to 1, which means the
player is paid 35 and gets to keep the original bet. If a
player bets $10 on the number 7 (or any single number),
what is the expected monetary value (expected win)?

The Technically Techno company has several patents
for a variety of different Flash memory devices that are
used in computers, cell phones, and a variety of other
things. A competitor has recently introduced a product
based on technology very similar to something
patented by Technically Techno last year. Conse-
quently, Technically Techno has sued the other com-
pany for copyright infringement. Based on the facts in
the case as well as the record of the lawyers involved,
Technically Techno believes there is a 40% chance that
it will be awarded $300,000 if the lawsuit goes to court.
There is a 30% chance that they would be awarded
only $50,000 if they go to court and win, and there is a
30% chance they would lose the case and be awarded
nothing. The estimated cost of legal fees if they go to
court is $50,000. However, the other company has of-
fered to pay Technically Techno $75,000 to settle the
dispute without going to court. The estimated legal cost
of this would only be $10,000. If Technically Techno
wished to maximize the expected gain, should they ac-
cept the settlement offer?
3-34 A group of medical professionals is considering the
construction of a private clinic. If the medical de-
mand is high (i.e., there is a favorable market for the
clinic), the physicians could realize a net profit of
$100,000. If the market is not favorable, they could
lose $40,000. Of course, they don’t have to proceed
at all, in which case there is no cost. In the absence
of any market data, the best the physicians can guess
is that there is a 50–50 chance the clinic will be suc-
cessful. Construct a decision tree to help analyze this
problem. What should the medical professionals do?
3-35 The physicians in Problem 3-34 have been ap-
proached by a market research firm that offers to
perform a study of the market at a fee of $5,000. The
market researchers claim their experience enables
them to use Bayes’ theorem to make the following
statements of probability:
(a) Develop a new decision tree for the medical pro-
fessionals to reflect the options now open with
the market study.
(b) Use the EMV approach to recommend a strategy.
(c) What is the expected value of sample informa-
tion? How much might the physicians be willing
to pay for a market study?
(d) Calculate the efficiency of this sample information.

Jerry Smith is thinking about opening a bicycle shop
in his hometown. Jerry loves to take his own bike on
50-mile trips with his friends, but he believes that any
small business should be started only if there is a good
chance of making a profit. Jerry can open a small
shop, a large shop, or no shop at all. The profits will
depend on the size of the shop and whether the market
is favorable or unfavorable for his products. Because
there will be a 5-year lease on the building that Jerry is
thinking about using, he wants to make sure that he
makes the correct decision. Jerry is also thinking about
hiring his old marketing professor to conduct a mar-
keting research study. If the study is conducted, the
study could be favorable (i.e., predicting a favorable
market) or unfavorable (i.e., predicting an unfavorable
market). Develop a decision tree for Jerry.
3-37 Jerry Smith (see Problem 3-36) has done some analy-
sis about the profitability of the bicycle shop. If Jerry
builds the large bicycle shop, he will earn $60,000 if
the market is favorable, but he will lose $40,000 if the
market is unfavorable. The small shop will return a
$30,000 profit in a favorable market and a $10,000
loss in an unfavorable market. At the present time, he
believes that there is a 50–50 chance that the market
will be favorable. His old marketing professor will
charge him $5,000 for the marketing research. It is es-
timated that there is a 0.6 probability that the survey
will be favorable. Furthermore, there is a 0.9 proba-
bility that the market will be favorable given a favor-
able outcome from the study. However, the marketing
professor has warned Jerry that there is only a proba-
bility of 0.12 of a favorable market if the marketing
research results are not favorable. Jerry is confused.
(a) Should Jerry use the marketing research?
(b) Jerry, however, is unsure the 0.6 probability of a
favorable marketing research study is correct. How

3-38 Bill Holliday is not sure what she should do. He can
either build a quadplex (i.e., a building with four
apartments), build a duplex, gather additional infor-
mation, or simply do nothing. If he gathers additional
information, the results could be either favorable or
unfavorable, but it would cost him $3,000 to gather
the information. Bill believes that there is a 50–50
chance that the information will be favorable. If the
rental market is favorable, Bill will earn $15,000
with the quadplex or $5,000 with the duplex. Bill
doesn’t have the financial resources to do both. With
an unfavorable rental market, however, Bill could
lose $20,000 with the quadplex or $10,000 with the
duplex. Without gathering additional information,
Bill estimates that the probability of a favorable
rental market is 0.7. A favorable report from the
study would increase the probability of a favorable
rental market to 0.9. Furthermore, an unfavorable re-
port from the additional information would decrease
the probability of a favorable rental market to 0.4. Of
course, Bill could forget all of these numbers and do
nothing. What is your advice to Bill?
3-39 Peter Martin is going to help his brother who wants
to open a food store. Peter initially believes that there
is a 50–50 chance that his brother’s food store would
be a success. Peter is considering doing a market re-
search study. Based on historical data, there is a 0.8
probability that the marketing research will be favor-
able given a successful food store. Moreover, there is
a 0.7 probability that the marketing research will be
unfavorable given an unsuccessful food store.
(a) If the marketing research is favorable, what is
Peter’s revised probability of a successful food
store for his brother?
(b) If the marketing research is unfavorable, what is
Peter’s revised probability of a successful food
store for his brother?

racquetball facility is only 30%. Mark’s lawyer has
recommended that he employ one of the local market-
ing research groups to conduct a survey concerning
the success or failure of a racquetball facility. There is
a 0.8 probability that the research will be favorable
given a successful racquetball facility. In addition,
there is a 0.7 probability that the research will be
unfavorable given an unsuccessful facility. Compute
revised probabilities of a successful racquetball facil-
ity given a favorable and given an unfavorable survey.
3-41 A financial advisor has recommended two possible
mutual funds for investment: Fund A and Fund B.
The return that will be achieved by each of these
depends on whether the economy is good, fair, or
poor. A payoff table has been constructed to illus-
trate this situation:

(a) Draw the decision tree to represent this situation.
(b) Perform the necessary calculations to determine

(c) Suppose there is question about the return of
Fund A in a good economy. It could be higher or

cause a person to be indifferent between Fund A
and Fund B (i.e., the EMVs would be the same)?
3-42 Jim Sellers is thinking about producing a new type of
electric razor for men. If the market were favorable,
he would get a return of $100,000, but if the market
for this new type of razor were unfavorable, he would
lose $60,000. Since Ron Bush is a good friend of Jim
Sellers, Jim is considering the possibility of using
Bush Marketing Research to gather additional infor-
mation about the market for the razor. Ron has sug-
gested that Jim either use a survey or a pilot study to
test the market. The survey would be a sophisticated
questionnaire administered to a test market. It will
cost $5,000. Another alternative is to run a pilot study.
This would involve producing a limited number of the
new razors and trying to sell them in two cities that
are typical of American cities. The pilot study is more
accurate but is also more expensive. It will cost
$20,000. Ron Bush has suggested that it would be a
good idea for Jim to conduct either the survey or the
pilot before Jim makes the decision concerning
whether to produce the new razor. But Jim is not sure
if the value of the survey or the pilot is worth the cost.
Jim estimates that the probability of a successful
market without performing a survey or pilot study is
0.5. Furthermore, the probability of a favorable sur-
vey result given a favorable market for razors is 0.7,
and the probability of a favorable survey result given
an unsuccessful market for razors is 0.2. In addition,
the probability of an unfavorable pilot study given
an unfavorable market is 0.9, and the probability of
an unsuccessful pilot study result given a favorable
market for razors is 0.2.

the decision criterion.
3-43 Jim Sellers has been able to estimate his utility for a
number of different values. He would like to use
these utility values in making the decision in Prob-
lem 3-42: 
and
Resolve Problem 3-42 using utility values. Is Jim a
risk avoider?
3-44 Two states of nature exist for a particular situation: a
good economy and a poor economy. An economic
study may be performed to obtain more information
about which of these will actually occur in the com-
ing year. The study may forecast either a good econ-
omy or a poor economy. Currently there is a 60%
chance that the economy will be good and a 40%
chance that it will be poor. In the past, whenever the
economy was good, the economic study predicted it
would be good 80% of the time. (The other 20% of
the time the prediction was wrong.) In the past, when-
ever the economy was poor, the economic study pre-
dicted it would be poor 90% of the time. (The other
10% of the time the prediction was wrong.)
(a) Use Bayes’ theorem and find the following:
(b) Suppose the initial (prior) probability of a good
economy is 70% (instead of 60%), and the prob-
ability of a poor economy is 30% (instead of
40%). Find the posterior probabilities in part a
based on these new values.
3-45 The Long Island Life Insurance Company sells a
term life insurance policy. If the policy holder dies
during the term of the policy, the company pays
$100,000. If the person does not die, the company
pays out nothing and there is no further value to the
policy. The company uses actuarial tables to deter-
mine the probability that a person with certain char-
acteristics will die during the coming year. For a
particular individual, it is determined that there is a
0.001 chance that the person will die in the next year
and a 0.999 chance that the person will live and the
company will pay out nothing. The cost of this pol-
icy is $200 per year. Based on the EMV criterion,
should the individual buy this insurance policy?
How would utility theory help explain why a person
would buy this insurance policy?

3-47 In this chapter a decision tree was developed for
John Thompson (see Figure 3.5 for the complete de-
cision tree analysis). After completing the analysis,
John was not completely sure that he is indifferent
to risk. After going through a number of standard
gambles, John was able to assess his utility for
money. Here are some of the utility assessments:
U1$02 = 0.3, U1$90,0002 =
U1-$10,0002 = 0.2,

McKell’s hometown have gotten worse. Now, Broad
Street is congested about half the time. The normal
travel time to work for Lynn is only 15 minutes
when Broad Street is used and there is no conges-
tion. With congestion, however, it takes Lynn
40 minutes to get to work. If Lynn decides to take

3-49 Coren Chemical, Inc., develops industrial chemicals
that are used by other manufacturers to produce pho-
tographic chemicals, preservatives, and lubricants.
One of their products, K-1000, is used by several
photographic companies to make a chemical that is
used in the film-developing process. To produce
K-1000 efficiently, Coren Chemical uses the batch
approach, in which a certain number of gallons is
produced at one time. This reduces setup costs and
allows Coren Chemical to produce K-1000 at a com-
petitive price. Unfortunately, K-1000 has a very
short shelf life of about one month.
Coren Chemical produces K-1000 in batches
of 500 gallons, 1,000 gallons, 1,500 gallons, and
2,000 gallons. Using historical data, David Coren
was able to determine that the probability of selling
500 gallons of K-1000 is 0.2. The probabilities of
selling 1,000, 1,500, and 2,000 gallons are 0.3, 0.4,
and 0.1, respectively. The question facing David is
U140 minutes2 = 0.2.
U115 minutes2 = 0.9, U130 minutes2 = 0.7,
U1$200,0002 = 1.0.
0.5, U1$100,0002 = 0.6, U1$190,0002 = 0.95,

DISCUSSION QUESTIONS AND PROBLEMS
109
how many gallons to produce of K-1000 in the next
batch run. K-1000 sells for $20 per gallon. Manufac-
turing cost is $12 per gallon, and handling costs and
warehousing costs are estimated to be $1 per gallon.
In the past, David has allocated advertising costs to
K-1000 at $3 per gallon. If K-1000 is not sold after
the batch run, the chemical loses much of its impor-
tant properties as a developer. It can, however, be
sold at a salvage value of $13 per gallon. Further-
more, David has guaranteed to his suppliers that
there will always be an adequate supply of K-1000.
If David does run out, he has agreed to purchase a
comparable chemical from a competitor at $25 per
gallon. David sells all of the chemical at $20 per gal-
lon, so his shortage means that David loses the $5 to
buy the more expensive chemical.

The Jamis Corporation is involved with waste man-
agement. During the past 10 years it has become 
one of the largest waste disposal companies in the
Midwest, serving primarily Wisconsin, Illinois, and
Michigan. Bob Jamis, president of the company, is
considering the possibility of establishing a waste
treatment plant in Mississippi. From past experience,
Bob believes that a small plant in northern Mississippi
would yield a $500,000 profit regardless of the market
for the facility. The success of a medium-sized waste
treatment plant would depend on the market. With a
low demand for waste treatment, Bob expects a
$200,000 return. A medium demand would yield a
$700,000 return in Bob’s estimation, and a high de-
mand would return $800,000. Although a large facil-
ity is much riskier, the potential return is much greater.
With a high demand for waste treatment in Missis-
sippi, the large facility should return a million dollars.
With a medium demand, the large facility will return
only $400,000. Bob estimates that the large facility
would be a big loser if there were a low demand for
waste treatment. He estimates that he would lose ap-
proximately $200,000 with a large treatment facility if
demand were indeed low. Looking at the economic
conditions for the upper part of the state of Mississippi
and using his experience in the field, Bob estimates
that the probability of a low demand for treatment
plants is 0.15. The probability for a medium-demand
facility is approximately 0.40, and the probability of a
high demand for a waste treatment facility is 0.45.
Because of the large potential investment and
the possibility of a loss, Bob has decided to hire 
a market research team that is based in Jackson,
Mississippi. This team will perform a survey to get a
better feeling for the probability of a low, medium,
or high demand for a waste treatment facility. 
The cost of the survey is $50,000. To help Bob de-
termine whether to go ahead with the survey, the
marketing research firm has provided Bob with the
following information:
P(survey results | possible outcomes)

As you see, the survey could result in three pos-
sible outcomes. Low survey results mean that a low
demand is likely. In a similar fashion, medium survey
results or high survey results would mean a medium
or a high demand, respectively. What should Bob do?
3-51 Mary is considering opening a new grocery store
in town. She is evaluating three sites: downtown,
the mall, and out at the busy traffic circle. Mary cal-
culated the value of successful stores at these loca-
tions as follows: downtown, $250,000; the mall,
$300,000; the circle, $400,000. Mary calculated the
losses if unsuccessful to be $100,000 at either down-
town or the mall and $200,000 at the circle. Mary
figures her chance of success to be 50% downtown,
60% at the mall, and 75% at the traffic circle.
(a) Draw a decision tree for Mary and select her best

(b) Mary has been approached by a marketing re-
search firm that offers to study the area to deter-
mine if another grocery store is needed. The cost

Case Study
Starting Right Corporation
After watching a movie about a young woman who quit a
successful corporate career to start her own baby food com-
pany, Julia Day decided that she wanted to do the same. In
the movie, the baby food company was very successful. Julia
knew, however, that it is much easier to make a movie about
a successful woman starting her own company than to actu-
ally do it. The product had to be of the highest quality, and
Julia had to get the best people involved to launch the new
company. Julia resigned from her job and launched her new
company—Starting Right.
Julia decided to target the upper end of the baby food mar-
ket by producing baby food that contained no preservatives but
had a great taste. Although the price would be slightly higher
than for existing baby food, Julia believed that parents would be
willing to pay more for a high-quality baby food. Instead of put-
ting baby food in jars, which would require preservatives to sta-
bilize the food, Julia decided to try a new approach. The baby
food would be frozen. This would allow for natural ingredients,
no preservatives, and outstanding nutrition.
Getting good people to work for the new company was
also important. Julia decided to find people with experience
in finance, marketing, and production to get involved with
Starting Right. With her enthusiasm and charisma, Julia was
able to find such a group. Their first step was to develop
prototypes of the new frozen baby food and to perform a
small pilot test of the new product. The pilot test received
rave reviews.
The final key to getting the young company off to a good
start was to raise funds. Three options were considered: corpo-
rate bonds, preferred stock, and common stock. Julia decided
that each investment should be in blocks of $30,000. Further-
more, each investor should have an annual income of at least
$40,000 and a net worth of $100,000 to be eligible to invest in
Starting Right. Corporate bonds would return 13% per year for
information is not favorable, the probability of a suc-
cessful store is only 0.2. Without any information,
Sue estimates that the probability of a successful
store will be 0.6. A successful store will give a re-
turn of $100,000. If the store is built but is not suc-
cessful, Sue will see a loss of $80,000. Of course,
she could always decide not to build the retail store.
(a) What do you recommend?
(b) What impact would a 0.7 probability of obtain-
ing favorable information have on Sue’s deci-
sion? The probability of obtaining unfavorable
information would be 0.3.
(c) Sue believes that the probabilities of a successful
and an unsuccessful retail store given favorable
information might be 0.8 and 0.2, respectively,
instead of 0.9 and 0.1, respectively. What impact,
if any, would this have on Sue’s decision and the
best EMV?
(d) Sue had to pay $20,000 to get information. Would
her decision change if the cost of the information
increased to $30,000?
(e) Using the data in this problem and the following

the next five years. Julia furthermore guaranteed that investors
in the corporate bonds would get at least $20,000 back at the
end of five years. Investors in preferred stock should see their
initial investment increase by a factor of 4 with a good market
or see the investment worth only half of the initial investment
with an unfavorable market. The common stock had the great-
est potential. The initial investment was expected to increase by
a factor of 8 with a good market, but investors would lose every-
thing if the market was unfavorable. During the next five years,
it was expected that inflation would increase by a factor of 4.5%
each year.
Discussion Questions
1. Sue Pansky, a retired elementary school teacher, is con-
sidering investing in Starting Right. She is very conserva-
tive and is a risk avoider. What do you recommend?
2. Ray Cahn, who is currently a commodities broker, is also
considering an investment, although he believes that there is
only an 11% chance of success. What do you recommend?
3. Lila Battle has decided to invest in Starting Right. While
she believes that Julia has a good chance of being suc-
cessful, Lila is a risk avoider and very conservative. What
is your advice to Lila?
4. George Yates believes that there is an equally likely
chance for success. What is your recommendation?
5. Peter Metarko is extremely optimistic about the market
for the new baby food. What is your advice for Pete?
6. Julia Day has been told that developing the legal docu-
ments for each fundraising alternative is expensive. Julia
would like to offer alternatives for both risk-averse and
risk-seeking investors. Can Julia delete one of the finan-
cial alternatives and still offer investment choices for risk
seekers and risk avoiders?
Case Study
Blake Electronics
In 1979, Steve Blake founded Blake Electronics in Long
Beach, California, to manufacture resistors, capacitors, induc-
tors, and other electronic components. During the Vietnam
War, Steve was a radio operator, and it was during this time that
he became proficient at repairing radios and other communica-
tions equipment. Steve viewed his four-year experience with
the army with mixed feelings. He hated army life, but this ex-
perience gave him the confidence and the initiative to start his
own electronics firm.
Over the years, Steve kept the business relatively unchanged.
By 1992, total annual sales were in excess of $2 million. In 1996,
Steve’s son, Jim, joined the company after finishing high school
and two years of courses in electronics at Long Beach Commu-
nity College. Jim was always aggressive in high school athletics,
and he became even more aggressive as general sales manager of
Blake Electronics. This aggressiveness bothered Steve, who was
more conservative. Jim would make deals to supply companies
with electronic components before he bothered to find out if
Blake Electronics had the ability or capacity to produce the com-
ponents. On several occasions this behavior caused the company
some embarrassing moments when Blake Electronics was unable
to produce the electronic components for companies with which
Jim had made deals.
In 2000, Jim started to go after government contracts for
electronic components. By 2002, total annual sales had in-
creased to more than $10 million, and the number of employees
exceeded 200. Many of these employees were electronic spe-
cialists and graduates of electrical engineering programs from
top colleges and universities. But Jim’s tendency to stretch
Blake Electronics to contracts continued as well, and by 2007,
Blake Electronics had a reputation with government agencies as
a company that could not deliver what it promised. Almost
overnight, government contracts stopped, and Blake Electronics
was left with an idle workforce and unused manufacturing
equipment. This high overhead started to melt away profits, and
in 2009, Blake Electronics was faced with the possibility of sus-
taining a loss for the first time in its history.
In 2010, Steve decided to look at the possibility of manu-
facturing electronic components for home use. Although this
was a totally new market for Blake Electronics, Steve was con-
vinced that this was the only way to keep Blake Electronics
from dipping into the red. The research team at Blake Electron-
ics was given the task of developing new electronic devices for
home use. The first idea from the research team was the Master
Control Center. The basic components for this system are
shown in Figure 3.15.

CHAPTER 3 • DECISION ANALYSIS
The heart of the system is the master control box. This unit,
which would have a retail price of $250, has two rows of five
buttons. Each button controls one light or appliance and can be
set as either a switch or a rheostat. When set as a switch, a light
finger touch on the button either turns a light or appliance on or
off. When set as a rheostat, a finger touching the button controls
the intensity of the light. Leaving your finger on the button
makes the light go through a complete cycle ranging from off to
bright and back to off again.
To allow for maximum flexibility, each master control box
is powered by two D-sized batteries that can last up to a year,
depending on usage. In addition, the research team has devel-
oped three versions of the master control box—versions A, B,
and C. If a family wants to control more than 10 lights or appli-
ances, another master control box can be purchased.
The lightbulb disk, which would have a retail price of
$2.50, is controlled by the master control box and is used to
control the intensity of any light. A different disk is available
for each button position for all three master control boxes. By
inserting the lightbulb disk between the lightbulb and the
socket, the appropriate button on the master control box can
completely control the intensity of the light. If a standard light
switch is used, it must be on at all times for the master control
box to work.
One disadvantage of using a standard light switch is that
only the master control box can be used to control the particular
light. To avoid this problem, the research team developed a spe-
cial light switch adapter that would sell for $15. When this de-
vice is installed, either the master control box or the light switch
adapter can be used to control the light.
When used to control appliances other than lights, the mas-
ter control box must be used in conjunction with one or more
outlet adapters. The adapters are plugged into a standard wall out-
let, and the appliance is then plugged into the adapter. Each outlet
adapter has a switch on top that allows the appliance to be con-
trolled from the master control box or the outlet adapter. The
price of each outlet adapter would be $25.
The research team estimated that it would cost $500,000
to develop the equipment and procedures needed to manufac-
ture the master control box and accessories. If successful, this
venture could increase sales by approximately $2 million. But
will the master control boxes be a successful venture? With a
60% chance of success estimated by the research team, Steve
had serious doubts about trying to market the master control
boxes even though he liked the basic idea. Because of his reser-
vations, Steve decided to send requests for proposals (RFPs)
for additional marketing research to 30 marketing research
companies in southern California.
The first RFP to come back was from a small company
called Marketing Associates, Inc. (MAI), which would charge
$100,000 for the survey. According to its proposal, MAI has
been in business for about three years and has conducted about
100 marketing research projects. MAI’s major strengths ap-
peared to be individual attention to each account, experienced
staff, and fast work. Steve was particularly interested in one part
of the proposal, which revealed MAI’s success record with pre-
vious accounts. This is shown in Table 3.15.
The only other proposal to be returned was by a branch
office of Iverstine and Walker, one of the largest marketing
research firms in the country. The cost for a complete survey
would be $300,000. While the proposal did not contain the
same success record as MAI, the proposal from Iverstine and
Walker did contain some interesting information. The chance of
getting a favorable survey result, given a successful venture,
was 90%. On the other hand, the chance of getting an unfavor-
able survey result, given an unsuccessful venture, was 80%.
Thus, it appeared to Steve that Iverstine and Walker would be
able to predict the success or failure of the master control boxes
with a great amount of certainty.
Steve pondered the situation. Unfortunately, both market-
ing research teams gave different types of information in their
proposals. Steve concluded that there would be no way that the
two proposals could be compared unless he got additional infor-
mation from Iverstine and Walker. Furthermore, Steve wasn’t
sure what he would do with the information, and if it would be
worth the expense of hiring one of the marketing research firms.

Appendix 3.1: Decision Models with QM for Windows
QM for Windows can be used to solve decision theory problems discussed in this chapter. In this
appendix we show you how to solve straightforward decision theory problems that involve tables.
In this chapter we solved the Thompson Lumber problem. The alternatives include con-
structing a large plant, a small plant, or doing nothing. The probabilities of an unfavorable and a
favorable market, along with financial information, were presented in Table 3.9.
To demonstrate QM for Windows, let’s use these data to solve the Thompson Lumber prob-
lem. Program 3.3 shows the results. Note that the best alternative is to construct the medium-
sized plant, with an EMV of $40,000.
This chapter also covered decision making under uncertainty, where probability values were
not available or appropriate. Solution techniques for these types of problems were presented in
Section 3.4. Program 3.3 shows these results, including the maximax, maximin, and Hurwicz
solutions.
Chapter 3 also covers expected opportunity loss. To demonstrate the use of QM for Win-
dows, we can determine the EOL for the Thompson Lumber problem. The results are presented
in Program 3.4. Note that this program also computes EVPI.

Introduction
Regression analysis is a very valuable tool for today’s manager. Regression has been used to
model such things as the relationship between level of education and income, the price of a
house and the square footage, and the sales volume for a company relative to the dollars spent
on advertising. When businesses are trying to decide which location is best for a new store or
branch office, regression models are often used. Cost estimation models are often regression
models. The applicability of regression analysis is virtually limitless.
There are generally two purposes for regression analysis. The first is to understand
the relationship between variables such as advertising expenditures and sales. The second
purpose is to predict the value of one variable based on the value of the other. Because of
this, regression is a very important forecasting technique and will be mentioned again in
Chapter 5.
In this chapter, the simple linear regression model will first be developed, and then a
more complex multiple regression model will be used to incorporate even more variables into
our model. In any regression model, the variable to be predicted is called the dependent
variable or response variable. The value of this is said to be dependent upon the value of
an independent variable, which is sometimes called an explanatory variable or a predictor
variable.
Two purposes of regression
analysis are to understand the
relationship between variables
and to predict the value of one
based on the other.
4.2
Scatter Diagrams
To investigate the relationship between variables, it is helpful to look at a graph of the data. Such
a graph is often called a scatter diagram or a scatter plot. Normally the independent variable
is plotted on the horizontal axis and the dependent variable is plotted on the vertical axis. The
following example will illustrate this.
Triple A Construction Company renovates old homes in Albany. Over time, the company
has found that its dollar volume of renovation work is dependent on the Albany area payroll.
The figures for Triple A’s revenues and the amount of money earned by wage earners in Albany
for the past six years are presented in Table 4.1. Economists have predicted the local area pay-
roll to be $600 million next year, and Triple A wants to plan accordingly.
Figure 4.1 provides a scatter diagram for the Triple A Construction data given in Table 4.1.
This graph indicates that higher values for the local payroll seem to result in higher sales for the
company. There is not a perfect relationship because not all the points lie in a straight line, but
there is a relationship. A line has been drawn through the data to help show the relationship that
exists between the payroll and sales. The points do not all lie on the line, so there would be some
error involved if we tried to predict sales based on payroll using this or any other line. Many
lines could be drawn through these points, but which one best represents the true relationship?
Regression analysis provides the answer to this question.

Simple Linear Regression
In any regression model, there is an implicit assumption (which can be tested) that a relationship
exists between the variables. There is also some random error that cannot be predicted. The un-
derlying simple linear regression model is
(4-1)
where
dependent variable (response variable)
independent variable (predictor variable or explanatory variable)
intercept (value of Y when 
)
slope of regression line
random error
The true values for the intercept and slope are not known, and therefore they are estimated
using sample data. The regression equation based on sample data is given as
(4-2)
where

based on sample results
estimate of 
based on sample results
In the Triple A Construction example, we are trying to predict the sales, so the dependent
variable (Y) would be sales. The variable we use to help predict sales is the Albany area payroll,
so this is the independent variable (X). Although any number of lines can be drawn through these
points to show a relationship between X and Y in Figure 4.1, the line that will be chosen is the
one that in some way minimizes the errors. Error is defined as
(4-3)
Since errors may be positive or negative, the average error could be zero even though there are
extremely large errors—both positive and negative. To eliminate the difficulty of negative errors

Estimates of the slope and

data.
The regression line minimizes the
sum of the squared errors.

CHAPTER 4 • REGRESSION MODELS
canceling positive errors, the errors can be squared. The best regression line will be defined as
the one with the minimum sum of the squared errors. For this reason, regression analysis is
sometimes called least-squares regression.
Statisticians have developed formulas that we can use to find the equation of a straight line
that would minimize the sum of the squared errors. The simple linear regression equation is
The following formulas can be used to compute the intercept and the slope:

The preliminary calculations are shown in Table 4.2. There are other “shortcut” formulas that are
helpful when doing the computations on a calculator, and these are presented in Appendix 4.1.
They will not be shown here, as computer software will be used for most of the other examples in
this chapter.

4.4
Measuring the Fit of the Regression Model
A regression equation can be developed for any variables X and Y, even random numbers. We
certainly would not have any confidence in the ability of one random number to predict the value
of another random number. How do we know that the model is actually helpful in predicting Y
based on X? Should we have confidence in this model? Does the model provide better predic-
tions (smaller errors) than simply using the average of the Y values?
In the Triple A Construction example, sales figures (Y) varied from a low of 4.5 to a high of
9.5, and the mean was 7. If each sales value is compared with the mean, we see how far they
deviate from the mean and we could compute a measure of the total variability in sales. Because
Y is sometimes higher and sometimes lower than the mean, there may be both positive and nega-
tive deviations. Simply summing these values would be misleading because the negatives would
cancel out the positives, making it appear that the numbers are closer to the mean than they
actually are. To prevent this problem, we will use the sum of the squares total (SST) to meas-
ure the total variability in Y:
(4-6)
If we did not use X to predict Y, we would simply use the mean of Y as the prediction, and
the SST would measure the accuracy of our predictions. However, a regression line may be used
to predict the value of Y, and while there are still errors involved, the sum of these squared errors
will be less than the total sum of squares just computed. The sum of the squares error (SSE) is
(4-7)
Table 4.3 provides the calculations for the Triple A Construction Example. The mean
is compared to each value and we get
The prediction 
for each observation is computed and compared to the actual value. This
results in
The SSE is much lower than the SST. Using the regression line has reduced the variability
in the sum of squares by 
This is called the sum of squares due to
22.5 - 6.875 = 15.625.
SSE = 6.875
1YN2
SST = 22.5
1Y = 72
SSE = ge2 = g1Y - YN 22
SST = g1Y - Y22
Deviations (errors) may be
positive or negative.
The SST measures the total
variability in Y about the mean.
The SSE measures the variability
in Y about the regression line.
One of the purposes of regression is to understand the relationship among variables. This
model tells us that for each $100 million (represented by X) increase in the payroll, we would ex-
pect the sales to increase by $125,000 since 
($100,000s). This model helps Triple A
Construction see how the local economy and company sales are related.

regression (SSR) and indicates how much of the total variability in Y is explained by the regres-
sion model. Mathematically, this can be calculated as
(4-8)
Table 4.3 indicates
There is a very important relationship between the sums of squares that we have computed:
(4-9)
Figure 4.2 displays the data for Triple A Construction. The regression line is shown, as is a
line representing the mean of the Y values. The errors used in computing the sums of squares are
shown on this graph. Notice how the sample points are closer to the regression line than they are
to the mean.
Coefficient of Determination
The SSR is sometimes called the explained variability in Y while the SSE is the unexplained
variability in Y. The proportion of the variability in Y that is explained by the regression equa-
tion is called the coefficient of determination and is denoted by 
Thus,
(4-10)
Thus, 
can be found using either the SSR or the SSE. For Triple A Construction, we have
This means that about 69% of the variability in sales (Y) is explained by the regression equation
based on payroll (X).
If every point in the sample were on the regression line (meaning all errors are 0), then
100% of the variability in Y could be explained by the regression equation, so 
and
The lowest possible value of 
is 0, indicating that X explains 0% of the variability in Y.
Thus, 
can range from a low of 0 to a high of 1. In developing regression equations, a good
model will have an 
value close to 1.

Multiple Regression Modeling at Canada’s
TransAlta Utilities
TransAlta Utilities (TAU) is a $1.6 billion energy company oper-
ating in Canada, New Zealand, Australia, Argentina, and the
United States. Headquartered in Alberta, Canada, TAU is that
country’s largest publicly owned utility. It serves 340,000 cus-
tomers in Alberta through 57 customer-service facilities, each of
which was staffed by 5 to 20 customer service linemen. The 270
linemen’s jobs are to handle new connections and repairs and to
patrol power lines and check substations. This existing system
was not the result of some optimal central planning but was put
in place incrementally as the company grew.
With help from the University of Alberta, TAU wanted to develop
a causal model to decide how many linemen would be best assigned
to each facility. The research team decided to build a multiple regres-
sion model with only three independent variables. The hardest part
of the task was to select variables that were easy to quantify based
on available data. In the end, the explanatory variables were number
of urban customers, number of rural customers, and geographic size
of a service area. The implicit assumptions in this model are that the
time spent on customers is proportional to the number of customers;
and the time spent on facilities (line patrol and substation checks) and
travel are proportional to the size of the service region. By definition,
the unexplained time in the model accounts for time that is not
explained by the three variables (such as meetings, breaks, or unpro-
ductive time).
Not only did the results of the model please TAU managers,
but the project (which included optimizing the number of facili-
ties and their locations) saved $4 million per year.

Using Computer Software for Regression
Software such as QM for Windows (Appendix 4.2), Excel, and Excel QM (Appendix 4.3) is
often used for regression calculations. We will rely on Excel for most of the calculations in the
rest of this chapter. When using Excel to develop a regression model, the input and output for
Excel 2007 and Excel 2010 are the same.
The Triple A Construction example will be used to illustrate how to develop a regression
model in Excel 2010. Go to the Data tab and select Data Analysis, as shown in Program 4.1A.
If Data Analysis does not appear, then the Excel add-in Data Analysis from the Analysis Tool-
Pak must be enabled or activated. Appendix F at the end of this book provides instructions on
how to enable this and other add-ins for Excel 2010 and Excel 2007. Once an add-in is activated,
it will remain on the Data tab for future use.
When the Data Analysis window opens, scroll down to and highlight Regression and
click OK, as illustrated in Program 4.1A. The Regression window will open, as shown in
Program 4.1B, and you can input the X and Y ranges. Check the Labels box because the cells
with the variable name were included in the first row of the X and Y ranges. To have the out-
put presented on this page rather than on a new worksheet, select Output Range and give a
cell address for the start of the output. Click the OK button, and the output appears in the out-
put range specified.
Program 4.1C shows the intercept (2), slope (1.25), and other information that was previ-
ously calculated for the Triple A Construction example.
The sums of squares are shown in the column headed by SS. Another name for error is
residual. In Excel, the sum of squares error is shown as the sum of squares residual. The values
in this output are the same values shown in Table 4.3:
The coefficient of determination 
is shown to be 0.6944. The coefficient of correlation (r) is 
called Multiple R in the Excel output, and this is 0.8333.

Assumptions of the Regression Model
If we can make certain assumptions about the errors in a regression model, we can perform statisti-
cal tests to determine if the model is useful. The following assumptions are made about the errors:
1. The errors are independent.
2. The errors are normally distributed.
3. The errors have a mean of zero.
4. The errors have a constant variance (regardless of the value of X).

It is possible to check the data to see if these assumptions are met. Often a plot of the residuals
will highlight any glaring violations of the assumptions. When the errors (residuals) are plotted
against the independent variable, the pattern should appear random.
Figure 4.4 presents some typical error patterns, with Figure 4.4A displaying a pattern that is
expected when the assumptions are met and the model is appropriate. The errors are random and
no discernible pattern is present. Figure 4.4B demonstrates an error pattern in which the errors
increase as X increases, violating the constant variance assumption. Figure 4.4C shows errors

consistently increasing at first, and then consistently decreasing. A pattern such as this would
indicate that the model is not linear and some other form (perhaps quadratic) should be used. In
general, patterns in the plot of the errors indicate problems with the assumptions or the model
specification.
Estimating the Variance
While the errors are assumed to have constant variance 
this is usually not known. It can be
estimated from the sample results. The estimate of 
is the mean squared error (MSE) and is
denoted by 
The MSE is the sum of squares due to error divided by the degrees of freedom:*

From this we can estimate the standard deviation as

This is called the standard error of the estimate or the standard deviation of the regression.

This is used in many of the statistical tests about the model. It is also used to find interval
estimates for both Y and regression coefficients.**

**The MSE is a common measure of accuracy in forecasting. When used with techniques besides regression, it is com-
mon to divide the SSE by n rather than n - k - 1.
The error variance is estimated
by the MSE.
4.7
Testing the Model for Significance
Both the MSE and 
provide a measure of accuracy in a regression model. However, when the
sample size is too small, it is possible to get good values for both of these even if there is no
relationship between the variables in the regression model. To determine whether these values
are meaningful, it is necessary to test the model for significance.
To see if there is a linear relationship between X and Y, a statistical hypothesis test is per-
formed. The underlying linear model was given in Equation 4-1 as
If 
then Y does not depend on X in any way. The null hypothesis says there is no linear
relationship between the two variables (i.e., 
). The alternate hypothesis is that there is a
linear relationship (i.e., 
). If the null hypothesis can be rejected, then we have proven that
a linear relationship does exist, so X is helpful in predicting Y. The F distribution is used for test-
ing this hypothesis. Appendix D contains values for the F distribution which can be used when
calculations are performed by hand. See Chapter 2 for a review of the F distribution. The results
of the test can also be obtained from both Excel and QM for Windows.

126
CHAPTER 4 • REGRESSION MODELS
If the significance level for the F
test is low, there is a relationship
between X and Y.
The F statistic used in the hypothesis test is based on the MSE (seen in the previous sec-
tion) and the mean squared regression (MSR). The MSR is calculated as
(4-14)
where
The F statistic is
(4-15)
Based on the assumptions regarding the errors in a regression model, this calculated F statistic
is described by the F distribution with
where
If there is very little error, the denominator (MSE) of the F statistic is very small relative
to the numerator (MSR), and the resulting F statistic would be large. This would be an indi-
cation that the model is useful. A significance level related to the value of the F statistic is
then found. Whenever the F value is large, the significance level (p-value) will be low, indi-
cating that it is extremely unlikely that this could have occurred by chance. When the F value
is large (with a resulting small significance level), we can reject the null hypothesis that there
is no linear relationship. This means that there is a linear relationship and the values of MSE
and 
are meaningful.
The hypothesis test just described is summarized here:
Steps in Hypothesis Test for a Significant Regression Model
1. Specify null and alternative hypotheses:
2. Select the level of significance (). Common values are 0.01 and 0.05.
3. Calculate the value of the test statistic using the formula
4. Make a decision using one of the following methods:
(a) Reject the null hypothesis if the test statistic is greater than the F value from the table
in Appendix D. Otherwise, do not reject the null hypothesis:
(b) Reject the null hypothesis if the observed significance level, or p-value, is less than
the level of significance (). Otherwise, do not reject the null hypothesis:

found in Appendix D. Figure 4.5 illustrates this:
Thus, there is sufficient data to conclude that there is a statistically significant relationship
between X and Y, so the model is helpful. The strength of this relationship is measured by
Thus, we can conclude that about 69% of the variability in sales (Y) is explained by
the regression model based on local payroll (X).

Multiple Regression Analysis
The multiple regression model is a practical extension of the model we just observed. It allows
us to build a model with several independent variables. The underlying model is

where

)
coefficient of the ith independent variable

To estimate the values of these coefficients, a sample is taken and the following equation is
developed:

Consider the case of Jenny Wilson Realty, a real estate company in Montgomery,
Alabama. Jenny Wilson, owner and broker for this company, wants to develop a model to
determine a suggested listing price for houses based on the size of the house and the age of the
house. She selects a sample of houses that have sold recently in a particular area, and she
records the selling price, the square footage of the house, the age of the house, and also the con-
dition (good, excellent, or mint) of each house as shown in Table 4.5. Initially Jenny plans to

Because this probability is less than 0.05 (α), we would reject the hypothesis of no linear rela-
tionship and conclude that there is a linear relationship between X and Y. Note in Figure 4.5 that

The mathematics of multiple regression becomes quite complex, so we leave formulas for

to regression textbooks.* Excel can be used to develop a multiple regression model
just as it was used for a simple linear regression model. When entering the data in Excel, it is
important that all of the independent variables are in adjoining columns to facilitate the input.
From the Data tab in Excel, select Data Analysis and then Regression, as shown earlier, in
Program 4.1A. This opens the regression window to allow the input, as shown in Program 4.2A.
Note that the X Range includes the data in two columns (B and C) because there are two inde-
pendent variables. The Excel output that Jenny Wilson obtains is shown in Program 4.2B, and it
provides the following equation:

regression model is evaluated. Both the p-value for the F test and 
can be interpreted the same
with multiple regression models as they are with simple linear regression models. However, as

Regression Example
To determine which of the independent variables in a multiple regression model is signifi-
cant, a significance test on the coefficient for each variable is performed. While statistics text-
books can provide the details of these tests, the results of these tests are automatically displayed
in the Excel output. The null hypothesis is that the coefficient is 
and the alternate
hypothesis is that it is not zero 
The test statistic is calculated in Excel, and the
p-value is given. If the p-value is lower than the level of significance (α), then the null hypothe-
sis is rejected and it can be concluded that the variable is significant.
Jenny Wilson Realty Example
In the Jenny Wilson Realty example in Program 4.2B, the overall model is statistically signifi-
cant and useful in predicting the selling price of the house because the p-value for the F test is
0.002. The 
value is 0.6719, so 67% of the variability in selling price for these houses can be
explained by the regression model. However, there were two independent variables in the
model—square footage and age. It is possible that one of these is significant and the other is not.
The F test simply indicates that the model as a whole is significant.

there is more than one independent variable, the hypothesis that is being tested with the F test is
that all the coefficients are equal to 0. If all these are 0, then none of the independent variables
in the model is helpful in predicting the dependent variable.

BINARY OR DUMMY VARIABLES

Two significance tests can be performed to determine if square footage or age (or both) are
significant. In Program 4.2B, the results of two hypothesis tests are provided. The first test for
variable 
(square footage) is
Using a 5% level of significance 
the null hypothesis is rejected because the p-value
for this is 0.0013. Thus, square footage is helpful in predicting the price of a house.
Similarly, the variable 
(age) is tested using the Excel output, and the p-value is 0.0039.
The null hypothesis is rejected because this is less than 0.05. Thus, age is also helpful in predict-
ing the price of a house.

Binary or Dummy Variables
All of the variables we have used in regression examples have been quantitative variables such
as sales figures, payroll numbers, square footage, and age. These have all been easily measura-
ble and have had numbers associated with them. There are many times when we believe a quali-
tative variable rather than a quantitative variable would be helpful in predicting the dependent
variable Y. For example, regression may be used to find a relationship between annual income
and certain characteristics of the employees. Years of experience at a particular job would be a
quantitative variable. However, information regarding whether or not a person has a college
degree might also be important. This would not be a measurable value or quantity, so a special
variable called a dummy variable (or a binary variable or an indicator variable) would be
used. A dummy variable is assigned a value of 1 if a particular condition is met (e.g., a person
has a college degree), and a value of 0 otherwise.
Return to the Jenny Wilson Realty example. Jenny believes that a better model can be de-
veloped if the condition of the property is included. To incorporate the condition of the house
into the model, Jenny looks at the information available (see Table 4.5), and sees that the three
categories are good condition, excellent condition, and mint condition. Since these are not quan-
titative variables, she must use dummy variables. These are defined as
Notice there is no separate variable for “good” condition. If 
and 
are both 0, then the house
cannot be in excellent or mint condition, so it must be in good condition. When using dummy
variables, the number of variables must be 1 less than the number of categories. In this problem,
there were three categories (good, excellent, and mint condition) so we must have two dummy
variables. If we had mistakenly used too many variables and the number of dummy variables
equaled the number of categories, then the mathematical computations could not be performed
or would not give reliable values.
These dummy variables will be used with the two previous variables (
—square footage,
and 
—age) to try to predict the selling prices of houses for Jenny Wilson. Programs 4.3A and
4.3B provide the Excel input and output for this new data, and this shows how the dummy vari-
ables were coded. The significance level for the F test is 0.00017, so this model is statistically
significant. The coefficient of determination 
is 0.898, so this is a much better model than
the previous one. The regression equation is

Model Building
In developing a good regression model, possible independent variables are identified and the
best ones are selected to be used in the model. The best model is a statistically significant model
with a high 
and few variables.
As more variables are added to a regression model, 
will usually increase, and it cannot
decrease. It is tempting to keep adding variables to a model to try to increase 
However, if too
many independent variables are included in the model, problems can arise. For this reason, the
adjusted
value is often used (rather than 
) to determine if an additional independent vari-
able is beneficial. The adjusted 
takes into account the number of independent variables in the
model, and it is possible for the adjusted 
to decrease. The formula for

(4-18)
Notice that as the number of variables (k) increases, 
will decrease. This causes
to increase, and consequently the adjusted 
will decrease unless the extra
variable in the model causes a significant decrease in the SSE. Thus, the reduction in error (and
SSE) must be sufficient to offset the change in k.
As a general rule of thumb, if the adjusted 
increases when a new variable is added to
the model, the variable should probably remain in the model. If the adjusted 
decreases
when a new variable is added, the variable should not remain in the model. Other factors
should also be considered when trying to build the model, but they are beyond the introduc-
tory level of this chapter.
STEPWISE REGRESSION While the process of model building may be tedious, there are many
statistical software packages that include stepwise regression procedures to do this. Stepwise
regression is an automated process to systematically add or delete independent variables from a
regression model. A forward stepwise procedure puts the most significant variable in the model
first and then adds the next variable that will improve the model the most, given that the first
variable is already in the model. Variables continue to be added in this fashion until all the vari-
ables are in the model or until any remaining variables do not significantly improve the model.
A backwards stepwise procedure begins with all independent variables in the model, and
one-by-one the least helpful variables are deleted. This continues until only significant variables
remain. Many variations of these stepwise models exist.
MULTICOLLINEARITY In the Jenny Wilson Realty example illustrated in Program 4.3B, we saw
an 
of about 0.90 and an adjusted 
of 0.85. While other variables such as the size of the lot,
the number of bedrooms, and the number of bathrooms might be related to the selling price of a
house, we may not want to include these in the model. It is likely that these variables would be
correlated with the square footage of the house (e.g., more bedrooms usually means a larger
house), which is already included in the model. Thus, the information provided by these addi-
tional variables might be duplication of information already in the model.
When an independent variable is correlated with one other independent variable, the vari-
ables are said to be collinear. If an independent variable is correlated with a combination of
other independent variables, the condition of multicollinearity exists. This can create problems
in interpreting the coefficients of the variables as several variables are providing duplicate infor-
mation. For example, if two independent variables were monthly salary expenses for a company
and annual salary expenses for a company, the information provided in one is also provided in
the other. Several sets of regression coefficients for these two variables would yield exactly the
same results. Thus, individual interpretation of these variables would be questionable, although
the model itself is still good for prediction purposes. When multicollinearity exists, the overall F
test is still valid, but the hypothesis tests related to the individual coefficients are not. A variable
may appear to be significant when it is insignificant, or a variable may appear to be insignificant
when it is significant.

4.11
Nonlinear Regression
The regression models we have seen are linear models. However, at times there exist nonlinear rela-
tionships between variables. Some simple variable transformations can be used to create an appar-
ently linear model from a nonlinear relationship. This allows us to use Excel and other linear
regression programs to perform the calculations. We will demonstrate this in the following example.
On every new automobile sold in the United States, the fuel efficiency (as measured by miles
per gallon of gasoline (MPG) of the automobile is prominently displayed on the window sticker.
The MPG is related to several factors, one of which is the weight of the automobile. Engineers at
Colonel Motors, in an attempt to improve fuel efficiency, have been asked to study the impact of
weight on MPG. They have decided that a regression model should be used to do this.
Transformations may be used to
turn a nonlinear model into a
linear model.

However, further examination of the graph in Figure 4.6A brings into question the use of a lin-
ear model. Perhaps a nonlinear relationship exists, and maybe the model should be modified to
account for this. A quadratic model is illustrated in Figure 4.6B. This model would be of the

If 
changes, then 
must change also. This is an example of a problem that exists when multi-
collinearity is present.
Other types of nonlinearities can be handled using a similar approach. A number of transfor-
mations exist that may help to develop a linear model from variables with nonlinear relationships.

Cautions and Pitfalls in Regression Analysis
This chapter has provided a brief introduction into regression analysis, one of the most widely
used quantitative techniques in business. However, some common errors are made with regres-
sion models, so caution should be observed when using this.
If the assumptions are not met, the statistical tests may not be valid. Any interval estimates
are also invalid, although the model can still be used for prediction purposes.
Correlation does not necessarily mean causation. Two variables (such as the price of auto-
mobiles and your annual salary) may be highly correlated to one another, but one is not causing
the other to change. They may both be changing due to other factors such as the economy in
general or the inflation rate.
If multicollinearity is present in a multiple regression model, the model is still good for pre-
diction, but interpretation of individual coefficients is questionable. The individual tests on the
regression coefficients are not valid.
Using a regression equation beyond the range of X is very questionable. A linear relation-
ship may exist within the range of values of X in the sample. What happens beyond this range is
unknown; the linear relationship may become nonlinear at some point. For example, there is
usually a linear relationship between advertising and sales within a limited range. As more
money is spent on advertising, sales tend to increase even if everything else is held constant.
However, at some point, increasing advertising expenditures will have less impact on sales
unless the company does other things to help, such as opening new markets or expanding the
product offerings. If advertising is increased and nothing else changes, the sales will probably
level off at some point.
Related to the limitation regarding the range of X is the interpretation of the intercept 
Since the lowest value for X in a sample is often much greater than 0, the intercept is a point on
the regression line beyond the range of X. Therefore, we should not be concerned if the t-test for
this coefficient is not significant as we should not be using the regression equation to predict a
value of Y when 
This intercept is merely used in defining the line that fits the sample
points the best.
Using the F test and concluding a linear regression model is helpful in predicting Y does not
mean that this is the best relationship. While this model may explain much of the variability in
Y, it is possible that a nonlinear relationship might explain even more. Similarly, if it is con-
cluded that no linear relationship exists, another type of relationship could exist.
A statistically significant relationship does not mean it has any practical value. With large
enough samples, it is possible to have a statistically significant relationship, but 
might be
0.01. This would normally be of little use to a manager. Similarly, a high 
could be found due
to random chance if the sample is small. The F test must also show significance to place any
value in r2.
r2
r2
X = 0.
1b02.
A high correlation does not mean
one variable is causing a change
in the other.
The regression equation should
not be used with values of X that
are below the lowest value of X
or above the highest value of X
found in the sample.
A significant F value may occur
even when the relationship is not
strong.
Summary
Regression analysis is an extremely valuable quantitative tool.
Using scatter diagrams helps to see relationships between vari-
ables. The F test is used to determine if the results can be con-
sidered useful. The coefficient of determination 
is used to
measure the proportion of variability in Y that is explained by
the regression model. The correlation coefficient measures the
relationship between two variables.
1r22
Multiple regression involves the use of more than one in-
dependent variable. Dummy variables (binary or indicator vari-
ables) are used with qualitative or categorical data. Nonlinear
models can be transformed into linear models.
We saw how to use Excel to develop regression models.
Interpretation of computer output was presented, and several
examples were provided.

tells us that for each 1 unit increase in X (or $100 in advertising), sales increase
by 1 unit (or $1,000). Also, 
indicating that about 81% of the variability in sales can be
explained by the regression model with advertising as the independent variable.

Use Excel with the data in Solved Problem 4-1 to find the regression model. What does the F test say
about this model?
Solution
Program 4.6 provides the Excel output for this problem. We see the equation is
The coefficient of determination 
is shown to be 0.8125. The significance level for the F test is
0.0366, which is less than 0.05. This indicates the model is statistically significant. Thus, there is suffi-
cient evidence in the data to conclude that the model is useful, and there is a relationship between X
(advertising) and Y (sales).

decided to take 20 weeks of data and compare the
two markets. The closing price for each index is
shown in the table below:

linear regression model. How does this compare
with each of the models in Problem 4-27?

4-30 A sample of nine public universities and nine private
universities was taken. The total cost for the year
(including room and board) and the median SAT
score (maximum total is 2400) at each school were
recorded. It was felt that schools with higher median
SAT scores would have a better reputation and
would charge more tuition as a result of that. The
data is in the table below. Use regression to help an-
swer the following questions based on this sample
data. Do schools with higher SAT scores charge
more in tuition and fees? Are private schools more
expensive than public schools when SAT scores are

believe these results are using information related
the regression models.
4-31 In 2008, the total payroll for the New York Yankees
was $209.1 million, while the total payroll for the
Tampa Bay Rays was about $43.8 million, or about
one-fifth that of the Yankees. Many people have sug-
gested that some teams are able to buy winning sea-
sons and championships by spending a lot of money
on the most talented players available. The table
below lists the payrolls (in millions of dollars) for all
14 Major League Baseball teams in the American
League as well as the total number of victories for
each in the 2008 season:

Develop a regression model to predict the total num-
ber of victories based on the payroll of a team. Based
on the results of the computer output, discuss how
accurate this model is. Use the model to predict the
number of victories for a team with a payroll of $79
million.
4-32 In 2009, the New York Yankees won 103 baseball
games during the regular season. The table on the next
page lists the number of victories (W), the earned-
run-average (ERA), and the batting average (AVG)
of each team in the American League. The ERA is
one measure of the effectiveness of the pitching staff,
and a lower number is better. The batting average
is one measure of effectiveness of the hitters, and a
higher number is better.
(a) Develop a regression model that could be used to
predict the number of victories based on the ERA.
(b) Develop a regression model that could be used to
predict the number of victories based on the bat-
ting average.

(c) Which of the two models is better for predicting
the number of victories?
(d) Develop a multiple regression model that in-
cludes both ERA and batting average. How does
this compare to the previous models?
4-33 The closing stock price for each of two stocks was
recorded over a 12-month period. The closing price
for the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) was
also recorded over this same time period. These val-
ues are shown in the following table:
(a) Develop a regression model to predict the price
of stock 1 based on the Dow Jones Industrial
Average.
(b) Develop a regression model to predict the price
of stock 2 based on the Dow Jones Industrial
Average.
(c) Which of the two stocks is most highly corre-
lated to the Dow Jones Industrial Average over
this time period?
Case Study
North–South Airline
In January 2008, Northern Airlines merged with Southeast
Airlines to create the fourth largest U.S. carrier. The new
North–South Airline inherited both an aging fleet of Boeing
727-300 aircraft and Stephen Ruth. Stephen was a tough for-
mer Secretary of the Navy who stepped in as new president and
chairman of the board.
Stephen’s first concern in creating a financially solid com-
pany was maintenance costs. It was commonly surmised in the
airline industry that maintenance costs rise with the age of the
aircraft. He quickly noticed that historically there had been a
significant difference in the reported B727-300 maintenance
costs (from ATA Form 41s) both in the airframe and engine ar-
eas between Northern Airlines and Southeast Airlines, with
Southeast having the newer fleet.
On February 12, 2008, Peg Jones, vice president for opera-
tions and maintenance, was called into Stephen’s office and
asked to study the issue. Specifically, Stephen wanted to know
whether the average fleet age was correlated to direct airframe
maintenance costs, and whether there was a relationship be-
tween average fleet age and direct engine maintenance costs.
Peg was to report back by February 26 with the answer, along
with quantitative and graphical descriptions of the relationship.
Peg’s first step was to have her staff construct the average
age of Northern and Southeast B727-300 fleets, by quarter,
since the introduction of that aircraft to service by each airline
in late 1993 and early 1994. The average age of each fleet was
calculated by first multiplying the total number of calendar days
each aircraft had been in service at the pertinent point in time by
the average daily utilization of the respective fleet to total fleet
hours flown. The total fleet hours flown was then divided by the
number of aircraft in service at that time, giving the age of the
“average” aircraft in the fleet.
The average utilization was found by taking the actual total
fleet hours flown on September 30, 2007, from Northern and
Southeast data, and dividing by the total days in service for all
aircraft at that time. The average utilization for Southeast was
8.3 hours per day, and the average utilization for Northern was
8.7 hours per day. Because the available cost data were calcu-
lated for each yearly period ending at the end of the first quar-
ter, average fleet age was calculated at the same points in time.

Appendix 4.1 Formulas for Regression Calculations
When performing regression calculations by hand, there are other formulas that can make the
task easier and are mathematically equivalent to the ones presented in the chapter. These, how-
ever, make it more difficult to see the logic behind the formulas and to understand what the re-
sults actually mean.
When using these formulas, it helps to set up a table with the columns shown in Table 4.7,
which has the Triple A Construction Company data that was used earlier in the chapter. The
sample size (n) is 6. The totals for all columns are shown, and the averages for X and Y are cal-
culated. Once this is done, we can use the following formulas for computations in a simple lin-
ear regression model (one independent variable). The simple linear regression equation is again
given as
Slope of regression equation:

Regression Models Using QM for Windows
The use of QM for Windows to develop a regression model is very easy. We will use the Triple
A Construction Company data to illustrate this. After starting QM for Windows, under Modules
we select Forecasting. To enter the problem we select New and specify Least Squares—Simple
and Multiple Regression, as illustrated in Program 4.7A. This opens the window shown in
Program 4.7B. We enter the number of observations, which is 6 in this example. There is only 1
independent (X) variable. When OK is clicked, a window opens and the data is input as shown
in Program 4.7C. After entering the data, click Solve, and the forecasting results are shown as in
Program 4.7D. The equation as well as other information is provided on this screen. Additional
output is available by clicking the Window option on the toolbar.
Recall that the MSE is an estimate of the error variance 
and the square root of this is
the standard error of the estimate. The formula presented in the chapter and used in Excel is
where n is the sample size and k is the number of independent variables. This is an unbiased es-
timate of 
In QM for Windows, the mean squared error is computed as

Appendix 4.3 Regression Analysis in Excel QM or Excel 2007
Excel QM
Perhaps the easiest way to do regression analysis in Excel (either 2007 or 2010) is to use Excel
QM, which is available on the companion website for this book. Once Excel QM has been
installed as an add-in to Excel (see Appendix F at the end of the book for instructions on doing
this), go to the Add-Ins tab and click Excel QM, as shown in Program 4.8A. When the menu
appears, point the cursor at Forecasting, and the options will appear. Click on Multiple Regres-
sion, as shown in Program 4.8A, for either simple or multiple regression models.
A window will open, as shown in Program 4.8B. Enter the number of past observations and
the number of independent (X) variables. You can also enter a name or title for the problem. To
enter the data for the Triple A Construction example in this chapter, enter 6 for the past periods
(observations) and 1 for the number of independent variables. This will initialize the size of the
spreadsheet, and the spreadsheet will appear as presented in Program 4.8C.
The shaded area under Y and x 1 will be empty, but the data are entered in this shaded area,
and the calculations are automatically performed. In Program 4.8C, the intercept is 2 (the coeffi-
cient in the Y column) and the slope is 1.25 (the coefficient in the x 1 column), resulting in the
regression equation
which is the equation found earlier in this chapter.
Excel 2007
When doing regression in Excel (without the Excel QM add-in), the Data Analysis add-in is
used in both Excel 2010 and Excel 2007. The steps and illustrations for Excel 2010 provided
earlier in this chapter also apply to Excel 2007. However, the procedure to enable or activate this
or any other Excel add-in varies, depending on which of the two versions of Excel is being used.
See Appendix F at the end of this book for instructions for both Excel 2007 and Excel 2010.

Introduction
Every day, managers make decisions without knowing what will happen in the future. Inventory
is ordered though no one knows what sales will be, new equipment is purchased though no one
knows the demand for products, and investments are made though no one knows what profits
will be. Managers are always trying to reduce this uncertainty and to make better estimates of
what will happen in the future. Accomplishing this is the main purpose of forecasting.
There are many ways to forecast the future. In numerous firms (especially smaller ones),
the entire process is subjective, involving seat-of-the-pants methods, intuition, and years of ex-
perience. There are also many quantitative forecasting models, such as moving averages, expo-
nential smoothing, trend projections, and least squares regression analysis.
The following steps can help in the development of a forecasting system. While steps 5 and
6 may not be as relevant if a qualitative model is selected in step 4, data are certainly necessary
for the quantitative forecasting models presented in this chapter.
Eight Steps to Forecasting
1. Determine the use of the forecast—what objective are we trying to obtain?
2. Select the items or quantities that are to be forecasted.
3. Determine the time horizon of the forecast—is it 1 to 30 days (short term), 1 month to
1 year (medium term), or more than 1 year (long term)?
4. Select the forecasting model or models.
5. Gather the data or information needed to make the forecast.
6. Validate the forecasting model.
7. Make the forecast.
8. Implement the results.
These steps present a systematic way of initiating, designing, and implementing a forecast-
ing system. When the forecasting system is to be used to generate forecasts regularly over time,
data must be collected routinely, and the actual computations or procedures used to make the
forecast can be done automatically.
There is seldom a single superior forecasting method. One organization may find regression
effective, another firm may use several approaches, and a third may combine both quantitative
and subjective techniques. Whatever tool works best for a firm is the one that should be used.
No single method is superior.
Whatever works best should be
used.
5.2
Types of Forecasts
In this chapter we consider forecasting models that can be classified into one of three categories:
time-series models, causal models, and qualitative models (see Figure 5.1).
Time-Series Models
Time-series models attempt to predict the future by using historical data. These models make
the assumption that what happens in the future is a function of what has happened in the past. In
other words, time-series models look at what has happened over a period of time and use a se-
ries of past data to make a forecast. Thus, if we are forecasting weekly sales for lawn mowers,
we use the past weekly sales for lawn mowers in making the forecast.
The time-series models we examine in this chapter are moving average, exponential smooth-
ing, trend projections, and decomposition. Regression analysis can be used in trend projections and
in one type of decomposition model. The primary emphasis of this chapter is time series forecasting.
Causal Models
Causal models incorporate the variables or factors that might influence the quantity being fore-
casted into the forecasting model. For example, daily sales of a cola drink might depend on the
season, the average temperature, the average humidity, whether it is a weekend or a weekday,
and so on. Thus, a causal model would attempt to include factors for temperature, humidity,
season, day of the week, and so on. Causal models may also include past sales data as time-
series models do, but they include other factors as well.

TYPES OF FORECASTS
155
Our job as quantitative analysts is to develop the best statistical relationship between sales
or the variable being forecast and the set of independent variables. The most common quantita-
tive causal model is regression analysis, which was presented in Chapter 4. The examples in
Sections 4.8 and 4.9 illustrate how a regression model can be used in forecasting. Specifically,
they demonstrate how to predict the selling price of a house based on characteristics such as
size, age, and condition of the house. Other causal models do exist, and many of them are based
on regression analysis.
Qualitative Models
Whereas time-series and causal models rely on quantitative data, qualitative models attempt to
incorporate judgmental or subjective factors into the forecasting model. Opinions by experts, in-
dividual experiences and judgments, and other subjective factors may be considered. Qualitative
models are especially useful when subjective factors are expected to be very important or when
accurate quantitative data are difficult to obtain.
Here is a brief overview of four different qualitative forecasting techniques:
1. Delphi method. This iterative group process allows experts, who may be located in differ-
ent places, to make forecasts. There are three different types of participants in the Delphi
process: decision makers, staff personnel, and respondents. The decision making group
usually consists of 5 to 10 experts who will be making the actual forecast. The staff person-
nel assist the decision makers by preparing, distributing, collecting, and summarizing a
series of questionnaires and survey results. The respondents are a group of people whose
judgments are valued and are being sought. This group provides inputs to the decision
makers before the forecast is made.
In the Delphi method, when the results of the first questionnaire are obtained, the
results are summarized and the questionnaire is modified. Both the summary of the results
and the new questionnaire are then sent to the same respondents for a new round of
responses. The respondents, upon seeing the results from the first questionnaire, may view
things differently and may modify their original responses. This process is repeated with
the hope that a consensus is reached.
2. Jury of executive opinion. This method takes the opinions of a small group of high-level man-
agers, often in combination with statistical models, and results in a group estimate of demand.
3. Sales force composite. In this approach, each salesperson estimates what sales will be in
his or her region; these forecasts are reviewed to ensure that they are realistic and are then
combined at the district and national levels to reach an overall forecast.
4. Consumer market survey. This method solicits input from customers or potential customers
regarding their future purchasing plans. It can help not only in preparing a forecast but also
in improving product design and planning for new products.

judgmental approaches: Delphi,

Scatter Diagrams and Time Series
As with regression models, scatter diagrams are very helpful when forecasting time series. A scat-
ter diagram for a time series may be plotted on a two-dimensional graph with the horizontal axis
representing the time period. The variable to be forecast (such as sales) is placed on the vertical axis.
Let us consider the example of a firm that needs to forecast sales for three different products.
Wacker Distributors notes that annual sales for three of its products—television sets,
radios, and compact disc players—over the past 10 years are as shown in Table 5.1. One sim-
ple way to examine these historical data, and perhaps to use them to establish a forecast, is to
draw a scatter diagram for each product (Figure 5.2). This picture, showing the relationship be-
tween sales of a product and time, is useful in spotting trends or cycles. An exact mathematical
model that describes the situation can then be developed if it appears reasonable to do so.
A scatter diagram helps obtain
ideas about a relationship.
Hurricane Landfall Location Forecasts and
the Mean Absolute Deviation
Scientists at the National Hurricane Center (NHC) of the Na-
tional Weather Service have the very difficult job of predicting
where the eye of a hurricane will hit land. Accurate forecasts are
extremely important to coastal businesses and residents who
need to prepare for a storm or perhaps even evacuate. They are
also important to local government officials, law enforcement
agencies, and other emergency responders who will provide help
once a storm has passed. Over the years, the NHC has tremen-
dously improved the forecast accuracy (measured by the mean
absolute deviation [MAD]) in predicting the actual landfall loca-
tion for hurricanes that originate in the Atlantic Ocean.
The NHC provides forecasts and periodic updates of where the
hurricane eye will hit land. Such landfall location predictions are
recorded when a hurricane is 72 hours, 48 hours, 36 hours, 24
hours, and 12 hours away from actually reaching land. Once the
hurricane has come ashore, these forecasts are compared to the
actual landfall location, and the error (in miles) is recorded.
At the end of the hurricane season, the errors for all the hurricanes
in that year are used to calculate the MAD for each type of fore-
cast (12 hours away, 24 hour away, etc.). The graph below shows
how the landfall location forecast has improved since 1989. Dur-
ing the early 1990s, the landfall forecast when the hurricane was
48 hours away had an MAD close to 200 miles; in 2009, this num-
ber was down to about 75 miles. Clearly, there has been vast
improvement in forecast accuracy, and this trend is continuing.

Sales appear to be constant over time.
This horizontal line could be described by
the equation
          Sales = 250
That is, no matter what year (1, 2, 3, and
so on) we insert into the equation, sales
will not change. A good estimate of future
sales (in year 11) is 250 televisions!
Sales appear to be increasing at a 
constant rate of 10 radios each year.
If the line is extended left to the vertical
axis, we see that sales would be 290
in year 0. The equation
          Sales = 290 + 10(Year )
best describes this relationship between
sales and time. A reasonable estimate
of radio sales in year 11 is 400,
in year 12, 410 radios.
This trend line may not be perfectly
accurate because of variation each
year. But CD sales do appear to
have been increasing over the past
10 years. If we had to forecast future
sales, we would probably pick a
larger figure each year.

Measures of Forecast Accuracy
We discuss several different forecasting models in this chapter. To see how well one model
works, or to compare that model with other models, the forecasted values are compared with the
actual or observed values. The forecast error (or deviation) is defined as follows:
One measure of accuracy is the mean absolute deviation (MAD). This is computed by tak-
ing the sum of the absolute values of the individual forecast errors and dividing by the numbers
of errors (n):
(5-1)
Consider the Wacker Distributors sales of CD players shown in Table 5.1. Suppose that in the
past, Wacker had forecast sales for each year to be the sales that were actually achieved in the
previous year. This is sometimes called a naïve model. Table 5.2 gives these forecasts as well as
the absolute value of the errors. In forecasting for the next time period (year 11), the forecast
would be 190. Notice that there is no error computed for year 1 since there was no forecast for
this year, and there is no error for year 11 since the actual value of this is not yet known. Thus,
the number of errors (n) is 9.
From this, we see the following:
This means that on the average, each forecast missed the actual value by 17.8 units.
Other measures of the accuracy of historical errors in forecasting are sometimes used
besides the MAD. One of the most common is the mean squared error (MSE), which is the
average of the squared errors:*
(5-2)
MSE = a1error22
n
MAD = a ƒ forecast errorƒ
n
= 160
9
= 17.8
MAD = g ƒ forecast errorƒ
n
Forecast error = Actual value - Forecast value
The naïve forecast for the next
period is the actual value
observed in the current period.
*In regression analysis, the MSE formula is usually adjusted to provide an unbiased estimator of the error variance.
Throughout this chapter, we will use the formula provided here.

Defining the Problem
To drive production at each of Tupperware’s 15 plants in the United States, Latin America, Africa, Europe,
and Asia, the firm needs accurate forecasts of demand for its products.
Developing a Model
A variety of statistical models are used, including moving averages, exponential smoothing, and regression
analysis. Qualitative analysis is also employed in the process.
Acquiring Input Data
At world headquarters in Orlando, Florida, huge databases are maintained that map the sales of each
product, the test market results of each new product (since 20% of the firm’s sales come from products
less than 2 years old), and where each product falls in its own life cycle.
Developing a Solution
Each of Tupperware’s 50 profit centers worldwide develops computerized monthly, quarterly, and 
12-month sales projections. These are aggregated by region and then globally.
Testing the Solution
Reviews of these forecasts take place in sales, marketing, finance, and production departments.
Analyzing the Results
Participating managers analyze forecasts with Tupperware’s version of a “jury of executive opinion.”
Implementing the Results
Forecasts are used to schedule materials, equipment, and personnel at each plant.

MEASURES OF FORECAST ACCURACY
159
Three common measures of error
are MAD, MSE, and MAPE.
Bias gives the average error and
may be positive or negative.
Besides the MAD and MSE, the mean absolute percent error (MAPE) is sometimes used.
The MAPE is the average of the absolute values of the errors expressed as percentages of the
actual values. This is computed as follows:
(5-3)
There is another common term associated with error in forecasting. Bias is the average er-
ror and tells whether the forecast tends to be too high or too low and by how much. Thus, bias
may be negative or positive. It is not a good measure of the actual size of the errors because the
negative errors can cancel out the positive errors.

Time-Series Forecasting Models
A time series is based on a sequence of evenly spaced (weekly, monthly, quarterly, and so on)
data points. Examples include weekly sales of HP personal computers, quarterly earnings re-
ports of Microsoft Corporation, daily shipments of Eveready batteries, and annual U.S. con-
sumer price indices. Forecasting time-series data implies that future values are predicted only
from past values of that variable (such as we saw in Table 5.1) and that other variables, no mat-
ter how potentially valuable, are ignored.
Components of a Time Series
Analyzing time series means breaking down past data into components and then projecting them
forward. A time series typically has four components:
1. Trend (T) is the gradual upward or downward movement of the data over time.
2. Seasonality (S) is a pattern of the demand fluctuation above or below the trend line that
repeats at regular intervals.
3. Cycles (C) are patterns in annual data that occur every several years. They are usually tied
into the business cycle.
4. Random variations (R) are “blips” in the data caused by chance and unusual situations;
they follow no discernible pattern.
Figure 5.3 shows a time series and its components.
There are two general forms of time-series models in statistics. The first is a multiplicative
model, which assumes that demand is the product of the four components. It is stated as follows:
An additive model adds the components together to provide an estimate. Multiple regres-
sion is often used to develop additive models. This additive relationship is stated as follows:
There are other models that may be a combination of these. For example, one of the components
(such as trend) might be additive while another (such as seasonality) could be multiplicative.
Understanding the components of a time series will help in selecting an appropriate fore-
casting technique to use. If all variations in a time series are due to random variations, with no
trend, seasonal, or cyclical component, some type of averaging or smoothing model would be
appropriate. The averaging techniques in this chapter are moving average, weighted moving
average, and exponential smoothing. These methods will smooth out the forecasts and not be
Demand = T + S + C + R
Demand = T * S * C * R
Four components of a time series
are trend, seasonality, cycles, and
random variations.

too heavily influenced by random variations. However, if there is a trend or seasonal pattern
present in the data, then a technique which incorporates that particular component into the fore-
cast should be used. Two such techniques are exponential smoothing with trend and trend pro-
jections. If there is a seasonal pattern present in the data, then a seasonal index may be
developed and used with any of the averaging methods. If both trend and seasonal components
are present, then a method such as the decomposition method should be used.
Moving Averages
Moving averages are useful if we can assume that market demands will stay fairly steady over
time. For example, a four-month moving average is found simply by summing the demand dur-
ing the past four months and dividing by 4. With each passing month, the most recent month’s
data are added to the sum of the previous three months’ data, and the earliest month is dropped.
This tends to smooth out short-term irregularities in the data series.
An n-period moving average forecast, which serves as an estimate of the next period’s
demand, is expressed as follows:
(5-4)
Mathematically, this is written as

WALLACE GARDEN SUPPLY EXAMPLE Storage shed sales at Wallace Garden Supply are shown
in the middle column of Table 5.3. A 3-month moving average is indicated on the right. The
forecast for the next January, using this technique, is 16. Were we simply asked to find a fore-
cast for next January, we would only have to make this one calculation. The other forecasts are
necessary only if we wish to compute the MAD or another measure of accuracy.
WEIGHTED MOVING AVERAGE A simple moving average gives the same weight 
to each
of the past observations being used to develop the forecast. On the other hand, a weighted
moving average allows different weights to be assigned to the previous observations. As the

CHAPTER 5 • FORECASTING
weighted moving average method typically assigns greater weight to more recent observations,
this forecast is more responsive to changes in the pattern of the data that occur. However, this is
also a potential drawback to this method because the heavier weight would also respond just as
quickly to random fluctuations.
A weighted moving average may be expressed as

Sum of the weights
The results of the Wallace Garden Supply weighted average forecast are shown in Table 5.4. In
this particular forecasting situation, you can see that weighting the latest month more heavily
provides a much more accurate projection, and calculating the MAD for each of these would
verify this.
Choosing the weights obviously has an important impact on the forecasts. One way to
choose weights is to try various combinations of weights, calculate the MAD for each, and
select the set of weights that results in the lowest MAD. Some forecasting software has an op-
tion to search for the best set of weights, and forecasts using these weights are then provided.
The best set of weights can also be found by using nonlinear programming, as will be seen in a
later chapter.
Some software packages require that the weights add to 1, and this would simplify Equa-
tion 5-7 because the denominator would be 1. Forcing the weights to sum to 1 is easily achieved
by dividing each of the weights by the sum of the weights. In the Wallace Garden Supply exam-
ple in Table 5.4, the weights are 3, 2, and 1, which add to 6. These weights could be revised to
the new weights 3/6, 2/6, and 1/6, which add to 1. Using these weights gives the same forecasts
shown in Table 5.4.
Both simple and weighted moving averages are effective in smoothing out sudden fluctua-
tions in the demand pattern in order to provide stable estimates. Moving averages do, however,
have two problems. First, increasing the size of n (the number of periods averaged) does smooth
out fluctuations better, but it makes the method less sensitive to real changes in the data should
they occur. Second, moving averages cannot pick up trends very well. Because they are aver-
ages, they will always stay within past levels and will not predict a change to either a higher or a
lower level.
USING EXCEL AND EXCEL QM IN FORECASTING Excel and spreadsheets in general are frequently
used in forecasting. Many forecasting techniques are supported by built-in Excel functions. You
can also use Excel QM’s forecasting module, which has several components. To access Excel
Moving averages have two
problems: the larger number of
periods may smooth out real
changes, and they don’t pick up

Exponential Smoothing
Exponential smoothing is a forecasting method that is easy to use and is handled efficiently by
computers. Although it is a type of moving average technique, it involves little record keeping
of past data. The basic exponential smoothing formula can be shown as follows:
New forecast
Last period’s forecast
(5-8)
where  is a weight (or smoothing constant) that has a value between 0 and 1, inclusive.
+ a1Last period’s actual demand - Last period’s forecast2

Equation 5-8 can also be written mathematically as
(5-9)
where
new forecast (for time period 
)

smoothing constant 
previous period’s actual demand
The concept here is not complex. The latest estimate of demand is equal to the old estimate
adjusted by a fraction of the error (last period’s actual demand minus the old estimate).
The smoothing constant, 
can be changed to give more weight to recent data when the
value is high or more weight to past data when it is low. For example, when 
it can be
shown mathematically that the new forecast is based almost entirely on demand in the past three
periods. When 
the forecast places little weight on any single period, even the most
recent, and it takes many periods (about 19) of historic values into account.*
For example, in January, a demand for 142 of a certain car model for February was pre-
dicted by a dealer. Actual February demand was 153 autos. Using a smoothing constant of
we can forecast the March demand using the exponential smoothing model. Substi-
tuting into the formula, we obtain
Thus, the demand forecast for the cars in March is 144.
Suppose that actual demand for the cars in March was 136. A forecast for the demand in
April, using the exponential smoothing model with a constant of 
can be made:
SELECTING THE SMOOTHING CONSTANT The exponential smoothing approach is easy to use
and has been applied successfully by banks, manufacturing companies, wholesalers, and
other organizations. The appropriate value of the smoothing constant, 
however, can make
the difference between an accurate forecast and an inaccurate forecast. In picking a value for
the smoothing constant, the objective is to obtain the most accurate forecast. Several values
of the smoothing constant may be tried, and the one with the lowest MAD could be selected.
This is analogous to how weights are selected for a weighted moving average forecast. Some
forecasting software will automatically select the best smoothing constant. QM for Windows
will display the MAD that would be obtained with values of 
ranging from 0 to 1 in incre-
ments of 0.01.
PORT OF BALTIMORE EXAMPLE Let us apply this concept with a trial-and-error testing of
two values of 
in an example. The port of Baltimore has unloaded large quantities of grain
from ships during the past eight quarters. The port’s operations manager wants to test the use
of exponential smoothing to see how well the technique works in predicting tonnage unloaded.
He assumes that the forecast of grain unloaded in the first quarter was 175 tons. Two values
of

*The term exponential smoothing is used because the weight of any one period’s demand in a forecast decreases expo-
nentially over time. See an advanced forecasting book for algebraic proof.

CHAPTER 5 • FORECASTING
To evaluate the accuracy of each smoothing constant, we can compute the absolute devia-
tions and MADs (see Table 5.6). Based on this analysis, a smoothing constant of 
is
preferred to 
because its MAD is smaller.
USING EXCEL QM FOR EXPONENTIAL SMOOTHING Program 5.2 illustrates how Excel QM han-
dles exponential smoothing with the port of Baltimore example.
EXPONENTIAL SMOOTHING WITH TREND ADJUSTMENT The averaging or smoothing forecast-
ing techniques are useful when a time series has only a random component, but these techniques
fail to respond to trends. If there is trend present in the data, a forecasting model that explicitly
incorporates this into the forecast should be used. One such technique is the exponential smooth-
ing with trend model. The idea is to develop an exponential smoothing forecast and then adjust
this for trend. Two smoothing constants, 
and 
are used in this model, and both of these val-
ues must be between 0 and 1. The level of the forecast is adjusted by multiplying the first
smoothing constant, 
by the most recent forecast error and adding it to the previous forecast.
The trend is adjusted by multiplying the second smoothing constant, 
by the most recent error
or excess amount in the trend. A higher value gives more weight to recent observations and thus
responds more quickly to changes in the patterns.
As with simple exponential smoothing, the first time a forecast is developed, a previous
forecast 
must be given or estimated. If none is available, often the initial forecast is as-

must be given or estimated. This is often
estimated using other past data, if available, or by using subjective means, or by calculating the
increase (or decrease) observed during the first few time periods of the data available. Without
such an estimate available, the trend is sometimes assumed to be 0 initially, although this may

Trend Projections
Another method for forecasting time series with trend is called trend projection. This technique
fits a trend line to a series of historical data points and then projects the line into the future for
medium- to long-range forecasts. There are several mathematical trend equations that can be

equation with time as the
independent variable.

The least squares regression method may be applied to find the coefficients that minimize
the sum of the squared errors, thereby also minimizing the mean squared error (MSE). Chapter 4
provides detailed explanation of least squares regression, and formulas to calculate the coeffi-
cients by hand are in Section 4.3. In this section, we will rely on Excel and Excel QM to per-
form the calculations.
MIDWESTERN MANUFACTURING COMPANY EXAMPLE Let us consider the case of Midwestern
Manufacturing Company. That firm’s demand for electrical generators over the period
2004–2010 was shown in Table 5.7. A trend line to predict demand (Y ) based on the time pe-
riod can be developed using a regression model. If we let 2004 be time period 1 
then
2005 is time period 2 
and so forth. The regression line can be developed using Excel
2010 (see Chapter 4 for details) by going to the Data tab and selecting Data Analysis—Regression
and entering the information as shown in Program 5.4A. The results are shown in Program 5.4B.

To project demand in 2011, we first denote the year 2011 in our new coding system as

Seasonal Variations
Time-series forecasting such as that in the example of Midwestern Manufacturing involves look-
ing at the trend of data over a series of time observations. Sometimes, however, recurring varia-
tions at certain seasons of the year make a seasonal adjustment in the trend line forecast

CHAPTER 5 • FORECASTING
necessary. Demand for coal and fuel oil, for example, usually peaks during cold winter months.
Demand for golf clubs or suntan lotion may be highest in summer. Analyzing data in monthly or
quarterly terms usually makes it easy to spot seasonal patterns. A seasonal index is often used in
multiplicative time series forecasting models to make an adjustment in the forecast when a sea-
sonal component exists. An alternative is to use an additive model such as a regression model
that will be introduced in a later section.
A seasonal index indicates how a particular season (e.g., month or quarter) compares with
an average season. When no trend is present, the index can be found by dividing the average
value for a particular season by the average of all the data. Thus, an index of 1 means the season
is average. For example, if the average sales in January were 120 and the average sales in all
months were 200, the seasonal index for January would be 
so January is be-
low average. The next example illustrates how to compute seasonal indices from historical data
and to use these in forecasting future values.
Monthly sales of one brand of telephone answering machine at Eichler Supplies are shown
in Table 5.9, for the two most recent years. The average demand in each month is computed, and
these values are divided by the overall average (94) to find the seasonal index for each month.
We then use the seasonal indices from Table 5.9 to adjust future forecasts. For example, suppose
we expected the third year’s annual demand for answering machines to be 1,200 units, which is
100 per month. We would not forecast each month to have a demand of 100, but we would ad-
just these based on the seasonal indices as follows:
120>200 = 0.60,
An average season has an index
of 1.

Centered moving averages are
used to compute seasonal indices
when there is trend.
Seasonal Variations with Trend
When both trend and seasonal components are present in a time series, a change from one month
to the next could be due to a trend, to a seasonal variation, or simply to random fluctuations. To
help with this problem, the seasonal indices should be computed using a centered moving
average (CMA) approach whenever trend is present. Using this approach prevents a variation
due to trend from being incorrectly interpreted as a variation due to the season. Consider the fol-
lowing example.
Quarterly sales figures for Turner Industries are shown in Table 5.10. Notice that there is a
definite trend as the total each year is increasing, and there is an increase for each quarter from
one year to the next as well. The seasonal component is obvious as there is a definite drop from
the fourth quarter of one year to the first quarter of the next. A similar pattern is observed in
comparing the third quarters to the fourth quarters immediately following.
If a seasonal index for quarter 1 were computed using the overall average, the index would
be too low and misleading, since this quarter has less trend than any of the others in the sample.
If the first quarter of year 1 were omitted and replaced by the first quarter of year 4 (if it were
available), the average for quarter 1 (and consequently the seasonal index for quarter 1) would
be considerably higher. To derive an accurate seasonal index, we should use a CMA.
Consider quarter 3 of year 1 for the Turner Industries example. The actual sales in that quar-
ter were 150. To determine the magnitude of the seasonal variation, we should compare this with
an average quarter centered at that time period. Thus, we should have a total of four quarters (1
year of data) with an equal number of quarters before and after quarter 3 so the trend is averaged
out. Thus, we need 1.5 quarters before quarter 3 and 1.5 quarters after it. To obtain the CMA,

we take quarters 2, 3, and 4 of year 1, plus one-half of quarter 1 for year 1 and one-half of quar-
ter 1 for year 2. The average will be
We compare the actual sales in this quarter to the CMA and we have the following seasonal
ratio:
Thus, sales in quarter 3 of year 1 are about 13.6% higher than an average quarter at this time.
All of the CMAs and the seasonal ratios are shown in Table 5.11.
Since there are two seasonal ratios for each quarter, we average these to get the seasonal
index. Thus,
The sum of these indices should be the number of seasons (4) since an average season should
have an index of 1. In this example, the sum is 4. If the sum were not 4, an adjustment would be
made. We would multiply each index by 4 and divide this by the sum of the indices.
Steps Used to Compute Seasonal Indices Based on CMAs
1. Compute a CMA for each observation (where possible).
2. Compute seasonal ratio = Observation/CMA for that observation.
3. Average seasonal ratios to get seasonal indices.
4. If seasonal indices do not add to the number of seasons, multiply each index by (Number
of seasons)/(Sum of the indices).
Figure 5.5 provides a scatterplot of the Turner Industries data and the CMAs. Notice that
the plot of the CMAs is much smoother than the original data. A definite trend is apparent in the
data.

The Decomposition Method of Forecasting with Trend 
and Seasonal Components
The process of isolating linear trend and seasonal factors to develop more accurate forecasts is
called decomposition. The first step is to compute seasonal indices for each season as we have
done with the Turner Industries data. Then, the data are deseasonalized by dividing each num-
ber by its seasonal index, as shown in Table 5.12.
A trend line is then found using the deseasonalized data. Using computer software with
this data, we have*
The trend equation is
where
This equation is used to develop the forecast based on trend, and the result is multiplied by
the appropriate seasonal index to make a seasonal adjustment. For the Turner Industries data,

CHAPTER 5 • FORECASTING
the forecast for the first quarter of year 4 (time period 
and seasonal index 
)
would be found as follows:
We multiply this by the seasonal index for quarter 1 and we get
Using this same procedure, we find the forecasts for quarters 2, 3, and 4 of the next year to
be 151.24, 180.66, and 171.95, respectively.
Steps to Develop a Forecast Using the Decomposition Method
1. Compute seasonal indices using CMAs.
2. Deseasonalize the data by dividing each number by its seasonal index.
3. Find the equation of a trend line using the deseasonalized data.
4. Forecast for future periods using the trend line.
5. Multiply the trend line forecast by the appropriate seasonal index.
Most forecasting software, including Excel QM and QM for Windows, includes the decomposi-
tion method as one of the available techniques. This will automatically compute the CMAs, de-
seasonalize the data, develop the trend line, make the forecast using the trend equation, and
adjust the final forecast for seasonality.
The following example provides another application of this process. The seasonal indices
and trend line have already been computed using the decomposition process.

tal days to reach the following equation:

ices, it ignored the seasonality that the administration knew to be present. Table 5.13 provides
seasonal indices based on the same 66 months. Such seasonal data, by the way, were found to be
typical of hospitals nationwide. Note that January, March, July, and August seem to exhibit

To correct the time-series extrapolation for seasonality, the hospital multiplied the monthly

Using this method, patient days were forecasted for January through June (periods 67 through
72) as 9,948, 9,236, 9,768, 9,678, 9,554, and 9,547. This study led to better forecasts as well as
to more accurate forecast budgets.
USING EXCEL QM FOR DECOMPOSITION In Excel QM, to access the decomposition procedure,
go to the Add-Ins tab and click Excel QM—Forecasting—Decomposition, and the initialization
window will open. Input the relevant information, as illustrated in Program 5.6A, and the
spreadsheet will be initialized for the size of problem specified. Enter the past periods of data,
as shown in Program 5.6B, and the results will appear.
USING QM FOR WINDOWS FOR DECOMPOSITION QM for Windows can also be used for the de-
composition method of forecasting. See Appendix 5.1 for details.
Using Regression with Trend and Seasonal Components
Multiple regression may be used to forecast with both trend and seasonal components present in
a time series. One independent variable is time, and other independent variables are dummy
variables to indicate the season. If we forecast quarterly data, there are four categories (quarters)
so we would use three dummy variables. The basic model is an additive decomposition model
and is expressed as follows:

Forecasting at Disney World
When the Disney chairman receives a daily report from his
main theme parks in Orlando, Florida, the report contains only
two numbers: the forecast of yesterday’s attendance at the parks
(Magic Kingdom, Epcot, Fort Wilderness, Hollywood Studios (for-
merly MGM Studios), Animal Kingdom, Typhoon Lagoon, and
Blizzard Beach) and the actual attendance. An error close to zero
(using MAPE as the measure) is expected. The chairman takes his
forecasts very seriously.
The forecasting team at Disney World doesn’t just do a daily
prediction, however, and the chairman is not its only customer. It
also provides daily, weekly, monthly, annual, and 5-year forecasts
to the labor management, maintenance, operations, finance, and
park scheduling departments. It uses judgmental models, econo-
metric models, moving average models, and regression analysis.
The team’s annual forecast of total volume, conducted in 1999
for the year 2000, resulted in a MAPE of 0.
With 20% of Disney World’s customers coming from out-
side the United States, its econometric model includes such
variables as consumer confidence and the gross domestic prod-
uct of seven countries. Disney also surveys one million people
each year to examine their future travel plans and their experi-
ences at the parks. This helps forecast not only attendance, but
behavior at each ride (how long people will wait and how
many times they will ride). Inputs to the monthly forecasting
model include airline specials, speeches by the chair of the Fed-
eral reserve, and Wall Street trends. Disney even monitors
3,000 school districts inside and outside the United States for
holiday/vacation schedules.

IN ACTION
5.6
Monitoring and Controlling Forecasts
After a forecast has been completed, it is important that it not be forgotten. No manager wants to
be reminded when his or her forecast is horribly inaccurate, but a firm needs to determine why the
actual demand (or whatever variable is being examined) differed significantly from that projected.*
*If the forecaster is accurate, he or she usually makes sure that everyone is aware of his or her talents. Very seldom does
one read articles in Fortune, Forbes, or the Wall Street Journal, however, about money managers who are consistently
off by 25% in their stock market forecasts.

*See G. W. Plossl and O. W. Wight. Production and Inventory Control. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall, 1967.
One way to monitor forecasts to ensure that they are performing well is to employ a
tracking signal. A tracking signal is a measurement of how well the forecast is predicting ac-
tual values. As forecasts are updated every week, month, or quarter, the newly available demand
data are compared to the forecast values.
The tracking signal is computed as the running sum of the forecast errors (RSFE)
divided by the mean absolute deviation:
(5-13)
where
as seen earlier in Equation 5-1.
Positive tracking signals indicate that demand is greater than the forecast. Negative signals
mean that demand is less than forecast. A good tracking signal—that is, one with a low RSFE—
has about as much positive error as it has negative error. In other words, small deviations are
okay, but the positive and negative deviations should balance so that the tracking signal centers
closely around zero.
When tracking signals are calculated, they are compared with predetermined control limits.
When a tracking signal exceeds an upper or lower limit, a signal is tripped. This means that there
is a problem with the forecasting method, and management may want to reevaluate the way it
forecasts demand. Figure 5.6 shows the graph of a tracking signal that is exceeding the range of
acceptable variation. If the model being used is exponential smoothing, perhaps the smoothing
constant needs to be readjusted.
How do firms decide what the upper and lower tracking limits should be? There is no
single answer, but they try to find reasonable values—in other words, limits not so low as
to be triggered with every small forecast error and not so high as to allow bad forecasts to
be regularly overlooked. George Plossl and Oliver Wight, two inventory control experts,
suggested using maximums of 
MADs for high-volume stock items and 
MADs for
lower-volume items.*
Other forecasters suggest slightly lower ranges. One MAD is equivalent to approximately
0.8 standard deviation, so that

can be computed. Kimball’s Bakery’s quarterly sales of croissants (in thousands), as well as

SUMMARY
181
Summary
Forecasts are a critical part of a manager’s function. Demand
forecasts drive the production, capacity, and scheduling sys-
tems in a firm and affect the financial, marketing, and person-
nel planning functions.
In this chapter we introduced three types of forecasting
models: time series, causal, and qualitative. Moving averages,
exponential smoothing, trend projection, and decomposition
time-series models were developed. Regression and multiple
regression models were recognized as causal models. Four
qualitative models were briefly discussed. In addition, we
explained the use of scatter diagrams and measures of forecast-
ing accuracy. In future chapters you will see the usefulness
of these techniques in determining values for the various
decision-making models.

Adaptive Smoothing
A lot of research has been published on the subject of adaptive forecasting. This refers to com-
puter monitoring of tracking signals and self-adjustment if a signal passes its preset limit. In
exponential smoothing, the 
and 
coefficients are first selected based on values that minimize
error forecasts and are then adjusted accordingly whenever the computer notes an errant track-
ing signal. This is called adaptive smoothing.

CHAPTER 5 • FORECASTING
As we learned in this chapter, no forecasting method is
perfect under all conditions. Even when management has
found a satisfactory approach, it must still monitor and control
its forecasts to make sure that errors do not get out of hand.
Forecasting can often be a very challenging but rewarding part
of managing.

CHAPTER 5 • FORECASTING
A three-month moving average forecast was devel-
oped in the section on moving averages in Table 5.3.
5-14 Using MAD, determine whether the forecast in
Problem 5-13 or the forecast in the section concern-
ing Wallace Garden Supply is more accurate.
5-15 Data collected on the yearly demand for 50-pound
bags of fertilizer at Wallace Garden Supply are
shown in the following table. Develop a 3-year mov-
ing average to forecast sales. Then estimate demand
again with a weighted moving average in which
sales in the most recent year are given a weight of 2
and sales in the other 2 years are each given a weight
of 1. Which method do you think is best?
The sales manager had predicted, before the busi-
ness started, that year 1’s sales would be 410 air con-
ditioners. Using exponential smoothing with a

Case Study
Forecasting Attendance at SWU Football Games
Southwestern University (SWU), a large state college in
Stephenville, Texas, 30 miles southwest of the Dallas/Fort
Worth metroplex, enrolls close to 20,000 students. In a typical
town–gown relationship, the school is a dominant force in the
small city, with more students during fall and spring than per-
manent residents.
A longtime football powerhouse, SWU is a member of the
Big Eleven conference and is usually in the top 20 in college
football rankings. To bolster its chances of reaching the elusive
and long-desired number-one ranking, in 2005 SWU hired the
legendary Bo Pitterno as its head coach. Although the number-
one ranking remained out of reach, attendance at the five Satur-
day home games each year increased. Prior to Pitterno’s arrival,
attendance generally averaged 25,000 to 29,000 per game. Sea-
son ticket sales bumped up by 10,000 just with the announce-
ment of the new coach’s arrival. Stephenville and SWU were
ready to move to the big time!
The immediate issue facing SWU, however, was not
NCAA ranking. It was capacity. The existing SWU stadium,
built in 1953, has seating for 54,000 fans. The following table
indicates attendance at each game for the past six years.
One of Pitterno’s demands upon joining SWU had been a
stadium expansion, or possibly even a new stadium. With atten-
dance increasing, SWU administrators began to face the issue
head-on. Pitterno had wanted dormitories solely for his athletes
in the stadium as an additional feature of any expansion.
SWU’s president, Dr. Marty Starr, decided it was time for
his vice president of development to forecast when the existing
stadium would “max out.” He also sought a revenue projection,
assuming an average ticket price of $20 in 2011 and a 5% in-
crease each year in future prices.
Discussion Questions
1. Develop a forecasting model, justify its selection over
other techniques, and project attendance through 2012.
2. What revenues are to be expected in 2011 and 2012?
3. Discuss the school’s options.

CHAPTER 5 • FORECASTING
Case Study
Forecasting Monthly Sales
For years The Glass Slipper restaurant has operated in a resort
community near a popular ski area of New Mexico. The restau-
rant is busiest during the first 3 months of the year, when the
ski slopes are crowded and tourists flock to the area.
When James and Deena Weltee built The Glass Slipper,
they had a vision of the ultimate dining experience. As the view
of surrounding mountains was breathtaking, a high priority was
placed on having large windows and providing a spectacular
view from anywhere inside the restaurant. Special attention was
also given to the lighting, colors, and overall ambiance, result-
ing in a truly magnificent experience for all who came to enjoy
gourmet dining. Since its opening, The Glass Slipper has devel-
oped and maintained a reputation as one of the “must visit”
places in that region of New Mexico.
While James loves to ski and truly appreciates the moun-
tains and all that they have to offer, he also shares Deena’s
dream of retiring to a tropical paradise and enjoying a more
relaxed lifestyle on the beach. After some careful analysis of
their financial condition, they knew that retirement was many
years away. Nevertheless, they were hatching a plan to bring
them closer to their dream. They decided to sell The Glass
Slipper and open a bed and breakfast on a beautiful beach in
Mexico. While this would mean that work was still in their
future, they could wake up in the morning to the sight of the
palm trees blowing in the wind and the waves lapping at the
shore. They also knew that hiring the right manager would al-
low James and Deena the time to begin a semi-retirement in a
corner of paradise.
To make this happen, James and Deena would have to sell
The Glass Slipper for the right price. The price of the business
would be based on the value of the property and equipment, as
well as projections of future income. A forecast of sales for the
next year is needed to help in the determination of the value of
the restaurant. Monthly sales for each of the past 3 years are
provided in Table 5.14.
Discussion Questions
1. Prepare a graph of the data. On this same graph, plot a
12-month moving average forecast. Discuss any apparent
trend and seasonal patterns.
2. Use regression to develop a trend line that could be used
to forecast monthly sales for the next year. Is the slope of
this line consistent with what you observed in question 1?
If not, discuss a possible explanation.
3. Use the multiplicative decomposition model on these
data. Use this model to forecast sales for each month of
the next year. Discuss why the slope of the trend equation

Appendix 5.1 Forecasting with QM for Windows
In this section, we look at our other forecasting software package, QM for Windows. QM for
Windows can project moving averages (both simple and weighted), do simple and trend-
adjusted exponential smoothing, handle least squares trend projection, solve regression prob-
lems, and use the decomposition method.
To develop forecasts in QM for Windows, select Module on the toolbar and select Forecasting.
Then either click the new document icon or click File—New—Time Series Analysis to enter a new
time series problem. Specify the number of past observations and enter a title, if desired.
To illustrate QM for Windows, we will use the Port of Baltimore data from Table 5.5. The
number of past observations was eight in that example. When you enter those data, the screen
shown in Program 5.8A opens and allows for data input. Once the data is entered, click the

Notice that additional output, including detailed results of the procedure and a graph, are
available from the Window option in the toolbar once the problem has been solved. With expo-
nential smoothing, one output is called Errors as a function of alpha. This will display the MAD

For another example, we will use the decomposition method on the Turner Industries exam-
ple from Table 5.10. Enter a time-series problem with 12 past periods of data and select
Multiplicative Decomposition under Method. When this is done, additional input is needed, so
indicate that there are four seasons, select Centered Moving Average as the basis for smoothing,
and specify that the seasonal factors should not be rescaled, as shown in Program 5.9. This out-
put screen provides both the unadjusted forecasts found using the trend equation on the desea-
sonalized data and the final or adjusted forecasts, which are found by multiplying the unadjusted
forecast by the seasonal factor or index. Additional details can be seen by selecting Details and

Inventory Planning 
and Control
Inventory is one of the most expensive and important assets to many companies, representing
as much as 50% of total invested capital. Managers have long recognized that good inventory
control is crucial. On one hand, a firm can try to reduce costs by reducing on-hand inventory
levels. On the other hand, customers become dissatisfied when frequent inventory outages,
called stockouts, occur. Thus, companies must make the balance between low and high inven-
tory levels. As you would expect, cost minimization is the major factor in obtaining this
delicate balance.
Inventory is any stored resource that is used to satisfy a current or a future need. Raw mate-
rials, work-in-process, and finished goods are examples of inventory. Inventory levels for fin-
ished goods are a direct function of demand. When we determine the demand for completed
clothes dryers, for example, it is possible to use this information to determine how much sheet
metal, paint, electric motors, switches, and other raw materials and work-in-process are needed
to produce the finished product.
All organizations have some type of inventory planning and control system. A bank has
methods to control its inventory of cash. A hospital has methods to control blood supplies and
other important items. State and federal governments, schools, and virtually every manufactur-
ing and production organization are concerned with inventory planning and control. Studying
how organizations control their inventory is equivalent to studying how they achieve their
objectives by supplying goods and services to their customers. Inventory is the common thread
that ties all the functions and departments of the organization together.
Figure 6.1 illustrates the basic components of an inventory planning and control system. The
planning phase is concerned primarily with what inventory is to be stocked and how it is to be
acquired (whether it is to be manufactured or purchased). This information is then used in
forecasting demand for the inventory and in controlling inventory levels. The feedback loop in
Figure 6.1 provides a way of revising the plan and forecast based on experiences and observation.
Through inventory planning, an organization determines what goods and/or services are to
be produced. In cases of physical products, the organization must also determine whether to pro-
duce these goods or to purchase them from another manufacturer. When this has been deter-
mined, the next step is to forecast the demand. As discussed in Chapter 5, there are many
mathematical techniques that can be used in forecasting demand for a particular product. The
emphasis in this chapter is on inventory control, that is, how to maintain adequate inventory lev-
els within an organization.
196
CHAPTER 6 • INVENTORY CONTROL MODELS
Inventory is any stored resource
that is used to satisfy a current
or future need.
6.2
Importance of Inventory Control
Inventory control serves several important functions and adds a great deal of flexibility to the
operation of the firm. Consider the following five uses of inventory:
1. The decoupling function
2. Storing resources
3. Irregular supply and demand
4. Quantity discounts
5. Avoiding stockouts and shortages

6.3
INVENTORY DECISIONS
197
Inventory can act as a buffer.
Resources can be stored in work-
in-process.
Decoupling Function
One of the major functions of inventory is to decouple manufacturing processes within the
organization. If you did not store inventory, there could be many delays and inefficiencies. For
example, when one manufacturing activity has to be completed before a second activity can be
started, it could stop the entire process. If, however, you have some stored inventory between
processes, it could act as a buffer.
Storing Resources
Agricultural and seafood products often have definite seasons over which they can be harvested
or caught, but the demand for these products is somewhat constant during the year. In these and
similar cases, inventory can be used to store these resources.
In a manufacturing process, raw materials can be stored by themselves, in work-in-process,
or in the finished product. Thus, if your company makes lawn mowers, you might obtain lawn
mower tires from another manufacturer. If you have 400 finished lawn mowers and 300 tires in
inventory, you actually have 1,900 tires stored in inventory. Three hundred tires are stored by
themselves, and 1,600 (
tires per lawn mower 
 400 lawn mowers) tires are stored in
the finished lawn mowers. In the same sense, labor can be stored in inventory. If you have 500
subassemblies and it takes 50 hours of labor to produce each assembly, you actually have 25,000
labor hours stored in inventory in the subassemblies. In general, any resource, physical or other-
wise, can be stored in inventory.
Irregular Supply and Demand
When the supply or demand for an inventory item is irregular, storing certain amounts in inven-
tory can be important. If the greatest demand for Diet-Delight beverage is during the summer,
you will have to make sure that there is enough supply to meet this irregular demand. This might
require that you produce more of the soft drink in the winter than is actually needed to meet the
winter demand. The inventory levels of Diet-Delight will gradually build up over the winter, but
this inventory will be needed in the summer. The same is true for irregular supplies.
Quantity Discounts
Another use of inventory is to take advantage of quantity discounts. Many suppliers offer dis-
counts for large orders. For example, an electric jigsaw might normally cost $20 per unit. If you
order 300 or more saws in one order, your supplier may lower the cost to $18.75. Purchasing in
larger quantities can substantially reduce the cost of products. There are, however, some disad-
vantages of buying in larger quantities. You will have higher storage costs and higher costs due
to spoilage, damaged stock, theft, insurance, and so on. Furthermore, by investing in more in-
ventory, you will have less cash to invest elsewhere.
Avoiding Stockouts and Shortages
Another important function of inventory is to avoid shortages or stockouts. If you are repeatedly
out of stock, customers are likely to go elsewhere to satisfy their needs. Lost goodwill can be an
expensive price to pay for not having the right item at the right time.
1,600 = 4
6.3
Inventory Decisions
Even though there are literally millions of different types of products produced in our society,
there are only two fundamental decisions that you have to make when controlling inventory:
1. How much to order
2. When to order
The purpose of all inventory models and techniques is to determine rationally how much to
order and when to order. As you know, inventory fulfills many important functions within an
organization. But as the inventory levels go up to provide these functions, the cost of storing and

CHAPTER 6 • INVENTORY CONTROL MODELS
A major objective of all inventory
models is to minimize inventory
costs.
holding inventory also increases. Thus, you must reach a fine balance in establishing inventory
levels. A major objective in controlling inventory is to minimize total inventory costs. Some of
the most significant inventory costs follow:
1. Cost of the items (purchase cost or material cost)
2. Cost of ordering
3. Cost of carrying, or holding, inventory
4. Cost of stockouts
The most common factors associated with ordering costs and holding costs are shown in
Table 6.1. Notice that the ordering costs are generally independent of the size of the order, and
many of these involve personnel time. An ordering cost is incurred each time an order is placed,
whether the order is for 1 unit or 1,000 units. The time to process the paperwork, pay the bill,
and so forth does not depend on the number of units ordered.
Defining the Problem
In making products for different markets, manufacturing companies often produce basic products and
materials that can be used in a variety of end products. Hewlett-Packard, a leading manufacturer of print-
ers, wanted to explore ways of reducing material and inventory costs for its Deskjet line of printers. One
specific problem is that different power supplies are required in different countries.
Developing a Model
The inventory model investigates inventory and material requirements as they relate to different markets.
An inventory and materials flow diagram was developed that showed how each Deskjet printer was to be
manufactured for various countries requiring different power supplies.
Acquiring Input Data
The input data consisted of inventory requirements, costs, and product versions. A different Deskjet ver-
sion is needed for the U.S. market, European markets, and Far East markets. The data included estimated
demand in weeks of supply, replenishment lead times, and various cost data.
Developing a Solution
The solution resulted in tighter inventory control and a change in how the printer was manufactured. The
power supply was to be one of the last components installed in each Deskjet during the manufacturing
process.
Testing the Solution
Testing was done by selecting one of the markets and performing a number of tests over a two-month pe-
riod. The tests included material shortages, downtime profiles, service levels, and various inventory flows.
Analyzing the Results
The results revealed that an inventory cost savings of 18% could be achieved using the inventory model.
Implementing the Results
As a result of the inventory model, Hewlett-Packard decided to redesign how its Deskjet printers are man-
ufactured to reduce inventory costs in meeting a global market for its printers.

ECONOMIC ORDER QUANTITY: DETERMINING HOW MUCH TO ORDER
199
6.4
Economic Order Quantity: Determining How Much to Order
The economic order quantity (EOQ) is one of the oldest and most commonly known inven-
tory control techniques. Research on its use dates back to a 1915 publication by Ford W. Harris.
This technique is still used by a large number of organizations today. It is relatively easy to use,
but it does make a number of assumptions. Some of the most important assumptions follow:
1. Demand is known and constant.
2. The lead time—that is, the time between the placement of the order and the receipt of the
order—is known and constant.
3. The receipt of inventory is instantaneous. In other words, the inventory from an order
arrives in one batch, at one point in time.
4. The purchase  cost per unit  is  constant throughout the year. Quantity discounts are not
possible.
5. The only variable costs are the cost of placing an order, ordering cost, and the cost of
holding or storing inventory over time, holding or carrying cost. The holding cost per unit
per year and the ordering cost per order are constant throughout the year.
6. Orders are placed so that stockouts or shortages are avoided completely.
When these assumptions are not met, adjustments must be made to the EOQ model. These
are discussed later in this chapter.
With these assumptions, inventory usage has a sawtooth shape, as in Figure 6.2. In Figure 6.2,
Q represents the amount that is ordered. If this amount is 500 dresses, all 500 dresses arrive at one
time when an order is received. Thus, the inventory level jumps from 0 to 500 dresses. In general,
an inventory level increases from 0 to Q units when an order arrives.
Because demand is constant over time, inventory drops at a uniform rate over time. (Refer
to the sloped line in Figure 6.2.) Another order is placed such that when the inventory level
reaches 0, the new order is received and the inventory level again jumps to Q units, represented
by the vertical lines. This process continues indefinitely over time.

TABLE 6.1
Inventory Cost Factors
On the other hand, the holding cost varies as the size of the inventory varies. If 1,000 units
are placed into inventory, the taxes, insurance, cost of capital, and other holding costs will be
higher than if only 1 unit was put into inventory. Similarly, if the inventory level is low, there is
little chance of spoilage and obsolescence.
The cost of the items, or the purchase cost, is what is paid to acquire the inventory. The
stockout cost indicates the lost sales and goodwill (future sales) that result from not having the
items available for the customers. This is discussed later in the chapter.
The inventory usage curve has a
sawtooth shape.

Inventory Costs in the EOQ Situation
The objective of most inventory models is to minimize the total costs. With the assumptions just
given, the relevant costs are the ordering cost and the carrying, or holding cost. All other costs,
such as the cost of the inventory itself (the purchase cost), are constant. Thus, if we minimize
the sum of the ordering and carrying costs, we are also minimizing the total costs.
The annual ordering cost is simply the number of orders per year times the cost of placing
each order. Since the inventory level changes daily, it is appropriate to use the average inventory
level to determine annual holding or carrying cost. The annual carrying cost will equal the aver-
age inventory times the inventory carrying cost per unit per year. Again looking at Figure 6.2,
we see that the maximum inventory is the order quantity (Q), and the average inventory will be
one-half of that. Table 6.2 provides a numerical example to illustrate this. Notice that for this
situation, if the order quantity is 10, the average inventory will be 5, or one-half of Q. Thus:
(6-1)
Using the following variables, we can develop mathematical expressions for the annual ordering
and carrying costs:
 Ch = holding or carrying cost per unit per year
 Co = ordering cost of each order
 D = annual demand in units for the inventory item
 EOQ = Q* = optimal number of pieces to order
 Q = number of pieces of order
Average inventory level = Q
2
The objective of the simple EOQ
model is to minimize total
inventory cost. The relevant costs
are the ordering and holding
costs.
The average inventory level is
one-half the maximum level.
IN ACTION
Global Fashion Firm Fashions Inventory
Management System
Founded in 1975, the Spanish retailer Zara currently has more
than 1,600 stores worldwide, launches more than 10,000 new
designs each year, and is recognized as one of the world’s princi-
pal fashion retailers. Goods were shipped from two central ware-
houses to each of the stores, based on requests from individual
store managers. These local decisions inevitably led to inefficient
warehouse, shipping, and logistics operations when assessed on
a global scale. Recent production overruns, inefficient supply
chains, and an ever-changing marketplace (to say the least)
caused Zara to tackle this problem.
A variety of operations research models were used in
redesigning and implementing an entirely new inventory
management system. The new centralized decision-making
system replaced all store-level inventory decisions, thus pro-
viding results that were more globally optimal. Having the
right products in the right places at the right time for cus-
tomers has increased sales from 3% to 4% since implementa-
tion. This translated into an increase in revenue of over $230
million in 2007 and over $350 million in 2008. Talk about
fashionistas!

A graph of the holding cost, the ordering cost, and the total of these two is shown in Figure 6.3.
The lowest point on the total cost curves occurs where the ordering cost is equal to the carrying
cost. Thus, to minimize total costs given this situation, the order quantity should occur where
these two costs are equal.

CHAPTER 6 • INVENTORY CONTROL MODELS
Finding the EOQ
When the EOQ assumptions are met, total cost is minimized when:
Solving this for Q gives the optimal order quantity:
This optimal order quantity is often denoted by 
Thus, the economic order quantity is given
by the following formula:
This EOQ is the basis for many more advanced models, and some of these are discussed later in
this chapter.

Sumco Pump Company Example
Sumco, a company that sells pump housings to other manufacturers, would like to reduce its
inventory cost by determining the optimal number of pump housings to obtain per order. The
annual demand is 1,000 units, the ordering cost is $10 per order, and the average carrying cost
per unit per year is $0.50. Using these figures, if the EOQ assumptions are met, we can calculate
the optimal number of units per order:
The relevant total annual inventory cost is the sum of the ordering costs and the carrying costs:
In terms of the variables in the model, the total cost (TC) can now be expressed as

The total annual inventory cost
is equal to ordering plus holding
costs for the simple EOQ model.

ECONOMIC ORDER QUANTITY: DETERMINING HOW MUCH TO ORDER
203
The total annual inventory cost for Sumco is computed as follows:
The number of orders per year 
is 5, and the average inventory 
is 100.
As you might expect, the ordering cost is equal to the carrying cost. You may wish to try
different values for Q, such as 100 or 300 pumps. You will find that the minimum total cost
occurs when Q is 200 units. The EOQ, 
is 200 pumps.
USING EXCEL QM FOR BASIC EOQ INVENTORY PROBLEMS The Sumco Pump Company exam-
ple, and a variety of other inventory problems we address in this chapter, can be easily solved
using Excel QM. Program 6.1A shows the input data for Sumco and the Excel formulas
needed for the EOQ model. Program 6.1B contains the solution for this example, including
the optimal order quantity, maximum inventory level, average inventory level, and the number
of setups or orders.
Purchase Cost of Inventory Items
Sometimes the total inventory cost expression is written to include the actual cost of the mate-
rial purchased. With the EOQ assumptions, the purchase cost does not depend on the particular
order policy found to be optimal, because regardless of how many orders are placed each year,
we still incur the same annual purchase cost of 
where C is the purchase cost per unit
and D is the annual demand in units.*

Excel QM Solution for the Sumco Pump Company Example
It is useful to know how to calculate the average inventory level in dollar terms when the
price per unit is given. This can be done as follows. With the variable Q representing the quan-
tity of units ordered, and assuming a unit cost of C, we can determine the average dollar value
of inventory:
(6-6)
This formula is analogous to Equation 6-1.
Inventory carrying costs for many businesses and industries are also often expressed as an
annual percentage of the unit cost or price. When this is the case, a new variable is introduced.
Let I be the annual inventory holding charge as a percent of unit price or cost. Then the cost of
storing one unit of inventory for the year, 
is given by 
where C is the unit price or
cost of an inventory item.

REORDER POINT: DETERMINING WHEN TO ORDER
205
6.5
Reorder Point: Determining When to Order
Now that we have decided how much to order, we look at the second inventory question: when
to order. The time between the placing and receipt of an order, called the lead time or delivery
time, is often a few days or even a few weeks. Inventory must be available to meet the demand
during this time, and this inventory can either be on hand now or on order but not yet received.
The total of these is called the inventory position. Thus, the when to order decision is usually
expressed in terms of a reorder point (ROP), the inventory position at which an order should
be placed. The ROP is given as
(6-8)
Figure 6.4 has two graphs showing the ROP. One of these has a relatively small reorder point,
while the other has a relatively large reorder point. When the inventory position reaches the
ROP, a new order should be placed. While waiting for that order to arrive, the demand will be
met with either inventory currently on hand or with inventory that already has been ordered but
will arrive when the on-hand inventory falls to zero. Let’s look at an example.
PROCOMP’S COMPUTER CHIP EXAMPLE Procomp’s demand for computer chips is 8,000 per
year. The firm has a daily demand of 40 units, and the order quantity is 400 units. Delivery of an
order takes three working days. The reorder point for chips is calculated as follows:
Hence, when the inventory stock of chips drops to 120, an order should be placed. The order
will arrive three days later, just as the firm’s stock is depleted to 0. Since the order quantity is
400 units, the ROP is simply the on-hand inventory. This is the situation in the first graph in
Figure 6.4.
Suppose the lead time for Procomp Computer Chips was 12 days instead of 3 days. The re-
order point would be:
= 480 units
 ROP = 40 units per day * 12 days
= 120 units
 ROP = d * L = 40 units per day * 3 days
= d * L
ROP = 1Demand per day2 * 1Lead time for a new order in days2
The reorder point (ROP)
determines when to order
inventory. It is found by
multiplying the daily demand
times the lead time in days.
how the order quantity might change if different input values are used. Determining the effects
of these changes is called sensitivity analysis.
The EOQ formula is given as follows:
Because of the square root in the formula, any changes in the inputs 
will result in
relatively minor changes in the optimal order quantity. For example, if 
were to increase by a
factor of 4, the EOQ would only increase by a factor of 2. Consider the Sumco example just pre-
sented. The EOQ for this company is as follows:
If we increased 
from $10 to $40,

EOQ Without the Instantaneous Receipt Assumption
When a firm receives its inventory over a period of time, a new model is needed that does not
require the instantaneous inventory receipt assumption. This new model is applicable when
inventory continuously flows or builds up over a period of time after an order has been placed or
when units are produced and sold simultaneously. Under these circumstances, the daily demand
rate must be taken into account. Figure 6.5 shows inventory levels as a function of time. Because
this model is especially suited to the production environment, it is commonly called the
production run model.
In the production process, instead of having an ordering cost, there will be a setup cost. This
is the cost of setting up the production facility to manufacture the desired product. It normally
includes the salaries and wages of employees who are responsible for setting up the equipment,
engineering and design costs of making the setup, paperwork, supplies, utilities, and so on. The
carrying cost per unit is composed of the same factors as the traditional EOQ model, although
the annual carrying cost equation changes due to a change in average inventory.
The production run model
eliminates the instantaneous
receipt assumption.

The optimal production quantity can be derived by setting setup costs equal to holding
or carrying costs and solving for the order quantity. Let’s start by developing the expression
for carrying cost. You should note, however, that making setup cost equal to carrying cost
does not always guarantee optimal solutions for models more complex than the production
run model.
Annual Carrying Cost for Production Run Model
As with the EOQ model, the carrying costs of the production run model are based on the aver-
age inventory, and the average inventory is one-half the maximum inventory level. However,
since the replenishment of inventory occurs over a period of time and demand continues during
this time, the maximum inventory will be less than the order quantity Q. We can develop the
annual carrying, or holding, cost expression using the following variables:
The maximum inventory level is as follows:
Since
we know that
Since the average inventory is one-half of the maximum, we have

Annual Setup Cost or Annual Ordering Cost
When a product is produced over time, setup cost replaces ordering cost. Both of these are inde-
pendent of the size of the order and the size of the production run. This cost is simply the num-
ber of orders (or production runs) times the ordering cost (setup cost). Thus,

Determining the Optimal Production Quantity
When the assumptions of the production run model are met, costs are minimized when the setup
cost equals the holding cost. We can find the optimal quantity by setting these costs equal and
solving for Q. Thus,
Solving this for Q, we get the optimal production quantity

It should be noted that if the situation does not involve production but rather involves the receipt
of inventory over a period of time, this same model is appropriate, but

Brown Manufacturing Example
Brown Manufacturing produces commercial refrigeration units in batches. The firm’s estimated
demand for the year is 10,000 units. It costs about $100 to set up the manufacturing process, and
the carrying cost is about 50 cents per unit per year. When the production process has been
set up, 80 refrigeration units can be manufactured daily. The demand during the production
period has traditionally been 60 units each day. Brown operates its refrigeration unit production

the average number of production runs per year is 2.5. There will be 3 production runs in one

Quantity Discount Models
In developing the EOQ model, we assumed that quantity discounts were not available. However,
many companies do offer quantity discounts. If such a discount is possible, but all of the other
EOQ assumptions are met, it is possible to find the quantity that minimizes the total inventory
cost by using the EOQ model and making some adjustments.
Fortune 100 Firm Improves Inventory
Policy for Service Vehicles
Most manufacturers of home appliances provide in-home
repair of the appliances that are under warranty. One such For-
tune 100 firm had about 70,000 different parts that were used in
the repair of its appliances. The annual value of the parts inven-
tory was over $7 million. The company had more than 1,300 serv-
ice vehicles that were dispatched when service requests were
received. Due to limited space on these vehicles, only about 400
parts were typically carried on each one. If a service person
arrived to repair an appliance and did not have necessary part
(i.e., a stockout occured), a special order was made to have the
order delivered by air so that the repair person could return and
fix the appliance as soon as possible.
Deciding which parts to carry was a particularly  difficult
problem. A project was begun to find a better way to forecast the
demand for parts and identify which parts should be stocked on
each vehicle. Initially, the intent was to reduce the parts inventory
on each truck as this represented a significant cost of holding
the inventory. However, upon further analysis, it was decided that
the goal should be to minimize the overall cost—including the
costs of special deliveries of parts, revisiting the customer for
the repair if the part was not initially available, and overall cus-
tomer satisfaction.
The project team improved the forecasting system used to
project the number of parts needed on each vehicle. As a result,
the actual number of parts carried on each vehicle increased.
However, the number of first-visit repairs increased from 86% to
90%. This resulted in a savings of $3 million per year in the cost
of these repairs. It also improved customer satisfaction because
the problem was fixed without the service person having to
return a second time.

QUANTITY DISCOUNT MODELS
211
When quantity discounts are available, the purchase cost or material cost becomes a rele-
vant cost, as it changes based on the order quantity. The total relevant costs are as follows:
(6-14)
where
Since holding cost per unit per year is based on the cost of the items, it is convenient to express
this as
where
For a specific purchase cost (C), given the assumptions we have made, ordering the EOQ will
minimize total inventory costs. However, in the discount situation, this quantity may not be large
enough to qualify for the discount, so we must also consider ordering this minimum quantity for
the discount. A typical quantity discount schedule is shown in Table 6.3.
As can be seen in the table, the normal cost for the item is $5. When 1,000 to 1,999 units
are ordered at one time, the cost per unit drops to $4.80, and when the quantity ordered at one
time is 2,000 units or more, the cost is $4.75 per unit. As always, management must decide
when and how much to order. But with quantity discounts, how does the manager make these
decisions?
As with other inventory models discussed so far, the overall objective will be to minimize
the total cost. Because the unit cost for the third discount in Table 6.3 is lowest, you might be
tempted to order 2,000 units or more to take advantage of the lower material cost. Placing an
order for that quantity with the greatest discount cost, however, might not minimize the total
inventory cost. As the discount quantity goes up, the material cost goes down, but the carrying
cost increases because the orders are large. Thus, the major trade-off when considering quantity
discounts is between the reduced material cost and the increased carrying cost.
Figure 6.6 provides a graphical representation of the total cost for this situation. Notice the
cost curve drops considerably when the order quantity reaches the minimum for each discount.
With the specific costs in this example, we see that the EOQ for the second price category
is less than 1,000 units. Although the total cost for this EOQ is less than
the total cost for the EOQ with the cost in category 1, the EOQ is not large enough to obtain this
discount. Therefore, the lowest possible total cost for this discount price occurs at the minimum
quantity required to obtain the discount 
The process for determining the mini-
mum cost quantity in this situation is summarized in the following box.

Lucent Technologies Develops Inventory
Requirements Planning System
L ucent Technologies has developed an inventory requirements
planning (IRP) system to determine the amount of safety stock
(buffer stock) to carry for a variety of products. Instead of looking
only at the variability of demand during the lead time, the com-
pany looked at both the supply and demand of the products dur-
ing the lead time. The focus was on the deviations between the
forecast demand and the actual supply. This system was used
both for products with independent demand and for products
with dependent demand.
A modified ABC classification system was used to determine
which items received the most careful attention. Items were con-
sidered both for the dollar volume and the criticality. In addition
to the Class A, B, and C categories, a D category was created to
include items that were both low dollar volume and low critical-
ity. A simple two-bin system was used for these items.
In order to gain acceptance of the IRP system, business man-
agers from all functions were involved in the process, and the sys-
tem was made transparent so that everyone understood the
system. Because of the IRP system, overall inventory was reduced
by $55 million, and the service level was increased by 30%. The
success of the IRP system helped Lucent receive the Malcolm
Baldrige Award in 1992.

For orders between 1,000 and 1,999 units, the unit cost is $4.80, and for orders of 2,000 or more
units, the unit cost is $4.75. Furthermore, the ordering cost is $49 per order, the annual demand
is 5,000 race cars, and the inventory carrying charge as a percentage of cost, I, is 20% or 0.2.
What order quantity will minimize the total inventory cost?
The first step is to compute EOQ for every discount in Table 6.3. This is done as follows:
The second step is to adjust those quantities that are below the allowable discount range. Since
is between 0 and 999, it does not have to be adjusted. 
is below the allowable range
of 1,000 to 1,999, and therefore, it must be adjusted to 1,000 units. The same is true for 
it must be adjusted to 2,000 units. After this step, the following order quantities must be tested
in the total cost equation:
The third step is to use Equation 6-14 and compute a total cost for each of the order quantities.
This is accomplished with the aid of Table 6.4.
The fourth step is to select that order quantity with the lowest total cost. Looking at Table 6.4,
you can see that an order quantity of 1,000 toy race cars minimizes the total cost. It should be rec-
ognized, however, that the total cost for ordering 2,000 cars is only slightly greater than the total
cost for ordering 1,000 cars. Thus, if the third discount cost is lowered to $4.65, for example, this
order quantity might be the one that minimizes the total inventory cost.
USING EXCEL QM FOR QUANTITY DISCOUNT PROBLEMS As seen in the previous analysis, the
quantity discount model is more complex than the inventory models discussed so far in this
chapter. Fortunately, we can use the computer to simplify the calculations. Program 6.3A shows

Use of Safety Stock
When the EOQ assumptions are met, it is possible to schedule orders to arrive so that stockouts
are completely avoided. However, if the demand or the lead time is uncertain, the exact demand
during the lead time (which is the ROP in the EOQ situation) will not be known with certainty.
Therefore, to prevent stockouts, it is necessary to carry additional inventory called safety stock.
Safety stock helps in avoiding
stockouts. It is extra stock kept
on hand.

When demand is unusually high during the lead time, you dip into the safety stock instead
of encountering a stockout. Thus, the main purpose of safety stock is to avoid stockouts when
the demand is higher than expected. Its use is shown in Figure 6.7. Note that although stockouts
can often be avoided by using safety stock, there is still a chance that they may occur. The
demand may be so high that all the safety stock is used up, and thus there is still a stockout.
One of the best ways to implement a safety stock policy is to adjust the reorder point. In the
EOQ situation where the demand and lead time are constant, the reorder point is simply the

amount of inventory that would be used during the lead time (i.e., the daily demand times the
lead time in days). This is assumed to be known with certainty, so there is no need to place an
order when the inventory position is more than this. However, when the daily demand or the lead
time fluctuate and are uncertain, the exact amount of inventory that will be used during the
lead time is uncertain. The average inventory usage during the lead time should be computed
and some safety stock should be added to this to avoid stockouts. The reorder point becomes
(6-15)
where
How to determine the correct amount of safety stock is the only remaining question. Two im-
portant factors in this decision are the stockout cost and the holding cost. The stockout cost usu-
ally involves lost sales and lost goodwill, which results in loss of future sales. If holding cost is
low while stockout cost is high, a large amount of safety stock should be carried to avoid stock-
outs as it costs little to carry this, while stockouts are expensive. On the other hand, if stockout
cost is low but holding cost is high, a lower amount of safety stock would be preferred, as hav-
ing a stockout would cost very little, but too much safety stock will result in much higher annual
holding costs.

How is the optimum stock level determined? If demand fluctuates while lead time is con-
stant, and if both the stockout cost per unit and the holding cost per unit are known, the use of a
payoff/cost table might be considered. With only a small number of possible demand values dur-
ing the lead time, a cost table could be constructed in which the different possible demand levels
would be the states of nature, and the different amounts of safety stock as the alternatives. Using
the techniques discussed in Chapter 3, the expected cost could be calculated for each safety
stock level, and the minimum cost solution could be found.
However, a more general approach is to determine what service level is desired and then to
find the safety stock level that would accomplish this. A prudent manager will look at the hold-
ing cost and the stockout cost to help determine an appropriate service level. A service level
indicates what percentage of the time customer demand is met. In other words, the service level
is the percentage of time that stockouts are avoided. Thus,
or
Once the desired service level is established, the amount of safety stock to carry can be found
using the probability distribution of demand during the lead time.
SAFETY STOCK WITH THE NORMAL DISTRIBUTION Equation 6-15 provides the general formula
for determining the reorder point. When demand during the lead time is normally distributed,
the reorder point becomes
(6-16)
where
of standard deviations for a given service level
deviation of demand during the lead time
Thus, the amount of safety stock is simply 
The following example looks at how to de-
termine the appropriate safety stock level when demand during the lead time is normally distrib-
uted and the mean and standard deviation are known.
HINSDALE COMPANY EXAMPLE The Hinsdale Company carries a variety of electronic inventory
items, and these are typically identified by SKU. One particular item, SKU A3378, has a de-
mand that is normally distributed during the lead time, with a mean of 350 units and a standard
deviation of 10. Hinsdale wants to follow a policy that results in stockouts occurring only 5% of
the time on any order. How much safety stock should be maintained and what is the reorder
point? Figure 6.8 helps visualize this example.

From the normal distribution table (Appendix A) we have 
So the reorder point is 366.5, and the safety stock is 16.5 units.
CALCULATING LEAD TIME DEMAND AND STANDARD DEVIATION If the mean and standard devi-
ation of demand during the lead time are not known, they must be calculated from historical de-
mand and lead time data. Once these are found, Equation 6-16 can be used to find the safety
stock and reorder point. Throughout this section, we assume that lead time is in days, although
the same procedure can be applied to weeks, months, or any other time period. We will also as-
sume that if demand fluctuates, the distribution of demand each day is identical to and independ-
ent of demand on other days. If both daily demand and lead time fluctuate, they are assumed to
be independent also.
There are three situations to consider. In each of the following ROP formulas, the average
demand during the lead time is the first term and the safety stock 
is the second term.
1. Demand is variable but lead time is constant:
(6-17)
where
2. Demand is constant but lead time is variable:
(6-18)
where
3. Both demand and lead time are variable:
(6-19)
Notice that the third situation is the most general case and the others can be derived from that. If
either demand or lead time is constant, the standard deviation and variance for that would be 0,
and the average would just equal the constant amount. Thus, the formula for ROP in situation 3
can be simplified to the ROP formula given for that situation.
HINSDALE COMPANY EXAMPLE, CONTINUED Hinsdale has decided to determine the safety stock
and ROP for three other items: SKU F5402, SKU B7319, and SKU F9004.
For SKU F5402, the daily demand is normally distributed, with a mean of 15 units and a
standard deviation of 3. Lead time is exactly 4 days. Hinsdale wants to maintain a 97% service
level. What is the reorder point, and how much safety stock should be carried?
From Appendix A, for a 97% service level 
Since demand is variable but lead
time is constant, we find
So the average demand during the lead time is 60, and the safety stock is 11.28 units.
For SKU B7319, the daily demand is constant at 25 units per day, and the lead time is nor-
mally distributed, with a mean of 6 days and a standard deviation of 3. Hinsdale wants to main-
tain a 98% service level on this particular product. What is the reorder point?

CHAPTER 6 • INVENTORY CONTROL MODELS
A safety stock level is determined
for each service level.
From Appendix A, for a 98% service level 
Since demand is constant but lead
time is variable, we find
So the average demand during the lead time is 150, and the safety stock is 154.03 units.
For SKU F9004, the daily demand is normally distributed, with a mean of 20 units and a
standard deviation of 4, and the lead time is normally distributed, with a mean of 5 days and a
standard deviation of 2. Hinsdale wants to maintain a 94% service level on this particular prod-
uct. What is the reorder point?
From Appendix A, for a 94% service level, 
Since both demand and lead time are
variable, we find
So the average demand during the lead time is 100, and the safety stock is 63.53 units.
As the service level increases, the safety stock increases at an increasing rate. Table 6.5
illustrates how the safety stock level would change in the Hinsdale Company (SKU A3378)
example for changes in the service level. As the amount of safety stock increases, the annual
holding cost increases as well.
CALCULATING ANNUAL HOLDING COST WITH SAFETY STOCK When the EOQ assumptions of
constant demand and constant lead time are met, the average inventory is 
and the annual
holding cost is 
When safety stock is carried because demand fluctuates, the holding
cost for this safety stock is added to the holding cost of the regular inventory to get the total an-
nual holding cost. If demand during the lead time is normally distributed and safety stock is
used, the average inventory on the order quantity (Q) is still 
but the average amount of
safety stock carried is simply the amount of the safety stock (SS) and not one-half this amount.
Since demand during the lead time is normally distributed, there would be times when inventory
usage during the lead time exceeded the expected amount and some safety stock would be used.
But it is just as likely that the inventory usage during the lead time would be less than the

to all the safety stock. Thus, on the average, the company would always have this full amount of
safety stock in inventory, and a holding cost would apply to all of this. From this we have

where
In the Hinsdale example for SKU A3378, let’s assume that the holding cost is $2 per unit
per year. The amount of safety stock needed to achieve various service levels is shown in
Table 6.5. The holding cost for the safety stock would be these amounts times $2 per unit.
As illustrated in Figure 6.9, this holding cost would increase extremely rapidly once the serv-
ice level reached 98%.

Single-Period Inventory Models
So far, we have considered inventory decisions in which demand continues in the future, and
future orders will be placed for the same product. There are some products for which a decision
to meet the demand for a single time period is made, and items that do not sell during this time
period are of no value or have a greatly reduced value in the future. For example, a daily news-
paper is worthless after the next paper is available. Other examples include weekly magazines,

programs printed for athletic events, certain prepared foods that have a short life, and some sea-
sonal clothes that have greatly reduced value at the end of the season. This type of problem is
often called the news vendor problem or a single-period inventory model.
For example, a large restaurant might be able to stock from 20 to 100 cartons of doughnuts
to meet a demand that ranges from 20 to 100 cartons per day. While this could be modeled using
a payoff table (see Chapter 3), we would have to analyze 101 possible alternatives and states of
nature, which would be quite tedious. A simpler approach for this type of decision is to use mar-
ginal, or incremental, analysis.
A decision-making approach using marginal profit and marginal loss is called marginal
analysis. Marginal profit (MP) is the additional profit achieved if one additional unit is stocked
and sold. Marginal loss (ML) is the loss that occurs when an additional unit is stocked but can-
not be sold.
When there are a manageable number of alternatives and states of nature and we know the
probabilities for each state of nature, marginal analysis with discrete distributions can be used.
When there are a very large number of possible alternatives and states of nature and the proba-
bility distribution of the states of nature can be described with a normal distribution, marginal
analysis with the normal distribution are appropriate.
Marginal Analysis with Discrete Distributions
Finding inventory level with the lowest cost is not difficult when we follow the marginal analy-
sis procedure. This approach says that we would stock an additional unit only if the expected
marginal profit for that unit equals or exceeds the expected marginal loss. This relationship is
expressed symbolically as follows:
P = probability that demand will be greater than or equal to a given supply (or the probabil-
ity of selling at least one addition unit)
probability that demand will be less than supply (or the probability that one addi-
tion unit will not sell)
The expected marginal profit is found by multiplying the probability that a given unit will
be sold by the marginal profit, P(MP). Similarly, the expected marginal loss is the probability of
not selling the unit multiplied by the marginal loss, or 
The optimal decision rule is to stock the additional unit if
With some basic mathematical manipulations, we can determine the level of P for which
this relationship holds:
or
(6-21)
In other words, as long as the probability of selling one more unit (P) is greater than or
equal to 
we would stock the additional unit.
Steps of Marginal Analysis with Discrete Distributions
1. Determine the value of 
for the problem.
2. Construct a probability table and add a cumulative probability column.

CHAPTER 6 • INVENTORY CONTROL MODELS
Café du Donut Example
Café du Donut is a popular New Orleans dining spot on the edge of the French Quarter. Its spe-
cialty is coffee and doughnuts; it buys the doughnuts fresh daily from a large industrial bakery.
The café pays $4 for each carton (containing two dozen doughnuts) delivered each morning.
Any cartons not sold at the end of the day are thrown away, for they would not be fresh enough
to meet the café’s standards. If a carton of doughnuts is sold, the total revenue is $6. Hence, the
marginal profit per carton of doughnuts is
The marginal loss is 
since the doughnuts cannot be returned or salvaged at day’s end.
From past sales, the café’s manager estimates that the daily demand will follow the proba-
bility distribution shown in Table 6.6. The manager then follows three steps to find the optimal
number of cartons of doughnuts to order each day.
Step 1. Determine the value of 
for the decision rule
So the inventory stocking decision rule is to stock an additional unit if 
Step 2. Add a new column to the table to reflect the probability that doughnut sales will be at
each level or greater. This is shown in the right-hand column of Table 6.7. For example, the
probability that demand will be 4 cartons or greater is 
Similarly, the probability that sales will be 8 cartons or greater is
namely, the sum of probabilities for sales of 8, 9, or 10 cartons.
Step 3. Keep ordering additional cartons as long as the probability of selling at least one
additional carton is greater than P, which is the indifference probability. If Café du Donut orders
6 cartons, marginal profits will still be greater than marginal loss since
Marginal Analysis with the Normal Distribution
When product demand or sales follow a normal distribution, which is a common business
situation, marginal analysis with the normal distribution can be applied. First, we need to find
four values:
P at 6 cartons = 0.80 7 0.67
0.45 1= 0.25 + 0.10 + 0.102:

When P is greater than 0.50, the same basic procedure is used, although caution should be
used when looking up the Z value. Let’s say that Joe’s Newsstand also stocks the Chicago Sun-
Times, and its marginal loss is 40 cents and marginal profit is 10 cents. The daily sales have
averaged 100 copies of the Sun-Times, with a standard deviation of 10 papers. The optimal
stocking policy is as follows:
The normal curve is shown in Figure 6.11. Since the normal curve is symmetrical, we find

ABC ANALYSIS
225
6.10
ABC Analysis
Earlier, we showed how to develop inventory policies using quantitative techniques. There are
also some very practical considerations that should be incorporated into the implementation of
inventory decisions, such as ABC analysis.
The purpose of ABC analysis is to divide all of a company’s inventory items into three
groups (group A, group B, and group C) based on the overall inventory value of the items. A
prudent manager should spend more time managing those items representing the greatest dollar
inventory cost because this is where the greatest potential savings are. A brief description of
each group follows, with general guidelines as to how to categorize items.
The inventory items in the A group account for a major portion of the inventory costs of the
organization. As a result, their inventory levels must be monitored carefully. These items typi-
cally make up more than 70% of the company’s business in dollars, but may consist of only 10%
of all inventory items. In other words, a few inventory items are very costly to the company.
Thus, great care should be taken in forecasting the demand and developing good inventory man-
agement policies for this group of items (refer to Table 6.8). Since there are relatively few of
these, the time involved would not be excessive.
The items in the B group are typically moderately priced items and represent much less in-
vestment than the A items. Thus, it may not be appropriate to spend as much time developing
optimal inventory policies for this group as with the A group since these inventory costs are
much lower. Typically, the group B items represent about 20% of the company’s business in dol-
lars, and about 20% of the items in inventory.
The items in the C group are the very low-cost items that represent very little in terms of the
total dollars invested in inventory. These items may constitute only 10% of the company’s busi-
ness in dollars, but they may consist of 70% of the items in inventory. From a cost–benefit
perspective, it would not be good to spend as much time managing these items as the A and B
items.
For the group C items, the company should develop a very simple inventory policy, and this
may include a relatively large safety stock. Since the items cost very little, the holding cost asso-
ciated with a large safety stock will also be very low. More care should be taken in determining
the safety stock with the higher priced group B items. For the very expensive group A items, the
cost of carrying the inventory is so high, it is beneficial to carefully analyze the demand for these
so that safety stock is at an appropriate level. Otherwise, the company may have exceedingly
high holding costs for the group A items.
The optimal stocking policies in these two examples are intuitively consistent. When mar-
ginal profit is greater than marginal loss, we would expect 
to be greater than the average
demand, 
and when marginal profit is less than marginal loss, we would expect the optimal
stocking policy, 
to be less than .

Dependent Demand: The Case for Material Requirements Planning
In all the inventory models discussed earlier, we assume that the demand for one item is inde-
pendent of the demand for other items. For example, the demand for refrigerators is usually in-
dependent of the demand for toaster ovens. Many inventory problems, however, are interrelated;
the demand for one item is dependent on the demand for another item. Consider a manufacturer
of small power lawn mowers. The demand for lawn mower wheels and spark plugs is dependent
on the demand for lawn mowers. Four wheels and one spark plug are needed for each finished
lawn mower. Usually when the demand for different items is dependent, the relationship
between the items is known and constant. Thus, you should forecast the demand for the final
products and compute the requirements for component parts.
As with the inventory models discussed previously, the major questions that must be
answered are how much to order and when to order. But with dependent demand, inventory
scheduling and planning can be very complex indeed. In these situations, materials require-
ments palnning (MRP) can be employed effectively. Some of the benefits of MRP follow:
1. Increased customer service and satisfaction
2. Reduced inventory costs
3. Better inventory planning and scheduling
4. Higher total sales
5. Faster response to market changes and shifts
6. Reduced inventory levels without reduced customer service
Although most MRP systems are computerized, the analysis is straightforward and similar
from one computerized system to the next. Here is the typical procedure.
Material Structure Tree
We begin by developing a bill of materials (BOM). The BOM identifies the components,
their descriptions, and the number required in the production of one unit of the final product.
From the BOM, we develop a material structure tree. Let’s say that demand for product A is
50 units. Each unit of A requires 2 units of B and 3 units of C. Now, each unit of B requires
2 units of D and 3 units of E. Furthermore, each unit of C requires 1 unit of E and 2 units of F.
Thus, the demand for B, C, D, E, and F is completely dependent on the demand for A. Given
this information, a material structure tree can be developed for the related inventory items (see
Figure 6.12).
The structure tree has three levels: 0, 1, and 2. Items above any level are called parents,
and items below any level are called components. There are three parents: A, B, and C. Each
parent item has at least one level below it. Items B, C, D, E, and F are components because
each item has at least one level above it. In this structure tree, B and C are both parents and
components.

Note that the number in the parentheses in Figure 6.12 indicates how many units of that par-

2 units of B for every unit of A, and F(2) means that it takes 2 units of F for every unit of C.
After the material structure tree has been developed, the number of units of each item
required to satisfy demand can be determined. This information can be displayed as follows:
Part B:
Part C:
Part D:
Part E:
Part F:
Thus, for 50 units of A we need 100 units of B, 150 units of C, 200 units of D, 450 units of
E, and 300 units of F. Of course, the numbers in this table could have been determined directly
from the material structure tree by multiplying the numbers along the branches times the
demand for A, which is 50 units for this problem. For example, the number of units of D needed
is simply 
units.
Gross and Net Material Requirements Plan
Once the materials structure tree has been developed, we construct a gross material requirements
plan. This is a time schedule that shows when an item must be ordered from suppliers when there
is no inventory on hand, or when the production of an item must be started in order to satisfy the
demand for the finished product at a particular date. Let’s assume that all of the items are produced
or manufactured by the same company. It takes one week to make A, two weeks to make B, one
week to make C, one week to make D, two weeks to make E, and three weeks to make F. With this
information, the gross material requirements plan can be constructed to reveal the production
schedule needed to satisfy the demand of 50 units of A at a future date. (Refer to Figure 6.13.)
The interpretation of the material in Figure 6.13 is as follows: If you want 50 units of A at
week 6, you must start the manufacturing process in week 5. Thus, in week 5 you need 100 units
of B and 150 units of C. These two items take 2 weeks and 1 week to produce. (See the lead
2 * 2 * 50 = 200
2 * number of C’s = 2 * 150 = 300
3 * number of B’s + 1 * number of C’s = 3 * 100 + 1 * 150 = 450
2 * number of B’s = 2 * 100 = 200
3 * number of A’s = 3 * 50 = 150
2 * number of A’s = 2 * 50 = 100
The material structure tree
shows how many units are
needed at every level of
production.

times.) Production of B should be started in week 3, and C should be started in week 4. (See the
order release for these items.) Working backward, the same computations can be made for all
the other items. The material requirements plan graphically reveals when each item should be
started and completed in order to have 50 units of A at week 6. Now, a net requirements plan
can be developed given the on-hand inventory in Table 6.9; here is how it is done.
Using these data, we can develop a net material requirements plan that includes gross re-
quirements, on-hand inventory, net requirements, planned-order receipts, and planned-order re-
leases for each item. It is developed by beginning with A and working backward through the
other items. Figure 6.14 shows a net material requirements plan for product A.

DEPENDENT DEMAND: THE CASE FOR MATERIAL REQUIREMENTS PLANNING
229
AA
D(3)
F(2)
The net requirements plan is constructed like the gross requirements plan. Starting with
item A, we work backward determining net requirements for all items. These computations are
done by referring constantly to the structure tree and lead times. The gross requirements for A
are 50 units in week 6. Ten items are on hand, and thus the net requirements and planned-order
receipt are both 40 items in week 6. Because of the one-week lead time, the planned-order
release is 40 items in week 5. (See the arrow connecting the order receipt and order release.)
Look down column 5 and refer to the structure tree in Figure 6.13. Eighty 
items of B
and 
items of C are required in week 5 in order to have a total of 50 items of A in
week 6. The letter A in the upper-right corner for items B and C means that this demand for B
and C was generated as a result of the demand for the parent, A. Now the same type of analysis
is done for B and C to determine the net requirements for D, E, and F.
Two or More End Products
So far, we have considered only one end product. For most manufacturing companies, there are
normally two or more end products that use some of the same parts or components. All of the
end products must be incorporated into a single net material requirements plan.
In the MRP example just discussed, we developed a net material requirements plan for
product A. Now, we show how to modify the net material requirements plan when a second end
product is introduced. Let’s call the second end product AA. The material structure tree for
product AA is as follows:
120 = 3 * 40
12 * 402
Let’s assume that we need 10 units of AA. With this information we can compute the gross
requirements for AA:
Part D:
Part F:
To develop a net material requirements plan, we need to know the lead time for AA. Let’s
assume that it is one week. We also assume that we need 10 units of AA in week 6 and that we
have no units of AA on hand.
Now, we are in a position to modify the net material requirements plan for product A to in-
clude AA. This is done in Figure 6.15.
Look at the top row of the figure. As you can see, we have a gross requirement of 10 units
of AA in week 6. We don’t have any units of AA on hand, so the net requirement is also 10 units
of AA. Because it takes one week to make AA, the order release of 10 units of AA is in week 5.
This means that we start making AA in week 5 and have the finished units in week 6.
Because we start making AA in week 5, we must have 30 units of D and 20 units of F in
week 5. See the rows for D and F in Figure 6.15. The lead time for D is one week. Thus, we must
give the order release in week 4 to have the finished units of D in week 5. Note that there was no
inventory on hand for D in week 5. The original 10 units of inventory of D were used in week 5
to make B, which was subsequently used to make A. We also need to have 20 units of F in week
5 to produce 10 units of AA by week 6. Again, we have no on-hand inventory of F in week 5.
The original 5 units were used in week 4 to make C, which was subsequently used to make A.
The lead time for F is three weeks. Thus, the order release for 20 units of F must be in week 2.
(See the F row in Figure 6.15.)
This example shows how the inventory requirements of two products can be reflected in the
same net material requirements plan. Some manufacturing companies can have more than 100
end products that must be coordinated in the same net material requirements plan. Although
such a situation can be very complicated, the same principles we used in this example are
2 * number of AA’s = 2 * 10 = 20
3 * number of AA’s = 3 * 10 = 30

Just-in-Time Inventory Control
During the past two decades, there has been a trend to make the manufacturing process more ef-
ficient. One objective is to have less in-process inventory on hand. This is known as JIT inven-
tory. With this approach, inventory arrives just in time to be used during the manufacturing
process to produce subparts, assemblies, or finished goods. One technique of implementing JIT
is a manual procedure called kanban. Kanban in Japanese means “card.” With a dual-card
employed. Remember that computer programs have been developed to handle large and com-
plex manufacturing operations.
In addition to using MRP to handle end products and finished goods, MRP can also be used
to handle spare parts and components. This is important because most manufacturing compa-
nies sell spare parts and components for maintenance. A net material requirements plan should
also reflect these spare parts and components.

FIGURE 6.16
The Kanban System
kanban system, there is a conveyance kanban, or C-kanban, and a production kanban, or P-
kanban. The kanban system is very simple. Here is how it works:
Four Steps of Kanban
1. A user takes a container of parts or inventory along with its accompanying C-kanban to his
or her work area. When there are no more parts or the container is empty, the user returns
the empty container along with the C-kanban to the producer area.
2. At the producer area, there is a full container of parts along with a P-kanban. The user
detaches the P-kanban from the full container of parts. Then the user takes the full container
of parts along with the original C-kanban back to his or her area for immediate use.
3. The detached P-kanban goes back to the producer area along with the empty container. The
P-kanban is a signal that new parts are to be manufactured or that new parts are to be placed
into the container. When the container is filled, the P-kanban is attached to the container.
4. This process repeats itself during the typical workday. The dual-card kanban system is
shown in Figure 6.16.
As shown in Figure 6.16, full containers along with their C-kanban go from the storage area
to a user area, typically on a manufacturing line. During the production process, parts in the
container are used up. When the container is empty, the empty container along with the same
C-kanban goes back to the storage area. Here, the user picks up a new full container. The P-kanban
from the full container is removed and sent back to the production area along with the empty
container to be refilled.
At a minimum, two containers are required using the kanban system. One container is used
at the user area, and another container is being refilled for future use. In reality, there are usually
more than two containers. This is how inventory control is accomplished. Inventory managers
can introduce additional containers and their associated P-kanbans into the system. In a similar
fashion, the inventory manager can remove containers and the P-kanbans to have tighter control
over inventory buildups.
In addition to being a simple, easy-to-implement system, the kanban system can also be
very effective in controlling inventory costs and in uncovering production bottlenecks. Inven-
tory arrives at the user area or on the manufacturing line just when it is needed. Inventory does
not build up unnecessarily, cluttering the production line or adding to unnecessary inventory
expense. The kanban system reduces inventory levels and makes for a more effective operation.
It is like putting the production line on an inventory diet. Like any diet, the inventory diet im-
posed by the kanban system makes the production operation more streamlined. Furthermore,
production bottlenecks and problems can be uncovered. Many production managers remove
containers and their associated P-kanban from the kanban system in order to “starve” the pro-
duction line to uncover bottlenecks and potential problems.
In implementing a kanban system, a number of work rules or kanban rules are normally
implemented. One typical kanban rule is that no containers are filled without the appropriate
P-kanban. Another rule is that each container must hold exactly the specified number of parts or
inventory items. These and similar rules make the production process more efficient. Only those
parts that are actually needed are produced. The production department does not produce inven-
tory just to keep busy. It produces inventory or parts only when they are needed in the user area
or on an actual manufacturing line.

CHAPTER 6 • INVENTORY CONTROL MODELS
6.13
Enterprise Resource Planning
Over the years, MRP has evolved to include not only the materials required in production, but
also the labor hours, material cost, and other resources related to production. When approached
in this fashion, the term MRP II is often used, and the word resource replaces the word
requirements. As this concept evolved and sophisticated computer software programs were de-
veloped, these systems were called enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems.
The objective of an ERP system is to reduce costs by integrating all of the operations of a
firm. This starts with the supplier of the materials needed and flows through the organization to
include invoicing the customer of the final product. Data are entered once into a database, and
then these data can be quickly and easily accessed by anyone in the organization. This benefits
not only the functions related to planning and managing inventory, but also other business
processes such as accounting, finance, and human resources.
The benefits of a well-developed ERP system are reduced transaction costs and increased
speed and accuracy of information. However, there are drawbacks as well. The software is ex-
pensive to buy and costly to customize. The implementation of an ERP system may require a
company to change its normal operations, and employees are often resistant to change. Also,
training employees on the use of the new software can be expensive.
There are many ERP systems available. The most common ones are from the firms SAP,
Oracle, People Soft, Baan, and JD Edwards. Even small systems can cost hundreds of thousands
of dollars. The larger systems can cost hundreds of millions of dollars.
Summary
This chapter introduces the fundamentals of inventory control
theory. We show that the two most important problems are (1)
how much to order and (2) when to order.
We investigate the economic order quantity, which deter-
mines how much to order, and the reorder point, which deter-
mines when to order. In addition, we explore the use of
sensitivity analysis to determine what happens to computations
when one or more of the values used in one of the equations
changes.
The basic EOQ inventory model presented in this chapter
makes a number of assumptions: (1) known and constant de-
mand and lead times, (2) instantaneous receipt of inventory, (3)
no quantity discounts, (4) no stockouts or shortages, and (5) the
only variable costs are ordering costs and carrying costs. If
these assumptions are valid, the EOQ inventory model pro-
vides optimal solutions. On the other hand, if these assump-
tions do not hold, the basic EOQ model does not apply. In these
cases, more complex models are needed, including the produc-
tion run, quantity discount, and safety stock models. When the
inventory item is for use in a single time period, the marginal
analysis approach is used. ABC analysis is used to determine
which items represent the greatest potential inventory cost so
these items can be more carefully managed.
When the demand for inventory is not independent of the
demand for another product, a technique such as MRP is
needed. MRP can be used to determine the gross and net mate-
rial requirements for products. Computer software is necessary
to implement major inventory systems including MRP systems
successfully. Today, many companies are using ERP software
to integrate all of the operations within a firm, including inven-
tory, accounting, finance, and human resources.
JIT can lower inventory levels, reduce costs, and make a
manufacturing process more efficient. Kanban, a Japanese word
meaning “card,” is one way to implement the JIT approach.

Solved Problem 6-1
Patterson Electronics supplies microcomputer circuitry to a company that incorporates microprocessors
into refrigerators and other home appliances. One of the components has an annual demand of 250
units, and this is constant throughout the year. Carrying cost is estimated to be $1 per unit per year, and
the ordering cost is $20 per order.
a. To minimize cost, how many units should be ordered each time an order is placed?
b. How many orders per year are needed with the optimal policy?
c. What is the average inventory if costs are minimized?
d. Suppose the ordering cost is not $20, and Patterson has been ordering 150 units each time an
order is placed. For this order policy to be optimal, what would the ordering cost have to be?

b. Number of orders per year

Solved Problem 6-2
Flemming Accessories produces paper slicers used in offices and in art stores. The minislicer has been
one of its most popular items: Annual demand is 6,750 units and is constant throughout the year.
Kristen Flemming, owner of the firm, produces the minislicers in batches. On average, Kristen can man-
ufacture 125 minislicers per day. Demand for these slicers during the production process is 30 per day.
The setup cost for the equipment necessary to produce the minislicers is $150. Carrying costs are $1 per
minislicer per year. How many minislicers should Kristen manufacture in each batch?
Solution
The data for Flemming Accessories are summarized as follows:
This is a production run problem that involves a daily production rate and a daily demand rate. The
appropriate calculations are shown here:
Solved Problem 6-3
Dorsey Distributors has an annual demand for a metal detector of 1,400. The cost of a typical detector
to Dorsey is $400. Carrying cost is estimated to be 20% of the unit cost, and the ordering cost is $25 per
order. If Dorsey orders in quantities of 300 or more, it can get a 5% discount on the cost of the detec-
tors. Should Dorsey take the quantity discount? Assume the demand is constant.
Solution
The solution to any quantity discount model involves determining the total cost of each alternative after
quantities have been computed and adjusted for the original problem and every discount. We start the
analysis with no discount:

The next step is to compute the total cost for the discount:
Because this last economic order quantity is below the discounted price, we must adjust the order quan-

The optimal strategy is to order 300 units at a total cost of $543,517.
Solved Problem 6-4
The F. W. Harris Company sells an industrial cleaner to a large number of manufacturing plants in the
Houston area. An analysis of the demand and costs has resulted in a policy of ordering 300 units of this
product every time an order is placed. The demand is constant, at 25 units per day. In an agreement with
the supplier, F. W. Harris is willing to accept a lead time of 20 days since the supplier has provided an
excellent price. What is the reorder point? How many units are actually in inventory when an order
should be placed?
Solution
The reorder point is
This means that an order should be placed when the inventory position is 500. Since the ROP is greater
than the order quantity,

The B. N. Thayer and D. N. Thaht Computer Company sells a desktop computer that is popular among
gaming enthusiasts. In the past few months, demand has been relatively consistent, although it does
fluctuate from day to day. The company orders the computer cases from a supplier. It places an order
for 5,000 cases at the appropriate time to avoid stockouts. The demand during the lead time is normally
distributed, with a mean of 1,000 units and a standard deviation of 200 units. The holding cost per unit
per year is estimated to be $4. How much safety stock should the company carry to maintain a 96%
service level? What is the reorder point? What would the total annual holding cost be if this policy is
followed?

6-18 Lila Battle has determined that the annual demand
for number 6 screws is 100,000 screws. Lila, who
works in her brother’s hardware store, is in charge of
purchasing. She estimates that it costs $10 every
time an order is placed. This cost includes her
wages, the cost of the forms used in placing the
order, and so on. Furthermore, she estimates that the
cost of carrying one screw in inventory for a year is

one-half of 1 cent. Assume that the demand is con-
stant throughout the year.
(a) How many number 6 screws should Lila order at
a time if she wishes to minimize total inventory
cost?
(b) How many orders per year would be placed?
What would the annual ordering cost be?
(c) What would the average inventory be? What
would the annual holding cost be?
6-19 It takes approximately 8 working days for an order
of number 6 screws to arrive once the order has been
placed. (Refer to Problem 6-18.) The demand for
number 6 screws is fairly constant, and on the aver-
age, Lila has observed that her brother’s hardware
store sells 500 of these screws each day. Because the
demand is fairly constant, Lila believes that she can
avoid stockouts completely if she only orders the
number 6 screws at the correct time. What is the
ROP?
6-20 Lila’s brother believes that she places too many orders
for screws per year. He believes that an order should
be placed only twice per year. If Lila follows her
brother’s policy, how much more would this cost
every year over the ordering policy that she developed
in Problem 6-18? If only two orders were placed each
year, what effect would this have on the ROP?
6-21 Barbara Bright is the purchasing agent for West
Valve Company. West Valve sells industrial valves
and fluid control devices. One of the most popular
valves is the Western, which has an annual demand
of 4,000 units. The cost of each valve is $90, and the
inventory carrying cost is estimated to be 10% of
the cost of each valve. Barbara has made a study of
the costs involved in placing an order for any of the
valves that West Valve stocks, and she has con-
cluded that the average ordering cost is $25 per or-
der. Furthermore, it takes about two weeks for an
order to arrive from the supplier, and during this
time the demand per week for West valves is ap-
proximately 80.

6-22 Ken Ramsing has been in the lumber business for
most of his life. Ken’s biggest competitor is Pacific
Woods. Through many years of experience, Ken
knows that the ordering cost for an order of plywood
is $25 and that the carrying cost is 25% of the unit
cost. Both Ken and Pacific Woods receive plywood
in loads that cost $100 per load. Furthermore, Ken
and Pacific Woods use the same supplier of ply-
wood, and Ken was able to find out that Pacific
Woods orders in quantities of 4,000 loads at a time.
Ken also knows that 4,000 loads is the EOQ for
Pacific Woods. What is the annual demand in loads
of plywood for Pacific Woods?
6-23 Shoe Shine is a local retail shoe store located on the
north side of Centerville. Annual demand for a pop-
ular sandal is 500 pairs, and John Dirk, the owner of
Shoe Shine, has been in the habit of ordering 100
pairs at a time. John estimates that the ordering cost
is $10 per order. The cost of the sandal is $5 per pair.
For John’s ordering policy to be correct, what would
the carrying cost as a percentage of the unit cost
have to be? If the carrying cost were 10% of the
cost, what would the optimal order quantity be?
6-24 In Problem 6-18 you helped Lila Battle determine
the optimal order quantity for number 6 screws. She
had estimated that the ordering cost was $10 per
order. At this time, though, she believes that this es-
timate was too low. Although she does not know the
exact ordering cost, she believes that it could be as
high as $40 per order. How would the optimal order
quantity change if the ordering cost were $20, $30,
and $40?
6-25 Ross White’s machine shop uses 2,500 brackets dur-
ing the course of a year, and this usage is relatively
constant throughout the year. These brackets are
purchased from a supplier 100 miles away for $15
each, and the lead time is 2 days. The holding cost
per bracket per year is $1.50 (or 10% of the unit
cost) and the ordering cost per order is $18.75.
There are 250 working days per year.
(a) What is the EOQ?
(b) Given the EOQ, what is the average inventory?
What is the annual inventory holding cost?
(c) In minimizing cost, how many orders would be
made each year? What would be the annual or-
dering cost?
(d) Given the EOQ, what is the total annual inven-
tory cost (including purchase cost)?
(e) What is the time between orders?
(f) What is the ROP?
6-26 Ross White (see Problem 6-25) wants to reconsider
his decision of buying the brackets and is consider-
ing making the brackets in-house. He has deter-
mined that setup costs would be $25 in machinist
time and lost production time, and 50 brackets could
be produced in a day once the machine has been set
up. Ross estimates that the cost (including labor time
and materials) of producing one bracket would be
$14.80. The holding cost would be 10% of this cost.
(a) What is the daily demand rate?
(b) What is the optimal production quantity?
(c) How long will it take to produce the optimal
quantity? How much inventory is sold during
this time?
(d) If Ross uses the optimal production quantity, what
would be the maximum inventory level? What
would be the average inventory level? What is the
annual holding cost?

(e) How many production runs would there be each
year? What would be the annual setup cost?
(f) Given the optimal production run size, what is
the total annual inventory cost?
(g) If the lead time is one-half day, what is the ROP?
6-27 Upon hearing that Ross White (see Problems 6-25
and 6-26) is considering producing the brackets in-
house, the vendor has notified Ross that the pur-
chase price would drop from $15 per bracket to
$14.50 per bracket if Ross will purchase the brack-
ets in lots of 1,000. Lead times, however would in-
crease to 3 days for this larger quantity.
(a) What is the total annual inventory cost plus pur-
chase cost if Ross buys the brackets in lots of
1,000 at $14.50 each?
(b) If Ross does buy in lots of 1,000 brackets, what
is the new ROP?
(c) Given the options of purchasing the brackets at
$15 each, producing them in-house at $14.80,
and taking advantage of the discount, what is
your recommendation to Ross White?
6-28 After analyzing the costs of various options for
obtaining brackets, Ross White (see Problems 6-25,
6-26, and 6-27) recognizes that although he knows
that lead time is 2 days and demand per day averages
10 units, the demand during the lead time often
varies. Ross has kept very careful records and has
determined lead time demand is normally distributed
with a standard deviation of 1.5 units.
(a) What Z value would be appropriate for a 98%
service level?
(b) What safety stock should Ross maintain if he
wants a 98% service level?
(c) What is the adjusted ROP for the brackets?
(d) What is the annual holding cost for the safety
stock if the annual holding cost per unit is $1.50?
6-29 Douglas Boats is a supplier of boating equipment for
the states of Oregon and Washington. It sells 5,000
White Marine WM-4 diesel engines every year.
These engines are shipped to Douglas in a shipping
container of 100 cubic feet, and Douglas Boats
keeps the warehouse full of these WM-4 motors.
The warehouse can hold 5,000 cubic feet of boating
supplies. Douglas estimates that the ordering cost is
$10 per order, and the carrying cost is estimated to
be $10 per motor per year. Douglas Boats is consid-
ering the possibility of expanding the warehouse for
the WM-4 motors. How much should Douglas Boats
expand, and how much would it be worth for the
company to make the expansion? Assume demand is
constant throughout the year.
6-30 Northern Distributors is a wholesale organization
that supplies retail stores with lawn care and house-
hold products. One building is used to store Never-
fail lawn mowers. The building is 25 feet wide by
40 feet deep by 8 feet high. Anna Oldham, manager
of the warehouse, estimates that about 60% of the
warehouse can be used to store the Neverfail lawn
mowers. The remaining 40% is used for walkways
and a small office. Each Neverfail lawn mower
comes in a box that is 5 feet by 4 feet by 2 feet high.
The annual demand for these lawn mowers is
12,000, and the ordering cost for Northern Distribu-
tors is $30 per order. It is estimated that it costs
Northern $2 per lawn mower per year for storage.
Northern Distributors is thinking about increasing
the size of the warehouse. The company can only do
this by making the warehouse deeper. At the present
time, the warehouse is 40 feet deep. How many feet
of depth should be added on to the warehouse to
minimize the annual inventory costs? How much
should the company be willing to pay for this addi-
tion? Remember that only 60% of the total area can
be used to store Neverfail lawn mowers. Assume all
EOQ conditions are met.
6-31 Lisa Surowsky was asked to help in determining the
best ordering policy for a new product. Currently,
the demand for the new product has been projected
to be about 1,000 units annually. To get a handle on
the carrying and ordering costs, Lisa prepared a se-
ries of average inventory costs. Lisa thought that
these costs would be appropriate for the new prod-
uct. The results are summarized in the following
table. These data were compiled for 10,000 inven-
tory items that were carried or held during the year
and were ordered 100 times during the past year.

scissors in batches. On the average, Jan can produce
150 scissors per day, and during the production
process, demand for scissors has been about 40 scis-
sors per day. The cost to set up the production
process is $100, and it costs Jan 30 cents to carry
one pair of scissors for one year. How many scissors
should Jan produce in each batch?
6-33 Jim Overstreet, inventory control manager for Itex,
receives wheel bearings from Wheel-Rite, a small
producer of metal parts. Unfortunately, Wheel-Rite
can only produce 500 wheel bearings per day. Itex
receives 10,000 wheel bearings from Wheel-Rite
each year. Since Itex operates 200 working days
each year, its average daily demand for wheel bear-
ings is 50. The ordering cost for Itex is $40 per
order, and the carrying cost is 60 cents per wheel
bearing per year. How many wheel bearings should
Itex order from Wheel-Rite at one time? Wheel-Rite
has agreed to ship the maximum number of wheel
bearings that it produces each day to Itex when an
order has been received.
6-34 North Manufacturing has a demand for 1,000 pumps
each year. The cost of a pump is $50. It costs North
Manufacturing $40 to place an order, and the carry-
ing cost is 25% of the unit cost. If pumps are ordered
in quantities of 200, North Manufacturing can get a
3% discount on the cost of the pumps. Should North
Manufacturing order 200 pumps at a time and take
the 3% discount?
6-35 Linda Lechner is in charge of maintaining hospital
supplies at General Hospital. During the past year,
the mean lead time demand for bandage BX-5 was
60. Furthermore, the standard deviation for BX-5
was 7. Linda would like to maintain a 90% service
level. What safety stock level do you recommend for
BX-5?
6-36 Linda Lechner has just been severely chastised for
her inventory policy. (See Problem 6-35.) Sue
Surrowski, her boss, believes that the service level
should be either 95% or 98%. Compute the safety
stock levels for a 95% and a 98% service level.
Linda knows that the carrying cost of BX-5 is 50
cents per unit per year. Compute the carrying cost
that is associated with a 90%, a 95%, and a 98%
service level.

Thaarugo produces one of these, a printed circuit
board (PCB) is used, and it is populated with several
electronic components. Thaarugo determines that it
needs about 16,000 of this type of PCB each year.
Demand is relatively constant throughout the year,
and the ordering cost is about $25 per order; the
holding cost is 20% of the price of each PCB. Two
companies are competing to become the dominant
supplier of the PCBs, and both have now offered dis-
counts, as shown in the following table. Which of
the two suppliers should be selected if Thaarugo

ing cost of $45. The carrying cost is 20%, and the an-
nual demand is 100 sheets. What do you recommend?
6-46 Sunbright Citrus Products produces orange juice,
grapefruit juice, and other citrus-related items. Sun-
bright obtains fruit concentrate from a cooperative in
Orlando consisting of approximately 50 citrus grow-
ers. The cooperative will sell a minimum of 100
cans of fruit concentrate to citrus processors such as
Sunbright. The cost per can is $9.90.
Last year, the cooperative developed the Incen-
tive Bonus Program to give an incentive to their
large customers to buy in quantity. It works like this:
If 200 cans of concentrate are purchased, 10 cans of
free concentrate are included in the deal. In addition,
the names of the companies purchasing the concen-
trate are added to a drawing for a new personal com-
puter. The personal computer has a value of about
$3,000, and currently about 1,000 companies are
eligible for this drawing. At 300 cans of concentrate,
the cooperative will give away 30 free cans and will
also place the company name in the drawing for the
personal computer. When the quantity goes up to
400 cans of concentrate, 40 cans of concentrate will
be given away free with the order. In addition, the
company is also placed in a drawing for the personal
computer and a free trip for two. The value of the

trip for two is approximately $5,000. About 800
companies are expected to qualify and to be in the
running for this trip.
Sunbright estimates that its annual demand for
fruit concentrate is 1,000 cans. In addition, the order-
ing cost is estimated to be $10, while the carrying
cost is estimated to be 10%, or about $1 per unit. The
firm is intrigued with the incentive bonus plan. If the
company decides that it will keep the car, the trip, or
the computer if they are won, what should it do?
6-47 John Lindsay sells CDs that contain 25 software
packages that perform a variety of financial func-
tions, including net present value, internal rate of
return, and other financial programs typically used
by business students majoring in finance. Depending
on the quantity ordered, John offers the following
price discounts. The annual demand is 2,000 units
on average. His setup cost to produce the CDs is
$250. He estimates holding costs to be 10% of the
price, or about $1 per unit per year.
A case of E-Z Spread Cheese sells for $100 and has
a cost of $75. Any cheese that is not sold by the end
of the week is sold to a local food processor for $50.
Teresa never sells cheese that is more than a week
old. Use marginal analysis to determine how many
cases of E-Z Spread Cheese to produce each week to
maximize average profit.
6-49 Harry’s Hardware does a brisk business during the
year. During Christmas, Harry’s Hardware sells
Christmas trees for a substantial profit. Unfortu-
nately, any trees not sold at the end of the season are
totally worthless. Thus, the number of trees that are
stocked for a given season is a very important deci-
sion. The following table reveals the demand for
Christmas trees:

(a) What is the optimal number of CDs to produce

(b) What is the impact of the following quantity–price
schedule on the optimal order quantity?
6-48 Teresa Granger is the manager of Chicago Cheese,
which produces cheese spreads and other cheese-
related products. E-Z Spread Cheese is a product
that has always been popular. The probability of
sales, in cases, is as follows:
Harry sells trees for $80 each, but his cost is only
$20.
(a) Use marginal analysis to determine how many
trees Harry should stock at his hardware store.
(b) If the cost increased to $35 per tree and Harry
continues to sell trees for $80 each, how many
trees should Harry stock?
(c) Harry is thinking about increasing the price to
$100 per tree. Assume that the cost per tree is
$20. With the new price, it is expected that the
probability of selling 50, 75, 100, or 125 trees
will be 0.25 each. Harry does not expect to sell
more than 125 trees with this price increase.
What do you recommend?
6-50 In addition to selling Christmas trees during the
Christmas holidays, Harry’s Hardware sells all the
ordinary hardware items (see Problem 6-49). One of
the most popular items is Great Glue HH, a glue that
is made just for Harry’s Hardware. The selling price
is $4 per bottle, but unfortunately, the glue gets hard
and unusable after one month. The cost of the glue
is $1.20. During the past several months, the mean
sales of glue have been 60 units, and the standard
deviation is 7. How many bottles of glue should
Harry’s Hardware stock? Assume that sales follow a
normal distribution.
6-51 The marginal loss on Washington Reds, a brand
of apples from the state of Washington, is $35 per
case. The marginal profit is $15 per case. During the

244
CHAPTER 6 • INVENTORY CONTROL MODELS
past year, the mean sales of Washington Reds in
cases was 45,000 cases, and the standard deviation
was 4,450. How many cases of Washington Reds
should be brought to market? Assume that sales fol-
low a normal distribution.
6-52 Linda Stanyon has been the production manager for
Plano Produce for over eight years. Plano Produce is
a small company located near Plano, Illinois. One
produce item, tomatoes, is sold in cases, with daily
sales averaging 400 cases. Daily sales are assumed
to be normally distributed. In addition, 85% of the
time the sales are between 350 and 450 cases. Each
case costs $10 and sells for $15. All cases that are
not sold must be discarded.
(a) Using the information provided, estimate the
standard deviation of sales.
(b) Using the standard deviation in part (a), deter-
mine how many cases of tomatoes Linda should
stock.
6-53 Paula Shoemaker produces a weekly stock market
report for an exclusive readership. She normally
sells 3,000 reports per week, and 70% of the time
her sales range from 2,900 to 3,100. The report costs
Paula $15 to produce, but Paula is able to sell reports
for $350 each. Of course, any reports not sold by the
end of the week have no value. How many reports
should Paula produce each week?
6-54 Emarpy Appliance produces all kinds of major ap-
pliances. Richard Feehan, the president of Emarpy,
is concerned about the production policy for the
company’s best selling refrigerator. The demand for
this has been relatively constant at about 8,000 units
each year. The production capacity for this product
is 200 units per day. Each time production starts, it
costs the company $120 to move materials into
place, reset the assembly line, and clean the equip-
ment. The holding cost of a refrigerator is $50 per
year. The current production plan calls for 400 re-
frigerators to be produced in each production run.
Assume there are 250 working days per year.
(a) What is the daily demand of this product?
(b) If the company were to continue to produce 400
units each time production starts, how many
days would production continue?
(c) Under the current policy, how many production
runs per year would be required? What would
the annual setup cost be?
(d) If the current policy continues, how many refriger-
ators would be in inventory when production
stops? What would the average inventory level be?
(e) If the company produces 400 refrigerators at a
time, what would the total annual setup cost and
holding cost be?
6-55 Consider the Emarpy Appliance situation in Prob-
lem 6-54. If Richard Feehan wants to minimize the
total annual inventory cost, how many refrigerators
should be produced in each production run? How
much would this save the company in inventory
costs compared with the current policy of producing
400 in each production run?
6-56 This chapter presents a material structure tree for item
A in Figure 6.12. Assume that it now takes 1 unit of
item B to make every unit of item A. What impact
does this have on the material structure tree and the
number of items of D and E that are needed?
6-57 Given the information in Problem 6-56, develop a
gross material requirements plan for 50 units of
item A.
6-58 Using the data from Figures 6.12–6.14, develop a
net material requirements plan for 50 units of item A
assuming that it only takes 1 unit of item B for each
unit of item A.
6-59 The demand for product S is 100 units. Each unit of
S requires 1 unit of T and 1/2 unit of U. Each unit of
T requires 1 unit of V, 2 units of W, and 1 unit of X.
Finally, each unit of U requires 1/2 unit of Y and
3 units of Z. All items are manufactured by the same
firm. It takes two weeks to make S, one week to
make T, two weeks to make U, two weeks to make V,
three weeks to make W, one week to make X, two
weeks to make Y, and one week to make Z.
(a) Construct a material structure tree and a gross
material requirements plan for the dependent in-
ventory items.

subassembly C is made up of 2 units of Part D,
4 units of Part E, and 2 units of Part F. Develop a
material structure tree for this.
6-61 The lead time for each of the parts in the SL72 (Prob-
lem 6-60) is one week, except for Part B, which has a

Case Study
Martin-Pullin Bicycle Corporation
Martin-Pullin Bicycle Corp. (MPBC), located in Dallas, is a
wholesale distributor of bicycles and bicycle parts. Formed in
1981 by cousins Ray Martin and Jim Pullin, the firm’s primary
retail outlets are located within a 400-mile radius of the distri-
bution center. These retail outlets receive the order from
Martin-Pullin within two days after notifying the distribution
center, provided that the stock is available. However, if an or-
der is not fulfilled by the company, no backorder is placed; the
retailers arrange to get their shipment from other distributors,
and MPBC loses that amount of business.
The company distributes a wide variety of bicycles. The
most popular model, and the major source of revenue to the
company, is the AirWing. MPBC receives all the models from a
single manufacturer overseas, and shipment takes as long as
four weeks from the time an order is placed. With the cost of
communication, paperwork, and customs clearance included,
MPBC estimates that each time an order is placed, it incurs a
cost of $65. The purchase price paid by MPBC, per bicycle, is
roughly 60% of the suggested retail price for all the styles avail-
able, and the inventory carrying cost is 1% per month (12% per
year) of the purchase price paid by MPBC. The retail price
(paid by the customers) for the AirWing is $170 per bicycle.
MPBC is interested in making an inventory plan for 2011.
The firm wants to maintain a 95% service level with its cus-
tomers to minimize the losses on the lost orders. The data col-
lected for the past two years are summarized in the following
table. A forecast for AirWing model sales in the upcoming year
2011 has been developed and will be used to make an inventory
plan for MPBC.
Discussion Questions
1. Develop an inventory plan to help MPBC.
2. Discuss ROPs and total costs.
3. How can you address demand that is not at the level of the
planning horizon?

Inventory Control with QM for Windows
A variety of inventory control models are covered in this chapter. Each model makes different
assumptions and uses slightly different approaches. The use of QM for Windows is similar for
these different types of inventory problems. As you can see in the inventory menu for QM for
Windows, most of the inventory problems discussed in this chapter can be solved using your
computer.
To demonstrate QM for Windows, we start with the basic EOQ model. Sumco, a manufac-
turing company discussed in the chapter, has an annual demand of 1,000 units, an ordering cost
of $10 per unit, and a carrying cost of $0.50 per unit per year. With these data, we can use QM
for Windows to determine the economic order quantity. The results are shown in Program 6.5.
The production run inventory problem, which requires the daily production and demand
rate in addition to the annual demand, the ordering cost per order, and the carrying cost per unit
per year, is also covered in this chapter. Brown’s Manufacturing example is used in this chapter
to show how the calculations can be made manually. We can use QM for Windows on these data.
Program 6.6 shows the results.

The quantity discount model allows the material cost to vary with the quantity ordered. In
this case the model must consider and minimize material, ordering, and carrying costs by exam-
ining each price discount. Program 6.7 shows how QM for Windows can be used to solve the
quantity discount model discussed in the chapter. Note that the program output shows the input
data in addition to the results.
When an organization has a large number of inventory items, ABC analysis is often used.
As discussed in this chapter, total dollar volume for an inventory item is one way to determine if
quantitative control techniques should be used. Performing the necessary calculations is done in
Program 6.8, which shows how QM for Windows can be used to compute dollar volume and
determine if quantitative control techniques are justified for each inventory item with this new
example.

CHAPTER 7 • LINEAR PROGRAMMING MODELS: GRAPHICAL AND COMPUTER METHODS
7.1
Introduction
Many management decisions involve trying to make the most effective use of an organization’s
resources. Resources typically include machinery, labor, money, time, warehouse space, and raw
materials. These resources may be used to make products (such as machinery, furniture, food, or
clothing) or services (such as schedules for airlines or production, advertising policies, or in-
vestment decisions). Linear programming (LP) is a widely used mathematical modeling tech-
nique designed to help managers in planning and decision making relative to resource allocation.
We devote this and the next chapter to illustrating how and why linear programming works.
Despite its name, LP and the more general category of techniques called “mathematical”
programming have very little to do with computer programming. In the world of management
science, programming refers to modeling and solving a problem mathematically. Computer
programming has, of course, played an important role in the advancement and use of LP. Real-
life LP problems are too cumbersome to solve by hand or with a calculator. So throughout
the chapters on LP we give examples of how valuable a computer program can be in solving an
LP problem.
Linear programming is a
technique that helps in resource
allocation decisions.
7.2
Requirements of a Linear Programming Problem
In the past 60 years, LP has been applied extensively to military, industrial, financial, marketing,
accounting, and agricultural problems. Even though these applications are diverse, all LP prob-
lems have several properties and assumptions in common.
All problems seek to maximize or minimize some quantity, usually profit or cost. We refer
to this property as the objective function of an LP problem. The major objective of a typical
manufacturer is to maximize dollar profits. In the case of a trucking or railroad distribution sys-
tem, the objective might be to minimize shipping costs. In any event, this objective must be
stated clearly and defined mathematically. It does not matter, by the way, whether profits and
costs are measured in cents, dollars, or millions of dollars.
The second property that LP problems have in common is the presence of restrictions, or
constraints, that limit the degree to which we can pursue our objective. For example, deciding
how many units of each product in a firm’s product line to manufacture is restricted by available
personnel and machinery. Selection of an advertising policy or a financial portfolio is limited by
the amount of money available to be spent or invested. We want, therefore, to maximize or min-
imize a quantity (the objective function) subject to limited resources (the constraints).
There must be alternative courses of action to choose from. For example, if a company
produces three different products, management may use LP to decide how to allocate among
them its limited production resources (of personnel, machinery, and so on). Should it devote all
manufacturing capacity to make only the first product, should it produce equal amounts of each
product, or should it allocate the resources in some other ratio? If there were no alternatives to
select from, we would not need LP.
The objective and constraints in LP problems must be expressed in terms of linear equations
or inequalities. Linear mathematical relationships just mean that all terms used in the objective
function and constraints are of the first degree (i.e., not squared, or to the third or higher power, or
appearing more than once). Hence, the equation 
is an acceptable linear function,
while the equation 
is not linear because the variable A is squared, the
variable B is cubed, and the two variables appear again as a product of each other.
The term linear implies both proportionality and additivity. Proportionality means that if
production of 1 unit of a product uses 3 hours, production of 10 units would use 30 hours. Addi-
tivity means that the total of all activities equals the sum of the individual activities. If the pro-
duction of one product generated $3 profit and the production of another product generated $8
profit, the total profit would be the sum of these two, which would be $11.
We assume that conditions of certainty exist: that is, number in the objective and constraints
are known with certainty and do not change during the period being studied. 
We make the divisibility assumption that solutions need not be in whole numbers (integers).
Instead, they are divisible and may take any fractional value. In production problems, we often
2A2 + 5B3 + 3AB = 10
2A + 5B = 10
Problems seek to maximize or
minimize an objective.
Constraints limit the degree to
which the objective can be
obtained.
There must be alternatives
available.
Mathematical relationships are
linear.

FORMULATING LP PROBLEMS

define variables as the number of units produced per week or per month, and a fractional value
(e.g., 0.3 chairs) would simply mean that there is work in process. Something that was started in
one week can be finished in the next. However, in other types of problems, fractional values do
not make sense. If a fraction of a product cannot be purchased (for example, one-third of a sub-
marine), an integer programming problem exists. Integer programming is discussed in more de-
tail in Chapter 10.
Finally, we assume that all answers or variables are nonnegative. Negative values of physi-
cal quantities are impossible; you simply cannot produce a negative number of chairs, shirts,
lamps, or computers. Table 7.1 summarizes these properties and assumptions.
Linear programming was conceptually developed before World
War II by the outstanding Soviet mathematician A. N. Kolmogorov.
Another Russian, Leonid Kantorovich, won the Nobel Prize in Eco-
nomics for advancing the concepts of optimal planning. An early
application of LP, by Stigler in 1945, was in the area we today call
“diet problems.”
Major progress in the field, however, took place in 1947 and
later when George D. Dantzig developed the solution procedure
known as the simplex algorithm. Dantzig, then an Air Force math-
ematician, was assigned to work on logistics problems. He
noticed that many problems involving limited resources and more
than one demand could be set up in terms of a series of equa-
tions and inequalities. Although early LP applications were
military in nature, industrial applications rapidly became apparent
with the spread of business computers. In 1984, N. Karmarkar
developed an algorithm that appears to be superior to the sim-
plex method for many very large applications.

Formulating LP Problems
Formulating a linear program involves developing a mathematical model to represent the mana-
gerial problem. Thus, in order to formulate a linear program, it is necessary to completely un-
derstand the managerial problem being faced. Once this is understood, we can begin to develop
the mathematical statement of the problem. The steps in formulating a linear program follow:
1. Completely understand the managerial problem being faced.
2. Identify the objective and the constraints.
3. Define the decision variables.
4. Use the decision variables to write mathematical expressions for the objective function
and the constraints.
One of the most common LP applications is the product mix problem. Two or more prod-
ucts are usually produced using limited resources such as personnel, machines, raw materials,
and so on. The profit that the firm seeks to maximize is based on the profit contribution per unit
of each product. (Profit contribution, you may recall, is just the selling price per unit minus the
Product mix problems use LP to
decide how much of each product
to make, given a series of
resource restrictions.

CHAPTER 7 • LINEAR PROGRAMMING MODELS: GRAPHICAL AND COMPUTER METHODS
*Technically, we maximize total contribution margin, which is the difference between unit selling price and costs that
vary in proportion to the quantity of the item produced. Depreciation, fixed general expense, and advertising are
excluded from calculations.
The resource constraints put

resource and the painting labor

variable cost per unit.*) The company would like to determine how many units of each product
it should produce so as to maximize overall profit given its limited resources. A problem of this
type is formulated in the following example.
Flair Furniture Company
The Flair Furniture Company produces inexpensive tables and chairs. The production process
for each is similar in that both require a certain number of hours of carpentry work and a certain
number of labor hours in the painting and varnishing department. Each table takes 4 hours of
carpentry and 2 hours in the painting and varnishing shop. Each chair requires 3 hours in car-
pentry and 1 hour in painting and varnishing. During the current production period, 240 hours
of carpentry time are available and 100 hours in painting and varnishing time are available. Each
table sold yields a profit of $70; each chair produced is sold for a $50 profit.
Flair Furniture’s problem is to determine the best possible combination of tables and chairs
to manufacture in order to reach the maximum profit. The firm would like this production mix
situation formulated as an LP problem.
We begin by summarizing the information needed to formulate and solve this problem (see
Table 7.2). This helps us understand the problem being faced. Next we identify the objective and
the constraints. The objective is
The constraints are
1. The hours of carpentry time used cannot exceed 240 hours per week.
2. The hours of painting and varnishing time used cannot exceed 100 hours per week.
The decision variables that represent the actual decisions we will make are defined as
Now we can create the LP objective function in terms of T and C. The objective function is
Maximize
Our next step is to develop mathematical relationships to describe the two constraints in this
problem. One general relationship is that the amount of a resource used is to be less than or
equal to 
the amount of resource available.
In the case of the carpentry department, the total time used is
So the first constraint may be stated as follows:

Similarly, the second constraint is as follows:
Painting and varnishing time used 
Painting and varnishing time available
(This means that each table produced takes two hours of the painting and varnishing
resource.)
Both of these constraints represent production capacity restrictions and, of course, affect
the total profit. For example, Flair Furniture cannot produce 80 tables during the production
period because if 
both constraints will be violated. It also cannot make 
tables
and 
chairs. Why? Because this would violate the second constraint that no more than
100 hours of painting and varnishing time be allocated.
To obtain meaningful solutions, the values for T and C must be nonnegative numbers. That is,
all potential solutions must represent real tables and real chairs. Mathematically, this means that
The complete problem may now be restated mathematically as
subject to the constraints
While the nonnegativity constraints are technically separate constraints, they are often written on
a single line with the variables separated by commas. In this example, this would be written as

Here is a complete mathematical
statement of the LP problem.

Graphical Solution to an LP Problem
The easiest way to solve a small LP problem such as that of the Flair Furniture Company is with
the graphical solution approach. The graphical procedure is useful only when there are two
decision variables (such as number of tables to produce, T, and number of chairs to produce, C)
in the problem. When there are more than two variables, it is not possible to plot the solution on
a two-dimensional graph and we must turn to more complex approaches. But the graphical
method is invaluable in providing us with insights into how other approaches work. For that rea-
son alone, it is worthwhile to spend the rest of this chapter exploring graphical solutions as an
intuitive basis for the chapters on mathematical programming that follow.
Graphical Representation of Constraints
To find the optimal solution to an LP problem, we must first identify a set, or region, of feasible
solutions. The first step in doing so is to plot each of the problem’s constraints on a graph. The
variable T (tables) is plotted as the horizontal axis of the graph and the variable C (chairs) is
plotted as the vertical axis. The notation 
is used to identify the points on the graph. The
nonnegativity constraints mean that we are always working in the first (or northeast) quadrant
of a graph (see Figure 7.1).
To represent the first constraint graphically, 
we must first graph the
equality portion of this, which is
As you may recall from elementary algebra, a linear equation in two variables is a straight line.
The easiest way to plot the line is to find any two points that satisfy the equation, then draw a
straight line through them.
The two easiest points to find are generally the points at which the line intersects the T and
C axes.
4T + 3C = 240
4T + 3C … 240,
1T, C2
The graphical method works only
when there are two decision
variables, but it provides valuable
insight into how larger problems
are structured.

*Thus, what we have done is to plot the constraint equation in its most binding position, that is, using all of the carpen-

When Flair Furniture produces no tables, namely 
it implies that

or
In other words, if all of the carpentry time available is used to produce chairs, 80 chairs could be
made. Thus, this constraint equation crosses the vertical axis at 80.
To find the point at which the line crosses the horizontal axis, we assume that the firm
makes no chairs, that is,

are three possibilities. First, we know that any point that lies on the line 
satis-
fies the constraint. Any combination of tables and chairs on the line will use up all 240 hours of
carpentry time.* Now we must find the set of solution points that would use less than the 240
hours. The points that satisfy the 
portion of the constraint (i.e., 
) will be all
the points on one side of the line, while all the points on the other side of the line will not satisfy
this condition. To determine which side of the line this is, simply choose any point on either side

ample, choose the point (30, 20), as illustrated in Figure 7.3:
Since 
this point satisfies the constraint, and all points on this side of the line will
also satisfy the constraint. This set of points is indicated by the shaded region in Figure 7.3.
To see what would happen if the point did not satisfy the constraint, select a point on the
other side of the line, such as (70, 40). This constraint would not be met at this point as
Since 
this point and every other point on that side of the line would not satisfy
this constraint. Thus, the solution represented by the point 
would require more than
the 240 hours that are available. There are not enough carpentry hours to produce 70 tables
and 40 chairs.

CHAPTER 7 • LINEAR PROGRAMMING MODELS: GRAPHICAL AND COMPUTER METHODS
Next, let us identify the solution corresponding to the second constraint, which limits the time
available in the painting and varnishing department. That constraint was given as 
As before, we start by graphing the equality portion of this constraint, which is
To find two points on the line, select 
and solve for C:
So, one point on the line is 
To find the second point, select 
and solve for T:
The second point used to graph the line is (50, 0). Plotting this point, (50, 0), and the other point,
(0, 100), results in the line representing all the solutions in which exactly 100 hours of painting
and varnishing time are used, as shown in Figure 7.4.
To find the points that require less than 100 hours, select a point on either side of this line to
see if the inequality portion of the constraint is satisfied. Selecting (0, 0) give us
This indicates that this and all the points below the line satisfy the constraint, and this region is
shaded in Figure 7.4.
Now that each individual constraint has been plotted on a graph, it is time to move on to the
next step. We recognize that to produce a chair or a table, both the carpentry and painting and
varnishing departments must be used. In an LP problem we need to find that set of solution
points that satisfies all of the constraints simultaneously. Hence, the constraints should be
redrawn on one graph (or superimposed one upon the other). This is shown in Figure 7.5.
The shaded region now represents the area of solutions that does not exceed either of the
two Flair Furniture constraints. It is known by the term area of feasible solutions or, more
simply, the feasible region. The feasible region in an LP problem must satisfy all conditions
specified by the problem’s constraints, and is thus the region where all constraints overlap.
Any point in the region would be a feasible solution to the Flair Furniture problem; any point
outside the shaded area would represent an infeasible solution. Hence, it would be feasible to

This possible solution falls within the time available in carpentry but exceeds the time available
in painting and varnishing and thus falls outside the feasible region.
Isoprofit Line Solution Method
Now that the feasible region has been graphed, we may proceed to find the optimal solution to
the problem. The optimal solution is the point lying in the feasible region that produces the high-
est profit. Yet there are many, many possible solution points in the region. How do we go about
selecting the best one, the one yielding the highest profit?
There are a few different approaches that can be taken in solving for the optimal solution
when the feasible region has been established graphically. The speediest one to apply is called
the isoprofit line method.
We start the technique by letting profits equal some arbitrary but small dollar amount. For
the Flair Furniture problem we may choose a profit of $2,100. This is a profit level that can be

Defining the Problem
American Airlines (AA) employs more than 8,300 pilots and 16,200 flight attendants to fly more than
5,000 aircraft. Total cost of American’s crews exceed $1.4 billion per year, second only to fuel cost. Sched-
uling crews is one of AA’s biggest and most complex problems. The FAA sets work-time limitations de-
signed to ensure that crew members can fulfill their duties safely. And union contracts specify that crews
will be guaranteed pay for some number of hours each day or each trip.
Developing a Model
American Airlines Decision Technologies (AA’s consulting group) spent 15 labor-years in developing an LP
model called TRIP (trip reevaluation and improvement program). The TRIP model builds crew schedules
that meet or exceed crews’ pay guarantee to the maximum extent possible.
Acquiring Input Data
Data and constraints are derived from salary information and union and FAA rules that specify maximum
duty lengths, overnight costs, airline schedules, and plane sizes.
Developing a Solution
It takes about 500 hours of mainframe computer time per month to develop crew schedules—these are
prepared 40 days prior to the targeted month.
Testing the Solution
TRIP results were originally compared with crew assignments constructed manually. Since 1971, the model
has been improved with new LP techniques, new constraints, and faster hardware and software. A series
of what-if? studies have tested TRIP’s ability to reach more accurate and optimal solutions.
Analyzing the Results
Each year the LP model improves AA’s efficiency and allows the airline to operate with a proportionately
smaller work crew. A faster TRIP system now allows sensitivity analysis of the schedule in its first week.
Implementing the Results
The model, fully implemented, generates annual savings of more than $20 million. AA has also sold TRIP
to 10 other airlines and one railroad.

CHAPTER 7 • LINEAR PROGRAMMING MODELS: GRAPHICAL AND COMPUTER METHODS
Again, any combination of tables (T) and chairs (C) on this isoprofit line produces a total
profit of $2,800. Note that the third line generates a profit of $3,500, even more of an improve-
ment. The farther we move from the origin, the higher our profit will be. Another important
point is that these isoprofit lines are parallel. We now have two clues as to how to find the opti-
mal solution to the original problem. We can draw a series of parallel lines (by carefully moving
our ruler in a plane parallel to the first profit line). The highest profit line that still touches some
point of the feasible region pinpoints the optimal solution. Notice that the fourth line ($4,200) is
too high to be considered.
The last point that an isoprofit line would touch in this feasible region is the corner point
where the two constraint lines intersect, so this point will result in the maximum possible profit.
To find the coordinates of this point, solve the two equations simultaneously (as detailed in the
next section). This results in the point (30, 40) as shown in Figure 7.8. Calculating the profit at
this point, we get
So producing 30 tables and 40 chairs yields the maximum profit of $4,100.
Corner Point Solution Method
A second approach to solving LP problems employs the corner point method. This technique
is simpler conceptually than the isoprofit line approach, but it involves looking at the profit at
every corner point of the feasible region.
The mathematical theory behind LP states that an optimal solution to any problem (that is,
the values of T, C that yield the maximum profit) will lie at a corner point, or extreme point,
of the feasible region. Hence, it is only necessary to find the values of the variables at each cor-
ner; an optimal solution will lie at one (or more) of them.
The first step in the corner point method is to graph the constraints and find the feasible re-
gion. This was also the first step in the isoprofit method, and the feasible region is shown again
in Figure 7.9. The second step is to find the corner points of the feasible region. For the Flair
Furniture example, the coordinates of three of the corner points are obvious from observing the
graph. These are (0, 0), (50, 0), and (0, 80). The fourth corner point is where the two constraint
lines intersect, and the coordinates must be found algebraically by solving the two equations
simultaneously for two variables.
There are a number of ways to solve equations simultaneously, and any of these may be
used. We will illustrate the elimination method here. To begin the elimination method, select a
variable to be eliminated. We will select T in this example. Then multiply or divide one equation
Profit = 70T + 50C = 701302 + 501402 = $4,100
We draw a series of parallel
isoprofit lines until we find the
highest isoprofit line, that is, the
one with the optimal solution.
The mathematical theory behind
LP is that the optimal solution
must lie at one of the corner
points in the feasible region.

coefficient of that variable in the other equation. The two constraint equations are
To eliminate T, we multiply the second equation by 
and then add it to the first equation:
or
Doing this has enabled us to eliminate one variable, T, and to solve for C. We can now substitute
40 for C in either of the original equations and solve for T. Let’s use the first equation. When

Thus, the last corner point is (30, 40).
The next step is to calculate the value of the objective function at each of the corner points.
The final step is to select the corner with the best value, which would be the highest profit in this
example. Table 7.3 lists these corners points with their profits. The highest profit is found to be
$4,100, which is obtained when 30 tables and 40 chairs are produced. This is exactly what was
obtained using the isoprofit method.

CHAPTER 7 • LINEAR PROGRAMMING MODELS: GRAPHICAL AND COMPUTER METHODS
Table 7.4 provides a summary of both the isoprofit method and the corner point method.
Either of these can be used when there are two decision variables. If a problem has more than
two decision variables, we must rely on the computer software or use the simplex algorithm
discussed in Module 7.
Slack and Surplus
In addition to knowing the optimal solution to a linear program, it is helpful to know whether all
of the available resources are being used. The term slack is used for the amount of a resource
that is not used. For a less-than-or-equal to constraint,
In the Flair Furniture example, there were 240 hours of carpentry time available. If the com-
pany decided to produce 20 tables and 25 chairs instead of the optimal solution, the amount of
carpentry time used 
would be 
So,
For the optimal solution 
to the Flair Furniture problem, the slack is 0 since all
240 hours are used.
The term surplus is used with greater-than-or-equal-to constraints to indicate the amount by
which the right-hand-side of a constraint is exceeded. For a greater-than-or-equal-to constraint,
Suppose there had been a constraint in the example that required the total number of tables
and chairs combined to be at least 42 units (i.e., 
), and the company decided to
produce 20 tables and 25 chairs. The total amount produced would be 
so the
surplus would be
meaning that 3 units more than the minimum were produced. For the optimal solution (30, 40)
in the Flair Furniture problem, if this constraint had been in the problem, the surplus would be
70 - 42 = 28.

maintaining the slope. The last point it touches in the feasible region is the optimal solution.
4. Find the values of the decision variables at this last point and compute the profit (or cost).
CORNER POINT METHOD
1. Graph all constraints and find the feasible region.
2. Find the corner points of the feasible region.
3. Compute the profit (or cost) at each of the feasible corner points.
4. Select the corner point with the best value of the objective function found in step 3. This is
the optimal solution.

So the slack and surplus represent the difference between the left-hand side (LHS) and the
right-hand side (RHS) of a constraint. The term slack is used when referring to less-than-or-
equal-to constraints, and the term surplus is used when referring to greater-than-or-equal-to con-
straints. Most computer software for linear programming will provide the amount of slack and
surplus that exist for each constraint in the optimal solution.
A constraint that has zero slack or surplus for the optimal solution is called a binding
constraint. A constraint with positive slack or surplus for the optimal solution is called a
nonbinding constraint. Some computer output will specify whether a constraint is binding or
nonbinding.

Solving Flair Furniture’s LP Problem Using QM For Windows and Excel
Almost every organization has access to computer programs that are capable of solving enor-
mous LP problems. Although each computer program is slightly different, the approach each
takes toward handling LP problems is basically the same. The format of the input data and the
level of detail provided in output results may differ from program to program and computer to
computer, but once you are experienced in dealing with computerized LP algorithms, you can
easily adjust to minor changes.
Using QM for Windows
Let us begin by demonstrating QM for Windows on the Flair Furniture Company problem. To
use QM for Windows, select the Linear Programming module. Then specify the number of con-
straints (other than the nonnegativity constraints, as it is assumed that the variables must be non-
negative), the number of variables, and whether the objective is to be maximized or minimized.
For the Flair Furniture Company problem, there are two constraints and two variables. Once
these numbers are specified, the input window opens as shown in Program 7.1A. Then you can
enter the coefficients for the objective function and the constraints. Placing the cursor over the
X1 or X2 and typing a new name such as T and C will change the variable names. The constraint
names can be similarly modified. Program 7.1B shows the QM for Windows screen after the
Input the coefficients.
The equations will automatically 
be modifed when coefficients
are entered in the table.
Type over X1 and X2 
with new variable names.
Type new constraint names.

Once the problem has been solved, a graph may be displayed by selecting Window—Graph
from the menu bar in QM for Windows. Program 7.1D shows the output for the graphical solu-
tion. Notice that in addition to the graph, the corner points and the original problem are also

vided by QM for Windows.
Using Excel’s Solver Command to Solve LP Problems
Excel 2010 (as well as earlier versions) has an add-in called Solver that can be used to solve lin-
ear programs. If this add-in doesn’t appear on the Data tab in Excel 2010, it has not been acti-
vated. See Appendix F for details on how to activate it.
PREPARING THE SPREADSHEET FOR SOLVER The spreadsheet must be prepared with data and
formulas for certain calculations before Solver can be used. Excel QM can be used to simplify
this process (see Appendix 7.1). We will briefly describe the steps, and further discussion and
suggestions will be provided when the Flair Furniture example is presented. Here is a summary
of the steps to prepare the spreadsheet:
1. Enter the problem data. The problem data consist of the coefficients of the objective func-
tion and the constraints, plus the RHS values for each of the constraints. It is best to organ-
ize this in a logical and meaningful way. The coefficients will be used when writing
formulas in steps 3 and 4, and the RHS will be entered into Solver.

The signs for the constraints are

The text in column A is combined with the text above the calculated

These cells are selected to contain the values of the decision variables.
Solver will enter the optimal solution here, but you may enter numbers
here also.
PROGRAM 7.2A

2. Designate specific cells for the values of the decision variables. Later, these cell addresses
will be input into Solver.
3. Write a formula to calculate the value of the objective function, using the coefficients 
for the objective function (from step 1) that you have entered and the cells containing 
the values of the decision variables (from step 2). Later, this cell address will be input
into Solver.
4. Write a formula to calculate the value of the left-hand-side (LHS) of each constraint, 
using the coefficients for the constraints (from step 1) that you have entered and the cells
containing the values of the decision variables (from step 2). Later, these cell addresses and
the cell addresses for the corresponding RHS value will be input into Solver.
These four steps must be completed in some way with all linear programs in Excel. Addi-
tional information may be put into the spreadsheet for clarification purposes. Let’s illustrate
these with an example. Helpful suggestions will be provided.
1. Enter the problem data. Program 7.2A contains input data for the Flair Furniture problem.
It is usually best to use one column for each variable and one row for each constraint.
Descriptive labels should be put in column A. Variable names or a description should be
put just above the cells for the solution, and the coefficients in the objective function and
constraints should be in the same columns as these names. For this example, T (Tables) and
C (Chairs), have been entered in cells B3 and C3. Just the words Tables and Chairs or just
the variables names T and C could have been used. The cells where the coefficients are to
be entered have been given a different background color (shading) and outlined with a bold
line to highlight them for this example.
Row 5 was chosen as the objective function row, and the words “Objective function”
were entered into column A. Excel will use these words in the output. The profit (objective
function coefficient) for each table is entered into B5, while the profit on each chair is
entered into C5. Similarly, the words Carpentry and Painting were entered into column A
for the carpentry and painting constraints. The coefficients for T and C in these constraints
are in rows 8 and 9. The RHS values are entered in the appropriate rows; the test RHS is en-
tered above the values, and this text will appear in the Solver output. Since both of these
constraints are 
constraints, the symbol 
has been entered in column E, next to the RHS
values. It is understood that the equality portion of 
is a part of the constraint. While it is
not necessary to have the signs 
for the constraints anywhere in the spreadsheet, having
them explicitly shown acts as a reminder for the user of the spreadsheet when entering the
problem into Solver.

The formula for the LHS of each constraint can be copied from cell D5. The $ signs
cause the cell addresses to remain unchanged when the cell (D5) is copied.
A 1 was entered as the value of
T and value of C to help find
obvious errors in the formulas.
The values of the variables are in B4
and C4, and the profits for these are
in cells B5 and C5. This formula will
calculate B4*B5+C4*C5, or 1(70)+
1(50), and return a value of 120.
PROGRAM 7.2B
Formulas for the Flair
Furniture Example
The words in column A and the words immediately above the input data are used in the
Solver output unless the cells or cell ranges are explicitly named in Excel. In Excel 2010,
names can be assigned by selecting Name Manager on the Formula tab.
2. Designate specific cells for the values of the decision variables. There must be one cell for
the value of T (cell C4) and one cell for the value of C (cell D4). These should be in the
row underneath the variable names, as the Solver output will associate the values to the text
immediately above (cells C3 and D3) the values unless the cells with the values have been
given other names using the Excel Name Manager.
3. Write a formula to calculate the value of the objective function. Before writing any formu-
las, it helps to enter a 1 as the value of each variable (cells B4 and C4). This will help to
see if the formula has any obvious errors. Cell D5 is selected as the cell for the objective
function value, although this cell could be anywhere. It is convenient to keep it in the
objective row with the objective function coefficients. The formula in Excel could be writ-
ten as =B4*B5+C4*C5. However, there is a function in Excel, SUMPRODUCT, that will
make this easier. Since the values in cells B4:C4 (from B4 to C4) are to be multiplied by
the values in cells B5:C5, the function would be written as =SUMPRODUCT(B4:C4,
B5:C5). This will cause the numbers in the first range (B4:C4) to be multiplied by the
numbers in the second range (B5:C5) on a term-by-term basis, and then these results will
be summed. Since a similar formula will be used for the LHS of the two constraints, it
helps to specify (using the $ symbol) that the addresses for the variables are absolute (as
opposed to relative) and should not be changed when the formula is copied. This final
function would be =SUMPRODUCT($B$4:$C$4,B5:C5), as shown in Program 7.2B.
When this is entered into cell D5, the value in that cell becomes 120 since there is a 1 in
cells B4 and D5, and the calculation from the SUMPRODUCT function would be
Program 7.2C shows the values that resulted from the formulas,
and a quick look at the profit per unit tells us we would expect the profit to be 120 if 1 unit
of each were made. Had B4:C4 been empty, cell D5 would have a value of 0. There are
many ways that a formula can be written incorrectly and result in a value of 0, and obvious
errors are not readily seen.
4. Write a formula to calculate the value of the LHS of each constraint. While individual formu-
las may be written, it is easier to use the SUMPRODUCT function used in step 3. It is even
easier to simply copy the formula in cell D5 and paste it into cells D8 and D9, as illustrated
in Program 7.2B. The first cell range, $B$4:$C$4, does not change since it is an absolute
address; the second range, B5:C5, does changes. Notice that the values in D8 and D9 are
what would be expected since T and C both have a value of 1.
11702 + 11502 = 120.

Because there is a 1 in each of these cells,
the LHS values can be calculated very easily
to see if a mistake hase been made.
You can change these values to see how the 
profit and resource utilization change.

a way as to minimize total shipping costs. A hospital may want to provide a daily meal plan
for its patients that meets certain nutritional standards while minimizing food purchase
costs.
Minimization problems can be solved graphically by first setting up the feasible solution
region and then using either the corner point method or an isocost line approach (which is anal-
ogous to the isoprofit approach in maximization problems) to find the values of the decision
variables (e.g., 
and 
) that yield the minimum cost. Let’s take a look at a common LP prob-
lem referred to as the diet problem. This situation is similar to the one that the hospital faces in
feeding its patients at the least cost.
Holiday Meal Turkey Ranch
The Holiday Meal Turkey Ranch is considering buying two different brands of turkey feed and
blending them to provide a good, low-cost diet for its turkeys. Each feed contains, in varying
proportions, some or all of the three nutritional ingredients essential for fattening turkeys. Each
pound of brand 1 purchased, for example, contains 5 ounces of ingredient A, 4 ounces of ingre-
dient B, and 0.5 ounce of ingredient C. Each pound of brand 2 contains 10 ounces of ingredient
A, 3 ounces of ingredient B, but no ingredient C. The brand 1 feed costs the ranch 2 cents a
pound, while the brand 2 feed costs 3 cents a pound. The owner of the ranch would like to use
LP to determine the lowest-cost diet that meets the minimum monthly intake requirement for
each nutritional ingredient.
Table 7.5 summarizes the relevant information. If we let
then we may proceed to formulate this linear programming problem as follows:
subject to these constraints:
Before solving this problem, we want to be sure to note three features that affect its solu-
tion. First, you should be aware that the third constraint implies that the farmer must purchase
enough brand 1 feed to meet the minimum standards for the C nutritional ingredient. Buying
only brand 2 would not be feasible because it lacks C. Second, as the problem is formulated, we

will be solving for the best blend of brands 1 and 2 to buy per turkey per month. If the ranch
houses 5,000 turkeys in a given month, it need simply multiply the X1 and X2 quantities by 5,000
to decide how much feed to order overall. Third, we are now dealing with a series of greater-
than-or-equal-to constraints. These cause the feasible solution area to be above the constraint
lines in this example.
USING THE CORNER POINT METHOD ON A MINIMIZATION PROBLEM To solve the Holiday Meal
Turkey Ranch problem, we first construct the feasible solution region. This is done by plotting
each of the three constraint equations as in Figure 7.10. Note that the third constraint,
can be rewritten and plotted as 
(This involves multiplying both sides of
the inequality by 2 but does not change the position of the constraint line in any way.) Minimiza-
tion problems are often unbounded outward (i.e., on the right side and on top), but this causes
no difficulty in solving them. As long as they are bounded inward (on the left side and the bot-
tom), corner points may be established. The optimal solution will lie at one of the corners as it
would in a maximization problem.
In this case, there are three corner points: a, b, and c. For point a, we find the coordi-
nates at the intersection of the ingredient C and B constraints, that is, where the line 
crosses the line 
If we substitute 
into the B constraint equation,
we get
or
Thus, point a has the coordinates 
To find the coordinates of point b algebraically, we solve the equations 
and 
simultaneously. This yields 1X1 = 8.4, X2 = 4.82.
5X1 + 10X2 = 90
4X1 + 3X2 = 48
1X1 = 3, X2 = 122.

NBC Uses Linear, Integer, and Goal
Programming in Selling Advertising Slots
The National Broadcasting Companay (NBC) sells over $4 billion
in television advertising each year. About 60% to 80% of the air
time for an upcoming season is sold in a 2- to 3-week period in
late May. The advertising agencies approach the networks to pur-
chase advertising time for their clients. Included in each request
are the dollar amount, the demographic (e.g., age of the viewing
audience) in which the client is interested, the program mix,
weekly weighting, unit-length distribution, and a negotiated cost
per 1,000 viewers. NBC must then develop detailed sales plans to
meet these requirements. Traditionally, NBC developed these
plans manually, and this required several hours per plan. These
usually had to be reworked due to the complexity involved. With
more  than 300 such plans to be developed and reworked in a
2- to 3-week period, this was very time intensive and did not nec-
essarily result in the maximum possible revenue.
In 1996, a project in the area of yield management was
begun. Through this effort, NBC was able to create plans that
more accurately meet customers’ requirements, respond to
customers more quickly, make the most profitable use of its
limited inventory of advertising time slots, and reduce rework.
The success of this system led to the development of a full-
scale optimization system based on linear, integer, and goal
programming. It is estimated that sales revenue between the
years 1996 and 2000 increased by over $200 million due
largely to this effort. Improvements in rework time, sales force
productivity, and customer satisfaction were also benefits of
this system.

Hence, the minimum cost solution is to purchase 8.4 pounds of brand 1 feed and 4.8 pounds of
brand 2 feed per turkey per month. This will yield a cost of 31.2 cents per turkey.
ISOCOST LINE APPROACH As mentioned before, the isocost line approach may also be used to
solve LP minimization problems such as that of the Holiday Meal Turkey Ranch. As with
isoprofit lines, we need not compute the cost at each corner point, but instead draw a series of
parallel cost lines. The lowest cost line (that is, the one closest in toward the origin) to touch the
feasible region provides us with the optimal solution corner.
For example, we start in Figure 7.11 by drawing a 54-cent cost line, namely 
Obviously, there are many points in the feasible region that would yield a lower
total cost. We proceed to move our isocost line toward the lower left, in a plane parallel to the
54-cent solution line. The last point we touch while still in contact with the feasible region is the
same as corner point b of Figure 7.10. It has the coordinates 
and an asso-
ciated cost of 31.2 cents.
COMPUTER APPROACH For the sake of completeness, we also solve the Holiday Meal Turkey
Ranch problem using the QM for Windows software package (see Program 7.3) and with
Excel’s Solver function (see Programs 7.4A and 7.4B).
1X1 = 8.4, X2 = 4.82
2X1 + 3X2.

 Cost at point c = 21182 + 3102 = 36
 Cost at point b = 218.42 + 314.82 = 31.2
 Cost at point a = 2132 + 31122 = 42
 Cost = 2X1 + 3X2
1X1 = 18, X2 = 02.
The isocost line method is
analogous to the isoprofit line
method we used on maximization
problems.

Four Special Cases in LP
Four special cases and difficulties arise at times when using the graphical approach to solving
LP problems: (1) infeasibility, (2) unboundedness, (3) redundancy, and (4) alternate optimal
solutions.
No Feasible Solution
When there is no solution to an LP problem that satisfies all of the constraints given, then no
feasible solution exists. Graphically, it means that no feasible solution region exists—a situation
that might occur if the problem was formulated with conflicting constraints. This, by the way,
is a frequent occurrence in real-life, large-scale LP problems that involve hundreds of con-
straints. For example, if one constraint is supplied by the marketing manager who states that at
least 300 tables must be produced (namely, 
) to meet sales demand, and a second re-
striction is supplied by the production manager, who insists that no more than 220 tables be pro-
duced (namely, 
) because of a lumber shortage, no feasible solution region results.
When the operations research analyst coordinating the LP problem points out this conflict, one
manager or the other must revise his or her inputs. Perhaps more raw materials could be pro-
cured from a new source, or perhaps sales demand could be lowered by substituting a different
model table to customers.
As a further graphic illustration of this, let us consider the following three constraints:
As seen in Figure 7.12, there is no feasible solution region for this LP problem because of the
presence of conflicting constraints.

FOUR SPECIAL CASES IN LP
275
When the profit in a maximization
problem can be infinitely large, the
problem is unbounded and is
missing one or more constraints.
Unboundedness
Sometimes a linear program will not have a finite solution. This means that in a maximization
problem, for example, one or more solution variables, and the profit, can be made infinitely large
without violating any constraints. If we try to solve such a problem graphically, we will note that
the feasible region is open ended.
Let us consider a simple example to illustrate the situation. A firm has formulated the fol-
lowing LP problem:
As you see in Figure 7.13, because this is a maximization problem and the feasible region
extends infinitely to the right, there is unboundedness, or an unbounded solution. This implies
that the problem has been formulated improperly. It would indeed be wonderful for the com-
pany to be able to produce an infinite number of units of 
(at a profit of $3 each!), but obvi-
ously no firm has infinite resources available or infinite product demand.
Redundancy
The presence of redundant constraints is another common situation that occurs in large LP for-
mulations. Redundancy causes no major difficulties in solving LP problems graphically, but
you should be able to identify its occurrence. A redundant constraint is simply one that does not
affect the feasible solution region. In other words, one constraint may be more binding or
restrictive than another and thereby negate its need to be considered.
Let’s look at the following example of an LP problem with three constraints:
X1, X2 Ú 0
X1
… 25
2X1 +
X2 … 30

X2 … 20

A redundant constraint is one
that does not affect the feasible
solution region.

The third constraint, 
is redundant and unnecessary in the formulation and solution of
the problem because it has no effect on the feasible region set from the first two more restrictive
constraints (see Figure 7.14).
Alternate Optimal Solutions
An LP problem may, on occasion, have two or more alternate optimal solutions. Graphically,
this is the case when the objective function’s isoprofit or isocost line runs perfectly parallel to
one of the problem’s constraints—in other words, when they have the same slope.
Management of a firm noticed the presence of more than one optimal solution when they
formulated this simple LP problem:
As we see in Figure 7.15, our first isoprofit line of $8 runs parallel to the constraint equation.
At a profit level of $12, the isoprofit line will rest directly on top of the segment of the first con-
straint line. This means that any point along the line between A and B provides an optimal 
and 
combination. Far from causing problems, the existence of more than one optimal solu-
tion allows management great flexibility in deciding which combination to select. The profit
remains the same at each alternate solution.

Sensitivity Analysis
Optimal solutions to LP problems have thus far been found under what are called deterministic
assumptions. This means that we assume complete certainty in the data and relationships of a
problem—namely, prices are fixed, resources known, time needed to produce a unit exactly set.
But in the real world, conditions are dynamic and changing. How can we handle this apparent
discrepancy?

Example of Alternate
Optimal Solutions
How sensitive is the optimal
solution to changes in profits,
resources, or other input
parameters?
One way we can do so is by continuing to treat each particular LP problem as a determin-
istic situation. However, when an optimal solution is found, we recognize the importance of
seeing just how sensitive that solution is to model assumptions and data. For example, if a
firm realizes that profit per unit is not $5 as estimated but instead is closer to $5.50, how will
the final solution mix and total profit change? If additional resources, such as 10 labor hours
or 3 hours of machine time, should become available, will this change the problem’s answer?
Such analyses are used to examine the effects of changes in three areas: (1) contribution rates
for each variable, (2) technological coefficients (the numbers in the constraint equations), and
(3) available resources (the right-hand-side quantities in each constraint). This task is alterna-
tively called sensitivity analysis, postoptimality analysis, parametric programming, or
optimality analysis.
Sensitivity analysis also often involves a series of what-if? questions. What if the profit on
product 1 increases by 10%? What if less money is available in the advertising budget con-
straint? What if workers each stay one hour longer every day at 1 1/2-time pay to provide in-
creased production capacity? What if new technology will allow a product to be wired in
one-third the time it used to take? So we see that sensitivity analysis can be used to deal not only
with errors in estimating input parameters to the LP model but also with management’s experi-
ments with possible future changes in the firm that may affect profits.
There are two approaches to determining just how sensitive an optimal solution is to
changes. The first is simply a trial-and-error approach. This approach usually involves resolving
the entire problem, preferably by computer, each time one input data item or parameter is
changed. It can take a long time to test a series of possible changes in this way.
The approach we prefer is the analytic postoptimality method. After an LP problem has
been solved, we attempt to determine a range of changes in problem parameters that will not af-
fect the optimal solution or change the variables in the solution. This is done without resolving
the whole problem.
Let’s investigate sensitivity analysis by developing a small production mix problem. Our
goal will be to demonstrate graphically and through the simplex tableau how sensitivity analysis
can be used to make linear programming concepts more realistic and insightful.
An important function of
sensitivity analysis is to allow
managers to experiment with
values of the input parameters.
Postoptimality analysis means
examining changes after the
optimal solution has been
reached.

High Note Sound Company
The High Note Sound Company manufactures quality compact disc (CD) players and stereo re-
ceivers. Each of these products requires a certain amount of skilled artisanship, of which there is
a limited weekly supply. The firm formulates the following LP problem in order to determine
the best production mix of CD players 
and receivers 
The solution to this problem is illustrated graphically in Figure 7.16. Given this information and
deterministic assumptions, the firm should produce only stereo receivers (20 of them), for a
weekly profit of $2,400.
For the optimal solution, 
the electrician hours used are
and this equals the amount available, so there is 0 slack for this constraint. Thus, it is a binding
constraint. If a constraint is binding, obtaining additional units of that resource will usually re-
sult in higher profits. The audio technician hours used are for the optimal solution (0, 20) are
but the hours available are 60. Thus, there is a slack of 
hours. Because there are
extra hours available that are not being used, this is a nonbinding constraint. For a nonbinding
constraint, obtaining additional units of that resource will not result in higher profits and will
only increase the slack.
Changes in the Objective Function Coefficient
In real-life problems, contribution rates (usually profit or cost) in the objective functions fluctu-
ate periodically, as do most of a firm’s expenses. Graphically, this means that although the feasi-
ble solution region remains exactly the same, the slope of the isoprofit or isocost line will

change. It is easy to see in Figure 7.17 that the High Note Sound Company’s profit line is opti-
mal at point a. But what if a technical breakthrough just occurred that raised the profit per stereo
receiver 
from $120 to $150? Is the solution still optimal? The answer is definitely yes, for
in this case the slope of the profit line accentuates the profitability at point a. The new profit is
On the other hand, if 
’s profit coefficient was overestimated and should only have been
$80, the slope of the profit line changes enough to cause a new corner point (b) to become opti-
mal. Here the profit is 
This example illustrates a very important concept about changes in objective function
coefficients. We can increase or decrease the objective function coefficient (profit) of any
variable, and the current corner point may remain optimal if the change is not too large.
However, if we increase or decrease this coefficient by too much, then the optimal solution
would be at a different corner point. How much can the objective function coefficient change
before another corner point becomes optimal? Both QM for Windows and Excel provide the
answer.
QM for Windows and Changes in Objective Function Coefficients
The QM for Windows input for the High Note Sound Company example is shown in Pro-
gram 7.5A. When the solution has been found, selecting Window and Ranging allows us to

A new corner point becomes
optimal if an objective function
coefficient is decreased or
increased too much.

280
CHAPTER 7 • LINEAR PROGRAMMING MODELS: GRAPHICAL AND COMPUTER METHODS
From Program 7.5B, we see the profit on CD players was $50, which is indicated as the
original value in the output. This objective function coefficient has a lower bound of negative
infinity and an upper bound of $60. This means that the current corner point solution remains
optimal as long as the profit on CD players does not go above $60. If it equals $60, there would
be two optimal solutions as the objective function would be parallel to the first constraint. The
points (0, 20) and (16, 12) would both give a profit of $2,400. The profit on CD players may
decrease any amount as indicated by the negative infinity, and the optimal corner point does not
change. This negative infinity is logical because currently there are no CD players being pro-
duced because the profit is too low. Any decrease in the profit on CD players would make them
less attractive relative to the receivers, and we certainly would not produce any CD players
because of this.
The profit on receivers has an upper bound of infinity (it may increase by any amount) and
a lower bound of $100. If this profit equaled $100, then the corner points (0, 20) and (16, 12)
would both be optimal. The profit at each of these would be $2,000.
In general, a change can be made to one (and only one) objective function coefficient, and
the current optimal corner point remains optimal as long as the change is between the Upper
and Lower Bounds. If two or more coefficients are changed simultaneously, then the problem
should be solved with the new coefficients to determine whether or not this current solution
remains optimal.
Excel Solver and Changes in Objective Function Coefficients
Program 7.6A illustrates how the Excel 2010 spreadsheet for this example is set up for Solver.
When Solver is selected from the Data tab, the appropriate inputs are made, and Solve is
clicked in the Solver dialog box, the solution and the Solver Results window will appear as in
Program 7.6B. Selecting Sensitivity from the reports area of this window will provide a Sensi-
tivity Report on a new worksheet, with results as shown in Program 7.6C. Note how the cells
are named based on the text from Program 7.6A. Notice that Excel does not provide lower
bounds and upper bounds for the objective function coefficients. Instead, it gives the allowable
increases and decreases for these. By adding the allowable increase to the current value, we
may obtain the upper bound. For example, the Allowable Increase on the profit (objective coef-
ficient) for CD players is 10, which means that the upper bound on this profit is
Similarly, we may subtract the allowable decrease from the current value
to obtain the lower bound.
Changes in the Technological Coefficients
Changes in what are called the technological coefficients often reflect changes in the state
of technology. If fewer or more resources are needed to produce a product such as a CD
player or stereo receiver, coefficients in the constraint equations will change. These changes
$50 + $10 = $60.

Such a change might take place when the firm discov-
ers that it no longer demands three hours of audio technicians’ time to produce a CD player, but
only two hours.

feasible region enough to cause a new corner point (g) to become optimal. Before moving on,
see if you reach an objective function value of $1,954 profit at point g (versus a profit of $1,920
at point f).*
Changes in the Resources or Right-Hand-Side Values
The right-hand-side values of the constraints often represent resources available to the firm. The
resources could be labor hours or machine time or perhaps money or production materials avail-
able. In the High Note Sound Company example, the two resources are hours available of elec-
tricians’ time and hours of audio technicians’ time. If additional hours were available, a higher
total profit could be realized. How much should the company be willing to pay for additional
hours? Is it profitable to have some electricians work overtime? Should we be willing to pay for
more audio technician time? Sensitivity analysis about these resources will help us answer these
questions.

tions must be whole numbers each period, refer to our discussion of integer programming in Chapter 10 to handle the

Swift & Company Uses LP to Schedule
Production
Based in Greeley, Colorado, Swift & Company has annual sales
over $8 billion, with beef and related products making up the vast
majority of this. Swift has five processing plants, which handle
over 6 billion pounds of beef each year. Each head of beef is cut
into two sides, which yield the chuck, the brisket, the loins, the
ribs, the round, the plate, and the flank. With some cuts in
greater demand than others, the customer service representatives
(CSRs) try to meet the demand for customers while providing dis-
counts when necessary to clear out some cuts that might be in
excess supply. It is important that the CSRs have accurate infor-
mation on product availability in close to real time so they can
react quickly to changing demand.
With the cost of raw material being as high as 85%, and with
a very thin profit margin, it is essential that the company operate
efficiently. Swift started a project in March 2001 to develop
a mathematical programming model that would optimize the
supply chain. Ten full-time employees worked with four opera-
tions research consultants from Aspen Technology on what was
called Project Phoenix. At the heart of the final model are 45 inte-
grated LP models that enable the company to dynamically sched-
ule its operations in real time as orders are received.
With Project Phoenix, not only did profit margins increase,
but the improvements in forecasting, cattle procurement, and
manufacturing improved relations with customers and en-
hanced the reputation of Swift & Company in the marketplace.
The company is better able to deliver products according to
customer specification. While the model cost over $6 million to
develop, in the first year of operation, it generated a benefit of
$12.7 million.

Capable-to-Promise Application for Swift & Company,” Interfaces 36, 1

IN ACTION
If the right-hand side of a constraint is changed, the feasible region will change (unless
the constraint is redundant), and often the optimal solution will change. In the High Note
Sound Company example, there were 80 hours of electrician time available each week and
the maximum possible profit was $2,400. There is no slack for this constraint, so it is a bind-
ing constraint. If the available electricians’ hours are increased to 100 hours, the new opti-
mal solution seen in Figure 7.19, part (a) is (0, 25) and the profit is $3,000. Thus, the extra
20 hours of time resulted in an increase in profit of $600 or $30 per hour. If the hours were
decreased to 60 hours as shown in Figure 7.19, part (b), the new optimal solution is (0, 15)
and the profit is $1,800. Thus, reducing the hours by 20 results in a decrease in profit of $600
or $30 per hour. This $30 per hour change in profit that resulted from a change in the hours
available is called the dual price or dual value. The dual price for a constraint is the im-
provement in the objective function value that results from a one-unit increase in the right-
hand side of the constraint.
The dual price of $30 per hour of electrician time tells us we can increase profit if we have
more electrician hours. However, there is a limit to this as there is limited audio technician time.
If the total hours of electrician time were 240 hours, the optimal solution would be (0, 60) as
shown in Figure 7.19, part (c) and the profit would be $7,200. Again, this is an increase of $30
profit per hour (the dual price) for each of the 160 hours that were added to the original amount.
If the number of hours increased beyond 240, then profit would no longer increase and the opti-
mal solution would still be (0, 60) as shown in Figure 7.19, part (c). There would simply be
excess (slack) hours of electrician time and all of the audio technician time would be used. Thus,
the dual price is relevant only within limits. Both QM for Windows and Excel Solver provide
these limits.
QM for Windows and Changes in Right-Hand-Side Values
The QM for Windows sensitivity analysis output was shown in Program 7.5B. The dual value
for the electrician hours constraint is given as 30, and the lower bound is zero while the upper
bound is 240. This means that each additional hour of electrician time, up to a total of 240 hours,
The value of one additional unit
of a scarce resource may be
found from the dual price.

284
CHAPTER 7 • LINEAR PROGRAMMING MODELS: GRAPHICAL AND COMPUTER METHODS
Dual prices will change if the
amount of the resource (the
right-hand side of the constraint)
goes above the upper bound or
below the lower bound given in
the Ranging section of the QM
for Windows output.

will increase the maximum possible profit by $30. Similarly, if the available electrician time is
decreased, the maximum possible profit will decrease by $30 per hour until the available time is
decreased to the lower bound of 0. If the amount of electrician time (the right-hand-side value
for this constraint) is outside this range (0 to 240), then the dual value is no longer relevant and
the problem should be resolved with the new right-hand-side value.
In Program 7.5B, the dual value for audio technician hours is shown to be $0 and the slack
is 40, so it is a nonbinding constraint. There are 40 hours of audio technician time that are not

being used despite the fact that they are currently available. If additional hours were made avail-
able they would not increase profit but would simply increase the amount of slack. This dual
value of zero is relevant as long as the right-hand side does not go below the lower bound of 20.
The upper limit is infinity indicating that adding more hours would simply increase the amount
of slack.
Excel Solver and Changes in Right-Hand-Side Values
The Sensitivity report from Excel Solver was shown in Program 7.6C. Notice that Solver gives
the shadow price instead of the dual price. A shadow price is the change in the objective func-
tion value (e.g., profit or cost) that results from a one-unit increase in the right-hand-side of a
constraint.
Since an improvement in the objective function value in a maximization problem is the
same as a positive change (increase), the dual price and the shadow price are exactly the same
for maximization problems. For a minimization problem, an improvement in the objective func-
tion value is a decrease, which is a negative change. So for minimization problems, the shadow
price will be the negative of the dual price.
The Allowable Increase and Allowable Decrease for the right-hand side of each constraint
is provided, and the shadow price is relevant for changes within these limits. For the electrician
hours, the right-hand-side value of 80 may be increased by 160 (for a total of 240) or decreased
by 80 (for a total of 0) and the shadow price remains relevant. If a change is made that exceeds
these limits, then the problem should be resolved to find the impact of the change.
The shadow price is the same as
the dual price in maximization
problems.
Summary
In this chapter we introduce a mathematical modeling tech-
nique called linear programming (LP). It is used in reaching an
optimum solution to problems that have a series of constraints
binding the objective. We use both the corner point method and
the isoprofit/isocost approaches for graphically solving prob-
lems with only two decision variables.
The graphical solution approaches of this chapter provide
a conceptual basis for tackling larger, more complex problems,
some of which are addressed in Chapter 8. To solve real-life LP
problems with numerous variables and constraints, we need a
solution procedure such as the simplex algorithm, the subject
of Module 7. The simplex algorithm is the method that QM for
Windows and Excel use to tackle LP problems.
In this chapter we also present the important concept of
sensitivity analysis. Sometimes referred to as postoptimality
analysis, sensitivity analysis is used by management to answer
a series of what-if? Questions about LP model parameters. It
also tests just how sensitive the optimal solution is to changes
in profit or cost coefficients, technological coefficients, and
right-hand-side resources. We explored sensitivity analysis
graphically (i.e., for problems with only two decision vari-
ables) and with computer output, but to see how to conduct
sensitivity algebraically through the simplex algorithm, read
Module 7 (located at www.pearsonhighered.com/render).

for the optimal solution.
Constraint
A restriction on the resources available to a firm
(stated in the form of an inequality or an equation).

Using these values in the first constraint gives us
Another way to find this is by looking at the slack:
b. For the second constraint we have
Instead of computing this, you may simply observe that the slack is 0, so all of the 8,000 square feet
will be used.
c. No, the solution would not change. The dual price is 0 and there is slack available. The value 300 is
between the lower bound of 280 and the upper bound of infinity. Only the slack for this constraint
would change.
d. Since the new coefficient for

current corner point remains optimal. So

e. The dual price for this constraint is 0.4, and the upper bound is 9,500. The increase of 1,000 units

Solution
A graph of the four constraints follows. The arrows indicate the direction of feasibility for each
constraint. The next graph illustrates the feasible solution region and plots of two possible objective
function cost lines. The first, $10,000, was selected arbitrarily as a starting point. To find the optimal
corner point, we need to move the cost line in the direction of lower cost, that is, down and to the left.
The last point where a cost line touches the feasible region as it moves toward the origin is corner point
D. Thus D, which represents

7-1 Discuss the similarities and differences between
minimization and maximization problems using the
graphical solution approaches of LP.
7-2 It is important to understand the assumptions under-
lying the use of any quantitative analysis model.
What are the assumptions and requirements for an
LP model to be formulated and used?
7-3 It has been said that each LP problem that has a
feasible region has an infinite number of solutions.
Explain.
7-4 You have just formulated a maximization LP prob-
lem and are preparing to solve it graphically. What
criteria should you consider in deciding whether it
would be easier to solve the problem by the corner
point method or the isoprofit line approach?
7-5 Under what condition is it possible for an LP prob-
lem to have more than one optimal solution?

equalities and use them to illustrate graphically each
of the following conditions:
(a) an unbounded problem
(b) an infeasible problem
(c) a problem containing redundant constraints

facturing firm once made the statement, “I would like
to use LP, but it’s a technique that operates under con-
ditions of certainty. My plant doesn’t have that cer-
tainty; it’s a world of uncertainty. So LP can’t be used
here.” Do you think this statement has any merit?
Explain why the manager may have said it.

Problems

The Electrocomp Corporation manufactures two elec-
trical products: air conditioners and large fans. The as-
sembly process for each is similar in that both require
a certain amount of wiring and drilling. Each air con-
ditioner takes 3 hours of wiring and 2 hours of drilling.
Each fan must go through 2 hours of wiring and 1 hour
of drilling. During the next production period, 240
hours of wiring time are available and up to 140 hours
of drilling time may be used. Each air conditioner sold
yields a profit of $25. Each fan assembled may be sold
for a $15 profit. Formulate and solve this LP produc-
tion mix situation to find the best combination of air
conditioners and fans that yields the highest profit.
Use the corner point graphical approach.
7-15 Electrocomp’s management realizes that it forgot to
include two critical constraints (see Problem 7-14). In
particular, management decides that there should be a
minimum number of air conditioners produced in
order to fulfill a contract. Also, due to an oversupply

7-16 A candidate for mayor in a small town has allocated
$40,000 for last-minute advertising in the days pre-
ceding the election. Two types of ads will be used:
radio and television. Each radio ad costs $200 and
reaches an estimated 3,000 people. Each television
ad costs $500 and reaches an estimated 7,000 peo-
ple. In planning the advertising campaign, the cam-
paign manager would like to reach as many people
as possible, but she has stipulated that at least 10 ads
of each type must be used. Also, the number of radio
ads must be at least as great as the number of televi-
sion ads. How many ads of each type should be
used? How many people will this reach?
7-17 The Outdoor Furniture Corporation manufactures
two products, benches and picnic tables, for use in
yards and parks. The firm has two main resources:
its carpenters (labor force) and a supply of redwood
for use in the furniture. During the next production
cycle, 1,200 hours of labor are available under a
union agreement. The firm also has a stock of 3,500
feet of good-quality redwood. Each bench that Out-
door Furniture produces requires 4 labor hours and
10 feet of redwood; each picnic table takes 6 labor
hours and 35 feet of redwood. Completed benches
will yield a profit of $9 each, and tables will result
in a profit of $20 each. How many benches and
tables should Outdoor Furniture produce to obtain
the largest possible profit? Use the graphical LP
approach.
7-18 The dean of the Western College of Business must
plan the school’s course offerings for the fall semes-
ter. Student demands make it necessary to offer at
least 30 undergraduate and 20 graduate courses in
the term. Faculty contracts also dictate that at least
60 courses be offered in total. Each undergraduate
course taught costs the college an average of $2,500
in faculty wages, and each graduate course costs
$3,000. How many undergraduate and graduate
courses should be taught in the fall so that total fac-
ulty salaries are kept to a minimum?
7-19 MSA Computer Corporation manufactures two mod-
els of minicomputers, the Alpha 4 and the Beta 5. The
firm employs five technicians, working 160 hours
each per month, on its assembly line. Management
insists that full employment (i.e., all 160 hours of
time) be maintained for each worker during next
month’s operations. It requires 20 labor hours to
assemble each Alpha 4 computer and 25 labor hours
to assemble each Beta 5 model. MSA wants to see at
least 10 Alpha 4s and at least 15 Beta 5s produced
during the production period. Alpha 4s generate
$1,200 profit per unit, and Beta 5s yield $1,800 each.
Determine the most profitable number of each model
of minicomputer to produce during the coming
month.
7-20 A winner of the Texas Lotto has decided to invest
$50,000 per year in the stock market. Under consid-
eration are stocks for a petrochemical firm and a
public utility. Although a long-range goal is to get
the highest possible return, some consideration is
given to the risk involved with the stocks. A risk in-
dex on a scale of 1–10 (with 10 being the most risky)
is assigned to each of the two stocks. The total risk
of the portfolio is found by multiplying the risk of
each stock by the dollars invested in that stock.
The following table provides a summary of the
return and risk:

The investor would like to maximize the return on
the investment, but the average risk index of the in-
vestment should not be higher than 6. How much
should be invested in each stock? What is the aver-
age risk for this investment? What is the estimated
return for this investment?
7-21
Referring to the Texas Lotto situation in Problem 7-20,
suppose the investor has changed his attitude about
the investment and wishes to give greater emphasis
to the risk of the investment. Now the investor
wishes to minimize the risk of the investment as
long as a return of at least 8% is generated. Formu-
late this as an LP problem and find the optimal solu-
tion. How much should be invested in each stock?
What is the average risk for this investment? What is
the estimated return for this investment?

olives to grow on their own and results in a smaller

land. The production of a barrel of olives by the nor-
mal process requires only 2 labor hours but takes
2 acres of land. An olive grower has 250 hours of
labor available and a total of 150 acres for growing.
Because of the olive size difference, a barrel of olives
produced on pruned trees sells for $20, whereas a

7-25 Woofer Pet Foods produces a low-calorie dog food
for overweight dogs. This product is made from beef
products and grain. Each pound of beef costs $0.90,
and each pound of grain costs $0.60. A pound of the
dog food must contain at least 9 units of Vitamin 1
and 10 units of Vitamin 2. A pound of beef contains
10 units of Vitamin 1 and 12 units of Vitamin 2. A
pound of grain contains 6 units of Vitamin 1 and 9
units of Vitamin 2. Formulate this as an LP problem
to minimize the cost of the dog food. How many
pounds of beef and grain should be included in each
pound of dog food? What is the cost and vitamin
content of the final product?

change?
7-30 Examine the LP formulation in Problem 7-29. The
problem’s second constraint reads
If the firm decides that 36 hours of time can be made
available on machine 2 (namely, an additional 12
hours) at an additional cost of $10, should it add the
hours?
7-31 Consider the following LP problem:
(a) What is the optimal solution to this problem?
Solve it graphically.
(b) If a technical breakthrough occurred that raised
the profit per unit of X to $8, would this affect
the optimal solution?
(c) Instead of an increase in the profit coefficient X
to $8, suppose that profit was overestimated and
should only have been $3. Does this change the
optimal solution?

7-36 Serendipity*
The three princes of Serendip
Went on a little trip.
They could not carry too much weight;
More than 300 pounds made them hesitate.
They planned to the ounce. When they returned to
Ceylon
They discovered that their supplies were just about
gone
When, what to their joy, Prince William found
A pile of coconuts on the ground.
“Each will bring 60 rupees,” said Prince Richard
with a grin
As he almost tripped over a lion skin.
“Look out!” cried Prince Robert with glee
As he spied some more lion skins under a tree.
“These are worth even more—300 rupees each
If we can just carry them all down to the beach.”
Each skin weighed fifteen pounds and each coconut,
five,
But they carried them all and made it alive.
The boat back to the island was very small

15 cubic feet baggage capacity—that was all.
Each lion skin took up one cubic foot
While eight coconuts the same space took.
With everything stowed they headed to sea
And on the way calculated what their new wealth
might be.
“Eureka!” cried Prince Robert, “Our worth is so
great
That there’s no other way we could return in this
state.
Any other skins or nut that we might have brought
Would now have us poorer. And now I know what—
I’ll write my friend Horace in England, for surely
Only he can appreciate our serendipity.”
Formulate and solve Serendipity by graphical LP in
order to calculate “what their new wealth might be.”
7-37 Bhavika Investments, a group of financial advisors
and retirement planners, has been requested to pro-
vide advice on how to invest $200,000 for one of its
clients. The client has stipulated that the money
must be put into either a stock fund or a money mar-
ket fund, and the annual return should be at least
$14,000. Other conditions related to risk have also
been specified, and the following linear program
was developed to help with this investment decision:
total investment is 
$200,000
return must be at least
$14,000
at least $40,000 must 
be in money market

The QM for Windows output is shown below.
(a) How much money should be invested in the
money market fund and the stock fund? What is
the total risk?
(b) What is the total return? What rate of return is
this?
(c) Would the solution change if risk measure for
each dollar in the stock fund were 14 instead
of 12?
(d) For each additional dollar that is available, how
much does the risk change?
(e) Would the solution change if the amount that
must be invested in the money market fund were
changed from $40,000 to $50,000?
7-38 Refer to the Bhavika Investments (Problem 7-37) situ-
ation once again. It has been decided that, rather than
minimize risk, the objective should be to maximize re-
turn while placing restriction on the amount of risk.
The average risk should be no more than 11 (with a to-
tal risk of 2,200,000 for the $200,000 invested). The
linear program was reformulated, and the QM for
Windows output is shown on the next page.
(a) How much money should be invested in the
money market fund and the stock fund? What is
the total return? What rate of return is this?
(b) What is the total risk? What is the average risk?
(c) Would the solution change if return for each dol-
lar in the stock fund were 0.09 instead of 0.10?
(d) For each additional dollar that is available, what
is the marginal rate of return?

the amount that must be invested in the money
market fund were changed from $40,000 to

City and Omaha. The owners of the ranch seek to
determine the amounts of cattle feed to buy so that
minimum nutritional standards are satisfied, and at
the same time total feed costs are minimized. The
feed mix can be made up of the three grains that
contain the following ingredients per pound of feed:

The cost per pound of stocks X, Y, and Z are $2, $4,
and $2.50, respectively. The minimum requirement
per cow per month is 4 pounds of ingredient A, 5
pounds of ingredient B, 1 pound of ingredient C, and
8 pounds of ingredient D.
The ranch faces one additional restriction: it can
only obtain 500 pounds of stock Z per month from
the feed supplier regardless of its need. Because
there are usually 100 cows at the Feed ‘N Ship
Ranch at any given time, this means that no more
than 5 pounds of stock Z can be counted on for use
in the feed of each cow per month.

7-41 Outdoor Inn, a camping equipment manufacturer in
southern Utah, is developing a production schedule
for a popular type of tent, the Double Inn. Orders
have been received for 180 of these to be delivered
at the end of this month, 220 to be delivered at the
end of next month, and 240 to be delivered at the
end of the month after that. This tent may be pro-
duced at a cost of $120, and the maximum number
of tents that can be produced in a month is 230.

DISCUSSION QUESTIONS AND PROBLEMS
299
The company may produce some extra tents in one
month and keep them in storage until the next
month. The cost for keeping these in inventory for
1 month is estimated to be $6 per tent for each tent
left at the end of the month. Formulate this as an LP
problem to minimize cost while meeting demand
and not exceeding the monthly production capacity.
Solve it using any computer software. (Hint: Define
variables to represent the number of tents left over at
the end of each month.)
7-42 Outdoors Inn (see Problem 7-41) expanded its tent-
making operations later in the year. While still mak-
ing the Double Inn tent, it is also making a larger
tent, the Family Rolls, which has four rooms. The
company can produce up to a combined total of 280
tents per month. The following table provides the
demand that must be met and the production costs
for the next 3 months. Note that the costs will in-
crease in month 2. The holding cost for keeping a
tent in inventory at the end of the month for use in
the next month is estimated to be $6 per tent for the
Double Inn and $8 per tent for the Family Rolls. De-
velop a linear program to minimize the total cost.
Solve it using any computer software.
Third, MCA is experiencing a problem affecting
the intelligent modems model. Its component supplier
is able to guarantee only 8,000 microprocessors for
November delivery. Each intelligent modem requires
one of these specially made microprocessors. Alter-
native suppliers are not available on short notice.
MCA wants to plan the optimal mix of the two
modem models to produce in November to maxi-
mize profits for MCA.
(a) Formulate, using September’s data, MCA’s prob-
lem as a linear program.
(b) Solve the problem graphically.
(c) Discuss the implications of your recommended
solution.

7-43 Modem Corporation of America (MCA) is the
world’s largest producer of modem communication
devices for microcomputers. MCA sold 9,000 of the
regular model and 10,400 of the smart (“intelligent”)
model this September. Its income statement for the
month is shown in the table on this page. Costs pre-
sented are typical of prior months and are expected to
remain at the same levels in the near future.
The firm is facing several constraints as it pre-
pares its November production plan. First, it has ex-
perienced a tremendous demand and has been
unable to keep any significant inventory in stock.
This situation is not expected to change. Second, the
firm is located in a small Iowa town from which ad-
ditional labor is not readily available. Workers can
be shifted from production of one modem to an-
other, however. To produce the 9,000 regular
modems in September required 5,000 direct labor
hours. The 10,400 intelligent modems absorbed
10,400 direct labor hours.

7-45 Raptor Fuels produces three grades of gasoline—
Regular, Premium, and Super. All of these are
produced by blending two types of crude oil—
Crude A and Crude B. The two types of crude
contain specific ingredients which help in deter-
mining the octane rating of gasoline. The impor-
tant ingredients and the costs are contained in the
following table:
In order to achieve the desired octane ratings, at
least 41% of Regular gasoline should be Ingredient
1; at least 44% of Premium gasoline must be Ingre-
dient 1, and at least 48% of Super gasoline must be
Ingredient 1. Due to current contract commitments,
Raptor Fuels must produce as least 20,000 gallons of
Regular, at least 15,000 gallons of Premium, and at
least 10,000 gallons of Super. Formulate a linear
program that could be used to determine how much
of Crude A and Crude B should be used in each of
the gasolines to meet the demands at the minimum
cost. What is the minimum cost? How much of
Crude A and Crude B are used in each gallon of the
different types of gasoline?
Case Study
Mexicana Wire Works
Ron Garcia felt good about his first week as a management
trainee at Mexicana Wire Winding, Inc. He had not yet devel-
oped any technical knowledge about the manufacturing
process, but he had toured the entire facility, located in the sub-
urbs of Mexico City, and had met many people in various areas
of the operation.
Mexicana, a subsidiary of Westover Wire Works, a Texas
firm, is a medium-sized producer of wire windings used in mak-
ing electrical transformers. Carlos Alverez, the production con-
trol manager, described the windings to Garcia as being of
standardized design. Garcia’s tour of the plant, laid out by
process type (see Figure 7.20), followed the manufacturing se-
quence for the windings: drawing, extrusion, winding, inspec-
tion, and packaging. After inspection, good product is packaged
and sent to finished product storage; defective product is stored
separately until it can be reworked.
On March 8, Vivian Espania, Mexicana’s general manager,
stopped by Garcia’s office and asked him to attend a staff meet-
ing at 1:00 P.M.
“Let’s get started with the business at hand,” Vivian said,
opening the meeting. “You all have met Ron Garcia, our new
management trainee. Ron studied operations management in his
MBA program in southern California, so I think he is competent
to help us with a problem we have been discussing for a long
time without resolution. I’m sure that each of you on my staff
will give Ron your full cooperation.”
Vivian turned to José Arroyo, production control manager.
“José, why don’t you describe the problem we are facing?”
“Well,” José said, “business is very good right now. We are
booking more orders than we can fill. We will have some new
equipment on line within the next several months, which will
take care of our capacity problems, but that won’t help us in
April. I have located some retired employees who used to work
in the drawing department, and I am planning to bring them in
as temporary employees in April to increase capacity there.
Because we are planning to refinance some of our long-term
debt, Vivian wants our profits to look as good as possible in
April. I’m having a hard time figuring out which orders to run
and which to back order so that I can make the bottom line look
as good as possible. Can you help me with this?”
Garcia was surprised and apprehensive to receive such an
important, high-profile assignment so early in his career.

8.1
Introduction
The graphical method of linear programming (LP) discussed in Chapter 7 is useful for under-
standing how to formulate and solve small LP problems. The purpose of this chapter is to go one
step further and show how a large number of real-life problems can be modeled using LP. We do
this by presenting examples of models in the areas of marketing research, media selection,
production mix, labor scheduling, production scheduling, shipping and transportation, ingredi-
ent mix, and financial portfolio selection. We will solve many of these LP problems using
Excel’s Solver and QM for Windows.
Although some of these models are relatively small numerically, the principles developed
here are definitely applicable to larger problems. Moreover, this practice in “paraphrasing” LP
model formulations should help develop your skills in applying the technique to other, less com-
mon applications.
8.2
Marketing Applications
Media Selection
Linear programming models have been used in the advertising field as a decision aid in selecting
an effective media mix. Sometimes the technique is employed in allocating a fixed or limited
budget across various media, which might include radio or television commercials, newspaper
ads, direct mailings, magazine ads, and so on. In other applications, the objective is the maxi-
mization of audience exposure. Restrictions on the allowable media mix might arise through con-
tract requirements, limited media availability, or company policy. An example follows.
The Win Big Gambling Club promotes gambling junkets from a large Midwestern city to
casinos in the Bahamas. The club has budgeted up to $8,000 per week for local advertising. The
money is to be allocated among four promotional media: TV spots, newspaper ads, and two types
of radio advertisements. Win Big’s goal is to reach the largest possible high-potential audience
through the various media. The following table presents the number of potential gamblers
reached by making use of an advertisement in each of the four media. It also provides the cost per
advertisement placed and the maximum number of ads that can be purchased per week.

Win Big’s contractual arrangements require that at least five radio spots be placed each week.
To ensure a broad-scoped promotional campaign, management also insists that no more than
$1,800 be spent on radio advertising every week.
In formulating this as a linear program, the first step is to completely understand the prob-
lem. Sometimes asking “what if” questions will help understand the situation. In this example,
what would happen if exactly five ads of each type were used? What would this cost? How many
people would it reach? Certainly the use of a spreadsheet for the calculations can help with this
since formulas can be written to calculate the cost and the number of people reached. Once the
situation is understood, the objective and the constraints are stated:
Objective:
Maximize number of people 1audience2 reached

8.2
MARKETING APPLICATIONS
309
Constraints:
(1) No more than 12 TV ads can be used. (2) No more than 5 newspaper ads can be used. (3)
No more than 25 of the 30-second radio ads can be used. (4) No more than 20 of the 1-minute
radio ads can be used. (5) Total amount spent cannot exceed $8,000. (6) Total number of
radio ads must be at least 5. (7) Total amount spent on radio ads must not exceed $1,800.
Next, define the decision variables. The decisions being made here are the number of ads of each
type to use. Once these are known, they can be used to calculate the amount spent and the num-
ber of people reached. Let
Next, using these variables, write the mathematical expression for the objective and the con-
straint that were identified. The nonnegativity constraints are explicitly stated also.
Objective:
The solution to this can be found using Excel’s Solver. Program 8.1 gives the inputs to the
Solver Parameter dialog box, the formula that must be written in the cell for the objective func-
tion value, and the cells where this formula should be copied. The results are shown in the
spreadsheet. This solution is
TV spots
newspaper ads
30-second radio spots
one-minute radio spots
This produces an audience exposure of 67,240 contacts. Because 
and 
are fractional, Win
Big would probably round them to 2 and 6, respectively. Problems that demand all-integer solu-
tions are discussed in detail in Chapter 10.
Marketing Research
Linear programming has also been applied to marketing research problems and the area of con-
sumer research. The next example illustrates how statistical pollsters can reach strategy deci-
sions with LP.
Management Sciences Associates (MSA) is a marketing and computer research firm
based in Washington, D.C., that handles consumer surveys. One of its clients is a national press
service that periodically conducts political polls on issues of widespread interest. In a survey for
the press service, MSA determines that it must fulfill several requirements in order to draw sta-
tistically valid conclusions on the sensitive issue of new U.S. immigration laws:
1. Survey at least 2,300 U.S. households in total.
2. Survey at least 1,000 households whose heads are 30 years of age or younger.
3. Survey at least 600 households whose heads are between 31 and 50 years of age.

5. Ensure that no more than 20% of those surveyed who are 51 years of age or over live in a

MSA would like to meet the five sampling requirements at the least possible cost.
In formulating this as a linear program, the objective is to minimize cost. The five require-
ments about the number of people to be sampled with specific characteristics result in five con-
straints. The decision variables come from the decisions that must be made, which are the
number of people sampled from each of the two regions in each of the three age categories.
Thus, the six variables are
X6 = number surveyed who are 51 or older and do not live in a border state
X5 = number surveyed who are 31–50 and do not live in a border state
X4 = number surveyed who are 30 or younger and do not live in a border state
X3 = number surveyed who are 51 or older and live in a border state
X2 = number surveyed who are 31–50 and live in a border state

CHAPTER 8 • LINEAR PROGRAMMING APPLICATIONS
Production Mix
A fertile field for the use of LP is in planning for the optimal mix of products to manufacture.
A company must meet a myriad of constraints, ranging from financial concerns to sales demand
to material contracts to union labor demands. Its primary goal is to generate the largest profit
possible.
Fifth Avenue Industries, a nationally known manufacturer of menswear, produces four vari-
eties of ties. One is an expensive, all-silk tie, one is an all-polyester tie, one is a blend of poly-
ester and cotton, and one is a blend of silk and cotton. The following table illustrates the cost
and availability (per monthly production planning period) of the three materials used in the
production process:

TABLE 8.1
Data for Fifth Avenue Industries
The firm has fixed contracts with several major department store chains to supply ties. The con-
tracts require that Fifth Avenue Industries supply a minimum quantity of each tie but allow for a
larger demand if Fifth Avenue chooses to meet that demand. (Most of the ties are not shipped
with the name Fifth Avenue on their label, incidentally, but with “private stock” labels supplied
by the stores.) Table 8.1 summarizes the contract demand for each of the four styles of ties, the
selling price per tie, and the fabric requirements of each variety. Fifth Avenue’s goal is to maxi-
mize its monthly profit. It must decide upon a policy for product mix.
In formulating this problem, the objective is to maximize profit. There are three constraints
(one for each material) indicating that the amount of silk, polyester, and cotton cannot exceed
the amount that is available. There are four constraints (one for each type of tie) that specify that
the number of all silk ties, all polyester ties, poly–silk ties, and silk–cotton ties produced must
be at least the minimum contract amount. There are four more constraints (one for each type of
tie) that indicate that the number of each of these ties produced cannot exceed the monthly
demand. The variables are defined as
X4 = number of blend 2 silk–cotton ties
X3 = number of blend 1 poly–cotton ties
X2 = number of polyester ties
X1 = number of all-silk ties produced per month

8.3
MANUFACTURING APPLICATIONS
313
But first the firm must establish the profit per tie:
1. Each all-silk tie 
requires 0.125 yard of silk, at a cost of $24.00 per yard. Therefore,
the material cost per tie is $3.00. The selling price is $19.24, leaving a net profit of $16.24
per silk tie. 
2. Each all-polyester tie 
requires 0.08 yard of polyester, at a cost of $6 per yard. There-
fore, the material cost per tie is $0.48. The selling price is $8.70, leaving a net profit of
$8.22 per polyester tie. 
3. Each poly–cotton (blend 1) tie 
requires 0.05 yard of polyester, at a cost of $6 per
yard, and 0.05 yard of cotton, at $9 per yard, for a cost of 
per tie.
The selling price is $9.52, leaving a net profit of $8.77 per poly–cotton tie.
4. Performing similar calculations will show that each silk–cotton (blend 2) tie 
has a
material cost per tie of $1.98 and a profit of $8.66.
The objective function may now be stated as
Using Excel and its Solver command, the computer-generated solution is to produce 5,112 all-
silk ties each month; 14,000 all-polyester ties; 16,000 poly–cotton blend 1 ties; and 8,500
silk–cotton blend 2 ties. This produces a profit of $412,028 per production period. See
Program 8.3 for details.
Production Scheduling
Setting a low-cost production schedule over a period of weeks or months is a difficult and im-
portant management problem in most plants. The production manager has to consider many fac-
tors: labor capacity, inventory and storage costs, space limitations, product demand, and labor
relations. Because most companies produce more than one product, the scheduling process is
often quite complex.
Basically, the problem resembles the product mix model for each period in the future. The
objective is either to maximize profit or to minimize the total cost (production plus inventory) of
carrying out the task.
Production scheduling is amenable to solution by LP because it is a problem that must be
solved on a regular basis. When the objective function and constraints for a firm are established,
the inputs can easily be changed each month to provide an updated schedule.
Greenberg Motors, Inc., manufactures two different electrical motors for sale under con-
tract to Drexel Corp., a well-known producer of small kitchen appliances. Its model GM3A is
found in many Drexel food processors, and its model GM3B is used in the assembly of blenders.
Three times each year, the procurement officer at Drexel contracts Irwin Greenberg, the
founder of Greenberg Motors, to place a monthly order for each of the coming four months.
Drexel’s demand for motors varies each month based on its own sales forecasts, production
capacity, and financial position. Greenberg has just received the January–April order
and must begin his own four-month production plan. The demand for motors is shown in
Table 8.2.

CHAPTER 8 • LINEAR PROGRAMMING APPLICATIONS
Production planning at Greenberg Motors must consider several factors:
1. The company must meet the demand for each of the two products in each of the four
months (see Table 8.2). Also, the company would like to have 450 units of the GM3A and
300 units of the GM3B in inventory at the end of April, as demand in May is expected to
be somewhat higher than demand in the previous months.
2. There is a carrying, or holding, cost for any inventory left at the end of the month. So pro-
ducing too many extra units of either product may not be desirable. The carrying cost
assigned to the GM3A is $0.36 per unit per month, while the carrying cost for the GM3B is
$0.26 per unit per month.

3. The company has been able to maintain a no-layoff policy, and it would like to continue
with this. This is easier if the labor hours used do not fluctuate too much from month to
month. Maintaining a production schedule that would require from 2,240 to 2,560 labor
hours per month is desired. The GM3A requires 1.3 labor hours per unit, while the GM3B
requires only 0.9 labor hours.
4. Warehouse limitations cannot be exceeded without great additional costs. There is room at
the end of the month for only 3,300 units of the GM3A and GM3B combined.
Although these factors sometimes conflict, Greenberg has found that linear programming is an
effective tool in setting up a production schedule that will minimize total cost. Production costs
are currently $20 per unit for the GM3A and $15 per unit for the GM3B. However, each of these
is due to increase by 10% on March 1 as a new labor agreement goes into effect.
In formulating this as a linear program, it is important to understand how all the important
factors are related, how the costs are calculated, how the labor hours per month are calculated,
and how demand is met with both production and inventory on hand. To help with understand-
ing this, try to determine the number of labor hours used, the number of units left in inventory at
the end of each month for each product, and the total cost if exactly 1,000 of the GM3A and
exactly 1,200 of the GM3B were produced each month.
To begin formulating the linear program, the objective and the constraints are:
Objective:
Constraints:
The decisions involve determining how many units of each of 2 products to produce in each of
4 months, so there will be 8 variables. But, since the objective is to minimize cost, and there are
costs associated not only with the units produced each month but also with the number of units
of each left in inventory, it would be best to define variables for these also. Let
The objective function in the LP model is
In setting up the constraints, we must recognize the relationship between last month’s ending

While the constraints could be written in this form, inputting the problem into the computer re-
quires all variables to be on the left-hand side of the constraint. Rearranging the terms to do this
results in
Using this, the demand constraints are:
The constraints for the minimum and maximum number of labor hours each month are:
The storage capacity constraints are:
The solution was obtained using Solver in Excel 2010, as shown in Program 8.4. Some of the
variables are not integers, but this is not a problem because work in process can be carried over
from one month to the next. Table 8.3 summarizes the solution with the values rounded. The
total cost is about $169,295. Greenberg can use this model to develop production schedules
again in the future by letting the subscripts on the variables represent new months and making
minor changes to the problem. The only things in the model that would have to be changed are
the RHS values for the demand constraints (and inventory desired at the end of the fourth month)
and the objective function coefficients (costs) if they should change.

Labor Planning
Labor planning problems address staffing needs over a specific time period. They are espe-
cially useful when managers have some flexibility in assigning workers to jobs that require
overlapping or interchangeable talents. Large banks frequently use LP to tackle their labor
scheduling.

TABLE 8.4
Hong Kong Bank
of Commerce and
Industry
Hong Kong Bank of Commerce and Industry is a busy bank that has requirements for
between 10 and 18 tellers, depending on the time of day. The lunch time, from noon to 2 P.M.,
is usually heaviest. Table 8.4 indicates the workers needed at various hours that the bank
is open.
The bank now employs 12 full-time tellers, but many people are on its roster of avail-
able part-time employees. A part-time employee must put in exactly four hours per day but
can start anytime between 9 A.M. and 1 P.M. Part-timers are a fairly inexpensive labor pool,
since no retirement or lunch benefits are provided for them. Full-timers, on the other hand,
work from 9 A.M. to 5 P.M. but are allowed 1 hour for lunch. (Half of the full-timers eat at
11 A.M., the other half at noon.) Full-timers thus provide 35 hours per week of productive
labor time.
By corporate policy, the bank limits part-time hours to a maximum of 50% of the day’s to-
tal requirement. Part-timers earn $8 per hour (or $32 per day) on average, and full-timers earn
$100 per day in salary and benefits, on average. The bank would like to set a schedule that would
minimize its total personnel costs. It will release one or more of its full-time tellers if it is prof-
itable to do so.
In formulating this as a linear program, the objective is to minimize cost. There is a con-
straint for each hour of the day, stating that the number of people working at the bank during
that hour should be at least the minimum number shown in Table 8.4, so there are eight of these
constraints. Another constraint will limit the total number of full-time workers to be no more
than 12. The last constraint will specify that the number of part-time hours must not exceed 50%
of the total hours.
The bank must decide how many full-time tellers to use, so there will be one decision
variable for that. Similarly, the bank must decide about using part-time tellers, but this is more
complex as the part-time workers can start at different times of the day while all full-time
workers start at the beginning of the day. Thus, there must be a variable indicating the number
of part-time workers starting at each hour of the day from 9 A.M. until 1 P.M. Any worker who
starts at 1 P.M. will work until closing, so there is no need to consider having any part-time
workers start after that. Let
full-time tellers

Part-time worker hours cannot exceed 50% of total hours required each day, which is the sum of
the tellers needed each hour:

Program 8.5 gives the solution to this, found using Solver in Excel 2010. There are several

Financial Applications
Portfolio Selection
A problem frequently encountered by managers of banks, mutual funds, investment services,
and insurance companies is the selection of specific investments from among a wide variety of
alternatives. The manager’s overall objective is usually to maximize expected return on invest-
ment, given a set of legal, policy, or risk restraints.
For example, the International City Trust (ICT) invests in short-term trade credits, corpo-
rate bonds, gold stocks, and construction loans. To encourage a diversified portfolio, the board
of directors has placed limits on the amount that can be committed to any one type of invest-
ment. ICT has $5 million available for immediate investment and wishes to do two things:
(1) maximize the return on the investments made over the next six months and (2) satisfy the
diversification requirements as set by the board of directors.
Maximizing return on investment
subject to a set of risk
constraints is a popular financial
application of LP.

In addition, the board specifies that at least 55% of the funds invested must be in gold stocks

In formulating this as a linear program, the objective is to maximize the return. There are
four separate constraints limiting the maximum amount in each investment option to the

construction loans must be at least 55% of the total amount invested, and one constraint speci-

final constraint stipulates that the total amount invested cannot exceed $5 million (it could be
less). Define the variables as

Optimization at UPS
On an average day, UPS delivers 13 million packages to
almost 8 million customers in 200 countries and territories.
Deliveries are classified as same-day air, next-day air, and sec-
ond-day air. The next-day air operations average more than
1.1 million packages per day and generate annual revenue of
over $5 billion. The company has 256 aircraft and many more
on order. During the busiest time of year, between Thanksgiving
and New Year’s Day, the company leases additional aircraft to
meet the demand. The size of its fleet makes UPS the 9th-
largest commercial airline in the United States and the 11th-
largest commercial airline in the world.
In the next-day delivery operation, the pickup and delivery of
packages by UPS involves several stages. Packages are carried by
truck to ground centers. From there, the packages are taken to the
airport, and then they are flown to one of the airport hubs with at
most one stop at another airport to pick up more packages. At the
hub, the packages are sorted and loaded onto planes and flown
to the destination. Packages are then loaded on large trucks and
taken to ground centers. At the ground centers, additional sorting
is done, packages are put on smaller trucks, and the packages are
delivered to their final destinations before 10:30 A.M. The same
aircraft are used in the second-day deliveries as well, so these two
types of operations must be coordinated.
A team from UPS and Massachusetts Institute of Technology
worked together to develop an optimization-based planning sys-
tem called VOLCANO (Volume, Location, and Aircraft Network
Optimizer) that is used for planning and managing operations.
This group developed optimization methods to minimize overall
cost (ownership and operating) while meeting capacity and serv-
ice standard constraints. Mathematical models are used to deter-
mine the minimum cost set of routes, fleet assignments, and
package flows. Constraints include the number of aircraft, land-
ing restrictions at airports, and aircraft operating characteristics
(such as speed, capacity, and range).
The VOLCANO system is credited with saving over $87 mil-
lion from late in 2000 to the end of 2002. It is expected that $189
million will be saved over the next decade. This optimizer is also
used to identify the needed fleet composition and recommend
future aircraft acquisitions.

Truck Loading Problem
The truck loading problem involves deciding which items to load on a truck so as to maximize
the value of a load shipped. As an example, we consider Goodman Shipping, an Orlando firm
owned by Steven Goodman. One of his trucks, with a capacity of 10,000 pounds, is about to be
loaded.* Awaiting shipment are the following items:
X4 = $1,800,000,
X3 = $1,500,000,
X1 = $750,000, X2 = $950,000,

Each of these six items, we see, has an associated dollar value and weight.
The objective is to maximize the total value of the items loaded onto the truck without
exceeding the truck’s weight capacity. We let 
be the proportion of each item i loaded on the truck:
These final six constraints reflect the fact that at most one “unit” of an item can be loaded onto
the truck. In effect, if Goodman can load a portion of an item (say, item 1 is a batch of 1,000
folding chairs, not all of which need be shipped together), the 
will all be proportions ranging
from 0 (nothing) to 1 (all of that item loaded).
To solve this LP problem, we turn to Excel’s Solver. Program 8.7 shows Goodman’s Excel
formulation, input data, and the solution, which yields a total load value of $31,500.
The answer leads us to an interesting issue that we deal with in detail in Chapter 10. What
does Goodman do if fractional values of items cannot be loaded? For example, if luxury cars
were the items being loaded, we clearly cannot ship one-third of a Maserati.

CHAPTER 8 • LINEAR PROGRAMMING APPLICATIONS
If the proportion of item 1 was rounded up to 1.00, the weight of the load would increase to
15,000 pounds. This would violate the 10,000 pounds maximum weight constraint. Therefore,
the fraction of item 1 must be rounded down to zero. This would drop the value of the load to
7,500 pounds, leaving 2,500 pounds of the load capacity unused. Because no other item weighs
less than 2,500 pounds, the truck cannot be filled up further.
Thus, we see that by using regular LP and rounding the fractional weights, the truck would
carry only item 2, for a load weight of 7,500 pounds and a load value of $24,000.
QM for Windows and spreadsheet optimizers such as Excel’s Solver are capable of dealing
with integer programming problems as well; that is, LP problems requiring integer solutions.
Using Excel, the integer solution to Goodman’s problem is to load items 3, 4, and 6, for a total
weight of 10,000 pounds and load value of $27,250.

Ingredient Blending Applications
Diet Problems
The diet problem, one of the earliest applications of LP, was originally used by hospitals to de-
termine the most economical diet for patients. Known in agricultural applications as the feed
mix problem, the diet problem involves specifying a food or feed ingredient combination that
satisfies stated nutritional requirements at a minimum cost level.
The Whole Food Nutrition Center uses three bulk grains to blend a natural cereal that it sells
by the pound. The cost of each bulk grain and the protein, riboflavin, phosphorus, and magne-
sium units per pound of each are shown in Table 8.5.
On the packaging for each of its products, Whole Food indicates the nutritional content in
each bowl of cereal when eaten with 0.5 cup of milk. The USRDA (U.S. Recommended Dietary
Allowance) and the more recent DRI (Dietary Reference Intake) were consulted to establish
recommended amounts of certain vitamins and minerals for an average adult. Based on these
figures and the desired amounts for labeling on the package, Whole Food has determined that
each 2-ounce serving of the cereal should contain 3 units of protein, 2 units of riboflavin, 1 unit
of phosphorous, and 0.425 units of magnesium.
In modeling this as a linear program, the objective is to minimize cost. There will be four
constraints (one each for protein, riboflavin, phosphorous, and magnesium) stipulating that the
number of units must be at least the minimum amount specified. Since these requirements are
for each 2 ounce serving, the last constraint must say that the total amount of the grains used
will be 2 ounces, or 0.125 pounds.
In defining the variables, notice that the cost is expressed per pound of the three grains.
Thus, in order to calculate the total cost, we must know the number of pounds of the grains used
in one serving of the cereal. Also, the numbers in Table 8.5 are expressed in units per pound of
grain, so defining variables as the number of pounds of the grains makes it easier to calculate
the amounts of protein, riboflavin, phosphorous, and magnesium. We let
XC = pounds of grain C in one 2-ounce serving of cereal
XB = pounds of grain B in one 2-ounce serving of cereal
XA = pounds of grain A in one 2-ounce serving of cereal

The solution to this problem requires mixing together 0.025 lb of grain A, 0.050 lb of grain B,
and 0.050 lb of grain C. Another way of stating the solution is in terms of the proportion of the
2-ounce serving of each grain, namely, 0.4 ounce of grain A, 0.8 ounce of grain B, and 0.8 ounce
of grain C in each serving. The cost per serving is $0.05. Program 8.8 illustrates this solution
using Solver in Excel 2010.

Diet and feed mix problems are actually special cases of a more general class of LP problems
known as ingredient or blending problems. Blending problems arise when a decision must be
made regarding the blending of two or more resources to produce one or more products.

CHAPTER 8 • LINEAR PROGRAMMING APPLICATIONS
each final product contains specific percentages of each ingredient. The following example deals
with an application frequently seen in the petroleum industry, the blending of crude oils to pro-
duce refinable gasoline.
The Low Knock Oil Company produces two grades of cut-rate gasoline for industrial distri-
bution. The grades, regular and economy, are produced by refining a blend of two types of crude
oil, type X100 and type X220. Each crude oil differs not only in cost per barrel, but in composi-
tion as well. The following table indicates the percentage of crucial ingredients found in each of
the crude oils and the cost per barrel for each:
Major oil refineries all use LP for
blending crude oils to produce
gasoline grades.

Weekly demand for the regular grade of Low Knock gasoline is at least 25,000 barrels, and
demand for the economy is at least 32,000 barrels per week. At least 45% of each barrel of regu-
lar must be ingredient A. At most 50% of each barrel of economy should contain ingredient B.
While the gasoline yield from one barrel of crude depends on the type of crude and the type of
processing used, we will assume for the sake of this example that one barrel of crude oil will
yield one barrel of gasoline.
The Low Knock management must decide how many barrels of each type of crude oil to
buy each week for blending to satisfy demand at minimum cost. In modeling this as a linear pro-
gram, the objective is to minimize cost. Each of the two types of gasoline has a demand con-
straint, and each of the two types of gasoline has a constraint restricting the amount of the
ingredients. Thus, there are four constraints. The decisions involve the amount of each type of
crude to use in each type of gasoline, so these will be the decision variables. Let

Transportation Applications
Shipping Problem
The transportation or shipping problem involves determining the amount of goods or items to be
transported from a number of origins (or sources) to a number of destinations. The objective
usually is to minimize total shipping costs or distances. Constraints in this type of problem deal
with capacities at each origin and requirements at each destination. The transportation problem
is a very specific case of LP, and in fact, is one of the topics of Chapter 9.
The Top Speed Bicycle Co. manufactures and markets a line of 10-speed bicycles nation-
wide. The firm has final assembly plants in two cities in which labor costs are low, New Orleans
and Omaha. Its three major warehouses are located near the large market areas of New York,
Chicago, and Los Angeles.
The sales requirements for the next year at the New York warehouse are 10,000 bicycles, at
the Chicago warehouse 8,000 bicycles, and at the Los Angeles warehouse 15,000 bicycles. The
factory capacity at each location is limited. New Orleans can assemble and ship 20,000 bicycles;
Transporting goods from several
origins to several destinations
efficiently is called the
“transportation problem.” It can
be solved with LP, as we see here,
or with a special algorithm
introduced in Chapter 9.

The company wishes to develop a shipping schedule that will minimize its total annual trans-
portation costs.
Figure 8.1 provides a network representation of this problem. Each circle or node represents
a source or a destination in this problem. Each source and destination is numbered to facilitate
the variable definitions. Each arrow indicates a possible shipping route, and the cost per unit to
ship along each of these is shown also in Figure 8.1.
When formulating a linear program for this, the objective is to minimize the transporta-
tion costs. There are two supply constraints (one for each source): (1) No more than 20,000
can be shipped from New Orleans. (2) No more than 15,000 can be shipped from Omaha.
There are three demand constraints (one for each destination): (1) The total number shipped
to New York must equal 10,000. (2) The total number shipped to Chicago must equal 8,000.
(3) The total number shipped to Los Angeles must equal 15,000. The company must decide
how many bicycles to ship along each of the shipping routes (i.e., from each source to each
destination). In Figure 8.1, the arrows indicate where the items originate and where they are
delivered, and the shipping cost per unit is shown next to the arrow. The decisions are the
number of units to ship along each of these shipping routes. In defining the variables, it is eas-
iest to use double subscripts. Let
where 1 = New York, 2 = Chicago, and 3 = Los Angeles.2
and 2 = Omaha; j = 1, 2, 3,
Xij = number of units shipped from source i to destination j 1i = 1, 2, where 1 = New Orleans

329
The LP formulation is
The use of double subscripts helps to quickly see what the variable represents. If the second sub-
script is 1, then the destination is New York. In constraint 1, the total of the variables that have a
1 as the second subscript (i.e., the units that are being shipped to destination 1) must equal the
demand in New York. The network in Figure 8.1 makes this very clear. Observing the other vari-
able names and comparing them to the arrows in the network is a useful exercise.
Notice that every coefficient in front of a variable in the constraints is equal to 1. This trait
allows for the use of a specialized algorithm which results in even faster solution times. There
are two other linear programming models that are closely related to the transportation model and
have coefficients of 1 in the constraints. These two models are for the assignment problem and
the transshipment problem. Both of these will be discussed in Chapter 9, and the linear program-
ming formulations will be presented there.
Using Excel and its Solver command, the computer-generated solution to Top Speed’s prob-
lem is shown in the table that follows and in Program 8.10. The total shipping cost is $96,000.

CHAPTER 8 • LINEAR PROGRAMMING APPLICATIONS
Summary
In this chapter we continued our discussion of linear program-
ming models. The basic steps for formulating a linear program
were followed for a variety of problems. These included appli-
cations in marketing, production scheduling, finance, ingredi-
ent blending, and transportation. Attention was paid to
understanding the problem, identifying the objective and the
constraints, defining the decision variables, and developing the
mathematical model from these.
In future chapters, additional applications of linear pro-
gramming will be presented. The transportation problem seen
in this chapter will be further discussed in Chapter 9, along
with two other closely related applications: the assignment
problem and the transshipment problem.

cerning production times per cabinet produced and
production capacities for each operation per day,
along with net revenue per unit produced. The firm

stocks and bonds they believe are well rated, but
within the following guidelines:
(a) Municipal bonds should constitute at least 20%
of the investment.
(b) At least 40% of the funds should be placed in a
combination of electronic firms, aerospace firms,
and drug manufacturers.
(c) No more than 50% of the amount invested in

8-4 (Animal feed mix problem) The Battery Park Stable
feeds and houses the horses used to pull tourist-filled
carriages through the streets of Charleston’s historic
waterfront area. The stable owner, an ex-racehorse
trainer, recognizes the need to set a nutritional diet for
the horses in his care. At the same time, he would like
to keep the overall daily cost of feed to a minimum.
The feed mixes available for the horses’ diet are
an oat product, a highly enriched grain, and a mineral
product. Each of these mixes contains a certain
amount of five ingredients needed daily to keep the
average horse healthy. The table on this page shows
these minimum requirements, units of each ingredient
per pound of feed mix, and costs for the three mixes.
In addition, the stable owner is aware that an
overfed horse is a sluggish worker. Consequently, he
determines that 6 pounds of feed per day are the
most that any horse needs to function properly. For-
mulate this problem and solve for the optimal daily
mix of the three feeds.

8-6 Eddie Kelly is running for reelection as mayor of a
small town in Alabama. Jessica Martinez, Kelly’s
campaign manager during this election, is planning
the marketing campaign, and there is some stiff
competition. Martinez has selected four ways to ad-
vertise: television ads, radio ads, billboards, and
newspaper ads. The costs of these, the audience
reached by each type of ad, and the maximum num-
ber of each is shown in the following table:
six months. Sundown leases cars from an automobile
manufacturer and then rents them to the public on a
daily basis. A forecast of the demand for Sundown’s

In addition, Martinez has decided that there
should be at least six ads on TV or radio or some
combination of those two. The amount spent on bill-
boards and newspapers together must not exceed the
amount spent on TV ads. While fundraising is still
continuing, the monthly budget for advertising has
been set at $15,000. How many ads of each type
should be placed to maximize the total number of
people reached?
8-7 (Media selection problem) The advertising director
for Diversey Paint and Supply, a chain of four retail
stores on Chicago’s North Side, is considering two
media possibilities. One plan is for a series of half-
page ads in the Sunday Chicago Tribune newspaper,
and the other is for advertising time on Chicago TV.
The stores are expanding their lines of do-it-yourself
tools, and the advertising director is interested in an
exposure level of at least 40% within the city’s neigh-
borhoods and 60% in northwest suburban areas.
The TV viewing time under consideration has
an exposure rating per spot of 5% in city homes and
3% in the northwest suburbs. The Sunday newspaper
has corresponding exposure rates of 4% and 3% per
ad. The cost of a half-page Tribune advertisement is
$925; a television spot costs $2,000.
Diversey Paint would like to select the least
costly advertising strategy that would meet desired
exposure levels.

Cars may be leased from the manufacturer for
either three, four, or five months. These are leased
on the first day of the month and are returned on the
last day of the month. Every six months the automo-
bile manufacturer is notified by Sundown about the
number of cars needed during the next six months.
The automobile manufacturer has stipulated that at
least 50% of the cars leased during a six-month
period must be on the five-month lease. The cost per
month on each of the three types of leases are $420
for the three-month lease, $400 for the four-month
lease, and $370 for the five-month lease.
Currently, Sundown has 390 cars. The lease on
120 cars expires at the end of March. The lease on
another 140 cars expires at the end of April, and the
lease on the rest of these expires at the end of May.
Use LP to determine how many cars should be
leased in each month on each type of lease to mini-
mize the cost of leasing over the six-month period.
How many cars are left at the end of August?
8-9 Management of Sundown Rent-a-Car (see Problem
8-8) has decided that perhaps the cost during the six-
month period is not the appropriate cost to minimize
because the agency may still be obligated to addi-
tional months on some leases after that time. For ex-
ample, if Sundown had some cars delivered at the
beginning of the sixth month, Sundown would still
be obligated for two additional months on a three-
month lease. Use LP to determine how many cars
should be leased in each month on each type of lease
to minimize the cost of leasing over the entire life of
these leases.
8-10 (High school busing problem) The Arden County,
Maryland, superintendent of education is responsi-
ble for assigning students to the three high schools
in his county. He recognizes the need to bus a certain
number of students, for several sectors of the county
are beyond walking distance to a school. The super-
intendent partitions the county into five geographic
sectors as he attempts to establish a plan that will
minimize the total number of student miles traveled
by bus. He also recognizes that if a student happens
to live in a certain sector and is assigned to the high
school in that sector, there is no need to bus that stu-
dent because he or she can walk to school. The three
schools are located in sectors B, C, and E.

dents. For an evening meal, she feels that the
following five meal-content requirements should be
met: (1) between 900 and 1,500 calories; (2) at least
4 milligrams of iron; (3) no more than 50 grams of
fat; (4) at least 26 grams of protein; and (5) no more
than 50 grams of carbohydrates. On a particular day,
Roniger’s food stock includes seven items that can be
prepared and served for supper to meet these require-
ments. The cost per pound for each food item and the
contribution to each of the five nutritional require-
ments are given in the table below.
What combination and amounts of food items
will provide the nutrition Roniger requires at the

tive maintenance and may be used only 100 hours
each week. The market for all six computer compo-

recordkeeping, and daily radiation health scans.) Pol-
icy at South Central Utilities also dictates that layoffs
are not acceptable in those months when the nuclear
plant is overstaffed. So, if more trained employees are
available than are needed in any month, each worker is
still fully paid, even though he or she is not required to
work the 130 hours.
Training new employees is an important and
costly procedure. It takes one month of one-on-one
classroom instruction before a new technician is per-
mitted to work alone in the reactor facility. There-
fore, South Central must hire trainees one month
before they are actually needed. Each trainee teams
up with a skilled nuclear technician and requires 90
hours of that employee’s time, meaning that 90
hours less of the technician’s time are available that
month for actual reactor work.
Personnel department records indicate a turnover
rate of trained technicians at 5% per month. In other
words, about 5% of the skilled employees at the start
of any month resign by the end of that month. A
trained technician earns an average monthly salary of
$2,000 (regardless of the number of hours worked, as
noted earlier). Trainees are paid $900 during their one
month of instruction.

(b) Solve the problem. How many trainees must be-
gin each month?

8-18 (Hospital expansion problem) Mt. Sinai Hospital in
New Orleans is a large, private, 600-bed facility,
complete with laboratories, operating rooms, and
x-ray equipment. In seeking to increase revenues,
Mt. Sinai’s administration has decided to make a 90-
bed addition on a portion of adjacent land currently
used for staff parking. The administrators feel that
the labs, operating rooms, and x-ray department are
not being fully utilized at present and do not need to
be expanded to handle additional patients. The addi-
tion of 90 beds, however, involves deciding how
many beds should be allocated to the medical staff
for medical patients and how many to the surgical
staff for surgical patients.
The hospital’s accounting and medical records
departments have provided the following pertinent
information. The average hospital stay for a medical
patient is 8 days, and the average medical patient
generates $2,280 in revenues. The average surgical
patient is in the hospital 5 days and receives a
$1,515 bill. The laboratory is capable of handling
15,000 tests per year more than it was handling. The
average medical patient requires 3.1 lab tests and the
average surgical patient takes 2.6 lab tests. Further-
more, the average medical patient uses one x-ray,
whereas the average surgical patient requires two
x-rays. If the hospital was expanded by 90 beds, the
x-ray department could handle up to 7,000 x-rays
without significant additional cost. Finally, the
administration estimates that up to 2,800 additional
operations could be performed in existing operating

Margaret’s best estimate is that she can sell
wheat at a net profit of $2 per bushel, alfalfa at $40

yields an average of 1.5 tons of alfalfa and 2.2 tons of
barley. The wheat yield is approximately 50 bushels
per acre.

(b) What should the crop plan be, and what profit
will it yield?

8-20 In the Low Knock Oil Company blending problem,
it was assumed that one barrel of crude would result
in one barrel of gasoline as the final product. In pro-
cessing one barrel of crude, a typical gasoline yield
is about 0.46 barrels, although it could be higher or
lower than this, depending on the particular crude
and processing used. However, other products such
as diesel, jet fuel, home fuel oil, and asphalt also
come from that same barrel. Assuming that only
46% of the crude turns into gasoline, modify the
Low Knock Oil Company linear programming ex-
ample to account for this. Solve the resulting LP
problem, using any computer software.
8-21 (Hospital food transportation problem) Northeast
General, a large hospital in Providence, Rhode
Island, has initiated a new procedure to ensure that
patients receive their meals while the food is still as
hot as possible. The hospital will continue to prepare
the food in its kitchen but will now deliver it in bulk
(not individual servings) to one of three new serving
stations in the building. From there, the food will be
reheated and meals will be placed on individual
trays, loaded onto a cart, and distributed to the vari-
ous floors and wings of the hospital.
The three new serving stations are as efficiently
located as possible to reach the various hallways in
the hospital. The number of trays that each station
can serve are indicated in the table:

The purpose of the new procedure is to increase

ceives. Therefore, the amount of time needed to de-
liver a tray from a serving station will determine the
proper distribution of food from serving station to

channel.

8-22 (Portfolio selection problem) Daniel Grady is the
financial advisor for a number of professional ath-
letes. An analysis of the long-term goals for many of
these athletes has resulted in a recommendation to
purchase stocks with some of their income that is set
aside for investments. Five stocks have been identi-
fied as having very favorable expectations for future
performance. Although the expected return is impor-
tant in these investments, the risk, as measured by
the beta of the stock, is also important. (A high value
of beta indicates that the stock has a relatively high

risk.) The expected return and the betas for five
stocks are as follows:
of getting from one city to another. In evaluating one
particular flight rotation, a plane begins in Atlanta,
flies from Atlanta to Los Angeles, from Los Ange-
les to Houston, from Houston to New Orleans, and
from New Orleans to Atlanta. When the plane ar-
rives in Atlanta, the flight rotation is said to have
been completed, and then it starts again. Thus, the
fuel on board when the flight arrived in Atlanta must
be taken into consideration when the flight begins.
Along each leg of this route, there is a minimum and
a maximum amount of fuel that may be carried. This
and additional information is provided in the table
on this page.
The regular fuel consumption is based on the
plane carrying the minimum amount of fuel. If more
than this is carried, the amount of fuel consumed is
higher. Specifically, for each 1,000 gallons of fuel
above the minimum, 5% (or 50 gallons per 1,000
gallons of extra fuel) is lost due to excess fuel con-
sumption. For example, if 25,000 gallons of fuel
were on board when the plane takes off from At-
lanta, the fuel consumed on this route would be
thousand gallons. If 26 thou-
sand gallons were on board, the fuel consumed
would be increased by another 0.05 thousand, for a
total of 12.1 thousand gallons.
Formulate this as an LP problem to minimize
the cost. How many gallons should be purchased in
each city? What is the total cost of this?

Daniel would like to minimize the beta of the stock

no more than 35% of the portfolio should be in-
vested in any one stock.
(a) Formulate this as a linear program. (Hint: Define
the variables to be the proportion of the total in-

Case Study
Chase Manhattan Bank
The workload in many areas of bank operations has the charac-
teristics of a nonuniform distribution with respect to time of day.
For example, at Chase Manhattan Bank in New York, the number
of domestic money transfer requests received from customers, if
plotted against time of day, would appear to have the shape of an
inverted U curve with the peak around 1 P.M. For efficient use of
resources, the personnel available should, therefore, vary corre-
spondingly. Figure 8.2 shows a typical workload curve and corre-
sponding personnel requirements at different hours of the day.
A variable capacity can be achieved effectively by employ-
ing part-time personnel. Because part-timers are not entitled to
all the fringe benefits, they are often more economical than full-
time employees. Other considerations, however, may limit the
extent to which part-time people can be hired in a given depart-
ment. The problem is to find an optimum workforce schedule
that would meet personnel requirements at any given time and
also be economical.
Some of the factors affecting personnel assignment are
listed here:
1. By corporate policy, part-time personnel hours are limited to
a maximum of 40% of the day’s total requirement.
2. Full-time employees work for 8 hours (1 hour for lunch
included) per day. Thus, a full-timer’s productive time is 35
hours per week.
3. Part-timers work for at least 4 hours per day but less than 8
hours and are not allowed a lunch break.
4. Fifty percent of the full-timers go to lunch between 11 A.M.
and noon, and the remaining 50% go between noon and 1 P.M.
5. The shift starts at 9 A.M. and ends at 7 P.M. (i.e., overtime is
limited to 2 hours). Any work left over at 7 P.M. is considered
holdover for the next day.
6. A full-time employee is not allowed to work more than
5 hours overtime per week. He or she is paid at the normal
rate for overtime hours—not at one-and-a-half times the nor-
mal rate applicable to hours in excess of 40 per week. Fringe
benefits are not applied to overtime hours.
In addition, the following costs are pertinent:
1. The average cost per full-time personnel hour (fringe benefits
included) is $10.11.
2. The average cost per overtime personnel hour for full-timers
(straight rate excluding fringe benefits) is $8.08.
3. The average cost per part-time personnel hour is $7.82.
The personnel hours required, by hour of day, are given in
Table 8.9.
The bank’s goal is to achieve the minimum possible per-
sonnel cost subject to meeting or exceeding the hourly work-
force requirements as well as the constraints on the workers
listed earlier.
Discussion Questions
1. What is the minimum-cost schedule for the bank?
2. What are the limitations of the model used to answer
question 1?
3. Costs might be reduced by relaxing the constraint that no
more than 40% of the day’s requirement be met by part-
timers. Would changing the 40% to a higher value signifi-
cantly reduce costs?

Introduction
In this chapter we explore three special types of linear programming problems—the transporta-
tion problem (first introduced in Chapter 8), the assignment problem, and the transshipment
problem. All these may be modeled as network flow problems, with the use of nodes (points)
and arcs (lines). Additional network models will be discussed in Chapter 11.
This first part of this chapter will explain these problems, provide network representations
for them, and provide linear programming models for them. The solutions will be found using
standard linear programming software. The transportation and assignment problems have a spe-
cial structure that enables them to be solved with very efficient algorithms. The latter part of the
chapter will present the special algorithms for solving them.
9.2
The Transportation Problem
The transportation problem deals with the distribution of goods from several points of supply
(origins or sources) to a number of points of demand (destinations). Usually we are given a ca-
pacity (supply) of goods at each source, a requirement (demand) for goods at each destination,
and the shipping cost per unit from each source to each destination. An example is shown in
Figure 9.1. The objective of such a problem is to schedule shipments so that total transportation
costs are minimized. At times, production costs are included also.
Transportation models can also be used when a firm is trying to decide where to locate a
new facility. Before opening a new warehouse, factory, or sales office, it is good practice to con-
sider a number of alternative sites. Good financial decisions concerning the facility location also
attempt to minimize total transportation and production costs for the entire system.
Linear Program for the Transportation Example 
The Executive Furniture Corporation is faced with the transportation problem shown in Figure 9.1.
The company would like to minimize the transportation costs while meeting the demand at
each destination and not exceeding the supply at each source. In formulating this as a linear
342

THE TRANSPORTATION PROBLEM

program, there are three supply constraints (one for each source) and three demand constraints
(one for each destination). The decisions to be made are the number of units to ship on each
route, so there is one decision variable for each arc (arrow) in the network. Let
number of units shipped from source i to destination j

subject to

(Evansville supply)
(Fort Lauderdale supply)
(Albuquerque demand)
(Boston demand)
(Cleveland demand)
for all i and j
The solution to this LP problem could be found using Solver in Excel 2010 by putting these con-
straints into a spreadsheet, as discussed in Chapter 7. However, the special structure of this prob-
lem allows for an easier and more intuitive format, as shown in Program 9.1. Solver is still used,
but since all the constraint coefficients are 1 or 0, the left-hand side of each constraint is simply
the sum of the variables from a particular source or to a particular destination. In Program 9.1
these are cells E10:E12 and B13:D13.
A General LP Model for Transportation Problems 
In this example, there were 3 sources and 3 destinations. The LP had 
variables and
constraints. In general, for a transportation problem with m sources and n destina-
tion, the number of variables is mn, and the number of constraints is 
For example, if
there are 5 (i.e., 
) constraints and 8 (i.e., 
) variables, the linear program would have
variables and 
constraints.
The use of the double subscripts on the variables makes the general form of the linear pro-
gram for a transportation problem with m sources and n destinations easy to express. Let

The Assignment Problem
The assignment problem refers to the class of LP problem that involve determining the most
efficient assignment of people to projects, sales people to territories, auditors to companies for
audits, contracts to bidders, jobs to machines, heavy equipment (such as cranes) to construction
jobs, and so on. The objective is most often to minimize total costs or total time of performing
the tasks at hand. One important characteristic of assignment problems is that only one job or
worker is assigned to one machine or project.
Figure 9.2 provides a network representation of an assignment problem. Notice that this
network is very similar to the network for the transportation problem. In fact, an assignment
problem may be viewed as a special type of transportation problem in which the supply at each
source and the demand at each destination must equal one. Each person may only be assigned to
one job or project, and each job only needs one person.
An assignment problem is
equivalent to a transportation
problem with each supply and
demand equal to 1.

The network in Figure 9.2 represents a problem faced by the Fix-It Shop, which has just
received three new repair projects that must be completed quickly: (1) a radio, (2) a toaster oven,
and (3) a coffee table. Three repair persons, each with different talents, are available to do the
jobs. The shop owner estimates the cost in wages if the workers are assigned to each of the three
projects. The costs differ due to the talents of each worker on each of the jobs. The owner wishes
to assign the jobs so that total cost is minimized and each job must have one person assigned to
it, and each person can only be assigned to one job.
In formulating this as a linear program, the general LP form of the transportation problem
can be used. In defining the variables, let

The Transshipment Problem
In a transportation problem, if the items being transported must go through an intermediate point
(called a transshipment point) before reaching a final destination, the problem is called a
transshipment problem. For example, a company might be manufacturing a product at several
factories to be shipped to a set of regional distribution centers. From these centers, the items are

In the assignment problem, the variables are required to be either 0 or 1. Due to the special
structure of this problem with the constraint coefficients as 0 or 1 and all the right-hand-side val-
ues equal to 1, the problem can be solved as a linear program. The solution to such a problem (if
one exists) will always have the variables equal to 0 or 1. There are other types of problems
where the use of such 0–1 variables is desired, but the solution to such problems using normal
linear programming methods will not necessarily have only zeros and ones. In such cases, spe-
cial methods must be used to force the variables to be either 0 or 1, and this will be discussed as
a special type of integer programming problem which will be seen in Chapter 10.

shipped to retail outlets that are the final destinations. Figure 9.3 provides a network representa-
tion of a transshipment problem. In this example, there are two sources, two transshipment
points, and three final destinations.
Linear Program for Transshipment Example
Frosty Machines manufactures snow blowers in factories located in Toronto and Detroit. These
are shipped to regional distribution centers in Chicago and Buffalo, where they are delivered to
the supply houses in New York, Philadelphia, and St. Louis, as illustrated in Figure 9.3.
The available supplies at the factories, the demands at the final destination, and shipping
costs are shown in the Table 9.1. Notice that snow blowers may not be shipped directly from
Toronto or Detroit to any of the final destinations but must first go to either Chicago or Buffalo.
This is why Chicago and Buffalo are listed not only as destinations but also as sources.
Frosty would like to minimize the transportation costs associated with shipping suffi-
cient snow blowers to meet the demands at the three destinations while not exceeding the
supply at each factory. Thus, we have supply and demand constraints similar to the trans-
portation problem, but we also have one constraint for each transshipment point indicating
that anything shipped from these to a final destination must have been shipped into that
transshipment point from one of the sources. The verbal statement of this problem would be
as follows:

The decision variables should represent the number of units shipped from each source to each

The Transportation Algorithm
The transportation algorithm is an iterative procedure in which a solution to a transportation
problem is found and evaluated using a special procedure to determine whether the solution is
optimal. If it is optimal, the process stops. If it is not optimal, a new solution is generated. This
new solution is at least as good as the previous one, and it is usually better. This new solution is
then evaluated, and if it is not optimal, another solution is generated. The process continues un-
til the optimal solution is found.

CHAPTER 9 • TRANSPORTATION AND ASSIGNMENT MODELS
Balanced supply and demand
occurs when total demand equals
total supply.
We will illustrate this process using the Executive Furniture Corporation example shown in
Figure 9.1. This is presented again in a special format in Table 9.2.
We see in Table 9.2 that the total factory supply available is exactly equal to the total ware-
house demand. When this situation of equal demand and supply occurs (something that is rather
unusual in real life), a balanced problem is said to exist. Later in this chapter we take a look at
how to deal with unbalanced problems, namely, those in which destination requirements may be
greater than or less than origin capacities.
Developing an Initial Solution: Northwest Corner Rule
When the data have been arranged in tabular form, we must establish an initial feasible solution
to the problem. One systematic procedure, known as the northwest corner rule, requires that
we start in the upper-left-hand cell (or northwest corner) of the table and allocate units to ship-
ping routes as follows:
1. Exhaust the supply (factory capacity) at each row before moving down to the next row.
2. Exhaust the (warehouse) requirements of each column before moving to the right to the
next column.
3. Check that all supply and demands are met.
We can now use the northwest corner rule to find an initial feasible solution to the Execu-
tive Furniture Corporation problem shown in Table 9.2.
The use of transportation models to minimize the cost of ship-
ping from a number of sources to a number of destinations was
first proposed in 1941. This study, called “The Distribution of a
Product from Several Sources to Numerous Localities,” was written
by F. L. Hitchcock. Six years later, T. C. Koopmans independently
produced the second major contribution, a report titled “Opti-
mum Utilization of the Transportation System.” In 1953, 
A. Charnes and W. W. Cooper developed the stepping-stone
method, an algorithm discussed in detail in this chapter. The
modified-distribution (MODI) method, a quicker computational
approach, came about in 1955.

THE TRANSPORTATION ALGORITHM
351
It takes five steps in this example to make the initial shipping assignments (see Table 9.3):
1. Beginning the upper-left-hand corner, we assign 100 units from Des Moines to
Albuquerque. This exhausts the capacity or supply at the Des Moines factory. But it still
leaves the warehouse at Albuquerque 200 desks short. Move down to the second row in the
same column.
2. Assign 200 units from Evansville to Albuquerque. This meets Albuquerque’s demand for a
total of 300 desks. The Evansville factory has 100 units remaining, so we move to the right
to the next column of the second row.
3. Assign 100 units from Evansville to Boston. The Evansville supply has now been
exhausted, but Boston’s warehouse is still short by 100 desks. At this point, we move down
vertically in the Boston column to the next row.
4. Assign 100 units from Fort Lauderdale to Boston. This shipment will fulfill Boston’s
demand for a total of 200 units. We note, though, that the Fort Lauderdale factory still has
200 units available that have not been shipped.
5. Assign 200 units from Fort Lauderdale to Cleveland. This final move exhausts Cleveland’s
demand and Fort Lauderdale’s supply. This always happens with a balanced problem. The
initial shipment schedule is now complete.
We can easily compute the cost of this shipping assignment:

This solution is feasible since demand and supply constraints are all satisfied. It was also very
quick and easy to reach. However, we would be very lucky if this solution yielded the optimal
transportation cost for the problem, because this route-loading method totally ignored the costs
of shipping over each of the routes.
Here is an explanation of the five
steps needed to make an initial
shipping assignment for
Executive Furniture.
A feasible solution is reached
when all demand and supply
constraints are met.

352
CHAPTER 9 • TRANSPORTATION AND ASSIGNMENT MODELS
After the initial solution has been found, it must be evaluated to see if it is optimal. We com-
pute an improvement index for each empty cell using the stepping-stone method. If this indi-
cates a better solution is possible, we use the stepping-stone path to move from this solution to
improved solutions until we find an optimal solution.
Stepping-Stone Method: Finding a Least-Cost Solution
The stepping-stone method is an iterative technique for moving from an initial feasible solu-
tion to an optimal feasible solution. This process has two distinct parts: The first involves testing
the current solution to determine if improvement is possible, and the second part involves
making changes to the current solution in order to obtain an improved solution. This process
continues until the optimal solution is reached.
For the stepping-stone method to be applied to a transportation problem, one rule about the
number of shipping routes being used must first be observed: The number of occupied routes (or
squares) must always be equal to one less than the sum of the number of rows plus the number
of columns. In the Executive Furniture problem, this means that the initial solution must have
squares used. Thus
When the number of occupied routes is less than this, the solution is called degenerate.
Later in this chapter we talk about what to do if the number of used squares is less than the num-
ber of rows plus the number of columns minus 1.
TESTING THE SOLUTION FOR POSSIBLE IMPROVEMENT How does the stepping-stone method
work? Its approach is to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of shipping goods via transportation
routes not currently in the solution. Each unused shipping route (or square) in the transporta-
tion table is tested by asking the following question: “What would happen to total shipping
costs if one unit of our product (in our example, one desk) were tentatively shipped on an un-
used route?”
This testing of each unused square is conducted using the following five steps:
Five Steps to Test Unused Squares with the Stepping-Stone Method
1. Select an unused square to be evaluated.
2. Beginning at this square, trace a closed path back to the original square via squares that are
currently being used and moving with only horizontal and vertical moves.
3. Beginning with a plus 
sign at the unused square, place alternate minus 
signs and
plus signs on each corner square of the closed path just traced.
4. Calculate an improvement index by adding together the unit cost figures found in each
square containing a plus sign and then subtracting the unit costs in each square containing
a minus sign.
5. Repeat steps 1 to 4 until an improvement index has been calculated for all unused squares.
If all indices computed are greater than or equal to zero, an optimal solution has been
reached. If not, it is possible to improve the current solution and decrease total shipping
costs.
To see how the stepping-stone method works, let us apply these steps to the Executive Fur-
niture Corporation data in Table 9.3 to evaluate unused shipping routes. The four currently unas-
signed routes are Des Moines to Boston, Des Moines to Cleveland, Evansville to Cleveland, and
Fort Lauderdale to Albuquerque.
Steps 1 and 2. Beginning with the Des Moines–Boston route, we first trace a closed path using
only currently occupied squares (see Table 9.4) and then place alternate plus signs and minus
signs in the corners of this path. To indicate more clearly the meaning of a closed path, we see
that only squares currently used for shipping can be used in turning the corners of the route
(-)
(+)
 5 = 3 + 3 - 1
 Occupied shipping routes (squares) = Number of rows + Number of columns - 1
3 + 3 - 1 = 5
The stepping-stone method
involves testing each unused
route to see if shipping one unit
on that route would increase or
decrease total costs.
Note that every row and every
column will have either two
changes or no changes.
Closed paths are used to trace
alternate plus and minus signs.

9.5
THE TRANSPORTATION ALGORITHM
353
Defining the Problem
The sugar market has been in a crisis for over a decade. Low sugar prices and decreasing demand have
added to an already unstable market. Sugar producers needed to minimize costs. They targeted the largest
unit cost in the manufacturing of raw sugar contributor—namely, sugar cane transportation costs.
Developing a Model
To solve this problem, researchers developed a linear program with some integer decision variables (e.g., num-
ber of trucks) and some continuous (linear) variables and linear decision variables (e.g., tons of sugar cane).
Acquiring Input Data
In developing the model, the inputs gathered were the operating demands of the sugar mills involved, the
capacities of the intermediary storage facilities, the per-unit transportation costs per route, and the pro-
duction capacities of the various sugar cane fields.
Testing the Solution
The researchers involved first tested a small version of their mathematical formulation using a spreadsheet.
After noting encouraging results, they implemented the full version of their model on large computer. Re-
sults were obtained for this very large and complex model (on the order of 40,000 decision variables and
10,000 constraints) in just a few milliseconds.
Analyzing the Results
The solution obtained contained information on the quantity of cane delivered to each sugar mill, the field
where cane should be collected, and the means of transportation (by truck, by train, etc.), and several
other vital operational attributes.
Implementing the Results
While solving such large problems with some integer variables might have been impossible only a decade
ago, solving these problems now is certainly possible. To implement these results, the researchers worked
to develop a more user-friendly interface so that managers would have no problem using this model to
help make decisions.

MODELING IN THE REAL WORLD
Moving Sugar Cane in Cuba
being traced. Hence the path Des Moines–Boston to Des Moines–Albuquerque to Fort
Lauderdale–Albuquerque to Fort Lauderdale–Boston to Des Moines–Boston would not be
acceptable since the Fort Lauderdale–Albuquerque square is currently empty. It turns out that
only one closed route is possible for each square we wish to test.
Step 3. How do we decide which squares are given plus signs and which minus signs? The
answer is simple. Since we are testing the cost-effectiveness of the Des Moines–Boston shipping
route, we pretend we are shipping one desk from Des Moines to Boston. This is one more unit
than we were sending between the two cities, so we place a plus sign in the box. But if we ship
one more unit than before from Des Moines to Boston, we end up sending 101 desks out of the
Des Moines factory.
That factory’s capacity is only 100 units; hence we must ship one fewer desks from Des
Moines–Albuquerque—this change is made to avoid violating the factory capacity constraint.
To indicate that the Des Moines–Albuquerque shipment has been reduced, we place a minus
sign in its box. Continuing along the closed path, we notice that we are no longer meeting the
Albuquerque warehouse requirement for 300 units. In fact, if the Des Moines–Albuquerque
shipment is reduced to 99 units, the Evansville–Albuquerque load has to be increased by 1 unit,

to 201 desks. Therefore, we place a plus sign in that box to indicate the increase. Finally, we
note that if the Evansville–Albuquerque route is assigned 201 desks, the Evansville–Boston
route must be reduced by 1 unit, to 99 desks, to maintain the Evansville factory capacity con-
straint of 300 units. Thus, a minus sign is placed in the Evansville–Boston box. We observe in
Table 9.4 that all four routes on the closed path are thereby balanced in terms of demand-and-
supply limitations.
Step 4. An improvement index
for the Des Moines–Boston route is now computed by
adding unit costs in squares with plus signs and subtracting costs in squares with minus signs.
Hence
Does Moines–Boston index
This means that for every desk shipped via the Des Moines–Boston route, total transportation
costs will increase by $3 over their current level.
Step 5. Let us now examine the Des Moines–Cleveland unused route, which is slightly more
difficult to trace with a closed path. Again, you will notice that we turn each corner along the path
only at squares that represent existing routes. The path can go through the Evansville–Cleveland
box but cannot turn a corner or place a 
or 
sign there. Only an occupied square may be used as
a stepping stone (Table 9.5).
The closed path we use is 
Des Moines—Cleveland improvement index 
Thus, opening this route will also not lower our total shipping costs.

THE TRANSPORTATION ALGORITHM
355
The other two routes may be evaluated in a similar fashion:
Evansville–Cleveland index
Fort Lauderdale–Albuquerque index
Because this last improvement index 
is negative, a cost savings may be attained by mak-
ing use of the (currently unused) Fort Lauderdale–Albuquerque route.
OBTAINING AN IMPROVED SOLUTION Each negative index computed by the stepping-stone
method represents the amount by which total transportation costs could be decreased if 1 unit or
product were shipped on that route. We found only one negative index in the Executive Furni-
ture problem, that being 
on the Fort Lauderdale factory–Albuquerque warehouse route. If,
however, there were more than one negative improvement index, our strategy would be to
choose the route (unused square) with the negative index indicating the largest improvement.
The next step, then, is to ship the maximum allowable number of units (or desks, in our
case) on the new route (Fort Lauderdale to Albuquerque). What is the maximum quantity that
can be shipped on the money-saving route? That quantity is found by referring to the closed path
of plus signs and minus signs drawn for the route and selecting the smallest number found in
those squares containing minus signs. To obtain a new solution, that number is added to all
squares on the closed path with plus signs and subtracted from all squares on the path assigned
minus signs. All other squares are unchanged.
Let us see how this process can help improve Executive Furniture’s solution. We repeat the
transportation table (Table 9.6) for the problem. Note that the stepping-stone route for Fort
Lauderdale to Albuquerque (F–A) is drawn in. The maximum quantity that can be shipped on
the newly opened route (F–A) is the smallest number found in squares containing minus signs—
in this case, 100 units. Why 100 units? Since the total cost decreases by $2 per unit shipped, we
know we would like to ship the maximum possible number of units. Table 9.6 indicates that each
unit shipped over the F–A route results in an increase of 1 unit shipped from E to B and a de-
crease of 1 unit in both the amounts shipped from F to B (now 100 units) and from E to A (now
200 units). Hence, the maximum we can ship over the F–A route is 100. This results in 0 units
being shipped from F to B.

To reduce our overall costs, we
want to select the route with the
negative index indicating the
largest improvement.
The maximum we can ship on the
new route is found by looking at
the closed path’s minus signs. We
select the smallest number found
in the squares with minus signs.
Changing the shipping route
involves adding to squares on the
closed path with plus signs and
subtracting from squares with
minus signs.

CHAPTER 9 • TRANSPORTATION AND ASSIGNMENT MODELS
We add 100 units to the 0 now being shipped on route F–A; then proceed to subtract 100
from route F–B, leaving 0 in that square (but still balancing the row total for F); then add 100 to
route E–B, yielding 200; and finally, subtract 100 from route E–A, leaving 100 units shipped.
Note that the new numbers still produce the correct row and column totals as required. The new
solution is shown in Table 9.7.
Total shipping cost has been reduced by 
and is
now $4,000. This cost figure can, of course, also be derived by multiplying each unit shipping
cost times the number of units transported on its route, namely, 
The solution shown in Table 9.7 may or may not be optimal. To determine whether further
improvement is possible, we return to the first five steps given earlier to test each square that is
now unused. The four improvement indices—each representing an available shipping route—
are as follows:
Hence, an improvement can be made by shipping the maximum allowable number of units from
E to C (see Table 9.8). Only the squares E–A and F–C have minus signs in the closed path; be-
cause the smallest number in these two squares is 100, we add 100 units to E–C and F–A and

Table 9.9 contains the optimal shipping assignments because each improvement index that
can be computed at this point is greater than or equal to zero, as shown in the following equa-
tions. Improvement indices for the table are
F to B = IFB = +$7 - $5 + $3 - $4 = +$1 (path: +FB - FC + EC - EB)

Since all four of these

CHAPTER 9 • TRANSPORTATION AND ASSIGNMENT MODELS
Let us summarize the steps in the transportation algorithm:
Summary of Steps in Transportation Algorithm (Minimization)
1. Set up a balanced transportation table.
2. Develop initial solution using the northwest corner method.
3. Calculate an improvement index for each empty cell using the stepping-stone method. If
improvement indices are all nonnegative, stop; the optimal solution has been found. If any
index is negative, continue to step 4.
4. Select the cell with the improvement index indicating the greatest decrease in cost. Fill this
cell using a stepping-stone path and go to step 3.
Some special situations may occur when using this algorithm. They are presented in the
next section.
The transportation algorithm 
has four basic steps.
9.6
Special Situations with the Transportation Algorithm
When using the transportation algorithm, some special situations may arise, including unbalanced
problems, degenerate solutions, multiple optimal solutions, and unacceptable routes. This algo-
rithm may be modified to maximize total profit rather than minimize total cost. All of these situa-
tions will be addressed, and other modifications of the transportation algorithm will be presented.
Unbalanced Transportation Problems
A situation occurring quite frequently in real-life problems is the case in which total demand is
not equal to total supply. These unbalanced problems can be handled easily by the preceding so-
lution procedures if we first introduce dummy sources or dummy destinations. In the event
that total supply is greater than total demand, a dummy destination (warehouse), with demand
exactly equal to the surplus, is created. If total demand is greater than total supply, we introduce
a dummy source (factory) with a supply equal to the excess of demand over supply. In either
case, shipping cost coefficients of zero are assigned to each dummy location or route because no
shipments will actually be made from a dummy factory or to a dummy warehouse. Any units as-
signed to a dummy destination represent excess capacity, and units assigned to a dummy source
represent unmet demand.
Answering Warehousing Questions at 
San Miguel Corporation
The San Miguel Corporation, based in the Philippines, faces
unique distribution challenges. With more than 300 products, in-
cluding beer, alcoholic drinks, juices, bottled water, feeds, poul-
try, and meats to be distributed to every corner of the Philippine
archipelago, shipping and warehousing costs make up a large
part of total product cost.
The company grappled with these questions:

Which products should be produced in each plant and in
which warehouse should they be stored?

Which warehouses should be maintained and where should
new ones be located?

When should warehouses be closed or opened?

Which demand centers should each warehouse serve?
Turning to the transportation model of LP, San Miguel is able
to answer these questions. The firm uses these types of ware-
houses: company owned and staffed, rented but company
staffed, and contracted out (i.e., not company owned or staffed).
San Miguel’s Operations Research Department computed
that the firm saves $7.5 million annually with optimal beer
warehouse configurations over the existing national configura-
tions. In addition, analysis of warehousing for ice cream and
other frozen products indicated that the optimal configuration
of warehouses, compared with existing setups, produced a
$2.17 million savings.

(April 1999): 44–46.
IN ACTION
Dummy sources or destinations
are used to balance problems in
which demand is not equal to
supply.

9.6
SPECIAL SITUATIONS WITH THE TRANSPORTATION ALGORITHM
359
DEMAND LESS THAN SUPPLY Considering the original Executive Furniture Corporation prob-
lem, suppose that the Des Moines factory increases its rate of production to 250 desks. (That
factory’s capacity used to be 100 desks per production period.) The firm is now able to supply a
total of 850 desks each period. Warehouse requirements, however, remain the same (at 700
desks), so the row and column totals do not balance.
To balance this type of problem, we simply add a dummy column that will represent a fake
warehouse requiring 150 desks. This is somewhat analogous to adding a slack variable in solv-
ing an LP problem. Just as slack variables were assigned a value of zero dollars in the LP objec-
tive function, the shipping costs to this dummy warehouse are all set equal to zero.
The northwest corner rule is used once again, in Table 9.10, to find an initial solution to this
modified Executive Furniture problem. To complete this task and find an optimal solution, you
would employ the stepping-stone method.
Note that the 150 units from Fort Lauderdale to the dummy warehouse represent 150 units
that are not shipped from Fort Lauderdale.
DEMAND GREATER THAN SUPPLY The second type of unbalanced condition occurs when total
demand is greater than total supply. This means that customers or warehouses require more of a
product than the firm’s factories can provide. In this case we need to add a dummy row repre-
senting a fake factory.
The new factory will have a supply exactly equal to the difference between total demand
and total real supply. The shipping costs from the dummy factory to each destination will be
zero.
Let us set up such an unbalanced problem for the Happy Sound Stereo Company. Happy
Sound assembles high-fidelity stereophonic systems at three plants and distributes through three
regional warehouses. The production capacities at each plant, demand at each warehouse, and
unit shipping costs are presented in Table 9.11.
As can be seen in Table 9.12, a dummy plant adds an extra row, balances the problem, and
allows us to apply the northwest corner rule to find the initial solution shown. This initial solu-
tion shows 50 units being shipped from the dummy plant to warehouse C. This means that ware-
house C will be 50 units short of its requirements. In general, any units shipped from a dummy
source represent unmet demand at the respective destination.
Degeneracy in Transportation Problems
We briefly mentioned the subject of degeneracy earlier in this chapter. Degeneracy occurs when
the number of occupied squares or routes in a transportation table solution is less than the num-
ber of rows plus the number of columns minus 1. Such a situation may arise in the initial solu-
tion or in any subsequent solution. Degeneracy requires a special procedure to correct the

TABLE 9.12
Initial Solution to an

in which Demand Is
Greater Than Supply
problem. Without enough occupied squares to trace a closed path for each unused route, it would
be impossible to apply the stepping-stone method. You might recall that no problem discussed
in the chapter thus far has been degenerate.
To handle degenerate problems, we create an artificially occupied cell—that is, we place a
zero (representing a fake shipment) in one of the unused squares and then treat that square as if
it were occupied. The square chosen must be in such a position as to allow all stepping-stone
paths to be closed, although there is usually a good deal of flexibility in selecting the unused
square that will receive the zero.
DEGENERACY IN AN INITIAL SOLUTION Degeneracy can occur in our application of the northwest
corner rule to find an initial solution, as we see in the case of the Martin Shipping Company.
Martin has three warehouses from which to supply its three major retail customers in San Jose.
Martin’s hipping costs, warehouse supplies, and customer demands are presented in Table 9.13.
Note that origins in this problem are warehouses and destinations are retail stores. Initial shipping
assignments are made in the table by application of the northwest corner rule.
This initial solution is degenerate because it violates the rule that the number of used
squares must be equal to the number of rows plus the number of columns minus 1 (i.e.,
is greater than the number of occupied boxes). In this particular problem,
degeneracy arose because both a column and a row requirement (that being column 1 and row 1)
were satisfied simultaneously. This broke the stair-step pattern that we usually see with north-
west corner solutions.
To correct the problem, we can place a zero in an unused square. With the northwest corner
method, this zero should be placed in one of the cells that is adjacent to the last filled cell so the
3 + 3 - 1 = 5

9.6
SPECIAL SITUATIONS WITH THE TRANSPORTATION ALGORITHM
361
stair-step pattern continues. In this case, those squares representing either the shipping route
from warehouse 1 to customer 2 or from warehouse 2 to customer 1 will do. If you treat the new
zero square just like any other occupied square, the regular solution method can be used.
DEGENERACY DURING LATER SOLUTION STAGES A transportation problem can become degen-
erate after the initial solution stage if the filling of an empty square results in two (or more) filled
cells becoming empty simultaneously instead of just one cell becoming empty. Such a problem
occurs when two or more squares assigned minus signs on a closed path tie for the lowest quan-
tity. To correct this problem, a zero should be put in one (or more) of the previously filled
squares so that only one previously filled square becomes empty.
Bagwell Paint Example. After one iteration of the stepping-stone method, cost analysts at
Bagwell Paint produced the transportation table shown as Table 9.14. We observe that the
solution in Table 9.14 is not degenerate, but it is also not optimal. The improvement indices for
the four currently unused squares are
factory A – warehouse 2 index 
factory A – warehouse 3 index 
factory B – warehouse 3 index 
factory C – warehouse 2 index 
Hence, an improved solution can be obtained by opening the route from factory B to ware-
house 3. Let us go through the stepping-stone procedure for finding the next solution to Bagwell
Paint’s problem. We begin by drawing a closed path for the unused square representing factory
B–warehouse 3. This is shown in Table 9.15, which is an abbreviated version of Table 9.14 and
contains only the factories and warehouses necessary to close the path.

TABLE 9.15
Tracing a Closed Path
for the Factory
B–Warehouse 3 Route
The smallest quantity in a square containing a minus sign is 50, so we add 50 units to the
factory B–warehouse 3 and factory C–warehouse 1 routes, and subtract 50 units from the two
squares containing minus signs. However, this act causes two formerly occupied squares to drop
to 0. It also means that there are not enough occupied squares in the new solution and that it will
be degenerate. We will have to place an artificial zero in one of the previously filled squares
(generally, the one with the lowest shipping cost) to handle the degeneracy problem.
More Than One Optimal Solution
Just as with LP problems, it is possible for a transportation problem to have multiple optimal so-
lutions. Such a situation is indicated when one or more of the improvement indices that we cal-
culate for each unused square is zero in the optimal solution. This means that it is possible to
design alternative shipping routes with the same total shipping cost. The alternate optimal solu-
tion can be found by shipping the most to this unused square using a stepping-stone path. Practi-
cally speaking, multiple optimal solutions provide management with greater flexibility in
selecting and using resources.
Maximization Transportation Problems
If the objective in a transportation problem is to maximize profit, a minor change is required in
the transportation algorithm. Since the improvement index for an empty cell indicates how the
objective function value will change if one unit is placed in that empty cell, the optimal solution
is reached when all the improvement indices are negative or zero. If any index is positive, the
cell with the largest positive improvement index is selected to be filled using a stepping-stone
path. This new solution is evaluated and the process continues until there are no positive im-
provement indices.
Unacceptable or Prohibited Routes
At times there are transportation problems in which one of the sources is unable to ship to one
or more of the destinations. When this occurs, the problem is said to have an unacceptable or
prohibited route. In a minimization problem, such a prohibited route is assigned a very high cost
to prevent this route from ever being used in the optimal solution. After this high cost is placed
in the transportation table, the problem is solved using the techniques previously discussed. In a
maximization problem, the very high cost used in minimization problems is given a negative
sign, turning it into a very bad profit.
Other Transportation Methods 
While the northwest corner method is very easy to use, there are other methods for finding an
initial solution to a transportation problem. Two of these are the least-cost method and Vogel’s
approximation method. Similarly, the stepping-stone method is used to evaluate empty cells, and
there is another technique called the modified distribution (MODI) method that can evaluate
empty cells. For very large problems, the MODI method is usually much faster than the step-
ping-stone method.
Multiple solutions are possible
when one or more improvement
indices in the optimal solution
stages are equal to zero.
The optimal solution to a
maximization problem has been
found when all improvement
indices are negative or zero.
A prohibited route is assigned a
very high cost to prevent it from
being used.

FACILITY LOCATION ANALYSIS
363
9.7
Facility Location Analysis
The transportation method has proved to be especially useful in helping a firm decide where to
locate a new factory or warehouse. Since a new location is an issue of major financial impor-
tance to a company, several alternative locations must ordinarily be considered and evaluated.
Even though a wide variety of subjective factors are considered, including quality of labor sup-
ply, presence of labor unions, community attitude and appearance, utilities, and recreational and
educational facilities for employees, a final decision also involves minimizing total shipping and
production costs. This means that each alternative facility location should be analyzed within
the framework of one overall distribution system. The new location that will yield the minimum
cost for the entire system will be the one recommended. Let us consider the case of the Hard-
grave Machine Company.
Locating a New Factory for Hardgrave Machine Company
The Hardgrave Machine Company produces computer components at its plants in Cincinnati,
Salt Lake City, and Pittsburgh. These plants have not been able to keep up with demand for or-
ders at Hardgrave’s four warehouses in Detroit, Dallas, New York, and Los Angeles. As a result,
the firm has decided to build a new plant to expand its productive capacity. The two sites being
considered are Seattle and Birmingham; both cities are attractive in terms of labor supply,
municipal services, and ease of factory financing.
Table 9.16 presents the production costs and output requirements for each of the three exist-
ing plants, demand at each of the four warehouses, and estimated production costs of the new
proposed plants. Transportation costs from each plant to each warehouse are summarized in
Table 9.17.
Locating a new facility within
one overall distribution system is
aided by the transportation
method.

CHAPTER 9 • TRANSPORTATION AND ASSIGNMENT MODELS
The important question that Hardgrave now faces is this: Which of the new locations will
yield the lowest cost for the firm in combination with the existing plants and warehouses? Note
that the cost of each individual plant-to-warehouse route is found by adding the shipping costs
(in the body of Table 9.17) to the respective unit production costs (from Table 9.16). Thus, the
total production plus shipping cost of one computer component from Cincinnati to Detroit is
$73 ($25 for shipping plus $48 for production).
To determine which new plant (Seattle or Birmingham) shows the lowest total systemwide
cost of distribution and production, we solve two transportation problems—one for each of the
two possible combinations. Tables 9.18 and 9.19 show the resulting two optimum solutions with
the total cost for each. It appears that Seattle should be selected as the new plant site: Its total
cost of $3,704,000 is less than the $3,741,000 cost at Birmingham.
USING EXCEL QM AS A SOLUTION TOOL We can use Excel QM to solve each of the two Hard-
grave Machine Company problems. To do this, select Excel QM from the Add-Ins tab in Excel
2010 and scroll down to select Transportation. When the window opens, enter the number of
Origins (sources) and Destinations, specify Minimize, give this a title if desired, and click OK.
Then simply enter the costs, supplies, and demands in the table labeled Data, as shown in Prob-
lem 9.4. Then select Solver from the Data tab and click Solve. No further input is needed as Ex-
cel QM automatically specifies the necessary parameters and selections. Excel also prepares the
formulas for the constraints used by Solver. The solution will appear in the table labeled Ship-
ments, and the cost will be specified below this table.

The Assignment Algorithm
The second special-purpose LP algorithm discussed in this chapter is the assignment method. Each
assignment problem has associated with it a table, or matrix. Generally, the rows contain the
objects or people we wish to assign, and the columns comprise the tasks or things we want them
assigned to. The numbers in the table are the costs associated with each particular assignment.
An assignment problem can be viewed as a transportation problem in which the capacity
from each source (or person to be assigned) is 1 and the demand at each destination (or job to be
done) is 1. Such a formulation could be solved using the transportation algorithm, but it would
have a severe degeneracy problem. However, this type of problem is very easy to solve using the
assignment method.
As an illustration of the assignment method, let us consider the case of the Fix-It Shop,
which has just received three new rush projects to repair: (1) a radio, (2) a toaster oven, and (3) a
broken coffee table. Three repair persons, each with different talents and abilities, are available
to do the jobs. The Fix-It Shop owner estimates what it will cost in wages to assign each of the
workers to each of the three projects. The costs, which are shown in Table 9.20, differ because
the owner believes that each worker will differ in speed and skill on these quite varied jobs.
The owner’s objective is to assign the three projects to the workers in a way that will result
in the lowest total cost to the shop. Note that the assignment of people to projects must be on a
one-to-one basis; each project will be assigned exclusively to one worker only. Hence the num-
ber of rows must always equal the number of columns in an assignment problem’s cost table.
The goal is to assign projects to
people (one project to one person)
so that the total costs are
minimized.

Assignment Problem

One way to solve (small)
problems is to enumerate all
possible outcomes.
Matrix reduction reduces the
table to a set of opportunity
costs. These show the penalty of
not making the least-cost (or
best) assignment.
*The steps apply if we can assume that the matrix is balanced, that is, the number of rows in the matrix equals the
number of columns. In Section 9.9 we discuss how to handle unbalanced problems.
366
CHAPTER 9 • TRANSPORTATION AND ASSIGNMENT MODELS
Because the Fix-It Shop problem only consists of three workers and three projects, one easy
way to find the best solution is to list all possible assignments and their respective costs. For ex-
ample, if Adams is assigned to project 1, Brown to project 2, and Cooper to project 3, the total
cost will be 
Table 9.21 summarizes all six assignment options. The
table also shows that the least-cost solution would be to assign Cooper to project 1, Brown to
project 2, and Adams to project 3, at a total cost of $25.
Obtaining solutions by enumeration works well for small problems but quickly becomes in-
efficient as assignment problems become larger. For example, a problem involving the assign-
ment of four workers to four projects requires that we consider 
or 24
alternatives. A problem with eight workers and eight tasks, which actually is not that large in a
realistic situation, yields 
or 40,320 possible solu-
tions! Since it would clearly be impractical to compare so many alternatives, a more efficient
solution method is needed.
The Hungarian Method (Flood’s Technique)
The Hungarian method of assignment provides us with an efficient means of finding the opti-
mal solution without having to make a direct comparison of every option. It operates on a prin-
ciple of matrix reduction, which means that by subtracting and adding appropriate numbers in
the cost table or matrix, we can reduce the problem to a matrix of opportunity costs. Opportu-
nity costs show the relative penalties associated with assigning any person to a project as
opposed to making the best, or least-cost, assignment. We would like to make assignments such
that the opportunity cost for each assignment is zero. The Hungarian method will indicate when
it is possible to make such assignments.
There are basically three steps in the assignment method*:
Three Steps of the Assignment Method
1. Find the opportunity cost table by
(a) Subtracting the smallest number in each row of the original cost table or matrix from
every number in that row.
(b) Then subtracting the smallest number in each column of the table obtained in part (a)
from every number in that column.
2. Test the table resulting from step 1 to see whether an optimal assignment can be made. The
procedure is to draw the minimum number of vertical and horizontal straight lines
necessary to cover all zeros in the table. If the number of lines equals either the number of
rows or columns in the table, an optimal assignment can be made. If the number of lines is
less than the number of rows or columns, we proceed to step 3.
3. Revise the present opportunity cost table. This is done by subtracting the smallest number
not covered by a line from every uncovered number. This same smallest number is also
added to any number(s) lying at the intersection of horizontal and vertical lines. We then
return to step 2 and continue the cycle until an optimal assignment is possible.
8! (= 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1),
4! (= 4 * 3 * 2 * 1),
$11 + $10 + $7 = $28.

Here are the three steps of the
assignment method.

9.8
THE ASSIGNMENT ALGORITHM
367
These steps are charted in Figure 9.4. Let us now apply them.
Step 1: Find the Opportunity Cost Table. As mentioned earlier, the opportunity cost of any
decision we make in life consists of the opportunities that are sacrificed in making that decision.
For example, the opportunity cost of the unpaid time a person spends starting a new business is
the salary that person would earn for those hours that he or she could have worked on another
job. This important concept in the assignment method is best illustrated by applying it to a
problem. For your convenience, the original cost table for the Fix-It Shop problem is repeated in
Table 9.22.
Suppose that we decide to assign Cooper to project 2. The table shows that the cost of this
assignment is $12. Based on the concept of opportunity costs, this is not the best decision, since
Cooper could perform project 3 for only $7. The assignment of Cooper to project 2 then involves
an opportunity cost of $5 
the amount we are sacrificing by making this assign-
ment instead of the least-cost one. Similarly, an assignment of Cooper to project 1 represents an
opportunity cost of 
Finally, because the assignment of Cooper to project 3 is the
best assignment, we can say that the opportunity cost of this assignment is zero 
The
results of this operation for each of the rows in Table 9.22 are called the row opportunity costs
and are shown in Table 9.23.
($7 - $7).
$9 - $7 = $2.
(= $12 - $7),

  (a) Subtract the smallest
number not covered by a line
from itself and every other
uncovered number.
  (b) Add this number at every
intersection of any two lines.

CHAPTER 9 • TRANSPORTATION AND ASSIGNMENT MODELS
We note at this point that although the assignment of Cooper to project 3 is the cheapest
way to make use of Cooper, it is not necessarily the least-expensive approach to completing
project 3. Adams can perform the same task for only $6. In other words, if we look at this
assignment problem from a project angle instead of a people angle, the column opportunity costs
may be completely different.
What we need to complete step 1 of the assignment method is a total opportunity cost table,
that is, one that reflects both row and column opportunity costs. This involves following part (b)
of step 1 to derive column opportunity costs.* We simply take the costs in Table 9.23 and sub-
tract the smallest number in each column from each number in that column. The resulting total
opportunity costs are given in Table 9.24.
You might note that the numbers in columns 1 and 3 are the same as those in Table 9.23,
since the smallest column entry in each case was zero. Thus, it may turn out that the assignment
of Cooper to project 3 is part of the optimal solution because of the relative nature of opportu-
nity costs. What we are trying to measure are the relative efficiencies for the entire cost table
and to find what assignments are best for the overall solution.
Step 2: Test for an Optimal Assignment. The objective of the Fix-It Shop owner is to assign the
three workers to the repair projects in such a way that total labor costs are kept at a minimum.
When translated to making assignments using our total opportunity cost table, this means that
we would like to have a total assigned opportunity cost of 0. In other words, an optimal solution
has zero opportunity costs for all of the assignments.
Looking at Table 9.24, we see that there are four possible zero opportunity cost assign-
ments. We could assign Adams to project 3 and Brown to either project 1 or project 2. But this
leaves Cooper without a zero opportunity cost assignment. Recall that two workers cannot be
given the same task; each must do one and only one repair project, and each project must be as-
signed to only one person. Hence, even though four zeros appear in this cost table, it is not yet
possible to make an assignment yielding a total opportunity cost of zero.
A simple test has been designed to help us determine whether an optimal assignment can be
made. The method consists of finding the minimum number of straight lines (vertical and hori-
zontal) necessary to cover all zeros in the cost table. (Each line is drawn so that it covers as many
zeros as possible at one time.) If the number of lines equals the number of rows or columns in
the table, then an optimal assignment can be made. If, on the other hand, the number of lines is
less than the number of rows or columns, an optimal assignment cannot be made. In the latter
case, we must proceed to step 3 and develop a new total opportunity cost table.
Table 9.25 illustrates that it is possible to cover all four zero entries in Table 9.24 with only
two lines. Because there are three rows, an optimal assignment may not yet be made.
Step 3: Revise the Opportunity-Cost Table. An optimal solution is seldom obtained from the initial
opportunity cost table. Often, we need to revise the table in order to shift one (or more) of the zero
costs from its present location (covered by lines) to a new uncovered location in the table.
Intuitively, we would want this uncovered location to emerge with a new zero opportunity cost.
Total opportunity costs reflect
the row and column opportunity
cost analyses.
When a zero opportunity cost is
found for all of the assignments,
an optimal assignment can be
made.
This line test is used to see if a
solution is optimal.
*Can you think of a situation in which part (b) of step 1 would not be required? See if you can design a cost table in
which an optimal solution is possible after part (a) of step 1 is completed.

THE ASSIGNMENT ALGORITHM
369
This is accomplished by subtracting the smallest number not covered by a line from all
numbers not covered by a straight line. This same smallest number is then added to every num-
ber (including zeros) lying at the intersection of any two lines.
The smallest uncovered number in Table 9.25 is 2, so this value is subtracted from each of
the four uncovered numbers. A 2 is also added to the number that is covered by the intersecting
horizontal and vertical lines. The results of step 3 are shown in Table 9.26.
To test now for an optimal assignment, we return to step 2 and find the minimum number of
lines necessary to cover all zeros in the revised opportunity cost table. Because it requires three
lines to cover the zeros (see Table 9.27), an optimal assignment can be made.
Making the Final Assignment
It is apparent that the Fix-It Shop problem’s optimal assignment is Adams to project 3, Brown
to project 2, and Cooper to project 1. In solving larger problems, however, it is best to rely on a
more systematic approach to making valid assignments. One such way is first to select a row or
column that contains only one zero cell. Such a situation is found in the first row, Adams’s row,
in which the only zero is in the project 3 column. An assignment can be made to that cell, and
then lines drawn through its row and column (see Table 9.28). From the uncovered rows and
columns, we again choose a row or column in which there is only one zero cell. We make that
assignment and continue the procedure until each person is assigned to one task.
The total labor costs of this assignment are computed from the original cost table (see Table
9.22). They are as follows:

SPECIAL SITUATIONS WITH THE ASSIGNMENT ALGORITHM
371
9.9
Special Situations with the Assignment Algorithm
There are two special situations that require special procedures when using the Hungarian
algorithm for assignment problems. The first involves problems that are not balanced, and the
second involves solving a maximization problem instead of a minimization problem.
Unbalanced Assignment Problems
The solution procedure to assignment problems just discussed requires that the number of rows
in the table equal the number of columns. Such a problem is called a balanced assignment
problem. Often, however, the number of people or objects to be assigned does not equal the
number of tasks or clients or machines listed in the columns, and the problem is unbalanced.
When this occurs, and we have more rows than columns, we simply add a dummy column or
task (similar to how we handled unbalanced transportation problems earlier in this chapter). If
the number of tasks that need to be done exceeds the number of people available, we add a
dummy row. This creates a table of equal dimensions and allows us to solve the problem as
before. Since the dummy task or person is really nonexistent, it is reasonable to enter zeros in
its row or column as the cost or time estimate.
Suppose the owner of the Fix-It Shop realizes that a fourth worker, Davis, is also available
to work on one of the three rush jobs that just came in. Davis can do the first project for $10,
the second for $13, and the third project for $8. The shop’s owner still faces the same basic
problem, that is, which worker to assign to which project to minimize total labor costs. We do
not have a fourth project, however, so we simply add a dummy column or dummy project. The
initial cost table is shown in Table 9.29. One of the four workers, you should realize, will be
assigned to the dummy project; in other words, the worker will not really be assigned any of
the tasks.
Maximization Assignment Problems
Some assignment problems are phrased in terms of maximizing the payoff, profit, or effec-
tiveness of an assignment instead of minimizing costs. It is easy to obtain an equivalent min-
imization problem by converting all numbers in the table to opportunity costs. This is
brought about by subtracting every number in the original payoff table from the largest sin-
gle number in that table. The transformed entries represent opportunity costs; it turns out that
minimizing opportunity costs produces the same assignment as the original maximization
problem. Once the optimal assignment for this transformed problem has been computed, the
total payoff or profit is found by adding the original payoffs of those cells that are in the op-
timal assignment.
Let us consider the following example. The British navy wishes to assign four ships to pa-
trol four sectors of the North Sea. In some areas ships are to be on the outlook for illegal fish-
ing boats, and in other sectors to watch for enemy submarines, so the commander rates each
ship in terms of its probable efficiency in each sector. These relative efficiencies are illustrated
in Table 9.30. On the basis of the ratings shown, the commander wants to determine the patrol
assignments producing the greatest overall efficiencies.
A balanced assignment problem
is one in which the number of
rows equals the number of
columns.
Maximization problems can
easily be converted to
minimization problems. This is
done by subtracting each rating
from the largest rating in the
table.

CHAPTER 9 • TRANSPORTATION AND ASSIGNMENT MODELS
Step by step, the solution procedure is as follows. We first convert the maximizing effi-
ciency table into a minimizing opportunity cost table. This is done by subtracting each rating
from 100, the largest rating in the whole table. The resulting opportunity costs are given in
Table 9.31.
We now follow steps 1 and 2 of the assignment algorithm. The smallest number in each row
is subtracted from every number in that row (see Table 9.32); and then the smallest number in
each column is subtracted from every number in that column (as shown in Table 9.33).
The minimum number of straight lines needed to cover all zeros in this total opportunity
cost table is four. Hence an optimal assignment can be made already. You should be able by now
to spot the best solution, namely, ship 1 to sector D, ship 2 to sector C, ship 3 to sector B, and
ship 4 to sector A.
The overall efficiency, computed from the original efficiency data in Table 9.30, can now be
shown:
Row subtractions: the smallest
number in each row is subtracted
from every number in that row.
Column subtractions: the
smallest number in each column
is subtracted from every number
in that column.

GLOSSARY

Facility Location Leads to Improved
Supply-Chain Reliability
Supply chains are, at their physical level, an interconnected net-
work of delivery routes (roads, bridges, shipping lanes, etc.) that
lead from multiple sources (warehouse, factories, refineries, etc.)
to multiple destinations (stores, outlets, other warehouses, etc.)
along which products and commodities travel. In most cases, the
allocation of particular destinations to particular sources is known
and fairly constant.
Researchers, in trying to help companies plan for emergen-
cies, have investigated the problem of supply-chain disruption.
What would happen if one of the sources were to catastrophically
fail due to an earthquake, a tornado, or worse? The answer lies
in the area of the facility location problem: Which warehouses
should deliver to which stores addresses this issue. Analyzing the
transportation problem with current sources eliminated one by
one, the analysts were able to measure the impact of such disrup-
tion. The researchers concluded that “backup assignments” of
warehouses to stores should be planned ahead of time to help
mitigate the impact of possible catastrophes. It always pays to
plan ahead!

IN ACTION
Summary
In this chapter we explored the transportation model and the
assignment model. We saw how to develop an initial solution
to the transportation problem with the northwest corner
method. The stepping-stone path method was used to calculate
improvement indices for the empty cells. Improved solutions
were developed using a stepping-stone path. The special cases
of the transportation problem included degeneracy, unbalanced
problems, and multiple optimal solutions. We demonstrated
how to use the transportation model for facility location
analysis.
We saw how the assignment problem may be viewed as a
special case of the transportation problem. The Hungarian
method for solving assignment problems was presented. When
assignment problems are unbalanced, dummy rows or columns
are used to balance the problem. Assignment problems with
maximization objectives were also presented.
Glossary
Balanced Assignment Problem.
An assignment problem in
which the number of rows is equal to the number of
columns.
Balanced Transportation Problem.
The condition under
which total demand (at all destinations) is equal to total
supply (at all sources).
Degeneracy.
A condition that occurs when the number of
occupied squares in any solution is less than the number of
rows plus the number of columns minus 1 in a
transportation table.
Destination.
A demand location in a transportation problem.
Dummy Destination.
An artificial destination added to a
transportation table when total supply is greater than total
demand. The demand at the dummy destination is set so
that total supply and demand are equal. The transportation

Dummy Rows or Columns.
Extra rows or columns added
in order to “balance” an assignment problem so that the

Solved Problems
Solved Problem 9-1
Don Yale, president of Hardrock Concrete Company, has plants in three locations and is currently work-
ing on three major construction projects, located at different sites. The shipping cost per truckload of
concrete, plant capacities, and project requirements are provided in the accompanying table.
a. Formulate an initial feasible solution to Hardrock’s transportation problem using the northwest cor-
ner rule.
b. Then evaluate each unused shipping route (each empty cell) by applying the stepping-stone method
and computing all improvement indices. Remember to do the following:
1. Check that supply and demand are equal.
2. Load the table via the northwest corner method.
3. Check that there are the proper number of occupied cells for a “normal” solution, namely,
4. Find a closed path to each empty cell.
5. Determine the improvement index for each unused cell.
6. Move as many units as possible to the cell that provides the most improvement (if there is one).
7. Repeat steps 3 through 6 until no further improvement can be found.
Number of rows + Number of columns - 1 = Number of occupied cells.

Since all indices are greater than or equal to zero (all are positive or zero), this initial solution provides
the optimal transportation schedule, namely, 40 units from 1 to A, 30 units from 1 to B, 20 units from 
2 to B, 30 units from 2 to C, and 30 units from 3 to C.
Had we found a path that allowed improvement, we would move all units possible to that cell and
then check every empty cell again. Because the plant 3 to project A improvement index was equal to
zero, we note that multiple optimal solutions exist.
Solved Problem 9-2
The initial solution found in Solved Problem 9-1 was optimal, but the improvement index for one of the
empty cells was zero, indicating another optimal solution. Use a stepping-stone path to develop this
other optimal solution.
Solution
Using the stepping-stone path, we see that the lowest number of units in a cell where a subtraction is to
be made is 20 units from plant 2 to project B. Therefore, 20 units will be subtracted from each cell with
a minus sign and added to each cell with a plus sign. The result is shown here:

CHAPTER 9 • TRANSPORTATION AND ASSIGNMENT MODELS
Solved Problem 9-3
Solve the Hardgrave Machine Company facility location problem shown in Table 9.19 on page 366 with
an LP formulation.
Solution
First we shall formulate this transportation problem as an LP model by introducing double-subscripted
decision variables. We let 
denote the number of units shipped from origin 1 (Cincinnati) to destination
1 (Detroit), 
denote shipments from origin 1 (Cincinnati) to destination 2 (Dallas), and so on. In general,
the decision variables for a transportation problem having m origins and n destinations are written as
where
Because the objective of the transportation model is to minimize total transportation costs, we develop
the following cost expression:
Now we establish supply constraints for each of the four plants:
(Cincinnati supply)
(Salt Lake supply)
(Pittsburgh supply)
(Seattle supply)
With four warehouses as the destinations, we need the following four demand constraints:
(Detroit demand)
(Dallas demand)
(New York demand)
(Los Angeles demand)
A computer solution will confirm that total shipping costs will be $3,704,000. Although LP codes can
indeed be used on transportation problems, the special transportation module for Excel QM (shown ear-
lier) and QM for Windows (shown in Appendix 9.1) tend to be easier to input, run, and interpret.
Solved Problem 9-4
Prentice Hall, Inc., a publisher headquartered in New Jersey, wants to assign three recently hired college
graduates, Jones, Smith, and Wilson to regional sales districts in Omaha, Dallas, and Miami. But the firm
also has an opening in New York and would send one of the three there if it were more economical than a
move to Omaha, Dallas, or Miami. It will cost $1,000 to relocate Jones to New York, $800 to relocate
Smith there, and $1,500 to move Wilson. What is the optimal assignment of personnel to offices?

cell with a minus sign is 35, but two different cells
with minus signs have 35 units in them. What prob-
lem will this cause, and how should this difficulty be
resolved?

much the total cost will decrease when developing
each new solution for any transportation problem?

9-8 How could an assignment problem be solved using

9-9 You are the plant supervisor and are responsible for
scheduling workers to jobs on hand. After estimat-
ing the cost of assigning each of five available work-
ers in your plant to five projects that must be
completed immediately, you solve the problem us-
ing the Hungarian method. The following solution is
reached and you post these job assignments:
Jones to project A
Smith to project B
Thomas to project C
Gibbs to project D
Heldman to project E
The optimal cost was found to be $492 for these as-
signments. The plant general manager inspects your
original cost estimates and informs you that in-
creased employee benefits mean that each of the
25 numbers in your cost table is too low by $5. He
suggests that you immediately rework the problem
and post the new assignments.
Is this necessary? Why? What will the new optimal
cost be?

although the first four volunteers did not pose any
objections to being placed in any of the five new
cities, the fifth volunteer did make one restriction.
That person absolutely refused to be assigned to the
new office in Tallahassee, Florida—fear of southern
roaches, the representative claimed! How should
Sue alter the cost matrix to ensure that this assign-
ment is not included in the optimal solution?

9-24 The state of Missouri has three major power-generating
companies (A, B, and C). During the months of peak
demand, the Missouri Power Authority authorizes
these companies to pool their excess supply and to
distribute it to smaller independent power companies
that do not have generators large enough to handle
the demand. Excess supply is distributed on the ba-
sis of cost per kilowatt hour transmitted. The follow-
ing table shows the demand and supply in millions
of kilowatt hours and the cost per kilowatt hour of
transmitting electric power to four small companies
in cities W, X, Y, and Z:

a standard container of blood from each bank to each
hospital is shown in the table below. Also given are
the biweekly number of containers available at each
bank and the biweekly number of containers of blood
needed at each hospital. How many shipments should
be made biweekly from each blood bank to each hos-

9-28 The B. Hall Real Estate Investment Corporation has
identified four small apartment buildings in which it
would like to invest. Mrs. Hall has approached three
savings and loan companies regarding financing.
Because Hall has been a good client in the past and
has maintained a high credit rating in the commu-
nity, each savings and loan company is willing to
consider providing all or part of the mortgage loan
needed on each property. Each loan officer has set
differing interest rates on each property (rates are af-
fected by the neighborhood of the apartment build-
ing, condition of the property, and desire by the
individual savings and loan to finance various-size
buildings), and each loan company has placed a
maximum credit ceiling on how much it will lend
Hall in total. This information is summarized in the
table on this page.
Each apartment building is equally attractive as
an investment to Hall, so she has decided to pur-
chase all buildings possible at the lowest total pay-
ment of interest. From which savings and loan
companies should she borrow to purchase which
buildings? More than one savings and loan can fi-
nance the same property.

poration problem (Problem 9-28) as a linear pro-
gram and solve using computer software.
9-30 The J. Mehta Company’s production manager is
planning for a series of 1-month production periods
for stainless steel sinks. The demand for the next
4 months is as follows:

386
CHAPTER 9 • TRANSPORTATION AND ASSIGNMENT MODELS
The Mehta firm can normally produce 100 stainless
steel sinks in a month. This is done during regular
production hours at a cost of $100 per sink. If de-
mand in any 1 month cannot be satisfied by regular
production, the production manager has three other
choices: (1) He can produce up to 50 more sinks per
month in overtime but at a cost of $130 per sink; 
(2) he can purchase a limited number of sinks from
a friendly competitor for resale (the maximum num-
ber of outside purchases over the 4-month period is
450 sinks, at a cost of $150 each); or (3) he can fill
the demand from his on-hand inventory. The inven-
tory carrying cost is $10 per sink per month. Back
orders are not permitted. Inventory on hand at the
beginning of month 1 is 40 sinks. Set up this “pro-
duction smoothing” problem as a transportation
problem to minimize cost. Use the northwest corner
rule to find an initial level for production and outside
purchases over the 4-month period.
9-31 Formulate the J. Mehta production problem (See
Problem 9-30) as a linear program and solve using
computer software.
9-32 Ashley’s Auto Top Carriers currently maintains
plants in Atlanta and Tulsa that supply major distri-
bution centers in Los Angeles and New York. Be-
cause of an expanding demand, Ashley has decided
to open a third plant and has narrowed the choice to
one of two cities—New Orleans or Houston. The
pertinent production and distribution costs, as well
as the plant capacities and distribution demands, are
shown in the table below.
Which of the new possible plants should be opened?
9-33 Formulate and solve linear programs to help Ashley’s
Auto Top Carriers (See Problem 9-32) determine
where to open the new plant. How much difference
in the costs for the two locations?
9-34 Marc Smith, vice president for operations of HHN,
Inc., a manufacturer of cabinets for telephone
switches, is constrained from meeting the 5-year
forecast by limited capacity at the existing three
plants. These three plants are Waterloo, Pusan, and
Bogota. You, as his able assistant, have been told
that because of existing capacity constraints and the
expanding world market for HHN cabinets, a new
plant is to be added to the existing three plants. The
real estate department has advised Marc that two
sites seem particularly good because of a stable po-
litical situation and tolerable exchange rate: Dublin,
Ireland, and Fontainebleau, France. Marc suggests
that you should be able to take the data on the next
page and determine where the fourth plant should be
located on the basis of production costs and trans-
portation costs. Which location is better?

9-38 Four automobiles have entered Bubba’s Repair Shop
for various types of work, ranging from a transmis-
sion overhaul to a brake job. The experience level of
the mechanics is quite varied, and Bubba would like
to minimize the time required to complete all of the
jobs. He has estimated the time in minutes for each
mechanic to complete each job. Billy can complete
job 1 in 400 minutes, job 2 in 90 minutes, job 3 in
60 minutes, and job 4 in 120 minutes. Taylor will
finish job 1 in 650 minutes, job 2 in 120 minutes, job
3 in 90 minutes, and job 4 in 180 minutes. Mark will
finish job 1 in 480 minutes, job 2 in 120 minutes, job
3 in 80 minutes, and job 4 in 180 minutes. John will
complete job 1 in 500 minutes, job 2 in 110 minutes,
job 3 in 90 minutes, and job 4 in 150 minutes. Each
mechanic should be assigned to just one of these
jobs. What is the minimum total time required to
finish the four jobs? Who should be assigned to
each job?

CHAPTER 9 • TRANSPORTATION AND ASSIGNMENT MODELS
9-39 Baseball umpiring crews are currently in four cities
where three-game series are beginning. When these
are finished, the crews are needed to work games in
four different cities. The distances (miles) from each
of the cities where the crews are currently working
to the cities where the new games will begin are
shown in the following table:
Bardot, and Hoolihan. Believing in the quantitative
analysis approach to problem solving, the adminis-
trator has interviewed each nurse, considered his or
her background, personality, and talents, and devel-
oped a cost scale ranging from 0 to 100 to be used in
the assignment. A 0 for Nurse Bardot being assigned
to the cardiology unit implies that she would be per-
fectly suited to that task. A value close to 100, on the
other hand, would imply that she is not at all suited
to head that unit. The accompanying table gives the
complete set of cost figures that the hospital admin-
istrator felt represented all possible assignments.
Which nurse should be assigned to which unit?
9-43 The Gleaming Company has just developed a new

ing wants to schedule one commercial on each of four
networks and to have one commercial appear during
each of the four 1-hour time blocks. The exposure rat-
ings for each hour, which represent the number of
viewers per $1,000 spent, are presented in the follow-
ing table. Which network should be scheduled each
hour to provide the maximum audience exposure?

Since each of the four professors taught each of the
four courses at one time or another during the two-
year period, Davis is able to record a course rating
for each instructor. These ratings are shown in the

9-45 The Patricia Garcia Company is producing seven
new medical products. Each of Garcia’s eight plants
can add one more product to its current line of med-
ical devices. The unit manufacturing costs for pro-
ducing the different parts at the eight plants are
shown in the table above. How should Garcia assign
the new products to the plants to minimize manufac-
turing costs?
9-46 Haifa Instruments, an Israeli producer of portable
kidney dialysis units and other medical products,
develops an 8-month aggregate plan. Demand and
capacity (in units) are forecast as shown in the table
below.
The cost of producing each dialysis unit is $1,000
on regular time, $1,300 on overtime, and $1,500 on
a subcontract. Inventory carrying cost is $100 per
unit per month. There is no beginning or ending in-
ventory in stock.
(a) Set up a production plan, using the transporta-
tion model, that minimizes cost. What is this
plan’s cost?
(b) Through better planning, regular time produc-
tion can be set at exactly the same value, 275 per
month. Does this alter the solution?
(c) If overtime costs rise from $1,300 to $1,400,
does this change your answer to part (a)? What
if they fall to $1,200?
9-47 NASA’s astronaut crew currently includes 10 mis-
sion specialists who hold a doctoral degree in either
astrophysics or astromedicine. One of these special-
ists will be assigned to each of the 10 flights sched-
uled for the upcoming nine months. Mission
specialists are responsible for carrying out scientific
and medical experiments in space or for launching,
retrieving, or repairing satellites. The chief of astro-
naut personnel, himself a former crew member with
three missions under his belt, must decide who
should be assigned and trained for each of the very
different missions. Clearly, astronauts with medical
educations are more suited to missions involving bi-
ological or medical experiments, whereas those with
engineering- or physics-oriented degrees are best
suited to other types of missions. The chief assigns
each astronaut a rating on a scale of 1 to 10 for each
possible mission, with a 10 being a perfect match for
the task at hand and a 1 being a mismatch. Only one
specialist is assigned to each flight, and none is reas-
signed until all others have flown at least once.
(a) Who should be assigned to which flight?

Case Study
Andrew–Carter, Inc.
Andrew–Carter, Inc. (A–C), is a major Canadian producer and
distributor of outdoor lighting fixtures. Its fixture is distributed
throughout North America and has been in high demand for
several years. The company operates three plants that manufac-
ture the fixture and distribute it to five distribution centers
(warehouses).
During the present recession, A–C has seen a major drop in
demand for its fixture as the housing market has declined.
Based on the forecast of interest rates, the head of operations
feels that demand for housing and thus for its product will re-
main depressed for the foreseeable future. A–C is considering
closing one of its plants, as it is now operating with a forecasted
excess capacity of 34,000 units per week. The forecasted
weekly demands for the coming year are

If A–C shuts down any plants, its weekly costs will change,
as fixed costs are lower for a nonoperating plant. Table 9.34
shows production costs at each plant, both variable at regular
time and overtime, and fixed when operating and shut down.
Table 9.35 shows distribution costs from each plant to each
warehouse (distribution center).
Discussion Questions
1. Evaluate the various configurations of operating and
closed plants that will meet weekly demand. Determine
which configuration minimizes total costs.
2. Discuss the implications of closing a plant.

Case Study
Old Oregon Wood Store
In 1992, George Brown started the Old Oregon Wood Store to
manufacture Old Oregon tables. Each table is carefully con-
structed by hand using the highest-quality oak. Old Oregon
tables can support more than 500 pounds, and since the start of
the Old Oregon Wood Store, not one table has been returned
because of faulty workmanship or structural problems. In addi-
tion to being rugged, each table is beautifully finished using a
urethane varnish that George developed over 20 years of work-
ing with wood-finishing materials.
The manufacturing process consists of four steps: prepara-
tion, assembly, finishing, and packaging. Each step is per-
formed by one person. In addition to overseeing the entire
operation, George does all of the finishing. Tom Surowski per-
forms the preparation step, which involves cutting and forming
the basic components of the tables. Leon Davis is in charge of
the assembly, and Cathy Stark performs the packaging.
Although each person is responsible for only one step in
the manufacturing process, everyone can perform any one of the
steps. It is George’s policy that occasionally everyone should
complete several tables on his or her own without any help or
assistance. A small competition is used to see who can complete
an entire table in the least amount of time. George maintains
average total and intermediate completion times. The data are
shown in Figure 9.5.
It takes Cathy longer than the other employees to construct
an Old Oregon table. In addition to being slower than the other
employees, Cathy is also unhappy about her current responsi-
bility of packaging, which leaves her idle most of the day. Her
first preference is finishing, and her second preference is
preparation.
In addition to quality, George is concerned with costs and
efficiency. When one of the employees misses a day, it causes
major scheduling problems. In some cases, George assigns an-
other employee overtime to complete the necessary work. At
other times, George simply waits until the employee returns to
work to complete his or her step in the manufacturing process.
Both solutions cause problems. Overtime is expensive, and
waiting causes delays and sometimes stops the entire manufac-
turing process.
To overcome some of these problems, Randy Lane was
hired. Randy’s major duties are to perform miscellaneous jobs
and to help out if one of the employees is absent. George has
given Randy training in all phases of the manufacturing process,
and he is pleased with the speed at which Randy has been able
to learn how to completely assemble Old Oregon tables. Total
and intermediate completion times are given in Figure 9.6.

Discussion Questions
1. What is the fastest way to manufacture Old Oregon tables
using the original crew? How many could be made per day?
2. Would production rates and quantities change signifi-
cantly if George would allow Randy to perform one of the
four functions and make one of the original crew the
backup person?
3. What is the fastest time to manufacture a table with the
original crew if Cathy is moved to either preparation or
finishing?
4. Whoever performs the packaging function is severely un-
derutilized. Can you find a better way of utilizing the four-
or five-person crew than either giving each a single job or
allowing each to manufacture an entire table? How many
tables could be manufactured per day with this scheme?

Introduction
This chapter presents a series of other important mathematical programming models that arise
when some of the basic assumptions of LP are made more or less restrictive. For example,
one assumption of LP is that decision variables can take on fractional values such as
. Yet a large number of business problems can be solved
only if variables have integer values. When an airline decides how many Boeing 757s or Boeing
777s to purchase, it can’t place an order for 5.38 aircraft; it must order 4, 5, 6, 7, or some other
integer amount. In this chapter we present the general topic of integer programming, and we
specifically consider the use of special variables that must be either 0 or 1.
A major limitation of LP is that it forces the decision maker to state one objective only. But
what if a business has several objectives? Management may indeed want to maximize profit, but
it might also want to maximize market share, maintain full employment, and minimize costs.
Many of these goals can be conflicting and difficult to quantify. South States Power and Light,
for example, wants to build a nuclear power plant in Taft, Louisiana. Its objectives are to maxi-
mize power generated, reliability, and safety, and to minimize cost of operating the system and
the environmental effects on the community. Goal programming is an extension to LP that can
permit multiple objectives such as these.
Linear programming can, of course, be applied only to cases in which the constraints and
objective function are linear. Yet in many situations this is not the case. The price of various
products, for example, may be a function of the number of units produced. As more are made,
the price per unit decreases. Hence an objective function may read as  follows:
Because of the squared terms, this is a nonlinear programming problem.
Let’s examine each of these extensions of LP—integer, goal, and nonlinear programming—
one at a time.
 Maximize profit = 25X1 - 0.4X1
2 + 30X2 - 0.5X2
2
X1 = 0.33, X2 = 1.57, or X3 = 109.4
Integer programming is the
extension of LP that solves
problems requiring integer
solutions.
Goal programming is the
extension of LP that permits
more than one objective to be
stated.
Nonlinear programming is the
case in which objectives or
constraints are nonlinear.
10.2
Integer Programming
An integer programming model is a model that has constraints and an objective function identi-
cal to that formulated by LP. The only difference is that one or more of the decision variables
has to take on an integer value in the final solution. There are three types of integer program-
ming problems:
1. Pure integer programming problems are cases in which all variables are required to have
integer values.
2. Mixed-integer programming problems are cases in which some, but not all, of the decision
variables are required to have integer values.
3. Zero–one integer programming problems are special cases in which all the decision
variables must have integer solution values of 0 or 1.
Solving an integer programming problem is much more difficult than solving an LP prob-
lem. The solution time required to solve some of these may be excessive even on the fastest
computer.
Harrison Electric Company Example of Integer Programming
The Harrison Electric Company, located in Chicago’s Old Town area, produces two products
popular with home renovators: old-fashioned chandeliers and ceiling fans. Both the chandeliers
and fans require a two-step production process involving wiring and assembly. It takes about
2 hours to wire each chandelier and 3 hours to wire a ceiling fan. Final assembly of the chande-
liers and fans requires 6 and 5 hours, respectively. The production capability is such that only
12 hours of wiring time and 30 hours of assembly time are available. If each chandelier

produced nets the firm $7 and each fan $6, Harrison’s production mix decision can be formu-
lated using LP as follows:
where
With only two variables and two constraints, Harrison’s production planner, Wes Wallace,
employed the graphical LP approach (see Figure 10.1) to generate the optimal solution of
chandeliers and 
ceiling fans during the production cycle. Recognizing that
the company could not produce and sell a fraction of a product, Wes decided that he was dealing
with an integer programming problem.
It seemed to Wes that the simplest approach was to round off the optimal fractional solu-
tions for 
and 
to integer values of 
chandeliers and 
ceiling fans. Unfortu-
nately, rounding can produce two problems. First, the new integer solution may not be in the
feasible region and thus is not a practical answer. This is the case if we round to 
.
Second, even if we round off to a feasible solution, such as 
, it may not be the
optimal feasible integer solution.
Listing all feasible solutions and selecting the one with the best objective function value is
called the enumeration method. Obviously this can be quite tedious for even small problems,
and it is virtually impossible for large problems as the number of feasible integer solutions is
extremely large.

Although enumeration is feasible
for some small integer program-
ming problems, it can be difficult
or impossible for large ones.
Rounding off is one way to reach
integer solution values, but it
often does not yield the best
solution.

CHAPTER 10 • INTEGER PROGRAMMING, GOAL PROGRAMMING, AND NONLINEAR PROGRAMMING
Table 10.1 lists the entire set of integer-valued solutions to the Harrison Electric problem.
By inspecting the right-hand column, we see that the optimal integer solution is
Note that this integer restriction results in a lower profit level than the original optimal LP solu-
tion. As a matter of fact, an integer programming solution can never produce a greater profit
than the LP solution to the same problem; usually, it means a lesser value.
Using Software to Solve the Harrison Integer Programming Problem
QM for Windows and Excel spreadsheets are capable of handling integer programming prob-
lems such as the Harrison Electric case. Program 10.1A illustrates the input data to QM for
Windows, and Program 10.1B provides the results.
To use QM for Windows, select the Integer & Mixed Integer Programming module. Specify
the number of constraints and the number of variables. Program 10.1A provides the input
screen, with data entered for the Harrison Electric example. The last row of the table allows you
to classify each variable according to type of variable (Integer, Real, or 0–1). Once all variables
have been correctly specified, click Solve, and you will see the output in Program 10.1B.
Solver in Excel 2010 can also be used to solve this problem, as shown in Program 10.2. The
Solver parameters and selections are shown, and the key formulas are displayed. To specify that
the variables must be integers, a special constraint is entered in Solver. After opening the Solver
Parameters window, select Add just as you would do to enter other constraints. When the
Add Constraint window opens, enter the range containing the solution values, as shown in
Program 10.2. Then click the tab to open the drop-down menu and then change the type of con-
straint to int, for integer. Click OK to return to the Solver Parameters window. Then enter the
other constraints, specify the parameters and selections, and click Solve. The solution is shown
to be 5 chandeliers and 0 fans, for a profit of $35.
X1 = 5 chandeliers, X2 = 0 ceiling fans, with a profit = $35
An important concept to
understand is that an integer
programming solution can never
be better than the solution to the
same LP problem. The integer
problem is usually worse in terms
of higher cost or lower profit.

Mixed-Integer Programming Problem Example
Although the Harrison Electric example was a pure integer problem, there are many situations
in which some of the variables are restricted to be integers and others are not. The following is
an example of such a mixed-integer programming problem.
Bagwell Chemical Company, in Jackson, Mississippi, produces two industrial chemicals.
The first product, xyline, must be produced in 50-pound bags; the second, hexall, is sold by the
pound in dry bulk and hence can be produced in any quantity. Both xyline and hexall are com-
posed of three ingredients—A, B, and C—as follows:
Defining the Problem
The U. S. Postal Service (USPS) operates one of the largest transporation networks in the world, delivering
one-fifth of a trillion items every year. The inherent transportation-related problems are, obviously, very
large. Nevertheless, USPS’s problem is how to deliver mail in the most cost-efficient manner possible.
Developing a Model
A large-scale integer program known as the Highway Corridor Analytical Program (HCAP) was developed
to help solve the problem. More specifically, the HCAP solves a Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) with known
pickup and delivery locations. That is, the model takes into account all the different modes of transporta-
tion, the capacities inherent to the system, all the pickup locations, and all the delivery locations and then
assigns trucks to routes as the (binary) decision variable of interest.
Acquiring Input Data
Geographic information system (GIS) data of all the pickup and delivery locations is integrated into the
model. Realistic time and distance constraints were placed on the model to prevent drivers from being
assigned a pickup in one area and a delivery in an area too far away.
Testing the Solution
The model was loaded into a large-scale mathematical programming solver. Several versions and models
were tested.
Analyizing the Results
Decision makers found improvements in several areas. For example, one of the model outputs resulted in
a 20% reduction in redundant trips.
Implementing the Results
USPS has already realized over $5 million in transportation savings due to its implementation of the HCAP
integer programming optimization model. Efforts are under way to seek out additional efficiencies through
the use of HCAP.

Solution for Bagwell
Chemical Problem
If we let X = number of 50-pound bags of xyline produced and Y = number of pounds of hexall
(in dry bulk) mixed, Bagwell’s problem can be described with mixed-integer  programming:
.
Note that Y represents bulk weight of hexall and is not required to be integer valued.
USING QM FOR WINDOWS AND EXCEL TO SOLVE BAGWELL’S INTEGER PROGRAMMING
MODEL The solution to Bagwell’s problem is to produce 44 bags of xyline and 20 pounds of
hexall, yielding a profit of $3,770. (The optimal linear solution, by the way, is to produce 44.444
bags of xyline and 0 pounds of hexall, yielding a profit of $3,777.78.) This is first illustrated in
Program 10.3, which uses the Mixed Integer Programming module in QM for Windows. Note
that variable X is identified as Integer, while Y is Real in Program 10.3.

Mixed-Integer Programming in the IBM
Supply Chain
The manufacture of semiconductors is a very expensive opera-
tion, often requiring investments in the billions of dollars. The IBM
Systems and Technology Group has used mixed-integer program-
ming (MIP) along with other operations research techniques to
plan and optimize its semiconductor supply chain. The business
of supply-chain optimization (SCO) has been deemed business
critical and must incorporate a variety of planning criteria and
constraints.
IBM uses a central planning engine (CPE) to balance the supply
chain’s resources against the semiconductor demand. The MIP is an
important part of this CPE. The MIP model is a cost-minimization
problem with constraints related to material flows and other aspect
of the supply chain.
Some of the models involved in SCO include sourcing among
multiple plants, the logistics of interplant shipping, and the devel-
opment of production plans for all the plants within the system.
They may involve a planning horizon of a few days, a few months,
or even a few years, depending on the specific type of application.
While LP is commonly used in supply-chain modeling, it is neces-
sary to use models in which some of the variables are required to
be integers. The resulting MIP models are so large (millions of vari-
ables) that they cannot be solved with even the fastest computers.
Therefore, the IBM Systems and Technology Group developed
heuristic methods to solve the optimization models as part of the
company’s advanced planning systems.
The benefits of the CPE are many. The on-time deliveries
improved by 15%. A 25% to 30% reduction in inventory was
observed as a result of the model. The company also observed an
improvement in asset allocation of between 2% and 4% of costs.
This model allowed “what-if” questions to be quickly answered—
a process that was not possible in the past. Strategic planning
was also facilitated by the CPE. IBM benefited greatly from the
use of MIP in managing the semiconductor supply chain.

Modeling with 0–1 (Binary) Variables
In this section we demonstrate how 0–1 variables can be used to model several diverse situa-
tions. Typically a 0–1 variable is assigned a value of 0 if a certain condition is not met and 1 if
the condition is met. Another name for a 0–1 variable is a binary variable. A common problem
of this type, the assignment problem, involves deciding which individuals to assign to a set of
jobs. (This is discussed in Chapter 9.) In this assignment problem, a value of 1 indicates a per-
son is assigned to a specific job, and a value of 0 indicates the assignment was not made. We
present other types of 0–1 problems to show the wide applicability of this modeling technique.
Capital Budgeting Example
A common capital budgeting decision involves selecting from a set of possible projects when
budget limitations make it impossible to select all of these. A separate 0–1 variable can be
defined for each project. We will see this in the following example.
Quemo Chemical Company is considering three possible improvement projects for its plant:
a new catalytic converter, a new software program for controlling operations, and expanding the
warehouse used for storage. Capital requirements and budget limitations in the next two years
prevent the firm from undertaking all of these at this time. The net present value (the future value
of the project discounted back to the present time) of each of the projects, the capital require-
ments, and the available funds for the next two years are given in Table 10.2.
To formulate this as an integer programming problem, we identify the objective function
and the constraints as follows:
 Total funds used in year 2 … $16,000
 subject to
Total funds used in year 1 … $20,000
 Maximize net present value of projects undertaken

Limiting the Number of Alternatives Selected
One common use of 0–1 variables involves limiting the number of projects or items that are se-
lected from a group. Suppose that in the Quemo Chemical Company example, the company is
required to select no more than two of the three projects regardless of the funds available. This
could be modeled by adding the following constraint to the problem:
If we wished to force the selection of exactly two of the three projects for funding, the following
constraint should be used:
This forces exactly two of the variables to have values of 1, whereas the other variable must have
a value of 0.
Dependent Selections
At times the selection of one project depends in some way upon the selection of another project.
This situation can be modeled with the use of 0–1 variables. Now suppose in the Quemo Chem-
ical problem that the new catalytic converter could be purchased only if the software was pur-
chased also. The following constraint would force this to occur:
or, equivalently,
Thus, if the software is not purchased, the value of 
is 0, and the value of 
must be 0 also
because of this constraint. However, if the software is purchased 
, then it is possible
that the catalytic converter could be purchased 
also, although this is not required.
If we wished for the catalytic converter and the software projects to either both be selected
or both not be selected, we should use the following constraint:
or, equivalently,
Thus, if either of these variables is equal to 0, the other must be 0 also. If either of these is equal
to 1, the other must be 1 also.
Fixed-Charge Problem Example
Often businesses are faced with decisions involving a fixed charge that will affect the cost of fu-
ture operations. Building a new factory or entering into a long-term lease on an existing facility
would involve a fixed cost that might vary depending upon the size of the facility and the loca-
tion. Once a factory is built, the variable production costs will be affected by the labor cost in
the particular city where it is located. An example follows.
Sitka Manufacturing is planning to build at least one new plant, and three cities are being
considered: Baytown, Texas; Lake Charles, Louisiana; and Mobile, Alabama. Once the plant or
plants have been constructed, the company wishes to have sufficient capacity to produce at least
38,000 units each year. The costs associated with the possible locations are given in Table 10.3.
In modeling this as an integer program, the objective function is to minimize the total of the
fixed cost and the variable cost. The constraints are: (1) total production capacity is at least 38,000;
(2) number of units produced at the Baytown plant is 0 if the plant is not built, and it is no more
than 21,000 if the plant is built; (3) number of units produced at the Lake Charles plant is 0 if the
plant is not built, and it is no more than 20,000 if the plant is built; (4) number of units produced at
the Mobile plant is 0 if the plant is not built, and it is no more than 19,000 if the plant is built.

similarly used to guarantee that no units are produced at the other locations if the plants are not
built. The optimal solution, shown in Program 10.6, is
This means that factories will be built at Lake Charles and Mobile. Each of these will produce
19,000 units each year, and the total annual cost will be $1,757,000.
Financial Investment Example
Numerous financial applications exist with 0–1 variables. A very common type of problem in-
volves selecting from a group of investment opportunities. The following example illustrates
this application.
The Houston-based investment firm of Simkin, Simkin, and Steinberg specializes in rec-
ommending oil stock portfolios for wealthy clients. One such client has made the following
specifications: (1) at least two Texas oil firms must be in the portfolio, (2) no more than one in-
vestment can be made in foreign oil companies, (3) one of the two California oil stocks must
be purchased. The client has up to $3 million available for investments and insists on purchas-
ing large blocks of shares of each company that he invests in. Table 10.4 describes various
stocks that Simkin considers. The objective is to maximize annual return on investment subject
to the constraints.

Goal Programming
In today’s business environment, profit maximization or cost minimization are not always the
only objectives that a firm sets forth. Often, maximizing total profit is just one of several goals,
including such contradictory objectives as maximizing market share, maintaining full employ-
ment, providing quality ecological management, minimizing noise level in the neighborhood,
and meeting numerous other noneconomic goals.

Continental Airlines Saves $40 Million
Using CrewSolver
Airlines use state-of-the-art processes and automated tools to
develop schedules that maximize profit. These schedules will
assign aircraft to specific routes, and then schedule pilots and
flight attendant crews to each of these aircraft. When disruptions
occur, planes and personnel are often left in positions where they
are unable to adhere to the next day’s assignments. Airlines face
schedule disruptions from a variety of unexpected reasons such
as bad weather, mechanical problems, and crew unavailability.
In 1993, Continental Airlines began an effort to develop a
system of dealing with disruptions in real time. Working with
CALEB Technologies, Continental developed the CrewSolver and
OptSolver systems (based on 0–1 integer programming models)
to produce comprehensive recovery solutions for both aircraft and
crews. These solutions retain revenue and promote customer sat-
isfaction by reducing flight cancellations and minimizing delays.
These crew recovery solutions are low cost while maintaining a
high quality of life for pilots and flight attendants.
In late 2000 and throughout 2001, Continental and other air-
lines experienced four major disruptions. The first two were due to
severe snowstorms in early January and in March 2001. The Hous-
ton floods caused by Tropical Storm Allison closed a major hub in
June 2001 and left aircraft in locations where they were not sched-
uled to be. The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 left aircraft
and crews scattered about and totally disrupted the flight sched-
ules. The CrewSolver system provided a faster and more efficient
recovery than had been possible in the past. It is estimated that the
CrewSolver system saved approximately $40 million for these ma-
jor disruptions in 2001. This system also saved additional money
and made recovery much easier when there were minor disruptions
due to local weather problems at other times throughout the year.

Airlines,” Interfaces 33, (January–February 2003): 5–22.
IN ACTION
The shortcoming of mathematical programming techniques such as linear and integer
programming is that their objective function is measured in one dimension only. It’s not possible
for LP to have multiple goals unless they are all measured in the same units (such as dollars), a
highly unusual situation. An important technique that has been developed to supplement LP is
called goal programming.
Goal programming permits
multiple goals.

Goal programming is capable of handling decision problems involving multiple goals.
A four-decade old concept, it began with the work of Charnes and Cooper in 1961 and was
refined and extended by Lee and Ignizio in the 1970s and 1980s (see the Bibliography).
In typical decision-making situations, the goals set by management can be achieved only at
the expense of other goals. It is necessary to establish a hierarchy of importance among these
goals so that lower-priority goals are tackled only after higher-priority goals are satisfied. Since
it is not always possible to achieve every goal to the extent the decision maker desires, goal pro-
gramming attempts to reach a satisfactory level of multiple objectives. This, of course, differs
from LP, which tries to find the best possible outcome for a single objective. Nobel laureate
Herbert A. Simon, of Carnegie-Mellon University, states that modern managers may not be able
to optimize, but may instead have to “satisfice” or “come as close as possible” to reaching goals.
This is the case with models such as goal programming.
How, specifically, does goal programming differ from LP? The objective function is the
main difference. Instead of trying to maximize or minimize the objective function directly, with
goal programming we try to minimize deviations between set goals and what we can actually
achieve within the given constraints. In the LP simplex approach, such deviations are called
slack and surplus variables. Because the coefficient for each of these in the objective function is
zero, slack and surplus variables do not have an impact on the optimal solution. In goal program-
ming, the deviational variables are typically the only variables in the objective function, and the
objective is to minimize the total of these deviational variables.
When the goal programming model is formulated, the computational algorithm is almost
the same as a minimization problem solved by the simplex method.
Example of Goal Programming: Harrison Electric Company Revisited
To illustrate the formulation of a goal programming problem, let’s look back at the Harrison
Electric Company case presented earlier in this chapter as an integer programming problem.
That problem’s LP formulation, you recall, is
where
We saw that if Harrison’s management had a single goal, say profit, LP could be used to
find the optimal solution. But let’s assume that the firm is moving to a new location during a
particular production period and feels that maximizing profit is not a realistic goal. Management
sets a profit level, which would be satisfactory during the adjustment period, of $30. We now
have a goal programming problem in which we want to find the production mix that achieves
this goal as closely as possible, given the production time constraints. This simple case will pro-
vide a good starting point for tackling more complicated goal programs.
We first define two deviational variables:
Now we can state the Harrison Electric problem as a single-goal programming model:
X1, X2, d1
-, d1
+ Ú 0
 6X1 +
5X2

5X2 … 30 1assembly hours2

   2X1 +
3X2 … 12 1wiring hours2
 Maximize profit = $7X1 + $6X2
408
CHAPTER 10 • INTEGER PROGRAMMING, GOAL PROGRAMMING, AND NONLINEAR PROGRAMMING
Goal programming “satisfices,”
as opposed to LP, which tries to
“optimize.” This means coming
as close as possible to reaching
goals.
The objective function is the
main difference between goal
programming and LP.
In goal programming we want to
minimize deviational variables,
which are the only terms in the
objective function.

10.4
GOAL PROGRAMMING
409
Note that the first constraint states that the profit made, 
, plus any underachieve-
ment of profit minus any overachievement of profit has to equal the target of $30. For example,
if 
chandeliers and 
ceiling fans, then $33 profit has been made. This exceeds $30
by $3, so 
must be equal to 3. Since the profit goal constraint was overachieved, Harrison did
not underachieve and 
will clearly be equal to zero. This problem is now ready for solution
by a goal programming algorithm.
If the target profit of $30 is exactly achieved, we see that both 
and 
are equal to zero.
The objective function will also be minimized at zero. If Harrison’s management was only con-
cerned with underachievement of the target goal, how would the objective function change? It
would be as follows: minimize underachievement
. This is also a reasonable goal since
the firm would probably not be upset with an overachievement of its target.
In general, once all goals and constraints are identified in a problem, management should
analyze each goal to see if underachievement or overachievement of that goal is an acceptable
situation. If overachievement is acceptable, the appropriate 
variable can be eliminated from
the objective function. If underachievement is okay, the 
variable should be dropped. If man-
agement seeks to attain a goal exactly, both 
and 
must appear in the objective function.
Extension to Equally Important Multiple Goals
Let’s now look at the situation in which Harrison’s management wants to achieve several goals,
each equal in priority.
Goal 1: to produce profit of $30 if possible during the production period
Goal 2: to fully utilize the available wiring department hours
Goal 3: to avoid overtime in the assembly department
Goal 4: to meet a contract requirement to produce at least seven ceiling fans
The deviational variables can be defined as follows:
Management is unconcerned about whether there is overachievement of the profit goal, over-
time in the wiring department, idle time in the assembly department, or more than seven ceiling
fans are produced: hence, 
, and 
may be omitted from the objective function. The
new objective function and constraints are
Ranking Goals with Priority Levels
In most goal programming problems, one goal will be more important than another, which in
turn will be more important than a third. The idea is that goals can be ranked with respect to their
importance in management’s eyes. Lower-order goals are considered only after higher-order
goals are met. Priorities (
) are assigned to each deviational variable—with the ranking that
is the most important goal, 
the next most important, then 
, and so on.

We need a clear definition of
deviational variables, such as
these.
Deviational variables are zero if
a goal is completely obtained.
A key idea in goal programming
is that one goal is more
important than another.
Priorities are assigned to each
deviational variable.

Let’s say Harrison Electric sets the priorities shown in the following table:
410
CHAPTER 10 • INTEGER PROGRAMMING, GOAL PROGRAMMING, AND NONLINEAR PROGRAMMING
Priority 1 is infinitely more
important than Priority 2, which
is infinitely more important than
the next goal, and so on.
GOAL
PRIORITY
Reach a profit as much above $30 as possible
P1
Fully use wiring department hours available
P2
Avoid assembly department overtime
P3
Produce at least seven ceiling fans
P4
This means, in effect, that the priority of meeting the profit goal 
is infinitely more
important than the wiring goal 
, which is, in turn, infinitely more important than the assem-
bly goal 
, which is infinitely more important than producing at least seven ceiling fans 
.
With ranking of goals considered, the new objective function becomes
The constraints remain identical to the previous ones.
Goal Programming with Weighted Goals
When priority levels are used in goal programming, any goal in the top priority level is infinitely
more important than the goals in lower priority levels. However, there may be times when one
goal is more important than another goal, but it may be only two or three times as important.
Instead of placing these goals in different priority levels, they would be placed in the same pri-
ority level but with different weights. When using weighted goal programming, the coefficients
in the objective function for the deviational variables include both the priority level and the
weight. If all goals are in the same priority level, then simply using the weights as objective
function coefficients is sufficient.
Consider the Harrison Electric example, in which the least important goal is goal 4 (pro-
duce at least seven ceiling fans). Suppose Harrison decides to add another goal of producing at
least two chandeliers. The goal of seven ceiling fans is considered twice as important as this
goal, so both of these should be in the same priority level. The goal of 2 chandeliers is assigned

The Use of Goal Programming for Tuberculosis
Drug Allocation in Manila
Allocation of resources is critical when applied to the health in-
dustry. It is a matter of life and death when neither the right sup-
ply nor the correct quantity is available to meet patient demand.
This was the case faced by the Manila (Philippines) Health Center,
whose drug supply to patients afflicted with Category I tubercu-
losis (TB) was not being efficiently allocated to its 45 regional
health centers. When the TB drug supply does not reach patients
on time, the disease becomes worse and can result in death. Only
74% of TB patients were being cured in Manila, 11% short of the
85% target cure rate set by the government. Unlike other dis-
eases, TB can only be treated with four medicines and cannot be
cured by alternative drugs.
Researchers at the Mapka Institute of Technology set out
to create a model, using goal programming, to optimize the
allocation of resources for TB treatment while considering sup-
ply constraints. The objective function of the model was to
meet the target cure rate of 85% (which is the equivalent of
minimizing the underachievement in the allocation of anti-TB
drugs to the 45 centers). Four goal constraints considered the
interrelationships among variables in the distribution system.
Goal 1 was to satisfy the medication requirement (a 6-month
regimen) for each patient. Goal 2 was to supply each health
center with the proper allocation. Goal 3 was to satisfy the
cure rate of 85%. Goal 4 was to satisfy the drug requirements
of each health center.
The goal programming model successfully dealt with all of
these goals and raised the TB cure rate to 88%, a 13% improve-
ment in drug allocation over the previous distribution approach.
This means that 335 lives per year were saved through this
thoughtful use of goal programming.

The new objective function value would be
Note that the ceiling fan goal has a weight of 2. The weight for the chandelier goal is 1. Techni-
cally all of the goals in the other priority levels are assigned weights of 1 also.
USING QM FOR WINDOWS TO SOLVE HARRISON’S PROBLEM QM for Windows goal program-
ming module is illustrated in Programs 10.8A and 10.8B. The input screen is shown first, in
Program 10.8A. Note in this first screen that there are two priority level columns for each con-
straint. For this example, the priority for either the positive or the negative deviation will be zero
since the objective function does not contain both types of deviational variables for any of these
goals. If a problem had a goal with both deviational variables in the objective function, both pri-
ority level columns for this goal (constraint) would contain values other than zero. Also, the
weight for each deviational variable contained in the objective function is listed as 1. (It is 0 if
the variable is not appearing in the objective function.) If different weights are used, they would
be placed in the appropriate weight column within one priority level.
The solution with an analysis of deviations and goal achievement is shown in Program
10.8B. We see that the first two constraints have negative deviational variables equal to 0, indi-
cating full achievement of those goals. In fact, the positive deviational variables both have val-
ues of 6, indicating overachievement of these goals by 6 units each. Goal (constraint) 3 has both
deviational variables equal to 0, indicating complete achievement of that goal, whereas goal 4
has a negative deviational variable equal to 1, indicating underachievement by 1 unit.

Linear, integer, and goal programming all assume that a problem’s objective function and con-

more of the constraints are nonlinear.

NLP problems, a particular solution may be better than any other point nearby, but it may
not be the overall best point. This is called a local optimum, and the overall best solution is
called the global optimum. Thus, for a particular problem, a solution technique may indicate
that an optimum solution has been found, but it is only a local optimum, so there may be a
global optimum that is better. The mathematics involved in solving these problems is beyond
the scope of this text. We will rely on Solver in Excel to solve the nonlinear problems pre-
sented in this section.
In this section, we examine three categories of NLP problems and illustrate how Excel
can be used to search for the solution to these problems. In Solved Problem 10–3, we will see
how NLP in Excel can help find the best parameter to use in an exponential smoothing fore-
casting model.
Nonlinear Objective Function and Linear Constraints
The Great Western Appliance Company sells two models of toaster ovens, the Microtoaster 
and the Self-Clean Toaster Oven 
. The firm earns a profit of $28 for each Microtoaster re-
gardless of the number sold. Profits for the Self-Clean model, however, increase as more units
are sold because of fixed overhead. Profit on this model may be expressed as 
.
Hence the firm’s objective function is nonlinear:
Great Western’s profit is subject to two linear constraints on production capacity and sales

When an objective function contains squared terms (such as 
) and the problem’s con-
straints are linear, it is called a quadratic programming problem. A number of useful problems
in the field of portfolio selection fall into this category. Quadratic programs can be solved by a
modified method of the simplex method. Such work is outside the scope of this book but can be
found in sources listed in the Bibliography.
The solution to the Great Western Appliance nonlinear programming problem is shown in
Program 10.9. This was found using Solver in Excel 2010, and there are two important features
of this spreadsheet that are different from the previous linear and integer programming examples.

Goal Programming Model for Prison
Expenditures in Virginia
Prisons across the United States are overcrowded, and there is
need for immediate expansion of their capacity and replacement
or renovation of obsolete facilities. This study demonstrates how
goal programming was used on the capital allocation problem
faced by the Department of Corrections of Virginia.
The expenditure items considered by the Virginia corrections
department included new and renovated maximum, medium,
and minimum security facilities; community diversion programs;
and personnel increases. The goal programming technique forced
all prison projects to be completely accepted or rejected.
Model variables defined the construction, renovation, or es-
tablishment of a particular type of correctional facility for a spe-
cific location or purpose and indicated the people required by
the facilities. The goal constraints fell into five categories: addi-
tional inmate capacity created by new and renovated correc-
tional facilities; operating and personnel costs associated with
each expenditure item; the impact of facility construction and
renovation on imprisonment, sentence length, and early releases
and parole; the mix of different facility types required by the sys-
tem; and the personnel requirements resulting from the various
capital expenditures for correctional facilities.
The solution results for Virginia were one new maximum
security facility for drug, alcohol, and psychiatric treatment
activities; one new minimum security facility for youthful
offenders; two new regular minimum security facilities; two
new community diversion programs in urban areas, renovation
of one existing medium security and one minimum security
facility; 250 new correctional officers; four new administrators;
46 new treatment specialist/counselors; and six new medical
personnel.

First, the solving method used for this in Solver is GRG Nonlinear instead of Simplex LP. The
second change involves the objective function and the changing cells. For the sake of consistency,
values for both 
(cell C4) and 
(cell D7) are shown in Program 10.9. However, cell D7 is
simply cell C4 squared. Thus, when cell C4 changes, D7 will automatically change, and the
Changing cells specified in Solver are B4:C4, while D7 is not included.

Summary
This chapter addresses three special types of LP problems. The
first, integer programming, examines LP problems that cannot
have fractional answers. We also note that there are three types
of integer programming problems: (1) pure or all-integer pro-
grams, (2) mixed problems, in which some solution variables
need not be integer, and (3) 0–1 problems, in which all solu-
tions are either 0 or 1. We also demonstrate how 0–1 variables
can be used to model special situations such as fixed charge
problems. QM for Windows and Excel are used to illustrate
computer approaches to these problems.
The latter part of the chapter deals with goal program-
ming. This extension of LP allows problems to have multiple
goals. Again, software such as QM for Windows is a powerful
tool in solving this offshoot of LP. Finally, the advanced topic
of NLP is introduced as a special mathematical programming
problem. Excel is seen to be a useful tool in solving simple
NLP models.
However, it is important to remember that the solution
found for an NLP problem might be a local optimum and not a
global optimum.

Deviational Variables
Terms that are minimized in a goal
programming problem. Like slack variables in LP, they
are real. They are the only terms in the objective function.
Global Optimum
The overall best solution to a nonlinear
programming problem.
Goal Programming
A mathematical programming
technique that permits decision makers to set and prioritize
multiple objectives.
Integer Programming
A mathematical programming tech-
nique that produces integer solutions to linear programming
problems.
Local Optimum
A solution to a nonliner programming
problem which is better than any nearby point, but which
may not be the global optimum.
Nonlinear Programming
A category of mathematical pro-
gramming techniques that allows the objective function
and/or constraints to be nonlinear.
Satisficing
The process of coming as close as possible to
reaching your set of objectives.
0–1 Integer Programming
Problems in which all decision
variables must have integer values of 0 or 1. This is also
called a binary variable

Recall the Harrison Electric Company goal programming problem seen in Section 10.4. Its LP formula-
tion was
where
number of chandeliers produced
number of ceiling fans produced
Reformulate Harrison Electrical as a goal programming model with the following goals:
Priority 1: Produce at least 4 chandeliers and 3 ceiling fans.
Priority 2: Limit overtime in the assembly department to 10 hours and in the wiring department to
6 hours.
Priority 3: Maximize profit.
Solution
In the priority 3 goal constraint, the 99,999 represents an unrealistically high profit. It is just a mathe-
matical trick to use as a target so that we can get as close as possible to the maximum profit.
Solved Problem 10-3
In Chapter 5, the exponential smoothing method for forecasting time series was presented. Program
10.13A provides an example of this, with the smoothing constant (α) selected to be 0.1. The fore-
cast in time period 1 is assumed to be perfect, so the error and the absolute value of the error are
both 0. The mean absolute deviation (MAD) is the measure of accuracy, and the first time period er-
ror is not used in computing this since it was simply assumed to be perfect. The MAD is very de-
pendent on the value of α. Use Excel to find the value of α that will minimize the MAD. Hint:
Instead of writing the entire objective function, simply use the cell already developed in Excel for
the MAD. Remember, α must be between 0 and 1.
Solution
The MAD is a nonlinear function, so Solver in Excel can be used to solve this. There is only one con-
straint: The smoothing constant, α, must be less than or equal to 1. This can be entered directly into the
Add Constraint window in Solver, with a 1 entered on the right-hand side of the inequality. Program
10.13B provides the information and the final solution for this. The value for α that minimizes the MAD
is 0.3478, and this yields an MAD of 16.70.
Note: Solver can be used in a similar manner to find the best weights to use in a weighted moving aver-
age forecast.

10-11 A group of college students is planning a camping
trip during the upcoming break. The group must
hike several miles through the woods to get to the
campsite, and anything that is needed on this trip
must be packed in a knapsack and carried to the
campsite. One particular student, Tina Shawl, has
identified eight items that she would like to take on
the trip, but the combined weight is too great to take
all of them. She has decided to rate the utility of
each item on a scale of 1 to 100, with 100 being the
most beneficial. The item weights in pounds and
their utility values are given below.

(a) Formulate this as a 0–1 programming problem to
maximize the total utility of the items carried.
Solve this knapsack problem using a computer.
(b) Suppose item number 3 is an extra battery pack,
which may be used with several of the other
items. Tina has decided that she will only take
item number 5, a CD player, if she also takes item
number 3. On the other hand, if she takes item
number 3, she may or may not take item number
5. Modify this problem to reflect this and solve
the new problem.

10-19 Triangle Utilities provides electricity for three cities.
The company has four electric generators that are
used to provide electricity. The main generator oper-
ates 24 hours per day, with an occasional shutdown
for routine maintenance. Three other generators
(1, 2, and 3) are available to provide additional
power when needed. A startup cost is incurred each
time one of these generators is started. The startup
costs are $6,000 for 1, $5,000 for 2, and $4,000 for
3. These generators are used in the following ways:
A generator may be started at 6:00 A.M. and run for
either 8 hours or 16 hours, or it may be started at
2:00 P.M. and run for 8 hours (until 10:00 P.M.). All
generators except the main generator are shut down
at 10:00 P.M. Forecasts indicate the need for 3,200
megawatts more than provided by the main genera-
tor before 2:00 P.M., and this need goes up to 5,700
megawatts between 2:00 and 10:00 P.M. Generator 1
may provide up to 2,400 megawatts, generator 2
may provide up to 2,100 megawatts, and generator 3
may provide up to 3,300 megawatts. The cost per
megawatt used per eight hour period is $8 for 1, $9
for 2, and $7 for 3.

10-20 The campaign manager for a politician who is run-
ning for reelection to a political office is planning
the campaign. Four ways to advertise have been se-
lected: TV ads, radio ads, billboards, and newspaper
ads. The cost of these are $900 for each TV ad, $500
for each radio ad, $600 for a billboard for one
month, and $180 for each newspaper ad. The audi-
ence reached by each type of advertising has been
estimated to be 40,000 for each TV ad, 32,000 for
each radio ad, 34,000 for each billboard, and 17,000
for each newspaper ad. The total monthly advertis-
ing budget is $16,000. The following goals have
been established and ranked:
1. The number of people reached should be at
least 1,500,000.
2. The total monthly advertising budget should
not be exceeded.
3. Together, the number of ads on either TV or
radio should be at least 6.
4. No more than 10 ads of any one type of ad-
vertising should be used.
(a) Formulate this as a goal programming problem.
(b) Solve this using computer software.
(c) Which goals are completely met and which of
them are not?
10-21 Geraldine Shawhan is president of Shawhan File
Works, a firm that manufactures two types of metal
file cabinets. The demand for her two-drawer model
is up to 600 cabinets per week; demand for a three-
drawer cabinet is limited to 400 per week. Shawhan
File Works has a weekly operating capacity of 1,300
hours, with the two-drawer cabinet taking 1 hour
to produce and the three-drawer cabinet requiring
2 hours. Each two-drawer model sold yields a $10
profit, and the profit for the large model is $15.
Shawhan has listed the following goals in order of
importance:
1. Attain a profit as close to $11,000 as possi-
ble each week.
2. Avoid underutilization of the firm’s produc-
tion capacity.
3. Sell as many two- and three-drawer cabinets
as the demand indicates.

requires 8 hours of labor, a 256MB chip takes 13
hours, and a 512MB chip requires 16 hours.
Hilliard’s monthly production capacity is 1,200
hours. Mr. Blank, the firm’s sales manager, esti-
mates that the maximum monthly sales of the
64MB, 256MB, and 512MB chips are 40, 50, and
60, respectively. The company has the following
goals (ranked in order from most important to least
important):
1. Fill an order from the best customer for thirty
64MB chips and thirty-five 256MB chips.
2. Provide sufficient chips to at least equal the
sales estimates set by Mr. Blank.
3. Avoid underutilization of the production
capacity.

10-26 Mick Garcia, a certified financial planner (CFP) has
been asked by a client to invest $250,000. This money
may be placed in stocks, bonds, or a mutual fund in
real estate. The expected return on investment is 13%
for stocks, 8% for bonds, and 10% for real estate.
While the client would like a very high expected re-
turn, she would be satisfied with a 10% expected re-
turn on her money. Due to risk considerations, several
goals have been established to keep the risk at an ac-
ceptable level. One goal is to put at least 30% of the
money in bonds. Another goal is that the amount of
money in real estate should not exceed 50% of the
money invested in stocks and bonds combined. In ad-
dition to these goals, there is one absolute restriction.
Under no circumstances should more than $150,000
be invested in any one area.

Case Study
Schank Marketing Research
Schank Marketing Research has just signed contracts to con-
duct studies for four clients. At present, three project managers
are free for assignment to the tasks. Although all are capable of
handling each assignment, the times and costs to complete the
studies depend on the experience and knowledge of each man-
ager. Using his judgment, John Schank, the president, has been
able to establish a cost for each possible assignment. These
costs, which are really the salaries each manager would draw
on each task, are summarized in the following table.
Schank is very hesitant about neglecting NASA, which has
been an important customer in the past. (NASA has employed
the firm to study the public’s attitude toward the Space Shuttle
and proposed Space Station.) In addition, Schank has promised
to try to provide Ruth a salary of at least $3,000 on his next as-
signment. From previous contracts, Schank also knows that
Gardener does not get along well with the management at CBT
Television, so he hopes to avoid assigning her to CBT. Finally,
as Hines Corporation is also an old and valued client, Schank
feels that it is twice as important to assign a project manager im-
mediately to Hines’s task as it is to provide one to General
Foundry, a brand-new client. Schank wants to minimize the to-
tal costs of all projects while considering each of these goals.
He feels that all of these goals are important, but if he had to
rank them, he would put his concern about NASA first, his
worry about Gardener second, his need to keep Hines Corpora-
tion happy third, his promise to Ruth fourth, and his concern
about minimizing all costs last.
Each project manager can handle, at most, one new client.
Discussion Questions
1. If Schank were not concerned about noncost goals, how
would he formulate this problem so that it could be solved
quantitatively?
2. Develop a formulation that will incorporate all five
objectives.

Case Study
Oakton River Bridge
The Oakton River had long been considered an impediment
to the development of a certain medium-sized metropolitan
area in the southeast. Lying to the east of the city, the river
made it difficult for people living on its eastern bank to com-
mute to jobs in and around the city and to take advantage of
the shopping and cultural attractions that the city had to offer.
Similarly, the river inhibited those on its western bank from
access to the ocean resorts lying one hour to the east. The
bridge over the Oakton River had been built prior to World
War II and was grossly inadequate to handle the existing traf-
fic, much less the increased  traffic that would accompany the
forecasted growth in the area. A congressional delegation
from the state prevailed upon the federal government to fund
a major portion of a new toll bridge over the Oakton River
and the state legislature appropriated the rest of the needed
monies for the project.
Progress in construction of the bridge has been in accor-
dance with what was anticipated at the start of construction.
The state highway commission, which will have operational
jurisdiction over the bridge, has concluded that the opening of
the bridge for traffic is likely to take place at the beginning of
the next summer, as scheduled. A personnel task force has
been established to recruit, train, and schedule the workers
needed to operate the toll facility.

426
CHAPTER 10 • INTEGER PROGRAMMING, GOAL PROGRAMMING, AND NONLINEAR PROGRAMMING
The personnel task force is well aware of the budgetary
problems facing the state. They have taken as part of their  man-
date the requirement that personnel costs be kept as low as pos-
sible. One particular area of concern is the number of toll
collectors that will be needed. The bridge is scheduling three
shifts of collectors: shift A from midnight to 8 A.M., shift B
from 8 A.M. to 4 P.M., and shift C from 4 P.M. to midnight.
Recently, the state employees union negotiated a contract with
the state which requires that all toll collectors be permanent,
full-time employees. In addition, all collectors must work a
five-on, two-off schedule on the same shift. Thus, for example,
a worker could be assigned to work Tuesday, Wednesday,
Thursday, Friday, and Saturday on shift A, followed by Sunday
and Monday off. An employee could not be scheduled to work,
say, Tuesday on shift A followed by Wednesday, Thursday, Fri-
day, and Saturday on shift B or on any other mixture of shifts
during a 5-day block. The employees would choose their as-
signments in order of their seniority.
The task force has received projections of traffic flow on
the bridge by day and hour. These projections are based on ex-
trapolations of existing traffic patterns—the pattern of commut-
ing, shopping, and beach traffic currently experienced with
growth projections factored in. Standards data from other state-
operated toll facilities have allowed the task force to convert
these traffic flows into toll collector requirements, that is, the
minimum number of collectors required per shift, per day, to
handle the anticipated traffic load. These toll collector require-
ments are summarized in the following table:
The numbers in the table include one or two extra collec-
tors per shift to fill in for collectors who call in sick and to pro-
vide relief for collectors on their scheduled breaks. Note that
each of the eight collectors needed for shift A on Sunday, for
example, could have come from any of the A shifts scheduled
to begin on Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, or Sunday.
Discussion Questions
1. Determine the minimum number of toll collectors that
would have to be hired to meet the requirements ex-
pressed in the table.
2. The union had indicated that it might lift its opposition to
the mixing of shifts in a 5-day block in exchange for addi-
tional compensation and benefits. By how much could the
number of toll collectors required be reduced if this is done?

CHAPTER 11 • NETWORK MODELS
11.1
Introduction
Networks are used to model a wide variety of problems. In Chapter 9, we saw the transporta-
tion, transshipment, and assignment problems modeled as networks. Linear programming was
used for solving them, and other techniques were presented as well. In this chapter, the follow-
ing network problems will be presented: the minimal-spanning tree problem, the maximal-flow
problem, and the shortest-route problem. Special techniques for solving these will be presented,
and when appropriate, a linear programming formulation will be provided. The minimal-
spanning tree technique determines the path through the network that connects all the points
while minimizing total distance. When the points represent houses in a subdivision, the minimal-
spanning tree technique can be used to determine the best way to connect all of the houses to
electrical power, water systems, and so on, in a way that minimizes the total distance or length
of power lines or water pipes. The maximal-flow technique finds the maximum flow of any
quantity or substance through a network. This technique can determine, for example, the maxi-
mum number of vehicles (cars, trucks, and so forth) that can go through a network of roads from
one location to another. Finally, the shortest-route technique can find the shortest path through a
network. For example, this technique can find the shortest route from one city to another through
a network of roads.
All of the examples used to describe the various network techniques in this chapter are
small and simple compared to real problems. This is done to make it easier for you to under-
stand the techniques. In many cases, these smaller network problems can be solved by inspec-
tion or intuition. For larger problems, however, finding a solution can be very difficult and
requires the use of these powerful network techniques. Larger problems may require hundreds,
or even thousands, of iterations. To computerize these techniques, it is necessary to use the sys-
tematic approach we present.
You will see several types of networks in this chapter. Although they represent many differ-
ent things, some terminology is common to all of them. The points on the network are referred
to as nodes. Typically these are presented as circles, although sometimes squares or rectangles
are used for the nodes. The lines connecting the nodes are called arcs.
Three network models are
covered in this chapter.
The circles in the networks are
called nodes. The lines
connecting them are called arcs.
11.2
Minimal-Spanning Tree Problem
The minimal-spanning tree technique involves connecting all the points of a network together
while minimizing the distance between them. It has been applied, for example, by telephone
companies to connect a number of phones together while minimizing the total length of tele-
phone cable.
Let us consider the Lauderdale Construction Company, which is currently developing a lux-
urious housing project in Panama City Beach, Florida. Melvin Lauderdale, owner and president
of Lauderdale Construction, must determine the least expensive way to provide water and power
to each house. The network of houses is shown in Figure 11.1.
As seen in Figure 11.1, there are eight houses on the gulf. The distance between each house
in hundreds of feet is shown on the network. The distance between houses 1 and 2, for example,
is 300 feet. (The number 3 is between nodes 1 and 2.) Now, the minimal-spanning tree technique
is used to determine the minimal distance that can be used to connect all of the nodes. The ap-
proach is outlined as follows:
Steps for the Minimal-Spanning Tree Technique
1. Select any node in the network.
2. Connect this node to the nearest node that minimizes the total distance.
3. Considering all of the nodes that are now connected, find and connect the nearest node that
is not connected. If there is a tie for the nearest node, select one arbitrarily. A tie suggests
there may be more than one optimal solution.
4. Repeat the third step until all nodes are connected.
This minimal-spanning tree
technique connects nodes at a
minimum distance.
There are four steps for the
minimal-spanning tree problem.

FIGURE 11.1
Network for Lauderdale
Construction
Now, we solve the network in Figure 11.1 for Melvin Lauderdale. We start by arbitrarily
selecting node 1. Since the nearest node is the third node at a distance of 2 (200 feet), we con-
nect node 1 to node 3. This is shown in Figure 11.2.
Considering nodes 1 and 3, we look for the next-nearest node. This is node 4, which is the
closest to node 3. The distance is 2 (200 feet). Again, we connect these nodes (see Figure 11.3,
part (a)).
We continue, looking for the nearest unconnected node to nodes 1, 3, and 4. This is node 2
or node 6, both at a distance of 3 from node 3. We will pick node 2 and connect it to node 3 (see
Figure 11.3, part (b)).
We continue the process. There is another tie for the next iteration with a minimum distance
of 3 (node 2–node 5 and node 3–node 6). You should note that we do not consider node 1–node
2 with a distance of 3 because both nodes 1 and 2 are already connected. We arbitrarily select

node 5 and connect it to node 2 (see Figure 11.4, part (a)). The next nearest node is node 6, and
we connect it to node 3 (see Figure 11.4, part (b)).
At this stage, we have only two unconnected nodes left. Node 8 is the nearest to node 6,
with a distance of 1 and we connect it (see Figure 11.5, part (a)). Then the remaining node 7 is
connected to node 8 (see Figure 11.5, part (b)).
The final solution can be seen in the seventh and final iteration (see Figure 11.5, part (b)).
Nodes 1, 2, 4, and 6 are all connected to node 3. Node 2 is connected to node 5. Node 6 is con-
nected to node 8, and node 8 is connected to node 7. All of the nodes are now connected. The
total distance is found by adding the distances for the arcs used in the spanning tree. In this ex-
ample, the distance is 
(or 1,600 feet). This is summarized
in Table 11.1.
This minimal-spanning tree problem can be solved using QM for Windows. Select Networks
for the Module drop-down menu. Then click File—New and select Minimal Spanning Tree as
the type of network. In the screen that appears, enter the number of arcs and click OK. The input
screen will allow you to enter the starting node, ending node, and cost (distance) for each arc.
These are reproduced in the output screen shown in Program 11.1. Notice that multiple optimal
solutions exist, as stated in the output.

Maximal-Flow Problem
The maximal-flow problem involves determining the maximum amount of material that can
flow from one point (the source) to another (the sink) in a network. Examples of this type of
problem include determining the maximum number of cars that can flow through a highway sys-
tem, the maximum amount of a liquid that can flow through a series of pipes, and the maximum
amount of data that can flow through a computer network.
To find the maximal flow from the source or start of a network to the sink or finish of that
network, two common methods are used: the maximal-flow technique and linear programming.
We will begin by presenting an example and demonstrating the first of these methods.
Maximal-Flow Technique
Waukesha, a small town in Wisconsin, is in the process of developing a road system for the
downtown area. Bill Blackstone, one of the city planners, would like to determine the maximum
number of cars that can flow through the town from west to east. The road network is shown in
Figure 11.6.
The maximal-flow technique
finds the most that can flow
through a network.

Spanning Tree Analysis of a 
Telecommunications Network
Network models have been used to solve a variety of problems
for many different companies. In telecommunications, there is al-
ways a need to connect computer systems and devices together
in an efficient and effective manner. Digital Equipment Corpora-
tion (DEC) for example, was concerned about how computer sys-
tems and devices were connected to a local area network (LAN)
using a technology called Ethernet. The DECnet routing depart-
ment was responsible for this and other network and telecommu-
nications solutions.
Because of a number of technical difficulties, it was important
to have an effective way to transport packets of information
throughout the LAN. The solution was to use a spanning tree
algorithm. The success of this approach can be seen in a poem
written by one of the developers:
“I think I shall never see a graph more lovely than a tree.
A tree whose critical property is loop-free connectivity.
A tree that must be sure to span, so packets can reach every
LAN.
First the route must be selected, by ID it is elected.
Least-cost paths from the root are traced.
In the tree these paths are placed.
A mesh is made for folks by me, then bridges find a spanning
tree.”

cations (October 21, 1997): 68–70.

the maximum flow from node 2 to nodes 1, 4, and 6, respectively. As you can see, the maximum
flow from node 2 back to node 1 is 100 cars per hour (1). One hundred cars per hour (1) can flow
from node 2 to node 4, and 200 cars (2) can flow to node 6. Note that traffic can flow in both di-
rections down a street. A zero (0) means no flow or a one-way street.
The maximal-flow technique is not difficult. It involves the following steps:
Four Steps of the Maximal-Flow Technique
1. Pick any path from the start (source) to the finish (sink) with some flow. If no path with
flow exists, then the optimal solution has been found.
2. Find the arc on this path with the smallest flow capacity available. Call this capacity C.
This represents the maximum additional capacity that can be allocated to this route.
3. For each node on this path, decrease the flow capacity in the direction of flow by the
amount C. For each node on this path, increase the flow capacity in the reverse direction by
the amount C.
4. Repeat these steps until an increase in flow is no longer possible.
Traffic can flow in both
directions.
We start by arbitrarily picking the path 1–2–6, which is at the top of the network. What is
the maximum flow from west to east? It is 2 because only 2 units (200 cars) can flow from node
2 to node 6. Now we adjust the flow capacities (see Figure 11.7). As you can see, we subtracted
the maximum flow of 2 along the path 1–2–6 in the direction of the flow (west to east) and
added 2 to the path in the direction against the flow (east to west). The result is the new path in
Figure 11.7.
It is important to note that the new path in Figure 11.7 reflects the new relative capacity at
this stage. The flow number by any node represents two factors. One factor is the flow that can
come from that node. The second factor is flow that can be reduced coming into the node. First
consider the flow from west to east. Look at the path that goes from node 1 to node 2. The num-
ber 1 by node 1 tells us that 100 cars can flow from node 1 to node 2. Looking at the path from
node 2 to node 6, we can see that the number 0 by node 2 tells us that 0 cars can flow from node
2 to node 6. Now consider the flow from east to west shown in the new path in Figure 11.7. First,
consider the path from node 6 to node 2. The number 4 by node 6 tells us the total by which we
can either reduce the flow from node 2 to node 6 or increase the flow from node 6 to node 2 (or
some combination of these flows into and out of node 6), depending on the current status of the
flows. Since we have indicated that there would currently only be 2 units (200 cars) flowing
The four maximal-flow 
technique steps.
We start by arbitrarily picking a
path and adjusting the flow.

Traffic-Control System on the Hanshin
Expressway
The Hanshin expressway started with a 2.3-kilometer section of
road in Osaka City, Japan, in the 1960s. This small stretch of high-
way was the first urban toll expressway in Osaka City. The traffic
flow was approximately 5,000 cars per day. Today, the expressway
includes about 200 kilometers of roadway in a system that con-
nects Osaka and Kobe, Japan. The traffic flow in the early 1990s
was more than 800,000 vehicles per day, with peak traffic flows
that exceeded 1 million cars per day.
As discussed in this chapter, maximizing the flow of traffic
through a network involves an investigation of current and future
capacity of the various branches in the network. In addition to ca-
pacity analysis, Hanshin decided to use an automated traffic control
system to maximize the flow of traffic through the existing express-
way and to reduce congestion and bottlenecks caused by accidents,
and by road maintenance or disabled cars. It was hoped that the
control system would also increase income from the expressway.
Hanshin’s management investigated the number of accidents
and breakdowns on the expressway to help reduce problems and
further increase traffic flow. The traffic control system provides
both direct and indirect control. Direct control includes control-
ling the number of vehicles entering the expressway at the
various on-ramps. Indirect control involves providing comprehen-
sive and up-to-the-minute information concerning traffic flows
and the general traffic conditions on the expressway. Information
on general traffic conditions is obtained using vehicle detectors,
TV cameras, ultrasonic detectors, and automatic vehicle identi-
fiers that read information on license plates. The data gath-
ered from these devices gives people at home and driving the
information they need to determine if they will use the Hanshin
expressway.
This application reveals that a solution to a problem
involves a variety of components, including quantitative analy-
sis, equipment, and other elements, such as providing informa-
tion to riders.

from node 2 to node 6, the maximum we could reduce this is 2, leaving us with the capacity to
also allow a flow of 2 units from node 6 to node 2 (giving us a total change of 4 units). Looking
at the path from node 2 to node 1, we see the number 3 by node 2. This tells us that the total pos-
sible change in that direction is 3, and this could come from reducing flows from node 1 to node
2 or increasing flows from node 2 to node 1. Since the flow from node 1 to node 2 is currently 2,
we could reduce this by 2, leaving us with the capacity to also allow a flow of 1 unit from node

2 to node 1 (giving us a total change of 3 units). At this stage, we have a flow of 200 cars
through the network from node 1 to node 2 to node 6. We have also reflected the new relative
capacity, as shown in Figure 11.7.
Now we repeat the process by picking another path with existing capacity. We will arbi-
trarily pick path 1–2–4–6. The maximum capacity along this path is 1. In fact, the capacity
at every node along this path (1–2–4–6) going from west to east is 1. Remember, the capac-
ity of branch 1–2 is now 1 because 2 units (200 cars per hour) are now flowing through the
network. Thus, we increase the flow along path 1–2–4–6 by 1 and adjust the capacity flow
(see Figure 11.8).
Now we have a flow of 3 units (300 cars): 200 cars per hour along path 1–2–6 plus 100
cars per hour along path 1–2–4–6. Can we still increase the flow? Yes, along path 1–3–5–6.
This is the bottom path. We consider the maximum capacity for each node along this route. The
capacity from node 1 to node 3 is 10 units; the capacity from node 3 to node 5 is 2 units; and
the capacity from node 5 to node 6 is 6 units. We are limited by the lowest of these, which is
the 2 units of flow from node 3 to node 5. The 2-unit increase in flow along this path is shown
in Figure 11.9.
Again we repeat the process, trying to find a path with any unused capacity through the
network. If you carefully check the last iteration in Figure 11.9, you will see that there are no
more paths from node 1 to node 6 with unused capacity, even though several other branches

This maximal-flow problem can be solved using QM for Windows. Select Networks from
the Module drop-down menu. Then click File—New and select Maximal Flow as the type of net-
work. In the screen that appears, enter the number of arcs and click OK. The input screen will
allow you to enter the starting node, ending node, and the capacity in each direction for each arc.
When the problem is solved, one additional column labeled Flow is added to the table, and this
column contains the optimal solution, as shown in Program 11.2.
Linear Program for Maximal Flow
The maximal-flow problem can be modeled as a linear program. This type of problem may be
viewed as a special type of transshipment problem with one source, one destination, and a num-
ber of transshipment points. The number shipped through the network would be called the flow.
The objective is to maximize the flow through the network. There are two types of con-
straints. The first set of constraints restricts the amount of flow on any arc to the capacity of that
arc. The second set of constraints indicates that the amount of flow out of a node will equal the
amount of flow into that node. These are the same as the transshipment constraints in the trans-
shipment problem.

Shortest-Route Problem
The objective of the shortest-route problem is to find the shortest distance from one location to
another. In a network, this often involves determining the shortest route from one node to each
of the other nodes. This problem can be solved either by the shortest-route technique or by mod-
eling this as a linear program with 0–1 variables. We will present an example and demonstrate
the shortest-route technique first, and then a linear program will be developed.
Shortest-Route Technique
Every day, Ray Design, Inc., must transport beds, chairs, and other furniture items  from the fac-
tory to the warehouse. This involves going through several cities. Ray would like to find the
route with the shortest distance. The road network is shown in Figure 11.10.
The shortest-route technique
minimizes the distance through a
network.
The last six constraints are restricting the flow out of a node to equal the flow into a node. The
problem is now ready to solve using the linear programming module in QM for Windows or us-
ing Solver in Excel.

Improving Pupil Transportation
In the early 1990s, North Carolina was spending almost $150
million on transporting students to schools. The state’s student
transportation system involved some 13,000 buses, 100 school
districts, and 700,000 students. In 1989, the General Assembly of
the state decided to investigate ways that could be used to save
money by developing a better way of transporting students. The
General Assembly was committed to funding school districts that
transported students efficiently, while only reimbursing justifiable
expenses for those districts that were not efficient in terms of
how they transported students to and from public schools.
The input data to North Carolina’s network model included
the number of buses used and the total operating expenses. Total
operating expenses included driver salaries, salaries to other
transportation personnel, payments to local governments, fuel
costs, parts and repair costs, and other related costs. These input
values were used to compute an efficiency score for the various
districts. These efficiency scores were then used to help in allocat-
ing funds to the districts. Those districts with an efficiency score
of 0.9 or higher received full funding. Converting efficiency scores
to funding was originally received with skepticism. After several
years, however, more state officials realized the usefulness of the
approach. In 1994–1995, the efficiency-based funding approach
was used alone to determine funding.
The use of efficiency-based funding resulted in the elimina-
tion of hundreds of school buses, with savings over a three-year
period greater than $25 million.

IN ACTION
The shortest-route technique can be used to minimize total distance from any starting node
to a final node. The technique is summarized in the following steps:
Steps of the Shortest-Route Technique
1. Find the nearest node to the origin (plant). Put the distance in a box by the node.
2. Find the next-nearest node to the origin (plant), and put the distance in a box by the node.
In some cases, several paths will have to be checked to find the nearest node.
3. Repeat this process until you have gone through the entire network. The last distance at the
ending node will be the distance of the shortest route. You should note that the distance
placed in the box by each node is the shortest route to this node. These distances are used
as intermediate results in finding the next-nearest node.
Looking at Figure 11.10, we can see that the nearest node to the plant is node 2, with a distance
of 100 miles. Thus we will connect these two nodes. This first iteration is shown in Figure 11.11.
Now we look for the next-nearest node to the origin. We check nodes 3, 4, and 5. Node 3 is
the nearest, but there are two possible paths. Path 1–2–3 is nearest to the origin, with a total dis-
tance of 150 miles (see Figure 11.12).
We repeat the process. The next-nearest node is either node 4 or node 5. Node 4 is 200 miles
from node 2, and node 2 is 100 miles from node 1. Thus, node 4 is 300 miles from the origin.
There are two paths for node 5, 2–5 and 3–5, to the origin. Note that we don’t have to go all the
way back to the origin because we already know the shortest route from node 2 and node 3 to
the origin. The minimum distances are placed in boxes by these nodes. Path 2–5 is 100 miles,
We look for the nearest node
to the origin.

and node 2 is 100 miles from the origin. Thus, the total distance is 200 miles. In a similar fash-
ion, we can determine that the path from node 5 to the origin through node 3 is 190 (40 miles
between node 5 and 3 plus 150 miles from node 3 to the origin). Thus, we pick node 5 going
through node 3 to the origin (see Figure 11.13).
The next-nearest node will be either node 4 or node 6, as the last remaining nodes. Node 4
is 300 miles from the origin (
from node 4 to node 2 plus 100 from node 2 to the ori-
gin). Node 6 is 290 miles from the origin 
Node 6 has the minimum dis-
tance, and because it is the ending node, we are done (refer to Figure 11.14). The shortest route
is path 1–2–3–5–6, with a minimum distance of 290 miles. This problem can be solved in
QM for Windows. The input screen is shown in Program 11.3A. The solution is shown in
Program 11.3B. Additional information for the optimal solution is available by clicking Window
after the problem has been solved.
Linear Program for Shortest-Route Problem
The shortest-route problem may be viewed as a special type of transshipment problem with one
source having a supply of 1, one destination with a demand of 1, and a number of transshipment
points. This type of problem can be modeled as a linear program with 0–1 variables. These vari-

For the Ray Design, Inc., example, the objective is to minimize the total distance (cost)

Since the starting point is node 1, we will not include variables going from node 2 or 3 back to
node 1. Similarly, since node 6 is the final destination, we will not include any variable that
starts at node 6.
Xij = 1 if arc from node i to node j is selected and Xij = 0 otherwise

CHAPTER 11 • NETWORK MODELS
Defining the Problem
Serving over 80 million customers in the United States and requiring over 40 thousand miles of cable,
AT&T’s fiber-optic network is the largest in the industry. Handling about 80 billion calls each year, AT&T de-
fined maintaining network reliability, while maximizing network flow and minimizing network resources,
as one of its most important problems.
Developing a Model
AT&T developed several comprehensive models to analyze reliability issues. These models investigated two
important aspects of network reliability: (1) preventing failures, and (2) responding quickly when failures
occur. The models included real time network routing (RTNR), fast automatic restoration (FASTAR), and
synchronous optical network (SONET).
Acquiring Input Data
Over 10 months was spent on collecting data for the models. Because of the vast amount of data, AT&T
used data aggregation to reduce the size of the network problem to make the solution easier.
Developing a Solution
The solution used an optimization routine to find the best way to route voice and data traffic through the
network to minimize the number of message failures and network resources required. Because of the huge
amount of data and the large size of the problem, an optimization solution was generated for each set of
possible traffic demand and failure possibilities.
Testing the Solution
AT&T performed testing by comparing the solutions obtained by the new optimization approach to the
solutions obtained by older planning tools. Improvement expectations of 5% to 10% were established.
The company also used computer simulation to test the solution over varying conditions.
Analyizing the Results
To analyze the results, AT&T had to reverse the aggregation steps performed during data collection. Once
the disaggregation process was completed, AT&T was able to determine the best routing approach
through the vast network. The analysis of the results included an investigation of embedded capacity and
spare capacity provided by the solution.
Implementing the Results
When implemented, the new approach was able to reduce network resources by more than 30%, while
maintaining high network reliability. During the study, 99.98% of all calls were successfully completed on
the first attempt. The successful implementation also resulted in ideas for changes and improvements, in-
cluding a full optimization approach that could identify unused capacity and place it into operation.

Summary
We presented three important network problems—the minimal-
spanning tree, the maximal-flow, and the shortest-route prob-
lems. All these problems are represented as networks, and
specialized solution techniques were provided. The maximal-
flow problem and the shortest-route problem may be considered
special cases of the transshipment problem, and both of these
were modeled using linear programming with variables that
were integers or 0–1. These three network problems have a
wide variety of applications, and there are many other types of
network problems as well.

This is a typical minimum-spanning tree problem that can be solved by hand. We begin by selecting
node 1 and connecting it to the nearest node, which is node 3. Nodes 1 and 2 are the next to be con-
nected, followed by nodes 1 and 4. Now we connect node 4 to node 7 and node 7 to node 6. At this
point, the only remaining points to be connected are node 6 to node 8 and node 6 to node 5. The final
solution can be seen in Figure 11.16. Table 11.2 summarizes these steps.

Solution
Using the maximal-flow technique, we arbitrarily choose path 1–5–7, which has a maximum flow of 5.
The capacities are then adjusted, leaving the capacities from 1 to 5 at 0, and the capacity from 5 to 7 also
at 0. The next path arbitrarily selected is 1–2–4–7, and the maximum flow is 3. When capacities are ad-
justed, the capacity from 1 to 2 and the capacity from 4 to 7 are 1, and the capacity from 2 to 4 is 0. The
next path selected is 1–3–6–7, which has a maximum flow of 1, and the capacity from 3 to 6 is adjusted
to 0. The next path selected is 1–2–5–6–7, which has a maximum flow of 1. After this, there are no more
paths with any capacity. Arc 5–7 has capacity of 0. While arc 4–7 has a capacity of 1, both arc 2–4 and
arc 5–4 have a capacity of 0, so no more flow is available through node 4. Similarly, while arc 6–7 has a
capacity of 4 remaining, the capacity for arc 3–6 and the capacity for arc 5–6 are 0. Thus, the maximum
flow is

Solution
The problem can be solved using the shortest-route technique. The nearest node to the origin (node 1) is
node 2. Give this a distance of 8 and put this in a box next to node 2. Next, consider nodes 3, 4, and 5
since there is an arc to each of these from either node 1 or node 2, and both of these have their distances
established. The nearest node to the origin is 3, so the distance to put in the box next to node 3 is
Then consider nodes 4, 5, and 6. The node nearest the origin is node 4, which has a dis-
tance of 18 (directly from node 1). Then consider nodes 5 and 6. The node with the least distance from
the origin is node 5 (coming through node 2), and this distance is 22. Next, consider nodes 6 and 7, and
node 6 is selected since the distance is 26 (coming through node 3). Finally, node 7 is considered, and
the shortest distance from the origin is 32 (coming through node 6). The route that gives the shortest
distance is 1–2–3–6–7, and the distance is 32. See Figure 11.20 for the solution.

11-12 Because of a sluggish economy, Bechtold Construc-

11-13 Due to increased property taxes and an aggressive road
development plan, the city of New Berlin has been
able to increase the road capacity of two of its roads

node 1–node 4 has been increased from 1 to 3. What
impact do these changes have on the number of cars

conduit that is continually air purged. This conduit
is very expensive but large enough to handle five

CHAPTER 11 • NETWORK MODELS
11-36 Northwest University is in the process of completing
a computer bus network that will connect computer
facilities throughout the university. The prime objec-
tive is to string a main cable from one end of the
campus to the other (nodes 1–25) through under-
ground conduits. These conduits are shown in the
network of Figure 11.32; the distance between them
is in hundreds of feet. Fortunately, these under-
ground conduits have remaining capacity through
which the bus cable can be placed.
(a) Given the network for this problem, how far (in
hundreds of feet) is the shortest route from node
1 to node 25?
(b) In addition to the computer bus network, a new
phone system is also being planned. The phone
system would use the same underground conduits.
If the phone system were installed, the following
paths along the conduit would be at capacity and
would not be available for the computer bus net-
work: 6–11, 7–12, and 17–20. What changes (if
any) would you have to make to the path used
for the computer bus if the phone system were
installed?
(c) The university did decide to install the new
phone system before the cable for the computer
network. Because of unexpected demand for
computer networking facilities, an additional ca-
ble is needed for node 1 to node 25. Unfortu-
nately, the cable for the first or original network
has completely used up the capacity along its
path. Given this situation, what is the best path
for the second network cable?

Case Study
Binder’s Beverage
Bill Binder’s business nearly went under when Colorado al-
most passed the bottle bill. Binder’s Beverage produced soft
drinks for many of the large grocery stores in the area. After
the bottle bill failed, Binder’s Beverage flourished. In a few
short years, the company had a major plant in Denver with a
warehouse in east Denver. The problem was getting the fin-
ished product to the warehouse. Although Bill was not good
with distances, he was good with times. Denver is a big city
with numerous roads that could be taken from the plant to the
warehouse, as shown in Figure 11.33.
The soft drink plant is located at the corner of North Street
and Columbine Street. High Street also intersects North and
Columbine Street at the plant. Twenty minutes due north of the
plant on North Street is I-70, the major east–west highway in
Denver.
North Street intersects I-70 at Exit 135. It takes five minutes
driving east on I-70 to reach Exit 136. This exit connects I-70
with High Street and 6th Avenue. Ten minutes east on I-70 is Exit
137. This exit connects I-70 with Rose Street and South Avenue.
From the plant, it takes 20 minutes on High Street, which
goes in a northeast direction, to reach West Street. It takes an-
other 20 minutes on High Street to reach I-70 and Exit 136.
It takes 30 minutes on Columbine Street to reach West
Street from the plant. Columbine Street travels east and slightly
north.
West Street travels east and west. From High Street, it takes
15 minutes to get to 6th Avenue on West Street. Columbine
Street also comes into this intersection. From this intersection,
it takes an additional 20 minutes on West Street to get to Rose
Street, and another 15 minutes to get to South Avenue.
From Exit 136 on 6th Avenue, it takes 5 minutes to get to
West Street. Sixth Avenue continues to Rose Street, requiring
25 minutes. Sixth Avenue then goes directly to the warehouse.
From Rose Street, it takes 40 minutes to get to the warehouse
on 6th Avenue.
At Exit 137, Rose Street travels southwest. It takes 20 min-
utes to intersect with West Street, and another 20 minutes to get
to 6th Avenue. From Exit 137, South Avenue goes due south. It
takes 10 minutes to get to West Street and another 15 minutes
to get to the Warehouse.

Southwestern University Traffic Problems
Southwestern University (SWU), located in the small town of
Stephenville, Texas, is experiencing increased interest in its
football program now that a big-name coach has been hired.
The increase in season ticket sales for the upcoming season
means additional revenues, but it also means increased com-
plaints due to the traffic problems associated with the football
games. When a new stadium is built, this will only get worse.
Marty Starr, SWU’s president, has asked the University Plan-
ning Committee to look into this problem.
Based on traffic projections, Dr. Starr would like to have
sufficient capacity so that 35,000 cars per hour could travel
from the stadium to the interstate highway. To alleviate the an-
ticipated traffic problems, some of the current streets leading
from the university to the interstate highway are being consid-
ered for widening to increase the capacity. The current street ca-
pacities with the number of cars (in 1,000s) per hour are shown
in Figure 11.34. Since the major problem will be after the game,
only the flows away from the stadium are indicated. These
flows include some streets closest to the stadium being trans-
formed into one-way streets for a short period after each game
with police officers directing traffic.
Alexander Lee, a member of the University Planning Com-
mittee, has said that a quick check of the road capacities in the
diagram in Figure 11.34 indicates that the total number of cars
per hour that may leave the stadium (node 1) is 33,000. The
number of cars that may pass through nodes 2, 3, and 4 is
35,000 per hour, and the number of cars that may pass through
nodes 5, 6, and 7 is even greater. Therefore, Dr. Lee has sug-
gested that the current capacity is 33,000 cars per hour. He has
also suggested that a recommendation be made to the city man-
ager for expansion of one of the routes from the stadium to the
highway to permit an additional 2,000 cars per hour. He recom-
mends expanding whichever route is cheapest. If the city
chooses not to expand the roads, it is felt that the traffic prob-
lem would be a nuisance but would be manageable.
Based on past experience, it is believed that as long as the
street capacity is within 2,500 cars per hour of the number that
leave the stadium, the problem is not too severe. However, the
severity of the problem grows dramatically for each additional
1,000 cars that are added to the streets.
Discussion Questions
1. If there is no expansion, what is the maximum number of
cars that may actually travel from the stadium to the inter-
state per hour? Why is this number not equal to 33,000, as
Dr. Lee suggested?
2. If the cost for expanding a street were the same for each
street, which street(s) would you recommend expanding
to increase the capacity to 33,000? Which streets would
you recommend expanding to get the total capacity of the
system to 35,000 per hour?

CHAPTER 12 • PROJECT MANAGEMENT
12.1
Introduction
Most realistic projects that organizations like Microsoft, General Motors, or the U.S. Defense
Department undertake are large and complex. A builder putting up an office building, for exam-
ple, must complete thousands of activities costing millions of dollars. NASA must inspect
countless components before it launches a rocket. Avondale Shipyards in New Orleans requires
tens of thousands of steps in constructing an ocean-going tugboat. Almost every industry wor-
ries about how to manage similar large-scale, complicated projects effectively. It is a difficult
problem, and the stakes are high. Millions of dollars in cost overruns have been wasted due to
poor planning of projects. Unnecessary delays have occurred due to poor scheduling. How can
such problems be solved?
The first step in planning and scheduling a project is to develop the work breakdown struc-
ture. This involves identifying the activities that must be performed in the project. An activity is
a job or task that is a part of a project.  The beginning or end of an activity is called an event.
There may be varying levels of detail, and each activity may be broken into its most basic com-
ponents. The time, cost, resource requirements, predecessors, and person(s) responsible are iden-
tified for each activity. When this has been done, a schedule for the project can be developed.
The program evaluation and review technique (PERT) and the critical path method
(CPM) are two popular quantitative analysis techniques that help managers plan, schedule,
monitor, and control large and complex projects. They were developed because there was a crit-
ical need for a better way to manage (see the History box).
When they were first developed, PERT and CPM were similar in their basic approach, but
they differed in the way activity times were estimated. For every PERT activity, three time esti-
mates are combined to determine the expected activity completion time. Thus, PERT is a proba-
bilistic technique. On the other hand, CPM is a deterministic method since it is assumed that the
times are known with certainty. While these differences are still noted, the two techniques are so
similar that the term PERT/CPM is often used to describe the overall approach. This reference is
used in this chapter, and differences are noted where appropriate.
There are six steps common to both PERT and CPM. The procedure follows:
Six Steps of PERT/CPM
1. Define the project and all of its significant activities or tasks.
2. Develop the relationships among the activities. Decide which activities must precede
others.
3. Draw the network connecting all of the activities.
4. Assign time and/or cost estimates to each activity.
5. Compute the longest time path through the network; this is called the critical path.
6. Use the network to help plan, schedule, monitor, and control the project.
Finding the critical path is a major part of controlling a project. The activities on the critical
path represent tasks that will delay the entire project if they are delayed. Managers derive flexi-
bility by identifying noncritical activities and replanning, rescheduling, and reallocating
resources such as personnel and finances.
Project management can be used
to manage complex projects.
PERT is probabilistic, whereas
CPM is deterministic.
The critical path is important
because activities on the critical
path can delay the entire project.
12.2
PERT/CPM
Almost any large project can be subdivided into a series of smaller activities or tasks that can be
analyzed with PERT/CPM. When you recognize that projects can have thousands of specific
activities, you see why it is important to be able to answer questions such as the following:
1. When will the entire project be completed?
2. What are the critical activities or tasks in the project, that is, the ones that will delay the
entire project if they are late?
Questions answered by PERT.

12.2
PERT/CPM
461
Managers have been planning, scheduling, monitoring, and
controlling large-scale projects for hundreds of years, but it has
only been in the past 50 years that QA techniques have been
applied to major projects. One of the earliest techniques was the
Gantt chart. This type of chart shows the start and finish times
of one or more activities, as shown in the accompanying chart.
In 1958, the Special Projects Office of the U.S. Navy devel-
oped the program evaluation and review technique (PERT) to plan
HISTORY
How PERT and CPM Started
3. Which are the noncritical activities, that is, the ones that can run late without delaying the
entire project’s completion?
4. If there are three time estimates, what is the probability that the project will be completed
by a specific date?
5. At any particular date, is the project on schedule, behind schedule, or ahead of schedule?
6. On any given date, is the money spent equal to, less than, or greater than the budgeted
amount?
7. Are there enough resources available to finish the project on time?
General Foundry Example of PERT/CPM
General Foundry, Inc., a metalworks plant in Milwaukee, has long been trying to avoid the
expense of installing air pollution control equipment. The local environmental protection group
has recently given the foundry 16 weeks to install a complex air filter system on its main smoke-
stack. General Foundry was warned that it will be forced to close unless the device is installed
in the allotted period. Lester Harky, the managing partner, wants to make sure that installation
of the filtering system progresses smoothly and on time.
When the project begins, the building of the internal components for the device (activity A)
and the modifications that are necessary for the floor and roof (activity B) can be started. The
construction of the collection stack (activity C) can begin once the internal components are com-
pleted, and pouring of the new concrete floor and installation of the frame (activity D) can be
completed as soon as the roof and floor have been modified. After the collection stack has been
constructed, the high-temperature burner can be built (activity E), and the installation of the pol-
lution control system (activity F) can begin. The air pollution device can be installed (activity G)
after the high-temperature burner has been built, the concrete floor has been poured, and the
The first step is to define the
project and all project activities.

and control the Polaris missile program. This project involved the
coordination of thousands of contractors. Today PERT is still used
to monitor countless government contract schedules. At about
the same time (1957), the critical path method (CPM) was devel-
oped by J. E. Kelly of Remington Rand and M. R. Walker of du
Pont. Originally, CPM was used to assist in the building and
maintenance of chemical plants at du Pont.

frame has been installed. Finally, after the control system and pollution device have been
installed, the system can be inspected and tested (activity H).
All of these activities seem rather confusing and complex until they are placed in a network.
First, all of the activities must be listed. This information is shown in Table 12.1. We see in the
table that before the collection stack can be constructed (activity C), the internal components
must be built (activity A). Thus, activity A is the immediate predecessor of activity C. Similarly,
both activities D and E must be performed just prior to installation of the air pollution device
(activity G).
Drawing the PERT/CPM Network
Once the activities have all been specified (step 1 of the PERT procedure) and management has
decided which activities must precede others (step 2), the network can be drawn (step 3).
There are two common techniques for drawing PERT networks. The first is called activity-
on-node (AON) because the nodes represent the activities. The second is called activity-on-arc
Defining the Problem
British Airways (BA) wanted to rejuvenate its image using international design consultants to help develop a
new identity. The “makeover” was to be completed in all areas of BA’s public image as quickly as possible.
Developing a Model
Using a computerized project management package—PERTMASTER from Abex Software—a BA team con-
structed a PERT model of all tasks involved.
Acquiring Input Data
Data were collected from each department involved. Printers were asked to develop time estimates 
for new company stationery, tickets, timetables, and baggage tags; clothing suppliers for uniforms; and
Boeing Corp. for all the tasks involved in remaking the inside and outside of BA’s jets.
Developing a Solution
All the data were entered into PERTMASTER for a schedule and critical path.
Testing the Solution
The resulting schedule did not please BA management. Boeing could not prepare a huge 747 in time for a
December 4 gala launch date. Uniform designs were also going to delay the entire project.
Analyzing the Results
An analysis of the earliest possible date that all items for a refurbished airplane could be ready (new paint,
upholstery, carpets, trim, and so on) revealed that there were just sufficient materials to totally convert a
smaller Boeing 737 that was available in the Seattle plant. Critical path analysis also showed that uni-
forms—the work of British designer Roland Klein—would have to be launched six months later in a sepa-
rate ceremony.
Implementing the Results
The smaller 737 was outfitted just in time for a brilliant light show in an auditorium specially built in a
Heathrow Airport hangar. Ground vehicles were also prepared in time.

(AOA) because the arcs are used to represent the activities. In this book, we present the AON
technique, as this is easier and is often used in commercial software.
In constructing an AON network, there should be one node representing the start of the
project and one node representing the finish of the project. There will be one node (repre-
sented as a rectangle in this chapter) for each activity. Figure 12.1 gives the entire network for
General Foundry. The arcs (arrows) are used to show the predecessors for the activities. For
example, the arrows leading into activity G indicate that both D and E are immediate prede-
cessors for G.
Activity Times
The next step in both CPM and PERT is to assign estimates of the time required to complete
each activity. For some projects, such as construction projects, the time to complete each
activity may be known with certainty. The developers of CPM assigned just one time estimate
to each activity. These times are then used to find the critical path, as described in the sections
that follow.
However, for one-of-a-kind projects or for new jobs, providing activity time estimates is not
always an easy task. Without solid historical data, managers are often uncertain about the activity
times. For this reason, the developers of PERT employed a probability distribution based on three
time estimates for each activity. A weighted average of these times is used with PERT in place of

the single time estimate used with CPM, and these averages are used to find the critical path. The
time estimates in PERT are
Optimistic time (a)
time an activity will take if everything goes as well as possible. 
There should be only a small probability (say, 
) of this
occurring.
Pessimistic time (b)
time an activity would take assuming very unfavorable 
conditions. There should also be only a small probability that 
the activity will really take this long.
Most likely time (m)
most realistic time estimate to complete the activity.
PERT often assumes that time estimates follow the beta probability distribution (see Figure 12.2).
This continuous distribution has been found to be appropriate, in many cases, for determining an
expected value and variance for activity completion times.
To find the expected activity time (t), the beta distribution weights the estimates as follows:
(12-1)
To compute the dispersion or variance of activity completion time, we use this formula:*
(12-2)
Table 12.2 shows General Foundry’s optimistic, most likely, and pessimistic time estimates
for each activity. It also reveals the expected time (t) and variance for each of the activities, as
computed with Equations 12-1 and 12-2.
How to Find the Critical Path
Once the expected completion time for each activity has been determined, we accept it as the
actual time of that task. Variability in times will be considered later.
Although Table 12.2 indicates that the total expected time for all eight of General Foundry’s
activities is 25 weeks, it is obvious in Figure 12.3 that several of the tasks can be taking place
simultaneously. To find out just how long the project will take, we perform the critical path
analysis for the network.

The critical path is the longest time path route through the network. If Lester Harky wants
to reduce the total project time for General Foundry, he will have to reduce the length of some
activity on the critical path. Conversely, any delay of an activity on the critical path will delay
completion of the entire project.

CHAPTER 12 • PROJECT MANAGEMENT
To find the critical path, we need to determine the following quantities for each activity in
the network:
1. Earliest start time (ES): the earliest time an activity can begin without violation of imme-
diate predecessor requirements
2. Earliest finish time (EF): the earliest time at which an activity can end
3. Latest start time (LS): the latest time an activity can begin without delaying the entire
project
4. Latest finish time (LF): the latest time an activity can end without delaying the entire
project
In the network, we represent these times as well as the activity times (t) in the nodes, as seen
here:
The ES is the largest EF of the
immediate predecessors.
The earliest times are found by
beginning at the start of the
project and making a forward
pass through the network.
A
ES = 0
EF = 0 + 2 = 2
 t = 2
B
ES = 0
EF = 0 + 3 = 3
t = 3
Start
We first show how to determine the earliest times. When we find these, the latest times can be
computed.
EARLIEST TIMES There are two basic rules to follow when computing ES and EF times. The first
rule is for the earliest finish time, which is computed as follows:
(12-3)
Also, before any activity can be started, all of its predecessor activities must be completed. In
other words, we search for the largest EF for all of the immediate predecessors in determining
ES. The second rule is for the earliest start time, which is computed as follows:
Largest of the earliest finish times of immediate predecessors
Largest EF of immediate predecessors
The start of the whole project will be set at time zero. Therefore, any activity that has no prede-
cessors will have an earliest start time of zero. So 
for both A and B in the General
Foundry problem, as seen here:
ES = 0
 ES =
 Earliest start =
 EF = ES + t
 Earliest finish time = Earliest start time + Expected activity time

The rest of the earliest times for General Foundry are shown in Figure 12.4. These are found
using a forward pass through the network. At each step, 
and ES is the largest
EF of the predecessors. Notice that activity G has an earliest start time of 8, since both D
(with 
) and E (with 
) are immediate predecessors. Activity G cannot start
until both predecessors are finished, and so we choose the larger of the earliest finish times
for these. Thus, G has 
. The finish time for the project will be 15 weeks, which is the
EF for activity H.

LATEST TIMES The next step in finding the critical path is to compute the latest start time (LS)
and the latest finish time (LF) for each activity. We do this by making a backward pass through
the network, that is, starting at the finish and working backward.
There are two basic rules to follow when computing the latest times. The first rule involves
the latest start time, which is computed as
(12-4)
Also, since all immediate predecessors must be finished before an activity can begin, the latest
start time for an activity determines the latest finish time for its immediate predecessors. If an
activity is the immediate predecessor for two or more activities, it must be finished so that all
following activities can begin by their latest start times. Thus, the second rule involves the latest
finish time, which is computed as
To compute the latest times, we start at the finish and work backwards. Since the finish time for
the General Foundry project is 15, activity H has 
The latest start for activity H is
Continuing to work backward, this latest start time of 13 becomes the latest finish time for
immediate predecessors F and G. All of the latest times are shown in Figure 12.5. Notice that
for activity C, which is the immediate predecessor for two activities (E and F), the latest finish
time is the smaller of the latest start times (4 and 10) for activities E and F.
CONCEPT OF SLACK IN CRITICAL PATH COMPUTATIONS When ES, LS, EF, and LF have been
determined, it is a simple matter to find the amount of slack time, or free time, that each activity
has. Slack is the length of time an activity can be delayed without delaying the whole project.
Mathematically,
(12-5)
Table 12.3 summarizes the ES, EF, LS, LF, and slack times for all of General Foundry’s activities.
Activity B, for example, has 1 week of slack time since 
(or, similarly,
). This means that it can be delayed up to 1 week without causing the proj-
ect to run any longer than expected.
LF - EF = 4 - 3 = 1
LS - ES = 1 - 0 = 1
Slack = LS - ES, or Slack = LF - EF
LS = LF - t = 15 - 2 = 13 weeks
LF = 15.
 LF = Smallest LS of following activities
 Latest finish time = Smallest of latest start times for following activities, or
 LS = LF - t
 Latest start time = Latest finish time - Activity time
Slack time is free time for an
activity.

CHAPTER 12 • PROJECT MANAGEMENT
Delta’s Ground Crew Orchestrates 
a Smooth Takeoff
Flight 199’s three engines screech its arrival as the wide-bodied
jet lumbers down Orlando’s taxiway with 200 passengers arriving
from San Juan. In an hour, the plane is to be airborne again.
But before this jet can depart, there is business to attend to:
hundreds of passengers and tons of luggage and cargo to unload
and load; hundreds of meals, thousands of gallons of jet fuel,
countless soft drinks and bottles of liquor to restock; cabin and
restrooms to clean; toilet holding tanks to drain; and engines,
wings, and landing gear to inspect.
The 12-person ground crew knows that a miscue anywhere—
a broken cargo loader, lost baggage, misdirected passengers—
can mean a late departure and trigger a chain reaction of
headaches from Orlando to Dallas to every destination of a con-
necting flight.
Dennis Dettro, the operations manager for Delta’s Orlando In-
ternational Airport, likes to call the turnaround operation “a well-
orchestrated symphony.” Like a pit crew awaiting a race car,
trained crews are in place for Flight 199 with baggage carts and
tractors, hydraulic cargo loaders, a truck to load food and drinks,
another to lift the cleanup crew, another to put fuel on, and a
fourth to take water off. The “orchestra” usually performs so
smoothly that most passengers never suspect the proportions of
the effort. PERT and Gantt charts aid Delta and other airlines with
the staffing and scheduling that are necessary for this symphony
to perform.

FIGURE 12.6
General Foundry’s
Critical Path
(A–C–E–G–H)
Computing project variance is
done by summing activity
variances along the critical path.
On the other hand, activities A, C, E, G, and H have no slack time; this means that none of
them can be delayed without delaying the entire project. Because of this, they are called critical
activities and are said to be on the critical path. Lester Harky’s critical path is shown in network
form in Figure 12.6. The total project completion time (T), 15 weeks, is seen as the largest num-
ber in the EF or LF columns of Table 12.3. Industrial managers call this a boundary timetable.
Probability of Project Completion
The critical path analysis helped us determine that the foundry’s expected project completion
time is 15 weeks. Harky knows, however, that if the project is not completed in 16 weeks, Gen-
eral Foundry will be forced to close by environmental controllers. He is also aware that there is
significant variation in the time estimates for several activities. Variation in activities that are on
the critical path can affect overall project completion—possibly delaying it. This is one occur-
rence that worries Harky considerably.
PERT uses the variance of critical path activities to help determine the variance of the over-
all project. If the activity times are statistically independent, the project variance is computed by
summing the variances of the critical activities:
(12-6)
From Table 12.2 we know that
Project variance = avariances of activities on the critical path

Probability Distribution
for Project Completion
Times
We know that the standard deviation is just the square root of the variance, so
How can this information be used to help answer questions regarding the probability of finish-
ing the project on time? In addition to assuming that the activity times are independent, we also
assume that total project completion time follows a normal probability distribution. With these
assumptions, the bell-shaped curve shown in Figure 12.7 can be used to represent project com-
pletion dates. It also means that there is a 50% chance that the entire project will be completed
in less than the expected 15 weeks and a 50% chance that it will exceed 15 weeks.*
For Harky to find the probability that his project will be finished on or before the 16-week
deadline, he needs to determine the appropriate area under the normal curve. The standard nor-
mal equation can be applied as follows:
(12-7)
where
Z is the number of standard deviations the due date or target date lies from the mean or
expected date.
Referring to the normal table in Appendix A, we find a probability of 0.71566. Thus, there is a
71.6% chance that the pollution control equipment can be put in place in 16 weeks or less. This
is shown in Figure 12.8.

*You should be aware that noncritical activities also have variability (as shown in Table 12.2). In fact, a different critical
path can evolve because of the probabilistic situation. This may also cause the probability estimates to be unreliable. In
such instances, it is better to use simulation to determine the probabilities.

The sixth and final step is to
monitor and control the project
using the information provided
by PERT.
What PERT Was Able to Provide
PERT has thus far been able to provide Lester Harky with several valuable pieces of manage-
ment information:
1. The project’s expected completion date is 15 weeks.
2. There is a 71.6% chance that the equipment will be in place within the 16-week deadline.
PERT can easily find the probability of finishing by any date Harky is interested in.
3. Five activities (A, C, E, G, H) are on the critical path. If any one of them is delayed for any
reason, the entire project will be delayed.
4. Three activities (B, D, F) are not critical but have some slack time built in. This means
that Harky can borrow from their resources, if needed, possibly to speed up the entire
project.
5. A detailed schedule of activity starting and ending dates has been made available (see
Table 12.3).
Using Excel QM for the General Foundry Example
This example can be worked using Excel QM. To do this, select Excel QM from the Add-Ins
tab in Excel 2010, as shown in Program 12.1A. In the drop-down menu, put the cursor over
Project Management, and choices will appear to the right. To input a problem that is presented
in a table with the immediate predecessors and three time estimates, select Predecessor List
(AON), and the initialization window will appear. Specify the number of activities, the maxi-
mum number of immediate predecessors for the activities, and select the 3 Time Estimate
option. If you wish to see a Gantt chart, check Graph. Click OK when finished, and a spread-
sheet will appear, with all the necessary rows and columns labeled. For this example, enter the
three time estimates in cells B8:D15 and then enter the immediate predecessors in cells
C18:D25, as shown in Program 12.1B. No other inputs or steps are required.
As this data is being entered, Excel QM calculates the expected times and variances for all
activities, and a table will automatically display the earliest, latest, and slack times for all the
activities. A Gantt chart is displayed, and this chart shows the critical path and slack time for the
activities.
Sensitivity Analysis and Project Management
During any project, the time required to complete an activity can vary from the projected or
expected time. If the activity is on the critical path, the total project completion time will
change, as discussed previously. In addition to having an impact on the total project comple-
tion time, there is also an impact on the earliest start, earliest finish, latest start, latest finish,
and slack times for other activities. The exact impact depends on the relationship between the
various activities.
In previous sections we define an immediate predecessor activity as an activity that comes
immediately before a given activity. In general, a predecessor activity is one that must be com-
pleted before the given activity can be started. Consider activity G (install pollution device) for
the General Foundry example. As seen previously, this activity is on the critical path. Predecessor
activities are A, B, C, D, and E. All of these activities must be completed before activity G can be
started. A successor activity is an activity that can be started only after the given activity is fin-
ished. Activity H is the only successor activity for activity G. A parallel activity is an activity that
does not directly depend on the given activity. Again consider activity G. Are there any parallel
activities for this activity? Looking at the network for General Foundry, it can be seen that activ-
ity F is a parallel activity of activity G.
After predecessor, successor, and parallel activities have been defined, we can explore
the impact that an increase (decrease) in an activity time for a critical path activity would
have on other activities in the network. The results are summarized in Table 12.4. If the time
it takes to complete activity G increases, there will be an increase in the earliest start, earliest
finish, latest start, and latest finish times for all successor activities. Because these activities
follow activity G, these times will also increase. Because slack time is equal to latest finish
time minus the earliest finish time (or the latest start time minus earliest start time; LF - EF

472
CHAPTER 12 • PROJECT MANAGEMENT
or
), there will be no change in the slack for successor activities. Because activity G
is on the critical path, an increase in activity time will increase the total project competition
time. This would mean that the latest finish, latest start, and slack time will also increase for
all parallel activities. You can prove this to yourself by completing a backward pass through
the network using a higher total project competition time. There are no changes for prede-
cessor activities.

PERT/Cost
Although PERT is an excellent method of monitoring and controlling project length, it does not
consider another very important factor, project cost. PERT/Cost is a modification of PERT that
allows a manager to plan, schedule, monitor, and control cost as well as time.
We begin this section by investigating how costs can be planned and scheduled. Then we
see how costs can be monitored and controlled.
Planning and Scheduling Project Costs: Budgeting Process
The overall approach in the budgeting process of a project is to determine how much is to be
spent every week or month. This is accomplished as follows:
Four Steps of the Budgeting Process
1. Identify all costs associated with each of the activities. Then add these costs together to get
one estimated cost or budget for each activity.
2. If you are dealing with a large project, several activities can be combined into larger work
packages. A work package is simply a logical collection of activities. Since the General
Foundry project we have been discussing is small, one activity will be a work package.
Using PERT/Cost to plan,
schedule, monitor, and control
project cost helps accomplish the
sixth and final step of PERT.

A budget is computed using ES.
Costing Projects at Nortel
Many companies, including Nortel, a large telecommunications
company, are benefiting from project management. With more than
20,000 active projects worth a total of more than $2 billion, effec-
tively managing projects at Nortel has been challenging. Getting the
needed input data, including times and costs, can be difficult.
Like most companies, Nortel used standard accounting prac-
tices to monitor and control costs. This typically involves allocat-
ing costs to each department. Most projects, however, span
multiple departments. This can make it very difficult to get timely
cost information. Project managers often get project cost data
later than they want. Because the cost data are allocated to
departments, the data are often not detailed enough to help
manage projects and get an accurate picture of true project costs.
To get more accurate cost data for project management, Nor-
tel adopted an activity-based-costing (ABC) method often used in
manufacturing operations. In addition to standard cost data, each
project activity was coded with a project identification number
and a regional research and development location number. This
greatly improved the ability of project managers to control costs.
Because some of the month-end costing processes were simpli-
fied, the approach also lowered project costs in most cases. Pro-
ject managers also were able to get more detailed costing
information. Because the cost data were coded for each project,
getting timely feedback was also possible. In this case, getting
good input data reduced project costs, reduced the time needed
to get critical project feedback, and made project management
more accurate.

3. Convert the budgeted cost per activity into a cost per time period. To do this, we assume
that the cost of completing any activity is spent at a uniform rate over time. Thus, if the
budgeted cost for a given activity is $48,000 and the activity’s expected time is four weeks,
the budgeted cost per week is $12,000 
weeks .
4. Using the earliest and latest start times, find out how much money should be spent during
each week or month to finish the project by the date desired.
BUDGETING FOR GENERAL FOUNDRY Let us apply this budgeting process to the General Foundry
problem. The Gantt chart for this problem, shown in Figure 12.9, illustrates this process. In this
chart, a horizontal bar shows when each activity will be performed based on the earliest times. To
develop a budget schedule, we will determine how much will be spent on each activity during
each week and fill these amounts into the chart in place of the bars. Lester Harky has carefully
computed the costs associated with each of his eight activities. He has also divided the total
budget for each activity by the activity’s expected completion time to determine the weekly
budget for the activity. The budget for activity A, for example, is $22,000 (see Table 12.5). Since
its expected time (t) is 2 weeks, $11,000 is spent each week to complete the activity. Table 12.5
also provides two pieces of data we found earlier using PERT: the earliest start time (ES) and lat-
est start time (LS) for each activity.
Looking at the total of the budgeted activity costs, we see that the entire project will cost
$308,000. Finding the weekly budget will help Harky determine how the project is progressing
on a week-to-week basis.
The weekly budget for the project is developed from the data in Table 12.5. The earliest
start time for activity A, for example, is 0. Because A takes 2 weeks to complete, its weekly
budget of $11,000 should be spent in weeks 1 and 2. For activity B, the earliest start time is 0,
the expected completion time is 3 weeks, and the budgeted cost per week is $10,000. Thus,
$10,000 should be spent for activity B in each of weeks 1, 2, and 3. Using the earliest start time,
we can find the exact weeks during which the budget for each activity should be spent. These
weekly amounts can be summed for all activities to arrive at the weekly budget for the entire
project. This is shown in Table 12.6. Notice the similarities between this chart and the Gantt
chart shown in Figure 12.9.
Do you see how the weekly budget for the project (total per week) is determined in Table
12.6? The only two activities that can be performed during the first week are activities A and
2

B because their earliest start times are 0. Thus, during the first week, a total of $21,000
should be spent. Because activities A and B are still being performed in the second week, a
total of $21,000 should also be spent during that period. The earliest start time for activity C
is at the end of week 2  
for activity C . Thus, $13,000 is spent on activity C in both
weeks 3 and 4. Because activity B is also being performed during week 3, the total budget in
week 3 is $23,000. Similar computations are done for all activities to determine the total
budget for the entire project for each week. Then these weekly totals can be added to deter-
mine the total amount that should be spent to date (total to date). This information is dis-
played in the bottom row of the table.
Those activities along the critical path must spend their budgets at the times shown in
Table 12.6. The activities that are not on the critical path, however, can be started at a later
date. This concept is embodied in the latest starting time, LS, for each activity. Thus, if latest
starting times are used, another budget can be obtained. This budget will delay the expendi-
ture of funds until the last possible moment. The procedures for computing the budget when
LS is used are the same as when ES is used. The results of the new computations are shown
in Table 12.7.
Compare the budgets given in Tables 12.6 and 12.7. The amount that should be spent to
date (total to date) for the budget in Table 12.7 uses fewer financial resources in the first few
weeks. This is because this budget is prepared using the latest start times. Thus, the budget in

CHAPTER 12 • PROJECT MANAGEMENT
Table 12.7 shows the latest possible time that funds can be expended and still finish the proj-
ect on time. The budget in Table 12.6 reveals the earliest possible time that funds can be ex-
pended. Therefore, a manager can choose any budget that falls between the budgets presented
in these two tables. These two tables form feasible budget ranges. This concept is illustrated
in Figure 12.10.
The budget ranges for General Foundry were established by plotting the total-to-date
budgets for ES and LS. Lester Harky can use any budget between these feasible ranges and still
complete the air pollution project on time. Budgets like the ones shown in Figure 12.10 are nor-
mally developed before the project is started. Then, as the project is being completed, funds ex-
pended should be monitored and controlled.

Although there are cash flow and money management advantages to delaying activities un-
til their latest start times, such delays can create problems with finishing the project on sched-
ule. If an activity is not started until its latest start time, there is no slack remaining. Any
subsequent delays in this activity will delay the project. For this reason, it may not be desirable
to schedule all activities to start at the latest start time.
Monitoring and Controlling Project Costs
The purpose of monitoring and controlling project costs is to ensure that the project is progress-
ing on schedule and that cost overruns are kept to a minimum. The status of the entire project
should be checked periodically.
Lester Harky wants to know how his air pollution project is going. It is now the sixth week
of the 15-week project. Activities A, B, and C have been finished. These activities incurred costs
of $20,000, $36,000, and $26,000 respectively. Activity D is only 10% completed and so far the
cost expended has been $6,000. Activity E is 20% completed with an incurred cost of $20,000,
and activity F is 20% completed with an incurred cost of $4,000. Activities G and H have not
been started. Is the air pollution project on schedule? What is the value of work completed? Are
there any cost overruns?
Is the project on schedule and
within its budget?

478
CHAPTER 12 • PROJECT MANAGEMENT
The value of work completed, or the cost to date for any activity, can be computed as
follows:
(12-8)
The activity difference is also of interest:
(12-9)
If an activity difference is negative, there is a cost underrun, but if the number is positive, there
has been a cost overrun.
Table 12.8 provides this information for General Foundry. The second column contains the
total budgeted cost (from Table 12.6), and the third column contains the percent of completion.
With these data and the actual cost expended for each activity, we can compute the value of work
completed and the overruns or underruns for every activity.
One way to measure the value of the work completed is to multiply the total budgeted cost
times the percent of completion for every activity.* Activity D, for example, has a value of work
completed of $4,800 
times 10%
. To determine the amount of overrun or underrun
for any activity, the value of work completed is subtracted from the actual cost. These differ-
ences can be added to determine the overrun or underrun for the project. As you see, at week 6
there is a $12,000 cost overrun. Furthermore, the value of work completed is only $100,000, and
the actual cost of the project to date is $112,000. How do these costs compare with the budgeted
costs for week 6? If Harky had decided to use the budget for earliest start times (see Table 12.6)
we can see that $162,000 should have been spent. Thus, the project is behind schedule and there
are cost overruns. Harky needs to move faster on this project to finish on time, and he must con-
trol future costs carefully to try to eliminate the current cost overrun of $12,000. To monitor and
control costs, the budgeted amount, the value of work completed, and the actual costs should be
computed periodically.
In the next section we see how a project can be shortened by spending additional money.
The technique is called crashing and is part of the critical path method (CPM).

Project Management and Software
Development
Although computers have revolutionized how companies con-
duct business and allowed some organizations to achieve a long-
term competitive advantage in the marketplace, the software that
controls these computers is often more expensive than intended
and takes longer to develop than expected. In some cases, large
software projects are never fully completed. The London Stock
Exchange, for example, had an ambitious software project called
TAURUS that was intended to improve computer operations at
the exchange. The TAURUS project, which cost hundreds of mil-
lions of dollars, was never completed. After numerous delays and
cost overruns, the project was finally halted. The FLORIDA system,
an ambitious software development project for the Department
of Health and Rehabilitative Services (HRS) for the state of Florida,
was also delayed, cost more than expected, and didn’t operate as
everyone had hoped. Although not all software development
projects are delayed or over budget, it has been estimated that
more than half of all software projects cost more than 189% of
their original projections.
To control large software projects, many companies are now
using project management techniques. Ryder Systems, Inc.,
American Express Financial Advisors, and United Airlines have all
created project management departments for their software and
information systems projects. These departments have the
authority to monitor large software projects and make changes
to deadlines, budgets, and resources used to complete software
development efforts.

Project Crashing
At times, projects have deadlines that may be impossible to meet using the normal procedures
for completion of the project. However, by using overtime, working weekends, hiring extra
workers, or using extra equipment, it may be possible to finish a project in less time than is nor-
mally required. However, the cost of the project will usually increase as a result. When CPM
was developed, the possibility of reducing the project completion time was recognized; this
process is called crashing.
Shortening a project is called
crashing.
When crashing a project, the normal time for each activity is used to find the critical path.
The normal cost is the cost for completing the activity using normal procedures. If the project
completion time using normal procedures meets the deadline that has been imposed, there is no
problem. However, if the deadline is before the normal project completion time, some extraordi-
nary measures must be taken. Another set of times and costs is then developed for each activity.
The crash time is the shortest possible activity time, and this requires the use of additional
resources. The crash cost is the price of completing the activity in an earlier-than-normal time.
If a project must be crashed, it is desirable to do this at the least additional cost.
Project crashing with CPM involves four steps:
Four Steps of Project Crashing
1. Find the normal critical path and identify the critical activities.
2. Compute the crash cost per week (or other time period) for all activities in the network.
This process uses the following formula:4
(12-10)
3. Select the activity on the critical path with the smallest crash cost per week. Crash this
activity to the maximum extent possible or to the point at which your desired deadline has
been reached.
4. Check to be sure that the critical path you were crashing is still critical. Often, a reduction
in activity time along the critical path causes a noncritical path or paths to become critical.
If the critical path is still the longest path through the network, return to step 3. If not, find
the new critical path and return to step 3.
Crash cost>Time period = Crash cost - Normal cost
Normal time - Crash time
4This formula assumes that crash costs are linear. If they are not, adjustments must be made.

480
CHAPTER 12 • PROJECT MANAGEMENT
There are now two critical paths.
General Foundary Example
Suppose that General Foundry had been given 14 weeks instead of 16 weeks to install the new
pollution control equipment or face a court-ordered shutdown. As you recall, the length of
Lester Harky’s critical path was 15 weeks. What can he do? We see that Harky cannot possibly
meet the deadline unless he is able to shorten some of the activity times.
General Foundry’s normal and crash times and normal and crash costs are shown in Table 12.9.
Note, for example, that activity B’s normal time is 3 weeks (this estimate was also used for PERT)
and its crash time is 1 week. This means that the activity can be shortened by 2 weeks if extra re-
sources are provided. The normal cost is $30,000, and the crash cost is $34,000. This implies that
crashing activity B will cost General Foundry an additional $4,000. Crash costs are assumed to be
linear. As shown in Figure 12.11, activity B’s crash cost per week is $2,000. Crash costs for all other
activities can be computed in a similar fashion. Then steps 3 and 4 can be applied to reduce the pro-
ject’s completion time.
Activities A, C, and E are on the critical path, and each have a minimum crash cost per week
of $1,000. Harky can crash activity A by 1 week to reduce the project completion time to
14 weeks. The cost is an additional $1,000.
At this stage, there are two critical paths. The original critical path consists of activities A,
C, E, G, and H, with a total completion time of 14 weeks. The new critical path consists of
activities B, D, G, and H, also with a total completion time of 14 weeks. Any further crashing
must be done to both critical paths. For example, if Harky wants to reduce the project comple-
tion time by an additional 2 weeks, both paths must be reduced. This can be done by reducing
activity G, which is on both critical paths, by two weeks for an additional cost of $2,000 per
week. The total completion time would be 12 weeks, and total crashing cost would be $5,000
($1,000 to reduce activity A by one week and $4,000 to reduce activity G by two weeks).
For small networks, such as General Foundry’s, it is possible to use the four-step procedure
to find the least cost of reducing the project completion dates. For larger networks, however, this
approach is difficult and impractical, and more sophisticated techniques, such as linear program-
ming, must be employed.
Project Crashing with Linear Programming
Linear programming (see Chapters 7 and 8) is another approach to finding the best project crash-
ing schedule. We illustrate its use on General Foundry’s network. The data needed are derived
from Table 12.9 and Figure 12.12.
We begin by defining the decision variables. If X is the earliest finish time for an activity, then
EF for activity A
EF for activity B
EF for activity C
EF for activity D
EF for activity E
EF for activity F
EF for activity G
EF for activity H
start time for project (usually 0)
earliest finish time for the project
Although the starting node has a variable 
associated with it, this is not necessary since it
will be given a value of 0, and this could be used instead of the variable.
Y is defined as the number of weeks that each activity is crashed. YA is the number of weeks
we decide to crash activity A, YB the amount of crash time used for activity B, and so on, up to YH.
OBJECTIVE FUNCTION Since the objective is to minimize the cost of crashing the total project,
our LP objective function is
(These cost coefficients were drawn from the sixth column of Table 12.9.)
+ 500YF + 2,000YG + 3,000YH
 Minimize crash cost = 1,000YA + 2,000YB + 1,000YC + 1,000YD + 1,000YE

CRASH TIME CONSTRAINTS Constraints are required to ensure that each activity is not crashed
more than its maximum allowable crash time. The maximum for each Y variable is the differ-
ence between the normal time and the crash time (from Table 12.9):

CHAPTER 12 • PROJECT MANAGEMENT
Summary
The fundamentals of PERT and CPM are presented in this
chapter. Both of these techniques are excellent for controlling
large and complex projects.
PERT is probabilistic and allows three time estimates for
each activity. These estimates are used to compute the project’s
expected completion time, variance, and the probability that
the project will be completed by a given date. 
an
extension of standard PERT, can be used to plan, schedule,
monitor, and control project costs. Using PERT/Cost, it is
PERT>Cost,
possible to determine if there are cost overruns or underruns at
any point in time. It is also possible to determine whether the
project is on schedule.
CPM, although similar to PERT, has the ability to crash
projects by reducing their completion time through additional
resource expenditures. Finally, we see that linear programming
can also be used to crash a network by a desired amount at a
minimum cost.
12.5
Other Topics in Project Management
We have seen how to schedule a project and develop budget schedules. However, there are other
things that are important and helpful to a project manager. We now briefly introduce these.
Subprojects
For extremely large projects, an activity may be made of several smaller subactivities. Each
activity might be viewed as a smaller project or a subproject of the original project. The person
in charge of the activity might wish to create a PERT/CPM chart for managing this subproject.
Many software packages have the ability to include several levels of subprojects.
Milestones
Major events in a project are often referred to as milestones. These are often reflected in Gantt
charts and PERT charts to highlight the importance of reaching these events.
Resource Leveling
In addition to managing the time and costs involved in a project, a manager must also be con-
cerned with the resources used in a project. These resources might be equipment or people. In
planning a project (and often as part of the work breakdown structure), a manager must identify
which resources are needed with each activity. For example, in a construction project there may
be several activities requiring the use of heavy equipment such as a crane. If the construction
company has only one such crane, then conflicts will occur if two activities requiring the use of
this crane are scheduled for the same day. To alleviate problems such as this, resource leveling is
employed. This means that one or more activities are moved from the earliest start time to an-
other time (no later than the latest start time) so that the resource utilization is more evenly dis-
tributed over time. If the resources are construction crews, this is very beneficial in that the crews
are kept busy and overtime is minimized.
Software
There are numerous project management software packages on the market for both mainframe
computers and personal computers. Some of these are Microsoft Project, Harvard Project Man-
ager, MacProject, Timeline, Primavera Project Planner, Artemis, and Open Plan. Most of this
software will draw PERT charts as well as Gantt charts. They can be used to develop budget
schedules, automatically adjust future start times based on the actual start times for prior activi-
ties, and level the resource utilization.
Good software for personal computers ranges in price from a few hundred dollars to sev-
eral thousand dollars. For mainframe computers, software may cost considerably more. Com-
panies have paid several hundred thousand dollars for project management software and
support because it helps management make better decisions and keep track of things that would
otherwise be unmanageable.

KEY EQUATIONS
485
Glossary
Activity
A time-consuming job or task that is a key subpart
of the total project.
Activity-on-Arc (AOA)
A network in which the activities
are represented by arcs.
Activity-on-Node (AON)
A network in which the activities
are represented by nodes. This is the model illustrated in
our book.
Activity Time Estimates
Three time estimates that are used
in determining the expected completion time and variance
for an activity in a PERT network.
Backward Pass
A procedure that moves from the end of the
network to the beginning of the network. It is used in deter-
mining the latest finish and start times.
Beta Probability Distribution
A probability distribution
that is often used in computing the expected activity com-
pletion times and variances in networks.
CPM
Critical path method. A deterministic network technique
that is similar to PERT but allows for project crashing.
Crashing
The process of reducing the total time that it takes
to complete a project by expending additional funds.
Critical Path
The series of activities that have zero slack. 
It is the longest time path through the network. A delay for
any activity that is on the critical path will delay the comple-
tion of the entire project.
Critical Path Analysis
An analysis that determines the total
project completion time, the critical path for the project,
slack, ES, EF, LS, and LF for every activity.
Earliest Finish Time (EF)
The earliest time that an activity
can be finished without violation of precedence
requirements.
Earliest Start Time (ES)
The earliest time that an activity
can start without violation of precedence requirements.
Event
A point in time that marks the beginning or ending of
an activity.
Expected Activity Time
The average time that it should
take to complete an activity. t = (a + 4m + b)>6.
Forward Pass
A procedure that moves from the beginning of
a network to the end of the network. It is used in determining
earliest activity start times and earliest finish times.
Gantt Chart
A bar chart indicating when the activities (rep-
resented by bars) in a project will be performed.
Immediate Predecessor
An activity that must be completed
before another activity can be started.
Latest Finish Time (LF)
The latest time that an activity can
be finished without delaying the entire project.

The shortest amount of time that could
be required to complete the activity.
PERT
Program evaluation and review technique. A network
technique that allows three time estimates for each activity
in a project.
PERT/Cost
A technique that allows a decision maker to
plan, schedule, monitor, and control project cost as well as
project time.

The greatest amount of time that could
be required to complete the activity.
Resource Leveling
The process of smoothing out the utiliza-
tion of resources in a project.
Slack Time
The amount of time that an activity can be
delayed without delaying the entire project. Slack is equal
to the latest start time minus the earliest start time, or the

CHAPTER 12 • PROJECT MANAGEMENT
12-18 A project was planned using PERT with three time
estimates. The expected completion time of the proj-

the critical path is 9.
(a) What is the probability that the project will be
finished in 40 weeks or less?
(b) What is the probability that the project takes
longer than 40 weeks?
(c) What is the probability that the project will be
finished in 46 weeks or less?
(d) What is the probability that the project will take
longer than 46 weeks?
(e) The project manager wishes to set the due date
for the completion of the project so that there is a
90% chance of finishing on schedule. Thus, there
would only be a 10% chance the project would
take longer than this due date. What should this
due date be?

12-25 The Bender Construction Co. is involved in construct-
ing municipal buildings and other structures that are
used primarily by city and state municipalities. This
requires developing legal documents, drafting feasibil-
ity studies, obtaining bond ratings, and so forth. Re-
cently, Bender was given a request to submit a
proposal for the construction of a municipal building.
The first step is to develop legal documents and to per-
form all steps necessary before the construction con-
tract is signed. This requires more than 20 separate
activities that must be completed. These activities,
their immediate predecessors, and time requirements
are given in Table 12.10 on the next page.
As you can see, optimistic (a), most likely (m),
and pessimistic (b) time estimates have been given
for all of the activities described in the table. Using
the data, determine the total project completion time
for this preliminary step, the critical path, and slack
time for all activities involved.
12-26 Getting a degree from a college or university can be
a long and difficult task. Certain courses must be
completed before other courses may be taken. De-
velop a network diagram, in which every activity is a
particular course that must be taken for a given de-
gree program. The immediate predecessors will be
course prerequisites. Don’t forget to include all uni-
versity, college, and departmental course require-
ments. Then try to group these courses into semesters
or quarters for your particular school. How long do
you think it will take you to graduate? Which
courses, if not taken in the proper sequence, could
delay your graduation?
12-27 Dream Team Productions was in the final design
phases of its new film, Killer Worms, to be released
next summer. Market Wise, the firm hired to coordi-
nate the release of Killer Worms toys, identified 16
critical tasks to be completed before the release of
the film.
(a) How many weeks in advance of the film release
should Market Wise start its marketing cam-
paign? What are the critical path activities? The
tasks are as follows:

activity or activities should be crashed to do this
at the least additional cost? What is the total cost
of this?
(b) List all the paths in this network. After the crash-
ing in part (a) has been done, what is the time
required for each path? If the project completion
time must be reduced another week so that the
total time is 15 weeks, which activity or activi-
ties should be crashed? Solve this by inspection.
Note that it is sometimes better to crash an activ-
ity that is not the least cost for crashing if it is on
several paths rather than to crash several activi-
ties on separate paths when there is more than
one critical path.
12-32 The L. O. Gystics Corporation is in need of a new
regional distribution center. The planning is in the
early stages of this project, but the activities have
been identified along with their predecessors and
their activity times in weeks. The table below pro-
vides this information. Develop a linear program
that could be used to determine the length of the crit-
ical path (i.e., the minimum time required to com-
plete the project). Solve this linear program to find
the critical path and the time required to complete
the project.

Internet Homework Problems
Case Study
Southwestern University Stadium Construction
After six months of study, much political arm wrestling, and
some serious financial analysis, Dr. Martin Starr, president of
Southwestern University, had reached a decision. To the de-
light of its students, and to the disappointment of its athletic
boosters, SWU would not be relocating to a new football site
but would expand the capacity at its on-campus stadium.
Adding 21,000 seats, including dozens of luxury skyboxes,
would not please everyone. The influential football coach, Bo
Pitterno, had long argued the need for a first-class stadium, one
with built-in dormitory rooms for his players and a palatial of-
fice appropriate for the coach of a future NCAA champion
team. But the decision was made, and everyone, including the
coach, would learn to live with it.
The job now was to get construction going immediately af-
ter the current season ended. This would allow exactly 270 days
until the upcoming season opening game. The contractor, Hill
Construction (Bob Hill being an alumnus, of course), signed the
contract. Bob Hill looked at the tasks his engineers had outlined
and looked President Starr in the eye. “I guarantee the team
will be able to take the field on schedule next year,” he said
with a sense of confidence. “I sure hope so,” replied Starr. “The
contract penalty of $10,000 per day for running late is nothing
compared to what Coach Pitterno will do to you if our opening
game with Penn State is delayed or cancelled.” Hill, sweating
slightly, did not respond. In football-crazy Texas, Hill Construc-
tion would be mud if the 270-day target were missed.
Back in his office, Hill again reviewed the data. (See
Table 12.11 and note that optimistic time estimates can be
used as crash times.) He then gathered his foremen. “People,
if we’re not 75% sure we’ll finish this stadium in less than 270
days, I want this project crashed! Give me the cost figures for
a target date of 250 days—also for 240 days. I want to be
early, not just on time!”
Discussion Questions
1. Develop a network drawing for Hill Construction and de-
termine the critical path. How long is the project ex-
pected to take?
2. What is the probability of finishing in 270 days?
3. If it were necessary to crash to 250 or 240 days, how would
Hill do so, and at what costs? As noted in the case, assume
that optimistic time estimates can be used as crash times.
Case Study
Family Planning Research Center of Nigeria
Dr. Adinombe Watage, deputy director of the Family Planning
Research Center in Nigeria’s Over-the-River Province, was as-
signed the task of organizing and training five teams of field
workers to perform educational and outreach activities as part
of a large project to demonstrate acceptance of a new method
of birth control. These workers already had training in family
planning education but must receive specific training regarding
the new method of contraception. Two types of materials must
also be prepared: (1) those for use in training the workers, and
(2) those for distribution in the field. Training faculty must be
brought in and arrangements made for transportation and ac-
commodations for the participants.
Dr. Watage first called a meeting of his office staff.
Together they identified the activities that must be carried out,
their necessary sequences, and the time that they would require.
Their results are displayed in Table 12.12.
Louis Odaga, the chief clerk, noted that the project had to be
completed in 60 days. Whipping out his solar-powered calcula-
tor, he added up the time needed. It came to 94 days. “An impos-
sible task, then,” he noted. “No,” Dr. Watage replied, “some of
these tasks can go forward in parallel.” “Be careful, though,”
warned Mr. Oglagadu, the chief nurse, “there aren’t that many of
us to go around. There are only 10 of us in this office.”
“I can check whether we have enough heads and hands
once I have tentatively scheduled the activities,” Dr. Watage re-
sponded. “If the schedule is too tight, I have permission from
the Pathminder Fund to spend some funds to speed it up, just so
long as I can prove that it can be done at the least cost necessary.
Can you help me prove that? Here are the costs for the activities
with the elapsed time that we planned and the costs and times if
we shorten them to an absolute minimum.” Those data are given
in Table 12.13.

Discussion Questions
1. Some of the tasks in this project can be done in parallel.
Prepare a diagram showing the required network of tasks
and define the critical path. What is the length of the
project without crashing?
2. At this point, can the project be done given the personnel
constraint of 10 persons?
3. If the critical path is longer than 60 days, what is the least
amount that Dr. Watage can spend and still achieve this
schedule objective? How can he prove to Pathminder
Foundation that this is the minimum-cost alternative?

Appendix 12.1 Project Management with QM for Windows
PERT is one of the most popular project management techniques. In this chapter, we explore the
General Foundry, Inc., example. When expected times and variances have been computed for each
activity, we can use the data to determine slack, the critical path, and the total project completion
time. Program 12.3A shows the QM for Windows input screen for the General Foundry problem.
By selecting the precedence list as the type of network, the data can be input without ever con-
structing the network. The method indicated is for three time estimates, although this can be
changed to a single time estimate, crashing, or cost budgeting. Program 12.3B provides the output
for the General Foundry problem. The critical path consists of the activities with zero slack.
PROGRAM 12.3B
QM for Windows
Solution Screen for
General Foundry, Inc.
In addition to basic project management, QM for Windows also allows for project crashing,
in which additional resources are used to reduce project completion time. Program 12.4A
shows the input screen for the General Foundry data from Table 12.9. The output is shown in
Program 12.4B. This indicates that the normal time is 15 weeks, but the project may be finished
in 7 weeks if necessary; it may be finished in any number of weeks between 7 and 15. Selecting
Windows—Crash Schedule provides additional information regarding these other times.

CHAPTER 13 • WAITING LINES AND QUEUING THEORY MODELS
13.1
Introduction
The study of waiting lines, called queuing theory, is one of the oldest and most widely used
quantitative analysis techniques. Waiting lines are an everyday occurrence, affecting people
shopping for groceries, buying gasoline, making a bank deposit, or waiting on the telephone for
the first available airline reservationist to answer. Queues,* another term for waiting lines, may
also take the form of machines waiting to be repaired, trucks in line to be unloaded, or airplanes
lined up on a runway waiting for permission to take off. The three basic components of a queu-
ing process are arrivals, service facilities, and the actual waiting line.
In this chapter we discuss how analytical models of waiting lines can help managers evalu-
ate the cost and effectiveness of service systems. We begin with a look at waiting line costs and
then describe the characteristics of waiting lines and the underlying mathematical assumptions
used to develop queuing models. We also provide the equations needed to compute the operat-
ing characteristics of a service system and show examples of how they are used. Later in the
chapter, you will see how to save computational time by applying queuing tables and by running
waiting line computer programs.
13.2
Waiting Line Costs
Most waiting line problems are centered on the question of finding the ideal level of services
that a firm should provide. Supermarkets must decide how many cash register checkout posi-
tions should be opened. Gasoline stations must decide how many pumps should be opened and
how many attendants should be on duty. Manufacturing plants must determine the optimal num-
ber of mechanics to have on duty each shift to repair machines that break down. Banks must
decide how many teller windows to keep open to serve customers during various hours of the
day. In most cases, this level of service is an option over which management has control. An
extra teller, for example, can be borrowed from another chore or can be hired and trained quickly
if demand warrants it. This may not always be the case, though. A plant may not be able to
locate or hire skilled mechanics to repair sophisticated electronic machinery.
When an organization does have control, its objective is usually to find a happy medium
between two extremes. On the one hand, a firm can retain a large staff and provide many service
facilities. This may result in excellent customer service, with seldom more than one or two cus-
tomers in a queue. Customers are kept happy with the quick response and appreciate the con-
venience. This, however, can become expensive.
The other extreme is to have the minimum possible number of checkout lines, gas pumps, or
teller windows open. This keeps the service cost down but may result in customer dissatisfac-
tion. How many times would you return to a large discount department store that had only one
cash register open during the day you shop? As the average length of the queue increases and
poor service results, customers and goodwill may be lost.
Most managers recognize the trade-off that must take place between the cost of providing
good service and the cost of customer waiting time. They want queues that are short enough so
that customers don’t become unhappy and either storm out without buying or buy but never
return. But they are willing to allow some waiting in line if it is balanced by a significant sav-
ings in service costs.
*The word queue is pronounced like the letter Q, that is, “kew.”
One of the goals of queuing
analysis is finding the best level
of service for an organization.
Managers must deal with the
trade-off between the cost of
providing good service and the
cost of customer waiting time.
The latter may be hard to
quantify.
Queuing theory had its beginning in the research work of a
Danish engineer named A. K. Erlang. In 1909, Erlang experi-
mented with fluctuating demand in telephone traffic. Eight years
later, he published a report addressing the delays in automatic
dialing equipment. At the end of World War II, Erlang’s early work
was extended to more general problems and to business applica-
tions of waiting lines.

Queuing Costs and
Service Levels
One means of evaluating a service facility is thus to look at a total expected cost, a concept
illustrated in Figure 13.1. Total expected cost is the sum of expected service costs plus expected
waiting costs.
Service costs are seen to increase as a firm attempts to raise its level of service. For exam-
ple, if three teams of stevedores, instead of two, are employed to unload a cargo ship, service
costs are increased by the additional price of wages. As service improves in speed, however, the
cost of time spent waiting in lines decreases. This waiting cost may reflect lost productivity of
workers while their tools or machines are awaiting repairs or may simply be an estimate of the
costs of customers lost because of poor service and long queues.
Three Rivers Shipping Company Example
As an illustration, let’s look at the case of the Three Rivers Shipping Company. Three Rivers
runs a huge docking facility located on the Ohio River near Pittsburgh. Approximately five ships
arrive to unload their cargoes of steel and ore during every 12-hour work shift. Each hour that a
ship sits idle in line waiting to be unloaded costs the firm a great deal of money, about $1,000
per hour. From experience, management estimates that if one team of stevedores is on duty to
handle the unloading work, each ship will wait an average of 7 hours to be unloaded. If two
teams are working, the average waiting time drops to 4 hours; for three teams, it’s 3 hours; and
for four teams of stevedores, only 2 hours. But each additional team of stevedores is also an
expensive proposition, due to union contracts.
Three Rivers’s superintendent would like to determine the optimal number of teams of
stevedores to have on duty each shift. The objective is to minimize total expected costs. This
analysis is summarized in Table 13.1. To minimize the sum of service costs and waiting costs,
the firm makes the decision to employ two teams of stevedores each shift.
Total expected cost is the sum of
service plus waiting costs.
The goal is to find the service
level that minimizes total
expected cost.
13.3
Characteristics of a Queuing System
In this section we take a look at the three parts of a queuing system: (1) the arrivals or inputs to
the system (sometimes referred to as the calling population), (2) the queue or the waiting line
itself, and (3) the service facility. These three components have certain characteristics that must
be examined before mathematical queuing models can be developed.
Arrival Characteristics
The input source that generates arrivals or customers for the service system has three major
characteristics. It is important to consider the size of the calling population, the pattern of ar-
rivals at the queuing system, and the behavior of the arrivals.

*Stevedore team salaries are computed as the number of people in a typical team (assumed to be 50), times the number of hours each person works per
day (12 hours), times an hourly salary of $10 per hour. If two teams are employed, the rate is just doubled.
SIZE OF THE CALLING POPULATION Population sizes are considered to be either unlimited
(essentially infinite) or limited (finite). When the number of customers or arrivals on hand at any
given moment is just a small portion of potential arrivals, the calling population is considered
unlimited. For practical purposes, examples of unlimited populations include cars arriving at a
highway tollbooth, shoppers arriving at a supermarket, or students arriving to register for classes
at a large university. Most queuing models assume such an infinite calling population. When this
is not the case, modeling becomes much more complex. An example of a finite population is a
shop with only eight machines that might break down and require service.
PATTERN OF ARRIVALS AT THE SYSTEM Customers either arrive at a service facility according to
some known schedule (for example, one patient every 15 minutes or one student for advising
every half hour) or else they arrive randomly. Arrivals are considered random when they are
independent of one another and their occurrence cannot be predicted exactly. Frequently in queu-
ing problems, the number of arrivals per unit of time can be estimated by a probability distribu-
tion known as the Poisson distribution. See Section 2.14 for details about this distribution.
BEHAVIOR OF THE ARRIVALS Most queuing models assume that an arriving customer is a
patient customer. Patient customers are people or machines that wait in the queue until they
are served and do not switch between lines. Unfortunately, life and quantitative analysis are
complicated by the fact that people have been known to balk or renege. Balking refers to
customers who refuse to join the waiting line because it is too long to suit their needs or inter-
ests. Reneging customers are those who enter the queue but then become impatient and leave
without completing their transaction. Actually, both of these situations just serve to accentu-
ate the need for queuing theory and waiting line analysis. How many times have you seen a
shopper with a basket full of groceries, including perishables such as milk, frozen food, or
meats, simply abandon the shopping cart before checking out because the line was too long?
This expensive occurrence for the store makes managers acutely aware of the importance of
service-level decisions.
Waiting Line Characteristics
The waiting line itself is the second component of a queuing system. The length of a line can be
either limited or unlimited. A queue is limited when it cannot, by law of physical restrictions, in-
crease to an infinite length. This may be the case in a small restaurant that has only 10 tables
and can serve no more than 50 diners an evening. Analytic queuing models are treated in this
chapter under an assumption of unlimited queue length. A queue is unlimited when its size is
unrestricted, as in the case of the tollbooth serving arriving automobiles.
A second waiting line characteristic deals with queue discipline. This refers to the rule by
which customers in the line are to receive service. Most systems use a queue discipline known as

populations are assumed for most
queuing models.

the first-in, first-out (FIFO) rule. In a hospital emergency room or an express checkout line at a
supermarket, however, various assigned priorities may preempt FIFO. Patients who are critically
injured will move ahead in treatment priority over patients with broken fingers or noses. Shoppers
with fewer than 10 items may be allowed to enter the express checkout queue but are then treated
as first come, first served. Computer programming runs are another example of queuing systems
that operate under priority scheduling. In most large companies, when computer-produced pay-
checks are due out on a specific date, the payroll program has highest priority over other runs.*
Service Facility Characteristics
The third part of any queuing system is the service facility. It is important to examine two basic
properties: (1) the configuration of the service system and (2) the pattern of service times.
BASIC QUEUING SYSTEM CONFIGURATIONS Service systems are usually classified in terms of
their number of channels, or number of servers, and number of phases, or number of service
stops, that must be made. A single-channel system, with one server, is typified by the drive-in
bank that has only one open teller, or by the type of drive-through fast-food restaurant that has
become so popular in the United States. If, on the other hand, the bank had several tellers on
duty and each customer waited in one common line for the first available teller, we would have a
multichannel system at work. Many banks today are multichannel service systems, as are most
large barber shops and many airline ticket counters.
A single-phase system is one in which the customer receives service from only one station
and then exits the system. A fast-food restaurant in which the person who takes your order also
brings you the food and takes your money is a single-phase system. So is a driver’s license agency
in which the person taking your application also grades your test and collects the license fee. But
if the restaurant requires you to place your order at one station, pay at a second, and pick up the
food at a third service stop, it becomes a multiphase system. Similarly, if the driver’s license
agency is large or busy, you will probably have to wait in a line to complete the application (the
first service stop), then queue again to have the test graded (the second service stop), and finally
go to a third service counter to pay the fee. To help you relate the concepts of channels and
phases, Figure 13.2 presents four possible configurations.
SERVICE TIME DISTRIBUTION Service patterns are like arrival patterns in that they can be either
constant or random. If service time is constant, it takes the same amount of time to take care of
each customer. This is the case in a machine-performed service operation such as an automatic
car wash. More often, service times are randomly distributed. In many cases it can be assumed
that random service times are described by the negative exponential probability distribution.
See Section 2.13 for details about this distribution.
The exponential distribution is important to the process of building mathematical queuing
models because many of the models’ theoretical underpinnings are based on the assumption of
Poisson arrivals and exponential services. Before they are applied, however, the quantitative an-
alyst can and should observe, collect, and plot service time data to determine if they fit the ex-
ponential distribution.
Identifying Models Using Kendall Notation
D. G. Kendall developed a notation that has been widely accepted for specifying the pattern of ar-
rivals, the service time distribution, and the number of channels in a queuing model. This notation is
often seen in software for queuing models. The basic three-symbol Kendall notation is in the form
where specific letters are used to represent probability distributions. The following letters are
commonly used in Kendall notation:
G = general distribution with mean and variance known
D = constant (deterministic) rate
M =  Poisson distribution for number of occurrences (or exponential times)
Arrival distribution>Service time distribution>Number of service channels open
Most queuing models use the
FIFO rule. This is obviously not
appropriate in all service systems,
especially those dealing with
emergencies.
Number of service channels in a
queuing system is the number of
servers.
Single-phase means the customer
receives service at only one
station before leaving the system.
Multiphase implies two or more
stops before leaving the system.
Service times often follow the
negative exponential distribution.
*The term FIFS (first in, first served) is often used in place of FIFO. Another discipline, LIFS (last in, first served), is
common when material is stacked or piled and the items on top are used first.
It is important to confirm that
the queuing assumptions of
Poisson arrivals and exponential
services are valid before applying
the model.

Defining the Problem
In 2002, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began to require that public health departments
create plans for smallpox vaccinations. A county must be prepared to vaccinate every person in an infected
area in a few days. This was of particular concern after the terrorist attack of September 11, 2001.
Developing a Model
Queuing models for capacity planning and discrete event simulation models were developed through a
joint effort of the Montgomery County (Maryland) Public Health Service and the University of Maryland,
College Park.
Acquiring Input Data
Data were collected on the time required for the vaccinations to occur or for medicine to be dispensed.
Clinical exercises were used for this purpose.
Developing a Solution
The models indicate the number of staff members needed to achieve specific capacities to avoid conges-
tion in the clinics.
Testing the Solution
The smallpox vaccination plan was tested using a simulation of a mock vaccination clinic in a full-scale
exercise involving residents going through the clinic. This highlighted the need for modifications in a few
areas. A computer simulation model was then developed for additional testing.
Analyzing the Results
The results of the capacity planning and queuing model provide very good estimates of the true perform-
ance of the system. Clinic planners and managers can quickly estimate capacity and congestion as the
situation develops.
Implementing the Results
The results of this study are available on a web site for public health professionals to download and use. The
guidelines include suggestions for workstation operations. Improvements to the process are continuing.

Slow Down the Ski Lift to Get Shorter Lines
At a small, five-lift ski resort, management was worried that lift
lines were getting too long. While this is sometimes a nice problem
to have because it means business is booming, it is a problem that
can backfire. If word spreads that a ski resort’s lift lines are too long,
customers may choose to ski elsewhere, where lines are shorter.
Because building new ski lifts requires significant financial
investment, management decided to hire an external consult-
ant with queuing system experience to study the problem.
After several weeks of investigating the problem, collecting
data, and measuring the length of the lift lines at various times,
the consultant presented recommendations to the ski resort’s
management.
Surprisingly, instead of building new ski lifts, the consultant
proposed that management slow down its five ski lifts at the
resort to half their current speed and to double the number of
chairs on each of the lifts. This meant, for example, that instead
of 40 feet between lift chairs, there would be only 20 feet
between lift chairs, but because they were moving more slowly,
there was still the same amount of time for customers to board
the lift. So if a particular lift previously took 4 minutes to get to
the top, it would now take 8 minutes. It was reasoned that skiers
wouldn’t notice the difference in time because they were on the
lifts and enjoying the view on the way to the top; this proved to
be a valid assumption. Moreover, at any given time, twice as
many people could actually be on the ski lifts, and fewer people
were in the lift lines. The problem was solved!

CHAPTER 13 • WAITING LINES AND QUEUING THEORY MODELS
There is a more detailed notation with additional terms that indicate the maximum number in
the system and the population size. When these are omitted, it is assumed there is no limit to the
queue length or the population size. Most of the models we study here will have those properties.
13.4
Single-Channel Queuing Model with Poisson Arrivals 
and Exponential Service Times (
)
M>M>1
In this section we present an analytical approach to determine important measures of perform-
ance in a typical service system. After these numeric measures have been computed, it will be
possible to add in cost data and begin to make decisions that balance desirable service levels
with waiting line service costs.
Assumptions of the Model
The single-channel, single-phase model considered here is one of the most widely used and sim-
plest queuing models. It involves assuming that seven conditions exist:
1. Arrivals are served on a FIFO basis.
2. Every arrival waits to be served regardless of the length of the line; that is, there is no balk-
ing or reneging.
3. Arrivals are independent of preceding arrivals, but the average number of arrivals (the
arrival rate) does not change over time.
4. Arrivals are described by a Poisson probability distribution and come from an infinite or
very large population.
5. Service times also vary from one customer to the next and are independent of one another,
but their average rate is known.
6. Service times occur according to the negative exponential probability distribution.
7. The average service rate is greater than the average arrival rate.
When these seven conditions are met, we can develop a series of equations that define the
queue’s operating characteristics. The mathematics used to derive each equation is rather com-
plex and outside the scope of this book, so we will just present the resulting formulas here.
Queuing Equations
We let
When determining the arrival rate 
and the service rate 
the same time period must be
used. For example, if 
is the average number of arrivals per hour, then 
must indicate the av-
erage number that could be served per hour.
The queuing equations follow.
1. The average number of customers or units in the system, L, that is, the number in line plus
the number being served:
(13-1)
2. The average time a customer spends in the system, W, that is, the time spent in line plus the
time spent being served:

 = mean number of people or items served per time period
l = mean number of arrivals per time period (for example, per hour)
These seven assumptions must be
met if the single-channel, single-
phase model is to be applied.
These seven queuing equations
for the single-channel, single-
phase model describe the
important operating
characteristics of the service
system.

Arnold’s Muffler Shop Case
We now apply these formulas to the case of Arnold’s Muffler Shop in New Orleans. Arnold’s
mechanic, Reid Blank, is able to install new mufflers at an average rate of 3 per hour, or about 1
every 20 minutes. Customers needing this service arrive at the shop on the average of 2 per hour.
Larry Arnold, the shop owner, studied queuing models in an MBA program and feels that all
seven of the conditions for a single-channel model are met. He proceeds to calculate the numer-
ical values of the preceding operating characteristics:

model was valuable in predicting potential waiting times, queue lengths, idle times, and so on.
But it did not identify optimal decisions or consider cost factors. As stated earlier, the solution
to a queuing problem may require management to make a trade-off between the increased cost
of providing better service and the decreased waiting costs derived from providing that service.
These two costs are called the waiting cost and the service cost.
The total service cost is

These costs are based on whatever time units (often hours) are used in determining 
Adding
the total service cost to the total waiting cost, we have the total cost of the queuing system.
When the waiting cost is based on the time in the system, this is
(13-11)
When the waiting cost is based on time in the queue, the total cost is
(13-12)
At times we may wish to determine the daily cost, and then we simply find the total number of
arrivals per day. Let us consider the situation for Arnold’s Muffler Shop.
Arnold estimates that the cost of customer waiting time, in terms of customer dissatisfac-
tion and lost goodwill, is $50 per hour of time spent waiting in line. (After customers’ cars are
actually being serviced on the rack, customers don’t seem to mind waiting.) Because on the
average a car has a 
hour wait and there are approximately 16 cars serviced per day (2 per hour
times 8 working hours per day), the total number of hours that customers spend waiting for muf-
flers to be installed each day is 
or 10 
hours. Hence, in this case,
The only other cost that Larry Arnold can identify in this queuing situation is the pay rate of
Reid Blank, the mechanic. Blank is paid $15 per hour:
The total daily cost of the system as it is currently configured is the total of the waiting cost and
the service cost, which gives us
Now comes a decision. Arnold finds out through the muffler business grapevine that the Rusty
Muffler, a cross-town competitor, employs a mechanic named Jimmy Smith who can efficiently
install new mufflers at the rate of 4 per hour. Larry Arnold contacts Smith and inquires as to his
interest in switching employers. Smith says that he would consider leaving the Rusty Muffler
but only if he were paid a $20 per hour salary. Arnold, being a crafty businessman, decides that
it may be worthwhile to fire Blank and replace him with the speedier but more expensive Smith.
Total daily cost of the queuing system = $533.33 + $120 = $653.33
Total daily service cost = (8 hours per day)mCs = 8(1)($15) = $120

It is quite evident that Smith’s speed will result in considerably shorter queues and waiting
times. For example, a customer would now spend an average of 
hour in the system and 
hour waiting in the queue, as opposed to 1 hour in the system and 
hour in the queue with
Blank as mechanic. The total daily waiting time cost with Smith as the mechanic will be
Notice that the total time spent waiting for the 16 customers per day is now
instead of 10.67 hours with Blank. Thus, the waiting is much less than half of what it was, even
though the service rate only changed from 3 per hour to 4 per hour.
The service cost will go up due to the higher salary, but the overall cost will decrease, as we
see here:
Because the total daily expected cost with Blank as mechanic was $653.33, Arnold may very
well decide to hire Smith and reduce costs by 
per day.
$653.33 - $360 = $293.33
= $360 per day
 Total expected cost = Waiting cost + Service cost = $200 + $160

Enhancing the Queuing Environment
Although reducing the waiting time is an important factor in reducing the waiting time cost of a
queuing system, a manager might find other ways to reduce this cost. The total waiting time cost
is based on the total amount of time spent waiting (based on W or 
) and the cost of waiting
Reducing either of these will reduce the overall cost of waiting. Enhancing the queuing
environment by making the wait less unpleasant may reduce 
as customers will not be as up-
set by having to wait. There are magazines in the waiting room of doctors’ offices for patients to
read while waiting. There are tabloids on display by the checkout lines in grocery stores, and
customers read the headlines to pass time while waiting. Music is often played while telephone
callers are placed on hold. At major amusement parks there are video screens and televisions in
some of the queue lines to make the wait more interesting. For some of these, the waiting line is
so entertaining that it is almost an attraction itself.
All of these things are designed to keep the customer busy and to enhance the conditions
surrounding the waiting so that it appears that time is passing more quickly than it actually is.
Consequently, the cost of waiting 
becomes lower and the total cost of the queuing system
is reduced. Sometimes, reducing the total cost in this way is easier than reducing the total cost
by lowering W or 
In the case of Arnold’s Muffler Shop, Arnold might consider putting a tel-
evision in the waiting room and remodeling this room so customers feel more comfortable while
waiting for their cars to be serviced.

Ambulances in Chile Evaluate and Improve
Performance Metrics Through Queuing Theory
Researchers in Chile turned to queuing theory to evaluate and
improve ambulance services. They investigated the key perform-
ance indicators that are of value to an ambulance company man-
ager (e.g., number of ambulances deployed, ambulance base
locations, operating costs) and the key performance indicators
that are of value to a customer (e.g., waiting time until service,
queue prioritization system).
The somewhat surprising result that the researchers brought
to light was that seemingly simple metrics such as waiting time in
queue, 
were of the most value for ambulance operations.
Reducing wait times saves the ambulance company money in
gasoline and transportation costs, and, more importantly, it
can save lives for its customers. In other words, sometimes sim-
pler is better.

Multichannel Queuing Model with Poisson Arrivals 
and Exponential Service Times (
)
M>M>m
The next logical step is to look at a multichannel queuing system, in which two or more
servers or channels are available to handle arriving customers. Let us still assume that cus-
tomers awaiting service form one single line and then proceed to the first available server. An
example of such a multichannel, single-phase waiting line is found in many banks today.
A common line is formed and the customer at the head of the line proceeds to the first free
teller (Refer to Figure 13.2 for a typical multichannel configuration.)
The multiple-channel system presented here again assumes that arrivals follow a Poisson
probability distribution and that service times are distributed exponentially. Service is first come,
first served, and all servers are assumed to perform at the same rate. Other assumptions listed
earlier for the single-channel model apply as well.
The multichannel model also
assumes Poisson arrivals and
exponential service times.

CHAPTER 13 • WAITING LINES AND QUEUING THEORY MODELS
The muffler shop considers
opening a second muffler service
channel that operates at the
same speed as the first one.
Equations for the Multichannel Queuing Model
If we let
the following formulas may be used in the waiting line analysis:
1. The probability that there are zero customers or units in the system:
(13-13)
2. The average number of customers or units in the system:
(13-14)
3. The average time a unit spends in the waiting line or being serviced (namely, in the
system):
(13-15)
4. The average number of customers or units in line waiting for service:
(13-16)
5. The average time a customer or unit spends in the queue waiting for service:
(13-17)
6. Utilization rate:
(13-18)
These equations are obviously more complex than the ones used in the single-channel
model, yet they are used in exactly the same fashion and provide the same type of information
as did the simpler model.
Arnold’s Muffler Shop Revisited
For an application of the multichannel queuing model, let’s return to the case of Arnold’s Muf-
fler Shop. Earlier, Larry Arnold examined two options. He could retain his current mechanic,
Reid Blank, at a total expected cost of $653 per day; or he could fire Blank and hire a slightly
more expensive but faster worker named Jimmy Smith. With Smith on board, service system
costs could be reduced to $360 per day.
A third option is now explored. Arnold finds that at minimal after-tax cost he can open a
second garage bay in which mufflers can be installed. Instead of firing his first mechanic, Blank,
he would hire a second worker. The new mechanic would be expected to install mufflers at the
same rate as Blank—about 
per hour. Customers, who would still arrive at the rate of
per hour, would wait in a single line until one of the two mechanics is free. To find out

how this option compares with the old single-channel waiting line system, Arnold computes sev-
eral operating characteristics for the 
channel system:
These data are compared with earlier operating characteristics in Table 13.2. The increased serv-
ice from opening a second channel has a dramatic effect on almost all characteristics. In particu-
lar, time spent waiting in line drops from 40 minutes with one mechanic (Blank) or 15 minutes
with Smith down to only 
minutes! Similarly, the average number of cars in the queue falls
to 0.083 (about 
of a car).* But does this mean that a second bay should be opened?
To complete his economic analysis, Arnold assumes that the second mechanic would be paid
the same as the current one, Blank, namely, $15 per hour. The daily waiting cost now will be

Dramatically lower waiting time
results from opening the second

*You might note that adding a second mechanic does not cut queue waiting time and length just in half, but makes it
even smaller. This is because of the random arrival and service processes. When there is only one mechanic and two
customers arrive within a minute of each other, the second will have a long wait. The fact that the mechanic may have
been idle for 30 to 40 minutes before they both arrive does not change this average waiting time. Thus, single-channel
models often have high wait times relative to multichannel models.

CHAPTER 13 • WAITING LINES AND QUEUING THEORY MODELS
Notice that the total waiting time for the 16 cars per day is 
hours per day instead of the 10.67 hours with only one mechanic.
The service cost is doubled, as there are two mechanics, so this is
The total daily cost of the system as it is currently configured is the total of the waiting cost and
the service cost, which is
As you recall, total cost with just Blank as mechanic was found to be $653 per day. Cost with
just Smith was just $360. Opening a second service bay will save about $380 per day compared
to the current system, and it will save about $87 per day compared to the system with the faster
mechanic. Thus, because the after-tax cost of a second bay is very low, Arnold’s decision is to
open a second service bay and hire a second worker who is paid the same as Blank. This may
have additional benefits because word may spread about the very short waits at Arnold’s Muf-
fler Shop, and this may increase the number of customers who choose to use Arnold’s.

Constant Service Time Model (

M>D>
Some service systems have constant service times instead of exponentially distributed times.
When customers or equipment are processed according to a fixed cycle, as in the case of an au-
tomatic car wash or an amusement park ride, constant service rates are appropriate. Because
constant rates are certain, the values for 
and W are always less than they would be in
the models we have just discussed, which have variable service times. As a matter of fact, both
the average queue length and the average waiting time in the queue are halved with the constant
service rate model.

Queuing at the Polls
The long lines at the polls in recent presidential elections have
caused some concern. In 2000, some voters in Florida waited in
line over 2 hours to cast their ballots. The final tally favored the
winner by 527 votes of the almost 6 million votes cast in that
state. Some voters growing tired of waiting and simply leaving
the line without voting may have affected the outcome. A change
of 0.01% could have caused different results. In 2004, there were
reports of voters in Ohio waiting in line 10 hours to vote. If as few
as 19 potential voters at each precinct in the 12 largest counties
in Ohio got tired of waiting and left without voting, the outcome
of the election may have been different. There were obvious
problems with the number of machines available in some of the
precincts. One precinct needed 13 machines but had only 2. Inex-
plicably, there were 68 voting machines in warehouses that were
not even used. Other states had some long lines as well.
The basic problem stems from not having enough voting
machines in many of the precincts, although some precincts
had sufficient machines and no problems. Why was there such a
problem in some of the voting precincts? Part of the reason is re-
lated to poor forecasting of the voter turnout in various precincts.
Whatever the cause, the misallocation of voting machines among
the precincts seems to be a major cause of the long lines in the
national elections. Queuing models can help provide a scientific
way to analyze the needs and anticipate the voting lines based on
the number of machines provided.
The basic voting precinct can be modeled as a multichannel
queuing system. By evaluating a range of values for the forecast
number of voters at the different times of the day, a determina-
tion can be made on how long the lines will be, based on the
number of voting machines available. While there still could be
some lines if the state does not have enough voting machines to
meet the anticipated need, the proper distribution of these ma-
chines will help to keep the waiting times reasonable.

Finite Population Model (

When there is a limited population of potential customers for a service facility, we need to con-
sider a different queuing model. This model would be used, for example, if you were consider-
ing equipment repairs in a factory that has five machines, if you were in charge of maintenance
for a fleet of 10 commuter airplanes, or if you ran a hospital ward that has 20 beds. The limited
population model permits any number of repair people (servers) to be considered.

FINITE POPULATION MODEL (M/M/1 WITH FINITE SOURCE)
517
*Although there is no definite number that we can use to divide finite from infinite populations, the general rule of
thumb is this: If the number in the queue is a significant proportion of the calling population, use a finite queuing
model. Finite Queuing Tables, by L. G. Peck and R. N. Hazelwood (New York: John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 1958),
eliminates much of the mathematics involved in computing the operating characteristics for such a model.
The reason this model differs from the three earlier queuing models is that there is now a
dependent relationship between the length of the queue and the arrival rate. To illustrate the ex-
treme situation, if your factory had five machines and all were broken and awaiting repair, the
arrival rate would drop to zero. In general, as the waiting line becomes longer in the limited pop-
ulation model, the arrival rate of customers or machines drops lower.
In this section, we describe a finite calling population model that has the following
assumptions:
1. There is only one server.
2. The population of units seeking service is finite.*
3. Arrivals follow a Poisson distribution, and service times are exponentially distributed.
4. Customers are served on a first-come, first-served basis.

13.8
Some General Operating Characteristic Relationships
Certain relationships exist among specific operating characteristics for any queuing system in a
steady state. A steady state condition exists when a queuing system is in its normal stabilized
operating condition, usually after an initial or transient state that may occur (e.g., having cus-
tomers waiting at the door when a business opens in the morning). Both the arrival rate and the
service rate should be stable in this state. John D. C. Little is credited with the first two of these
relationships, and hence they are called Little’s Flow Equations:
(13-29)
(13-30)
A third condition that must always be met is
Average time in 
time in 
time receiving service
(13-31)
The advantage of these formulas is that once one of these four characteristics is known, the other
characteristics can easily be found. This is important because for certain queuing models, one of
these may be much easier to determine than the others. These are applicable to all of the queu-
ing systems discussed in this chapter except the finite population model.
W = Wq + 1>
queue + average
system = average
Lq = lWq (or Wq = Lq>l)
L = lW (or W = L>l)
A steady state is the normal
operating condition of the
queuing system.
A queuing system is in a
transient state before the steady
state is reached.
13.9
More Complex Queuing Models and the Use of Simulation
Many practical waiting line problems that occur in production and operations service systems
have characteristics like those of Arnold’s Muffler Shop, Garcia-Golding Recycling Inc., or the
Department of Commerce. This is true when the situation calls for single- or multichannel wait-
ing lines, with Poisson arrivals and exponential or constant service times, an infinite calling pop-
ulation, and FIFO service.
Often, however, variations of this specific case are present in an analysis. Service times
in an automobile repair shop, for example, tend to follow the normal probability distribution
instead of the exponential. A college registration system in which seniors have first choice of
courses and hours over all other students is an example of a first-come, first-served model with
a preemptive priority queue discipline. A physical examination for military recruits is an exam-
ple of a multiphase system—one that differs from the single-phase models discussed in this
chapter. A recruit first lines up to have blood drawn at one station, then waits to take an eye
exam at the next station, talks to a psychiatrist at the third, and is examined by a doctor for
medical problems at the fourth. At each phase, the recruit must enter another queue and wait
his or her turn.
Models to handle these cases have been developed by operations researchers. The com-
putations for the resulting mathematical formulations are somewhat more complex than the
ones covered in this chapter,* and many real-world queuing applications are too complex to be
modeled analytically at all. When this happens, quantitative analysts usually turn to computer
simulation.
Simulation, the topic of Chapter 14, is a technique in which random numbers are used
to draw inferences about probability distributions (such as arrivals and services). Using this
approach, many hours, days, or months of data can be developed by a computer in a few sec-
onds. This allows analysis of controllable factors, such as adding another service channel, with-
out actually doing so physically. Basically, whenever a standard analytical queuing model
provides only a poor approximation of the actual service system, it is wise to develop a simula-
tion model instead.
More sophisticated models exist
to handle variations of basic
assumptions, but when even
these do not apply we can turn to
computer simulation, the topic of
Chapter 14.
*Often, the qualitative results of queuing models are as useful as the quantitative results. Results show that it is inher-
ently more efficient to pool resources, use central dispatching, and provide single multiple-server systems rather than
multiple single-server systems.

CHAPTER 13 • WAITING LINES AND QUEUING THEORY MODELS
Summary
Waiting lines and service systems are important parts of the
business world. In this chapter we describe several common
queuing situations and present mathematical models for ana-
lyzing waiting lines following certain assumptions. Those as-
sumptions are that (1) arrivals come from an infinite or very
large population, (2) arrivals are Poisson distributed, (3) ar-
rivals are treated on a FIFO basis and do not balk or renege, (4)
service times follow the negative exponential distribution or
are constant, and (5) the average service rate is faster than the
average arrival rate.
The models illustrated in this chapter are for single-
channel, single-phase and multichannel, single-phase problems.
After a series of operating characteristics are computed, total
expected costs are studied. As shown graphically in Figure 13.1,
total cost is the sum of the cost of providing service plus the
cost of waiting time.
Key operating characteristics for a system are shown to be
(1) utilization rate, (2) percent idle time, (3) average time spent

customers in the system and in the queue, and (5) probabilities
of various numbers of customers in the system.
The chapter emphasizes that a variety of queuing models
exist that do not meet all of the assumptions of the traditional
models. In these cases we use more complex mathematical
models or turn to a technique called computer simulation. The
application of simulation to problems of queuing systems, in-
ventory control, machine breakdown, and other quantitative
analysis situations is the topic discussed in Chapter 14.

Solved Problems
Solved Problem 13-1
The Maitland Furniture store gets an average of 50 customers per shift. The manager of Maitland wants
to calculate whether she should hire 1, 2, 3, or 4 salespeople. She has determined that average waiting
times will be 7 minutes with 1 salesperson, 4 minutes with 2 salespeople, 3 minutes with 3 salespeople,
and 2 minutes with 4 salespeople. She has estimated the cost per minute that customers wait at $1. The
cost per salesperson per shift (including benefits) is $70.

to hire 2 salespeople.
Solved Problem 13-2
Marty Schatz owns and manages a chili dog and soft drink store near the campus. Although Marty can
service 30 customers per hour on the average 
he only gets 20 customers per hour 
Because
Marty could wait on 50% more customers than actually visit his store, it doesn’t make sense to him that
he should have any waiting lines.
Marty hires you to examine the situation and to determine some characteristics of his queue. After
looking into the problem, you find this to be an

Solved Problem 13-3
Refer to Solved Problem 13-2. Marty agreed that these figures seemed to represent his approximate
business situation. You are quite surprised at the length of the lines and elicit from him an estimated
value of the customer’s waiting time (in the queue, not being waited on) at 10 cents per minute. During
the 12 hours that he is open he gets 
customers. The average customer is in a queue 4
minutes, so the total customer waiting time is 
The value of 960 min-
utes is 
You tell Marty that not only is 10 cents per minute quite conserva-
tive, but he could probably save most of that $96 of customer ill will if he hired another salesclerk. After
much haggling, Marty agrees to provide you with all the chili dogs you can eat during a week-long pe-
riod in exchange for your analysis of the results of having two clerks wait on the customers.
Assuming that Marty hires one additional salesclerk whose service rate equals Marty’s rate, com-
plete the analysis.

Solved Problem 13-4
Vacation Inns is a chain of hotels operating in the southwestern part of the United States. The company
uses a toll-free telephone number to take reservations for any of its hotels. The average time to handle
each call is 3 minutes, and an average of 12 calls are received per hour. The probability distribution that
describes the arrivals is unknown. Over a period of time it is determined that the average caller spends
6 minutes either on hold or receiving service. Find the average time in the queue, the average time in
the system, the average number in the queue, and the average number in the system.
Solution
The probability distributions are unknown, but we are given the average time in the system (6 minutes).
Thus, we can use Little’s Flow Equations:
 Average number in queue = Lq = lWq = 12(0.05) = 0.6 caller
 Average number in system = L = lW = 12(0.1) = 1.2 callers
 Average time in queue = Wq = W - 1> = 0.1 - 1>20 = 0.1 - 0.05 = 0.05 hour

13-10 The Schmedley Discount Department Store has ap-
proximately 300 customers shopping in its store be-
tween 9 A.M. and 5 P.M. on Saturdays. In deciding
how many cash registers to keep open each Satur-
day, Schmedley’s manager considers two factors:
customer waiting time (and the associated waiting
cost) and the service costs of employing additional
checkout clerks. Checkout clerks are paid an average
of $8 per hour. When only one is on duty, the wait-
ing time per customer is about 10 minutes (or 
hour); when two clerks are on duty, the average
checkout time is 6 minutes per person; 4 minutes
when three clerks are working; and 3 minutes when
four clerks are on duty.
Schmedley’s management has conducted cus-
tomer satisfaction surveys and has been able to esti-
mate that the store suffers approximately $10 in lost
sales and goodwill for every hour of customer time
spent waiting in checkout lines. Using the informa-
tion provided, determine the optimal number of
clerks to have on duty each Saturday to minimize the
store’s total expected cost.

13-13 Mike Dreskin manages a large Los Angeles movie
theater complex called Cinema I, II, III, and IV. Each
of the four auditoriums plays a different film; the
schedule is set so that starting times are staggered to
avoid the large crowds that would occur if all four
movies started at the same time. The theater has a sin-
gle ticket booth and a cashier who can maintain an av-
erage service rate of 280 movie patrons per hour.
Service times are assumed to follow an exponential
distribution. Arrivals on a typically active day are
Poisson distributed and average 210 per hour.
To determine the efficiency of the current ticket
operation, Mike wishes to examine several queue
operating characteristics.
(a) Find the average number of moviegoers waiting
in line to purchase a ticket.
(b) What percentage of the time is the cashier busy?

DISCUSSION QUESTIONS AND PROBLEMS

13-15 The wheat harvesting season in the American Mid-
west is short, and most farmers deliver their truck-
loads of wheat to a giant central storage bin within a
two-week span. Because of this, wheat-filled trucks
waiting to unload and return to the fields have been
known to back up for a block at the receiving bin.
The central bin is owned cooperatively, and it is to
every farmer’s benefit to make the unloading/storage
process as efficient as possible. The cost of grain de-
terioration caused by unloading delays, the cost of
truck rental, and idle driver time are significant con-
cerns to the cooperative members. Although farmers
have difficulty quantifying crop damage, it is easy to
assign a waiting and unloading cost for truck and
driver of $18 per hour. The storage bin is open and
operated 16 hours per day, 7 days per week, during
the harvest season and is capable of unloading 35
trucks per hour according to an exponential distribu-
tion. Full trucks arrive all day long (during the hours
the bin is open) at a rate of about 30 per hour, fol-
lowing a Poisson pattern.
To help the cooperative get a handle on the
problem of lost time while trucks are waiting in line
or unloading at the bin, find the
(a) average number of trucks in the unloading system.
(b) average time per truck in the system.
(c) utilization rate for the bin area.
(d) probability that there are more than three trucks
in the system at any given time.
(e) total daily cost to the farmers of having their
trucks tied up in the unloading process.
The cooperative, as mentioned, uses the storage bin
only two weeks per year. Farmers estimate that en-
larging the bin would cut unloading costs by 50%
next year. It will cost $9,000 to do so during the off-
season. Would it be worth the cooperative’s while to
enlarge the storage area?
13-16 Ashley’s Department Store in Kansas City maintains
a successful catalog sales department in which a
clerk takes orders by telephone. If the clerk is occu-
pied on one line, incoming phone calls to the catalog
department are answered automatically by a record-
ing machine and asked to wait. As soon as the clerk
is free, the party that has waited the longest is trans-
ferred and answered first. Calls come in at a rate of
about 12 per hour. The clerk is capable of taking an
order in an average of 4 minutes. Calls tend to fol-
low a Poisson distribution, and service times tend to
be exponential. The clerk is paid $10 per hour, but
because of lost goodwill and sales, Ashley’s loses
about $50 per hour of customer time spent waiting
for the clerk to take an order.
(a) What is the average time that catalog customers
must wait before their calls are transferred to the
order clerk?
(b) What is the average number of callers waiting to

(c) Ashley’s is considering adding a second clerk to
take calls. The store would pay that person the
same $10 per hour. Should it hire another clerk?
Explain.
13-17 Automobiles arrive at the drive-through window at a
post office at the rate of 4 every 10 minutes. The av-
erage service time is 2 minutes. The Poisson distri-
bution is appropriate for the arrival rate and service
times are exponentially distributed.
(a) What is the average time a car is in the system?
(b) What is the average number of cars in the system?
(c) What is the average time cars spend waiting to
receive service?
(d) What is the average number of cars in line
behind the customer receiving service?
(e) What is the probability that there are no cars at
the window?
(f) What percentage of the time is the postal clerk
busy?
(g) What is the probability that there are exactly two
cars in the system?
13-18 For the post office in Problem 13-17, a second drive-
through window is being considered. A single line
would be formed and as a car reached the front of
the line it would go to the next available clerk. The
clerk at the new window works at the same rate as
the current one.

13-19 Juhn and Sons Wholesale Fruit Distributors employ
one worker whose job is to load fruit on outgoing
company trucks. Trucks arrive at the loading gate at
an average of 24 per day, or 3 per hour, according to
a Poisson distribution. The worker loads them at a
rate of 4 per hour, following approximately the ex-
ponential distribution in service times.
Determine the operating characteristics of this
loading gate problem. What is the probability that
there will be more than three trucks either being
loaded or waiting? Discuss the results of your queu-
ing model computation.
13-20 Juhn believes that adding a second fruit loader will
substantially improve the firm’s efficiency. He esti-
mates that a two-person crew, still acting like a
single-server system, at the loading gate will double
the loading rate from 4 trucks per hour to 8 trucks

per hour. Analyze the effect on the queue of such a
change and compare the results with those found in
Problem 13-19.
13-21 Truck drivers working for Juhn and Sons (see Prob-
lems 13-19 and 13-20) are paid a salary of $10 per
hour on average. Fruit loaders receive about $6 per
hour. Truck drivers waiting in the queue or at the
loading gate are drawing a salary but are produc-
tively idle and unable to generate revenue during
that time. What would be the hourly cost savings to
the firm associated with employing two loaders
instead of one?
13-22 Juhn and Sons Wholesale Fruit Distributors (of
Problem 13-19) are considering building a second
platform or gate to speed the process of loading their
fruit trucks. This, they think, will be even more effi-
cient than simply hiring another loader to help out
the first platform (as in Problem 13-20).
Assume that workers at each platform will be
able to load 4 trucks per hour each and that trucks
will continue to arrive at the rate of 3 per hour. Find
the waiting line’s new operating conditions. Is this
new approach indeed speedier than the other two
considered?
13-23 Bill First, general manager of Worthmore Department
Store, has estimated that every hour of customer time
spent waiting in line for the sales clerk to become
available costs the store $100 in lost sales and good-
will. Customers arrive at the checkout counter at the
rate of 30 per hour, and the average service time is 3
minutes. The Poisson distribution describes the ar-
rivals and the service times are exponentially distrib-
uted. The number of sales clerks can be 2, 3, or 4,
with each one working at the same rate. Bill estimates
the salary and benefits for each clerk to be $10 per
hour. The store is open 10 hours per day.
(a) Find the average time in the line if 2, 3, and 4
clerks are used.
(b) What is the total time spent waiting in line each
day if 2, 3, and 4 clerks are used?
(c) Calculate the total of the daily waiting cost and
the service cost if 2, 3, and 4 clerks are used.
What is the minimum total daily cost?
13-24 Billy’s Bank is the only bank in a small town in
Arkansas. On a typical Friday, an average of 10 cus-
tomers per hour arrive at the bank to transact business.
There is one single teller at the bank, and the average
time required to transact business is 4 minutes. It is
assumed that service times can be described by the
exponential distribution. Although this is the only
bank in town, some people in the town have begun us-
ing the bank in a neighboring town about 20 miles
away. A single line would be used, and the customer
at the front of the line would go to the first available
bank teller. If a single teller at Billy’s is used, find
(a) the average time in the line.
(b) the average number in the line.
(c) the average time in the system.
(d) the average number in the system.
(e) the probability that the bank is empty.
13-25 Refer to the Billy’s Bank situation in Problem 13-24.
Billy is considering adding a second teller (who
would work at the same rate as the first) to reduce
the waiting time for customers, and he assumes that
this will cut the waiting time in half. If a second
teller is added, find
(a) the average time in the line.
(b) the average number in the line.
(c) the average time in the system.
(d) the average number in the system.
(e) the probability that the bank is empty.
13-26 For the Billy’s Bank situation in Problems 13-24 and
13-25, the salary and benefits for a teller would be
$12 per hour. The bank is open 8 hours each day. It
has been estimated that the waiting time cost per
hour is $25 per hour in the line.
(a) How many customers would enter the bank on a
typical day?
(b) How much total time would the customers spend
waiting in line during the entire day if one teller
were used? What is the total daily waiting time
cost?
(c) How much total time would the customers spend
waiting in line during the entire day if two tellers
were used? What is the total waiting time cost?
(d) If Billy wishes to minimize the total waiting
time and personnel cost, how many tellers should
be used?

13-29 One mechanic services 5 drilling machines for a
steel plate manufacturer. Machines break down on
an average of once every 6 working days, and break-
downs tend to follow a Poisson distribution. The
mechanic can handle an average of one repair job
per day. Repairs follow an exponential distribution.

13-31 The typical subway station in Washington, D.C., has
6 turnstiles, each of which can be controlled by the
station manager to be used for either entrance or exit
control—but never for both. The manager must de-
cide at different times of the day just how many
turnstiles to use for entering passengers and how
many to be set up to allow exiting passengers.
At the Washington College Station, passengers
enter the station at a rate of about 84 per minute be-
tween the hours of 7 and 9 A.M. Passengers exiting
trains at the stop reach the exit turnstile area at a
rate of about 48 per minute during the same morn-
ing rush hours. Each turnstile can allow an average
of 30 passengers per minute to enter or exit. Arrival
and service times have been thought to follow Pois-
son and exponential distributions, respectively. As-
sume riders form a common queue at both entry and
exit turnstile areas and proceed to the first empty
turnstile.
The Washington College Station manager does
not want the average passenger at his station to have
to wait in a turnstile line for more than 6 seconds,
nor does he want more than 8 people in any queue at
any average time.
(a) How many turnstiles should be opened in each
direction every morning?
(b) Discuss the assumptions underlying the solution
of this problem using queuing theory.

arrivals per time period is described by the Poisson
distribution.

Overview of Factory
Case Study
New England Foundry
For more than 75 years, New England Foundry, Inc., has man-
ufactured wood stoves for home use. In recent years, with in-
creasing energy prices, George Mathison, president of New
England Foundry, has seen sales triple. This dramatic increase
in sales has made it even more difficult for George to maintain
quality in all the wood stoves and related products.
Unlike other companies manufacturing wood stoves, New
England Foundry is only in the business of making stoves and
stove-related products. Their major products are the Warmglo I,
the Warmglo II, the Warmglo III, and the Warmglo IV. The
Warmglo I is the smallest wood stove, with a heat output of
30,000 Btu, and the Warmglo IV is the largest, with a heat out-
put of 60,000 Btu. In addition, New England Foundry, Inc., pro-
duces a large array of products that have been designed to be
used with one of their four stoves, including warming shelves,
surface thermometers, stovepipes, adaptors, stove gloves, triv-
ets, mitten racks, andirons, chimneys, and heat shields. New
England Foundry also publishes a newsletter and several paper-
back books on stove installation, stove operation, stove mainte-
nance, and wood sources. It is George’s belief that its wide
assortment of products was a major contributor to the sales in-
creases.
The Warmglo III outsells all the other stoves by a wide
margin. The heat output and available accessories are ideal for
the typical home. The Warmglo III also has a number of out-
standing features that make it one of the most attractive and
heat-efficient stoves on the market. Each Warmglo III has a
thermostatically controlled primary air intake valve that allows
the stove to adjust itself automatically to produce the correct
heat output for varying weather conditions. A secondary air
opening is used to increase the heat output in case of very cold
weather. The internal stove parts produce a horizontal flame
path for more efficient burning, and the output gases are forced
to take an S-shaped path through the stove. The S-shaped path
allows more complete combustion of the gases and better heat
transfer from the fire and gases through the cast iron to the area
to be heated. These features, along with the accessories, re-
sulted in expanding sales and prompted George to build a new
factory to manufacture Warmglo III stoves. An overview dia-
gram of the factory is shown in Figure 13.3.
The new foundry uses the latest equipment, including a
new Disamatic that helps in manufacturing stove parts. Regard-
less of new equipment or procedures, casting operations have
remained basically unchanged for hundreds of years. To begin
with, a wooden pattern is made for every cast-iron piece in the
stove. The wooden pattern is an exact duplication of the cast-
iron piece that is to be manufactured. New England Foundry has
all of its patterns made by Precision Patterns, Inc., and these
patterns are stored in the pattern shop and maintenance room.
Then a specially formulated sand is molded around the wooden
pattern. There can be two or more sand molds for each pattern.
Mixing the sand and making the molds are done in the molding
room. When the wooden pattern is removed, the resulting sand
molds form a negative image of the desired casting. Next, the
molds are transported to the casting room, where molten iron is
poured into the molds and allowed to cool. When the iron has
solidified, the molds are moved into the cleaning, grinding, and
preparation room. The molds are dumped into large vibrators
that shake most of the sand from the casting. The rough castings
are then subjected to both sandblasting to remove the rest of the
sand and grinding to finish some of the surfaces of the castings.
The castings are then painted with a special heat-resistant paint,
assembled into workable stoves, and inspected for manufactur-
ing defects that may have gone undetected thus far. Finally, the
finished stoves are moved to storage and shipping, where they
are packaged and shipped to the appropriate locations.
At present, the pattern shop and the maintenance depart-
ment are located in the same room. One large counter is used
by both maintenance personnel to get tools and parts and by
sand molders that need various patterns for the molding oper-
ation. Peter Nawler and Bob Bryan, who work behind the
counter, are able to service a total of 10 people per hour (or
about 5 per hour each). On the average, 4 people from mainte-
nance and 3 people from the molding department arrive at the
counter per hour. People from the molding department and
from maintenance arrive randomly, and to be served they form
a single line. Pete and Bob have always had a policy of first
come, first served. Because of the location of the pattern shop
and maintenance department, it takes about 3 minutes for a
person from the maintenance department to walk to the pattern
and maintenance room, and it takes about 1 minute for a per-
son to walk from the molding department to the pattern and
maintenance room.

CASE STUDY
531
After observing the operation of the pattern shop and main-
tenance room for several weeks, George decided to make some
changes to the layout of the factory. An overview of these
changes is shown in Figure 13.4.
Separating the maintenance shop from the pattern shop had
a number of advantages. It would take people from the mainte-
nance department only 1 minute instead of 3 to get to the new
maintenance department. Using time and motion studies,
George was also able to determine that improving the layout of
the maintenance department would allow Bob to serve 6 people
from the maintenance department per hour, and improving the
layout of the pattern department would allow Pete to serve
7 people from the molding shop per hour.
Discussion Questions
1. How much time would the new layout save?
2. If maintenance personnel were paid $9.50 per hour and
molding personnel were paid $11.75 per hour, how much
could be saved per hour with the new factory layout?

Winter Park Hotel
Donna Shader, manager of the Winter Park Hotel, is consider-
ing how to restructure the front desk to reach an optimum level
of staff efficiency and guest service. At present, the hotel has
five clerks on duty, each with a separate waiting line, during
the peak check-in time of 3:00 P.M. to 5:00 P.M. Observation of
arrivals during this time show that an average of 90 guests ar-
rive each hour (although there is no upward limit on the num-
ber that could arrive at any given time). It takes an average of
3 minutes for the front-desk clerk to register each guest.
Donna is considering three plans for improving guest serv-
ice by reducing the length of time guests spend waiting in line.
The first proposal would designate one employee as a quick-
service clerk for guests registering under corporate accounts,
a market segment that fills about 30% of all occupied rooms.
Because corporate guests are preregistered, their registration
takes just 2 minutes. With these guests separated from the rest
of the clientele, the average time for registering a typical guest
would climb to 3.4 minutes. Under plan 1, noncorporate guests
would choose any of the remaining four lines.
The second plan is to implement a single-line system. All
guests could form a single waiting line to be served by whichever
of five clerks became available. This option would require suffi-
cient lobby space for what could be a substantial queue.
The third proposal involves using an automatic teller ma-
chine (ATM) for check-ins. This ATM would provide approxi-
mately the same service rate as a clerk would. Given that initial
use of this technology might be minimal, Shader estimated that
20% of customers, primarily frequent guests, would be willing
to use the machines. (This might be a conservative estimate if
the guests perceive direct benefits from using the ATM, as bank
customers do. Citibank reports that some 95% of its Manhattan
customers use its ATMs.) Donna would set up a single queue
for customers who prefer human check-in clerks. This would be
served by the five clerks, although Donna is hopeful that the
machine will allow a reduction to four.
Discussion Questions
1. Determine the average amount of time that a guest spends
checking in. How would this change under each of the
stated options?
2. Which option do you recommend?

CHAPTER 14 • SIMULATION MODELING
14.1
Introduction
We are all aware to some extent of the importance of simulation models in our world. Boeing
Corporation and Airbus Industries, for example, commonly build simulation models of their pro-
posed jet aircraft and then test the aerodynamic properties of the models. Your local civil defense
organization may carry out rescue and evacuation practices as it simulates the natural disaster
conditions of a hurricane or tornado. The U.S. Army simulates enemy attacks and defense strate-
gies in war games played on a computer. Business students take courses that use management
games to simulate realistic competitive business situations. And thousands of business, govern-
ment, and service organizations develop simulation models to assist in making decisions concern-
ing inventory control, maintenance scheduling, plant layout, investments, and sales forecasting.
As a matter of fact, simulation is one of the most widely used quantitative analysis tools.
Various surveys of the largest U.S. corporations reveal that over half use simulation in corporate
planning.
Simulation sounds like it may be the solution to all management problems. This is, unfortu-
nately, by no means true. Yet we think you may find it one of the most flexible and fascinating
of the quantitative techniques in your studies. Let’s begin our discussion of simulation with a
simple definition.
To simulate is to try to duplicate the features, appearance, and characteristics of a real system.
In this chapter we show how to simulate a business or management system by building a
mathematical model that comes as close as possible to representing the reality of the system. We
won’t build any physical models, as might be used in airplane wind tunnel simulation tests. But just
as physical model airplanes are tested and modified under experimental conditions, our mathemati-
cal models are used to experiment and to estimate the effects of various actions. The idea behind
simulation is to imitate a real-world situation mathematically, then to study its properties and oper-
ating characteristics, and, finally, to draw conclusions and make action decisions based on the
results of the simulation. In this way, the real-life system is not touched until the advantages and
disadvantages of what may be a major policy decision are first measured on the system’s model.
Using simulation, a manager should (1) define a problem, (2) introduce the variables asso-
ciated with the problem, (3) construct a simulation model, (4) set up possible courses of action
for testing, (5) run the simulation experiment, (6) consider the results (possibly deciding to mod-
ify the model or change data inputs), and (7) decide what course of action to take. These steps
are illustrated in Figure 14.1.
The problems tackled by simulation can range from very simple to extremely complex, from
bank teller lines to an analysis of the U.S. economy. Although very small simulations can be con-
ducted by hand, effective use of this technique requires some automated means of calculation,
namely, a computer. Even large-scale models, simulating perhaps years of business decisions, can
be handled in a reasonable amount of time by computer. Though simulation is one of the oldest
The idea behind simulation is to
imitate a real-world situation
with a mathematical model that
does not affect operations. The
seven steps of simulation are
illustrated in Figure 14.1.

quantitative analysis tools (see the History below), it was not until the introduction of computers
in the mid-1940s and early 1950s that it became a practical means of solving management and
military problems.
We begin this chapter with a presentation of the advantages and disadvantages of simula-
tion. An explanation of the Monte Carlo method of simulation follows. Three sample simula-
tions, in the areas of inventory control, queuing, and maintenance planning, are presented. Other
simulation models besides the Monte Carlo approach are also discussed briefly. Finally, the
important role of computers in simulation is illustrated.
14.2
ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF SIMULATION
535
The explosion of personal
computers has created a wealth
of computer simulation
languages and broadened the use
of simulation. Now, even
spreadsheet software can be used
to conduct fairly complex
simulations.
14.2
Advantages and Disadvantages of Simulation
Simulation is a tool that has become widely accepted by managers for several reasons:
1. It is relatively straightforward and flexible. It can be used to compare many different
scenarios side-by-side.
2. Recent advances in software make some simulation models very easy to develop.
3. It can be used to analyze large and complex real-world situations that cannot be solved by
conventional quantitative analysis models. For example, it may not be possible to build and
solve a mathematical model of a city government system that incorporates important eco-
nomic, social, environmental, and political factors. Simulation has been used successfully
to model urban systems, hospitals, educational systems, national and state economies, and
even world food systems.
4. Simulation allows what-if? types of questions. Managers like to know in advance what op-
tions are attractive. With a computer, a manager can try out several policy decisions within
a matter of minutes.
5. Simulations do not interfere with the real-world system. It may be too disruptive, for ex-
ample, to experiment with new policies or ideas in a hospital, school, or manufacturing
plant. With simulation, experiments are done with the model, not on the system itself.
6. Simulation allows us to study the interactive effect of individual components or variables to
determine which ones are important.
7. “Time compression” is possible with simulation. The effect of ordering, advertising, or
other policies over many months or years can be obtained by computer simulation in a
short time.
8. Simulation allows for the inclusion of real-world complications that most quantitative
analysis models cannot permit. For example, some queuing models require exponential or
Poisson distributions; some inventory and network models require normality. But
simulation can use any probability distribution that the user defines; it does not require any
particular distribution.
These eight advantages of
simulation make it one of the
most widely used quantitative
analysis techniques in corporate
America.
The history of simulation goes back 5,000 years, to Chinese war
games, called weich’i. Then, in 1780, the Prussians used the
games to help train their army. Since then, all major military pow-
ers have used war games to test out military strategies under sim-
ulated environments.
From military or operational gaming, a new concept, Monte
Carlo simulation, was developed as a quantitative technique by the
great mathematician John von Neumann during World War II. Work-
ing with neutrons at the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory, von Neu-
mann used simulation to solve physics problems that were too
complex or expensive to analyze by hand or by physical model. The
random nature of the neutrons suggested the use of a roulette wheel
in dealing with probabilities. Because of the gaming nature, von Neu-
mann called it the Monte Carlo model of studying laws of chance.
With the advent and common use of business computers in
the 1950s, simulation grew as a management tool. Specialized
computer languages were developed in the 1960s (GPSS and
SIMSCRIPT) to handle large-scale problems more effectively. In the
1980s, prewritten simulation programs to handle situations rang-
ing from queuing to inventory were developed. They had such
names as Xcell, SLAM, SIMAN, Witness, and MAP/1.

CHAPTER 14 • SIMULATION MODELING
14.3
Monte Carlo Simulation
When a system contains elements that exhibit chance in their behavior, the Monte Carlo method
of simulation can be applied.
The basic idea in Monte Carlo simulation is to generate values for the variables making
up the model being studied. There are a lot of variables in real-world systems that are proba-
bilistic in nature and that we might want to simulate. A few examples of these variables follow:
1. Inventory demand on a daily or weekly basis
2. Lead time for inventory orders to arrive
3. Times between machine breakdowns
4. Times between arrivals at a service facility
5. Service times
6. Times to complete project activities
7. Number of employees absent from work each day
Some of these variables, such as the daily demand and the number of employees absent, are
discrete and must be integer valued. For example, the daily demand can be 0, 1, 2, 3, and so forth.
But daily demand cannot be 4.7362 or any other non-integer value. Other variables, such as those
related to time, are continuous and are not required to be integers because time can be any value.
When selecting a method to generate values for the random variable, this characteristic of the ran-
dom variable should be considered. Examples of both will be given in the following sections.
The basis of Monte Carlo simulation is experimentation on the chance (or probabilistic) el-
ements through random sampling. The technique breaks down into five simple steps:
Five Steps of Monte Carlo Simulation
1. Establishing probability distributions for important input variables
2. Building a cumulative probability distribution for each variable in step 1
3. Establishing an interval of random numbers for each variable
4. Generating random numbers
5. Simulating a series of trials
We will examine each of these steps and illustrate them with the following example.
Harry’s Auto Tire Example
Harry’s Auto Tire sells all types of tires, but a popular radial tire accounts for a large portion
of Harry’s overall sales. Recognizing that inventory costs can be quite significant with this product,
Harry wishes to determine a policy for managing this inventory. To see what the demand would look
like over a period of time, he wishes to simulate the daily demand for a number of days.
Step 1: Establishing Probability Distributions. One common way to establish a probability
distribution for a given variable is to examine historical outcomes. The probability, or relative
Variables we may want to
simulate abound in business
problems because very little in
life is certain.
The four disadvantages of
simulation are cost, its trial-and-
error nature, the need to
generate answers to tests, and
uniqueness.
The main disadvantages of simulation are:
1. Good simulation models for complex situations can be very expensive. It is often a long,
complicated process to develop a model. A corporate planning model, for example, may
take months or even years to develop.
2. Simulation does not generate optimal solutions to problems as do other quantitative
analysis techniques such as economic order quantity, linear programming, or PERT. It is
a trial-and-error approach that can produce different solutions in repeated runs.
3. Managers must generate all of the conditions and constraints for solutions that they want to
examine. The simulation model does not produce answers by itself.
4. Each simulation model is unique. Its solutions and inferences are not usually transferable
to other problems.

frequency, for each possible outcome of a variable is found by dividing the frequency of obser-
vation by the total number of observations. The daily demand for radial tires at Harry’s Auto
Tire over the past 200 days is shown in Table 14.1. We can convert these data to a probability
distribution, if we assume that past demand rates will hold in the future, by dividing each
demand frequency by the total demand, 200.
Probability distributions, we should note, need not be based solely on historical observa-
tions. Often, managerial estimates based on judgment and experience are used to create a dis-
tribution. Sometimes, a sample of sales, machine breakdowns, or service rates is used to
create probabilities for those variables. And the distributions themselves can be either empiri-
cal, as in Table 14.1, or based on the commonly known normal, binomial, Poisson, or expo-
nential patterns.
Step 2: Building a Cumulative Probability Distribution for Each Variable. The conversion from a
regular probability distribution, such as in the right-hand column of Table 14.1, to a cumulative
distribution is an easy job. A cumulative probability is the probability that a variable (demand) will
be less than or equal to a particular value. A cumulative  distribution lists all of the possible values
and the probabilities. In Table 14.2 we see that the cumulative probability for each level of demand
is the sum of the number in the probability column (middle column) added to the previous cumu-
lative probability (rightmost column). The cumulative probability, graphed in Figure 14.2, is used
in step 3 to help assign random numbers.
Step 3: Setting Random Number Intervals. After we have established a cumulative probabil-
ity distribution for each variable included in the simulation, we must assign a set of numbers
to represent each possible value or outcome. These are referred to as random number
intervals. Random numbers are discussed in detail in step 4. Basically, a random number
is a series of digits (say, two digits from 01, 02, ..., 98, 99, 00) that have been selected by a
totally random process.
If there is a 5% chance that demand for a product (such as Harry’s radial tires) is 0 units per
day, we want 5% of the random numbers available to correspond to a demand of 0 units. If a total of
100 two-digit numbers is used in the simulation (think of them as being numbered chips in a bowl),

To establish a probability
distribution for tires we assume
that historical demand is a good
indicator of future outcomes.

Cumulative
Probabilities for
Radial Tires
Cumulative probabilities are
found by summing all the
previous probabilities up to the
current demand.

we could assign a demand of 0 units to the first five random numbers: 01, 02, 03, 04, and 05.* Then
a simulated demand for 0 units would be created every time one of the numbers 01 to 05 was
drawn. If there is also a 10% chance that demand for the same product is 1 unit per day, we
could let the next 10 random numbers (06, 07, 08, 09, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15) represent that
demand—and so on for other demand levels.
In general, using the cumulative probability distribution computed and graphed in step 2,
we can set the interval of random numbers for each level of demand in a very simple fashion.
You will note in Table 14.3 that the interval selected to represent each possible daily demand is
very closely related to the cumulative probability on its left. The top end of each interval is
always equal to the cumulative probability percentage.
Similarly, we can see in Figure 14.2 and in Table 14.3 that the length of each interval on the
right corresponds to the probability of one of each of the possible daily demands. Hence, in as-
signing random numbers to the daily demand for three radial tires, the range of the random num-
ber interval (36 to 65) corresponds exactly to the probability (or proportion) of that outcome.
A daily demand for three radial tires occurs 30% of the time. Any of the 30 random numbers
greater than 35 up to and including 65 are assigned to that event.

Assignment of

Intervals for Harry’s

Random numbers can actually be
assigned in many different
ways—as long as they represent
the correct proportion of the
outcomes.
* Alternatively, we could have assigned the random numbers 00, 01, 02, 03, 04 to represent a demand of 0 units. The
two digits 00 can be thought of as either 0 or 100. As long as 5 numbers out of 100 are assigned to the 0 demand, it
doesn’t make any difference which 5 they are.

Step 4: Generating Random Numbers. Random numbers may be generated for simulation
problems in several ways. If the problem is very large and the process being studied involves
thousands of simulation trials, computer programs are available to generate the random numbers
needed.
If the simulation is being done by hand, as in this book, the numbers may be selected by the
spin of a roulette wheel that has 100 slots, by blindly grabbing numbered chips out of a hat, or
by any method that allows you to make a random selection.* The most commonly used means is
to choose numbers from a table of random digits such as Table 14.4.
Table 14.4 was itself generated by a computer program. It has the characteristic that every
digit or number in it has an equal chance of occurring. In a very large random number table, 10%
of digits would be 1s, 10% 2s, 10% 3s, and so on. Because everything is random, we can select
numbers from anywhere in the table to use in our simulation procedures in step 5.
Step 5: Simulating the Experiment. We can simulate outcomes of an experiment by simply
selecting random numbers from Table 14.4. Beginning anywhere in the table, we note the
interval in Table 14.4 or Figure 14.2 into which each number falls. For example, if the random
14.3
MONTE CARLO SIMULATION
539
There are several ways to pick
random numbers—random
number generators (which are a
built-in feature in spreadsheets
and many computer languages),
tables (such as Table 14.4), a
roulette wheel, and so on.
*One more method of generating random numbers is called the von Neumann midsquare method, developed in the
1940s. Here’s how it works: (1) select any arbitrary number with n digits (for example, n = 4 digits), (2) square the
number, (3) extract the middle n digits as the next random number. As an example of a four-digit arbitrary number, use
3,614. The square of 3,614 is 13,060,996. The middle four digits of this new number are 0609. Thus, 0609 is the next
random number and steps 2 and 3 are repeated. The midsquare method is simple and easily programmed, but
sometimes the numbers repeat quickly and are not random. For example, try using the method starting with 6,100 as
your first arbitrary number!

number chosen is 81 and the interval 66 to 85 represents a daily demand for four tires, we select
a demand of four tires.
We now illustrate the concept further by simulating 10 days of demand for radial tires at
Harry’s Auto Tire (see Table 14.5). We select the random numbers needed from Table 14.4,
starting in the upper left-hand corner and continuing down the first column.
It is interesting to note that the average demand of 3.9 tires in this 10-day simulation differs
significantly from the expected daily demand, which we can compute from the data in Table 14.2:
If this simulation were repeated hundreds or thousands of times, it is much more likely that the
average simulated demand would be nearly the same as the expected demand.
Naturally, it would be risky to draw any hard and fast conclusions regarding the operation
of a firm from only a short simulation. However, this simulation by hand demonstrates the

Simulated results can differ from

Simulating GM’s OnStar System to
Evaluate Strategic Alternatives
General Motors (GM) has a two-way vehicle communication
system, OnStar, that is the leader in the telematics business of
providing communications services to automobiles. Communica-
tion can be by an automated system (a virtual advisor) or with a
human advisor via a cell-phone connection. This is used for such
things as crash notification, navigation, Internet access, and traf-
fic information. OnStar answers thousands of emergency calls
each month, and many lives have been saved by providing a rapid
emergency response.
In developing the new business model for OnStar, GM used an
integrated simulation model to analyze the new telematics
industry. Six factors were considered in this model—customer
acquisition, customer choice, alliances, customer service, financial
dynamics, and societal results. The team responsible for this model
reported that an aggressive strategy would be the best way to
approach this new industry. This included installation of OnStar in
every GM vehicle and free first year subscription service. This elimi-
nated the high cost of dealer installation, but it carried with it a
cost that was not recoverable if the buyer chose not to purchase
the OnStar subscription.
The implementation of this business strategy and subsequent
growth progressed as indicated by the model. As of fall 2001,
OnStar had an 80% market share with more than two million
subscribers, and this number was growing rapidly. The OnStar
business is valued at between $4 and $10 billion.

important principles involved. It helps us to understand the process of Monte Carlo simulation
that is used in computerized simulation models.
The simulation for Harry’s Auto Tire involved only one variable. The true power of simula-
tion is seen when several random variables are involved and the situation is more complex. In
Section 14.4 we see a simulation of an inventory problem in which both the demand and the lead
time may vary.
As you might expect, the computer can be a very helpful tool in carrying out the tedious
work in larger simulation undertakings. In the next two sections, we demonstrate how QM for
Windows and Excel can both be used for simulation.
Using QM for Windows for Simulation
Program 14.1 is a Monte Carlo simulation using the QM for Windows software. Inputs to
this model are the possible values for the variable, the number of trials to be generated, and
either the associated frequency or the probability for each value. If frequencies are input, QM
for Windows will compute the probabilities as well as the cumulative probability distribu-
tion. We see that the expected value (2.95) is computed mathematically, and we can compare
the actual sample average (3.02) with this. If another simulation is performed, the sample
average may change.
Simulation with Excel Spreadsheets
The ability to generate random numbers and then “look up” these numbers in a table in order to
associate them with a specific event makes spreadsheets excellent tools for conducting simula-
tions. Program 14.2 illustrates an Excel simulation for Harry’s Auto Tire.
The 
function is used to generate a random number between 0 and 1. The
function looks up the random number in the leftmost column of the defined lookup
table 
. It moves downward through this column until it finds a cell that is bigger
than the random number. It then goes to the previous row and gets the value from column E of
the table.

often a value occurs in a set of data. This is an array function, so special procedures are required
to enter it. First, highlight the entire range where this is to be located 
.
Then enter the function, as illustrated in cell 
, and press Ctrl + Shift + Enter. This causes the
formula to be entered as an array into all the cells that were highlighted 
.
Many problems exist in which the variable to be simulated is normally distributed and thus is a
continuous variable. A function 
in Excel makes generating normal random numbers
very easy, as seen in Program 14.3. The mean is 40 and the standard deviation is 5. The format is
(probability, mean, standard_deviation)
In Program 14.3, the 200 simulated values for the normal random variable are generated in Col-
umn A. A chart (cells C3:E19) was developed to show the distribution of the randomly generated
numbers.

Defining the Problem
The U.S. Postal Service (USPS) recognizes that automation technology is the only way to handle increases
in mail volume, stay price competitive, and satisfy service goals. To do so, it needs to evaluate automation
options: (1) on other automated or semiautomated equipment, (2) on the workforce, (3) on facilities, and
(4) on other costs of operation.
Developing a Model
Kenan Systems Corporation was hired to develop a national simulation model called META (Model for
Evaluating Technology Alternatives) to quantify the effects of different automation strategies. The initial
version of META took three months to develop.
Acquiring Input Data
Data needed were collected from the USPS technology resource and delivery services departments. They
included a nationwide survey that measured 3,200 of the 150,000 city carrier routes.
Developing a Solution
Users specify inputs for the quantity and type of mail to be processed, the people/equipment used to sort
the mail, the flow of mail, and unit costs. META models how the entire nationwide mail system will func-
tion with these scenarios or inputs. META is not an optimization model; rather, it allows users to examine
changes in output that result from modifying inputs.
Testing the Solution
META’s simulations were submitted to a three-month period of testing and validation to ensure that sce-
narios run produced reliable outputs. Hundreds of META scenarios were run.
Analyizing the Results
USPS uses META to analyze the effect of rate discounts, technology changes or advances, and changes to
current processing operations.
Implementing the Results
The U.S. Postal Service estimates savings starting in 1995 at 100,000 work years annually, which translates
into more than $4 billion. The simulation model also ensures that future technologies will be implemented
in a timely and cost-effective manner.

Simulation and Inventory Analysis
Simulation is useful when
demand and lead time are
probabilistic—in this case the
inventory models like economic
order quantity (of Chapter 6)
can’t be used.
In Chapter 6, we introduced the subject of “deterministic” inventory models. These commonly
used models are based on the assumption that both product demand and reorder lead time are
known, constant values. In many real-world inventory situations, though, demand and lead time
are variables, and accurate analysis becomes extremely difficult to handle by any means other
than simulation.
In this section we present an inventory problem with two decision variables and two proba-
bilistic components. The owner of the hardware store described in the next section would like to
establish order quantity and reorder point decisions for a particular product that has probabilis-
tic (uncertain) daily demand and reorder lead time. He wants to make a series of simulation runs,
trying out various order quantities and reorder points, to minimize his total inventory cost for
the item. Inventory costs in this case include an ordering, holding, and stockout cost.
Simkin’s Hardware Store
Mark Simkin, owner and general manager of Simkin Hardware, wants to find a good, low-cost
inventory policy for one particular product: the Ace model electric drill. Due to the complexity
of this situation, he has decided to use simulation to help with this. The first step in the simula-
tion process seen in Figure 14.1 is to define the problem. Simkin specifies this to be finding a
good inventory policy for the Ace electric drill.
In the second step of this process, Simkin identifies two types of variables: the controllable
and uncontrollable inputs. The controllable inputs (or decision variables) are the order quantity
and the reorder point. Simkin must specify the values that he wishes to consider. The other im-
portant variables are the uncontrollable inputs: the fluctuating daily demand and the variable
lead time. Monte Carlo simulation is used to simulate the values for both of these.
Daily demand for the Ace model drill is relatively low but subject to some variability. Over
the past 300 days, Simkin has observed the sales shown in column 2 of Table 14.6. He converts
this historical frequency data into a probability distribution for the variable daily demand (col-
umn 3). A cumulative probability distribution is formed in column 4. Finally, Simkin establishes
an interval of random numbers to represent each possible daily demand (column 5).

546
CHAPTER 14 • SIMULATION MODELING
When Simkin places an order to replenish his inventory of Ace electric drills, there is a
delivery lag of one to three days. This means that lead time can also be considered a probabilis-
tic variable. The number of days it took to receive the past 50 orders is presented in Table 14.7.
In a fashion similar to that for the demand variable, Simkin establishes a probability distribution
for the lead time variable (column 3 of Table 14.7), computes the cumulative distribution (col-
umn 4), and assigns random number intervals for each possible time (column 5).
The third step in the simulation process is to develop the simulation model. A flow diagram,
or flowchart, is helpful in the logical coding procedures for programming this simulation process
(see Figure 14.3).
In flowcharts, special symbols are used to represent different parts of a simulation. The rec-
tangular boxes represent actions that must be taken. The diamond shaped figures represent
branching points where the next step depends on the answer to the question in the diamond. The
beginning and ending points of the simulation are represented as ovals or rounded rectangles.
The fourth step of this simulation is to specify the values of the variables that we wish to test.
The first inventory policy that Simkin Hardware wants to simulate is an order quantity of
10 with a reorder point of 5. That is, every time the on-hand inventory level at the end of the day
is 5 or less, Simkin will call his supplier and place an order for 10 more drills. If the lead time is
one day, by the way, the order will not arrive the next morning but at the beginning of the fol-
lowing working day.
The fifth step of the simulation process is to actually conduct the simulation, and the Monte
Carlo method is used for this. The entire process is simulated for a 10-day period in Table 14.8.
We can assume that beginning inventory is 10 units on day 1. (Actually, it makes little difference
in a long simulation what the initial inventory level is. Since we would tend in real life to simu-
late hundreds or thousands of days, the beginning values will tend to be averaged out.) Random
numbers for Simkin’s inventory problem are selected from the second column of Table 14.4.
Table 14.8 is filled in by proceeding one day (or line) at a time, working from left to right.
It is a four-step process:
1. Begin each simulated day by checking whether any ordered inventory has just arrived
(column 2). If it has, increase the current inventory (in column 3) by the quantity ordered
(10 units, in this case).
A delivery lag is the lead time in
receiving an order—the time it
was placed until it was received.

2. Generate a daily demand from the demand probability distribution in Table 14.6 by
selecting a random number. This random number is recorded in column 4. The demand
simulated is recorded in column 5.
3. Compute the ending inventory every day and record it in column 6. Ending inventory
equals beginning inventory minus demand. If on-hand inventory is insufficient to meet the
day’s demand, satisfy as much as possible and note the number of lost sales (in column 7).
4. Determine whether the day’s ending inventory has reached the reorder point (5 units). If it
has and if there are no outstanding orders, place an order (column 8). Lead time for a new

order is simulated by first choosing a random number from Table 14.4 and recording it in
column 9. (We can continue down the same string of the random number table that we
were using to generate numbers for the demand variable.) Finally, we convert this random
number into a lead time by using the distribution set in Table 14.7.
Analyzing Simkin’s Inventory Costs
Now that the simulation results have been generated, Simkin is ready to proceed to step 6 of this
process—examining the results. Since the objective is to find a low-cost solution, Simkin must
determine, given these results, what the costs would be. In doing this, Simkin finds some inter-
esting results. The average daily ending inventory is
We also note the average lost sales and number of orders placed per day:
These data are useful in studying the inventory costs of the policy being simulated.
Simkin Hardware is open for business 200 days per year. Simkin estimates that the cost of
placing each order for Ace drills is $10. The cost of holding a drill in stock is $6 per drill per
year, which can also be viewed as 3 cents per drill per day (over a 200-day year). Finally, Simkin
estimates that the cost of each shortage, or lost sale, is $8. What is Simkin’s total daily inventory
cost for the ordering policy of order quantity, 
and reorder point,

aThis is the first time inventory dropped below the reorder point of 5 drills. Because no prior order was outstanding, an order is placed.
bThe random number 02 is generated to represent the first lead time. It was drawn from column 2 of Table 14.4 as the next number in the list being used. A sep-
arate column could have been used to draw lead time random numbers from if we had wanted to do so, but in this example we did not do so.
cAgain, notice that the random digits 02 were used for lead time (see footnote b). So the next number in the column is 94.
dNo order is placed on day 4 because there is one outstanding from the previous day that has not yet arrived.
eThe lead time for the first order placed is one day, but as noted in the text, an order does not arrive the next morning but at the beginning of the following work-
ing day. Thus, the first order arrives at the start of day 5.
fThis is the arrival of the order placed at the close of business on day 6. Fortunately for Simkin, no lost sales occurred during the 2-day lead time until the order
arrived.
TABLE 14.8
Simkin Hardware’s First Inventory Simulation

Let us examine the three cost components:
Thus, the total daily inventory cost for this simulation is $4.72. Annualizing this daily figure to
a 200-day working year suggests that this inventory policy’s cost is approximately $944.
Now once again we want to emphasize something very important. This simulation should
be extended many more days before we draw any conclusions as to the cost of the inventory
policy being tested. If a hand simulation is being conducted, 100 days would provide a better
representation. If a computer is doing the calculations, 1,000 days would be helpful in reaching
accurate cost estimates.
Let’s say that Simkin does complete a 1,000-day simulation of the policy that order quan-
tity = 10 drills, reorder point = 5 drills. Does this complete his analysis? The answer is no—this
is just the beginning! We should now verify that the model is correct and validate that the model
truly represents the situation on which it is based. As indicated in Figure 14.1, once the results
of the model are examined, we may want to go back and modify the model that we have devel-
oped. If we are satisfied that the model performed as we expected, then we can specify other
values of the variables. Simkin must now compare this potential strategy to other possibilities.
For example, what about 
? Per-
haps every combination of values of Q from 6 to 20 drills and ROP from 3 to 10 should be sim-
ulated. After simulating all reasonable combinations of order quantities and reorder points,
Simkin would go to step 7 of the simulation process and probably select the pair that yields the
lowest total inventory cost.
Q = 10, ROP = 4; or Q = 12, ROP = 6; or Q = 14, ROP = 5
+ Daily stockout cost = $4.72
 Total Daily inventory cost = Daily order cost + Daily holding cost
= $1.60
= $8 per lost sale * 0.2 lost sales per day
* 1Average number of lost sales per day2
 Daily stockout cost = 1Cost per lost sale2

It is important to remember that
the simulation should be
conducted for many, many days
before it is legitimate to draw any
solid conclusions.
Federal Aviation Administration Uses
Simulation to Solve Assignment Problem
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is responsible for
managing transportation in the air. This typically involves the as-
signment of airline flights to particular air-traffic routes in real
time. On the surface, this problem may seem rather mundane.
However, as air traffic demand has grown in recent years, the
number of available air-traffic routes has diminished at any given
time. This can make the associated assignment problem very
hard. Confounding the problem is the weather, as thunderstorms
can wreak havoc on the availability of air-traffic routes at any
given time.
In 2005, the FAA developed a simulation decision-making
tool known as the Airspace Flow Program (AFP) at a total cost of
about $5 million. The AFP integrates upcoming and current flight
data with impending storm weather data and simulates several
different possible assignment decisions. All of these “look-ahead”
simulations are then analyzed, allowing FAA decision makers to
“pre-pick” a robust set of assignment solutions that minimize
system-wide flight delays. The result is faster, more efficient
flights for the traveler and hundreds of millions of dollars of
annual savings for the airlines.

Simulation of a Queuing Problem
An important area of simulation application has been in the analysis of waiting line problems.
As mentioned earlier, the assumptions required for solving queuing problems analytically are
quite restrictive. For most realistic queuing systems, simulation may actually be the only
approach available. This section illustrates the simulation at a large unloading dock and its asso-
ciated queue.
Port of New Orleans
Fully loaded barges arrive at night in New Orleans following their long trips down the Missis-
sippi River from industrial midwestern cities. The number of barges docking on any given night
ranges from 0 to 5. The probability of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 arrivals is displayed in Table 14.9. In the
same table, we establish cumulative probabilities and corresponding random number intervals
for each possible value.
A study by the dock superintendent reveals that because of the nature of their cargo, the
number of barges unloaded also tends to vary from day to day. The superintendent provides
information from which we can create a probability distribution for the variable daily unloading
rate (see Table 14.10). As we just did for the arrival variable, we can set up an interval of ran-
dom numbers for the unloading rates.
Barges are unloaded on a first-in, first-out basis. Any barges that are not unloaded the day
of arrival must wait until the following day. Tying up a barge in dock is an expensive proposi-
tion, and the superintendent cannot ignore the angry phone calls from barge line owners
reminding him that “time is money!” He decides that before going to the Port of New
Orleans’s controller to request additional unloading crews, a simulation study of arrivals, un-
loadings, and delays should be conducted. A 100-day simulation would be ideal, but for pur-
poses of illustration, the superintendent begins with a shorter 15-day analysis. Random
numbers are drawn from the top row of Table 14.4 to generate daily arrival rates. They are
drawn from the second row of Table 14.4 to create daily unloading rates. Table 14.11 shows
the day-by-day port simulation.
Barge arrivals and unloading
rates are both probabilistic
variables. Unless they follow the
queuing probability distributions
of Chapter 13, we must turn to a
simulation approach.

The superintendent will probably be interested in at least three useful and important pieces
of information:
When these data are analyzed in the context of delay costs, idle labor costs, and the cost of hir-
ing extra unloading crews, it will be possible for the dock superintendent and port controller to
make a better staffing decision. They may even elect to resimulate the process assuming differ-
ent unloading rates that would correspond to increased crew sizes. Although simulation is a tool
that cannot guarantee an optimal solution to problems such as this, it can be helpful in recreat-
ing a process and identifying good decision alternatives.

SIMULATION MODEL FOR A MAINTENANCE POLICY
553
Simulation is a valuable technique for analyzing various maintenance policies before actually
implementing them. A firm can decide whether to add more maintenance staff based on machine
downtime costs and costs of additional labor. It can simulate replacing parts that have not yet
failed in exploring ways to prevent future breakdowns. Many companies use computerized sim-
ulation models to decide if and when to shut down an entire plant for maintenance activities.
This section provides an example of the value of simulation in setting maintenance policy.
Three Hills Power Company
The Three Hills Power Company provides electricity to a large metropolitan area through a series
of almost 200 hydroelectric generators. Management recognizes that even a well-maintained gen-
erator will have periodic failures or breakdowns. Energy demands over the past three years have
been consistently high, and the company is concerned over downtime of generators. It currently
employs four highly skilled and highly paid ($30 per hour) repairpersons. Each works every fourth
8-hour shift. In this way there is a repairperson on duty 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
As expensive as the maintenance staff salaries are, breakdown expenses are even more
costly. For each hour that one of its generators is down, Three Hills loses approximately $75.
This amount is the charge for reserve power that Three Hills must “borrow”from the neighbor-
ing utility company.
Stephanie Robbins has been assigned to conduct a management analysis of the break down
problem. She determines that simulation is a workable tool because of the probabilistic nature
of this problem. Stephanie decides her objective is to determine (1) the service maintenance
cost, (2) the simulated machine breakdown cost, and (3) the total of these breakdown and main-
tenance costs (which gives the total cost of this system). Since the total downtime of the ma-
chines is needed to compute the breakdown cost, Stephanie must know when each machine
breaks and when each machine returns to service. Therefore, a next event step simulation model
must be used. In planning for this simulation, a flowchart, as seen in Figure 14.4, is developed.
Stephanie identifies two important maintenance system components. First, the time between
successive generator breakdowns varies historically from as little as one-half hour to as much as
three hours. For the past 100 breakdowns Stephanie tabulates the frequency of various times
between machine failures (see Table 14.12). She also creates a probability distribution and
assigns random number intervals to each expected time range.
Robbins then notes that the people who do repairs log their maintenance time in one-hour
time blocks. Because of the time it takes to reach a broken generator, repair times are generally
rounded to one, two, or three hours. In Table 14.13 she performs a statistical analysis of past
repair times, similar to that conducted for breakdown times.
Robbins begins conducting the simulation by selecting a series of random numbers to gen-
erate simulated times between generator breakdowns and a second series to simulate repair
times required. A simulation of 15 machine failures is presented in Table 14.14. We now exam-
ine the elements in the table, one column at a time.
Maintenance problems are an
area in which simulation is
widely used.

Column 1: Breakdown Number. This is just the count of breakdowns as they occur, going from 1

Column 2: Random Number for Breakdowns. This is a number used to simulate time between
breakdowns. The numbers in this column have been selected from Table 14.4, from the second
column from the right-hand side of the table.
Column 3: Time Between Breakdowns. This number is generated from column 2 random num-
bers and the random number intervals defined in Table 14.12. The first random number, 57, falls
in the interval 28 to 60, implying a time of 2 hours since the prior breakdown.
Column 4: Time of Breakdown. This converts the data in column 3 into an actual time of day for
each breakdown. This simulation assumes that the first day begins at midnight (00:00 hours).
Since the time between zero breakdowns and the first breakdown is 2 hours, the first recorded

machine failure is at 02:00 on the clock. The second breakdown, you note, occurs 1.5 hours
later, at a calculated clock time of 03:30 (or 3:30 A.M.).
Column 5: Time Repairperson Is Free to Begin Repair. This is 02:00 hours for the first breakdown
if we assume that the repairperson began work at 00:00 hours and was not tied up from a previ-
ous generator failure. Before recording this time on the second and all subsequent lines, how-
ever, we must check column 8 to see what time the repairperson finishes the previous job. Look,
for example, at the seventh breakdown. The breakdown occurs at 15:00 hours (or 3:00 P.M.). But
the repairperson does not complete the previous job, the sixth breakdown, until 16:00 hours.
Hence, the entry in column 5 is 16:00 hours.
One further assumption is made to handle the fact that each repairperson works only an
8-hour shift: When each person is replaced by the next shift, he or she simply hands the tools
over to the new worker. The new repairperson continues working on the same broken generator
until the job is completed. There is no lost time and no overlap of workers. Hence, labor costs
for each 24-hour day are exactly 
.
Column 6: Random Number for Repair Time. This is a number selected from the rightmost col-
umn of Table 14.4. It helps simulate repair times.
Column 7: Repair Time Required. This is generated from column 6’s random numbers and Table
14.13’s repair time distribution. The first random number, 07, represents a repair time of 1 hour
since it falls in the random number interval 01 to 28.
Column 8: Time Repair Ends. This is the sum of the entry in column 5 (time repairperson is free
to begin) plus the required repair time from column 7. Since the first repair begins at 02:00 and
takes one hour to complete, the time repair ends is recorded in column 8 as 03:00.

Simulating Jackson Memorial Hospital’s
Operating Rooms
Miami’s Jackson Memorial Hospital, Florida’s largest hospital,
with 1,576 inpatient beds, is also one of the finest hospitals in the
United States. In June 1996, it received the highest accreditation
score of any public-sector hospital in the country. Jackson’s
Department of Management Systems Engineering is constantly
seeking ways of increasing hospital efficiency, and the construc-
tion of new operating rooms (ORs) prompted the development of
a simulation of the existing 31 ORs.
The OR boundary includes the Holding Area and the Recov-
ery Area, both of which were experiencing problems due to inef-
fective scheduling of OR services. A simulation study, modeled
using the ARENA software package, sought to maximize the cur-
rent use of OR rooms and staff. Inputs to the model included (1)
the amount of time a patient waits in holding, (2) the specific
process the patient undergoes, (3) the staff schedule, (4) room
availability, and (5) time of day.
The first hurdle that the research team had to deal with at
Jackson was the vast number of records to scour to extract data
for the probabilistic simulation model. The second hurdle was
the quality of the data. A thorough analysis of the records deter-
mined which were good and which had to be discarded. In the
end, Jackson’s carefully screened databases led to a good set of
model inputs. The simulation model then successfully developed
five measures of OR performance: (1) number of procedures a
day, (2) average case time, (3) staff utilization, (4) room utiliza-
tion, and (5) average waiting time in the holding area.

Column 9: Number of Hours the Machine Is Down. This is the difference between column 4
(time of breakdown) and column 8 (time repair ends). In the case of the first breakdown, that
difference is 1 hour (03:00 minus 02:00). In the case of the tenth breakdown, the difference is
23:00 hours minus 19:30 hours, or 3.5 hours.
Cost Analysis of the Simulation
The simulation of 15 generator breakdowns in Table 14.14 spans a time of 34 hours of operation.
The clock began at 00:00 hours of day 1 and ran until the final repair at 10:00 hours of day 2.
The critical factor that interests Robbins is the total number of hours that generators are out
of service (from column 9). This is computed to be 44 hours. She also notes that toward the end
of the simulation period, a backlog is beginning to appear. The thirteenth breakdown occurred at
01:00 hours but could not be worked on until 04:00 hours. The fourteenth and fifteenth break-
downs experienced similar delays. Robbins is determined to write a computer program to carry
out a few hundred more simulated breakdowns but first wants to analyze the data she has col-
lected thus far.
She measures her objectives as follows:
A total cost of $4,320 is reasonable only when compared with other more attractive or less
attractive maintenance options. Should, for example, the Three Hills Power Company add a sec-
ond full-time repairperson to each shift? Should it add just one more worker and let him or her
come on duty every fourth shift to help catch up on any backlogs? These are two alternatives
that Robbins may choose to consider through simulation. You can help by solving Problem 14-25
at the end of the chapter.
As mentioned at the outset of this section, simulation can also be used in other maintenance
problems, including the analysis of preventive maintenance. Perhaps the Three Hills Power Com-
pany should consider strategies for replacing generator motors, valves, wiring, switches, and other
miscellaneous parts that typically fail. It could (1) replace all parts after a certain type when one
fails on any generator, or (2) repair or replace all parts after a certain length of service based on an
estimated average service life. This would again be done by setting probability distributions for
failure rates, selecting random numbers, and simulating past failures and their associated costs.

Simulation is one of the most widely used tools in business. As we have seen in the earlier parts
of this chapter, applications abound, as we are not restricted by the assumptions in some of the
mathematical models discussed in earlier chapters. In this section, we look at a few other issues
related to simulation, including some of the software tools available.
Two Other Types of Simulation Models
Simulation models are often broken into three categories. The first, the Monte Carlo method just
discussed, uses the concepts of probability distribution and random numbers to evaluate system
responses to various policies. The other two categories are operational gaming and systems

*Theoretically, random numbers are used only in Monte Carlo simulation. However, in some complex gaming or
systems simulation problems in which all relationships cannot be defined exactly, it may be necessary to use the proba-
bility concepts of the Monte Carlo method.

simulation. Although in theory the three methods are distinctly different, the growth of comput-
erized simulation has tended to create a common basis in procedures and blur these differences.*
OPERATIONAL GAMING Operational gaming refers to simulation involving two or more com-
peting players. The best examples are military games and business games. Both allow participants
to match their management and decision-making skills in hypothetical situations of conflict.
Military games are used worldwide to train a nation’s top military officers, to test offensive
and defensive strategies, and to examine the effectiveness of equipment and armies. Business
games, first developed by the firm Booz, Allen, and Hamilton in the 1950s, are popular with
both executives and business students. They provide an opportunity to test business skills and

*This is sometimes referred to as industrial dynamics, a term coined by Jay Forrester. Forrester’s goal was to find a way
“to show how policies, decisions, structure, and delays are interrelated to influence growth and stability” in industrial
systems. See J. W. Forrester. Industrial Dynamics (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1961).
decision-making ability in a competitive environment. The person or team that performs best in
the simulated environment is rewarded by knowing that his or her company has been most suc-
cessful in earning the largest profit, grabbing a high market share, or perhaps increasing the
firm’s trading value on the stock exchange.
During each period of competition, be it a week, month, or quarter, teams respond to mar-
ket conditions by coding their latest management decisions with respect to inventory, produc-
tion, financing, investment, marketing, and research. The competitive business environment is
simulated by computer, and a new printout summarizing current market conditions is presented
to players. This allows teams to simulate years of operating conditions in a matter of days,
weeks, or a semester.
SYSTEMS SIMULATION Systems simulation is similar to business gaming in that it allows users
to test various managerial policies and decisions to evaluate their effect on the operating envi-
ronment. This variation of simulation models the dynamics of large systems. Such systems in-
clude corporate operations,* the national economy, a hospital, or a city government system.
In a corporate operating system, sales, production levels, marketing policies, investments,
union contracts, utility rates, financing, and other factors are all related in a series of mathemati-
cal equations that are examined by simulation. In a simulation of an urban government, systems
simulation can be employed to evaluate the impact of tax increases, capital expenditures for
roads and buildings, housing availability, new garbage routes, immigration and out-migration,
locations of new schools or senior citizen centers, birth and death rates, and many more vital is-
sues. Simulations of economic systems, often called econometric models, are used by govern-
ment agencies, bankers, and large organizations to predict inflation rates, domestic and foreign
money supplies, and unemployment levels. Inputs and outputs of a typical economic system
simulation are illustrated in Figure 14.5.
The value of systems simulation lies in its allowance of what-if? questions to test the effects
of various policies. A corporate planning group, for example, can change the value of any input,
such as an advertising budget, and examine the impact on sales, market share, or short-term
costs. Simulation can also be used to evaluate different research and development projects or to
determine long-range planning horizons.
Verification and Validation
In the development of a simulation model, it is important that the model be checked to see that it
is working properly and providing a good representation of the real world situation. The
verification process involves determining that the computer model is internally consistent and
following the logic of the conceptual model.
Validation is the process of comparing a model to the real system that it represents to make
sure that it is accurate. The assumptions of the model should be checked to see that the appro-
priate probability distribution is being used. An analysis of the inputs and outputs should be
made to see that the results are reasonable. If we know what the actual outputs are for a specific
set of inputs, we could use those inputs in the computer model to see that the outputs of the sim-
ulation are consistent with the real world system.
It has been said that verification answers the question “Did we build the model right?” On
the other hand, validation answers the question “Did we build the right model?” Only after we
are convinced that the model is good should we feel comfortable in using the results.
Econometric models are huge
simulations involving thousands
of regression equations tied
together by economic factors.
They use what-if? questions to
test out various policies.
Verification relates to building
the model right. Validation
relates to building the right
model.

CHAPTER 14 • SIMULATION MODELING
Role Of Computers in Simulation
We recognize that computers are critical in simulating complex tasks. They can generate random
numbers, simulate thousands of time periods in a matter of seconds or minutes, and provide man-
agement with reports that make decision making easier. As a matter of fact, a computer approach
is almost a necessity for us to draw valid conclusions from a simulation. Because we require a
very large number of simulations, it would be a real burden to rely on pencil and paper alone.
While general-purpose programming languages can be used for simulation, some special
simulation software tools have been developed that make the simulation process much easier.
Some of these tools are Arena, ProModel, SIMUL8, ExtendSim, Proof 5, and numerous others.*
In addition to these stand-alone tools, there are several Excel add-ins, such as @Risk, Crystal
Ball, RiskSim, and XLSim, which can make simulating with Excel very easy.
Summary
The purpose of this chapter is to discuss the concept and
approach of simulation as a problem-solving tool. Simulation
involves building a mathematical model that attempts to de-
scribe a real-world situation. The model’s goal is to incorporate
important variables and their interrelationships in such a way
that we can study the impact of managerial changes on the
total system. The approach has many advantages over other
quantitative analysis techniques and is especially useful when
a problem is too complex or difficult to solve by other means.
The Monte Carlo method of simulation is developed
through the use of probability distributions and random num-
bers. Random number intervals are established to represent
possible outcomes for each probabilistic variable in the model.
Random numbers are then either selected from a random
number table or generated by computer to simulate variable
outcomes. The simulation procedure is conducted for many
time periods to evaluate the long-term impact of each policy
value being studied. Monte Carlo simulation by hand is illus-
trated on problems of inventory control, queuing, and ma-
chine maintenance.
Operational gaming and systems simulation, two other
categories of simulation, are also presented in this chapter. The
chapter concludes with a discussion of the important role of the
computer in the simulation process.

Simulating Taco Bell’s Restaurant
Operation
Determining how many employees to schedule each 15 min-
utes to perform each function in a Taco Bell restaurant is a com-
plex and vexing problem. So Taco Bell, the $5 billion giant with
6,500 U.S. and foreign locations, decided to build a simulation
model. It selected MOSDIM as its software to develop a new la-
bor-management system called LMS.
To develop and use a simulation model, Taco Bell had to collect
quite a bit of data. Almost everything that takes place in a restau-
rant, from customer arrival patterns to the time it takes to wrap a
taco, had to be translated into reliable, accurate data. Just as an ex-
ample, analysts had to conduct time studies and data analysis for
every task that is part of preparing every item on the menu. To the
researcher’s surprise, the hours devoted to collecting data greatly
exceeded those it took to actually build the LMS model.
Inputs to LMS include staffing, such as number of people and
positions. Outputs are performance measures, such as mean time
in the system, mean time at the counter, people utilization and
equipment utilization. The model paid off. More than $53 million
in labor costs were saved in the first four years of using LMS.

Read the data as in the following example for the first row:
Column 1: Number of customer.
Column 2: From third column of random number Table 14.4.
Column 3: Time interval corresponding to random number (random number of 50 implies a 2-minute interval).
Column 4: Starting at 9 A.M. the first arrival is at 9:02.
Column 5: From the first column of the random number Table 14.4.
Column 6: Teller time corresponding to random number 52 is 3 minutes.
Column 7: Teller is available and can start at 9:02.
Column 8: Teller completes work at 9:05 (9:02 + 0:03).
Column 9: Wait time for customer is 0 as the teller was available.
Column 10: Idle time for the teller was 2 minutes (9:00 to 9:02).
The drive-in window clearly does not meet the manager’s criteria for an average wait time of 2 minutes.
As a matter of fact, we can observe an increasing queue buildup after only a few customer simulations.
This observation can be confirmed by expected value calculations on both arrival and service rates.

Problems*
The problems that follow involve simulations that are to be
done by hand. You are aware that to obtain accurate and mean-
ingful results, long periods must be simulated. This is usually
handled by computer. If you are able to program some of the
problems using a spreadsheet, or QM for Windows, we suggest
that you try to do so. If not, the hand simulations will still help
you in understanding the simulation process.
14-14 Clark Property Management is responsible for the
maintenance, rental, and day-to-day operation of a
large apartment complex on the east side of New Or-
leans. George Clark is especially concerned about
the cost projections for replacing air conditioner
compressors. He would like to simulate the number
of compressor failures each year over the next 20
years. Using data from a similar apartment building
he manages in a New Orleans suburb, Clark estab-
lishes a table of relative frequency of failures during
a year as shown in the following table:

to have three or more consecutive years of operation
with two or fewer compressor failures per year?
14-15 The number of cars arriving per hour at Lundberg’s
Car Wash during the past 200 hours of operation is

distribution for the variable of car arrivals.
(b) Establish random number intervals for the
variable.

second-from-the-bottom row to generate daily un-
loading rates.
(b) How do these simulated results compare with
those in the chapter?

Historically, Eastern has never sold fewer than 2,300
programs or more than 2,700 programs at one game.
Each program costs $0.80 to produce and sells for
$2.00. Any programs that are not sold are donated to
a recycling center and do not produce any revenue.
(a) Simulate the sales of programs at 10 football
games. Use the last column in the random num-
ber table (Table 14.4) and begin at the top of the
column.
(b) If the university decided to print 2,500 programs
for each game, what would the average profits be
for the 10 games simulated in part (a)?
(c) If the university decided to print 2,600 programs
for each game, what would the average profits be
for the 10 games simulated in part (a)?
14-20 Refer to Problem 14-19. Suppose the sale of football
programs described by the probability distribution in
that problem only applies to days when the weather is
good. When poor weather occurs on the day of a foot-
ball game, the crowd that attends the game is only half
of capacity. When this occurs, the sales of programs
decreases, and the total sales are given in the follow-

DISCUSSION QUESTIONS AND PROBLEMS
567
Programs must be printed two days prior to game
day. The university is trying to establish a policy for
determining the number of programs to print based
on the weather forecast.
(a) If the forecast is for a 20% chance of bad weather,
simulate the weather for ten games with this fore-
cast. Use column 4 of Table 14.4.
(b) Simulate the demand for programs at 10 games
in which the weather is bad. Use column 5 of the
random number table (Table 14.4) and begin
with the first number in the column.
(c) Beginning with a 20% chance of bad weather
and an 80% chance of good weather, develop a
flowchart that would be used to prepare a simu-
lation of the demand for football programs for
10 games.
(d) Suppose there is a 20% chance of bad weather,
and the university has decided to print 2,500 pro-
grams. Simulate the total profits that would be
achieved for 10 football games.
14-21 Dumoor Appliance Center sells and services several
brands of major appliances. Past sales for a particu-
lar model of refrigerator have resulted in the follow-
ing probability distribution for demand:
brief simulation resulted in a total daily inventory
cost of $4.72. Simkin would now like to compare
this strategy with one in which he orders 12 drills,
with a reorder point of 6. Conduct a 10-day simula-
tion for him and discuss the cost implications.
14-24 Draw a flow diagram to represent the logic and steps
of simulating barge arrivals and unloadings at the
Port of New Orleans (see Section 14.4). For a re-
fresher in flowcharts, see Figure 14.3.
14-25 Stephanie Robbins is the Three Hills Power Com-
pany management analyst assigned to simulate
maintenance costs. In Section 14.6 we describe the
simulation of 15 generator breakdowns and the re-
pair times required when one repairperson is on duty
per shift. The total simulated maintenance cost of
the current system is $4,320.
Robbins would now like to examine the relative
cost-effectiveness of adding one more worker per
shift. The new repairperson would be paid $30 per
hour, the same rate as the first is paid. The cost per
breakdown hour is still $75. Robbins makes one
vital assumption as she begins—that repair times
with two workers will be exactly one-half the times
required with only one repairperson on duty per
shift. Table 14.13 can then be restated as follows:

Based on cost considerations as well as storage
space, the company has decided to order 10 of these
each time an order is placed. The holding cost is
$1 per week for each unit that is left in inventory at
the end of the week. The stockout cost has been set
at $40 per stockout. The company has decided to
place an order whenever there are only two refriger-
ators left at the end of the week. Simulate 10 weeks
of operation for Dumoor Appliance assuming there
are currently 5 units in inventory. Determine what
the weekly stockout cost and weekly holding cost
would be for the problem.
14-22 Repeat the simulation in Problem 14-21, assuming
that the reorder point is 4 units rather than 2. Com-
pare the costs for these two situations.
14-23 Simkin’s Hardware Store simulated an inventory

14-26 The Brennan Aircraft Division of TLN Enterprises
operates a large number of computerized plotting ma-
chines. For the most part, the plotting devices are used
to create line drawings of complex wing airfoils and
fuselage part dimensions. The engineers operating the
automated plotters are called loft lines engineers.
The computerized plotters consist of a mini-
computer system connected to a 4- by 5-foot flat
table with a series of ink pens suspended above it.
When a sheet of clear plastic or paper is properly
placed on the table, the computer directs a series of
horizontal and vertical pen movements until the de-
sired figure is drawn.

568
CHAPTER 14 • SIMULATION MODELING
The plotting machines are highly reliable, with
the exception of the four sophisticated ink pens that
are built in. The pens constantly clog and jam in a
raised or lowered position. When this occurs, the
plotter is unusable.
Currently, Brennan Aircraft replaces each pen
as it fails. The service manager has, however, pro-
posed replacing all four pens every time one fails.
This should cut down the frequency of plotter fail-
ures. At present, it takes one hour to replace one pen.
All four pens could be replaced in two hours. The to-
tal cost of a plotter being unusable is $50 per hour.
Each pen costs $8.
If only one pen is replaced each time a clog or
jam occurs, the following breakdown data are thought
to be valid:

Unfortunately, not every patient arrives exactly on
schedule, and expected times to examine patients are
just that—expected. Some examinations take longer
than expected, and some take less time.
Greenberg’s experience dictates the following:
(a) 20% of the patients will be 20 minutes early.
(b) 10% of the patients will be 10 minutes early.
(c) 40% of the patients will be on time.
(d) 25% of the patients will be 10 minutes late.
(e) 5% of the patients will be 20 minutes late.
He further estimates that
(a) 15% of the time he will finish in 20% less time
than expected.
(b) 50% of the time he will finish in the expected
time.
(c) 25% of the time he will finish in 20% more time
than expected.
(d) 10% of the time he will finish in 40% more time
than expected.
Dr. Greenberg has to leave at 12:15 P.M. on October 20
to catch a flight to a dental convention in New York.
Assuming that he is ready to start his workday at
9:30 A.M. and that patients are treated in order of
their scheduled exam (even if one late patient arrives
after an early one), will he be able to make the flight?

14-28 The Pelnor Corporation is the nation’s largest manu-
facturer of industrial-size washing machines. A
main ingredient in the production process is 8- by
10-foot sheets of stainless steel. The steel is used for
both interior washer drums and outer casings.
Steel is purchased weekly on a contractual basis
from the Smith-Layton Foundry, which, because of
limited availability and lot sizing, can ship either
8,000 or 11,000 square feet of stainless steel each
week. When Pelnor’s weekly order is placed, there
is a 45% chance that 8,000 square feet will arrive
and a 55% chance of receiving the larger size order.

DISCUSSION QUESTIONS AND PROBLEMS
569
Pelnor uses the stainless steel on a stochastic
(nonconstant) basis. The probabilities of demand
each week follow:
department where clerks check patients out and
arrange for payment or insurance forms.
The probabilities that a patient will go from one
department to another are presented in the table below:
(a) Simulate the trail followed by 10 emergency
room patients. Proceed one patient at a time
from each one’s entry at the initial exam station
until he or she leaves through out-processing.
You should be aware that a patient can enter the
same department more than once.
(b) Using your simulation data, what are the chances
that a patient enters the x-ray department twice?
14-30 Management of the First Syracuse Bank is con-
cerned about a loss of customers at its main office
downtown. One solution that has been proposed is to
add one or more drive-through teller stations to
make it easier for customers in cars to obtain quick
service without parking. Chris Carlson, the bank
president, thinks the bank should only risk the cost
of installing one drive-through. He is informed by
his staff that the cost (amortized over a 20-year pe-
riod) of building a drive-through is $12,000 per year.
It also costs $16,000 per year in wages and benefits
to staff each new teller window.
The director of management analysis, Beth
Shader, believes that the following two factors encour-
age the immediate construction of two drive-through
stations, however. According to a recent article in
Banking Research magazine, customers who wait in
long lines for drive-through teller service will cost
banks an average of $1 per minute in loss of goodwill.

Pelnor has a capacity to store no more than 25,000
square feet of steel at any time. Because of the con-
tract, orders must be placed each week regardless of
the on-hand supply.
(a) Simulate stainless steel order arrivals and use for
20 weeks. (Begin the first week with a starting
inventory of 0 stainless steel.) If an end-of-week
inventory is ever negative, assume that back or-

Case Study
Alabama Airlines 
Alabama Airlines opened its doors in June 1995 as a commuter
service with its headquarters and only hub located in Birming-
ham. A product of airline deregulation, Alabama Air joined the
growing number of successful short-haul, point-to-point air-
lines, including Lone Star, Comair, Atlantic Southeast, Sky-
west, and Business Express.
Alabama Air was started and managed by two former pi-
lots, David Douglas (who had been with the defunct Eastern
Airlines) and Savas Ozatalay (formerly with Pan Am). It ac-
quired a fleet of 12 used prop-jet planes and the airport gates va-
cated by the 1994 downsizing of Delta Air Lines.
With business growing quickly, Douglas turned his attention
to Alabama Air’s toll-free reservations system. Between midnight
and 6:00 A.M., only one telephone reservations agent had been on
duty. The time between incoming calls during this period is dis-
tributed as shown in Table 14.15. Douglas carefully observed and
timed the agent and estimated that the time taken to process pas-
senger inquiries is distributed as shown in Table 14.16.
All customers calling Alabama Air go on hold and are
served in the order of the calls unless the reservations agent is

Case Study
Statewide Development Corporation 
Statewide Development Corporation has built a very large
apartment complex in Gainesville, Florida. As part of the
student-oriented marketing strategy that has been developed, it
is stated that if any problems with plumbing or air conditioning
are experienced, a maintenance person will begin working on
the problem within one hour. If a tenant must wait more than
one hour for the repairperson to arrive, a $10 deduction from the
monthly rent will be made for each additional hour of time wait-
ing. An answering machine will take the calls and record the
time of the call if the maintenance person is busy. Past experi-
ence at other complexes has shown that during the week when
most occupants are at school, there is little difficulty in meeting
the one hour guarantee. However, it is observed that weekends
have been particularly troublesome during the summer months.
A study of the number of calls to the office on weekends
concerning air conditioning and plumbing problems has resulted
in the following distribution:
The time required to complete a service call varies according to
the difficulty of the problem. Parts needed for most repairs are
kept in a storage room at the complex. However, for certain
types of unusual problems, a trip to a local supply house is nec-
essary. If a part is available on site, the maintenance person fin-
ishes one job before checking on the next complaint. If the part
is not available on site and any other calls have been received,
the maintenance person will stop by the other apartment(s) be-
fore going to the supply house. It takes approximately one hour
to drive to the supply house, pick up a part, and return to the
apartment complex. Past records indicate that, on approxi-
mately 10% of all calls, a trip must be made to the supply
house.
The time required to resolve a problem if the part is avail-
able on site varies according to the following:

second agent should be on duty to cope with customer demand.
To maintain customer satisfaction, Alabama Air does not want
a customer on hold for more than 3 to 4 minutes and also wants
to maintain a “high” operator utilization.
Further, the airline is planning a new TV advertising cam-
paign. As a result, it expects an increase in toll-free-line phone
inquiries. Based on similar campaigns in the past, the incom-
ing call distribution from midnight to 6 A.M. is expected to be
as shown in Table 14.17. (The same service time distribution
will apply.)
Discussion Questions
1. What would you advise Alabama Air to do for the current
reservation system based on the original call distribution?
Create a simulation model to investigate the scenario.
Describe the model carefully and justify the duration of the
simulation, assumptions, and measures of performance.
2. What are your recommendations regarding operator uti-
lization and customer satisfaction if the airline proceeds
with the advertising campaign?

It takes approximately 30 minutes to diagnose difficult problems
for which parts are not on site. Once the part has been obtained
from a supply house, it takes approximately one hour to install
the new part. If any new calls have been recorded while the
maintenance person has been away picking up a new part, these
new calls will wait until the new part has been installed.

15.1
Introduction
Markov analysis is a technique that deals with the probabilities of future occurrences by ana-
lyzing presently known probabilities.1 The technique has numerous applications in business, in-
cluding market share analysis, bad debt prediction, university enrollment predictions, and
determining whether a machine will break down in the future.
Markov analysis makes the assumption that the system starts in an initial state or condi-
tion. For example, two competing manufacturers might have 40% and 60% of the market
sales, respectively, as initial states. Perhaps in two months the market shares for the two
companies will change to 45% and 55% of the market, respectively. Predicting these future
states involves knowing the system’s likelihood or probability of changing from one state to
another. For a particular problem, these probabilities can be collected and placed in a matrix
or table. This matrix of transition probabilities shows the likelihood that the system will
change from one time period to the next. This is the Markov process, and it enables us to pre-
dict future states or conditions.
Like many other quantitative techniques, Markov analysis can be studied at any level of
depth and sophistication. Fortunately, the major mathematical requirements are just that you
know how to perform basic matrix manipulations and solve several equations with several un-
knowns. If you are not familiar with these techniques, you may wish to review Module 5 (on the
Companion Website for this book) which covers matrices and other useful mathematical tools,
before you begin this chapter.
Because the level of this course prohibits a detailed study of Markov mathematics, we limit
our discussion to Markov processes that follow four assumptions:
1. There are a limited or finite number of possible states.
2. The probability of changing states remains the same over time.
3. We can predict any future state from the previous state and the matrix of transition
probabilities.
4. The size and makeup of the system (e.g., the total number of manufacturers and customers)
do not change during the analysis.
The matrix of transition
probabilities shows the likelihood
of change.
There are four assumptions of
Markov analysis.
1The founder of the concept was A. A. Markov, whose 1905 studies of the sequence of experiments connected in a
chain were used to describe the principle of Brownian motion.
15.2
States and State Probabilities
States are used to identify all possible conditions of a process or a system. For example, a ma-
chine can be in one of two states at any point in time. It can be either functioning correctly or
not functioning correctly. We can call the proper operation of the machine the first state, and we
can call the incorrect functioning the second state. Indeed, it is possible to identify specific states
for many processes or systems. If there are only three grocery stores in a small town, a resident
can be a customer of any one of the three at any point in time. Therefore, there are three states
corresponding to the three grocery stores. If students can take one of three specialties in the
management area (let’s say management science, management information systems, or general
management), each of these areas can be considered a state.
In Markov analysis we also assume that the states are both collectively exhaustive and
mutually exclusive. Collectively exhaustive means that we can list all of the possible states of a
system or process. Our discussion of Markov analysis assumes that there is a finite number of
states for any system. Mutually exclusive means that a system can be in only one state at any
point in time. A student can be in only one of the three management specialty areas and not in
two or more areas at the same time. It also means that a person can only be a customer of one of
the three grocery stores at any point in time.
574
CHAPTER 15 • MARKOV ANALYSIS
Collectively exhaustive and
mutually exclusive states are two
additional assumptions of
Markov analysis.

15.2
STATES AND STATE PROBABILITIES
575
After the states have been identified, the next step is to determine the probability that the
system is in this state. Such information is then placed into a vector of state probabilities.
(15-1)
where
In some cases, in which we are only dealing with one item, such as one machine, it is possible
to know with complete certainty what state this item is in. For example, if we are investigating
only one machine, we may know that at this point in time the machine is functioning correctly.
Then the vector of states can be represented as follows:
where
This shows that the probability the machine is functioning correctly, state 1, is 1, and the proba-
bility that the machine is functioning incorrectly, state 2, is 0 for the first period. In most cases,
however, we are dealing with more than one item.
The Vector of State Probabilities for Three Grocery Stores Example
Let’s look at the vector of states for people in the small town with the three grocery stores. There
could be a total of 100,000 people that shop at the three grocery stores during any given month.
Forty thousand people may be shopping at American Food Store, which will be called state 1.
Thirty thousand people may be shopping at Food Mart, which will be called state 2, and 30,000
people may be shopping at Atlas Foods, which will be called state 3. The probability that a per-
son will be shopping at one of these three grocery stores is as follows:
State 1—American Food Store: 
State 2—Food Mart: 
State 3—Atlas Foods: 
These probabilities can be placed in the vector of state probabilities shown as follows:
where
You should also notice that the probabilities in the vector of states for the three grocery stores rep-
resent the market shares for these three stores for the first period. Thus, American Food has 40%
of the market, Food Mart has 30%, and Atlas Foods has 30% of the market in period 1. When we
are dealing with market shares, the market shares can be used in place of probability values.
Management of these three groceries should be interested in how their market shares change
over time. Customers do not always remain with one store, but they may go to a different store
for their next purchase. In this example, a study has been performed to determine how loyal the
customers have been. It is determined that 80% of the customers who shop at American Food
Store one month will return to that store next month. However, of the other 20% of American’s
customers, 10% will switch to Food Mart, and the other 10% will switch to Atlas Foods for their
next purchase. For customers who shop this month at Food Mart, 70% will return, 10% will
switch to American Food Store, and 20% will switch to Atlas Foods. Of the customers who shop
p3 = 0.3 = probability that a person will shop at Atlas Foods, state 3
p2 = 0.3 = probability that a person will shop at Food Mart , state 2
p1 = 0.4 = probability that a person will shop at American Food, state 1
p112 = vector of state probabilities for the three grocery stores for period 1
p112 = 10.4, 0.3, 0.32
30,000>100,000 = 0.30 = 30%
30,000>100,000 = 0.30 = 30%
40,000>100,000 = 0.40 = 40%

FIGURE 15.1
Tree Diagram for Three
Grocery Stores Example
this month at Atlas Foods, 60% will return, but 20% will go to American Food Store and 20%
will switch to Food Mart.
Figure 15.1 provides a tree diagram to illustrate this situation. Notice that of the 40% mar-
ket share for American Food Store this month, 32%
will return, 4% will
shop at Food Mart, and 4% will shop at Atlas Foods. To find the market share for American next
month, we can add this 32% of returning customers to the 3% that leave Food Mart to come to
American and the 6% that leave Atlas Foods to come to American. Thus, American Food Store
will have a 41% market share next month.
Although a tree diagram and the calculations just illustrated could be used to find the state
probabilities for the next month and the month after that, the tree would soon get very large.
Rather than use a tree diagram, it is easier to use a matrix of transition probabilities. This matrix
is used along with the current state probabilities to predict the future conditions.
10.40 * 0.80 = 0.322
15.3
Matrix of Transition Probabilities
The concept that allows us to get from a current state, such as market shares, to a future state is
the matrix of transition probabilities. This is a matrix of conditional probabilities of being in a
future state given a current state. The following definition is helpful:
For example, 
is the probability of being in state 2 in the future given the event was in state 1
in the period before:
Let P

(15-2)
Individual 
values are usually determined empirically. For example, if we have observed over
time that 10% of the people currently shopping at store 1 (or state 1) will be shopping at store 2
(state 2) next period, then we know that

PREDICTING FUTURE MARKET SHARES
577
Transition Probabilities for the Three Grocery Stores
We used historical data with the three grocery stores to determine what percentage of the cus-
tomers would switch each month. We put these transitional probabilities into the following matrix:
Recall that American Food represents state 1, Food Mart is state 2, and Atlas Foods is state 3.
The meaning of these probabilities can be expressed in terms of the various states, as  follows:
Note that the three probabilities in the top row sum to 1. The probabilities for any row in a
matrix of transition probabilities will also sum to 1.
After the state probabilities have been determined along with the matrix of transition proba-
bilities, it is possible to predict future state probabilities.
 0.6 = P33 = probability of being in state 3 after being in state 3 the preceding period
 0.2 = P32 = probability of being in state 2 after being in state 3 the preceding period

Predicting Future Market Shares
One of the purposes of Markov analysis is to predict the future. Given the vector of state proba-
bilities and the matrix of transition probabilities, it is not very difficult to determine the state
probabilities at a future date. With this type of analysis, we are able to compute the probability
that a person will be shopping at one of the grocery stores in the future. Because this probability
is equivalent to market share, it is possible to determine future market shares for American Food,
Food Mart, and Atlas Foods. When the current period is 0, calculating the state probabilities for
the next period (period 1) can be accomplished as follows:
(15-3)
Furthermore, if we are in any period n, we can compute the state probabilities for period 
as follows:
(15-4)
Equation 15-3 can be used to answer the question of next period’s market shares for the grocery
stores. The computations are

Markov Analysis of Machine Operations
Paul Tolsky, owner of Tolsky Works, has recorded the operation of his milling machine for sev-
eral years. Over the past two years, 80% of the time the milling machine functioned correctly
during the current month if it had functioned correctly in the preceding month. This also means
that only 20% of the time did the machine not function correctly for a given month when it was
functioning correctly during the preceding month. In addition, it has been observed that 90% of
the time the machine remained incorrectly adjusted for any given month if it was incorrectly
adjusted the preceding month. Only 10% of the time did the machine operate correctly in a given
month when it did not operate correctly during the preceding month. In other words, this ma-
chine can correct itself when it has not been functioning correctly in the past, and this happens
10% of the time. These values can now be used to construct the matrix of transition probabili-
ties. Again, state 1 is a situation in which the machine is functioning correctly, and state 2 is a
situation in which the machine is not functioning correctly. The matrix of transition probabili-
ties for this machine is
where
= probability that the machine will be correctly functioning this month 
given it was correctly functioning last month
= probability that the machine will not be correctly functioning this month 
given it was correctly functioning last month
= probability that the machine will be functioning correctly this month

given it was not correctly functioning last month
Look at this matrix for the machine. The two probabilities in the top row are the probabilities of
functioning correctly and not functioning correctly given that the machine was functioning cor-
rectly in the last period. Because these are mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive, the
row probabilities again sum to 1.

The row probabilities must sum

As you can see, the market share for American Food and Food Mart has increased while the
market share for Atlas Foods has decreased. Will this trend continue in the next period and the
one after that? From Equation 15-4, we can derive a model that will tell us what the state proba-
bilities will be in any time period in the future. Consider two time periods from now:
Since we know that
we have
In general,
(15-5)
Thus, the state probabilities n periods in the future can be obtained from the current state proba-
bilities and the matrix of transition probabilities.
In the three grocery stores example, we saw that American Food and Food Mart had in-
creased market shares in the next period, while Atlas Food had lost market share. Will Atlas
eventually lose its entire market share? Or will all three groceries reach a stable condition?
Although Equation 15-5 provides some help in determining this, it is better to discuss this in
terms of equilibrium or steady state conditions. To help introduce the concept of equilibrium,
we present a second application of Markov analysis: machine breakdowns.
p1n2 = p102Pn
p122 = 3p1124P = 3p102P4P = p102PP = p102P2
p112 = p102P
p122 = p112P

What is the probability that Tolsky’s machine will be functioning correctly one month from
now? What is the probability that the machine will be functioning correctly in two months? To
answer these questions, we again apply Equation 15-3:
Therefore, the probability that the machine will be functioning correctly one month from now,
given that it is now functioning correctly, is 0.80. The probability that it will not be functioning
correctly in one month is 0.20. Now we can use these results to determine the probability that the
machine will be functioning correctly two months from now. The analysis is exactly the same:
This means that two months from now there is a probability of 0.66 that the machine will still be
functioning correctly. The probability that the machine will not be functioning correctly is 0.34.
Of course, we could continue this analysis as many times as we want in computing state proba-
bilities for future months.

Equilibrium Conditions
Looking at the Tolsky machine example, it is easy to think that eventually all market shares or
state probabilities will be either 0 or 1. This is usually not the case. Equilibrium share of the
market values or probabilities are normally encountered. The probabilities are called steady
state probabilities, or equilibrium probabilities.
One way to compute the equilibrium share of the market is to use Markov analysis for a
large number of periods. It is possible to see if the future values are approaching a stable value.
For example, it is possible to repeat Markov analysis for 15 periods for Tolsky’s machine. This
is not too difficult to do by hand. The results for this computation appear in Table 15.1.
The machine starts off functioning correctly (in state 1) in the first period. In period 5, there
is only a 0.4934 probability that the machine is still functioning correctly, and by period 10, this
probability is only 0.360235. In period 15, the probability that the machine is still functioning
correctly is about 0.34. The probability that the machine will be functioning correctly at a future
period is decreasing—but it is decreasing at a decreasing rate. What would you expect in the
long run? If we made these calculations for 100 periods, what would happen? Would there be an
equilibrium in this case? If the answer is yes, what would it be? Looking at Table 15.1, it ap-
pears that there will be an equilibrium at 0.333333, or 
. But how can we be sure?
By definition, an equilibrium condition exists if the state probabilities or market shares do
not change after a large number of periods. Thus, at equilibrium, the state probabilities for a
future period must be the same as the state probabilities for the current period. This fact is the
key to solving for the steady state probabilities. This relationship can be expressed as follows:
From Equation 15-4 it is always true that
or
p1n + 12 = p1n2P

Equilibrium conditions exist if
state probabilities do not change
after a large number of periods.

Equation 15-6 states that at equilibrium, the state probabilities for the next period are the same
as the state probabilities for the current period. For Tolsky’s machine, this can be expressed as

For Tolsky’s machine, we have
(d)
Now, we have three equations for the machine (a, b, and d). We know that Equation d must
hold. Thus, we can drop either Equation a or b and solve the remaining two equations for 
and 
. It is necessary to drop one of the equations so that we end up with two unknowns and
two equations. If we were solving for equilibrium conditions that involved three states, we
would end up with four equations. Again, it would be necessary to drop one of the equations so
that we end up with three equations and three unknowns. In general, when solving for equilib-
rium conditions, it will always be necessary to drop one of the equations such that the total
number of equations is the same as the total number of variables for which we are solving. The
reason that we can drop one of the equations is that they are interrelated mathematically. In
other words, one of the equations is redundant in specifying the relationships between the vari-
ous equilibrium equations.
Let us arbitrarily drop Equation a. Thus, we will be solving the following two equations:
Rearranging the first equation, we get
or
Substituting this into Equation d, we have
or
or
Thus,
Compare these results with Table 15.1. As you can see, the steady state probability for state
1 is 0.33333333, and the equilibrium state probability for state 2 is 0.66666667. These values
are what you would expect by looking at the tabled results. This analysis indicates that it is
only necessary to know the matrix of transition in determining the equilibrium market shares.
The initial values for the state probabilities or the market shares do not influence the equilib-
rium state probabilities. The analysis for determining equilibrium state probabilities or mar-
ket shares is the same when there are more states. If there are three states (as in the grocery
store example), we have to solve three equations for the three equilibrium states; if there are
four states, we have to solve four simultaneous equations for the four unknown equilibrium
values, and so on.
You may wish to prove to yourself that the equilibrium states we have just computed are,
in fact, equilibrium states. This can be done by multiplying the equilibrium states by the origi-
nal matrix of transition. The results will be the same equilibrium states. Performing this analy-
sis is also an excellent way to check your answers to end-of-chapter problems or examination
questions.

Absorbing States and the Fundamental Matrix: Accounts Receivable Application
In the examples discussed thus far, we assume that it is possible for the process or system to go
from one state to any other state between any two periods. In some cases, however, if you are in
a state, you cannot go to another state in the future. In other words, when you are in a given state,
you are “absorbed” by it, and you will remain in that state. Any state that has this property is
called an absorbing state. An example of this is the accounts receivable application.
An accounts receivable system normally places debts or receivables from its customers into
one of several categories or states depending on how overdue the oldest unpaid bill is. Of course,
the exact categories or states depend on the policy set by each company. Four typical states or
categories for an accounts receivable application follow:
State 1
: paid, all bills
State 2
: bad debt, overdue more than three months
State 3
: overdue less than one month
State 4
: overdue between one and three months

If you are in an absorbing state,
you cannot go to another state in
the future.
Defining the Problem
Finnair, a major European airline, was experiencing very low customer loyalty. The company’s numbers for
repeat business were much lower than industry averages.
Developing a Model
Analysts at IBM tackled the problem using Markov analysis to model customer behavior. Three states of
the system were identified, and each customer was listed as either (1) an occasional flyer (OF), or (2) a re-
peat purchaser (RP), or (3) a loyal customer (LC).
Acquiring Input Data
Data were collected on each customer so that transition probabilities could be developed. These probabili-
ties indicated the likelihood of a customer moving from one state to another. Most important were the
probabilities of going from OF to RP and from RP to LC.
Testing the Solution
The analysts built a tool called Customer Equity Loyalty Management (CELM). CELM tracked customer re-
sponses by customer type (OF, RP, and LC) and by the associated marketing efforts.
Analyizing the Results
The results were nothing short of astounding. By targeting its marketing efforts based upon type of cus-
tomer, Finnair was able to reduce its overall marketing costs by 20% while simultaneously increasing its
customer response rate by over 10%.
Implementing the Results
Finnair uses CELM as an integral part of its in-house frequent flyer program.

ABSORBING STATES AND THE FUNDAMENTAL MATRIX: ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE APPLICATION
583
At any given period, in this case one month, a customer can be in one of these four states.*
For this example it will be assumed that if the oldest unpaid bill is over three months due, it is
automatically placed in the bad debt category. Therefore, a customer can be paid in full (state 1),
have the oldest unpaid bill overdue less than one month (state 3), have the oldest unpaid bill
overdue between one and three months inclusive (state 4), or have the oldest unpaid bill overdue
more than three months, which is a bad debt (state 2).
As in any other Markov process, we can set up a matrix of transition probabilities for these
four states. This matrix will reflect the propensity of customers to move among the four ac-
counts receivable categories from one month to the next. The probability of being in the paid
category for any item or bill in a future month, given that a customer is in the paid category for a
purchased item this month, is 100% or 1. It is impossible for a customer to completely pay for a
product one month and to owe money on it in a future month. Another absorbing state is the bad
debts state. If a bill is not paid in three months, we are assuming that the company will com-
pletely write it off and not try to collect it in the future. Thus, once a person is in the bad debt
category, that person will remain in that category forever. For any absorbing state, the probabil-
ity that a customer will be in this state in the future is 1, and the probability that a customer will
be in any other state is 0.
These values will be placed in the matrix of transition probabilities. But before we construct
this matrix, we need to know the probabilities for the other two states—a debt of less than one
month and a debt that is between one and three months old. For a person in the less than one
month category, there is a 0.60 probability of being in the paid category, a 0 probability of being
in the bad debt category, a 0.20 probability of remaining in the less than one month category,
and a probability of 0.20 of being in the one to three month category in the next month. Note
that there is a 0 probability of being in the bad debt category the next month because it is impos-
sible to get from state 3, less than one month, to state 2, more than three months overdue, in just
one month. For a person in the one to three month category, there is a 0.40 probability of being
in the paid category, a 0.10 probability of being in the bad debt category, a 0.30 probability of
being in the less than one month category, and a 0.20 probability of remaining in the one to three
month category in the next month.
How can we get a probability of 0.30 of being in the one to three month category for one
month, and in the one month or less category in the next month? Because these categories are
determined by the oldest unpaid bill, it is possible to pay one bill that is one to three months old
and still have another bill that is one month or less old. In other words, any customer may have
more than one outstanding bill at any point in time. With this information, it is possible to con-
struct the matrix of transition probabilities of the problem.
*You should aslo be aware that the four states can be placed in any order you choose. For example. It might seem more
natural to order this problem with the states:
1. Paid
2. Overdue less than one month
3. Overdue one to three months
4. Overdue more than three months;bad debt
This is perfectly legitimate, and the only reason this ordering is not used is to facilitate some matrix manipulations you
will see shortly.
If a person is in an absorbing
state now, the probability of
being in an absorbing state in the
future is 100%.

CHAPTER 15 • MARKOV ANALYSIS
Thus,
If we know the fraction of the people in each of the four categories or states for any given
period, we can determine the fraction of the people in these four states or categories for any
future period. These fractions are placed in a vector of state probabilities and multiplied times
the matrix of transition probabilities. This procedure was described in Section 15.5.
Even more interesting are the equilibrium conditions. Of course, in the long run, everyone will
be either in the paid or bad debt category. This is because the categories are absorbing states. But
how many people, or how much money, will be in each of these categories? Knowing the total
amount of money that will be in either the paid or bad debt category will help a company manage
its bad debts and cash flow. This analysis requires the use of the fundamental matrix.
To obtain the fundamental matrix, it is necessary to partition the matrix of transition proba-
bilities, P. This can be done as follows:
(15-7)
where
I
an identity matrix (i.e., a matrix with 1s on the diagonal and 0s everyplace else)
0
a matrix with all 0s
The fundemantal matrix can be computed as follows:
(15-8)
In Equation 15-8, 
means that we subtract matrix B from matrix I. The superscript 
means that we take the inverse of the result of

mental matrix for the accounts receivable application:

where
To find the matrix F in the accounts receivable example, we first compute
With this we have
Now we are in a position to use the fundamental matrix in computing the amount of bad debt
money that we could expect in the long run. First we need to multiply the fundamental matrix,
F, times the matrix A. This is accomplished as follows:
or
The new FA matrix has an important meaning. It indicates the probability that an amount in one
of the nonabsorbing states will end up in one of the absorbing states. The top row of this
matrix indicates the probabilities that an amount in the less than one month category will end
up in the paid and the bad debt category. The probability that an amount that is less than one
month overdue will be paid is 0.97, and the probability that an amount that is less than one
month overdue will end up as a bad debt is 0.03. The second row has a similar interpretation
for the other nonabsorbing state, which is the one to three month category. Therefore, 0.86 is
the probability that an amount that is one to three months overdue will eventually be paid, and
0.14 is the probability that an amount that is one to three months overdue will never be paid
but will become a bad debt.
This matrix can be used in a number of ways. If we know the amount of the less than one
month category and the one to three month category, we can determine the amount of money
that will be paid and the amount of money that will become bad debts. We let the matrix M rep-
resent the amount of money that is in each of the nonabsorbing states as follows:
where
number of nonabsorbing states
amount in the first state or category
amount in the second state or category
amount in the nth state or category
Assume that there is $2,000 in the less than one month category and $5,000 in the one to three
month category. Then M would be represented as follows:

Amount paid and amount in bad debts = MFA
Thus, out of the total of $7,000 ($2,000 in the less than one month category and $5,000 in the
one to three month category), $6,240 will be eventually paid, and $760 will end up as bad debts.

Summary
Markov analysis can be very helpful in predicting future states.
The equilibrium conditions are determined to indicate how the
future will look if things continue as in the past. In this chapter,
the existence of absorbing states was presented, and the equi-
librium conditions were determined when one or more of these
were present also.
However, it is important to remember that the future con-
ditions found using Markov analysis are based on the assump-
tion that the transition probabilities do not change. When using
Markov analysis to predict market shares, as in the Three Gro-
cery Store example, it should be noted that companies are con-
stantly trying to change these probabilities so that their own
market shares increase. This was illustrated in the Modeling in
the Real World vignette about Finnair, which was using
Markov analysis to help measure its success in retaining cus-
tomers. When one company succeeds in changing the transi-
tion probabilities, other companies will respond and try to
move the probabilities in a direction more favorable to them.
At times, new companies enter the market and this changes the
dynamics (and probabilities) as well.
In the accounts receivable example on absorbing states, fu-
ture revenues were predicted based on existing probabilities.
However, things can certainly change due to factors that are
controllable as well as factors that are not controllable. The fi-
nancial crisis throughout the United States in 2007–2009 is a
good example of this. Some banks and other lending institu-
tions had been making loans that were less secure than the ones
they had made in the past. Many mortgages, which were reli-
able sources of income for the banks when housing prices were
rapidly rising, were becoming problematic when housing
prices began to fall. The economy as a whole was in decline,
and individuals who became unemployed were having trouble
repaying their loans. Thus, the future conditions (and revenues)
that were expected if probabilities did not change were never
realized. It is important to remember the assumptions behind
all these models.
Using Markov Analysis in the Sport of Curling
Markov analysis has been widely applied to the field of sports,
including baseball, jai alai, and now the relatively unknown but
growing sport of curling. Essentially, curling resembles shuffle-
board on ice. The game is played indoors on sheets of ice 14 feet
wide and 146 feet long. At each end is a “house,” which is four
concentric circles into which teams try to position their 45-pound
circular, polished granite “rocks.”
The strategic advantage in curling is known as “having the
hammer” (similar to having the final at-bat in baseball). The only
difference in the start of each game is which team wins the toss
and starts with the hammer. Thus, an initial Markov state will be
either 
. The likelihood of reaching different states
at the end of the game is determined by transition probability
30, 04 or 30, 14
matrices (which were obtained from 13 recent years of statistical
data recorded at the Canadian Men’s Curling Championship). Re-
searchers developed a Markov model to determine the expected
value of winning the toss in curling. They also studied which
strategies are better during a game.
Remarkably, curling was the focus of a scene during an
episode of NBC’s TV series ER. As the camera panned the hospital
hallway, a group of ER personnel scurried down the hallway curl-
ing. Curling’s first real appearance was the 2002 Winter Olympics
in Salt Lake City, Utah. Now you can closely follow this event in
future competitions to observe the value of winning the toss!

A state that, when entered, cannot be left.
The probability of going from an absorbing state to any
other state is 0.
Equilibrium Condition
A condition that exists when the
state probabilities for a future period are the same as the
state probabilities for a previous period.
Fundamental Matrix
A matrix that is the inverse of the I
minus B matrix. It is needed to compute equilibrium condi-
tions when absorbing states are involved.
Market Share
The fraction of the population that shops at a
particular store or market. When expressed as a fraction,
market shares can be used in place of state probabilities.
Markov Analysis
A type of analysis that allows us to
predict the future by using the state probabilities and the
matrix of transition probabilities.
Matrix of Transition Probabilities
A matrix containing all
transition probabilities for a certain process or system.
State Probability
The probability of an event occurring at a
point in time. Examples include the probability that a per-
son will be shopping at a given grocery store during a given
month.
Steady State Probability
A state probability when the equi-
librium condition has been reached. Also called equilibrium
probability.
Transition Probability
The conditional probability that we
will be in a future state given a current or existing state.
Vector of State Probabilities
A collection or vector of all
state probabilities for a given system or process. The vec-
tor of state probabilities could be the initial state or future
state.

Solved Problem 15-1
George Walls, president of Bradley School, is concerned about declining enrollments. Bradley School
is a technical college that specializes in training computer programmers and computer operators. Over
the years, there has been a lot of competition among Bradley School, International Technology, and
Career Academy. The three schools compete in providing education in the areas of programming, com-
puter operations, and basic secretarial skills.
To gain a better understanding of which of these schools is emerging as a leader, George decided to
conduct a survey. His survey looked at the number of students who transferred from one school to the
other during their academic careers. On the average, Bradley School was able to retain 65% of those
students it originally enrolled. Twenty percent of the students originally enrolled transferred to Career

CHAPTER 15 • MARKOV ANALYSIS
Academy, and 15% transferred to International Technology. Career Academy had the highest retention
rate: 90% of its students remained at Career Academy for their full academic program. George esti-
mated that about half the students who left Career Academy went to Bradley School, and the other half
went to International Technology. International Technology was able to retain 80% of its students after
they enrolled. Ten percent of the originally enrolled students transferred to Career Academy, and the
other 10% enrolled in Bradley School.
Currently, Bradley School has 40% of the market. Career Academy, a much newer school, has 35%
of the market. The remaining market share—25%—consists of students attending International Tech-
nology. George would like to determine the market share for Bradley for the next year. What are the
equilibrium market shares for Bradley School, International Technology, and Career Academy?
Solution
The data for this problem are summarized as follows:
State 1 initial share
0.40—Bradley School
State 2 initial share
0.35—Career Academy
State 3 initial share
0.25—International Technology

For George to determine market share for Bradley School for next year, he has to multiply the current mar-
ket shares times the matrix of transition probability. Here is the overall structure of these calculations:
Thus, the market shares for Bradley School, International Technology, and Career Academy can be
computed by multiplying the current market shares times the matrix of transition probabilities as shown.
The result will be a new matrix with three numbers, each representing the market share for one of the
schools. The detailed matrix computations follow:
Now George would like to compute the equilibrium market shares for the three schools. At equilibrium
conditions, the future market share is equal to the existing or current market share times the matrix of
transition probabilities. By letting the variable X represent various market shares for these three schools,
it is possible to develop a general relationship that will allow us to compute equilibrium market shares.

Let
At equilibrium,
The next step is to make the appropriate multiplications on the right-hand side of the equation. Doing
this will allow us to obtain three equations with the three unknown X values. In addition, we know that
the sum of the market shares for any particular period must equal 1. Thus, we are able to generate four
equations, which are now summarized:
Because we have four equations and only three unknowns, we are able to delete one of the top three
equations, which will give us three equations and three unknowns. These equations can then be solved
using standard algebraic procedures to obtain the equilibrium market share values for Bradley School,
International Technology, and Career Academy. The results of these calculations are shown in the
following table:

Central State University administers computer competency examinations every year. These exams al-
low students to “test out” of the introductory computer class held at the university. Results of the exams
can be placed in one of the following four states:
State 1: pass all of the computer exams and be exempt from the course
State 2: do not pass all of the computer exams on the third attempt and be required to take the course
State 3: fail the computer exams on the first attempt
State 4: fail the computer exams on the second attempt
The course coordinator for the exams has noticed the following matrix of transition probabilities:
Currently, there are 200 students who did not pass all of the exams on the first attempt. In addition, there
are 50 students who did not pass on the second attempt. In the long run, how many students will be ex-
empted from the course by passing the exams? How many of the 250 students will be required to take
the computer course?

The first step in determining how many students will be required to take the course and how many will be
exempt from it is to partition the transition matrix into four matrices. These are the I, 0, A, and B matrices:
The next step is to compute the fundamental matrix, which is represented by the letter F. This matrix is
determined by subtracting the B matrix from the I matrix and taking the inverse of the result:
We first find
Now multiply the F matrix by the A matrix. This step is needed to determine how many students will be
exempt from the course and how many will be required to take it. Multiplying the F matrix times the A
matrix is fairly straightforward:
The final step is to multiply the results from the FA matrix by the M matrix, as shown here:
As you can see, the MFA matrix consists of two numbers. The number of students who will be exempt
from the course is 231. The number of students who will eventually have to take the course is 19.

15-16 Hervis Rent-A-Car has three car rental locations in
the greater Houston area: the Northside branch, the
West End branch, and the Suburban branch. Cus-
tomers can rent a car at any of these places and return
it to any of the others without any additional fees.
However, this can create a problem for Hervis if too
many cars are taken to the popular Northside branch.
For planning purposes, Hervis would like to predict
where the cars will eventually be. Past data indicate
that 80% of the cars rented at the Northside branch
will be returned there, and the rest will be evenly dis-
tributed between the other two. For the West End
branch, about 70% of the cars rented there will be re-
turned there, and 20% will be returned to the North-
side branch and the rest will go to the Suburban
branch. Of the cars rented at the Suburban branch,
60% are returned there, 25% are returned to the
Northside branch, and the other 15% are dropped off
at the West End. If there are currently 100 cars being
rented from Northside, 80 from West End, and 60
from the suburban branch, how many of these will be
dropped off at each of the car rental locations?
15-17 A study of accounts receivables at the A&W Depart
ment Store indicates that bills are either current, one
month overdue, two months overdue, written off as
bad debts, or paid in full. Of those that are current,
80% are paid that month, and the rest become one
month overdue. Of the one month overdue bills,
90% are paid, and the rest become two months over-
due. Those that are two months overdue will either
be paid (85%) or be listed as bad debts. If the sales
each month average $150,000, determine how much
the company expects to receive of this amount. How
much will become bad debts?
15-18 The cellular phone industry is very competitive. Two
companies in the greater Lubbock area, Horizon and
Local Cellular, are constantly battling each other in
an attempt to control the market. Each company has
a one-year service agreement. At the end of each
year, some customers will renew, while some will
switch to the other company. Horizon customers
tend to be loyal, and 80% renew, while 20% switch.
About 70% of the Local Cellular customers renew
with them and about 30% switch to Horizon. If there
are currently 100,000 Horizon customers this year,
and 80,000 Local Cellular customers, how many
would we expect each company to have next year?
15-19 The personal computer industry is very fast moving
and technology provides motivation for customers to
upgrade with new computers every few years. Brand
loyalty is very important and companies try to do
things to keep their customers happy. However,
some current customers will switch to a different
company. Three particular brands, Doorway, Bell,
and Kumpaq, hold the major shares of the market.
People who own Doorway computers will buy an-
other Doorway in their next purchase 80% of the
time, while the rest will switch to the other compa-
nies in equal proportions. Owners of Bell computers
will buy Bell again 90% of the time, while 5% will
buy Doorway and 5% will buy Kumpaq. About 70%
of the Kumpaq owners will make Kumpaq their next
purchase while 20% will buy Doorway and the rest
will buy Bell. If each brand currently has 200,000
customers who plan to buy a new computer in the
next year, how many computers of each type will be
purchased?

15-21 Professor Green gives two-month computer pro-
gramming courses during the summer term. Students
must pass a number of exams to pass the course, and
each student is given three chances to take the exams.
The following states describe the possible situations
that could occur:
1. State 1: pass all of the exams and pass the
course
2. State 2: do not pass all of the exams by the
third attempt and flunk the course
3. State 3: fail an exam in the first attempt
4. State 4: fail an exam in the second attempt
After observing several classes, Professor Green was
able to obtain the following matrix of transition
probabilities:
At the present time, there are 50 students who did
not pass all exams on the first attempt, and there are
30 students who did not pass all remaining exams on
the second attempt. How many students in these two
groups will pass the course, and how many will fail
the course?

base. Hicourt was the most successful in keeping its
customers. Eighty percent of its customers for any
one month remained customers for the next month.
The Printing House, on the other hand, had only a
70% retention rate. Gandy Printers was in the worst
condition. Only 60% of the customers for any one
month remained with the firm. In one month, the
market share had significantly changed. This was
very exciting to George Hicourt, president of Hicourt
Industries. This month, Hicourt Industries was able
to obtain a 38% market share. The Printing House,
on the other hand, lost market share. This month, it
only had 42% of the market share. Gandy Printers re-
mained the same; it kept its 20% of the market. Just
looking at market share, George concluded that he
was able to take 8% per month away from the Print-
ing House. George estimated that in a few short
months, he could basically run the Printing House
out of business. His hope was to capture 80% of the
total market, representing his original 30% along
with the 50% share that the Printing House started
off with. Will George be able to reach his goal? What
do you think the long-term market shares will be for
these three commercial printing operations? Will
Hicourt Industries be able to run the Printing House
completely out of business?

has also learned that Cleanco has kept 80% of its
current customers. He also knows that Beach Ser-
vices will keep at least 50% of its customers. For
John to get the loan from Bay Bank, he needs to
show the loan officer that he will maintain an ade-
quate share of the market. The officers of Bay Bank
are concerned about the recent trends for market
share, and they have decided not to give John a loan
unless he will keep at least 35% of the market share
in the long run. What types of equilibrium market
shares can John expect? If you were an officer of
Bay Bank, would you give John a loan?
15-24 Set up both the vector of state probabilities and the
matrix of transition probabilities given the following
information:
Store 1 currently has 40% of the market; store 2
currently has 60% of the market.
In each period, store 1 customers have an 80%
chance of returning; 20% of switching to store 2.
In each period, store 2 customers have a 90%
chance of returning; 10% of switching to store 1.
15-25 Find 
for Problem 15-24.
15-26 Find the equilibrium conditions for Problem 15-24.
Explain what it means.
15-27 As a result of a recent survey of students at the Uni-
versity of South Wisconsin, it was determined that
the university owned bookstore currently has 40% of
the market. (See Problem 15-14.) The other three
bookstores, Bill’s, College, and Battle’s, each split
the remaining initial market share. Given that the
state probabilities are the same, what is the market
share for the next period given the initial market
shares? What impact do the initial market shares
have on each store next period? What is the impact
on the steady state market shares?
15-28 Sandy Sprunger is part owner in one of the largest
quick-oil-change operations for a medium-sized city
in the Midwest. Currently, the firm has 60% of the
market. There are a total of 10 quick lubrication
shops in the area. After performing some basic mar-
keting research, Sandy has been able to capture the
initial probabilities, or market shares, along with the
matrix of transition, which represents probabilities
that customers will switch from one quick lubrica-
tion shop to another. These values are shown in the
table on the next page:
Initial probabilities, or market share, for shops 1
through 10 are 0.6, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.05, 0.01, 0.01,
0.01, 0.01, and 0.01.
(a) Given these data, determine market shares for
the next period for each of the 10 shops.
(b) What are the equilibrium market shares?
(c) Sandy believes that the original estimates for
market shares were wrong. She believes that
shop 1 has 40% of the market, and shop 2 has
30%. All other values are the same. If this is the
case, what is the impact on market shares for
next-period and equilibrium shares?
(d) A marketing consultant believes that shop 1 has
tremendous appeal. She believes that this shop will
retain 99% of its current market share; 1% may
switch to shop 2. If the consultant is correct, will
shop 1 have 90% of the market in the long run?
15-29 During a recent trip to her favorite restaurant, Sandy
(owner of shop 1) met Chris Talley (owner of shop
7) (see Problem 15-28). After an enjoyable lunch,

Sandy and Chris had a heated discussion about mar-
ket share for the quick-oil-change operations in their
city. Here is their conversation:
Sandy: My operation is so superior that after some-
one changes oil at one of my shops, they will never
do business with anyone else. On second thought,
maybe 1 person out of 100 will try your shop after
visiting one of my shops. In a month, I will have 99%
of the market, and you will have 1% of the market.
Chris: You have it completely reversed. In a month,
I will have 99% of the market, and you will only
have 1% of the market. In fact, I will treat you to a
meal at a restaurant of your choice if you are right.
If I am right, you will treat me to one of those big
steaks at David’s Steak House. Do we have a deal?
Sandy: Yes! Get your checkbook or your credit card.
You will have the privilege of paying for two very
expensive meals at Anthony’s Seafood Restaurant.
(a) Assume that Sandy is correct about customers
visiting one of her quick-oil-change shops. Will
she win the bet with Chris?
(b) Assume that Chris is correct about customers
visiting one of his quick-oil-change shops. Will
he win the bet?
(c) Describe what would happen if both Sandy and
Chris are correct about customers visiting their
quick-oil-change operations.
15-30 The first quick-oil-change store in Problem 15-28
retains 73% of its market share. This represents a
probability of 0.73 in the first row and first column
of the matrix of transition probabilities. The other
probability values in the first row are equally distrib-
uted across the other stores (namely, 3% each).
What impact does this have on the steady-state mar-
ket shares for the quick-oil-change stores?
Case Study
Rentall Trucks
Jim Fox, an executive for Rentall Trucks, could not believe it.
He had hired one of the town’s best law firms, Folley, Smith,
and Christensen. Their fee for drawing up the legal contracts
was over $50,000. Folley, Smith, and Christensen had made
one important omission from the contracts, and this blunder
would more than likely cost Rentall Trucks millions of dollars.

Internet Homework Problems
For the hundredth time, Jim carefully reconstructed the situa-
tion and pondered the inevitable.
Rentall Trucks was started by Robert (Bob) Renton more
than 10 years ago. It specialized in renting trucks to businesses
and private individuals. The company prospered, and Bob in-
creased his net worth by millions of dollars. Bob was a legend

596
CHAPTER 15 • MARKOV ANALYSIS
in the rental business and was known all over the world for his
keen business abilities.
Only a year and a half ago, some of the executives of
Rentall and some additional outside investors offered to buy
Rentall from Bob. Bob was close to retirement, and the offer
was unbelievable. His children and their children would be able
to live in high style off the proceeds of the sale. Folley, Smith,
and Christensen developed the contracts for the executives of
Rentall and other investors, and the sale was made.
Being a perfectionist, it was only a matter of time until Bob
was marching down to the Rentall headquarters, telling every-
one the mistakes that Rentall was making and how to solve
some of their problems. Pete Rosen, president of Rentall, be-
came extremely angry about Bob’s constant interference, and in
a brief 10-minute meeting, Pete told Bob never to enter the
Rentall offices again. It was at this time that Bob decided to
reread the contracts, and it was also at this time that Bob and his
lawyer discovered that there was no clause in the contracts that
prevented Bob from competing directly with Rentall.
The brief 10-minute meeting with Pete Rosen was the be-
ginning of Rentran. In less than six months, Bob Renton had
lured some of the key executives away from Rentall and into his
new business, Rentran, which would compete directly with
Rentall Trucks in every way. After a few months of operation,
Bob estimated that Rentran had about 5% of the total national
market for truck rentals. Rentall had about 80% of the market,
and another company, National Rentals, had the remaining 15%
of the market.
Rentall’s Jim Fox was in total shock. In a few months, Ren-
tran had already captured 5% of the total market. At this rate,
Rentran might completely dominate the market in a few short
years. Pete Rosen even wondered if Rentall could maintain 50%
of the market in the long run. As a result of these concerns, Pete
hired a marketing research firm that analyzed a random sample
of truck rental customers. The sample consisted of 1,000 exist-
ing or potential customers. The marketing research firm was
very careful to make sure that the sample represented the true
market conditions. The sample, taken in August, consisted of
800 customers of Rentall, 60 customers of Rentran, and the
remainder National customers. The same sample was then ana-
lyzed the next month concerning the customers’ propensity to
switch companies. Of the original Rentall customers, 200
switched to Rentran, and 80 switched to National. Rentran was
able to retain 51 of their original customers. Three customers
switched to Rentall, and 6 customers switched to National.
Finally, 14 customers switched from National to Rentall, and
35 customers switched from National to Rentran.
The board of directors meeting was only two weeks away,
and there would be some difficult questions to answer–what
happened, and what can be done about Rentran? In Jim Fox’s
opinion, nothing could be done about the costly omission made
by Folley, Smith, and Christensen. The only solution was to
take immediate corrective action that would curb Rentran’s abil-
ity to lure customers away from Rentall.
After a careful analysis of Rentran, Rentall, and the truck
rental business in general, Jim concluded that immediate changes
would be needed in three areas: rental policy, advertising, and
product line. Regarding rental policy, a number of changes were
needed to make truck rental both easier and faster. Rentall could
implement many of the techniques used by Hertz and other car
rental agencies. In addition, changes in the product line were
needed. Rentall’s smaller trucks had to be more comfortable and
easier to drive. Automatic transmission, comfortable bucket seats,
air conditioners, quality radio and tape stereo systems, and cruise
control should be included. Although expensive and difficult to
maintain, these items could make a significant difference in mar-
ket shares. Finally, Jim knew that additional advertising was
needed. The advertising had to be immediate and aggressive.
Television and journal advertising had to be increased, and a good
advertising company was needed. If these new changes were
implemented now, there would be a good chance that Rentall
would be able to maintain close to its 80% of the market. To con-
firm Jim’s perceptions, the same marketing research firm was
employed to analyze the effect of these changes, using the same
sample of 1,000 customers.
The marketing research firm, Meyers Marketing Research,
Inc., performed a pilot test on the sample of 1,000 customers.
The results of the analysis revealed that Rentall would only lose
100 of its original customers to Rentran and 20 to National if
the new policies were implemented. In addition, Rentall would
pick up customers from both Rentran and National. It was esti-
mated that Rentall would now get 9 customers from Rentran
and 28 customers from National.
Discussion Questions
1. What will the market shares be in one month if these
changes are made? If no changes are made?
2. What will the market shares be in three months with the
changes?
3. If market conditions remain the same, what market share
would Rentall have in the long run? How does this com-
pare with the market share that would result if the
changes were not made?

Markov Analysis With Excel
Performing the Markov analysis matrix operations is very easy with Excel, although the input
process is different from most Excel operations. The two Excel functions that are most helpful
with matrices are MMULT for matrix multiplication and MINVERSE for finding the inverse of
the matrix. However, special procedures are used when these are entered in the spreadsheet.
Matrix addition and subtraction is also easy in Excel using special procedures.
Using Excel to Predict Future Market Shares
In using Markov analysis to predict future market shares or future states, matrices are multiplied.
To multiply matrices in Excel, we use MMULT as follows:
1. Highlight all the cells that will contain the resulting matrix.
2. Type =MMULT(matrix1, matrix2), where matrix 1 and matrix 2 are the cell ranges for the
two matrices being multiplied.
3. Instead of just pressing Enter, hold down the Ctrl and Shift keys and then press Enter.
Pressing Ctrl+Shift+Enter is used to indicate that a matrix operation is being performed so that
all cells in the matrix are changed accordingly.
Program 15.3A shows the formulas for the three grocery example from Section 15.2. We
have entered the time period in column A for reference only, as we will be computing the state
probabilities through time period 6. The state probabilities (cells B6 through D6) and the ma-
trix of transition probabilities (cells E6 through G8) are entered as shown. We then use matrix
multiplication to find the state probabilities for the next period. Highlight cells B7, C7, and
D7 (this is where the resulting matrix will be) and type =MMULT(B6:D6,E6:G8), as shown
in the table. Then press Ctrl+Shift+Enter (all at one time), and this formula is put in each of
the three cells that were highlighted. When you have done this, Excel places { } around this
formula in the box at the top of the screen. We then copy cells B7, C7, and D7 to rows 8
through 12 as shown. Program 15.3B shows the result and the state probabilities for the next
six time periods.
The future state probabilities
are in rows 7 to 12.

transition probabilities.

CHAPTER 16 • STATISTICAL QUALITY CONTROL
16.1
Introduction
For almost every product or service, there is more than one organization trying to make a sale.
Price may be a major issue in whether a sale is made or lost, but another factor is quality. In fact,
quality is often the major issue; and poor quality can be very expensive for both the producing
firm and the customer.
Consequently, firms employ quality management tactics. Quality management, or as it is
more commonly called, quality control (QC), is critical throughout the organization. One of the
manager’s major roles is to ensure that his or her firm can deliver a quality product at the right
place, at the right time, and at the right price. Quality is not just of concern for manufactured
products either; it is also important in services, from banking to hospital care to education.
We begin this chapter with an attempt to define just what quality really is. Then we deal
with the most important statistical methodology for quality management: statistical process con-
trol (SPC). SPC is the application of the statistical tools we discussed in Chapter 2 to the control
of processes that result in products or services.
Statistical process control uses
statistical and probability tools to
help control processes and
produce consistent goods and
services.
16.2
Defining Quality and TQM
To some people, a high-quality product is one that is stronger, will last longer, is built heavier,
and is, in general, more durable than other products. In some cases this is a good definition of a
quality product, but not always. A good circuit breaker, for example, is not one that lasts longer
during periods of high current or voltage. So the quality of a product or service is the degree to
which the product or service meets specifications. Increasingly, definitions of quality include an
added emphasis on meeting the customer’s needs. As you can see in Table 16.1, the first and sec-
ond ones are similar to our definition.
Total quality management (TQM) refers to a quality emphasis that encompasses the entire
organization, from supplier to customer. TQM emphasizes a commitment by management to have
a companywide drive toward excellence in all aspects of the products and services that are impor-
tant to the customer. Meeting the customer’s expectations requires an emphasis on TQM if the
firm is to compete as a leader in world markets.
This emphasis on quality means that the company will seek continuous improvement in
every aspect of the delivery of products and services.
The quality of a product or
service is the degree to which the
product or service meets
specifications.
Total quality management
encompasses the whole
organization.

STATISCAL PROCESS CONTROL
603
In the early nineteenth century an individual skilled artisan
started and finished a whole product. With the Industrial Revolu-
tion and the factory system, semiskilled workers, each making a
small portion of the final product, became common. With this,
responsibility for the quality of the final product tended to shift to
supervisors, and pride of workmanship declined.
As organizations became larger in the twentieth century,
inspection became more technical and organized. Inspectors were
often grouped together; their job was to make sure that bad lots
were not shipped to customers. Starting in the 1920s, major statis-
tical QC tools were developed. W. Shewhart introduced control
charts in 1924, and in 1930, H. F. Dodge and H. G. Romig designed
acceptance sampling tables. Also at that time the important role of
QC in all areas of the company’s performance became recognized.
During and after World War II, the importance of quality
grew, often with the encouragement of the U.S. government.
Companies recognized that more than just inspection was
needed to make a quality product. Quality needed to be built into
the production process.
After World War II, an American, W. Edwards Deming, went
to Japan to teach statistical QC concepts to the devastated Japan-
ese manufacturing sector. A second pioneer, J. M. Juran, followed
Deming to Japan, stressing top management support and involve-
ment in the quality battle. In 1961 A. V. Feigenbaum wrote his
classic book Total Quality Control, which delivered a fundamental
message: Make it right the first time! In 1979, Philip Crosby pub-
lished Quality Is Free, stressing the need for management and
employee commitment to the battle against poor quality. In 1988,
the U.S. government presented its first awards for quality
achievement. These are known as the Malcolm Baldrige National
Quality Awards.
A method of quality management called Six Sigma was de-
veloped in the electronics industry. The goal of Six Sigma is con-
tinuous improvement in performance to reduce and eliminate
defects. Technically, to achieve Six Sigma quality, there would
have to be fewer than 3.4 defects per million opportunities. This
approach to quality has been credited with achieving significant
cost savings for a number of companies. General Electric esti-
mated savings of $12 billion over a 5-year period, and other firms
have reported savings in the hundreds of millions of dollars.
Today, companies strive to be ISO 9000 certified as this is an
international quality standard that is recognized worldwide. ISO
9000 was developed by the International Organization for Stan-
dardization (ISO), the world’s largest developer and publisher of
international standards.
HISTORY
How Quality Control Has Evolved
16.3
Statiscal Process Control
Statistical process control involves establishing standards, monitoring standards, making meas-
urements, and taking corrective action as a product or service is being produced. Samples of
process outputs are examined; if they are within acceptable limits, the process is permitted to
continue. If they fall outside certain specific ranges, the process is stopped and, typically, the as-
signable cause is located and removed.
Control charts are graphs that show upper and lower limits for the process we want to con-
trol. A control chart is a graphic presentation of data over time. Control charts are constructed
in such a way that new data can quickly be compared with past performance. Upper and lower
limits in a control chart can be in units of temperature, pressure, weight, length, and so on. We
take samples of the process output and plot the averages of these samples on a chart that has the
limits on it.
Figure 16.1 graphically reveals the useful information that can be portrayed in control
charts. When the averages of the samples fall within the upper and lower control limits and no
discernible pattern is present, the process is said to be in control; otherwise, the process is out of
control or out of adjustment.
Variability in the Process
All processes are subject to a certain degree of variability. Walter Shewhart of Bell Laboratories,
while studying process data in the 1920s, made the distinction between the common and special
causes of variation. The key is keeping variations under control. So we now look at how to build
control charts that help managers and workers develop a process that is capable of producing
within established limits.
BUILDING CONTROL CHARTS When building control charts, averages of small samples (often of
five items or parts) are used, as opposed to data on individual parts. Individual pieces tend to be
too erratic to make trends quickly visible. The purpose of control charts is to help distinguish
between natural variations and variations due to assignable causes.
Statistical process control helps
set standards. It can also
monitor, measure, and correct
quality problems.
A control chart is a graphic way
of presenting data over time.

NATURAL VARIATIONS Natural variations affect almost every production process and are to be
expected. These variations are random and uncontrollable. Natural variations are the many
sources of variation within a process that is in statistical control. They behave like a constant
system of chance causes. Although individual measured values are all different, as a group they

Bank of America Uses Statistics to
Combat Pecuniary Corruption
Banks and similar financial institutions have good reason to
help law enforcement fight fiscal improprieties. Debit card fraud
alone costs the banking industry over $2.75 billion annually! In
their fight against fraud, analysts at Bank of America use statisti-
cal outlier analysis to help detect suspicious fiscal activities. Bank
of America specifically targets money laundering and retail bank-
ing fraud in its analysis. The company tracks characteristics such
as where, when, and how much money is involved in each trans-
action for every customer. Then it performs statistical analyses to
see if the activity falls within usual activity boundaries for that
particular customer. For you as a customer, that means nothing
more than that the bank knows how much money you typically
withdraw from an ATM and which ATM you normally use.
The bank analysts are on the lookout for outliers, which are
unusual events that have a very small probability of occurring. For
example, if you normally use one particular ATM and then use a
different ATM, the transaction at the unusual location may raise a
small flag, but the transaction would likely proceed without inter-
ference. However, if you try to cash a very large third-party check
at an out-of-state location, several flags will be raised, as this is
very unusual behavior for you. The teller may require several
forms of identification and then get approval from the branch
manager before completing the transaction.

IN ACTION
Natural variations are sources of
variation in a process that is
statistically in control.

CONTROL CHARTS FOR VARIABLES

form a pattern that can be described as a distribution. When these distributions are normal, they
are characterized by two parameters:
1. Mean,  (the measure of central tendency, in this case, the average value)
2. Standard deviation,  (variation, the amount by which the smaller values differ from the
larger ones)
As long as the distribution (output precision) remains within specified limits, the process is said
to be “in control,” and the modest variations are tolerated.
ASSIGNABLE VARIATIONS When a process is not in control, we must detect and eliminate spe-
cial (assignable) causes of variation. These variations are not random and can be controlled
when the cause of the variation is determined. Factors such as machine wear, misadjusted equip-
ment, fatigued or untrained workers, or new batches of raw material are all potential sources of
assignable variations. Control charts such as those illustrated in Figure 16.1 help the manager
pinpoint where a problem may lie.
The ability of a process to operate within statistical control is determined by the total varia-
tion that comes from natural causes—the minimum variation that can be achieved after all
assignable causes have been eliminated. The objective of a process control system, then, is to
provide a statistical signal when assignable causes of variation are present. Such a signal can
quicken appropriate action to eliminate assignable causes.
Assignable variations in a
process can be traced to a
specific problem.
16.4
Control Charts for Variables
Control charts for the mean, , and the range, R, are used to monitor processes that are meas-
ured in continuous units. Examples of these would be weight, height, and volume. The -chart
(x-bar chart) tells us whether changes have occurred in the central tendency of a process. This
might be due to such factors as tool wear, a gradual increase in temperature, a different method
used on the second shift, or new and stronger materials. The R-chart values indicate that a gain
or loss in uniformity has occurred. Such a change might be due to worn bearings, a loose tool
part, an erratic flow of lubricants to a machine, or sloppiness on the part of a machine operator.
The two types of charts go hand in hand when monitoring variables.
The Central Limit Theorem
The statistical foundation for -charts is the central limit theorem. In general terms, this theo-
rem states that regardless of the distribution of the population of all parts or services, the distri-
bution of ’s (each of which is a mean of a sample drawn from the population) will tend to
follow a normal curve as the sample size grows large. Fortunately, even if n is fairly small (say 4
or 5), the distributions of the averages will still roughly follow a normal curve. The theorem also
states that (1) the mean of the distribution of the ’s (called 
) will equal the mean of the over-
all population (called μ); and (2) the standard deviation of the sampling distribution, 
, will be
the population deviation, 
, divided by the square root of the sample size, n. In other words,
Although there may be times when we may know 
(and ), often we must estimate this with
the average of all the sample means (written as ).
Figure 16.2 shows three possible population distributions, each with its own mean, μ, and
standard deviation, 
. If a series of random samples (
, and so on) each of size n is
drawn from any one of these, the resulting distribution of s will appear as in the bottom graph
of that figure. Because this is a normal distribution (as discussed in Chapter 2), we can state that
1. 99.7% of the time, the sample averages will fall within 
of the population mean if the
process has only random variations.
2. 95.5% of the time, the sample averages will fall within 
of the population mean if the
process has only random variations.
If a point on the control chart falls outside the 
control limits, we are 99.7% sure that
the process has changed. This is the theory behind control charts.

every hour. To set control limits that include 99.7% of the sample means, 36 boxes are randomly
selected and weighed. The standard deviation of the overall population of boxes is estimated,
through analysis of old records, to be 2 ounces. The average mean of all samples taken is
16 ounces. We therefore have

Defining the Problem
AVX-Kyocera, a Japanese-owned maker of electronic chip components located in Raleigh, North Carolina,
needed to improve the quality of its products and services to achieve total customer satisfaction.
Developing a Model
Statistical process control models such as - and R-charts were chosen as appropriate tools.
Acquiring Input Data
Employees are empowered to collect their own data. For example, a casting machine operator measures
the thickness of periodic samples that he takes from his process.
Developing a Solution
Employees plot data observations to generate SPC charts that track trends, comparing results with process
limits and final customer specifications.
Testing the Solution
Samples at each machine are evaluated to ensure that the processes are indeed capable of achieving the
desired results. Quality control inspectors are transferred to manufacturing duties as all plant personnel
become trained in statistical methodology.
Analyzing the Results
Results of SPC are analyzed by individual operators to see if trends are present in their processes. Quality
trend boards are posted in the building to display not only SPC charts, but also procedures, process docu-
ment change approvals, and the names of all certified operators. Work teams are in charge of analysis of
clusters of machines.
Implementing the Results
The firm has implemented a policy of zero defectives at a very low tolerance for variable data and nearly
zero defects for parts per million for attribute data.

all process average of 16.01 ounces has been found by taking several batches of samples, in
which each sample contained five bottles. The average range of the process is 0.25 ounce. We

Setting Range Chart Limits
We just determined the upper and lower control limits for the process average. In addition to
being concerned with the process average, managers are interested in the dispersion or
variability. Even though the process average is under control, the variability of the process may
not be. For example, something may have worked itself loose in a piece of equipment. As a re-
sult, the average of the samples may remain the same, but the variation within the samples could
be entirely too large. For this reason it is very common to find a control chart for ranges in order
to monitor the process variability. The theory behind the control charts for ranges is the same for
the process average. Limits are established that contain 
standard deviations of the distribu-
tion for the average range . With a few simplifying assumptions, we can set the upper and
lower control limits for ranges:

Five Steps to Follow in using 
and R-Charts
1. Collect 20 to 25 samples of 
each from a stable process and compute the
mean and range of each.
2. Compute the overall means 
and 
, set appropriate control limits, usually at the 99.7%
level, and calculate the preliminary upper and lower control limits. If the process is not cur-
rently stable, use the desired mean, , instead of 
to calculate limits.
3. Graph the sample means and ranges on their respective control charts and determine
whether they fall outside the acceptable limits.
4. Investigate points or patterns that indicate the process is out of control. Try to assign causes
for the variation and then resume the process.
5. Collect additional samples and, if necessary, revalidate the control limits using the new data.

Control Charts for Attributes
Control charts for 
and R do not apply when we are sampling attributes, which are typically
classified as defective or nondefective. Measuring defectives involves counting them (e.g., num-
ber of bad lightbulbs in a given lot, or number of letters or data entry records typed with errors).
There are two kinds of attribute control charts: (1) those that measure the percent defective in a
sample, called p-charts and (2) those that count the number of defects, called c-charts.
p-Charts
p-charts are the principal means of controlling attributes. Although attributes that are either
good or bad follow the binomial distribution, the normal distribution can be used to calculate
p-chart limits when sample sizes are large. The procedure resembles the -chart approach,
which is also based on the central limit theorem.
The formulas for p-chart upper and lower control limits follow:

ARCO p-CHART EXAMPLE Using a popular database software package, data-entry clerks at ARCO
key in thousands of insurance records each day. Samples of the work of 20 clerks are shown in the
following table. One hundred records entered by each clerk were carefully examined to determine
if they contained any errors; the fraction defective in each sample was then computed.
Unisys Corp.’s Costly Experiment in Health
Care Services
In January 1996 things looked rosy for Unisys Corp.’s expansion
into the computerized health care service business. It had just
beat out Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Florida for an $86 million con-
tract to serve Florida’s state employee health insurance services.
Its job was to handle the 215,000 Florida employees’ claims
processing—a seemingly simple and lucrative growth area for an
old-line computer company like Unisys.
But one year later the contract was not only torn up, Unisys
was fined over $500,000 for not meeting quality standards. Here
are two of the measures of quality, both attributes (that is, either
“defective” or “not defective”) on which the firm was out of
control:
1. Percentage of claims processed with errors. An audit
over a 3 month period, by Coopers and Lybrand, found
that Unysis made errors in 8.5% of claims processed. The
industry standard is 3.5% “defectives.”
2. Percentage of claims processed within 30 days. For
this attribute measure, a “defect” is a processing time
longer than the contract’s time allowance. In one month’s
sample, 13% of the claims exceed the 30-day limit, far
above the 5% allowed by the state of Florida.
The Florida contract was a migraine for Unisys, which underesti-
mated the labor-intensiveness of health claims. Chief executive
officer James Unruh pulled the plug on future ambitions in health
care. Meanwhile, the state of Florida’s Ron Poppel says, “We re-
ally need somebody that’s in the insurance business.”

CONTROL CHARTS FOR ATTRIBUTES
613
c-Charts
In the ARCO example discussed previously, we counted the number of defective database
records entered. A defective record is one that was not exactly correct. A bad record may con-
tain more than one defect, however. We use c-charts to control the number of defects per unit of
output (or per insurance record in this case).
Control charts for defects are helpful for monitoring processes in which a large number of
potential errors can occur but the actual number that do occur is relatively small. Defects may
be mistyped words in a newspaper, blemishes on a table, or missing pickles on a fast-food ham-
burger.
The Poisson probability distribution, which has a variance equal to its mean, is the basis for
c-charts. Since is the mean number of defects per unit, the standard deviation is equal to 
.
To compute 99.7% control limits for c, we use the formula
(16-10)
Here is an example.
RED TOP CAB COMPANY c-CHART EXAMPLE Red Top Cab Company receives several complaints
per day about the behavior of its drivers. Over a nine-day period (in which days are the units of
measure), the owner received the following number of calls from irate passengers: 3, 0, 8, 9, 6,
7, 4, 9, 8, for a total of 54 complaints.
To compute 99.7% control limits, we take
Thus,
(because we cannot have a negative control limit)
After the owner plotted a control chart summarizing these data and posted it prominently in the
drivers’ locker room, the number of calls received dropped to an average of 3 per day. Can you
explain why this may have occurred?
USING EXCEL QM FOR c-CHARTS Excel QM can be used to develop the limits for a c-chart,
determine which samples exceed the limits, and develop the graph. Program 16.4 provides the
output for the Red Top Cab Company example, with the graph. To use Excel QM, from the Add-
Ins tab select Excel QM. From the drop-down menu, select Quality Control and specify the c
Charts option. Enter the number of samples (9 days, in this example), input a title if desired, and
select Graph if you wish to view the c-chart. When the spreadsheet is initialized, enter the num-
ber of complaints (i.e., defects) in each of the 9 samples.
 LCLc = c - 32c = 6 - 326 = 6 - 312.452 = 0

CHAPTER 16 • STATISTICAL QUALITY CONTROL
Summary
To the manager of a firm producing goods or services, quality
is the degree to which the product meets specifications. Qual-
ity control has become one of the most important precepts of
business.
The expression “quality cannot be inspected into a prod-
uct” is a central theme of organizations today. More and more
world-class companies are following the ideas of total quality
management (TQM), which emphasizes the entire organiza-
tion, from supplier to customer.
Statistical aspects of quality control date to the 1920s but
are of special interest in our global marketplaces of this new
century. Statistical process control tools described in this chap-
ter include the - and R-charts for variable sampling and the
p- and c-charts for attribute sampling.

Glossary
Assignable Variation
Variation in the production process
that can be traced to specific causes.
c-Chart
A quality control chart that is used to control the
number of defects per unit of output.
Central Limit Theorem
The theoretical foundation for 
-charts. It states that regardless of the distribution of the
population of all parts or services, the distribution of s will
tend to follow a normal curve as the sample size grows.
Control Chart
A graphic presentation of process data over
time.
Natural Variations
Variabilities that affect almost every
production process to some degree and are to be expected;
also known as common causes.

p-Chart
A quality control chart that is used to control
attributes.
Quality
The degree to which a product or service meets the
specifications set for it.
R-Chart
A process control chart that tracks the “range”
within a sample; indicates that a gain or loss of uniformity
has occurred in a production process. 
Total Quality Management (TQM)
An emphasis on quality
that encompasses the entire organization.
-Chart
A quality control chart for variables that indicates
when changes occur in the central tendency of a production
process.

Develop appropriate control limits and determine
whether there is any cause for concern in the cutting
process.
16-13 Due to the poor quality of various semiconductor
products used in their manufacturing process,
Microlaboratories has decided to develop a QC
program. Because the semiconductor parts they get
from suppliers are either good or defective, Milton
Fisher has decided to develop control charts for at-
tributes. The total number of semiconductors in
every sample is 200. Furthermore, Milton would like

618
CHAPTER 16 • STATISTICAL QUALITY CONTROL
to determine the upper control chart limit and the
lower control chart limit for various values of the
fraction defective (p) in the sample taken. To allow
more flexibility, he has decided to develop a table
that lists values for p, UCL, and LCL. The values for
p should range from 0.01 to 0.10, incrementing by
0.01 each time. What are the UCLs and the LCLs for
99.7% confidence?
16-14 For the past two months, Suzan Shader has been con-
cerned about machine number 5 at the West Factory.
To make sure that the machine is operating correctly,
samples are taken, and the average and range for
each sample is computed. Each sample consists of 12
items produced from the machine. Recently, 12 sam-
ples were taken, and for each, the sample range and
average were computed. The sample range and sam-
ple average were 1.1 and 46 for the first sample, 1.31
and 45 for the second sample, 0.91 and 46 for the
third sample, and 1.1 and 47 for the fourth sample.
After the fourth sample, the sample averages in-
creased. For the fifth sample, the range was 1.21, and
the average was 48; for sample number 6, it was 0.82
and 47; for sample number 7, it was 0.86 and 50; and
for the eighth sample, it was 1.11 and 49. After the
eighth sample, the sample average continued to
increase, never getting below 50. For sample number
9, the range and average were 1.12 and 51; for sam-
ple number 10, they were 0.99 and 52; for sample
number 11, they were 0.86 and 50; and for sample
number 12, they were 1.2 and 52.
Although Suzan’s boss wasn’t overly concerned
about the process, Suzan was. During installation,
the supplier set a value of 47 for the process average
with an average range of 1.0. It was Suzan’s feeling
that something was definitely wrong with machine
number 5. Do you agree?
16-15 Kitty Products caters to the growing market for cat
supplies, with a full line of products, ranging from
litter to toys to flea powder. One of its newer prod-
ucts, a tube of fluid that prevents hair balls in long-
haired cats, is produced by an automated machine
that is set to fill each tube with 63.5 grams of paste.
To keep this filling process under control, four
tubes are pulled randomly from the assembly line
every 4 hours. After several days, the data shown in
the following table resulted. Set control limits for
this process and graph the sample data for both the -
and R-charts.
16-16 Colonel Electric is a large company that produces
lightbulbs and other electrical products. One partic-
ular lightbulb is supposed to have an average life of

Students must see an advisor, sign up for classes,
obtain a parking permit, pay tuition and fees, and
buy textbooks and other supplies. During one reg-
istration period, 10 students every hour are sam-
pled and asked about satisfaction with each of
these areas. Twelve different groups of students
were sampled, and the number in each group who
had at least one complaint are as follows: 0, 2, 1, 0,
0, 1, 3, 0, 1, 2, 2, 0.
Develop upper and lower control limits (99.7%)
for the proportion of students with complaints.

Using QM for Windows for SPC
The QM for Windows Quality Control module can compute most of the SPC control charts and
limits introduced in this chapter. Once the module is selected, we select New and indicate which
type of chart (p-chart, x-bar chart, or c-chart). Program 16.5A displays the different possible
choices in QM for Windows. When the p-chart is selected for the ARCO example, the initializa-
tion window opens, as displayed in Program 16.5B. We enter a title and the number of samples
(20 in this example), and then click OK. An input window opens, and we enter the 20 sample
values (number of errors or defects in the sample) and specify the sample size (100). We click
Solve, and the output window opens, as illustrated in Program 16.5C. The original input data
and the sample size are displayed, as are the results. While this problem has been set to use the 3
standard deviation (sigma) limits, other values are possible, also. QM for Windows computes
the average proportion 
, standard deviation, and upper and lower control limits. From this
screen, we can select Window and select Control Chart to actually view the chart and look for
patterns which might indicate that the process is out of control.

Appendix A: Areas Under the Standard Normal Curve
Example: To find the area under the normal curve, you must know how many standard deviations
that point is to the right of the mean. Then the area under the normal curve can be read directly from
the normal table. For example, the total area under the normal curve for a point that is 1.55 standard
deviations to the right of the mean is .93943.

APPENDICES
Appendix E: Using POM-QM for Windows
Welcome to POM-QM for Windows. Along with its companion Excel QM (see Appendix F), it makes
available to you the most user-friendly software available for the field of quantitative analysis/
quantitative methods (QA/QM). This software may also be used for the field of production/operations
management (POM). It is possible to display all of the modules, only the QM modules, or only the
POM modules. Because this book is about quantitative methods, only the QM modules are shown
throughout the textbook, and this software is referenced as QM for Windows. QM for Windows is a
package that has been designed to help you to better learn and understand this field. The software can
be used to either solve problems or check answers that have been derived by hand. You will find that
this software is exceptionally friendly due to the following features:

Anyone familiar with any standard spreadsheet or word processor in Windows will easily be
able to use QM for Windows. All modules have help screens that can be accessed at any time.

The screens for every module are consistent, so that when you become accustomed to using
one module, you will have an easy time with the other modules.

The spreadsheet-type data editor allows full screen editing.

Files are opened and saved in the usual Windows fashion, and in addition, files are named by
module, which makes it easy to find files saved previously.

It is easy to change from one solution method to another to compare methods and answers.

Graphs are easily displayed and printed.
Installing POM-QM for Windows
Go to the Companion Website for this book to download and install the POM-QM for Windows
software. Instructions are provided on how to download, install, and register the software.
After the installation and registration is complete, you will have a program group added to your
Program Manager. The group will be called POM-QM for Windows 3. In addition, a shortcut to the
program will be placed on the desktop. To use the QM for Windows program, double-click on the
shortcut on the desktop or use Start, POM-QM for Windows 3, POM-QM for Windows.
The screen that is displayed is the basic screen for the software and contains the assorted com-
ponents that are part of most of the screens. This screen was displayed in Chapter 1 as Program 1.1.
The top of that screen is the standard Windows title bar for the window. Below the title bar is a stan-
dard Windows menu bar. The menu bar should be easy to use. The details of the eight menu options
File, Edit, View, Module, Format, Tools, Window, and Help are explained in this appendix. At the
beginning of the program the only enabled menu options are File (to open a previously saved file or
to exit the program), Module (to select the module), and Help. The other options will become
enabled as a module is chosen or as a problem is started.
Below the menu are two toolbars: a standard toolbar and a format toolbar. The toolbars contain
standard shortcuts for several of the menu commands. If you move the mouse over the button for
about two seconds, an explanation of the button will be displayed on the screen.
The next bar contains an instruction. There is always an instruction here trying to help you to
figure out what to do or what to enter. Currently, the instruction indicates to select a module or open
a file. When data are to be entered into the data table, this instruction will explain what type of data
(integer, real, positive, etc.) are to be entered.
In Program 1.1 in Chapter 1, we show the module list after clicking on Module. We selected to
show only the QM modules. There are 16 modules in this category.
Creating a New Problem
At this point the first option that will be chosen is File, followed by either New or Open to create a
new data set or to load a previously saved data set. This is an option which will be chosen very
often. In some modules, when New is selected, there will be a menu of submodules. Where this is
the case, one of these must be selected before the problem is entered.
The top line of the creation screen contains a text box in which the title of the problem can be
entered. For many modules it is necessary to enter the number of rows in the problem. Rows will
have different names depending on the modules. For example, in linear programming, rows are con-
straints, whereas in forecasting, rows are past periods. The number of rows can be chosen with
either the scroll bar or the text box.
Solving a problem
There are several ways to
solve a problem. The easiest
way is to press the Solve
button on the standard
toolbar. Alternatively, the
function key F9 may be used.
Finally, if you press the enter
key after the last piece of data
is entered, the problem will be
solved. After solving a
problem, to return to editing
the data press the Edit button,
which has replaced the Solve
button on the standard
toolbar, or use F9.

APPENDIX E: USING POM-QM FOR WINDOWS
633
POM-QM for Windows has the capability to allow you different options for the default row
and column names. Select one of the radio buttons to indicate which style of default naming
should be used. In most modules the row names are not used for computations, but you should be
careful because in some modules (most notably, Project Management) the names might relate to
precedences.
Many modules require you to enter the number of columns. This is given in the same way as the
number of rows. All row and column names can be changed in the data table.
Some modules will have an extra option box, such as for choosing minimize or maximize or
selecting whether distances are symmetric. Select one of these options. In most cases this option can
later be changed on the data screen.
When you are satisfied with your choices, click on the OK button or press the Enter key. At
this point, a blank data screen will be displayed. Screens will differ from module to module.
Entering and Editing Data
After a new data set has been created or an existing data set has been loaded, the data can be edited.
Every entry is in a row and column position. You navigate through the spreadsheet using the cursor
movement keys. These keys function in a regular way with one exception—the Enter key.
The instruction bar on the screen will contain a brief instruction describing what is to be done.
There are essentially three types of cells in the data table. One type is a regular data cell into which
you enter either a name or a number. A second type is a cell that cannot be changed. A third type is
a cell that contains a drop-down box. For example, the signs in a linear programming constraint are
chosen from this type of box. To see all of the options, press the box with the arrow.
There is one more aspect to the data screen that needs to be considered. Some modules need
extra data above that in the table. In most of these cases the data are contained in text/scrollbar com-
binations that appear on top of the data table.
Solution Displays
At this point you can press the Solve button to begin the solution process. A new screen will be
displayed.
An important thing to notice is that there is more solution information available. This can be
seen by the icons given at the bottom. Click on these to view the information. Alternatively, notice
that the Window option in the main menu is now enabled. It is always enabled at solution time. Even
if the icons are covered by a window, the Window option will always allow you to view the other
solution windows.
Now that we have examined how to create and solve a problem we explain all of the Menu
options that are available.
File
File contains the usual options that one finds in Windows:
New
As demonstrated before, this is chosen to begin a new problem/file.
Open
This is used to open/load a previously saved file. File selection is the standard Windows
common dialog type. Notice that the extension for files in the QM for Windows system is given by
the first three letters of the module name. For example, all linear programming files have the exten-
sion *.lin. When you go to the open dialog, the default value is for the program to look for files of
the type in this module. This can be changed at the bottom left where it says “Files of Type.”
The names that are legal are standard file names. Case (upper or lower) does not matter. You may
type them in as uppercase, lowercase, or mixed. In all of the examples, QM for Windows will add the
three-letter extension to the end of the file name. For example, linear programming problem will
become linear programming problem.lin (assuming that it is indeed a linear programming problem).
Save
Save will replace the file without asking you if you care about overwriting the previous ver-
sion of this file. If you try to save and have not previously named the file, you will be asked to name
this file.
Save as
Save as will prompt you for a file name before saving. This option is very similar to the
option to load a data file. When you choose this option, the Save As Dialog Box for Files will be
displayed.
Numerical Formatting
Formatting is handled by the
program automatically. For
example, in most cases the
number 1000 will
automatically be formatted as
1,000. Do not type the
comma. The program will
prevent you from doing so!
Deleting Files
It is not possible to delete a
file using QM for Windows.
Use the Windows file
manager to do so.
Enter
This key moves from cell to
cell in the order from left to
right, from top to bottom,
skipping the first column
(which usually contains
names). Therefore, when
entering a table of data, if
you start at the upper left
and work your way to the
lower right row by row, this
key is exceptionally useful.

634
APPENDICES
Save as Excel File
Save as Excel File saves a file as an Excel file with both the data and appropri-
ate formulas for the solutions and is available for some but not all of the modules.
Save as HTML
Save as HTML saves the tables as an HTML formatted file that can immediately
be placed on the Internet.
Print
Print will display a print menu screen with four tabs. The Information tab allows you to
select which of the output tables should be printed. The Page Header tab allows you to control the
information displayed at the top of the page. The Layout tab controls the printing style. Information
may be printed as plain ASCII text or as a table (grid) resembling the table on the screen. Try both
types of printing and see which one you/your instructor prefers. The Print tab allows certain print
settings to be changed.
Exit the Program
The last option on the File menu is Exit. This will exit the program if you are
on the data screen or exit the solution screen and return to the data screen if you are on the solution
screen. This can also be achieved by pressing the Edit command button on the solution screen.
Edit
The commands under Edit have three purposes. The first four commands are used to insert or delete
rows or columns. The next command is used to copy an entry from one cell to all cells below it in
the column. This is not often useful, but when it is useful it saves a great deal of work. The last two
entries can be used to copy the data table to other Windows programs.
View
View has several options that enable you to customize the appearance of the screen. The toolbar can
be displayed or not. The Instruction bar can be displayed at its default location above the data or
below the data, as a floating window, or not at all. The status bar can be displayed or not.
Colors can be set to monochrome (black and white) or from this state to their original colors.
Module
Module is shown in Chapter 1 as Program 1.1. The module selection contains a list of programs
available with this book.
Format
Format also has several options for the display. The colors for the entire screen can be set, and the
font type and size for the table can be set. Zeros can be set to display as blanks rather than zeros.
The problem title that is displayed in the data table and was created at the creation screen can be
changed. The table can be squeezed or expanded. That is, the column widths can be decreased or
increased. The input can be checked or not.
Tools
The Tools menu option is an area available to annotate problems. If you want to write a note to your-
self about the problem, select annotation; the note will be saved with the file if you save the file.
A calculator is available for simple calculations, including square root. There is a normal distri-
bution calculator that can be used for finding confidence intervals and the like.
Window
The Window menu option is enabled only at the solution screen. Additional output is available
under Window. The type of output depends on the module being used.
Help
The Help menu option provides information about the software in general as well as about the indi-
vidual modules. The first time you run POM-QM for Windows, you should select Help and choose
Program Update to ensure that your software has the latest updates.
Help also contains a manual with further details about the program, a link to a program update and
a link for e-mail support. If you send mail, be sure to include the name of the program (POM-QM for
Windows), the version of the program (from Help, About), the module in which the problem is occur-
ring, and a detailed explanation of the problem, and to attach the data file for which the problem occurs.
A normal distribution
calculator is found in the Tools
menu option.

Appendix F: Using Excel QM and Excel Add-Ins
Excel QM
Excel QM has been designed to help you to better learn and understand both quantitative analysis
and Excel. Even though the software contains many modules and submodules, the screens for every
module are consistent and easy to use. The modules are illustrated in Programs 1.2A.
Excel QM is an add-in to Excel, so you must have Excel on your PC. To install Excel QM, go
to the Companion Website for instructions and the free download. An Excel QM icon will be placed
on your desktop. 
To run Excel QM, simply click the icon, and Excel will start, with the Excel QM add-in avail-
able. From the Add-In tab, select Excel QM, and the available methods will be displayed. When you
move the cursor to the one you want to use, available options for that method may appear to the
right. Select the appropriate option for the problem you want to enter. A window will open for you
to input information about the problem, such as the number of variables or the number of observa-
tions. When you click OK, a spreadsheet that has been initialized will appear. Instructions are
included in a text box that appears just below the title that has been given to that problem. These
instructions typically indicate what you must enter on the worksheet and, for certain methods, what
other steps are necessary to obtain the final solution. For many of the modules, no further steps are
necessary. For others, such as linear programming, Excel QM will have provided the inputs and
made the necessary selections for the use of Solver.
Excel QM serves two purposes in the learning process. First, it can simply help you solve
homework problems. You enter the appropriate data, and the program provides numerical solutions.
QM for Windows operates on the same principle. But Excel QM allows for a second approach, that
is, noting the Excel formulas used to develop solutions and modifying them to deal with a wider
variety of problems. This “open” approach allows you to observe, understand, and even change the
formulas underlying the Excel calculations, conveying Excel’s power as a quantitative analysis tool.
Technical Support for Excel QM
If you have technical problems with either POM-QM for Windows or Excel QM that your instruc-
tor cannot answer, send an e-mail to the address found at the www.prenhall. com/weiss website. If
you send e-mail, be sure to include the name of the program (POM-QM for Windows or Excel QM),
the version of the program (from Help, About in POM-QM for Windows; from QM About in Excel
QM), the module in which the problem is occurring, and a detailed explanation of the problem, and
to attach the data file for which the problem occurs (if appropriate).
Activating Excel Add-ins in Excel 2007 and 2010
Two important Excel add-ins are Solver and Analysis ToolPak. Both of these are a part of Excel but
must be activated or loaded before you can use them the first time. To load these add-ins, follow
these steps (step 1a is for Excel 2010 users and step 1b is for Excel 2007 users): 
1a. For Excel 2010, click the File tab, click Options, and then click Add-Ins.
1b. For Excel 2007, click the Microsoft Office button, click Excel Options, and then click Add-Ins.
2. In the Manage box, select Excel Add-Ins and click Go.
3. Check the boxes next to Analysis ToolPak and Solver Add-In, and then click OK. 
The Data tab now displays Solver and Data Analysis every time Excel is started. Instructions on
using Data Analysis for regression are provided in Chapter 4. Instructions on using Solver for linear
programming are provided in Chapter 7.
